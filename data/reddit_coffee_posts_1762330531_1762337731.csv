1ooz3of,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1ooz3of/i_think_my_dad_was_masturbating_in_the_same_room/,I think my dad was masturbating in the same room as me,"Not sure if this is the right tag for it btw, but essentially, I don’t live with my dad. He lives in the town where I got a new job in and it’s mainly remote apart from going in a couple times a month, so I usually travel up and spend a night then head back home after work. He lives in a studio flat, and insists I take the bed whilst he takes a mattress on the ground just in front of the bed. I feel a bit bad, but his bed isn’t big enough for us to comfortably sleep.

It’s usually gone without a hitch. Now, I know my dad has had a seedy side; from porn channels being available on the TV unbeknownst to my mum when I was younger, using his iPad and trying to go back to a page and his history was just filled with porn and even his digitally wandering eye on Facebook that I have noticed despite having been in a relationship since 2019. Last night, I stupidly had a coffee quite late in the day and I’m very sensitive to caffeine so I already couldn’t sleep as soon as I wish to (I usually fall asleep in less than 10 mins so the second I don’t I know something is up) so I was tossing and turning. Before I went to bed I noticed he had headphones on and I asked him and he said he had something he wanted to listen to before bed and I didn’t think much of it and went to bed. Fast forward 40 or so minutes, and I see his phone is on and I can hear heavy breathing and genuinely questionable noises. I didn’t dare move or look because initially I was just speechless that he would do this whilst I’m in the same room as him, knowing full well the bathroom is right there and he’s a dad, if he was in there for an hour I would think nothing of it.

This kept going for a long time, even after I got up and used the bathroom and he asked if I had managed to fall asleep and I told him no. I laid down again and he started again, maybe he thought I couldn’t hear him or I fell asleep. I feel so fucking disgusting and I would have felt that way with ANYONE, but especially my literal father beating his meat less than 2 metres from me. It made my blood boil, and combined with the lack of sleep knowing I had to get up early, I pretty much just cried out of frustration until I eventually fell asleep.

He obviously acted like nothing happened this morning; I barely slept so I forfeited the office to work from home, but it’s not really about the sleep, I feel so disgusting and even speaking to him is making me feel really uncomfortable. I feel like I need to shower again and proceed to clean the whole place because I just feel fucking rank. I tried speaking to my mum without disclosing what he was doing (I told her he just kept me up at night with making noise and that I saw him on his phone and he’d hide it everytime I walked past him to the bathroom) and she essentially said she felt bad that he gave up the bed for me and I should be appreciative of him letting me essentially do whatever and come and go as I please, and it made me feel so much worse. I feel like I have nobody I can speak to about this. I know that if I told her exactly what happened she would lose her mind and totally get why I was so angry on the phone this morning but I just don’t want to. I wish I just fell asleep and didn’t know it happened. I feel so fucking disgusting.",1,1762337632.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False
1ooz3cp,https://www.reddit.com/r/bicycletouring/comments/1ooz3cp/why_mallorca_is_one_of_our_favourite_cycling/,Why Mallorca is one of our favourite cycling destinations,"https://preview.redd.it/p1c6g01lyezf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=feb2cbd8218834c4e9d6231aba84090bfe0a6166

  
Hi there! We’re Epic Road Rides: a small team of passionate cyclists who love exploring the best rides out there, both on and off-road. Excited to share tips, routes, and stories with you all! We'll share our favourite destinations here with you, including tips and tricks!

Mallorca combines big-screen scenery with hassle-free logistics. The Tramuntana range threads clifftop roads and steady climbs between Andratx and Pollença, serving up views that make every coffee stop earned. You can chase famous climbs one day and spin gentle lanes the next without moving hotel. 

**Best ride ideas** 

* Showpiece coastal traverse: Start in Andratx and follow the rugged west coast towards Pollença. It’s a greatest-hits reel of viewpoints, balcony bends and blue water. Use a pre-booked shuttle to make it a comfortable one-way tour. 
* Iconic climbs: Sa Calobra’s coiled tarmac is the poster child, but don’t miss Coll de Sóller, Sa Batalla or the quiet ramps to Port de Valldemossa. Gradients are honest rather than brutal, so you can pace the effort. 
* Easy, family-friendly miles: Palma’s waterfront cycleway is a relaxed out-and-back with cafés every few kilometres. S’Albufera’s nature-reserve tracks are traffic free and great for recovery days. 

**When to go**   
For most riders, spring is the sweet spot: blossom in the fields, reliable temperatures and open facilities. Autumn runs a close second, with calmer roads and warm seas. Winter offers peaceful riding but cold snaps can hit the high passes and some shops reduce hours. June–August brings heat and busy roads; ride at dawn, aim for shaded climbs and plan longer café stops. Whatever the season, carry a light shell: summits can be breezy even when the coast is toasty. 

**Where to stay** 

* North base (Port de Pollença / Alcúdia): Quick access to classic climbs and quiet inland lanes. Great for mixing big mountain views with flatter touring days. 
* Palma: Best for riders who want city restaurants and rest-day options. The long promenade is perfect for partner or family rides without traffic stress. 

Both bases have plenty of cyclist-friendly hotels and apartments, so you can choose between beachy convenience and urban buzz. 

**Bike hire, simplified** 

You’ll find reputable hire shops in Palma, Port de Pollença and Alcúdia, with carbon road bikes, e-road options and accessories. In peak periods, reserve early and confirm delivery if you’re staying outside town. Bring your pedals and shoes, check brake set-up matches your home country, set saddle height carefully, and ask about theft cover before you leave the shop. 

**A tourer’s 4-day sampler**   
Day 1: Palma shake-out along the bay, coffee on the promenade.   
Day 2: Transfer north; spin an inland loop through Sineu’s market streets.   
Day 3: Big day: Andratx to Pollença coastal ride (one-way with shuttle).   
Day 4: Sa Calobra or Coll de Sóller for the iconic photo, then an easy roll to the beach. 

You’ll leave with sun-warmed legs, a full camera roll and a plan to come back for the roads you didn’t quite fit in.

1ooz2hp,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_nikkagency0382/comments/1ooz2hp/divorce_immigration_in_israel_is_a_whole/,Divorce + immigration in Israel is… a whole personality test,"I never thought I’d be one of those people writing emotional posts about divorce online, but here we go. **If it helps someone — worth it.**

https://preview.redd.it/k526ud17yezf1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1c46f0e7501fcc87cb24659afacf29a730e7712

I moved to Haifa from Ukraine years before the war. Fell in love, got married, learned to say “beseder” in 50 different moods, had kids, built a life. And then one day you realize you're not partners anymore, you're just… roommates with shared laundry baskets and joint custody of a coffee machine.

Divorce in Israel hits differently. It’s not just paperwork — it's religion, law, culture, bureaucracy, and a bunch of strangers asking questions that feel too personal.

And when you’re not local-born? The anxiety is real. No matter how long you live here, that “do I really belong?” thought can pop up fast.

The first encounter: Rabbinical court = emotional freezer

Let me put it bluntly: walking into a rabbinical court felt like someone unplugged my feelings and turned on fluorescent lights instead.

No space for tears. Just facts. Documents. Structure. Silence.

And if you're a repat? That tiny fear appears:

“What if they see me as temporary here?”

Spoiler: motherhood in Israel isn’t proven with love, it’s proven with logistics — doctors’ appointments, gan chats, homework, schedules. The court doesn’t want drama. It wants proof that you're present.

I got lucky with the lawyer I found

At 2 AM, scrolling through panic and forums that should honestly come with a warning banner, I found this:

👉 [https://katsmanlaw.co.il/](https://katsmanlaw.co.il/)

And later showed the Hebrew version to a friend: 👉 [https://katsmanlaw.co.il/he/](https://katsmanlaw.co.il/he/)

No sales pitch. No “we’ll destroy your ex.” Just questions like:

“What do you want your kids to remember about this period of life?”

That hit harder than any legal advice ever could.

And his style? Less “attack dog” — more “strategic calm.” He literally told me:

“We don’t prove, we show. Israeli courts respect steady people.”

And for the first time in months — someone made the future feel possible instead of terrifying.

The process wasn’t glamorous, but it worked

We organized everything: Schedules, school involvement, health records, daily routines… not to fight, but to show reality.

Result?

Joint custody. Reasonable decisions. Kids with both parents present — not battlefield trophies.

And honestly, that felt like winning life, not just court.

**Life after**

Now mornings mean packing lunchboxes, arguing over socks, whispering “yalla” 40 times before school, and grabbing a coffee in the sunshine.

Not perfect. Not easy. But calm. And finally — mine.

If you’re in a similar place

A few things I wish someone told me earlier:

Don’t crowdsource legal strategy from Telegram chats

Israeli system isn’t anti-you — it just loves order

Calm = power in this process

You do belong here, even if fear whispers otherwise

If you need to see real cases to believe it's possible: 👉 [https://katsmanlaw.co.il/vyigrannye-dela/semejnoe-pravo-izrailya-razvody-razdel-imushestva-alimenty-opeka-nad-detmi-nasledstvo](https://katsmanlaw.co.il/vyigrannye-dela/semejnoe-pravo-izrailya-razvody-razdel-imushestva-alimenty-opeka-nad-detmi-nasledstvo)

And if you're at the beginning — you're not weak. You're rebuilding.

Israel is loud, messy, emotional — but also weirdly good at teaching resilience.

Machine: Sage Bambino Plus (Sea Salt) - £295 - Harts Of Stur
Grinder: DF64 Gen 2 (White) - £379.05 - Sigma Coffee UK

Thought I'd post here as there isn't a lot of photos with both white (ish) machines together... But I think it looks great! The knock box to match is also a nice addition.

So far I've upgraded the tamper and purchased a dosing ring & WDT tool. I can't see myself needing to change much else! 

The Sage Bambino is incredible for its size and cost. It's ready to go in under 6 seconds, which is an absolute essential for me when making coffee during the work day.

The DF64 Gen 2 is also incredibly good. It is loud (I expected that from other reviews) but overall I wouldn't change a thing. Retention is around 0.1g.

I've only had the setup for 3 weeks but it's been incredibly fun playing around with different coffee beans and grind sizes. Feel free to ask any questions (I found Reddit an invaluable tool when researching my setup) and I'll do my best to help!",1,1762337070.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

The odd thing is that for the last two weeks I’ve developed a really powerful metallic taste in my mouth and especially tongue. I can’t drink my usual protein shake - just a sip made me gag and throw up 🤢, coffee and most drinks are off the cards but generally most things just taste awful like all metallic and bitter.  It’s put a spanner in the spokes as I had a good routine with scrambled eggs for breakfast, a protein shake mid morning, chicken and protein lunch with salad etc and all of those things are impossible to eat without wanting to be ill.

I had a look through the threads and most people talk of this happening at the beginning of their journey. Wondering if anyone has had this develop later into their MJ journey and if anyone has any tips to help control the taste and gagging? ",1,1762337058.0,mounjarouk,0,1.0,False

1ooyudr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ooyudr,New Dishes / updated Area Overview / Amber Canyon Area Dex graphics,"Final preview of Amber Canyon following the latest datamine (usual credits to Serebii and RaenonX).

4 new dishes involving Glossy Avocado (base strength 162). Including the recent Pumpkin dishes, these 6 dishes are split evenly across the dish types (2 each). See graphics below highlighting the new dishes on their own, and where they slot in against all other dishes (base strengths listed however ranked with filler ingredients for fairer comparisons).

Each dish type sees a new #1 recipe, which will bring in around 150k per cook at base when hitting the new Area Bonus cap of 85%. Overgrow Gratin will require 2x Expand Pot triggers however, even from the new Pot Size cap of 81 (there's no rush to unlock it, stopping at 75 will make every other recipe reachable with 1x max level Expand Pot trigger).

Amber Canyon debuts with a lean Unique Species count of only 57 (new lowest in the game, previously Snowdrop Tundra at 61). Area Overview graphic now includes this species count in white to the left of each Area name plate. This figure is often worth keeping in mind when events boost appearance rates where you would take into consideration spawn pool saturation. Also end graphic lists the Area Dex in it's entirety. Longer term players might be able to guess/will likely appreciate the Area's special Ditto sleep style (kept off the graphic so not to spoil it for those not wanting to know).

I'll be back tomorrow with some more graphics when players start friending the new mons, at which time the Specialities, Speeds, Ingredient Lists, Main Skills, etc can only be known (a new Ingredient Draw variant has been found however so I expect one of the new mons to be Skills and packing it, potentially a viable source of Avocado 😉)",10,1762336663.0,PokemonSleep,2,1.0,False

Before time had a name, there were two forces that never rested.
One built reality; the other gave it meaning.

They were called Javloyd Ultima, the Architect of All That Is,
and Saitajun Omniparadox, the Story That Always Ends.

Ultima shaped galaxies like thoughts.
Omniparadox filled them with tales of love, rage, triumph, and loss.
Together they made eternity spin.

But after countless cycles, they faced the one truth neither could rewrite: they were tired.

Every ending had already been written.
Every law had already been perfected.
And perfection, they discovered, was just another kind of death.

So they chose exile—not punishment, but curiosity.
They folded their omnipotence into fragile vessels of flesh and heartbeat.
They would live where seconds mattered, where pain meant progress, where a smile could undo a storm.

When they opened their eyes again, the stars were streetlights, and the galaxies had become a single sprawling city that smelled of rain and diesel.

They took names the world could pronounce:

> Dr. Javloyd Amsel — quiet engineer, eyes like tired constellations.
Jun Saite — restless writer, haunted by stories he can’t remember writing.



No one knew they had once written the blueprints of existence.
Now they just paid rent, argued over coffee, and tried to understand what it meant to feel.

And somewhere, buried beneath the noise of human life,
Infinity waited—watching its two lost architects learning how to breathe.

1ooym6e,https://i.redd.it/o57b0gs2tezf1.jpeg,Bali Coworking – Is it Working from Paradise or Overhyped?,"Hey community! I want to share my thoughts after three months of working from Bali's coworking spaces. I hope this helps those who are just planning their trip.

Bali isn't just a place; it's a working ecosystem.

If you imagine yourself working on a laptop on the beach with the sound of waves – forget it. Sun, sand, and screen glare are incompatible. But the real magic of Bali is hidden in its incredible coworking spaces.

What makes them special?

1. Networking that actually works. You don't need to artificially ""build a network"" here. You're just ordering a coffee next to someone who's coding for a startup from Silicon Valley, while at the next table, a designer from Berlin is creating an interface for a new social network. Common areas, evening meetups, and just the casual atmosphere do the trick – connections happen naturally.
2. Infrastructure for productivity. Fast and stable internet (usually with a backup connection in case of outages), comfortable ergonomic chairs, air conditioning, meeting rooms for calls – it has everything you need to focus. And yes, it's way better than trying to work from a villa where the Wi-Fi might drop at the most inconvenient time.
3. ""All-inclusive"" for the digital nomad. Many spaces, like Dojo Bali (Canggu) or Tropical Nomads (Seminyak), offer not just a desk, but a whole experience. A pool to cool off between tasks, a cafe with healthy and delicious food, community managers who organize everything from morning yoga to weekend surf trips.

But there's a downside too:

· Price. For the local cost of living, coworking spaces aren't cheap. A day pass can set you back 150-250k IDR (~$10-16), and a monthly membership can cost as much as renting a scooter for a month.
· Noisy and social. If your work requires complete silence and solitude, it can be challenging during peak hours (11 AM - 5 PM). These are places for extroverts and those who draw energy from being around others.
· Competition for seats. In the high season, finding a convenient spot near a power outlet in popular spots like Outpost or Bwork can be a real quest in the morning.

The Verdict:

Bali's coworking spaces aren't just workplaces. They are the epicenter of digital nomad life, where the line between work and leisure blurs. It's a chance to be among like-minded people, to recharge your energy and motivation.

Is it worth it? Absolutely yes, if only to try it and see if it's your thing. For me personally, it was the main factor that turned my trip to Bali from a vacation into a lifestyle.

What do you think? What's your top coworking space in Bali and why? Share your experiences in the comments.",1,1762335778.0,bali_live,0,1.0,False

i’m quite happy to go to clubs , drink or just hang out doing anything. everyone in my class has been incredibly unfriendly so far and i’m losing hope lol. any suggestions on anywhere to meet similar aged people? there’s possibly about 5 societies total in my university and none of them interest me. i feel desperate posting on here but hoping someone can help!! thank you :)  

edit : interests!  i’m doing an art degree so love art of course , i love music ( mostly metal and rock ) i love to play music too as a guitar and piano player. i like animals , love walks and nature. quite enjoy going out at night to different things. but very happy to grab coffee and shop and talk. happy to try sport if the kind people are involved.",2,1762335738.0,canterbury,6,1.0,False

Over the weekend, Seoul completed sanitary negotiations to export beef and pork from cattle and pigs raised on Jeju Island to Singapore.

Singapore has become Korea's sixth official overseas market for *hanwoo* (Korean beef).  
   
Korea also concluded its 17-year-long quarantine negotiations with China to export persimmons to the country during a summit between President Lee Jae Myung and Chinese leader Xi Jinping held Saturday on the sidelines of the APEC leaders' summit in Gyeongju, North Gyeongsang.  
   
""The latest agreements mark an important milestone for expanding the global reach of Korean food products,"" Agriculture Minister Song Mi-ryung said in a regular press conference held at the government complex in the administrative city of Sejong.  
   
""Through continued quarantine negotiations, we will actively support Korean agricultural and livestock products in entering new global markets,"" she added.  
   
Song said the government will start issuing a document on the export status and related regulations of different countries to help devise a strategy for expanding its agricultural exports.  
   
Earlier this year, Seoul announced an annual target of $14 billion in food exports for 2025.  
   
In the first nine months of this year, the country's exports of food products hit an all-time high of $8.5 billion, jumping 8.9 percent from a year earlier.

Spread visual “weight” so one side doesn’t feel heavy. Pair one substantial item (a large vase or lidded jar) with two lighter elements (a candle and a small object). Keep clear landing zones so people can set down a drink without playing Jenga.

# “Rule of Nine” Layout

Style it like you frame a photo. Picture a 3×3 tic-tac-toe grid over the tabletop—the same “rule of thirds” photographers use to keep a shot balanced and interesting.

Hit a power point: Set your hero piece (tall vase, sculptural object, or branchy greens) on one of the four intersections, not dead center.

Give smalls a lane: Drop a tray into a different third to corral candles, matches, or a lidded box.

Let it breathe: Leave one third purposefully open for drinks or a laptop. That negative space is your “sky,” and it keeps the scene calm.

Link the story: Use a short stack of books to bridge the hero and the tray without crowding the frame.

Why it works: The grid organizes the surface the way a viewfinder organizes a shot—clear focal point, clean sightlines, and built-in balance that feels natural, not staged.

# Stack Books, Create Vertical Interest

Begin with a solid base—often a tray—and build upward from there. A stack of two or three hardcover books provides a low platform, adding height without overwhelming the space. On top, place an object that creates dimension, like a bud vase, a small sculpture, or a decorative box. Books elevate smaller items, like a candle or bowl, giving them more presence on the table.

Create a balanced flow of heights—low, medium, and high—rather than placing three items of the same size.

Keep your stacks around 2-3 books high to avoid feeling too top-heavy or too minimal.

Vary book sizes and textures—mixing linen covers, glossy art books, and vintage spines—so it feels like a curated collection instead of a matching set.

Let the titles reflect your personal interests (design, photography, travel) to give the styling a more personal touch.

Pro tip: If your table is near the TV, avoid placing the tallest item in direct sight. Slide it to the back corner or swap for a smaller piece to maintain an unobstructed view.

The Sherrif, who had spoken to me all morning while I showed him my notes and explained things, said just about the same thing. ""Bill- I mean, *Mr. Buchanan*\- sure did save your life, son."" He said. ""You are very lucky to have him as a neighbor... Your mom, she... She probably would have gutted you like a *trout* if you didn't decide to escape the house and go to him.""

""I suppose I would have, yes."" I said meekly, drinking stale coffee from a paper cup. It was the last of the pot that was in the break room, and the Sherrif was willing to give it to me due to my circumstances. ""I feel very thankful that Mr. Buchanan was willing to help me.""

The Sherrif sat down at his desk and placed a large stack of paperwork on his desk, putting on a pair of thick reading glasses as he began to look through it. ""That man is a different breed of human, but that doesn't stop him from loving everyone like a brother.... Or, in *your* case, a *son*.... When would you say the house blew up?"" He looked up at me then, his reading glasses sliding down the brim of his nose a bit. ""Around 7:15 or so?"" I nodded, taking another sip of coffee. ""And you got to the scene of the crime around 7:30?"" I nodded again. ""And that's when you both saw her standing in the driveway, huh?""

""Yes,"" I said. ""We sat there for a few minutes until she started coming at us. At that point, Mr. Buchanan-""

""Ran her over."" The Sherrif said, pushing his reading glasses up. ""And when you went to look back to see the damage, your mom was gone.... I inspected the area and found no blood, no hair, no *nothing*.... No signs that she had been struck by a vehicle *whatsoever*. I asked the fire department if they found any signs of her as well, and they swore up and down that no one found any evidence that she was on that road. What they *did* find, however, was a severed dog head and a bloody stick- we both know where *that* came from.""

""Did the fire department have an answer to how the house exploded?"" I asked.

""They speculate that she lined the house with gasoline, put a propane tank down on the floor near the back door, and shot the gas with some sort of pistol."" was the reply. ""Did either of your parents own firearms?""

""My dad owned a Colt 45 that he bought at a yard sale."" I said. ""She must've used that."" The Sherrif took a pencil out from a coffee mug that was filled with an assortment of writing utensils and wrote what I had reported down onto a page that was halfway through the stack, continuing to look through it thereafter. ""Sherrif, do you- do you believe that she was a Wendigo?""

The Sherrif completely froze up then, not saying a word for a moment. After a while he glanced up at me and said, ""After what you have told me, yes, *I do*.""

""Does *everyone else* who is here believe that?"" I asked.

""Does a cat lick it's ass to clean itself?""

""*Noted*.""

The Sherrif returned to the papers and kept flipping through them for a while, neither of us saying anything else. ""Son, I've gotten everything that I need from you."" He said after some time. ""You're free to leave."" *Free to leave?* I thought, standing up and throwing my empty cup into the trash. *Leave with who? And to where? Obviously, neither of my parents are capable of picking me up and I can't call anyone to pick me up because my phone is gone.... And my fucking house exploded!*

""I don't have a ride to.... Go *anywhere*, sir. Or anyone to give me a ride. "" I said, standing awkwardly next to his desk.

The Sherrif smiled at me and replied, ""I handled it. Go outside; your ride is out front."" I thanked him and left his office then, being patted on the back by a few deputies as I was walking to the lobby. The receptionist stopped me for a second and handed me a large Snickers bar, giving her condolences before I went outside to see a blue flatbed truck parked out front, Cassy's mother getting out of the driver's side, still clad in her Walmart uniform. Her name tag jiggled around as she scurried over to me- a scurry is all she really could do, since Mrs. Buchanan was a squat, overweight woman- and brought me into an embrace, laughing and crying at the same time. Some of the curly, long red hair that was from her giant mullet got into my mouth as she did so, but I didn't care. I was just happy that someone was hugging me and was genuinely happy to see that I was alright. *I ask myself this once again,* I thought, grinning from ear to ear as I was let go and brought over to the truck. *Why couldn't my parents be like this?*

We got into the truck and I said, ""Mrs. Buchanan, thank you for coming to pick me up, but I don't have anywhere to go.""

""Whatduya mean? You *do* have a place to go!"" Mrs. Buchanan said, starting the engine. Her Jersey accent made me want to laugh, but I kept myself together, focusing more of the question to how a man like Bill Buchanan could bag a Jewish Jersey girl. ""You're staying at *our* place, no if's, and's, or but's! And you're staying there for as long as you need!""

""Thank you, Mrs.-""

""Call me *Sheryl*, honey. You're *family* now.""

""Thank you, Sheryl.""

After that day, I was officially, but yet technically, a Buchanan, and I could have never ask for anything more. I stayed with them for the rest of high school, finally getting the type of family that I wanted- but never getting the freedom that I deserved. Spiritual freedom, at that, because my mother's voice called my name from the woods every night, asking me why I killed the dog and why I killed my father, even though she knew it was her who did it. She would call so much that I had to keep my bedroom window closed in order to get proper sleep, and she would yell so much that people who lived near us constantly reported to the Sherrif's office that there was someone making a commotion in the woods when it got dark. Complaints from them got piled up to the point where five Wisconsin police stations wound up sending officers out to the area to do patrols..... And said five Wisconsin police stations kept having said officers go missing every week, wiped off of the face of the earth, consumed by what used to be Michelle Watkins.

The same thing happened when the police in Minnesota tried to investigate the farm that Frank had after the Sherrif had sent them details about what was going on there. Officer after officer kept going missing and leaving behind no trace to where they could have gone, and when witnesses of the disappearances spoke about what they saw, every single one of them said the same thing that the guy on the forum wrote.

It was my first time in alaska and we had a wonderful time!!. Too bad, the weather, was very windy, rainy and cloudy my 4 days there. She took me to the following places:  
Alaskan and Proud, Safeway grocery/gas station, Walmart, Ocean View Restaurante, Alava's Fish N Chowder and B & D espresso. The Ferry ride was fun, riding across from the airport to the mainland and in expensive, depending if you want to walk, ride, or park on the ferry and ride. I didnt get the chance to do everything, next time I return to visit my girl friend, I will do some Salmon fishing, Bear watching, shoot some guns, and visit the totem heritage center. Everyone was very friendly, polite and greeted me. For some reason, they knew I wasn't from the area. Maybe my haircut, my clothes and how I talked gave it away.

Ocean View Restaurante had one of the best combo fajitas, steak , shrimp and chicken. Sizzling and delicious. B&D has the best coffee in town, I ordered 32oz cookies and cream frappe, snicker drizzle with whipped cream. Why buy starbucks when you can buy B&D espresso. The coffee was so gooood, girlfriend and I went back the next morning. Also spent time with my girlfriends family,  I met her oldest sister and her brother in law (husband). Invited me for a very tasty dinner, she made Creamy Chicken thighs with mushrooms, spinach and delicious home made tossed salad. Of course, for night crap treat, had some Crown royal and apple. No ice, straight up, old fashioned glass. For my last day, we had lunch at Alava's Fish and chowder. The best cod and chips I've ever had. And on the way home from B&D, met her baby sister and mother.

No notes, no flashcards, no motivation - until panic hit :)

Two weeks later, I passed. Here’s exactly what worked (and what didn’t).

🧠 Week 1 - Rebuild your foundation

Forget fancy prep books at first. Start by relearning the big picture.  
YouTube is your friend - there’s a ton of free content that actually helps if you focus.

What I did:

* Watched “EMT for Dummies / NREMT for Dummies” - took detailed notes.
* Then “Crush the NREMT-B Exam (Free Study Guide)” - this one’s gold. I didn’t just listen - I paused constantly, rewrote things in my own words, and made quick summaries.
* Whenever I got bored, I switched to shorter “Signs & Symptoms” or “Top 10 NREMT Mistakes” videos.

By the end of the first week, I had a messy but usable set of notes.

Key point: focus on *understanding systems*, not memorizing isolated facts.

💪 Week 2 - Practice mode only

Once I had the basics, I switched entirely to practice questions from an app (there are tons on iOS/Android, pick one you like).

Here’s the trick:

* Don’t rush. Read every explanation - even the ones you got right
* Track your weak topics (mine were airway and pediatrics)
* Spend extra time on primary assessment, scene safety, and patient priorities - that’s where most questions come from
* Revisit your notes when you miss something repeatedly

I also hand-wrote the GCS, vital signs, APGAR, stroke scales, and triage tags every night before bed.

Sounds old-school, but it helps a lot with recall under pressure!

🚑 Exam day (Day 16)

I reviewed all my quick notes and did 20-30 warm-up questions in the app.

No cramming, no coffee overdose - just keeping the brain calm.

My test didn’t stop at 70 questions (it went to 102), so don’t panic if yours keeps going.

Got my “You passed!” email within an hour.

💡 Quick practical tips:

Scene safety first. PPE, stable vehicle, safe environment - that’s always priority.

* Airway and oxygenation beat almost everything else
* Learn classic symptom patterns, e.g.:
   * RUQ pain -> gallbladder
   * RLQ pain -> appendicitis
   * Pregnant + abdominal pain -> abruptio vs previa
   * Enclosed space + dizziness -> CO poisoning
* Pupils: dilated = stimulant, constricted = opioid
* Wheeze/stridor = upper airway; rhonchi/rales = lower airway
* **Don’t overthink.** Usually, the “safest” or “most immediate” answer wins.
* **Sleep the night before** \- fatigue kills focus more than lack of knowledge.

Passing the NREMT isn’t about being perfect - it’s about thinking like an EMT. Stay calm, trust your process, and remember: if you can stabilize your nerves, you can stabilize anything :)

[Muslim](https://www.israelhayom.com/2025/11/05/nyc-mayoral-election-results-mamdani-shiite-islam-new-york/) communities cheered across New York Tuesday night as Zohran Mamdani secured the mayoral race, with hundreds gathering in a Queens coffee shop for an election night celebration hosted by the Muslim Democratic Club of New York and allied organizations, *The New York Times* reported.

Mamdani's January 1 inauguration establishes him as America's most prominent Muslim elected official. By late Tuesday, Mamdani accumulated approximately one million votes — roughly half of the more than two million cast — marking the highest NYC mayoral race total in over 50 years. The affordability message proved decisive, attracting masses of working-class voters, many casting first-time ballots, with working-class Muslims prominently featured.

https://reddit.com/link/1ooyc99/video/k8cizaamoezf1/player

Mamdani's campaign blended social-media expertise with traditional grassroots organizing, deploying thousands of volunteers for door-knocking throughout heavily Muslim areas in Queens, Brooklyn, and the Bronx while communicating in Arabic, Bangla, and Urdu. He incorporated his faith by praying with fellow Muslims during visits exceeding 50 mosques and generated viral attention by posting a photo showing him eating a burrito on the Q train to break his Ramadan fast, which Muslim New Yorkers saw as a comfortable acknowledgment of their daily faith and culture. Rana Abdelhamid, a Queens nonprofit founder, told *The New York Times:* ""Muslims are literally everywhere in the city"" and ""Educators, business owners from bodegas. Walk down the street, you're going to get halal food. We've been the backbone of so many parts of the city for so long, and now this is our time.""

Multiple Muslim community leaders anticipate increased political engagement citywide following Mamdani's victory, with two Bangladeshi candidates recently announcing Queens campaigns, including Mary Jobaida, who is seeking Mamdani's Astoria state assembly seat.

when my body feels like a memory that refuses to rest.  
My bones remember promises that never came true.  
My hands remember the warmth they used to hold  
and my heart still flinches  
at the sound of goodbye.

I was once someone’s forever.  
He said it with a steady voice  
and I believed it  
because back then, forever didn’t sound like a lie.  
It sounded like home.  
But one day, home walked out the door  
and didn’t come back.

Now I live in a house built from routines  
school mornings, medicine schedules  
whispers of “Mama, are you okay?”  
and the kind of silence that hums louder than pain.

My illness  
it’s the quiet kind  
the one that teaches you how to smile  
while your body quietly falls apart  
the one that teaches you to count your good days  
like loose coins in your palm  
never knowing when they’ll run out.

And yet  
in the middle of all that breaking  
there’s a pulse inside me that still wants to love.  
Not the dramatic kind  
not the whirlwind romance that burns bright and disappears  
but the kind that sits beside you in the dark  
and doesn’t ask you to be strong.

But when I think of love  
guilt sits beside me too.  
It asks  
how dare you want more  
you already have two souls who love you endlessly  
isn’t that enough

And I whisper back  
yes, it’s enough to live for  
but who said I stopped wanting to feel alive

Because I am not just a mother  
not just a patient  
not just the woman he left  
I am still the woman who laughs too loud  
who dreams too much  
who wants to wake up to someone saying  
I made coffee, come sit awhile.

But fear  
fear is the shadow that follows every heartbeat.  
What if he sees my scars and thinks  
this is too heavy  
what if he loves me only until the next hospital trip  
what if he stays  
but not because of love  
but because of pity

And what if he stays  
not because he truly wants me  
but because he believes God sent him to me  
what if I am not the woman he longs for  
but the soul he feels responsible to guide  
a fragile assignment wrapped in flesh and longing

What if I am prayed for  
but never truly chosen  
watched over  
but never wanted  
held gently  
but never claimed

It hurts  
to be seen as something sacred  
but not desired  
to be needed for healing  
but never for loving  
to know that someone’s presence  
is devotion in duty  
not desire in return

Because all I ever wanted  
was to be met halfway  
not worshiped for my wounds  
not pitied for my pain  
but simply loved  
as a woman  
who still believes she can be enough.

I’ve built walls so carefully  
that even I forget where the doors are.  
People call it strength  
I call it survival.

But sometimes  
in the quiet hours when the world finally stops demanding  
when my children are asleep  
and my medicine’s lined up neatly on the table  
I allow myself to dream.

That maybe somewhere  
there’s a man who won’t see my illness as a countdown  
but as proof of how long I’ve fought.

That he’ll see my body not as fragile  
but sacred  
because it carried life  
and loss  
and still dares to hold love again.

I don’t need saving.  
I just want a hand that won’t let go  
when the tremor starts.  
A voice that says  
I’m not afraid of your tomorrow.  
A heart that stays  
when mine beats unevenly.

Maybe love won’t heal me.  
Maybe it won’t even last.  
But maybe it will remind me  
that I am still capable of being seen  
not for what’s breaking  
but for what still shines underneath the ruin.

Because even the sick deserve softness.  
Even the abandoned deserve to be found.  
Even the tired deserve tenderness.

And maybe, just maybe  
I still have the right  
to love  
to be loved  
to begin again.

Because I am more than what I’ve survived  
I am what still refuses to stop loving.",1,1762334060.0,u_Select-Moose-992,0,1.0,False

But with some costs","[https://old.reddit.com/r/Cholesterol/comments/1m8anxf/bulking\_as\_a\_skinny\_guy\_with\_increasing\_ldl\_level/](https://old.reddit.com/r/Cholesterol/comments/1m8anxf/bulking_as_a_skinny_guy_with_increasing_ldl_level/)



So I (41) had made the post above 3 months back following my dad's MI and after my lipid profile showed an elevated level of LDL. At the time my levels were: LDL 125, Total chol - 180, HDL - 44, Trigycerides - 75 and Blood sugar (fasting) - 90, all figures in mg/DL.



For 3 months, I was in a strict diet - no egg yolks, occaisonal coffee, no butter, occaisonal junk food, no meat, occaisonal fish (Uric acid 5-6 so being careful), no milk and since the past 1,5 months no dairy at all, not even yogurt (while I used to be a yogurt guy and used to finish a tub of butter a day). Also a huge cut in sugar and carbohydrates. Omega 3 supplements daily 

Add to that 3 workout days/ week. Hill sprint, jump ropes and HIIT only and a few calisthenic workout.



 Literally was eating 1/3rd of what I used to and for a skinny, muscle less guy with BMI less than 20 this was very hard. I know my body would  pay a price but for me a lower sugar + cholesterol was the only goal. So I quit the secondary goal of bulking.



Results today (image attached):

Total cholesterol: 98 

LDL: 47 (Just WOW)

VLDL: 15

HDL: 36 (I'm surprised that this didn't increase despite the dietary restriction and regular HIIT)

Triglyceride: 76 (no change)

Blood Sugar fasting: 72 (from 90, so very low risk now although my dad being a diabetic)



The costs:

1. My face has aged significantly in these 3 months. Wrinkles visible. I don't know if it's due to stress or nutritional deficiency. More than 4 people have remarked that I look very frail and a few people have told I look at least 10 years older than my age. Everyone's asking - ""what happened to you?"" as if I was sick. But I would want to reply that I was never healthier before. 



2. Decreased strength: Despite 3 times HIITish exercises  per week,   like hill spring and jump rope, I feel I have gotten a bit weaker. Feel like overall strength has diminished. Cannot move things as easily. It's crazy that I can feel this in 3 months.



3. Less sleep: Very noticeable (average 6-7 hours to only 4-5 hours) but maybe due to work and family stress as well.



4. Question of sustainability: I know the current restriction is not sustainable and I need to resume eating normally at some point. My fear is if my blood sugar and cholesterol levels will start increasing once I start eating the things that I quit during these 3 months.



5. Lower HDL: Below 40 is said to be problematic for heart disease. So it's kinda ironic 



Forgot to mention I had a Lipoprotein check 2 months back and the results showed that the level was way below the lower limit.



Any advice on the next strategy?

Tinamad na mag pix

As I wanted to try out my new gaiwan how it would perform, I chose a ripe puerh to start it's maiden voyage.

Definitely feels like glass with white dye to make it look like white jade. Lesser amount of tea as it is apparently smaller than my previous gaiwan

Onto the tea

Weighed the cube without the wrapper and it came out to 5.7 grams

Washed / rinsed it of course.

My nose is working again today. About as well as the time I tried the white tea last time.

First steep, Wala mashadong lasa. I could only get black tea notes. Floral scents. Mabangong black tea. That type of smell.

Second steep, I was getting dark roasted black coffee notes, wood, leather

Third steep, I was getting hints of dark chocolate, less coffee notes, still wood, still leather

Fourth, same same lang sa third with slightly less of it. Steeped it pretty fast. Tinigil ko na coz I wanna sleep tonight. 

Mabango, if you like drinking black coffee you might be into this. Just that less of that coffee hit as it's of course less in caffeine. This stuff is stronger than oolong in caffeine, stronger than white, stronger than green. Ripe puerh talaga isn't my thing. 

I guess it's pretty sure na, I want green and oolong. But I will try the stuff I have coz shempre sayang. 

I know my storage sucks, but it's cheap puer, like who cares? Lol. Most of my stuff stored in sealed containers tapos naka zip lock pa. ",3,1762334035.0,tsaaph,1,1.0,False
1ooy68y,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ooy68y,Atelier Playa Mujeres Review (Updated 2025),"I wanted to share a full, honest review of Atelier Playa Mujeres, based on my stay there with my wife this past September.

We spent almost a week at the resort, explored every corner, tried all the restaurants we could, and really took the time to see what makes this place special and where it could improve a bit.

# What’s the vibe & where it is

* Located in the Playa Mujeres / Costa Mujeres zone (north of the busy Hotel Zone) so you get beach + resort luxury without the nonstop hustle of central Cancun.  
* The grounds are modern, stylish, and well-maintained. Reviewers in 2025 nodded to spacious suites,high-end amenities, and service that’s noticeably above typical all-inclusives.
* For pool/beach time you’ve got major perks: for example, there’s a huge main pool with swim-up bars, Bali beds, and a more relaxed pool area for chill mode.

# Rooms + experience

* Suites are spacious, modern, and well configured. For Inspira-level or swim-out suites, you’ll get extras like snack cart, upgraded bar cart, and very private patio/pool access.
* Service gets good marks: butlers, attentive staff, and many guests said they felt cared for.
* Location wise: being slightly outside the main Hotel Zone gives you more space and calm. but also means slightly longer airport/transport times (worth knowing). 

We stayed in the Inspira Swim Out Suite, and honestly, that room made the trip for us.  
It’s super modern with direct access to the pool right from your terrace.  
Every morning we’d grab a coffee, step straight into the water, and start the day slow.

The service across the resort was one of the best we’ve experienced in Mexico.  
Everyone, from the front desk to the pool servers, treated us like we were the only guests there.  
The staff genuinely care. it doesn’t feel forced. room service was quick, and the minibar was always restocked with real bottles and snacks.  
I can confidently say the hospitality here is top-notch and one of the resort’s strongest points.

# Food & restaurants

One of the biggest stand-outs at Atelier is the dining. They’ve got 13 restaurants (plus 2 coffee spots) and 12 bars.

Here are some of the top eateries and what you should try so you’re not guessing when you arrive:

1. María Dolores by Edgar Nuñez

My recommendations:

Beef Wellington special (if available)

Dish to try: A seasonal Mexican-luxury plate and corn souffle was great too.

* This is the “top end” fine-dining spot on property - dress code resort elegant, and guests staying 7+ nights often get a complimentary dinner here 



1. Kopai (Japanese / sushi bar style)

My recommendations:

Trio of sashimi + nigiri (reviewers loved this)

Banana rolls dessert (thin plantains + cream cheese)

# 

1. Takeshi (Asian fusion):  One of the better Asian restaurants I’ve tried in an all-inclusive.

My recommendations:

Salmon tartare or tuna tataki roll

Chicken Tikka Masala entrée (bone-in)

The salmon tataki roll and shrimp tempura were both excellent  
  


1. Cilento (Italian)

My recommendations:

Lobster fusilli

Limoncello dessert or seafood risotto



1. Breakfast at *Mercado 19* deserves a quick mention too,  tons of variety.

# Pools, Bars & Activities

The pool setup at Atelier is one of its biggest wins.  
There’s a lively pool with a swim-up bar, and another quieter one closer to the beach.  
Service at both was great, we never waited more than a minute for a drink.

If you’re into cocktails, make sure to stop by El Cielo Beach Bar.  
The Frozen Mezcal Passion is very good.

We also tried a few of the resort activities - there’s morning yoga by the water, cooking demos, and some evening shows.  
They keep it elegant. no wild foam parties or loud chaos.

The NUUP Spa is another highlight, the hydrotherapy circuit is huge and absolutely worth booking for a couple of hours.

When we were there, my wife and I ended up spending most of our time by the beachside pool near El Cielo.  
It had the perfect balance of energy and calm. just music, great service, and ocean views all day long.

# Who this is best for & some tips

Best for:

* Couples or singles looking for an upscale adults-only vibe.  
* Foodies who care about more than just “big buffet & unlimited drinks”.  
* Travelers who appreciate style, service, and are OK with being a little outside the busiest zones.  

Maybe less ideal if:

* You want non stop action, nightclub level crowds, or maximum “town vibe”.  
* You’re trying to save major money and don’t care much about premium food & drink upgrades.
*   

Tips:

* Make dinner reservations early (especially for the table service restaurants) - top spots like Kopai/Takeshi book fast.  
* Ask about upgrade options (swim-out suites, rooftop suites) if your budget allows - they elevate the experience.  
* Pack something nice for dining nights - “resort elegant” came up for some venues.  
* If you want calm, request rooms away from the main pool or higher floors. If you like vibe, go closer to the hub. one review had specific building/room guidance.[ ](https://carloseats.com/2024/05/17/review-atelier-playa-mujeres-a-beautiful-escape-with-room-for-improvement/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

# What Could Be Better

Nothing major, but a few small things worth knowing:

* The resort is in a quieter area, so it’s not ideal if you want to walk around town or explore off-property.  
* The beach is nice, but the water isn’t as turquoise as the Hotel Zone. still beautiful, just a little less postcard perfect.  
* Prices have gone up a bit since last year, but for the level of service and food, it’s fair.



# Final Thoughts

If I were booking one place today and had the budget, Atelier Playa Mujeres would be near the top of my list. It delivers on “luxury all-inclusive” in 2025, especially if you care about food, style, and adults-only comfort. Yes, it’s a little pricier and a little further out than some of the cheaper resorts, but for what you get, it’s worth it.

I had to get the tractor running—it kept stalling like an old timer trying to remember where he left his keys. My goal was simple: get down to the lower forty and finish planting the winter wheat before the rain hit. I grabbed my coffee. Couldn't find my keys, which was Stereo Madness first thing.

​I finally got the old pickup truck going, the engine roaring like a dragon with a sore throat. I was doing pretty good on the dirt road, keeping Back On Track until I hit that big pothole by the old oak. That spot is always tricky. It felt like I was driving through a blizzard, a total Polargeist experience. My coffee, naturally, went flying.

​It landed on the passenger seat, leaving a stain that was already beginning to Dry Out. I pulled over to clean it up. That's when I saw it. Just off the side of the road, in the field, was a perfect cube of glowing, iridescent blue light, just floating there. It looked like the foundation for something big, maybe a whole Base After Base for something unknown. I couldn't take my eyes off it. This thing made me just Can't Let Go of the steering wheel.

​I figured I must be tired. The air around the cube felt heavy, almost vibrating. I felt like a Jumper from a plane, staring down at the clouds. I looked at my watch. It was already past 8 AM. Where had the Time Machine of the morning gone? Lost, I guess, in the static hum. The kids would call this phenomenon the natural Cycles of the universe, but I knew better. I got out of the truck, taking only five xSteps toward the light before pausing.
​It was getting windy, and the wind chimes on the porch of the deserted farmhouse across the way were ringing a frantic Clutterfunk song. I tried to apply the Theory of Everything I learned in college to explain the light, but nothing fit. It was pure, unadulterated alien energy. It was electrifying, like a sudden Electroman Adventures experience.

​I thought about calling the police, but explaining a floating blue cube on the way to plant wheat? That's a true Clubstep of a conversation. Instead, I decided to go back to my Electrodynamix duties and focus on the farm. But as I turned, I saw that the light was changing shape, now forming six sides—a perfect Hexagon Force. I figured the entire trip was going to be a Blast Processing failure anyway, so why not investigate? This whole day was starting to feel like the sequel to a movie, maybe Theory of Everything 2.

​Suddenly, a dog ran across the road, chased by what looked like a perfectly Geometrical Dominator shape of a cloud. This was going to drive me Deadlocked crazy. I just had to take a Fingerdash swipe at the air, hoping to clear my head. The truck was fine, I was fine. It was all a Dash of nonsense. My stomach grumbled. I hadn't had breakfast. Maybe this was all part of The Challenge of getting older. I should probably just Electrify the mood with some good music. No, wait, I need to focus. I looked up at the light, which was now shooting beams high into the sky, beams that seemed to stretch out for Eons. I shook my head, got back into the truck, and decided this was how great Explorers started out. Time to plant some wheat.

We support small and medium producers who make regional products that represent their area. We are mainly looking for shelf-stable foods such as nuts, spices, tea, coffee, dried products, jams, oils or something similar. No dairy or meat products. It is also completely fine if the producer delivers in larger quantities. We handle repackaging and logistics ourselves. In our packaging, the name of the producer and the origin of the product are always shown prominently. The producer is the main brand, Fernmarkt stays in the background.

If you know a small or medium producer from your city who makes unique regional products, we would be very grateful for a recommendation. A name, a link or any way to contact them is enough. You can comment here or send a DM.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Portland Trail Blazers: A Tale of Two Ballparks (One’s a Parking Lot)**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a clash of titans—or, more accurately, a clash of *one* titan (Oklahoma City) and a team in Portland that’s currently fielding more G League hopefuls than an open tryout. The Thunder, fresh off a 7-0 start that’s making the Western Conference sweat in their boots, roll into Portland as a 4.5-point favorite. The Trail Blazers? They’re playing 2025 NBA basketball while simultaneously auditioning for a reality show called *Marathon: The Game*. Let’s break it down.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why the Thunder Are the NBA’s Version of a 100% Refund

The Thunder’s implied probability of winning this game? A staggering **68.5%** (per DraftKings’ 1.46 odds). For context, that’s the same confidence level you have that your morning coffee will eventually hit your stomach. Portland’s 35.7% chance? That’s the same odds as your Uncle Bob remembering to bring his own cup to Starbucks.

Why the gulf? The Thunder are a well-oiled machine: last season, they averaged **26.9 assists per game** while shooting a clean 44.6% from the field. They’re the NBA’s version of a spreadsheet that balances itself. The Blazers? They’re the spreadsheet that crashed when you clicked “print.” Last season, they allowed **113.9 points per game** and shot a pedestrian 47.1% from the field. Defense? Portland’s rim protectors are about as imposing as a yoga instructor on a trampoline.

---

### Injury Montage: Portland’s Roster vs. a Jenga Tower in a Tornado

Let’s talk about the Trail Blazers’ injuries—because this team is currently playing with one hand tied behind its back (and that hand is in a cast). **Damian Lillard** is out for the season with an Achilles injury, which is like losing your team’s quarterback and their personal trainer. Add in **Scoot Henderson** (hamstring), **Matisse Thybulle** (thumb), **Blake Wesley** (foot), and **Shaedon Sharpe** (calf), and it’s a medical ward masquerading as an NBA roster.

I’m a 30 year-old female, working full time and based here in Christchurch. I’m really into fitness, the outdoors, wellness, mindfulness (anything that involves good energy and meaningful connection). 

I’ve found online dating a bit too shallow for me, so I thought I’d try something different and see if anyone here is on a similar wavelength. Would love to make some genuine connections maybe go for a hike, grab a coffee, or just chat about life and wellbeing.

-best places for dinner 
-best dessert/chocolate/cookie places

-Daily Bread for coffee 
-Giapo for dessert
-Moustache cookies for dessert (delivery)
-Lilian (in Grey Lynn) for dinner

Will try to summarise as best as I can. A bit of back story,I have a history of abuse; I was in an emotionally abusive relationship for a few years and tactics like the silent treatment and stonewalling was a big part of it. My ex used to do this as a form of ‘punishment’ for things he perceived I was doing wrong, without actually telling me what he was upset about. As per, this is now something that really triggers me and it’s not something I can put up with. Since then; I have found an amazing partner and he is amazing, supportive and I’m in the happiest relationship of my life. Me and my best friend have been friends since we were little kids, we are now in our mid 20s. We also live together, myself, her and my partner and we are all friends. We’ve lived together for the past 3 years and things have been fine for the most part. I have noticed however that my best friend has a very nasty habit of having very unpredictable moods. The past few weeks she has been spamming me with instagram posts and TikTok’s, messages telling me about her day etc , hanging out with me, inviting me to go get coffee with her and just generally being very upbeat and lovely to be around. Yesterday, she went silent on me. She has left all my messages on seen and did not speak to me when it was me and her at home. She reluctantly said hi and then when I asked if she was okay, because I could tell her mood was off she rudely responded with ‘yeah: why wouldn’t I be’. Then stormed off to her room. Now, people are 100% allowed to have their moods and feelings, they’re also allowed to be in a bad mood. I feel like it is unfair when she projects like this. She has done this to me before where she refused to speak to me for 2/3 weeks and when I finally drilled her on it she told me it was because I disagreed with her about something? As if I’m not allowed to have my opinions on things. I genuinely don’t know what it could be this time around. I don’t know what I’ve done and don’t know why I deserve this type of treatment. The only thing I can think of is that she’s upset because I knocked on the bathroom door (we have 1 bathroom) in the morning and said I’ll need to use it soon because I have to get ready for work. But…. Surely that doesn’t justify silent treatment. Whatever it is, it’s massively triggering for me and makes me super anxious. I don’t feel like coming home because even seeing her when she’s in that state gives me severe anxiety. ",1,1762333030.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

I'm posting this from a corner in Lower North Philadelphia. I know there are countless others out there right now feeling exactly what I am: exhaustion, despair, and the crushing weight of believing that things will never get better.

I want to talk to those of you who are losing hope, because I've been sliding down that slope myself lately.

# My Story Isn't Unique, But Maybe It Can Help

Just a few months ago, I was doing well. I had a job, an apartment, a routine - a *life*. Then, something happened (I won't go into details, but life threw a massive curveball) and everything imploded. Fast. One moment you're planning your week, the next you're staring at the bottom of a backpack and realizing this is it. The speed at which you can lose everything is terrifying.

If you're like me, you're probably thinking: ""I was stable once, so this failure must be all my fault.""

That is a lie**.** It's the exhaustion talking. It is the cold and the hunger and the endless noise drowning out the truth.

# My Advice, From Where I Stand Right Now

If you are losing hope right now, please read this. This is what I have to tell myself every single morning:

* **The Loss Is Real, and It Hurts:** Don't tell yourself to 'just get over it.' You lost a life you worked for, and you have every right to grieve. Acknowledge the pain. That acceptance is the first act of self-care.
* **Find One Small Anchor:** Hope isn't some grand plan right now. It's too big. Your only job today is to find one small anchor**.** Maybe it's a library, a shelter with good coffee, or a volunteer who smiles at you. Just one reliable, small, good thing. Hold onto it.
* **Talk About the Good Before the Bad:** When you talk to outreach workers or volunteers, it is easy to just list your problems. Try this: start with one small success from the past week. ""I managed to stay dry all night,"" or ""I finally got new socks."" Remind yourself and others that you are capable of small wins.
* **Don't Isolate Completely:** The urge to hide is strong. Fight it. Even just being in a public, safe space (like a food court or a park with others) can help stop the mind from spiraling. See other people living their lives. It's a reminder that life is still out there.
* **Remember Who You Were:** The person who was ""doing well"" is still inside you. The skills, the intelligence, the resilience—they didn't evaporate. They're just buried under a lot of dirt right now.

**I don't know what tomorrow holds. But I know that if I give up hope today, I guarantee tomorrow will be worse.**

If you're out here in Philly or anywhere else and reading this, please know you are not a failure**.** You are a person who went through something catastrophic. You deserve to be seen, and you deserve a chance to rebuild.

Here’s how you can take back control of your life,"Everyone's talking about dopamine detoxes and how modern life is frying our brains. And yeah, there's truth to that. I’ve been trying to rebuild better habits myself and I’ve even been checking out [r/soothfy](https://www.reddit.com/r/soothfy/) here and there since people share simple daily routines that actually feel doable in real life.

But what nobody tells you is: dopamine isn’t the problem, it’s how you’re using it.

Your brain's reward system is actually your best tool for building habits. You just need to stop fighting it and start working with it.

How dopamine actually works (simple version):

Dopamine is anticipation. It's what makes you want to do something, not what makes you enjoy it.

When you get a dopamine hit from scrolling, your brain is predicting a reward. You keep scrolling because your brain keeps expecting the next post to be good.

You can hijack this same system to make good habits addictive.

How to use dopamine to build habits:

Make the reward immediate and visible  
Let’s say you work out today, but the results show up in 3 months. Your brain sees no reward, so it doesn't want to repeat the behavior. To fix this create immediate micro-rewards. Check off a box, move a marble to a “done” jar, give yourself a literal gold star. Sounds childish, but your brain loves it. Dopamine responds to immediate feedback. Visual progress = dopamine hit = want to do it again tomorrow.

Stack boring habits before things you actually want  
Make your bed, then check your phone  
Do 10 pushups, then have coffee  
Read one page, then watch Netflix  
Your brain starts associating the boring habit with the upcoming reward. Eventually, starting the boring habit itself triggers dopamine.

Track weekly wins, not perfect streaks  
Breaking a streak feels like failure, so you give up entirely. Instead of tracking streaks, track how many times you do something per week. You still get the dopamine from progress without the all-or-nothing pressure that makes you quit.

Celebrate the start, not just the finish  
Put on gym clothes is a win. Opening the book is success. If the start feels good, your brain will crave starting more often.

Make it satisfying, not just productive  
If you hate the habit, your brain will avoid it forever. Find the version that feels good now, not someday in the future.

Use temptation bundling  
Only listen to your favorite podcast while exercising  
Only watch your show while meal prepping  
Only have that nice coffee while working on your side project  
Your brain will start craving the hard habit because it leads to something enjoyable.

Your brain is designed to repeat behaviors that feel rewarding. If your habits don’t feel rewarding, your brain won’t want to repeat them.

• give the camera app some extra oomph by adding a ""photo album"" where you can view pictures taken in game

• be able to edit picture frames with our own island photos >:O

• allow expansion of interiors of villagers' homes

• MORE ANGLES FOR FURNITURE. let me place my wardrobe at a 45° angle off the wall dangit !!!

• planting on top of custom designs 🙄

• more slots for custom codes

• grid terraforming!?! i know that they updated the animation to make it a little more obvious which square of plot you're editing but i would LOVE a zoomed-out view of the area you're working in like in the cleanup feature of the construction app. and you could simply click the cliffs and water to add or destroy them the same way you can edit trees in paradise planning, but with terraforming. the sheer amount of time we've all WASTED watching our little pixel people smash cliffs and dig for water is simply... too much.

• a ""shopping cart"" in able sisters where you can buy clothes and then continue shopping in the fitting room without having to keep going in and out omg wow what an idea

• i know they added the feature of the hotel where you can help ""work"" for them there, but hear me out. also being able to get a part time job at the roost as a barista and learn different coffee recipes.

i'm sure i have more but this is already ridiculously outrageously long ok tell me yours thanks so much byeee ✨✨

I've been working from home full-time, and to be honest, I'm starting to get pretty bored and feel a bit stuck in the house.

I'm looking to get out and work from a different place a few times a week, just to get a change of scenery.

The problem is, my local bar has terrible WiFi, and a full-time coworking membership isn't really in my budget right now.

I'd love to hear your recommendations! What are your favourite:
 * Cafes that are laptop-friendly and have reliable WiFi? (Good coffee is a huge plus!)
 * Libraries (like Muntpunt or KBR) that are good for getting focused work done?
 * Any other ""hidden gems"" or public spots you like to use?

Just trying to build a small ""circuit"" of places to rotate through.

Thanks so much for any tips!

1ooxlat,https://www.reddit.com/r/generativeAI/comments/1ooxlat/tested_an_ai_agent_on_8_client_projects_and_my/,tested an AI agent on 8 client projects and my workflow got way more consistent without trying,"project 1 took 3 rounds of feedback. project 8 was right on first try. same warm colors, same clean layouts, same fonts I always pick. didn't realize I was building a system.

I do branding for small businesses. restaurants, cafes, barber shops. started using an AI agent 3 months ago. didn't expect it to change how I work.

here's what happened (picked a few key projects to show the pattern):

project 1 (pizza place, august) gave it brand story, target customers, vibe. first results were all over the place. too modern, too retro, wrong colors. took 3 rounds to get something usable.

normal. that's how tools work.

project 3 (coffee shop, september) same process. but first batch was way closer to what I wanted. clean layout, warm colors. I didn't specify that this time. thought maybe coincidence.

project 5 (barber shop, october) barely had to correct anything. first attempt was 80% there. warm palette, minimal layout, clean typography. exactly my style.

I never explicitly set rules like ""always use warm colors"" or ""keep it minimal."" but the agent saves your brand assets. so when I kept using similar palettes across projects, it started suggesting them. kind of like it was tracking my patterns.

project 8 (seafood restaurant, last week) described the concept. hit generate. result looked like something I would've made. client said ""this is so your style"" and I'm like... yeah but I barely touched it.

the numbers:

* project 1: 3 rounds of feedback, 4 hours total
* project 8: basically first try, 20 minutes total
* consistency: went from 60% match to 95% match

what's weird is the consistency across different projects. the agent has this workspace thing where it saves your brand assets. so when I kept approving similar warm palettes, it started suggesting them for new projects. not copying one brand to another, more like it was tracking my personal preferences. I was building a style library without realizing it.

could be I'm just getting better at using the tool. could be the brand archive feature doing its thing. but the workflow definitely got smoother.

the point is: if AI helps you systematize your style and execute it faster, what's the designer's role?

I'm still making final calls. still guiding direction. but the execution part that used to take hours? AI does it now. in my style. faster than me.

tool I used: X-Design. the agent feature has this brand workspace that keeps everything consistent.

question for anyone who's tried similar stuff: does this excite you or freak you out? cause I'm both.

if you've noticed your workflow getting more systematic with AI tools, drop a comment. curious if this is common or just me.",3,1762331745.0,generativeAI,2,1.0,False

Let’s say you work out today, but the results show up in 3 months. Your brain sees no reward, so it doesn't want to repeat the behavior. To fix this create immediate micro-rewards. Check off a box, move a marble to a “done” jar, give yourself a literal gold star. Sounds childish, but your brain loves it. Dopamine responds to immediate feedback. Visual progress = dopamine hit = want to do it again tomorrow.

Stack boring habits before things you actually want  
Make your bed, then check your phone  
Do 10 pushups, then have coffee  
Read one page, then watch Netflix  
Your brain starts associating the boring habit with the upcoming reward. Eventually, starting the boring habit itself triggers dopamine.

Track weekly wins, not perfect streaks  
Breaking a streak feels like failure, so you give up entirely. Instead of tracking streaks, track how many times you do something per week. You still get the dopamine from progress without the all-or-nothing pressure that makes you quit.

Celebrate the start, not just the finish  
Put on gym clothes is a win. Opening the book is success. If the start feels good, your brain will crave starting more often.

Make it satisfying, not just productive  
If you hate the habit, your brain will avoid it forever. Find the version that feels good now, not someday in the future.

Use temptation bundling  
Only listen to your favorite podcast while exercising  
Only watch your show while meal prepping  
Only have that nice coffee while working on your side project  
Your brain will start craving the hard habit because it leads to something enjoyable.

Your brain is designed to repeat behaviors that feel rewarding. If your habits don’t feel rewarding, your brain won’t want to repeat them.

1ooxkcd,https://www.reddit.com/r/sailing/comments/1ooxkcd/cast_away_in_the_netherlands_sailor_survives/,Cast away in the Netherlands: Sailor survives without food or water on uninhabited island.,"A man was rescued on Sunday after spending two days on an uninhabited island in the IJsselmeer. He had gone sailing on Friday when his boat drifted onto the rocks near De Kreupel, an island east of Medemblik in Noord-Holland, and partially sank. He was eventually rescued by a lifeboat crew.

The man’s phone had died after the anchor came loose, causing the vessel to be blown onto the rocks. He had no other means of contacting the outside world. It was very quiet on the water due to the bad weather, which led to the man having to survive for two days without food or water before being found. He had made a tent out of the sails of his boat.

He later expressed his relief at being found by rescuers from the Royal Netherlands Sea Rescue Institution (KNRM) in Andijk, saying he had feared he might die on the island.

“We came across a partially submerged sailboat resting on the island’s rocks,” a KNRM spokesperson told [NOS](https://nos.nl/artikel/2589165-man-zit-na-schipbreuk-ruim-twee-dagen-vast-op-onbewoond-eiland-in-ijsselmeer). “Next to it stood the man beside a small, self-built tent.” The man was weak but otherwise in reasonable condition. He was given coffee, a shower, and dry clothes by the KNRM.

The KNRM stressed the importance of always carrying a radio, mobile phone, or emergency flares on board. The man’s yacht was beyond repair and was recovered by Rijkswaterstaat

Hey travel pals! I’ve put together five **Europe Trip Ideas** that fit neatly into 7 days without living on trains. Clean transfers, two to three bases per trip, and plenty of time for long lunches and sunset wanders. If you want the full deep dive, I’ve written it up here: [**Europe Trip Ideas: 5 unforgettable 7-day routes**](https://thetraveltinker.com/inspiration/europe-trip-ideas/). You can also find more guides and itineraries on [**TheTravelTinker.com**](https://thetraveltinker.com/).

# TL;DR

* Italy triangle by train for icons and easy logistics
* Norway scenic rails for fjords and big views
* Central Europe trio for cafés, culture, and value

*Costs shown are rough daily ranges per person in £, €, and $.*

# 1) Classic Italy: Rome → Florence → Venice

**Good to know:** Pack light for ferry boarding, and grab early departures to bank a proper beach day.

# When to go in 2026

* **April to early June** for soft light and easy temps
* **September to mid-October** for warm seas in Greece and Croatia
* **Late May to early September** for Norway when services and daylight are strongest

**Tinker’s Tip:** Check city event calendars. A marathon or festival can push prices up, yet it can gift you the best street vibe of your trip.

# Getting around, quickly

* Trains for Italy and Central Europe, book earlier services for calm afternoons
* Scenic rail plus ferries in Norway
* Morning ferries in Greece and Croatia, add one buffer night before your flight home
* For cities, day transit passes if you will ride more than three times in a day

# Light packing list that actually works

* 35–40L carry-on, soft daypack, packing cubes
* 3 tops, 2 bottoms, 1 warm layer, swimwear, mid-week rinse
* Two comfy pairs of shoes, rotate daily
* Travel-size toiletries, SPF, universal adaptor, power bank, offline maps
* Tiny “oh-no kit” with electrolytes, plasters, pain relief, any personal meds",1,1762331598.0,TravelRelated,0,1.0,False

I’ve been trying to rebuild better habits myself and I’ve even been checking out **Soothfy** here and there since people share simple daily routines that actually feel doable in real life.

But what nobody tells you is: dopamine isn’t the problem, it’s how you’re using it.

Your brain's reward system is actually your best tool for building habits. You just need to stop fighting it and start working with it.

How dopamine actually works (simple version):

Dopamine is anticipation. It's what makes you want to do something, not what makes you enjoy it.

When you get a dopamine hit from scrolling, your brain is predicting a reward. You keep scrolling because your brain keeps expecting the next post to be good.

You can hijack this same system to make good habits addictive.

I’m no expert on coffee but have been craving the taste but under doctors orders i can only have decaf. I tried an Iced Americano with Oatmilk after a quick skim of reddit & it was really good - got the coffee taste without a ton of caffeine. I finally learned how Americano is made and it makes sense that it is a bit watery. I’m trying to make it a little creamier and wondering what is the best way to order it? I usually stay away from dairy as a preference but wondering if i need something thicker like cream to make it a bit creamier or if anyone orders it any other way?

I’m 19, exist mostly on black coffee and late-night music, and I can’t seem to decide if I’m supposed to be a mysterious raven-haired goth or a chaotic ginger dream. So yeah, I switch between black and copper hair like it’s a personality trait 😅

I’ve always been that “weird art kid” — the one drawing creepy cute stuff in the back row with smudged eyeliner and headphones blasting songs that sound like poetry for broken people. Never really felt like I fit in, but I grew into it. I kinda love being the odd one out now.

I’m not really into small talk. I like real connection, shadowy stories, and people who aren’t scared of messy feelings or the darker side of life. I might look intimidating, but honestly, I’m just a soft lil disaster with tattoos and too many feelings.

In my free time, I’m either thrifting weird clothes, watching old horror movies for the aesthetic, changing my hair (again), or making playlists that feel like haunted fairytales. Also — if I see a cat, I will stop and become its friend. No exception.

If you vibe with moody playlists, vintage lace, the smell of incense, and low-key chaotic energy… we’ll get along just fine. 🦇",1,1762331422.0,u_Sadiebubblyy,0,1.0,False

1ooxd8v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Habits/comments/1ooxd8v/youre_not_lazy_youre_overstimulated_heres_how_you/,You’re not lazy. You’re overstimulated. Here’s how you can take back control of your life,"Everyone's talking about dopamine detoxes and how modern life is frying our brains. And yeah, there's truth to that. I’ve been trying to rebuild better habits myself and I’ve even been checking out [r/soothfy](https://www.reddit.com/r/soothfy/) here and there since people share simple daily routines that actually feel doable in real life.

But what nobody tells you is: dopamine isn’t the problem, it’s how you’re using it.

Your brain's reward system is actually your best tool for building habits. You just need to stop fighting it and start working with it.

How dopamine actually works (simple version):

Dopamine is anticipation. It's what makes you want to do something, not what makes you enjoy it.

When you get a dopamine hit from scrolling, your brain is predicting a reward. You keep scrolling because your brain keeps expecting the next post to be good.

You can hijack this same system to make good habits addictive.

How to use dopamine to build habits:

Make the reward immediate and visible  
Let’s say you work out today, but the results show up in 3 months. Your brain sees no reward, so it doesn't want to repeat the behavior. To fix this create immediate micro-rewards. Check off a box, move a marble to a “done” jar, give yourself a literal gold star. Sounds childish, but your brain loves it. Dopamine responds to immediate feedback. Visual progress = dopamine hit = want to do it again tomorrow.

Stack boring habits before things you actually want  
Make your bed, then check your phone  
Do 10 pushups, then have coffee  
Read one page, then watch Netflix  
Your brain starts associating the boring habit with the upcoming reward. Eventually, starting the boring habit itself triggers dopamine.

Track weekly wins, not perfect streaks  
Breaking a streak feels like failure, so you give up entirely. Instead of tracking streaks, track how many times you do something per week. You still get the dopamine from progress without the all-or-nothing pressure that makes you quit.

Celebrate the start, not just the finish  
Put on gym clothes is a win. Opening the book is success. If the start feels good, your brain will crave starting more often.

Make it satisfying, not just productive  
If you hate the habit, your brain will avoid it forever. Find the version that feels good now, not someday in the future.

Use temptation bundling  
Only listen to your favorite podcast while exercising  
Only watch your show while meal prepping  
Only have that nice coffee while working on your side project  
Your brain will start craving the hard habit because it leads to something enjoyable.

Your brain is designed to repeat behaviors that feel rewarding. If your habits don’t feel rewarding, your brain won’t want to repeat them.

End of July my partner moved out, and wasn't sure on our relationship. She had indecision through till beginning of September, I was left in limbo but still all in, as the issues were complicated but no one had done anything wrong.But it went on too long and I decided I was done with the indecision/hot and cold behaviour and ended it. We had kept in touch this whole period and we met frequently to talk. I had been having therapy, felt very secure and really good in myself. 

Roughly, End of September we reconciled, she took full accountability for her part, we had very honest conversations about everything. Made great strides to start creating a better relationship. 19th of October, she became overwhelmed and feared engulfment. Started requesting space which was absolutely fine.  I didn't see or speak to her till the 27th of October, we met briefly in a coffee shop where she told me she wasn't happy, she was very anxious and had been spiralling all the time we had no contact. She had to leave because she was overwhelmed.  Later that evening I sent her a message saying I understood she was in turmoil and confused, and I thought it was best I step away and take the pressure off. 

She said she would be in touch when she felt better and hoped I would still want to talk then. I haven't heard from her still, I messaged Friday to touch base and say I would be willing to talk and I hope she's okay. 

I'm struggling in this limbo (again), as everything has been so fractious and I want to either meet to wrap things up or see where she's at. She may be thinking the same I don't know. I still have lots of her stuff in my home, I'm talking boxes of things.   I think because I've spent the best part of this year not knowing where my relationship is at, I've really not got much patience left. Currently crafting a message to send today to ask how she is and say I'd like to meet soon, but I don't know if I'm just being anxious or if that's coming from a reasonable place :(
