A couple hours left to sign up for the random drawing! Don't need to deposit anything as a 'hold' unless and until your name is drawn! Scared about the swim? Don't be, you have plenty of time! I went from being awful to being, well I guess just, not so awful in just a few months, and finishing the swim and staying comfortable.

I posted a little bit months ago about this race, and wanted to do a little race report for it - with it being the first, I got kind of excited about it (despite the months-long delay in posting), and understand it's a ""bucket list"" type race for many folks.

Not sure why TLDR versions always seem to end up at the end. Saving you the trouble of scrolling so you can just read it here. I tried to otherwise section off the post if certain subjects may be of interest. Although this shortened version is in itself probably too long. Apologies, I'm quite verbose.

I'll begin with my end question - are there any other 'bucket list' races? Doesn't need to be triathlon specific, just unique in the type of sport/exercise, or unique type of venue, fun historical facts, etc. I'm located in southeastern US, so ideally not too far, but willing to travel as I assume it would make a cool vacation as well!

TLDR:

Decided to put my name in for Escape, got in on first time! Entered. First triathlon I ever signed up for. They shortened swim which was very frustrating. Might be why the swim was super easy (relative how they talk about it), water not nearly as cold as they make you think. After accounting for what the swim time likely would have been (had it not been shortened), basically finished in line/ahead of my stretch goal, officially coming in just under 3 hours, good for top third of my age group (\~80%ile swim, \~50 bike, \~15 run). Given the swim, and the rest of my relative performance, I don't think it's unreasonable to think I might have passed 1000 people after getting out of the water. The best part was probably with \~2-3 miles left in the run, running the trails through the Presidio, the point where there are maybe 5 steps every little bit, I was in the zone, cooking along (for me), announcing where I'm passing (narrow trail), etc. Normally people didn't respond, until I come up to pass this person and said ""almost done! You're doing so well, keep going!"" and they were ""I know! I'm soo happppyyy!"" The sheer joy with which it was said was incredibly infectious, and that was probably the best/most memorable part of the day/trip (outside of maybe my wife jumping around like an idiot when she found me during the race, and taking a picture together), and I have thought about that maybe every day since the race. It always puts a smile on, sometimes I even tear up a little. So random person if you're out there reading this, hope you're doing well!!

While there is a ton about it that was quite enjoyable, I'm not sure if triathlon will turn into a consistent ""thing"" for me.  Maybe do some sprints, see if I redline so hard I puke by the end. But it was an expensive trip, so it was just my wife and I - so it was a little sad to see others soaking up the environment before/after the race with their kids. That said, was a super fun experience, would 100% do it again (if cost was no issue) and would love to do other 'destination' or 'bucket list' type races, as part of a vacation week for the family, essentially ""defraying"" the cost of the race. What are others? Seems like IM Cozumel might be up there, maybe just for the swim alone. Probably ideally would avoid doing a race where there's a high probability it's at least 80F (27C), but not a dealbreaker. I have always been super fascinated with Mayan civilization/empire, so that's a plus for after. Anything that's either a unique race and or with some neat history tidbits associated (ex. 'escaping' Alcatraz) and or not a typical ""race and fly back home"" thing. IM Lake Placid would be super cool with the Olympic history (also I grew up a couple hours away). Overseas flights (I'm in NC, USA) might be stretching the budget, but typing this out has put our computer overlord data mining programs to work, so I've gotten targeted ads, and Iceland seems like it has cool events given its amazing geographical features, and just saw Ireland has a ""Hardman"" that seems real neat. Doing an Ironman is certainly something I'm entertaining, if for no other reason than a ""hey I've done that"" and can check it off the (imaginary as of yet) bucket list. Doesn't have to be a triathlon, I did the ""Over/Under biathlon"" in Surf City, NC which is a 5k SUP into a 5k run. More obstacle course type 'spartan race' or 'death race' type stuff is cool too.

Dissertation version:

Why Alcatraz? Why as the first?

A few reasons, I had one of those Ironman watches as a young kid (maybe 8 or so?). Don't remember why I got it, but remember looking into WTF an 'Ironman' was (this was early 90s), and was fascinated by how people could finish a race that was that long. Lost it somehow, and found it again maybe 3 or 4 years later (not sure, young kid probably thought it was much longer than in reality) around March time, after the winter's snow has thawed, but the ground was still crazy cold/wet and covered with gross heavy leaves that we didn't remove the prior fall (not sure we ever did it fall :D). Remember being completely amazed that the thing still worked. Don't mind the child-like logic, but I remember thinking ""geez, if the watch can withstand all this time outside, with rains and snow not ruining it, imagine what the Ironman competitors must be like"" ... Weird memory to still have given I just turned 38 a couple months ago. Anyway, I've known this race existed for probably 20+ years, always thought it was a sweet idea, especially given the history behind it, and the 'incredible feat of the human spirit to not get caught' (ignoring the whole felonious aspect of it). I've always been fascinated with stuff like that, DB Cooper, climbing K2/Everest, Amelia Earhart, people swimming the English Channel, etc etc.

As to why it's the first... general consensus is certainly to NOT do it as your first. I found an article (triathlon.com maybe?) that said they were a contrarian and say that we SHOULD do it first, noting the environment, natural beauty of the course, and some other things. Since I'm sure I was specifically trying to fill a need for confirmation bias, I signed up. Was going through some personal issues and was like I need to do something for me that I can focus on, I'll worry about the cost at a later date. Was able to work out the cost bit since I had months to plan and save.

The Training:

So after signing up in October, I kept my normal exercise regimen. Which was typically 3 +-1 workout per week, 'crossfit style' HIIT workouts. Hour long classes. Once I started training for the race, I kept doing it, but it dropped to 1 or 2x a week to allow more SBR specific exercise.

Some minor things I usually do, which I'm sure has a small, but non-zero positive impact on things, is I'm the type of person who'd rather spend 10 seconds finding a parking spot and walk a minute to get into the store, vs spending 3 minutes finding a parking spot to walk 30 seconds. Also is to try to not to use elevators. So when I drove, I'd park on floor 3-5 of parking deck and walk up/down the stairs. I work on floor 3, so I'd walk up/down. Got some benefit at home because there are 2 sets of stairs. Beneficial due to the 'sand ladder' coming off the beach that has a couple hundred stairs.

Same thing with going to the pool/work. Both are 2 miles or less travel one way, so I would try to bike when I could. Just enough to get my heart rate moving and starting to sweat (especially with it often being 90 degrees outside). That added probably 10 miles a week biking. The gym is just over half mile away, so I would run there. Nice warm up before the exercise. Also it was helpful in trying to get muscle memory to my run cadence (trying at least 160). I did not add any of these to my workout logs.

March 10 is when I tested my ""baseline"" time for the bike/run. Went 18 miles bike in 1:31 (12 mph, 1100 ft elevation gain, Alcatraz is 1500 or more?). Ran almost 6.5 miles in just under 58 min (about 9 min/mile). My leg or knee or something started hurting so I cut it short, plus I couldn't get my cadence up higher than 153 (I'm 6' and aim for 160 or 165). So that puts me at a finish around 1 hr swim (assumption), 90 min bike, 72 min run, 15 min transitions (total guess, T1 is a half mile run, take off wetsuit, etc). So just under 4 hours. I knew I'd end up faster than this, but wanted to see what it was like. Had no food, only a little water when I switched from bike to run, and used a shitty hybrid for the bike.

Gave myself 3 goals:

1. Don't drown.
2. Finish the swim before cutoff.
3. Don't use any boats/rafts to rest.

In total, SBR logs:

Looks like 47 total swims logged on Strava, \~2500 or more yards per week (first swim was March 5th)

15 bikes logged, 187 miles (race on April 27 was first after my 'test' March 11)

16 runs logged, 69.5 miles (March 29 first run after the 'test')

SWIM

February rolls around, and I figure I'll need a watch that can do laps, so I can monitor pacing on (most importantly to me) the swim. Enter (again) the Ironman watch. I needed to do a swim baseline, as I knew that would be my 'bottleneck' (if you couldn't tell from my goals :D). I figured getting it done before cutoff would be easy, even given my poor swimming ability. My logic was: Alcatraz island is \~1 mile off shore, and the current is going to push me toward swim exit. If I swim \~1 mile, and the current pushes me \~1 mile, that gives us the \~1.5 mile swim (Thanks Pythagoras!). I figured swimming 1 mile in under 60 minutes is easy, right? I commonly walk at over 3 mph, so surely swimming at 1 mph is simple enough. Especially with a wetsuit with the added buoyancy and hydrodynamics, and salt water which also will add a little buoyancy.

So the watch comes in and so I go to the local pool, and during my kids swim lessons, I thought I'd try out my sea legs (but you ain't got no legs, Lt. Dan!). Anyway it's March 5th, first lap (50y) I did in 1:11! Not bad. But given my breathing after, you'd think I nearly died. Including the rest I took, the next lap was over 2:30. Inclusive of break - I ended up doing a paltry 14 lengths before taking \~10 min break to catch the kids at their swimming lessons. Got back to it, and did 8 more lengths. Outside of the very first lap (50 yards) each time, I didn't get a lap less than \~1:30. 550 yards in 19:25, or 3:31/100 yard pace. So that's over 90 minutes to swim 1.5 miles (of course, conservatively speaking so I will not take into account the wonderful Pythagoras). I'm thinking that it will be tough for me to get myself faster, given when I'm in the middle of the bay I won't be able to hop out of the water to take 10 min break, and I won't have the ends of the pool to rest at, the waves etc in the water are going to be harder to swim in, vs a flat pool, etc etc. I understood front crawl is the fastest stroke, but my front/side/breast were all within a few seconds per 50, so figured I could always switch strokes without sacrificing much time. As (I assume) with most people, breathing was the struggle. Tried 3 separate times, all staying \~3:20-3:30 per 100y, giving me the realization that I needed more help considering I was within 3 months of race at this point.

Enter Masters lessons. I don't know whether I went to the noon or 6am class first, but when I show up to the morning class for the first time, I tell the guy why I'm there, goals, etc. He's like 'great, we have a couple people that have done Alcatraz, and several triathletes here, some are very competitive. Why don't you hop in, lets see you swim 200 yards' (I forget exactly the length).... I get done, and he gives me tips, and I keep going on.  At the end, we are talking and he's like ""I'm not sure you're ready to start here yet"" like I was too bad. Luckily he didn't explicitly say to not come back, so I just kept going. But point being it was further confirmation that I was not any good.

For probably 2 months+ I went 3-5 times per week, usually once on my own. By race time, I was able to get down to \~2:00 or 2:10/100y as an ""all day"" pool pace, going 2 swims per week the last 3-4 weeks until the race. I did 5 OWS beforehand (all with wetsuit), \~300 yards (in an ocean sound), \~2000 yards (laps up and back in river), \~910 meters (800m triathlon lake swim), \~2 miles (should have been 1.7 mile, ocean race swim), \~2200 yards in the Aquatic Park in SF Bay on the Friday before (2640 yards is 1.5 miles, approximate swim length). It wasn't until swimming in the AP did I realize it seems it is most common, that during breaths where you sight: it goes head up to sight, then to the side to breathe, then head back down ... I have been doing head to side to breathe, then up to sight, then down. Whoops. Tried doing it the way most everyone was doing it. No dice, super awkward, not trying to change it the day before the race. Mentioned that bit to my wife after she got in, and she was like ""yeah, duh"" (She swam competitively in HS) like I was Harry Dunne exclaiming ""you've had two pairs of gloves this whole time?!"" to which Lloyd Christmas responds ""Yeah, it's the Rockies.""

BIKE

Outside of work/pool commutes (round trip of <= 4 miles), I didn't ride again until a triathlon April 27 - swim coach told me  about a local one that I signed up for (so, sadly Alcatraz was not actually my ""first""). Looking into this is where I learned that a typical cadence for biking is like 160-200, and I realized I was at maybe \~120. Figured that could probably be a big reason why I couldn't get my run cadence above 150 during the baseline test. Thought that since my run is my best discipline of the three, I'd try to keep the bike cadence the same as the run, and stay at least 160. Intuitively (to me), the muscle memory, etc would help keep my run cadence up. At any rate that tri was nice because it was the first (and only) time I got to ride on a course basically entirely closed to vehicular traffic before Alcatraz. I did that one on my wife's MTB rather than my completely unsafe hybrid, and averaged 14 mph (2 mph higher than my ""baseline""). If you've made it this far, obviously I don't have any of the fancypants power meters or anything like that. Also, this is where it comes to pass that my swim is NOT (any longer) my worst discipline. Yay for tons of swim lessons! I did novice and finished 12/23 (no age group separators). But to 'normalize' (for growth comparison between races), I put my times into age groups (20 total in the age group, I would've finished 17th)... 800m swim I was 14th, 18 miles bike I was 18th, and the 3 mile run would've been 10th. BUT this is when I got a separate goal. My watch indicated I ended up going maybe 25 mph at some point during the race. So I thought to myself... hey this should be significantly less hilly than Alcatraz, I'll be in better shape at Alcatraz, and I wont be using a mountain bike. So, additional goal - get to 40 mph on the bike!

So I started biking more.... ended up popping a tube on my hybrid on the way to work in mid-May, so like any completely logical human, rather than replace the tube for $10 or whatever they cost, I decided it was a better idea to spend \~$700 on a used road bike to take with me (\~2012 Cannondale Synapse 6, full carbon) instead of renting one when I got to SF. Charlotte ReCyclery/Trips for Kids - one of the non profit/charities around town. Try them out if you're local! Anyway, if you read on, this becomes a smart decision. The bike is so much more punchy, fast, and more fun to ride. Which obviously I realized it was going to be, but it was much more noticeable to me than I thought. Also, when I brought it back, my daughter was like ""Daddy you have a cool bike now!"" so that was neat.

I biked outside every time, except I used the Peloton during lunch at work the one day I popped the tube. I ended up popping the tire twice on the new bike before the race. I didn't have a way to accurately know what the pressure was, and I became pretty certain that the bike pump I had was too cheap to hold the pressure the tube needed.

15 bikes logged. 187 miles. I only counted those \~3 miles or longer. There were maybe 10-15 more miles throughout the week, but they were \~1.5-2 mile rides to work/the pool (each way). Maybe 15 minutes max per, 2-3x a week, so those miles were split between maybe 4 or 6 rides. I'm sure they had a non-zero positive impact on performance, but likely nothing notable.

RUN

Really not much notable here. I was not worried about this. I wrestled growing up, D1 in college, so we used to run all the time. 5ks to warm up, however long to lose weight, the (232?)South Side steps to end runs, blah blah. We have a home at the beach, so whenever we went out there, I got a few miles running on the beach. Obviously much harder to run on the sand, but it gave me exposure since Alcatraz has a beach run, maybe half a mile or something. The key for me I felt was doing some bricks so I could get used to wobbly legs, and being able to keep consistent pace, vs going out too fast in the first couple miles. Tried to increase to 165 cadence. Did some stairs during a long bring a week or two before. Just tried to run a little bit of everything. I do have a bad ankle (old injury) that I knew I was going to have surgery on so I really was just focusing on placing the steps intentionally, to help avoid injuring it before/during the race.

The trip, race weekend, etc:

Fly out Th afternoon. I don't remember which flight it was (CLT-STL I think), but the person next to me was also traveling for it, having just done the Chattanooga half (Troy? Hope you crushed both!). So that was neat. Got into town Thursday maybe 6, immediately noticed that TSA got into the bag, and didn't pack it back in how I did, so I was worried it was broken to some extent. Got it together, biked around looking for food. Had to make a couple adjustments, and all seemed well. Didn't know what I wanted to eat, but came across a sign in Chinatown that said ""One of The City's Ten Best Restaurant"" \[sic\] and so I'm not going to NOT eat at a place with a sign like that (Yuet Lee). In a world full of people claiming they're ""the singular best"" this or that, I thought it funny to see something like ""hey, we're pretty good."" Anyway, it was indeed pretty good (and/or I was starving).

Friday rolls around and I wanted to bike around the course, and get a practice swim in. Got to it later than I planned, swam longer than I planned. 2300 yards, 1:53/100y - pretty happy with that. Got out, was real dizzy trying to run up the beach. The fine folks that were watching, mentioned to put in ear plugs, as the colder water in the ears messes your balance. Makes sense, the vestibular system for balance is in the inner ear. I actually had tried the little plastic things before. I fractured by temporal bone many years ago, and my right ear canal is all jacked up and doesn't drain water right, so thought they might help when I first started training for the swim. Tried them and they slipped out almost immediately. Womp. Decided to try again, but got some putty this time. Hoped that would work good enough with the cap around my ear holding it in.

Was able to get to biking around to check the course. Heading out of transition, there was a pretty brutal (again, to me) headwind. I was thinking about how damn cold I'm going to be coming out of the water and on to the bike while still all wet, heading down that road. Noticed the gears kept skipping again. I don't know how the hell barrel adjustors are supposed to work, I twisted them back and forth but could not get anything to change. Annoying. Had to stop to (sponsor alert!) Sports Basement on the way back anyway (ear putty). Spent a couple miles at a fast pace, including up a steep hill. Coming back down the hill after a turn on the course, it opened up to the ocean/bay and a brutal (to me) cross wind that could have definitely knocked me over/into someone, had it been during a race. Mental note taken. Started going at a much slower pace, but still ended up riding I think 23 miles (longest ride to date) over the course of a couple hours. I stopped to check the sand ladder. The stairs are not really 'stairs' nor do they all have consistent separation between them. It looks like they're telephone poles laid across (held in place). They said to walk the sand ladder, and make sure to pull the ropes to help you walk up. I tried pulling a couple, very very slack, and not fun to use. Regardless that the rope will be much more taut with dozens of people pulling, I just made a plan to just crush the sand ladder and burn whatever matches I had left.'

Make it back to Sports Basement, which by the way is a super neat store - at least the one in the Presidio is an old grocery store, and still has some vestiges of it hanging around. Anyway super nice people, super helpful. The tech put it up on the bike thing, and it actually took him a bit to figure it out, which made me feel better about my ignorance. Although old, the bike had been tuned up, so it had new brake lines, fully cleaned up etc. Don't recall what he said the issue was, but it worked better after. It's tricky sometimes to move the chain up to the big gear on the pedal, if it's also on the big gear on the wheel. Whatever no big deal I just won't do that.

They had a 5K shakeout run later that night. I was feeling a bit tired, but I am a major introvert to the point where I sometimes find it problematic. So I went; trying to force myself to be a little more social. Maybe one or two hundred people were there? Anyway I was thinking I could finish the run leg at, or better than 8:15/mi, so I went in with their 8:30 group. Was able to hold a conversation the whole time without breathing too heavy, so I felt pretty decent about breaking 8:15. Definitely was beat, feeling a little more sore than I had hoped for, less than 48 hours from race.

Next morning was more sore, spent the day with the wife, checked in to the race, did the pre-race meeting, where they mentioned that the current was super fast, 3.5 or 4 knots or something? They mentioned possibility of swimming from the 'normal' drop, cancelling the swim, or moving the swim drop to one of two other potential options. But he would make that decision himself that morning. YOU BETTER NOT FUCK WITH THE SWIM THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE! Anyway, we tried In n Out, did the Alcatraz tour. Lots of walking trying to loosen and stretch, turned out to be unsuccessful. Alcatraz tour was super cool even though I didn't get to see everything. Had no idea about the Native American occupation, nor that there was actually more than one attempt at swimming to freedom. Had to take some time to peek about the swim. It was clear, and seemed SO CLOSE. Everyone says that it's always foggy in the morning, and not have the ability to see too far, so I was hoping it might orient me better when in the water. Back early to hopefully get a nice rest and recovery sleep.

RACE DAY!

I stayed at a place in Fisherman's Wharf over a mile away, so I elected to not keep the bike there before, and would ride it in. They were very clear: TRANSITION AREA CLOSES AT 5:15, THE LAST BUS LEAVES AT 5:30, IF YOU DO NOT MAKE IT YOU BETTER FIND A SCOOTER. AND THE BOAT LEAVES AT 6 ON THE DOT. IF YOU ARE NOT ON THE BOAT, YOU ARE NOT RACING, I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE STANDING TEN FEET FROM IT. Transition area opened up at like 3 or some dumb shit. Definitely not about that life, so I got up at maybe 4 to get there maybe 4:30. Legs soreness has not dissipated. Super upset. Oh well can't really fix it now, hopefully the warm up ride and some stretching at transition/the boat will help. Make my coffee with my normal supplement powder (I've been using Muscle Milk for a bit now), put the clothes on, bags, etc., and head out. Figure I wouldn't need but a few minutes to organize my things on the ground. Also wanted to make sure to get to the bike tech to pump up the bike due to my confidence that the tires were likely at least a little low. I get there, and it's a mad house. Lots of people, lots of energy, the environment getting me all amped up, and just pissed in the back of my mind about my damn legs and how stupid it was to ride so far and for so long. That I should've gotten a scooter for a little of the travel over the weekend.

Find my place at transition, all the houses on that street are super unique and cool (I shudder to think how much they actually cost), and so they recommend using the house that's lined up with your bike as a marker for when you get out of transition, as you're not allowed to hang your own markers or otherwise decorate your area. Getting my stuff together, trying to drink water, get my shake done, my other food. Double checking I have my things in order I will need them. Getting the stuff I don't need in that gear bag to give to the volunteers to return after the race. But oh shit let me triple check, I don't want the bag to have something I need in it. Oh wait now they're announcing it's after 5, transition is closing soon, and I haven't done my bike yet. I don't need to double check my bag the bike is more important. Walk my bike over there, and OH NO now I'm feeling the number 2 coming on. I'm generally very regular so I didn't expect issues with any predumping, but this was a sub-optimal time, so had to send that one to voicemail. I get to the tech and was like, I need you to please check the air and pump it up. He goes ""what pressure?"" In my head I'm like ""pressure? what kind of question is that. Just like... pump... the thing"" For some silly reason I was completely unprepared for that question, and was just like ""I don't care I just don't want a pinch flat."" So he pumps it up, and I'm like what was the pressure, and what did you pump it up to? ""The tires were basically flat, but it's up to 95 psi now."" I'm like okay cool thanks! In my head I was thinking maybe 95 is a little excessive... Car tires don't typically go that high, other bike tires don't go that high. Granted the tubes are significantly larger, and so they can take more cushion, but whatever cool. Long as they don't pop. I take it back to my spot, and this fucker is bouncing! Got a nice little pep in its step! ... or roll, as it were. But oh wait I need to double check my stuff, I think I grabbed the wrong goggles, I need the Roka NOT the Speedo's. Oh no, the googles are fine, I've already checked a dozen times, why am I doing this to myself? Surely people that do lots of these don't check their stuff like this. Oh time for me to get on the bus... but ohhh the back door wants to open again. I can be a real quick power pooper, and there was a huge line to get on the bus, so I knew there was enough people for at least 2 buses. Didn't want to wait until the pier/boat to try, but didn't want there to be a huge line and miss the bus because of the booty chaos. Luckily someone was walking to the bus from there right by me, that confirmed there was no line. Perfect. Finished everything quick and smooth like it was a pit stop at Daytona.

Heading back to the bus, but WAIT I NEED TO CHECK MY STUFF, what about X THING? They've announced that transition closed. Welp, hopefully the other 838234 double checks got me ready. I'm in bus line thinking to myself that surely it's still common for most people that actually do this as a hobby get some kind of OCD/hyper focus on this transition area like it's some magical deity almost. Anyway so I get on the bus, end up sitting next to a guy name Mario. Super nice, he's apparently a local that's done the race a handful of times. We talked a minute (hope you did well!). They announce THIS IS A ONE WAY CRUISE, LEAVE EVERYTHING YOU ARE NOT USING FOR THE RACE IN THE BAG BEFORE YOU BOARD, IF YOU DON'T THEN DO NOT EXPECT ANYTHING BACK THAT IS LEFT ON THE BOAT.  Okay got it, this is the 8308423 time the whole one way cruise thing has been mentioned. It was clever the first time. Now it's just kind of old. Get off the bus... what do I need? Just my ear putty, goggles, and swim cap. Already have the wetsuit on to my torso. I remember hearing to not put it all the way on too early otherwise you melt like you star in The Wizard of Oz. Put the bag in the drop, and get on the boat.

I walk around a little bit just to get my bearings, people watch, check the floors. Wait... there are TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE ON THIS BOAT? But still... SO MUCH ROOM FOR ACTIVITIES. I absolutely thought it was going to be asses to elbows like that popular bar in college on a Friday night. I make it up to the third floor, and the bouncer was like where's your VIP pass? Can't get in without it. I'm like okay that's fine I just want to sit on the couch right here and stretch... OH SHIT HEY MARIO HAVEN'T SEEN YOU IN AGES. Oddly enough he was sitting on that couch so I sit next to him, we chat for a little more as I try to stretch. SAD ABOUT MY LEGS. Everybody wants to go up the stairs to just wander, but this dude is telling them they can't even though that floor has its own room, with doors and everything, and which was only for the VIP with the uber wealth. The area outside was ostensibly for the commoners. But alas, I suppose he went mad with power. But have you ever tried going mad without power? It's boring. No one listens to you.

At any rate I'm up there for I'm sure way too long before I realize that this is most likely the only time I'm going to be doing this, why am I bitching about my legs away from everything? So I start walking around, OH THERE'S ALCATRAZ, we are going around it. And then you hear them announ

1gccluo,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1gccluo/creating_new_friendships_trying_not_to_be_the/,Creating New Friendships - trying not to be the only planner ,"So, I have a good friend of mine, who used Bumble last year, and found a great girl. She‚Äôs now one of our good friends. 

Though I have some great friends in my life , I don‚Äôt really have that ‚Äúcrew‚Äù feel. I have some friends , who are cool with other friends , but it‚Äôs here & there and split across , three different groups. I also have mom friends, cousin friends , etc. 

So with influence from my friend , who found a good friend on bumble, I‚Äôve made a bumble friend account. 

My dilemma: in current friendships I find myself as the planner, the creator of fun. It‚Äôs just me , and my one friend who plan everything. The other girls are always excited to go to our stuff , and have fun with us, but it just gets annoying to be one of the only ones. 

So in this new group, I‚Äôm newly forming with other girls from bumble, I‚Äôm seeing the same thing. I‚Äôm starting to wonder are most girls cowardice ? Are they afraid of being rejected or coming off needy. 

They took the time to make a profile, say they want authentic friendships & people to do life with, some will text first, they‚Äôll talk around the idea of making plans, even hint at me , like I‚Äôm a freaking dude ‚Äúomg I love place xyz , we should totally go sometime ‚Äú 

But fail to actually follow through. 

I‚Äôd wonder if I‚Äôm liked or not, but they always show up when I plan things. 

I‚Äôm just not sure how to get out of this role.

I know so many people who just sit back, relax, and let other people make all the plans, and they simply confirm or deny.

I get invited to big stuff (birthday parties , babies showers, etc.)  , and my other mom friends are great planners. 

But when it comes to girlfriends, I‚Äôm always the main planner. 

I also feel like in these newly formed friendships ,I‚Äôm the one driving. 

Sometimes they‚Äôll send me a meme, or a ‚Äúhave a good day ‚Äú text, so I can tell they want connection, they want friendships, but they are acting like they‚Äôll die, if they actually make a plan. No one will say ‚Äúare you available x or y day for brunch or dinner , or coffee ‚Äú 

It‚Äôs like they refuse , but I can tell they want to do stuff. 

Why are people like this? 

If you‚Äôre like me, how do you get out of these roles ?

1gcciik,https://www.reddit.com/r/IVF/comments/1gcciik/ivf_cycle_was_cancelled_and_i_spoke_to_no_one/,IVF cycle was cancelled and I spoke to no one ,"I started my first round of IVF this month. My husband has azoospermia, so fertility treatments are our only option to try for pregnancy. We spent thousands on donor sperm, and went through three unsuccessful medicated IUIs.

I made it to 8 days of stims -- 225 IUs of Follistim and 150 of Menopur daily, adding Ganirelix on day 6. My hormones were climbing as expected, but I had two giant follicles and many small ones that weren't growing much. My doctor called me that day, last Friday, to tell me that he wanted to change course. I was to trigger that night (1000 IU HCG) with the hope of ovulating off the big follicles, stop the rest of the meds, and then come in a week later to start a luteal phase stimulation. I was grateful that he called and explained this to me, but because I had never heard about any of these scenarios before, I had no sense of what questions to ask. I hung up and ugly cried on a couch in a coffee shop.

Over the next week, I learned what I could about luteal phase stimulation, and my husband and I came up with a handful of questions to ask at our next appointment, which was today. The ultrasound wasn't performed by the doctor (sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't), but I thought I would at least have a chance to ask him or his nurse questions when they called later that day with my bloodwork results. The ultrasound was unlike any I've had before. My uterus was hard to find, almost completely obscured by my large ovaries, which were full of cysts. They measured seven cysts in total, and only one follicle. My bloodwork results appeared in my patient portal about an hour or two later, and my progesterone was shockingly high (over 60 -- a week ago it was 1.06) and my estradiol was still in the 1200s. I waited patiently for the call.

Hours went by, and I got more and more anxious as the clinic's 4pm closing time approached. I got the call finally at 3:38, but the connection was bad and the call failed. I waited for a return call, but got nothing. I checked my portal and saw a message from the nurse, explaining that it was a hard message to write but my cycle would be canceled due to the cysts, which ""come and go on their own."" Our next step would be to wait until my period starts, and schedule a baseline ultrasound once again. I called back the number that called me and left a voicemail. My husband called the office, but there was no answer. We sent a message in the portal asking for her or our doctor to call us back and answer our questions. As you can imagine, 4pm came and went, no call came in, and now it is the weekend.

I am frustrated and sad for many reasons, but I am also angry.

I feel like my nurse waited to call until the last possible moment, and then left the office immediately without trying to call me back after the initial call failed.

I feel gaslit -- of course cysts are naturally occurring, but as someone who doesn't have a history of them and hasn't seen one on of the dozens of ultrasounds I've had over the past year, it's hard to believe that seven just appeared ""on their own.""

I feel like I've lost any understanding of or autonomy over my body. Why is my progesterone so high? Am I at risk for other complications?

And I feel taken for a fool. How can they just expect me to come in for another baseline (and presumably, make a large payment before I can be put on the schedule to become financially cleared), when I have no sense if or how the next round will be approached differently? I don't even know if I will be refunded for the services I haven't received from this cancelled cycle.

I do not mean at all to minimize how hard their jobs must be, and how precious their weekends must feel. I can't imagine having a position like this. I know that I am not unique, and that I shouldn't expect special treatment, but I feel like I was shuffled around and then left to stew all alone.

For as long as I can remember I (M 31) have been having a similar nightmare in almost every way except for location. It happens sometimes a few times in a month, then I can have nothing for a year. I'm almost certain it's work related stress induced but I want to understand what deeper meaning it may have. 

It normally starts the same, I'm somewhere familiar, my childhood home, my grandmother's home, a house I once rented. That sort of thing. I'm walking down a corridor in the middle of the night, but it's not just night, it's creepy bluey sometimes browny dark. I walk along the corridor, hear something behind me, turn to face the danger and then sudden and pure fear sets in. I'm frozen in place, I try to shout but my mouth opens a fraction and all sound is muffled to as if I am screaming behind a closed mouth entirely. It's usually then I wake up. Occasionally, I flash from standing up to laying down in my bed whatever house the dream is in, no danger in sight at all, but in total full body lock, screaming the same muffled scream. This is until I snap out or my wife shakes me because I'm doing the exact same thing laying next to her. 

But tonight was slightly different. (Typing not 10mins from waking up and getting a coffee with no intention of sleeping again) I was in my current home, I was heading to be, checked on my kids to make sure they were safe, like I do everytime I go to bed in the waking world, I lay in bed and hear a scrapping from the front room. I check the area (we've had mice in the walls before so not frightened at all at this point) but with the lights off I can see a flicker of light coming from outside a door/full window we have in the front room. I pull back the curtains and a person, dressed in black clothes and hood (evidently shadowing their face) is there doing something, assuming trying to break in. But here comes the strange part, I go to smash my palm in the window to scare the dude, but I stop millimetres before, I try to knee or kick, and the same. I try to shout, and the same thing as in previous nightmares happens, muffled shouting lips a few millimetres apart and nothing coming out. The dude notices me, jumps up, crosses his arms and laughs.... then I woke up got out of bed, got dressed, made a coffee and started looking for answers.

It's probably just standard work related stress but I can't help feel there is a connection with maybe a past experience or an unconscious fear I have that's surfacing...

It could lead to a new friendship, professional contact or even date.

Basically, you sign up, specify your interests and hobbies and define filters for what you are looking for (just like a dating app). However, you won't need to swipe or get swiped at. Once a week, the app pairs participants together based on their interests. Participants can either accept or reject the pairing. And the app will not be exclusively for dating. Based on your interests, you can get paired with other students just looking for a friend or looking to chat about specific topics (politics, tech, AI, etc).

Would you be interested in joining (even if it requires a cheap monthly fee)?

=================================================================

I feel there's limited opportunities for introverted students (like myself) to find new friends or go on dates.

And I believe a platform like this will be more trustworthy if it is tailored specifically for individual college campuses (you know, just like how facebook started).

For those that have interned at Google, this idea is similar to lunch ninja where you get paired with a random Googler every week for lunch.

This is just an idea I've been thinking about recently but unfortunately, being a graduate student doesn't leave me with enough extra time to pursue it on my own.

What do you guys think of this idea? Would you subscribe if it were available? Or do you think there are other startups already doing something similar?

Also, I'll be happy to have coffee with anyone who finds this idea interesting and wants to talk more about it. Just send me a dm.",5,1729913839.0,Purdue,1,1.0,False

I've used Doordash for over a decade now and I've had several experiences where I was delivered the wrong food or the food never arrived or the food was leaking everywhere and inedible

In all these instances, Doordash customer support behaved in a nasty suspicious manner and implied that I was committing fraud i.e trying to get free food. This is despite me sending pics!

I still remember one time they accidentally emailed me a message in which they wrote ""suspected fraud"". The message was meant for another Doordash employee. This was when I complained that I received a tall Starbucks coffee instead of the Venti I ordered and paid for. I was furious and took a pic of the tall coffee and sent it to Doordash support

Another time, the DoorDash driver delivered someone else's order to me. Instead of being sympathetic, the Doordash support, a lady from the Phillippines, kept telling me on the phone that they will decide in 24 hours. I kept calling them day after day and they would say the same thing! Ultimately I lost $38 because Doordash never refunded me!

It's not just me. I've read numerous posts about DoorDash support refusing to refund Doordash customers because they suspect the customers of committing fraud

This is simply unacceptable! Look, I understand that some customers are scammers, I get it. However for Doordash to be so suspicious of it's customers and always assuming the customer is a scammer is just plain horrible!

Grubhub is way better in that department. They're nowhere near as suspicious as Doordash about their customers. They understand that restaurants mess up all the time! Whether it's forgetting drinks or preparing a wrong order! They don't punish the customer for the restaurant or the delivery driver's mistakes! 

Why is Doordash so suspicious? Why do they think all their customers are scammers?

I honestly never want to use Doordash again after my multiple negative experiences! Anyone else feel the same way?",2,1729913738.0,doordash,1,1.0,False

1gcc2z1,https://www.reddit.com/r/thomyorke/comments/1gcc2z1/auckland_night_1_review_in_which_i_gush/,Auckland night 1 review - in which I gush unapologetically ,"It's the morning after my first show. I wake up and consider that I've just seen one of the best performances of my life. 

I decide this needs some serious, overwrought reflection, and head out into a windy Auckland in an almost-warm-enough Radiohead hoodie. As I pass through the streets, I spot plenty of Thom Yorke shirts out in the wild. This feels good. Right now, in this liminal tour-space, I'm surrounded by people on the same page as me; the ones who want to get lost in these songs, to take every bit of emotional honesty Thom puts out on stage and drink it in. 

There is a lot to process, and for this I will need coffee. I make way into Auckland's interesting bit, and park myself at a trendy cafe.

I think back to last night. 

We are seated to jazz, an intimate, friendly hall of Yorke aficionados. I have a Zine on my lap, and flip through it like I'm at the theatre. The vibe in the room is unlike other shows I've been to. It's not Radiohead, or anything else really. There's a hushed closeness to the way people shuffle into their rows of chairs, to how they filter in and see the array of equipment on stage, an obtuse laboratory of sound. 

The show begins with a slow build of synths. Thom walk out without ceremony, as if this is everyday. Maybe it is for him. The crowd cheers as he sits at the piano; he starts to play. 

'Please excuse me but I've got to ask', are his first words that night, and the audience is endlessly accommodating, sitting in rapt awe. Someone loses their shit, and there's a brief woo of uncontained excitement, quickly muffled. It seems everyone here knows the value of what they are witnessing. 

Thom moves through the set, and I quickly realise it's completely different to what was played the other night in Christchurch. The thrill that anything could happen sets in. 

A few notes on the guitar and oh, I know this song. He's playing Let Down. Is that right? Is he really playing a solo acoustic version of Let Down? By the time I've processed that yes he is, he's messed up the lyrics and 'ah that's the wrong fucking verse', to a round of fond laughter. 

We forgive him his mistakes, as they're endearing and very humanising. The space in the hall feels smaller and closer than before. 

His voice is gorgeous, vulnerable and penetrating. It seems so effortless for him to do this. He flows from song to song, while moving between his machines like a diligent lab technician. 

There are moments during the guitar songs that are haunted by Jonny and the others. Perhaps as I've seen the band live. It's there in my mind, I can hear them playing their parts - and yet Thom feels whole in his presence on stage. This isn't Radiohead, it's something else. The energy tonight is all Thom, and apparently there's an abundance of it. 

'You know where you are' rises up through the room, and the crowd murmers in response, feeling it. 

He's only on the second song and I already feel like this is one of the best shows I've seen. 

The visuals are an art installation in themselves, and I could easily spend the whole show gazing at those dancing lights. For 'Last I Heard' the wall behind Thom is awash with blue shapes, coalescing and cascading, almost forming into something but not quite. It's easy to get lost in the sound and the music, until Thom shifts gears at one of his machines and pulls us all into a new direction, and once again I'm startled to look back down at the stage and see his small silhouetted figure bending over sequencers, pushing buttons and twiddling knobs. He's right there making this with us.  Right there. I try to keep an eye on him, but he's deft, and has launched into Packt before I'm ready for it.  

The drum machine hammers out that iconic beat, and the speakers rumble low. Thom grabs the mic and takes us all back to 2001. 'After years of waiting...' well, after years of waiting, Thom Yorke came to our part of the world. There's no understating how much it means to everyone in this room to sit and watch these iconic songs. Most of us either never have the chance, or go to stupid lengths (me) to see whatever we can. This is an honour, and the crowd is fully aware. 

Thinking about home, when I had left there'd apparently been a visit by the King to the Sydney Opera House, and the masses has gathered for a glimpse. It'll have nothing on Thom Yorke next weekend, I think. 

And then out comes an acoustic guitar. Fake Plastic Trees is met with some intense joy. The cries from the audience are fond, like ""You're amazing Thom"" and funnier, affectionate calls of, ""get it Thom."" There's a note of pride in these, of knowing what he's capable of and being in on it. Apart from that though, the entire hall is dead quiet, holding their breath. When the song finishes, the applause breaks out like a wave. 

He goes straight into Truth Ray, and oh, this is a big one for me. Another false start here, and he's got to wrangle his synths into obedience. Yet again of course, he gets a round of applause for it. He can take us wherever he wants. 

I watch the way he moves as he sings, strangely taut. There's so much emotion in this performance, in how his hands raise up to frame the words. Oh my God, oh my God, he sings, and we can see he's somewhere far away, translating this for us.  Echoes on his vocals reverberate through the hall. I smile at myself, he's produced a tear with this one. Damn. 

'Make it stop, make it stop', he starts to sing at the end, and I'm swept up in feeling more than I bargained for. 

He whispers to himself between songs, darting between machines, checking on his samples. I have no idea what he's doing or how he's doing it, but it's fascinating. 

He's at the piano now, tinkling. Little cascades. Rippling over each other. Is it Bloom? No, not quite. And then he plays the opening chords of Unmade, and I make one of those embarrassing gasps of recognition. This is a favourite of mine, among favourites. 

He sings, and the slow drawn out syllables of the word 'Unmade' slip below my guard into somewhere I'd forgotten. He murmers, 'Come under my wings', and I feel tucked inside of this song, perfectly safe. I want to live here. 

Between songs when my brain frees up enough of its allocation of attendant awe, I'm fervently glad I'm going to more of these. I couldn't stand this to be the last. 

""Alright?"" He says, incongruously casual, and moves into The Present Tense. This is a big deal for me. I've seen him live many times with Radiohead and Atoms For Peace, and over the years I've always missed this song. One time I was pressed up at a wall in Munich hearing it during soundcheck, but I've never heard him play it live like this. 

A soft clicking track gives it movement, as he plucks lightly through the guitar part. This reminds me more of that iconic Latitude version, further developed. It's pointless to describe how beautiful this is. You know. I will say there's such an intimacy in this room, full of all of us hearing how simple this arrangement is, just the beat, an electric guitar, and his voice tying it all together; yet there's an entire landscape of feeling here. I can't help but let it pull me along, caught in it. 

And now, enough of that, it's time for a big electronic banger to wake us the fuck up. 'Not the News' has me jerking my head around like those people on the train in the ANIMA video. This is somehow sharp and pointed, but softened by his voice. For this one, we really should have been standing. 

Not done with that sort of thing, he queues up the heavy opening rumble of Hearing Damage, to quite a few screams of unbridled delight. Oh, they like this one. 'You can do wrong in my eyes', which seems to be exactly what the crowd is thinking as the end of it melts away into electronic symphony. 

The screens go blue, and the lights dance and Kid A starts. A few bars in, Thom adjusts a knob, and cuts back on the resonance, or whatever the right term is, the notes bouncing along cheekily for a bit, before he returns to business as usual.  Some more of that deep rumble slides into the end of the song, and I'm having that moment, realising I'm experiencing Kid A, solo live. He hasn't done this before has he? Come on kids! Oh how badly I want to get up and dance to this. 

Next up, the screens bleed red and Volk is happening. This track is a lot. Making great use of the huge speakers, Thom takes us through this one, into uncharted territory. The crowd is weirdly on board with it, and they should be - the immense, jagged synths cut through everything, the end in particular building up into a heavy electronic swell, ominous, huge and dangerous. Holy shit. 

And then Videotape. The piano has a soft, warm tone, and Thom sings it close to the album, with a muted thump punctuating the beat. The crowd recognises Reckoner, and it's yet another pristine display of falsetto, with just an electric guitar behind it. That's all there is to the song, and yet it has immense presence. 

We're then thrust into the full on wall of sound that signals the new Mark Pritchard collab, but Thom has to restart after a few seconds.

""You didn't notice that right? Ladies and gentlemen there is no computer on the stage.""

And then, ""Some of these bitches don't cooperate.""

That's met with laughter, and we carry on. 

This new song is my favourite bit of the set. It's a banger for sure, and when this releases I'll be playing the hell out of it. 'Back in the Game' is stomping, dark, full of dangerous intensity. Thom is back in Skip Divided mode, and I'm all for it, though - it's not really like anything he's done before. Of course. 

The Clock is blistering, fast, chaotic. Thom uses an electric guitar here, to a clicking drum track. This takes me back to the Atoms For Peace shows, and I miss those with a sudden, sharp pang. Solo Thom is great, but so is the onstage interplay between world class musicians. 

I'm not expecting the arrangement of All I Need that we hear next. All of the elements of the song are there, but reconstructed in their parts. I'm also fascinated by the massive white cube floating mysteriously behind Thom. When the piano comes in at the end, the crowd adores it, and just as on the album the whole thing builds up into a beautiful release. Thom exits the stage. 

Everyone gets to their feet for a standing ovation, and after a moment, Thom reappears, and seems happy to see how receptive the crowd is. He tells us, as if doing an acceptance speech, that he wants to thank everyone he works with, but there's too many to list. 

""I honestly fucking hate working alone,"" he says. And announces Cymbal Rush. This moves through stages of electronics, into Thom on piano again, and then a finale of layered electronic samples. Thom hunches over a machine and takes us right into the depths of bleep bloop territory, weaving it all together. I'm not sure what is required to produce this music, but I'm glad of everything that went into it, and of the people behind the scenes that have pulled together a seriously polished production, musically diverse, and like nothing I've heard before. 

Everything in its Right place is a total crowd pleaser. It strikes me as being quite close to the album. People do get up and dance in their seats here, and the room moves around to this Radiohead classic. 

He tells us his name is Thom Yorke and it's been a pleasure. Well, obviously. 

As he closes out the encore set with Lucky, the crowd sings along with him - and sounds surprisingly good - a gentle background harmony underneath his voice. 

It's a memorable finale. As Thom reaches out to us with the climactic line, ""It's gonna be a glorious day,"" the crowd sighs happily in response. He throws in some ""Aaaahhs"" at the end of this, and it catches me off guard, though I really shouldn't be. They're high, delicate and clear, just one last taste of it. 

His voice is fucking unreal and I refuse to get over this. 

Post show, I'm left muttering to the people I'm with about how great that was. About all of the setlist surprises, how great Thom sounded, all of it. It's time to return to reality, though I suspect it will take a moment. Luckily I'm staying a few blocks away. 

And now here I am, making sure I document every word, every gesture. I've seen several Radiohead shows since 2008, and one thing I've sincerely wished is that I had a full account of how I experienced the night. Video is good, yes, but I think writing it down like this will stand the test of time. Or it may be amusingly embarrassing. That's okay, it's honest. 

Back home, a trusted agent (my mum) has acquired the Electric Lady Studios live record, and a few other things. I'm sent a brief video of the pop-up store, and of course it's decked out in blue Thom art, Reckoner is playing, and the whole space looks like a Radiohead pocket reality. 

In another city, I've secured the Smile newspaper. 

There really is a lot happening this week. Yesterday, I had a job interview in my hotel which maybe went okay, though I've now firmly deleted all that from my brain the same way I've removed Teams from my phone. 

It's worth mentioning how much I love connecting with everyone over this music, gushing over how much these songs mean to us all. It's revitalising, and I'll go on from these shows with new energy. 

It's also very clear just how much Thom enjoys performing, and he certainly took note of the entire room jumping to their feet after the main set, jubilant. It seems a good indicator of further shows around the world, and I can only hope for the rest of you out there that you have a chance to see this. 

In a few hours I will do it all again. ",9,1729913145.0,thomyorke,1,1.0,False

1gcbzsk,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobcorps/comments/1gcbzsk/job_corps_experience_so_far/,job corps experience so far,"so right now i am about to head off into week 3 of cpp. just wanted to share my experience for anyone wondering how things go. please keep in mind stuff might differ-ate depending on the center. this is also not a rant, or anything this is just my experience so far.

 WAITING PERIOD 
so starting off with the wait to get in. i applied in January, and I got an arrival date on june 11th. thus date however was cancelled due to the center shutting down. when it was reopened, I was told id have to wait a bit for other students who applied before me to get in. I would contact my OA (outreach and admissions counselor) twice a week or so to check in and make sure I wasn't getting left in the dust. It usually took like a day for her to respond, and sometimes id have to remind her to. I then had to get a new number, and I tried contacting her on that so that I don't loose any contact with her. She never responded to any of my texts, so after a few weeks I tried calling her. Straight to voicemail. So I  ended up calling the center, and they gave me a new OA, which also never contacted me. I started to loose hope, so I ended up reapplying, and went to an interview. A week after this happens, my sister texts me and tells me a OA just texted her looking for me. I gave him a call and he finally gives me an official arrival date; October 11th.
They also give me a link to a zoom call, and a bus ticket. The zoom call was pretty much just making sure we were going to be able to go and to make sure we know what to and what not to bring.

ARRIVAL DAY
The bus ride was about 4-5 hours long. after I arrived at the final destination, I called my OA to make sure I had a ride to the bus station. Right after, a man asks me if im here for job corps. I then get in a van with two other students, and this ride takes 45 minutes. once there, we have to go through two gates, sign our names, then straight to a building where we were searched. we also went through a metal detector and they searched our shoes and our pockets. after I was cleared, we went to another building where we checked in, signed some information papers, and got some sandwiches for lunch. they also gave is a mesh back pack, a refillable bottle, and two black polo shirts. After this we headed to our dormitory. This dormitory was temporary ( we were only in there for a week). Everyone in this dormitory was new as well. It was pretty small, one side for women and the other for men. They told us we were only staying in this dorm for a week. I had 3 roomates, both were pretty chill. We each got a locker with a code lock, and two drawers under our beds. we also had a desk and some bunk beds. we were then told to unpack, and they gave us some snacks and a gatorade. we also had to fill out an inventory list incase any of our valuables got lost or stolen. It also indicates that if the center somehow damages it, we will get the value of the item back. after that, we just had some pizza, had a little orientation to introduce ourselves, and then we were dismissed and went to bed. (around 10) 

WEEK 1
we got put into this program called cpp (career preparation period) this program is basically just a series of classes to get you ready for trade and campus life. On the 2nd day, we started off by having some ""special breakfast"". This was basically just a breakfast separated from the other students. we also ate with some of the staff, and introduced ourselves to them. afterwards, we went to the wellness center to get drug tested, eye check, shot records, a shot( i forgot what this is for but i think to check for tuberculosis), hearing test, std test,  and an eye test. they also asked if i had any disabilities, diseases, how my mental heath was, and if i needed to be put in any programs for help. this took a little bit because in the middle of it we had a drill which lasted 40 minutes. afterwards, we went to class and learned about what to do and what not to do while at jobcorps. 
Everyday after school, we would have to do ""rolecall"" and then clean our dorms. we were each given a detail, mine was to take put all of the trash. we would do this detail everyday throughout the week.
On the 3rd day, we were given a tour throughout the campus on a bus. they pointed out pretty much everything, and we even got to leave the campus for one second.  they pointed out all the trade buildings too. 
after that pretty much everyday in week 1 was the same thing everyday. In the evening some lady would come in and give us activities to do, which kept us distracted. We were also not allowed to leave the gate outside the dormitory, due to the fact it was our first week and we would get lost. I did find a mouse in my dorm at one point, but after that I didn't hear anymore. There was quite a but of drama going around, im not here to fw it tho.

MOVING DORMS
We moved dorms saturday morning. I was kinda sad cause I loved my roomates, but I was happy because I knew our dorms would be in way better condition. We had to pack our things, clean EVERYTHING up, clean our sheets, make our beds, etc. When we were done, we grabbed all our stuff and headed off to our new dorms via bus. my dormitory is split in two, and only females live here. I somehow managed to get a room with my previous roommates and another girl, who was also in cpp with us. there were four separate beds, we each got a closet with a key, and four drawers under our beds. We also got drawers and a bathroom inside the dorm instead of having to share one with the whole dorm.

WEEKEND
We don't do much for the weekend, I went to the art room and made some bracelets. They have brunch, which was kinda ehh. We don't have to do anything on the weekends but sign the mac report.

CAFETERIA FOOD
Most of the food at the cafeteria is decent. Some days are better than other days though. the bread heres pretty stale and they sure like making eggs even though they cant cook them right. I have yet to see a breakfast where they didn't serve eggs. In the morning they serve coffee and juice. In the afternoon, juice is not available but there is a soft drink machine thats completely free along with tea and lemonade. on wednesdays they only serve water and lemon packets. Out of all the meals ive had here, Id say pasta dishes are the best. try to avoid any meal with bread cus its gonna be stale and crumbly. Also they leave a whole jar of peanut butter out OPENED for everyone to smell on the counter, which kinda sounds like a safety concern because there are people with peanut allergies.

ACTIVITIES 
they got multiple things for us to do, for one they got events almost every week, they got birthday parties every month, theres a rec center which has an art room, a music room, a gym, a weight room, a boxing room, and a lobby with pool tables and other games. Theres also a movie theater, and a library. They also have a women's center where women can go to exercise knowing they are safe. There's pretty much something to do here, you can also go for a walk. If you're big like me, you're going to loose weight while you're here.

WEEK 2 
for week two we got separated into three different teachers, my teacher was pretty cool she had some teddy bears and brought us snacks. for the first day we just did introductions. The second day we just did some learning and then a presentation about job corps and the opportunities it has. We got to ""shadow"" the trade were doing, which means for a few hours you go to the trade you picked and they show you around and give you a bit of training. for me i chose welding, so I did some stick welding, it was pretty good but I wasn't very good at it, but I was getting better throughout the time I was there. I kept sticking to the metal üò≠ and I forgot that with stick welding the rod melts so you gotta keep getting closer to the metal. after that we did another trade for 50 minutes, mine was plastering, but we didn't really do anything there. afterwards the taught us the dangers of stds and did some anger management class that was required. we did see some not so pretty images so..
next day, we got all our results in from wellness, (drug test and std test) i passed both. If you fail your drug test they put you in a program called TEAP. If you get tested positive you must go to this class once a week for an hour. If you get tested positive the second time ur good as long as it went down to at 50% but if you fail you go home and cant come back for a year. 
then after that we ordered our uniforms, and I got a PIR for cleaning the class up

PAY
so on the Friday of the first week you get paid $25. after that each week you get $45, but idk how much it is after taxing. I did get paid only $14.80 for this week but my teacher said its because of my uniforms so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. after 8 months you get paid $75. 

ANIMALS
there is so much wild life here, Ive seen so many skunks in this place. There are poisonous snakes and spiders but if you stay away from them youre okay. If you happen to get sprayed by a skunk, you have to go home but once the smell is away youre good to come back

LEAVE DAYS
there are weekend passes, theres a thanksgiving break (i think only the day off) and Christmas break (around 3 weeks) we get PTO days too. you get 3 pto days when you first arrive and after that you get 1 every 30. you can add them up and get like a week off. you will still get paid if you use these. 
you can get denied weekend passes if you get any nirs.


ADDITIONAL STUFF
they give you a laptop, though I think for hard trades you don't get to keep it
you can apply for food stamps and medicate while here. 
 the internet is tracked by federal government so think before you post anything on here. vpns will not work.
the laws here are federal so just because its legal in your state doesn't mean its legal here.
minors and adults cannot date. even if its a 18 and 17 year old, you can get registered as a SO if you are caught dating or doing any romantic or sxual activities with a minor. also sending explicit pictures to a minor or as a minor is considered distribution of child prn so yeah üò¨ dont be weird
dont expect your dorms not to have pests, if they dont good for you but there are dorms with mice/rats/ants here just keep your room clean.
do not come here to escape drama bc i promise u there is 10x more drama here than any other highschool/college
keep ur hygiene up because if you're not they will make u sign a hygiene contract 
bring ur own tampons cus the tampons here are not great üò≠
dont be having drugs or anything illegal here, if you get caught you will get arrested 



OPINION 
overall its pretty great here as long as youre doing what youre supposed to be doing. just dont get in trouble do your work and get that work in. I suggest you bring snacks n stuff cus some of the food here aint great.

I am an AM at a pub I work for a GM who I have worked with previously as my DM in a previous pub. We have known each other for a while and I have decided to come and work for her when she became a GM.
She has hired a new guy to be a DM. He‚Äôs about 40/41 years old male. I am a 24 year old female. 
I started working with her about three months ago and he started about 2 months ago (maybe less).
Today as well as yesterday he seemed off with me the whole shift. 

I usually work on the floor in the restaurant area. I was doing so today while he was on bar  and our GM was in the kitchen helping out. I saw that the bar was getting a little busy so I jumped in to help him.  
After which he came up to me and said ‚Äù go back to looking after your restaurant‚Äù in a passive-aggressive way. I was a bit taken back by that. Either way I went back on the floor and ignored it
I had to close with him and our GM finished around 10pm.

Legally at least two people have to be present while closing a pub .Therefore, it was I and him who were meant to be closing. I also have a 40hour contract and can deny going home if I am not doing my contracted hours.
However, it got to like 10:45 pm and he says to me ‚Äù knock yourself out, go home‚Äù. I thought I misheard him so I said ‚Äù what‚Äù and he replies  ‚Äù go home‚Äù. I ask him if he has a problem with me  as he has been off the whole shift and had an attitude towards me, to which he replies ‚Äù go home‚Äù. I go back to what I was doing prior to that interaction which was bringing the ash  trays in to clean them and once again he says to me when I come back to the bar ‚Äù I told you to go home, go home‚Äù. At this point I get quite annoyed and I say ‚Äù fine I will go home, enjoy closing alone‚Äù. 

At this point I message my GM to let her know what happened and we went out for a cigarette. 
She tells me to go back and stay and if he says anything else to tell him that she told me to stay and that if he would like to he can leave. And just ignore any comments he makes. She also asked me to check the kitchen to make sure all the equipment were off and labels changed as a chef asked me to do so prior.  
 
I go back downstairs and continue to close the garden and bring ashtrays in and clean them behind the bar. Again the DM comes up to me and say ‚Äù go home‚Äù. I let him know that our GM told me to stay and that if he would like he can leave. I also stated that we are both adults and if there are any issues we can talk it out like adults. At this point he ignores me.

I put my phone and my tobacco by the coffee machine near restaurant area and go into the kitchen to do fridge checks and equipment checks. While I‚Äôm in the walk in fridge I can hear the DM walk in and go to our storage area located downstairs which is accessed through the kitchen. He noticed that I‚Äôm in the fridge as the door to the fridge was open.

When I leave the kitchen after doing all the checks I notice my phone and tobacco is no  longer where I left it (by the coffee machine).
At this point I go up to the DM and ask him if he has moved it as it is no longer where I left it. He stares at me blankly and ignore me. Once again I repeat myself and ask if he moved or touched my stuff. Again he ignored me staring at me blankly and saying NOTHING.  I ask about 2 more times after which I look for my stuff all over the pub. Going back to the kitchen, the fridge and any where I was previously. I cannot find my phone and tobacco anywhere. 

I knock on my GMs door and ask to use her phone to ring moments try to locate it. I have explained the situation to her if it going missing. She allowed me to use her phone to call mine.

At this point I was thinking maybe a customer took it and it was stolen.
 
I have an Apple Watch and when I rung my phone of my GM‚Äôs phone I noticed that it was coming through on the watch which meant my phone had to be in the building. At this point I had a feeling that the DM must have something to do with it going missing.

After a few mins of still not being able to locate it I go back to my GM and let her know I still cannot find it and that my DM is ignoring me when i ask if he has seen it or moved it. 

She comes to help me look. We are both looking everywhere for it. She goes behind the bar to look (I‚Äôve obviously already checked there incase the DM moved it there, but wasn‚Äôt there when I checked). It wasn‚Äôt there when she checks. At this point me my GM and DM are all at the bar and the DM leaves the bar. He comes back practically straight away and hands my stuff back saying ‚Äù go home‚Äù in front of my GM. It is clear that he hid my phone out of spite. And was just getting some thrill and enjoyment out of me stressing and looking for my belongings. 
At this point my GM says to him, to go home and she tells me she will go and get changed and come and help me close.

After my GM leaves I ask him how old is he and ask him if he is aware that what he has done is illegal. Obviously I get no response and get ignored.

I make sure to go up to the office where we keep our stuff and move it into my GM‚Äôs apartment before he goes into the office.

So is what he done illegal? I know this is not a normal person behaviour and it made me feel really uncomfortable and unsafe. 

When I was leaving work I was a bit scared that he could potentially be waiting somewhere till I leave or something and I had to call someone to feel secure. I know this might sound like a bit much but honestly that behaviour made me feel really off about him. Especially that we never had any type of a friendship relationship, never any banter or anything.It was strictly professional always until today.

1gcblma,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1gcblma/my_stepmom_is_struggling_and_i_cant_force_myself/,My stepmom is struggling and I can‚Äôt force myself to care,"My (F29) stepmom (F47) recently told me about her struggles with hormone changes as a result of perimenopause. For context, even though she‚Äôs been in my life since I was a toddler, I‚Äôve never felt close to her. She‚Äôs extremely type-a, extremely neurotypical, and harshly judges anyone who struggles with executive dysfunction. Despite the fact that I‚Äôve displayed clear signs of adhd from an early age, my parents never had me screened for it (I‚Äôm currently in the process of doing so as an adult).

My entire life, my stepmom has gone out of her way to make me feel like a shitty person for struggling as badly as I do. If I got distracted in the middle of a task and lost track of what I was doing, I was lazy. If I got overwhelmed by large tasks like cleaning my room or packing to move, I was stupid because it‚Äôs ‚Äúso simple, you just do it.‚Äù If I lost track of time from hyper-focusing, I was an irresponsible kid who just needed harsh discipline and tough love. Meanwhile, she was a self-proclaimed ‚Äúwork horse‚Äù who bragged left and right about her exceptional ability to do housework, organizational tasks, etc. 

After going to college, I worked my ass off trying to create routines and tricks that work for my brain, and discovered there are so many things I‚Äôm actually good at. Im not the irredeemable screw up she made me think I was. Did she notice my improvement? Absolutely not. In her mind, I‚Äôm still the same lazy, irresponsible child.  

So recently, my stepmom was talking to me about her issues with perimenopause. She said her hormones have caused her to struggle with basic workflows for the first time in her life. She said, (paraphrasing) ‚ÄúIn the morning I try to start a load of laundry, but while doing that I realize I haven‚Äôt had coffee, then halfway through making coffee I notice the dirty dishes, and while cleaning the dishes I remember I need to shower, but before I can shower, I need to finish the laundry I never started. It feels impossible to do anything.‚Äù 

I politely said, ‚ÄúYeah I totally understand what you mean.‚Äù But inside I‚Äôm screaming, ‚ÄúUm, you mean like THE THING I‚ÄôVE EXPERIENCED EVERY FUCKING DAY OF MY LIFE?‚Äù I‚Äôm seething with anger. She talked about these issues as though she‚Äôd never heard of them before, as though I hadn‚Äôt explained this exact problem over and over again growing up. When it was me, she shrugged off executive dysfunction as my laziness getting in the way. But when she finally gets a taste of what it feels like inside my brain, it‚Äôs suddenly worth sympathizing with because it‚Äôs HER. I wish I could sympathize with her, maybe give her some advice based on my experience. Because I know how debilitating it can be. But honestly, I‚Äôm just going to let her figure it out like I did.

Today, we had a paediatrician appointment and all 3 of our girls had 4 vaccines each. Our 15 month twins had their 12 months plus flu, and our 7 weeker had her 2 months plus RSV antibodies. ALL of them have been suuuuper fussy all evening. I'm talking all 3 screaming at once, one of the twins (we call her our big feelings girl because she's the emotional one of the two) has done nothing but scream until she started gagging and NOTHING I have done has helped. No snacks, no drink, no lovins, not a damn thing. The youngest would hardly eat her bottle because she was just screaming and screaming. There's paperwork from their paediatrician of the doses I can give them of Tylenol or Motrin, but my partner misplaced it and I'm still looking for it because I'd rather be safe then sorry. My partner is away for a good majority of the weekend...

I had been listening to nothing but 3 screaming children for several hours at this point and I was extremely overwhelmed and felt like shit because I know they don't feel good, and I feel like I'm inflicting suffering on them in hopes I'm doing right by hopefully protecting them from disease and illness. And I was telling him about how this evening was going for me on my own, and being sarcastic about how their appointment fell on the perfect day because he'll be gone almost all weekend. And he asked me if he should stop by to help me, he already knew I was struggling but asked if he should come help?? It frustrated me, so I didn't respond because in my mind, he knew I was struggling and could use some help. But instead of maybe ""how can I help"" he asks if he should come help.

1gcbiyj,https://www.reddit.com/r/EyeFloaters/comments/1gcbiyj/my_success_story/,My Success Story,"I post this every once in a while. I'm 35 years old now but at time of writing I think I was about 28. People that get over their floaters don't come back to this sub enough because they forget about how bad it was‚Äîyes there's hope for you! But remembering how horrifying floaters were for me when they initially happened, I swore to come back and post my success story a few times a year. Sadly it's been a couple years since I posted my story.

Keep in mind that since this was a few years ago the time references I make are relative, and I have had relapses since then, but this same framework/story has pulled me out of the hole with greater frequency and shorter turn around every time. Note, this writing was originally a response to someone else about *their* floaters (why the beginning sounds the way it does). Here it goes:   
  
---

Clear floaters are experienced by most humans, it's just that they never notice them. If I concentrate hard enough I can see probably a few hundred of those. And I've been able to do that since I was 6 or 7. Several other non-eyefloater people I've spoken with have confirmed the same thing.  
  
But about 6 months ago, for the first time, I saw dark floaters. 2 large ones near the center of both my left and right eyes, but slightly different for each eye. This terrified me. I couldn't do anything but look at them, and I avoided light at all costs for the fear of them. 

Waking up in the morning was the worst. I couldn't tell if I spotted them in my nightmares or through my eyelids first.

Shortly after my big floaters, my paranoia quickly led me to discover approximately 10 or so other semi-dark floaters closer to the periphery of my vision.
  
Here is, in my opinion, the most important observation about floaters (for my case). In my roughest time (approx 4-5 months ago) the following applied:  
  
 * My caffeine consumption was high.  
 * My job was intensely stressful.  
 * I hadn't been in the sun for an extended period of time in about 6 months.   
 * I had become more philisophically nihilistic (does not help with stess).    
  
What worsened the problem was that, since I noticed my floaters, I was constantly checking for and observing them (which is not a healthy human behavior). And alas I noticed that when I did this paranoid check-in on the floaters, I wasn't breathing.
  
--- 
  
So, about 2-3 months ago, while reading Viktor E. Frankl's *A Man's Search for Meaning* I decided that I was going to live my life as if there is meaning regardless of whether there truly is meaning or not. Frankl's story made it obvious to me that I could no longer allow floaters to dominate my mind. 

And with no feasible medical alternatives (finances and fear of medical procedures) I decided that I would *actively* begin forgetting the floaters. (Note that I had been to an opthymologist to confirm there was no eye injury).
  
To get control back over my life, the first thing I decided was that instead of checking for the floaters I would *not* check for them. I decided to train myself to do this. Whenever I noticed them I decided to look away to a dark and/or multicolored background to ""lose"" them. This I sometimes refer to as the *anti-notice* technique. And, maybe more importantly, whenever I noticed them I decided to focus on my breathing (as previously mentioned, until this time I had stopped breathing, which caused neck pain and headaches, which can contribute to other visual phenomena). 

My focus on breathing did two things: (1) I began to take deep controlled breaths which reduced stress and head/neck tightness; (2) this technique switched my focus from the floaters to something else, which is crucial to getting over them.
  
The second thing I did was quit caffeine. I love coffee and this really hurt. But as a result, I began to sleep better and my anxiety was reduced (you might want to quit smoking weed and drinking too, if those are thing you engage in [no judgement]). Note that a year-ish after writing this I returned to caffeine, coffee, but limit myself to 1, 2 cups max, per day. Before that it was just whatever was at my fingertips.
  
The third thing I did, is that I decided to go outside. Instead of being afraid of floaters I decided to take them head on (mind you I had to use my *anti-notice* technique quite a bit). Reading about the relationship between sunlight and human health fueled my decision. I went to the beach, and went to the park -- actively trying to pay attention to my surroundings, even looking at the sky to challenge myself. Again, when you look at your surroundings, intentionally focus on those surroundings and not your floaters (and breathe!).  

Not only did I go outside, but I began exercising -- running -- outside. Exercising is a good stress/anxiety reducer and it is mentally challenging. If you push yourself hard your body will have no choice but to allocate energy and focus to the task at hand (funnily enough I noticed this happened while reading intense passages in literature as well).   
  
Lastly, I toughened up. You can do it. I've gone from anxiety-ridden to mildly confident just by willing myself to do so. There are still times when I regress, but I recognize that regress and am becoming better at understanding that it's natural. No one can be positive all the time, but we have to make an effort to get out of our holes. If not, what's the point? Life is what you make it. If you decide there is meaning, then there is, and ignore people who attempt to deny you that. 

We can all understand the possibility that this world and universe is empty, but there's a chance it's not. And I'm going to take that chance, and so should you. 
 
--- 
  
As a last note, I urge you to motivate yourself. Train yourself to do what you want. I never knew this type of thinking could work until floaters happened to me. But it does work. Come up with some ideas that let you slowly crawl out of your ""hole"". Train yourself to be strong. When defeatist/nihilistic thoughts enter your brain, don't get upset that you have them; acknowledge them, recgonize them for what they are, and intentionally use some technique you invent to take your mind to a more positive realm. It's hard at first, but stay on top of it and it gets easier and easier.  
  
--- 
  
In conclusion, my floaters are still there but I have forced/trained myself not to notice them. Right now I am completely ignoring them. I can see them if I try but I *don't try*. You have some control of your brain, exercise that control.

So this story isn‚Äôt about me, but my 8th grade math teacher. I remembered about this while watching and am I the jerk video. I can‚Äôt really remember all the details, but I‚Äôll do the best I can.

So, my math teacher told us this to explain why she was absent the day before. She had gotten up at 6 am, as usual, gotten her coffee, and started driving to work. She got to a four way intersection, and turned right. Thats when another car crashed right into the side of her‚Äôs, pushing it right into a fence.

Now it wasn‚Äôt that bad of a crash but still caused a big dent in the side of her car. As soon as this happened, she quickly called the police to handle it, and told the school she would be out for the day.

Now she didn‚Äôt tell us what the reaction of the guy that crashed into her was, but what she did tell us was that when the police came and took her and the guy‚Äôs report, and they found out that the guy was driving without a license, and turns out, he had illegally crossed the border(he was Mexican), he had  just got this car, and was heading to his new job.

Now she had insurance, but he didn‚Äôt, and in the span of a few hours, this guy got his new car dented, got fined from about 200-2000 dollars , lost his new job, and probably got kicked out of the country. While my math teacher only had to pay a few hundred out of her own pocket(FYI, for anyone wondering, she told us she only got a light ache in her left side from the crash ).

So I guess what I‚Äôm asking is, is my math teacher the jerk for calling the cops on him without trying to talk or negotiate? I mean, she barely got hurt, had to pay a few hundred, but he lost his car, got a huge fine, lost his job, and most likely got kicked out of the country.

So, is she the jerk?",0,1729910368.0,AmITheJerk,20,0.47,False

Is that normal? When I exhale very hard, I can smell my tongue and it gives off a ""fart"" like smell. (TMI, sorry). A friend suggested cutting sugar and refined carbs for 30-60 days while taking prebiotics. After doing that along with sticking to a carnivore diet, it's hopeless. My mouth still gives off   
major bad breath (not ""normal bb, like from drinking coffee, or being dehydrated). Any one have insight on what could help clear bad breath? 

Also to note, I've tried doxy antibiotics for 10 days, gargled with baking soda/hydrogen peroxide, taken ACV shots, upped vitamins such as b12, D3+K2, oregano oil, fish oil, vitamin c, slippery elm, zinc, waterpik, tongue brush, tongue scrapper, checked for tonsil stones, pretty much every suggestion known to the average person.

1gcb99a,https://i.redd.it/qrog36g5j0xd1.jpeg,stagg 23c vs ecbp c923 honeymoon edition REVIEW #013,"alright alright. today folks, i visited a cutesie (very demure) little cocktail bar in st pete FL called intermezzo. the theme of this review, or sub theme more properly, is that i am celebrating my recent marriage. my beautiful wife and i spent the day exploring different coffee shops mainly, but hit a few spots in the city (great btw, if you need recs i gotchu) and wrapped it up before dinner with intermezzo.

anywho. it‚Äôs a cafe meets swanky and *modern* cocktail bar, and as soon as i walked in my god forsaken , bourbon rotted brain spotted that elijah craig line. immediately there she is, a barrel proof. above it, a stagg. next to that, the btac rye known as thomas handy. and so on. 

again. anywho. i started with an (ok) priced eht taylor small batch (13$, half the price of single barrel, and one of the cheapest bottles they had) when i tarried back up there to up the stakes, i somewhat sheepishly told the nice girl working the cafe that i would really love to see the batches of a couple bottles, and she brilliantly proposed that she could just hand me the bottles and i check em out.

anywho (finally). i end up finding out it is the most lauded batch of ECBP i‚Äôve have known in my few year whiskey journey , the stagg is the same price , and i get both to do a bit of a not even attempted blind because the heaven hill product is so dark it looks like stagg spend a few days in the sun .. 

this is half ‚Äúlets see who wins‚Äù and half ‚Äúheaven hill competes with BT and isn‚Äôt targeted to high hell‚Äù and half ‚Äúgood old fun for me to write a review and remember a special day.‚Äù

without any further ado except the bare minimum stats, let‚Äôs have at it.

ecbp c923 133 proof and 13 years 7 months old
((VS))
stagg 23c 127.6 proof and rumored 6-8 years old

stagg 23c vs ECBP C923

stagg nose - light, little oak on the nose. ethanol and swedish fish. more red fruits abound. sweet, simple? solid.

ecbp nose- dark flavor blast. sweet oak, black cherry, honeycomb. fucking fantastic 

stagg palate- waves of light candy sweetness, vanilla, and what i can only describe as classic buffalo trace candy shop flavors. a sharp oak in the mid palate among the candies, and finally a lovely integrated medium oak sweetness. big step up from the nose

ecbp palate- a humongous whiskey. everything is as big as texas in this palate. huge oak, huge black cherry sweetness from the nose returns, and cinnamon spice on the finish. the oak turns a tad drying on the finish, but with sweetness all over the nose and palate this is not unwelcome. mouthfeel is very worth mentioning , it‚Äôs excellent. on another sip maple pancake enters the fray, oak never leaves and just makes itself very at home amongst the dessert buffet sitting in your palate.

finish ? not a huge finish guy, it‚Äôs just so damn subjective . but yeah, the ecbp finishes with all that rich oak and a little spice and it carries on a bit. the stagg has a little dance between candies and sharp oak and pleasant oak and ethanol. reminder , the ecbp is almost 6 proof points HIGHER

yes, i‚Äôm feeling the consequences of day drinking, barrel proof monsters, and honeymoon vibes.

conclusion- the ECBP kicks the stagg‚Äôs ass. in fact, call the stagg a baby deer and the EC your divinized, wise, mythic grandfather. in a bourbon skirmish this is a thunderous knockout round one. call it jorge masvidal (ecbp) flying knee to ben askren‚Äôs (stagg 23c) arrogant little skull. battle over before it started effectively .

t8ke rating
stagg 23c- 7| great | well above average 
ecbp c924- 9| incredible | an all time favorite

so yeah. the c923 kicks ass , is worth every bit of hype it got, and i am pessimistic that heaven hill puts out another non LE with these stats and this pedigree any time soon. maybe ever again. i mean why would they? they could easily charge double for this , look at what Campari is doing with ol gobbler and their LE‚Äôs. this has better stats than Russel‚Äôs 13 man‚Ä¶ 

i admittedly haven‚Äôt tried the russel‚Äôs but if it tasted like this i would be floored. the stagg is better than the only other batch i‚Äôve had, 23b, but it just can‚Äôt hang with something that bangs harder than(_________)

I do well with:
- front 
- warming 
- cold bar 
- DTR

I don‚Äôt do well with: 
- DTO and DTR at the same time when busy
- hot bar when busy 

It‚Äôs not uncommon for me to be full drive through routine during peak and I get so frustrated. I don‚Äôt understand how I‚Äôm supposed to:
- talk to the person at the window 
- process the transaction 
- get the person to just take the card reader and stop making me hold it 
- confirm if they want straws, etc 
- confirm the item is correct 
- mark it off the DPM
- stage orders for upcoming cars 
- try to sort through relevance of anything partners are saying over the headset 
- respond to them when needed 
- *taking an order at the same time*

And if, god forbid, there needs to be a remake or the customer has a problem, it‚Äôs just mayhem.

I get frustrated because I‚Äôm really trying and then get short when partners say things like ‚Äújust take the order while giving the change to the customer at the window‚Äù because my problem is literally that I can only focus on one thing at a time. 


This is the same problem with me on hot bar as well. I‚Äôm great with making one drink at a time, I was a barista awhile back at a non-corporate, slow paced coffee shop. I enjoy the craft of coffee. But being expected to ‚Äúhave three drinks going at all times‚Äù is insane. The siren craft is absolute nonsense.


I want to make this work. I don‚Äôt care about being some star employee, the hours work well for me while I‚Äôm in college right now and it‚Äôs not too much stress.

So many times, I feel like we hear horror stories about getting shut down in public, or that no one wants to be approached anymore, but this experience kind of changed my perspective.

I was sitting at this coffee shop I go to sometimes to work, and there was a woman (F25 maybe?) who sat at the table next to me. We made brief eye contact a couple times, and she had that sort of friendly energy about her. I sat there for a good ten minutes overthinking everything ‚Äì like, should I say something, what if she‚Äôs got a boyfriend, or worse, what if she just straight up ignores me? But something in me was just like, ‚Äúwhat do I have to lose?‚Äù So I waited until she put her phone down and looked around like she was kinda bored.

I just started with, ‚ÄúHey, sorry to bother you, but I couldn‚Äôt help but notice your awesome taste in coffee choices‚Äù (she‚Äôd ordered the same coffee as me ‚Äì figured it was a safe start, lol). She laughed and actually seemed kinda flattered that someone noticed her. We got into a conversation, nothing majorly intense, just casual stuff about what we‚Äôre doing at the coffee shop, some of our favorite spots around the city, etc.

After maybe 20 minutes, I casually suggested that it‚Äôd be fun to grab coffee again sometime. She smiled and said she‚Äôd like that ‚Äì and gave me her number. I honestly couldn‚Äôt believe it worked because I was so sure I‚Äôd get shut down.

We actually did end up going on a first date this past weekend. It was one of the most chill dates I‚Äôve been on, just because we‚Äôd already broken the ice in person before. Honestly, I think it was way better than a dating app connection because we already knew a little bit about each other, and I didn‚Äôt feel that awkward vibe of, ‚ÄúDo I match the expectations I set online?‚Äù

I guess I‚Äôm posting this for anyone else who‚Äôs hesitant to approach someone in person.

Yes, yes, I see you. Get in. Get in.

Your mother is having another one of her episodes. Last night, she went to see *A Doll‚Äôs House* with a couple girlfriends, and now she has ideas. I emerged from my sanctum this afternoon to discover that not only had she not made me lunch, which is a meal I need in order to live, but she‚Äôd, furthermore, locked herself in the bedroom to weep. Loudly.

Now it‚Äôs one thing for a woman to weep, but when they do it at such a volume you can hear it through the door, that‚Äôs when you know that they‚Äôre doing it just for the attention.

Anyway, I was able to cobble together a sandwich for myself, so I‚Äôm the real hero of the story.

\[horn honking\]

It was a couple hours later when I realized I was on a good run with my novel. I had this really interesting sentence that kept going for pages and pages, and I thought about how rare it is to really get in the groove like that; how most days, I can‚Äôt concentrate because my idiot child is blasting the television and it suddenly dawned on me‚Äîhot cock on a rock, she never even picked up the little noise and snot factory!

So, here I am, being your mother, which I know is giving you all sorts of mixed-up ideas about gender, while your brain is still loose and stupid.

What am I supposed to do now? Just go back to writing? I‚Äôm out of the zone now, the whole day‚Äôs shot!

No. It‚Äôs not her fault. She‚Äôs doing the best she can, after all. It‚Äôs just that‚Ä¶ you can‚Äôt depend on women. You can‚Äôt depend on anyone. Sooner or later, you need to learn that no one else is gonna take care of you. That‚Äôs what I learned when I had to make my own sandwich. You can‚Äôt rely on other people, BoJack.

So I stopped at a Jack in the Box on the way here, and the girl behind the counter said, ‚ÄúHiya! Are you having an awesome day?‚Äù Not, ‚ÄúHow are you doing today?‚Äù No. ‚ÄúAre you having an *awesome* day?‚Äù Which is pretty‚Ä¶ shitty, because it puts the onus on me to disagree with her, like if I‚Äôm not having an *‚Äúawesome day,‚Äù* suddenly I‚Äôm the negative one.

Usually when people ask how I‚Äôm doing, the real answer is I‚Äôm doing shitty, but I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm doing shitty because I don‚Äôt even have a good reason to be doing shitty. So if I say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing shitty,‚Äù then they say, ‚ÄúWhy? What‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù And I have to be like, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, all of it?‚Äù So instead, when people ask how I‚Äôm doing, I usually say, ‚ÄúI am doing *so* great.‚Äù

But when this girl at the Jack in the Box asked me if I was having an awesome day, I thought, ‚ÄúWell, today I‚Äôm actually allowed to feel shitty.‚Äù Today I have a good reason, so I said to her, ‚ÄúWell, my mom died,‚Äù and she immediately burst into tears. So now *I* have to comfort *her*, which is annoying, and meanwhile, there‚Äôs a line of people forming behind me who are all giving me these real judgy looks because I made the Jack in the Box girl cry.

And I would like to order a Double Jack Meal, and I‚Äôve kinda got somewhere to be, so maybe less with the crying and more with the frying, huh? \[inhales\] And the girl apologizes again and she offers me a free churro with my meal. And as I‚Äôm leaving, I think, ‚ÄúI just got a free churro because my mom died.‚Äù No one ever tells you that when your mom dies, you get a free churro.

\[woman coughs\]

Hey, Mom, what did you think of that joke? You like that? You never did care for my comedy.

\[clears throat\]

Here‚Äôs a story. When I was a teenager, I performed a comedy routine for my high school talent show. There was this, uh, cool jacket that I wanted to wear because I thought it would make me look like Albert Brooks. For months, I saved up for this jacket. But when I finally had enough, I went to the store and it was gone. They had just sold it to someone else. So, I went home and I told my mother, and she said, ‚ÄúLet that be a lesson. That‚Äôs the good that comes from wanting things.‚Äù She was really good at dispensing life lessons that always seemed to circle back to everything being my fault.

But then, on the day of the talent show, my mother had a surprise for me. She had bought me the jacket. Even though she didn‚Äôt know how to say it, I know this meant that she loved me.

Now that‚Äôs a good story about my mother. It‚Äôs not true, but it‚Äôs a good story, right? I stole it from an episode of *Maude* I saw when I was a kid, where she talks about her father. I remember when I saw it, thinking, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the kind of story I want to tell about my parents when they die.‚Äù But I don‚Äôt have any stories like that. All I know about being good, I learned from TV. And in TV, flawed characters are constantly showing people they care with these surprising grand gestures. And I think that part of me still believes that‚Äôs what love is. But in real life, the big gesture isn‚Äôt enough. You need to be consistent, you need to be dependably good. You can‚Äôt just screw everything up and then take a boat out into the ocean to save your best friend, or solve a mystery, and fly to Kansas. You need to do it every day, which is *so*‚Ä¶ hard.

When you‚Äôre a kid, you convince yourself that maybe the grand gesture could be enough, that even though your parents aren‚Äôt what you need them to be over and over and *over* again, at any moment, they *might* surprise you with something‚Ä¶ wonderful. I kept waiting for that, the proof that even though my mother was a hard woman, deep down, she loved me and cared about me and wanted me to know that I made her life a little bit brighter. Even now, I find myself waiting.

Hey, Mom, knock once if you love me and care about me and want me to know I made your life a little bit brighter.

My mother did not go *gentle* into that good night. She went clawing and fighting and thrashing, hence the face.

\[groaning\]

\[mourners gasping\]

If you‚Äôd seen her, I swear to God the only thing you‚Äôd be thinking about right now is that I am *nailing* this impression.

\[woman clears her throat\]

\[chairs squeak\]

I was in the hospital with her those last moments, and they were truly horrifying, full of nonsencial screams and cries, but there was this moment, this one instant of strange calm, where she looked in my direction and said, ‚ÄúI see you.‚Äù That‚Äôs the last thing she said to me. ‚ÄúI see you.‚Äù Not a statement of judgment or disappointment, just acceptance and the simple recognition of another person in a room. ‚ÄúHello there. You are a person. And I see you.‚Äù

Let me tell you, it‚Äôs a weird thing to feel at 54 years old, that for the first time in your life your mother sees you. It‚Äôs an odd realization that that‚Äôs the thing you‚Äôve been missing, the only thing you wanted all along, to be seen. And it doesn‚Äôt feel like a relief, to finally be seen. It feels *mean*, like, ‚ÄúOh, it turns out that you knew what I wanted, and you waited until the very last moment to give it to me.‚Äù I was prepared for more cruelty. I was sure that she would get in one final zinger about how I let her down, and about how I was fat and stupid and too tall to be an effective Lindy-hopper. How I was needy and a burden and an embarrassment‚Äîall that I was ready for. I was not ready for *‚ÄúI see you.‚Äù* Only my mother would be lousy enough to swipe me with a moment of connection on her way out. *But* maybe I‚Äôm giving her too much credit. Maybe it wasn‚Äôt about connection. Maybe it was a‚Ä¶ maybe it was an ‚ÄúI see you,‚Äù like, uh, ‚ÄúI see you.‚Äù Like, ‚ÄúYou might have the rest of the world fooled, but I know exactly who you are.‚Äù *That‚Äôs* more my mom‚Äôs speed.

Or maybe she just literally meant ‚ÄúI see you. You are an object that has entered my field of vision.‚Äù She was pretty out of it at the end, so maybe it‚Äôs dumb to try to attribute it to anything.

\[woman sighs\]

Back in the 90s, I was in a very famous TV show called *Horsin‚Äô Around*.

\[man coughs\]

Please hold your applause. And I remember one time, a fan asked me, ‚ÄúHey, um, you know that episode where the horse has to give Ethan a pep talk after Ethan finds out his crush only asked him to the dance because her friends were having a dorkiest date contest? In all the shots of the horse, you can see a paper coffee cup on the kitchen counter, but in the shots of Ethan, the coffee cup‚Äôs missing. Was that because the show was making a statement about the fluctuant subjectivity of memory and how even two people can experience the same moment in entirely different ways?‚Äù And I didn‚Äôt have the heart to be, like, ‚ÄúNo, man, some crew guy just left their coffee cup in the shot.‚Äù So instead, I was, like‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

And maybe this is like that coffee cup. Maybe we‚Äôre dumb to try to pin significance onto every little thing. Maybe when someone says, ‚ÄúI see you,‚Äù it just means, ‚ÄúI see you.‚Äù Then again, it‚Äôs possible she wasn‚Äôt even talking to me because, if I‚Äôm being honest, she wasn‚Äôt really looking at me. She was looking just past me. There was nobody else in the room, so I want to think she was talking to me, but, honestly, she was so far gone at that point, who knows what she was seeing? Who were you talking to, Mom? \[sighs\] Not saying, huh? Staying mum? No rimshot there? God, whatever I‚Äôm paying you, it‚Äôs too much.

Maybe she saw my dad. My dad died about ten years ago of injuries he sustained during a duel. When your father dies, you ask yourself a lot of questions. Questions like, ‚ÄúWait, did you say he died in a *duel*?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWho dies in a *duel*?‚Äù The whole thing was so stupid. Dad spent his entire life writing this book, but he couldn‚Äôt get any stores to carry it or any newspapers to review it. Finally, I guess this one newspaper thought he was pretty hilarious, because they ran a review and tore him to shreds. So my father, ever the proud Mary, decided he would not stand for this besmirchment of his honor. He claimed the critic didn‚Äôt understand what it meant to be a man, so he demanded satisfaction in the form of pistols at dawn. He wrote the paper this letter, saying anyone who didn‚Äôt like his book, he would challenge to a duel, anyone in the world. He‚Äôd even pay for airfare to San Francisco and a night in a hotel. Well, eventually this found its way to some kook in Montana, who was as batshit as he was and took him up on the offer. They met at Golden Gate Park and agreed: ten paces, then shoot. But in the middle of the ten paces, Dad turned to ask the guy if he‚Äôd actually read the book and what he thought, but, not looking where he was going, tripped over an exposed root and bashed his head on a rock.

\[murmur\]

I wish I‚Äôd known to go to Jack in the Box then. Maybe I could have gotten a free churro. It would‚Äôve been nice to have something to show for being the son of Butterscotch Horseman. My darling mother gave the eulogy. My entire life I never heard her say a kind word to *or* about my father, but at his funeral she said, ‚ÄúMy husband is dead, and everything is worse now.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy husband is dead, and everything is worse now.‚Äù I don‚Äôt know why she said that. Maybe she felt like that‚Äôs the kind of thing you‚Äôre supposed to say at a funeral. Maybe she hoped one day someone would say that about her. ‚ÄúMy mother is dead, and everything is worse now.‚Äù Or maybe she knew that he had frittered away all her inheritance, and replaced it with crippling debt, which is a pretty shitty thing to leave your widow with. ‚ÄúBad news, you lost a husband, but don‚Äôt worry, you also lost the house!‚Äù Maybe Mom knew she‚Äôd have to sell all her fancy jewelry and move into a home. Maybe that‚Äôs what she meant by ‚Äúeverything is worse now.‚Äù Is that what you meant, Mom?

I gotta say, I‚Äôm really carrying this double act. At least with Penn and Teller, the quiet one does card tricks. Hey, piano man, when I say something funny to my mom, how about you give me one of those rimshots?

\[rimshot plays\]

Yeah, but not now. When I say something funny. Like, okay. What‚Äôs the difference between my mother and a disruptive expulsion of germs? One‚Äôs a coughin‚Äô fit and the other fits a coffin! That‚Äôs an example of a funny thing.

\[rimshot plays\]

Thank you. Let‚Äôs try again. Hey, Mom. What‚Äôs the difference between my mother and a bunch of Easter eggs? One gets carried in a basket, the other gets buried in a casket!

\[rimshot plays\]

Ready for one more? Last one. What‚Äôs the difference between a first-year lit major and my mother, Beatrice Horseman? One is decently read, and the other‚Äôs a huge bitch!

\[woman gasps\]

\[murmurs\]

Yeah, might have gone a little too far with that one. That one might‚Äôve been a little too ‚Äúmy mom‚Äôs a huge bitch‚Äù for the room. I‚Äôm sorry, Mother. You‚Äôre not a huge bitch. You *were* a huge bitch‚Ä¶ and now you‚Äôre dead.

\[woman sighs\]

You know, the first time I ever performed in front of an audience, it actually was, uh, with my mom. She used to put on these shows with her supper club in the living room and she used to make‚Ä¶ \[inhales\] She used to make me sing ‚ÄúThe Lollipop Song.‚Äù

\[organ playing tune\]

Those parties, they were really something. There were skits and magic acts, and ethnically insensitive vaudeville routines, and the *big* finale was always a dance my mother did. She had this beautiful dress that she only brought out for these parties, and she did this incredible number. It was so beautiful and sad. Dad hated the parties. He‚Äôd lock himself in the study, and bang on the walls for us to keep it down, but he always came out to see Mom dance. He‚Äôd linger in the doorway, scotch in hand, and watch in awe, as this cynical, despicable woman he married‚Ä¶ took flight. And as a child who was completely terrified of both my parents, I was always aware that this moment of grace, it meant something. We understood each other in a way. Me and my mom and my dad, as screwed up as we all were, we did understand each other. My mother, she knew what it‚Äôs like to feel your entire life like you‚Äôre drowning, with the exception of these moments, these very rare, brief instances, in which you suddenly remember‚Ä¶ you can swim.

\[flashback\]

\[partygoers laughing\]

\[classical music playing\]

But then again, mostly not. Mostly you‚Äôre drowning. She understood that, too. And she recognized that I understood it. And Dad. All three of us were drowning, and we didn‚Äôt know how to save each other, but there was an understanding that we were all drowning together. And I would like to think that that‚Äôs what she meant when we were in the hospital and she said, ‚ÄúI see you.‚Äù

You know, the weird thing about both your parents being dead is it means that you‚Äôre next. I mean, you know, obviously it‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs a waitlist for dying. Any one of us could get run over by a Snapchatting teen at any moment. And you would think that knowing that would make us more adventurous, and kind, and forgiving. But it makes us small, and stupid, and petty.

I actually had a near-death experience recently. A stunt went bad and I fell off a building. I‚Äôm an actor, I do my own stunts. I‚Äôm on this new show Philbert. I‚Äôm Philbert. Star of the show. It hasn‚Äôt come out yet, but it‚Äôs already getting Emmy buzz. Oh, speaking of buzz‚Ä¶ \[inhales\] I‚Äôm supposed to take two of these every morning, but my days are so screwed up ‚Äòcause of the shooting schedule, I don‚Äôt even know what morning means anymore. There‚Äôs a joke in there somewhere, about a guy who‚Äôs been to so many funerals, he doesn‚Äôt even know what mourning means anymore. Let you guys figure that one out for yourselves. \[gulps\]

Anyway, you know what I thought, when I was falling off the building and I went into panic mode? The last thing that my stupid brain could come up with before I died? ‚ÄúWon‚Äôt they be sorry.‚Äù Cool thought, brain.

\[rimshot plays\]

No, that wasn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ would you just‚Ä¶ dial it back, all right?

I don‚Äôt even know what *‚Äúthey‚Äù* I wanted to be sorry. My mom, even before she died, could barely remember who I was. And of course, my dad‚Äôs dead. The last conversation I ever had with him was about his novel. He was so certain this book was his legacy. Maybe he thought it would vindicate him for all the shitty things he ever did in his stupid worthless life. Maybe it did, I don‚Äôt know. I never read it, because why would I give him that?

I used to be on this TV show called *Horsin‚Äô Around*. Seriously, though, hold your applause.

\[man coughs\]

Well held. It was written by my friend Herb Kazzaz, who‚Äôs also dead now, and it starred this little girl named Sarah Lynn. And it was about these orphans. And early on, the network had a note, ‚ÄúMaybe don‚Äôt mention they‚Äôre orphans so much, because audiences tend to find orphans sad and not relatable.‚Äù But I never thought that the orphans were sad. I-I always thought they were lucky, because they could imagine their parents to be anything they wanted. They had something to long for.

Anyway, we did this one season finale, where Olivia‚Äôs birth mother comes to town. And she was a junkie, but she‚Äôs gotten herself cleaned up, and she wants to be in Olivia‚Äôs life again. And of course, she‚Äôs like a perfect grown-up version of Olivia, and they go to the mall together and get her ears pierced like she‚Äôs always wanted and‚Äîsorry, spoiler alert for the season six finale of *Horsin‚Äô Around*, if you‚Äôre still working your way through it. Anyway, the horse tries to warn her, ‚ÄúBe careful, moms have a way of letting you down.‚Äù But Olivia just thinks the horse is jealous, and when the mom says she‚Äôs moving to California, Olivia decides to go with her. And the network really juiced the cliffhanger: ‚ÄúIs Olivia gone for good?‚Äù But of course, because it‚Äôs a TV show, she was not gone for good. Of course, because it‚Äôs a TV show, Olivia‚Äôs mother had a relapse and had to go back to rehab, so Olivia had to hitchhike all the way home, getting rides from Mr. T, Alf, and the cast of *Stomp*. Of course, that‚Äôs what happened. Because, what are you gonna do, just not have Olivia on the show? You can‚Äôt have happy endings in sitcoms, not really, because, if everyone‚Äôs happy, the show would be over, and above all else, the show‚Ä¶ has to keep going. There‚Äôs always more show. And you can call *Horsin‚Äô Around* dumb, or bad, or unrealistic, but there is nothing more realistic than that. You never get a happy ending, ‚Äòcause there‚Äôs always more show.

I guess until there isn‚Äôt.

\[chuckles\]

My mom would hate it if she knew that I spent so much time at her funeral talking about my old TV show. Or maybe she‚Äôd think it was funny that her idiot son couldn‚Äôt even do this right. Who knows? She left no instructions for what she wanted me to say. All I know is she wanted an open casket, and her idiot son couldn‚Äôt even do that right. I‚Äôm not gonna stand up here and pretend I ever understood how to please that woman, even though so much of my life has been wasted in vain attempts to figure it out. But I keep going back to that moment in the ICU when she looked at me, and‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI-C-U.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ see‚Ä¶ you.‚Äù Jesus Christ, we were in the intensive care unit. She was just reading a sign. My mom died and all I got was this free churro.

You know the shittiest thing about all of this? Is when that stranger behind the counter gave me that free churro, that small act of kindness showed more compassion than my mother gave me her entire goddamn life. Like, how hard is it to do something nice for a person? This woman at the Jack in the Box didn‚Äôt even know me. I‚Äôm your son! All I had was you! \[inhales\]

I have this friend. And right around when I first met her, her dad died, and I actually went with her to the funeral. And months later, she told me that she didn‚Äôt understand why she was still upset, because she never even liked her father. It made sense to me, because I went through the same thing when my dad died. And I‚Äôm going through the same thing now. You know what it‚Äôs like? It‚Äôs like that show *Becker*, you know, with Ted Danson? I watched the entire run of that show, hoping that it would get better, and it never did. It had all the right pieces, but it just‚Äîit couldn‚Äôt put them together. And when it got canceled, I was really bummed out, not because I liked the show, but because I knew it could be so much better, and now it never would be. And that‚Äôs what losing a parent is like. It‚Äôs like *Becker*.

Suddenly, you realize you‚Äôll never have the good relationship you wanted, and as long as they were alive, even though you‚Äôd never admit it, part of you, the stupidest goddamn part of you, was still holding on to that chance. And you didn‚Äôt even realize it until that chance went away.

My mother is dead, and everything is worse now, because now I know I will never have a mother who looks at me from across a room and says, ‚ÄúBoJack Horseman, I see you.‚Äù But I guess it‚Äôs good to know. It‚Äôs good to know that there is nobody looking out for me, that there never was, and there never will be. No, it‚Äôs good to know that I am the only one that I can depend on. And I know that now and it‚Äôs good. It‚Äôs good that I know that. So‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs good my mother is dead.

\[gulps, sighs\]

Well. No point beating a dead horse. Beatrice Horseman was born in 1938, and she died in 2018, and I have no idea‚Ä¶ what she wanted. Unless she just wanted what we all want‚Ä¶ to be seen.

1gcb0d8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianmarriage/comments/1gcb0d8/husband_wants_me_to_be_his_source_of_all/,Husband wants me to be his source of all fulfillment ,"I need some advice if anyone has been through anything similar, but the TL;DR is my husband seems to be angry whenever I see family or friends or do anything workrelated outside the 9-5...

He doesn't tell me I can't go and he doesn't stop me, but he will give me the silent treatment for days afterwards and act hurt. We've been married 7 years, no kids. 

We've recently argued and essentially I've come to the conclusion that because he has no friends, doesn't meet up with other men from church or elsewhere, just texts a few people occassionally, he gets jealous if I get any social connection from anyone other than him. For example he says I don't love him and I put others above him, because I see my family once a week (he's always invited but never wants to go). I make an effort to spend a lot of time with him as well, we have dedicated Saturday for date day and time together. When we are together I do love him heaps, I just also need other relationships with my family/friends/work in my life (which I think is normal??).

His is introverted, but before we were married he had some friends. Now he says he gets all his social needs met at work and doesn't need other friends. He isn't very passionate about God and seems to only go to church because I want to go (he often discourages going or just says no we're not going today). He doesn't reciprocate older mens offers to do stuff together, even simpler stuff I'd like to do like going for meals etc. 

There's a massive added complication that I had a drinked spiked and was raped at an event (in my work industry) a few years ago. I've had (a lot) of therapy, but he's never taken up the offer to go. I know he thinks it was my fault for being in an environment with people who were drinking, and now he's said if anything ever happens like that again he won't forgive me. He acts like he's forgiven me for cheating, even though I was injured and there were witnesses of the assault... I was fully unconscious and incapacitated. I have stopped drinking altogether since then (it was never an issue before the assault though, I was drinking but was still in a professional capacity), and for my own mental wellbeing I do a lot of work to keep myself safe. But it feels like his jealousy and trauma are stifling us now so I can't even go and see my mum at her house for coffee without feeling guilty like I'm not loving him enough. His jealousy was always an issue though, even before the rape.

Has anyone else dealt with anything like this? I feel like an idol in his life. I really don't know what to do considering he won't go to therapy... Any good books / podcasts / YouTube / articles welcomed as resources for me to look into.

It's crazy that it took me this long to get diagnosed, but I have always experienced a lot of difficulties with focusing, managing tasks, and restlessness. Since starting law school, those issues have reached a fever pitch and I was finally able to speak with a doctor. I was prescribed 5 mg in the morning and another 5 mg in the afternoon. I plan to take my first dose on Monday, since the weekdays are the hardest for me. 

WIth that being said, my doctor did not go over any of the potential side effects with me. I plan to make a follow-up appointment, but I figured that it wouldn't hurt to ask here, too. 

To begin, I usually work out before my classes because I have found that it helps mitigate my anxiety and restlessness throughout the day. I usually do the stairmaster, paired with some light weight-lifting. I've really started to love my routine, but I'm worried about the combination of cardio and Adderall, given that it is a stimulant. I saw other posts here saying that I need to watch my heart rate while exercising and while on Adderall, so I'll keep that in mind, especially as I'm easing into taking the medication. But in the long run, can I do cardio while on Adderall? 

Second, I also typically drink 2-3 cups of coffee a day (mainly in an attempt to improve my focus and to be able to finish necessary tasks and assignments). Once I start my meds, I don't plan on drinking as much coffee, but I'm wondering if it's still safe to drink caffeine while taking the meds?

Lastly, I do have a history with binge-eating, EDs and over-eating when stressed or bored. From what I understand, Adderall can limit your appetite, but once it wears off, it can lead to increased hunger. For those who have experienced this, how have you managed it?

I've had severe depression for several years now. It all started when i was mentally abused and kicked out of the house by a family member, left to survive on my own. I held my own for a couple years, though it definitely wasnt a good time. Between unemployment and struggling to pay rent and afford food, I've been alone through it all. I lost my home and job a while ago and ended up living with another mentally abusive person who I can't handle being around, so i spend my days outside, hanging around seating areas at grocery stores and coffee shops, basically just homeless. 

I've only had online friends for about 4 years now. They got me through alotta hard periods, and I love and appreciate them for that. I'm having issues now because, well, i guess we're drifting apart, it hurts me so much to say that. One of them in particular just makes me feel so goddamn ignored and worthless. They are constantly looking for other friends, always hanging out with others and paying the most attention to everyone except me. They treat me different and the worst part is i dont think they're even aware of it. I have been the closest with this person, I was there for them through their troubles and we even planned on me moving to their country, and i was totally gonna go for it. Its been 3 months since ive been in my current shitty situation, they haven't bothered to check in on me or speak to me, even when we hang out in calls and text chats. I recently left a group chat out of frustration, accepting that I'm just not worth as much to them as they are to me. They messaged me later asking why I left, so I was honest. I told them how sad and angry i was that nobody checked on me, and that i felt forgotten.

no response. nothing. from anybody. its unbearable, feeling like I've had nobody to talk to. One day I tried to reach out because I was outside and feeling nauseous from anxiety, and I got ignored and immediately saw my friends hanging out in a call together after that. 

I've got nobody left. My mom is the only person i talk to everyday, and shes worried sick about me. Everytime we talk, it ends with us both being frustrated that things are the way they are. Everyone else has either left, is leaving, or is turning their back on me. All I want is to have a good friendship with someone. I can't handle us drifting apart. When I lost my job, I lost the best coworkers ive ever had, and they were too busy to come back to me when i reached out to them. i just dont wanna be the second, third, fourth, 300th choice. nobody gets excited to talk to me. im just another empty username in a voice chat that nobody listens to. and i sure as hell cant handle this going on any further. i dont know what to do. Ive talked about this with my friends, and felt so selfish and self centered. Even though i brought it up before, nothing changed. 

ive been told, ""ur lonely? just make new friends!! üòÇ"" How. How do i just forget friendships that lasted years and find other people? I dont wanna fucking do that, that feels so hollow and meaningless. I want to preserve what I already have because its important to me. These people mean something to me. Yeah, Im mad at them right now for how their behavior is making me feel, but i cant just let them go. especially not with what im going through. 

if you read this far, thank you. I know you're here because you probably feel the same way I do. Like theres this angry black hole inside you. Its suffocating and it feels so cold. It physically makes your heart hurt and existence feel empty. i just hope these things change for us. that eventually, we do find best friends, love, and contentment. if anyone has advice, input, or anything to say, i really appreciate it. good morning, good afternoon, and goodnight. 

TL;DR: im being abandoned, i have nobody left, i cant make new friends, i dont know what to do, im scared of being alone forever. ",1,1729908870.0,lonely,0,1.0,False
