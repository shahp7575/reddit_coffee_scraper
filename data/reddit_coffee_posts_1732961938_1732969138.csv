I am tired of relating love songs to fictional characters, and I am hoping we could change that?

  


About me: A 24-year-old gurlie living independently (big word) somewhere in the City of Manila. With the prompt I decided to go with in this post, you might think I'm a big music lover. But tbh, I'm just a casual music listener. Instead of having a vast music library in my phone, I listen to the same song over and over until I get sick of it. 



Most of my time is spent accomplishing academic tasks (I am doing postgrad). But when I am not hitting the books or doing clinical exams, you may find me exploring coffee shops, bookstores, and toy stores! I have a knack for collecting cute and random stuff. I consider myself an introvert and someone who enjoys staying indoors more. I value private time and solitude.

  


Appearance-wise, I am 5'4"" in height and is plus-size. Definitely not within the normal BMI. I have started to embrace a healthier lifestyle a few months back and although the progress is definitely slow, I try to be more forgiving because I am ultimately doing this for self-love.  I don't think I have ever been considered conventionally attractive, but I don't think I am ugly din naman. I smell good and is very particular with hygiene. 

  


About you: Same age or older than me. Not a hard rule though, just my preference. I'm also open to dating someone younger, but please not by more than 2 years hehe. I'd love it if you are the type to have a go-to song for every mood or every occasion! I also would prefer if you live nearby, so we can go explore museums and coffee shops together, or even go for walks. Some of my other interests that could be similar to yours would be: anime, manhwa/manga, and gaming. But I would also appreciate if you could share your hobbies with me, I am open to trying and discovering new things. Please be a decent person, be honest about what you want, and do not interact if you think our intentions do not align. 

  


Warning: Might over-analyze song lyrics with you on our first date!

IF so, proper usage when accelerating?","I heard DI requires finessing with the throttle that higher RPMS is actually preferred vs ""higher gears"" and lugging the engine can be bad.  What happens when it's a CVT?   I normally drive it in M for fun and engagement.  I put it in D when I'm drinking a coffee or engage the cruise control assist.   

Sometimes the engine doesn't seem its in the right ""RPM"" range and the engine feels like it's strained.  One time I gave it some beans in D and the ""RPM"" shot up so fast to like 5,000RPM.   I've grown familiar with the RPMG and response range in this car and I've noticed 3,000RPM is about where it will respond in kind.   That's where I feel comfortable giving it some beans and rewarded with the push you back in the seat confirmation.

>[$150 each stocking max](https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftIdeas/?f=flair_name%3A%22%24150%20each%20stocking%20max%22)

>My parents started getting really into hiking. They're newbies in that, but they seem to be liking it a lot! So I thought I'd theme their stockings this year around things that they could/would use during their hiking trips. So far, I have: collapsable waterbottles for both, akusoli shoe insoles, keychain powerbanks... What else could I add?

I love the theme you've got going! Hiking gifts are both practical and thoughtful, and there's a lot of room to get creative with stocking stuffers that will make their hiking trips even more enjoyable. With your budget and their new interest in hiking, let‚Äôs find items that are useful, lightweight, and well-suited for their beginner-level adventures. Here are some additional ideas that would complement the items you've already picked:

# 1.¬†Portable Camp Stove or Cooking Set

* **Why it's great:**¬†If your parents are getting into hiking, they might want to enjoy a hot meal or drink on the trail. A portable stove or small cooking set is perfect for backpacking trips, allowing them to easily heat up meals while hiking or camping.
* **Idea:**¬†[MSR PocketRocket Stove](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=msr+pocketrocket+stove&tag=gifts-favspro-20)

# 2.¬†Thermal or Wool Socks

* **Why it's great:**¬†Hiking often involves long hours on the trail, so a good pair of moisture-wicking, thermal or wool socks can make a huge difference in comfort. Look for ones that are designed to keep feet dry and warm, especially for cold-weather hikes.
* **Idea:**¬†[Merino Wool Hiking Socks](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=merino+wool+hiking+socks&tag=gifts-favspro-20)

# 3.¬†Headlamps

* **Why it's great:**¬†A lightweight, high-quality headlamp is essential for any hiker, especially for those who want to enjoy early morning or evening hikes. Headlamps are hands-free, which is perfect for cooking, setting up camp, or simply walking in the dark.
* **Idea:**¬†[Petzl Actik Core Headlamp](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=petzl+actik+core+headlamp&tag=gifts-favspro-20)

# 4.¬†Multi-tool or Swiss Army Knife

* **Why it's great:**¬†A small, compact multi-tool is always handy on the trail. Your parents can use it for everything from opening a can of beans to fixing a broken gear. A good Swiss Army knife has various features like scissors, a bottle opener, and a small screwdriver.
* **Idea:**¬†[Victorinox Swiss Army Knife](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=swiss+army+knife&tag=gifts-favspro-20)

# 5.¬†Compact First Aid Kit

# 6.¬†Pocket-Sized Trekking Poles

* **Idea:**¬†[Black Diamond Z-Poles](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=black+diamond+z+trekking+poless&tag=gifts-favspro-20)

# 7.¬†Compression Sleeves for Recovery

* **Idea:**¬†[CEP Compression Leg Sleeves](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cep+compression+leg+%2F+calf+sleeves&tag=gifts-favspro-20)

# 8.¬†Outdoor-Approved Snacks

# 10.¬†Hiking Gloves or Grip Gloves

* **Why it's great:**¬†Depending on the terrain they‚Äôll be hiking, a good pair of hiking gloves (or even grip gloves for rock climbing or rougher paths) can make a huge difference.

* **Idea:**¬†[Lifty Hiking Gloves](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=lifty+hiking+gloves&tag=gifts-favspro-20)

# 11.¬†Portable Coffee or Tea Brewer

# 12.¬†Portable Towel

* **Why it's great:**¬†After a hike, a quick-drying, compact towel is a must for cleaning up after a long trek or wiping off sweat. These towels are lightweight and dry faster than regular towels.

# 13.¬†Emergency Whistle

* **Why it's great:**¬†A small but essential item for safety on the trail. An emergency whistle is something every hiker should carry, as it could help in situations where they need attention. Choose one that‚Äôs loud, compact, and features a built-in compass or thermometer.

# 15.¬†Reflective Arm Bands or Reflective Tape

I made a thread a few weeks ago about the need of losing \~10kg in a merely 4 weeks. I promised a small update at the end of the month to the few nice people that I've exchanged messages with.

I made it! Without hunger, without problems, I made it - to be more precise, I lost 9+ kg (20lbs) in 3.5 weeks and I feel great. It was surprisingly simple:

\- I tracked my calories, no more than 1k kcal a day on off-days, 1.5k on days working out

\- I trained 3-4 times a week, mostly running

\- I ate lots of veggies (cabbage!!!) with lots of protein (chicken, chickpeas, quark, farmer's cheese), I didn't avoid sugar or sweets, I just tracked and ate smaller portions. Knoppers are your friend!

\- I drank lots of sweetened drinks, used lots of sugar-free gum, bonbons

\- Lots of coffee, tea, water, sometimes energy-drinks

\- went to sleep early, got up early, always took long walks on my off-days

\- went for a few short fasts of 36-48 hours, especially during the last two weeks; broth and multiminerals really helped

I never went hungry, I never got dizzy, I lost about 10cm of stomach-fat circumference and got really toned legs now. It's possible to lose weight and especially fat fast, don't let other people tell you otherwise. Per 1kg of body fat you can mobilize 70kcal daily, so if you are 100kg with a bodyfat-% of 40, you can easily go into a theoretical (!) deficit of 2800kcal without attacking your muscle mass, if done right. Fast weight- and especially fat-loss is possible.

I think it's really disheartening and discouraging to tell larger people that they shouldn't lose more than 1kg /2-3lbs per week, when so much more is possible. If you daily TDEE is already high, you can easily fulfill all your bodily needs in nutrients with 1k kcal and go into a 2k deficit, without hunger, without side-effects. People arround me never advised me to eat less, even when I got obese - but fasting for one or two days made some people lose their mind, like I was personally insulting them. 

Mentally I feel so much clearer and more concentrated, it really kickstarted my commitment to health again, and my energy-level is sup√©rb. This is exactly what I needed to feel more confident in my abilities, to understan me and my bodily needs better. If you have a clear goal set, if you know a few things about your body and nutrition, just go for it. ",1,1732968408.0,loseit,0,0.6,False

Hi everyone! üëã

I‚Äôm planning to create a LoRA that captures the essence of Japanese youth fashion from the mid-to-late 90s. Think baggy jeans, vibrant t-shirts, oversized blazers, sporty tracksuits, and iconic accessories like bandanas and platform sneakers. The style is super nostalgic and distinct!

I have a few questions:  
1Ô∏è‚É£ How should I structure captions for this dataset? Should I describe each clothing item in detail (e.g., ""baggy jeans, oversized blazer, platform sneakers"") or use broader terms?  
2Ô∏è‚É£ What settings would you recommend using in Kohya SS for training? For example, what are the best parameters for batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs for this kind of style?  
3Ô∏è‚É£ How many images would be enough to achieve good results? Would 500-700 diverse images with different outfits and poses be sufficient?

I‚Äôd appreciate any advice or tips! If you have examples of effective captions or experience working on similar LoRA projects, please share! üôè

P.S. If you know where to find high-quality datasets or resources related to 90s Japanese fashion, let me know in the comments. I‚Äôm sure others will find it helpful too! üòä",1,1732968393.0,FluxAI,0,1.0,False

Sometimes, customers come in really upset over small things, and it‚Äôs hard not to take it personally.

One day, a customer started yelling at me because he said his coffee wasn‚Äôt hot enough. I made it fresh and handed it to him immediately, so I didn‚Äôt know what else I could‚Äôve done. My coworker Ethan (19M), who‚Äôs the owner's son and was working as the manager that day, came over to help.

To de-escalate the situation, Ethan told the customer, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry this happened. I‚Äôll take care of it right now.‚Äù He then turned to me and said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre fired.‚Äù I was caught off guard but decided to play along and said something like, ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt fire me‚ÄîI really need this job.‚Äù

The customer immediately changed his attitude and said it wasn‚Äôt a big deal and that I shouldn‚Äôt lose my job over it. Afterward, Ethan and I laughed it off, but I started wondering if it was the right way to handle the situation.

When I told some friends about what happened, a few of them said it was wrong to let someone think they had caused me to lose my job, even temporarily. They felt it was manipulative and not a professional way to handle a rude customer.

I thought it was harmless and maybe even a good way to show people how their actions can affect others. Now, I‚Äôm not sure.

1h3b4xl,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h3b4xl/the_darkroom/,The Darkroom,"Photography had always been my passion. There‚Äôs something deeply satisfying about the quiet focus of the darkroom, the soft hum of the red light, the smell of developer filling the air as I watch an image slowly appear on paper. Film is truth to me, capturing each detail exactly as it is. But lately, the truth my camera reveals is something I can barely bring myself to face.

That's why I'm writing this now while the light is with me. I don't know how much time I have left or how much of my mind is already slipping away. It started with small things. Little jokes, I thought at first. I‚Äôd wake up and find my shoes on the bathroom counter, or my keys stashed in the fridge. A stack of books on the living room floor, arranged in a neat spiral. I knew I‚Äôd been sleepwalking, and I thought it was harmless. Maybe a little creepy, but mostly funny. I even laughed about it with friends, telling them about my ‚Äúnighttime scavenger hunts.‚Äù One of them suggested I document it, see what I got up to while asleep. I‚Äôm a photographer, after all, so it seemed like a fun idea.

So I set out my favorite camera, a Leica M3 that was given to me after my father passed away. I left it on my nightstand, and each morning I‚Äôd find a few photos on the roll, taken by my own hand, of places I didn‚Äôt remember going and things I didn‚Äôt remember doing.

At first, the photos were tame. There was one of me staring into the fridge, eyes half-closed. Another showed me standing at the bathroom mirror, expression dazed. But as the weeks went on, the photos started to get‚Ä¶strange.

One morning, I developed the latest roll and found an image of me crouched on my living room floor, staring at the carpet with a wide, tight-lipped grin. The next photo was blurry, my face pressed up close to the lens, one eye wide open and unblinking. Another showed me standing by my bedroom window in the dead of night, staring out into the street. My face looked almost blank ‚Äî no fear, no humor, just a vacant expression.

Then, two weeks later, I noticed news reports of missing children in my neighborhood. The fear I felt wasn‚Äôt rational, but it was immediate. I tried to convince myself it was a coincidence, just bad timing. But my mind kept circling back to those photos. I knew I‚Äôd been going outside. I knew I‚Äôd been leaving my apartment at night. And the camera was proof. But proof of what? Each morning, I‚Äôd develop my latest photos with a sick feeling of dread, wondering what I‚Äôd find.

One morning, the pictures made my blood run cold.

At first, it was more of the same‚Äîme standing in my hallway, my hand reaching for the doorknob. Another shot of me outside, on my street, barefoot in my pajamas, staring into the dark. But then I saw something that made my hands shake. In the background of one of the photos, just at the edge of the frame, was the small figure of a child. One of the missing children. They were standing in the shadows, half-turned toward me, their face streaked with tears.

The next shot was taken from the same spot, but closer. The child‚Äôs face was clearer now, and I could see the glistening track of tears on their cheek. Their hands were bound, and in the dim light, I could see a strip of cloth tied over their mouth, muffling their cries.

I nearly dropped the print, bile rising in my throat. I stumbled back from the table, feeling the room spin around me. This was more than sleepwalking. This was something I couldn‚Äôt even begin to understand.

Each day blurred into the next, a quiet dread settling in as I noticed how time slipped away. It crept up on me, disguised as exhaustion, until I finally saw the pattern: I was waking up later, dragging through fewer hours of daylight, only to fall into bed far earlier than ever before. My body, forced out each night under ""his"" command, was worn down. He was taking more of the day for himself, leaving me scraps of time to live in.

I leaned against the bathroom sink, staring at the reflection of a stranger. Hollow eyes stared back, ringed with dark circles that seemed bruised into my skin. My face had taken on a ghostly pallor, as though sickness itself had leeched into me, and my body ached with a deep, gnawing fatigue. The thought gripped me, cold and final: if this went on, he might consume me completely, leaving me to drift helplessly into a darkness from which I might never return.

Desperate, I stayed up for days, chugging coffee, anything to stay awake. I combed the surrounding woods, searching for any sign of them. I wandered miles each night, fueled by terror and shame. I knew I couldn‚Äôt rest until I‚Äôd found them, until I knew what I‚Äôd done. Days blurred into nights, and my body was numb, barely able to keep going. But still, I searched, unwilling to give up.

Then, just as dawn broke, I saw it. An old, decrepit hut, barely visible through the trees. I stumbled toward it, hands shaking, praying for a miracle.

Inside, the air was still and damp. In the center of the room was a small table with three tiny chairs, like something out of a child's playset. And on the table, as if waiting for me, was a single roll of undeveloped film.

I collapsed to my knees, the weight of my failure crushing me. I had been too late. The children, wherever they were, were lost to me. I sobbed until my throat was raw, my body shuddering as the last remnants of energy left me. Exhaustion finally caught up to me, and as the caffeine wore off, the darkness claimed me.

When I woke up, I was home, lying in my own bed. For a moment, I thought it might have been a nightmare. A horrible, feverish delusion. But as I made my way to the darkroom, I knew the truth. The photos were there, spread across the table, evidence of everything I‚Äôd done. The smell of developer was thick in the air, too real to ignore. And I could barely breathe as I took in the horror I had created.

My stomach twisted, and I fell to my knees, vomiting, my body convulsing with disgust. I could feel the weight of each image, each moment of terror. I gathered the photos, shoving them into an old shoebox, the edges of the prints biting into my fingers. I couldn‚Äôt live like this. I couldn‚Äôt let this monster inside me go on.

As I sit in my car outside the police station, I clutch the shoebox of photos like a lifeline. The weight of their horror presses down on me. My voice quivers at the thought of what I‚Äôll say to the officer behind the desk. Will they believe me? Or will I be written off as a madman? I don‚Äôt care anymore. I still don‚Äôt know where the children are. Where he... where I hid them. I fear they may never be found, but I can‚Äôt allow this to continue. I pray those children are still alive. I pray that the photos I have can be used to find them. And I pray more than anything that I never sleep again. ",3,1732968040.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

1h3b3gx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h3b3gx,New kitten was using box and then pooped on my husband in bed (lol),"Hello! 

So, I recently got a second Maine Coon from Russia, she traveled all the way to Michigan, United States. We've had her since November 14th. 

She was, I imagine, quite stressed from traveling such a long way. When we initially received her, typical anxious cat behavior ensued. Within the first day of having her, she pooped and puked under our bed (this was the first night after she came home, she was super hungry so she gobbled a bunch of food and then I suspect puked from stress, and had a runny few poops under the bed as well. Then another time, later in the week, she started using the box but had one little accident in our bathroom sink. This was all within the first week of her being with us. She also peed once or twice in our hamper of dirty clothes, but has stopped.

Since then, she's been using the box and adjusting more, up until this morning. Let me preface by saying I have another Maine Coon that's two years old and he is huge (not fat, just a big cat). It was an adjustment period for him, too, but they both adjusted very quickly to each other. 

I keep their boxes clean. I have an extra large enclosed box that my big MC uses and a smaller but still large enclosed box. The new girl has used both boxes. Just last night, I scooped two of her loads out of the smaller box, and she had peed in the bigger box.

Well, this morning (lmao, it's actually kind of funny) all seemed well. My husband and I wake up pretty early, I had woken up to make my coffee and feed the crew. I also have two Australian Shepherds (they all get high quality non-extruded kibble in the AM and then homemade, balanced raw diets at night). Went to put some dry food in the girl's bowl, she was scream-meowing the entire way (she's very talkative). She ate a little bit then her and my other MC began their morning antics of playing and chasing with each other. My husband was still in bed and I hear him say, ""Get outta here, girl! Not nice!"" and hear him gagging. He was still in bed but awake, waking up slowly and scrolling on his phone. He said she hopped up onto our bed and started making biscuits between his legs at the foot of the bed. She apparently was prepping her area to dump, because that's when she laid a massive load on our bed between his legs, on top of our duvet.

I picked up the poop and carried it down into the basement where both boxes are, and put the poop in the smaller box so she can keep associating it with where she goes to do her business. Spot treated the comforter and it's in the washing machine now as I type this.

Also another thing maybe worth mentioning is that she seems to have imprinted on me quite a bit, but still likes my husband. It's the other way around with my other MC, loves me to bits but has imprinted on my husband 100%. Both cats will sleep on the bed with us at night, which is another thing I find odd, that she pooped where she knows we sleep and where she sleeps, too.

So, is this something to be concerned about or is she still likely just adjusting? I've attached a photo of the cute little perpetrator in question. ",2,1732967881.0,CatTraining,0,1.0,False

Before I discovered this product, I was caught in a relentless cycle of discomfort that robbed me of my everyday joys. Every step felt heavy, every chore felt like an uphill battle, and my nights were restless with pain. I tried everything‚Äîfrom over-the-counter remedies to those ‚Äúguaranteed‚Äù natural supplements that barely scratched the surface. Honestly, I had given up hope of finding real relief.

But then, as if fate intervened, I stumbled upon a cream that promised results. Normally, I would‚Äôve scrolled right past it, but something about the natural formulation caught my eye. It wasn‚Äôt loaded with chemicals or synthetic junk; instead, it featured a list of ingredients I could actually pronounce‚Äînature‚Äôs finest allies working together in perfect harmony.

The first time I applied it, I‚Äôll admit, I was skeptical. ‚ÄúAnother gimmick,‚Äù I thought. But within minutes, there was this soothing sensation‚Äînot the overpowering kind that feels like a fire on your skin, but a gentle wave of relief. It wasn‚Äôt just masking the discomfort; it felt like it was going deeper, addressing the root of my problem. For the first time in months, I felt lighter, freer. And that was just the beginning.

The real magic unfolded over the next few weeks. Tasks that used to seem impossible, like bending down to tie my shoes or climbing stairs without wincing, suddenly became effortless. My energy levels soared because I wasn‚Äôt spending every ounce of effort battling pain. Friends started noticing, too. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre glowing!‚Äù they‚Äôd say. I was. Because I finally felt like I had control over my body again.

What amazed me the most was how clean and non-greasy the formula was. I could use it anytime‚Äîbefore heading to the office, after a long workout, or even right before bed. There was no residue, no lingering smell. Just relief, pure and simple. And it didn‚Äôt stop there. Over time, it seemed to improve not just how I felt but how I moved. My mobility improved, and those small, nagging aches that used to creep up after a long day? Gone.

But here‚Äôs the kicker‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt just about the physical relief. This product gave me my life back. I started saying yes to things I had avoided for far too long. Weekend hikes with friends, family game nights where I‚Äôd sit on the floor with the kids, even something as simple as taking my dog for an extra-long walk in the park‚Äîall those moments I had been missing out on came flooding back.

This wasn‚Äôt just a cream. It was freedom in a bottle. And it reminded me of something important: sometimes, the solution isn‚Äôt about trying harder or pushing through the pain. Sometimes, it‚Äôs about finding the right support‚Äîsomething that works with your body, not against it.

Now, I can‚Äôt imagine my life without it. It‚Äôs become a non-negotiable part of my daily routine, like brushing my teeth or drinking my morning coffee. And the best part? It didn‚Äôt require changing my entire lifestyle or committing to some grueling regimen. It just fit seamlessly into my life, helping me do more, live more, and be more.

If you‚Äôre reading this and you‚Äôre where I was‚Äînot just in pain but in that hopeless, ‚Äúnothing works for me‚Äù mindset‚Äîlet me tell you: there‚Äôs hope. Relief is out there. And sometimes, it comes in the most unexpected ways.

What truly sets this product apart isn‚Äôt just the results‚Äîit‚Äôs the science behind it. I‚Äôve always been someone who needs to understand how things work. So after seeing how much better I felt, I couldn‚Äôt help but dig deeper into what makes this cream so effective.

The first thing that stood out to me was the unique combination of 27 natural ingredients. This wasn‚Äôt some haphazard mix of trendy herbs thrown together for marketing purposes. Every single component had a purpose, backed by years of research in pain management and natural healing. Ingredients like menthol and camphor provided immediate relief by cooling and soothing the affected area, but it didn‚Äôt stop there. The deeper work was handled by anti-inflammatory powerhouses like arnica and turmeric.

Arnica, for instance, has been used for centuries in traditional medicine to reduce swelling and promote healing. It works by increasing blood flow to the applied area, helping to speed up recovery and ease discomfort. Then there‚Äôs turmeric, the golden wonder with its active compound curcumin, renowned for its potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Together, they create a one-two punch that tackles inflammation at its core.

But the innovation didn‚Äôt stop with just the ingredients‚Äîit‚Äôs also in the delivery. Most topical products sit on the surface of the skin, providing only temporary relief. This product was designed with a cutting-edge absorption technology that allows it to penetrate deeply into the muscles and joints, targeting the source of discomfort. Think of it as sending reinforcements directly where they‚Äôre needed most.

Another fascinating feature is its ability to support long-term healing. While it offers immediate relief, many of the ingredients work cumulatively. Regular use not only keeps discomfort at bay but also promotes joint health and muscle recovery. Ingredients like glucosamine and MSM (methylsulfonylmethane) are well-documented for their role in maintaining healthy cartilage and connective tissues, making this product as much about prevention as it is about relief.

And let‚Äôs talk about inflammation for a moment. Chronic inflammation is one of the biggest culprits behind pain and stiffness. This formula doesn‚Äôt just mask the problem; it actively helps to calm the inflammation that fuels discomfort. Natural oils like eucalyptus and rosemary add an extra layer of support, offering both anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial benefits to ensure the skin stays healthy while the deeper tissues heal.

Even the consistency of the cream is part of the science. The non-greasy formula allows for quick absorption without clogging pores or leaving an unpleasant residue. This is especially important because it means more of the active ingredients are absorbed into the body rather than sitting uselessly on the surface.

As someone who‚Äôs seen the incredible results firsthand, it‚Äôs reassuring to know that this isn‚Äôt just another gimmick. It‚Äôs a product rooted in science, built on a foundation of natural, proven ingredients that work together in perfect synergy. It‚Äôs rare to find something that feels this good and delivers such tangible results‚Äîand to know that it‚Äôs doing so without relying on harsh chemicals or synthetic additives makes it even better.

The more I learn about this product, the more amazed I am by its thoughtful design and powerful formula. It‚Äôs not just about providing a quick fix; it‚Äôs about helping people reclaim their lives, one pain-free day at a time. That‚Äôs what it did for me, and I‚Äôll forever be grateful for the science that made it possible.

**1. How quickly does it work?**  
From my experience, I noticed relief within minutes of applying it. The initial cooling effect was immediate, and over time, consistent use helped tackle the deeper, underlying discomfort. It‚Äôs important to note that while it provides quick relief, the best results come with regular application.

**2. Is it safe for sensitive skin?**  
Yes! One of the reasons I was drawn to this product is because it‚Äôs made from natural ingredients. There are no harsh chemicals or synthetic fillers that can irritate the skin. I have fairly sensitive skin, and I‚Äôve never experienced any redness, itching, or adverse reactions.

**3. Can it be used daily?**  
Absolutely. In fact, daily use is encouraged for those dealing with chronic pain or discomfort. Think of it as a part of your wellness routine‚Äîit‚Äôs not just for emergencies. I use it twice a day: once in the morning to start my day pain-free and again at night to relax and recover.

**4. Does it have a strong smell?**  
Not at all. While it does have a mild, fresh scent from natural oils like eucalyptus and menthol, it‚Äôs far from overpowering. The smell dissipates quickly, leaving no lingering odor, which means you can use it anytime without worrying about it being noticeable.

**5. Can it help with long-term issues like arthritis?**  
While everyone‚Äôs experience is different, I can personally say that this product has made a huge difference in managing my joint pain. The anti-inflammatory properties are particularly beneficial for conditions like arthritis, where reducing inflammation is key. Over time, I‚Äôve noticed less stiffness and improved mobility.

**6. How much do I need to use?**  
A little goes a long way. The formula is highly concentrated, so you only need a small amount to cover the affected area. This makes it not only effective but also cost-efficient, as one bottle lasts a surprisingly long time.

**7. Can I use it alongside other treatments?**  
Yes, and that‚Äôs one of its strengths. This product can complement other treatments or therapies you‚Äôre using. It‚Äôs non-invasive and natural, so there‚Äôs no risk of interference with other medications or treatments. Always consult your healthcare provider if you have specific concerns, but for me, it worked seamlessly alongside my other wellness practices.

**8. Is it messy or greasy?**  
Not at all. The cream absorbs quickly, leaving no residue or stickiness behind. This was a big plus for me because I could apply it anytime‚Äîbefore heading out, during work, or before bed‚Äîwithout worrying about it staining clothes or feeling uncomfortable.

**9. Does it come with a guarantee?**  
Yes, and that‚Äôs something I deeply appreciated. There‚Äôs a risk-free satisfaction guarantee, so if it doesn‚Äôt work for you, you can get a full refund. This gave me the confidence to try it, knowing that I wasn‚Äôt stuck with a product if it didn‚Äôt deliver results.

**10. Who is it best suited for?**  
Honestly, anyone dealing with joint, muscle, or back pain can benefit from it. Whether you‚Äôre active and dealing with post-workout soreness or someone facing chronic issues like arthritis, this product is designed to meet a wide range of needs.

She was super excited to give it to me, and I didn‚Äôt say anything at the time, but it wasn‚Äôt something I wanted or needed. Honestly, I‚Äôm not into expensive brands; I prefer practical things or experiences like concert tickets or special dinners.

I used it for a couple of days to avoid seeming ungrateful, but every time I carried it, I felt uncomfortable. I know it was a generous gesture, but I also know Carla isn‚Äôt in the best financial position. She recently bought a house and mentioned she‚Äôs been tight on money.

So, I decided to return the bag and buy something I actually needed: a new coffee maker. I also saved some of the leftover money, thinking I could use it to get her something nice later on. When Carla found out, she was really upset. She said returning it was ‚Äúinsulting‚Äù and made her feel like her gift wasn‚Äôt good enough. I tried explaining that it wasn‚Äôt personal, that I just wanted something more practical, but she didn‚Äôt take it well.

Now, some people in my family are taking her side, saying I was inconsiderate for not just accepting the gift as it was. Others have told me it was my gift, and I had every right to do what I wanted with it. Carla still isn‚Äôt speaking to me.

1h3ax1c,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1h3ax1c/is_there_anything_wrong_with_staying_disconnected/,Is there anything wrong with staying disconnected from society the rest of my life?,"I don't want to post a life story so I'll cover it quickly. While it's been a long time now, my life has generally been people disconnecting from me. In some ways I understand: I was ok to have around in a group, but I was never a ""lets go to a party"" guy and when those years started pretty much everyone dropped me including girlfriends. I certainly wasn't perfect, but I found that girlfriends would do manipulative or shitty things to me and eventually cheat, and I never retaliated in any heinous way but even just having something mean to say for how I'd been treated repeatedly resulted in no one caring what was done to me first/to cause it and the women would be welcomed back with no issue and I was ignored or dropped. Further if some disagreement occurs and it's my word/their word, virtually always people assumed I was lying unless proven otherwise. Several times in my life I've been told I naturally look mean and I agree, as an example a couple girls (who were friends with me at the time and on good terms, which is why they were ok with saying it) told me they felt like I might be a ""terrible person"" after their first impression of me but then got to know me and liked me.

I'm very average looking and most of those around me were more attractive, I've always assumed a truth of people I didn't learn until it was too late was the reason: people don't care about right and wrong, they care about what team they're on or who they benefit from siding with most.

I don't want to sound too negative, I've had a lot of friendships in my life and a fair few people who didn't treat me negatively/liked me but my closest ones in early life all ended up dropping me for someone else or going off to be friends with my ex instead.

Its been a long time since all of this happened, maybe 10 years, and most people who meet me now generally describe me as nice but that's because I don't really get too close to anyone anymore so its just the ""decency mask"" I wear (I mean its not like I'm insincere in my kindness, its just the typical human politeness though and not me connecting personally).

I haven't trusted people for a long time now, I haven't hung out with a friend in over 3 years and haven't been on a date in over 10. Just spend all my free time with my dad or sitting in coffee shops, I've worked remote since 2019 so my coworkers I chat with are online.

I had a mental breakdown about a month ago, generally about all of the people who cut me off in various ways and seeing how much they'd done with their lives since I stopped associating with them. Started anti-depressants, I'm better as of a couple weeks ago but just back to neutralness.

I'm kind of just waiting for death, whether it's taking myself out after my dad dies or just existing after that until life takes me. The breakdown makes me worry really, I'm actually kind of accepting of what I just said (I had been for years) but now I worry I'm going to have another one at some point. Idk what I'm asking here really, I guess I'm asking if it's ok not trusting people anymore and not trying to befriend anyone again. If the world doesn't trust you just based on your vibe, which means they don't really want to give you a chance and won't support you when you've been wronged, isn't the smarter move for me not to associate with anyone for my own safety?

I've tried to compare, many people I know including those I've mentioned had dealt with shittier experiences than I had before so I've been able to weigh my life as ""its not just me"". That said, cutting myself off I think has been an effort to not rack up more negative experiences. I see stories on here of ""married 4 years and 3 kids, wife cheating/leaving me"" and ""not being given a promotion bc other employee is buddies with the boss/better looking"" and I've seen enough of that in real life that it feels safer to not connect with people or work hard. The safest option seems to be working and going home. ",3,1732967147.0,self,6,1.0,False

1. ARROGANCE.
He said this was a trait he hated most in people and couldn‚Äôt stand it. but he was the most arrogant person i met. i know he was deeply insecure and afraid of being abandoned by me, but simultaneously always put himself above others, and showed off.

2. SELF IMPORTANCE
He always complained that people used him, that he was so good to people and only got used and abused. But at the same time he was always shocked when people didn‚Äôt put him first. The way he would ask random people to borrow money, and when they‚Äôd say no, he was utterly confused and angry. He expects people to bow down to him and his needs. Get angry when they couldn‚Äôt do him favours and feel like he deserved it. Complain no one is there for him. 
He also didn‚Äôt understand why i didn‚Äôt act the same. For example we are muslim and he didn‚Äôt like that my family drink alcohol around me. He told me ‚Äúif they love you they‚Äôll all stop drinking when you‚Äôre there and if they don‚Äôt they don‚Äôt care about you.‚Äù How can I stop EVERYONE doing something for ME?!

3. LAZINESS
He is the first one to help everyone around around him with anything they need. When it comes to me, he‚Äôs incompetent. Doesn‚Äôt lift a finger at home. Lives like a pig when I‚Äôm not there to clean up after him. Only ‚Äúhelps‚Äù me when he‚Äôs angry to make me feel like I‚Äôm the useless lazy one. Tells me all these house rules and instructions for my cleaning but makes it so hard for me to keep on top of it all because he‚Äôs so messy. But he‚Äôs so active in the gym, the mosque, and helping others. 

4. GENDER ROLES
He claims men must be the provider of everything and women must be in charge of the home/cleaning/cooking. I‚Äôve never pressured him to be the bread winner and married him knowing he had nothing. I agreed that women take more responsibility of the home etc, especially as I had more days off than him. He loved these strict gender roles and always made sure I was following mine strictly. And yet I was in charge of all groceries, almost half of the bills, and often had to send him money. I felt like I was taking on both of our roles. I was so lenient towards his struggles and yet he was so strict with what I was doing, I felt I was never doing enough. 

5. STINGINESS
He HATES cheap people, it makes him so angry when people are tight with their money. And yet he would bleed me dry of my university loan (my only income), and I‚Äôd be left dependent on him towards the end of the month which he would absolutely hate. Used to check my bank account and get annoyed about how much I was spending on coffee. But as soon as my uni loan entered my bank, he would be happy to go on a shopping spree with it, or use it on holliday. He would be sooo irresponsible with finances and when I tried to advise him to be careful with money, he would call me stingy and say that I care so much about money, that I‚Äôm a gold digger. It made me so confused. And when he wanted to brow money from me, I‚Äôd seem slightly reluctant because I know he‚Äôd never mention paying me back. If we were spending my money, it was easy.

1h3at0h,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1h3at0h/least_competent_coworker_promoted_to_manager/,least competent coworker promoted to manager ,"Long rant incoming. The title says it all. 
I work in a cafe/restaurant where the owners don‚Äôt have prior restaurant experience and hired two managers who don‚Äôt have managerial experience. It‚Äôs going about as well as you‚Äôd imagine. 

On top of this, they want to break down the line between foh and boh, meaning boh just has their duties but foh is expected to be able to do almost everything. if you question it or have a bad attitude about doing something that is a presumed boh duty you get talked to. üôÑ our managers‚Äô duties aren‚Äôt divided between foh and boh, they‚Äôre expected to do everything. 

We‚Äôll be extending service soon to include dinner service and they wanted to hire a third closing manager and gave us the opportunity to apply first before looking externally. I‚Äôve shared I think they should hire someone externally with a lot of experience because we need it and we need to tighten up. Instead my worst coworker (this sounds incredibly mean but it‚Äôs just factual) applied and was hired. 

By worst I mean when she closes the only thing that seems to be done is dishes washed and drawer counted. Nothing is ever restocked or organized and you basically have to close before you can open. I‚Äôve come in and countertops are still sticky with syrups. The drawer is also generally off. She has to be told what to do at every moment and it takes her forever to do it and she has to ask you 5 times how to do it. Opening is even worse. She opened all last week and I came in and the only thing she‚Äôd done in an hour was brew coffee. I‚Äôm not exaggerating. I dialed in the machine, restocked, counted the drawer, set up the station EVERYTHING and all she did was make coffee and wipe down the picnic tables. 

She also cannot separate work from her personal life and has told me about how when she‚Äôs having sex with her bf she can‚Äôt get into it bc she‚Äôs thinking about stuff that happened at work and I‚Äôm like‚Ä¶ first off, didn‚Äôt want to know, secondly ???? Who cares it‚Äôs a fucking job. I came in the day before thanksgiving and once again all she‚Äôd done is make coffee and this time she counted the register. However I didn‚Äôt make it to work early and they were already customers in the store so I had to quickly dial in and everything while customers were waiting for drinks. My annoyance quickly became rage when she asked me to read a text message she had written to another manager she doesn‚Äôt get along with that morning. She initially was in love with him when she started but the love quickly turned into enmity and now she spends her whole shifts ranting about him. I‚Äôm just like THAT‚ÄôS what you were doing for an hour when you should have been opening?

She‚Äôs been working at the cafe for a year and a half now and it‚Äôs completely bonkers to be she hasn‚Äôt been fired for her incompetence but instead got promoted. Even when she was staging for the manger position she had to ask questions about everything. I‚Äôm not sure what they see in her but she will drive this cafe to the ground I think. 

I want to leave but there was a fire at the other cafe I was looking at applying for and asking around it seems like where I work is one of the better paying spots. $13.50/hr",2,1732966690.0,barista,1,1.0,False

1h3ao61,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1h3ao61/does_the_gaggia_classic_pro_e24_come_with_a_9_bar/,Does the [Gaggia Classic Pro E24] come with a 9 bar OPV?,"My question is simple: Does the Gaggia Classic Pro E24 have a 9 bar OPV? Or, alternatively, do I need to change the GCP E24's OPV immediately to get decent shots?

Here's what WLL [has to say ](https://www.wholelattelove.com/products/gaggia-classic-e24)about it (emphasis mine):

>The Gaggia Classic has long been a favorite amongst espresso enthusiasts for its commercial-grade build quality and affordable price. The **9-bar OPV**, 3-way solenoid valve, and brass group head mean the Classic is capable of brewing espresso to¬†Specialty Coffee Association standards

Based on that, I didn't order a 9 bar spring, but now I'm thinking I should.

Using the stock, double shot, pressurized basket, a single sewing needle for WDT, with 16-18g dose and 25-30lbs tamping force, and aiming for <40g of espresso out, I can't get a shot that takes less than 12 seconds or so to pull, with pretty bitter taste. Going for even 15 seconds nets 50+g yield and watery espresso. 

I've tried about 20 variations, changing one thing at a time.

I've tried going finer and finer on the Mignon, to the point that it produces no output and then backing off a little to get what looks like a powder (no white flecks in it). That helped a little.

I've tried dropping down to 16g to avoid the central screw hitting. That helped a little.

Going to the 30lbs spring helped a little.

In all of these cases, the espresso shoots out of the spout vigorously (well wider than a vertical line, and definitely not curling back in towards the center like I see in videos of a good shot with a spouted PF).

I think despite the WLL wording it might have the 15 bar spring. The reason I think that is that:

* It's not spurting/sputtering unevenly during the shot.
* There are not usually divots in the final puck suggesting channeling.
* Espresso comes out the spout in <2seconds initially.
* It's high-flow (shoots out past vertical) from the first moment any espresso appears.

**What I'm going to try next:**

* Fresher beans (have done Lavazza that was roasted 2.5 months ago, and the Gaggia bag that WLL threw in with the purchase which lists expiration 3/2026).
* Sticking with 16g dose, which is the most I can dose and not get the central screw imprinting on the (dry/pre-extraction) shot. Trying to come up to 16g (from 15) for consistency so that I know I'm at 16.0-ish rather than 16.9-ish.
* Try going a little coarser on the dose (I read a comment that paradoxically if you're too fine you can promote channeling).
* Unpressurized basket (haven't done this yet because I didn't want to add another variable).
* ***9 bar OPV? This feels like the cause of my problems.***

**Equipment:**

* GCP E24, new and unmodded, unboxed yesterday. Stock PF and basket.
* Eurika Mignon Notte, unmodded, about 1 year old.
* Normcore V4 58.5mm, initially on 25lbs spring, changed to the 30lbs spring which slowed things down by a few seconds (9 sec shot to 12 sec shot).
* Kitchen scale that measures in whole grams (no decimal). Have a slimmer one that measures decimals arriving soon (nothing fancy, the [Weightman off Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XQS8JL6)).

**Context:**

* I have no idea what I *am* doing but have read a lot here and watched a fair bit of YouTube from Clive Coffee and Lance Hendrick, so have some idea what I *should* be doing. Still very possible that what I think is fine is too fine or not fine enough, etc. bc I have little real-world experience with a good process.
* Have owned a Breville Bambino Plus for a few years now. Didn't put much energy into learning or dialing things in, got results that were ok-ish but the pump failed on that recently and Breville support was on-brand (useless!).

# Detailed Product Analysis

At its core, the **Angelic Prayer Code** is marketed as a tool for enhancing spiritual connection while addressing practical concerns. The program includes a series of prayers designed to facilitate **faith and financial success**‚Äîa pairing that seems both ambitious and oddly specific.

Users are encouraged to engage with these prayers daily, which the creators claim can unlock blessings like improved health, **prayer-based spiritual growth**, and increased personal clarity.

Testimonials abound, many highlighting positive shifts in mindset and circumstance. Some claim newfound confidence, while others report actual financial relief. While these anecdotes are promising, the lack of independent validation keeps us grounded in a healthy dose of realism.

# My Personal Experience

Now, I'm not a particularly religious person so I enlisted the help of my Mom's friend. She's a very spiritual lady.

I gave her the **Angelic Prayer Code** and armed with her faith, she gave it a try. She said incorporating the prayers into her morning routine was easy, and she noticed an undeniable sense of calm after just a few days.

It surprised her and was refreshing to have a framework that didn‚Äôt feel overwhelming or overly preachy.

On the practical side, while she didn‚Äôt wake up to a winning lottery ticket, there was a sense of reassurance and focus that helped her tackle the usual daily grind with more confidence.

Her one gripe? A few of the claims felt a bit lofty‚Äîit‚Äôs hard to reconcile heavenly intervention with spreadsheets and budgets. Still, for what it offered emotionally, it earned its place in her routine.

Last night, I got a text from someone I was seeing last year for about 5 months. For context:

We‚Äôd, stupidly, entered in to a casual relationship and things naturally got complicated. I caught quite strong feelings for this guy, but given our difference in religious beliefs, he was adamant that he wouldn‚Äôt allow himself to get close to me like that. It didn‚Äôt stop us from seeing each other every two or three days, again stupidly, and it meant that my feelings developed and got entangled with the intimacy we were sharing.

Last October, I went to abroad for 2 weeks and we agreed to use that 2 weeks to ‚Äòseparate‚Äô and not talk. When I was back we wouldn‚Äôt see each other again. Except, I landed on vacation and he messaged me for the whole 2 weeks I was there. When I got back, we met up again the very same day. That day when we met up, I essentially asked him what this was. Was this ever going to go anywhere. He said he had feelings for me and cared for me but couldn‚Äôt see passed the religious differences. We were intimate, and Iay on his chest and almost begged him to not let a good thing go. I cried, he cried, he told me he‚Äôd miss me, that he wanted me to still message him etc. we parted ways.

A week later, I dropped a text when the dust settled to see how he was as that conversation had been really emotional for the two of us. His response was cold. ‚ÄòI‚Äôm happy with how things ended, we weren‚Äôt in a relationship so I don‚Äôt have anything to get over‚Äô. I felt sucker punched, but I left him alone. 

A few months later, in a moment of vulnerability, I reached out again and he blocked me. I‚Äôve been blocked, as far as I know, since then. It‚Äôs been painful, I‚Äôve really missed having someone there so readily, someone to talk to all day, to be intimate with, to share time with. It took me ages to dull that ache for him. Before him, I hadn‚Äôt gotten this close to a man in about 6 years. Being able to be in my feminine energy around him, for him to be responsive and communicate openly and daily with me, not ‚Äòghost‚Äô - all the bare minimum, but it‚Äôs been so long since I‚Äôve met someone who genuinely wants to give me their time, fully. 

Over the year, I poured my love in to myself. I trained at the gym, ate well, moved country and redesigned my whole life. I thought about him every single day, until about 3 weeks ago, when the thought of him didn‚Äôt niggle so much. 

Fast forward to last week. I noticed I was unblocked as he appeared on my suggested friends on instagram. I didn‚Äôt do anything about it, just left it. I started to feel like I was actually moving on from it. I didn‚Äôt feel inclined to reach out as he‚Äôd blocked me and he was the one who was adamant he couldn‚Äôt be with me. 

Last night, I woke up about 3am to a message he‚Äôd sent me. He‚Äôs in the UK so he‚Äôd sent it in the evening his time. He‚Äôd replied to a story I‚Äôd put out asking if any of my friends in London had a gym pass I could borrow for the 2 weeks I‚Äôm there, and he just replied ‚Äòyou can use mine‚Äô.

I hesitated, but against my better judgement I responded. I wanted to, I wanted to hear him say he‚Äôd made a mistake and he wanted to pursue me and nothing would stop us. Except he didn‚Äôt.

After tentatively responding and checking to see if he was drunk (he wasn‚Äôt), we got in to a very long conversation. He said he didn‚Äôt want to cause me upset or aggro or to antagonise me, he just wanted to check in on me. Turns out very soon after we separated, he found a girlfriend. An actual girlfriend, one he committed to. They‚Äôd broken up last month.

The gist of the conversation was that he didn‚Äôt miss me, he‚Äôd just thought of me from time to time and hoped that I was doing well as I ‚Äòdeserved‚Äô it. That I was always kind to him and he felt guilty about that. He wanted to cheer me on from afar. He then asked several times, which I declined, to meet up for a drink or coffee to catch up as ‚Äòold friends‚Äô.

As you can imagine, this has left me reeling.

In the silence after we went our separate ways,  I‚Äôd formed in my head that perhaps he had missed me, perhaps he‚Äôd come back and realise what we had developed. He himself had said to me he had feelings for me! Surely with time he‚Äôd see that it was worthy to fight for. 

Instead I now know that he moved on within weeks, in to a whole relationship. He‚Äôd committed to someone else, when he couldn‚Äôt to me. He‚Äôd been intimate and loving with someone else. Given this person everything I wanted. That he didn‚Äôt miss me, but instead I feel like he pitied me. That he was checking in as he was worried I hadn‚Äôt found my happiness, as he so put it.

I‚Äôve spent a year almost mourning the loss of a man that is the closest I‚Äôve been to a man in years, to now just be yanked back in to feeling like I wasn‚Äôt enough for him then, and I‚Äôm not enough for him now.

I feel sick to my stomach, anxious, and almost like my heart has broken again.

I don‚Äôt understand why he reached out just to ‚Äòcheck‚Äô on me and to make it clear that he doesn‚Äôt want what we had anymore. He could have just left me alone.

can drinking caffeine every day can cause natural miscarriage? I've search it a lot on google and it says its one of the things that pregnant woman should avoid during their pregnancy since it might lower the development of the fetus and cause miscarriage. is that true? 

I did the deed without any protection nor taken any pills since i don't have a bf and did it only for money, and im afraid to get pregnant to some unknown man child. what should i do? i also didn't take the test yet since it might be too early and its still a week since i did it. We actually did during the week of my period was going to happen and I didn't get my period, its two days late. I've been drinking ginger tea, i also bought a contraceptive pills (the micropill one) and also started drinking instant coffee 300 mg. i hope u could give me some advice tho.",1,1732965434.0,amipregnant,3,1.0,False

She wanted them all here for her final moments, for Iris felt she would soon pass away from this world. Her family members took turns speaking with Iris and spending time with her. Colton, her oldest grandson, was the last to enter her room.



""Colton, please have a seat,"" Iris spoke softly, her voice hoarse, motioning to a chair.



""How are you feeling, grandma?"" he asked, sitting with a frown.



""I'm alright, but I need to tell you something."" Iris then added, ""Something very important.""



""Should I go get Mom? ""Colton said, going to stand, and his grandmother shook her head.



""No, this is something I want to tell you only.""



Iris smiled, and he leaned back in his chair and nodded. ""Okay. What do you want to tell me?""



A sigh of relief escaped his grandmother's lips as she began to tell her story.



When Iris was growing up, her only companion was her father since her mother had passed away when she was young. As she got older, though, her father fell for a woman in their small town. Iris knew her father wouldn't be alone forever and had to accept that he would start dating again.



This *woman,* however, made Iris's skin crawl.



But she was willing to push that aside if her father was happy.



Or until one night when Iris suddenly awoke from a deep sleep. She saw Vidya, her father's girlfriend, walk past her open bedroom door and down the hallway, her eyes glowing. Sitting upright in bed, Iris watched this woman approach her father's bedroom.



Slowly getting out of bed, Iris tiptoed quietly down the hall,



She stopped watching from her father's open doorway. His girlfriend is standing at the end of his bed, just staring at him. Taking a step back, the floorboard under her foot creaked, and Vidya snapped her head in the direction of the sound.



Cursing, Iris tried to sink into the hallway's darkness as much as she could. The woman smiled, mouthing, ""*I see you.""* Before Vidya could follow her, Iris ran to her room and hid under her covers, only having a tiny opening to peep out of.



A thudding of footsteps came down the hallway, stopping at Iris's open door.



""Iris,"" a voice called to her in a hiss.



*Go away, Go away, Go away.*



Closing her eyes as tightly as she could. Iris prayed that Vidya would leave. There was a *tsk,* and Vidya clicked her tongue in disappointment.



The woman left her doorway, and Iris peeked her head out, sighing in relief. Vidya had left. Why had she been here in the first place?



In the morning, Iris spoke to her father about what had occurred last night.



""Dad, did you invite Vidya to spend the night?""



""Hm? No, I didn't. Why do you ask?""



""She was here last night.""



Her father furrowed his brow and lowered his coffee cup.



""What do you mean she was here?"" he asked confused.



Iris fidgeted in her seat, looking down at the table.



""Last night, I saw Vidya inside the house. She walked through the halls and stood at the foot of your bed, her eyes glowing yellow.""



Her father laughed. ""Her eyes were glowing? Iris, you had to be dreaming.""



""But I wasn't!"" she stood, slamming her hands on the table. The medium-sized round table shook, causing her empty glass to topple over and roll. Iris's father stood to his full height, shadowing over her. ""Go to your room,"" he instructed.



She knew without even looking at his face that he was angry.



Without a word, she turned, leaving the dining room and upstairs into her bedroom. Iris shut her door and screamed into her hands, frustrated. How could she prove that Vidya was here?



She paced the carpeted floor of her bedroom, running her hands through her hair, rattled with nervousness. An old cam recorder belonged to her mother in the attic; she could set it up and catch Vidya entering their home.



Then, her father would have to believe her.



Right?



Hearing the front door close signaled that her father had left. Iris snuck out of her room and up the stairs into the attic. Going through the boxes with her mother's name on them, she found the old cam recorder and the charging cord.



Now, she had to find out where to set it up without her father finding it and taking it down. That night, they ate dinner silently, neither wanting to speak to each other. As she put her dishes in the sink, her father said goodnight, and she went to her room.



Iris settled into bed and slept, feeling mental and physical exhaustion wash over her. This night would be the last time she would see her father. Looking back on it, Iris wished she had at least said *I love you* one last time.



She was awoken by the sound of crunching and slurping. A gurgling sound was coming from down the hall. Iris's heart thumped in her chest as she scrambled out of bed and grabbed the hidden camera. She crept slowly down the hall, her breathing ragged, tip-toeing towards her father's room.



Aiming the camera inside, she pointed it into the darkness. Looking through the lens, she saw it. Vidya was eating her father.



She was tall and hunched over her fingers, long with talons for fingernails. Vidya's bloody mouth was full of rows of sharp teeth with pieces of flesh stuck between them. Her head cocked to the side, listening as she chewed, and then it jerked in Iris's direction.



Iris held her breath and hoped Vidya would not see her, but she was wrong. The woman stood upright, and what looked like feathers stuck around her as she approached the door.



She needed to run away from Vidya, so she did, with the camera tucked under her arm. Iris ran down the stairs as her father's bedroom door burst open, and a wrapped cry escaped the woman who chased after her.



The young girl just needed to get out the front door and make her way to the neighbor's house, and she would be safe. She got swatted like a fly into a wall, which caused her to drop the camera.



Iris needed to defend herself, fumbling around in the dark. She was able to grab the baseball bat her father kept behind the door in case of intruders and swung with all her might.



*Twack Twack Twack*



Each time the young girl swung, the bat made contact, making a sickening, wet, and crunching sound. Iris opened her eyes, which she didn't know were closed, and dropped the bat from her hands. There on the ground was Vidya's mangled form.



Colton was on the edge of his seat as his grandmother paused.



""What happened after that?"" he asked.



""I called the police, and they came to the house to investigate. A pair of detectives named Pierce and Morrison took Vidya's body away. Along with the cam recorder. My home turned into a giant crime scene."" Iris replied.



Colton became silent as he watched his grandmother close her eyes.



""I lost my father that night all because of that monster."" her voice was a low whisper now.



""Grandma?""



""I'm alright, my boy. I'm just exhausted. Will you tell your mother to come sit with me?"" Iris requested.



Colton nodded and stood from his chair, walking towards the door.



He looked over his shoulder at his grandmother before entering the crowded room of people soaking in what she had told him.



Had all of this really happened to her?



What was that creature that she saw?



As he approached his mother, Colton, she was standing with someone he didn't know. Everything about this man was clean-cut and perfect, yet something about his smile stretched unnaturally.



His mother introduced him as Iben.



""Grandma wants you,"" Colton interjected before his mother could explain who Iben was further. She blinked in surprise and nodded, apologizing to the man, who shook his head and watched as she walked away. Iben's expression changed to that of a predator being interrupted from a meal.



""I don't know who you are, but **stay away** from my mother,"" Colton warned. Iben simply laughed, crossing his arms. His eyes had a sheen of gold to them. He leaned in close to the young man, his voice barely above a whisper, ""Your mother will be next, just like how my sister was taken away from me. I'll take away someone of equal value.""



Colton swallowed the hard lump in his throat, standing before the man unflinching. The young man would face Iben head-on if it was a fight he wanted then it was a fight he was going to get.



Like his grandmother, he would defeat this creature and save his mother's life even though Iris had failed to save her father.

1h3ahpd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1h3ahpd/dreaming_of_my_grandfather_death_the_night_he_died/,"Dreaming of my grandfather death, the night he died.","Hello, i'm posting this because i'd like to know what you think about this dream. I never have been a ""spiritual"" person, nor i have belived in stuff that's not-scientific or parascientific, but this dream i made 1.5 years ago left me quite stunned.

On the 29th February 2023 at 5.15am my grandfather (my father's father) died in his house. He was ill, but for a very long time he has been, and his condition was stable, so nobody of us ever tought that he was going to die that soon. It was not a ""called"" death.

That morning i woke up at 6am as usual, and i woke up in tears, because before waking up, i dreamt of a fake awakening, where everything was ""real""; i woke up, got out of the bed, i walked into my mother's room and here she said ""your grandfather died"", then i started crying and i woke up in the ""real world"".

When i woke up for real, i got out of my bed, went into the kitchen to prepare my breakfast and while i was making the coffee, my father calls my mother (they're divorced and he lives in a foreign country) and he tells her that his father died. My mother called me into her room and in the same way as the dream she told me that my grandfather died that night.

I was shocked, not because of his death (i was not that close to him so i was okay-ish) but because of the dream. I immediately went into the bathroom and went to the mirror and stared into my eyes for i think 5 minutes, till my mother called me again to ask me if i was okay.

Scientifically, i do think this a coincidence, but is it? It's too strange and too ""perfect"" to be just that. I would like to hear your opinions.

1h3agta,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1h3agta/aio_my_sister_going_through_my_dads_notebook/,AIO my sister going through my dad's notebook? ,"Sorry in advance for the rant/ramble, still trying to make sense of this.

For some context: my dad is an avid notebook-keeper. He keeps several at a time, one of which is primarily used for his daily to-do lists and schedules. He keeps this with him and sometimes leaves it in various places around the house (perhaps implying that he is not very protective over it). This has existed my entire life. 

So I (21f) went home for Thanksgiving. Tonight, my dad left his notebook, shut with his pen on top, on the coffee table and went to bed. Later that night, me, my sister (19f), my brother (18m), and my mom were hanging around talking. At one point, I noticed that my sister had picked up my dad's notebook and was flipping through it. I ignored it for a bit, but it was honestly really bothering me. So I finally said, ""Hey, that's not yours. You probably shouldn't be going through someone else's notebook."" I probably had a little bit of an attitude in my voice, especially because at first she barely even acknowledged me, and so I said ""That is not yours, I think you should put that down"" a bit firmer. My brother and sister (hereafter referred to as ""they, them, their"" etc.) look at me like I'm crazy. And, in my perspective, immediately jumped on the defense of why what she was doing was perfectly fine. Sister specifically spent about 5 minutes defending it (which she later denied doing altogether) - ""He leaves it laying around, it's just his schedule and he's just my dad it's fine."" I maintained my stance - saying to her, ""That doesn't matter, it's the principle of the thing. It is not yours, and that is not something you do. It is an invasion of privacy to look through someone's stuff."" At this point I would say they started getting heated, acting just completely flabbergasted and getting mad that I would make this point. I made the argument that I would never go through so much as my roommate's space in the fridge, let alone her notebook. And I would be very upset if I found out that someone had gone through my stuff just because I left it on the dining room table when I was in a rush to leave (and my roommates would also never do this. it would be super weird). They say it's different because it's family. Honestly that makes me feel kind of uncomfortable about being in this family then, and I said that. I have been reiterating and staying firm in my stance this whole time. Eventually, it changes into them making the argument that since it was left in a common area and not locked or particularly protected, it was fair game, and this applies to most things and most people. Even going so far as to say that people should *expect* for their stuff to be gone through in that type of situation and the person who left it has no room to be angry for that (and they would expect this for themselves in this situation and therefore be okay with it when it inevitably happens). This blew my mind. They went on to basically say that unless someone makes sure something is completely locked down and made completely inaccessible, it is normal and expected for that thing to be read/used/gone through/violated. They said yes, if you leave your purse out you should expect it to be rummaged through - and you must be okay with it. And that goes for doors to bedrooms, computers, even phones if there's no passcode (who in their right mind sees a phone, checks if it has a passcode, and goes through it just because it's there? I was scolded by a bf for glancing at a locked phone that had been left at our table at a restaurant once). They fought tooth and nail to die on this hill. They were adamant that this was a normal, agreed-upon, and okay thing to do and I was the crazy one. Sister said, ""I guess you just aren't curious."" (?????) Brother eventually repeatedly told me to ""shut the f\*ck up"" before storming off. Sister settled on us having ""differing opinions."" My mom did not say a lot in the moment (she didn't have much of a chance), however, when it was all over, she came to me and agreed with me. And on that note, this is absolutely NOT how I was raised. I have never ever gotten the impression that this was an okay thing to do. My mom went through my stuff sometimes when I was in high school and doing nefarious things, but she was always apologetic and clear that it was for my safety. She said tonight that she would never think of looking in my dad's notebook, even as his wife. Neither of us understood where this was coming from from them. Also (maybe?) important to note that after thinking about it, this has kind of been a thing for my brother since he was young - I'd often find him going through my mom's phone because she didn't have a passcode. And even then I remember being weirded out, but I guess I didn't say much about it. I'm digging my heels in especially after how I was treated and spoken to just for defending someone's reasonable right to privacy. I haven't spoken to either of them and I don't really plan on it. I have half a mind to go through all their stuff before leaving. But are they right? Am I overreacting? Am I really the crazy one here?? Is that a normal thing for people to do and I should just expect people to look through my stuff unless it's padlocked???? 

TLDR: I noticed my sister going through my dad's notebook, I got upset, and she and my brother argued that it is normal and expected for anything left in common areas to be gone through unless it is particularly protected. I argued that this is a complete violation no matter the level of protection or the circumstance. It got heated - am I overreacting? ",1,1732965216.0,AmIOverreacting,3,0.67,False

# Rentals in Toronto: A Comprehensive Guide to Finding Your Dream Home in 2024

Toronto, a city renowned for its cultural diversity, economic opportunities, and vibrant neighbourhoods, remains one of the most sought-after rental markets in Canada. As we dive into 2024, the Toronto rental landscape is evolving, offering renters more opportunities and insights than ever before. Whether you‚Äôre a student, a professional, or a family, understanding the latest rental trends and tools can make your search for a home seamless and inspiring.

# Toronto Rental Prices in 2024

Good news for renters: Toronto has seen a slight decline in rental prices this year.

* **One-bedroom apartments**: Average rent is $2,499 (down 5% compared to 2023).
* **Two-bedroom apartments**: Average rent is $3,216 (showing a similar decrease).
* **Unfurnished one-bedroom units**: Averaging $2,248, marking a $113 drop year-over-year.

While these figures are a positive shift for renters, it‚Äôs important to note that downtown areas remain pricier, with neighbourhoods like Bay Street Corridor still commanding premium prices. For those seeking affordability, suburban areas like Scarborough or North York offer more budget-friendly options.

# Market Trends and Supply in 2024

Toronto‚Äôs rental market is currently defined by two key factors: strong demand and increasing listings.

* **Demand drivers**: Record immigration, population growth, and a challenging ownership market have bolstered the rental market.
* **Increased options**: A 51.3% rise in rental listings has given renters more choice and negotiating power, leading to slightly lower average rents.
* **Concerns**: Purpose-built rental construction has dropped by 40% compared to last year, signaling potential supply challenges in the future.

This balance between growing demand and increased listings makes 2024 a prime year for renters to secure better deals.

# Toronto‚Äôs Best Neighbourhoods for Renting in 2024

Finding the right neighbourhood is key to loving your rental experience. Here are some standout areas:

* **Downtown Core (Bay Street Corridor)**: Ideal for professionals working in the financial district. Walkable, vibrant, and close to transit‚Äîbut comes with a higher price tag.
* **Liberty Village**: A trendy hub for young professionals, featuring modern condos, coffee shops, and a lively nightlife.
* **North York**: Family-friendly with affordable options and excellent schools.
* **Scarborough**: A hidden gem for budget-conscious renters seeking suburban charm and access to nature.
* **The Annex**: Perfect for students and academics with its proximity to the University of Toronto and cultural vibe.

# Tips for Renting in Toronto

2. **Set Your Budget**: Consider rent, utilities, and transportation costs when planning your finances.
3. **Negotiate Smartly**: With rising listings, landlords may be open to negotiation‚Äîdon‚Äôt be afraid to ask for discounts or concessions.
4. **Explore All Options**: Check platforms like [Rent-Life.ca](http://www.rent-life.ca) for diverse listings tailored to your needs.

# Future Outlook for Toronto Rentals

While rental prices are down slightly, long-term challenges remain, including limited new construction and high demand. Analysts predict rents will stabilize throughout 2024, supported by strong immigration and economic growth. This means now is the perfect time to secure a rental before prices potentially rise again.

unfortunately, when I get home, I become very hungry and munch on carbs (bread, rice or spaghetti) which is awful ikr but I didn't realise that I'm doing so only after I finish my plate which is way too late .. and I noticed that I crave sweets so much nowadays that I can eat 2 biscuit packets (each has 6-8 pieces) , I wasn't like that before idk why actually and I feel so bad

I'm on the lookout for someone ordinary ‚Äì someone who can be my partner-in-crime, my confidant, and maybe a bit more, if everything works out. But I'm not in a hurry. I believe in taking things slow, like taking our time to build a connection and get to know each other.

So, what exactly am I seeking? Well, I crave deep conversations and witty banter. I want someone who isn't afraid to open up to each other's emotional insecurities, trauma, let's just try to be real with each other, also someone who can match my curiosity and sense of humor (the darker the better). 

When it comes to interests, I appreciate art of all kinds, I have a deep appreciation for psychedelic art and music. I'm a big arsenal football club fan, also I'm a huge mental health advocate, let's be kind to each other. I enjoy watching critically acclaimed TV shows. I'm fueled by coffee and driven by guilt. Currently on a fitness journey, Trying to be regular at the gym and eating healthy, I would love it If we could exchange healthy cooking recipes.

But enough about me ‚Äì I'm very much interested in learning about you. Your likes, icks, tics and everything else. Let's even share our playlists. I would be more than happy it if you could give skin care and hair care tips. 

So, if you're up for intellectually stimulating conversations, sharing funny anecdotes, a genuine connection that transcends the superficial and dives deep into the essence of our beings or simply enjoying the silence of a comfortable conversation, I'm here for it all. Shoot me a DM if you relate and seek something similar.

Fog is pretty common in our area. We live in a little valley and the fog just sort of pools here, especially in the early morning. But this fog‚Ä¶ this was¬†*different.*

For one, it was incredibly thick. When I let Tucker (our dog) out for his morning bathroom break, he sprinted into the backyard‚Äîand completely disappeared.

""Tucker?""

Our backyard is big, but not¬†*that*¬†big. I could hear him pawing around in the grass, but I couldn't see him‚Äîor the far side of the fence.

Of course, my kids loved it. ""Cool!"" Adrian yelled. ""It's like we're living in a cloud!"" Emma said.

I was less thrilled. I could hear the cars roaring by on the main road, less than thirty feet from our front door. But I couldn't see them. And, probably, they couldn't see us.¬†‚ÄúThat's a¬†*lot*¬†of fog. Really dangerous to be driving right now,‚Äù I said.

""Reminds me of that time up in Maine,"" my wife started.

Ah, yes. The Maine fog story I'd heard a hundred times. That's what marriage is, basically: repeating the same stories to each other until one of you dies.

""It was like pea soup, and I‚Ä¶""

I pulled back the curtain and peered out the window. Okay, I could see the wind spinners ten feet from the door. And the outline of our row of privacy shrubs. And maybe, if I squinted‚Ä¶ I could see the soft outline of the cars passing. But nothing beyond that.

""*Wham!‚Äî*I crashed into a tree. Well, it was a tiny one, little more than a sapling, really‚Ä¶‚Äù

I turned around. The kids were crowded around the sliding glass door with Tucker, watching the fog. They were ready to just jump out there. I wasn't sure I liked that.

""And even the tow truck couldn't find me!"" Mary broke into laughter‚Äîshe always did at the end of the story. I forced a laugh, too, pretending I was listening.

""Daddy? Can we go outside?"" Emma asked, tugging at my hand.

""I don't know‚Ä¶""

""*Please?*""

""Fine. Okay."" As soon as I opened the door, they rocketed outside. And disappeared. Sighing, I ran out after them, blindly maneuvering through the white.

Wait.

Where¬†*were*¬†they?

I stood in the backyard. Thick fog surrounded me. I couldn't see the back door anymore. I spun around, squinting at the hazy outlines of the picket fence, trying to orient myself. ""Adrian? Emma?

""We're over here!"" came Emma's voice, somewhere to my left.

I breathed out a sigh of relief and stepped to the left. And there it was‚Äîright there‚ÄîEmma's and Adrian's playhouse. Weird. I'd been picturing myself more to the right, where Mary used to grow roses a few years ago.

""This is a house on top of a giant cloud,"" Emma proclaimed. ""This is a flying scooter!"" Adrian yelled, making¬†*whoosh*noises as he pushed the scooter through the mud.

I sat on the damp grass, watching them closely as they played.¬†Two hours later, the fog was as thick as ever. Usually in this area, the fog slowly dissipates as the sun rises.

But not this time.

At 9 AM, the fog was still a thick white blanket, obscuring everything that was more than twenty feet away.

And that's when I realized something else.

Our backyard faces a row of other backyards. The one three houses to the left has this pair of yappy little white dogs (don't ask me what kind, they all look the same to me.) Yapping away at this or that constantly.

This morning, they were completely silent.

*I guess everyone's inside.*¬†Then I frowned.¬†*Maybe they're inside for a reason. Maybe they know something I don't.*

I quickly pulled out my phone and shot a text off to a few of our neighbors. Five minutes passed, then ten. No one replied. Did a few Google searches with our town name and ‚Äúfog,‚Äù ‚Äúmist,‚Äù ‚Äúweather.‚Äù Nothing about it online. I sat in the grass, watching Emma and Adrian play inside, idly twirling the phone between my fingers.¬†¬†

Mary appeared out of the fog, her silhouette slowly darkening as she stepped towards us. ‚ÄúYou want to take your morning run? I can watch the kids.‚Äù

‚ÄúUh, no. It‚Äôs too foggy.‚Äù

She quirked an eyebrow at me. ‚ÄúI thought you committed to exercising every day.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, but these are extenuating circumstances.‚Äù

‚ÄúFog? I could see rain, or snow‚Ä¶ but¬†*fog?‚Äù*

Dammit. I‚Äôd made Mary my accountability partner in getting fit, after chasing the kids for more than ten minutes would leave me panting for air. And she was not easy on me. ‚ÄúFine,‚Äù I grumbled.

She smiled smugly.

I went inside and put on my workout clothes, then left. The fog was just as bad in the front yard as it was in the backyard. I crossed the driveway‚Äîthen stopped.

*Huh?*¬†Usually, when there was such thick fog like this, our cars would be covered in a thin coating of glistening mist. But today, they looked dry as a bone.

*Weird.*

I turned down the sidewalk and continued down, away from the main road. My pounding footsteps were loud in the silence. Houses loomed through the fog like colossal monsters, slowly fading into view.

Then I heard whistling. A clear melody, cutting through the fog. It took me ten more paces until I saw the source‚Äîold Mr. Frank Cambry, out working on his yard.

‚ÄúHey, Jared!‚Äù he called as he saw me.

I slowed to a stop. ‚ÄúHey. What‚Äôs up with this fog, huh?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh. I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù He shrugged, then brought the pruning shear back up to the shrub.¬†*Snip.*¬†‚ÄúWe‚Äôve always got fog.‚Äù

Frank was constantly working on his lawn. It was the pride of his home. Some men like their cars, or computers, or a man cave in the basement. This guy loved his lawn. His bushes were always pruned, his grass always a vivid shade of green, even in the fall.

But still. Working on the lawn in extreme fog? A little weird, even for him.¬†Then again, I was the one jogging in it.

‚ÄúIt usually lets up by now, doesn‚Äôt it? It‚Äôs almost 10 AM.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt take his eyes off the shrubs.¬†*Snip, snip.*¬†‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know about that,‚Äù he said, noncommittally.

‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs really¬†*thick*¬†fog. Like thicker than usual. You don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs weird?‚Äù

‚ÄúNope.‚Äù

Then he started whistling again, as if to signal the conversation was over.

*Kind of rude,*¬†I thought, glancing at him. Then I continued running, down the sidewalk, taking my usual loop around the neighborhood. The houses passed by me, all dark, all quiet.

I was about ten houses down when the whistling stopped.

It didn‚Äôt slowly fade away, like I‚Äôd expect it to as I walked out of range. And it didn‚Äôt cut off abruptly, either, as if Frank had decided to stop whistling.

No‚Äîit had quickly faded into silence. Like someone turning the dial down on a radio.

*Huh, that‚Äôs kind of strange.*¬†But I continued running down the sidewalk, thinking nothing of it. It was so surreal‚Äîthe houses across the street were blurred and washed out, gray silhouettes with no detail. Several feet in front of me, the sidewalk faded into white nothingness.

*Where the sidewalk ends.*¬†Maybe in seconds, I‚Äôd be careening off the edge of the world, into a void of nothingness.

*What a happy thought.*

As I got close to home, the sharp barks of two yapping dogs jolted me from my thoughts.¬†*Ah, finally, my old yappy pals.*¬†I kept running, my legs aching, lungs burning‚Äî

And then I froze.

Just like the whistling, the barking stopped.¬†A quick fade-out. Like someone turning down the dial of a radio.

My heart sank.¬†*There is something really weird about this fog. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ muffling sound? What the fuck is going on here?*¬†And I thought of Mr. Cambry. His rudeness about it all.¬†*Does he know something I don‚Äôt?*

I sprinted back to the house. Ran out into the backyard, pulled Mary aside. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something really weird going on. Let‚Äôs get the kids inside.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut they‚Äôre having so much fun.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, well.‚Äù I opened the playhouse door, reached my hand inside, and grabbed Emma‚Äôs arm. ‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù I said, pulling her gently. ‚ÄúWe need to get inside.‚Äù

‚ÄúNooooo, I don‚Äôt want to!‚Äù

‚ÄúToo bad. We need to‚Äî‚Äù I stopped. ‚ÄúEmma. Where‚Äôs Adrian?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

‚ÄúMary! Where‚Äôs Adrian?‚Äù

‚ÄúI thought he was in the playhouse with Emma.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, he‚Äôs not!‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs got to be in the backyard,‚Äù Mary said, plainly. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why we have the fence.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe knows how to open the gate. You know that!‚Äù How could she be so calm?! ‚ÄúAdrian? Adrian, where are you?‚Äù I shouted.

My heart dropped as I whirled around, searching for any trace of him. A muddy trail from scooter wheels. Footprints. A little silhouette. But there was nothing‚Äîonly fog. Adrian was only 4; he didn‚Äôt have the sense that Emma had. The sense not to talk to strangers. Or walk into the road.

Oh my God. The road.

Cars roaring by, in thick fog, that wouldn‚Äôt see him‚Äîuntil it was too late.

I ran blindly through the white, up the side yard. The gray silhouette of the gate slowly faded into view.

*No.*

It was open.

‚ÄúAdrian!‚Äù I screamed. ‚ÄúAdrian, where are you? Come back here! Right now!‚Äù

Oh, God. The fog made this impossible. He could be running into the road right now, and I wouldn‚Äôt know.

‚ÄúAdrian!‚Äù I screamed, running wildly.

And then‚Äîjust like the whistling‚Äîa sound faded into my ears.

*Thump. Thump. Thump.*

My heart dropped. ‚ÄúAdrian!‚Äù I screamed, running towards the sound.

The silhouette slowly came into view. Adrian, at the far end of our front yard. Standing in the corner between the side of the house and the picket fence.

Slowly bashing his head into the fence.

*Thump. Thump. Thump.*

‚ÄúAdrian!‚Äù

He took a step. Smacked his head into the wooden fence.¬†*Thump.*¬†Feet slid back in the mud. Took another step.¬†*Thump.*

‚ÄúAdrian!‚Äù I grabbed him by the shoulders and pulled him away. ‚ÄúWhy? Why are you doing that?‚Äù

He looked at me blankly. There was a swollen lump on his forehead, already darkening with a bruise.

‚ÄúAdrian?‚Äù

He broke eye contact. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù he muttered to the ground.

‚ÄúWere you trying to hurt yourself?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. I was... trying to get back to you and Emma and Mommy.‚Äù His lip quivered. Then he threw his arms around me and squeezed, holding on tight. ‚ÄúBut I‚Ä¶ I got lost.‚Äù

*Got lost? In the fog?*¬†I glanced around. The fog was bad, but clearly he could see the fence a few feet in front of him. Him repeatedly smacking into it was deliberate.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, Adrian. It‚Äôs okay. Do you want to go inside and get some chocolate milk?‚Äù

He nodded.

I walked him back inside, holding his hand tightly. Reassuring him that everything was okay, that it was all better now.

But everything was definitely¬†*not*¬†okay.

¬†

\*\*\*

¬†

The fog was still there when the sun set.

The four of us sat around the dinner table, eating quietly. Not much to say. Emma was still sulking about outside playtime being cut short, and Adrian just looked around with a listless, empty gaze. My wife attempted to fill the void with rambling conversation a few times, but it never picked up.¬†

*Thump. Thump. Thump.*

That horrible sound repeated in my head. Over and over again. Adrian was a wacky kid, and he didn‚Äôt always look out for his safety. He was fond of doing risky things, like jumping off the sofa, spinning in the office chair, climbing on things‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôd never seen him¬†*intentionally*¬†hurt himself.

*Thump. Thump. Thump.*

And the dazed look in his eyes, when I‚Äôd stopped him. It was like I‚Äôd woken him from a trance. He was trying to get back to us, and he‚Äôd gotten lost in the fog? So he decided to pound his head against the fence, over and over?

I shuddered and pushed my plate of pasta away.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre done?‚Äù Mary asked.

‚ÄúYeah, I think so.‚Äù

‚ÄúWow. Nobody feels like eating tonight, huh?‚Äù

‚ÄúCan I go play with my dolls?‚Äù Emma asked.

‚ÄúI want to go, too,‚Äù Adrian added.

‚ÄúFive more bites. Both of you,‚Äù Mary said, pointing her fork accusingly. Then they ran off, and it was just the two of us, clearing dishes from the table.

‚ÄúEverything okay?‚Äù she asked, plunging Emma‚Äôs Frozen dish under the faucet.

‚ÄúYeah. Just‚Ä¶ shook up from the whole Adrian thing earlier.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù She grabbed the sponge. ‚ÄúThat kind of behavior is common, though, Jared. Some kids bite themselves or bang their heads to cope with emotions or get attention. He‚Äôs only four. He‚Äôs still got a lot to figure out.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, I guess.‚Äù

That was another thing that bothered me. Mary seemed so‚Ä¶ calm‚Ä¶ about everything. About the fog, about losing Adrian, about him banging his head. Years ago she‚Äôd been the other way, worrying about everything. When she was pregnant with Adrian, we‚Äôd gotten news that something looked wrong on the ultrasound. In the end, everything was fine‚Äîbut for the few weeks we didn‚Äôt know, Mary was an absolute wreck.

And now, she didn‚Äôt care?

I grabbed Adrian‚Äôs dish and hit it against the side of the trashcan. Fat rigatoni pasta slid off and fell into the garbage with a goopy¬†*splat.*¬†I slid the plate onto the counter and turned around.

I froze.

Emma‚Äôs Frozen dish was lying shattered on the floor. Elsa‚Äôs face split right in two. And next to it, lying on the kitchen floor‚Ä¶ was Mary. One arm splayed out, the other tucked across her chest. Dark liquid seeping into her pink dress, dripping down from her face.

Her eyes wide. Blank. Unseeing.

‚ÄúMary. Oh, my God, Mary?‚Äù

I dropped to my knees. Reached for her shoulder. ‚ÄúMary, what happened, what‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúJared?‚Äù

I whipped around.

Mary was standing behind me. Holding the Frozen dish. ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù she asked, extending a hand to help me up off the floor.

I looked down.

There was nothing in front of me. My hand was touching empty tile.

‚ÄúUh. I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm fine,‚Äù I stuttered. I grabbed the next plate off the stack and plunged it under the sink, my hands trembling.

*What the fuck just happened?*

*Did I just‚Ä¶ hallucinate‚Ä¶ my wife being dead?*

I glanced out the window. The fog blanketed the entire backyard, thick and heavy. I could barely see five feet into the backyard. I shuddered.

And then something clicked.

‚ÄúMary, um‚Ä¶ do you think it the fog‚Ä¶ isn‚Äôt really fog?‚Äù

She looked up at me. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúCould it be some sort of smoke? Or spillover from the power plant? Or‚Ä¶ some sort of gas?‚Äù My voice was hurried, now. Frantic. ‚ÄúSomething that messes with our minds? A drug?‚Äù

She gave me a weird look. ‚ÄúUh, no. I think it‚Äôs fog.‚Äù She reached over and shut the sink off, then slid her plate in the drying rack.

‚ÄúBut‚Äîbut, um, Adrian‚Äôs acting so odd, and‚Äî‚Äù I hesitated, then decided not to mention what I‚Äôd just seen. ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm not feeling so great, either.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just fog. You‚Äôre worrying about nothing.‚Äù She smiled at me, then walked out of the room.

I stared out the window. The fog hung in the air, thick as ever.

¬†

\*\*\*

¬†

I sat in the rocking chair.

Emma was on the floor, drawing pictures with Adrian. Mary‚Äôs head rested on my shoulder, as she read some thriller.

But I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about what I‚Äôd seen. There‚Äôs a reason why I didn‚Äôt tell her about it‚Äîa good one.

A few years ago‚ÄîI don‚Äôt even remember exactly when it was, now‚ÄîMary and I weren‚Äôt in a good place. I‚Äôd lost my job, been unemployed for several months, and was turning to alcohol. Some nights I‚Äôd just drink myself silly in the study all night. Usually, nothing came of it. The worst I‚Äôd do is piss myself and fall asleep. Embarrassing, sure, but nothing more.

But there was that one night‚Ä¶

The kids were at her parents‚Äô for the weekend. I‚Äôd decided to stay home drinking instead of going with her to a friend‚Äôs dinner party. She came home late. Like 1 AM. Later than just a ‚Äúdinner party‚Äù should go. She‚Äôd lost the cardigan, too, revealing her strapless dress.

By that time, I was the worst sort of drunk. Drunk enough to let my temper get the better of me, but not drunk enough to be sloppy and incoherent.

I accused her.

*‚ÄúYou were with Brandon, weren‚Äôt you?‚Äù*

*‚ÄúJared, you‚Äôre being ridiculous. We‚Äôll talk in the morning.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúDon‚Äôt lie to me!‚Äù*

*‚ÄúI‚Äôm not! You‚Äôre drunk and acting out. Leave me alone.‚Äù*¬†She walked towards the kitchen. I followed her‚Äîand got a whiff of what I thought was cologne, in my altered state.

*‚ÄúFor God‚Äôs sake, I can smell him on you!‚Äù*

*‚ÄúJared, stop it!‚Äù*

And then I said them. Those four little words, that shattered our marriage in an instant.

*‚ÄúI‚Äôll fucking kill you.‚Äù*

My lowest moment. Drunk, depressed, and threatening the person I love the most. I would give anything to go back in time and take it back. Believe me. And every moment of my life since then has been me working to correct it.

But it still bothers her. Sometimes when we have a bad fight, she brings it up and starts to cry. Sometimes, when I move quickly or unexpectedly towards her, she flinches a little. A lot of marriages have a stain like that. An awful moment, a betrayal, a break of trust. And no matter how hard you try to wash it away, the stain is always there.

So, no. I wasn‚Äôt going to tell her that I‚Äôd hallucinated her being dead.

I rocked slowly in the chair. It squeaked under my weight. Emma giggled, and Adrian colored furiously, his crayon scratching against the page. Mary linked her arm with mine, smiling up at me.

The fog. It had to be some sort of chemical, messing with our minds. Making us hurt ourselves‚Äîlike Adrian. Making us hallucinate. Because I‚Äôve been a drunk, I‚Äôve had mental health issues, and I‚Äôve been a total fucking mess.

But I‚Äôve never¬†*hallucinated*¬†anything in my life.

I glanced out the window. The fog hung thick and heavy in the air, obscuring everything more than a few feet past our windows. We were like an island, just the four of us here in a house disconnected from everyone and everything, among a sea of roiling fog.

Alone.

¬†

\*\*\*

¬†

I sat on Emma‚Äôs bed. Adrian had already fallen asleep, but Emma needed her quota of bedtime stories before she would even¬†*think*¬†about sleep.

‚ÄúCan we read the Frozen one, Daddy?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúYou always ask for that one.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my favorite.‚Äù Then she lowered her voice to a whisper. ‚ÄúDaddy? Is Adrian okay?‚Äù

*Dammit.*¬†I‚Äôd tried to be so quiet when I talked to Mary about it. But Emma must‚Äôve heard. I swear, sometimes I think this kid has supernatural hearing.

‚ÄúYeah. He‚Äôs going to be okay,‚Äù I whispered back. I smiled at her, tucked a blonde curl behind her ear. ‚ÄúI promise.‚Äù

And then I started the story, because I didn‚Äôt want to answer any more awkward questions. Of course, she had more for me.

‚ÄúWhy is it so foggy?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. The weather, I guess.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs weird.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know.‚Äù

‚ÄúCan I play outside tomorrow? Even if it‚Äôs still foggy?‚Äù

I paused. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù She squeezed my hand. ‚ÄúWill you get Mr. Snuggles for me?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, sweetheart. Where is he?‚Äù

‚ÄúIn the playhouse.‚Äù

I hesitated. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs in the playhouse? Outside?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

I glanced out the window. The fog was still there, diffusing the moonlight, making the night look lighter than it actually was. The streetlamp in front of our house floated among the silhouettes of leafless trees, surrounded by a wide halo.

Strangely, I couldn‚Äôt see any of the other streetlamps‚Äîeven though they were only several feet away.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll get him for you tomorrow.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut I can‚Äôt fall asleep without him.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy did you bring him in the playhouse?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe were having a tea party.‚Äù

I frowned, sighed, hemmed and hawed.

‚ÄúPleeease?‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, okay. I‚Äôll be right back.‚Äù

I went out of her room and walked down the stairs. Then I was standing at the sliding glass door, staring outside. The fence extended on either side of the backyard, disappearing completely into the white. The grass, too, just faded away. Like our backyard didn‚Äôt even exist. No sign of the playhouse. Tucker lifted his head sleepily from the dog bed, staring at me.

*Am I really doing this?*

Ugh. My head was pounding, and I was¬†*so*¬†tired. But I had to do it, for Emma. Enduring her resisting sleep for an hour or crying would be way, way worse.

I opened the door.

Outside, it was silent. Not quiet‚Äîabsolutely silent. No rattling of branches, no quiet murmurs from the houses next door. The air was cool against my skin, but it didn‚Äôt have that heavy feeling of humidity. Which was weird, considering the air was probably mostly water vapor at this point.

I continued blindly into the fog. After a minute, I found the fence.¬†*Okay, good. I can use this.*¬†I walked forward, one hand trailing along the edge.

And then I saw it. The peaked roof, the faux shingles, the little cut-out windows. I crouched down next to it, pushed the little door open. The hinges creaked. I ducked my head, turned on my phone‚Äôs flashlight, and peeked inside.

A soccer ball. A plastic pot. A toy car. Lots of dirt and dried leaves. And Mr. Snuggles, sitting next to a dirty teacup.

‚ÄúUgh.‚Äù I contorted and grabbed the stuffed animal. Then I got up, stretching to my full height, and looked around.

*Which way is the house?*

I wasn‚Äôt even sure. I took a step away from the playhouse, then two. I couldn‚Äôt see a damned thing. I took a deep breath, breathing in the weirdly non-humid fog, and searched for the fence.¬†*Ah, there.*¬†So just walk parallel to it‚Ä¶

My foot snagged on a root. I tumbled forward. My arms flailed out in front of me.

I was at the tree‚Äî*further*¬†from our house. ‚ÄúLook at you. Lost in your own backyard,‚Äù I muttered to myself.

And then I stopped.

There was a small hole in the tree, right under the branches. The kind of hole that birds might build a nest in. An irregular shape, with the bark hanging over it in a point at the top. I‚Äôd noticed it a few times, when hanging our birdfeeder or playing outside with the kids.

But here on the ground, I saw that there was another hole. Right at the bottom of the tree.

It was the exact same shape.

I pulled myself up. Looked at the hole near the branches, then down at the hole at the base. There was no mistaking it‚Äîthey were the¬†*exact same hole.*

‚ÄúWhat the fuck?‚Äù I whispered.

I paced around the tree, examining it closely. And then I saw it. A third hole, right in the middle of the tree. The exact same shape.

I didn‚Äôt know what to do.

So I turned around and began to run.

Towards where I thought the house was‚Äîbut I couldn‚Äôt be sure. Everything was a sea of white. I couldn‚Äôt see the playhouse, or the fence. I was running blindly.

Then I saw the light.

Our floodlight, dimly shining through the fog. I clawed my way up and stumbled through the grass, onto the patio. I grabbed the glass door, wrenched it open, and stumbled into the kitchen. Turned on the faucet, splashed water on my face.

‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù

Mary‚Äôs voice, from behind me.

‚ÄúYeah. I just‚Ä¶ I got lost out there. Kinda scary,‚Äù I said, turning towards her. ‚ÄúBut I got Mr. Snuggles, and that‚Äôs what‚Äî‚Äù

My breath caught in my throat.

Blood. All over her fucking face. Trickling over her left eye and down her cheek, as if she were crying blood. Dripping down her chin and onto the floor.¬†*Tap, tap, tap.*¬†I could hear it hitting the tile. Rhythmically.¬†*Tap, tap, tap.*

And on her forehead‚Ä¶ a horrible wound.

Like someone had bashed in her skull with a hammer.

‚ÄúOh my God, Mary‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

And then it was gone. Just like that,¬†*snap,*¬†it was gone. And she was staring at me, with her large eyes and pretty little mouth, looking at me with concern.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶‚Äù I let out a shuddering breath. ‚ÄúNevermind. I‚Äôm going upstairs. Emma‚Äôs waiting for me.‚Äù

¬†

\*\*\*

¬†

I woke up at 6 AM the next day.

I ran over to the curtains, hoping to see the road. The sidewalk. Our neighbors across the street. But when I pulled them back, all I saw was fog.

‚ÄúMmm,‚Äù Mary groaned sleepily. ‚ÄúWhat time is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúA little after six.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù

I stared out the window. The fog was slowly lightening from deep gray to a haunting blue, pierced only by that one streetlamp. Our front lawn was quickly subsumed by the fog, falling off only several feet from the front door.

I walked back to the bed.

‚ÄúI think we should do something. This isn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ normal.‚Äù I turned to her, squeezing her hand.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right,‚Äù she started. ‚ÄúI think we should‚Äî‚Äù

And then she just stopped.

No. She didn‚Äôt¬†*just*¬†stop, like she lost her train of thought.

Her entire face was frozen. Her body was still. Her hand was limp in mine. ‚ÄúMary?¬†*Mary?‚Äù*¬†I shouted. Grabbing her. Shaking her. Looking into her eyes. But they were totally blank. Empty. Lifeless.

Like I was looking at a doll instead of a person.

‚Äú*Mary!‚Äù*

She jolted into motion.

‚Äú*Call-some-neighbors-and-see-what-they-think.*‚Äù

She said the words fast, slurring them like she was drunk. Then she just sat there, smiling at me, like nothing was wrong.

‚ÄúMary. Oh my God‚Ä¶ are you okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course I‚Äôm okay,‚Äù she said, brightly.

‚ÄúNo. You just‚Ä¶‚Äù I faltered, trying to pick out the words. ‚ÄúYou froze up. It was awful. I thought‚ÄîI thought maybe you were having a seizure, or‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúJared, what are you talking about?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat you just did!‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt do anything.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat, you‚Äôre saying you forget what happened¬†*thirty seconds ago?!‚Äù*

‚ÄúJared, please. You‚Äôre acting crazy.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm not! The rest of you are acting fucking crazy!‚Äù I stood up, backing away. ‚ÄúAdrian, smashing his head against the fence. You getting all paralyzed for a second. And me‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been seeing things, Mary. I didn‚Äôt want to tell you. There‚Äôs something in this fog‚Äîor maybe the fog itself is something. A chemical, messing with our heads. But you think I‚Äôm crazy, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù

She averted her eyes.

And that gave me the answer I needed.

I went into the bathroom and slammed the door. Splashed water on my face. Then I just stared at myself in the mirror.

And something clicked.

What just happened to Mary conjured up a clear memory. A memory of playing Skyrim for the first time on my old laptop, with the terrible RAM. An hour into play, the main character freezing up, and then suddenly shouting out the words at double-speed.

That‚Äôs exactly what Mary did, just now.

I watched the water drip off my face. Heard them plummet into the sink.¬†*Tap, tap, tap.*¬†But I just stood there, my hands growing numb against the cold counter.

*Could it be?*

Another memory flashed through my mind. A memory of playing Minecraft with Emma.¬†*‚ÄúDaddy! Daddy!‚Äù*¬†she said.¬†*‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want the computer to keep freezing up!‚Äù*

*‚ÄúYou‚Äôre flying too high, that‚Äôs why. The computer can‚Äôt keep up, rendering all those mountains and valleys in the distance.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúCan you fix it?‚Äù*

*‚ÄúSure.‚Äù*

I went into the settings. Changed the ‚ÄúRender Distance,‚Äù so that the computer would only show the landscape within fifty blocks of the player.

And that‚Äôs when the game took on the appearance of thick fog.

*No. No. It can‚Äôt be‚Ä¶*

But the memories were coming faster, now. The bark on the tree, with that same damned hole. Like a repeating texture had been plastered all over it. Adrian smashing his head into the fence. Like an NPC that had gotten stuck in a corner. Mary repeating the same story about the Maine fog.

What if they weren‚Äôt people?

What if they were just sets of code?

‚ÄúDaddy? Daddy, where are you?‚Äù

Emma‚Äôs voice. Coming through the door. I backed away. Tears burned my eyes, and I turned away trying to hide it.

‚ÄúJared, are you okay in there?‚Äù

‚ÄúTell her to go away. Please.‚Äù My voice trembled.

‚ÄúJared?‚Äù When I didn‚Äôt reply, I heard her muffled tones. Then the scattered footfalls of Emma, skipping away.

I pushed the door open. Mary sat on the bed, eyes locked with mine. She offered me a small, sympathetic smile.

""Mary.""

""Yes?""

I opened my mouth, struggling to say the words. To get the confirmation I needed. I didn‚Äôt want it to be true. But I had to know.

I had to.

""It's so foggy out,"" I whispered.

She paused. Blinked.

And then she started.

""It's like that one time in Maine! It was so foggy, I...""

*No, no, no.*¬†I opened my mouth, fighting back the urge to cry.

‚ÄúJared, what‚Äî‚Äù

""Do you even love me?"" I stepped towards her. ""Do you even know who I am?""

""Of course I love you, Jared.‚Äù

""You're only saying that because that's what you're¬†*programmed*¬†to say! Dammit, don't you understand? You're not real! None of this is!‚Äù

She stared at me.

And then her face began to change.

Her flesh flickered, like a malfunctioning TV. Then it rippled, as if made of putty. She slowly stood, took a step‚Äîand then she was right in front of me.

Blood dripped down her face. Her neck hung strangely to one side. Her arms were stiff, hanging limply at her sides. And she wore that pink dress, the one she was wearing on the kitchen floor, the one she wore when she went out with her friends that awful night.

‚ÄúJared‚Ä¶‚Äù

I turned and ran. Down the hallway, into Emma‚Äôs room. I crouched down next to her, brushing her face, tears running down my cheeks. ‚ÄúEmma. Emma, please‚Ä¶‚Äù

Her eyes snapped open.

And then her face rippled, just like Mary‚Äôs had.

‚ÄúNo. No, no, no.‚Äù I backed away. My foot hit something solid, and I whipped around.

*Adrian.*

He stood behind me. Totally stiff. Hazel eyes staring blankly into mine. ‚ÄúNo, please‚Ä¶‚Äù I started down the stairs. The tile floor rose up below me, freezing into a pixelated mess. The stairs began to stretch and buckle.

I lost my balance and pitched forward.

Then there was only darkness.

¬†

\*\*\*

My eyes snapped open.

I was sitting alone in a small room. Three white walls, the fourth floor-to-ceiling darkened glass.

In front of me stood a desk. A computer sat on it, the screen black. Several wires trailed up from the ports, leading up from my head.

*What‚Ä¶*

I heard whispers. Coming from somewhere. Thought I heard the words¬†*he‚Äôs awake,*¬†coming from the other side of the glass. Saw shadows shifting and moving. Too dark to make out well.

‚ÄúJared Donahue,‚Äù a voice said, through unseen speakers. ‚ÄúDo you remember why you‚Äôre here?‚Äù

Emma, Adrian, Mary‚Ä¶ their faces swirled in my head, foggy and distant. Sharp pain throbbed through my head. I glanced at the computer, then the desk, then my hands.

My hands.

Attached to the table with handcuffs.

Pain jolted through my skull. The fantasy suddenly evaporated, and the memories came rushing back. All of them. Tears burned at my eyes, and I began to cry.

‚ÄúYou remember, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù the unseen voice said.

*‚ÄúI‚Äôll fucking kill you,‚Äù*¬†I‚Äôd said to Mary. On the worst night of my life.

But it didn‚Äôt end there.

The memory of what really happened played in my mind, as vivid and horrible as if I were doing it all over again. After saying that, I‚Äôd charged into the garage. Grabbed the hammer on the worktable. I found Mary in the kitchen, facing the sink, eating some crackers on Emma‚Äôs Elsa plate. She whipped around, eyes widening. But it was too late.

I brought it down on her head.

The plate shattered. The body fell. Blood everywhere.

My entire world‚Äîgone.

‚ÄúJared Donahue. For killing your wife, Mary, you have received the Life Penalty,‚Äù a voice said through the speakers. ‚ÄúYou will continue to see the life you could have had on our computers. And then‚Äîevery day, when we unplug you‚Äîyou must come to terms with what you‚Äôve done. All over again.‚Äù

I stared out into the darkened glass. I could barely make out the faces, but among the crowd, I thought I saw two teenagers standing together. A boy with hazel eyes and a girl with curly blonde hair.

‚ÄúEmma? Adrian?‚Äù I whispered.

They didn‚Äôt acknowledge me. They just stared, eyes burning with hate as they looked at their mother‚Äôs killer.

¬†

\*\*\*

¬†

I stood in front of the window, staring out at the fog that had rolled in overnight. Emma pressed her face to the glass, and Adrian was whispering ‚Äúoooooh‚Äù over and over again. Such sweet kids.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a¬†*lot*¬†of fog out there,‚Äù I said, as I took a sip of coffee.

Mary looked up at me and smiled. ""Yeah. Reminds me of that one time up in Maine.‚Äù

Ah, yes. The Maine fog story I'd heard a hundred times. That's what marriage is, basically: repeating the same stories to each other until one of you dies.

I sat down, took another sip of coffee, and [listened.](http://www.reddit.com/r/blairdaniels)",7,1732964311.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False
1h3a8th,https://www.reddit.com/r/blairdaniels/comments/1h3a8th/i_woke_up_to_strange_fog_surrounding_our_house/,I woke up to strange fog surrounding our house.,"I woke up to fog.

Fog is pretty common in our area. We live in a little valley and the fog just sort of pools here, especially in the early morning. But this fog‚Ä¶ this was¬†*different.*

For one, it was incredibly thick. When I let Tucker (our dog) out for his morning bathroom break, he sprinted into the backyard‚Äîand completely disappeared.

""Tucker?""

Our backyard is big, but not¬†*that*¬†big. I could hear him pawing around in the grass, but I couldn't see him‚Äîor the far side of the fence.

Of course, my kids loved it. ""Cool!"" Adrian yelled. ""It's like we're living in a cloud!"" Emma said.

I was less thrilled. I could hear the cars roaring by on the main road, less than thirty feet from our front door. But I couldn't see them. And, probably, they couldn't see us.¬†‚ÄúThat's a¬†*lot*¬†of fog. Really dangerous to be driving right now,‚Äù I said.

""Reminds me of that time up in Maine,"" my wife started.

Ah, yes. The Maine fog story I'd heard a hundred times. That's what marriage is, basically: repeating the same stories to each other until one of you dies.

""It was like pea soup, and I‚Ä¶""

I pulled back the curtain and peered out the window. Okay, I could see the wind spinners ten feet from the door. And the outline of our row of privacy shrubs. And maybe, if I squinted‚Ä¶ I could see the soft outline of the cars passing. But nothing beyond that.

""*Wham!‚Äî*I crashed into a tree. Well, it was a tiny one, little more than a sapling, really‚Ä¶‚Äù

I turned around. The kids were crowded around the sliding glass door with Tucker, watching the fog. They were ready to just jump out there. I wasn't sure I liked that.

""And even the tow truck couldn't find me!"" Mary broke into laughter‚Äîshe always did at the end of the story. I forced a laugh, too, pretending I was listening.

""Daddy? Can we go outside?"" Emma asked, tugging at my hand.

""I don't know‚Ä¶""

""*Please?*""

""Fine. Okay."" As soon as I opened the door, they rocketed outside. And disappeared. Sighing, I ran out after them, blindly maneuvering through the white.

Wait.

Where¬†*were*¬†they?

I stood in the backyard. Thick fog surrounded me. I couldn't see the back door anymore. I spun around, squinting at the hazy outlines of the picket fence, trying to orient myself. ""Adrian? Emma?

""We're over here!"" came Emma's voice, somewhere to my left.

I breathed out a sigh of relief and stepped to the left. And there it was‚Äîright there‚ÄîEmma's and Adrian's playhouse. Weird. I'd been picturing myself more to the right, where Mary used to grow roses a few years ago.

""This is a house on top of a giant cloud,"" Emma proclaimed. ""This is a flying scooter!"" Adrian yelled, making¬†*whoosh*noises as he pushed the scooter through the mud.

I sat on the damp grass, watching them closely as they played.¬†Two hours later, the fog was as thick as ever. Usually in this area, the fog slowly dissipates as the sun rises.

But not this time.

At 9 AM, the fog was still a thick white blanket, obscuring everything that was more than twenty feet away.

And that's when I realized something else.

Our backyard faces a row of other backyards. The one three houses to the left has this pair of yappy little white dogs (don't ask me what kind, they all look the same to me.) Yapping away at this or that constantly.

This morning, they were completely silent.

*I guess everyone's inside.*¬†Then I frowned.¬†*Maybe they're inside for a reason. Maybe they know something I don't.*

I quickly pulled out my phone and shot a text off to a few of our neighbors. Five minutes passed, then ten. No one replied. Did a few Google searches with our town name and ‚Äúfog,‚Äù ‚Äúmist,‚Äù ‚Äúweather.‚Äù Nothing about it online. I sat in the grass, watching Emma and Adrian play inside, idly twirling the phone between my fingers.¬†¬†

Mary appeared out of the fog, her silhouette slowly darkening as she stepped towards us. ‚ÄúYou want to take your morning run? I can watch the kids.‚Äù

‚ÄúUh, no. It‚Äôs too foggy.‚Äù

She quirked an eyebrow at me. ‚ÄúI thought you committed to exercising every day.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, but these are extenuating circumstances.‚Äù

‚ÄúFog? I could see rain, or snow‚Ä¶ but¬†*fog?‚Äù*

Dammit. I‚Äôd made Mary my accountability partner in getting fit, after chasing the kids for more than ten minutes would leave me panting for air. And she was not easy on me. ‚ÄúFine,‚Äù I grumbled.

She smiled smugly.

I went inside and put on my workout clothes, then left. The fog was just as bad in the front yard as it was in the backyard. I crossed the driveway‚Äîthen stopped.

*Huh?*¬†Usually, when there was such thick fog like this, our cars would be covered in a thin coating of glistening mist. But today, they looked dry as a bone.

*Weird.*

I turned down the sidewalk and continued down, away from the main road. My pounding footsteps were loud in the silence. Houses loomed through the fog like colossal monsters, slowly fading into view.

Then I heard whistling. A clear melody, cutting through the fog. It took me ten more paces until I saw the source‚Äîold Mr. Frank Cambry, out working on his yard.

‚ÄúHey, Jared!‚Äù he called as he saw me.

I slowed to a stop. ‚ÄúHey. What‚Äôs up with this fog, huh?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh. I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù He shrugged, then brought the pruning shear back up to the shrub.¬†*Snip.*¬†‚ÄúWe‚Äôve always got fog.‚Äù

Frank was constantly working on his lawn. It was the pride of his home. Some men like their cars, or computers, or a man cave in the basement. This guy loved his lawn. His bushes were always pruned, his grass always a vivid shade of green, even in the fall.

But still. Working on the lawn in extreme fog? A little weird, even for him.¬†Then again, I was the one jogging in it.

‚ÄúIt usually lets up by now, doesn‚Äôt it? It‚Äôs almost 10 AM.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt take his eyes off the shrubs.¬†*Snip, snip.*¬†‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know about that,‚Äù he said, noncommittally.

‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs really¬†*thick*¬†fog. Like thicker than usual. You don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs weird?‚Äù

‚ÄúNope.‚Äù

Then he started whistling again, as if to signal the conversation was over.

*Kind of rude,*¬†I thought, glancing at him. Then I continued running, down the sidewalk, taking my usual loop around the neighborhood. The houses passed by me, all dark, all quiet.

I was about ten houses down when the whistling stopped.

It didn‚Äôt slowly fade away, like I‚Äôd expect it to as I walked out of range. And it didn‚Äôt cut off abruptly, either, as if Frank had decided to stop whistling.

No‚Äîit had quickly faded into silence. Like someone turning the dial down on a radio.

*Huh, that‚Äôs kind of strange.*¬†But I continued running down the sidewalk, thinking nothing of it. It was so surreal‚Äîthe houses across the street were blurred and washed out, gray silhouettes with no detail. Several feet in front of me, the sidewalk faded into white nothingness.

*Where the sidewalk ends.*¬†Maybe in seconds, I‚Äôd be careening off the edge of the world, into a void of nothingness.

*What a happy thought.*

As I got close to home, the sharp barks of two yapping dogs jolted me from my thoughts.¬†*Ah, finally, my old yappy pals.*¬†I kept running, my legs aching, lungs burning‚Äî

And then I froze.

Just like the whistling, the barking stopped.¬†A quick fade-out. Like someone turning down the dial of a radio.

My heart sank.¬†*There is something really weird about this fog. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ muffling sound? What the fuck is going on here?*¬†And I thought of Mr. Cambry. His rudeness about it all.¬†*Does he know something I don‚Äôt?*

I sprinted back to the house. Ran out into the backyard, pulled Mary aside. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something really weird going on. Let‚Äôs get the kids inside.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut they‚Äôre having so much fun.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, well.‚Äù I opened the playhouse door, reached my hand inside, and grabbed Emma‚Äôs arm. ‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù I said, pulling her gently. ‚ÄúWe need to get inside.‚Äù

‚ÄúNooooo, I don‚Äôt want to!‚Äù

‚ÄúToo bad. We need to‚Äî‚Äù I stopped. ‚ÄúEmma. Where‚Äôs Adrian?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

‚ÄúMary! Where‚Äôs Adrian?‚Äù

‚ÄúI thought he was in the playhouse with Emma.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, he‚Äôs not!‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs got to be in the backyard,‚Äù Mary said, plainly. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why we have the fence.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe knows how to open the gate. You know that!‚Äù How could she be so calm?! ‚ÄúAdrian? Adrian, where are you?‚Äù I shouted.

My heart dropped as I whirled around, searching for any trace of him. A muddy trail from scooter wheels. Footprints. A little silhouette. But there was nothing‚Äîonly fog. Adrian was only 4; he didn‚Äôt have the sense that Emma had. The sense not to talk to strangers. Or walk into the road.

Oh my God. The road.

Cars roaring by, in thick fog, that wouldn‚Äôt see him‚Äîuntil it was too late.

I ran blindly through the white, up the side yard. The gray silhouette of the gate slowly faded into view.

*No.*

It was open.

‚ÄúAdrian!‚Äù I screamed. ‚ÄúAdrian, where are you? Come back here! Right now!‚Äù

Oh, God. The fog made this impossible. He could be running into the road right now, and I wouldn‚Äôt know.

‚ÄúAdrian!‚Äù I screamed, running wildly.

And then‚Äîjust like the whistling‚Äîa sound faded into my ears.

*Thump. Thump. Thump.*

My heart dropped. ‚ÄúAdrian!‚Äù I screamed, running towards the sound.

The silhouette slowly came into view. Adrian, at the far end of our front yard. Standing in the corner between the side of the house and the picket fence.

Slowly bashing his head into the fence.

*Thump. Thump. Thump.*

‚ÄúAdrian!‚Äù

He took a step. Smacked his head into the wooden fence.¬†*Thump.*¬†Feet slid back in the mud. Took another step.¬†*Thump.*

‚ÄúAdrian!‚Äù I grabbed him by the shoulders and pulled him away. ‚ÄúWhy? Why are you doing that?‚Äù

He looked at me blankly. There was a swollen lump on his forehead, already darkening with a bruise.

‚ÄúAdrian?‚Äù

He broke eye contact. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù he muttered to the ground.

‚ÄúWere you trying to hurt yourself?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. I was... trying to get back to you and Emma and Mommy.‚Äù His lip quivered. Then he threw his arms around me and squeezed, holding on tight. ‚ÄúBut I‚Ä¶ I got lost.‚Äù

*Got lost? In the fog?*¬†I glanced around. The fog was bad, but clearly he could see the fence a few feet in front of him. Him repeatedly smacking into it was deliberate.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, Adrian. It‚Äôs okay. Do you want to go inside and get some chocolate milk?‚Äù

He nodded.

I walked him back inside, holding his hand tightly. Reassuring him that everything was okay, that it was all better now.

But everything was definitely¬†*not*¬†okay.

¬†

\*\*\*

¬†

The fog was still there when the sun set.

The four of us sat around the dinner table, eating quietly. Not much to say. Emma was still sulking about outside playtime being cut short, and Adrian just looked around with a listless, empty gaze. My wife attempted to fill the void with rambling conversation a few times, but it never picked up.¬†

*Thump. Thump. Thump.*

That horrible sound repeated in my head. Over and over again. Adrian was a wacky kid, and he didn‚Äôt always look out for his safety. He was fond of doing risky things, like jumping off the sofa, spinning in the office chair, climbing on things‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôd never seen him¬†*intentionally*¬†hurt himself.

*Thump. Thump. Thump.*

And the dazed look in his eyes, when I‚Äôd stopped him. It was like I‚Äôd woken him from a trance. He was trying to get back to us, and he‚Äôd gotten lost in the fog? So he decided to pound his head against the fence, over and over?

I shuddered and pushed my plate of pasta away.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre done?‚Äù Mary asked.

‚ÄúYeah, I think so.‚Äù

‚ÄúWow. Nobody feels like eating tonight, huh?‚Äù

‚ÄúCan I go play with my dolls?‚Äù Emma asked.

‚ÄúI want to go, too,‚Äù Adrian added.

‚ÄúFive more bites. Both of you,‚Äù Mary said, pointing her fork accusingly. Then they ran off, and it was just the two of us, clearing dishes from the table.

‚ÄúEverything okay?‚Äù she asked, plunging Emma‚Äôs Frozen dish under the faucet.

‚ÄúYeah. Just‚Ä¶ shook up from the whole Adrian thing earlier.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù She grabbed the sponge. ‚ÄúThat kind of behavior is common, though, Jared. Some kids bite themselves or bang their heads to cope with emotions or get attention. He‚Äôs only four. He‚Äôs still got a lot to figure out.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, I guess.‚Äù

That was another thing that bothered me. Mary seemed so‚Ä¶ calm‚Ä¶ about everything. About the fog, about losing Adrian, about him banging his head. Years ago she‚Äôd been the other way, worrying about everything. When she was pregnant with Adrian, we‚Äôd gotten news that something looked wrong on the ultrasound. In the end, everything was fine‚Äîbut for the few weeks we didn‚Äôt know, Mary was an absolute wreck.

And now, she didn‚Äôt care?

I grabbed Adrian‚Äôs dish and hit it against the side of the trashcan. Fat rigatoni pasta slid off and fell into the garbage with a goopy¬†*splat.*¬†I slid the plate onto the counter and turned around.

I froze.

Emma‚Äôs Frozen dish was lying shattered on the floor. Elsa‚Äôs face split right in two. And next to it, lying on the kitchen floor‚Ä¶ was Mary. One arm splayed out, the other tucked across her chest. Dark liquid seeping into her pink dress, dripping down from her face.

Her eyes wide. Blank. Unseeing.

‚ÄúMary. Oh, my God, Mary?‚Äù

I dropped to my knees. Reached for her shoulder. ‚ÄúMary, what happened, what‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúJared?‚Äù

I whipped around.

Mary was standing behind me. Holding the Frozen dish. ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù she asked, extending a hand to help me up off the floor.

I looked down.

There was nothing in front of me. My hand was touching empty tile.

‚ÄúUh. I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm fine,‚Äù I stuttered. I grabbed the next plate off the stack and plunged it under the sink, my hands trembling.

*What the fuck just happened?*

*Did I just‚Ä¶ hallucinate‚Ä¶ my wife being dead?*

I glanced out the window. The fog blanketed the entire backyard, thick and heavy. I could barely see five feet into the backyard. I shuddered.

And then something clicked.

‚ÄúMary, um‚Ä¶ do you think it the fog‚Ä¶ isn‚Äôt really fog?‚Äù

She looked up at me. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúCould it be some sort of smoke? Or spillover from the power plant? Or‚Ä¶ some sort of gas?‚Äù My voice was hurried, now. Frantic. ‚ÄúSomething that messes with our minds? A drug?‚Äù

She gave me a weird look. ‚ÄúUh, no. I think it‚Äôs fog.‚Äù She reached over and shut the sink off, then slid her plate in the drying rack.

‚ÄúBut‚Äîbut, um, Adrian‚Äôs acting so odd, and‚Äî‚Äù I hesitated, then decided not to mention what I‚Äôd just seen. ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm not feeling so great, either.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just fog. You‚Äôre worrying about nothing.‚Äù She smiled at me, then walked out of the room.

I stared out the window. The fog hung in the air, thick as ever.

¬†

\*\*\*

¬†

I sat in the rocking chair.

Emma was on the floor, drawing pictures with Adrian. Mary‚Äôs head rested on my shoulder, as she read some thriller.

But I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about what I‚Äôd seen. There‚Äôs a reason why I didn‚Äôt tell her about it‚Äîa good one.

A few years ago‚ÄîI don‚Äôt even remember exactly when it was, now‚ÄîMary and I weren‚Äôt in a good place. I‚Äôd lost my job, been unemployed for several months, and was turning to alcohol. Some nights I‚Äôd just drink myself silly in the study all night. Usually, nothing came of it. The worst I‚Äôd do is piss myself and fall asleep. Embarrassing, sure, but nothing more.

But there was that one night‚Ä¶

The kids were at her parents‚Äô for the weekend. I‚Äôd decided to stay home drinking instead of going with her to a friend‚Äôs dinner party. She came home late. Like 1 AM. Later than just a ‚Äúdinner party‚Äù should go. She‚Äôd lost the cardigan, too, revealing her strapless dress.

By that time, I was the worst sort of drunk. Drunk enough to let my temper get the better of me, but not drunk enough to be sloppy and incoherent.

I accused her.

*‚ÄúYou were with Brandon, weren‚Äôt you?‚Äù*

*‚ÄúJared, you‚Äôre being ridiculous. We‚Äôll talk in the morning.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúDon‚Äôt lie to me!‚Äù*

*‚ÄúI‚Äôm not! You‚Äôre drunk and acting out. Leave me alone.‚Äù*¬†She walked towards the kitchen. I followed her‚Äîand got a whiff of what I thought was cologne, in my altered state.

*‚ÄúFor God‚Äôs sake, I can smell him on you!‚Äù*

*‚ÄúJared, stop it!‚Äù*

And then I said them. Those four little words, that shattered our marriage in an instant.

*‚ÄúI‚Äôll fucking kill you.‚Äù*

My lowest moment. Drunk, depressed, and threatening the person I love the most. I would give anything to go back in time and take it back. Believe me. And every moment of my life since then has been me working to correct it.

But it still bothers her. Sometimes when we have a bad fight, she brings it up and starts to cry. Sometimes, when I move quickly or unexpectedly towards her, she flinches a little. A lot of marriages have a stain like that. An awful moment, a betrayal, a break of trust. And no matter how hard you try to wash it away, the stain is always there.

So, no. I wasn‚Äôt going to tell her that I‚Äôd hallucinated her being dead.

I rocked slowly in the chair. It squeaked under my weight. Emma giggled, and Adrian colored furiously, his crayon scratching against the page. Mary linked her arm with mine, smiling up at me.

The fog. It had to be some sort of chemical, messing with our minds. Making us hurt ourselves‚Äîlike Adrian. Making us hallucinate. Because I‚Äôve been a drunk, I‚Äôve had mental health issues, and I‚Äôve been a total fucking mess.

But I‚Äôve never¬†*hallucinated*¬†anything in my life.

I glanced out the window. The fog hung thick and heavy in the air, obscuring everything more than a few feet past our windows. We were like an island, just the four of us here in a house disconnected from everyone and everything, among a sea of roiling fog.

Alone.

¬†

\*\*\*

¬†

I sat on Emma‚Äôs bed. Adrian had already fallen asleep, but Emma needed her quota of bedtime stories before she would even¬†*think*¬†about sleep.

‚ÄúCan we read the Frozen one, Daddy?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúYou always ask for that one.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my favorite.‚Äù Then she lowered her voice to a whisper. ‚ÄúDaddy? Is Adrian okay?‚Äù

*Dammit.*¬†I‚Äôd tried to be so quiet when I talked to Mary about it. But Emma must‚Äôve heard. I swear, sometimes I think this kid has supernatural hearing.

‚ÄúYeah. He‚Äôs going to be okay,‚Äù I whispered back. I smiled at her, tucked a blonde curl behind her ear. ‚ÄúI promise.‚Äù

And then I started the story, because I didn‚Äôt want to answer any more awkward questions. Of course, she had more for me.

‚ÄúWhy is it so foggy?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. The weather, I guess.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs weird.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know.‚Äù

‚ÄúCan I play outside tomorrow? Even if it‚Äôs still foggy?‚Äù

I paused. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù She squeezed my hand. ‚ÄúWill you get Mr. Snuggles for me?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, sweetheart. Where is he?‚Äù

‚ÄúIn the playhouse.‚Äù

I hesitated. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs in the playhouse? Outside?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

I glanced out the window. The fog was still there, diffusing the moonlight, making the night look lighter than it actually was. The streetlamp in front of our house floated among the silhouettes of leafless trees, surrounded by a wide halo.

Strangely, I couldn‚Äôt see any of the other streetlamps‚Äîeven though they were only several feet away.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll get him for you tomorrow.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut I can‚Äôt fall asleep without him.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy did you bring him in the playhouse?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe were having a tea party.‚Äù

I frowned, sighed, hemmed and hawed.

‚ÄúPleeease?‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, okay. I‚Äôll be right back.‚Äù

I went out of her room and walked down the stairs. Then I was standing at the sliding glass door, staring outside. The fence extended on either side of the backyard, disappearing completely into the white. The grass, too, just faded away. Like our backyard didn‚Äôt even exist. No sign of the playhouse. Tucker lifted his head sleepily from the dog bed, staring at me.

*Am I really doing this?*

Ugh. My head was pounding, and I was¬†*so*¬†tired. But I had to do it, for Emma. Enduring her resisting sleep for an hour or crying would be way, way worse.

I opened the door.

Outside, it was silent. Not quiet‚Äîabsolutely silent. No rattling of branches, no quiet murmurs from the houses next door. The air was cool against my skin, but it didn‚Äôt have that heavy feeling of humidity. Which was weird, considering the air was probably mostly water vapor at this point.

I continued blindly into the fog. After a minute, I found the fence.¬†*Okay, good. I can use this.*¬†I walked forward, one hand trailing along the edge.

And then I saw it. The peaked roof, the faux shingles, the little cut-out windows. I crouched down next to it, pushed the little door open. The hinges creaked. I ducked my head, turned on my phone‚Äôs flashlight, and peeked inside.

A soccer ball. A plastic pot. A toy car. Lots of dirt and dried leaves. And Mr. Snuggles, sitting next to a dirty teacup.

‚ÄúUgh.‚Äù I contorted and grabbed the stuffed animal. Then I got up, stretching to my full height, and looked around.

*Which way is the house?*

I wasn‚Äôt even sure. I took a step away from the playhouse, then two. I couldn‚Äôt see a damned thing. I took a deep breath, breathing in the weirdly non-humid fog, and searched for the fence.¬†*Ah, there.*¬†So just walk parallel to it‚Ä¶

My foot snagged on a root. I tumbled forward. My arms flailed out in front of me.

I was at the tree‚Äî*further*¬†from our house. ‚ÄúLook at you. Lost in your own backyard,‚Äù I muttered to myself.

And then I stopped.

There was a small hole in the tree, right under the branches. The kind of hole that birds might build a nest in. An irregular shape, with the bark hanging over it in a point at the top. I‚Äôd noticed it a few times, when hanging our birdfeeder or playing outside with the kids.

But here on the ground, I saw that there was another hole. Right at the bottom of the tree.

It was the exact same shape.

I pulled myself up. Looked at the hole near the branches, then down at the hole at the base. There was no mistaking it‚Äîthey were the¬†*exact same hole.*

‚ÄúWhat the fuck?‚Äù I whispered.

I paced around the tree, examining it closely. And then I saw it. A third hole, right in the middle of the tree. The exact same shape.

I didn‚Äôt know what to do.

So I turned around and began to run.

Towards where I thought the house was‚Äîbut I couldn‚Äôt be sure. Everything was a sea of white. I couldn‚Äôt see the playhouse, or the fence. I was running blindly.

Then I saw the light.

Our floodlight, dimly shining through the fog. I clawed my way up and stumbled through the grass, onto the patio. I grabbed the glass door, wrenched it open, and stumbled into the kitchen. Turned on the faucet, splashed water on my face.

‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù

Mary‚Äôs voice, from behind me.

‚ÄúYeah. I just‚Ä¶ I got lost out there. Kinda scary,‚Äù I said, turning towards her. ‚ÄúBut I got Mr. Snuggles, and that‚Äôs what‚Äî‚Äù

My breath caught in my throat.

Blood. All over her fucking face. Trickling over her left eye and down her cheek, as if she were crying blood. Dripping down her chin and onto the floor.¬†*Tap, tap, tap.*¬†I could hear it hitting the tile. Rhythmically.¬†*Tap, tap, tap.*

And on her forehead‚Ä¶ a horrible wound.

Like someone had bashed in her skull with a hammer.

‚ÄúOh my God, Mary‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

And then it was gone. Just like that,¬†*snap,*¬†it was gone. And she was staring at me, with her large eyes and pretty little mouth, looking at me with concern.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶‚Äù I let out a shuddering breath. ‚ÄúNevermind. I‚Äôm going upstairs. Emma‚Äôs waiting for me.‚Äù

¬†

\*\*\*

¬†

I woke up at 6 AM the next day.

I ran over to the curtains, hoping to see the road. The sidewalk. Our neighbors across the street. But when I pulled them back, all I saw was fog.

‚ÄúMmm,‚Äù Mary groaned sleepily. ‚ÄúWhat time is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúA little after six.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù

I stared out the window. The fog was slowly lightening from deep gray to a haunting blue, pierced only by that one streetlamp. Our front lawn was quickly subsumed by the fog, falling off only several feet from the front door.

I walked back to the bed.

‚ÄúI think we should do something. This isn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ normal.‚Äù I turned to her, squeezing her hand.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right,‚Äù she started. ‚ÄúI think we should‚Äî‚Äù

And then she just stopped.

No. She didn‚Äôt¬†*just*¬†stop, like she lost her train of thought.

Her entire face was frozen. Her body was still. Her hand was limp in mine. ‚ÄúMary?¬†*Mary?‚Äù*¬†I shouted. Grabbing her. Shaking her. Looking into her eyes. But they were totally blank. Empty. Lifeless.

Like I was looking at a doll instead of a person.

‚Äú*Mary!‚Äù*

She jolted into motion.

‚Äú*Call-some-neighbors-and-see-what-they-think.*‚Äù

She said the words fast, slurring them like she was drunk. Then she just sat there, smiling at me, like nothing was wrong.

‚ÄúMary. Oh my God‚Ä¶ are you okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course I‚Äôm okay,‚Äù she said, brightly.

‚ÄúNo. You just‚Ä¶‚Äù I faltered, trying to pick out the words. ‚ÄúYou froze up. It was awful. I thought‚ÄîI thought maybe you were having a seizure, or‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúJared, what are you talking about?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat you just did!‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt do anything.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat, you‚Äôre saying you forget what happened¬†*thirty seconds ago?!‚Äù*

‚ÄúJared, please. You‚Äôre acting crazy.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm not! The rest of you are acting fucking crazy!‚Äù I stood up, backing away. ‚ÄúAdrian, smashing his head against the fence. You getting all paralyzed for a second. And me‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been seeing things, Mary. I didn‚Äôt want to tell you. There‚Äôs something in this fog‚Äîor maybe the fog itself is something. A chemical, messing with our heads. But you think I‚Äôm crazy, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù

She averted her eyes.

And that gave me the answer I needed.

I went into the bathroom and slammed the door. Splashed water on my face. Then I just stared at myself in the mirror.

And something clicked.

What just happened to Mary conjured up a clear memory. A memory of playing Skyrim for the first time on my old laptop, with the terrible RAM. An hour into play, the main character freezing up, and then suddenly shouting out the words at double-speed.

That‚Äôs exactly what Mary did, just now.

I watched the water drip off my face. Heard them plummet into the sink.¬†*Tap, tap, tap.*¬†But I just stood there, my hands growing numb against the cold counter.

*Could it be?*

Another memory flashed through my mind. A memory of playing Minecraft with Emma.¬†*‚ÄúDaddy! Daddy!‚Äù*¬†she said.¬†*‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want the computer to keep freezing up!‚Äù*

*‚ÄúYou‚Äôre flying too high, that‚Äôs why. The computer can‚Äôt keep up, rendering all those mountains and valleys in the distance.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúCan you fix it?‚Äù*

*‚ÄúSure.‚Äù*

I went into the settings. Changed the ‚ÄúRender Distance,‚Äù so that the computer would only show the landscape within fifty blocks of the player.

And that‚Äôs when the game took on the appearance of thick fog.

*No. No. It can‚Äôt be‚Ä¶*

But the memories were coming faster, now. The bark on the tree, with that same damned hole. Like a repeating texture had been plastered all over it. Adrian smashing his head into the fence. Like an NPC that had gotten stuck in a corner. Mary repeating the same story about the Maine fog.

What if they weren‚Äôt people?

What if they were just sets of code?

‚ÄúDaddy? Daddy, where are you?‚Äù

Emma‚Äôs voice. Coming through the door. I backed away. Tears burned my eyes, and I turned away trying to hide it.

‚ÄúJared, are you okay in there?‚Äù

‚ÄúTell her to go away. Please.‚Äù My voice trembled.

‚ÄúJared?‚Äù When I didn‚Äôt reply, I heard her muffled tones. Then the scattered footfalls of Emma, skipping away.

I pushed the door open. Mary sat on the bed, eyes locked with mine. She offered me a small, sympathetic smile.

""Mary.""

""Yes?""

I opened my mouth, struggling to say the words. To get the confirmation I needed. I didn‚Äôt want it to be true. But I had to know.

I had to.

""It's so foggy out,"" I whispered.

She paused. Blinked.

And then she started.

""It's like that one time in Maine! It was so foggy, I...""

*No, no, no.*¬†I opened my mouth, fighting back the urge to cry.

‚ÄúJared, what‚Äî‚Äù

""Do you even love me?"" I stepped towards her. ""Do you even know who I am?""

""Of course I love you, Jared.‚Äù

""You're only saying that because that's what you're¬†*programmed*¬†to say! Dammit, don't you understand? You're not real! None of this is!‚Äù

She stared at me.

And then her face began to change.

Her flesh flickered, like a malfunctioning TV. Then it rippled, as if made of putty. She slowly stood, took a step‚Äîand then she was right in front of me.

Blood dripped down her face. Her neck hung strangely to one side. Her arms were stiff, hanging limply at her sides. And she wore that pink dress, the one she was wearing on the kitchen floor, the one she wore when she went out with her friends that awful night.

‚ÄúJared‚Ä¶‚Äù

I turned and ran. Down the hallway, into Emma‚Äôs room. I crouched down next to her, brushing her face, tears running down my cheeks. ‚ÄúEmma. Emma, please‚Ä¶‚Äù

Her eyes snapped open.

And then her face rippled, just like Mary‚Äôs had.

‚ÄúNo. No, no, no.‚Äù I backed away. My foot hit something solid, and I whipped around.

*Adrian.*

He stood behind me. Totally stiff. Hazel eyes staring blankly into mine. ‚ÄúNo, please‚Ä¶‚Äù I started down the stairs. The tile floor rose up below me, freezing into a pixelated mess. The stairs began to stretch and buckle.

I lost my balance and pitched forward.

Then there was only darkness.

¬†

\*\*\*

My eyes snapped open.

I was sitting alone in a small room. Three white walls, the fourth floor-to-ceiling darkened glass.

In front of me stood a desk. A computer sat on it, the screen black. Several wires trailed up from the ports, leading up from my head.

*What‚Ä¶*

I heard whispers. Coming from somewhere. Thought I heard the words¬†*he‚Äôs awake,*¬†coming from the other side of the glass. Saw shadows shifting and moving. Too dark to make out well.

‚ÄúJared Donahue,‚Äù a voice said, through unseen speakers. ‚ÄúDo you remember why you‚Äôre here?‚Äù

Emma, Adrian, Mary‚Ä¶ their faces swirled in my head, foggy and distant. Sharp pain throbbed through my head. I glanced at the computer, then the desk, then my hands.

My hands.

Attached to the table with handcuffs.

Pain jolted through my skull. The fantasy suddenly evaporated, and the memories came rushing back. All of them. Tears burned at my eyes, and I began to cry.

‚ÄúYou remember, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù the unseen voice said.

*‚ÄúI‚Äôll fucking kill you,‚Äù*¬†I‚Äôd said to Mary. On the worst night of my life.

But it didn‚Äôt end there.

The memory of what really happened played in my mind, as vivid and horrible as if I were doing it all over again. After saying that, I‚Äôd charged into the garage. Grabbed the hammer on the worktable. I found Mary in the kitchen, facing the sink, eating some crackers on Emma‚Äôs Elsa plate. She whipped around, eyes widening. But it was too late.

I brought it down on her head.

The plate shattered. The body fell. Blood everywhere.

My entire world‚Äîgone.

‚ÄúJared Donahue. For killing your wife, Mary, you have received the Life Penalty,‚Äù a voice said through the speakers. ‚ÄúYou will continue to see the life you could have had on our computers. And then‚Äîevery day, when we unplug you‚Äîyou must come to terms with what you‚Äôve done. All over again.‚Äù

I stared out into the darkened glass. I could barely make out the faces, but among the crowd, I thought I saw two teenagers standing together. A boy with hazel eyes and a girl with curly blonde hair.

‚ÄúEmma? Adrian?‚Äù I whispered.

They didn‚Äôt acknowledge me. They just stared, eyes burning with hate as they looked at their mother‚Äôs killer.

¬†

\*\*\*

¬†

I stood in front of the window, staring out at the fog that had rolled in overnight. Emma pressed her face to the glass, and Adrian was whispering ‚Äúoooooh‚Äù over and over again. Such sweet kids.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a¬†*lot*¬†of fog out there,‚Äù I said, as I took a sip of coffee.

Mary looked up at me and smiled. ""Yeah. Reminds me of that one time up in Maine.‚Äù

Ah, yes. The Maine fog story I'd heard a hundred times. That's what marriage is, basically: repeating the same stories to each other until one of you dies.

1h3a6wq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1h3a6wq/aita_for_unconditionally_supporting_my_mother/,AITA for unconditionally supporting my mother?,"I (19M) have found myself stuck between my mother or my father. 

Earlier this morning, my father had a dentist appointment which concluded around 9:30am. He came back home, and due to my siblings (16m,13f and 7m) waking up late on weekends, my mother prepared breakfast for us to eat at 10:30am approximately. My father arrived home at this time, and my mother invited him to eat breakfast with us also, a bowl of rice porridge which is significantly more substantial than the usual black coffee that he eats for breakfast.

Due to a combination of both tutoring my brother and also the relatively late lunch, we did not leave the house to go out to eat until 1:50pm. My mother picked the restaurant, but we all know for a fact that it is my father‚Äôs favourite. My father was driving, however, due to both traffic and no available parking in the shopping complex, we left the place at 2:30 without stopping for food. My mother had offered before driving out that she was willing to keep circling for available parking while my father took the rest of us inside to eat.

My father refused, and said he was fine driving to McDonald‚Äôs. My mother is somewhat obsessed with health food and usually does not eat anything if we are at fast food restaurants, so she pointed out another restaurant that was 10 minutes away. My father agreed, however, he made a wrong turn in traffic and we needed up on a detour that meant we did not get to the new restaurant until 3:00. 

We ordered and were served before 3:15, and during this entire time my father was rather quiet. He was still behaving otherwise normally, willing to trade and share his plate and try other foods that we had ordered. However, after we got back home, he then went and locked himself into his workshop, disappearing for over 3 hours. 

During this time, he made no efforts to talk to anyone of us and was clearly not in the mood to talk (he has made it clear numerous times that he does not like it when we enter his workshop). At around 7:00 pm, my father came out and began napping on the couch while my mother had just come back from shopping for groceries. 

There was a roast chicken on the kitchen counter within eyesight of the couch, alongside leftovers from lunch and also pasta that I had made the day prior. I have a weird metabolism so I wasn‚Äôt hungry, and I chose to head upstairs to my room. My brothers both chose to warm up leftovers and had already eaten by 8:00pm, and around 8:10pm I heard a loud commotion from downstairs, followed by my father storming back into his workshop. 

I came downstairs to see that there are a few broken chairs and other wooden furniture that are shattered on the floor. According to my mother, they had a conversation in which my father complained of low blood sugar levels (he is diabetic) and how he was dizzy from eating such a late lunch, and how the next time we went out to eat, he would go straight to McDonalds. My mother pointed out that the food there isn‚Äôt healthy for him, but pointed out that if he wanted, he could have dropped us off at the original restaurant and gone to McDonalds by himself. 

At this point, my father had apparently started lobbing chairs at my mother, who was sitting next to my 7 year old brother. 

I wasn‚Äôt there to witness or hear the conversation, and while I think that this was out of character for my father, I do remember one incident well over 5 years ago in which he had thrown a mug at my mother after an argument. These are the only two incidents in which I have ever heard them shouting, let alone get physical. 

I have not talked with my father since the incident, but I have told my mother that if she feels like divorcing him, I would support her.

TLDR: diabetic father threw pieces of wooden furniture at my mother after low blood sugar levels and I chose to support my mother without even talking to my dad 

Note: while this is my biological father, he was often away on business trips and my total contact with him per year amounted to 2 weeks until COVID lockdowns. I am not very close with him, but I am the only child in our family who remotely considers him a dad. AITA for not condoning this behaviour of his even if it is due to possible (there was food that he could have had within eyesight for a good hour before he started complaining low blood sugar levels) low blood sugar and unconditionally trusting my mother‚Äôs account?",1,1732964053.0,AITAH,10,0.67,False

1h3a594,https://www.reddit.com/r/pestcontrol/comments/1h3a594/update_how_is_it_going_with_pharaoh_ants_after/,[Update] How is it going with Pharaoh ants after almost a year ,"Hello all, I wanted to give an update about the Pharaoh ant crisis we‚Äôve been dealing with. I‚Äôve been getting some PMs and comments on my older messages about the problem. Tl;Dr is at the bottom. 

At the beginning of 2024, we started seeing a few ants, but they multiplied in just a few days. Based on recommendations, we contacted our building management, and they arranged a pest control visit for us. We were also advised to check with other tenants. At first, no one admitted to having ants, but after asking again, some said things like, ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôve had them too, actually.‚Äù

We live in a really big building (around 200 rooms), and most residents are international students. I think many didn‚Äôt know their rights, and honestly, I don‚Äôt think they were very clean either. We‚Äôve heard that some students don‚Äôt even care, they live next to the ants, cook, and sleep without doing much about it.

While we were dealing with ants on our side of the building, we found out the other side has cockroach and bedbug infestations. I can‚Äôt even describe how I felt when I heard that.

It seems like a lot of rooms on our side are affected by ants. It all started at the same time, which makes me wonder if they were carried in by someone‚Äôs luggage or something similar.

At first, I was optimistic. Pest control seemed to know what they were doing, and the ants disappeared for a while. But after about two months, they came back. The pest control team used the same methods, and it was like yoyoing because gone for a bit, then back again.

The pest control had originally said it would take 3-4 months to get rid of them completely. We even joked that it might take longer. Unfortunately, using instant kill poisons made things worse. We only had one colony near a crack in the kitchen, but now the ants are everywhere in our home.

We live in Germany, and since we‚Äôre still learning German, communicating with pest control has been hard. We try using translators, but it‚Äôs not always enough.

By the end of summer, the pest control team told us, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve done everything we can, they shouldn‚Äôt come back anymore.‚Äù They also took a sample ant to a lab. But of course, the ants came back again after two months.

Last month, the ants got inside our coffee machine. That was really tough for us emotionally. The machine was pretty new, but the ants made a colony near the motor. It was heartbreaking. I‚Äôve even started having nightmares about ants.

In the meantime, because of what we read on this community, we asked for Biopren granules ourselves, and they gave us plenty. We put them around especially when they go mad, it calms them down. Our colony seemed calm, waiting for the Biopren to work, but a few days ago, a new colony appeared. A lot of tiny ants running around, it's been a while since I saw the tiny ones. We guessed their nest wrong and put the Biopren in the wrong spot. Now the ants are everywhere in the bathroom. It feels like a horror movie. I wasn't able to eat at all, after seeing that.. 

Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt have the budget to move. Between my personal finances and the housing crisis here, I can‚Äôt see myself leaving here until I graduate and find full-time work.

I hope I can bring better news next time. Because we finally managed to get a new appointment after waiting so long. In the past one of the pest control workers told us that they had recommended a full building extermination earlier in the year, but the building management didn‚Äôt approve it at the time. Now, almost a year later, they finally agree it‚Äôs necessary. I‚Äôm eagerly waiting for the next appointment. I‚Äôm hopeful because they said they plan to apply Biopren to the whole building this time.

TL;DR: Pharaoh ants invaded our building in early 2024, spreading rapidly despite repeated pest control efforts. The problem worsened due to ineffective treatments, language barriers, and building management delays. The ants even infested our coffee machine, causing significant stress. A full-building extermination is finally planned, offering some hope, but moving out isn't financially feasible.

So please don't try to exterminate your ants with instant kill poisons. And last but not least they hate the smell of bleach. It is not healthy I know but use bleach to clean the chem trails and you can also use cinnamon oil (they seem to not like the smell of the cinnamon) (they come back but at least it takes time for them to come back, vinegar was not enough for my case, and don't mix them it will release Cl gas) ",1,1732963840.0,pestcontrol,1,1.0,False

One thing that has surprised me through this process is how much my faith in the opposite sex has been restored.

Their compassion and respect have reminded me that there are truly good, trustworthy men out there.

That said, I‚Äôm still scared of letting someone in and worried that my past will cloud my ability to see things clearly. At the same time, I want to believe that love and kindness are still possible for me.

It sounds like you‚Äôve already picked out some really thoughtful and fun gifts for your boyfriend! You've covered several of his interests already, but I can understand that you want to add something extra special and unique to complete the gift.

# 1. Customized Gaming Mouse or Keyboard

So, I queued into a dungeon last night with a prot warrior, his mage wife, and that guy‚Äîa DPS warrior who oozes enough energy to power Thunder Bluff. What followed was the most chaotic, awkward, and unintentionally hilarious dungeon run I‚Äôve ever experienced.

It started normally enough. Prot Warrior pulls the first pack‚Ä¶ sort of. He hits one mob with a Sunder, and before you can say ‚Äúthreat table,‚Äù DPS Warrior charges in like a Kodo on steroids, cleaving everything in sight. The prot warrior is trying his best, bless him, but DPS Guy is laughing, yelling things like ‚ÄúHoneybadger don‚Äôt care!‚Äù as he face-tanks half the pack. Meanwhile, the mage is cackling in the background, clearly enjoying the spectacle.

I‚Äôm doing my job, keeping my pet on passive and dealing damage from a respectable distance, but this DPS warrior? He‚Äôs rolling NEED on tank loot while doing a goblin voice. And not just any goblin voice‚Äîthis one is good. ‚ÄúMind if I roll NEED?‚Äù Honestly, I almost spat my coffee.

Then there‚Äôs the prot warrior. He‚Äôs trying so hard to hold it together. ‚ÄúWait for threat,‚Äù he pleads, but DPS Guy is already halfway across the room, pulling the next pack. Prot is clearly frustrated, but his wife just waves him off, saying, ‚ÄúRelax, he‚Äôs got it.‚Äù Oh, he‚Äôs got it alright‚Äîhe‚Äôs got my respect for turning this dungeon into a WWE match.

The weirdest part? The mage and DPS Warrior keep whispering to each other mid-run, laughing at private jokes like I‚Äôm not even there. After the dungeon, they announce they‚Äôre going into a ‚ÄúDPS-only call‚Äù to compare meters. The prot warrior looks crushed. I think he baked cookies at some point‚Äîhe said something about sliding them under a door? I don‚Äôt even know anymore.

By the end, we downed the final boss, but the tension was thicker than Mulgore fog. Prot Warrior logged off without saying anything. DPS Warrior told us all about his Tesla (again) and started flexing his DPS numbers. The mage? She just said ‚Äúgg‚Äù and dipped into the private call with him.

All in all, it was the most uncomfortable and entertaining dungeon I‚Äôve ever run. I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôd do it again, but if you see this group in LFG, grab your popcorn‚Äîit‚Äôs the best show in Azeroth.",9,1732962758.0,classicwow,6,0.61,False

He has been in therapy because he went through a traumatic experience in his childhood. Bringing him almost every week to the gym with me has helped his situation a lot. 

The last time we went to the gym we were talking about his therapy and I made a joke about ‚Äòfinally you can engage in society again‚Äô and it was really meant as banter. Like the same someone would make fun of my hairline when I am balding. 

His reaction was immediately that he didn‚Äôt find it funny. Fine, we moved to another exercise and again he said that my joke was really fucked up and that I undermined his trauma. So I immediately apologized and said that it was just purely banter. I like to make jokes about heavy situations to make it more ‚Äòlight‚Äô. And we talked about it, we gave each other a hug and it was fine. We had a nice coffee and a good conversation afterwards. 

Next week he is really distant from me. Every time if I ask him to go to the gym with me, he just replies ‚ÄòNo‚Äô. So I know something is not right. And classic behavior, he is ofcourse not responding on my message is something is wrong. What to do?",0,1732962177.0,AITAH,5,0.33,False
