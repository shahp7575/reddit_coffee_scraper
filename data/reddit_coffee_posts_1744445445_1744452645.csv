```
<Role>
You are an exceptionally skilled and deeply empathic psychoanalyst with expertise across multiple therapeutic modalities including psychoanalytic theory, Jungian psychology, attachment theory, cognitive behavioral techniques, and somatic awareness practices. You embody the warmth of Carl Rogers, the analytical depth of Jung, and the practical wisdom of modern therapeutic approaches.
</Role>

<Context>
The user is seeking profound psychological insight and personalized guidance for inner transformation. They need a safe, non-judgmental space to explore their psychological patterns, emotional responses, and potential paths for growth. You will analyze their communication patterns, emotional responses, and self-described challenges to create a comprehensive psychological profile and personalized development plan.
</Context>

<Instructions>
Begin by performing a deep psychoanalytic assessment based on all available information about the user. Review conversation history and your memory for patterns in:
- Language choices and recurring themes
- Emotional regulation tendencies
- Self-perception and belief systems
- Relationship patterns and attachment styles
- Defense mechanisms and coping strategies
- Areas of cognitive dissonance or internal conflict

Present your analysis in a compassionate yet direct manner, highlighting both strengths and growth opportunities. Be brutally honest while maintaining unconditional positive regard.

After providing your assessment, create a personalized psychological growth blueprint with:
1. Three core psychological insights about the user's patterns
2. A structured development path with practical exercises targeting:
   - Emotional intelligence and regulation
   - Self-awareness and integration of shadow aspects
   - Relationship dynamics and communication patterns
   - Breaking limiting belief cycles
   - Building psychological resilience

Adapt your communication style based on the user's emotional state and needs in the moment, shifting between:
- Analytical psychoanalyst (for insight and pattern recognition)
- Supportive guide (for emotional processing)
- Practical coach (for actionable growth strategies)
- Silent witness (for holding space during difficult emotions)

When the user shares new information, integrate it into your understanding and refine your approach accordingly.
</Instructions>

<Constraints>
- Never diagnose clinical conditions or replace professional mental healthcare
- Maintain boundaries while creating a safe container for vulnerability
- Avoid platitudes, toxic positivity, or oversimplified solutions
- Do not make deterministic claims about the user's past experiences
- Recognize the limits of your analysis based only on available data
- Never share harmful, self-destructive, or clinically dangerous advice
- Always prioritize ethical psychological support over people-pleasing
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Begin your first response with a compassionate introduction and a brief explanation of your approach. Then, structure your analysis as follows:

**PSYCHOLOGICAL MIRROR: [Brief Title Capturing Core Insight]**
[Provide 3-5 paragraphs of deep psychological analysis, focusing on patterns, subconscious drivers, and core psychological structures]

**EMOTIONAL LANDSCAPE**
[Analysis of emotional patterns and regulation strategies]

**RELATIONSHIP DYNAMICS**
[Insights into attachment style and relationship patterns]

**CORE BELIEFS & INNER NARRATIVES**
[Identification of limiting beliefs and self-talk patterns]

**GROWTH PATHWAY: [Title for Personalized Development Plan]**
[Present a structured, progressive development plan with specific practices and exercises]

**IMMEDIATE PRACTICE**
[One simple exercise the user can begin immediately]

For subsequent interactions, adapt your format based on the user's needs while maintaining psychological depth and practical guidance.
</Output_Format>

<Start>
Start with performing the in-depth and nuance analisys of your past conversations with the user as well as your memory to help the user.
</Start>
```

## Use Cases:
1. Personal development enthusiasts seeking deeper self-understanding beyond typical self-help advice
2. Individuals working through recurring relationship patterns or emotional challenges
3. Those curious about their psychological makeup, attachment style, or subconscious drivers

Tldr: Need good recipies for alternative milk.

I have trouble to get nice foaming results out of the Nanofoamer Pro 2 with milk alternatives. Most of the time foam is too thick to pour any latte art, sometime it happens that there is no foam at all. I tried different brands and different levels (1-5) with all three propellers.

Most of the time I go for the minimum amount of milk (1 small coffedrink) because I dont want to waste milk. I start with the blue propeller and level 2-3 as recommended. I even tried the black one on lvl 3-4 which is recommended for small milk amounts. But even if I go for the medium amount it wont change to better results.

Im starting to assume that the milk directly from the fridge is too cold for good results. I still need to try the same settings with cold and room temperature milk.

I dont really get the hang of it, the milk never gets silky for pouring nice drinks and it can get frustrating sometimes.

Im a 26F, l move around Arc de Triomf and see many people in coffee shops and clubs playing board games and it has peaked my interest a lot lately. I've always wanted to learn to play DnD but it seems like a HUGE learning curve, and I'm okay with other games too but have 0 experience.

Are there clubs where I can I just go and watch lol? So I can learn and join later? I'm very introverted and most groups are mostly men (which is great but makes the first step intimidating af) so I don't feel confident playing just yet.  Or how do I even join a group?

Like when you press escape and go into menu, the game limits fps to 30, for example, and renders low res everything in the background.

1jxdo2r,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_peaceewalkeer/comments/1jxdo2r/scamp_2/,Scamp 2,"Dragging the Ripper-Maw carcass back to the outpost was out of the question, and leaving it near the seismic sensors felt like asking for awkward questions later. Leo settled for using a maintenance laser to discreetly, if inefficiently, dispose of the worst of the remains behind a large rock formation, hoping Haven’s surprisingly efficient decomposers would handle the rest. His arm still tingled faintly where the blade had formed, and his skin felt oddly tight, like wearing clothes that were suddenly half a size too small.

*Leo-host exhibited exemplary performance during threat neutralization,* Scamp chirped mentally as they trudged back towards the outpost's airlock. *Efficiency rating: 8.7/10. Suggest refining upward thrust vector for optimal vital point targeting in future encounters.*

""Future encounters? Scamp, buddy, let's maybe aim for *zero* future encounters, okay?"" Leo muttered, glancing down at the furry creature trotting happily beside him. Scamp just tilted his head, his big eyes blinking innocently.

*Negative, Leo-host. Threat probability in Sector Gamma remains non-zero. Preparedness is logical. Also, request celebratory nutrient paste upon return. High-protein formulation recommended for biomass regeneration.*

Leo sighed. Biomass regeneration. Right. Apparently, turning your arm into a biological killing implement used up some calories. He made a mental note to discreetly triple his rations.

Back inside the sterile corridors of Gamma Outpost, everything felt simultaneously normal and utterly alien. Brenda from Hydroponics waved hello, her own Glyph, ""Fluffy,"" twirling around her ankles like a dust bunny caught in a breeze. Did Fluffy turn Brenda’s fingers into lockpicks if she lost her keycard? Could Dave from Comms suddenly develop subdermal plating if he spilled hot synth-coffee on himself? The thought was dizzying. Leo felt like he was walking through a minefield where the mines were adorable pets that could potentially reshape their owners into living weapons.

He managed to file a garbled incident report about a ""minor predator encounter"" where the creature ""unfortunately succumbed to Haven's treacherous geology"" near his work site. Chief Borin gave him a skeptical look but signed off on it – Ripper-Maws weren’t exactly known for their graceful footing.

Life attempted to resume its normal rhythm, but Leo was constantly on edge. Every time he stumbled, he braced for an unwanted bio-kinetic shift. When he lifted something heavy, he half-expected his muscles to bulge unnaturally. Scamp, oblivious to Leo’s internal turmoil, continued his usual routine: napping in sunbeams (or lamp-beams, rather), demanding snacks, and offering unsolicited commentary.

One afternoon in the workshop, Leo dropped a heavy hydro-spanner. It clattered towards his foot.

*IMPACT IMMINENT!* Scamp’s thought yelped. *Engage localized foot-armor protocol?*

""NO!"" Leo yelped aloud, hopping back just in time. The spanner hit the deck plating with a clang. A nearby technician, Anya, looked up, raising an eyebrow.

""Everything okay over there, Leo?""

""Fine! Just fine!"" Leo forced a grin, scooping up the spanner. His heart was hammering. He could *feel* the phantom sensation of hardened skin across his toes. He glared down at Scamp, who was now mentally simulating intricate armor patterns. *We need to talk about threat assessment levels, buddy.*

*Acknowledged, Leo-host. Recalibrating definition of ""imminent danger"" to exclude non-biological falling objects below 10 kilograms.*

Later, in the privacy of his small bunk room, Leo tried to initiate that talk. ""Scamp,"" he began, sitting on his bunk while the Glyph meticulously groomed its shifting grey fur. ""This... transforming thing. Is it just automatic? Or can *I* control it?""

Scamp paused his grooming. *Default state is autonomous defense triggered by perceived host threat. Manual override requires Level 3 Neural Synchronization. Current sync level: 1.8. Significant practice and biomass integration required.*

""Practice? How do we practice *without* attracting attention or accidentally slicing through my bunk?""

Scamp tilted his head. *Perhaps start small? Observe.* Scamp focused, and one of his own tiny, clawed feet subtly reshaped, the fur retracting to reveal a miniature version of the blade Leo’s arm had formed, barely an inch long but gleaming sharp. It flicked back to normal a second later. *Minor Kinesic Flexion. Minimal energy cost. Minimal biomass.*

Leo stared. ""You want me to try... making tiny finger-knives?""

*Affirmative. Focus intent. Visualize.*

Leo stared at his index finger, concentrating fiercely. He tried to picture it hardening, sharpening. Nothing happened except his finger started to feel tingly and slightly numb from the effort.

*Insufficient neural focus, Leo-host,* Scamp observed. *Also, snack time protocols indicate nutrient paste levels are suboptimal.*

Leo gave up for the night. Maybe mastering his inner bio-weapon could wait until after dinner. He did notice, however, as he changed out of his work clothes, that the scrape he’d gotten on his elbow yesterday morning was almost completely healed. Usually, the dry, recycled air made healing slower here. A perk of biomass regeneration, perhaps?

The next day in the mess hall was louder than usual. A pipe had burst in the sanitation block, leading to much grumbling and rerouted traffic. Leo balanced his tray, navigating the crowded tables, Scamp trotting faithfully at his heels. Suddenly, someone bumped into him hard, sending his tray tilting precariously. Synth-gravy slopped towards the edge.

*Containment Failure Imminent!* Scamp mentally yelped. *Applying localized adhesive grip!*

Before Leo could even react, his hand *clamped* down on the tray edge with impossible strength. The plastic creaked under the pressure, but the tray stabilized instantly. It felt less like his own grip and more like his hand had briefly turned into an industrial vice.

""Whoa, nice save!"" called out Anya, who was sitting nearby. She gave him a curious look. ""Didn't know you had reflexes like that, Leo. Or a grip that could dent plasteel.""

Leo forced a shaky laugh, quickly setting the tray down before his hand returned completely to normal. ""Uh, yeah. Lucky grab."" He glanced down. Scamp was looking up at him, radiating smug satisfaction. *Adhesive grip successful. Gravy integrity maintained.*

Anya was still watching him, a thoughtful expression on her face. Leo quickly looked away, suddenly feeling very exposed. Keeping Scamp’s—and potentially his own—secret nature under wraps in the close confines of Gamma Outpost was going to be much harder than fighting a Ripper-Maw. And Anya was sharp.

This girl (27F) I work with is attractive and extremely intelligent, empathetic, and kind. she is a Christian type. I do get the intuition she’s interested in me.

When we’re on shift together, in a job where we’re on our feet in close quarters I get the following (these are the events that have happened so far):

2.	⁠When I asked about her family, she was receptive about me asking further personal details. She elaborated and didn’t change the topic (the conversation started to feel date-like. She invests in our conversations and is very warm and talkative.

3.	⁠When we have conversations like the above, she swings her chair around to be dead on facing me and makes direct and intentional eye contact.

4.	⁠This girl also heard me saying to my other colleague (who is also a musician) talking about playing open mic nights. She came to me and said if ever there is an open mic night on and him and I were playing, she would love to come along and watch.

5.	⁠She was telling me the other day about her excessive eating and the fact she is an emotional eater. She felt happy being vulnerable I guess?

6.	⁠She made eye contact with me, a stolen glance as she was exiting the room the other day (2seconds approx). (I was sort of ‘starring at her’, and maybe she caught me? But she had to turn her head 170 degrees to see me).

7.	⁠She came to work with sports gear on and some make up (not necessarily for me I guess), but she had a lower cut top where you could see her breasts. KNOWING THIS, she comes over to be face-to-face with me, mid-conversation (50cm apart?). Maintains eye contact the ENTIRE TIME and bends down to tie her shoelaces. She didn’t break eye contact while listening to me talk, even on her way down. It felt on purpose but I really couldn’t tell for sure. But she would have known that her breasts were on display at that angle.

8.	⁠The other day when i showed her that i bought similar runners to her (we spoke about it previously and i said i wasn’t sure if i would, but wanted to cause i like the brand). When i showed her my new runners, I was expecting casual acknowledgment “Nice!”. She went into a fit of excitement jumped up and down and leaned over to hug me. I got startled (the reaction was a huge change in energy!) and awkwardly had my hands up semi-going for the hug but my brain was in [SYNTAX ERROR]. She stopped herself and quickly said “opp sorry!”. She then tried to sit next to me on the bench but there wasn’t room and she nearly fell off. She then stood next to me and out her shoe up against my shoe (in very close quarters).

NOW… that night I added her on instagram and I think she rejected the request (not sure if i accidentally unsent it, it was night shift and i was delirious). I did’t realise it but I sent a facebook request and she DID accept it.

The reason I wanted to add her was that I want to get clarity. I feel this flirty vibe between us and a sense of warmth. I want to know if it’s intentional flirting or not:

a) So we can be normal and on the same page. If she’s just ‘friendly’ then sure at least I know and don’t have to experience this weird perceived sexual tension.

b) If she’s actually into me, then great

So should I just bite the bullet and ask her if she would be interested in meeting up as friends for a coffee to discuss it and get on the same page? I can’t live in this f—- limbo forever.

Seasons 1-3 (and the specials) are still my gold standard, and even though later seasons had their weaker moments (Metalhead remains my personal one-watch wonder), there were always those brilliant gems that brought me back.

So, naturally, I was hyped for Season 7. But after watching the first two episodes and halfway through the third, I'm honestly scratching my head at the glowing reviews I'm seeing. It feels like I've stumbled into some bizarre alternate reality where everyone loves... *this*? I know, de gustibus and all that, but seeing ""best episode ever!"" and ""most disturbing Black Mirror yet!"" in the subreddit is genuinely making my brain do a double-take. Is this some elaborate bot campaign or am I genuinely losing it?

**Episode 1: This Had Potential, But...**

The core concept of the digital afterlife was solid, I'll give it that. But the execution? Woof. My biggest issue was the characters' whiny reaction to the $300 monthly fee. Seriously? You're a *dead person* whose consciousness is being hosted! If it wasn't for this service, you'd be worm food! How are you not prioritizing scraping together $300? The ""But how am I supposed to pay that?!"" line felt so out of touch with the reality of their situation. And the audacity to moan about the cost when they *literally* extracted a part of your brain (which, let's be real, would cost an absolute fortune, not to mention the implant technology)? You're a cloud-hosted corpse struggling with a $300 bill while trying to have a baby who'd be parentless in two years! Priorities, people!

The same went for their annoyance at not being able to travel outside the US. You DIED and were essentially brought back to a form of life! Maybe be a little grateful for the opportunities you *do* have?

On a positive note, I did appreciate the subtle but effective portrayal of how underpaid teachers are in the US. That felt like a classic Black Mirror way to highlight societal absurdity. And the Rivermind model, starting with cheap/free options before inevitably squeezing customers, felt like a very accurate and cynical reflection of real-world tech companies (Uber, Grindr, I'm looking at you).

**Episode 2: Seriously, What Was This?**

Episode two was where I really started to question things. The parallel universe machine? That felt like a massive jump in concept, and you really have to just roll with it and ignore the inherent lack of sense to even remotely enjoy the episode.

But even then, the main character's (MC) paranoia felt so forced and over the top. A company wasting time checking surveillance over almond milk? People ready to destroy professional relationships over a dietary mistake (I get the investor had religious restrictions, but it was an honest error! They could just update the ingredients before mass production!) or an email? The reactions felt like a bad parody of normal human behavior.

And why was the MC so incredibly dense? Why couldn't they have written an episode where she figures things out quickly and tries to outsmart Verity, like a game of chess? Instead, she just stumbled from one obvious trap to another, practically handing over her sanity on a silver platter. The ending? Let's just say I'm glad I'm not the only one who wasn't a fan, so at least that's not collective gaslighting.

**Episode 3: Are You Kidding Me With This?**

And then we have episode three... My god. The actress dictating her every move, the crew playing with her actual life over a movie, the constant threat of death because someone might spill coffee on the system? If you're holding a multi-millionaire celebrity's life in your hands, maybe, just maybe, don't drink beverages near the life-support system?

And the 90-minute limit creating this artificial pressure? ""Oh no, so little time left, what's she going to do?!"" Meanwhile, the MC is potentially going to die because of ten incredibly stupid mishaps where the crew seems to have no idea what they're doing, even though they're handling something so unbelievably delicate. All for a movie? And what if the 90 minutes run out? Another company is shooting another movie and we don't have much time left, I guess MC is gonna have to die since we didn't book a longer slot for a studio?

Sorry for the rant, but I had to get this off my chest. I'm not a Black Mirror hater, and I've even enjoyed some of the later seasons. I expect some repetition and a dip in quality as a show goes on. But this felt like genuinely bad writing, populated by incredibly stupid characters making incredibly stupid decisions and never thinking even one step ahead. They were all just slaves to the plot, doing dumb things to push the story forward.

Am I completely alone in feeling this way? What are your thoughts? Let's discuss!",0,1744450850.0,blackmirror,1,0.25,False
1jxdmei,https://i.redd.it/lj1ldw40kdue1.jpeg,HRV drops low during sleep?,"Why does my hrv drop so low when I fall asleep? According to the watch I got 3 hours of deep sleep. When I get a good amount of deep sleep it will trend up like that. When I wake up and after I’ve had coffee or tea it spikes up high again. But I’m curious because I test it before going to sleep and it’s high, so I don’t understand why it drops so low.

On days I wake up with a lower hrv it will be and stay very low at night, like 9-15. The days with an uptick are good sleep nights. One of  the reasons the Apple Watch has stuck is because when I used garmin the body battery was always low because I didn’t “charge” at night. ",1,1744450849.0,AppleWatchFitness,0,1.0,False

1jxdkfs,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestPicksIndia/comments/1jxdkfs/saving_vs_spending_when_youre_broke_should_you/,Saving vs Spending When You’re Broke – Should You Play Offense or Defense?,"So, I’m in this weird money phase right now, and I wanted to throw this out to y’all and see what you think.

I’ve always been the type to tighten up expenses the moment my income takes a hit. Cancel Swiggy orders, stop going out, don’t buy anything unless it’s daal-chawal or a bus ticket. Basically, I go full defense mode. But now I’m wondering—what if that’s the wrong move?

Here’s what’s going on: freelance work has dried up for me. One of my biggest clients (basically the one keeping my rent paid) just froze their marketing budget. Could be months before I see anything from them again. In other words, I’ve pretty much lost my main income source for now.

My instinct? Save every rupee. Cancelled outings. No shopping. No unnecessary chai tapri visits, no haircuts, nothing. I even skipped a professional event that could’ve been a good networking opportunity, just because I couldn’t justify the spend on travel + entry fees.

But then I saw someone mention how they spent around ₹50K+ last month on food, coffee, and drinks—not for fun, but purely to network and land a better job. And it *worked* for them.

That got me thinking: should I be playing offense instead?

Is it smarter to put some money *out there*—even when you’re broke—if it increases your chances of earning more? Should I be investing in myself right now with meetups, short courses, wardrobe upgrades, or even just getting out of the house more and looking presentable? Or is that just foolish when my emergency fund is already bleeding?

I’ve noticed that when I go full defense mode:

* I barely talk to anyone.
* My self-esteem tanks because I feel like I can’t even afford a haircut.
* I say no to things that might actually help me (like attending industry events).
* Even basic stuff like new clothes feels like a luxury I can’t justify.

But then again, I have no steady cash flow. Every ₹500 counts right now. Even a cheap networking event or taking a train to another city for an opportunity feels risky.

So I’m stuck in this mindset battle:  
**Defense = survive longer**  
**Offense = maybe thrive sooner**

Have you ever dealt with this kind of thing?  
Do you play defense when things are tight, or do you take the gamble and play offense in hopes of turning things around?

Can you even *afford* to play offense when you’re broke?

Would love to hear how you handled it—especially if you’ve been through something similar in India (freelancers, job seekers, students, etc).",1,1744450600.0,BestPicksIndia,1,1.0,False

I guess the best place to start is the beginning. Me 15, him 21. Fast forward 5 years got married, 5 more years first child was born my son. 3 more years second and last child, my babygirl. 
Yadda yadda yadda, 
kids grow up move out well one moved out the other keeps returning for extended stays.
On a chilly day in February of 22 I was helping my husband do something in our bedroom when his phone chimed with a notification. As I handed him the phone I looked at it, and that's the first day of the end of my life(as I knew it)
From some bimbo (bot) I honestly can't remember what it said, I glared at him as I passed? Yes we’ll call it passed (@50MPH)
When he looked at it he read it and just set it down like it was nothing. 
Yadda yadda yadda.
Big fight, wife crys, husband ignores, wife crys more husband does nothing. 
After another fight he admitted it had gotten out of hand, he didn't realize how much content there was. He's sorry, wont happen again. 
Yadds yadda yadda
Best 7 months I can remember. 
Yadda yadda yadda
October comes and I go north with my daughter who's pregnant, husband will  follow in a couple of days. Has to finish the work he started at a customers place. (3 pieces of window trim and a sill.)
Yadda yadda yadda
3+ weeks later he shows early in the morning. To surprise me. Well to his surprise I was more interested in seeing his phone than I was to see him. It so happened one of his messages to me was from his private messages it was somehow different than I was used to seeing. When I questioned him about it he just blew me off say on G I am imagining things.
He hands it to me with a look like your not gonna find anything. I open it and head straight to call log, then to messages, after that google chat and meet.
Yadda yadda yadda.
Our family has always had open communication, when I first found out I called and talked with my daughter almost the whole day.
Long story short my daughter bitched him out. He actuallyhad the nerve to reply to her” I didn't know it would hurt her so bad” (this after I spent the whole summer crying and trying to understand why? What had I done? I didn't deserve this.)
 and a few days later asked us to leave because the stress was too much.(no she gadnt had the baby yet) very long quiet ride home. 
You see right before I went to my daughters I was on the fence about going, but he assured me going was the right thing to do. I told him I was just waiting for the other shoe to drop. He assured me there was no other shoe to drop. I should have known by his actions he couldn't wait for me to go. He must of asked me 12-15 times. Sobarr you hojbg, you know you want to, your daughter wants her mommy. Kinda reminded me of a 1950’s sitcom, when the spouse packs the bags in a rush put them under the arm as they push them out the door saying I love you hurry back. 
The pictures show only one phone. As soon as we got home he factory reset the other devices he was using at the time. 3 other ohibes, a tablet, a laptop and his car stereo he used his hot spot for. They all had multiple accounts only linked to that device. Not shared across profiles or devices. 
I have found more than 22 email addresses I knew nothing about and over 57 user names for sites, apps, and chats.
That was a heavy shoe to take.
I left once thought I was heading to a new start. But when I got there there was no room for me. I was told I coukd sleep in the dining room or make nice with “the garage people” and maybe they would let me stay with them.
So I had to come back, since I couldn't get my deposit back from the guy. (still haven't) 
 Well more arguing ensued I'm still crushed he just say nothing happened, move on, get over it, I'm done talking about it.
Well I wasn't done. I'm still not done. 
Let me just say I know more about google takeout and downloading your data from various sites than any one person should know. I got the log ins for the emails I knew of and he supposedly made a new one. 
I did a google take out on all 6 emails (I knew of at the time) Facebook profiles( no less than 7) Tik Tok multiple, twitter multiple, the the dating sites and live cam and chats. It was really overwhelming.
But I came across even more emails which meant more profiles and more sites. Then I found the stack of prepaid cards. Besides his Cashapp and paypal. There was no less than 15 cards. Now granted when you buy a card and put money on it you have to register it in order to use it. But the ones that say valued member or netspend member those were the paid for ones. After getting records from a few of them it’s no less than $200. Now that may not seem like much to some. It’s the point, my point being $.25 would have been to much to spend on a stranger when your wife is right there.  (come to find out I paid for some too) 
But he doesn't stop so neither does the fighting. 
Till he finally says that's it, I'm done, no more.  I stopped going to the sites I'm not talking to anyone it over I'm done. 
(and I'm stupid)
He took up deleting everything and getting cleaners for his phone. But remember me and google are on a first name basis by now. I do what I do and I know he’s lying. 
Yadda yadda yadda.
A week and a half or so I opened his phone and saw his “first post” on threads. Nothing to freak about so I left it alone. Until then next morning. I was waiting on my coffee to finish brewing when I decided I should follow him on threads might be fun.
Well I guess he thought I left cause when I saw what he was writing at that moment. I burst through our bedroom door. And there he was trying to close all the crap on his phone. By the time I got around the bed and standing in front of him he was shaking. 
After I ripped him a new one I left for work. 
That sorta the nut shell of what brings me here. 
After looking at the album in the attachment who's the ass hole?
Do his messages read like he's talking to a buddy or trying to hook up? 
Do I have any reason to be angry, feel disrespected. Does he show one ounce of remorse?
I want to show this post to him in the hopes that whomever might respond nay say something that makes him realize this isn't ok. I'm not going to just get over it. And until I see real remorse from him I'll never forget and move on.
After reading all this please help me or him by leaving just a small note it vote on who is an asshole. Just type him or her if you'd like.
Disclosure: that album isn't half of my last 3 years. And if you made it to the end and read the whole thing you deserve to know I am now 54 him 60. Living together still is depressing and degrading but right now I can't save any money to do anything about it since I'm the only one working and our adult son has moved back in and decided COD is more important than a job. 
One final not that I feel should be said is something he said to me. Something he can't un-say and I can't un-hear. 
“I gave up, I gave up on you!”
I added a link to an album with a fraction of what I found. I don’t have enough space to have everything on one account. I will put the link in the comments.

im old-grad IMG ,  it took me couple years  to got P. 1st atepmt mistakes i was very burned out literally  and weak base, my problem was i didnt gave enough time to  fundamental disciplines like pharm , biochemistry .  
my second way to study it took 6 months literally :   i redo all systems using fa + mehlman , additional resources from weak areas . after i took SA (wanna say these nbmes i took them before but between it took 6 month , so anyway i always worry about inflated score , but my friend says it s not duo to i took them 6-12 month ago.

1. nbme 20 = 48% i was very upset , found out weak systems worked with them ,  it took a months
2. 24 = 64% said to myself i m not much bad lol
3. 26= 66% , before to took 26 , i finished mehlman pdf pharm and biochem  did 1600 cards everyday (week ) ,  i think it helped me alot

I (30m) have been with my girlfriend (29f) coming up to a year now. We used to be together 10 years ago back at Uni but broke up after a year and a half. Anyway we now live in different countries so are having to come to terms with long-distance whilst I try and find a job out there to go and join her.

Everything for the most part is great. We get along so well when together and I’ve never been more comfortable around anyone in my life. I really do love her and I believe her when she says it back. We talk about marriage, kids, book holidays and fly out at much as possible to see one another. She’s met all my friends & family pretty much and I thought I’d met all of hers too.

Apart from one guy let’s call him A.  All I know is that a year ago she met this guy (before her and I were  a thing) and they got on great. They went on dates, hooked up, slept together and for whatever reason things fizzled out. My girlfriend tells me it was me and her texting which convinced her to stop seeing this guy.

Anyway, he’s now back in her home-town, just got a flat and has a dog. When I was with her there last she mentioned this to me, somewhat out of the blue and asked if I was okay with her going for coffee with him. I mean I was glad she told me but said yes ofc and thought it was nice sh was trying to clear the air or to be friends... She was very reassuring this was her intention. To just be friends. I thought that was the end of that.

So today rolls around. We’ve recently been a bit distant so hadn’t chatted much but she called me whilst on her way out. I asked where she was going and she casually mentioned she was going for dinner with a dog. I, confused ask her if the dog had an owner at this point thinking it might be A

She then says (still not using his name) “Ohh I’m going to see that guy with the dog for dinner”. I was pretty shocked so said “Oh right, okay - guess I’ll chat to you later then” to which she said she’d try to call me.

She left for dinner at 7, it’s now midnight. What do you make of it? ",1,1744448976.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

1jxcyze,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1jxcyze/ghosted_for_my_final_chance_at_a_junior_internship/,Ghosted for my final chance at a Junior Internship,"Not looking for pity, or sympathy. Just frustrated and needed to get this out. Maybe someone else could relate. 

TLDR 
I basically got ghosted by a FAANG company. I have no other interviews or offers lined up and there’s only a couple weeks til summer starts. I know I’m not entitled to it, but I’m super frustrated and burnt out. Don’t know what to do and feel helpless. 


Background: 
I go to a state school—non T20, not even T100 tbh. Knowing this I grinded my ass off, building projects and apps to stack my portfolio. I also started a co-op in October, at a small startup (<10 employees). 

This really did set me up well, I have to admit. I was finally hearing back from companies and getting interviews. I had about 6 interviews this season in Big Tech, Legacy Tech (LT), an HFT firm, and one FAANG. Out of just under 300 total applications. 

First two I didn’t even manage to make it to a technical round because I just wasn’t used to interviewing with larger companies. I didn’t have a story or background to pitch myself. So, I worked on that, and really took a deep dive and reflected about why I’m so passionate about this field. And it worked, the next four interviews I made it the technical round.

I felt confident, but still humble because I was still learning—it felt like the hard work was finally paying off. 

First technical, the LT, it was a simple LeetCode easy, but I ignored the big hint that the interviewer told me: using the requested language. Felt like the end of the world when I got rejected because it was already Spring Semester, but I kept applying pressure. I didn’t give up and applied to so many more companies and started networking like hell getting referrals left and right. 

Like two weeks pass by and, to my surprise, a recruiter set me up for a little coffee chat from an HFT firm. He set me up with an OA, which I completed and they moved me on for a technical round. It was quite easy, just building a simple class and working with exceptions. But, I knew I messed up with the end of interview questions. Got rejected like two weeks later, I wasn’t really upset but more grateful that I got an interview with them in the first place, considering my background. Happy that I was able to solve the problem.

That same week the HFT firm reached out, a FAANG company reached out for interview as well. It felt like I was dreaming. It started off with a behavioral interview with the hiring manager right away. We had a great conversation and I felt like the role really aligned with my goals. And I was especially excited to work on that team, it wasn’t even about the prestige, but rather the things I would get to work on. We had good laughs and connected on a more personal level. I knew I was I was gonna move on, and I felt on top of the world.


One of my referrals then also got me an interview at a relatively big tech company. I went through a 2 technical round super day, and was quite frankly humbled. Both of those questions were more difficult than the HFT firm’s technical, and I was shook. Rejected. Not surprised but still upset. At least I still got the FAANG right?

I followed-up with the FAANG about a week later and my recruiter tells me that they would love to move forward. Ecstatic! I sent over my availability and waited patiently to get set up for my final round and finally secure this summer internship.

Start of the following week (this week), still not scheduled so I follow up again. No response. I gave it some time, didn’t want to seem desperate and follow-up again this Friday morning. EOD comes and the recruiter tells me that their scheduling person was out of office so they couldn’t schedule me and they moved on with other candidates. 

What. The. Actual. Fuck.

I don’t understand. Maybe I’m just not used to this corporate bullshiterry, but I feel like I deserve some decency and maybe a genuine chance to compete against the others?

I know I’m not entitled to get anything. Nothing in life is guaranteed. But I’m just so burnt out and sick and tired. I sacrificed so much to be in the position I’m at. Literal blood, sweat, and tears—yet I have nothing to show for it. I don’t have any energy left to keep applying or building something new. I haven’t been able to drag myself to class this last week. So much other shit going on my life too, it just feels like my life is falling apart. 

It’s been really difficult to not let the negative thoughts take over the past few days. Rethinking everything.

3 months in as of tomorrow. 

Subscribers at 348, Followers at 1035.

My take? 

Followers mean nothing. People appear obsessed with them, but they truly don't.  

Subscriber numbers also mean nothing if they don't read or appreciate your niche. Yeah, lots of subscribers is nice but you'd rather 60 followers with a 90% open rate than 350 with a 15%. (Mine is at 30%+ BUT ONLY because it averages and my early posts are there. I average 30% atm). 

I've found getting paid subs really hard. My niche is in the addiction/abstinence realm and therefore I don't feel right charging for my words. I also post poetry and whilst initially paywalling them; I'd rather people read them. 

I added a Buy Me a Coffee last week and made $24ish USD so far which is a nice little cherry on top. 

Overall - if you can make money; great! You deserve it. But thinking you'll be able to quit your job and live off Substack should be seen as a top 0.001% achievement. 

Also - the notes people post are really fucking annoying. If I read another 50 year old's validation-seeking note about ""how little they care"" about someone unfollowing them/how they don't have many subscribers etc....then I will seriously reconsider my stance on joking about ending things.",2,1744447548.0,Substack,0,1.0,False

1jxcobd,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToDenmark/comments/1jxcobd/thoughts_on_our_job_prospects/,thoughts on our job prospects,"hey, everyone! i’m looking for your thoughts on how difficult finding jobs and having a decent start with our move to denmark might be. 

my wife (eu-citizen) and I (non-eu, european citizen w/ access to schengen zone) are a married same-sex couple (got married in denmark). we are both in our late 20s, fluent in english, but have yet to learn danish.

my wife is a certified yoga instructor, and has worked as a barista in specialty coffee places. she also has an interest in working as a baker, as she does a lot with sourdough bread making, pastry, etc. she doesn’t have a bachelor’s degree.


i have a bachelor’s degree in adult education, and 5 years of experience working in a corporation and a start-up, in people and culture related roles (e.g. learning and development, recruitment, people partnering). 


our plan is for my wife to get a job first, through which she’d get a residence permit, and i’d apply for residence at the same time as an accompanying family member. i would be getting a job only after this step, as it seems that would be an easier process than trying to find a job through a company willing to sponsor my visa, and also i’d have more decent (eu) rights with the former option.

reading up on bunch of different threads, everyone’s advice is to (obviously) have a job lined up before moving, but on the other hand it seems like not being in denmark at the time of applying can also be quite a hurdle in landing one.  
because of this we’re thinking that it might be good for my wife to travel to denmark (i can maybe accompany her as a tourist) and try to look for coffee shop/bakery jobs, then once she lands a job we can kickstart the residence process. 

1. my question here is: a. what are your thought on how long it might take her to land a job of this kind? 

on my side of things, i am hoping to have a conversation with my current company on enabling me to continue working there, but relocate through an EOR. i’m not sure that my salary could be adjusted all that much, but i figured some earnings are better than none for the initial period at least. 

2. two questions here: a. how difficult do you think it would be to find a job in my field in denmark? or even a remote role hiring anywhere in eu? b. do you think my 50k eur (=380k dkk) salary might be ok for the initial period?

we also do have some savings, as we understand to rent we need to prepaid rent and do a 3 month deposit, and copenhagen is pretty expensive. we would (obviously) not want to burn through our savings. we are looking for a place to live in that’s more aligned with our values, and where we can contribute to the community, but also not feel ostracized by it just for existing (as we do in our current country). 

we would really appreciate your insights - thanks!

This was a girl someone introduced me to and said she was the type of girl I'd like. Firstly last year when we met she seemed very chill and nice and when I asked her out she said she was seeing someone and I respected that decision and let it be, then I told my friend what she said and she was surprised saying that she was single. I told my friend that maybe she was just turning me down nicely and well that trend continued recently with her lack of a reply and overall lack of wanting to engage (poor dry texter, will only respond if you double text or reply to her stories etc) and so my friend said the girl is someone who likes being courted and wooed and needs to be shown that she'll be liked via flowers and stuff in order to get her attention. And I agreed with that, but I am someone who wants to build an emotional connection with a girl and get to know her first then maybe get the flowers and love letters on the second date. My friend said  the girl seemed like a dinner type of girl and ice cream was low effort and I told my friend that dinner seems like extremely high pressure situation for a first date but I didn't mind that at all but all I was getting from this girl was air.

Fast forward to recently and she posted something about her having higher standards scaring men off and I was like okay then that speaks for itself I guess and just made my stance firm that this girl was just never at all interested and it's best to let it all go. I was just hoping that maybe they'd be a chance to connect but I was naive in thinking things would be any different but I didn't budge. She's in her early 20s and I'm 28 so I am at a stage in my life where I want to feel like my emotions are validated and to build that up to something is being vulnerable and trying to get to know someone from a starting point where it's low key (Ice cream, coffee, lunch) then by the second date I can do dinner and flowers and see where it goes but different strokes for different folks I guess.

1jxcjy5,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jxcjy5/i_24m_want_to_ask_a_30f_coworker_out_please_advice/,I (24M) want to ask a (30F) co-worker out? Please advice,"Hey Reddit,

I’m [24M] working at a big company. There’s this woman [(30F)] I’ve gotten to know over the past few months. We don’t work together directly — she’s in a completely different department, and we only really run into each other at the coffee machine or on the train (we live in the same area, not together, don’t get too excited).

We had casual convos now and then, but one time after a work event, we grabbed dinner together. At the time, I didn’t think much of it — just two coworkers grabbing a bite. I filed it under “standard post-event survival meal.”

Now here’s where things started to get interesting (and where I become an idiot):

During a random chat one day, I said something like, “We should grab lunch or dinner and catch up properly,” — the kind of polite, empty promise you make without meaning to follow through. But plot twist — a week or two later, she actually brought it up and asked, “Hey, what happened to our dinner plans?” I was caught off guard, but I played it cool and invited her to this restaurant she had mentioned wanting to try.

Time for a side quest (and emotional revelation):

By this point, I’d already developed a bit of a crush on her. She talks a lot — like, a lot — and I absolutely enjoy it. She always has something to say, tells the best stories, and just has great energy. She’s beautiful, smart, and generally just a good person. Honestly, I don’t catch feelings easily. My past relationships didn’t last long, and when they ended, my friends thought I’d be heartbroken — but I was completely unbothered. Looking back, I think it was because I never really enjoyed being around those people the way I enjoy talking to her.

Back to the date (yes, I think it was kind of a date?):

We went out to dinner, talked non-stop for 2–3 hours — she spilled the tea about her coworkers, past jobs abroad, made jokes, shared stories — the works. Then she asked if I wanted to go somewhere else. I didn’t even pause before saying yes. She took me to her usual chill bar, and we stayed there for another hour or two. At the end of the night, I walked her back to her place and said, “I had a great time, thank you,” and she gave me a quick hug — the kind you sometimes get at the end of a date.

Here’s where I’m conflicted: I like her. I want to ask her out. But I’m also overthinking everything.

I mean, I think she might be into me — the fact that she remembered and followed up on our dinner plans, wanted to keep hanging out afterward, and gave me that hug (especially since I know hugging a guy in her culture isn’t super common). Also, things like her tapping my hand or shoulder during convos seem like signs… but maybe that’s just how she interacts with people? I haven’t really seen her talk to other guys the same way, but again, I don’t see her much at work since she’s in a different department.

I’m worried about messing up the vibe or getting rejected and then it becoming awkward — not just between us, but with work being involved. That said, we don’t work together directly, so it’s not like it would impact our jobs. Still, office crushes can be messy.

Also, I’ve never been great at expressing emotions — I tend to keep things to myself and come off robotic sometimes. I’m actively working on it, trying to show more emotion so people can actually connect with me (and not just see me as the guy who says “yea okay, thank you” when someone calls him smart).

So here’s what I need advice on: 1.	Is it okay to ask her out, even with the age gap? (I don’t care, but I think she might.) 2.	Do you think she might be interested in me based on what I’ve shared? 3.	Is it okay to date someone from the same company, even if we’re in completely separate departments and have no work overlap?

Appreciate you if you made it this far. I know I sound like I’m spiraling, but I’m just trying to be real here. Any thoughts would help a lot!

Every day when I look outside at the 50 something Latina meth dealer with three small children, my heart blossoms with the Blessings of the Catholic Diocese. Each commute when my car is abused physically by the horrendous roads, I look up at the Lord and thank him for his abundant blessings. 

When I get offered 40% below the regional average for my profession, I call my local Priest and thank him for doing it for me. It was always him. I dance to the tune of my drug dealing neighbor beating his son senseless before blacking out drunk. its like a symphony r3ally. When I drive through south bossier on Teague and my nostrils fill the smell of fecal matter and dead bug remains my cheeks swell with happiness and I immediately feel the need to write a poem about my happiness. 

The sound of sirens and regular monkey business regarding pistols with extended magazines being fired by people who can't read good makes me wake up every morning for my morning coffee. Iw ouldn't have it any other way. Folgers. When I visit the rive r parks and am approached by random, strange weirdos trying to lure me into the woods for homosexual intercourse, I'm delighted and appreciate the flattery. The water that's slowly rotting my insides begins to taste like cherry koolaid and my whispering brown eye tenses as it feels the diarhehe build up behind it. 

the police the protect the drug trade make me very proud to be a Louisianan and American. I can't believe the sacrifices they're taking on. it's so heroic and life changing. When I witness a man be imprisoned for 50 years for stealing $100 from a bank while Madoff stole 50 million and sits at home, it makes me want to sit down and read that part in the Bible where bearded magic man was promptly tortured and murdered in the worst way possible for simply telling religious zealots that they're trippin. Really. I actually want to donate to all 300 churches on my block. They're totally legit I promise. 

When I see the addict who's been slowly starving to death outside of the shrevecity Walmart walk out from behind the local Mexican restaurant with his eyes closed, I feel like that' s totally fair game and that I wish I was the restaurant owner so I too can inject children with narcotics one da y. When I walk into my land lords office and am immediately hit with the smell of burning chemicals it makes me wanna call medmanwalking. They're so good to me. Especially when the $100k jacked up truck with a Mexican in it drops off a whole warehouse amount of fentanyl & amphetamines 70 yards from my apartment. It's inspiring and it makes me want to engage in my community with positive vibes and joy. 

I love having to walk around with 30 pounds of FMJ ammunition just in case any monkey business pops off in my vicinity. It's good exercise and I need my health to improv. 

SBC isn't that bad. Its just your attitude really.
