1gsiofo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dentistry/comments/1gsiofo/dealing_with_gossiping_as_a_dentist/,Dealing with gossiping as a dentist,"Basically as the title says, how do you deal when the receptionist and dental assistant are constantly gossiping about your work behind your back?

Been working in this practice for 5 months after the previous dentist got pregnant. Now it's just me and the boss,also dentist. He is not there very often so I do 80% of the procedures.

I get along with all 4 assistant but with one of them am especially good, we also meet sometimes for coffee outside work. And she told me yesterday all the fluff the other 3 are talking about me. Example: that I leave caries under fillings, that my telescopic prosthetic dentures are not optimal, that I prescribed wrong doses of antibiotics etc.... this really made me upset because I do my work the best that I can and always ask my boss to come in and help when I'm not sure about something (which he does gladly).

I have had this problem like 3 months ago with them and the boss cleared it up with them and it's been quiet and nice since then. But now it's the same story repeating itself and I just don't know what to do.

I have less than a year of work experience and they (assistants) compare me all the time to the previous dentist who had 10 years experience and I just can't cope with it anymore.

1gsilgt,https://i.redd.it/t4f5yzmsz71e1.png,How Many Times a Day do You Check Your Investments?,"Every morning, the first thing I do—even before getting out of bed—is check my investment portfolio. It's almost automatic now, like brushing my teeth or pouring coffee. Except this habit doesn’t soothe me; it grips me with a strange combination of anticipation and dread.

I tell myself it’s just a quick check, just to stay informed, but it never is. The numbers on the screen dictate my mood for the day. A green arrow pointing up fills me with a fleeting sense of accomplishment, as if I’ve personally earned that little bump in my net worth. But when the numbers dip into the red, it feels like failure—irrational, I know, but there’s no separating the numbers from my emotions.

And it’s not just mornings. Lunchtime? I’m refreshing the app. Before bed? One last look. Even during conversations or work meetings, my mind drifts back to the portfolio, wondering if the market has shifted since the last time I checked.

I know it’s unhealthy. I know markets fluctuate and that long-term gains matter more than daily movements. I know I’m supposed to stay the course and trust the process. But knowing doesn’t stop the compulsive urge. It’s like I’m chasing some elusive control over a system I have no real power over.

The worst part? It doesn’t even feel productive. It’s not like I’m making significant changes each time I look. I’m just staring at the numbers, hoping they’ll align with my expectations, and when they don’t, I spiral into frustration or anxiety.

I wish I could let go. I wish I could look less, care less, and live more. But every time I resolve to step back, there’s always that ""what if"" tugging at me. What if today is the day something major happens and I miss it? What if I don’t act and regret it later?

It’s a constant battle between logic and compulsion, between trust and fear. And most days, the screen wins.

As a young single guy from middle class for the longest time I was prepared to eat from anywhere and anything.

Even for alcohol, I wpuld prefer visiting a cheap uncle bar. I wonder why this dichotomy.

PS - None of the women in question post much at all on Instagram. So the argument that they want to visit these aesthetic cafes/restaurants/bars for social media doesn't hold true.

1gsigfr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gsigfr,No dairy milks I use at home ,"First off, I think oat milk is one of the best tasting for coffee (specifically Oatly and Oatside), but they both have rapeseed/canola oil which I try to avoid. But I when I'm outside I usually order oat milk for a change. I tried pure oat milks (no added sugar/oil) before but it doesn't taste that good.

I'm slightly lactose intolerant so I prefer non dairy since it's more stomach friendly for me. I mix a bit of creamer (member's selection from s&r) to make soy milk taste a bit better. My daily drink at home is iced latte w/ coconut sugar using clever dripper.

I also uploaded the ingredients of each (scroll through the photos).

Vitasoy (original). 100pesos/liter. I use this the most, because it has better ingredients (which means least amount of ingredients). It has a more soy taste so it can be an acquired taste for some. Price is just right.

Soyfresh. 70pesos/liter (usually on sale at s&r for 299/4 boxes). I think Zus uses this. It's the cheapest but it has more ingredients (corn oil, maltodextrin). It goes better with coffee compared to Vitasoy, but it has a bit of artificial taste. I still buy this just to change things sometimes.

Freenow Coconut Milk. 179/liter. I think Cotti Coffee uses this. I believe this is the same/globalized ""Fino"" brand that is very popular in China. This is my favorite in terms of taste, I even like it better than Oat milk, however it has a lot of ingredients (I'm not sure if it's better or worse than oat). I still buy this sometimes cos I really like the taste and to change things a bit. It has a neutral taste with a bit of saltiness, and just a hint of coconut (doesn't taste like VCO).",3,1731743307.0,CoffeePH,0,1.0,False

Long-time lurker, first-time poster here. I've seen a lot of buzz about the Moses Wealth Code lately (yeah, I was skeptical AF too), but after falling down a YouTube rabbit hole of reviews, I decided to be the guinea pig and try it for 30 days straight. Figured I'd share my experience since I wish I'd found a post like this when I was researching.

**Quick Background:**

* Always been that person who stress-sweats checking their bank account
* Passed up multiple investment opportunities because of anxiety
* Was living in permanent ""I'll start investing when I have more money"" mode
* Basically, a financial mess with a decent income

**What Actually Is This Thing?** It's a 7-minute daily audio program that supposedly uses some specific frequency to rewire your brain's filtering system (RAS - Reticular Activating System). Sounds woo-woo, I know. I rolled my eyes too.

**The Weird Shit That Happened:**

*Week 1:*

* Nothing dramatic, but started noticing investment opportunities I'd usually scroll past
* Caught myself actually reading finance news instead of avoiding it
* Sleep improved (probably from less money anxiety)

*Week 2:*

* Found a side gig opportunity through a random conversation (usually I'd be too scared to even ask)
* Actually opened my investment app for the first time in months
* Started questioning my ""poor person"" mindset

*Week 3:*

* Made my first non-panic investment decision
* Negotiated a better rate with a client (I NEVER do this)
* Started seeing money differently - less emotional about it

*Week 4:*

* Landed two new clients (because I actually pursued leads instead of doubting myself)
* Set up my first proper emergency fund
* Stopped doing the ostrich thing with my finances

**The Good Shit:**

* Only takes 7 minutes (I did it during morning coffee)
* Actually noticed changes in how I think about money
* Comes with a 365-day guarantee (this is why I tried it)
* Science behind it is interesting (if you're into neuroscience)
* Support team actually responds (tested this)

**The Not-So-Good Shit:**

* Takes consistent practice (missed 2 days, felt the difference)
* Nothing happens if you just listen and don't take action
* Initial skepticism is hard to get over
* Some of the marketing is a bit cringe

**Who This Isn't For:**

* People expecting to magically get rich
* Those who can't commit to 7 mins daily
* Anyone looking for get-rich-quick schemes

**Bottom Line:** Is it revolutionary? No. But it helped me unfuck my relationship with money. Worth the investment just for the mindset shift.

1gsi8e7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gsi8e7,Best Social Links In My Opinion ,"So not too long ago, I stated what I felt are the most underrated Social Links in P5R.

But I also might as well talk about my personal favorite Social Links in the game. I know this is all subjective so you don't have to agree with me on these Links.

I'm planning on/have already done posts dedicated to these characters so I'm not gonna go TOO in depth on them.

With that out of the way, lets begin!

No Good Tora: [Toranosuke Yoshida]
You guys already know how I feel about Yoshida as a character and as a SL. I do plan on talking about it all in a future post but this is my favorite Social Link in the game.

And I think the reason for that is just how relatable his situation is. A man that's done wrong that wants to rewrite his reputation after going through the trials and tribulations of life. Who wouldn't relate to wanting to fix your mistakes?

His benefits are really good too but I think his story does the heavy lifting. I really love it with my favorite rank up being the final one.

The only thing I can say now is that I hope he's won an election...

The Secrets Of The Yakuza: [Munehisa Iwai]
I think I've stated this in a past post, but I really love story. If the story is good, it can make anything extremely effective and that's no exception here.

Iwai's a very intimidating person at first glance. We don't know what he's done when we're initially introduced to him but we know that there's secrets there. 

Once we get to know him better, we find out that he was at one point apart of The Yakuza. But we also find out later on that he left that life to raise his adopted son, Karou.

Like Tora, I do plan on doing a post dedicated to Iwai's Social Link. And yes, while his benefits aren't the best in my opinion, his story more than makes up for it and it's actually really sweet.

Deep down, Iwai's a damn good dude...

The Troubled King: [Shinya Oda]
Shinya is a very interesting character who has great benefits as you go through his SL. 

But beyond his benefits, it actually is a very sweet story. A kid that just wants to talk to someone because he can't talk to his mother at home.

I do like the big brother/little brother dynamic between him and Ren. It's very nice to see and very heartwarming as you go through his SL.

Again, his benefits are amazing, especially for the later half of the game. But it's also a really good story as well. I think people look at his benefits more than his story but I think both of them are just as good.

Also...Gun About sounds like so much fun!

Strengthening Ones Heart: [Ann Takamaki]
Yes I know I'm biased 😂...

But beyond the fact that for me, I do prefer Ren with Ann, Ann has a really overlooked SL.

I've heard people talk about how all over the place it is but I honestly think it works. 

Ann's sole motivation is to get stronger for not only Shiho but for herself as well.

And Mika is the perfect foil for her.

I don't hear Mika mentioned enough and that's kind of sad because if you really look at her character, it's kind of tragic. Yes she is a jerk towards Ann but the reason that she is has everything to do with the fact that she's jealous of Ann.

She's had to work for everything while Ann not only had connections but she has natural beauty.

But Ann's a tragic character herself...

Now I do want to do a post about Ann's SL but if I had to choose my favorite rank up it would either have to be the one with Ren, Ann and Ryuji where Ryuji unapologetically rejects a date with Ann in hilarious fashion or the Romance rank up where we get this really nice scene between Ann and Shiho before Shiho moves away.

Outside of my biasness, I really do love this SL.

The Coffee and Curry Family Man: [Sojiro Sakura]
I love Sojiro.  He's definitely one of my favorite characters and he does have my favorite dynamic in the game between him and Ren. 

Sojiro starts off as well...an asshole towards Ren there's no other way to put it 😂

But as you connect with him further, he starts softening up to Ren. Now for me at least, the story really doesn't start getting interesting until Futaba comes into the fold. 

That's where the story really picks up steam but that doesn't necessarily mean that the SL was bad at any point because it wasn't. 

Every rank up before was used to foreshadow Futaba's arrival and it really works.

Plus his benefits are fantastic! 

SP is very important but I don't think I have to tell anybody that. But it's especially important when you want to go through a Palace in a day. So stocking up on Coffee and Curry is essential for that to happen.

Other than the fact that I love his story, his benefits are another major reason why doing this SL is so worth it. 

Plus who doesn't wanna hear ""Ah you're back!"" every time you show back up to Leblanc!?

List Of Redemption: [Futaba Sakura]
Well we talked about one Sakura so we might as well talk about the other!

Just like Sojiro, Futaba's benefits are fantastic! 

But her story is just as good. 

Futaba cared deeply about her mother. And one thing that they used to do was her mother would create a list with Futaba and Futaba would do those things on that list for little rewards after completing each promise.

I like this story because it really shows the development of Futaba as a character. She initially started out as a shut-in who was terrified of the real world. 

Through time, she got more used to the real world but she feels like she needs to truly redeem herself so that's where the list comes along.

The dynamic between Ren and Futaba is very sweet and I do like all of these rank ups because by extension, we were getting more about Futaba herself. 

Plus those benefits man!

The Starving Artist: [Yusuke Kitagawa]
I know people are fairly split on this SL, or so I've been told people are split on this SL. 

But I love it personally. 

It is by far the funniest SL in the entire game. Every scene with Yusuke and Ren is absolute gold. My favorite being the church rank up for obvious reasons. 

But there's another reason why I really love this story...

Madarame.

And no I'm not talking about him as a person. Madarame is a scumbag. But I'm talking about the connection back to him. 

I love the fact that we start learning more about him. And while yes, he stole from Yusuke and pretty much caused him to look at art in a completely different way now, maybe just maybe...Madarame did in fact care about Yusuke at one point and that question is really first posed in the final rank up. 

I do want to talk about this SL as well but just know, I absolutely love it. I think it's fantastic. 

The ""Friendly"" Detective Of Justice: [Goro Akechi]
I know this is a basic choice but I love the dynamic between Ren and Akechi.

Before everything happens, their dynamic is very interesting. You can tell that there's tension there, but I don't think either of them care. 

It becomes very apparent that they're more then just rivals. In a strange sense, they are friends. I do think Akechi meant what he said in the 8th rank up but at the same time I don't.

I want to do a post about these two, but I will say this: They remind me a lot of Batman and Joker which is ironic considering the fact that Akechi is Joker in this situation.

But if I had to choose my favorite rank up, it would probably be the one where Akechi takes Ren to the Jazz Club. I love ""No More What Ifs"" and it actually has a whole lot more meaning to Akechi then he lets on.

Overall, I love this SL. I know he was different in the original version of P5 but I love what they've done with his character in P5R.

That's it everyone! 

There's plenty more that I could have mentioned but I want to know what your favorite Social Links are!",3,1731742339.0,Persona5,3,1.0,False

So I've recently seen this girl a couple times that I met through Hinge a couple of weeks back. We met late because she works in theatre and doesn't finish until 10.30pm.

We had can amazing first date, stayed out until 2am, made out a lot etc She texted later to say thanks and said she wanted to see me the week after.

I called a day later and arranged a date for following week. We went to an art gallery and a lovely walk and had some coffee before I dropped her off at work. Again, lots of making out, loads of laughing, great convo, touching and hand holding- it just felt really natural and she is a very passionate kisser tbh.

I knew vaguely that she we was gonna be super busy before she goes home for the holidays etc. But when I dropped her off and I asked 'when am I seeing you next week?' she said that it can't be until january when she is back in town. But she said I can call her anytime and that she wants to hear how my job interview goes next week.

Now of course, this was a little disconcerting I suppose, because it is a little hard to believe that anyone is that busy for the next month and a half, especially considering how natural and affectionate the dates seemed. I have dated a lot of women this year, and I can tell there is a really high attraction level between us, nothing imo that would suggest otherwise.

I know I am probs overthinking this, but do you think she is actually really that busy? Or is she just making distance? Who knows?

Thoughts?

My wife and I really slept on getting some posts together before we were supposed to be out of our St Johns rental, but here we are!

We're downsizing and have some furniture that needs to go! If anyone is interested in what we got, priority will be given to folks taking multiple items. 

Pickup is gonna be only on Saturday, Nov 16. BYO your own vehicle - I can help ya load it into your vehicle!

My partner and I will be packing and cleaning all day so we've got good availability, lol.

Pics will be left in comments since Reddit is being weird about me uploading pics with this post!

Anyhoo, here's what we got:

- big ol' kitchen island with a lil cutout for a stool. Double sided! I can disassemble it a bit for easier loading. Measurements are about 71"" x 24"" x 42"" tall. Pretty neat! Comes with the white stool seen in the pics.

- black metal queen sized platform bed frame. Zinus? Real sturdy! I believe it's 18"" tall.

- coffee table that raises up! The top is laminate and pretty rough - covered with cheap contact paper currently but it likely isn't that durable.

- computer gaming chair. Real comfy! Only a lil squeaky. Comes with rollerblade wheels as well. Has a cool seat cover that's been on since I got it about a year ago.

- boot bench with hanger things! This is sweet and I'm sad it won't fit in our new place.

- lawnmower, the push kind! Like Pete n Pete. Screw electricity and gas. Works decently!

- indoor outdoor galvinized metal shelf - it's from IKEA and it's tall and weird! Perfect for lil plants to hang out.

- white tall shelf thing, also from IKEA but made of particle board or whatever. We used it as a bench that held records and I gotta say it was pretty sweet.

- mint green little cart shelf thing - great for crafts! Lid is a little borked but also not necessary. I think the blue tape peels off the finish, lol.

- leaf blower (not pictured) - electric, plug in, Pittsburg brand, green in color, really blows lol

- a plastic leaf rake and a metal uhh...other kind of rake (not pictured)

Lemme know if you're interested and what you're interested in via the comments and, if the stars align for us, I'll message y'all so we can arrange pickup (St Johns neighborhood).

Thanks for looking :)

EDIT: okay I can't seem to add pics to comments right now either - must be something weird with my app. Will update from my computer in a bit! Stay tuned for pics.",3,1731742063.0,PDXBuyNothing,4,1.0,False

1gshzuz,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1gshzuz/transform_your_home_with_statement_lighting_a/,Transform Your Home with Statement Lighting: A Guide to Choosing the Perfect Fixtures,"Lighting is more than just a functional necessity—it's an art form that can redefine the atmosphere of your space. Statement lighting fixtures are the ultimate tools to add character and depth, creating focal points that draw the eye and enhance your interior design. In this guide, we’ll walk you through how to choose the perfect statement lighting for your home, with tips on integrating them with your decor elements like [carpets and rugs](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/textiles/rugs), [room carpet](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/textiles/rugs), and even a cozy [pouf](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/textiles/poufs).

**1. Understand the Role of Statement Lighting**

Statement lighting serves as a visual anchor in your home. Whether it’s a grand chandelier, an intricate pendant light, or a modern sculptural fixture, the goal is to captivate attention and set the mood. 

For example, pairing a bold light fixture with a vibrant room carpet or textured carpets and rugs can create a harmonious blend of style and function. The interplay of light and texture brings out the best in both elements.

**2. Match Lighting Style to Your Space**

The key to selecting the perfect fixture is ensuring it complements your home’s aesthetic. Here are some ideas:

Bohemian Chic: Opt for woven pendant lights or rattan fixtures. These pair beautifully with layered carpets and rugs for a cozy and artistic vibe.

Modern Minimalist: Go for geometric or metallic designs that contrast with a sleek room carpet in neutral tones.

Rustic Charm: A vintage chandelier or lantern works wonders when paired with a plush pouf for an inviting corner.

**3. Consider the Scale and Placement**

When choosing a statement light, size matters. A fixture that’s too small may go unnoticed, while one that’s too large can overwhelm the space. Here’s how to balance it:

Living Room: A dramatic chandelier over a coffee table can complement a large room carpet to define the seating area.

Dining Room: A cluster of pendant lights above the dining table adds charm. Ensure the lighting highlights your furniture while blending with any carpets and rugs nearby.

Bedroom: A soft, sculptural bedside lamp paired with a stylish pouf creates a cozy reading nook.

**4. Leverage Light to Highlight Textures**

The beauty of statement lighting lies in its ability to bring out textures in your decor. Use directional lighting to highlight the intricate patterns of carpets and rugs, or cast a warm glow over a soft pouf to create a serene ambiance.

**5. Layer Lighting for Functionality**

Combine statement fixtures with ambient, task, and accent lighting for a well-rounded design. For instance:

Use a pendant light as a centerpiece while incorporating floor lamps that accentuate a bold room carpet.

Add LED strip lighting to emphasize layered carpets and rugs, giving them a subtle, illuminated effect.

**6. Experiment with Color and Materials**

Statement lighting is an opportunity to play with color and material contrasts. A gold or brass fixture can pop against the earthy tones of a jute room carpet, while glass or crystal elements can add sophistication to bohemian or eclectic setups featuring a pouf.

**7. Why Statement Lighting is Worth the Investment**

Statement lighting not only enhances the aesthetic appeal of your home but also elevates the functionality of your spaces. When combined thoughtfully with complementary decor like carpets and rugs, it transforms your interiors into a cohesive masterpiece.

**Final Thoughts**

Choosing the perfect statement lighting is about striking a balance between form and function. Whether you’re redefining your living room with a grand chandelier, adding warmth to your dining space with pendant lights, or creating a cozy nook with a sculptural lamp and a pouf, the right lighting can transform your home into a haven of style and comfort. Don’t forget to consider how your lighting fixtures interact with textures and elements like room carpets to create a truly cohesive and inviting space.

1gshzk1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gshzk1/aita_for_making_sure_i_take_up_space_and_make_my/,AITA for making sure I take up space and make my presence known in my shared dorm ,"Pretty long thread. If any of the participants see these, oh well.  I (F19) am rooming with three other girls S (F19), K (F18), and A (F18). Me and S are both sophomores and the other two are freshmen. I work with housing and am an RA, so I didn’t have a say in who I lived with which I was okay with.

Before we met, I created a group chat and we basically all agreed we weren’t really gonna decorate the dorm. I was fine with living without any extra things. It didn’t matter to me how the dorm looked or whatever I just lived there.

On the other hand, S did care a bit more and decided to rearrange things the way she liked, adding a carpet and a painting and moving some of the kitchen appliances in a neat way. I did not have a problem with that until she started changing my things that I had brought from moving in first.

It started off small like she said the bathmat I bought got wet too easily and changed it with her green one. Then the cute floral shower curtain I had was replaced with her own. Then the trashcan I bought for the bathroom was also replaced by a different trashcan.

I didn’t say a single thing, but it didn’t end there.

S likes to move things away that aren’t aesthetic enough to her taste. I usually use a water kettle and there are only two plugs one for the microwave and the other she has plugged into her coffee maker which she doesn’t always use. Sometimes I’ll have my water kettle plugged in, and by morning it is underneath the sink. My other roommates toaster also succumbed to that fate, but she wasn’t bothered by it.

Also, I have a jar of honey and soy sauce I like to keep on the dinner table. I kept it next to her salt and pepper shaker, and shocker, it’s not on the table anymore it’s in my cabinet. This happened multiple times before I just gave up. I also had two little toys I had on the dinner table for decoration but those also found themselves in a drawer which I wasn’t too sad about but still bothered me.

All of these things I was okay with dealing with. I don’t care how my dorm looks. It's just a dorm, but then she began to complain about me.

She told me that she hates that I shed. Which I do too. So I spent extra time cleaning my hair from spaces when I see it. She doesn’t like when there is food in the sink which is also valid, so I make sure when I cook I don’t ever let there be any food in the filter. I wipe down every surface before I’m done. I overheard her complain about the rim of the sink always being wet, so I started drying it when I used it.

All of these things were reasonable in theory, but somehow only I seemed to be the one creating these issues even when K or A were the ones to do it. She never ever brought up anything anyone else did like how A would leave rotted food in the fridge or how people slammed the doors or how no one else did their part of the cleaning.

It truly felt like she was trying to get rid of any trace of my existence.

And it especially became worse when she started targeting my job and trying to get me fired.

The first incident was a small thing. For my job, we had to have discussions with our roommates about the way we would live together. I didn’t have the contract on hand so we all agreed to discuss the questions and I would write down the answers on my phone. After I got the paper, I asked everyone to sign it so I could rewrite our conversation notes down and I could turn it in. S says she doesn’t feel comfortable doing this, maybe because she felt like I would alter the answers, and so I write it all down and then ask everyone to sign and tell them to let me know if they change anything. She then proceeds to alter an answer and not tell me which I bring up by text.

The next time I have a meeting with my boss, this incident is brought up, and I am confused because there is no way she would know unless S tattled on me or her boyfriend who is a coworker did. My boss is understanding and tells me to not do it next time.

The second incident was when the upstairs neighbors were being loud. S told me they were moving furniture after quiet hours, so I went upstairs and told them to quiet down. The one at the door explained to me that her roommate was just fixing her bed after they had made a bed fort. I say okay and to quiet down then I explain that to S, and then I write a noise complaint report.

Not even ten minutes later, she storms out of the dorm and gets her boyfriend to tell them to quiet down and he threatens to have them written up for alcohol because he claims he heard bottles even though he lives with people who consistently drink. Also, this wasn't the first time he had yelled at residents (we live in a freshmen only dorm) and had yelled at residents once to 'shut the hell up'. 

There are so many violations I could bring up about her boyfriend too, but I'm not going to bring those up. But I will say, that I have never snitched on him like she has about me.

The last time was the final straw.

At this point, I know she hates my guts. She is openly dismissive of my attempts at greeting her. She ignored me in public when I said hi to her, literally snatching her food and running away. And I’ve heard her openly badmouthing me to the other roommates. Also, I know she is applying for the RA position, and it's obvious she thinks she would be the better RA at this point. 

Unrelated, but I overheard her say that she would use her boyfriend's twin, also an RA, to interview with and get a guaranteed job position.

The ultimate final straw was that she also hates the fact that I get her bathmat wet.

It’s been a regular issue for me for some reason, but I know my other roommate A has had this issue at least once before because I've seen the bathmat hanging.

I’ve spent an extra 5-10 minutes every shower making sure the curtain is shut correctly or the tilt of the shower head isn’t facing the curtain or the magnets are stuck in place. Or I would spend that time cleaning up the bathroom floor and soaking up the water with my own towel before stepping out.

In the latter circumstances, I would hang her bathmat to dry then go about my day.

She’s brought up the bath mat situation three times, and each time I tell her that I am actively trying not to get it wet. 

I hadn’t for a while until recently when I got it wet again.

When she brings this up, I’m rolling my eyes at this point because what else can I do? I won’t lie. I was passive aggressive in the way I told her that I can’t do anything about it at this point and that I don't always have the energy to be hypervigilant about water getting out all the time. While she feigns innocence by saying she cares about mold in the dorm which I say won't happen because I have to check for it in my job. And she is livid.

The next time I’m at work, she’s there with my boss because we’re now having a surprise mediation. She brings up the bath mat situation and already I’m done with it. She talks about how she deep cleaned the dorm yesterday and how I’m not helping as much but doesn’t bring up that the other two roommates don’t even clean at all.

She brings up how I sounded rude to her through text and then brings up that she is ‘only concerned about the bathroom growing mold’ and brings up that under my shampoo bottles there was mold. I later checked with maintenance and they said it was just mildew. Then, to top it all off, she asks if I am ‘mentally okay’.

I do all my dishes. I sweep all my hair. I clean the kitchen countertops. I never leave trash anywhere. I take out the trash. If you stepped into the dorm, it would look like nobody lived there at first. It. Was. Not. Enough.

We finish the mediation, and we come to the conclusion that we will use a cleaning schedule from now on, and I suggested I use my own bathmat from here out.

Having been stressed out from other things, I end up crying in front of my boss after S leaves and pretty much solidify my 'mentally unwell' state in her mind.

I am looking depressed, scrolling online for a whiteboard for the cleaning schedule, when an idea comes to me. Everyday, my existence is slowly being erased by her perfectionist idea of a dorm, why not take up more space?

So I blast my wallet into pieces and spend $250 on dorm decorations. A welcome mat, table cloth, shower caddy, cute hand towels, couch covers and pillows. And I chose designs that did not match her aesthetic at all. They were all cutesy concepts, nothing minimalistic.

I plan to switch out my shower curtain as well and maybe even bring my mini trashcan back.

Now, I am waiting for them all to come, but I still can’t help but think am I actually the delusional one? Am I actually an uncleanly roommate who is just bad at her job? I've lived with people before and they never brought up any of the issues S has brought.

So reddit, really just let me have it. Am I the asshole for going through with this plan of taking up space and living the way I do?

1gshzhu,https://www.reddit.com/r/boywithuke/comments/1gshzhu/dumping_likescriticisms_about_burnout/,dumping likes/criticisms about Burnout,"this album has a lot of amazing things about it and i was so surprised by every song, but there’s also some things that i thought were a little odd and i would like to point out both the good and bad.

amazing things about new individual songs:
1. I love the yell of “I won’t let it BURNOUT!” and the reverb in Burn sounds really cool. i like how it’s fast paced too, and it sounds atmospheric.

2. Stranger sounds amazing. I love how there’s so much going on. this one really exceeded my expectations. it sounds really full and with high energy. one of my favorites on the album.

3. I love the switch up in Coffee so much. the last minute of the song is my favorite. some people might think it’s random, but it adds a lot in my opinion. the melody is catchy.

4. Paper Planes sounds exhilarating. my favorite part is when it goes to that lovely and wonderful ukulele part then has that scream. 

5. Petrichor is really calming. it has a mood to it that i really admire. 

6. the synths in Pitfall are AMAZING. it really adds so much. i like how it has a lot going on.

7. CORDUROY. I LOVE CORDUROY. I love that the first part of the song builds up to that huge “drop”. and the drop itself is SO GOOD. everything just sounds perfect.

8. Love Lost has a certain vibe to it. for some reason it reminds me of a castle😭 I really like it.

9. I really like Easier. the acoustic guitar at the beginning sounds nice and calm. I also love the electric guitar riff. it scratches my brain in a good way. 

10. Change is just a chill song, which I enjoy. it’s nice.


criticisms/things i sorta disliked:
1. Backseat sounds empty. i feel like the first section is supposed to be intense, but it’s missing that. the first part had a lot of potential. the second part is good, except i don’t like the little voice that yells, “love!” that much. it sounds odd to me. 

2. the verses in Coffee don’t sound the best. it’s not really singing, it’s just speaking, and with the repeating instrumental, there’s not a lot that’s interesting about the song except for the last minute of it.

3. don’t get me wrong, I love Paper Planes. it’s one of my favorites, but the lyric “okay, I can get a little violent” sounds a little cringe imo. I love the rest of the song though.

4. the transition between Petrichor and Pitfall bothers me. it goes from a quiet, chill song, to a loud guitar without any warning, and it sounds like it starts in the middle of something.  it doesn’t sound like it has a set beginning, which makes me dislike the transition. especially since interludes are supposed to connect two songs in the album.

5. as much as I love Corduroy, it has its flaws. some of the ways the lines are sung sound off. specifically, “I like to-rewatch movies” and “my fingers touch the…fabric of my…jacket made of…corduroy, reminding me of…brentwood”. the first line sounds like it randomly speeds up at “to rewatch movies” and it just doesn’t sound right. the second line has these pauses in between the words, which feel out of place.

6. this is very broad, but i feel like most of the vocals in this album sound kind of odd. i’ve seen people talk about it so I know it isn’t just me.


I apologize if this sounds harsh, I just want to give all my thoughts about the album and my first impression of it. most of these i’ll probably get used to, but i want to point them out anyway. I don’t hate the album at all, I really really love it, but these are just some things I think could be improved.",5,1731741276.0,boywithuke,0,1.0,False

Since this is the G-9 markaz tehzeeb, there are a few tables and chairs outside tehzeeb so the seating was not an issue.

We saw 2 guys leaving the table with some leftover food which was odd as they ordered coffee and ice cream. coffee was half finished while the ice cream had one scoop left. I asked the guys if they were going to come back to sit on the table but they said go ahead as they were leaving. My mind stopped processing for a second but soon i didn't care and set aside their leftovers while me and my cousin ate the panini.

i was wondering what should i do with these leftovers as it would be a waste to keep them like this or throw them away. i hoped that if there is a beggar around here, i could give them these leftovers and well what do you know, a beggar did come and i gave him these leftovers. he was confused at first (probably speechless) but he took the food. 

As we were leaving tehzeeb i saw the same beggar eating the leftovers which we gave. i did the right thing, in my opinion besides that we went home, ate dinner again and i slept 👍",4,1731740433.0,PakistaniiConfessions,12,0.83,False

Normally I have an orange and toast for breakfast, a coffee mid morning, and then pizza for lunch and pizza for dinner, a Sprite or 7Up with each and maybe a candy bar.  Then after 8 or 10 hours of working, I go home next door and right to bed. 

  
Today a few things were different, and after a breakfast of 2 slices of toast, all that was here was a box of thin spaghetti and a jar of spaghetti sauce, and I made that and ate from it a bit here and there all day.  No soda but one candy bar spread out over the last half of day.

  
I'm wondering if my eating might have something to do with it, I am not familiar with the science behind starch, sugar, or whatever else those foods represent, but I thought that maybe people here who are familiar with it can see a reason for my lack of drowsiness...

  
I'm not overflowing with energy, but normally I can just think about sleeping and feel my body shut down.  I don't even pick up and hug then office cat after 2pm else I will be ready to curl up on the couch and fall asleep.

1gshhcp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1gshhcp/i_was_married_for_19_years/,I was Married for 19 years,"I was married for a long time, but in the end I lost my best friend, my wife, my home, and my family. Believe it or not, I asked her to get married after we dated one month, and three months in we tied the knot. We were both 26 at the time.

Many years later, we had children. A daughter and then twin boys. Life was busy but it was good. I was never the type who went out golfing or sat around watching sports. I came home every day after work.

She always had a few issues, trust, anxiety, sometimes depression. She needed anger management and had a pretty bad controlling behavior. She smoked pot a few times here and there, then it became a daily habit, then it was an all day every day kind of habit. I let it slide. 

We both made good money. About 190k a year together. However she had a horrible spending habit and Amazon made it worse. She would buy things to feel better. She would medicate herself with pot to calm her moods..

I had to pull money out of my retirement 3 times.. rough total of 175k to pay off all these credit cards she had. (No she wasn’t smoking crack) Some of the debts were for vacations we had to have to make her happy.

Our home was once paid off. Then we accumulated 195k home equity. She insisted on managing the bills just so we are clear here…

I was told to stop buying myself a morning coffee because we couldn’t afford it anymore. This was my one thing to look forward to on my way to work. Last thanksgiving I was wondering why she was taking so long to pick up a pie. Decided to see where she was on the find iPhone. Located her at the dispensary. I called her and she denied she was there. I found out later she was spending on average $400 a week on THC vapes. This was going on for several years.

We didn’t speak for almost a month. She was coming home many hours late from work. Claimed she was going to therapy, some of that I found out later was true.. and finally one night she told me she was going through menopause. So we slept in bed that night together after a month of not speaking. How relieved I felt! The next day was Friday. I was so happy texting her while we were both at work. By 1:30pm I got delivered a divorce summons still at work. 

I was traumatized so much they insisted I take an ambulance to the hospital. I didn’t argue and just cooperated. I made sure they ran my blood to prove I was under no drugs or alcohol, as I didn’t use those. 9 hours later they let me go. ($250 bill for that too!!)

Went to court on Monday, she put a restraining order on me but still wanted to hang out for the day after. Acted like we were getting back together! I have never played a hand on her in any of the 19 years!! She knew how to play the victim though. 

I was allowed to see my kids open their Christmas presents on FaceTime while I sat in my car outside in the driveway. She then came out to sit and chat with me for hours. Christmas was our anniversary.. While we spoke she kept looking beyond me, startled in a way.. I had to look each time but nothing was there. She said she seen shadows? She said our marriage was a lie. She had a hard time believing what was real and what was her imagination. That’s when it hit me hard. She had lost her mind. This hurt me deeply to see what was happening to her. It was as if I no longer recognized this person at all anymore.

Time went on and she battled for everything. I just wanted my belongings but they went “missing or never seen it before”

The divorce ended in September. Almost a year later. Both of us spending almost 20k each on a lawyer. Money we didn’t have…

My son said to me, Dad it’s finally over so you can come back and live with me again. 

Divorce is not funny, it’s nothing happy, it’s nothing good!! 

I’ve learned to move on through the day by day, and all night long, rollercoaster. But even when the smoke clears, the ashes are always left behind.

I hope none of you have to go through the carpet pull of a divorce that was planned, coordinated, and manipulated as I did.

1gshfcq,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1gshfcq/my_bf_cheated_and_now_asking_to_be_in_an_open/,My bf cheated and now asking to be in an open relationship ,"My partner (27m) cheated on me (28f) with his ex (30 something f). We have a beautiful sweet happy 6 month daughter. He cheated on me last Saturday, they've been talking since the ending of last month. On Wednesday morning he told me he wanted to open the relationship and that he had someone in mind. He didn't want to admit it was his ex, but eventually did. I had already knew of the affair as i saw the text messages Wednesday early morning, I read the messages of the night they snuck around behind his work trash bins in her car. They caught up, hugged and kissed. His ex mentioned opening up her relationship with her partner so they wouldnt have to feel guilty about what they were doing. In which my partner said he was gonna talk to me about it but was scared too. I just didnt expect it to be the day i found out of his cheating. He ofc didn't know that I knew. He wanted to play it off as something he thought of on his own. I was so stunned by everything I already knew and what he was throwing at me so i went along with it cause i didnt know how to process it. I have a habit of just agreeing to whatever for him, to make him happy. Plus, i was in the middle of processing the affair. Now this. I hadnt slept and then had to care for a infant. So you can imagine the little brain power and engery i had. Later on i admitted to knowing about the affair once i had awaken from drowning a cup of coffee. We got into a massive fight. We got into the fight of having our daughter. She was an accidentally pregnancy. I explained that I loved him and it was an accident. I was terrified of being pregnant. I kept the pregnancy because of trauma with having a ectopic pregnancy years ago. None the less we love our daughter, he just loves his ex more than us, I guess. That's how it feels like anyways. I took accountability for my mistake and dont regret her. I now just regret the father she's stuck with. Which really sucks because hes a great dad to her. I dont want to regret sharing a child together. Durring this argument i realized that my partner wasn't gonna take accountability for his choices, all he kept saying was ""sorry i don't show my feelings, but I do feel guilty for cheating."" I know he's not one to be super emotional. But his actions says everything i need to know. Like they say: actions speak louder than words. Or he blamed his upbringing and everyone else for how he is. He knows i love him. He knows he can take advantage of me because I always break my limbs bending for him. I had forgave him for his shit with his ex because his ex was abusive. Ive been abused. I know how manipulative they can be. How they trick you into taking them back. How convince you they've  changed. It was something even his therapist was working with him on- she likes the attention and doesnt want him to move on. This is all a manipulative game for her. 
Anyway, my partner took advantage of my empathy. Now I no longer see him as a victim. I see him as an abuser and i wonder if his ex was ever abusive or if it was something he just said for sympathy points. Who knows. They're both shitty people (she knew of our status and knew we just had a baby). I ended up passing out in the middle of our argument due to lack of sleep. On Thursday morning with a more clear mind I texted him telling him to leave me alone atm as I couldn't face him. He claimed he would respect that. But since then he has been blowing up my phone. Today he has called me 13 times and left me multiple messages. In the messages he claimed to love me, that our daughter, me and our relationship is his priority. He wants to make me happy. That I'm the healthiest relationship he's ever had and that he still wants to continue our relationship. How him and his ex and her partner are discussing boundaries and comfortability going into this open relationship and for me to be understanding that him and i are the primary couple that he's building a future with. Blah, blah blah. The anger I feel reading him claim to prioritize us when he was the one destroying our family. I called his mom this morning and cried to her about everything. She's been supportive and understands what I'm going through. She was cheated on and beat by my partner bio dad. She had to run away from him. Anway, She's disappointed with her son and is annoyed at his ex. Kind of makes me happy to know she loathes her. seems like she doesnt want us to break up but is also supporting me if I do. I honestly don't know how I'm going to confront him. To be completely honest- if he had came to me wanting to discuss having a open relationship before he started talking to her i probably would be more on board. It's the fact he went ahead and cheated, then demanded a open relationship. I probably wouldn't participated in dating other people but at least I would've known it started in a healthy matter. I just think I can't look past the cheating. My daughter and I deserve better. I'm leaning more to ending things with him but it's so hard because I love him so much. I just know this open relationship idea isn't gonna end well for him. Or at least im hopefully it doednt. He wants to take me on a date tomorrow. I'm thinking of just hiding out somewhere else cause I'm too much *ussy to confront him right now. If I end up growing a back bone wish me luck on doing the right thing.

1gshbn8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1gshbn8/was_it_a_mistake_breakingup/,Was it a mistake breaking-up?,"7 months ago, I (28M) broke up with my first girlfriend (26F) after a year and 3 months together and I’m still unsure if I made the right decision.

My reasons at the time were that I didn’t feel at ease together or that we were a good fit for each other. We were very physical and serious, but we weren’t great friends, didn’t naturally click and had different senses of humour that weren’t able to balance our intensity out, nor did we have deep conversations. I couldn’t read her emotions easily and she got disproportionality angry over small things I did/didn’t do (even though she always apologised later) and so I felt anxious about doing enough and being attentive to her when we were together. All of these things added up so that I felt drained and sometimes like I was on eggshells around her. It was just a lot of hard work and didn’t come easily. Our texting felt amazing and easy, but in person it was harder.

Despite this, in hindsight I feel like I threw away something incredible. Everything that really matters was there — she loved me unconditionally, we fought really well, we always respected each other, shared in each other’s interests, had the same values/goals in life and she was just an incredible, patient, creative woman, the most attractive I’ve EVER known. I wonder if I didn’t give us enough time to build a strong foundation and maybe we could have made it if we communicated better and worked on our issues together, and if we put more effort into emotional and other forms of non-sexual intimacy.

Instead, for the last 3 months of the relationship I told her I was struggling with feeling exhausted together, but it was hard to articulate clearly why at the time. When we broke up I really thought the decision through and tried to be as kind, honest and clear as I could, but I regret I didn’t try harder to work things out together before giving up (and internally I had no idea if it was the right decision but I couldn’t hold on to her while I was feeling so unsure). She held on to hope until the bitter end, at which point I was so focused on me I forgot about the ‘we’. She had her own reasons as to why we weren’t working but didn’t give up on us unlike me. I saw a counsellor twice in the weeks beforehand because I thought something was wrong with me, but they thought the relationship wasn’t right and this is what encouraged me to break-up.

The first five months after the break up we went NC and I was so focused on work, going to the gym and reflecting on how I can be a better partner and where I fell short that I didn’t really process my emotions (plus I was holding on to hope that she would take me back after some time apart to learn and grow). That was until two months ago when I wrote her a heartfelt letter to apologise, explain what I’d learned and ask if she would be open for a coffee just to talk. A week later she posted a story on Instagram saying how good it felt to reject me which hurt me as I had heard nothing back. She eventually texted saying she felt hurt by the way I reached out, that I had my chance with her and she doesn’t want to hear from me again. It crushed me but I understand the hurt I caused, I respect her decision and I tried all I could now so I have to move on. It feels impossible but it’s more important to me that she’s happy, even though I’m really not sure how to stop loving someone so much, I know I have to find a way and try to remember why we broke up in the first place.

Even after 7 months she’s constantly on my mind and I miss her more than I can say. I tear up thinking about the love letters, scrapbook and notes she wrote me. I’m really trying to get out and spend time with friends and family, I even did solo travel for a month overseas, but it’s easier to be at home by myself because when I’m out and doing fun things sometimes I'll cry because they feel empty without her. I’m always scanning the room for her, hoping we’ll run into each other and rekindle. I tried dating but it just makes me miss her more. Maybe I need more time and therapy and to meet the right person, but it’s impossible to shake the feeling we could still be together and worked through our differences if I hadn’t given up.

Through the past two years she has been seen by various doctors, neurologists, endocrinologists, you name it, she may have seen them.

She’s on a gambit of medications (I apologize there are so many I don’t even know half the names or dosages), and receives Botox injections once about every 3-4 months. Those seem to barely help numb the daily pain and does nothing for the ringing/whooshing in her ears. 

Needless to say, she rests a lot, even when she’s tired of resting. She does smoke cigarettes and drinks coffee daily as well, but those would be her only vices. 

Her insurance refuses to cover a double dose/dip of Botox, and while we are trying to get her on the road to some weight loss by eating proper portions per her endocrinologist, nothing seems to be helping. She can’t perform most menial tasks because it always results in dizziness and makes the pain more intense, causing her to sleep due to the intensity. 

She brings all of this up with everyone she visits, but I know she’s depressed. I mean who wouldn’t be, honestly?

My question is: are there routes we can take that maybe we haven’t thought of yet? I know every case is different, I’m well aware not everything will work for her, but I’m at my wit’s end. 

I just want for her to have good days, or have something that can really subside the symptoms. I believe she’s on Ubrelvi (check spelling), and she only uses those for emergent situations. 

So, as her husband for 14 years, and partner for 20, any advice/help/guidance would be welcomed. Thanks in advance everyone. ",2,1731738498.0,iih,1,1.0,False

They open as early as 7 AM—perfect for early risers or anyone craving a hearty breakfast! While their specialty is clearly burgers (as the name suggests), their menu offers a variety of dishes, from pasta to breakfast staples, and even coffee.

On my first visit, I had:

🍔 Signature Prime Burger - Beef patty, caramelized onions, goat cheese

🍔 BBQ Beef Burger - Beef patty, American cheese, crispy beef bacon, house sauce, red marmalade onions (though when we ordered, they didn’t have beef bacon and offered pork bacon instead)

🥔 Chorizo Potato Hash - A delicious side dish that deserves the spotlight!

Each burger comes with its own fries on the side, which is a great touch! However, I think the fries would have been better if they were second-fried or had a bit more color for that extra crispness. As for the burgers, I would’ve liked the beef patties to have a bit more sear and color, and I was hoping for bolder flavors from the caramelized and red marmalade onions.

November 17th, Cycle 214

Fleet of Terran Inheritance

Location: Orbital Docks over Svarog system capital ""Glorious"" Terran class world

Current events: Major Fleet actions between Kardashian defense fleets, League Enforcers and Tri-con hired mercs

*Sirens blare across the shipyard of Orbital Station Saint Michael. Shields flicker back online, blocking part of a missile salvo. Fire fighting drones respond to flame filled damage on dock #3 as dock workers dive for cover at dock #5. An Executor Class Battleship slams into the dock, chunks being flung about as the artificial gravity takes effect. Ramps and doors open on several levels and a tridal wave of activity starts.

Supplies are rushed in as wounded and dead are rushed out. Repair drones and work crews take to repairing the ship quickly. Inside the vessel, Admiral McClain and Vice Admiral Jennings quickly walk down the corridor.*

McClain: 
Well Jennings, you got what you wanted.

Jennings:
You know we wouldn't make core without repairs sir.

McClain: I know I know.

*The pair stop in the med bay. They watch as the chief engineer cusses loudly. A doctor slices off a mangled left arm. The 2 officers barely flinch as they watch a crude cybernetic adapter get sodered onto the stump and a skeletonized cybernetic arm placed on*

Doctor Vickers:
Gary, I must again remind you how dangerous this is, you aren.....

Chief Engineer Gary:
Doc I don't fucking care what the risk is, finish her up so I can get back to engineering!

*Gary Looks up to the 2 officers*

Sir, Ma'am. Just a little issue, no worries. 

*Gary flexes his temporary cybernetic as he stands up, now walking with the officers, leaving the bloody medical bay*

That Onslaught did a number on us but with the station shipyards, we can get her fixed nicely. How's the outside Cap'n?

McClain:
Taking out the queen bitch has the rest of the fleet in disarray. Looks like the league and the mercs hit each other within range of the station. The Eagles and what's left of the escorts has defensive positions, buying us as much time to get repairs. 

*The 3 stop as a drone carries out half of a dead crew mate, McClain briefly crosses himself. He looks to the engineer*

How long do you need?

Gary:
12 hours

McClain: 
Good. Get it done.

*The 2 officers walk out of the ship now. Looking out the environmental shield, they watch the battle unfold. A kite shuttle spirals into the shield, making it shimmer as it crumbles into pieces. The battle lights up the void, the 2 fleets have moved away from the station. McClain and Jennings try to count the number of ships. Roughly 120 still moving...*

McClain:
Looks like the League and tricon hate each other more than us... Jennings, replenish the roster from the station, once the repairs are finished, we are getting into the fight. Intel says the tricon Fleet is at 37% losses. If we can pick off more detachments we can win the fight.

Jennings:
Should we get into that big fight outside? 2 birds one Onslaught opportunity here.

McClain:
No. Hit the smaller fleets. What's left we take out. Mean time, have what crew we can get what rest they can, God knows everyone needs it...

*Jennings pushes McClain onto the group as a laser bolt barely passes by. Gunfire rings out through the dock as station security rip through a pather terrorist. McClain and Jennings stand up*

McClain: 
Didn't give a speech before shooting this time? Maybe they are getting smarter.

Jennings:
That's relative sir, I don't think anyone who claims to be a pather has much intelligence.

McClain:
Fair point. Strap his body to a missile and launch him at the fleet outside.

*McClain places his cap back on and walks to the command deck to observe the fight. Despite his orders, he takes to coffee over sleep. ""Glorious delight"" blend of coffee. He contemplates firing the naming department at the next meeting he attends with the Kardash League Council.*",3,1731737978.0,starsector,0,0.72,False

1gsh48p,https://www.reddit.com/r/DrCreepensVault/comments/1gsh48p/im_not_paid_enough_for_this/,I'm not paid enough for this,"ent lights buzzed overhead as I plopped my purse on my desk. The smell of dust and stale coffee permeated the air as a stale box of donuts lay on the desk beside me, attracting flies. The suns last rays set in the horizon, making the changing leaves glow. I longed to take a walk outside and breath the cool crisp air, but it would be dark soon and I had to clock in.  

“Do you have any plans for Halloween,” said Rob, my coworker. “We’re taking the kids out to trunk or treat out at our church meet up on Sunday.”

I put my head down and rolled my eyes. “Samhain, I celebrate Samhain, and I’ve taken off the last week of October,” I said under my breath. I was stuck in this dreary office and time couldn't pass fast enough, and here was Mr. Family man asking me to cover for him.

“What?”

“I’m taking off next week, I have other plans,” I said.

“So you can’t cover my shift on Sunday? The kids were looking forward to trunk or treat.”

“Ask Dave, he practically lives here, he’ll take your shift if he hasn’t already.”  

“I would but Dave is out for the weekend.”

""Rob, I've already picked up a shift for you last week, please check the schedule for someone else, this holiday is important to me.""  My hands curled into fists and I gritted my teeth, the nerve of some coworkers.

The loading ticker showed on my desk, taking a full five minutes to log in. 

:Ericka! It’s great to see you. Got anything planned, bestie?:

I smiled at Angie’s message, ah at least some conversation to break up the monotony of my shift tonight.

:Yeah, I’m going to hang out with some friends, did you want to come out with us?:

:I wish I could , but I’m working overtime tomorrow, then I have to pack up.:

:Well, I hope you have fun.:

:I will.:

Sometimes I wish I had more time in the day. Angie and I would spend time in between calls and projects to joke or complain about the system crashing. However , working on night shift crushed most plans for hanging out. Nothing was open after we got off work except for the emergency room and truck stops. I also commuted forty minutes to work and back and ended up staying home on my days off. Perhaps when I got back from vacation I’d make more time to spend with them, attend group functions. Who am I kidding? Then I’d have to spend time with Rob and his family as well, yikes. No, when I returned I would treat Angie out for coffee, just hang out at Starbucks down the road. Anything to break the monotony.

I sighed and went back to reading my email. Kale666@gmail, jumped out in red letters. It was obvious spam, but they weren’t wrong, kale is the devil. 

As soon as i clicked delete the screen tuned a sickly yellow hue and the letters turned blood red. The words became mangled and began to melt down the screen.

I swore under my breath, there was a virus embedded into this demonic salad. Now I had to call IT, all to have some condescending jaskass mansplain to me about clicking outside emails or remote into my sytem. Right when I was about to dial the overhead lights dimmed before winking out into darkness, along with my phone and computer.

A flashlight glowed as a few security guards came to check out the breaker room. 

“We’ll get the generator back up in no time, you guys sit tight, ” said Ralph.  The kindly old man was the the head security guard. With him stood Jarvis, a laid back security guard that held the flashlight.

Another loud hum and the generator kicked up, shoving a plume of dark smoke into the air. 

“We're having an electrical outage. I’m going to need y’all to move to building two,"" said Ralph.

I sighed, very well, I would pack my stuff and play musical cubicles until they got the problem resolved. Hopefully I’d be able to log into my phone and complete my before the night ended. The lights flashed again as Ralph grumbled.

We packed up our things to move to the building next door. This night couldn’t end soon enough, but at least I’d be off for the week after my shift.

I tried to turn my computer on one last time to sign out, this time the screen lit up black with blood red drips of code oozing down the page. Random letters filling out the word ZALGO. Zalgo? I remembered hearing about Zalgo as some internet boogeyman, some dark god that infected coding.

Ralph let out an agonizing scream as his his body floated in in the air.  I froze as a spindly figure slammed him repeatedly against the floor. He screamed until his voice became wet gurgles. The creature tossed against the wall, leaving a trail of blood as he slid down. 

""GET OUT!"" I screamed at the creature as I pushed all my will at it.  I was terrified, but also angry that this creature, this bug would dare terrorize me at my work.  Oh, this was on like donky kong.

The spindly creature screamed and unnatural high pitched sound before fading into the wall.  Pressure surrounded me and the air grew freezing. My breath came out in cold puffs against the dimming florescent lights. Rob coward under his desk, whispering the lords prayer, I knelt down beside him. 

""This has to be a dream, some nightmare.  I'm going to wake up next to my wife in a few minutes,"" his eyes were desperate and gleaming with tears.

""I'm afraid not.  We're going to have to dig our heels in and fight.  The only way out of this is through-""

""What are you talking about?""

""Long story, I'll explain later we don't have time.""

“I’m going to need y’all to stay down!” said Jarvis. His laid back demeanor changed, his eyes became hard as he crouched and explored the territory, he held out a taser in front of him. 

His radio made a static garbled sound as the lights flickered around us. Jarvis walked along side the wall, nervously glancing at the perimeter. I curled under my desk, numb from shock. 

Movement flashed in the inky blackness, and I crawled under the desk next to Rob.  A shadow in the darkness out of the corner of my eye that would slip back into the shadows when I looked at it head on.

All I wanted was a day off, I had put in weeks of overtime to have this vacation and this thing was not going to take it away from me. I needed to find Jarvis , pull the fire alarm and run the hell out of dodge. Let the authorities or a priest deal with this. What happened to Ralph was horrible and I would not let that happen to anyone else. I wasn’t about to sit around and play victim to this thing.

I inched carefully towards Robs desk, and tapped him on the shoulder. He turned around and bear hugged me so tight the air was knocked out of me. 

“I have a wife and kids. Oh God, what did I do to deserve any of this?”

""Dude, I can't breath.""

He released his grip on me as the air rushed back into my lungs.

“Sorry,” he said.

“It’s fine. The second thing I need you to do is to stop panicking. I have a plan to escape, but we’re going to have to find Jarvis.”

“But he’s security, he can handle himself-”

“Not against this thing.” I reached in my shirt and pulled out my pentacle. “I’ve worked with spirits before, most are harmless but this bug is malevolent. It's time for me to crack the Raid out.”

“Are you sure you know what you’re doing?”

“I have no clue, but I’d rather improvise a plan and risk getting out of here alive than giving up. You have faith, you'll need it. Hang on to it, it’ll be the one thing that grounds yourself against it.”

From my experiences in ghost hunting and research, malignant spirits fed on those with little direction or sense of self. That’s why faith banished them, it was you calling in on your higher self, hell, even an atheist could banish it if they had enough belief in themselves and the solid world around them, just replace “may the power of Christ compel you with , ‘you won’t ruin my reality’.” For me it was ""I reject your reality and substitute it with my own!"" bad choice of works in fact checking or politics, but golden in fighting malevolent spirits.

I held my breath as I crept along the edge of the office wall, the creature flitting through the shadows, just out of my sight. The coward was avoiding me, perhaps escape was going to be easy. Jarvis was standing at the corner, his gun pointed and his eyes scanning the area. A dark inky shadow slipped away,  the hum growing  louder as the office went from pitch black to a sickly yellow light.

“Jarvis?”

He turned around, his gun trained on me, I raised my hands in submission.

“Erika! I told you and Rob to remain in place!”

“I know.”

Jarvis lowered his gun and took a deep breath. “What the hell is going on?”

“This is going to sound a little woo woo, but what we’re not up against a human intruder-”

“I’m gonna tell you something, this place was always a bit off, especially at night. But I didn’t say nothing, as long as the bills were paid. So what if the lights occasionally flickered or the computers froze, that’s normal night shit, right? Tell me why they hired a security guard when they need a motherfucking exorcist or some shit?”

“I am an exorcist.  Well, at least I am for my coven.”

“You can fight this thing?  You saw what it did to Ralph?”

“ The worst thing you can do right now is panic and feed this thing energy. That’s why I need you to calm down.”

Jarvis stared at me blankly, I my reflection gleamed in his dark eyes, and behind me a shadow crept. I rushed to his other side and the being skittered away. 

“It's afraid of me,” I said.

Rob slowly walked from around the corner. 

“All right. Everyone is accounted for, treat it like an active shooter drill. We need ot reach the door,” I said.

The lights flickered off and we ran towards the exit door at the end of the office, only to find it locked.

Jarvis grabbed my hand and I grabbed Robs as we made it toward the other door only to find that it was also locked. 

“Oh come on! Out of every trope possible!” I punched the door with my hand only to yelp and shake the pain out of my knuckles.

“So what do we do now?” asked Rob. His eyes pleading for help.

“The only thing I can do, fight it.”

We ran down to the break room, the lights flashed on and off before we got there. I led them through the door slamming it behind me. I found the salt shakers and salt packets and poured out a rough circle. Dizziness hit me like a wave and the pressure dropped so fast that both of my ears popped.  Shadows formed into a long spindly creature, like it was shoved together out of old coat hangers and ink. It reached through the door and cried when it hit the salt. 

Rob clutched his cross pendent as Jarvis aimed his gun.

“Don’t shoot, it won’t do any good. Rob keep praying.” I grabbed a handful of salt packets. “I’m going , if I don't come back, call Mark and tell him that I love him.” I handed Jarvis my phone, my husband’s contact information on the front page.

“You can’t lay that on me, let me go with you.” Jarvis aimed toward the window, awaiting the creature to return.

“I need you to stay with Rob.” I opened the door and walked out into the office. The lights returned to a sickly yellow and the screams became more distant. Whatever this thing was, it didn't want to deal with me. It wanted the men and I prayed to Gaia that the salt was enough to repel it.

The creature screamed , it clicked like nails on a chalkboard. I tried each of the doors, all of them locked. The hallway seemed like a maze of doorways and florescent lights. I tried each door, jiggling each handle to no avail. Until I reached the stairway at the end of the hall, that doorway opened with little problem.

The sky ungulated with purple and blue swirls though the windows. Another wave of dizziness hit me as I climbed the stairs toward the top floor. The spindly creature crouched at the stairway, leaning like a praying mantis, it’s eyes peering at me . It screeched again and leapt up to the top floor.

I chased after it, the lights flickering on behind me as I chased it. I honestly had no idea what I would do if I caught up to it. A salt packet certainly wasn’t going to kill it and I had no weapon. I regretted not listening to Jarvis. 

I went to the empty breakroom by roof in our building. I rummaged through all the cabinets but all I found was a plastic spoon and a couple of trays. 

Lightning flashed revealing the monster couched in praying mantis form, a portal swirling behind it. Perhaps that was were it came from, why it chose to attack an office in night shift was beyond me. 

I walked out onto the roof and the wind started to blow. The creature lunged for me but I ducked back. I threw some salt in its direction and it shrieked at me. I felt the ground beneath my feet. I was going to go on vacations, this creature was not going to ruin it for me. 

Two gunshots fired and the creature screamed. Jarvis stood in the doorway his gun in perfect aim with the creature. 

“I told you not to come in here!”

“Ericka, I need you to stay back-”

“It’s non corporeal-”

Jarvis began to float in the air, the creature taking control of his body.. 

“I am the daughter of Gia, the Daughter of the Hecate and Morrigan!” 

The creature shrieked and Jarvis dropped to the ground. Rob followed confidently behind him, holding the cross out in front of him. 

“Down into the ground and among the roots, out of our leaves and shoots. Leave as all be, you have no power over me!” I chanted.

The swirling clouds overhead were pierced by bright sunlight. The creature leapt at Jarvis but Rob and I stood in it’s way, forming a wall between it and the security guard.

Full sunlight hit the creature and it screamed one last time before turning into a pile of dust beneath our feet. And we both fell, exhausted in the morning sun.

I walked into back into the breakroom to find all the lights back on in their pale, florescent glory. The doors once again opened and I followed the stairs down. Ralph’s lifeless body lie on the first floor. But it was no longer mangled, but still and cold. Jarvis called 911 and soon  sirens sounded in the background.

“You saved my life,” said Jarvis. “You both did.”

“What do we tell the police when they show up?"" asked Rob.

“That there was a power outage and Ralph had a medical emergency. That’s what the coverup will be.” I sighed.

“How did you know what to do?” 

""It's a long story.""

Long story indeed. I managed to defeat this creature easily, but who sent it?  The beast wasn't intelligent enough to come up with it's own plan.  Someone set it on us, and I sat thinking of everyone I could have offended.  A customer would have no idea who I was outside of work, so that idea was out. Perhaps it had nothing to do with me, and it was some lover's quarrel or someone upset and wanting vengeance on their boss.  

To cover my bases I took a salt shaker and sprinkled them around the building.  I thought of a steel wall covering the office building.  I hoped it was enough of a ward to last until I returned to work next week.""  I would stay for a few more hours and answer questions from the authorities. My work had better pay me overtime for this. 

My vacation couldn't come fast enough, I wanted to go hiking on a mountain pass far from phones and civilization.  You best believe Mark was driving me out there after the night I've had.",2,1731737812.0,DrCreepensVault,0,1.0,False
