1i77vzu,https://www.reddit.com/r/toxicparents/comments/1i77vzu/mom_is_always_negative_and_destroyed_my_self_worth/,Mom is always negative and destroyed my self worth.,"Mother has always acted angrily at me, even when talking about mundane things. She wouldn't say ""\[Name\], come have lunch, it's ready"", she would scorn and loudly yell ""COME EAT, NOW!!!"" - that attitude repeats constantly. Mother literally has one gear when talking to me.

I dont even get basic pleasantries. There's no ""pleases"", ""thank yous"", no ""good days"", never have I heard from her a ""have a nice day"", ""have fun!"", ""congratulations"" etc. She is always negative, a curse-caster from some RPG.

During 5th grade and all the way through high school, she would yell phrases such ""DO NOT BE A BUM AND GET UP ON TIME!!!!"" And she would say things like that consistently, daily. Sometimes she would growl it from across the house, while lying in her own bed, and I was up and getting myself ready for school with time to spare. I asked her many times to stop yelling, she didn't have to do it that way, she didn't need to do it at all, I even asked dad to talk to her. It would improve for a day, maybe two, never ""stick"".

I was late for class ONCE in second year of high school. No reason whatsoever to suspect anything bad, she just assumed I would be because it's me, and I can possibly do something right.

A few times I tried to ""bring her"" into a positive space. Once I made myself some coffee and breakfast, and when she woke up I told her with a sunshine on my face: Hello! Good morning. Would you like a sandwich? I'll make it just the way you like.

Best case scenario she does or say nothing, most of the time though she would snap on some random thing like ""THIS HEAT MAKES MY SKIN CRAWL""; Worse case, she can respond to a nice ""good morning"" with berserk mode: ""YOU STAYED UP ALL NIGHT DIDNT YA? NO I DONT WANT ANYTHING, WHY ARE YOU EATING AT THIS HOUR? YOU LOOK LIKE CRAP!""

Maybe I did look like crap, I'll give her that much. had trouble with sleep since young age, Long story short is that I have bad sleep, but I can sleep for long hours, sometimes I have too. Meaning mother had the perfect free-way for her toxicity, calling me lazy, a bum...

I was 14 or 15 when I told her a few times about my trouble sleeping... She would have ""suggestions"", toxic criticism grunted at me, it was never ""lets see what we can do"" or ""I believe you"", it was my eating habits, the window shouldn't be closed, I didn't get enough sun, the covers I used were too heavy, I went to bed too late, how long I showered for... Always my fault.

Yet I could follow all those ""suggestions"" and they did nothing, so then I had to do her ""suggestions"" at a different time, or I did but not the way she meant, or I did it wrong because it was a certain way, actually it's window should be closed, I heard it wrong the first time...

Not once she said we should seek a professional. Not once she helped. Not once I was given hope, it was always my fault because I did bad things and never good things, thus I was bad and deserving of shit. 

Ironically, she's probably the chief cause I have bad sleep in the first place - It relates to stress and anxiety, geez I wonder why I have those.

Of course I'm not perfect, but I wasn't a bad kid. Not once I got in trouble in school, I had my days like every kid but I was good child. Most my teachers liked me, good grades and all that. 

The straw that broke the camels back came this last monday. I bought a few niceties to myself, mostly clothes. Mother interrupted my dinner to""ask"", in her aggressive accusatory way, if I was ""a whore selling myself"" - those were her exact words. 

Now I believe sex work is hard and real work that deserves respect, but mother didn't ask if I was working, she growled and interrogated me, assuming that I was a whore. For the record I work IT, I fix computers, routers, printers, laptops and so on. I'm not gonna work at NASA anytime soon but I did get a decent gig in december and it was enough to get some niceties like new clothes.

This tuesday, again while I was preparing dinner, she walked up to the kitchen, picked up a sweet potato and said ""if you wanna \*\*actually\*\* lose weight you should eat more of this"".

\*Context: I lost considerable weight past few years. It is an accomplishment I'm proud of and it took numerous healthy changes, not once I even considered doing anything remotely questionable to achieve that goal, it was ALL diet and exercise.\*

I cackled at mother's implication, ""to actually lose weight"". Bitch I lost 17Kg! That is a measurable, objective fact, a literal number of something I accomplished. I laughed at her loudly and responded ""I'm losing weight just fine, I'm good.""

Mother did not like that at all! She growled, raised her finger, yelled in typical accusatory manner: ""THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE TAKING MEDS! OZEMPIC AND THINGS LIKE THAT!!!""

Her destructive toxic criticism bounced off. So she went to tactic number 2: Calling me a ""cheater"" with an absurd ""accusation"" so even I actually lost weight \*but\* it was through wrong-doing (in her small mind, not mine, dont care if you use whatever).

That's just last monday and tuesday, two days. Been through this as long as I can remember. I did nothing to deserve a constant barrage of judgment, recently or ever.

Mother destroyed whatever sense of self-worth I ever had. By the time I was 16 I believe deeply that I was a run over carcass of a person, unworthy, distrustful of friends, and any positivity I got I had to mentally fight to believe it was real.

Many think I'm amazing, and there's great people in my life that have shown me not only I am loved, but more importantly that I am deserving of said love. I deserved a mom, hugs, encouragement and hope, not a gaslighting asshole drill sergeant that wants me to believe I'm a piece of shit.

Long-time lurker, first real post. After 3 years of struggling to finish my first novel, I completely changed my process and managed to write two books in 2024. Thought I'd share what worked for me:

1. BIGGEST CHANGE: Switched from typing to dictation

I realized I could speak WAY faster than I type. Started with Dragon (ugh) then Apple dictation (double ugh), finally found [Willow](https://seewillow.com/) which actually understands normal human speech.

2. Time Blocking (but make it realistic)

\- 6-8am: Coffee + dictate rough draft (walking/pacing helps ideas flow)

\- 8-9am: Quick cleanup of dictated text

\- 2-3pm: Actual editing

\- 8-10pm: Planning next day's scenes

3. Scene Cards Method

Started using Notion for scene planning:

\- One card per scene

\- 3 bullet points max per scene

\- Rearrange as needed

\- Color code by plot thread

4. The ""Shitty First Draft"" mindset

Biggest mental shift: Accepting that first drafts can (and should) suck. Just get the story out. You can't edit a blank page.

5. Environment Hacks

\- Noise-cancelling headphones

\- Dark mode everything

\- Standing desk

\- Text-to-speech for editing (hearing your work helps catch issues)

6. Progress Tracking

Started using:

\- Daily word count spreadsheet

\- Weekly goals (not daily)

\- Monthly writing income

\- Project completion rate

Tools I use:

\- Scrivener for organizing

\- Willow for dictation (seriously, try speaking your story)

\- Notion for planning

\- Forest app for focus

\- Grammarly for quick edits

Results:

2023: 500-1000 words/day, 1 unfinished book

2024: 3000-5000 words/day, 2 completed books

Common Questions:

""Isn't dictation awkward?""

At first, yes. But after a week it feels natural. Plus you can dictate anywhere - walking, doing dishes, etc.

""What about editing?""

I actually edit less now. Speaking naturally helps avoid overthinking.

""Cost?""

Tools are an investment but worth it. Time saved = more writing = more income.

Biggest Lessons:

1. Movement helps creativity

2. Tools matter less than consistency

3. Perfect is the enemy of done

4. Systems beat willpower

Hope this helps someone! Happy to answer questions.

Till now I have tried
- the coffee chronicler‚Äôs hybrid recipe
- Testu‚Äôs devil and new hybrid
- Sherry Hsu‚Äôs daily driver

I have a timemore c2 and my grind size is usually 18-20 clicks

All of them have given me some decent brews but nothing mind-blowing yet. For some reason I can‚Äôt get a consistent batch every single time. Need some resources or opinions on how to get the best out of my switch every time

I am also curious to know what do you people do if you have to get more coffee than what‚Äôs recommended in the recipes. With my aeropress I could maintain the ratio of coffee to water and the output would be consistent. But with a pouover method whenever I want to increase the output I am unsure how to go about it since the draw down times are obviously longer with more volume

Example: Tetsu‚Äôs recipe suggests 20g coffee to 300ml water. If I need to use 30g to 450ml what else needs to change to maintain the taste? Do I grind a little coarser? Or just brew longer?

Also do these recipes not the best for Indian beans? Is complete immersion better than hybrid

Sorry I have too many questions. It took me many months to get perfect my aeropress. Now I feel I am going to take as many months to perfect my switch. Any tips or suggestions from switch owners / pouover experts would be a great help. Thanks",1,1737540023.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False

Back story: me(31f) and my partner(32m) have been together for 6 years and he started going to solo therapy a few years ago for mental health and adhd. Our sex life already sucked at this point (roughly 3 years into our relationship) mostly due to me being largely uninterested for various reasons including poor communication, unbalanced work life, not being satisfied, and personal trauma. This resulted in intimacy being few and far between and my partner feeling undesired and me feeling anxious and uncomfortable. At some point our sex life was brought up in therapy and after about 6 months my partner brought up being allowed to sleep with other people to alleviate urges. 
I took this so poorly, my partner was afraid it was going to change everything for the worse but after I could take the night to process I was able to ask some realistic questions and bring up points, such as it would be a two way street and how this would look in daily life. The logic didn‚Äôt work and the conversation was tabled until I brought it back up before this last holiday season. I have some other women in my life who mention they have done it long term and some of the benefits it brings their relationship and I began to like the idea of having some independence, increasing the amount of communication I give, and generally just feeling lighter about life. My partner was happy when I brought the conversation back but seemed adamant about me taking first steps forward from there. After the holidays I was recommended Feeld and decided to put some feelers out there. My collective time on there is about two weeks and I haven‚Äôt prioritized it a ton. I haven‚Äôt pursued much and have had some casual conversations and one 20 minute meet and greet with a nice person I met but nothing very serious. I helped my partner get on the app too and his collective time was about five days at this point. he had a small coffee meet up and wound up making plans to go be intimate a few nights later. 
I‚Äôve been crashing out ever since he got intimate with someone. The day they met up I felt mostly fine, just sort of neutral as it seemed very casual. The next day we were busy with work and friends and the morning after he told me he planned on going to her house after work and I felt sort of shocked to hear that but I tried to just have a good face about it. After he got off work around 10 pm he came home to shower to leave and I was feeling very anxious and sort of grilled him about hygiene and how I‚Äôm already weird about our intimacy and his lack of hygiene afterwards such as oral and beard care and how that had to be a priority - I really was just anxiously rambling and he asked if I‚Äôd rather he stayed home and I just felt uncomfortable stopping him from going. He left about 20 minutes later and I felt alright while he was gone but when he came home later in such high spirits I felt everything crash. I was disgusted and upset and talked about it and the last three days since have not been any better. I‚Äôm so shocked that he jumped in so quickly and eagerly and this slow build up we‚Äôve been working on together feels tossed aside much like myself. Logically I shouldn‚Äôt feel like this but I‚Äôve been so hurt and angry it‚Äôs almost hard to think clearly. I try to talk about it with my partner but it kind of boils down to ‚Äòit is what it is‚Äô and ‚Äòhow else am I supposed to go about it?‚Äô My partner is frustrated as he felt like he had the go ahead but I also didn‚Äôt think it would go through this way and i can‚Äôt help but feel like it was an excuse to just have sex with random women.

1i77qy3,https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/1i77qy3/desperate_for_some_reassurance/,Desperate For Some Reassurance‚Ä¶,"Hey everyone, I'm a 24-year-old guy desperate to lose weight the right way. I'm stuck at an unhealthy-for-me 172 pounds, and I‚Äôd like to get back to 145, where I truly feel like myself - confident & healthy.

I'm starting the carnivore diet, having done my due diligence on how to best go about it, but there's this nagging doubt eating at me: will this really work for me? 

Back in college, as a freshman weighing 238 pounds, I lost weight all the way to 145 in the worst ways possible - not eating, fasting for days, living off scraps like lettuce and granola bars, and just generally not nourishing myself for the sake of being skinny. It was a dark time, and I'm terrified of falling back into that dark place.

The thing is, every time I've eaten a lot in the past, I've only gained weight. Admittedly, those weren't healthy foods - fast food and lots of carb heavy meals like chicken parm sandwiches and such. Steaks with all those classic steakhouse sides made for families - You get the picture. It wasn‚Äôt a healthy diet for an 18 year old kid with many other issues.

Still, I'm scared that even with this new, healthier approach, I might not see the scale move in the right direction. It‚Äôs just so much food my brain associates with being fat again, even though I know science says otherwise.

I've cut out alcohol for this journey, but I'm holding onto black coffee and my vape, my two remaining vices.

I've seen others' success stories here, which are fantastic, but I need to believe it's possible for me too, given my history and past mistakes. Can anyone out there reassure me that the carnivore diet could be my way out of this weight struggle, without dragging me back into unhealthy habits?

TL;DR: 24M, desperately trying carnivore to lose weight from 172 to 145 lbs. Concerned about effectiveness due to past unhealthy weight loss methods in early college and seeking reassurance from others who have similar stories.",1,1737539876.0,carnivorediet,0,1.0,False
1i77qhc,https://www.reddit.com/r/step1/comments/1i77qhc/write_up_tested_on_2612_nbme_score_54_to_72/,"Write up , tested on 26/12 Nbme score 54 to 72","Hello guys , 

I did not plan to do a write up but this group has been very helpful and I have some things that are not previously mentioned so I think I should do one .

Firstly , my preparation was pretty standard , i did BNB videos annotated them on a digital FA (i wish i switched to digital FA earlier GAME CHANGER!) , did u world along with it . i completed 82 percent u world till sept and my exam was on 20th September , my mistake was underestimating NBME and overestimating myself and did my nbme 13 days before the exam and scored  a 54% , completely shattered my confidence and i extended my triad till December as i clearly was not ready . next 40 days i did not study i could not pick myself to study , FA and u world just gave me alot of anxiety and panic . I think around 10th November i started studying again . by 20th nov i decided i have to give the exam by the end of december . i was re reading FA and doing U world that was left . i gave an NBME on 1st dec - 59% not the best but had improved from the last nbme so i was Okay , I kept revising doing U world here and there not much , watching dirty medicine videos and Hy ques series on YT , gave another nbme on 9th dec - 65% then revised some more topics next nbme 14th dec - 67 % . I revised more topics and i think by 18th dec i started reading some Mehelman pdfs - arrows , cardio , CNS . my seniors told me to not give nbme in the last week of exam which i did not listen to and gave my last one on 22nd dec and scored a 72 % i was happy with it i just wanted to reach 70 . also in the last week i gave nbme 28 casually (block wise ) scored about 68 and free 120 also given casually scored about 69. 

Exam day - I was extremely anxious in the last week of the exam and i could not eat properly with alot of nausea , surprisingly on the exam day i was ok because i knew i have given my all . The center and the process of the exam is pretty smooth i took a black coffee and protein bars with me and i could not even get through one bar entirely during those 8 hours . Somehow 8 hours do not seem that long in the exam . But the exam was very long , the stems were longer then any stems i have ever seen , people say they are similar to free 120 , i felt they are longer and not at all as straightforward as the nbme , questions are tricky and i felt the exam is going very badly , but i read someone write that he/she had a 75 and failed because they panicked so i just took one question at a time and focused on getting through my block which was a task i was able to complete most blocks with 1-2 min remaining so could not get back to flagged questions which were 15 to 20 per block . I think the third block i could not read the last question and answered just by reading the last 2 lines . 

tips - 1. work on time management . try setting a target to finish an NBME block in 1 hr 10 min 

2. do not eat too much in breaks it might lead to an energy crash .

3 . wear something without pockets and avoid shoes , try flats or slippers as they are checked after every break and hence would save you some time . 

4. carry a very small generic bottle without labels they let you carry that inside .

5. carry emergency meds like for headache , nausea , acidity . i had to  take a paracetamol for headache due to so much screen time . 

6 try taking a break after each block so the next block seems fresh and new 

7 , MOST IMPORTANT  - TAKE ONE QUESTION AT A TIME , DO NOT OBSESS OVER QUESTIONS , OBSESSING WILL JUST MAKE LESS TIME FOR EASIER DOABLE QUESTIONS ..

next just All the very best and trust the process , if i can do it I am sure you can . your mindset on the exam day is of utmost importance . i am happy to answer any questions .

------------------------------------------------------

Imagine stepping into your dream home, surrounded by the beauty of nature, where rustic charm meets modern functionality. This is the reality of living in a red barndominium. Combining a barn's exterior with a well-designed living space, a red barndominium is more than just a house; it's a lifestyle. Let's dive into what makes this unique dwelling so appealing and the benefits of choosing one as your next home.

### Stylish Aesthetic

One of the most striking features of a red barndominium is its undeniable charm. The classic red siding against the backdrop of lush greenery creates a picturesque scene. This vibrant color immediately draws the eye, making it a perfect centerpiece for any property. Inside, you can mix rustic touches‚Äîlike exposed beams and hardwood floors‚Äîwith modern finishes to create a home that reflects your personal style.

### Spacious Living Areas

Red barndominiums stand out for their open floor plans. Unlike traditional homes, these structures often boast high ceilings and expansive spaces, giving you plenty of room to breathe. You can design large living rooms, spacious kitchens, and cozy dining areas without the limitations of conventional layouts. Consider these advantages:

- **Flexibility:** Open spaces allow for versatile furniture arrangements.
- **Entertaining:** A large living area is perfect for gatherings with family and friends.
- **Natural Light:** Large windows can illuminate your space, making it feel even more inviting.

### Affordability

Building a barndominium is often more affordable than traditional homes. The cost-effective materials and construction processes contribute to significant savings. Here are a few reasons why this makes financial sense:

- **Lower Construction Costs:** The simple design and structure can cut down labor costs.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Many barndominiums are built with insulation, resulting in lower energy bills.
- **Reduced Maintenance:** Durable materials mean fewer repairs and upkeep over time.

### Eco-Friendly Living

In an age where sustainability matters, red barndominiums are also a great option. Building with eco-friendly materials and incorporating renewable designs make them an attractive choice for environmentally conscious homeowners. Features to consider include:

- **Solar Panels:** Harnessing solar energy reduces dependency on grid power.
- **Rainwater Harvesting:** Collecting rainwater for irrigation conserves precious resources.
- **Natural Ventilation:** The open design promotes airflow, lowering the need for air conditioning.

### Versatility

One of the best things about a red barndominium is its versatility. You have the option to mix residential with commercial space. If you're an entrepreneur, you can even set up a home-based business without compromising your living space. Here are some creative ideas:

- **Art Studio:** The expansive area is perfect for creativity.
- **Workshop:** Tools and machinery can be housed without cluttering your living areas.
- **Guest Quarters:** Convert part of the space into guest accommodations for visiting friends and family.

### Connection with Nature

Living in a red barndominium often means being surrounded by open spaces. Many are built on farms or large pieces of land, allowing you to enjoy nature right outside your doorstep. Whether it‚Äôs sipping coffee on the porch while watching the sunrise or taking leisurely walks on your property, this connection to the outdoors promotes a peaceful lifestyle.

### Easy Customization

Another attractive element of red barndominiums is the ease of customization. With fewer structural constraints, homeowners can adapt their space as their needs change over time. From adding a patio to creating additional rooms, your barndominium can grow with you. This allows for a living space that's uniquely yours‚Äîone that fits your life, style, and family.

Choosing to live in a red barndominium is about embracing a lifestyle that celebrates character, space, affordability, and connection with nature. This unique style offers not only a home but also a canvas for creativity and personal expression, making it a perfect choice for anyone looking to blend modern living with rustic charm. Whether you're building your dream home or seeking a new adventure, a red barndominium could be the perfect choice for you.

Designing Your Ideal Red Barndominium: Tips and Ideas
-----------------------------------------------------

Designing your dream red barndominium can be an exciting and fulfilling project. These unique structures blend the charm of traditional barns with modern living spaces. By focusing on a few key elements, you can create a space that is not only functional but also beautiful. Here are some tips to help you design the ideal red barndominium that meets your lifestyle needs.

### Consider the Layout

The layout is one of the most critical aspects of your barndominium. Think about how you want your living space organized.

- **Open Floor Plan:** Many barndominiums feature a spacious open layout. This can create a welcoming atmosphere and make the space feel larger.
- **Defined Spaces:** If you prefer separate rooms, consider using furniture to define areas without building additional walls.
- **Multi-Functional Areas:** Design spaces that serve more than one purpose. For example, a home office can double as a guest bedroom.

### Choose Your Exterior Style

The exterior of your red barndominium sets the tone for your home. Selecting the right materials and design elements is essential.

- **Color Palette:** Stick with traditional red siding paired with white or grey accents for a classic look.
- **Roof Design:** A steep sloped roof can add charm and help with rain runoff.
- **Windows and Doors:** Large windows provide natural light and views of the surrounding landscape. Choose doors that complement the overall design.

### Incorporate Natural Elements

Blending nature with architecture can enhance the warmth of your barndominium. Consider these elements:

- **Natural Light:** Strategically placed windows can bring the outdoors in, making your space feel airy and open.
- **Wood Accents:** Incorporate wood beams or paneling for a rustic touch that ties back to its barn origins.
- **Landscaping:** Surround your barndominium with lush plants and trees to create a serene environment.

### Focus on Interior Design

The interior design of your red barndominium is where you can truly express your style. Here are some ideas:

- **Color Schemes:** Use warm colors like earthy browns and deep reds to create a cozy feel.
- **Comfortable Furnishings:** Choose soft, inviting furniture that encourages relaxation.
- **Unique Features:** Consider adding a stone fireplace or an island in the kitchen to create a focal point.

### Utilize Sustainable Materials

Choosing eco-friendly materials can benefit both the environment and your home‚Äôs longevity. Here are some sustainable options:

- **Reclaimed Wood:** Using reclaimed materials for flooring or accents ensures a unique look while reducing waste.
- **Energy-Efficient Windows:** Installing double or triple-pane windows can help keep energy costs down.
- **Solar Panels:** Consider installing solar panels on the roof to harness renewable energy.

### Plan for Future Needs

When designing your red barndominium, keep in mind how your needs may change in the future. Think about:

- **Family Growth:** Ensure there‚Äôs enough space for children's bedrooms or guest accommodations.
- **Accessibility:** Plan for aging in place by incorporating wider doorways and single-story living if possible.
- **Storage Solutions:** Build in plenty of storage to accommodate your hobbies and interests that may evolve over time.

Designing your perfect red barndominium involves thoughtful consideration of layout, style, and functionality. By integrating natural elements and sustainability into your plans, you can create a home that is not only visually appealing but also eco-friendly. Remember to think ahead for future needs to ensure your new barndominium remains a cherished haven for years to come.

Whether you're looking for a rustic retreat or a modern living space, your red barndominium can be everything you've envisioned. Let your creativity flow as you embark on this exciting design journey!

I live with my gf and we work together. We spend nearly every minute together or barely time apart. Most would probably be an hour or so if we're on different floors. And we text. My girlfriend presented to me a problem where if I don't sleep with her, she can't sleep. Even though she has before and I would just be on my pc quietly literally 10 feet across the room. Need cuddles? Gotcha. Want a kiss? Absolutely. Just need a hug? You know what time it is. But I am very much a night owl and I love the ambience of late night coffee, quiet video games and music. I do not want to go to sleep even if it's 4 AM. I work a late shift anyway. I just want to play some video games a little longer and listen to music. If I leave to do anything else, after half an hour I get a text like ""where go ü•∫"" which is cute and sweet but at the same time when you take issues like this super serious, it becomes less funny and more annoying.

The other night when I found out she had a problem with this, she started crying when I was on my PC at 2 AM. So I immediately shut it off and asked her of she's okay. And she sobs at me and says how she cannot physically sleep without me and she's so tired being up all night ""waiting for me"". It took me 5 minutes to calm her down enough to just answer some basic fucking questions about what was wrong.

1i77h1r,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i77h1r,I started a paragraph and it turned into a near novel. SMH. There's just too many examples of Conservative regret...,"""Nothing in all the world is more dangerous than sincere ignorance and conscientious stupidity.""
‚Äì Martin Luther King Jr.

I'm not an intellectual, I'm not a social commentator, but I do know what lurve is Jennay. I have done my best to use reputable sources in the time I have to elucidate my observations below. I have an inkling of what I don't know but do not profess to be an expert. This is the vibe I'm getting.

If there's some misquoted references, I am open to correction.

Even before the inauguration, there was one saving grace... 

Watching the conservative meltdowns with all the post-election bait and switches. The leopards eating faces is in full swing. It's all over social media and it's pretty to watch.

Farmers, hospitality and builders are shitting themselves, both employer and employees, about the no holds barred ""undocumented immigrant"" deportation plans. Ex-allies cracking the shits. Lowsco MAGATs regretting being dumb. Tech Bros wondering WTF happened. Just all round regret out there for the world to see. 

So I'll start with who I feel are the biggest of losers, whom have realised they have backed their antichrist - the ""illegals"". The ones who no matter how hard they try will never be ""oNe oF uS"".

Believe it or not, undocumented immigrants, the ""illegals"" made up as of 2022, a massive estimated 8.3 million people in the civilian workforce (static notably since 2007), that constitutes about 5% of those working or seeking work in America. They are massively overrepresented in certain jobs... You know, the ones that no ""white"" people want to do... The low paid or back breaking laborious jobs. That's 26% of farming, fisheries, and forestry workers; 17% of cleaning, maintenance, and groundskeeping workers; 14% of construction workers; and 11% of food preparation workers. (Wikipedia)

These people have been ""factored in"" to the economy for decades they keep prices low and businesses operating. Now they are suddenly about to be ripped out of the economy where they contribute approximately $11.7 billion annually in state and local taxes (Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy), add around $13 billion annually to Social Security, but only withdraw about $1 billion in benefits. (Social Security Administration 2016)

About 50% of undocumented immigrants file federal income tax returns, according to a report by the Migration Policy Institute (MPI, 2023). Despite this, they are ineligible for most federal and state benefits funded by their taxes, such as Social Security, Medicare, and unemployment insurance. (Congressional Budget Office, 2020)

The Latino vote - especially males was pivotal in key swing states. For instance, in Florida, Trump won 56% of the Latino vote, contributing significantly to his victory in the state. (Phoenix Florida)

With talk prior to the election, that mass deportations would be an executive order, yesterday it came true, with him signing the order for the ""largest deportation program in American history."" This plan includes deploying military troops to the U.S.-Mexico border. (Fox 5 News)

Not only will they try to deport the undocumented, but he has signed another order with intent to end ""birthright citizenship"". That is, the deportation of children and grandchildren of undocumented immigrants born in the USA. (Politico)

Deportation to places they have never been and maybe don't even speak the language. 

The 14th Amendment of the US Constitution included the provision for birthright citizenship. The order will be challenged and I assume will end up in SCOTUS. 

Those hungry leopards will be fended off by the American Civil Liberties Union law suits.(WSJ).I picture the ACLU will have many fights over the next 4 years. Often fighting a fight for those that actively or passively acted against their own self-interest. Rowwwwrrr.

So what about all of those soon to be missing illegal workers? The deported children of those illegal immigrants? The once 5% of the workforce, now leaving so much work to whom?

Hence, as I said, farmers are shitting themselves. But I have a theory. 

Did you notice the surge in prison stock prices on Trump's victory? Private prison stocks the ""for profit incarceration"" industry, experienced notable gains. GEO Group's shares rose by 74%, and CoreCivic's shares increased by 55% after the election. (Financial Times). GEO donated nearly a million USD to Trump. (News Week).

I'm betting that of those 8.3 million workers to be ""deported"" most won't be. Either it's another broken promise to the Base or they will be put into prison farms and turned into slave labour. 

This is where the 13th Amendment of the Constitution does support Trump and the potential for this to happen. 

""Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction."" (Constitution of the United States of America). 

You see, after the abolition of slavery, Southern states faced economic challenges due to the loss of free labor. The exception clause ""except for punishment of crime"" allowed these states to maintain a labor force through the criminal justice system, leading to practices like convict leasing, where incarcerated individuals were leased to private enterprises for labor. (History Channel). Southern states then enacted laws known as Black Codes to criminalize minor offenses, disproportionately targeting African Americans. But this time it's the Latinos.

The legacy of the exception clause is still evident in today's criminal justice system, where prison labor remains prevalent. (Cornell Law Review). Trump will build on this. 

Social media has been full of conservative regret about this. People voting against themselves because they went in blind, or just thought ""not me, they are talking about the criminals"". In other cases I've seen spouses voting against their partners position or children voting against their parents position. If the ACLU isn't successful, that will rope the leopard lovers into it. It's sad that the non conservative informed will be dragged into this also. 

However, the unholy alliance of the president and the first lady Elona has probably been the most interesting, with Elona going against the MAGAT ideals and promoting the increase in H1-B visas. The visa that allows entry to ""higher educated"" workers. You know, the ones that bring in sub continental Indians, who will work for a pittance, accept lower work standards, be shit scared to speak up for fear of losing their jobs and being deported back home. 

That comes off the back of Tesla sacking 6600 tech workers and bringing in 1300 H1-B workers (Snopes). But it doesn't stop there. 

It's a thing of beauty and I compiled this before the inauguration, so this shit is going to ramp up like a petrol fire. It leads to the next face eating fest that is so beautiful to see... 

That's the Ultra MAGAs like Bannon, Fuentes and Loomer, who are now mad enough to lynch a history book. They see the unholy alliance as a betrayal by Trump for accepting any immigration (and themselves not personally benefiting from it). 

Loomer, the conspiracy theorist and out of the closet, proud to be racist, Fuentes the ""your body my choice"" mysoginist and Bannon the once been to gaol for Trump, fell out, now back to bros, advocate for America over every other country policy. He decided to do the time by contempting congress in refusing to be deposed by the select committee in the Jan 6 insurrection investigation. The committee that Trump, Loudermilk and some house members have called to have prosecuted, due to investigating the King's trying to overturn the election. So Bannon is that type like the consumate Libertarian, that takes no notice that the position they are in now, has taken centuries of social cooperation, domestically or internationally, But hey now I'm on top now, so let's rip out the carpet and every one for themselves. You know, that ""America First"" policy Trump holds dear.

So these guys didn't seem to notice that Trump flip flops to any position that benefits him and now that the First Couple are in bed for plenty of dollarydoos, the minions are angrier than a redneck at a tofu festival. So pretty.

His supporters.... Damn. They are on the same page and spitting chips for the same reason. They would rather have Jos√© the spud digger and his family sent packing, than take a middle of January swim in the newly named Gulf of America. ""SMH on that one"", being chalked up as a win for the new administration, some of the irate MAGATs are saying.

I guess the next biggest feast of the leopards I'm seeing online is in reference to the tarrifs. I'm not seeing as many regular punters picking up on this on twitter or conservative Reddit, as they are, in the majority a bit to dense to understand them independently.

They only really pick up the gist when they are interviewed online, where they start off raving about how awesome it is that China is going to pay 25 to 50% more for what America buys from them. Yeh... I'll say that again. China will pay more for what America buys from China. TBH I think that is what Trump thought when he started talking about Tarrifs back in 2016 too. But once he's there, he's there, and just like a rabbid kangaroo, there's no going backwards. Remember Sharpygate?

Back in 2016 he tried the tarrif thing and implemented them in 2018, firstly on Aluminium imports, washing machines and solar panels (USTR press release). Maybe he had an inkling that Russia could do with a few more on the international market, so they could actually have some outside St Petersburg and Moscow. The Russians attempted to made up the difference during the Ukraine invasion, but just got distracted by actual toilets. Maybe porcelain shitters should have been on that tarrif list also?

So in 2019, next was the Chayyyna tarrifs, 25% on $50 billion worth of goods. (USTR section 301 Fact Sheet) that launched a retaliatory response. A trade war. The interesting thing was however, that Chayyyna was strategic in their implementation of retaliation.

Retaliatory tariffs targeted various American products, notably agricultural goods such as soybeans, pork, and corn. Boom they hit the red regions of the US, those that supported Trump (US-China Business Council).  Studies indicated that these tariffs led to increased prices for U.S. consumers and disruptions in supply chains. (Princeton Economics Department) Enter leopards that love an ignorant voter.

So, it is widely known among economists that protectionist tarrifs are counter productive. It's why they have lost favour since the 1930s when the Smoot-Hawley Tarrif Act blew up in the faces of the depression ridden country, leading to a global trade war and exacerbation of the great depression. (National Bureau of Economic Research). Countries imposing retaliatory tariffs decreased their imports from the United States by approximately 28% to 32%, highlighting the detrimental impact on U.S. export markets (Oxford Academic).

Trumps tarrifs will now be aimed squarely at China, Mexico and Canada and have been cited as 25% on his neighbours and 60% on China. (Business Insider). The aim, to increase revenue and increase domestic production. 

So now we are looking at increasing government revenues, which will now be paid for by the American consumer.

In 2017, having lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%  PERMANENTLY via the Tax Cut Jobs Act. Individuals in the median earning bracket of $42k went from 25% to 22% and those on over $418k went from 39.6% to 37%, but that has an expiry of this year (Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis).

His TCJA is projected to add approximately $1.9 trillion to the national debt over a decade (Congressional Budget Office).

He now proposes lowering the corporate rate again now to just 15% for American Corporations. (Thompson Reuters Tax and Accounting). 

Nice one American consumer, you are now going to pay at the shop for the tarrifs, whilst the tax break is given to the corporation and you can be assured it will not be trickling down. Voodoo Economics is a Reagan myth.

There may be an increase in domestic production in some sectors? Industries such as steel and aluminum may experience short-term gains due to reduced competition from imports. However, past experiences indicate that initial benefits can be offset by broader economic challenges, including retaliatory measures. (Reuters)

And so who's likely to have their faces adjusted by a big cat? 

The automotive sector. Tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico could disrupt the supply chain as the automotive industry is particularly vulnerable due to its reliance on cross-border trade. 

Michigan - Ford and General Motors, Battleground State. Well done Trump. 
South Carolina- BMW, Red State. Tennessee- Nissan. Red State. 
Kentucky- Ford, Red State.
Georgia - Kia, Red state.
Indiana - Subaru Red State.
Mississippi -Nissan, Red State.
Alabama- Mercedes US, Red State. 
Texas- Toyota and Tesla, Red State. 
California- Tesla, Blue State and that aint changing. 

Already, U.S. automotive manufacturers have expressed significant concerns regarding the potential imposition of tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, highlighting the adverse effects such measures could have on their operations and the broader industry.

General Motors analysts indicate that GM, could face substantial profit declines if a 25% tariff is imposed. The increased costs associated with these tariffs are likely to be passed on to consumers. (US News Money)

All them redneck semi-iliterate cowboy pickup lovers and factory workers will find out that Ram Trucks is projected to experience a significant reduction in annual core profits if the tariffs are implemented. The company may need to reassess its production strategies to mitigate the financial strain caused by increased import costs. (The Hill)

The additional costs incurred from tariffs are anticipated to be transferred to consumers, resulting in higher vehicle prices. This could lead to a decrease in demand, further impacting the financial performance of U.S. automakers. 

Yeeeehaww Grandmaw! Them majority red state employees might be getting their Xmas bonus delayed for a bit because you and I know, shareholder profits take precedence over the common folk.

What else will suffer?  Well them techbro Melon fanbois are not gunna be happy. Products such as electronics, apparel, and beauty items are expected to see price increases as companies pass on the additional costs of tariffs to consumers.  (Vogue Business)

The complex tech supply chains that rely on intricate global supply are unlikely to be duplicated in the United States, high labour costs compared to Mexico and China just ain't gonna let it happen. Look forward to paying two grand for your PS6 or 3 K for your new NVIDIA RTX 5090 . Lol. Already inventories are being stockpiled but that ain't gonna last long. It's expected that sales will decline up to 68% (Signal AI)

And those farmers? Previous tariffs have resulted in retaliatory measures affecting U.S. agricultural exports. Farmers may face reduced market access with retaliation tarrifs and lower commodity prices, exacerbating financial strains within the agricultural community. (Reuters) Throw that into the fact your workforce has been incarcerated or are in hiding, and that face is going to need more than hog shit to cover the mauling.

So who else has been regretting not voting, or voting for Trump? Well probably a pretty big percentage of low-income earners which, when you check out the stats overall, is in the majority, people in red States.

Mississippi, a red state, poverty stands at 19.58%, making it the highest in the United States, while Louisiana, another red state, follows closely at 18.65%. In contrast, blue states like Massachusetts and New Jersey have significantly lower poverty rates of 8.5% and 8.2% (Visual Capitalist). 

And what goes along nicely with poverty? Medical issues. It's beautifully being played out in social media with so many rednecks saying that they're so glad Trump is going to get rid of Obamacare, but at least they'll still have the Affordable Care Act. As I write Trump has just recinded Biden's Executive Order lowering prescription drug prices under the ACA (Whitehouse.gov). 

What a choice now.... a carton of eggs or a half tablet of grannies heart medication? How fucking dumb do you have to be to vote yourself into medical bankruptcy or die because your too stupid to get past your exclusive Fox News consumption? You think Fucker Carlson ever gave a fuck about you? Maybe dig a little bit deeper to understand the nuances of things that you affect you and your kids before voting for your favourite orange thing.

Speaking of kids... You're going to be forced to have more, or just die whilst trying. Those state Republican legislatures are going to go full force in putting the lives of those unviable foetus' wellbeing above your daughter's, wife's or Mother's. Thanks Mitch and Trump for effectively stacking SCOTUS with Christian conservatives who overturned Roe. 

Already, sadly Trump voters have died. Examples such as Josseli Barnica of Texas, suffering a miscarriage and dying of sepsis due to having Trump enabled abortion laws, or Nicole Thurman dying after being denied timely abortion care due to the same laws. (ProPublica)

That shits gonna be on steroids now. Trump enabled southern states, are looking at wider travel bans for pregnant women, with Texas already having put restrictions on travel to obtain abortions out of state (AP News). I hope that red voting Daddy is gunna be happy, the meth head, that got his little girl up the stick, is gunna be hanging with him and Jr at Christmas. 

JD Vance, that guy that's going to be looking up at his two cybertruck chested daddies for the next 4 years, (the irony of this non nuclear family in the Whitehouse) has refrained from confirming or denying support for the right of pregnant women to leave the state for a termination of pregnancy (The independent). 

The University of Colorado Boulder projected that abortion bans could lead to a 24% increase in maternal mortality overall, with a 39% increase among non-Hispanic Black women. Also, a study by the Commonwealth Fund found that in 2020, maternal death rates were 62% higher in states with abortion restrictions compared to those with greater access (28.8 vs. 17.8 per 100,000 births). This disparity is expected to widen post-Roe, as more states enact restrictive laws. (Home)

Time to lock up those red state daughters! Oh.... That would suite many anyway, because that's what it is about. Controlling women, not protecting a foetus. 

That's quite obvious when you look at the stats for dumped newborns post those Trump enabled SCOTUS changes. In Texas, since RvW was overturned, there was a 12.9% rise in infant mortality against the 1.8% rise over the rest of the country (JAMA Network) and at least 18 babies were deserted in 2024 alone in Texas (Yahoo News).

That's the Southern GOP/MAGA for you. Anyone that breaths air, not amniotic fluid, that doesn't earn at least the median wage, need to get a hold of them boot straps and start saving for that rainy day. You're on your own. Yep even if you voted for them.

So many other beautiful leopard stories. What about those that voted for peace because Trump is all about peace?

You didn't like the fact Biden didn't come down hard on Netanyahu? Thought Good ol TBone will step up? Lolz... That shit got settled before Biden left office and if Trump says otherwise it's a violation of the Logan Act (it will never be fully settled btw) and your complacency in voting has lead us to this. Peace?

Step in ""America First"" AKA ""fuck the rest of the world"". Not even a ""If your not with us you're against us"". That's right. Melon and Trump have both been seeing a bit on the side. Putler, who happens to be at odds with the rest of the civilised world.

That's a whole nother story and not a leopards tale. Mainly because anyone that respected Global Rule of Law would have the sense not to vote red. They probably read something other than their twitter feed whilst on the shitter. Remember that thing that Reagan stood for? Standing up to tyranny. No more of that shit now its follow the cash. Trumps been Putlers lapdog since the 80s (http://themoscowproject.org).

So Biden's sanctions on Russia have bought them to their knees. Not down and out. Putler has been waiting for his money launderer to take over and save him. Smoke and mirrors time.

Trump has already suggested using military or economic power to force Denmark to hand over the island (Reuters) with the Kremlin's Dmitry Peskov already likening it to Russia taking Crimea (justification for Russia).  Then there's Panama. He doesn't like the price of passage and that the Chinese are operating a port nearby, so that in his eyes it gives him authority to invade the country. (AP News) 

Feeling peaceful yet?

What about Canada? Thought it was a joke? Watch this space. It won't happen but the rhetoric gives a glimpse of the level of power he's looking for. He's praised Putin, Xi Jing Ping, Kim Jong il and Orban, despite concerns for their democratic principals or human rights records (International Business Times). 

Again as I write, Mexican drug cartels are now terrorists according to him. Troops on Mexican soil next? Well they are heading to the border right?

If you were looking for peace, between starting trade wars, alienating Allies, supporting dictators, threatening military and economic annexation, yes your apathy or action has really made the world safer. Was Palestine your motivation for not voting blue? Watch this space and keep an eye out for those big cat spots.

And then there's the uneducated battler that just doesn't have the media savvy or is just too apethetic to look for more info. Cost of living? Price of eggs? Nice slight of hand you missed there. 

The promise to make things cheeper? Told you Biden is to blame for inflation? He would bring prices down? Then told Time magazine ""it's hard to bring things down once they are up"". Just remember that, in 4 years after the trade wars are in full swing.

Other Conservative outcry has been the prospective cabinet picks. 

Gaetz. The statutory rapist as investigated by his own party, being found to have paid an underage girl $400 for sex and attending drug fuelled parties, paid $90k in payments for sex and drugs, obstructed congress investigations and tried to influence witnesses and also accepted impermissible gifts (AP News). Yep the GOP stood up to their own on that, (for other reasons not the debauchery), but nope the Orangeutang wanted him as the countries top prosecutor, that is, until he fell on his own sword. 

No worries. Let's replace him with someone who he can trust. Pam Bondi his impeachment lawyer who, when questioned about birthright citizenship (of which Trump signed an EO on in the following week), she said she would have to go and research it (International Business Times). Ie I don't want to go against the boss so I'll play dumb or I just am unqualified?

Or what about those conservatives that are smacking their heads about the Antivaxer who is the head of Health, RFK?  Time for a reemergence of Polio? Or his desire to ban high fructose corn syrup? Those arse fucked farmers are going to be left wondering about that one too. 

Conservative veterans on the appointment of Pete Hegseth as Def Sec. Allegations of sexual assault (potentially a qualifying point) and alcohol abuse. But more importantly he was a fucking Major in the National Guard! (Wikipedia) What a qualification. Certainly a high flyer and exposed to international level politics there. Not.

Then there's another mate of Putin's. Tulsie Gubbard. Also of Bashar al-Assad. No intelligence community history but hey she's loyal, so let's put her as the Director of National Intelligence. Adapt at parroting Russian disinformation (PBS), so maybe that was an endearing qualification? Her, despite a group of nearly 100 former national security officials urging the senate to ""carefully scrutinise"" her nomination. (The Hill) Read... Don't do it.

Then there's DR OZ. The Medicare nom. Known for having promoted pseudoscience throughout his career. In 2015, a group of physicians called for his removal from the faculty at Columbia University, citing ""egregious lack of integrity"" in promoting ""quack treatments."" (Looper) Maybe all those red voters can augment their removal of Medicare and Medicaid benifits with his green bean coffee extract, whilst the leopards feast.

All up the net worth of his cabinet is estimated to be nearly $500 billion. Double the GDP of countries of Greece or Hungary. ""Oh BoTh siDEs aRe the SaMe"" other conservatives reply. No... Biden's cabinet was $118 billion. (US News). The world sees an oligarchy forming. Melon's GROK agrees.(GROK)

Then there's another Putin contact. The ketamine addled Musk who we covered earlier. Conflict of interest central, who is already meddling in European politics, with France, Germany, Scotland, Norway and Spainish politicians criticising him (Reuters) for his Lex Luthor attitude and obvious world domination ambitions. 

Speaking of conflict of interest. Even tik tok has sparked the ire of the leopard mauled conservatives. After Trump pushed for its divestment by executive order in August 2020, on national security grounds, the ban being passed by the house to be enforced by 19 Jan 2025. Trump has extended the deadline by 75 days whilst Chinese officials consider the sale to Muskovite himself. Boom. Another tennent of moving towards a facist dictatorship. Maximum control of the media. But from what I see online, the conservatives are mainly saying ban it already.

And still on Herr Musk... Another beautiful thing, is the wakeup call for the Conservatives on the concept of him being the ""free speech abolitionist"". The moment he took over Twitter the left were being blocked, shadow banned and demonetized. The right for years continued to talk of free speech. Nazism and bigotry became Twitter's future because of that free speech (of the right). He blocked your ability to block content from your own feed that you didn't like. The EU investigated his manipulation of far right party posts during elections. (Reuters). But for the Conservatives... It only becomes an issue when they are banned. And banned they have been now. 

The H-1B visas have pissed so many off, that they are coming out in droves. Take a sip from that cup of shut the fuck up he's told them. They don't like it. 

The potentially most significant tech hiccup came when tech streamer Asmongold called him out for cheating on Path of Exile 2.

Muskovite did a live stream of him playing PoE2 and despite having a high level and good kit was walking past valuable items seemingly oblivious of their value. Asmongold called him out for potentially account sharing or outsourcing advancement. Musk didn't like this and released private DMs with Asmongold in order to deligitimise him. This riled up the techheads. Notably not all potential leopard victims. Asmongold was highlighting this off the back of Melon bragging previously, as being one of the top Diablo gamers of which others thought suss also. (The verge) The tech bros are now pushing back and could that be a big part of his future downfall? 

Another thing the tech bros are livid online about is Trump and crypto. Fucking Musk and his manipulation with DOGE coin already, but it seems as usual, Trump in his Dunning Kruger perpetual state, has learnt about crypto... Great for money laundering it seems. So in a massive conflict of interest he launched the Trump Coin followed by the Melania Meme Coin. 

Crypto coins are really cheap to startup. Can be as low as $500 to get it underway. Then the speculative market takes over. This can be exploited with what they call a ""pump and dump"". Basically the initiators buy the initial coin en mass when worth nothing, then others jump on-board to buy their own and the price goes up. The initial investors make massive profits at the expense of others by dumping the bulk and dropping the price.

Trump dropped his coin on the market the day before inauguration. Confliiiiiict? 80% of the initial investors were Trump affiliated orgs. (Wired). Within hours of release the price surged to $75.35 from 18c. A $13 billion market capitalisation. (News). Former Trump Aide Scaramucci described it as ""corruption"".(Newsweek). Within a couple of days it's now trading at 95c.(Coin Geko). It looks like the master of grift has done it again. I'd put my left nut on the line, to say not one of those first 80% hold any coin at all, in any quantity. They took techbros money and ran.

This is where the tech bros offered a lovely face delicacy to the cat. The didn't vote it on them selves, they backed the super grifter with their own hard earned cash... And lost. So pretty to see.

So what else have the leopards been feeding on? Well the 200,000 supporters that forked out to travel to DC then to find it was to be moved in doors are more than a little miffed. After spending months complaining about the price of eggs, then forking out thousands of greenbacks to get there...  

Cited as a weather move indoors, MAGA pundits were left watching the oligarchs closest and newest supporters soaking up the indoor heat.

Weather? Maybe it was just that small crowd size fear again? It was cold... But not an unprecedented temp. Wind chill of 5¬∞F (-15¬∞c). Regan's outdoor event was wind chill of -10¬∞F (-23¬∞c). I think Trump was as afraid of the smallness just like Stormy was of his. 

Then there's the event organisers who still haven't been paid. They aren't posting but the memes and news reports out there are exposing the full grift that is DJT.(See attached).

All in all, new reasons to have ones face ripped off by a leopard are popping up every couple of hours it seems. We will really see the extent in the coming years. 

Some of us will be immune. Many all over the world won't. For those Americans that did the right thing it's a sad situation. For those that were apathetic or actively supporting the future racist you can get fucked. You suffered from arrogance or ignorance and neither are an excuse for what is now going to transpire.

I have not even touched a criticism of this oligarchy, if I were to do that, I would never finish it. The Moscow connection, the lies, the manipulations, the backstabbing and the childish thin skinned selfish self serving, narcissistic escapades would run on too long. 

I have picked a few reactions to the bait and switch, the media manipulation and the grift. 

We can only hope that democracy survives, peace and the global rule of law remains intact and another lesson is learnt not to be forgotten for a long time.

""The first truth is that the liberty of a democracy is not safe if the people tolerate the growth of private power to a point where it becomes stronger than their democratic state itself.""

I hope you all are well and safe. I want to share my little story. Yesterday I successfully passed the CCNA exam. How did it start? Well, on one gloomy March 2023 day, I was standing on the porch of the house where our squad lived during that period, smoking a cigarette and enjoying a hot cup of coffee. While sipping coffee my attention was drawn by a Starlink router and suddenly a thought came to me. How does the Internet work? So,  I started digging. While doing my research I often saw the abbreviation CCNA. So I googled what is it, and found out that there is even an IT speciality that‚Äôs called ‚Äúnetwork engineer‚Äù. And I decided to pursue that track. First, I started with Network+ materials, and went through them for a few months and in early June 2023 I started with CCNA studies. I combined multiple sources. First of all ‚Äì Jeremy‚Äôs IT Lab and his books (I read them in 2024). Jeremy‚Äôs labs as well as his Megalab (absolute mammoth). Also, I used CBTNuggets and their Adept. Great course. Keith is a great teacher. Passionate and know how to explain difficult concepts simply. Next resource. Boson. I used Boson Netsim. I find it great, but sometimes laggy. Before the exam, I went through Boson Exsim. Great training to brush up your knowledge before the actual examination. Also went through both Jeremy‚Äôs exams. They are great.

The exam itself I was passing online. Did not experience any issues or any word from the proctor. I started at 2 am as I didn‚Äôt have any other options. I was stressed, and tired as hell but somehow managed to successfully pass. Scored in most categories 80-90ish.

Strangely, but now I feel some numbness and emptiness inside me and a bit of happiness at the same time. Now I am preparing to start with Linux and Python. Yes, I know that the best is experience and finding a job but there is a small issue. I am a military servicemember and have no such option now. So I will continue with my studies and think of buying a server for CML and Eve-NG.

For those who study now. Believe in yourself, take your time and everything will be OK. Good luck, fellas.",8,1737538052.0,ccna,0,0.9,False

I‚Äôm also passionate about motorcycles and dream of exploring Europe on two wheels someday. Traveling feels like a grand adventure to me, and getting lost just adds more fun to the story.

The answer depends on several factors, including the type of coffee and how it‚Äôs stored.**

Coffee comes in various forms‚Äîwhole beans, ground coffee, and instant coffee. Each type has its own shelf life. Proper storage can extend the freshness of your coffee. Understanding how long coffee lasts can help you enjoy a better cup. In this blog, we will explore the shelf life of different types of coffee.

You‚Äôll learn how to store coffee to keep it fresh longer. This information can save you from drinking stale coffee and help you make the most of your favorite brew. Ready to find out how long your coffee can last? Let‚Äôs dive in.

# Freshness Factors

When discussing ‚ÄúHow Long Does Coffee Last,‚Äù understanding the¬†**Freshness Factors**¬†is crucial. These factors significantly influence the taste and aroma of your coffee. Two main elements that affect coffee freshness are the roast date and storage conditions. By paying attention to these, you can enjoy a better cup of coffee every time.

# Roast Date Impact

The roast date plays a vital role in determining¬†**coffee freshness**. Freshly roasted coffee beans are at their peak flavor and aroma. As soon as coffee is roasted, it begins to lose its freshness. Knowing the roast date can help you decide how fresh your coffee is.

Here are some¬†**effects of roasting on coffee**:

* **Initial Freshness:**¬†Coffee is at its best within a week of roasting.
* **Flavor Degradation:**¬†After two weeks, you may notice a decline in flavor.
* **Ground Coffee Longevity:**¬†Ground coffee loses its freshness faster than whole beans.

For the best experience, aim to use coffee within two weeks of its roast date. This period ensures you capture the full essence of the coffee. If you have¬†**whole bean coffee storage**, it can last a bit longer than ground coffee. Grind the beans just before brewing to maintain optimal flavor.

Here‚Äôs a quick reference table:

|Type|Best Before Date Coffee|
|:-|:-|
|Whole Bean Coffee|1-2 weeks after roast|
|Ground Coffee|1 week after grind|

Ending it on my birthday..","my entire life I have made to feel outcasted from my own family, age 5 my mom marries someone who turns out to be a pedophile and does stuff to me and forces me to do stuff to him and my cousins while he watches. this goes on from age 5 to 8.

he also would beat me so badly to where I could barely sit because it would hurt. this went on from age 5 to 17.

When I was 8 my cousins dad came over no other adults were around. he made us kids do things to each other for hours then left. we never told anyone.

My mom never believed me nor did my grandma or any one else in the family. I was always called a liar, trash, stupid, and many other words. growing up I barely learned how to read and could barely spell. everyone made fun of me growing up. 

I never went to school, was always kept home to work in the yard or to handmow 10 acres of land or work in the field we had.
When I was 17, my step dad killed my 80 year old grandma who had severe asthma, he sprayed a full can of bug spray in the kitchen causing her to have a severe asthma attack and died that night. he did it on purpose for the will.

when I was 18 I walked in on my step dad and my moms uncle together in her bed. I told her that night infront of everyone, he threw hot coffee in my face and then my mom kicked me out of the house.

My mom was always trying to end her life, I grew up spending weeks in and out of the hospital by her bedside from overdoses. 

Was homeless from age 18 to 35. no one would hire me.
Lost my mom when I was 25, my biological dad when I was 23, only knew him for a few months. 

Didn't learn to read or write until I was 18/19 and homeless. That is also when I learned I had dyslexia and minor brain damage from years of beatings from my step dad.

Fast forward to today after 30 years of abuse from my family. my aunts, my cousins and being outcasted by them for over 10 years. I am turning 44 monday and I can't keep living like this.

I was diagnosed with Cptsd, severe chronic depression, paranoia, severe social anxiety and suicidal ideation. I have no friends and go months with no one to talk to, i have no one to game with and I have no support from anyone. I owe 3 years of payments on 3 different credit cards and I am -180 in the bank and living on ssi. I can't keep going like this...

I have never had a girlfriend, women don't want me, I have never had a vehicle and I desperately need a minivan to help me get around to places. I had a crown break off and can't get to a dentist because of no dental insurance. I was never taught dental hygiene growing up and now I need all of my teeth pulled and dentures but cannot afford it.

I live in a very small town in texas that is 30 miles away from anything and have to doordash everything which costs so much. 

I can't keep living like this and being completely alone all of the time. So I am ending it on my birthday on the 27th.",4,1737536586.0,SuicideWatch,2,1.0,False

If you have please tell me your experience, I can‚Äôt find much from people who actually have this implant","Recently one of the doctors I see has been suggesting this as option due to nothing else helping. The majority of my pain is from not being able to void my bladder properly and my bladder thinking there is urine inside when there is very little inside. I‚Äôve been taking oral medications and doing bladder instillations for the past 8 months with little to no improvement. I have had several pelvic exams that showed minor pelvic floor dysfunction. After seeing a PT for a few months they told
me I didn‚Äôt need to come anymore because the floor dysfunction was so small it couldn‚Äôt be causing the pain. The therapy a did improved my pelvic floor function but not the pain. The only thing that gets the pain low enough to sleep is tramadol, seroquel, and valium vaginal suppositories. I take the seroquel for mental health and not as a pain management it just makes me more tired. I take diclofenac sodium 50mg 2-3 times a day, baclofen 5mg 3 times a day, hydroxyzine 10-20mg 4 times a day, lyrica 100mg 4 times a day, the max dose of ibuprofen and tylenol throughout the day, and up to 75mg of tramadol at night. I also use valium 10mg vaginal suppository either whole or cut in two once to twice a day. At my clinic around every other week I get bladder instillations. The medication used are heparin, gentamicin, and bupivacaine. I can‚Äôt remember the doses. I think these work? They seem to do best with a consistent schedule but the clinic sees a ton of patients and doesn‚Äôt only have 3 nurse appointments open. My doctors are trying to get insurance to pay to have it prescribed for pick up so I can just do the bladder instillations biweekly at home. I already use catheters 3-10 times a day depending on my bladder functionally that day. Even will everything I just listed, I am in too much pain to work like I used to so I am barely paying to bills with the hours I‚Äôm managing to actually work. I don‚Äôt leave my house except to work because I need to lay down every hour with a heat mat most days. It‚Äôs a near constant 6‚Äì7/10 of pain, and flare ups with pain so extreme I can do nothing but cry. I eat a full IC diet, I used to be a  big coffee drinker, even had my own espresso machine, but I haven‚Äôt had any coffee or caffeine since my symptoms started about a year ago. If you‚Äôve had this surgery and it helped you have better bladder function please let me know. I‚Äôm scared about getting an implant but because nothing else is working I‚Äôm willing to do it. It‚Äôs not marketed for pain but instead bladder retention and incontinence, but it seems to improve some patients pain as well. ",2,1737536367.0,Interstitialcystitis,2,1.0,False

Today, we had lunch, went to a game store, and to a lounge/coffee shop.  The conversation was laid back & lighthearted.

1i76te1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i76te1/i_wish_i_had_never_eaten_at_this_diner/,I wish I had never eaten at this diner.,"I was driving down a desolate road in the middle of nowhere, coming home from a two-day business trip. I was starving; it was 1 PM, and I'd been on the road since 6 AM. I figured I wouldn't find anything to eat for the next 50 miles or so, but to my shock, something appeared in front of me. It seemed like a hallucination when first seen, but as I was walking closer, I found that it was an old-fashioned diner, and the sign hanging outside read ""Haven's Diner"" with very faint neon glow in a dense fog that was swallowing the endless road.



Inside, it was quiet but for the very faint hum of a jukebox playing some tune I almost recognized. The smell of burnt coffee and grease hit my nostrils, but I sensed something else, a metallic tang that I couldn't place. The place was deserted save for a waitress stationed by the counter with a smile a little too wide and eyes nailed to me like she had been waiting for me.



I slipped into a booth by the window, and just as I hadn't yet bothered to request the menu, a waitress came by, set down the steaming plate before me, and walked off again. Staring at that food in revulsion made my stomach roll up. It was mom's meatloaf recipe‚Äîovercooked edges, an exact shade of gravy, to the point she hadn't prepared that dish for over ten years, since her death.



""How did you know‚Ä¶"" I began to ask, but the words caught in my throat. The waitress merely cocked her head, still smiling, and headed back to the counter without a word.



I should have left right then. I was too hungry, too tired, and something about the smell of that meatloaf drew me, filling me with a bittersweet nostalgia I couldn't fight. I picked up the fork and took a bite. It was perfect, just like I remembered it from when I was a kid. But as I chewed, a strange sensation crept over me, like I was being watched by someone I couldn't see. The hair on the back of my neck stood up, and I glanced around the diner. It was still empty, except for the waitress, who now stood completely still, her back turned to me.



That‚Äôs when I noticed the clock above the counter. It was stuck at 3:33, the second hand twitching but never moving forward. My appetite vanished, replaced by a cold knot of unease in my stomach. I stood up, leaving the half-eaten plate on the table, and headed for the door.



Leaving so soon?"" a voice said behind me. It wasn't the waitress. It was a man's voice, low and raspy, like he'd smoked a pack a day for years. I turned around, but no one was there. The booth where I had been sitting was empty, the plate of meatloaf gone.



I ran for the door, my heart pounding in my chest, and flung it open. Outside, the fog was thicker than before, pressing against my skin like a damp shroud. My car was gone. In its place stood another sign, smaller than the one out front. It read:



""You're always welcome at Haven's Diner. See you soon.""



I started walking, hoping to find the road, another car, anything. But no matter how far I went, I ended up back in front of that damned diner. And each time I returned, the same plate of meatloaf was waiting for me, steaming hot and just the way Mom used to make it.



I don‚Äôt know how long I‚Äôve been here. Days? Weeks? The clock inside still says 3:33. The waitress still smiles that too-wide smile. And the jukebox keeps playing that almost-familiar song on a loop. I can‚Äôt leave, and I‚Äôm afraid to eat again. But sooner or later, I know I‚Äôll give in. The smell of that meatloaf is stronger now, and my hunger is growing.



If you ever pass a Haven's Diner along the side of the road, keep going. No matter how hungry you are. No matter how tired. Just go.

One place was more fancy and high-tech. They said I‚Äôd have to get jaw surgery if I wanted to achieve the results I wanted, which is a better profile. I feel like I have bimaxillary protrusion. And they said only jaw surgery can fix that. But if I‚Äôm trying to avoid jaw surgery, which I am, then the most they can do is pull my upper teeth backward while pulling my lower teeth forward, to minimize the overjet and protrusion. They said they could expand my arches a bit too. If I go with them, the cost for the braces would be about $8000. The technology seems really advanced here, the staff is very nice, but I did get a bit of snooty vibe from all of them. They weren‚Äôt outright mean. They were still very nice and professional.

I ended up crying because I was feeling kind of defeated that it seems the only solution to my problem would be jaw surgery on top of the fact like I felt like they were kind of getting annoyed when I kept asking about other possible options. The technician girl felt bad for me and even made suggestions about getting filler or Botox so that I could avoid jaw surgery. So that was nice of her. They have a program where if I pay an extra $500-700, I can get lifetime replacements for retainers for $100 each time. 

Second orthodontist I went to was more family-friendly. Inside looked like a clinic mostly for children. Staff were friendly and kind, like kindergarten teachers. They offered free coffee, tea, and water. And bake cookies in-house for patients. Their technology wasn‚Äôt as fancy as the first place. The doctor here also said that I would need jaw surgery to get the results I wanted. She also told me I had a few other options if I was looking to avoid jaw surgery. One was to extract 4 teeth to make room to pull my overjet back. Another was to use IPR to file down some teeth by as much as 0.5mm to make room to pull teeth back. Another was to wear rubberbands. And last was to get jaw surgery. Cost here is about $6000. They also have a program for retainers, and if I pay about $700, I can get free retainers for 10 years. The doctor seemed very busy and didn‚Äôt have time to sit down and talk to me. She was standing on the side the entire time, and I was facing the technician taking the notes the entire time, because the doctor needed to go back and forth between other patients that were there. I felt a bit rushed when talking about my problem, and didn‚Äôt feel like I was talking to the doctor one-on-one. But overall, they were all very nice. I think this place has multiple locations too. So it seems like a franchise or something. 


I guess I just wanna know, how do you choose which orthodontist to go with? Do you go with the place that‚Äôs more modern and high-tech? Or a place where they have standard basic orthodontic equipment? Do you go with whoever is cheaper? Do you go by the customer service? Location? 

How should I choose who to go with? Who would you choose? Or should I just try consulting with another orthodontist?

1i76m10,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1i76m10/sour_taste_meal_advice/,Sour taste meal advice,"Hello fellow GERDers, 

I would like to have some advice from you regarding the diet. 
I am having a strong sour taste in my mouth after I eat and the taste stays there for a very ling time. If my stomach is really empty the taste is bearable but still there. My gastroscopy was clean. I am waiting for the manometry / pH impedence test. 
I am already sleeping in an incline. This is going on since 10 weeks now and I think the culprit is a new migraine medication (Nurtec/rimegepant) that I have stopped 7 weeks ago.  
I am slowly finding my safer foods. I would like to know your safe foods, so that I can vary my diet a little bit. 
So far salad, tuna salmon and boiled vegetables seems the least triggering foods. 
I think oatmeal and quinoa may trigeer some sour taste but bearable. Coffee somehow is not increasing it. 
Do you think oatmeal quinoa to be trigger foods and if yes, what would you suggest as breakfast. (I always found eggs to be hard on my stomach). Could you advise me on high fiber foods I should try) 
Also is bran a trigger? 

PS. I cant take PPIs due to them being a migraine trigger for me and H2 antagonists are not helping at all. So I will have to solve this with diet only. 
Thank you very much. ",1,1737534577.0,GERD,0,1.0,False

Let‚Äôs face it‚Äîgetting customers to leave Google reviews can feel like trying to teach a cat to fetch. You know it‚Äôs possible, but is it really worth the effort? The answer is a resounding yes! In fact, Google reviews are like the bacon bits of the business world‚Äîsmall, but they pack a punch! Today, we‚Äôre diving into the burning questions businesses have about Google Review Stands, Cards, and Stickers, so buckle up and grab your coffee.

1. What Are Google Review Stands, Cards, and Stickers?

Think of these tools as your ultimate review ninjas. Google Review Stands are sleek, NFC- or QR-enabled devices (sometimes just a fancy card or a fun sticker) that take the ‚Äúugh‚Äù out of leaving reviews. Customers tap or scan, and BOOM‚Äîthey‚Äôre on your Google review page faster than you can say, ‚ÄúFive-star rating, please!‚Äù

Gone are the days of awkwardly begging your customers to ‚Äúlook us up on Google, please.‚Äù These tools do the heavy lifting so you can focus on what you do best: running your business and pretending you love paperwork.

2. How Do Google Review Tools Help My Business Grow?

Here‚Äôs the deal: Google reviews are the holy grail of local SEO. The more high-quality reviews you have, the more Google loves you. And when Google loves you, it shows your business to more people. It‚Äôs like being the teacher‚Äôs pet, except this time, you actually benefit from it.

Reviews boost your local rankings, build trust, and make you look like the Beyonc√© of your industry (minus the backup dancers). So yes, these tools can help your business grow by turning happy customers into five-star review machines.

3. Are Google Review Stands Easy to Use?

Absolutely! If you can use a light switch or open a bag of chips, you can use these tools. They‚Äôre designed to be as simple as possible because let‚Äôs be honest‚Äîno one has time to troubleshoot a review stand.

Customers simply tap their phone or scan a QR code, and they‚Äôre whisked away to your Google review page. It‚Äôs faster than your morning coffee order at a drive-thru.

4. Do I Need Technical Skills to Set Up Google Review Stands?

Spoiler alert: No, you don‚Äôt! If you‚Äôre worried that setting up one of these stands will require coding, wiring, or summoning an IT wizard, don‚Äôt be. These tools are plug-and-play.

Just place the stand or sticker where your customers can see it, and you‚Äôre done. It‚Äôs so easy, even your tech-averse uncle (you know, the one who still prints out emails) could handle it.

5. What‚Äôs the Difference Between QR Codes and NFC-Enabled Tools?

Ah, the age-old battle between QR codes and NFC. Think of QR codes as the extroverts of the tech world‚Äîthey‚Äôre flashy, they‚Äôre everywhere, and everyone knows how to use them. NFC (Near-Field Communication), on the other hand, is like the cool introvert. It‚Äôs subtle but incredibly effective.

With QR codes, customers scan the code using their phone‚Äôs camera. NFC tools work like Apple Pay‚Äîjust a quick tap, and they‚Äôre on your review page. Both are great, but NFC feels a bit fancier, like the caviar of review tools.

6. How Much Do Google Review Stands Cost?

Let‚Äôs talk money, honey. These tools typically come with a one-time cost, meaning you don‚Äôt have to deal with sneaky monthly subscriptions (looking at you, streaming services). Prices can range from ‚Äúa fancy latte‚Äù to ‚Äúa nice dinner out,‚Äù depending on how customizable or high-tech you want them to be.

The best part? You‚Äôll probably make back your investment faster than you can say, ‚ÄúAlexa, add Google Review Stand to my shopping cart.‚Äù

7. Can Google Review Tools Be Customized for My Business?

Oh, absolutely! Most of these tools can be customized with your logo, brand colors, and text that screams, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre awesome, and you should tell the world!‚Äù It‚Äôs like giving your business card a glow-up.

Whether you run a bakery or a barber shop, customization makes your review tools feel personal and professional‚Äîkind of like the tuxedo version of marketing.

8. Are Google Review Tools Compatible with All Smartphones?

Yes, they are! Whether your customers are rocking the latest iPhone, an old Android, or some phone you didn‚Äôt even know existed, these tools are universal. NFC works with most modern phones, and QR codes work with basically any device that has a camera.

So no excuses, Karen. Your flip phone isn‚Äôt an obstacle anymore.

9. Will Google Penalize Me for Using These Tools?

As long as you‚Äôre following Google‚Äôs guidelines, you‚Äôre golden. These tools make the review process easier but don‚Äôt manipulate or incentivize customers to leave fake reviews. And that‚Äôs key.

Speaking of fake reviews, don‚Äôt even think about buying them. Google‚Äôs algorithm is like a hawk‚Äîit‚Äôll sniff out those fake reviews, remove them, and slap your business with a ranking penalty. Trust me, it‚Äôs not worth the drama.

10. Where Can I Buy High-Quality Google Review Stands, Cards, and Stickers?

Drumroll, please‚Ä¶ You can grab the best Google Review tools over at taprocard.com. They‚Äôve got everything you need to turn your happy customers into raving fans with zero hassle.

In Conclusion: Why Google Review Stands Are a Game-Changer

Google reviews are the MVP of online business growth. Whether you‚Äôre a mom-and-pop shop or a growing franchise, these tools make it ridiculously easy for customers to leave reviews‚Äîwithout the awkward ‚ÄúHey, can you do us a favor?‚Äù conversations.

So what are you waiting for? Grab a Google Review Stand, Card, or Sticker, and watch your business reviews soar like a majestic eagle (or at least a really ambitious pigeon). Your customers‚Äîand Google‚Äôs algorithm‚Äîwill thank you.",1,1737534532.0,GoogleReviewCards,0,1.0,False

1i76im7,https://www.reddit.com/r/McDonaldsEmployees/comments/1i76im7/i_do_not_recommend_working_at_low_income_areas/,I do not recommend working at low income areas. Here is a long list of exactly why (Usa),"Getting pissed off. Worked at McDonald‚Äôs for about 4 years now. During that time the ice machine for the drink machine has worked for 2 month‚Äôs collectively. The same thing with the ice machine in the lobby‚Äôs left drink machine. 

Also the system we take orders on gets slower and slower and no matter how many times I explain exactly why to management they just shrug there shoulders and do nothing about it. All the monitors in the store run off a 13 year old computer that has never been turned off since it was installed. They crash and delete orders semi regularly. 

Order trackers indicating the amount of cars around our building keep shutting off

Obviously the exploding coffee machine. Fun thing about that, we don‚Äôt have hot chocolate, right?

Guess again, management popped down to the local Walmart and got Swiss miss packets. They‚Äôre saying mix it with water. 

Frappe machine has one functioning blender but we always get orders with like 2 frappes and 4 smoothies. 

The whole coffee machine is fucked. Not only does it not heat any coffee, despite the fact we don‚Äôt even have decaf, management still makes us sell it.

The drink machine shuts down every 30 seconds and when it does it pings every connected computer, which as I already established, is all the monitors for order taking are on one computer. 

Kiosks for self order are starting to glitch, and hardly even give receipts even with a full receipt machine. 

Ice cream machine. Which might I remind you, the express and sole purpose of an icecream machine is to make icecream always has low pressure until you put it in stop mode and back into start. There is a 1/100 chance this causes it to erupt with icecream with the power of a small hand grenade. I‚Äôve personally had cone‚Äôs disintegrate in my hands and had cups shot into the floor, as well as been showered in the stuff

Not to mention on the ice cream, the milkshake button can‚Äôt decide if I have to hit it with the power of a full punch to make the button read that I‚Äôm pressing it, or sometimes, just walking by it causes it to dispense the shake all over the ground.

Pipes are leaky

Freezer drawers won‚Äôt open

Freezers also won‚Äôt freeze

One time my headset wouldn‚Äôt mute my mic after going green (fucking terrifying if you say something bad)

The drink dispenser for drive thru seems to think the cups are still there and won‚Äôt rotate the cups around or make new drinks even after cleaning the sensor

Food gets sent to the void and never gets to the kitchen occasionally 

Multiple times my computer has frozen while I‚Äôm in drive thru cash out and when I press the icon to load an order again it just cashes the order out for 50 dollars because the second my finger made contact with the screen it loads

One time drive thru went down because we didn‚Äôt have the menus with the speakers and microphones working. We checked all our fuze boxes and nothing was flipped. We called in our tech and this is how the interaction went.

‚ÄúIdk it just won‚Äôt work‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you check the fuze box‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah nothin flipped‚Äù 

(She proceeds to walk into a completely hidden box in a different room and opens it)
‚ÄúYeah it flipped‚Äù

(Mind you this poor woman had just pulled a 12 hour shift and had to wake up and come here for this) 

Mobile orders apparently have two versions of the store and only one of them fucking works. One says north (example) highway the other says south (example) highway. Only the south one works. Both list the exact city and the only other one on the road isn‚Äôt in our city. 

Restock is always late without fail and they either give us more stuff than we have room for or such a comically little amount of stock you‚Äôd think they hate us

Tweakers are always shitting or pissing anywhere in the bathroom except the toilets, and sometimes it‚Äôs the wrong toilet (shit in the urinals. Guess who delt with that)

Every sink inside the back either doesn‚Äôt turn on, doesn‚Äôt turn off, or turns on for exactly a forth of a second and turns back off.

They manage to employ some people lacking any common sense. One of the new hires leaned full arm on a grill and I never saw him again. How do you forget a grill is a grill??

Despite Mexican immigrants being some of the friendliest and highest paying customers, half of my coworkers blame them, usually throwing a racist term into a nonexistent complaint.

I once had somebody ask ‚Äúhow much a 5 dollar meal is‚Äù

I have more. Way too much more. You‚Äôd think I‚Äôm exaggerating or coming up with this.

1i76fz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/deepnightsociety/comments/1i76fz6/in_for_a_penny/,In for a Penny,"In for a pound. That was Reg‚Äôs motto. You had to finish what you started. Otherwise, what was the point? He always tried to see things through and regretted it when he didn‚Äôt. He had gone to school to study law and halfway through the first year had realised it wasn‚Äôt for him. The sticking point was having to represent someone you knew was guilty. All the best lawyers could do it but he knew deep down he wouldn‚Äôt be able to.¬†

Still he had stuck it out for the four years and got his degree. He had made friends he still had today and he had enough legal knowledge that when he was unfairly dismissed from the insurance firm he worked for, he was able to represent himself. He won the case and saved a bundle in legal fees.

He had stayed married to Dolores, his first wife, even after the relationship went sour. They had two kids together. Tom and Diane. A kid is an 18 year commitment but the rot in their relationship started to set in after 8. She would snipe at him, even insulting him in front of their children. He knew any love between them was gone.¬†

But being a Dad wasn‚Äôt a job you could quit so he stayed for another 10. Dolores was vindictive and he was more than sure that if he had divorced her, she would have taken the kids just to hurt him and he wouldn‚Äôt have seen hide nor hair of them in their teens. And those times, though turbulent, he wouldn‚Äôt trade for anything.

He even watched Game of Thrones to the end. That wasn‚Äôt easy. Then at a role-playing convention, he had trauma bonded with another fan who had suffered through the finale. That fan, Lucy, later became his partner. She was a great person and he loved her more than he could articulate. Life kept teaching him that it was good to see things through. In for a penny, in for a pound.

Maybe it was curiosity that made him stay to the end. He remembered a book he had read. The Incredible Shrinking Man by Richard Matheson. He wasn‚Äôt really enjoying it. It was a depressing tale about a man who is exposed to a gas that makes him shrink and shrink.

His wife forgets about him and keeps him in the basement. On his shrinking journey he has a brief romance with a little woman from a visiting circus but he shrinks past her too. In the basement he gets so small that he has to fight for his life against spiders, using a pencil as a spear.¬†

Things looked bleak. Every time he went to sleep he would wake up smaller again. He was now miniscule and thought this night would be his last. But this time when he wakes up he has passed over to the subatomic realm where an exciting new frontier of adventure awaits.

Reg was glad he had kept reading to the end.

The philosophy of seeing things through had served him well in his 45 years but Reg‚Äôs brother Pat was a different story. Pat never finished anything. He dropped out of his English degree because the other students were too pretentious. He quit his job as a tour guide because his boss was an asshole. Reg tried to tell him, most bosses are assholes but it didn‚Äôt seem to matter. You put up with it, you do impressions of them in the break room, then you go home and put work behind you.

Reg had watched Pat break it off with girlfriend after girlfriend for the flimsiest of reasons. This one wasn‚Äôt funny enough, or smart enough. They had too many ‚Äúred flags‚Äù but to Reg the flags looked pink. The same kind of little flaws everyone had.¬†

One lady, who he knew Pat regretted dumping. Her name was Alice. She was gorgeous, kind and great craic. However, she was always about 20 minutes late. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the big deal?‚Äù Reg had asked his brother. ‚ÄúJust read a book, go on your phone.‚Äù But no, she was imperfect so she had to go.

After all the quitting and dropping out, Pat ended up without much of a life to show for it. No family, no job, and only one friend, Reg himself. Finally he had done the ultimate dropping out, ending his life at the age of 43.¬†

Amidst the maelstrom of grief, Reg kept coming back to the same question. Why kill yourself at 43 when 44 could be the year it finally all came together? Why walk out of the movie before the third act?

Reg missed him. He was a dour man, sure, but once he was done talking about his own problems he was a pretty good listener. He was also a great guy to watch a crappy dumb movie with.¬†

Not long after Pat did what he did, a publishing company got in touch, they wanted to publish one of his poems.With Reg‚Äôs help it was published posthumously. You just didn‚Äôt know what was around the corner.

It was a Sunday and Reg had nothing on. He intended today to be nice and relaxing. Lucy was out with her friends, at the Korean place in town. She was with her three besties and he knew they would eat Gochujang, and stay for hours, having drinks and catching each other up.¬†

He had the place to himself for the next few hours and he knew exactly what he would do. Listen to podcasts and finish his lego Death Star. He adored Lucy but it was nice to have some time to reflect on the week.

He had everything set up and ready to go when he hit a snag. Literally, there was something snagging on his cardigan sleeve. He carefully rolled back his sleeve and found the culprit, it was a hangnail, protruding from the left side of his left thumb. Irritating but nothing he couldn‚Äôt deal with.¬†

He had a system. He would fill a small dish with warm water and soak the nail to soften it. Then taking his trusty tweezers, he‚Äôd rip the bugger out. He prepared his surgical bay, placing the dish and tweezer on the arm of the couch. The whole thing shouldn‚Äôt take more than a few minutes, and soon he would be in his lego happy place.

His phone connected to a bluetooth speaker and the familiar jingle of the podcast intro rang out. It was his favourite, Pod People. It was dedicated to the dark side of life. True crime, cults, conspiracies and the like.¬†

This episode was dedicated to the terrifying case of Josef Frizel, who kept his daughter locked in a basement for 24 years, where he raped her and fathered children with her. He felt a twinge of guilt at listening to something like that but reassured himself that he wasn‚Äôt the only one, or the podcast wouldn‚Äôt be popular.

The hosts were two American friends, one Christian and the other into death metal. They had a running gag where the wholesome one would accuse the other of getting off on the macabre stories. Listening to it felt like being in the same room with some good friends.¬†

He set a timer on his watch and soaked his thumb, removing it after 2 minutes. He took the tweezers, the same ones he used to pluck his unibrow, and gripped the extruding end of the hangnail.

He winced at the pain he knew was coming. But it was necessary. A hangnail would seriously affect his dexterity when it came to building the movie accurate exhaust channels of the Death Star. The errant keratin would have to go.¬†

He braced himself and pulled. He felt the expected pain, saw the expected blood, but felt none of the expected relief. Dabbing away the blood he saw the hangnail was still attached, now jutting from the joint in his thumb. He paused, his mind working. This was a turn up for the books. He had never known a hangnail to extend this far and he examined it with fresh curiosity.

How was it even possible? Wasn‚Äôt the soil of a hangnail, so to speak, the nail bed? Could this be growing from some place deeper? The bone maybe? Thoughts of soil turned his attention to his garden. He looked out the living room window which gave a view of the back garden.¬†

It was a modest 5 by 7 metres with a small tool shed. He took particular pride in his roses. Scarlet Carsons. They were sleeping right now but he looked forward to spring when they would break free with their customary bold shade of red.

He wanted to turn his attention to happy things, lego, the garden, maybe a nice cup of tea, but the hangnail was now hogging all of it. The laughter of the podcast hosts grated on him and he realised he would not be able to really relax until He dealt with it.¬†

It was a hangnail, just a particularly long one, so the solution was the same, pull it out. It would be a funny story to tell Lucy when she got home. Perhaps he would even keep it and show it to her, though that would be cruel, as she didn‚Äôt like ghastly things.

He took the tweezers and started to pull. It was deeper than he expected and felt like ripping a cable from underground. All he could do was keep pulling, in a continuous motion, hoping that at any moment it would be torn free. He watched in confused horror as it kept going....showing no signs of reaching an end. Feeling light-headed and needing a break from the pain and exertion, he stopped, although the sought for relief was nowhere, the thing was still attached.

This was becoming...unacceptable. He felt sadness as he felt the prospect of an easy Sunday slipping away. The hangnail now emerged from the base of his thumb, at the place where his thumb met his hand. It was almost two inches in length. At a loss he decided to google it. Using one hand to work his phone while the other awaited its fate.

Google offered no salvation. People had hangnails that had to be surgically removed. There was also something called bone slivers but they only happened in serious accidents where the bone was shattered. He looked at the pictures with morbid fascination. They were horrifying but didn‚Äôt look like what was happening to him.¬†

While on the phone he got distracted and bought a book he didn‚Äôt need. He knew he was procrastinating and he had to deal with this before he coud return to his life.¬†

He grabbed the hangnail, it was long enough now that he didn‚Äôt need the tweezers and could use his other hand, and began to pull. The pain was...intimate. He felt like a robot that had gone crazy and was pulling out its own wires.¬†

The podcast hosts started to advertise a health drink. He didn‚Äôt want to let go of the nail so he couldn‚Äôt skip it which added to his torture. He had seen the drink on YouTube, it was green and looked like something you would give a sick cow.

He had to stop again and when he did the hangnail (if it could still be called that) was sticking out of his wrist. Just above the strap of his casio digital watch, which he removed. To his amazement he realised that he would actually have to remove his shirt as it still wasn‚Äôt over.¬†

He had to drag the sleeve over the hangnail and his fresh wound, causing a cruel jolt of pain. He threw the shirt aside. There was a wellspring of blood and the paper towel couldn‚Äôt cope, it was completely red with blood except for one white corner. He would need a towel.

He went to the hot press to get one. On the way he left red spots where his blood dropped on the living room carpet. He would be in trouble when Lucy found them. He found a white and red tea towel and wrapped it around his arm.¬†

He noticed how calm he was being but he knew he was like that, anxious most of the time but calm when the shit hit the fan. He sat back down on the couch, holding his hand in the towel like he was afraid it would fall off. The absurdity of the whole thing made him laugh.

He cleaned up the blood as best he could then used the towel to get extra purchase on the nail. In for a penny in for a pound. He started a new round of pulling. The uprooted nail dug a trench down his arm as he pulled it out. He screamed from the pain, which was like hot needles driven though his bone. He had to keep screaming to keep going.¬†

He wondered if the neighbours could hear. Norris, the man living next door, was a retired doctor. Rationally he knew he should be seeking medical help. Maybe it was some macho programming but he just wanted to take care of the nail himself without getting anyone else involved. The nail was now almost at the joint of his elbow, he could wrap it around his right hand to get a good grip. Doing so made him gag.

He took a second to rest and breath deeply. The thing was now almost at his shoulder. He could see the carnage he was wreaking on himself but he resisted his mind‚Äôs attempts to comprehend it, knowing it would probably steal all his conviction. Every single inch had been hard won, like ground in World War 1. With destroyed flesh the casualties.

He tried to pull again but this time the pain far outweighed any progress. He shifted it maybe a millimetre and was rewarded with an artillery shell of pain that hit his shoulder but sent shrapnel everywhere else. It also blasted away his resolve.¬†

I just need a second, he thought and leaned over face down on the couch. His nose was pressed against the cushion and he could smell the smell of the house. There was a faint hint of the curry he and Lucy had had last night.

Thinking of Lucy cut even deeper and he produced a little sob. When crying he never managed to get out more of a sob or two before something stopped him. That macho programming again. He‚Äôd give anything to be in her arms. Telling her about this rather than actually going through it. He thought of her coming home and finding him in this posture of defeat, and he hated it so he sat up.

Thoughts of defeat led to thoughts of capitulation. Maybe he and the nail could co-exist. He could cut it off at the shoulder, keep it covered under clothes and trim it every now and then. Maybe it wouldn‚Äôt be so bad.¬†

No, he drove out the thoughts. He couldn‚Äôt trust the nail. What if it wasn‚Äôt content with his flesh? What if one night as he slept it inched its way towards Lucy, searching for new lands to colonise. No, no peace. There was only room in his body for one of them.

His brain tuned back into the podcast. They were aughing at what that woman had gone through. How could they? He thought. Didn‚Äôt they know people were suffering?! Still he didn‚Äôt turn it off. Somehow he thought the silence would be worse. Just then he got the notion that running his arm under a cold tap would do the world of good, would cure him in fact.

He went into the kitchen and placed his arm under the tap. He looked at the water because he couldn‚Äôt bring himself to look at his arm. It ran red for much longer than he would have liked. He didn‚Äôt like that he was being afraid so he forced himself to look. What he saw made him throw up. It looked like he had shaken hands with a combine harvester.

He stood by the sink, the tap still running, washing away a rancid cocktail of vomit and blood. the taste of vomit in his mouth. It felt good to get it out of him but he knew he‚Äôd never feel right again until he got *it* out of him.

How long had it been in him, he wondered. Reg had always had a bad constitution, getting sick every flu season, tiring easily. Was it because this stowaway was there all along, taking the nutrients that were rightfully his to fuel its abominable growth?¬†

Reg‚Äôs curiosity was enflamed. How far did the thing go? He would find out, even if it killed him. He turned off the tap and dried himself with a mostly clean tea towel. The one he had gotten previously lay on the counter, soaked with blood and useless. He hated to think about how much flesh he had lost and how much more he would lose before the day was over.

To ensure victory he would need better weaponry. His thoughts turned to the garden shed where he kept his DIY stuff. His mind was filled with images from an old movie. In it the character loses his hand, then goes to the toolshed and with a few adjustments transforms himself into a killing machine with a chainsaw for a hand. He thought a chainsaw would be overkill but he still liked the imagery.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got a big surprise coming to you‚Äù he said to the hangnail. It was approaching 2 feet in length. It had a stiffness to it and bobbed alongside his arm like a sinister erection. Just looking at it made his stomach lurch. He went to the backdoor and put on his coat and boots to go outside.¬†

Blood from his arm stuck to the lining inside the coat and the numbness in his left hand made lacing his boots difficult. It overcast outside, Mid-December in Ireland. Despite human attempts to derail it, Nature was keeping to her schedule and had made it chilly.

On his way to the shed he stopped by the rosebed. There was nothing to see and he wondered if he‚Äôd be alive to see his beloved roses bloom. He opened the door to the shed, or armory as he thought of it. He took his red toolbox from a shelf and placed it on the worktop. He rummaged around for the pliers, feeling a sadistic pleasure thinking of what he could do to the hangnail.

Then his eyes landed on something that stopped him searching and made him grin. In the centre of the worktop was a vice. What better tool to hold the damned thing in place while he ripped it out of him.

Knowing he would lose his nerve if he hesitated he guided the hangnail into the jaws of the vice and turned the wheel. The nail was thin so he had to turn the wheel all the way to clamp it in place.¬†

He realised the best thing to do was to sling the hangnail over his shoulder and turn away from the vice. That way when he moved forward he could rip it out. The shed was small and he was able to reach out and get the fingers of his right hand around the door handle. He was glad at how secure it felt.

He was atheist except for the most dire occasions and he mentally whispered a prayer. ‚ÄúPlease God, let most of me be intact.‚ÄùHe pulled himself forward. The nail bit into him and scared it might re-enter him that way he found an old sheet used for painting, folded it into a kind of belt and placed it under the nail.¬†

He dragged himself forward again. It felt unnatural to cause himself so much pain, like asking a maniac to stab him in the chest.

Gouts of blood splashed onto the ground. With the nail slung over his shoulder he was reminded of the Strongman competitions he used to watch with his father and brother when he was a boy. He didn‚Äôt care much for sports but they had enough of the freak show to be fun. He thought now of those mountains of men, dragging train cars behind them. In their teeth he seemed to remember but that couldn‚Äôt be right.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm weak, I can‚Äôt do it, I‚Äôm weak, I can‚Äôt do it.‚Äù He thought. Yet he was doing it. His mind was useless in this situation. It was only his will that mattered. He assessed the damage, there was a meaty canyon extending from his shoulder to his left nipple. He couldn‚Äôt actually see his nipple which might have been in laying with the blood on the ground. Oh well, he thought, I wasn‚Äôt using it anyway. The nail looked stronger than ever, its base an inch across and slightly concave. It had some nerve, acting like it was a normal part of his anatomy!

It was obvious where the final showdown would be. His heart. The soil where it gorged itself on his blood. Its roots like a cage around his heart.¬†

He kept pulling forward. It was like the nail was bonded to him at the molecular level and ripping it out split the atom, triggering atomic explosions of pain. He kept pulling himself forward. In for a penny...

His consciousness wavered and he held onto the door handle as much to keep himself awake as upright. His body begged for a chance to shut down. He didn‚Äôt have to look to know the hangnail was now coming straight from his heart, like a knife left by an unfaithful lover. It was only when he stopped screaming that he realised he had been. Somewhere in the distance he heard a lawnmower. That‚Äôs right. It was Sunday. Lazy Sunday.

His chest was almost level with the door now. So he opened it and let himself fall to the ground. As he fell he heard something snap as one of the nails moorings broke. The pain was like a point blank gunshot but he didn‚Äôt care, it was his first taste of freedom.

He could feel a puddle of blood underneath him, like taking a hot bath in the November air. This was the heart blood, life‚Äôs blood. He could feel the satanic claw of the nail loosen its grip. He didn‚Äôt care if it killed him, as long as he died free.¬†

He resumed pulling, and screaming. He was grateful for the money he had spent on the vice, which prior to now had mostly been used to crack walnuts. He grabbed handfuls of dirt and grass and dragged himself forward with strength that must have been drawn from the earth itself. He was numb to the pain, numb to the damage he was inflicting on himself, deaf to his own screams, he just wanted it gone‚Ä¶

He awoke and knew it was over. It was gone. He felt empty. Like a gutted fish. He could feel wind howling in the empty spaces inside himself where the nail had been. But it was gone.¬†

In a panic he looked around to check where it was. He didn‚Äôt want it to crawl back inside him. He didn‚Äôt think he could face another round. It lay in a black circle of blood soaked earth. It looked desiccated, like a dead spider. Looked dead, but he didn‚Äôt trust that. The base of it, where it had infiltrated his heart, looked like a mockery of a heart made out of twisted thorns.

He looked down at his chest and saw the sheet he had used had been remade as a bandage to cover the gaping wound. It was soaked through red. Although he could still see the little flakes of white paint. The part near his heart was crumpled up and looked just like a rose.¬†

That‚Äôs when he noticed there were arms around him. Lucy? No, they were a man's arms. White and strewn with freckles. They held him up in a sitting position. The owner of the arms spoke and it was Norris, his next door neighbour who must have come when he heard screaming.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre awake.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù He answered weakly.

‚ÄúWhat happened? Was it an accident with one of the tools?‚Äù

He must have seen the trail of blood from the shed to Reg‚Äôs resting place.

‚ÄúNo, a hangnail.‚Äù

Norris laughed.

‚ÄúYeah, right.‚Äù Norris said.

Reg gestured to the remains of the hangnail.

‚ÄúWhat is it, some kind of root?‚Äù Norris asked.

‚ÄúSome kind,‚Äù Reg answered.

‚ÄúWe need to get you inside where it‚Äôs warm.‚Äù Norris said, sounding concerned.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Reg said firmly. ‚ÄúFirst we get rid of it.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, what would you like me to do with it?‚Äù

Reg wasn‚Äôt sure if Norris was just humoring him. But it didn‚Äôt matter as long as they did what was necessary.

‚ÄúThe compost bin,‚Äù Reg said, pointing to the end of the garden where there was a large black rectangular bin.

‚ÄúRight,‚Äù Norris said, gently lowering Reg down. Reg continued to watch him, using a herculean effort to keep his head raised. Norris reached for the hangnail.

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù Reg shouted. ‚ÄúFor God‚Äôs sake don‚Äôt touch it.‚Äù The thing could just be playing dead.¬†

‚ÄúGo to the shed,‚Äù Reg instructed him, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs another sheet. You can use it to wrap it up. Carefully.‚Äù

The urgency of Reg‚Äôs tone must have gotten through to him and Reg was glad to see Norris now approached the nail with proper caution. Taking the sheet he gingerly wrapped it while being careful not to touch it himself. Norris took the mummified form over to the compost bin and lifted the lid. Reg watched him so closely that Norris could feel his eyes on him.¬†

Reg took composting seriously and the compost bin was big, about half the size of a skip. Layers of decaying matter would be left there for months until they turned into a rich fertiliser that was destined for Reg‚Äôs beloved rose bed. It would make a good tomb for his foe.

Norris dropped the nail inside.

‚ÄúClose the lid‚Äù, Reg said.

Norris came back over to Reg. Swiping his hands together to signify a job well done. He helped Reg to his feet and carried him wounded soldier style back into the welcoming warmth of the living room. With a great delicacy he managed to get him onto the couch with only minimal agony.¬†

The couch, where the whole nightmare had begun, what seemed like an eternity ago. The podcast was still going but had moved on to another episode, this one about the Heaven‚Äôs Gate cult. He knew all about it but still he let it play.

‚ÄúWhere do you keep your bandages, Reg?‚Äù

‚ÄúUpstairs bathroom, medicine cabinet.‚Äù

Norris had been in his house before and knew his way around. He had been over several times for a cup of tea. (he was the generation of Irish person where this was simply expected) He got to work and Reg could tell he felt much happier in the familiar territory of helping a patient, rather than whatever the hell had been happening with that strange root...

Reg had never thought highly of Norris, he had always seemed a bit aloof. He was a canny businessman as well as a doctor. He had purchased a floundering medical journal, restored it to glory and then sold it on for a phenomenal profit. Although they exchanged the usual neighbourly banter there was no disguising the fact Norris‚Äôs house was twice the size of Reg‚Äôs and he even had a Koi pond.

Clearly he had misjudged him because here he was, helping him in his time of need. You never knew who would be there for you. It was mid-way through these reflections that Reg passed out again.

He awoke to the sound of gentle mirth and clinking spoons from the kitchen. Lucy was home. The knowledge of that flooded him like a powerful tranquilizer. The haphazard dressing on his chest had given way to more expert bandaging. Norris‚Äôs handiwork. It was dark out. He checked his watch. He‚Äôd been out for 4 hours.¬†

The podcast was silent. Lucy didn‚Äôt like it, called the hosts as ‚Äúcackling ghouls‚Äù. There was a steaming hot mug on the coffee table. He picked it up, the small movement was like doing the last rep at the gym but he was rewarded with a soothing sip of tea. Ah, tea, nectar of the gods.

‚ÄúHello‚Äù, he called out, announcing his presence.

Lucy entered the room. He blinked away tears and held out his arms, feeling like Karloff‚Äôs The Mummy. She hugged him tightly and he yelped.

‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù she said, and embraced him more gently.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay.‚Äù

Tears stung his eyes as he gave in to the feeling of being looked after.

‚ÄúHow did you know I‚Äôd be awake?‚Äù He said, glancing at the tea.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt, I just kept making them. That‚Äôs the fifteenth one. I wanted you to have something hot when you woke up.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, I do,‚Äù he said, winking.

She shook him gently and he felt waves of pain emanating from his track of wounds.

‚ÄúOw.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you think you‚Äôre in a fit state to make those comments?‚Äù

‚ÄúI am,‚Äù he said smiling.

‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you call me?‚Äù She asked, becoming serious.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù And he didn‚Äôt. Why not enlist her help in battle? She was his greatest ally after all.

‚ÄúSilly man,‚Äù she said and leaned in for a kiss. Norris entered with impeccable timing. He held a cup of tea and wore a friendly smile. Lucy pulled away.

‚ÄúAh you‚Äôre awake.‚Äù He said. ‚ÄúHow are those bandages holding up?‚Äù

He came over to Reg and started expertly tugging at the bandages. He seemed satisfied. He entered Doctor mode:

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be back tomorrow to change them. The ones on your arm aren‚Äôt that serious, it‚Äôs your chest I‚Äôd be worried about. You should really go to A and E.‚Äù

Reg shook his head. The Irish healthcare system was a complete shambles. Unless you were actually knocking down death‚Äôs door you‚Äôd be waiting 10 hours to be seen. In a cold waiting room with fluorescent lights, surrounded by strangers. He didn‚Äôt fancy it.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll take my chances‚Äù, he said. ‚ÄúI have a good nurse.‚Äù

‚ÄúSuit yourself.‚Äù Norris said, shrugging. ‚ÄúMake sure you get plenty of rest and drink plenty of fluids.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou patched up my wounded soldier,‚Äù Lucy said to Norris. ‚ÄúHow will I ever repay you?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúthe tea and biscuits should cover it.‚Äù

And you have enough money already, Reg thought and felt bad for thinking it. Money or not he was obviously a caring man. Feeling deep gratitude, Reg held out his hand to Norris who accepted it.

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù Reg said.

‚ÄúNot at all.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo,‚Äù Lucy said, ‚ÄúNorris said this was all caused by a hangnail? Is that right?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right,‚Äù Reg said.

Lucy was incredulous.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs true,‚Äù Norris said. ‚ÄúI saw it myself. It was...‚Äù He struggled to convey it. ‚ÄúOne for the books.‚Äù This gave him an idea. ‚ÄúIn fact, it would make a hell of an entry in the journal. Of course, I‚Äôd just have to take some pictures...‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Reg said adamantly, ‚Äúno one goes near it.‚Äù

Norris retreated. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the boss,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWell, the wife has been sending me texts. She‚Äôs ready to send out search and rescue. I better be off. Thanks for the tea, Lucy. Reg, mind yourself. No more life and death battles, for a while at least.‚Äù

‚ÄúUnderstood,‚Äù Reg said.

Norris left by the front door, exchanging a string of goodbyes with Lucy as he went. With Norris out of the way Lucy gave him his deferred kiss. It too was one for the books and made the whole day of fighting seem worth it. She helped him up the stairs which had somehow transformed into Kilimanjaro.¬†

He got into bed with her, something that never failed to make him giddy, despite the 5 years they had been together. Under the covers, she began to talk to him in the conspiratorial whisper he knew well.

‚ÄúReg, hun, was it really a hangnail?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù he said, feeling indignant.

‚ÄúBut how did it get so big?‚Äù

‚ÄúBeats me.‚Äù

There was a silence into which he felt like interjecting lots of things, but they all felt impolite. Finally he found what he wanted to say. ‚ÄúYou believe me don‚Äôt you, Luce?‚Äù

Whether she did or not she chose to. ‚ÄúYes, hun,‚Äù she said, and gave him an affirming kiss on the head.

She went to sleep quickly, as was her way, and he was left with the pain which was like a chorus of voices, vying for his attention. ‚ÄúRemember me?‚Äù They seemed to say. He found by resting his head against Lucy‚Äôs chest he could quiet them, and like this he slept.

It was March. A Sunday. Reg had taken the last 3 months off as sick leave but was scheduled to return Tomorrow. He looked forward to the return of normalcy. He stood in the living room, hot cup of tea in hand.¬†

The blood stains in the carpet had long since been cleaned. Lucy had put up a show of complaining but he suspected she was glad it wasn‚Äôt the outline of his body she was cleaning.

He felt like a new man after getting the nail out. There was a spring in his step and some days he felt 25 rather than the 45 he was. He guessed not having an unwelcome passenger siphoning his lifeforce would do that.¬†

He had finished the lego Death Star and a number of other builds as well. Including Mt. Doom from Lord of the Rings which was over 7,000 pieces.¬†

People asked him what his secret was and he felt like telling them it was buried in the back garden. He looked out at the rose bed. He was delighted to see small green dots that showed they were starting to bud. Lucy had been applying fresh compost during his convalescence and it had done its job. He marvelled at nature, its resilience and immortality.

He noticed something else sticking out of the soil, whitish grey, and curved like a banana. A piece of trash that had blown over the wall he assumed. He went outside to pick it up. He wanted his roses pristine. His heart froze when he saw what it really was. The nail. Alive and about the thickness of his wrist, it extended about a foot from the soil and pointed at him threateningly.

Well, he thought, going to the shed to retrieve a trowel, in for a penny in for a pound.",1,1737533767.0,deepnightsociety,0,1.0,False
