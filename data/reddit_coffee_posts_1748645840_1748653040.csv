1kzkhu3,https://www.reddit.com/r/managers/comments/1kzkhu3/second_interview_coffee_chat_after_a_vp_interview/,"Second interview (coffee chat) after a VP interview at a big bank ‚Äî haven't heard back in 1 week, and the posting was taken down today","I recently applied for a position at one of the big banks and, to my surprise, was contacted for an in-person interview pretty quickly. The first interview was at a branch and lasted about an hour with both a recruiter and a VP. The recruiter mentioned I‚Äôd hear back in 3 weeks, but when he stepped out, the VP said it would probably be closer to 2 weeks ‚Äî so I figured I‚Äôd just wait it out.

Then, the very next day, I got a call inviting me to meet the same VP again, this time for an informal coffee chat. The recruiter explained that the first interview was ‚Äúonly an hour,‚Äù and the VP didn‚Äôt get to ask everything she wanted to. The following week, we met at a local coffee shop, and the tone was much more casual. She asked a lot about my personal background and interests ‚Äî not much technical or role-specific stuff this time.

She mentioned she had two more candidates to meet by the end of that week (the coffee chat was last Wednesday ‚Äî so it's now been a full week). Before we parted ways, she reminded me that I had her email and said I could reach out if I had any questions. I sent her a thank you email that same day but haven‚Äôt heard back yet.

Today, I noticed the job posting has been taken down. I‚Äôm trying not to overthink, but I‚Äôve only been in banking for about 4 months, and this would be my first move outside of retail banking ‚Äî so I‚Äôm feeling a bit anxious. Trying to read between the lines: does the coffee chat and taken-down posting mean anything? Or is it too soon to worry?",1,1748652756.0,managers,0,1.0,False
1kzkhts,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracytheories/comments/1kzkhts/sorry_believers_but_a_real_philadelphia/,Sorry Believers.... But a Real Philadelphia Experiment Ends With a Bang. Not a Poof! ü§£,"the Philadelphia Experiment.... we will move forward under the premise the premise that the navy actually conducted the experiment in1943. So... picture this... the goal is to make a multi thousand ton hunk of steel and sailors just... vanish. Poof...Or teleport. We're not talking about some fancy camouflage netting here...we're talking ""violating several known laws of physics before breakfast... kind of stuff.
Now, the energy required for such a stunt? You'd need something that makes a modern aircraft carriers nuclear reactor look like a couple of D cell batteries taped together.... probably enough juice to give the entire eastern seaboard a glow. And how pray tell were they planning to control this cosmic level light switch in an era when the cutting edge of computation was a dude with an abacus?Were talking vacuum tubes the size of milk bottles and dials you could steer a ship with... supposedly taming forces that would make a supernova peanut buttern fuckin jealous...
If you somehow managed to uncork that kind of genie from its bottle...it‚Äôs not going to politely make the ship invisible while leaving the captain‚Äôs coffee warm..... Oh no... Any field capable of bending light around a destroyer or (and this is the really wild part) derezzing it for a trip to norfolk isn't going to result in a few poor saps artistically fused to bulkheads like some Gigeresque wall art or 'phasing' in and out of reality like they're caught in a celestial game of peeka boo. More likely, the Eldridge and everyone aboard would have experienced a sudden, dramatic, and deeply unscheduled transition into a rapidly expanding cloud of very surprised atoms or perhaps achieved a state of total existence failure at the exact moment the ""on"" switch was flipped. The curiously specific, almost 'made for TV' paranormal horror show elements that make the legend so darn sticky just don't mesh with the sheer indiscriminate universe altering violence that any actual attempt to warp reality on that scale, with 1940s tech would have inevitably unleashed. It's far more plausible that if something experimental and high energy went catastrophically pear shaped, it ended with a very loud, very conventional boom and a mountain of classified oopsie reports.... not a neatly packaged mystery box of interdimensional weirdness....

1kzkhod,https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmint/comments/1kzkhod/disable_ctrla_copy/,Disable CTRL-A Copy,"For reasons I don't quite understand (I think it has something to do with [multiple clipboards](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/119043/how-can-i-disable-selection-highlight-auto-copying)), CTRL-A seems to select all and then copy, instead of just selecting all, which is what I would like to happen. Whenever I copy something with CTRL-C, then select something else with CTRL-A with the intent to have it overwritten via paste, it copies the second selected text, so when I paste with CTRL-V, it pastes the second selection, rather than overwriting it with the first, which is what I want to happen. Is there any way to disable this behavior. I can tell that this is happening by looking at my clipboard history in diodon, and I see whatever I selected with CTRL-A first on the list, followed by what I copied with CTRL-C.

I'd love to hear what you think can be improved and how you feel the space came out

  
When I opened my first LGS in the US we had a large focus on displaying product and singles - it led a lot of non-tcg visitors to leave immediately as they felt the space wasn't for them. For this store, I aimed to offer coffee/beer/snacks so people could utilize the space as a cafe/bar while gamers could also come in for DnD/MTG

The results: While people DO really enjoy being able to order coffee/alcohol, I do feel the concept doesn't work as well as a pure LGS. In terms of revenue, this shop does just a tiny fraction of what the LGS in the US does, and struggles to get events firing as the layout isn't traditional for FNM/commander nights. That being said, it's still profitable and growing - so hopefully some day it'll come close.

Added context she stays in the house while we are at work. My husband gets off at 2pm and I usually leave around 9am. So about 5 hours she's in the house. She is toileted directly before I leave and immediately when my husband gets home. She goes for a walk almost daily but hates hot weather and prefers to ride in the car sometimes. She has 3 feline sisters. Never had an issue with the cats. They stay inside with her. The only time anything has happened was she got a bit too close to my older cat and she's been swatted at. No injuries or scratches. Nothing. 

Suddenly the past 2 weeks, she has been so distant. We made her a den in our walk in closet and lately she's been in there almost 24/7. She's not interested in playing as much (she's always been super energetic). There's one particular area which connects our kitchen to the living room and lately she has been refusing to walk the normal way and instead going under the coffee table. She has ALWAYS eaten her treats on her bed in the living room and is now eating them by the side door refusing to go in the living room. I'm not sure what has happened... if something has scared her. She hates loud noises and gun shots (I live in the middle of nowhere lol) along with thunderstorms. 

Haven't had much of that recently so I don't know what's setting her off... any advice? ",1,1748652329.0,DogAdvice,1,1.0,False

For a while, on and off I've had sharp pains in my feet, and sometimes my hand. It's been more consistent lately. I've also for as long as I can remember have have bubbly / foamy urine, which I always thought was normal, I learned recently this is no that case. I went to my doctor and she ordered some blood work I also had her check my A1C, which I've had done twice before over the last 2 years and the results seem kind of crazy to me.

This last test had me a 4.2 A1C and 73.8 eAG. The two previous tests had me at around the same, 4.3 and 76.7 and 4.2 and 73.8. My glucose level on my metabolic panel was also at 91

As of last week I started intermittent fasting, and this week I have been going on walks after work, trying to get my cardio up. I know I need to lose weight and get healthy. At my weight and life styles those numbers seem way too low to me. My doctor doesn't seem overly worried about these levels being lower despite my weight and life style. Is there any other tests I should be asking for? I'm not sure if I should be worried or looking into hypoglycemia. Or should I just be grateful for these number and continue to try and lead a healthier lifestyle?

She did also order some other tests to check kidney function, those haven't come back yet, and a couple other tests. The metabolic panel came back with everything within normal ranges. A uric acid test came back at 5.7. Sedimentation Rate was <1. Rheumatoid factor was a 4. And everything in a urine test I took looked normal.

The impact of PCOS on my life  took its worst turn one year ago. As of March 2024 I was 39 years old, 193 pounds, 5ft tall, with a severe pain in my pelvis that kept worsening. For 3 years prior my weight fluctuated around 175 but 193 was my highest weight yet. I made it my goal to omit all unhealthy practices by eating organic/mostly whole foods and walking 5 days a week.

 By April 2024 I lost 10 pounds. But, the pain in my pelvis worsened. April 20th I went to the ER for severe pain in my ovaries.I had been unable to eat for 48 hours from nausea induced pain. I only had drank mint tea and water till that point. My CT scans showed the usual cysts on my ovaries with one prominent  4-5 mm cyst . I also showed an elevated sugar level. I notified the Dr I had been fasting for 2 days how could my sugars be raised? They just pushed that point aside. 


A few days later I saw my obgyn and we made a surgery date for July to remove the larger ovarian cyst. I did not make it to that planned surgery. On June 3rd they had to perform an emergency surgery due to crippling pain worse than childbirth that sent me to the ER. The pain was so great that 4 shots of morphine did not make a dent in the ER triage center. It was not till I was transported upstairs to surgery prep that the pain subsided after receiving my second shot of dilaudid that evening. We waited for my obgyn/prefered surgeon to be ready for the morning to operate.   At around 3 AM I was given a visit by the female DR on call that proposed I do a full hysterectomy within the hour. I politely told her I was on too much drugs to make such a sudden decision,  that was not in my surgery plan, and most importantly that is something I needed to discuss with my husband. She left with her tail between her legs. 


That morning during surgery my DR. discovered a 6mm cyst straddling my fallopian tube like a jump rope. The twisting was cutting off blood supply that was undetectable via CT scans or Sonogram. Had the cyst not been removed its continued pressure on my fallopian tube would be life threatening. They removed the cyst and fallopian tube but saved the ovaries to keep my hormones stabilized. I was also put on metphormin, given an IUD to stabilize my uterus, and act as a preventive of cancer. 


Untill then I had not had a menstrual cycle for 1 year. Birth Control was not an option due to stroke symptoms every time we tried a different brand. My problem of menstruating only once a year had been happening since I was 28. 
From that point onwards I made it my point to continue to lose weight, be healthy, and heal my PCOS.


 Despite my continued efforts, calorie deficient diet, and religious working out ethic my weight nor my pcos would budge. My weight would fluctuate between 175-183. I weighed more than when I gave birth in 2017. 


Prior to giving birth in 2017 I had not been overweight since I was 14 yrs old. At 14 I was diagnosed with PCOS when 20 cysts on each ovary were detected via sonogram.


That year I  lost my extra weight from fasting and continued to battle my weight for many years. I would ultimately stay thin and healthy through my teens and 20s but it took a lot of work including daily exercise and sometimes intermitent fasting. During my healthiest stages my period was always irregular and would arrive every 3-4 months. At the age of 28 my period started to occur every 6 months to a year despite practicing a very healthy lifestyle and being in a healthy BMI of 115 - 120 pounds. My body was very lean with a high muscle mass. I ate well and healthy.  I was also an avid Bikram yoga lover. This meant 90 minutes practicing yoga in a 104 degree temperature room 3 - 5 days a week accompanied by running or hiking on alternating days. 


Even then during my healthiest my periods were irregular, and any any use of birth control would cause stoke like symptoms of pain in my legs and arms. 


6 months prior to marriage in 2016 my now husband and I tried to get my menstruation cycle back on track in prep for starting our own family. I was told to lose 10 pounds and start metphormin by my doctor, even though I was at a healthy weight of 128 pounds. I argued that at 115 pounds my body would shrink to a size 2 clothing with a 25 inch waist as it had been for many years before. It would all just be asthetic. I also argued that my body weight never changed my irregular periods through my whole menstruating life. If anything my menstruation cycle kept getting worse despite my avid working out and healthy living. 


I lost 5 pounds anyways and starred the metphormin. I had a regular period for 3 short months. And then it stopped all together right before our wedding. My Dr. Chalked it up to nerves. I continued the metphormin and was told my chances of conception were very low. Not to even think about pregnancy and just work on my health. After our honeymoon my weight suddenly hit a 145 pound mark even though I did nothing different in my nutrition or activity levels. I couldn't understand it. I thought perhaps it was stress or the metphormin medication. Then 4 months after our wedding, without a period, while taking metformin, I was pregnant! Stranger things have happened, so we took this surprise as a blessing and were overjoyed. Especially after coming to terms we would most likely have to adopt or do IVF. 


I was 172 pounds when  I gave birth to my daughter. Within 3 weeks of birth I shot down to 145 pounds. And then began the yoyo of weight that would drive me crazy for 7 years.  No matter how I ate, exercised or behaved. My body would pack on pounds in unexplainable fashion overnight. My period also seemed to be a phantom that would appear once a year. Despite sonograms and progesterone pills. Sometimes the pills woukd work but then I would bleed profusely for 2 week periods and it became a health risk. We never did conceive again. 


Fast forward to this past year. After months of working out at an exhausting calorie deficient lifestyle of lean meats, veggies, and fruits, my moral began sinking. Doctors didn't believe me. I must be lieing or sneaking food. I would average on 2 pounds lost every 2 months,  only to gain it back for no apparent reason. One day I did a 5 mile hike/run ate very healthy and gained 2 pounds in my sleep. 

The straw that broke my camels back was when I got food poisoned for 3 days, meaning everything came out of me like water, and I could only eat very light brat foods like apple and toast. Guess what‚Ä¶I gained a pound after those 3 days. At that point I broke down crying to my husband because I felt like an insane person. Doing everything all the nutritionists tell you to do, with NO results. I was so tired, and angry. My husband went online and did some research and came across the PCOS plan. I received it on May 1st and started it the same day. 


That's when I read about the metabolic syndrome associated with PCOS. This was ME! I had finally found the missing puzzle piece to why my weight would fluctuate with no regaurd to my hard work. It made sense why all the weight was mostly in my mid section and my ability to menstrate was an impossible black hole of questions. 


Once I started fasting and ommiting the hidden carbs/sugar in the specialized diet the pounds starting coming off with ease. For example I had no idea a simple culprit like onions had enough starch and carb power to throw my sugar levels into wack forcing my body into an elivated fat storing mode. 


Additionally I started working out less and only doing short 30 minute HIT style workouts of high intensity 3 times a week. I kept walking or hiking. But I didn't feel over run with exhaustion. What I thought had been weight gain due to stress of motherhood was now very clearly from one culprit. Sugar. For every teaspoon of honey I had been putting in my healthy morning yogurt, my body had been hard wired to store all my days fat because of my metabolic syndrome.


Here is the craziest part. I started my period after one week of starting this diet. It wasn't a light spotting as usual, but a real healthy menstrual cycle. I was floored! Maybe a second child, even though I am now 40, is in site!


It has been 1 month since reading  and practicing this book and I have lost 15 pounds and 3 inches on my waste with ease.  I am 165 pounds to date. I still have 40 pounds to go, but I feel like I finally have a true understanding of my body and why my PCOS had taken full hostage once I gained weight in pregnancy. My sugar and metabolic resistance was like an out of control snowball with no end. 


The change in my diet was extremely easy because I have been living with celiacs disease for 10 years. This meant I was able to hard wire the idea of sugar and carbs being a negative food in my brain just I have for gluten. I eat a handful of berries with whipped heavy wipping cream,  lemon zest, and pecans, similar to a dessert recipe in the book, when I really have a sweet tooth hankering. The coffee mug almond flour bread is also one of my favorite recipes. I am also looking forward to my birthday where I can splurge , as directed in the book, with drinks and cake. As well as all other major holidays. I know once I hit my healthy BMI that my low carb lifestyle will not be so militantly stringent. When the time comes I can dip my sushi in soy sauce and it wont break my progress, but until then I will keep at it. 


I hope this has given clarity as to why I have started this support group page. I am questioning why this book is so highly gate kept and pushed aside by other PCOS communities. I know the demands in the book seem hard, but if choosing between avoiding hard versus what's good for your health‚Ä¶I choose the battle.

Does anyone else feel like having a girlfriend makes you a better person? Long story below if you wanna take the time to read it.

BRIEF -
I‚Äôve been single since 2022, with some on and off dates/one night stands since then. When I was with my ex, I loved going to work, because I used the money to go to restaurants, get hotels, get clothes etc, but since we broke up, I‚Äôve really fell off as a person.
Before I met her, I barely got attention from girls, I couldn‚Äôt hold a conversation with girls and girls just kind of ignored me.
I got with her because no one else gave me a chance and as soon as we got in a relationship, girls at work were initiating conversations with me, flirting, asking for my socials and giving me compliments. 

ATTENTION -
I worked for an agency, so I was meeting different people all the time. I had so many chances with girls I thought were out of my league, but I stayed professional because I didn‚Äôt want to cheat.
There was a time I overheard a female supervisor talking about me to other girls at work and she said ‚Äúoh he‚Äôs the new guy, the girls are crazy about him‚Äù.
One of my friends at work, brought up my GF when we were talking and some of the girls beside us seemed upset and surprised. I had another instance at work, where a random girl who was walking my way said ‚ÄúI love your hair‚Äù and walked past me.
Obviously there‚Äôs a general factor of ‚Äúmaybe they think I‚Äôm gay‚Äù but I have good emotional awareness and I can tell the difference between flirting and just being friendly.

BENEFITS -
My ex had a nice friend group, so we spent a lot of time together over the summer, in beer gardens and parks. I even introduced some of my own friends to them and tried to set them up together. It wasn‚Äôt successful but regardless, I always had something to do. It was nice being in the company of attractive girls, in the sun, with my GF on my lap drinking a cocktail.
Her friends were constantly making plans for us to go places, and I even got along with the guys her friends were seeing. And if we wanted to go out alone (just me and my GF) it was nice dressing up and going out to bars all night and getting taxi‚Äôs home.
When I was by myself, going to get coffee or food, I was getting special treatment from the workers, like getting away with being short changed, extra portions in my burrito, some times the barista‚Äôs even ‚Äúforgot‚Äù to charge me on the card machine.

ABOUT ME - 
In 2022, I was scrawny (6ft 1, 145lbs), didn‚Äôt go the gym, had a vegan diet and ate once a day. All I had in my system was vegetables, green tea and coffee. I‚Äôm white and had hair like Anakin in ROTS except curlier. Super low body fat, had a six pack but my body was skinny asf and my cheekbones were prominent. I was obsessed with having good skin and being ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù yet I was afraid of eating and going to the gym.
I‚Äôm a good looking guy but I hate seeing photos of me around this time because I think I look feminine, yet girls were treating me like I was Brad Pitt.

AFTERMATH-
Fast forward a bit, my ego gets too big and I decide I deserve better than her. I breakup with her and her friends tell me they‚Äôre gonna block me out of respect for her, so I told them it‚Äôs fine, and it went well.
So at this point, the previous girls from work, stopped showing up due to college, and I decide to find a girl elsewhere. Me and my friends start going out to bars/clubs looking for a potential girlfriend. I still have my confidence, I meet different girls, hoping to find my next girlfriend but these girls just want to have sex and have fun. I did go home with them, but that was it.
As time goes on, the number of girls I click with goes down and down, and my flirting/social skills go down too.
I get a new job, so I get a ‚Äútrim‚Äù at the barber to clean myself up a bit. She cuts my hair too short and I went from Anakin Skywalker to Chris Evans. I look completely different and my hair looks how it was pre Covid, I felt a disturbance in the force‚Ä¶.
I still go on to meet girls but there‚Äôs zero hope of getting into a relationship, the girls I meet are from different countries/places.
I start to miss how it was before. 

CURRENT DAY:
I go to the gym, more muscular and masculine. I stopped my vegan diet and as a result, my skin isn‚Äôt crystal clear like it was before. My hair isn‚Äôt as long as it was before, it‚Äôs now Justin Timberlake length. Had a few dates over the years but nothing special or promising. Struggling to find a job, left previous jobs because of loneliness and lack of motivation. I was spending my paychecks all on pizza and worthless crap. 
Can‚Äôt get matches on dating apps anymore and can‚Äôt pull women in person anymore. 
All I do is workout or play video games. I think I look better now than in 2022, I‚Äôm now 180 lbs and more masculine, yet girls prefer the skinny pretty boy version of me that I was before.
Way more serious about life now than I was before and I‚Äôve gotten into a few physical fights due to being disrespected.
My whole outlook on life has changed and I‚Äôve become very bitter and self centered. 
I keep thinking of working full time but I have no motivation to do so, I have no GF to meet up with after work, I have no holidays booked with a GF, there‚Äôs no dressing well for dates anymore and no keeping up with appearances.
I have given a lot of chances in regards to having a positive attitude, working on myself, going out with friends, and joining new work environments, but I‚Äôve had zero success. Most girls I‚Äôve clicked with, had a boyfriend picking them up from work or on their lockscreen so no chance for me, and as for the single girls, they weren‚Äôt very social or as attractive.

If you‚Äôve made it down this far, thanks for reading. The point of this post was to see if anyone else can relate to losing purpose whilst being single. For anyone living day to day being alone just working, procrastinating etc.

1kzk6km,https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/1kzk6km/my_period_is_making_me_sick/,My period is making me sick,"I‚Äôve been in and out of the hospital, and specialists offices for the last month because of these problems so I want to see if anyone else is having these same problems. Right before and during menstruation it seems as though my body is shutting down completely. I don‚Äôt mean to regular weakness and and sluggishness that comes with a normal period. My body with become so sluggish that I will not and cannot move out of bed from the moment that I hit luteal phase to the moment that ovulation stops for me. Lately I‚Äôve been bloating really bad, swollen and genuinely painful breast and hips that has brought me to tears on many occasion. Headaches that makes my head feel like it‚Äôs gonna explode. Extremely bad backaches that make it hard for me to move. I have fainting spells and near fainting spells that are accompanied with extreme impending doom, I deal with imbalance as if my equilibrium is off to the point where I can barely walk, it feels like my head is heavier than my body. I deal with numbness and tingling in hands and feet, I get the shakes or tremors and I become very jumpy, and I also get heart palpitations that are very consistent. As for my emotions during my menstrual is an entirely different story. I used to feel emotional imbalance which I still do but now that over all feeling I get is genuine fear, I‚Äôm constantly on edge, constantly in a state of panic to the point where you KNOW something is wrong. I constantly have butterflies in my stomach. And the feelings of fear are inappropriate like I could feel excitement and it will trigger my heart to race and then it somehow sends me into a panic. I lose all grip on reality during my cycle and it‚Äôs like I slip into psychosis everytime my cycle comes on, I have a lot more impulsive/intrusive thoughts, I hear and see things that aren‚Äôt there. I have no history of psychosis other than this same exact thing happening a couple years ago and my menstrual caused it then as well. I deal with extreme brain fog the moments I‚Äôm not in a panic, like absolutely cannot form a thought, I cannot have a conversation without zoning out. I will endure this and more all the way up until the week after ovulation and I feel myself balance out as if my body is going into recovery, I can stand, walk and think again, my thoughts are balanced, I‚Äôm able to control the fear much better or I don‚Äôt feel it at all. I feel motivated, and have all the energy in the world and then I fall right back into it the week after. 
Recently during ovulation I noticed the impending doom and fainting feeling slowed down but when still present especially after eating, the heart palpitations was still there and I didn‚Äôt physically feel myself ovulating either which is odd because prior to this starting, I KNEW when I was ovulating.

I don‚Äôt smoke, drink or drink any type of stimulation like coffee. I don‚Äôt do any substances at all. I‚Äôve gotten blood work done and everything was fine from what they told me even though something‚Äôs where boarder line. When I go to the ER are these fainting/impending doom/anxiety attacks my BP would be like 134/70, or 145/78. But they would still send me out telling me I‚Äôm fine. I was given a CT scan the last time I went and was told I could possibly have to pituitary microadnoma but they‚Äôre also making it seem like that‚Äôs not what the problem is, while also telling me it‚Äôs a possibility but it‚Äôs also not that big of a deal because it‚Äôs small? I haven‚Äôt gotten a MRI yet because the appointment isn‚Äôt until July. I was told it could be POTS but I‚Äôm not showing ALL the symptoms of POTS and the usual things that help with people with POTS does not help me (hydration, salt etc). I‚Äôm getting a hormone panel done next week (which would also support the adenoma diagnosis) but I feel like it‚Äôs still going to be brushed off even if they conclude that it‚Äôs my hormones, I don‚Äôt want to be given a mood stabilizer and be sent on my way, especially when I constantly feel like I‚Äôm on the verge of a heart attack everytime my period comes on. I could work on making changes in my own life in order to treat myself but everytime I go see a professional it‚Äôs like everyone is passing me off to a different specialist and acting nervous or has a lack of care when it comes to hearing my symptoms and possibly giving me a diagnosis, they just keep giving me EKGs and taking blood work. I guess the only thing I can do is wait? I have no support and no one I can call to come with me to these appointments, I‚Äôm doing this by myself and I feel so hopeless, has anyone else experienced these things??

1kzk5bw,https://www.reddit.com/r/EstrangedAdultKids/comments/1kzk5bw/saw_my_younger_sister_today_weird_kind_of/,"Saw my younger sister today. Weird, kind of cathartic though?","Background: After my mom and I had the big fight that led to our estrangement 2 years ago, I really tried to make sure I maintained a relationship with my siblings.  This isn't my first estrangement, and when we were younger I really regretted that I lost contact with *them*.  So I put in a lot of intentional effort.  Eventually I was just hurt that all 3 of them didn't stand up for me in the slightest, even after I was the only one who stood up for my sisters when my mom turned her crazy on them.  So I stopped trying.  Apparently they didn't like that after they noticed, which took about a year.  I have gone VLC since then.

Now: yesterday my sister called and told me she just walked off a plane and was in my city.  We haven't seen each other in person for probably... 5 years.  Honestly I was most hurt by her refusing to talk to me than any of my siblings.  She asked if I could make some time to see her while she was here on the weekend.  She had planned this trip for a bit and I was absolutely an afterthought.  Nothing new I guess.  But I decided to see her.  My therapist and I have played our how I would handle this scenario quite a bit, and I felt I was capable of enforcing my boundaries and just leaving if I needed to.

She brought her new boyfriend of 8 months that I didn't know existed, and he was very nice.  She told me about how her relationship is with her dad, which is practically identical to the one I have with my dad.  And then I asked her if she had repaired her relationship with out mom at all, because she had gone NC and then vlc with her several years ago.  She said its also superficial, same as with her dad, and we talked a little about what happened when mom and I had our blowout.  I tried to talk to my 3 siblings after it happened because I knew my mom would lie about why I got upset.  My brother was the only one who spoke to me about it.  Because we were relating about parental relationships and I know she's gone through similar shit, I asked if she wanted to know, and she said only if I wanted to tell her, but she knew there were holes in our mom's story and wasn't taking it as all truth.

I decided to tell her.  I explained what she said, and what led to what she said, and I didn't need to explain more.  Her jaw literally dropped.  (For the interested: I am a med compliant bipolar and my biggest fear is I will have an episode and go off my meds.  My mom told me multiple times I could always come to her and she would encourage me to stay on my meds.  She wanted to win an argument and said if I wanted to go off my meds she would support me.  It was honestly devastating.  I trust very few people with my diagnosis, and fewer still that I would trust if I were having an episode and my judgment was impaired.)

She shared more I didn't know about what led to their estrangement, and I told her I didn't know all of what happened but it didn't matter.  I know she was emotionally intelligent and clearly states her very reasonable boundaries, plus I know the shit my mom is capable of, so if she was that upset I trusted it was warranted.  We got on the topic of everyone just playing along with mom's abuse and how frustrating it is that she never gets called out.  Except **I** called her out.  I was kind but firm that I wouldn't tolerate her missing missing reasons act, and it didn't matter if she didn't understand because she clearly hurt her and she should stop harping on whether she was right or wrong.  Its your daughter.  It may have been unintentional (heavy emphasis on ""may"") but stop fucking minimizing how she feels.  I explained how frustrating it was that our other siblings would talk big until mom was in the room and then they just coddled her and ger big hurt feelings.

At one point she asked me if she ever made *me* feel shoved aside when I talked about the way the whole family would just act like when my mom disowned me in college and I had no contact with any of them for over 6 years but was just me being on vacation or something.  And I thought for a moment, and told her honestly thay no, I don't think she ever made those kind of comments but it never felt like anyone in the family ever stood up for me.  And maybe they did when I wasn't around, but when comments like ""oh you weren't here for that"" as if I was just on vacation instead of forcibly kicked out of my entire family were made, no one ever stood up for me.  And I acknowledge that we didn't know each other when I first was invited back.  I was undiagnosed when they knew me last, and made bad decisions in episodes.  So I hoped with time we would get to know each other again and they could trust me, but it never felt like it happened.

It... kind of felt good to say that to someone in my family.  No one had *ever* cared enough to ask, and lord knows no one wanted to listen when I wanted to talk about it.  I was proud of all the work I've done in therapy because it wasn't emotional at all for me.  I acknowledge the hurt and we can't change the past, and I'll never put myself in that situation again.  I learned.

But I do feel a little guilt.  I mean, this this conversation didn't change everything.  I feel pretty confident she didn't feel bad for hurting my feelings or something.  But she generally prides herself on being empathetic and kind, and generally she is (woth other people, at least), and so it may make her feel bad.  Even being as composed and kind and brief as I could be, I know that would make me feel bad, and it wasn't my intention at all.  But I am very over letting that kind of shit slide, and so if she has any interest in having a relationship other than vlc, she needs to be aware of my boundaries going in.  If she was just being nice to my face for an hour over coffee, cool.  We'll send the occasional happy birthday text or whatever.

Thank God for my amazing therapist or I probably wouldve been an emotional mess.  Passed the first test.",5,1748651709.0,EstrangedAdultKids,1,1.0,False

A Return to Myst Inspired by the Myst universe




November 14th, 2020 ‚Äì New York City

The bookstore smelled of old paper, dark coffee, and anticipation. A modest crowd gathered beneath the warm light of the reading nook at Hudson‚Äôs Rare Reads on 34th Street, waiting for the man whose imagination had rekindled interest in one of gaming‚Äôs most enigmatic islands. Mr. Daniel Jefferson, a former linguistics professor turned bestselling author, stepped up to the podium with a small, almost nostalgic smile.

‚ÄúThank you all for coming,‚Äù he began, his voice smooth and reflective. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been twenty-two years since the island of Myst vanished beneath the sea. I was one of the last to walk its shores. Tonight, I‚Äôd like to read an excerpt from my new book, A Return to Myst.‚Äù

He opened the hardcover book with a reverent touch, its cover a misty swirl of blues and greys with a lone tree half-submerged in water.




Excerpt from A Return to Myst ‚Äì Chapter 5: ""The Silence After the Wave""

I remember the first time I stepped onto the island like it was yesterday‚Äîthough it was 1994. The sudden whoosh of the Linking Book pulling me from my living room into a world that felt more dream than reality. Back then, Myst was vibrant, alive with hidden machinery, humming energy, and riddles wrapped in rusted journals.

But nothing could prepare me for the day I returned after the tidal wave. January 5th, 1998.

I was in a caf√© in Tucson when the alert came through on a small satellite radio. ‚ÄúFreak tidal wave strikes uncharted archipelago near the Bermudan Triangle. Unknown origin. No known casualties.‚Äù I knew. I felt it. Myst was gone. I could feel the void in my chest‚Äîan unbearable silence.

Against all reason, I returned.

Using an old Linking Book I‚Äôd preserved in a temperature-controlled vault‚Äîyes, I know how that sounds‚ÄîI found the page intact. No ink had run. The gateway shimmered faintly. I pressed my hand against the image. And I was there.

But Myst was not.

What remained was not an island. It was a fragment. A sliver of shattered cliff, like a memory forced to keep breathing. The library‚Äîdestroyed. The dock‚Äîgone. The clock tower lay crumbled in the ocean like a drowned titan.

But one thing remained untouched: the pillar of light.

It rose where the central tree once stood. A strange, humming obelisk of translucent metal, etched with D‚Äôni script. Somehow, the power source‚Äîthe linking essence‚Äîhad survived. As if the island itself had called for one last breath before it died.

And then came the voice.

‚ÄúReestablishing link. Your presence has been noted.‚Äù

I turned. There was no one. Just the whisper of wind and water. But I wasn‚Äôt afraid. No, I was‚Ä¶ exhilarated.

Something beneath the ruins called to me. A whisper that I followed down through the broken remains of the mechanical age. I climbed through the fissures, crawled past ancient copper wheels. And there, beneath it all, was a new chamber.

A place never mapped. Never seen. A chamber built not by Atrus, but by someone else.

Inside were tomes‚Äîbooks untouched by flood or fire. Dozens of Ages. Some burnt halfway, some sealed shut with golden clamps etched in language I couldn‚Äôt decipher. And in the center, a book with no title. Only a handprint embossed in glass.

I touched it.

WHOOMPH.

I landed on a platform floating in a sky of green clouds and singing crystal towers. The Age was unstable. Gravity shifted. My skin tingled. I wandered‚Äîno puzzles, no guidance‚Äîjust a strange rhythm of wind and vibration like a heartbeat.

I realized, then, Myst had evolved. It wasn‚Äôt just an island. It was a living legacy, fragmented and scattered through lost Ages, some broken, others yearning for visitors.

Before I left, I stood once more at the edge of what had been Myst‚Äôs garden. The roses were gone. Only moss remained. But the feeling‚Äîof mystery, of unspoken stories, of unseen eyes‚Äîremained as strong as ever.

I left that day not with sadness, but with purpose. Myst was gone, but it was not over. It lives in the pages, the puzzles, the echoes.

It lives in the minds of those who dared to dream there.




Daniel closed the book. The crowd remained silent for a long moment. Some had tears in their eyes. Others looked thoughtful, lost in memories of their own time playing the game that once made them feel like explorers in their own home.

A young man raised his hand. ‚ÄúMr. Jefferson‚Äîdo you think Myst could ever return? For real?‚Äù

Daniel looked out the foggy bookstore window, where rain softly tapped the glass.

He smiled. ‚ÄúIf you listen carefully‚Äîsometimes late at night‚Äîyou can almost hear the gears turning. And the door opening.‚Äù

He paused. ‚ÄúMyst never really left. You just need the right book‚Ä¶ and the courage to touch the page.‚Äù

Right before and during menstruation it seems as though my body is shutting down completely. I don‚Äôt mean to regular weakness and and sluggishness that comes with a normal period. My body with become so sluggish that I will not and cannot move out of bed from the moment that I hit luteal phase to the moment that ovulation stops for me. Lately I‚Äôve been bloating really bad, swollen and genuinely painful breast and hips that has brought me to tears on many occasion. Headaches that makes my head feel like it‚Äôs gonna explode. Extremely bad backaches that make it hard for me to move. I have fainting spells and near fainting spells that are accompanied with extreme impending doom, I deal with imbalance as if my equilibrium is off to the point where I can barely walk, it feels like my head is heavier than my body. I deal with numbness and tingling in hands and feet, I get the shakes or tremors and I become very jumpy, and I also get heart palpitations that are very consistent. As for my emotions during my menstrual is an entirely different story. I used to feel emotional imbalance which I still do but now that over all feeling I get is genuine fear, I‚Äôm constantly on edge, constantly in a state of panic to the point where you KNOW something is wrong. I constantly have butterflies in my stomach. And the feelings of fear are inappropriate like I could feel excitement and it will trigger my heart to race and then it somehow sends me into a panic. I lose all grip on reality during my cycle and it‚Äôs like I slip into psychosis everytime my cycle comes on, I have a lot more impulsive/intrusive thoughts, I hear and see things that aren‚Äôt there. I have no history of psychosis other than this same exact thing happening a couple years ago and my menstrual caused it then as well. I deal with extreme brain fog the moments I‚Äôm not in a panic, like absolutely cannot form a thought, I cannot have a conversation without zoning out. I will endure this and more all the way up until the week after ovulation and I feel myself balance out as if my body is going into recovery, I can stand, walk and think again, my thoughts are balanced, I‚Äôm able to control the fear much better or I don‚Äôt feel it at all. I feel motivated, and have all the energy in the world and then I fall right back into it the week after. 
Recently during ovulation I noticed the impending doom and fainting feeling slowed down but when still present especially after eating, the heart palpitations was still there and I didn‚Äôt physically feel myself ovulating either which is odd because prior to this starting, I KNEW when I was ovulating.

I don‚Äôt smoke, drink or drink any type of stimulation like coffee. I don‚Äôt do any substances at all. I‚Äôve gotten blood work done and everything was fine from what they told me even though something‚Äôs where boarder line. When I go to the ER are these fainting/impending doom/anxiety attacks my BP would be like 134/70, or 145/78. But they would still send me out telling me I‚Äôm fine. I was given a CT scan the last time I went and was told I could possibly have to pituitary microadnoma but they‚Äôre also making it seem like that‚Äôs not what the problem is, while also telling me it‚Äôs a possibility but it‚Äôs also not that big of a deal because it‚Äôs small? I haven‚Äôt gotten a MRI yet because the appointment isn‚Äôt until July. I was told it could be POTS but I‚Äôm not showing ALL the symptoms of POTS and the usual things that help with people with POTS does not help me (hydration, salt etc). I‚Äôm getting a hormone panel done next week (which would also support the adenoma diagnosis) but I feel like it‚Äôs still going to be brushed off even if they conclude that it‚Äôs my hormones, I don‚Äôt want to be given a mood stabilizer and be sent on my way, especially when I constantly feel like I‚Äôm on the verge of a heart attack everytime my period comes on. I could work on making changes in my own life in order to treat myself but everytime I go see a professional it‚Äôs like everyone is passing me off to a different specialist and acting nervous or has a lack of care when it comes to hearing my symptoms and possibly giving me a diagnosis, they just keep giving me EKGs and taking blood work. I guess the only thing I can do is wait? I have no support and no one I can call to come with me to these appointments, I‚Äôm doing this by myself and I feel so hopeless, has anyone else experienced these things??

1kzjz4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1kzjz4r/under_the_cnidarian_sky/,Under the Cnidarian Sky,"The rusted and rickety service elevator rattled upward towards the top of the tower. The building was a big, green, rectangular thing sticking up out of the ground and into the night sky. Once used to moniter a conveyor belt system, over the decades the site expanded - new conveyor systems were engineered, new towers were built to house them, with new rooms to moniter and operate from. This tower was now secluded at the far end of the expanded site and it's conveyor belts - jutting out from one side of the tall green rectangle - had become vestigial long before the two workers crammed themselves into the cramped metal elevator.

The service elevator jolted to a stop as it reached the top - metal scraped and clanged as one of the workers opened the sliding metal door.

""...and I don't give a shit if I did ""bring this upon myself"", Dan jerked his way up the ladder! How else can you explain ME, or even YOU, being passed up for supervisor! We've been here longer, we know more about this place than fuckin' Da-an, and we been bustin' our asses for years! And for what?!""

Isaac was a large, loud, man. His unkempt grey hair poked out from the underside of his hardhat and his gut bulged inside his coveralls, giving the impression of meat improperly stuffed into a sausage casing. The type to always crack his knuckles, and always speak whatever thought came into his mind.

Sid took advantage of the break in another classic Isaac rant, ""This is what I'm saying Isaac. You can't be an abrasive dickhead, and then complain when you're not seen to be ""supervisor material"". Managing people requires tact, and you got none.""

""And if you were MORE of a dickhead, then you wouldn't be up here with me, roped into cleaning this fuckin place!"" grumbled Isaac.

Sid was average sized - working on cultivating their own glorious gut with fast food and ultra sweet coffee. They had wavy, shoulder length, dark brown hair with a bleached streak, neatly tied up and tucked into their hardhat. They had a couple of small tattoos here and there and pierced ears with small black hoops.

Sid couldn't argue, with everyone other than Isaac they kept to themself - their existence ruffled enough feathers, why rock the boat more? That's what they had Isaac for, he was loud enough for both of them. Oil field work was hard and laborious, and it tended to draw in rough people - the types of people who would take one look at Sid and write them off as a freak, or worse, a target. All Sid wanted was to exist, go to work, get payed, go back to their apartment, and do it all over again the next day. Whenever Sid wondered if the paycheck was worth the sideways stares and jokes behind their back, they would remember that Isaac was there, waiting to complain to them about the new injustice of the day, and they would hate work a little bit less. They could be themself around Isaac.

The two of them walked across the foyer at the top floor of the tower and up to a grey metal door.

""Can't argue with you there. Come on then, let's just get this done."" Sid said as they took off their hardhat and touched it to a card reader on the wall next to the door handle.

Sid kept their ID badge clipped to the inside of their hardhat - a trick they had learned from Isaac back when they first started. The card reader beeped, the light turned green, and the door unlocked. Sid opened the door outward and held it for Isaac.

""Ladies first."" they said in a singsong tone.

Isaac pulled off his hardhat and casually saluted with his middle finger.

""Sir yes ma'am."" he said as he scanned his own hat.

Sid and Isaac entered the vacant control room at the top of the tower, the flourecent lights overhead flickered, and the door automatically closed behind them.


The two put their hardhats on the desk in the corner of the room, Sid dropped their workbag on the floor causing a small plume of dust to rise, Isaac leaned two brooms against a wall. There were fresh boot prints in the dust. The newly appointed Supervisor Dan had taken his boot and wiped away most of Isaac's ""artwork"", but the remnants were still there. In the thick layer of dust on the floor, Isaac had used the end of a broom handle to express his feelings regarding Dan. They had both been called into Dan's office and Sid had been shown a picture of Isaac's masterpiece that had been taken as evidence before it was wiped from the floor. It was a poorly drawn homage to goatsy, a pair of ass cheeks spread wide, butthole exposed, written underneath, it said ""DAN EATS CORPO SHIT"". Being caught completely off guard, Sid couldn't stop themself from laughing right in front of Dan. This caused Dan to assume that they both had a hand in this ""defacing of company property"" and this was why Sid was here along with Isaac, the two tasked with cleaning the filthy room top to bottom.

Sid pulled out a couple of respirators from the bag and handed one to Isaac.

""Why couldn't you just keep your feelings to yourself, huh? Bottle them up inside and drink them away like everyone else does."" Sid muffled through the respirator.

""You just have to express yourself, even if it's angry sometimes."" Isaac said. ""Besides, it's healthier than just punchin' him in his stupid shit eating face, right?""

Sid pulled on their gloves. ""I mean yeah - but at least I wouldn't have got caught up in the aftermath!""

The two laughed, Isaac took out his phone and started playing music - hits from the 80's.
""Well,"" he said ""nothin' to it but to do it.""

Isaac propped open the only other door in the room to get some airflow - another grey metal door with one square window. This door opened outward and led outside to an external staircase that ran down the side of the building to the ground. The first hour of cleaning was spent sweeping the dust from the floor, walls, ceiling, and then floor again. Afterward Sid headed out to the foyer to a door with a faded ""Cleaning"" sign and took stock; brooms, mops, buckets, wipe-alls, shammies, jugs of bleach, trash bag rolls of various sizes, window cleaner, and empty spray bottles - all covered in dust and cobwebs. There was also a big sink with a deep plastic basin.

""Come on you son of a bitch..."" Sid muttered to the sink.

They turned the handle, the pipes sputtered, water ran from the tap - first brown, then merely cloudy.

Sid pumped their fist ""Fuck yeah! Let's go dude!"" they cheered as they grabbed a bucket. 

They put a splash of bleach in and filled it a little over half way, took the bucket and a couple mops, and left the closet. Sid lightly kicked at the door a few times, the sound echoing through the cement foyer.

thud thud thud

""Open up Isaac, I've got the goods!""

The door opened.

""Anything else in that closet?"" Isaac asked.

""Maybe for later,"" Sid said, ""it depends how clean we want to make it in here. I've got wipe-alls and cleaner in the bag, but there's bleach for days in there.""

""We'll see how we feel after a few more hours of this shit."" said Isaac.

After a few more hours of mopping the walls and floors, scraping ancient gum from a corner of the wall by the desk, and scrubbing many dicks drawn in permanent marker off of nearly every surface, Isaac stepped out onto the landing into the cool night air and lit a cigarette.

""You should probably close the door, we don't want Dan smelling the smoke and accusing you of smoking in here."" Sid chuckled.

""Christ! All that power's gone straight to his tiny little head and what does he do? Nothin' but give us a hard fuckin' time, fuckin' Dan...shit's harrasment."" Isaac grumbled - loudly, but mostly to himself - as he kicked the door stopper and closed the door behind him.


Time passed, much longer than a regular smoke break, but Sid didn't mind. The longer Isaac took, the more time they could spend doomscrolling videos on their phone.

thud

The sound of Isaac at the door broke them away from their phone, they put it on the freshly cleaned desk, and walked across the room.

thud

""I'm comin', I'm comin'! Did you smoke the whole pack out there or...what..."" Sid's voice trailed off when they looked at the window of the door.

Isaac was standing at the door, head cocked at a wierd angle facing down, forehead pressed hard against the glass. It looked like twilight outside - that early morning glow - but it was the middle of the night. Isaac tilted backward and flopped bodily at the door.

thud

Sid approached the door. ""Isaac are you okay, what the fuck dude?""

Isaac looked up, half of his face remained pressed against the glass causing a wet squealing sound as he slid his slack-jawed face up, blood from his nose and mouth smearing on the window as he moved. His eye that was away from the door was clouded and dead, half rolled back in his head - the eye up against the window was bulging and bloodshot, unblinking, staring through Sid.

""Isaac! ISAAC!""

They turned the door handle but the door wouldn't open.

""You have to move away from the door Isaac I can't get you!""

Still pressed against the door, Isaac tried the handle.

""open....."" croaked Isaac. Spittle and blood sprayed the glass.

""I'm trying! It's locked, and opens toward you! FUCKIN' MOVE ISAAC!"" Sid screamed at him.

Isaac leaned back from the door, Sid saw the glowing sky. They turned the handle again - the door cracked open - and Isaac slammed full force into the metal door smashing his face into the window, knocking Sid off balance.

THUD

Blood splattered across the window, Isaac's nose cracked and bent viciously against his cheekbone, his forehead split open from the impact, blood gushed from his face and poured down the glass. Sid yelped as they fell away from the door. 

THUD

THUD

THUD

""oPeN!"" Isaac growled through busted teeth and blood.

Sid sat stunned on the concrete floor, tears and snot beginning to roll down their face. Unable to speak. Unable to move. Unable to blink. As Isaac - the one person in this place that they gave a shit about - battered himself against the door over and over again. 

His face was shattered. Through torn skin and flesh, Sid could see the exposed bone of Isaac's skull - it was porous and growths were beginning to form. Inside of the small holes that dotted his skull they could see something moving. This broke their shock. They scrambled up off of the floor and ran toward the entrance.

THUD
""OPEN!""

THUD
""OPEN!""

THUD
""OOOPEN!""


They stood in the service elevator for what felt like forever, listening to the increasingly violent sounds. Sid was afraid that if they took the elevator down, Isaac would hear it start up and follow the noise down the outside staircase. If he did, they would have to go back up and remain at the top of the tower until - hopefully - someone came to help. But if Isaac didn't follow, then this was their only escape plan. 

Sid pressed the button. The elevator rumbled downward, the sounds of belts whirring and metal creaking instantly blocked out the sound of Isaac - Sid couldn't tell if he was still thrashing at the door. It jolted to a stop at the bottom and they stood in the elevator holding their breath for their second forever that night. Echoes of screaming and slamming ricocheted through the building - Sid let out a long sigh, they weren't followed. They slid the elevator door open and, with shakey legs, they left the tower. The air outside was warm, humid, and salty. Looking up at the bright night sky Sid saw the cause of the glow.

High above the clouds, a school of massive bioluminecent jellyfish-like creatures floated wistfully across the sky, their long glowing tentacles reaching the ground. Wherever the tentacles touched, small polyps were deposited. These polyps consumed the matter around them and excreted a substance matching the color of the material, which then hardened into jagged porous coral. As the polyps ate, the coral entwined together - growing upward and outward creating large ridges of dry reefs across the ground, over vehicles, and up the sides of buildings - following the trail of massive creatures gliding peacefully through the night sky.


At the top of the tower, at the door leading to the external staircase, Isaac was fused to the door - polyps eating and excreting. The coral growths from his skull and brain matter twisting together with the glass, his coveralls blending seamlessly with his flesh and the door, stretched out and away from his thick frame - all creating a singular beautiful reef. 

""o...pen..."" wheezed the cluster of coral that was once Isaac.

This goon of a dog had us crying with laughter with his goofy antics, and he also was great on leash, happy to lie beneath the table while we took a coffee break, and did great navigating other dogs and people.

Churro is super dog social and has even been used as a help dog at the shelter! He is also over the moon to make new human friends and fancies himself a 60 lb lap dog. Churro's only struggle last week was cars - they scared him a bit, which mostly resulted in him trying to hide behind us and needing to take a few breaks from walking near a road. He's very smart and treat motivated, and I'm sure this will improve with exposure, patience, and many treats and pets.

The bumps on his face are benign but we suspect are part of the reason he's been overlooked since October - that and the brown pittie thing. Please feel free to ask me any questions!

Fast forward, I‚Äôm in a relationship with Matt (25M). We‚Äôve been living together for 3 years. Things are great. He‚Äôs so supportive and always wants to listen and make me feel loved even when times are tough. We get along really well.

Here why I‚Äôm conflicted and need advice. I loved Dave and have always been so attracted to him. I just hate how things ended and how he treated me sometimes. With Matt, everything is good except I‚Äôm not very attracted to him anymore as much. But love other things about him.

Any advice would be great! Do I meet my ex for coffee and see what he has to say? Or ignore him and just focus on what I have now and be happy with that? Thanks!

So you can make maybe 50 drinks from drip, to lattes, cortado, doppio, less strong...more, frothy, milky, this that... to espresso...etc etc etc...BUT...You have to do them ALL with 1 type of bean!! lol!! BECAUSE you didnt get the end-all Giga.
My Gigi!...Really?
Who in the world was the GENIUS to come up with a $4000 machine that uses a SINGLE type of bean to make 50+ drinks?!!!

Would it be so hard to add a few grams of plastic to separate what beans go in the grinder?

Also, does this have a bipass to use your own grinders ground coffee? Not sure on this one.

Has anyone come up with a hack for this, maybe print a 2 chamber cover with door? So you either have to down grade to J8, or go Giga!
AND, you cant even get the Giga in silver. SO if you want a lighter color, you cant go giga.

Its just a bit frustrating. Its no problem to return the machine. Maybe get the Giga, have the body painted silver in a proper way. Really odd to not have a color option.

‚ÄúFor physical training is of some value, but godliness has value for all things, holding promise for both the present life and the life to come.‚Äù
1 Timothy 4:8


Reflection:
Be honest‚Äîwhich gets more attention: your body or your soul? We know our coffee order by heart but stumble through prayer. We track every workout but can't remember when we last opened our Bible. We'll wake at 5 AM for the gym but hit snooze on time with God.
Paul isn't shaming us‚Äîhe's freeing us. Physical training has value, absolutely. But those muscles peak and fade. That beach body ages. Those medals tarnish. Godliness? That's the only investment that appreciates forever.
Watch the strongest Christians you know. They radiate peace in Monday morning traffic. They forgive before the sun sets. They give generously when spreadsheets say save. They find joy on ordinary Tuesdays. Their secret isn't complicated: daily deposits. Five-minute morning prayers. Choosing worship over worry. Speaking life instead of complaints. These aren't religious checkboxes‚Äîthey're investments earning eternal interest.
Here's the promise that changes everything: godliness pays you TODAY and FOREVER. That unexplainable peace during your busiest season? That's your dividend. That joy despite disappointments? That's compound interest working. Every prayer builds resilience. Every act of faith adds strength.
Start small today. One verse. One grateful thought. One kind word. These tiny choices create spiritual giants who handle anything with grace.
Your body is temporary. Your soul is forever. What a beautiful perspective shift.
Ask Yourself:
‚Ä¢	Where do my daily routines show I‚Äôm investing‚Äîbody or soul?

I moved here three years ago, and I‚Äôve got this epiphany today that I‚Äôve never ever have been invited for a dinner or lunch or some activity for a date. Only drinks (two cocktails or two beers) or coffee or walk in the park.

I‚Äôve dressed up nicely, I had casual outfit, doesn‚Äôt matter. I paid for the whole date, I paid 50/50, for the last half a year I don‚Äôt offer to pay for drinks. I invited men to concerts a few times, to the cinema, me buying the tickets. Just because I wanted to go there with not just girls.

I do date actively- I‚Äôve met around 20 men in total or more over this period of time . What I only hear is that I‚Äôm ‚Äúhot and so fun‚Äù, sexy but that‚Äôs it. The second date would be ‚Äúcome to my place‚Äù, if not the first date, and if it would last for longer, it‚Äôd always be straight at the house/flat. So, straight to sex. A couple of times one guy invited me to his flat cooking a dinner, it‚Äôs his hobby. That‚Äôs max I‚Äôve had.

I hear from my friends that they go on these fancy dates, fly to vacations, read on Reddit about what people do during the dates etc - and it‚Äôs now shocking to me that I‚Äôve never ever had it since I moved to England! I live in London but I‚Äôve travelled quite a lot in England and met people in different places.

It‚Äôs not that I can‚Äôt pay for myself, I just want to have this experience. I‚Äôve met some cool people of age from 29 to 55. I‚Äôm F38.

Mostly I use a Pure app, cause that‚Äôs kind of people I like hanging out with, I also used to Tinder and Hinge. This community doesn‚Äôt allow to add the pics but I swear I look good and very fit.

That‚Äôs my recent profile description from Pure app:

I was stuck in a cycle: my numbers crept up,  I was given more insulin, and I put on more weight. This led to worse numbers,  so more insulin and more weight. 

I ended up starting ozempic a few years ago and with it I lost about 30 pounds, give or take and my numbers went down to an A1C of 7.2. 

The last year and a half, I've had COVID so the numbers went back up, to which my new endo insists I need more insulin. Guess what happened? Gained about 10-15 pounds back, and my numbers are getting worse (I think my last A1C was 9). 

Has this happened to anyone else? How have you gotten your medical team to understand that the insulin has always made things worse? I'm frustrated because we've delayed a family this whole time, it's too late for one now, and I don't think anyone is understanding me. 

Edited to add since it was brought up: since starting the ozempic, I can't eat as much as I could before. If I had to quantify it, I can't finish a kids sized meal in one sitting unless I'm starving. We've cut back on fast food a lot and pushing more vegetables when we're at home. Cut out sugar soda but still drink diet, a can 5/7 days a week, otherwise it's water (don't drink, no coffee or tea).

 Exercise is walking my dogs most nights for 30 minutes, and a decently long hike every weekend (minimum 90 minutes, lower end of moderate exertion). And I work in special education at an elementary so a good bit of chasing tiny people.

I‚Äôve been here briefly in the past and i remember providence havjng some of the most unique and delicious coffee. I kinda wanna do a little throughout the day coffee tour.

So drop your favorite coffee places.
Also looking for amazing pastries (almond croissant, donuts, custard based treats).
And a solid dinner. Maybe seafood related but open to anything.

And also a good spot to kinda spend the day popping into shops and sight seeing possible water views? Something walkable or within reasonable driving distances from each other.

Thanks :)

I (45f) was off the apps last 2 months as work was crazy. Downloaded hinge this week and matched with a guy 45M. He sounded really good. Similar interests, background, able to hold a conversation. I don‚Äôt usually go for men with kids but he convinced me that they are independent enough. He is separated since last 4 years. 
He asked me to meet so I met him last night. Inspite of having kids, I felt since I‚Äôm into breaking patterns these days so - it‚Äôs just a date, let‚Äôs meet. Scheduled a coffee date.

1. We met, he was on time. Had a great conversation. I had a time limit in my head of 1 hour. It was all going great. Then I asked him about his kids. The arrangement he has with his ex sounded good. Then he told that he is still married to her. Though they live apart since 2 years and he emotionally detached since 4 years..he is lazy about paperwork and didn‚Äôt opt for divorce. I asked him
If he plans to, and he replied - yes this year. And apparently his wife is all to blame in this. He took zero responsibility of the marriage. 

Tbh he could have told me this before we met. It put me off so bad!! For me this looks like a man who isn‚Äôt ready to let go of the past but at same time wants new excitement in life. Get some hobbies?!? Build a better social life?!? Please stop wasting peoples time !! If you are still legally married , you have no business being on a dating app while not disclosing this information.

2. I didn‚Äôt want to get into any argument with him so I just listened to whatever he said. I soon decided to leave in an amicable way, so I said goodbye pleasantly. I was not in mood to hug as well but trying to keep it pleasant. He pulled me strongly for a hug and then went in for a kiss. This was soooooo disgusting. I turned my face away reactively and he kissed my cheek. Men, please do not initiate physical contact especially on first date unless the girl does it. 

3. It was simple coffee date but when we entered , he said he will pay for me. I replied - it‚Äôs ok , I can pay for myself n then guy went - sure. I‚Äôm happy to pay for myself always n actually have on many dates. But I do see this as a gauge of how much of a gentleman a guy is especially since it‚Äôs an inexpensive coffee. I pay for my friends many times so if I was a guy, I would happily pay for one on a first date. I know this always causes a big debate but it definitely is an indication of the qualities in a guy and whether he knows how to treat a prospective partner in his life. 

Anyhow I came back home and he has already texted that he wants to see me again and would want to meet the very next day. I politely told him that I don‚Äôt want to continue seeing a married guy. And that‚Äôs that! Arghh!

Of all of this , I‚Äôm glad I broke the pattern and gave someone a try who isn‚Äôt my type. Also I moved on quick and already scheduled another date this weekend with another guy I have been talking to. ",6,1748649747.0,dating,12,1.0,False

1kzje9i,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kzje9i/theyre_taking_everything/,They're taking everything,"Two months. That‚Äôs how long the ink had been dry on our marriage certificate when my wife, Sarah, and I found ourselves in Portugal, the sun-drenched landscape a stark, beautiful contrast to the life we‚Äôd known. The honeymoon was her idea ‚Äì a chance to escape, to breathe. Portugal was a revelation, its rugged coastline and ancient forests were truly a magnificent feat. Walking deep into its wilderness stirred something primal in us, a longing for the untouched, the untamed.

On our third day, under a sky filled with colors unseen before, we met Andre. He was a local, his eyes holding the kind of knowing glint that speaks of generations tied to the land. He told us, his voice low and conspiratorial, about an abandoned warehouse, nestled some five miles into the dense forest. A local legend, he called it. Couples who ventured there, he said, always found one of two things. A ring, symbolising a tranquil, unending union. Or a blank piece of paper, an omen of divorce, of separation.

We laughed it off, of course. Relics of an older, more superstitious time. Of course. Yet, the allure of the adventure, the mystery of it, tugged at us. A shared experience, a story to tell. So, around three in the afternoon, with the sun beginning its slow descent, we set off.

The forest was a living cathedral, sunlight dappling through leaves like stained glass. The deeper we ventured, the more potent its magic became. There was an unnerving stillness to it, an ancient silence that seemed to swallow sound. That unexplained feeling of safety I‚Äôd initially felt began to curdle into something less comforting, a sense of being observed by unseen eyes.

After what felt like an eternity, close to two and a half hours of pushing through dense wilderness, a flash of white against the green. A rusty, corrugated chunk of metal, stark and jarring against the organic beauty. ""This is it!"" Sarah whispered, her voice tight with a mixture of excitement and something I couldn't quite name ‚Äì perhaps apprehension. Her smile, usually so wide and effortless, seemed a little strained.

The structure loomed, more dilapidated and sinister up close than I‚Äôd imagined. We forced open a massive, rusty sliding door, its screech echoing like a tortured animal. A peculiar smell met us ‚Äì damp earth, decay, and something else, something metallic and faintly sweet, that I still can‚Äôt identify. It clung to the back of my throat.

Our phone flashlights cut feeble paths through the gloom, illuminating empty, dust-laden shelves and decaying crates. Then, in a far corner, tucked away on the lowest shelf, I saw it: a small, somewhat inviting red box. I called Sarah over. Together, with a shared glance, we lifted the lid. Disappointment, sharp and immediate. Inside, nestled on faded velvet, lay a crumbling, yellowed piece of paper. ""It doesn't mean anything,"" Sarah said, her voice flat, the earlier excitement extinguished. She turned, already moving towards the light of the open door. I nodded, agreeing outwardly, but a strange compulsion made me linger.

I picked up the paper. It wasn‚Äôt blank, as the legend had threatened. A wave of foolish relief washed over me ‚Äì the superstition was just that. But the relief was a fleeting thing, dissolving into a cold dread as my eyes focused on the messy, looping script. It was Sarah‚Äôs handwriting. Unmistakably. And it read: ""You Set Me Free.""

My blood ran cold. Sarah was with me. She hadn‚Äôt been here before. This wasn't some prank. The air in the warehouse suddenly felt heavy, suffocating. I decided, in that instant, not to show her, not to let this taint the rest of our trip. I pocketed the note, the crumbling paper strangely cold against my skin.

Three days later, we were back in New Orleans. The first night in our own bed should have been a comfort. I remember the familiar scent of our linens, the weight of the city settling outside our window. But that was the night the whispers began. Not from somewhere distant. From right beside me. From Sarah. ""I'm free,"" she murmured, her voice a soft, ethereal hiss in the darkness. ""I'm free... I'm free."" She didn't stop. I tried to wake her, gently at first, then with more urgency, to the point I was shaking here almost violently. Her eyes remained closed, her breathing even, but the words kept spilling out. As I shook her, panic beginning to claw at my throat. No response. I reached for my phone, my fingers fumbling for the emergency number, when a sharp, sickening *snap*¬†echoed from her direction. I turned, phone light wavering, and saw her shoulder contorted at an impossible angle. Another snap, from her elbow this time. Her body began to twitch, to bend in ways that defied anatomy, a grotesque marionette pulled by unseen strings. Before I could scream, before I could even process the horrifying ballet unfolding before my eyes, her distorted form was jerked from the bed. It was dragged, violently, across the floor towards the hallway, a dark stain of blood blossoming on the polished wood beneath her. I scrambled after her, lunging, managing to grasp her hand. Her skin was cold, unnaturally so. I pulled, resisting the invisible force with a strength born of terror and desperate love. It pulled harder. Then, in a nauseating instant, an immense, irresistible force yanked her away. I was left kneeling, clutching her severed arm, blood warm and slick against my palm. The rest of her body receded down the hallway, which seemed to stretch, to elongate into an impossible, swallowing darkness. She faded, and then she was gone. 

The silence that followed was absolute, save for my own ragged, choked breaths and the rhythmic drip of blood from the limb I still held. Her wedding ring glinted. I don‚Äôt remember much of the next few hours. Shock is a merciful anaesthetic. Eventually, I placed her arm in the bathtub, covering it with a towel. A futile, insane gesture. I didn‚Äôt call the police. What could I say? I must have collapsed from exhaustion, from the sheer weight of the situation.

When I woke, pale morning light was filtering through the bedroom window. The house was eerily silent. The first thing I noticed was the hallway. It was normal. Just a hallway. For a wild, desperate moment, I thought perhaps it had all been a monstrous nightmare. Then I saw the bloodstain on the floor, already drying to a dark, accusatory brown. Her arm‚Ä¶ I stumbled to the bathroom. The towel was there. But the arm was gone. A new, deeper chill settled into my bones. I walked through the house like a ghost. It wasn't just her arm. The living room was bare. The sofa, the coffee table, the bookshelves filled with our shared histories ‚Äì all gone. The kitchen: appliances, utensils, even the magnets from our travels that had adorned the refrigerator ‚Äì vanished. Every room was a hollow echo of what it had been. Photographs from the walls, clothes from the closets, the very scent of our life together ‚Äì erased. It wasn‚Äôt a burglary. There was no forced entry, no mess, just‚Ä¶ absence. A meticulous, supernatural emptying. They were taking everything. My gaze fell upon the small, red box from the warehouse, which I‚Äôd inexplicably brought back, now sitting alone on the dusty patch where our dresser used to be. Inside, the note.¬†*‚ÄúYou Set Me Free.‚Äù*¬†My trembling fingers traced the messy script, then moved lower. There it was, fainter this time, almost invisible, scratched beneath her words.¬†*‚ÄúAndre.‚Äù*¬†A name that now tasted like ash in my mouth. A clue to a horror I couldn't comprehend, let alone fight.

I don‚Äôt know what will be taken when I wake up again, but I feel like I have nothing more to lose. Everything is already gone - my wife, my home, my sanity. They're taking everything.",3,1748649516.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

I just went out with a friend who paid for the food that I ate and then we even went to get coffee and donuts after.

I also improvised a small bellow contraption with a turkey baster. In addition to fight grounds retention, I sealed with double sided tape the underside of the burrs, I silicone molded the rectangular corner on the exit chute, and filed down some machining imperfections. 

So far, reduced retention 1 full gram. Thinking on designing and modifying another chute, but... to the future.  

In the meantime, I'll try and learn to dial in what I have.

I have 3 different types of coffee. I tried my full roast, it's close to a month old now, and it's the first time I got the proper amount at the right time. Very tasty

Not a bitter taste. Very balanced. 

I'm afraid it's the finest I can grind, as a little extra piece turn to the dial and I start to hear the discs bitting. So, no finner adjustment for the moment. 

Anyone having this grinder, care to share some tips ? I know I can get a better result with properly aligned burrs. I suspect the burrs are old also. 

Tho with slightly lighter roasted coffee, I think I need finer grinds. But again, It looks like I can't go finer now. 

Overall, very happy :) still need a tamp, tho. And maybe other little stuff. But I'm very happy with what I upgrade to. ",2,1748649053.0,espresso,0,0.75,False

So I‚Äôve always just been sent on my way to deal with it. And what I‚Äôve done when I‚Äôve notice I have them is crouch down all the way to the floor and hug my knees, and it goes away within a few ish seconds and I‚Äôm back to doing whatever I was doing. It‚Äôs just something I‚Äôve figured out to do on my own no one told me.\
Recently within the past few years, I‚Äôve been hearing about heart monitors and people getting them for these types of things so I got some health insurance about two years ago and didn‚Äôt use it the first year and I was having some crazy palpitations then.\
This year I‚Äôve only had 4 total so far, Jan 1st, Apr 1st and May 26 & 27. The reason for the 3 month gap is I stopped drinking coffee, (seems to be my biggest main trigger) Finally this year/month I was able to get to a cardiologist and got a heart monitor put on for four weeks. Nothing was happening for weeks, then the second last and the last day (may 26&27) that I had it on, I got a palpitation. (Thank god) but I had to trigger the palpitation by drinking coffee for a week straight with extra shot of espresso, not drinking water and not eating as much as I was and stopped working out. Since February 1st, I‚Äôve been working out at HOTWORX and have been feeling like it‚Äôs actually been helping my heart because I‚Äôve been drinking more electrolytes and water and eating more food than I was before and less coffee.\
I cried when the doc called me today to tell me what‚Äôs actually wrong with me. It‚Äôs like all my issues actually have a solution now. After like 15 years of not knowing what‚Äôs wrong and just thinking it‚Äôs anxiety I now know and it‚Äôs so relieving! He put me on Metropol? 25mg to slow my heart rate down?

[Compared with the original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1kwl5q8/first_impressions_no_bypass_sibarist_fast_vs_orea/), there have been a few key changes, but the core brewing parameters remain consistent:

1. ZeroWater with Lotus Bright/Juicy recipe (82ppm) ‚Äì *same as OG*.
2. Zerno Z1 with 64mm SSP MP blind burrs ‚Äì *same as OG*.
3. The coffee is now an Anaerobic Fermented, Brazil Microlot 34, from the Minas Gerais region (Brazil), roasted by Wild Kaffee (5/19/2025). [Link](https://wild-kaffee.com/en-eu/products/brasil-microlot-34).
4. Grind Size 450 microns for both brews (vs. 490 in OG).
5. 93¬∞C water. 40s bloom (60ml) -> 1st pour +60ml -> 2nd pour at 1:20s +50ml -> 3rd pour at 2:00s +100ml.
6. No Melodrip/Melodrip Lift.

* The shot at 10:23 is the one using the Orea Wave filter.
* The shot at 15:31 is the one using the Sibarist FAST.

Even with limited experience using the Sibarist, I shaved about 10 seconds off the TBT, clocking in at 2:43 compared to the Orea Wave's 2:53. Taste-wise, both cups were very enjoyable, with neither feeling over-extracted or bitter. The Sibarist produced a more vibrant acidity, though both shared the same lemon notes. Might be placebo :-D the Sibarist cup overall was a tad more enjoyable.

I'm definitely like these filters. I still have to figure out which specific coffees will benefit most from them versus the Orea Wave (especially considering the Sibarist are about 3 times the cost of the Orea ones where I am). I guess this will come with more time and experience.",1,1748648568.0,pourover,1,0.67,False

When Churro isn't performing his one-dog comedy show, he can be found taking dirt naps in the dog park, sneaking all the snuggles he can, and taking his toys along for loose leash walks. He's been exceptionally social with other dogs at the shelter and is over the moon whenever he meets a new human friend.

When we took Churro for a Hounds Around Town adventure, he did a beautiful job checking in with his handlers, fitting in at the crowded park, and waiting politely under the table at while we took a coffee break. He didn't love the noise of cars driving by, but Churro is smart and treat motivated, and I'm sure this will ease up with love, patience, and time outside the shelter. 

In the past month, two of our longest term residents have gone home (yay Marigold and Pedro!) and the Hounds Around Town program helped make that happen!

Did I do it too soon and not give it enough time?","Hey bros, I‚Äôm a 26M and just got out of a 3 month situationship with a 25M. We had a great emotional and intellectual connection since January however from the 3rd date onwards he told me that he didn‚Äôt know whether he was physically attracted to me. However we continued dating, saw each other more often and ended up in a relationship, since beginning of April. 

But then a lot of things happened. Such as the fact that he was on Grindr while we had been dating exclusively, and then gaslighted me into stating that ‚Äòdating exclusively‚Äô doesn‚Äôt entail refraining from using dating apps ‚Äî especially a painful thing for me since my previous ex bf used to be on Grindr during our relationship without me knowing. But also: my bf never called me any sweet names, never asked any deep questions about me, never introduced me to any friends.

Just for information - we did have great sex and he was absolutely very (conventionally) handsome.

So when, end of April, I was alone in his house, I had the opportunity to look into his journal. I know I shouldn‚Äôt have but I did. It contained notes about him feeling ‚Äòsexually repulsive‚Äô about me and my physical body (including my posture and my dick), about me taking up too much space (including eating and showering), about me wanting too much attention and confirmation for his part. He also wrote that it‚Äôs internalized homophobia as he ‚Äòdoesn‚Äôt want to be seen as the same kind of gay as I am, which is not as sportive and bourgeois.‚Äô 

I was so confused and anxious about reading this that in an impulse, I broke up with him later that day.

After that we had been in touch for another two weeks, discussing whether we should give it another shot. In the end he called things off because he said that he‚Äôd never been in love.

But here‚Äôs the thing. I‚Äôm ruminating whether I cut things off too soon. Did I not give him any shot at falling in love with me? Did I need to give it more time? Should I have waited to see what would happen and develop? What do you think? 

I‚Äôm especially ruminating because I never had this intense emotional connection with anyone and - as he told me - neither did he.

Okay, Reddit, I've been on a quest for the perfect leggings.  You know the struggle ‚Äì  the constant battle against saggy butts, uncomfortable seams, and leggings that pill after one wash.  I've spent a fortune on different brands, from cheap ones that fell apart to expensive ones that just didn't fit right.  I was starting to think maybe leggings just weren't for me.

Then, I saw these white scrunch leggings.  I'll admit, white leggings seemed risky. But I was desperate, and honestly, they've been a total revelation.  It's not just that they're cute (though they are!), it's the scrunch design.  It's not just a fashion statement; it actually works.  It's strategically placed to give your butt a real lift.  I'm not kidding ‚Äì I took before-and-after pictures (DM me if you want to see!), and the difference is crazy. It's like a subtle, comfortable lift without the torture of shapewear.  Seriously, I hate shapewear; it feels so restrictive!  These leggings give you that same effect without feeling like you're squeezed into a sausage casing.

I wear these leggings everywhere.  To the grocery store, the gym, even just lounging around the house. They're unbelievably comfy. The fabric is this amazing stretchy blend ‚Äì it's flexible but not flimsy.  They've held up amazingly after tons of washes; no pilling or stretching out whatsoever. I was so impressed with how durable they are.  I even wore them on a recent hike, and they were perfect! No riding up or chafing ‚Äì a huge win for me.

What surprised me most was how versatile they are.  These aren't just for workouts. I've dressed them up with a flowy blouse and sandals for a casual date night.  They're perfect for running errands, grabbing coffee with friends, or even a casual lunch with my mom. They're seriously the perfect blend of comfort and style. I feel way more confident wearing them, and that's a huge deal.  It's a confidence boost I didn't expect, and that‚Äôs worth more than a fancy dinner, honestly.

And the price? They're not outrageously expensive. I found them on ursupermart.com. They're not the cheapest leggings ever, but the quality, the fit, and that amazing butt lift? Totally worth it. I've probably spent more on shapewear over the years than these leggings cost. Plus, you save on the monthly shapewear expense.  Trust me, you won't regret the splurge.  They're a much better investment.

If you're tired of leggings that make you feel frumpy or insecure, you really should check these out. They're a game-changer for me. I'm thinking of getting another pair in black, maybe even trying one of their other colors.  These high-waisted scrunch leggings are perfect for smaller butts like mine, providing amazing support and a real lift. I felt instantly more confident and comfortable. They're a lifesaver for days when you want to feel good about yourself without sacrificing comfort. I even wore them to a wedding shower recently, paired with a cute tunic and heels ‚Äì they looked surprisingly dressy!

Here's the link if you're curious: https://go.ursupermart.com/9WTtpq

I've tried so many different styles of leggings, and these are by far my absolute favorites. The quality is amazing, the fit is perfect, and the butt lift is seriously impressive. They're comfortable enough for all-day wear, yet stylish enough to dress up or down. I've gotten so many compliments on them already.  They're a total wardrobe staple for me now. I wear them at least three times a week. They‚Äôre so versatile. They're perfect for everything from a casual coffee date to a more dressed-up dinner. I even wear them to yoga! They're surprisingly supportive for downward-facing dog!  Seriously, I can't recommend these white scrunch leggings enough. They're comfortable, flattering, and make me feel good. They're a great addition to any wardrobe. I feel so much more confident wearing them, and that‚Äôs priceless.  I honestly feel like I can conquer the world in these leggings. They've made my everyday life a little brighter, a little more confident, and a lot more comfortable.

I've probably spent more on shapewear over the years than these leggings cost. Plus, you save on the monthly shapewear expense! Trust me, you won't regret the splurge.  They're a much better long-term investment.

If you're tired of leggings that make you feel frumpy or insecure, you really should check these out.  They're a game-changer for me. I'm thinking of getting another pair in black, maybe even trying one of their other colors.  These high-waisted scrunch leggings are perfect for smaller butts like mine, providing amazing support and a real lift. I felt instantly more confident and comfortable. They're a lifesaver for those days when you want to feel good about yourself without sacrificing comfort. I even wore them to a wedding shower recently, paired with a cute tunic and heels ‚Äì they looked surprisingly dressy!

I've tried so many different styles of leggings, and these are, hands down, my absolute favorites. The quality is amazing, the fit is perfect, and the butt lift is seriously impressive. They're comfortable enough for all-day wear, yet stylish enough to dress up or down. I've gotten so many compliments on them already. They're a total wardrobe staple for me now. I wear them at least three times a week. They‚Äôre so versatile. They're perfect for everything from a casual coffee date to a dressier dinner. I even wear them to yoga! They're surprisingly supportive for downward-facing dog! Seriously, I can't recommend these white scrunch leggings enough. They're comfortable, flattering, and make me feel good. They're a great addition to any wardrobe. I feel so much more confident wearing them, and that‚Äôs priceless. I honestly feel like I can conquer the world in these leggings. They've made my everyday life a little brighter, a little more confident, and a lot more comfortable. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions. üòä

1kzixuo,https://www.reddit.com/r/eShoppingUSA/comments/1kzixuo/leggings_lift_butt_white_scrunch_leggings_review/,Leggings Lift Butt: White Scrunch Leggings Review!,"**Leggings That Actually Lift Your Butt?! (Honest Review) - White Scrunch Leggings**


Okay, Reddit, I need to spill the tea on these leggings.  I'm usually a jeans-and-a-tshirt kind of gal, but lately, I've been trying to get more into athleisure.  The problem?  Most leggings just‚Ä¶aren't flattering.  They either sag in all the wrong places, or they're so tight they're uncomfortable.  I've tried a ton of different brands, from cheap ones to pricey ones, and I was starting to lose hope.

Then, I stumbled across these white scrunch leggings.  I know, white leggings?  Risky, right?  But I was desperate.  And let me tell you, these are NOT your average white leggings.  The scrunch design is what really sets them apart.  It's strategically placed ‚Äì not just a random scrunch anywhere ‚Äì and it seriously lifts and shapes your butt.  I'm talking a noticeable difference.  I even took before-and-after photos, and wow.  It's like having a little built-in lift.

Now, I'm not one for shapewear, those things are suffocating!  These leggings provide the same effect without the discomfort. I can wear these all day, doing errands, going to the gym, even just lounging around the house.  They're surprisingly comfortable.  The fabric is a really nice blend ‚Äì feels stretchy and durable, not thin and cheap.  I‚Äôve worn them multiple times, and they haven't pilled or stretched out at all.

What surprised me the most is how versatile they are.  These aren't just for workouts. They‚Äôre great for casual wear! I've dressed them up a bit with a flowy blouse and sandals for a date night. They're perfect for grocery shopping,  running errands, or even grabbing a quick coffee with friends.  They‚Äôre honestly the perfect combination of comfort and style. They instantly make me feel more confident, and that's worth more than a fancy dinner out, for real.

Another big plus?  They're not crazy expensive. I found them on ursupermart.com.  Sure, they're not the cheapest leggings on the market, but for the quality, the fit, and the actual butt-lifting magic they perform, they‚Äôre totally worth the price. The cost of shapewear alone over the years would have probably paid for several pairs of these.  And trust me, you won't regret splurging.

So, if you're tired of leggings that make you feel frumpy or insecure, do yourself a favor and check these out.  They really are game-changers.  I'm actually considering ordering another pair in black, and maybe even trying out one of the other colors they offer.  I know what I‚Äôm doing with my next payday, LOL.  These high-waisted scrunch leggings are perfect for small butts, like mine, providing amazing support, and lifting the booty. I felt instantly more confident and comfortable.  Seriously, these things are a lifesaver for days when you want to feel good about yourself, in a casual and comfortable outfit.

**I've already drafted both passages, so I just need help deciding which conversation path is better for the plot and character development.**

**Opt.1:**¬†*""I headed past her, further into the restaurant, and picked a stool by the bar next to another customer. Someone from the kitchen slid in a menu next to me after I'd sat down, and just then I heard a voice ask me, ""Long day of driving, huh?""*  
*I looked over to find the same guy sitting beside me: probably in his late thirties, wearing a cyan button-up, and khaki pants. He had short, ginger hair and unshaven stubble. ""Where are you headed?"" I wondered aloud.*  
*""I'm headed up north to make a delivery. What about you?"" He replied.*  
*I occasionally take hour-long road trips, but I don't think I could willingly handle a job with so much driving like his. I'd get carsick too quickly. ""I'm a staffer at Ironbark State Park,"" I told him fondly,*  
*The man then pressed, ""So is it true?"" I hummed, questioning. I had no idea what he was asking me about. ""Whatever they say happened to those kids the other day?"" He clarified.*  
*""What?"" Before that, I hadn't heard anything noteworthy about kids in the woods.*  
*""I need to go."" The conversation was over then. An odd, unprompted end to it if you ask me...""*

**Opt.2:**¬†*""I headed past her, a little further into the restaurant, and picked a stool by the bar next to another customer. Someone from the kitchen slid in a menu next to me after I'd sat down, and just then I heard a voice speak up, ""You look a little lost.""*  
*I looked over to find the same guy sitting beside me: probably in his late thirties, wearing a black suit and tie. He had short, walnut hair, bushy eyebrows, and unshaven stubble. ""Just tired,"" I answered quite honestly.*  
*""This place has some great coffee, if you're in the mood for one."" He told me.*  
*I only nodded. Caffeine doesn't usually taste right on my tongue, it doesn't sit right in my stomach, and it makes me too shaky after I drink it. I wasn't a fan.*  
*The man went on, ""As you can see, I usually go for a vanilla latte."" I didn't answer again.*  
*""So where are you headed?""*  
*This time I replied, ""Starting my new job at a nearby state park."" Around this time, I started to take a look at the menu that the worker handed me.*  
*""Ah, that's great, I didn't know these jobs still existed."" That comment sort of surprised me. I would say they're still fairly common. At least, camp counselor gigs are..*  
*""What do you do?"" I wondered.*  
*The man seemed happy to answer, ""I work in finance. I'm a financial analyst for a big firm downtown.""*  
*""That sounds interesting."" Around this time, I started to get bored with the interaction. Small talk isn't really my thing.*  
*""Yeah, it's challenging, but I enjoy it. It keeps me busy, that's for sure.""*¬†  
*Man, and all I have to do is sit in a cozy cabin for a couple of weeks to look out for smoke. I may be alone the entire time, but nature isn't bad company. ""'That's impressive."" I thought aloud.*  
*""Yeah, I guess so. It can be a bit of a rollercoaster sometimes, but I don't hate what I do.""*

*He took a sip of his drink, and our conversation came to an end then. I decided on my order about a minute later.""*

Hello, 

After realizing that the official B3 TikTok page had unfollowed me over the weekend, I can no longer calculate the benefits of being part of this organization being greater than the distress it has caused me as a member.¬†

While this may seem a small and insignificant thing, after seeing who the page still follows, it felt like a personal slight against me and honestly the straw that broke my already weakened back.

While I found this a minor slight in comparison to many I‚Äôve received, I couldn‚Äôt help but reflect on the numerous times I have felt disrespected by this organization. This list is obviously truncated and missing many instances, but I wanted to highlight just a few.


Disrespect towards me:
* Shoving me at (show) Parade (a director should never be putting their hands on someone else in this manner) while I may have gotten an apology from you three years later, it STILL weighs on my mind that I had to confront you personally to demand that apology¬†

* Joking about how ‚Äúsome people have a problem with me having to be a boss bitch today‚Äù to our organization directly after confronting me to reframe the interaction as ‚ÄúI did not push you, I led you‚Äù¬†

* Knowing that you went out after the (show) parade and talked to many people about our interaction and how I was in the wrong and asking them to agree

* Telling other people that ‚Äú(member) doesn‚Äôt get DLD style and make dances too difficult‚Äù while at a sleepover that only select members of the team were invited to before a boot camp social¬†

* Snapping at me personally at the (show) when I asked if you wanted us to stand on stage to mark spots since we had limited time and access to stage and your group had arrived late

* Giving the impression that I was not willing to return your key to you when I always had it ready to give back to you then snapping at me saying ‚Äúwell I was pretty busy‚Äù after I mentioned I hadn‚Äôt found the right time over the (event) weekend to give it to you

* Verbally berating (member) at (show) for her hair to the point where she left (show) and did not participate because she was in tears

* Expectations of having team members buy merchandise just to match on DLD outings 


Evidence of me being a 360 degree boot sister during my time at DLD:
* Providing technical support during any class

* Being a frequent substitute instructor

* Being a performance mentor for two years

* Frequently posting and reposting official DLD pictures and videos¬†

* Unpaid moderation during live streams to help maintain a safe space for our boot sisters onscreen and in chat.¬†


I think what I find most disappointing is that the overwhelming majority of the women in our organization do live and breathe our mission statement but our own leader frequently does not. You seem to be a habitual offender of talking badly about others and using your own influence to punish others if they behave in ways that seem to offend you. We spend most of our time tip-toeing around you to not provoke you into being mean towards us for some offense that you‚Äôve taken.¬†

Your influence and directives seem to have impacted people on our team such as (member), who seems to be becoming more and more like you every year and without the moniker of owner, coach, and choreographer behind it, she comes off as insensitive, mean, and sometimes offensive to others. It has ruffled feathers not only here in Seattle, but elsewhere. To be frankly honest, she is overworked and looks run down and it has caused her dancing to visibly worsen and health to obviously suffer this year.¬†

The entire situation with (member) could have been avoided and the awkwardness of this year minimized had you been able to squash it earlier but you doubled down and sided with her and cast aside the rest of the team and people who have been your friend and by your side for years. People who have always fiercely defended you publicly and privately and only ever lived and breathed the mission and values of this organization.¬†

I have stayed as long as I have for the friendships that I have made but I pay to be part of this organization and no longer find the value greater than the fees you make us pay both financially and emotionally. I have already communicated my feelings about financial monetary expectation fatigue in my year end review. I highly implore you to consider my thoughts and the lack of financial transparency as a whole inside of this organization.¬†

But, as you seem to love to remind us, this is your business and you can run it as you see fit. Let me provide you some reassurance that this so-called ‚Äúbad apple‚Äù will no longer be one of your many concerns.¬†

Thanks for the memories,
(member)¬†

p.s. (member) has collected my dance bag, rain jacket, pink sparkle, and miscellaneous extras, and will return them to you at practice. I have contacted the (redacted) to try and turn off my auto pay but I would very much appreciate the assurance of the discontinuation of being billed for this organization.¬†",4,1748647192.0,bootboogiebabesSNARK,1,1.0,False

This one is a bit long but I really need advice.

I (M 41) was widowed last year and recently moved across the country for a fresh start in January. I downloaded a few dating apps and began dating & meeting people in my new city. 

After meeting a few different women, I began dating a girl ( K 25) but things ended after about a month and I‚Äôm trying to figure out if I‚Äôm the AH.

Info: after the first time or 2 that we hung out, she tried to end things due to personal issues that she didn‚Äôt want to expose me to. Things like her feeling insecure about me being financially established and her being a student with no income. She also told me that she struggles with BPD, ADHD, anxiety, depression, and an anxious attachment style. She said these are things I should be aware of if I decide to pursue her, and also told me that she‚Äôs likely to run away from a good thing out of fear.

After she told me this, I asked her to give us a chance and not throw the towel in yet and she agreed. We had talked about exclusively seeing and being intimate with each other and that was agreed on. When we had that conversation, she was not still on dating apps but I was still communicating with a few people on these apps and told her that I was informing people I had been conversing with that I was no longer seeking anything.

I could tell that me continuing to be on the apps bothered her, so I deleted all of the apps in front of her in hopes of showing her that I was serious about the exclusivity and we moved forward. After that things were mostly good, but a few points of contention arose.

She was upset because there were 2 women  from the new city who I met on the dating apps before her that I was still in contact with as friends. With one, things didn‚Äôt work out because she wanted to explore a more open or polyamorous dating style and I don‚Äôt want that, but we remained friendly and in contact. The second woman and I decided mutually that we weren‚Äôt a good fit for dating but have remained friends and meet each other for coffee, burgers, etc here and there.

I talked about these women with K in an attempt to be open/honest and it bothered her that I would want to remain in contact with women that I had dated/slept with so recently. She told me that it sounds like I‚Äôm still going on dates with the one woman who I meet up with, and asked if I pay when we go out places, which I do and was honest about. This really bothered her but I felt that she was being insecure and immature (my therapist did too). I told her that I would not cut my friend off just because she was uncomfortable because that would set a precedent that I would cut off anyone in my life that she was unhappy with. I know it still upset her but we moved past it.

Another issue was K claiming that I always talk about other women and my ex‚Äôs. When we had first started talking, we were sending each other pics from our lives and I sent a pic of me and a work colleague from about a decade ago. When I texted it, I wrote ‚ÄúIgnore the girl, that‚Äôs just an old crush‚Äù and I didn‚Äôt think much of it in the moment. It wasn‚Äôt until down the line when K and I were having a beach day when that topic came up again. I mentioned that I was head over heels for that girl but she‚Äôs married with kids now, and K got upset and confronted me about always bringing up ex‚Äôs and other women. This was another time where I felt that she was being insecure over nothing.

A bit later, K stayed at my apartment one evening and we were in bed in the morning. I wake up very early and she sleeps in a bit. I was trying to be cute and kiss/touch her to wake her up, and she said something rude like ‚Äúget the f*ck away from me‚Äù. I got upset and got out of bed and began working. She woke up a little later and apologized for being rude, claiming she‚Äôs not herself when half asleep and was upset that she said something mean to me. I told her it was ok and we went to breakfast. I was still upset and she could tell something was off. She asked me 2 times that morning if everything was ok, and I told her everything was fine, but I was still upset about how she spoke to me. 

Normally, we would have spent the whole day together but she decided to go home around noon. Shortly after, she sends me a screen recording of my profile on bumble. She didn‚Äôt say anything with it and just sent the recording. I told her that I had not been using it so I didn‚Äôt know why she sent it to me, and she replied ‚Äú I felt like something was off all morning, and I‚Äôm trying to make sense of it. This makes sense.‚Äù

At that point, I told her I was tired of being constantly mistrusted, insulted, and subject to rudeness. We talked it out and decided to try one more time.

Lastly, we‚Äôre having a weekend at my apartment and we are laying in bed while I shop for apartments since I‚Äôm currently renting. While looking, I made a joke about ‚Äúfinding a woman to move in who can contribute‚Äù and It clearly didn‚Äôt land. Her vibe shifted immediately although she didn‚Äôt confront the comment, and I said ‚Äú I was just joking about that. you know that, right?‚Äù 
She replied ‚Äú It‚Äôs hurtful to hear you say that because you know I can‚Äôt be that person right now with School, and it sounds like you‚Äôre planning to look for someone else.‚Äù

Soon after, I don‚Äôt know how it got there but we were talking about bodies (K is trans & pre-op) and I made this comment that ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never looked at a D and been like ‚ÄúThats a nice D‚Äù but I‚Äôve definitely looked at a V and been like ‚Äúthats a pretty V‚Äù. She got upset, and said that I didn‚Äôt say anything wrong and she was happy that I felt comfortable sharing certain things, but she was hurt because she wants to be the person I want and be able to give me what I want and that made her feel like she can‚Äôt do that for me. 

I was over the insecurities at this point, so I told her that we should probably just end it. She grabbed her things and left my apartment, and things a pretty much over now. It leaves me wondering if I was wrong about certain things or if she was just too insecure and immature.

1kzih0h,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kzih0h,"2 Month sublet + optional 1 Year lease in Cambridgeport 3bed/2bath with central air conditioning, free basement laundry and no brokers fee","Semi-Furnished Bedroom in a 3 bed/2 full bath apartment in the heart of Cambridgeport. Available for sublet for 2 months (July, August, can also start in mid-June if you want), and then you can sign a lease with the landlord who will take you on for the same lease that I had (1 year lease, 1400/month, First Month, Deposit, and again, no brokers fee).   
  
Building has central AC and heating, a dishwasher, gas stove with powerful fan, oven, microwave, garbage disposal, free laundry/dryer in the basement, and will come with a free desk, chair, and twin bed frame. During my stay here, I only paid for internet, but that was due to an agreement with my roommates. Utilities are not included in lease. The room is decently big, and I had enough space to make essentially turn my room into a living room with a couch and coffee table. Room is on the third  (top) floor, so you will never hear footsteps.  
  
The location is great. 5 minutes from the southern part of the MIT campus and 10 minutes away from the Central redline station. A free MIT shuttle has a stop down the street, and it will take you straight to Kendall. Within a 10 minute walk there is a Trader Joes, Whole Foods, H mart and Target. You are also a 2 minute walk away from a Flour bakery. The building is on a one way street so there isn't too much traffic, this room faces away from the street (with a view of the Prudential) so you never ever hear cars or passerbys. You are also close to the Charles river, and the jogging/bike path that offers one of the best views of Boston. You will also be right beside a park that has a basketball court and are within walking distance of 3 tennis courts, and within a 10-20 minute walk to everything in the central square area. Essentially, you get all the benefits of being near Central Square but none of the drawbacks of being too close to there. The neighborhood in general is gorgeous, especially in the summer when it feels like one big park.   
  
This is a great place, especially for the price. I am only leaving to attend medical school in my native Canada. I would have definitely renewed otherwise. I was working at HMS and one roommate is working at the Broad and the other is an exchange student at MIT. They are super nice! If you are doing an exchange/grad school/gap year in Boston this is the perfect apartment and environment for you.

1kzia4h,https://www.reddit.com/r/eShoppingUSA/comments/1kzia4h/red_tote_bag_luxury_leather_tote_everyday_chic/,Red Tote Bag: Luxury Leather Tote - Everyday Chic!,"Luxury Red Leather Tote Bag: My Everyday Chic & Practical Find!


Hey r/DealsReddit and r/Shopping!  I'm usually pretty picky about my bags ‚Äì I need something that looks good, lasts, and actually *works* for my life.  I've been through SO many totes, from cheap ones that fell apart after a month to expensive ones that were just‚Ä¶ not practical. You know, the ones that look amazing but can barely hold your phone and wallet? üò©

I finally found something that ticks all the boxes, and I'm genuinely excited to share it.  It‚Äôs a red leather tote bag ‚Äì I know, I know, ""red leather"" sounds kinda flashy, but hear me out. This one‚Äôs different.  It‚Äôs a rich, gorgeous red, but the style is surprisingly understated and elegant. It‚Äôs the perfect blend of luxury and practicality.  Seriously.

First off, the quality is amazing.  This isn't some flimsy faux leather that'll crack after a few weeks. This is real leather, and you can feel the difference. It‚Äôs durable, and I know it‚Äôs going to last. This is a long-term investment, not just another impulse buy.  That's a huge win for me because I'm tired of constantly replacing cheap bags.

The size is perfect too. It's big enough to hold everything I need for work (laptop, notebook, planner, phone, wallet ‚Äì you name it), but not so huge that it looks bulky or awkward.  The internal organization is fantastic. There are pockets and compartments everywhere, so everything stays in its place.  No more digging around in a bottomless pit of a bag trying to find my keys! üôå  This significantly reduces the stress and frustration of a disorganized bag!  Before getting this tote, I'd switch bags several times during the day - one for work, one for errands, one for the gym. This bag has replaced them all.

And let's talk about the style.  The classic tote shape is timeless, but the vibrant red makes it a statement piece. It instantly elevates any outfit, whether I'm heading to a business meeting or grabbing coffee with friends.  I feel confident and put-together when I'm carrying it, and that's a huge boost to my self-esteem.  It truly simplifies my daily routine.

I use this bag *every single day*.  I‚Äôve used it for work, travel, shopping trips, even a weekend getaway. It‚Äôs surprisingly versatile.  It‚Äôs also protected my laptop and other valuables from bumps and scrapes. I honestly can't remember the last time I felt the slightest bit of stress over carrying my belongings.  This bag has completely changed my daily experience ‚Äì from feeling flustered over finding my keys, to feeling confident about my overall appearance. It's been worth the investment, I can confidently say that.

I did a lot of research before buying this bag (I'm a notorious over-researcher!), and I compared it to several other leather totes. This one stood out because of the quality of the leather, the thoughtful design, and the overall feel.  It's simply the best tote I've ever owned ‚Äì and I've owned a lot. üòâ

I found this amazing red leather tote on ursupermart.com.   It's seriously worth checking out if you're in the market for a new bag that's both stylish and practical.  I've been so impressed by the quality and how much it simplifies my day-to-day.

If you‚Äôre curious about this life-simplifying, style-boosting bag, here‚Äôs the one I got: https://go.ursupermart.com/tOkO10

Seriously, consider it. You deserve a bag that makes you feel as good as it looks!  And this one does just that.  Let me know if you have any questions!  üòä  https://go.ursupermart.com/tOkO10",1,1748646407.0,eShoppingUSA,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm looking for a dentist in Brisbane who actually takes the time to do a proper deep clean of the teeth. Most places I‚Äôve been to just rush through the cleaning part in under 30 minutes, and I leave feeling like nothing was really done. The stains are still there, especially between my teeth, and it just feels like a quick once-over with no real attention to detail.

Has anyone had a really good experience with a dental clinic where they do a proper deep scale and clean‚Äîespecially if you drink tea/coffee and have stubborn stains? I‚Äôd really appreciate any recommendations.

Thanks in advance!

Kendu is not just a coin‚Äîit‚Äôs a permissionless, community-owned brand. Anyone can build under the Kendu name with no central foundation, no team approval, and no limits. This makes Kendu more than a meme: it‚Äôs a canvas for builders, creators, and entrepreneurs to shape its future.

‚ÄúIf you hold Kendu, you own the brand. Build whatever you want.‚Äù

‚∏ª

2. Viral Community Power: The ‚ÄúKendu Army‚Äù

The Kendu Army is a force on social media. Known for flooding platforms with memes, updates, and calls to action, this community has been instrumental in driving awareness and momentum‚Äîall without influencers or paid marketing. It‚Äôs pure grassroots firepower.

‚∏ª

3. Proven Track Record of Explosive Growth

Kendu Inu surged from launch to over $200 million in market cap without presales, team wallets, or venture capital. This level of performance demonstrates a rare blend of narrative power, holder conviction, and decentralized momentum that few meme coins ever achieve. During a Community Take Over (CTO) earlier this year, a toxic dev was kicked from the project and replaced with a true community ethos. they began at 6 million market cap and have already pushed up past 40 million market cap this year in a down market, with unlimited upward potential.

‚∏ª

4. Verified by CertiK + Active Telegram Hub

Kendu has been audited by CertiK, providing new investors with confidence in its contract security. The official Telegram group is constantly buzzing with updates, memes, and developer engagement, making it the central communication hub for the Kendu movement.

‚∏ª

5. Real-World Businesses Built on Kendu

Kendu has evolved from a meme into a brand ecosystem. Community entrepreneurs have already launched several real businesses using the Kendu name, proving its potential as a decentralized lifestyle brand:
	‚Ä¢	Kendu Energy ‚Äì Clean energy products and education.
	‚Ä¢	Kendu Style ‚Äì Fashion and apparel inspired by crypto culture.
	‚Ä¢	Kendu Coffee ‚Äì Artisan coffee with crypto flair.
	‚Ä¢	Kendu Creator ‚Äì A creator hub supporting NFT and digital artists.
	‚Ä¢	Kendu Unstitched ‚Äì Clothing and textile drops under the Kendu name.

These are not just merch lines ‚Äî they are independently built businesses powered by belief in the Kendu brand.
