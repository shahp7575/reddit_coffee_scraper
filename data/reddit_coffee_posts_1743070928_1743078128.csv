But to me, it sounds more like, ""King Kong come out to dance ***for*** me."" A little more aggressive and condescending.

Which is exactly the kind of thing that would test the patience and ego of Logan and make him contentious. After that, Logan starts to be short with him (""tell me what you want and we can fuck off""), making jokes about coffee and bagels, etc.",2,1743077940.0,SuccessionTV,0,1.0,False

The company gives a generous amount of sick time, and I understand that employees should use this when needed.

My problem is more personal and how I can balance empathy for their absences. A couple of my direct reports are always sick, and they often complain about how they don't sleep well, need to nap, etc. Both reports are in their mid-20s. 

It's clear to me that they do not take care of themselves, but that's not really my place to bring it up? If you are not sleeping, showing up to work and you're only just waking up and need an hour to get coffee and settle in, and needing to nap at lunch every day, I feel like there's something going on in your life that you should probably look into.

I look at performance and getting work done vs perfect attendance. I don't want to be ""that"" manager who is so strict, as long as they're getting the work completed, and they are. However, it is my responsibility to cover their work and sometimes they're absent on a deadline day, and I have to complete and submit the work.

I'm just concerned about their personal well being, but annoyed at the same time because there's other employees who are not sick all the time and actually start work around 9am, vs just being there and waking up slowly. 

I find myself struggling with empathy sometimes. I don't know how to always respond positively when someone has constant issues one after another. This one employee is always falling sick (for real, I talk to them on the phone when they call out), but then there's a family emergency another day, and then they need to nap at every lunch break. I feel bad they are struggling but I don't know what to do anymore. At the same time, I don't think I'm managing this correctly at all. I'm not sure this position is right for me.",1,1743077894.0,askmanagers,0,1.0,False

1jl2jfg,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1jl2jfg/was_i_an_asshole/,Was i an asshole,"So my ex left me about 5-6 months ago we were long distance. Reason for breakup was i had a pretty traumatic childhood that leaked into our relationship. I started going to therapy and working on in before she left me but she said the damage was already done and she cant deal with me anymore. I wasn’t abusive or anything i was just emotionally silent, stone walled after intimacy coz i would get flashbacks and i would ask insecure questions. All things i know i shouldn’t have done i took accountability for it and went to therapy to fix it. She was also not perfect she lied about her ex and forced me to be ok with her still wanting to hang out with her ex friends with benefits. She is emotionally avoidant as hell so never actually opened up to me but forced me to open up to her and she never once came to me with problems we had in the relationship also went to her friends. In the end shes blamed me for everything and said i hurt her very very much. Which i understand to a degree but she also never gave me the chance to fix the things i did wrong coz she would never tell me when i did do something wrong. 

Anyway here comes the asshole part. So today i went and picked up my hoody from her place of work. It was all arranged over the phone she was supposed to leave it at reception and i would just stop get it and leave. I get there and she never left it at reception, i call her and she comes down to give it to me. I was polite said hello, she gave me the hoody then looked at me with big eyes and asked for a hug i said no. Then said goodbye and left. Also keep in mind she asked me to go get a coffee over the phone and i declined coz i dont want to see the women who basically said you are too broken to be loved and took 0 accountability for anything she did wrong.

All my life I’ve struggled with my period. Cramps, Pain, Constipation or Diarrhea, Bladder problems, irregular cycles, PMS… 

I tried a lot of things to better my symptoms like eating less to no sugar/veggie/vegan, no coffee, drinking teas, do sports, sleep, no stress (as far as it was manageable), “listen to my body”, but it never helped. I just felt worse cause I couldn’t eat or drink my comfort food, sports only made me feel sluggish, stress wanted to creep in because I slept and didn’t do much. I went on to unhealthier habits, let’s just say, I didn’t get my period anymore. I was unhealthy but I was happy.

When I recovered and my period came back I was so miserable. I cried for hours and felt so helpless. Las year I decided to switch my gyn. She is the best I have ever had and really takes me seriously. She suspected endometriosis and I felt so heard and understood when reading up on the symptoms. 

Fast forward to getting a laparoscopy last week at a hospital for final diagnosis. After the laparoscopy they told me their suspicions had been confirmed and I should go to my gyn this week for post surgery treatment and to discuss the results. I was fine with that. I didn’t need any more explanations because I thought I finally had an answer to my condition and we could discuss further treatment. 

Well, guess what? It’s not endometriosis. It just looked like it. When they took the biopsies during the laparoscopy the tissue looked like endometriosis, so they told me it was. The pathology report however stated that it is not endo, not inflammatory, not malignant. Just tissue.  

Now don’t get me wrong, I am glad I don’t have cancer or chronic inflammation BUT I am extremely sad and frustrated and lost right now. I am back to my body is just my body hating me without a reason. I feel so helpless and angry at my body that it just can’t function properly. That there is no explanation to why I am experiencing this. 

My gyn tried to reassure me, that she is with me to get to the bottom of my symptoms and to treat them. For now we have to wait for the final report of the hospital (which they told me takes weeks), and we will go from there. 

It’s just so exhausting. I don’t want to live like this anymore. I just want peace. I want the periods to stop. I like being a woman but periods can go fuck themselves. If I could, I would just let them take it all out. ",1,1743077703.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

Where do I go from here?,"I (24M) recently went on a date with a girl (26F) and it was amazing! We clicked really well, we had great fun, it really felt like we had great chemistry and it went on for much longer then we anticipated it. Only catch: she has a boyfriend.

I recently met a girl through work and thought she was cute and interesting. So I texted her asking for a coffee and she said yes. When I get there, I find her waiting all dolled up and ready. She was wearing a skirt, she had done her hair, she was wearing contacts and all around looked great. I mentioned this to say that it wasn't a ""casual"" look but clearly of someone on date trying to look good.

We get coffee and start chatting and 10 minutes into our conversation she casually drops that she has a boyfriend. I was stunned.  At first I thought I misheard her but then she hit me with, ""What about you?"" Unable to process this one-two punch I deflect saying ""No, I don't have a boyfriend"" buying time to think about what's happening. She doubles down and asks me about my dating life and I deflect again saying that I haven't had any luck with long term relationships.

At this point you're thinking, ""Sucks for you dude, but she has a boyfriend. Move on. What's the problem?"" and you my friend are correct except we stayed there for 4 more hours and have been texting since.

As mentioned previously, it was an amazing date. We chatted for 4 hours after that. We laughed and got super comfortable with each other. We went for a walk and when I'd suggest we go back she even made an excuse to elongate the date. After the date/coffee, we have been texting each other nonstop.

She has mentioned this boyfriend twice more over text since, leading me to believe that this is a real person. And even if he doesn't exist her saying it means that she doesn't want a romantic relationship with me, right? 

THEN WHY GO ON A DATE?? I refuse to believe she didn't think of it as a date. She came all dressed up and our level of comfort matched exactly what I would consider a good date to be. Also, no way she didn't get the vibe here. She is super smart and would have realised it right? 

Am I deluding myself just because I like her? Is she gaslighting me to test me (cuz that has happened to me before)? Was she actually just seeing my request for coffee as a casual, friendly and platonic meet up? Idk what to do because I want it to work but not if she actually has a boyfriend.

It’s been 5 years and I’m still mourning our friendship, what should I do?","I (F28) had a best friend through college (M28) who I had a somewhat of a falling out with at the end of 2020. It was covid, I had started a new relationship, and I had not been able to see my bff for a while because we lived a few hours away from eachother. Right before our falling out I had moved about 30 mins away from my bff and I was so excited to be closer to him! About 2 weeks after moving he called me very late on a Saturday night, I was worried and of course answered the call. He invited my boyfriend and I to come out with him and some of him other friends. Since it was so late at night and I was already in bed I told him that maybe next time but it’s a little late to get started tonight. He asked me if I just didn’t want to be his friend anymore (he had already been drinking and smoking weed for a while already at this time). I said that I of course want to be his friend, I just wasn’t prepared to go out at that time. I’m not sure if I said that in a way that came off rude or mean or dismissive, I wasn’t trying to be any of those things but sometimes our tone can be misconceived or misunderstood. He accused me of trying to cut him out of my life and I tried to defend myself but he hung up. After that I thought that he should reach out and apologize, instead of just being mature and reaching out to him. I think he may have felt that I should reach out to him and apologize, so neither of us were reaching out and neither of us were apologizing. After a few weeks of minimal communication I reached out to him to try to reconcile but he told me that he was very hurt and was not sure he wanted to be my friend at that time. I was sad to hear this from him but tried to respect his wishes. I still sent him birthday and holiday texts but other than that I tried to give him space. About 6 months later I wasn’t doing well with our friend breakup and reached out to him asking if we could please get coffee and talk it out. That’s when he told me I waited too long to reach out and that it was too late, he did not ever imagine us being close again. I was heartbroken but I can’t force someone to be my friend. After that we still sent birthday and holiday texts for a little but eventually he stopped communication with me at all. Now 5 years later I still mourn our friendship. I think about the fact that we are strangers again, I don’t know him anymore, I only know who he was. Our memories come back to me and I dream about him and repairing our friendship very often. He was such a wonderful friend to have and it feels like our friendship shouldn’t have ended. The falling out wasn’t some big blow out fight, I just felt that I needed to respect what he said and try to move forward. I’m struggling with this and need some advice.

Many of you may have seen posts in January/February of the situation I was in, or if not, here’s a short-ish recap:


I was dumped over 3 months ago, the factor to my knowledge was the circumstances of them moving overseas and they didn’t feel it would be fair to take the relationship further and they couldn’t be my person, however, before this as they could never truly express and communicate their feelings, or tell me what they were truly thinking because of the normal hot/cold spells that would occur and the ongoing personal matters in the background for them. They attempted to get me to break things off before this, as I feel they didn’t want the guilt of actioning it themselves, but that didn’t pan out because I told them I wish to be in a relationship with them. No problems, no fights, believe they are an avoidant (unconfirmed whether it’s FA or DA). After they ended things a little later I said I respected their decision but made them know I want a relationship with them and made it clear. After this they sent a message 2 1/2 weeks into the silence to try and restart some form of communication, and decided to start watching my stories/randomly liking posts on social media which never happened before. I had in all honesty started posting more content, because I was out with friends, travelling and trying out new hobbies. After some time had passed and these breadcrumbs not stopping, I finally gave in, I broke silence and told them I would be unfollowing each other from social media because it wasn’t healthy which they disagreed with and couldn’t express why, but I could see they had withdrawn and just tended to watch from a far whilst I rebuild and improve my life by myself. A conversation transpired after my boundaries, they were going through a rough patch for sure, but I reiterated that this conversation doesn’t change anything between us, but if they need to reach out, more than happy to talk or speak if we come across each others paths. Silence been ever since but I feel they would rather leave it to a game of chance rather than express their true feeling or be open, because of the fear of having to deal with the consequences/rejection, as everyone in their life has basically left them, so I was one of those, who didn’t want to, but was rather pushed into doing it for healthier reasons. 


I am finally in a better position in my life after placing myself first as it has allowed me to regain a healthier mind and outlook on life. I have loss weight in a positive way and changed my hairstyle (people have noticed and commented on both whether that’s colleagues or people I come across on a regular basis), the smile I use to have has returned and I am enjoying social gatherings and hobbies again, even picking up a new one along the way, who would have thought how times can change… My future is looking promising especially as I have the wheels in motion for a life changing experience to happen later on this year as I’ve agreed to something important that will be another new chapter in itself. I feel I am currently stronger and have the strength to reach out and say this. I know a lot of you will disagree and say why put yourself through the possibility of pain again, which at be the outcome, however, I see this as me growing as a person and knowing this is the end of the book and it’s my final goodbye or could be the beginning of something great with someone I saw more with, so I wish to reach out by saying something along the lines of:


Hey NAME, you’ve made this decision and I understand the boundaries I applied later on came as a surprise and a shock to you as they were so sudden, but it allowed me to heal quicker. However, I wouldn’t be happy with myself if I didn’t tell you that what we potentially could have had, could have been one of kind, extraordinary, rare, and what many people don’t get many shots at in their lifetime if the opportunity wasn’t allowed to grow and blossom. I think it is a mistake what is currently happening, but that is only true if you feel it too. So, you are the one who knows whether this is true and there is something worth fighting for here, or you don’t, then I will continue moving on with my life. I’m in a position where I can accept any outcome, but I needed to say this ‘for me’, to say this to you, so you know where I stand. 


What are your thoughts on this?

I would feel empathy and clearly, it would appear to me, sometimes life just sucks and bad luck hits. But the more and more I think about this, I found myself blaming me and my husband for the matter because well - I don't know what else to think about it. It stil just hurts.

One couple, the guy was a friend from highschool he got back into contact with, seem to have realized we are not the people they are looking for. I remember the moment happened with the girl - I asked her when we would meet up next time, and then she started to list all the busy activities they do in the weekend; and when I asked for the sunday (she has not mentioned) she became quite and said ""uhhh we keep our sundays always free for ourselves you know?"" And then I knew - she was not interested anymore.
It's totally fair if people decide it's not for them, but can't say it did not hurt and still does.
 
Family from my husband we used to be close went completely batshit when his Dad died. They vented all their grief in the form of anger and hatred towards us, instead of coming close together as a family and processing the grief with the all of us, because we all lost a loved one there. After that, they tried to ignore the matter and pretended everything was back to normal, no apology, nothing. We stopped speaking to them.

The daughter of friends of us - she did not even appear on the wedding picture because the wedding and the invitation was a fallout. Turned out she also decided to cut all contact with her parents, they are as heartbroken as you can imagine. She used to give me a selfmade bracelet and a little poem. It meant a lot to me. Now I question what it meant in first place if she cut me off so easily. 

I am estranged from my own family. I actually am since ever my Mom died when I was a teenager but I guess I just realized recently when I looked back. I always blamed myself that meetings did not happen or I thought I just have to try harder, they may not invite me for a coffee because they must think I am always busy, must be me, since they all still keep talking amongst each other. It was just always me who seemed to peak out of the crown. I started a few attempts the last few years, invited them when I knew they would pass by when coming hoem from a vacation or so, but it was either cancelled last minute or declined politely with many reasons given. But not personal, of course. On one hand I am so much different than them that I do not even like them as people, but on the other hand I just wish I would.. fit in somewhere. Have people to relate to. Have related people. 

My (half) Brother I grew up with. I also have always been estranged from him but here as well, I just realized recently that he is just a dick. I always tried to have a relationship with him, but his giant ego actually did not want to be loved, by no one. He turned into a conspiracy theorist, racist, sexist, mysogonist, you name it; and conversations with him always feel like an open mine field. He is aware that his view is shit, and seems like only to open up about them with other incels, but I always just wish he would be a different person than he is. Maybe its selfish to wish that, because essentially I want a nice big brother for my own sake. He did not make it to my wedding because they all got sick on the day itself. I don't blame them for that but - no one of my own blood attented my special day. It still feels to me like I lost someone I never had in first place and it causes some feeling of grief of things I wish I would have. Maybe this does not fit in here, but feelingwise, that all seems to align for me right now.

Same kind of grief I feel for my cousin I have been in touch for a year now or so. Maybe it is me, and I expect too much of other people and I should lower my expectations for other people in general.

The friend from my wedding I seemed to have liked more than the other way around. She offered to do my hair and makeup and she did an amazing job! Being kind of a bridesmaid meant a lot for me; but to her, that does not seem to be the case. We occasionally meet for coffee or so, but it seemed to her being all the same, a coffee, a weeding, holding someones baby, idk. I guess I am here the person who likes her more or has very much different expectations. I had trouble dealing with that fact, and I stopped reaching out to her.

Another girly friend I knew via the friend mentioned in the paragraph before. We met for the first time when we decided to go as a group to our first music festival and had a great time there, I also believed we somewhat boned as friends. I used to meet her sometimes with the other friend, sometimes alone and have dinner or coffee or whatever. Before my birthday party she was invited to; she behaved a bit nasty (first didnt wanna come, then yes, then no because mental health, then yes maybe in case she happens to be in the neighbourhood anyways ) and I told her politely its not so nice to just come around in case all other circumstances happen to happen. She didnt took it well, told me I have always been a bad friend, forced her to do stuff and then said we better not talk anymore. And this was the end of that.",2,1743076657.0,lostafriend,0,1.0,False
1jl25yh,https://i.redd.it/jasp8aam18re1.jpeg,I’m baaaaaack,"I think I owe y’all a shit post.

But first things first, “mid” is so not cool to say. I thought it was bc I’m so young and I learn all my vernacular from TikTok. And I fucked up and tried to sound cool in my last post bc I just want y’all to think I’m cool by saying things like mid. 

I always spend a lot of time trying to maximize the coolness of my posts by adding words like mid. Even though it’s not even cool anymore and it was probably out of fashion by the time I was in college.

I also want to thank @Acceptable-Club6307 for thinking and saying that I’m young. But more importantly, I am appreciative of this user for pointing out the fact that my attempts to be cool had in fact, fallen flat, bc mid is not a cool word to say even though (according to him/her/them) young people think it is.

As we all know, what is cool is dictated by the older folks. And as I’ve gotten older and older, I’ve definitely cared more and more about what is cool and appearing cool. And nothing is more cool than being the “Wow I can’t believe these kids say that” guy about words that aren’t even considered cool anymore by actual young people. Wait until they hear “cooked” or “real” in 10 years.

But you have to promise to give me a follow if you’re going to use that content against me. It’s only fair! 

I’m tryna get a Crate & Barrel sponsorship bc I need a new coffee table. I’ll sell out my threads for home goods idgaf.

I keep very active and eat a balanced diet, reduced alcohol consumption to almost nothing lately.  Cut coffee down to 1 cup a day and am open to just switching to decaf. 

My history with hypertension; initially diagnosed in 2011, at the time was put on 25 mg of Losartan/hydrochlorothiazide combo pill.  Several years later, BP was increased with onset of perimenopause, and was put on 50 mg of Losartan, 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide.  I lost 50 pounds in 2018 and have kept it off since; I’ve been on the same dosage of meds, 50mg Losartan and 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide for probably ten years now, with good BP readings in a normal range.  I have always had a low resting heart rate; new PCP had concerns about this in 2023 (she took over for my former doc who retired), and was referred to a cardiologist for a stress test and full work up. He found nothing wrong with my heart.  

This week I went for a pre-op physical for upcoming orthopedic surgery, and my BP was elevated  - 160/90. There’s been no change in my medical condition other than I’m now in full menopause rather than perimenopause. My anxiety is at an all time high though, due to work stress and other things.   I’ve recently been put on Wellbutrin (maybe 3 weeks in on that) for depression.    My BP was actually elevated during my yearly physical at the beginning of the month - so my doctor had me double up on the Losartan.  Now taking 100 mg and it seems like I am doing even worse now.  Maybe the Wellbutrin - which is new to me - is causing the increases in BP? Doctor said she “didn’t think so” and I am having good results on this otherwise, so I don’t want to stop that right now either, unless that is the factor causing the rise in BP. 

Doctor will of course not sign off on surgery due to high BP, and is referring me back to cardiology.  The surgery is next month and I doubt I will be cleared in time, which is stressing me out even more.    I’m incredibly frustrated - and I do have white coat syndrome for sure, I could feel the heat creeping up my neck the minute she put the cuff on - but I really want to know what I am doing wrong.  I work out almost daily - largely cardio and yoga, can’t lift anymore due to rotator cuff injury (what I need the surgery for), eat a well balanced diet, and try my damndest to manage stress with yoga and meditation.  I am not sure what else I should be doing here.  I’m doing all the right things, and it just is not helping. 

FWIW - this morning, had a perfectly normal BP reading at home, shortly after finishing my morning HIIT workout.  I’m at a loss.

At first I was confused who (she was referred to as Dinosaur McCuntface by the 2nd-most her-affected person in the room) and then why (but it hit me inviting her with that condition is not inviting her since she was going to do it all anyway then get offended that hers wasn't the most overridingly righteous reasoning in the room) but it didn't change anything for me.

A mutual friend commented best wishes on a post she made from hospital, apparently the reason she's been called a dinosaur most of her life has finally caught up with her. She slated multiple hospitals for not being able to help her despite clean labs and went on to personally thank the same friends that encouraged her to start bad arguments with me while recording, blocking the only exit and yelling at me to get away. I expected a sly grin or dirty chuckle before moving on but it's not even that any more, I might actually be done with all the recovery from this I need until I hit an actual practical roadblock like intimacy with someone else.

Not sure how I can move forward.,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for 2 years. A few months back I 25/m was on a work trip away. My girlfriend 28/f is still friends with her ex, even after I’ve voiced to her how it makes me feel multiple times. I’d voiced to her that I felt disrespected, that it made me feel like I couldn’t see a future and that it affected how much intimacy I could give her because of it. At the time I was on the phone to her and she said that she’d gone around to her ex’s 27/m place to console him after a breakup he had just gone through. She went over there for three consecutive days. I didn’t say anything over the phone as I thought better of it. When I got home I was feeling very drained from the situation and essentially we had a long chat about the amount of respect that was being shown towards the relationship by both parties. I’d voiced to her how it made me feel, how if the roles were reversed what would she think? Her reasoning for the matter was that she relapsed with smoking and knew she could get a free smoke from him by doing so. Anyway, I decided to give it another chance with her, and work on things as there are factors on both sides. I found it hard to put effort into the relationship because of it but did so anyway and when I did, I felt like I was having to force myself. But throughout the months I’d noticed that the ex would still go into the coffee shop where she worked and chat and what not. I wasn’t overly impressed but alas I’ll try and not jump to conclusions. 

This is where it gets a bit how ya going. A few months after that conversation I had a great mate pass away suddenly which I witnessed. It was a really tough period. To this day I’m still working on things. However, my friend never liked this ex and never hung out with him whatsoever. My friend that passed had a dog that needed to get rehomed and here’s the ex trying to take ownership of the dog. I essentially cracked the shits and just said to her I’m not having him in my life whatever it takes. To which she responded poorly as if she was hard done by. I said to her why is he still hanging around the coffee shop and why is she still associating with him. I also voiced that if I were to have a child with her is this ex going to hang about like a bad smell and my kid have exposure to him and his behaviour. We didn’t talk for a day or so, when we did talk I could tell that she hadn’t thought about how I felt throughout the entire thing. It seemed as if she was trying to keep him in her life even at the expense of disrespecting me at times. Her reasoning also made me feel worse as it didn’t add up to me. Her words were that that she was understanding and that underlying her relationship with him was a friendship at the end of the day. I said to her that it wasn’t understanding or respectful as it came at the expense of how she treated the relationship with me, her actual boyfriend. 

Some months have passed now and I’ve tried to move forward and build with her but a part of me seems to not be able to. I’m stuck in a position right now where I feel like the risk of building a future with her is just too high with what’s happened in the relationship thus far. I’m not sure on what approach I should adopt for it.

TL;DR: My girlfriend 28/f and I 25/m are trying to move past associations with an ex. Things are a bit how ya going. And a lot of heavy things have occurred. ",1,1743075867.0,relationships,2,1.0,False

I was in debt collection and recovery - the irony of a debt collector being into findom was never lost on me, don't worry.

Collections has a bad rap in some ways. A lot of people associate it with ruthless, ""pay up or else"" approaches that some organisations do indeed lead with. In most banks in the modern day, there's a much greater emphasis on vulnerabile customers, debt recovery plans - basically finding more reasonable means of re-couping debt for things like mortgages and loans, rather than piling up interest and putting people in worse positions.

All this to say, a HUGE part of what I did when working this job was working with people in financial difficulty. Specifically, drawing up budgeting plans for them. Have you ever completed a budgeting form? It's an EXTREMELY helpful exercise for any adult to complete, regardless of your circumstances or how well/poorly you might feel you are doing financially.

Often times when taking people through these forms, their perception of their finances or where there money was going was WAY off when we looked at the actual figures coming in and going out of their bank accounts. A common example was people talking at length about the cost of living and prices of groceries - come to find out they would be spending £70 a week on takeaways/deliveries. They'd talk about how hard their bills had been hitting them each month, when in fact they'd have an expensive car on finance that they absolutely didn't need, or some other luxury expense that was beyond their means.

Credit card debt galore as well. The truth is; we're sold the idea that we can live beyond our means, and we are given so many avenues to explore doing this (like credit cards) - it can all get very predatory, especially given how genuinely financially illiterate some people are. Not that many of us are really taught financial literacy at great length - schools don't exactly do a great job at it, at least in the UK. So we rely on parents/common sense to get a better handle on these things.

So apart from being food for thought - where does findom come into it? Simply put, I suggest everyone here completes a budgeting form of some kind. There are many free versions online or via your bank. In case anyone doesn't know, it's a form where you put in your weekly/bi-weekly/monthly income, and pain-stakingly add every single monthly outgoing cost you have - from bills, groceries and essentials, to subscriptions to things like netflix/Spotify, all the way down to your best attempt at quantifying little things you'd buy throughout the month, like a bar of chocolate or a cup of coffee.

After you've put in everything you can think of, you'll be left with an idea of how much of a monthly surplus (or deficit if you're over-spending) you might be left with. Let's say you have $2500 coming in every month and $2000 in costs, bills, luxury expenses leaving your account every month. You have $500 left over. Quantifying all of this can be so incredibly eye opening. Knowing how much roughly you should have at the end of a month allows you to plan ahead. Do you put that $500 a month into savings? Do you invest it? Do you blow it on excess luxuries? Do you put it towards your next big purchase or holiday? This is valuable to consider because it opens a door for you to explore what you'd actually like to work towards.

So what happens when you see that $500 monthly surplus and think ""I can spend this on Findom, it's within my budget"". This can absolutely be the thinking of a recovering findom addict. HOPEFULLY if you've taken the steps to truly look at your finances with a fine tooth comb, you'll be inspired to save your money for more fulfilling things outside of findom. If nothing else, you now have another measure of the kind of money you'll have available to you. When you drop $250 on a domme during a particularly bad night of sending, you didn't just spend $250. You spent half of your monthly leftover budget. Having the understanding of your finances to this degree can give you a much better perspective of what money you have and how much of a loss you really take when you send to findom.

This is just something I really like to consider, but I hope you found it remotely helpful or at least interesting. I realise most of us are adults and I'm maybe spoon-feeding basic finances into job having, bill paying, contributing members to society. Nonetheless, sometimes we need to go back to basics to realise the actual Implications findom is or was having on our financial wellbeing.",2,1743075223.0,QuittingFindom,0,1.0,False

While traditional thinkers ponder existential questions, Jamie navigates the vast seas of the internet, retrieving answers with the precision of a seasoned mariner. His philosophy is simple: all truths can be found with the right search query.

Consider the moment when Joe Rogan, in the midst of a profound discussion, laments, ""You know what, I'm suffering. Jamie, this coffee sucks!"" Without missing a beat, Jamie remains the silent observer, perhaps contemplating the deeper meaning behind Rogan's dissatisfaction. Is it the coffee that's lacking, or is it a metaphor for the human condition?

In another instance, during a heated debate on the existence of nuclear weapons, Jamie's calm demeanor contrasts the fervent arguments, embodying the Stoic ideal of maintaining composure amidst chaos. His ability to remain unflappable, even when the conversation spirals into absurdity, is a testament to his philosophical grounding.

Jamie's role extends beyond mere fact-checking; he is the digital age's Socrates, prompting us to question the validity of our sources and the nature of knowledge itself. When Rogan exclaims, ""Jamie, pull that up,"" it's not just a request for information but an invocation of the modern oracle, seeking clarity in a world clouded by misinformation.

In essence, Jamie Vernon teaches us that in the quest for truth, the journey through the labyrinth of the internet is as important as the destination. He reminds us that while answers are readily available, the wisdom lies in knowing which questions to ask.",1,1743075060.0,badphilosophy,0,1.0,False

1jl1m0x,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicIllness/comments/1jl1m0x/is_it_worth_seeing_a_private_doctor_about_eds/,Is it worth seeing a private doctor about EDS?,"Hi, I posted on here recently asking if you have to be tall to have EDS since my rheum told me that (I’m 4’9) but the post was removed as it’s not allowed to seek medical advice on here. So just to confirm - I’m aware that I cannot take the opinions of Redditors as medical advice! I’m asking this so I can gain an understanding of whether t o spend on a private doctor since I may not be able to depend on the NHS at this point. I don’t want to throw my parents’ money away for nothing. 

I’m already diagnosed with inflammatory arthritis and am taking yuflyma for it, but I feel it hasn’t helped with a good deal of my symptoms. I didn’t expect it to heal me completely anyways, but I want to make absolutely sure that I’ve checked as many boxes as I can before going to uni, which includes checking for EDS even if I’m not really convinced that I have it. My rheum told me the symptoms that aren’t improved by the yuflyma may be the result of fibromyalgia, for which there’s no cure or treatment, since there were questions of whether I have fibromyalgia before inflammation showed up on my ultrasounds and MRI and in some blood tests, though quite mild. 

Here’s a list of some of the symptoms that I’ve heard others with EDS have, and some that I’m wondering might be linked to it: 
- dental crowding (I had braces because I had vampire teeth due to my teeth being too cramped)
- popping and cracking joints that feel like they’re shifting (I know this can be normal?? Due to gases and stuff. But since it hurts I’m not sure if I should keep ignoring it). Happens a lot in my knees, sometimes hips especially right, and especially right shoulder, which I’m constantly rolling and rotating due to pain and only get very loud crackling noises and no relief 
- painful feet, I’m wondering if they’re flat or have fallen arches. Even walking for 10 or 20 minutes or even less causes painful feet and sometimes “stitches” in them, even after my knee pain has improved from the yuflyma). 
- unable to stand for long periods of time, puts a lot of pressure on my knees and feet and I get the feeling that my knees will give it out sometimes because of it. I resort to standing in weird positions and switching them often. 
- knees feeling tight or unstable - when I first started getting this problem badly at 16 I said they felt “twisty”, like they weren’t flexing properly or were stuck in the wrong position or locked  
- on the Beighton scale, I think I only score 4 (for my pinkies and knees, though my knees aren’t super hypermobile I think?? One more than the other). 
- hypermobile shoulders as noted by the physio and hips ( w sitting). 
- heat intolerance - switching from cold to hot very quickly, especially getting hot quickly even if everyone else in the room is in jumpers and coats. My hands get red and swollen and itchy and burning from it sometimes too - I wondered if it’s my Raynaud’s (which I also have) but when I asked my rheum he was like “oh that’s weird I have no idea what that is” and moved on 
- sitting in weird positions and needing my legs up quite a lot, otherwise they’ll ache (also happens with my arms sometimes). I like to be cramped up and compressed, sometimes pressure just helps with pains and aches. I would get in trouble at school for it a lot and my parents would always get mad at me for it. 
- gastrointestinal issues, doctors are querying IBS for the millionth time without actually diagnosing it because they don’t know if it’s actually the problem, currently on the FODMAP diet and tried about 6 medications linked to GERD/IBS/IBD/acid reflux but to no avail. “Predominantly clear” colonoscopy and endoscopy with unspecified advice to change my diet and lifestyle. Main issue is feeling full too quickly and getting constipated easily 
- was told I was very flexible as a kid, used to do tricks like putting my feet on my head and stuff like that 
- soft skin but I’m not sure if it’s a normal level of soft or not, it’s a little stretchy in some places but not SUPER stretchy 
- migraines 
- tachycardia 
- pain across my shoulders, shoulder blades, upper back and neck. Sort of cramping and always feel the need to roll my shoulders to fix it but it doesn’t really help much. It feels like my shoulder blades shift a lot or aren’t in the right place. Especially happens with right shoulder blade and can be VERY painful. 
- painful periods, I’m not sure if it’s on the level of endometriosis, pretty sure it’s not. But it makes all my limbs hurt and ache BADLY, my whole body feels tight and swollen, I can only survive by taking two paracetamols and two ibuprofens in one go. 
- somewhat easily bruised (not as severe as some cases I’ve seen but definitely quite a lot worse than the average)
- feeling like I need to pee a lot - one of the less frequent symptoms but gets significantly worse for some periods of time (weeks/months). Worsens with drinking some things like fizzy drinks, hot chocolate, tea, coffee, anything with hot water in it. Have literally peed like more than 10 times in half an hour because as soon as I leave the bathroom I feel like I need to pee again. Sometimes feel like I never get it all out. 
- black vision and dizziness when standing 
- tinnitus and buzzing noises - was really bad for like two years but it’s been better in the last year 
- deep aching muscle pains - sometimes it seems to coincide with one joint in that limb hurting which makes the entire limb just ache deeply. I’ve described it as feeling like someone’s stretching my limbs or a heavy weight is attached to it and hanging, or like someone’s trying to pull my limbs off. Or also like the ache you get if someone wrapped a hand tight around your ankle and your blood flow gets cut off, but that’s a way I’d describe it less often and it happens like that more in my legs than arms. When I get those sorts of pains I feel the urge to compress the my limb with my hands really tightly, or wrap a bandage very tightly around it, though the pressure doesn’t help much or takes a long time to help  
- sleep problems, one of the milder symptoms but there have been long periods of time where I’ve woken up 3-5 times a night 
- chronic fatigue 

I want to confirm again - I’m not going to take any comments as professional medical advice. I’m going to take them only as opinions from patients so I can better decide whether it’s worth losing money to go to a private doctor, since we haven’t got money to throw away. Regardless of what the comments say, I’m also not going to assume I have EDS - i want to check whether I do as a precaution, to tick every box I can, and am aware the symptoms overlap with many other causes.

1jl1j0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1jl1j0k/pagod_na_ako_umintindi/,Pagod na ako umintindi,"TW: grief

Please do not post on other social media apps. 

Hello, fellow Redditors. Unang-una sa lahat, humihingi ako ng pasensya kung magulo ako magkwento dito sa post ko. I just want to get this off my chest. 

This is about my eldest brother who is a single parent because his wife died a couple of years ago due to cancer. For context, I was there for my brother and nephew during those difficult times. My brother was left with his only son. My nephew is like a carbon copy of his late mom, but what's troubling me now is my brother's toxic behavior and bad attitude, and how this will affect my nephew's upbringing.

Naubos na pasensya ko sa kanya kasi for the longest time, I've been holding space for him, listening to him and all his thoughts and feelings since his wife passed away. I also encouraged him to seek professional help for his grief kasi kahit ilang taon nang nakalipas, sobrang sakit pa rin for him ang pagkawala ng asawa niya. Natry naman niya magpa-therapy dahil nirecommend ko sa kanya yung kilala kong therapist, hoping that he will still realize that he should help himself to get through the grief. Kaso lahat na lang ng magandang naitulong ko for him, he disregarded it all. Nagsinungaling siya sa akin na kesyo hindi na raw siya nireplyan ng therapist niya pero hindi niya alam, tinanong ko sa therapist niya kung nabasa ba niya message ng kuya ko, ang sabi ng therapist yung kuya ko daw ang hindi na nagreply. So since then, nabalewala na lahat ng therapy sessions kasi hindi na niya tinuloy and naging mapride siya na hindi niya need ng anyone's help kahit yung totoo apektado na pati relationships niya sa amin na family niya. Akala mo lahat na lang kaaway niya. Nagleave na siya sa lahat ng group chat naming family.

Nawalan na ako ng pag-asa para sa kanya. Napagod na ako maging present sa buhay niya kasi pati ako kinakalaban na niya kahit siya na nga ang tinutulungan. Just a few days ago, meron siyang pinapakisuyo sa akin and I assured him gagawin ko naman. Pero the following day nung nasa car kami kasi nakikisabay ako sa kanila ng pamangkin ko papasok, inulit na naman niya pinapakisuyo niya and nakulitan na ako kaya sabi ko ""pwede ba patience lang kasi gagawin ko naman?"" Natrigger na siya sa word na ""patience"" at tila parang allergic siya sa word na yon. Tinaasan na ako ng boses in front of my nephew who is still a kid and his yaya. Sabi sa akin ng pataas ang tono, ""anong patience? Hindi ko kailangan ng patience! Ang kailangan ko is sagot dun sa pinapakisuyo ko! Kasi kung wala rin mangyayari edi wala!"" Tapos nagmumura na siya after that kahit may kasama kaming bata. Shut up na lang ako and hindi na ako nagpaalam sa kanya after that. Take note ha, hindi lang ito yung first time na tinaasan niya ako ng boses. Yung isang incident naman ay tinaasan niya ako ng boses while we were in queue sa isang coffee shop and naririnig siya ng mga baristas kasi ang lakas ng boses niya sa akin. He never apologized for that.

Since then and as of this writing, never nakarealize yung kuya ko na nagkamali siya. He never apologized to me. Nung cinonfront siya ng mom ko about what he did to me, ako pa sinisisi niya. Kaya daw niya tinataasan boses niya kasi hindi ko raw siya naririnig kahit hindi naman yun totoo. Nung magkausap kami sa car nun, magkatabi kami nun. Wala siyang remorse na nakakahurt siya, and worst of all, wala siyang utang na loob sa mga magagandang nagawa ko para sa kanya at sa pamangkin ko. Nalulungkot ako kasi kahit anong dasal ko na makaahon na ang kapatid ko from his depression, parang hindi pa time pala para umahon kasi ayaw niya pa rin tulungan sarili niya.

Oo, I'm sure sasabihin ninyo na this is out of my control na and I can only do so much for my kuya. Kaso gusto ko lang i-express na nalulungkot lang din ako para sa pamangkin ko kasi at 7 years old, naoobserve niya itong lahat—yung katoxican ng Daddy niya. Hindi ko alam kung paano ako makakalapit sa pamangkin ko lalo na ngayon bakasyon na siya. Iniisip ko na kamustahin ko na lang siya through his yaya. Ako rin kasi nagsisilbing mother figure niya. I also work in the same school where my nephew studies kaya kahit papano, nababantayan at nagagabayan ko siya.

Also, I just want to clarify na alam ko naman na walang time limit ang grief. It is a fact that you can never easily move on from losing a loved one. It is never my intention to invalidate ang mga single parents going through a hard time in dealing with grief. I feel for all of you po. Ang point lang ng post na ito ay dahil sa pain na naidulot ng kuya ko sa akin. Marami rin akong pinagdadaanan sa buhay ko pero hindi ko na shineshare sa kanya kasi alam kong iinvalidate niya lang din ako, as always. Wala rin magandang idudulot if maging open ako sa kanya kasi gusto niya siya lagi ang bida. Ginagawa niyang excuse ang pagiging single parent niya for his bad behavior. Wala rin siyang friends na pinagco-confidan niya kasi sabi niya anti-social or introvert daw siya. Kaya wala rin talaga siyang outlet and healthy coping strategies na alam. 

Ipapasa-Diyos ko na lang talaga ito. Wala naman na ako magagawa bukod sa ipagdasal siya. Pagod na ako umintindi.",4,1743074278.0,OffMyChestPH,1,1.0,False

* **Mirror, Mirror:** Stare into the mirror and have a deep conversation with your reflection about your story. Bonus points for dramatic monologues.
* **Future You Fury:** Imagine your future self, successful and published, berating you for procrastinating. Write a scene about their disappointment.

**Bonus Tip:** Reward yourself with something ridiculous for every completed scene. Like a dance party to the Macarena or wearing a lampshade as a hat. Embrace the absurdity!

Remember, writer's block is just a temporary hurdle. With a little wit and these offbeat techniques, you'll be back to churning out words like a caffeinated squirrel on a sugar rush. Now go forth and conquer that blank page! (And maybe wear a lampshade for good luck.)",1,1743074118.0,writingthruit,0,1.0,False

Winburn Market, 1198 Winburn Drive, has made complaints that the ""pop up"" stand business next to them is illegally set up. I have made contact with the individuals several months ago, and they provided me with documentation from the city for their business license and location. They set up every morning between approximately 0600-1000 hours, and are located on McCullough Drive. Could this ""business"" be investigated or looked into to make sure they are operating legally as far as the city is concerned? As far as I can tell they are selling coffee/other liquids, and various foods.

Two weeks ago we finally got together after having two big fights and a couple of weeks of no contact, and about a month of both of us dating people off the apps. We hooked up and decided to pursue a relationship officially, which meant we had to dump the people we had casually been seeing. Nothing serious, these people were fine. Initially my partner had a date scheduled with the person they had been seeing about 5 days after we started dating and he was going to cook for this person. And I was like, this makes me uncomfortable and I think it’s weird (I dumped my guy over coffee on a Monday), and my partner was a bit dismissive but I didnt make much out of it/didn’t care. He wound up going for a walk with the person because they were having a bad day, then let them know I am in the picture and there was no longer romantic intent. Fast forward 4 days later, my partner tells me he is going to an event with this person and I don’t make much out of it either because it seemed casual and friendly but they ended up getting dinner, and my partner slept over afterwards at mine afterwards and we had a nice time together.

I trust my partner deeply, I know they wouldn’t do anything insane, but I told him yesterday that virtually hanging out in a similar capacity as before (i.e. going to an event and getting dinner sounds very date-y to me), didn’t sit right with me and that I thought it was weird. Partner assured me the person is very well aware of my existence and that they have clear boundaries, and said he doesn’t understand why this bothers me because it’s very platonic to him. He’s been to maybe 5-8 dates with this person before dumping them, visited their place twice and made out with them once.

Am I overreacting? I don’t think they shouldn’t be friends and I’m not going to regulate who my partner befriends and whatnot bc that is toxic as hell, but I think it’s weird to be hanging out one-on-one in a fairly intimate capacity not even after 5 days of dumping this person. My partner doesn’t have a lot of friends outside of our friend circle and is trying to make more friends, which I think is important, but this is weird, right?

I knew I had a lot to learn from my neighbors. Maybe I could teach them something, too.

By Salvatore J. Tagliaren i  March 26, 2025

A view of the lone tower rising above bare trees and snow covered ground along the banks of Jamaica Pond. The tower's reflection is visible in the water.

The Jamaicaway Tower and Townhouses, a place I proudly call home, stands 30 stories above Jamaica Plain. But what truly distinguishes our community isn’t the building’s impressive height — it’s the quiet revolution unfolding within, driven by possibility and the power of connection of its 400 residents.

The seed for the idea was planted years ago when I heard about a successful lifelong learning program in Sarasota, Florida, staffed solely by the residents of Pelican Cove.

For a couple of years, it remained just that — a seed, discussed in hallways, debated over coffee, yet never quite taking root. But a question lingered with me for years: Why not us?

One day I brought up the idea to my neighbor David Stern, a successful landscape architecture photographer skilled in making creative course visuals. Like me, he had been impressed with the life stories and experiences of fellow residents. He was enthusiastic that with my organizational skills and his creative abilities, we could overcome the significant challenges we faced: no budget and few places in the complex that could accommodate classes.

We knew we were surrounded by a wealth of talent and experience. Retired professors with expertise in medicine, literature, and conflict resolution lived among us. Artists were ready to guide others on creative journeys. A dedicated gardener was willing to demystify the art of orchid cultivation. The potential within our walls was undeniable — a treasure trove waiting to be unlocked.

And so, “Towering Minds” was born. Launched last fall, our resident-led initiative demonstrates that learning needn’t be confined to traditional classrooms. It doesn’t require expensive tuition. Instead, we gather in the comfort of our living rooms, kitchens, and communal spaces to explore an array of subjects. Our experiment in education is personal, free, and transformative, shaping the very fabric of our community.

At its core, the program that evolved is about discovering hidden talents, reigniting old passions, and igniting new ones. It’s a reminder that learning isn’t limited by age — it’s a lifelong adventure. Course offerings reflect this diversity of interests and talents. Curious about Hamlet and its modern relevance? There’s a class for that. Interested in learning to make savory dishes such as spanakopita? “Cooking Greek Style” awaits. From exploring the history of Boston women in medicine to discussing Sigmund Freud’s and Viktor Frankl’s lasting influence, the subjects reflect the wide-ranging interests of those who live here.

While earning my PhD in human behavior and leadership, I spent three years studying with Dr. Frankl, author of Man’s Search for Meaning. I teach a course on logotherapy, a form of psychotherapy developed by Frankl, and how it can dramatically improve one’s life. David teaches a photography course, taking students to Jamaica Pond and the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University.

But the true magic of Towering Minds lies in the connections it fosters. It’s not just about the knowledge gained — it’s about the people we share it with. Suddenly, the woman with whom you’ve only exchanged polite nods in the hallway becomes a partner in discussing the complex characters you’re reading about in your short stories class. Your neighbor, whom you used to simply greet as they walked their dog around nearby Jamaica Pond, is now your companion in exploring the art of composing creative photographs. These shared experiences transcend the simple act of attending a class — they cultivate a sense of belonging, of feeling seen, heard, and valued.

In just half a year, the response to Towering Minds has been electrifying, with more than 50 residents taking classes. It’s a powerful reminder that learning flourishes when individuals come together to embrace the joy of discovery. It affirms that community isn’t built solely on bricks and mortar, but on shared experiences, laughter, and moments of insight that unite us.

And the best part? The energy is contagious. We’re already looking ahead —dreaming of new courses, planning field trips to museums, gardens, and local theaters. We’re not just residents living side by side. We’re crafting purpose.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Have you ever thought about growing your own coffee plants indoors? It’s an exciting project that blends the joy of gardening with the delicious reward of homegrown coffee. Hydroponic coffee plants thrive in a liquid nutrient solution which means you can grow them inside your home with ease. Let’s take a deeper look into how you can nurture these unique plants right from your living room.

### Understanding Hydroponics for Coffee Plants

Hydroponics is a method of growing plants without soil, using mineral nutrient solutions in a water solvent. This approach offers several benefits, especially for coffee plants:

- **Soil-Free:** Hydroponics eliminates the need for soil, making indoor gardening cleaner and more manageable.
- **Space-Efficient:** You can optimize your space as hydroponic setups are generally compact.
- **Controllable Environment:** You can easily manage water, nutrients, and light, tailoring the growth conditions to suit your coffee plants perfectly.

### Choosing the Right Coffee Plant Variety

When growing hydroponic coffee plants indoors, the variety you choose is crucial. Arabica and Robusta are the two most common types:

- **Arabica:** This is known for its smooth flavor and aromatic qualities. However, it may require more care to thrive indoors.
- **Robusta:** This variety is hardier and typically easier to grow, making it a great choice for beginners.

### Setting Up Your Hydroponic System

Your hydroponic system will be the backbone of your coffee-growing venture. There are various types of systems you can choose from, including:

- **Deep Water Culture:** Plants are suspended in nutrient-rich water with an air pump for oxygen.
- **Nutrient Film Technique:** A continuous flow of nutrient solution runs over the plant roots.
- **Drip Systems:** Nutrient solution drips onto the base of the plants, promoting strong root growth.

### Selecting the Right Nutrients

Your coffee plants will require specific nutrients to thrive in a hydroponic system. Look for nutrient solutions that contain:

Shop Here -&gt;https://hownow101.github.io/Hydroponics  
- Nitrogen for foliage growth
- Phosphorus for root development and flowering
- Potassium to strengthen plant health

Make sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions on mixing the solutions accurately. Regularly monitor pH levels, aiming for a range of 5.5 to 6.5 for optimal growth.

### Lighting Considerations for Indoor Coffee Plants

Indoor coffee plants need ample light to flourish. A bright, sunny window may suffice, but supplemental grow lights are often necessary for the best results. Here are some tips:

- Use full-spectrum LED grow lights for balanced growth.
- Provide at least 12-16 hours of light per day for optimal growth.
- Adjust light distance based on the plant's growth stage; seedlings need less light, while established plants may require more.

### Caring for Your Hydroponic Coffee Plants

Regular care is critical for healthy coffee plants. Here are some straightforward care tips:

- **Watering:** Ensure your hydroponic system has sufficient water while preventing overflows.
- **Pruning:** Regularly trim leaves to promote air circulation and prevent diseases.
- **Monitoring for Pests:** Keep an eye out for pests such as aphids or spider mites. Use organic treatments if necessary.

### Harvesting Your Coffee Beans

Once your coffee plants mature, usually after 3-4 years, you'll see small, cherry-like fruits that contain coffee beans. Here’s what to keep in mind:

- Harvest the cherries when they turn a bright red color.
- Process your beans by removing the outer layer and drying them before roasting.
- Enjoy the satisfaction of brewing coffee from beans grown right at home!

With patience and proper care, you can raise thriving hydroponic coffee plants indoors. The journey from seedling to brewing your first cup is a rewarding experience for any coffee enthusiast. So why wait? Start your indoor coffee-growing adventure today!

The Benefits and Challenges of Cultivating Your Own Coffee Beans at Home
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Growing your own coffee beans at home can be an exciting and rewarding experience. With the right knowledge and a bit of patience, you can cultivate your own supply of coffee that boasts rich flavors and aromas. However, like any gardening project, there are benefits and challenges to consider.

### Benefits of Growing Your Own Coffee Beans

#### Freshness and Flavor

When you grow your own coffee beans, you have the unique advantage of enjoying freshly harvested beans. Fresh coffee has a more vibrant flavor, and the differences can be notable compared to store-bought varieties. The taste profile can vary dramatically based on origin, processing methods, and even the roast of the beans, allowing you to craft your own signature coffee experience.

#### Better Control Over Quality

By cultivating coffee yourself, you have complete control over the growing conditions. You can choose organic practices, avoid harmful pesticides, and ensure the plants receive the right nutrients. This means you can enjoy high-quality beans that are grown according to your standards, giving you peace of mind about what you consume.

#### Cost Savings in the Long Run

While establishing a coffee garden might seem expensive initially, growing your own beans can save you money over time. Once your plants mature and start yielding fruit, you will not need to purchase coffee beans from the store regularly.

#### A Fun and Educational Hobby

Growing coffee beans can be an enjoyable hobby that engages you with nature. It can teach you about plant biology, sustainability, and the coffee production process. Additionally, watching your plants grow and flourish can be immensely rewarding.

### Challenges of Growing Your Own Coffee Beans

#### Space Requirements

Cultivating coffee plants requires enough space to accommodate their growth, which can be a challenge for those living in apartments or small houses. Coffee plants can grow quite large, often reaching heights of 5 to 10 feet, so you need to plan accordingly. If you lack space, you might consider keeping your plants in containers to manage their size better.

#### Climate and Environment

Coffee plants thrive in specific climates, requiring temperatures between 60°F and 70°F (15°C to 24°C) and humidity levels between 30% and 60%. If you live in a colder climate, you may need to provide a warm indoor environment, like a greenhouse or a well-lit room, which can be challenging.

#### Time and Patience

From seed to harvest, coffee plants can take 3 to 4 years to produce beans. This long waiting period might deter some aspiring growers. Additionally, harvesting and processing coffee takes time and effort, so be prepared for a commitment if you plan to pursue this as a hobby.

Shop Here -&gt;https://hownow101.github.io/Hydroponics  
#### Pests and Diseases

Like any plant, coffee beans are susceptible to pests and diseases. Common issues include coffee borers and fungal infections. Keep a close eye on your plants and be proactive about managing these threats through healthy growing practices or organic pest control methods.

### Tips for Successful Coffee Cultivation

- **Choose the Right Variety:** Look for Arabica or Robusta types that suit your environment.
- **Use Quality Soil:** Ensure your plants have nutrient-rich, well-draining soil.
- **Provide Adequate Light:** Coffee plants need bright, indirect sunlight for optimum growth.
- **Be Patient:** Enjoy the gardening process, and don’t rush the journey to coffee beans.

Whether you decide to take the plunge into coffee cultivation or merely dream about it, understanding the benefits and challenges empowers you. With the right care and dedication, you can enjoy the deliciously satisfying experience of drinking coffee made from beans you have nurtured from the very beginning.

### Conclusion

Growing hydroponic coffee plants indoors offers a unique and rewarding experience, especially for those with a passion for gardening and a love for coffee. As outlined in the essential guide for beginners, the process requires thoughtful planning, the right equipment, and some patience as you nurture your plants from seed to harvest. Embracing this method can lead to fresher, tastier coffee beans right from your own home, allowing you to enjoy a personal touch in every cup.

However, cultivating your own coffee beans also comes with its set of challenges. You may encounter issues such as managing space, humidity, and light requirements. Understanding these factors is vital for successful growth and can be the difference between a flourishing indoor garden and a disappointing experience. It's important to stay informed and adapt your approach based on what works best for your specific environment.

Despite these challenges, the benefits of growing hydroponic coffee plants at home can far outweigh the hardships. The joy of nurturing your own plants, the satisfaction of brewing your own unique coffee, and the potential cost savings over time can make this endeavor well worth the effort. Plus, there’s a sense of pride that comes from sipping on a drink crafted from beans you grew yourself.

1jl1d43,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jl1d43,The AKKO MU01 Keyboard... A humble 'first-timer' review submission:,"Whilst it is nowhere near as impressive as some of the builds I have seen on here, they have inspired me to start small and work my way up. 


This is my first 'proper' mechanical keyboard - the Akko MU01.


I bought this from Akko directly with the 'Autumn' keycap setup and Akko Rosewood switches. It took a pleasantly-surprisingly reasonable time to deliver to Scotland and I was immediately impressed by the quality of the packaging and materials. 


It exceeded previous purchases from Corsair, Razer and Logitech that cost an appreciable amount more than the MU01.


I absolutely love the aesthetics of wood and plants so, as my 'leisure room' is filled with natural wood and large plants, I really wanted to look at wood-based keyboards.


I don't have the confidence to fully dive in at the deep end of spec all my own keyboard parts, but I was referred to Akko and really liked the look of this. Yes, it's a 60% board but this particular unit is only really used for gaming, so the missing keys are no great inhibitor.


The walnut case is excellently machined. There are no marks, scratches, imperfections or sharp edges anywhere and I can only give it a 5 star mark for quality. The small 'brass' metallic strip that runs along the top of the number keys looks great and provides a perfect contrast against the wood and the keys. It really responds well to a bit of buffing, as does the walnut wood case - Akko supply a small jar of wood wax for keeping the wood in pristine condition. I have my own wood wax I'll use but it's really nice to see this attention to detail from Akko. It  shows that they know how wood will respond to care and maintenance.


The PCB has south-facing RGB LEDs. Initially, this troubled me but then I realised that this hang-up was pre-programmed from garish gamer keyboards and marketing and that in real use cases I only ever used a static neon green backlight on any of my previous keyboards. The MU01 has the lighting turned off and I don't miss it at all. If you like the idea of RGB, then that option is there although obviously there is the tradeoff that, whilst the switches and keycaps theoretically have greater compatibility with this arrangement, the backlighting really is only good for illuminating the gaps between the keys rather than the keys themselves.


Speaking of switches, I went with the Akko Rosewood linear models. Akko claim they have an operating force of 40g and a total travel of 4mm with a 2mm pre-travel. This means little to me at my stag of experience but likely will for the more seasoned out there. 


'Clicky' simply isn't for me (unobtrusiveness is a much underestimated virtue, for me), and Tactile doesn't appeal much more, but these Linear switches are fabulous. Fabulous. They are opaque in build, so RGB-fans will need to bear in mind the further-reduced lighting performance as opposed to translucent switches, but they have a very smooth, quiet action that really surprised me. I was entirely prepared to change these units out once the keyboard had arrived but they have wormed their way under my skin and although I'll definitely try some other varieties at some point, the immediate desire has vanished. There is no scratchiness during the switch travel and they all seem very well seated and held firmly in place. Akko say they are all factory-lubricated and whilst I'm not at the level of confidently telling how good a job they do at this, I can confirm that everything feels good and there are no negative comments to make.


The keycaps that came with the keyboard are called 'Autumn' and consist of a red and black colour scheme with the numbers and letter being black and the remaining 'function' keys one of two shades of red. The keys feel fabulous and are great to type on, although the legends on the lighter red keys can be difficult to see in certain light conditions and changing the keys was always on the cards. The supplied keys are in a profile Akko call 'MOA' which is a universally flat, slightly rounded form (the keycap height is 9.8mm) that seems very similar to what some other suppliers call 'KOA'. They are PBT with a dye-sublimated legend technique. Aside from the slight visibility issue they are excellent and I had no real problems - typing is easy, smooth, speedy and accurate.


The sound? Wow. Just, wow. Typing on the Akko MU01 sounds like shaking several very high quality die inside a velvet-lined leather die cup. It positively oozes a rich, warm 'thocky' sound. Now, I'm too new at this to properly identify what is the cause, but I do suspect that this walnut base has at least *something* to do with it. It's a gasket-structure composition and plate mounted stabilisers which gave me pause for thought as I'm not sure how effective they are (changing the keycaps showed that the stabilisers don't actually seem that... *stable*), but replacement screw-in stabilisers can be used and I haven't noticed any issues during use. 


My MU01 measures about 32cm in width and just over 12cm in depth. It's a perfect size for me to game with and allows my arms to be closer together without interfering with mouse movement. Important point though: I would highly recommend a wrist rest. The height of the keyboard is over 3.5cm at most and even at its lowest point it is not much less. It's a deep one if you're used to low profile (or even relatively normal) and for longer sessions your tendons will thank you for some raised support. I made my own out of some walnut repurposed from old furniture and upholstered a memory foam cushion and soft but hardwearing material cover. 


There's a good weight to the keyboard - I can't confirm the actual figure but Akko claim about 850g. I can confirm that it feels very solid and the heft definitely helps to back up the 'premium' feel. Rubber feet on the bottom of the case keep the keyboard in place and you'd have to be undergoing some serious rage-quit shenanigans to get this shuffle during use.


Another highlight for me is that the MU01 does *not* need software to function. Akko supply a web-based software configuration which, to be honest, isn't very well explained and is a bit confusing for me - but it isn't necessary and I haven't needed to use it at all. All functions I need to use are accessible simply through keyboard shortcuts, cutting out the bloat of other more mainstream manufacturer's software parasites.


Whilst I use the keyboard in a wired configuration via the supplied USB A to C cable, it can also be used via Bluetooth or 2.4ghz wireless with the included dongle. I confess that I haven't tried either so cannot speak to their quality but considering the rest of the setup I have no reason to doubt that they work as well as those methods will allow.


My current keycaps are a mixture of two sets, purchased from AliExpress - a 'Matcha' set and a 'Coffee' set. Both are PBT with dye-sub legend markings and they maintain the incredible sound and smoothness of the typing experience. They were an absolute bargain, too. Delivery speed was acceptable but tracking was provided so I was quite confident. These are 'KOA' profile, which seems to be the same as 'MOA' but with a mm or two less height. I think that the colours complement the walnut case as well as each other, and will go well with the new wooden desk I'm in the middle of building.


Eventually I'd like to try some different switches in here. It uses two pin models but can accept five pin so compatibility is good. I'm going through Milktooth videos at present to learn which options might be the best for me to try, but in the meantime I have absolutely no hesitation in recommending the Akko MU01 to anyone who would like a wood-aesthetic, quality-built, smooth and thocky smaller form factor keyboard for a very good comparative price.

Yes, there are many varying factors that can impact how a fragrance smells to you: being shaken up and left out in the cold or heat during shipping, juice age/maturation, the introduction of oxygen to the bottle. But the same fragrance may also smell different to you at different points in your cycle. 

I'm on my period right now and last night decided to spray myself with one of my cozy favorites right before bed, but I found the rose in it extremely strong and borderline stomach-turning, when it's typically a soft and creamy sugary rose gourmand that I find very comfortable. I had a real ""Did the bottle go off?"" moment before realizing, oh, no, it's probably just my 'mones, which would also explain why I'm only wanting to wear rich gourmands when last week I was in a spring fruity floral mood. I'm also one of those people whose sense of smell becomes *extremely* oversensitive when I'm ovulating, to the degree that anyone standing within a five-foot radius just makes me nauseous because I can smell their coffee breath and cigarette stank like they're breathing directly up my nose, and more masculine scents, especially aquatic freshies worn by random men who stand too close on the subway (but also anything too smoky/woody, like Commodity Milk) absolutely turn my stomach during that period. 

So just kinda throwing it out for people who may have looked at the notes of something and thought ""This is perfect, I should love this,"" then smelled it once and recoiled - maybe try it again, but two weeks later! You never know; maybe it's truly not for you based on your skin chemistry, but also, maybe it was literally just that it smelled off because your brain/body/hormones were making you process it differently.",21,1743073230.0,FemFragLab,12,0.96,False

1jl17sl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jl17sl,Nature in Chongqing: Jinfo Mountain’s Bamboo Shoots Ladder – A Challenge for the Brave,"This spot sits on the western slope of Jinfo Mountain. It’s a mix of wooden ladders built by bamboo shoots harvesters along cliffs and “paths” carved into the rock. Some sections of these vertical cliff “paths” are so narrow you can barely fit one foot! You’ll trek through thick bamboo forests, cross streams, and hike steep mountain trails—some parts even feel like there’s “no path at all.”  

The whole area clings to the vertical cliffs of the karst table mountain. For centuries, local harvesters have risked climbing these dangerous cliffs to collect Nanchuan square bamboo shoots, which grow in remote areas between 1400 and 2500 meters high. The local havesters even took breaks and eat right on the edge of the cliffs! These bamboo shoots are a key local crop and a Chongqing specialty—you’ll often see them in hotpot restaurants.  

Our hike took about 5-6 hours. We fueled up with carbs, protein, fats, vitamins, and minerals midway. During the whole process, you’ve gotta stay super focused and keep high energy levels. By the end, I was practically wobbling like a baby learning to walk… but finishing it gave me pure satisfaction. 

Even though it’s become a tourist spot, the ladders and paths are still totally raw—no safety upgrades. Some areas have zero phone signal, and the hike demands serious mental grit, physical stamina, and solid hiking skills.

1jl17d1,https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/1jl17d1/how_important_is_it_for_learning_resources_to/,How important is it for learning resources to align?,"Hello! I am currently learning German, and I have a question which might be the result of overthinking. I am wondering how important it is for learning resources to be at the same level, or if it perhaps is even better to be at different levels? Hopefully that makes sense, but if not, here is a breakdown of what I mean:

My German learning diet most regularly consists of these tools:

* In-person German course two nights a week
* Coffee Break German premium, which basically feels like a pre-recorded 30 minute course 
* Practice workbook which covers reading and writing skills and grammar concepts
* Watching German language TV which I can understand without subtitles (so, Peppa Pig lol)
* Duolingo (I know)

The thing is, due to different resources moving at different paces, and missing some days/weeks with some due to life, I am in different places with some of them. For example, I am much further ahead in Coffee Break than I am with the workbook. I am coming up on the end of A2 level in CB but am still at the very beginning of A1 in the book, and then the other resources kind of fall somewhere in the middle. Is that a good thing or a bad thing? On the one hand, I am getting review of concepts I've already learned. On the other, I am not getting a whole lot of reinforcements on the more difficult concepts. 

I am not sure if I should, for example, pause on Coffee Break for a month and use the time to catch up in other resources, or plow ahead and not question it. Thanks in advance!",0,1743073044.0,languagelearning,0,0.5,False

I just started my OMAD journey 4 days ago and so far I have felt good and even seem to look tighter, probably due to not being bloated from food. I stopped having breakfast a few weeks ago and as soon as I got used to it I stopped eating lunch too. 

I eat my first meal at around 7pm because I work 7-5 and have an hour long drive home plus the time that it takes me to prepare the dinner. 
During the day I try to drink as much water possible plus I have like 3-4 coffees with no sugar. The thing with what I am maybe cheating is that I put some oat milk in the coffee so I consume cca 200 ml of oatmilk during the day. I am not sure if that is the right way but I hate plain coffee. 

I tend to get very weak around 3-4 pm, but as soon as I leave work it gets better. 

I dont count calories in the evening because I have enough experience with counting to approximate how many have I eaten, but for sure less then a 1000. 

My question is should I stop putting milk in my coffee, is that maybe slowing my progress? 

Also is it better for OMAD to be dinner or lunch? 
I prefer dinner because I like to eat freshly cooked hot food instead of microwaved food and because I assume that it would be very hard to cook for my family and be there while they eat and not be able to eat. But as I said I tend to get week in the afternoon and I have a mind consuming job and when I get weak I cannot focus on work. 

Thanks to everyone in advance and hope this post gets approved <3",3,1743072497.0,omad,3,0.81,False

 I started on MC to help with anxiety, depression and troubled sleep.

 It helps me a lot and it workes  well.
My dosage is rather tiny.

I started with the pattern of 5 days on and two days off then I slowly got into everyday use.

There was a point when I started medicated after having couple of beers on an odd day,  while I never really mixed MC with alcohol before.

So I got worried and I decided to take a tolerance break.

 Day 1 to 3 were pretty terrible, was very moody and unhappy. today was day 4 and it's not too bad.

 I just wanted to ask people more knowledgeable than me what helps you get over the tolerance break.

I also had absolutely no appetite, and could feel the coffee I had that morning still sitting in my stomach hours later. I felt awful and just slept on and off.

At first I was gutted, but honestly, after today, I think it was a blessing in disguise. My new instructor really gave me a whole new perspective — not just on driving, but on the mental side of it too.

She gave me so many helpful tips for dealing with nerves (like not drinking coffee before the test—never even thought of that!). We also talked about possibly pushing my test date by a couple of weeks. She said I’m basically carrying some PTSD from the last three attempts, and that it’s okay to take a step back and breathe. She was super understanding, and even said it’s likely my last instructor was quite new or inexperienced (which I now realise they were).

What really stuck with me was her advice: “Never try to please anyone. Not your instructor, not the examiner — no one.” And that hit me hard, because I’ve definitely been a bit of a people-pleaser, trying to do everything “right” instead of just learning in a way that works for me.

She also spoke so calmly and positively about the examiners and the whole process. It really helped ease all the pressure I’ve been piling on myself.

I just feel lighter now. Genuinely hopeful again. And even if I can’t move the test, I now know I can go into it with a much better mindset.

So yeah — if your instructor isn’t the right fit, or if you’re constantly feeling stressed and pressured, changing instructors isn’t the end of the world. In fact, it might be the best thing you can do for yourself. I honestly think my old instructor meant well by stepping back, and maybe he knew his approach wasn’t working for me.

Anyway — just wanted to share in case anyone else is in a similar place. You’re not alone, and there is a way forward 🙌

Most(all?) psychiatric disorder are tied to inflammation and studies mention TNF-a, some IL cytokines, etc. Even SIBO and dysbiosys were found to produce cytokines.

Not all cytokines are released exclusively by mast cells as other immune cells can do this. But  still... What's the deal with testing only tryptase? Did anyone get an aswear to this question from a doctor?

I think I've seen a maximum of 10 posts on this sub and longcovidhaulers where some people got a more extensive cytokine panel test, which looked at more mediators besides tryptase. Which is ridiculous to me.

I am writing today because yesterday was not such a good day. As the title says, I spilled coffee on the right portion of the keyboard on my 13"" 2020 M1 Macbook Pro. It covers the areas with the brackets, return key, touch id, comma, shift and arrow keys. Immediately after spilling coffe I dried as much as I could with a sheet of a4 paper I had on hand, shut down the computer and then went to get more paper towels. Then, I went home, and on the way I put in the trunk of my car upside down, so coffee would not spill further in the internals, but outside of the keys on the screen.

When I got home, I got my set of screwdrivers and disassembled the computer. I got every bit out and it seems like most of the damage was on the outside of the right speaker, which I cleaned with an old toothbrush and qtips with isopropyl alcohol. The board is untouched. Then, I looked at the keyboard. Coffee seemed to have sipped outside from under the black film covering the backlight of the keyboard.

With tweezers, I gently peeled the right part of that film, reflective on the other side (to reflect the backlight). I found some coffee there, and I cleaned it with q-tips and isopropyl alcohol. After cleaning as much as I could without lifting the film to much, in between there, I assembled the computer back together and it's fine. Except, the backspace and return key were a bit spongy. I then did some more tinkering behind and they seemed to be ok. They sound a bit different (I think), but they feel and work fine.

I then placed the computer on the desk overnight and this morning, all keys are fine, except the right shift key, which is very spongy. Also, after pressing it takes a while to return to its original position. Maybe I'll attach a video. It registers the press, but it feels weird, because it is very soft.

Did I damage something when taking it apart? Is it the coffee? Is there something I can do to save it or should I start looking for a replacement keyboard?

PS: Is there a non destructive way to get the keycaps off and try to clean there?

1jl0vdd,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_OkProgrammer6043/comments/1jl0vdd/tips_for_a_dreamy_prewedding_photoshoot/,Tips for a Dreamy Pre-Wedding Photoshoot,"A pre-wedding photoshoot is a once-in-a-lifetime experience that allows couples to capture the magic of their love story before the big day. It’s a chance to celebrate romance, create lasting memories, and set the tone for your wedding. At **Indian Dream Studio**, we offer meticulously crafted pre-wedding sets to bring your dream photoshoot to life. Whether you envision a regal, romantic, or whimsical theme, we have the perfect backdrop to make your pictures truly mesmerizing.

To ensure that your pre-wedding shoot turns out as dreamy as you imagine, here are some essential tips:

**1. Choose the Right Theme and Set**

Your pre-wedding shoot should reflect your personality and love story. Choosing the right theme will set the mood for your pictures. **Indian Dream Studio** provides a variety of pre-wedding sets, including:

* **Royal Heritage:** Grand palatial backdrops for a regal and traditional touch.
* **Boho Chic:** Rustic, floral, and nature-inspired settings for free-spirited romance.
* **Vintage Romance:** Classic and timeless elements that exude old-world charm.
* **Bollywood Glam:** Dramatic and cinematic sets for a star-studded photoshoot.

Pick a theme that resonates with your love story and aesthetic preferences.

**2. Plan Your Outfits Thoughtfully**

Your attire plays a crucial role in enhancing the overall appeal of your pictures. Here are some outfit ideas to complement different themes:

* **Traditional Elegance:** Sarees, lehengas, or sherwanis for a regal or ethnic theme.
* **Casual & Fun:** Jeans and coordinated t-shirts for a relaxed and playful vibe.
* **Formal Glamour:** Evening gowns and tuxedos for a luxurious and elegant feel.
* **Fusion Fashion:** Indo-western outfits for a unique, contemporary look.

It’s best to coordinate colors with your partner without going too matchy-matchy. Avoid overly bright or neon shades, as they may not photograph well.

**3. Timing is Everything**

The best time to shoot is during the **golden hours**—just after sunrise or before sunset—when natural light is soft and flattering. Harsh midday sunlight can create unwanted shadows, while early morning or evening light adds a dreamy, romantic glow to your photos.

**4. Choose the Right Location**

While **Indian Dream Studio** offers stunning pre-wedding sets, you can also opt for outdoor locations like gardens, beaches, or heritage sites. However, studio sets provide the advantage of controlled lighting and weather conditions, ensuring perfect shots without interruptions.

**5. Experiment with Poses**

Strike a balance between posed and candid moments. Here are some pose ideas to try:

* Walking hand in hand
* Looking into each other’s eyes with a soft smile
* Forehead kisses or gentle embraces
* Playful twirls and dance moves
* Silhouettes against the sunset

Trust your photographer to guide you, but also let your natural chemistry shine through.

**6. Use Props for a Whimsical Touch**

Props can add a magical element to your photoshoot. Some fun and romantic prop ideas include:

* Fairy lights for a twinkling, dreamy effect
* Smoke bombs for a colorful and dramatic touch
* Flower petals for a soft and romantic vibe
* Vintage bicycles or cars for a classic feel
* Books, coffee mugs, or musical instruments to personalize your shoot

Choose props that complement your theme and add depth to your photos.

**7. Focus on Hair and Makeup**

A flawless look is essential for a picture-perfect shoot. Here are some beauty tips:

* Opt for **long-lasting makeup** that enhances your features without looking overdone.
* Keep a **compact mirror and blotting paper** handy to touch up any shine.
* Choose a **hairstyle that complements your outfit and location**—soft curls for a romantic vibe, a sleek bun for a regal look, or loose waves for a natural feel.
* For men, **well-groomed hair and beard** make a significant difference.

**8. Capture Candid Moments**

While posed pictures are great, candid moments bring authenticity and warmth to your album. Some of the best shots come when you forget the camera and simply enjoy each other’s company. Laugh, whisper secrets, dance together—let your love take center stage.

**9. Weather-Proof Your Shoot**

If you’re planning an outdoor shoot, always check the weather forecast. Carry umbrellas or plan for an alternate indoor set at **Indian Dream Studio** to avoid last-minute hassles. If you’re shooting in summer, stay hydrated and carry sunscreen to avoid discomfort.

**10. Trust Your Photographer**

Your photographer is the key to capturing your love story beautifully. Discuss your vision, theme, and must-have shots with them beforehand. At **Indian Dream Studio**, our professional team knows the best angles, lighting techniques, and composition styles to create breathtaking images.

**11. Relax and Have Fun**

The best pictures come when you’re relaxed and enjoying the moment. Don’t stress over perfection—focus on having a great time with your partner. Let your love and chemistry shine through, and your photos will naturally turn out stunning.

**Book Your Dream Pre-Wedding Shoot with Indian Dream Studio**

1jl0uba,https://www.reddit.com/r/5YL/comments/1jl0uba/pitching_ultimate_forms_and_predators_for_the_5yl/,Pitching ultimate forms and predators for the 5YL aliens (playlists 27 & 42),"Like the title says, I’m continuing to give predators and ultimate forms to the 5YL aliens. Today I’m doing the aliens for playlist 27 (which consists of aliens made by PerryPorkchoP) and playlist 42 (which largely consists of aliens who exist in franchises outside of Ben 10).

I’m not an artist, so I don’t have designs for these pitches. Instead, I’ll give broad descriptions for what they would look like and what powers they’d have.

Here’s the 5YL wiki link to the playlists: 

https://5yl.fandom.com/wiki/Ben%27s_Arsenal/27 

https://5yl.fandom.com/wiki/Ben%27s_Arsenal/42 

And here’s my previous pitches if you’re interested: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/5YL/s/07uRekXwEr 

**Bouldercrash**

Bouldercrash is an alien with a fluid body who can make his skin adhesive and break down various materials to repurpose into a suit of armor. He also has a cannon on his arm which he uses to shoot out part of this armor as projectiles.

My idea for Bouldercrash’s predator could also work as his ultimate form. This would be a giant slug with a similar fluid, sticky body, but instead of putting materials on itself, it can absorb them into itself and dissolve them. This predator can eat just about anything this way, but prefers to eat Bouldercrash and will let anything else just pass through it unless it’s starving.

For his ultimate form, I don’t have any one big change, just a bunch of little changes. First, Ultimate Bouldercrash now has four arms (base form Bouldercrash may already be able to grow extra limbs due to his fluidity, but he has them by default in his ultimate form). Second, the canon on Ultimate Bouldercrash’s arm is now a flamethrower that uses the materials in his armor as fuel. 

Finally, Ultimate Bouldercrash can produce orbs from his body that he can roll towards enemies, these orbs will absorb the ground as they move, making them continuously get bigger like snowballs rolling down a mountain. The tradeoff is that Ultimate Bouldercrash can no longer simply shoot chunks of his armor as projectiles. The orbs and his flamethrower are his only options for ranged attacks.

**Backwash**

Backwash is an amphibious alien who can not only breathe underwater, but can store that water into his body to shoot out on land.

For his predator, I’d go with a giant hermit crab that stores sand in its shell and can convert it to super absorbent crystals (similar to kitty litter). This predator would incapacitate Backwash by essentially burying him in these crystals until he dries out.

Backwash has the simplest powerset of this list, so I’ll make a fairly simple change for his ultimate form and just make him a lot bigger. Ultimate Backwash is about the size of a semi truck, which not only increases his strength, but also the amount of water he can store and shoot out (now he can hold enough water to flood a city). 

The tradeoff is that his increased size makes him slower. Two new abilities he could have are detachable water sacks that he can shoot out to suck up water from a distance, and/or the ability to convert water to body mass, allowing him to grow further.

**Punchline**

Punchline is an alien with an elastic body and the ability to harden and mold his hands and feet. Turning to Punchline makes Ben more fun loving and impulsive, making it hard to use this alien without causing collateral damage. 

I’d give Punchline two predators that work have a symbiotic relationship. They’d be a giant parrot covered in a swarm of giant lightning bugs. The parrot would follow Punchline and make wacky sounds while the lightning bugs put on a multicolored light show. This would fully grab Punchline’s attention and make him want to play with his predators, allowing them to trick Punchline into incapacitating himself. The parrot would be able to eat Punchline’s elastic body with its razor sharp beak, while the lightning bugs can generate enough heat to melt and drink parts of him.

For his ultimate form, I’d make it so Punchline’s hands and feet are much more solid than his base form, giving him some more strength and endurance. Also, his arms and legs are curled up like springs, this lets him keep his flexibility and allows him to store and release tension so that his limbs stretch out much faster than before, allowing him to punch with a lot more force and to leap great distances. The downside is that having solid hands and feet takes away some of  his elasticity

**Astronaught**

Astronaught is a wormlike alien with an overactive imagination that wears a suit which allows him to create hard light constructs.

For his predator, I’m imagining a more monstrous version of Ventrilosquid. This would be a giant octopus that can survive in space, turn invisible, and has a mouth on each of its tentacles. It would use each of these mouths to surround Astronaught with various ominous noises. This would trigger Astronaught’s imagination and paranoia, making him act recklessly and possibly incapacitate himself in the process.

For his ultimate form, I’d make it so, instead of just creating constructs, Astronaught can now project his imagination directly into his general vicinity, creating his own imagination realm. This not only boosts the range of Astronaught’s abilities, but people within range are susceptible to believing this realm is reality, depending on how close they are to Ultimate Astronaught, how long they’ve been near him, and on how strong their will is to resist this.

The tradeoff is that Ultimate Astronaught is also susceptible to confusing his imagination for reality, and can become so lost in his own realm that he may be dependent on someone else to touch his Omnitrix and transform him.

**Vitaliyeti**

Vitaliyeti is a giant yeti-like dog who’s able to walk indefinitely without getting tired, and can boost others’ energy by letting them touch him.

I have two ideas for the predator’s design. It could either be based on a wooly mammoth or a wendigo, as both of these creatures are associated with the cold (like yetis) and are both imposing enough that they could feasibly overpower Vitaliyeti. I don’t need to give this predator any special powers besides enhanced strength, but one idea I had is to say it has super speed, but only has the energy to use its speed one day per year, and has to spend the rest of the year hibernating to rebuild its energy. This would work well as a contrast against Vitaliyeti’s slow but steady movement.

For his ultimate form, the first thing to do is give Vitaliyeti visibly sharp claws and teeth, as this is the clearest way to turn him from a gentle giant to a fighting machine. In terms of abilities, I’d amplify his vitality sharing power so people who touch him aren’t just energized, but are now filled with adrenaline, making them better prepared for a fight. He could also have the power to drain people’s vitality, allowing him to make his enemies too tired to fight back.

**Wormwork**

Wormwork is Ben’s transformation for the worms from Men in Black. He’s elastic, can regenerate from injuries, and loves coffee.

I’m just gonna say his predator is a giant robin. It doesn’t need any special powers outside of flight and being big enough to swallow Wormwork whole (to bypass his regeneration). This is kind of a cop out on my part, but considering how many aliens I still have to get through, I’ll take the easy out where I can get it.

For his ultimate form, I’ll expand on Wormwork’s love of coffee to give him caffeine induced super speed. On top of that, I’ll give him a shell that he can curl up into and bounce around like Cannonbolt, only a lot lighter (he can’t break through walls) and faster (it’s next to impossible to see where he’s bouncing, and you just see a bunch of blurry lines). 

This shell would be an aesthetic reference to a coffee bean as well as being a reference to a Mexican jumping bean, which moves because it has larvae living inside it. The tradeoff is that Ultimate Wormwork is much more impulsive than his base form.

**Pacadumb**

Pacadumb is Ben’s transformation for Fred FredBurger (yes!) from The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy.

This is another alien where I don’t think I need to get too fancy for his predator. Anything with an enhanced physiology and sharp claws should be able to overpower Pacadumb pretty easily. For the design, I’d keep it in the theme of Billy and Mandy by making it an animalistic version of the Boogey Man.

For his ultimate form, I’d basically make him a mini version of Trombipulor, making him buffer and giving him a stronger prehensile trunk. On top of that, Ultimate Pacadumb could have the power to store comically large objects in his bellybutton (in reference to how Fred Fredburger brags about being able to stick two fingers in his bellybutton), and his mucus could be upgraded so that anyone it touches won’t just be angry, but will temporarily lose their sanity.

**Vertebreak**

Vertebreak is Ben’s transformation for Boris the Animal from Men in Black. He’s an alien with the power to manipulate his own skeleton, which he uses to shapeshift, shoot bones out of his body, and even detach sentient bones to do his bidding.

Since Vertebreak has skeleton themed powers, I’d base his predator on flesh. This would be a four legged blob of loose skin that can catch Vertebreak by essentially throwing one of its skin flaps at him like a net. It also constantly produces an extremely acidic sweat, which in addition to deterring attackers, is useful for dissolving Vertebreak’s body to make him edible.

For his ultimate form, I’d make Vertebreak significantly larger and give him more bones to utilize. Now instead of making bug sized drones, he can make more complex constructs out of bones and have them do his bidding, but the more bones he uses to make these constructs, the less he has for himself and the smaller he becomes. The tradeoff is that, while Ultimate Vertebreak can still manipulate his own skeleton, he can no longer shapeshift as seamlessly as his base form.

**Prick**

Prick is Ben’s transformation for Argit’s species, a humanoid porcupine who can shoot quills that act as tranquilizers.

For his predator, the obvious choice is to have a creature with hard plating on its skin to block the quills, but I wanted to think of something else, as this alone already renders Prick defenseless. Instead, I’d make it a Hydra-like creature with about ten heads. Its body has this plating, but its heads are vulnerable to Prick’s quills. This predator will be knocked out if all of its heads get pricked, but will stay moving so long as one of its heads is awake. This means Prick's powers are still useful in defending himself, but it will be more difficult than usual.

For his ultimate form, I’d reform Prick’s quills so they now coat his whole body like a suit of armor and can form blades on his arms, making him better suited for close ranged combat. Anyone who Ultimate Prick hits with these blades will be paralyzed as if they were hit with a quill.

Ultimate Prick can also emit the toxins from the quills in a gaseous state, infecting anyone who breathes it in. This bypasses the defenses people might normally have against his quills, like armor or his predator’s extra heads. The tradeoff is that Ultimate Prick can no longer shoot out his quills. He can only rely on his blades and his venomous gas.

**Overkill**

Overkill is Ben’s transformation for the Venom symbiote from Marvel. It’s a black goo that can combine with a living organism to make it more powerful and aggressive. Overkill is a part of Ben’s parasite playlist, meaning Ben can’t turn into him directly, but can equip him to another of his alien forms

Overkill has a weakness to both fire and sound, so I’d base his predator on fireworks. This would be a sentient ball of energy that makes a high pitched noise as it moves, and can shoot out a part of itself as an explosive projectile. This predator would use these projectiles to separate Overkill from his host, then use its heat to evaporate Overkill and absorb his remains.

For his ultimate form, first I’d mitigate Overkill’s weakness to fire and sound (he’s still vulnerable to them, but it’s not as much of a trump card as it is against his base form). Next, I’d make it so he’s no longer a parasite. Ultimate Overkill has enough control of his body that he can take on a humanoid shape without the need for a host.

Instead of bonding to a host, Ultimate Overkill can absorb someone’s abilities by absorbing them into himself. Similar to how Malware can’t merge with technology but can absorb it. The tradeoff is that, since he’s no longer a parasite, Ultimate Overkill can’t enhance the powers of Ben’s other transformation. Also, the process of absorbing another person’s abilities is fatal to the person being absorbed, which severely limits when Ben would use this power.

**Truffle**

Truffle is an alien from Dragonball who can manipulate Ki (life energy) and is especially adept at manipulating plant life.

Truffle is from an alternate version of the Dragonball universe, so I’ll base his predator on a Dragonball villain. This would be a giant caterpillar resembling Majin Buu. It’s extremely durable and can convert Ki into pure heat, which allows it to burn through any of Truffle’s plant based defenses, as well as to cook Truffle before eating him. This predator can metamorphosize into a butterfly, with its caterpillar form resembling innocent Buu and its butterfly form resembling Kid Buu.

Again, Truffle is from an alternate version of the Dargonball universe, and his design kind of reminds me of baby Groot, so I’d make his ultimate form resemble adult Groot and give him the powers of a Saiyan. The catch is that Ultimate Truffle doesn’t have enough Ki to use these powers properly and has to constantly absorb Ki from his environment. 

Unlike someone like Darkstar, who absorbs the energy first and then uses it, Ultimate Truffle uses the Ki first, going into a sort of “Ki debt” and his body will repay that debt by involuntarily siphoning Ki from the nearest source (this absorption has a tier system, where he’ll take Ki from plants first, and then take the Ki from intelligent life if he didn’t get enough). This means it’s best to use Ultimate Truffle in a place lush with plant life and lacking in intelligent life. Otherwise, Ben risks running out of Ki, or worse, accidentally killing someone to repay his debt.

**Lank**

Lank is Ben’s transformation for the Irkens from Invader Zim, a highly intelligent alien equipped with a “PAK” that gives a variety of weapons and tools.

I’d make his predator and Frankenstein-like monster who looks like various farm animals stitched together. This would exploit Lank’s weakness to touching meat, and would be a reference to the “Ham Demon” who was a villain in Invader Zim. This predator could have the power to disassemble itself, giving it the option to fight as an army of small animals or as one hulking creature.

In Invader Zim, the PAK is apparently the source of Zim’s consciousness, so for his ultimate form, I’d say that the PAK was able to dispose of its body and replace it with a new, entirely mechanical body. This would greatly improve Lank’s physiology, as well as give him a broader variety of weapons. 

The tradeoff is that losing his organic body means Ultimate Lank can no longer feel emotions, this creates the risk of Ben losing his humanity if he stays in this form too long, and like Ultimate Astronaught, he may not change out of this form of his own accord, and need someone else to do it for him.",2,1743071544.0,5YL,1,1.0,False

When he finished, he inhaled deeply, steadying his mind – or at least mustering enough resolve to swing his legs over the edge of the bed and tug on his work uniform. He felt suspended between two abysses: one nameless, the other all too familiar. *Poverty*. Jord imagined himself on a tightrope, terrified his destination was no tangible place but a mirage – one that lured him onward only to drown him in memories, all while shadows writhed below. They moaned, screamed, mocked. Unaware of his own trembling, he hugged himself.

After coffee and the morning’s rituals, he bid a muted farewell to the stirring household and stepped outside. The streets lay deserted save for the graveyard shifters, their hunched silhouettes more spectral than human. They shuffled, one foot dragged grudgingly after the other, eyes hollow as if they’d clawed through the nine hells and back. Dawn had yet to break when Jord reached the security gate, nor when he arrived at Lapo’s favoured track.

‘Morning,’ Jord said.‘Morning,’ Lapo replied. ‘You sure about…? Never mind. If you’re here, you’re fit enough.’ He shrugged. ‘Let’s begin.’

After warming up, Jord ventured, ‘Haven’t you noticed anything… off lately? Like… more violence?’

Lapo stared in silence – seconds stretched into small eternities. ‘Violence? Suppose you’re onto something. But the cat’s out the bag, isn’t it? Latvians. Folks are feeling the pressure, simmering ’til they boil. So far, four kidnappings – your family included – two high-stakes robberies, a dozen petty squabbles. Like they’ve forgotten the law exists. Settling scores face-to-face, as if we’re back in some bloody fable.’

‘No – what I mean is something more… *unnatural*.’ Jord’s gaze remained fixed ahead, muscles taut, heart pounding in his chest. He refused to succumb, deliberately forcing his eyes away from the stars that inexplicably shimmered in the daylight.

Lapo arched an eyebrow. ‘Unnatural? Ghosts? Monsters?’

‘Yes… something like that.’ Jord’s voice wavered.

Lapo scoffed. ‘In thirty-odd years with the forces, I’ve never seen anything of the sort. Delirious men and women raving about the occult? Aye. Ghosts and their ilk? Never.’ His voice hardened, though his gaze betrayed a flicker of concern. ‘So, yes, I find your… *discourse* troubling.’

He leaned forward, birds chirping in the distance. ‘Tell me – you’ve had palpitations, haven’t you? Heart tremors? The doctors were vague about your condition. Could it be your faculties are… impaired?’ A pause, tactical. ‘I’ve handled lads in your state. If you’d prefer, we’ll reassign you. Strictly clerical roles. With time, you might regain your wits.’

Jord swallowed the rebuke like a mouthful of ash. *Maybe Lapo’s right*, he conceded, flexing his still-trembling hands. *Maybe the warehouse night carved deeper than flesh*. Yet his gaze remained stubbornly earthbound, refusing to acknowledge the swollen stars crowding the sky.

‘Apologies, sir. We’re all… stretched thin. I’m fit to continue.’

Lapo studied him, eyes narrowing at the plural *we*. For a breath, Jord thought he glimpsed something behind his mentor’s granite demeanour – a fissure of doubt, perhaps even guilt. Then it vanished.

‘Your funeral,’ Lapo muttered, hefting a practice sabre – one he had grabbed from a bag near the track. He rolled his shoulders, settling into a stance. ‘*En garde.*’

The drills unfolded with metronomic brutality. Jord’s parries lacked their usual precision, his footwork leaden. Lapo’s critiques grew barbed.

‘Sir – ’ Jord panted between clashes, ‘ – when do the foreign instructors arrive?’

Lapo paused, blade tip grazing Jord’s collarbone. ‘Two weeks.’ His free hand gestured skyward. Jord flinched. ‘Ministry wants a show. Theatre for the attachés.’

*The stars*, Jord thought wildly, *he means the stars*. But Lapo’s finger merely jabbed at the compound’s administrative spire.

‘They’ll want drills. Urban simulations.’ The sabre flicked dismissively. ‘Clean warfare – no bloodstains for the diplomats’ silk.’ He paused. ‘Or at least, that’s what *should* happen. In reality, they’re here as foreign spectators, observing and studying our military infrastructure.’ His tone darkened. ‘It’s foolish to hand over this much intelligence to our adversaries, but the top brass believe themselves above such reproaches.’ Lapo spat onto the ground. ‘Fools, the lot of them,’ he muttered.

‘Clean warfare, sir?’

The cold morning air carried a biting edge, swirling over the frost-laced track. Each breath came with a sharp chill, the kind that settled in the bones. Lapo stood at the centre, sabre in hand, its steel catching the weak dawn light as he idly rotated it in slow, deliberate circles.

‘Means they think no white weapons should be involved – bayonets, knives, that sort of thing,’ he said, his tone edged with quiet scorn. A gust of wind sent a shiver through the grass. ‘But, in my humble opinion, you should have the basics in *all* forms of combat. One never knows when such things will prove useful.’

The sabre flicked outward, carving through the crisp morning air. ‘Say you’ve got a black weapon – pistol, rifle. A man comes at you with a knife. Orders say no discharge. What then?’

Jord parted his lips to answer, but Lapo was already moving, the sabre slicing phantom lines through the air. ‘First – awareness. What surrounds you? A crowd? A wall at your back? Are you cut off from your squad? Details shift the outcome.’ He paced slowly, boots crunching on frost-bitten grass. ‘Second – assessment. Who’s your assailant? A fit man? A woman? A frail old man? A child?’ The blade stilled. ‘Every scenario demands a different answer.’

The track stretched emptily around them, the distant hum of city life still sluggish in the early hour. Jord exhaled, watching his breath coil in the cold.

‘If an old man comes at you with a knife, don’t scoff. Desperation *rots* reason.’ The sabre’s tip hovered near Jord’s wrist, then flicked to his collarbone. ‘A man past his prime can still drive steel between your ribs if fear makes you hesitate. Learn well, and you can disarm him. A child, though? A fit man? A trained woman?’ Lapo shook his head. ‘A different beast entirely.’

*That happened to him?* Jord’s thoughts snagged. *What would drive an old man to wield a knife? Hopelessness?* The idea unsettled him.

Lapo continued, voice steady. ‘If nothing else, training in white weapons sharpens your instincts. You’ll *see* your enemy’s next move before they make it. Their weight shifts – tells you if they’ll lunge or feint. Their grip tightens – tells you if they’re desperate enough to commit.’

Jord nodded, resetting his stance. The sabre felt heavier now, its hilt slick with dawn’s condensation. Mist curled across the training field like spectral fingers, the rising sun a jaundiced eye peering through skeletal trees.

Lapo struck first, blade hissing. Jord parried, his footing steadier than the week prior, knees bent in the *ready position* Lapo had drilled into him. Progress, however slight. But when the older man feinted left, Jord overcommitted, ribs exposed. The practice blade cracked against his side, pain radiating like a struck bell.

‘*Focus*, Whittaker.’ Lapo circled, boots crushing frosted blades of grass. Dawn’s pallid light etched his silhouette in jagged relief, the air thick with the tang of exertion. ‘This isn’t a duel. It’s *butchery*. You conquer by any means – exhaust his body, fracture his mind.’

Jord adjusted his grip, sabre trembling. His breath fogged the air in ragged bursts.

‘Make him question every instinct,’ Lapo continued, blade flicking out to tap Jord’s unprotected flank. ‘Taunt his resolve. Sacrifice flesh if you must.’ Steel kissed Jord’s wrist – a sting, not a cut. ‘But *never* presume you’ve won.’

The older man’s footwork was liquid, predatory. Jord tried to mirror him, but clumsy steps didn’t help.

‘Overconfidence is a *rot*,’ Lapo hissed, feinting high before sweeping low. Jord barely blocked, the impact jarring his arm. ‘It hollows you out. Makes you *soft*.’

A pause. Lapo’s gaze sharpened, boring into Jord as if peeling back layers of sinew and bone. ‘You think this nebulous? Abstract?’

Jord said nothing. But his throat burned with caged remarks.

‘Good.’ Lapo’s blade arced suddenly, a silver blur. Jord parried, but the older man’s free hand shot out, seizing his collar. ‘*Adapt*.’

They stood frozen, noses inches apart. Lapo’s breath smelled of bitter coffee and something darker. ‘You’ll understand,’ he murmured, ‘when your first kill stares back at you. When you see the *emptiness* behind their eyes.’

He released Jord with a shove. ‘Again.’

The clang of steel resumed, each strike reverberating like a tolling bell. Jord’s muscles screamed, but his footwork tightened, his blocks grew sharper. Lapo’s shadow stretched impossibly long across the field, its edges fraying into tendrils that seemed to claw at the dirt.

*Just the light*, Jord told himself.

Jord lunged, sabre carving a silver arc. Lapo sidestepped effortlessly, his shadow stretching across the frost-glazed grass – too long, too *angular*, as if dawn’s light bent unnaturally around him.

‘Better,’ Lapo conceded, deflecting Jord’s next strike. ‘But your periphery’s still blind.’

A twitch of his wrist, and Jord’s blade veered wide. Lapo’s foot hooked behind Jord’s ankle – a move borrowed from back-alley brawlers, not military doctrine. Jord hit the ground hard, breath knocked loose. Above him, the sky swam, stars still visible at the edges of daylight, their light pinpricking his vision.

‘And that’s how you end up carrion.’ Lapo loomed, silhouetted against the swollen sun. ‘Presume every shadow hides a knife. Every bystander, a vulture.’

Jord groaned, accepting the offered hand. Lapo’s grip was iron, pulling him upright with a grunt. ‘Need to put on weight, boy. A stiff breeze would fold you.’

The jab stung less than the truth beneath it. Jord’s uniform hung loose, collarbones sharp as sabre hilts. Weeks of sleepless nights and tireless shifts as a dock-hand had whittled him to bone and resolve.

‘Again,’ he rasped, raising his blade.

Lapo’s smirk was a blade of its own. ‘Eager to taste dirt twice before breakfast?’

The clang of steel resumed, echoing across the field. Jord’s muscles burned, but his strikes grew tighter, instincts sharpening. Yet with every parry, the horizon seemed to *pulse* – a subsonic hum vibrating in his molars. The stars watched, patient and pitiless, as if applauding the futility.

Not long after, Jord all but begged for respite. He hadn’t realised how much fighting would take from him – how every strike, every parry, every desperate attempt to keep pace would drain him so utterly. His upper body burned, a lattice of stinging welts where Lapo’s sabre had kissed flesh. The bursts of exertion had stolen his breath, the weight of fatigue settling deep into his limbs. His arms, once eager to lift, to block, to fight, now hung heavy at his sides, strength and vigour having long since abandoned him.

Lapo studied him with a measured gaze, twirling his sabre idly. ‘I was wondering how long you’d last,’ he mused, voice tinged with something just shy of disappointment. ‘Seems… *average*.’ A pause. Then, with an exhale, he relented. ‘But time will fix that. We’ll carve something useful out of you yet. And meat –’ he gestured vaguely at Jord’s frame, ‘– we need to put some *hard* meat on those bones.’

Jord barely had the energy to scoff.

Lapo sheathed his sabre with a practised motion. ‘Enough for now. No use training a corpse. Let’s eat – fuel up.’ A semblance of a smirk graced his lips. ‘Might even start seeing improvement, eh?’

Jord didn’t argue. At this point, he wasn’t sure he had the strength.

The canteen stood nearly empty, its fluorescent lights buzzing like trapped flies. Only Hesk stood behind the counter, ladle in hand, eyeing Jord with a mix of pity and amusement.

Lapo had already claimed a corner table, shovelling vegetables into his mouth with mechanical efficiency. Jord approached the serving line, his tray gripped for he feared that he would go lax and drop it.

‘So you’ve paired with the daredevil,’ Hesk muttered, slopping an extra ladle of gravy onto Jord’s plate.

‘Daredevil?’ Jord croaked.

‘Polazit.’ Hesk wiped his hands on a rag that had seen better decades. ‘Man’s got a reputation. Trains rookies like he’s sculpting cannon fodder.’ He leaned closer, apron reeking of burnt fat. ‘Thinks paperwork’s beneath him. Uses you lot as an excuse to swing things all day.’

Jord stared at the gravy pooling around his mash.

‘Eat,’ Hesk ordered. ‘You’ll need the ballast. Seen his type before – worship the grind till it grinds *you*.’ A potato landed on Jord’s tray with a wet *splat*. ‘Fail to keep up?’ He mimed tossing scraps to the floor. ‘Rag-dolled. Happened to a lad last winter. Never seen a man being so happy for doing latrine duty, truly.’

Jord’s fork hovered. ‘Why is he still training recruits, then?’

Hesk barked a laugh. ‘Cause the brass love results. And Polazit? He’s a bloody *artisan* of results.’ The cook’s gaze flicked to Lapo, now methodically dissecting a sausage. ‘Heard you survived your first op. Congrats. Most puke their guts up after.’

‘Thanks… *Hank*.’

‘*Hesk*.’ The cook scowled. ‘Get my name wrong again, I’ll serve you tripe tomorrow.’

Jord retreated to Lapo’s table, trying to balance two trays one his and the other burdened with Hesk’s so-called *sympathy portion* – a mountain of buttery mash flanked by charred sausages. The officer barely looked up.

‘Know him?’

‘Somewhat.’

And that was that.

The mash tasted of salt and little else. Jord chewed mechanically, Hesk’s warnings slithering through his thoughts like oil on water. Across the canteen, the cook lingered, arms folded, watching.

*Concerned for me? Or concerned he’s just poisoned me?* Jord wasn’t sure which was more likely. With a mental shrug, he shovelled another bite into his mouth and decided not to think too hard about it.

For some reason, after eating, Lapo dragged Jord out for a walk. *To digest,* he claimed. The compound was a hive of movement – clerks rushing between offices, officers barking orders at trainees, visitors weaving through the crowd, and even dogs. *Big* dogs, all oddly friendly, their massive heads nudging at outstretched hands. Jord hadn't expected that.

And on and on they walked.

It gave Jord time to think, to take stock of everything. He had joined the Guard expecting to kick down doors – now he was mobilised for war. What a time to be alive. His grandfather had often said, *“We live in interesting times,”* a phrase that, as a boy, Jord had never understood.

*“And why is that a bad thing?”* he had asked once, confused. *“Interesting times are fun! They’re, well, interesting!”*

His grandfather had only lifted a bushy eyebrow in pity – his one eyebrow, for it was so thick it refused to be divided – before dissolving into laughter.

Now, step by step, Lapo at his side, Jord finally understood.

‘Good times?’ Lapo asked, catching the faint smile on Jord’s lips.

‘Good times.’ Jord nodded. ‘My old grandpa, bless his soul, always talked about those “interesting times.” I used to mock him for it, you see. Ah, how the turntables.’

‘A man of wisdom.’

‘Wisdom indeed. He was fond of scolding through lectures – torture, if you asked my cousin Karla. The old man *loved* teaching, had a knack for it. But life had its way with him, and his dreams were carried off with the wind.’

Lapo took a moment to respond, their pace unbroken. ‘Happens. Life’s like that. One moment, you’re set on climbing the ladder – then a gust of wind knocks you off, and suddenly you see it for what it is.’ His voice was quiet, thoughtful. ‘Just a ladder. Just something to distract yourself with. A way to sleepwalk through life. But when you hit the ground? When everything crumbles? You see things as they *are*. The breeze. The grass. The feel of the earth beneath your feet. That’s existence.’

Jord tilted his head. ‘Didn’t take you for a reflective type, sir.’

Lapo chuckled. ‘It’s hard to live so long without picking up a few insights. Harder still to avoid thinking about them when you’re surrounded by peril.’ His gaze flicked skyward. ‘I’ve seen many things, Jord. But one of the most striking is a man final walk – when he *knows* the end is near. You can *see* it in him. That shift. That sudden love for *everything* – every blade of grass, every breath of wind, every living thing. It’s… liberating, in a way. Doom, I’ve found, sets the mind free.’

‘Free?’ Jord echoed.

Lapo’s smile was unreadable. ‘What’s there to worry about when there’s no tomorrow? No obligations. No expectations. Just you, alone in the world. A leaf in the wind – shackles rusted to dust.’

They basked in the light, bathed in the hum of the world around them, and shared a quiet, unspoken contentment.

An hour passed before Lapo broke the stillness. ‘Time to train you in the use of rifles. Are you up the task?’

Jord nodded.

The shooting range greeted them with the sharp tang of gunpowder and the staccato rhythm of gunfire. Paper silhouettes swayed slightly in the artificial breeze, waiting to be marked, judged, or spared by a shooter’s hand. Lapo strode ahead with the ease of someone who had long since made peace with the weight of a rifle. Jord followed, his own weapon feeling heavier than it should have.

‘First lesson: a rifle is not a magic wand. You don’t just point and expect results.’ He patted the LR-11’s stock. ‘It’s a tool, and like any tool, it obeys its user *only* if the user knows what they’re doing.’

Jord nodded, fingers brushing the cool metal of the weapon. Lapo studied him for a moment before continuing.

‘Start with stance. Feet shoulder-width apart. Rifle tucked into your shoulder, not resting against it – you want control, not discomfort.’ He demonstrated, moving with the precision of long practice. ‘Good footing absorbs recoil. Bad footing gets you knocked flat on your arse.’

Jord copied the stance, adjusting under Lapo’s scrutinizing gaze. The older man nudged his elbow up, corrected the angle.

‘Good. Now, breath control. Steady in, steady out. The moment you fire should feel like a continuation of your breath, not an interruption.’

Jord inhaled deeply, the stock pressed firm against his shoulder.

‘Trigger discipline. Finger rests *outside* the guard until you’re ready to fire. No twitchy nerves, no impatient squeezing. The best shooters don’t pull the trigger – they let the shot *break.*’

Jord swallowed, index finger following along the trigger’s curve.

Lapo stepped back. ‘Now, aim. Your eyes, the sights, the target – they must align. Focus not on the rifle, not on the target as a whole, but on the *point* you wish to hit.’

Jord lined up the sights, breath slow, posture locked. His heartbeat thudded behind his ribs.

‘Fire when ready.’

He squeezed. The rifle cracked, a violent kick into his shoulder. The bullet tore into the target, but it veered left – far from centre mass.

Lapo sighed, but there was no real disappointment in it. ‘You fought the rifle. It doesn’t need to be manhandled, Whittaker. Again.’

Jord readjusted, jaw tightening. The second shot was better, still off-centre but closer.

‘Better,’ Lapo admitted. ‘But you need consistency.’

And so it went – shot after shot, correction after correction. Lapo drilled him on everything: trigger pull, follow-through, target reacquisition. When Jord started tightening his groupings at twenty meters, Lapo upped the challenge – faster shooting, further targets. He introduced magazine changes, forcing Jord to reload under time pressure. He tested him on movement, making him fire from different positions – standing, kneeling, prone.

Hours passed. His arms ached. His fingers grew numb. The LR-11 was no longer just a rifle; it was an extension of himself, a conversation between muscle and metal.

Jord exhaled, steadying his aim one last time. The rifle barked, the bullet striking true – dead centre.

Lapo let out a quiet huff of approval. ‘You’re learning, Whittaker.’ He slung his own rifle over his shoulder. ‘Now we see if you can *keep* learning. Tomorrow, we do this again. And the next day. And the next. Until it’s instinct.’

Jord nodded and took a step through the range door, riffle in hand – and shivered.

The world stilled. For the world had been eaten.

1jl0rs6,https://i.redd.it/pln4p71sl7re1.jpeg,Kouhai Review: Eyjafjalla,"Morning sunlight gently filters through the windows, the clear blue sky stretches endlessly above, and dust clouds roll by as the Rhodes Island landship trudges through unclaimed plains. Some operators spend this time locked in the gym while others catch up on sleep, but the mess deck remains as busy as ever. Here the air is filled with clinking utensils and plates, overlapping voices, and music from the kitchen. Tucked away in a quiet corner sit two distinct figures: one small Caprinae cloaked in white, and the unmistakable black-clad Doctor. The Caprinae, Eyjafjalla, speaks animatedly, gesturing around the table while the Doctor simply listens and sips their coffee.

“The soil samples from Higashi reveal different Originium Activity Levels compared to ones from Mount Unna. In fact, because there are so many different types of volcanoes across Higashi, there are large variations even among samples from the same region…”

The Doctor takes another sip of coffee and swirls the dregs around. It’s a shame that black coffee is so bitter. Some cream and sugar would be nice if not for the inevitable nagging from Kal’tsit.

“...so due to the tectonic plates, some parts of Higashi and Yan actually have submarine volcanoes.” Eyjafjalla takes a deep breath, smiling.

“It’s great that your research advanced a lot, but did you actually get to do any touristy stuff? Enjoy the culture?”

“Yes! The food was amazing, and the architecture is so different from Leithanien. I stood out a little as a foreigner, but everyone was so nice and helpful. I even tried on some traditional Higashi dresses-”

Her partner suddenly leans forward. “Really? Did you take any pictures?”

Eyjafjalla leans back slightly and gives a shy smile. “No… It was a little embarrassing, so I didn’t.”

The Doctor dramatically slumps down in their seat and looks up at the ceiling. “Ah… I can’t believe you would do this to me, Adele.”

“Professor, you’ll be fine. Maybe we can go together one day.”

The Doctor sits back up with a chuckle. “Only if Kal’tsit approves my leave requests. Anyway, it sounds like things are going well with you and Professor Keller. When can I peer review your next article?”

Eyjafjalla sighs and drums her fingers against the table. “Hmmm... It’s not going to be for a few more months. I still have to compile all the data, type the report, have it edited…”

“I keep telling you, you should just become a medical doctor instead. You’re already halfway there.”

“You already know my answer to that, Professor.”

“Mhm.”

The two sit in silence for a bit and watch their surroundings. Over by the serving line, Lumen looks like he finally woke up and decided to get something to eat. At a nearby table, Marcille is completely absorbed in the book in front of her. At least she’s just reading; we wouldn’t want a repeat of the “Marcille’s drafts incident”. 

The Doctor sighs and gets up from their chair, moves behind Eyjafjalla, and ruffles her head.

“I’d better get going since I’m sure Cellinia’s already piling my desk with papers. But let’s meet up again later. You’ve been working really hard and deserve some rest, don’t you think?”

Eyjafjalla tilts her head back and looks up at the Doctor. “No, I’m okay. Getting to visit Higashi was already like a vaca-”

“No, no. That won’t do.” The Doctor traces their hand laterally and runs it gently along the length of her horn. “I’ve already made plans to give you a little spa day. I’ll break open one of Beeswax’s horn care kits, you’ll lay down and close your eyes, and I’ll pamper you for a bit. Sound like a plan?” 

Eyjafjalla smiles. “...Okay, Professor. That sounds great.”

“Alright, I’ll give you a call when I’m done with work.” After walking away, the Doctor makes it halfway across the room before they suddenly stop, turn around, and walk back over. Eyjafjalla watches, confused, as they lean down and speak softly enough so that only she can hear.

“I almost forgot. I’ve been meaning to say this for a while, but I’m very proud of you, Adele. And maybe it’s not my place to say this, but I’m sure your parents are as well.”

Without waiting for a response, the Doctor ruffles her head again and leaves. Eyjafjalla watches as they reach the exit, look behind them, and start gesturing. Although Oripathy has worsened her vision, she can still interpret the obvious sign language.

I
Love
You
Adele

Here’s another Bitcoin order book update with your morning coffee.

So, what do we see at the moment?

Total visible sell-side liquidity: ~1,608 BTC

Yesterday, sellers tested the buyers around the $86,000 zone, but they couldn’t break through. The price quickly bounced from that area because it holds the largest concentration of buy-side limit orders.

Most likely, today we’ll head up to test the seller’s strength around $88,000–$88,800. There aren’t many large sell walls visible there, but every time the price reaches that resistance zone, bots start selling actively.

Currently, there are over 3,000 BTC in buy limit orders combined at the $85,600–$86,100 levels.
Buyers are aggressively defending the downside and clearly signaling that they don’t want the price to go lower.

Looking at liquidity above — in order to collect major liquidity, we still need to move up to the $90,000–$92,000 zone. And as always, price tends to follow liquidity.

My view for today:

Yesterday, the buyer was tested — and showed strength.( at 86k zone )
Today, I believe we’re going to test the seller.(88k-88.8k with bounce to 90-92k)
