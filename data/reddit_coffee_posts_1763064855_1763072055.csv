At some point this week I pointed out that I’m on my period, so he definitely knows it. I’m thinking that going over to his house will not escalate past another heated make out session bc of my period (also don’t want anything else yet).

After that, in terms of customizations, would this taste good: 2 pumps of mocha sauce, 1 pump of vanilla syrup, whipped cream, mocha drizzle? I also don't want it to be overly sweet.

1owei7z,https://i.redd.it/aw9drmxmk31g1.jpeg,Review 19: Weller 12 Year,"Color: AmberPaid: $80
Proof: 90Nose: This smells older, oak and tobacco followed by burnt brown sugar.  There’s a muskiness to this Whiskey.  I get chocolate and some citrus on the second sniff.  
palate:  There’s a lot going on here, but not all of it is great. There’s some strong sugary notes, Carmels and butterscotch, but there’s also charred oak, and some bitterness going on in here.  It’s almost like coffee that has sat on the burner too long at work in some ways.  The tobacco is strong on the second sip, like “damn I feel like I just drank a cigar and coughed like a noob smoking for the first time.”  The palate is getting overwhelmed by the bitter notes, there’s sweetness here, a lot of Carmel and brown sugar but they are getting drowned out by the oak.  It’s not a balanced flavor profile.
Feel:  For a 12 year dram, the feel is a bit underwhelming.  It’s good, it’s oily, but you can definitely tell it was cut down a bit to get it back to 90 proof.  Finish: It’s very oaky and smokey on the finish, and not in a pleasant way.  It kinda lingers and finally melts into some dark chocolate and Carmel notes and then it’s gone quick.Overall:  I honestly think this has been my least favorite of the Weller’s that I’ve tried so far.  The regular, 107 and Full Proof are all better than this.  If this is Pappy’s that didn’t make the cut… I can see why.  It’s okay at best, and honestly not something I’m going to reach for often.

I have moved to Edinburgh with my family from Greece 12 years ago and love the people and the city.

I am sharing a photo from a coffee shop, quite central. I will not share the name since it’s not about the place, which is great, very friendly owners and staff, very tasty food, but because coffee has become so much more expensive.

I thought it was the price of coffee, but apparently it isn’t:

- £2 for a double espresso
- extra £0.10 for either some hot water OR an extra espresso shot
- extra £1.50 for a Flat White OR a Latte (disproportionate milk usage)

Today I received an email saying before any of that they're now going to schedule an informal coffee chat meeting with a Senior Mgr, giving me a chance to find out more about the role etc.

I'm pretty confused by what this is about. Have they developed a concern after the recruiter passed my resume on to the team? Or could it be that they're assessing whether I might actually be suitable to hire straight into a Manager role? I applied for Senior Consultant because from what I know they won't hire straight into Manager without consulting experience, even though my past experience is at a Manager level and above in a very big corporate. The recruiter confirmed this is true. They do have a Manager role advertised in the same practice.

I make my living flipping, bringing stuff in from China, dealing with factories, logistics, the whole circus. I sit down and actually do the math: cost of goods, shipping, customs, warehousing, platform fees, packing, returns  you know, normal business math. And then I open the listings and sometimes I just have no idea what other people are thinking.

I set a realistic price so that after all the expenses there’s at least *something* left. And right next to me there’s the exact same item, priced basically at my cost, with “free shipping,” a ton of photos, a proper description, and the seller answering messages. So this person went through the whole process from sourcing to shipping, spent time, money, and nerves and best case they’re making coffee money. Worst case, they’re basically paying to ship the item out.

And it’s not just the occasional “I’m dumping leftovers” listing. There are entire stores where half the inventory is built like this. You sit there thinking: do you guys even factor in your time, your risk, your cash sitting in stock, or is the only thing that matters that the “orders” counter goes up and everything else is irrelevant? The buyer obviously doesn’t care, they just see the lowest price, and all the backstage stuff is invisible.

I’m not against competition, that’s normal. What bugs me is how to adjust your strategy when this is your main job, not a side hobby. Do you set your prices where they *should* be and accept that some items will sit longer? Do you cut margins and tell yourself “well, at least there’s some turnover”? Do you move into narrower niches where fewer people are willing to work for nothing?

Sometimes I catch myself thinking maybe I’m just turning into a grumpy old man and it’s always been like this, but it really feels like there are more and more people who don’t count their time and costs...

How do you deal with competitors who are basically working for $3 – 5 profit per item do you adjust your prices to theirs, or just do your own thing and wait for the market to filter them out?",4,1763070802.0,Flipping,4,0.83,False

I'm finally getting better and I wanted to share my experience with you, especially what worked for me.

I didn't get the initial ring, but I did get an unusual sore throat (on Monday).
On Thursday, three tiny spots appeared on my chest. At first, I thought they were fungal infections. It got worse until Sunday.

I saw a doctor the next day, and he made the diagnosis. He told me the rash phase was over. OH BOY, HOW WRONG YOU WERE.

It spread from my chin to my wrists, then to my knees.

For two weeks, it itched so badly I couldn't sleep. I scratched myself until I bled, and I cried.

Then, after a month in total, the spots flattened, merged into one huge red patch, peeled off, and were gone (this phase lasted 10 days). Today, my skin is just very dry, but there are no more marks or itching.

What worked: cold. Putting my moisturizer in the fridge, using ice cubes, wrapping myself in a cold, wet towel, and taking cold showers.

I used shea butter moisturizer, Cicalfate+ (Avène), and a neutral shower gel. I stopped drinking alcohol, coffee, and tea. I drank relaxing herbal teas and slept as much as possible. Reading comments from people who had gone through this also helped me, thank you Reddit.

What didn't work: gently scratching with an exfoliating glove. CeraVe cream and Head & Shoulders cream burned and stung my skin. Pat the skin instead of scratching.

She called this morning to apologize. Her words ""she used a spirited tone and is sorry about that"" but ""she won't apologize for her opinions"" I flat out told her I dont want an apology for her opinions but yelling at me in public?

Even as a total beginner, I can rationalize that cost in my head, but I also want to consider a non-crazy approach. So here I am, back with a revised budget of $1500 max. If it's possible to get under $1000, that would be great too.

My wife and I are mostly milk-based coffee drinkers, so more often than not we will be making lattes. That being said, I have gotten nerdy and adventurous with pour-over coffee in the past, and have a strong feeling that I will probably do the same with espresso. My wife probably will always be a latte person, but I have the potential to do more than that, so I'm looking for a setup that can fit both of our needs.

I also would like to do pour-over coffee again, so having a versatile grinder would be great. I know that's probably not likely, so if the grinder were to favor one side, I would prefer it be better at espresso.

Some options I am considering in this cost tier...

Grinders:

* Baratza Encore ESP ($200)
* Baratza Encore ESP Pro ($300)
* Eureka Mignon Specialita ($650)
* Eureka Mignon Notte ($300)
* Eureka Oro Mignon ($820)

1owe1bo,https://www.reddit.com/r/VictoriaBC/comments/1owe1bo/truth_about_the_gordon_head_dunstan_development/,Truth About the Gordon Head Dunstan Development,"


I’m writing because I keep seeing letters and comments deliberately misrepresenting what the local residents of Gordon Head are upset with in regards to the Meadows project by Aryze and Wexford at the St Dunstan church property.

Overwhelmingly local residents are in favour of more housing density here. There have been some other developments in the area that are fine. The current proposal by Aryze though has really stirred everyone up because it is so obviously bad and corporate profit driven.

First- these are not rentals for families, people getting into the housing market, or under market priced. The units are +90% tiny 1 bed, forever market rentals, owned by real estate investors and the development corporation. Residents want to see predominantly 2&3br units, with a mix of townhouses, and have a substantial amount below market and for sale so that families can stay in and move to GH. These type of units just bleed profits out of people into the investors pockets.

Second- the size. In an area where 3 stories looks gigantic and there is little to no large commercial buildings, adding two massive (for the area) six story units is not sympathetic to the local area. There are no sidewalks on most streets. One bus line. No EVO. No bike lanes. No space for street parking. No walkable amenities aside from a tiny coffee shop. There is no utilities for a project of this size. There are no plans for the developer to fix these issues, instead just pushing them off on local residents.

Third - Saanich’s master plan outlines projects like this to be limited to main transportation corridors, village areas, and transit hubs, this area is nowhere near any of these. We have to have some semblance of city planning and forethought into development to maximize the benefits of new projects to address and balance all issues we’re faced with currently.

Last- The church here has had their taxes written off here forever, and the developer is trying to get through a loophole avoiding tax on the sale. They won’t pay for any infrastructure work needed to accommodate a project this big. So, all of us are going to be subsidizing some rich developer and his investors money making endeavour. There are real accusations that this developer pays under the table cash and all around is a bit of a bridge burner community wise. Not someone with much benefit of the doubt.


In summary- GH locals are happy to see more density, but it should be appropriate for the area and it should be providing some sort of benefit more than only ‘more units’. This is such a great opportunity to have the district step in and develop a co-op like project, affordable for-sale family appropriate housing, or below-market family rentals. The project proposed by Aryze is designed to maximize profits with zero concern to any consequences or lost opportunity for real housing assistance.

We were in the same friend group and were very close for years before anything happened between us. In this time, he was dating someone else, but ended things with her because she was ""clingy"" and always anxious about where they stood (now I know why lol). When they broke up, he said he was excited to get back to his routine and not have to worry about working with her schedule.

We got together once they broke up (he came on to me), and everything was great at first. After a month of seeing each other, he said he was scared of letting me down, felt overwhelmed and paralyzed with his thoughts, and that he was sorry he couldn't give me what I (29F) needed. Mind you, all I was asking for was for him to make plans more than a day in advance. 

We talked it out and he told me he struggles with emotional intimacy (he is 34 and has never had a serious long term gf, bad relationship with family, extremely arrogant, etc.). He said he cares about me deeply and wanted to try to fix it, but nothing seemed to be changing and I ended things before they got worse (knowing that I can get attached easily). 

  
I called him a week or so after not seeing him (I was on vacation), and told him I missed him and he said he missed me too. But then I texted him and sort of asked why he was willing to mess up our friendship if he knew he did not have the capacity to be with me. He never responded. Now, I have to see him every single day as we are in the same friend group, and all work together at our local coffee shop in a small town.

  
I never confirmed if he was avoidant or not, but all the signs seem to point to yes. I have sympathy for him, but how am I supposed to work and respect someone who cannot give me closure? I don't have any interest in dating him further (hence me ending things), but I want to understand so I can forgive his behavior and move on while having to see him daily.

First off, I love this podcast and 99% of the commentary is funny, compelling, and valid. There’s just this reoccurring position on adultery, affairs, cheating, etc. that’s broadly sweeping and sometimes potentially harmful.

Some truths I think we all believe- the vast majority of cheaters on Reddit are fuck ups and/or selfish beyond belief. However, not every cheater is a narcissist devil. Cheating, *doing something without the consent of your SO and that they would not consent to*, is **ALWAYS** a sign of something is terribly wrong. But like most crimes against another person, there are shades of wrong doing.

I have been cheated on and have cheated. Either by the end you’re going to roast me or you’re going to understand me. Either way, get ready for a lot of drama.

Lets talk about being cheated on. Its happened 3 times that I know of. I got my taste of 3 very different types of cheating. Guy 1 did it because he thought he could get away with it. I’m not offended by the cheating, it didn’t feel like a personal attack and because that was barely the worst thing he did.

Guy 2 hurt more because it was personal. He was mad, his feelings were valid. He wanted me to commit and while I liked being around him, I didn’t like bringing him around. If I’m being critical of myself, when I hung out with him and his friends I felt important and unchallenged. Everywhere else, I had to work very hard. I’m sure he felt like I was “slumming it” with him, but that I was embarrassed by him. There’s some truth to that. While I was trying to decided if I wanted to do and make a commitment either way, he cheated on me with a younger family member. She was a dumbass, but also 19 when he was 27. That was personal. Her and I were able to reconcile, but he was dead to me. However, I also had to take accountability for who I chose to associate with, and be more decisive sooner.

GAL 3 (I do think it’s important to say gender) was the most complicated. I care very much for her. I was not ashamed of her. She was amazing, smart, witty, laughed at puns, and creative. My parents, however, where in denial about me being Bisexual. She wanted me to just tell the world to fuck off and have us be together. That’s a lot easier said than done. She gave up and wanted to be held, I understand that.

Being cheated on always hurts. It can be traumatic and you may be a victim of abuse. How you’re feeling about it is valid. It’s easy for us to make someone into a villain in our story, but we don’t grow from this. It’s often not black and white. Sometimes it’s a a shade of grey and maybe you can understand why is happened. When your able to, I think it’s important to see what you are accountable for, learn from it and forgive yourself. Some people are just the scum of the earth, but even they have a lesson to give you. Sometimes the lesson is just how to spot scum in the future.

Now here’s where I blow up any good will I may have gained. Let’s talk about my cheating.

**Content warning** \- I’m going to talk about abuse and SA.

I was married for 5 years. I cheated in the last few months of the marriage. It’s messy and long, but I’m going to try and be concise. I was brutally r—ed and have PTSD because of it. I grew up in the church. After my attack I got married to “protect” myself. I was taught that marriage was like a force field from abuse. I tried to be smart and married my best friend. He was super encouraging to get professional help. I did. I was a mess of a person and he was showing a lot of care. After a lot of therapy, I started to get better. I got the right medication, was going back to work, and starting up hobbies.  

This is when we started having problems.

He picked at everything I did and would hold onto all of it. There was always something wrong with me. I didn’t listen when I was supposed to, I didn’t speak up when I should’ve. Forgetting to empty my coffee mug before putting it in the sink. It was a personal attack against him. I was walking on egg shells around him. At any moment I could be screamed at. Affection was not offered, it was now earned. He complained about lack of sex, but when I was willing to be a cum bucket he hated that I didn’t seem enthusiastic. Friends took note and he picked fights with them. He made me feel awful for having a relationship with my sister because she shared different beliefs than him. He made me choose between him and our closest friends. One friend was even his best man. I chose him, but not *fast* enough. We went through 4 different couples therapists, he fired all of them when they eventually told him he had to learn how to forgive. I felt isolated.

Divorce is on my mind, but my parents remind me I made a covenant to God.

I question my sexuality, my identity, my beliefs. I’m come upon a very good bad idea on reddit. An open marriage. I think this is going to let him get off my back. He hates the idea, but agrees on the condition of 10K rules to follow. This is worst. I write my own rules. I don’t recommend any of this, btw.

I meet someone, it’s freeing. The irony, I never have sex with my affair partner. What I have with the affair partner is intimacy. We check in, talk, and listen. Emotional boxes are being checked. We only see each other in public places, but we hold hands, hug, kiss. This gives me the emotional space (and this is a cliche) and I’m able to be a better wife. At least, I like myself more.

This however, was **not** healthy for my husband. Jealousy takes over, every action is scrutinized. Jealousy and insecurity is understandable, he feels that I don’t *need* him to be happy. How it manifests is awful. He was verbally abusive since our second year of marriage, but towards the end of the 5th he becomes physically abusive. The turning point is when my dog gets between us and he lays hands on her, I go to sleep at my parents. I come back the next day and he threatened to unalive us. I leave and never look back.

It’s been four years since then. I’m divorced, an ex-Christian, and doing well. I’m not going to pretend I wasn’t at fault for anything. I got married when I shouldn’t have and was in an ugly place early in the marriage. And while I don’t recommend affairs or cheating, I don’t think I finally end the marriage without it. Divorce was taboo. Verbal abuse wasn’t real. Once a cheater always a cheater. These are very harmful ideas that I had to deconstruct. I’m in therapy still, but now it’s like maintenance on a car.

My finale thought is this— Reddit is a one sided story where binaries of asshole or not are given. Most people are not binaries. If there is cheating in a relationship, something is very wrong in it, but in my experience neither side is completely blameless. What can you do to hold yourself more accountable for your part? Forgive and love yourself.

My (34f) relationship with my covert nmom has slowly deteriorated over the last 2 years. After having my own child in 2020 I started to realise that our bond was not normal, and that I was her favourite child only because I was excellent at anticipating her needs, catering to her feelings, and delivering her supply. Of course when I consciously stopped doing all those things, our relationship went to shit, and I'm sure if you asked her my mom would say she has no idea why or what changed.

  
We had a (sort of?) confrontation in January where I expressed anger and disappointment at nmom's future-faking with my son. I've had to have conversations with him about how sometimes grandma promises things but they don't happen. She tried DARVO but I wasn't having it, so she just went absolutely silent. She's pretty much been giving me the silent treatment since then. For example, when I visited her a few weeks later, she ignored me and focused all attention on my partner and son. Suspiciously, she does a total reversal, becomes very friendly and wants to have coffee with me 1-2 weeks before she wants something from me - like just before school holidays (because she wants to see her grandson) or just before family events (because she wants me to come and play happy families for the photo).



I have maintained very low contact until now because I didn't want to cause any drama around my little sister's wedding. Well, the wedding was last weekend. I saw my mom twice, at the wedding and at a family gathering the day after. She didn't speak to me and ignored me, except for asking me one question at the wedding reception (I think so she can tell herself that ""she's not the one not speaking to the other""). I answered politely but that was it.

  
Tomorrow is my nmom's birthday. I had pretty much decided to not message or call, but the reality that we might never speak or have a conversation again after this is starting to sink in. I thought I had done all my grieving and worked through the regret and loss but now I'm feeling lots of painful feelings. I can't help thinking maybe if I'd worked harder, been more open, or been better at expressing my needs, it wouldn't have got to this point.

  
Sorry for the long post but I guess I'm wondering what other people's feelings and experiences were like when they went no contact. Did anyone else basically get discarded? Somehow I'm not expecting a huge campaign to hoover me back 😔 ",2,1763070065.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

What's driving me absolutely mental is figuring out what to do with my stuff.

I've lived in the same flat in Manchester for 7 years. You know how it goes - you accumulate *so much crap* without realizing it. Now I'm sitting here staring at a bookshelf, a perfectly good desk, kitchen stuff, winter clothes I definitely won't need in Dubai... and I'm paralyzed.

So...

Do I sell everything and start fresh? (Seems wasteful and expensive to replace)

Ship the essentials? (But what even counts as ""essential""?)

Put it all in storage and decide later? (Just delaying the inevitable?)

I've been going through this mental gymnastics for weeks. My mate who moved to Singapore last year told me he regrets not bringing more of his stuff because replacing everything decent quality was way more expensive than he thought. But another friend who went to Australia says she wishes she'd just sold it all and traveled lighter.

The whole shipping situation is confusing too. I got quotes ranging from £800 to £3,500 for roughly the same amount of stuff. Some companies want to do a home survey (seems excessive?), others just give you a price per cubic meter.

Part of me wonders if I'm overthinking this. Like, it's just *stuff*, right? But it's also my stuff. The perfume collection, my PC, electronics, books I've had since uni, my coffee machine that makes the perfect espresso...

For those who've done international moves - what did you wish you'd brought? What did you regret shipping?

Genuinely curious because I need to make some decisions this week and I'm second-guessing everything.

Those two days I drank a lot of lemonade and I thought that could have been the issue. Pain persisted and I knew about H Pylori from some family members so I booked an appointment with my family doctor and I was tested for H Pylori via breath test. The test came back positive and my primary doctor prescribed me the triple therapy (lansoprazol 30 mg, Clarithromycin 500 mg, and amoxicillin 1000 mg) twice a day. I started the medication on June 9th, 2025. During treatment, I was able to meet a GI doctor where he told me to retest after 8 weeks after finishing the treatment.

During the treatment, I did not have any major side effects. However, my appetite was shit. I barely was eating anything. I went from 240 pounds to 200 pounds during/post treatment. My symptoms got better after the triple therapy and I started eating whatever I wanted after it. 4 weeks later, I started having some weird stomach noises during the day and every time I eat. I did not have any pain, just that stomach noise. My appetite also got bad. I retested on August 20 2025 and the test came back positive (Breath test).

Then my GI doctor prescribed to me the Quad therapy (tetracycline 500 mg x 4 times/day, metronidazole 250 mg x 4 times/day, pantoprazol 40 mg x 2 times/day, and bismuth 262 mg x 4 times/day). I started the quad therapy on August 25th 2025. During the treatment, appetite was still not the greatest. I did not have any major side effects until the last day where I started having some abdominal pain. After I finished the treatment, my doctor told me to take probiotics. I took probiotics (Florastor) 2 pills per day for 4 weeks. I still remember some time after the treatment, I started having that stomach noise when I eat but it disappeared after a week or so. I retested on November 8th 2025 and FINALLY THE TEST CAME BACK NEGATIVE!

I still have some stomach noises and some pain every now and then especially when I don’t eat most of the day and then eat a huge meal. Certain things that I stopped drinking was black coffee since the symptoms started until recently. ",1,1763069944.0,HPylori,0,1.0,False

The Dauntless

  


  


“What were you thinking?! You DO NOT force issues like that in public or to superior officers and do not dare to look away Herbert, you were either in on this mess or giving tacit approval by not stopping your clone.” Admiral Cistern has Captain Rangi, Observer Wu, Harold and Herbert in his office as he dresses down the man.

  


“Permission to speak sir?” Harold asks.

  


“Denied! And denied for a reason, because I want to make a point. You are a clone. You are a security breach and you are a problem. You are a problem up and down and have been shown incredible leniency and patience. By the law I could have had you destroyed the first day of your life and no one would have had legal gainsay against me. When you married yourself to the descendant of a Primal I could have pushed for you to be discharged from The Undaunted and did not! When your response to stealthed enemy movement was to invite them onto the ship you are under orders to guard there was the potential for a court marshaling, let alone when you allowed yourself to be openly seduced by one of their operatives and take her for another wife as well!”

  


He takes a sip of his coffee to wet his throat.

  


“I will simply skip the affairs you performed on Skathac and Zalwore and get to my single question. Why should I not have you punished for this?”

  


“Permission to speak sir?” Harold asks and Admiral Cistern nods. “I have performed these actions because I am following my orders to the letter.”

  


“Elaborate.” Admiral Cistern states as Observer Wu’s eyebrows go up in shock.

  


“I cannot properly defend The Inevitable from infiltration and novel techniques as are my standing orders. Centris redefines the term hostile terrain when it comes to information and infiltration warfare. The moment we entered the system I was repelling hundreds of attacks that grew more frequent, more audacious and more competent the closer we approached the world itself. My team and I are already undergoing triage and prioritization for repelling the sheer volume of attempts upon the ship. With my recent move I have effectively turned an entire galaxy spanning religion into our unwitting allies in securing and maintaining The Inevitable.”

  


“How bad is it?” Admiral Cistern asks grimly.

  


“It’s The Hack, but we were ready for it. Mostly. But they’ve kept trying and are still trying even now. I’ve gone out of my way to decouple and close the systems of many of our computers. Encouraged the use of paper and the like. But there’s at six to seven types of teleportation being used to get transmitters aimed at our computer databases as we speak from all aspects over Centris. And to make matters worse, most of this nonsense is coming from civilian and non-aligned hackers. There are very few attacks that we trace back to actual organizations and even though they’re one in tens of thousands.”

  


“Thirteen thousand, eight hundred and fourteen to one on average.” Herbert supplies.

  


“It was higher when we were passing the rings. Roughly twenty thousand to one.” Harold notes.

  


“The numbers are already going down. Just the idea that a Primal might one day be on The Inevitable is discouraging a lot of people from forcing their noses in there.” Herbert says. “It seems that organizations are still bolder, but a lot of individuals are ducking out as news spreads. It’s still dropping. We’re in the twelve thousands.”

  


“And what happens when we have to leave?” Captain Rangi asks.

  


“First off, do not give an explicit answer. Ever. Keep people wondering, keep The Primal Faith as a shield. Furthermore, I can all but guarantee the two closes Primals will not want to go. So if we can get an official refusal from one, the other or both, then we can use that to cover things up politically on our end. But on your end Captain, just don’t give any definitive answer as to if you are or are not bringing a Primal to Earth. And like that, you will have a volunteer army helping keep The Inevitable secure with nothing more needed on your end.”

  


“Observer Wu? Captain Rangi? Do you accept Operative Jameson and Jameson’s explanation?”

  


“I want to see the data.” Observer Wu states and Herbert walks up with a data-slate held high.

  


“That’s the up to date information on the hacking attempts on The Inevitable. Left side of the screen has an overall summation updated by algorithm.” Herbert explains.

  


“This is going by too fast to read…”  
  


“You can pull Axiom into your brain to increase comprehension speed. You don’t need much to keep up with the data.”

  


“… That’s why the hacking attempts are so unstoppable. They adapt too fast.” Captain Rangi realizes.

  


“In general, they move about ten times faster than a human hacker.” Herbert says and Observer Wu passes the Slate to Captain Rangi who reads through the summation as well and sighs.

  


“Are things to your satisfaction gentlemen?” Admiral Cistern asks.

  


“Yes.” Captain Rangi says.

  


“For now.” Observer Wu agrees.

  


“Good, now please leave. I would like to speak to my men in private.” Admiral Cistern says and Captain Rangi hands Herbert his data-slate back before both of them depart the office. Admiral Cistern waits for the door to close and sighs. “How much worse is it?”

  


“Sir they were ready for this. The fact that The Inevitable HAD to come back here and had already been here for a time made sure that they got past us fairly thoroughly.” Harold says.

  


“The Tracer Viruses we’ve been putting into The Inevitable has hit beyond the overload capacity in the first few minutes. They’ve already been spread and copied to every single known network on Centris and has exposed a few hundred times the amount of unknown networks than we previously were aware of.” Herbert adds.

  


“Ballpark it for me.”

  


“It’s like thinking you have one or two bugs in your apartment, then you open a wall to fix a pipe and are drowned in cockroaches. Like... cartoon levels, physically cannot fit in the house levels and...” Herbert continues and Admiral Cistern holds up a hand.

  


“Is there an upside?”

  


“If we want to we can now engage in legal warfare on a heretofore unprecedented level. We have the option to sue half the planet, if not more.” Herbert says.

  


“We also have the option to turn the tracer viruses into more traditional ones. A single activation signal and we can potentially bring down the Centris information network.” Harold offers.

  


“Yes, because that won’t instigate outright war like firebombing a firework warehouse.” Admiral Cistern asks. “Those are our nuclear options. I want something less than mutually assured destruction. What do we have with more finesse?”

  


“We’ve already started cataloguing the previously unknown networks for later investigation and infiltration.” Herbert offers.

  


“We also have the option of going public with this. Claim that the virus was in our systems as a mistake as we were studying information warfare and they had accidentally grabbed a potentially database destroying bug when they started ripping out data.”

  


“You’re thinking about offering antiviral services?” Herbert asks Harold.

  


“Yeah, good for the reputation, good for making money and acts like a deterrent for future hacking attempts. If people know that you’ve left traps around they’re more reluctant to barge in.” Harold confirms.

  


“I like these options gentlemen. And from the sounds of it we can do one and then the other. Anything else?”

  


“The virus we had in the system is a very small thing that hides in the systems, it registers as basic foundational data and only takes a few bytes of data to run. Our plans refer around tracking it, updating it into something hostile or deleting it. We can also turn it into spyware. But that’s another option with potential blowback, and one that puts egg on our face so I only mention it for completion’s sake.”

  


“We can also go crazy.” Herbert offers. “Turn the viruses into some kind of crazy challenge, host a tournament. What we have sir is an in to innumerable systems and people. For most of them it will only work once. But we have at least one. This is a problem, the endless cavalier data breaches are annoying on a good day and the kind of thing that drives a lot of governments to only have singular, small embassies with limited power on Centris. But we have the keys to the backdoor for just about... everywhere now. We can use this for a reprisal that might change the attitude and culture on this world. But more likely will just confuse the hell out of people and frustrate them before they go back to the way they were before.”

  


“So we have our nuclear options, our restrained options and a potential crazy option. I’m afraid that when it comes to nonsense of this scale sir, we don’t have much choice beyond go big or go home.” Harold says with a shrug.

  


“Hmm... Put down all the networks into a catalogue, off standard grid, make sure people don’t know we have it. Have an incomplete list one twentieth the size of the actual list in an area that can be hacked. Use that list to extend offers of debugging and antiviral work with an ‘apology’. Make sure they know you think they’re dumb. While this happens investigate into the networks that do not come forward or try to make a legal purchase of the antiviral services.”

  


“So our targets are funds, reputation and information?” Harold asks.

  


“For now, but keep close track of still active tracer viruses. If any of them go off unexpectedly...”

  


“We’ll have some eyes on them sir.” Herbert says.

  


“Good men. Now, both of you have your orders. Dismissed.” Admiral Cistern says and both of them nod. “Oh and Harold?”

  


“Yes sir?”

  


“Do you feel better? More as yourself compared to your last stay on Centris?” Admiral Cistern asks.

  


“Yes sir. Very much so.” Harold says with a smile as Herbert beams.

  


“I’m glad to hear it. Now if you’ll excuse me I need to give a last rubber stamp of approval to a few things. Things that have come up since it was confirmed we have two Primal Saints on the payroll.”

  


“Technically Banshee’s on MY payroll.” Harold says.

  


“And I fund you to hire her. So she’s on mine. As are you.” Admiral Cistern reminds him.

  


“Fair.”

  


“Now, out. I need to send the form letter for ‘No I will not send soldiers to satisfy your personal whims.’, the Saint Redblade and Saint Bluelaser edition. Also FYI your new title is canonized as one word now.”

  


“Really?” Harold asks.

  


“Yep.” Admiral Cistern notes in mild amusement. “Now seriously, I need my office.”

  


“Want me to send someone with some coffee?” Herbert asks.

  


“No, thank you. I’m already wired and need to stay within acceptable levels.” Admiral Cistern states. “But if you could send some ice water I would appreciate it.”

  


“Of course. Lemon or cucumber in it?” Herbert asks.

  


“Surprise me.”

  


“Orange then.” Harold says.

  


“Orange? Are you... if you want to be bold go with lime!” Herbert protests as they walk out of his office and Admiral Cistern chuckles a bit. The ‘argument’ a huge distraction up and down and confusing anyone that would be spying on them.

  


A wall panel pops off and a Private Stream hustles through the room and deposits a pitcher of ice water with sliced limes floating in it. Admiral Cistern nods in appreciation and the tiny figure rushes off... and he then rolls his eyes. You need to roll with the chaos if you want to keep your sanity.

  


No sooner does the door close behind them then Herbert receives an update. Which means that Harold, receives an update that Herbert received an update. Causing Herbert to give Harold an unimpressed look for a moment before turning to his own notification.

  


“Forces already building around The Inevitable to keep the Cloaken Rush away. Fun.” Harold notes.

  


“Again, it’s not impressive for you to hack my communicators where you already know the passwords.”

  


“I do it for the fun. Not to mention it confuses people watching us.”

  


“Yep. And we’re in the wonderful situation where them knowing that we know sends them down a hilarious spiral of suspicion that even knowing about that trap just sends them right down the rabbit hole.”

  


“Yes indeed big brother. Yes indeed.”

  


“Harold, I’m barely up to chest height on you. It feels weird to be called big anything.”

  


“You’re still taller than most Gohbs or Kohbs.”

  


“Not by much.” Herbert replies.

  


“You’ll grow out of it.”

  


“With my luck? No. I won’t.”

  


“True. That was a bad shot we... you took. Hmm... hadn’t thought about that incident... speaking of incident. How do you think mom and dad will react when they learn about me?”

  


“Depends of whether or not I send them a highly censored video... still I’m in charge now, I can declassify a lot.” Herbert muses. Then he smiles up at Harold. “Still, good to have a proper partner in crime around here. Harriett is a lot of fun but she’s undercover so often I rarely see or... or recognize her when I do. A strong right hand can really get things going.”

  


“Not to mention with my enabler present I can get up to even more now.” Harold teases and Herbert chuckles.

  


“No kidding, but let’s prioritize. I want to see my nieces, and they need to see their cousins.”

  


“Family dinner I’m thinking?” Harold offers.

  


“I’m thinking you’re right.” Herbert replies.

WTH is Cruise mode??  I see it in the menu but it doesn't have any kind of description.

2.  Is there a way to tell it whether a non-carpet floor is tile or wood?  The settings for floor type are a bit confusing to me.  I'm assuming it is color coded but I'm colorblind so....   But I do see settings for tile and carpet.  No wood though.  Does it even matter?

3.  When I edit the map and try to create a divider between rooms, it tells me to drag the dots until the line turns solid.  Unfortunately, it doesn't turn solid where I'd like to create a divider.   Am I doing this wrong or does this feature just not work very well?

4.  What is the ideal way and what are the ideal settings if I will be using it only as a vacuum and will never use it to mop? I know to remove the mop pads but anything else other than choosing the vacuum-only setting?   Also, with the mop pads removed, when it rolls around it almost looks like it's doing a wheelie and the front end is a slightly higher than the back.  Is this normal?

It mapped an 800 sq ft area in less than 10 minutes but it did not accurately identify two of the rooms. This surprised me as my old Roomba i8 was able to map a similar sized area in about 30 minutes but was able to identify every room accurately. 

Oh, and the CurvX got itself stuck a couple of times trying to climb some coffee tables with slanted legs!  The old and supposedly much dumber i8 has never gotten stuck there.  Just an observation.

Pick up old engines for cheap (free?).  
Pressure wash (I can help you buy a pallet )  
Turn them into coffee tables that sell for $5,500.  
  
Rinse and repeat.

Here's why this is an amazing business idea:

* People are nostalgic about cars, any make or model
* This is very heavy, which is actually a good thing, because of the price point.

You can palletize and ship it around the country for $250 - $600.

Not bad for a $5,500 product, you can bake it into the cost.

* You can create ""viral-able"" content around cleaning the old engine and generate interest that way as you're building it.
* It would be fun to do and could easily scale
* COGS could be very low.
* This auction started at $0, had 427 watchers and 6,300 views and sold for $5,500. There is real demand here.

It doesn't have to be a Porsche engine.

I freaking love this idea.

So I recently got into smart home stuff, and honestly, smart plugs were the perfect starting point. If you're thinking about making your home smarter but don't want to spend a fortune or deal with complicated setups, let me share what I learned.

**Why Smart Plugs Are Perfect for Beginners**

Smart plugs are basically the easiest way to dip your toes into home automation. You just plug them into your regular outlet, connect whatever device you want to control, and boom – you can turn things on and off from your phone. No rewiring, no electrician needed, nothing crazy.

I started using them for my living room lamps and coffee maker. Now I can turn lights on before I even get home, and my coffee starts brewing while I'm still in bed. It's the little things, you know?

**What Makes a Good Smart Plug for Beginners**

When I was figuring this out, I realized a few things matter:

- **Easy app setup** – You don't want to spend hours trying to connect the thing
- **Voice control compatibility** – Works with Alexa or Google Assistant if you have those
- **Compact size** – Some plugs are huge and block other outlets
- **Scheduling features** – Set timers so stuff turns on and off automatically
- **Energy monitoring** – Some show how much electricity you're using

**My Honest Recommendations**

After trying a bunch of different options, I found that sticking with well-reviewed brands makes a huge difference. The cheap no-name ones from random sellers gave me nothing but headaches.

If you want to check out some solid options that actually work well for beginners, I'd recommend looking at [these smart plugs](https://goodhomedeals.com/smart-plugs). They've got different models depending on what features you need, and you can read real customer reviews before buying.

**How I Use Mine**

Here's some practical ways I use smart plugs that might give you ideas:

- **Bedroom fan** – Turns off automatically after I fall asleep
- **Phone charger** – Stops charging at 80% to protect my battery
- **Christmas lights** – Set them to turn on at sunset
- **Old ""dumb"" appliances** – Makes them work with my voice assistant

The cool part is you can start with just one or two plugs and add more as you figure out what works for you. You don't need to automate your whole house right away.

**Things to Keep in Mind**

Smart plugs need WiFi to work, so make sure your router reaches wherever you're planning to use them. Also, don't plug in high-power stuff like space heaters or hair dryers – check the wattage limits.

Most smart plugs work best with things that have a physical on/off switch that stays in the ""on"" position. If you have to press a button every time to turn something on, a smart plug won't help much.

**Bottom Line**

Smart plugs are honestly the best entry point into smart home technology. They're cheap, easy to install, and you'll actually use them unlike some other smart home gadgets that end up collecting dust.

If you're ready to grab a few and start automating, check out [this collection of smart plugs](https://goodhomedeals.com/smart-plugs) to see what fits your needs and budget.

Trust me, once you start using them, you'll wonder why you didn't do this sooner. There's something satisfying about controlling your home from your phone or just yelling at Alexa to turn stuff off when you're already comfortable on the couch.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Ottawa Senators vs. Boston Bruins: A High-Stakes Goal-Fest or a Defensive Meltdown?**

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for a hockey showdown that’s equal parts *“let’s score goals”* and *“who’s missing today?”* On Thursday, November 13, 2025, the Ottawa Senators (-172) host the Boston Bruins (+143) in a game that’s less a hockey match and more of a statistical circus. Let’s break it down with the precision of a Zamboni and the humor of a penguin in a blazer.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Math Class You Didn’t Sign Up For

First, the moneyline: Ottawa is a heavy favorite at -172, implying a **63.2% chance to win**. Boston’s +143 line gives them a **41.1% implied probability**, leaving a 4.7% gap for the bookmakers to collect their vigorish (aka “the vig,” or “the tax on hope”).

But here’s where it gets spicy: The **over/under is set at 6.0–6.5 goals**, with the over priced at **-110 to +210** depending on the book. Given that Ottawa and Boston have combined for **6.7 goals per game this season** (exceeding the over by 0.7–1.2 goals), the over is practically a statistical inevitability. It’s like betting the sun will rise… but with more beer.

---

### Injury Report: A Cast of Thousands (Minus the Stars)

**Ottawa’s woes**: Brady Tkachuk (thumb, out) and Thomas Chabot (upper body, day-to-day) are sidelined. Tkachuk’s absence is like telling a chef they can’t use salt—sure, the food’s still edible, but it’s missing that *oomph*. Chabot’s injury? It’s the hockey equivalent of telling your firewall to take a coffee break. The Senators are 28th in goals allowed (3.6/g), and without Chabot, their defense looks like a sieve made of Jell-O.

**Boston’s skeleton crew**: The Bruins are missing Jordan Harris, Elias Lindholm, Casey Mittelstadt, and John Beecher. It’s like showing up to a concert with only the drummer and a kazoo player. Their defense? A patchwork quilt of hope and prayer. But hey, David Pastrnak (22 points this season) is still out there, slicing through opponents like a Canadian maple syrup tap.

1owdhks,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaximizeMe/comments/1owdhks/gamechanging_life_optimization_tips_boost/,"✨ Game-Changing Life Optimization Tips! 🚀 Boost Productivity, Unlock Joy & Thrive 🔥","Hey Maximizame crew,

Ever have those days where you feel like you're just running on a treadmill? You're busy, you're checking things off a list, but you don't feel like you're actually *moving* forward in a way that matters. It's so easy to get caught up in the grind that we forget the goal isn't just to be productive, but to build a life we genuinely love living.

Let's break down how to shift from just 'doing' to actually 'thriving'.

### **🚀 Let's Talk About Boosting Productivity (Without the Burnout)**

Productivity isn't about being a robot working 24/7. It's about being intentional. It's about getting the important stuff done so you have *more* time and energy for the things that light you up.

Here are a few things that have been game-changers for me:

*   **Tackle the 'One Big Thing' First:** Before you even look at your email, identify the ONE task that, if completed, would make today a win. Do that first. It creates massive momentum for the rest of the day.
*   **Manage Your Energy, Not Just Your Time:** A 45-minute sprint when you're feeling sharp and focused is worth more than 3 hours of exhausted, distracted work. Notice when your energy peaks and dips. Schedule your deep work for the peaks and your admin/easy stuff for the dips.
*   **The 2-Minute Rule is Your Best Friend:** If a task takes less than two minutes to complete (replying to an email, putting a dish away, making a quick call), do it immediately. It prevents small things from piling up and creating a mountain of mental clutter.

### **🔥 Unlocking Joy is a Skill, Not an Accident**

Here's the truth: You can be the most productive person on the planet, but if you're not finding joy in the journey, what's the point? Joy isn't something that just happens *after* you achieve all your goals. You have to cultivate it daily.

*   **Actively Hunt for the Good:** It sounds simple, but actively looking for small things to appreciate completely rewires your brain. The taste of your morning coffee, the sun hitting your face, a funny text from a friend. Don't just notice it; really *feel* the gratitude for a few seconds.
*   **Schedule 'Useless' Time:** Carve out time for something you do just for the fun of it, with zero expectation of it being productive. Doodling, playing a game, listening to an album with your eyes closed. This is how you refill your creative and emotional tank.

This is also where the mental game gets real. Our internal monologue can be our biggest ally or our worst enemy. Sometimes the internal chatter is the biggest roadblock, and getting a handle on it can be tough. I’ve personally found that having a structured approach helps a ton, and I've been getting a lot out of **[this resource (affiliate link)]** for mapping out my emotional goals alongside the practical ones.

Putting it all together is where the magic happens. **Thriving isn't a destination; it's the dance between getting stuff done and enjoying the ride.** It’s about building a life that *feels* as good on the inside as it looks on the outside.

So, I'm curious to hear from you all. What's one small 'game-changer' you've implemented lately that's made a real difference? Or what's the biggest hurdle you're facing right now? Drop it in the comments, let's learn from each other.",1,1763069110.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

i checked my schedule and i work 12:30-8 on thanksgiving so i just feel like I’m being double fucked out of thanksgiving.

1owddzk,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1owddzk/very_confused_about_my_ex/,Very confused about my ex,"I’m super confused by what’s going on right now. My ex broke up with me about 3 weeks ago. We ended up having a lot of fights because she would get mad at me for the smallest stuff. Eventually she admitted that she was growing resentment towards me, so I told her to take a week apart and to take the space to figure out what she wanted to do. She ended up breaking up with me, but this where my head starts to hurt. 

When she broke up with me, she said “I took the week and did a lot of thinking and I realized that I love you so much, and I don’t want to lose you. Which is what makes this so hard, I’ve been nothing but a jerk to you these past months and I’ve been treating you so poorly. Even when I’m at my worst hurting you, you always respond with complete kindness and understanding, and I that’s what hurts me the most. Something is wrong with me and I need to figure out what that is, everything in my life is crumbling down around me and I’m not happy about anything anymore. You are genuinely the kindest and most loving man I’ve ever met, but I can’t keep doing this to you”. 

So, I responded by telling her that I believe in her, gave her some words of encouragement, told her i hope she finds what she’s looking for, said I loved her and gave her a kiss on the head while hugging her. I made a small joke saying I felt she was self sabotaging and she laughed and said she thinks so too. Then, as I left she said “I love you” and I said I love you too. Boom, relationship over. Left her alone for a week.

During that week, she kept all of our couple posts up and had me in her bio. Which I found weird, because she’s very active on social media, something she always did during the relationship was constantly change up her instagram. Kinda like rearranging your room, she finds it fun. So, me being up there for so long? Made me think that she still held deep feelings for me and maybe didn’t want to give us up.

Come another week, we start to hangout like we used to, studying for classes, getting coffee, etc. Everything is nice, she’s laughing again, I’m being flirty and she’s responding well, it’s like things were calming down for us. We go out on a walk a couple days ago, and I had an idea. She LOVES the notebook and romance movies, always about true love never dying or withering away, that kind of stuff. So when she broke up with me, to sort my thoughts and ease my deep want to not give up and let love prevail (lol), I wrote her letters every day without sending them. When we went on our walk, I brought them to give to her. 

Now, key detail here, I didn’t do this to win her back and I still don’t plan on getting back together with her now. We both need to sort our own worlds first. But, I wanted to be honest with her and let her know that I still have love in my heart for her. So, in a quiet moment, I said something along the lines of “Hey, so these past couple weeks I’ve had a lot of time to think. There’s stuff in my personal life that’s been stopping me from being my best self, so I’ve been working through them. I’ve also realized through this little bit of time that I still have love for you in my heart. I’m not trying to pressure you back into anything, I’m not even ready for something like that, and I don’t expect anything from you either. I’m only saying this because I want to be honest with you and I want you to know that even though we aren’t together, you still matter to me.” And then I let her know about the letters. Her reaction was not very happy. 

She basically got pretty stressed, said she was afraid this would happen, only wanted to be friends, that kind of stuff. We talked for a bit and eventually I gave her the letters and went home. So now I’m confused. We dated for about half a year. Now, suddenly for her it’s like nothing even happened. I’m still up on her spam account with couple photos as her recent posts which is confusing. She posts stuff about movies and songs and they’re all romantic about wanting true real unconditional love, wanting to be seen. So I basically have no idea wtf she wants. 

As of right now, I’ve just stopped talking to her. I’ll let my letters do any talking for me, but my friends say she’s an avoidant. The whole relationship she would run from her own feelings either by not talking about them or pinning the blame on anything else but a deeper issue. I also hate how somehow now it feels like my love is a burden on her. I get maybe it was a little heavy to hear, but I really did try to keep it light and I did not want it to be a “I miss you let’s get back together” talk because I don’t want that right now. 

If she’s an avoidant, what do I even do?",1,1763068872.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1owddv6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jung/comments/1owddv6/why_do_i_feel_a_compulsive_attraction_to_someone/,Why do I feel a compulsive attraction to someone that resembles to an abusive figure in childhood?,"Im sitting in this coffee bar while reading a Jung’s book. I go there every day to read.
There’s this waiter I noticed many days ago. I feel a compulsive intrigue and secret fascination or attraction to him. I find him very sexually appealing. 

I’m an intuitive introvert. I see through him. I see in him so much about his life. 

His persona is very firm and still gentile, a good host, very firm and secure, but warm. 
I notice in him some darkness beyond his “façade” and I grasp he had in his 20’s a close relationship with drugs and alcohol.
I see him someone with potential but he is not intellectually fulfilled. He is street smart tho. 

I see he has some passionate nature behind his persona that I can recognize as violent tendencies or uncontrollable violence of some sort. Also some conflict with being dominated or overwhelmed by women. 
Also I grasp some criminal attitudes very hidden. Someone from the hood. I see all that in his mannerisms and overall energy. 

At the same time I’m there in an attempt of being noticed by him, and there’s some sort of strong sexual attraction I feel on both sides. Even if we don’t speak beyond me ordering something; it’s just there. 

Today we spoke a bit and during the conversation he opened up about some of his life. 
All my observations were accurate and he talked about violence in the hood; street justice ( in an attempt to educate teens to respect elders ) his past selling drugs to earn easy money; and his previous excesses with drugs and alcohol that now are ocasional. 

I find all of this awful and even if “ I knew “ there I was; trying to be noticed by him. Liked by him. 

I could see how much he reminded me of the life of the ex husband of my mother when I was a kid. He was very very abusive and violet and a drug dealer. 
I don’t know if this guy is abusive, but something resembled or pointed to my memories.

I could feel while the waiter was speaking about himself some emotional turbulence and not very pleasant sensations in my stomach. I immediately felt I was in the past again with “ those type of people” ( the hood people / bad life people ). 
He still a very decent person in his behavior while he speaks; and overall appearance.  

I don’t know why; even if I understood that my primal attraction to him, I guess, was some familiarity with childhood experiences ( very painful ) there’s this sexual attraction to him. Some sort of compulsion. 
My emotional attraction instantly dropped when he spoke about himself; but there’s some inner voice that wants “to play with fire”. Some sexual wanting of him. 

Is this my shadow? In my 20’s I would have not even thought about any of this. Just run for it. Why do we walk toward what’s harmful but familiar? I’m trying to understand why these forces appear as they do. To show what’s hiding inside? To “reconcile” some painful content in the unconscious? 

I felt so much urge to talk to him or interact with him.. why? ",2,1763068865.0,Jung,0,0.75,False

I began a new job last winter & immediately became friendly with a coworker (F30s) who is married. She complimented my lipstick & skin & I told her how beautiful I thought she was too. We would chat almost every morning while we made coffee. Our eyes would light up when we saw each other. She would always wink at me when she passed my desk,everytime. I started leaving her little post it notes on her desk, on her water bottle or in her jacket pocket. they would say ""hope your day is going well"" ""you look pretty today"" that kind of thing. she loved them & would come by my desk to say how sweet I was. She even left notes for me too. 
We had some really good conversations about current events,our families, books & such. She said we should get coffee together sometime & she would bring me a book to read. Then we had a work event & I talked to her pretty much the entire time. The day after that she kind of avoided me all day & said she didn't feel well. I said ok, let me know if she needs anything. A few days later we were talking about a book of poetry I was reading & how beautiful it was. I ordered it for her & left it on her desk one morning.
 After that she literally stopped looking at me & talking to me completely. She never mentioned the book. She would look at her phone when she walked by, no winking. She even started walking around a different way when going to the bathroom/copy room so she didnt have to walk by my desk.  

After a few weeks I asked her if everything was OK because she never talks to me or looks at me, I asked her if she just didn't like me or what. She said it wasn't that she didn't like me, she was just really busy. I said there must be another reason but she just looked down & didn't say anything. Then she would just give me dirty looks whenever I came into the bathroom/break room & she was in there, so I would leave & wait til she was done. 
I literally have NO IDEA why she would do any of this! 
Finally I saw her in the bathroom one day & told her I wouldn't go to the office lunch that day because I clearly make her uncomfortable. She said she was sorry for hurting me & that she was ""misreading"" what was going on & she had a ""personal problem"" she was dealing with. She never would tell me what she was misreading. I didn't believe that but was just happy to talk to her again. After that I tried to talk to her a few times & she was short & rude. Here & there I would see her look at me but then she'd look away quickly. 
I started leaving her notes asking what I did & telling her I'd do anything to make up for it & that I dont understand whats going on at all. I can't think of anything I did. I also told her if I was bothering her to tell me & I'd stop. She never answered one of my notes. 
Last week we were passing each other in the hallway, no one else was around. I said good morning & she ignored me. Later in the afternoon, I asked how her day was & she ignored me again, like she didn't hear me. The next day I said ""Goodbye have a good weekend"" as she was leaving & was completely ignored again. I know she heard me, I was right behind her.
 I guess I just want to know what I did. She used to be so sweet to me & toss her hair & we'd laugh together & now she seems to hate me.

1owd98c,https://www.reddit.com/r/HereForTheStoryEh/comments/1owd98c/i_found_out_my_boyfriend_was_cheating_with_a_girl/,I Found Out My Boyfriend Was Cheating… With a Girl He Met at Canadian Tire. The Whole Town Knew Except Me.,"So, I (28F) live in a pretty small Canadian town. The kind where everyone knows everyone, and gossip travels faster than a snowmobile in January.



I’d been with my boyfriend, ""Dean"" (30M), for almost three years. We lived together in this little rented bungalow with a dog, a shared Costco membership, and what I thought was a solid future. Dean works as a mechanic — super charming, real “fixes stuff and smells like oil” kind of guy. Not particularly ambitious, but funny and good with his hands. I thought that was enough.



Turns out, Dean had been getting real friendly with a girl named Kelsey (22F), who works in the seasonal department at Canadian Tire.



Let me paint this picture for you: while I was at home doing laundry and meal prepping, Dean was “*popping into town to grab windshield wiper fluid*” like… three times a week. Guess who was always working that aisle?



Yeah. Kelsey. The same girl who restocks patio furniture in the summer and fake trees in the winter.



I had no clue… but apparently? Everyone else did.



It started with weird vibes. People giving me that “*aww honey*” look at Thrifty's. My hairdresser hesitated before asking, “So… you and Dean still going strong?” The final straw was when the girl at Tim Hortons refused to take my money and just said, “You deserve this coffee, trust me.”



I finally cracked when my cousin, who works at the pharmacy across from Canadian Tire, texted:



>""Hey… hate to be that person, but I’ve seen Dean hanging around CT a LOT. And not just for deals on snow brushes.""



I went digging. Google search history? Sketchy. Glovebox? Worse. That’s where I found a seasonal staff badge with Kelsey’s name on it — and a wad of Canadian Tire Money stuffed in the back like some kind of forbidden love token.



This man was out here hoarding Canadian Tire Money like it was gold bullion. Like they were building a life together, one fake dollar bill at a time.



When I confronted him, Dean actually said:



>“It’s not serious. She just gives me staff discount and lets me keep the CT Money.”



I thought he was joking. He wasn’t.



So now I’m furious, humiliated, and apparently the last person in town to find out my boyfriend was double-timing me with a girl who sells barbecue covers.



But I didn’t just cry about it. I decided to get even.





**The Revenge**



Our town holds a big “Spring Market Day” every May. It’s a huge deal. Pop-up booths, food trucks, garage sale tables, community groups — and of course, Canadian Tire always has a booth. Guess who was working it this year?



Kelsey. In her little red shirt. Beaming. Surrounded by seed packets, pots and those white Canadian Tire buckets every house at least two of.



So I got petty.



I printed flyers. One side: a sweet photo of Dean and me with our dog. The other side? A bold headline:

**""Have You Seen This Man? He’s Loyal to No One — Not Even His Triangle Rewards Card.""**



Below that? Screenshots of his messages to Kelsey, including:



>“I like that you don’t nag me about money. She always wants to 'save for a rainy day'. You just give me free lawn chairs.”



And the best part?

I brought every. single. Canadian Tire bill I could find — all the crumpled, torn, weirdly sacred little scraps I dug out of Dean’s drawers, glove box, and junk pile. Probably like $18 total. I made it absolutely RAIN.



Right in front of their booth.



I dropped them like confetti.



People stared. A kid tried to grab some. Kelsey froze. Her manager came over from the Bannock lady's booth. I handed out flyers like I was campaigning for office and walked away sipping a lemonade like I was on a damn runway.



Dean texted me later:



>“You embarrassed me. You’re acting crazy.”



I replied:



>“You’re lucky I didn’t bring the receipt for the snowblower I bought you.”



He moved out two days later. She quit before the weekend was over. And I? I now shop at Home Hardware. Where the employees don’t seduce your boyfriend in aisle 12.",1,1763068569.0,HereForTheStoryEh,0,1.0,False

Since then I have found it very difficult to find new ones and connect with people. For the last 4 years I had no friends. I mean i guess i had acquantances. At the time i was like i will meet my best friends in college it will be ok.

Now that im here, its still the same as school. I have a lot of acquaintances and people i chill with for coffee, chats etc. but i dont have any actual friends? I never get invited to anything unless i invite myself. The last few college nights out i had to ask 'OMG what are ye guys doing tonight?...Can i come too?' They dont say no, but i feel unwanted as they never think of me.

I dont drink, smoke, vape or kiss boys. And thats what im overthinking. I feel like i have to do those things to fit in so i can talk about it with everyone else. And youmay be thinking 'dont change who you are for someone else, '. But the thing is i genuinely like hanging around with these types of people - the extraverted crazy ones but im not AS extraverted and crazy i just like hanging out with them.

But i feel like they think im boring and quiet as im never the one sharing the funny stories im always the responsive one like OMG yaa haha! But yeah guys im so jealous of those who have a cute small friend group who you can do stuff with without overthinking. I often find myself going to EVERY event because im scared ill get left behind again.

1owd6f6,https://www.reddit.com/r/immortalists/comments/1owd6f6/spinach_significantly_increases_lifespan_here_are/,Spinach significantly increases lifespan. Here are scientific evidence and best ways to eat Spinach with similiar foods suggestions like Leafy Green Vegetables.,"Spinach is one of the most powerful gifts nature ever gave us. It’s not just a green leaf you throw in your salad. It’s pure life energy. Every bite of spinach is packed with nutrients that protect your DNA, boost your blood flow, and slow down aging at the deepest cellular level. People who eat spinach and other leafy greens every day live longer, look younger, and feel more alive. This is not a myth, it’s proven by science.

Inside spinach, there are powerful molecules like lutein, zeaxanthin, chlorophyll, and quercetin: real guardians of your cells. They protect your DNA and mitochondria, which are your body’s tiny power plants. When these stay healthy, you age slower. Studies from the Journal of Nutrition and Free Radical Biology & Medicine show that these compounds stop oxidative damage: the kind that makes you tired, weak, and older faster. Spinach literally acts like a shield, protecting your cells every single day.

But that’s not all. Spinach creates something amazing inside your body called nitric oxide. This tiny molecule is a secret of youth. It opens your blood vessels, helps oxygen move better, and keeps your circulation young. Research in Hypertension and Circulation Research proved that people who eat spinach daily have better blood flow and lower blood pressure, like people decades younger. So, when you eat spinach, you’re not just eating. You’re fueling your arteries with vitality.

Spinach also works deep in your genes. It’s full of folate, betaine, and magnesium: the nutrients that help your DNA stay properly “switched on.” Scientists call this process DNA methylation, and when it’s stable, your cells act younger. A study in Aging showed that folate and magnesium make your biological clock tick slower, while Clinical Epigenetics found that leafy greens improve longevity gene activity. Spinach keeps your genes calm and balanced. It literally helps write the code for a longer life.

It’s also a detox hero. Spinach activates the same Nrf2 pathway that broccoli does. This is your body’s master cleanup system. It tells your cells to make more glutathione, your strongest antioxidant, and remove toxins before they do harm. Nutrients (2019) and Food Chemistry (2021) both confirmed this: spinach can protect your liver, your brain, and your entire body from inflammation and stress. It’s like giving your cells a daily shower from the inside out.

Even your muscles love spinach. Its nitrates and magnesium help your mitochondria create clean energy, so you move easier, breathe better, and feel stronger. In the Journal of Applied Physiology, people who took spinach extract increased their muscle power by 11%. That’s huge. So, if you ever feel tired, maybe what you really need is not coffee. It’s spinach.

The real proof comes when you look at the big picture. Massive population studies, like those in the BMJ and European Journal of Epidemiology, show that people who eat just one serving of leafy greens a day live 20–25% longer on average. That’s years of extra life. Simply by eating plants like spinach, kale, arugula, and beet greens. Leafy greens work together in harmony, giving you vitamins, nitrates, carotenoids, and polyphenols that lower inflammation and protect your heart.

The best way to eat spinach? Keep it simple but smart. Steam or sauté it lightly for a minute or two. That keeps its nutrients alive while lowering oxalates. Add olive oil, avocado, or a handful of nuts to help your body absorb the lutein and carotenoids. For a raw energy boost, blend spinach gently with lemon, apple, or kiwi to keep the nitrates intact. Don’t boil it too long. Heat destroys its magic. Pair it with tofu, yogurt, or cheese to bind oxalates safely and add calcium for strong bones.

If you want to supercharge your longevity, mix spinach with its green friends. Kale brings sulforaphane for detox, arugula boosts nitric oxide, swiss chard gives magnesium for energy, and beet greens enhance DNA methylation. Together they’re like a green army defending your body from aging. Add a splash of lemon or a drizzle of olive oil and you’ve got a delicious, healing meal that’s simple, cheap, and full of life.

So next time you look at that pile of green leaves, see it for what it really is: medicine, energy, and youth all in one. Spinach is not just food; it’s your daily promise to stay young, strong, and full of light. Every forkful feeds your cells, your heart, and your future. The secret to a longer, healthier life might already be sitting on your plate. Bright, green, and alive. Eat spinach every day, and let your body remember how it feels to live forever young.",45,1763068396.0,immortalists,4,0.96,False
1owd63o,https://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/1owd63o/why_is_this_intp_acting_like_this/,Why is this intp acting like this?,"

I've noticed for a while that an intp always tries to plot some way to make me angry, maybe he finds it fun or sees it as a challenge since I rarely show any emotion. He does this in both serious and silly situations. I don't usually care much about these things, but today I've been analyzing this carefully. 

For a detailed example: today (on the rare occasion that I agreed to interact with someone), we were having afternoon tea, and he offered to make me tea and coffee for himself.

I chose the tea I like, but there was only one packet, and he immediately wanted to drink my tea instead of his coffee, (deliberately acting like a child who wants something). I offered him other tea options, but he insisted he only wanted the one I was going to drink and even asked what flavor it was (intensifying the game of acting like a spoiled child).

So, after much insistence, I decided I would drink that tea, which only had enough for one cup, (he didn't even want tea because he wanted coffee),  and that he was only insisting on wanting my tea right away as a joke. 

For me, that was fine, and I went to do other important things while he boiled the water and prepared everything.

At some point, he said he was going out to buy things to eat for afternoon tea and that my tea was already ready on the table. I noticed a slight smirk and suspicious interaction, but I continued doing my important things.

When he left, I went to check the tea and he had put in the other flavor of tea that I had offered him, so he planned to irritate me when we were about to drink the tea and I would be forced to drink the other flavor instead of the one I chose.

Luckily, the water for the coffee was boiling before it was mixed with the coffee, and I managed to pour enough for my cup of tea without having to waste time waiting for the water to boil to make another cup.

When he arrived, I was already at the table drinking my tea, and he immediately came over with the same smirk to check if I was angry and drinking the other tea he had made.

He realized I had made the tea I had chosen, and he seemed slightly frustrated that his plan had failed. He asked how I managed to prepare my tea so quickly, then acted as if nothing had happened. I asked if he was going to drink the tea he had made, but he refused and ""secretly"" threw it away.

This was a silly example that happened today, but I've already encountered serious situations where he tried to devise ways to irritate me so that I would lose my logic. I feel this as a game of logic contest, where he is astonished because somehow I anticipate and don't fall into the traps he plans.

Does anyone know why he's acting like this? Is it something competitive? Is it a way of expressing friendship? Does he enjoy seeing people angry? 🤨",1,1763068376.0,INTP,14,1.0,False

I 33M 1,75cm, started at 95kg. I am currently 90kg.

I have been doing ADF since the start of September consistently with a week off in the middle because of some things going on.

In the beginning I had some trouble with dirty fasting being more of a refeed so I screwed over some days there but lately I have been super consistent.

I do clean fasts every fast day, they range between 24 to 36 hours. I have been doing them pretty easily lately tbh. I only drink sparkling water, normal water and coffee without sugar or milk.

On feast days I some times eat kinda card heavy diet but there is always a lot of protein. I don' t think I am doing crimes. 

I exercise a lot 4 times a week, cross training, weight lifting etc.

I feel great, I have changed a lot and am way more buff and have improved at gym significantly. I am not losing weight the last 2 weeks. I am stuck at 90 and my fasts are completely clean, which makes no sense cause I am in massive deficit. I am not sure what I am doing wrong. ",3,1763068349.0,AlternateDayFasting,0,1.0,False

There’s great deals to be sure. Cold brew coffees are a no brainer, the Reveal cat food boxes are almost human grade and a decent deal on bogo, a lot of berries are a decent buy on bogo, as are some sodas and especially zephyrhills water. 

But there’s some questionable stuff too, mainly overpriced items that are close to regular price on bogo. Like the mozzarella cheese that’s 7.99, on bogo it’s two for eight bucks, but it’s $5 at Walmart. The wines are the worst, $25 bottles of wine on bogo that are 12-15 elsewhere. Beef on bogo is great although rare, chicken, pork too and it’s more frequent. Tupperware and Pyrex containers are a good deal on bogo, as are paper plates and plastic cups. Greek yogurts, almond butter, fruit preserves are all great on bogo and so on. 

But my favorite part of BOGO is scoring a rain check. I’ve been know to collect them strategically, but they’re usually only good for a month. Unless you come in for it and they’re out, they’ll extend the raincheck.

Ok so I know my stuff, but I’m sure there’s inside knowledge that can really boost my BOGO fu. Any tricks to stretch them out, work the deals, get rainchecks even though they’re not sold out?

when i first started taking medication (Synthyroid, now 37.5mcg) i had felt a visible shift in my energy levels. i no longer felt sleepy throughout the day, took less naps, was more attentive in my classes, enjoyed doing outdoor activtities and more. 

i've noticed that for the past 3-4 years, the tiredness has come back. even if i go to bed at 10 and wake up at 9, i feel groggy. by mid-day, i'm in need of a nap. i've talked to my endo about this but she just said it's probably because of my age (and this might just be it) since my levels look fine to her. i just don't know how to curb the effects of it. i've been skipping few of my lectures because i simply don't have enough energy to commute almost 40 minutes to college and i've been hanging out with friends and family less too. 

i hate the way it makes me feel. i was doing really good with my workouts but now i can't even stay on the treadmill for over 20 minutes without my head starting to hurt or feeling unstable. i'm eating 3 meals a day that are nutritionally balanced, so i genuinely don't know what's wrong with my body. i can't drink any energy drinks or coffee because i'm sensitive, and my heart starts racing and my hands get super shaky. are there any alternatives to this or should i continue bringing it up in my appointments and seeing what my doctor says? i just feel confused at this point.

1owd31r,https://www.reddit.com/r/MoneyDiariesACTIVE/comments/1owd31r/im_a_resident_doctor_making_190000_hhi_and_this/,"I'm a resident doctor making $190,000+ HHI and this week I am a bridesmaid in my friend's wedding!","# Introduction:

I am a married resident physician making a combined $190,000ish base salary and this week I am a bridesmaid in my friend’s wedding!I have 2 years left in my program, and my husband and I are looking at trying to buy a house and currently TTC. Unfortunately my husband does not have any opportunity for overtime in his job so most of our “extra” money for non-recurring expenses and travel come from the extra shifts that I work.   
 **Age:** 30 

**Occupation:** Resident physician   
**Industry:** Medicine   
**Salary:** My husband and I share all money, accounts and expenses. He makes $130,000 and I make $62,000 as a base. I also have the opportunity to do “moonlighting” shifts that pay anywhere from $75 - $110 per hour before taxes. I aim for an extra $2K - $3K per month  with extra shifts depending on how busy my regular work is 

 **Paycheck Amount (after tax):** $5,500 (husband) after 20% 401K contribution, insurance, etc. $4,100 (me, base), varies but $2-3K (me, extra shifts), also after 15% 401K contribution 

 **Savings:** (retirement, high-yield, emergency fund, etc.):

\-  Future house/baby fund: $100,000 in HYSA; \~$60,000 in investments 

\- Emergency fund: $31,000 in HYSA (no longer actively adding to this) 

\- Retirement: \~$100,000 (me), $40,000 (husband - got a little bit of a later start) 

\- Other assets: $40,000ish, two cars that are paid off 

**Debt/family help:** My parents were immigrants who believe that education is the most important thing to spend money on, at the expense of pretty much everything else. They also believed very strongly that 18 is too young to be out on your own. I got a Presidential Scholarship to college that paid my full tuition, and lived at home and commuted to school all 4 years. I paid no rent, bills, food etc while I was in school and was encouraged not to work and focus on studying, even as a college student. I also was not allowed to work in high school, so by the time I got to college I was itching for my own money and autonomy. I got a job basically as soon as I got to campus. I was on a full-time schedule at my campus job by my senior year and have been working ever since, including through medical school. 

  
 **Monthly Expenses:**

* Rent: $2260 
* Utilities: $100 electricity, $45 gas, $20 water 
* Internet (includes Disney+, Hulu and HBO), trash collection, ground maintenance: included in our rent 
* Phone: $40/month for two lines 
* Subscriptions: $121/month for Spotify, Netflix, coffee delivery (2 bags of espresso every 3 weeks), Apple storage, and ChatGPT
* Gym: $185 for me, $35 for my husband - this is new for us, he is usually the expensive gym guy but is between MMA studios at the moment. I recently (unfortunately) fell in love with Reformer pilates, so here we are.  
* Insurance: $145/month for 2 paid off cars 
* Annual subscriptions/costs: $95 x2 for each of our Chase cards, $90/year for NYT total package, $600ish per year for registration for our two cars, $20 renter’s insurance 
* Retirement savings: we max out two ROth IRAs every year ($14,000) and fund retirement   

**Day 1:** 

8:30am: I had requested the morning off to go to an ObGyn appointment this morning, so I have a very leisurely start to my day. I have my coffee in a real, ceramic mug instead of a to-go cup (!) - really people, it's the little things - and read the end of *All Fours.* It’s ok. 

9:45am: Go in for my appointment, and my ultrasound looks good, which is a relief. **$55** for my specialist co-pay. 

11am - Go to get a dip manicure in burgundy to match my bridesmaid dress for this weekend. I had tried to wean myself off of dip manicures and it took me pretty much from February to August for my last manicure to grow all the way out. I had bought materials to give myself home manicures, partly to save money but also because having to have my manicure drilled off is not my favorite sensation in the world. I used to do these myself, but they required weekly upkeep and I had to be careful about what kind of household chores I did with fresh nails. Turns out after 2 years of monthly dip I am 1) spoiled 2) impatient, so basically back to outsourcing this service. Unfortunately we do love our manicures though, they bring joy. **$55** including removal and tip. 

12:30 - Get a call from my chief that I will be needed to work an overnight shift tonight so I rearrange some plans. I’m starving but I sign up for a pilates class at 1pm (included in monthly expenses). After getting my ass summarily handed to me, I drive home, shower, eat some leftover chicken pot pie and lie down to try and nap before my shift. 

4pm - Meh, that was unsuccessful. I watch Grey’s Anatomy reruns for a couple of hours before peeling myself out of bed to go to the hospital. 

7pm - Get signout from the day team. I’m working with a new intern but she seems very competent, which is either fantastic or terrifying. We admit 4 patients before we reach our cap and mercifully they are all tucked in with orders and meds and diets before 2am. I head to the on-call room to sleep for a few hours after making the intern swear to call me if she has even an inkling of doubt about how to handle a situation. 

4:30am  - My phone rings and it is my intern who is (appropriately) concerned for a patient who is having trouble breathing and who has not been peeing for most of the night. We spend a lot of time at bedside, some of it to convince the patient’s wife that yes, he does need medicines right now even if they hurt his kidneys. He has been prescribed a medicine to help make him pee that according to his wife his prescribing doctor said “to use only in emergencies.” I explain that he is very close to needing ICU-level care, and that most people would agree that this is an emergency. She obviously loves him so much but it is time for her to depend on us for guidance. Finally she acquiesces and we give him the medicine he needs. His breathing stabilizes a little bit, giving us all a minute to catch our breaths and regroup. 

**Day total:** $110

**Day 2:** Tuesday 

9:30am - Finish presenting and rounding on the four new patients and checking in on the overnight guy. His breathing is ok but he still isn’t peeing. I find out later that after we sign him out to the day team he does end up being transferred to the ICU and needing to start on dialysis :( Fingers crossed he does ok. 

10:15 - Someone had said the word bagel during morning rounds so I absolutely must go get a bagel. Stop at what is apparently the best bagel shop in the city - someone says “I’m from NYC and these are NYC level” so I’m sold. Toasted everything bagel with cream cheese and a small coffee runs me **$6.83** after a $2 off “sandwich and coffee” special that brought me more joy than it should have. 

11am - Get a text that I’ll be pulled to a shift tomorrow, which means I’m protected from getting pulled tonight. I let myself take a 45 minute nap and then make myself get up so I can sleep tonight. 

12pm - make chicken and potatoes for the next couple days of meals for my husband and I. I’m not hungry yet from my bagel but will probably have this for dinner. 

2pm - pilates class 

3:30pm - I am showered, changed and curled on the couch with a bowl of orecchiette pasta smothered in parmesan, fresh truffle and truffle oil. As any self-respecting resident will tell you, night calories don’t count (including when you are post-nights!). I also hang out with my husband briefly when he comes out of his home office cave to make coffee. 

5:30 - He is off work and snuggles for a bit on the couch before he goes to the gym. He has dinner when he gets home and I switch from my TV rotation of Grey’s Anatomy - Friends - Chopped - Gilmore Girls. 

9:30 - Sleep sleep sleep. 

**Day total:** $6.83

**Day 3:** Wednesday 

6am: At work for the morning, and start rounding on my patient list. We have a team of 4 people, and today we can admit up to 3 patients, which is really not bad at all. We do our best to look at the overnight events and labs for all of our “old” patients so that when admissions come up we are ready to take them. With this rotation we can leave when our work is done since someone is always here (which is great unless you’re the 24-hour person, more on that to come), so efficiency is the name of my game. 

8:45am: After seeing our “olds”, I work with the medical student to help her understand what our patient is coming in for and what information we want to get to the patient when we talk to them. Meanwhile my intern does a lot of the work and communications that need to happen for our existing patients in the background. I’ve gotten so lucky this week with a stellar medical student and intern - truly so important for quality of life. 

9:00am: As we head to the ER to see the new patient, I realize that I have not had any caffeine this morning and am really dragging. I run to the cafeteria to grab a cup of coffee - **$2.02**

12:00pm: Got two more admissions while we were seeing the first patient, so we spent the morning in the ER getting to know all three of our new patients. We then head back to the workroom to “present” the patients to our attending (supervising doctor). He is in agreement with my plans for these new folks, so we get to work putting in orders for them, calling consultants and writing their notes. Also have a working lunch of chicken and potatoes somewhere in there. 

3:00pm: Sign off our patients to the on-call team that will be here all night and head out. I have a couple of hours to kill before my pilates class so I'm off to run some errands. 

3:30: Head to Whole Foods to pick up groceries for the week: chicken breasts and thighs, ground turkey, avocados, tomatoes, grape tomatoes, plums, peanut butter, leeks, green onions, spinach, cabbage, apples, carrots, potatoes, Greek yogurt, mushrooms, bell peppers, eggs, milk, rolled oats, basmati rice, and smoked salmon - **$72.50** 

4:15pm: Go to pick up dry cleaning - I am a bridesmaid in a wedding in a few weeks and the dress is of course dry clean only. **$17.10** 

4:30pm: Notice I am next to a regular supermarket so pop in to grab some travel toothpaste for my overnight call bag. **$3.08** 

4:45pm: Pilates class with my favorite instructor - I get my ass summarily handed to me but in the best possible way.. 

6pm: Back at the hospital for a moonlighting shift. We get some free money to spend at the cafeteria at certain times of day so I use it tonight to buy hospital sushi and a banana. Would be \~$16 but free. 

11:30pm: Get home after a largely uneventful shift. My husband is the best human in the world and has packed me lunch and made me overnight oats for breakfast for tomorrow. Also has set the coffee maker (swoon!)

11:45pm: Crawl into bed after a quick shower. 

**Day total:** $94.70

**Day 4:** Thursday

7am: Today is my intern and my medical student’s day off so it’s me and my attending doctor. Today is also the day in the call cycle where I don’t have to admit any new patients, which means all I have to do is see and set plans for the “olds.” I have to do all the work and paperwork, but I also get to set the pace, which I love. 

10:30am: Pause for our weekly journal club where we discuss a paper relevant to the work we’re doing. This week it’s about not letting people eat before surgery. 

12:15pm: sign out to the on-call team, a little later than my goal of noon, but a great showing overall. 

4:30pm: wake up after a glorious nap. Get up, eat, and talk to my grandma for a bit. 

5:30pm: Pilates again - this class is less fun than yesterday’s, but I am walking more comfortably after, so that’s a plus? 

6:30pm: debate with my husband on whether we should go out for drinks and burgers to enjoy the nice weather or if we should just stay home. We have burger patties in the freezer, so he throws those on the stove and chops a salad. We just started watching Game of Thrones (yes, I know, like 10 years late for me), so we watch two episodes of that. I also pack my overnight bag in case I get called into work. My husband tells me he put gas on his way to the gym, **$45.10.** 

I was on a jeopardy shift to work tonight but did not get called in. Lucky me today is the announcement that they are going to cut 10% of flights in major airports, including the one I’m flying into for the wedding tomorrow. I briefly considered paying $150 to change my ticket to leave at 7am instead of 10:45am but truly who even knows if that would do anything. Le sigh. Hooray for marble bathrooms in the East Wing though. 

**Day total:** $45.10 

**Day 5:** Friday 

6:30am: Up for the day, have a very leisurely breakfast of a homemade waffle with peanut butter and honey and a yogurt parfait. Also have Greek yogurt with apple slices. This is especially great because I was emotionally prepared to have to get on this flight for the wedding after being up all night for a shift, so I feel extra rested and buoyed by the good news. Throw a protein bar in my bag because I’ll forget to do it later. 

8:30am: Leave for the airport. I am in this wedding and my husband is not, so we have planned for him to miss the rehearsal and the rehearsal dinner, so he doesn’t need to take a day off of work. Make it to the airport without issue, leave my car in long-term parking and take the shuttle to the airport. I fill up my water bottle when I pass security, and try to avoid the siren call of croissants-coffees-Nerds Clusters - CheezIts. 

10:45am: We have… left on time? I’m stunned, this doesn’t even happen when the government isn’t shut down and TSA is working as scheduled. The very nice man sitting next to me interrupts my reading 4 times in a few hours to make conversation. I try my hardest to keep a polite face on because even though I don’t want to talk to him right this minute, I think people being about to start and maintain conversations with strangers is actually a key tenet of a healthy society. On his last interruption he recommends I look at the view while we’re landing and totally redeems himself because he was right, it is a gorgeous fall day and the leaves in the parks are stunning from the air.

1:30pm: I land and take a shuttle bus that drops off a few blocks away from my hotel. I was planning on an Uber but Google Maps said this bus would get me there faster, and it happened to be waiting right outside when I walked out the door. There is some signage about scanning a QR code to buy a ticket but I can’t get the link to work and no one around me can either, so I guess I got a free trip into the city from the airport. Then I walk to my hotel and am able to score early check in! The rehearsal is at 3pm, and I booked a hotel within walking distance to all the festivities, so while I should have plenty of time to grab some food and coffee before I putter around for too long and miss my chance. I do finish my book though (The Safekeep, I’d give it 7/10) and shower before heading over to the chapel where the wedding will take place. 

4pm: Yay! Rehearsed and so so happy to get to see all my friends. We are a close group from college and unfortunately now live scattered all across the country so we can only manage annual trips, usually in March. This wedding was our trip this year, which is lovely but means I haven’t seen my people in like 20 months, since last last March! After we rehearse we all go back to our hotels to get ready for the rehearsal dinner, which starts in an hour. 

5:15pm: I am late to leave, and so is everyone else so we drive separately. I input the name of the restaurant, sit in rush hour traffic for 25 minutes and on arrival realize that I am at the wrong restaurant (apparently there are like 5 of these in the city). I feel like a country bumpkin. **$18.20 for my Lyft.** 

5:50pm: After this devastating news I go back outside to call another Lyft to take me to the correct version of the restaurant, which takes another 40 minutes. I am very late and STARVING because of my poor planning. **$33.50 for my second lift.** 

6:30: Thankfully many people were late to the festivities because of traffic. And even more thankfully the food and the bar are perfect. I have like 20 oysters and ceviche and sliders (yes, this wedding is \~fancy\~) and finally feel like a human again. I don’t actually drink because of TTC at the moment but they make me an amazing ginger beer cocktail that gives me life. We chat about life and I feel like that meme about friends in their 20s and 30s. One friend is doing IVF, we may be doing IVF soon, another couple is getting married next summer, another couple has just recently started dating but is absolutely smitten… Also par for the course is work drama, family deaths, personal disappointments. I am just feeling so grateful for great friends like these to get to talk through all this stuff with, especially that we’ve maintained our friendship from afar for so many years. 

10pm: We close down the rehearsal dinner and move into the main part of the restaurant to sit at the bar for a bit. The groom and groomsmen are all going out to other bars for a sort of last minute bachelor-esque party. It is rainy and cold and we are all beat (plus as the bridesmaid we have to start getting ready at like 9am) so we all call it a night. One of my friends is headed in the same direction as me so she calls the Uber back home. My husband texts and is like 15 minutes out as well, so I order him room service because he is also starving. A cheeseburger and caesar salad, with delivery to the room and tip **$52.55.** He also spent **$5.40** on public transport to get from the airport to the hotel. 

12am: Catch him up on all the news and drama of the day and promptly conk out. 

**Day total:** $109.65 

**Day 7:** Saturday and Wedding Day! 

7:30am: Wake up with my husband and walk around with him for a bit on a search for coffee and breakfast. We go to a bakery and sit by the window to people watch until I have to be at the bride’s hotel. He gets a latte and a breakfast sandwich and I get a tea and a yogurt parfait, **$22.80.** 

9:00am: Spot one of the other bridesmaids in the bakery and realize in a panic that we are running late for the hair-makeup-getting ready part of the day. Thankfully we are close, so we power walk to the bride’s hotel, and I kiss my husband goodbye for the better part of the day. I think he and the boyfriends/husbands of the other bridesmaids have plans to grab lunch a little later. We have to beg the kind hotel guests to help us get to the 10th floor because the elevators require a keycard for use, but finally make it to the bridal suite. The beautiful bride has ordered a full breakfast spread of quiche, pastries, coffee, juice and champagne, and the hair and makeup artists are all set to go. We take turns getting ready, eating, oo-ing and ah-ing at the bride for the next several hours. The bride has kindly gifted us these services as a thank-you for traveling, so no cost here. 

12:30pm: The groom has called approximately 30 times in the last 3 hours, driving all of us a little bit crazy (except the bride). The photographer is apparently at the church instead of the hotel, and is 2 hours early for pictures. Does this mean he will leave the ceremony 2 hours early because his time will be up? Should we take getting ready pictures? Is he just scoping out the space? This and many other questions are each their own individual phone call and frankly I am getting second-hand stress from all of this. Unfortunately neither the bride nor the groom are particularly good delegators so have decided to personally manage this fiasco. There is also a minor panic when the  bride realizes that the coat rack she requested from the hotel has not arrived in the room for pictures. That feels like a problem I can solve so I go downstairs to talk to the Front Desk about a coat rack, and do the whole “I promise I’m not robbing anyone just need to get to my friend’s room on the 10th so please swipe me onto the elevator” thing. 

I also realize somewhere in this mess that I do not have my dress or shoes or accessories with me and have to run back to my hotel to get them (thankfully it’s just a couple blocks away). I call my husband, who is an absolute gem but gets lost somewhere around “the sticky boobs which are in a white case in the purple makeup bag in the second pocket of my suitcase on the left, past the silver shoes” and when I have to start guiding him through where 3 different pieces of jewelry are located I decide to just bite the bullet and head back to the hotel myself. I meet him walking to the bride’s hotel with about half the things I needed after a solid effort, so we walk back together laughing the whole way and spilling the day’s tea. It’s also his brother’s birthday today so we call him for a couple minutes from the hotel. Honestly, it was such a gorgeous day, I enjoyed the break getting to walk outside. 

2pm: After coming back to the hotel and getting dressed the photographer starts taking some pictures. A pro tip to everyone who is getting married in the near future - your photographer needs to be an alpha. A very polite and kind photographer might be the human you want to hang out with, but it is definitely not the human you want running the show the day of your wedding. We hem and haw *a lot* \- where should we go? What pictures should we take? Do we need the bouquets now? Should we go to the church or go take pictures outside? Veil or no veil? Pictures with mom now or later? Woof. Also my heels are killing me, but we do get a lot of love from everyone who sees us on the street, and our beautiful bride gets so many compliments - she really looks like a princess <3 . 

4pm: Wedding time! It is all beautiful - the string quartet, the poetry, the vows. You can tell they love each other so much. 

5pm: PARTY TIME! I change out of my demonic heels and into sneakers that very conveniently are hidden by my long dress. We enjoy appetizers and more string quartet at the cocktail hour and make friends with all of the waiters and waitresses passing around the appetizers. The bride and groom make their entrance around 6pm and then we all head up to a different floor of the venue for the reception. Speeches are from the groom’s father and the bride’s brother, and from one of the bride’s childhood friends who was not asked to be a bridesmaid to keep the numbers even. I had the filet mignon for dinner and the cake was an incredible dark chocolate torte that I would fly back there to eat again. We dance and chat and take pictures until 11 when the party ends and we say goodbye to the new Mr. and Mrs. We are pretty close to the hotel and its a gorgeous night so we walk back. 

**Day total:** $45 (including my husband’s lunch with the boyfriends/husbands at some point during the day) 

**Weekly total:** $411.28 

**Reflections:** Honestly I expected to spend more at the wedding and had budgeted about $400 for food and transportation. I think the fact that didn’t happen was just because all the time was taken by the wedding so there wasn’t a ton of opportunity to spend money. Also had a very small grocery shop this week because we were going to be going out of town, usually I spend closer to $200 on groceries so that was lower than normal.

I used to work as a barista at coffee shops on a University campus in Washington. My manager left and I thought I was going to be promoted but then they brought in some man from the outside who claimed to have worked at a university in texas managing the coffee shops on campus. 

But this man - once he started working - he had no idea what he was doing. He didn't know the most basic things about how to run a coffee shop, he didn't even know how to make espresso drinks! All he knew how to do was micromanage and be a jerk. 

I eventually quit because of him and I always wondered how he got away with lying about his experience, and if it is actually legal.

1owd1gn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1owd1gn,My Japan Denim Trip Haul and Detailed Shopping Experience,"Hello fellow denim enthusiasts! I just got back from my 8 day denim excursion in Japan (10/29-11/5) and I'm excited to share my detailed experience with the individual brands and shops I visited. Obviously this wasn't just a denim trip, and my wife and I did all sorts of things, but my shopping during this trip was mostly focused on Japanese denim and made in Japan heritage inspired clothing, accessories, and footwear so here is what I have to share with you all. I don't typically contribute to this sub much, but a
problem I have ran into many times on this sub was not being able to find information on certain brands, cuts, shops and things that pertain to my interests so here is my attempt at providing information on the brands I engage with the most, and ones that I feel deserve some spotlight.

For reference, I am 5'10"", weigh 165 LBS, typically wear a 30 or 31 in most brands of jeans but I know my measurements like the back of my hand and use that to determine what size I need. Very important if you are to order anything online like I have had to do for the past year. Warning, this is a long and detailed post so there will be a lot of reading. I tried not to take too many pictures while I was in the shops as to not be that guy and disrupt the shop experience so I will be describing things as I find them worth describing. Hopefully someone finds this post useful and helps people in finding information on certain brands that I wasn't able to. I'm more than happy to provide any more detail people want on the shops or if there are any questions I can answer. On to the post!

**A few things people will probably want to know:** 

1) 95% of shops had people that could communicate in English at least enough to assist you, so language was no barrier. If in doubt, use google translate. 

2) Most stores stock sizes up to 38 or 40 in jeans. I have a very common size in Japan of 30 or 31, and had more of an issue with that than seeing things in larger sizes. If anything, the jackets and shirts may be an issue for those who wear a larger size since those are usually shorter in the body and sleeves. 

3) Most stores have an onsite hemming service and were able to hem a pair of jeans for my wife in 10 min. Take advantage of this if you want, but keep in mind that depending on the fabric, it may shrink to a degree you aren't happy with.


**Here was my mission:**

Find a pair of Jeans that were perfectly straight from knee to hem (no taper whatsoever), a pair of raw or one wash bootcut jeans, a pair of white/ecru straight fit jeans, and a pair of Japanese made boots or derbies. These were the things I was focused on so the stores I visited, I was visiting with the intention of finding at least one of these items. I also had a long list of certain brands, shops, and cuts of jeans to try that met the criteria and anything else that I managed to find on accident was a bonus, be it a shop I discovered while there, or a piece that caught my eye in person. This helped give some structure to my shopping and know what shops to hit while we were in certain parts to make things more efficient without making the trip and shopping experience feel like a chore. 



**TOKYO PT. 1:** 

We started and stayed in Tokyo for only one one full day before leaving for Osaka and Okayama for 4 days, so I mostly hit stores in Omotesando/Harajuku area. We finished in Tokyo for the last few days of our trip, so I'll have two sections for Tokyo.

**Fullcount Omotesando**- Small shop, store with high stacks of denim everywhere and wide selection of quality Shirts, Over shirts, and Jackets. I was looking to specifically try their 1120W- Bootcut jeans and I was on the hunt for some white/ecru straight fit jeans. They had the 1101EC- Straight ecru jeans (just what I was looking for) but not in my size so I only tried the 1120W Bootcuts. Leg opening and inseam were exactly what I wanted which is something I didn't have to cuff and had a noticeable but not crazy ""flare"", but the thighs and back rise were much too small. A trend with bootcut fits I was finding constantly throughout my trip. Later in my trip I ended up really wanting a raw type 3 denim jacket and saw they sell them so I came back, but the type 3 and their jackets in general were longer in the body than what I was looking for. They also only offer one-washed garments in the store. Unfortunately their fits were just barely not the right measurements for my body type/style preference. I would probably try them again for lighter weight tops.

**Edwin Concept Shop Harajuku**- This one surprised me. They were right across from Fullcount as you exit so I decided to see if they had the ED-47 cut in store. Another piece I was looking for was a straight fit jean which was COMPLETELY straight from knee to hem (so same knee measurement and hem measurement) and saw a post on here from sometime ago that said the ED-47 was exactly that. Most Straight cuts taper from knee to hem at least half an inch, so jeans with these specifications are incredibly hard to find in my experience. The bottom floor has all their fashion forward and concept pieces but when I asked for the ED-47 cut the shop employees led me upstairs. I was assisted by a young gal from somewhere in Europe which was really rare for you to see in any shops there, but she spoke fluent English and my wife and I speak little Japanese so it ended up working perfectly. She let me know that the ED-47 is a Edwin Europe exclusive but they made a straight cut that is similar named EDS No. 47 Regular Straight. They are made in Japan from a Japanese cotton and feature the rainbow selvedge ID which is unmistakably Edwin, and Herringbone fabric for the pocket lining. I tried on a 30 at first since she said the were more of a European fit and ran bigger and my goodness they were huge on me. I noticed they did have a slight taper to them but I was really digging the fabric and details of the jeans so I tried the 29 and they fit perfect! They apparently only sell them at the Edwin Concept Shop locations and I loved the details, so these were my first purchase of the trip even though they weren't exactly what I was initially looking for. Especially for the price which was a bit under $150 USD in Yen, I was really happy with these. I wore them once in the rain while there and they faded like crazy on the side that I was carrying my tote bag. Really excited for how these are going to turn out. They’re similar in fit to my LVC 1954Z were although the Edwin are a little roomier in the top block.

**Studio D'artisan M'arijuan Tokyo**- This was the shop that started it all for me in my first trip to Japan last year in October. We actually stumbled upon it accidentally and my wife pointed out the shop and wanted to go in to look so I have her to thank for me falling down the Japanese Denim and American heritage rabbit hole. I didn't end up purchasing from this shop this time since I spend so much time looking at their website and the pieces on there, I kind of ruined seeing them in person. Lesson learned. I was also going to visit the Osaka SDA shop and wanted to save some of my appetite for that, knowing I would be finishing the trip in Tokyo and could come back. The sizing on the pieces I did like were a bit limited as well but ultimately didn't fill any gaps in my wardrobe. I was however,  eyeballing a Hunting Jacket from their sister brand Orgueil (still eyeballing it). In person it had a beautiful warm brownish red color come through that doesn't pick up on the pics they use on their online shop. 

**Levi's Harajuku**- This was another revisit for me. The store is huge (well,  mostly tall) and carries their Levi's Vintage Clothing line. They also have plenty of the Blue Tab pieces here. While I love the pieces I have from that line, I can get them back home in my local Levi's store which I can't say about LVC. In Kyoto last year I purchased my first LVC piece in the 1954Z 501s which they hemmed same day for me. This was awesome except for 10 months later when I soaked them for the first time and they became too short and too slim for my current tastes. Another lesson learned. This time I was looking for the 1944 501 specifically because on the website it says the knee and hem measurement are the same. Perfect, I thought. I'll get them when I go back to Japan for the Made in Japan version. This proved to be the hardest thing in the world because they are sold out everywhere over here and it doesn't look they they are still making them at least for the Japanese market. They had plenty of 1890, 1933, 1947, 1954Z, and 1955 501s but I was fixated on the 1944. I revisited them later in the trip again when I started looking for a Raw type 3 but they only had Type 1/2 and the 1879 pleated blouse jacket.

**Real McCoy's**- Visited both their shops in Tokyo and in Osaka. I took home a Suede jacket last year that I love but I was mostly interested in denim and boots on this visit. Shops are crazy cool on the inside and their reproduction of military and heritage styles are impeccable and faithful. My wife tried on a pair of cinch back jeans from them since that was her main goal this trip shopping wise, but ultimately they fit her in a weird way since they were Men's jeans. Would 100% get another leather jacket from them but not exactly what I was looking for on this trip and their denim and boots didn't quite resonate with me. If you're looking for military bombers, fatigues, etc. and are willing to pay the premium then look no further.

**RRL Omotesando**- Gorgeous store. Admired from afar on my trip last year but I went inside this time and they just make it so easy for you to buy into the whole look and lifestyle. Didn't purchase anything since prices were similar to the States but I'm a sucker for RRL and had to check it out. You can go to Ralphs Coffee cafe that they have attached to the store while you're there too!
    



**OSAKA**: Unfortunately I didn't get to visit many stores in this area since some of them are pretty spread out and not as easy to get to as in Tokyo such as Samurai, Kapital, UES etc. We were having a lot of fun popping in and out of vintage stores in the Americamura area and enjoying the Halloween festivities in Dotonburi. I was able to go to the one store that I really wanted to in SDA.

**SDA Osaka**- This was one of the shops I was most excited to visit due to SDA being my favorite denim maker, and the whole ""Aura"" of the Osaka 5 that I find very appealing. By this time in my trip I hadn't found the perfect straight leg jean that I set out to find, but I was determined to give the SD-103 Tight straight a try. In name it suggests that it will be a slimmer cut, but upon looking at the measurements online, it is much more akin to a classic straight leg jean or 501. I tried a Size 31 first since I have a 31 in SD-801 regular straight that stretched out to be a little big in the waist and was surprised when they were quite snug and I couldn't really sit down in them. Luckily the 32 fit me in every way. The rise, thighs, waist, even the knee to hem measurement were nearly perfect and the exact look I was going for. Upon measuring later, the knee is less than 1/4"" bigger than the hem which I figured was going to be as close as I was going to get. I spotted a red leather belt that they happened to have my size in but didn't end up picking up at first. I kept thinking about it and that's when I knew I had to go back for it. The employees were very friendly and were talking baseball with me since I was wearing my Mariners cap and we are both Ichiro fans. It felt right to purchase what I consider to be my best fitting pair of jeans in the city that they were born in. 

**Hinoya Osaka**- This was located in a shopping mall right across from where we were staying and very near the Namba Train Station. A much more condensed version of what we would experience later on in our trip in Ueno after coming back to Tokyo. Didn't have any of the things I was looking for (LVC, Bootcut from Burgus Plus, Whitesville Tees) so we didn't spend much time here. Decent selection but they're confined to a small shop in a shopping mall.




**OKAYAMA (KURASHIKI, and KOJIMA)**: What's a Denim Trip without visiting Jeans Street? We were staying in Kurashiki which has its own small Jeans street in the Bikan Historical District with tons of denim/indigo products and yes, jeans! We were saving ourselves for the famous Kojima Jeans Street and didn't end up purchasing at any of the shops but our favorite was the Denim Bar which is home to Graph Zero. They carry some Samurai as well.

**Kojima Jeans Street**: This place has been covered pretty thoroughly on here so I'll just be giving my experience on the shops and not necessarily the whole of Jeans Street itself.

**Momotaro**- We ended up skipping Japan Blue Jeans since I never really cared much about them or Momotaro but we did end up going in to Momotaro to check it out and boy was I wrong about them. I think because they're so popular I tend to dismiss Momotaro and I considered them overhyped, but I have to admit that their denim made from Zimbabwean cotton is a fabric unlike any other. Design and cut wise it still didn't do anything for me, but I absolutely loved the hand feel of their product which weighs very heavily on my made up, imaginary rating scale. Their denim has a very luxurious silky feel that is captivating to touch and almost precious feeling which is so different from what you usually get from a hardwearing fabric. I may give them a shot in the future but they were one of our first stops in Jeans Street, and I had already purchased 2 pairs of jeans at this point of the trip so I was telling myself I was done. They do made to measure denim suits that looked and felt incredible so maybe that's what I'll eventually come back for.

**Omoto Denim**- I was intrigued about this brand since I seen Alejandro Jomar's YT video covering it and went to check it out. The shop was actually quite large compared to some of the other ones on the street and the jeans themselves were of fantastic make. Again, I wasn't really looking for anymore jeans unless something wowed me and their pieces were very similar to ones I already had back home in terms of fit, fabric, color etc. There were great resources in store that explained the three fits they have and the shop employees (one being Kishimoto-san himself I believe) came over to ask if we needed any help and to explain some of the product. Nothing against Omoto Denim, our experience browsing was fantastic and they seemed very eager to help but ultimately I needed to be selective on what I purchased regarding my suitcase space and did not purchase from this shop. 

**Kojima Genes**- Came to try on their bootcut in particular and encountered the same thing. Too slim in the thighs, too low on the rise. Even tried sizing up to a 33 which I have never worn in Japanese sizing or otherwise and still it was too tight. Fabric seemed nice and they had some really interesting heavy weight 23 oz. jeans but nothing else that I was looking for.

**Blue Trick**- Not really a ""Jeans"" store in the traditional sense but they carry tons of denim product and other Jeans adjacent pieces. We walked by them on the way to the start of Jeans Street on the map which is by PBJ/Momotaro, and I noticed a shop employee wearing this patchwork button shirt. I knew I wanted to come back to see it since it was so eye catching and ended up loving it as a nice statement piece. I really like the two pockets on this shirt, it looks great with denim, and all the colors work in my wardrobe so it was an easy yes!

**One of One**- This shop is where my wife and I had the best shopping experience in Japan. We were looking to bring her mom back a denim jacket and this shop caught our eyes with their more relaxed vibe and silhouettes which is perfect for her mom. They are not on Google Maps or the Jeans Street Map so you can miss them, but Murakami-san was so incredibly warm and welcoming, even more so than people in Kojima seemed to be. He explained how his shop came to be and the opportunity that allowed him to create his own pieces and how he prefers to make clothing that allows ease of movement and places an emphasis on comfort. The name One of One comes from the denim pieces taking on their own form unique to how you wear them, becoming one of one pieces for each person and how no two pieces will come to live the same life. I could sense the passion for what he does in his words, and I love that he was doing something truly unique and different from making repro pieces based on existing garments. Murakami-san makes all the pieces himself in Okayama in very limited runs and they're composed of a Texas cotton/Zimbabwean cotton blend that has amazing hand feel and perfect stitching. Unfortunately I don't have any pics of the jacket since we gave it to her as soon as she picked us up from the airport. I was only able to find them online by typing in “One of One Denim Kojima” on Instagram so they’re a little tricky to find on google. Make sure to pay Murakami-san and One of One a visit if you want an amazing in store experience!

**Denim Bar/GraphZero Kojima**- Alas we found a pair of cinch back jeans for my wife that she liked! I tried getting her in to the SDA D-01s but she wanted a more textured pair, and wanted green cast so we were struggling with finding her jeans. I had honestly never given Graph Zero much thought since I don't like too much slub or nep which they seem to specialize in, but they had some great feeling fabrics and cuts. There was someone wearing a Herringbone denim Canadian tuxedo on Jeans Street that day that was faded beautifully with an orange tab on the back pocket, and I was going crazy trying to find who makes them. Sure enough within the next hour we stumble in to Denim bar and there they were on the shelves! She ended up with their 15oz Slub Yarn Heritage Jeans that have a light brown colored weft from recycled cotton and are incredibly slubby but done very tastefully. There's already so much vibrant blue peaking through from the few times she's worn them that I almost want a pair too! I think they're still a little but too ambitious for me, but I really enjoy how unique their pieces are and how good they look with wear. Very likely a brand I'll be purchasing from for myself in the future.

**Kapital**- I visited their tiny location in Ginza last year and wasn't impressed so I had kind of written them off. I decided to give them another shot while I was here and visit the location in Kojima, only 15 mins away walking from Jeans Street. The shop's interior is incredible and is a hybrid book store. Every shop in Japan has a very curated look that tells you the lifestyle of the brand you're engaging with, but this was amongst the best in my opinion. I was looking to try their flare jeans and I'm sure you could guess what the problem with the fit was for me at this point. I ended up really loving their knitwear and jackets that have a heritage inspired look mixed with some RRL gone street. No Boro jackets, no Century denim, just beautifully made pieces with some of the best hand feel and color palettes. I would have purchased a few pieces from here if there were available sizes, but many pieces were last in size and too big. Glad I gave them another shot and I'll likely purchase from them in the future.



**TOKYO PT. 2:**

**Bears Tokyo**- I was saving this shop for when we were going to visit Shimokitazawa for vintage shopping since it's in the same area. The shop is very small and cramped since it's basically arranged like a backstock room full of denim but in a cool way (is there a not cool way?). Everything is labeled so you can see the brand, fit, etc. Just shelves and racks packed to the brim with denim all around you. What's not to love? The two shop employees there were incredibly nice and helpful and did everything they could to help me find what I was looking for. They had LVC and a place on a rack that said 1944 501 but unfortunately there was zero stock. They had had LVC 1961 Type 3 Raw denim jackets (and 30% off in the store too!) but I was between the sizes they had in stock. They had the Ecru Fullcount jeans in my size but the thighs ended up being too slim. I felt bad since I really wanted to buy something since the experience was amazing, but I didn't want to force it and had limited suitcase space. I will definitely be going back and highly recommend the shop, especially since it's so close to Shimokitazawa.

**Tools infinity Omotesando**- I had never heard of this store until I started doing some research on Japanese made boots and their shop popped up. They carry an array of brands like TCB, Stevenson, Sugar Cane, LVC and more. I was actually about to leave after not finding what I was looking for when I saw they had a bin of Whitesville T-shirts that I had heard so much about. The shop employee let me try one of the Tees on in size M and it was the perfect fit. Similar in fit to my Buck Mason Toughknit Classic Tees and softer/thinner but like $20 USD less for 2 Tees! Came out to about $45 USD in yen after Tax-Free and wore one the very next day. Loved it so much I went back that day and bought another pack. The shop employee (owner?) was incredibly nice and gave my wife and I some stickers from his friends Youtube channel I believe. I've worn the Tees a few times already since then and I 100% recommend them to those that want that ""Jeremy Allen White in the Bear"" look from a t-shirt (I believe it's actually one of the Tees he wears in the show) or just a nice Tee that's made in Japan. Half the price in Japan as well. I am wearing one of these Tees in the pictures provided.

**45r Ginza**- Another revisit. This might have been the brand besides SDA that I was most excited to visit again since their prices for international buyers are basically double if you order online. I purchased a piece from them last year and in terms of fabrics, hand feel, washing and dyeing techniques, and overall craftsmanship, they stand alone at the top for me. Their jeans are crazy expensive even when buying in Japan. Many of their jeans ran upwards of $500 USD in Yen so I was not willing to part with that much money for a pair of jeans. I did however get this denim shirt that caught my attention when we walked in the doors that was styled beautifully on the mannequin in the window. At first glance it appears to be just a western denim shirt (I mean, it still is lol), but the pop of turquoise used only on a single button got me to look the garment closer to reveal impeccable craftsmanship and small details throughout that tickle my brain as I think about them while wearing the piece. The wash is beautiful and 
slightly slubby which I feel is uncommon in denim shirts. When you flip the cuff it reveals a different, slightly ribbed texture in the same washed denim and blue chain stitching only seen on the inside of the garment and when you roll the sleeves. It wouldn't be complete without 45r's signature handstitched ""R"" logo on the back to finish the garment. I guess this technically isn't a raw denim piece but I feel it has a place in this post. 45r (also called 45rpm) could also use more love in general so here you go reddit and google search results. I opted for a size 4 in this which is basically a Japanese XL I believe, since I was going for a more relaxed look.



**UENO**: This needs a whole different section for it in my opinion. The amount of real estate Hinoya and Americaya take up on one of the streets in Ueno is insane. For those who have visited you'll know what I mean but, I'll do my best to paint a picture for those who have not.

**Hinoya Ueno**- My first stop in Ueno. I was still looking for LVC and a bootcut jean at this point of my trip which was coming to its end, but I only had room for one of them in my suitcase. The 1961 Type 3 was my first priority, then 1944 501, then bootcut jean in that order. We hop in to Hinoya and are met with tons of familiar brands. Samurai, Sugarcane, TCB, Burgus Plus, and more. I don't see any LVC so I ask one of the many shop employees and he says go down the street and there is Levi's LVC. I had noted on the map earlier that there was a Levi's just down the same street so I figured he was pointing me towards that and left the shop. I notice the next store over is also a Hinoya and walk in there and poke around a bit but don't find anything I'm looking for. I notice that the next store over is Hinoya as well and realize that this whole street is basically just lined with Hinoya shops that also have upstairs sections and are stuffed with Denim and heritage wear. It was magnificent. We were there after dark so it felt like a night street market for just jeans! Turns out they have some LVC but not the models I'm looking for so no purchases from Hinoya for me.

**Americaya**- I honestly thought that this was ANOTHER Hinoya at first since it is right at the end of where the Hinoya shops end, and they had similar aesthetics. This shop ran the other way and you would walk through it, past a street/backalley that cuts the store in half, into the next part of the store and ultimately on to the next major street over. It also had an upstairs that was almost maze like and that's where I finally found the LVC Type 3 in my size, or so I thought... It was a bit big on me but the shop employee assisting me told me it would shrink to where I would want it to be. Made sense to me since my 1954Z 501s shrank considerably and the jacket is in an unwashed state so I purchased it. I looked at some reviews of the Jacket once I got back state side on the Japanese part of YT (since apparently no one on reddit or English speaking YT owns this jacket) and found out that the jacket doesn't shrink basically at all! It's not a bad fit but it definitely wasn't the fit I had in mind since I wanted something cut a little slimmer, but I can make it work. As you can see in the pictures, I'm rolling one of the sleeves to my preferred length since the sleeves are quite long. I'm also cinching the jacket tighter on the back buttons to give a more desired, tapered, V-shaped silhouette you would expect from a Type 3. The back length is perfect, but it is about 2"" too long in the front since I like my jackets cut around the belt line/waist. The pictures actually make it look like a much better fit than it really is, but trust me I'm swimming in it a bit and I guess it isn't expected to shrink much. 

(Update on this, I threw it in a hot wash and it actually did shrink just enough to be the fit I wanted. Will make a separate review on this jacket after some wear.)

**Levi's Ueno**- So, I know where I'll being going for LVC first next time. This was the last place we visited in Ueno after having spent a ton of time in the 50 Hinoya stores and the Americaya. The first thing I see when I walk in is the LVC 1961 type 3 in the size I had just purchased, hanging on the wall on full display. I then discover they had exactly ONE pair of 1944 501s in my Levi's true to size of 30. This was the only pair in the store that was bound by several intertwining pieces of plastic, locking it on to the fixture it was displayed on. How fitting. Unfortunately, fit was the problem with these as they were slightly snug in the waist and thighs and they would only get smaller with a wash. The knee to hem was exactly what I was wanting out of the 1944s but this particular pair was just not meant to be mine, at least on this trip. The shop employee got me to try on another pair of LVC 501s, I think the 1947 cut, but I was so fixated on the 1944 that I didn't end up purchasing from this store. Noted for next time though.

**Intended use:**  Travel, coffee shops, and listening around the house.

**Music genre:**  Metal, rock, indie, hip hop.

**Past gear:**  Sennheiser Momentum from 2015.  Sony WH-CH710N, and Airpods

Long story short I would like a more immersive headphone for music.  My understanding is that wireless will always be lower quality compared to wired in the same price point, but I would really like the flexibility of wireless.  If there's an option to do wireless with wired for higher quality that would be cool too.  I don't have the best understanding of headphones and currently don't have the bandwidth to deep dive before making a decision.  Thanks for any advice.",1,1763068004.0,HeadphoneAdvice,1,1.0,False
1owczgz,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1owczgz/e_my_lighthouse/,"E, my lighthouse","My life is filled with synchronicities, precognitive dreams and visions. It started when I was a child and came back to me later as an adult, it’s opened me up to spirituality in a way that I may not have derived on my own. I can totally understand skeptics because I was one before the birth of my daughter, that opened me up to spirituality more than ever.

I’ll never forget having a vision of you and I as seniors snuggling in robes over coffee, I can’t shake it. I can tell myself that I’m done with all of this, but I can’t shake that feeling off altogether: the one of incompletion, the one that tells me that there could be so much more to this story. It’s never happened to me with anyone else, not even A.

I did reach out to my mom, who is more religious than spiritual, to ask her guidance on if the sign I received “was enough”-as it wasn’t a physical manifestation but an uncommon mention of one. She agreed and wished me well that the I would receive what I was hoping for. 

If it wasn’t for such a direct message from you I may have been emboldened by the sign to strike up some small talk and to wish you well on finding what we both know you’re searching for. I did wholeheartedly believe that an opening for me to communicate with you would arrive though; Jen has absolutely top notch intuition. It meant a lot for me to hear from her that our compatibility would be equally matched.

What made me reach out? That I can’t seem to just let go fully.
What was I hoping for? To have some catharsis from these feelings that we both seem to be carrying with us. Although I knew that it was clear that I would receive further communication from you, and that I should write something back in return, I also knew that there was a massive chance that you not see it at all. Just putting it out there felt good, expectations of you ever seeing it aside.

Further musings:

It’s funny that you should say that our circumstances kept me from seeing all of you, when all I can ever think of is that I wish you could see yourself the way that I do. You are a wonderful person and even better lover. You are not broken, you are a beautiful mosaic of love.

The first night we met I was taken aback by the feeling of home and family that takes up your apartment: I had never encountered such a feeling in a partners space before. Perhaps this should have been my first red flag that I could not have left this encounter without leaving a piece of my heart and soul with you.

I’d be lying if I didn’t say that sometimes I would enjoy the thought that those 9 months would culminate in the biggest change of my life, a worthwhile reason for change, shifting my life around seems like the most selfish thing that I could do. (Like Jen said “you have hesistancy, like who would do something like that?”) I have to give my children all of me. 

Underneath it all, I was open to it from the very beginning: a stranger so intent on changing my life forever, it felt like if it’s meant to be it’s meant to be. I took comfort trusting that you would move mountains for your own and knowing that I was leaving it up to Him to decide my fate. It may have been lying underneath my actions more than I realized but I wanted it to be. The only thing that made it scary at the time was not being fully open to you. We both had our own personal battles to overcome during that time.

I will always and forever be your wishing ball, the one to show you the light that everything you desire will one day be yours. You are not too little and what you desire is not too much.

He has these grand ideas of doing things. Asks the chat for ideas or suggestions (which he doesn’t listen too) and then ends up doing something completely different. 
His whole idea today was to do good deeds for people / spread kindness
Lots of people suggested food - gift cards for coffee shops - etc 
he reads them ignores them and says no it could be as simple as a conversation 
People in his chat are calling him cheap because he said he refuses to give cash. With that I do believe is fair if it’s too the wrong person. Cash is king and can help a lot of people in this time.  
He needs to better organize and think before he executes these ideas because he does have a chat of 1000 people and doesn’t listen to anyone.

I know what I am doing is wrong and I feel awful. I know the risks.

So I struggle with PCOS, Polycystic ovarian syndrome. I had done some research on treatments I could do to manage my symptoms. Very irregular periods, hair loss, male patterned hair growth, cystic ovaries, exhaustion, lethargy, weight gain and difficulty losing it. 

My research lead me to metformin, a diabetes medication. It’s been shown to help with the symptoms of PCOS. My doctor denied me treatment as he said he would only prescribe me if I was diabetic or looking to get pregnant. I eventually do want kids, however, I also wanted to manage my symptoms. I went back to him and told him I am ready to start a family and want to go through with metformin. 3 months in I was so sick. Always vomiting, always having diarrhea. This was a lower dosage too. I can’t remember but it wasn’t the usual dosage diabetics start off with.

I stopped taking it. I felt defeated. I didn’t feel a change in my symptoms and my doctor had said it would take 6mo to notice change. I was so sick by month 3 I didn’t want to go through with the sickness anymore.

Then I learned that there’s growing studies that semaglutide, also a diabetic drug, helps with PCOS too. My doctor wouldn’t prescribe it to me because he doesn’t prescribe it for PCOS, only metformin. He wouldn’t even prescribe it for weight loss, and recommended I do intermittent fasting. However that does not work for me as I have a binge eating disorder. I understand he is trying alternative avenues of weight loss but I don’t think he understands that I have tried everything. I exercise and struggle. Increased cortisol levels effects your PCOS so it’s an endless cycle of staying fat. What I find works for me is swimming and Pilates. It’s nice, but hard to go swimming all the time which is preferred.

So I went through an online weight loss program that sends you semaglutide online. I was approved by a nurse practitioner and have been on it for some time now.

Within the first two weeks, I got my first period in almost a year. I thought maybe it was just time. Then I had another period the next month. Then the next. That was a sign to me that it was working! I was so happy (period L’s suck though) that I had some normalcy. On top of that, my period wasn’t as brutal as it usually is.

The downside though is you get super constipated with semaglutide because your digestive system is slowed down significantly. I take magnesium citrate every night, I take Metamucil and sometimes I am still so very constipated. I don’t wanna overdo it on laxatives because I don’t want to make it worse.

My boyfriend used to vape and it would always make him go to the bathroom. When he quit, he was constipated a few times. I looked into it and apparently nicotine can trigger bowel movements. I vape in secret, but I only take a few puffs a couple times a day to see if I’ll go. It really works and it’s like when you take a sip of your coffee and have to go right away.

I’ll put it away for the rest of the day and forget about it. I’ve forgotten about it and have gone days without it and find there’s no change in my mood from withdrawal that I notice in others who quit smoking/vaping. I feel so guilty that I do this, but I find it is making me poop more regularly than taking laxatives ontop of my fiber intake.

It’s fucking insane, I know. ",17,1763067626.0,confession,43,0.74,False

I am so tired of how expensive everything is, and how quickly things add up. I’m a stay at home parent and we share all accounts. I get a weekly allowance that’s the same as what my husband gets - $250 every 2 weeks to spend on stuff that’s not bills, groceries, or stuff for the kids.

The problem is that life gets busy and I end up having to spend some of my budget on the kids sometimes, because I feel like the kids budget for eating out is too small. For example if we are out and about before school about once a week I’ll do a drive through to get them each a breakfast sandwich and myself a coffee. I have a night to myself once a week and try to leave as soon as my husband gets home, since the kids are less likely to scream and try to get me to stay home if I leave while they’re having dinner, so I end up doing fast food after my workout or meeting a friend for dinner at a medium-nice place. Where I live this is just so expensive! One drink and dinner at a mid level place is like $50 after tip. It’s crazy! Also whenever my kids have a birthday party to go to I end up using $20 from my budget since my husband has said the kids are over budget too.

Anyway I routinely overspend and it’s been adding up to the point where I’m now $200 short and can’t seem to catch up. It’s a lot like how I used to feel when I was single and doing all my expenses for myself and ended up in some credit card debt because my capacity to absentmindedly spend regardless of what I actually have is just enormous.

I don’t understand it. I never get my nails or hair done, I rarely buy clothes and all of mine are hand me downs. When I do go out to eat it’s nothing extravagant. How does stuff add up so quickly?

I recently did one of the 100+ biomarker blood tests back in September with eye-opening results. I worked out regularly, drank 10-12 cups of water daily, and always got 7-8 hours of sleep per night....but my diet was trash. A lot of fast food, ultra-processed foods, inflammatory foods, sugary items, and low in fruits and veggies. My blood tests showed extremely high levels of CRP (inflammation), low testosterone, extremely low levels of DHEA-S, terrible cholesterol scores, etc.

Since then, I have begun a supplement regime (Omega-3's, magnesium, creatine, etc) and completely turned around my diet. I have cut out virtually all sweets, zero fast food, zero ultra-processed foods. I am eating 3-5 cups of veggies and .5-1 cups of berries daily, with different varieties of nuts. I consume 100-120 g of protein (including salmon and chicken, very little red meat) and am eating around 1500 calories per day. I still work out daily but have added heavy weights as well. I continue to drink 10-13 cups of water daily and am sleeping well.

I've even cut my coffee down to twice a week. Herein lies the problem. I pair my coffee with an inflammatory coffee creamer. Over the past few months I have tried SO MANY different clean creamers and I cannot enjoy them. My twice-coffee weekly is my happy place, and ChatGPT said I needed to knock off the inflammatory creamer. However, with all that I've cleaned up with my diet, will drinking the inflammatory creamer twice a week still cause my high CRP/inflammatory blood levels?

I don’t know what to think.,"I recently started a lawyer intern and admin job. Everyone I work with has been great so far except for one coworker who has started acting strangely.

For the first couple of months, we barely spoke and everything was fine. One evening, before I finished for the day, I decided to wash all the dishes in the staff kitchen and leave the place clean. As I was finishing, she walked in and her whole expression changed straight away. She told me she likes doing the dishes and that I should leave them for her. I thought it was an odd thing to say, but I didn’t want to make it awkward, so I figured maybe it was part of her routine to wind down at the end of the day, or she was a germaphobe and liked the dishes washed a certain way?

The next week going forward, I left the dishes. I assumed doing the dishes (cups, plates and cutlery) would be a thing that everyone on the team would do. I asked a different coworker about this and she said she brings her own dishes and washes them herself, so she’s never used or washed the communal dishes. 

Then our boss sent a message in the group chat saying we needed to stop leaving dirty dishes at the end of the day. I felt this was aimed at me as I am an intern and do the odd coffee runs when asked. I explained what had happened and said that one of my colleagues told me to leave them because she liked doing them. My boss spoke to her and apparently she said I made it all up.

So I went back to doing the dishes every night.

A little while later, I was on a late shift with just her. She told me again that she wanted to do the dishes that night. I asked her if she was sure and she said yes. When I left after her to lock up, I checked and the dishes were still sitting there.

I genuinely don’t know what she wants or why she keeps doing this. It feels like a trap but it also feels too silly to bring up again. Do I just ignore her and keep doing the kitchen cleanup, or should I say something to my boss so I don’t get blamed for dishes being left again?

why/how?

# riddle me this batman:

what does it say that my level of tism is so grounded and logic-based that i am incapable of having delusions or hallucinations, even when i experienced the psychoactive effects of shrooms?

> \#aka my sense of logic and reason is so strong that it counteracts the psychosis/delusions/hallucinations that are known in schizophrenic patients

seriously, i'm so much of a lucid dreamer that in each of my dreams i know i am dreaming

anyone else got the tism like this?

I currently have strep but am on antibiotics. Not sure if that’s related but yesterday evening I started getting that pain and took Famotidine. 

Today I was working at my desk and took a few sips of tea and then it happened again. That bad chest pain. It is like a pressure and uncontrollable. It’s so bad I cannot do anything. It hurts to stand, lay, walk, sit.

Then the sweating happened. I ran and took famotidine and gaviscon. Took deep breaths and drank water. The pain was still there and I was extremely uncomfortable. Then my stomach started getting bloated. I called an ambulance and now I’m at the ER. But the gaviscon or famotidine kicked and and the pain has went down a lot but I still feel it.

1owcja1,https://i.redd.it/mskz9wq3731g1.jpeg,Looking for “You Wanna Play？Then Game is On” novel,"Chapter 1
 In my previous life, at my husband's birthday party, his best friend said that she knew how big he was at every stage of his life.
 My face went livid with rage, but my husband, Simeon Goldberg, just laughed it off, saying he and that girl, Sabrina Hayes, were simply so close they even used the bathroom together.
 I slapped them both and asked for a divorce on the spot.
 Simeon snapped that I was overreacting and demanded I apologize to Sabrina.
 I broke down crying, ran out, got hit by a car, and died.
 Afterward, Simeon went half-mad with grief and dragged Sabrina through hell with him.
 Meanwhile, I spent my afterlife filing complaints about how unfairly I'd died. They made the mistake, so why was I the one paying in blood and tears?
 Eventually, the King of Hell got sick of it and waved me off.
 ""Clearly, you haven't suffered enough. Go back, rack up 100 Heartbreak Points, and I'll consider letting you live again.""
 Next thing I knew, I was back at a party, arm in arm with my best friend, Alec Sutton.
 When Alec's turn came in the game, he nailed my measurements.
 ""I just measured them,"" he said. ""Exactly the same as high school.""
 I shot him a playful glare.
 ""Shut up. My husband's way faster than you.""
 Simeon smashed his glass and pointed at Alec.
 ""Elsie, what the hell does that mean?""
 The spirit messenger the King of Hell sent to keep an eye on me leaned in and whispered, ""You're here to suffer, not to die again.""
 But right then, I got 5 Heartbreak Points.
 I arched a brow, smug.
 Who said I had to be the one getting hurt? Hurting my cheating husband counted, too.
 ***
 The room went dead silent.
 Alec crossed his legs and met Simeon's gaze, completely unfazed by the murderous look.
 Sabrina, seated beside Simeon, looked like she was ready for the drama.
 I blinked innocently at Simeon.
 ""What's wrong, babe? It's your birthday. Why the big fuss?""
 A vein pulsed in his temple.
 ""What did you do with him? And you're seriously asking me what's wrong?""
 I gave a soft ""oh,"" as if it had finally sunk in, and reached for his hand.
 ""Are you jealous?
 ""Relax. We're just joking around. Bestie stuff. Don't read too much into it.""
 I said it so breezily that Simeon gaped at me.
 ""Bestie? He's a guy!""
 He practically shouted it, the echo bouncing off the walls.
 Sabrina smacked his butt.
 ""What's the matter with you? I told you, Elsie's good‑looking. You'd better keep an eye on her before some guy does.
 ""She grew up with Mr. Sutton. Of course, they're... closer than you think. But that doesn't mean she'd cheat on you.""
 I knew she was mocking me, yet I nodded.
 ""Exactly. If a guy can hold onto his wife these days, that's already a win. Don't be dramatic.""
 Sabrina froze, her next line dying on her lips.
 Simeon's eyes went red with rage.
 ""Me, dramatic? You let a guy touch your body to—""
 I cut him off, already annoyed.
 ""So what? You think friendship has a gender? You and Rina were pee‑buddies, weren't you?""
 Simeon stiffened, then his voice dropped.
 ""That's different. Rina's like a sister to me.""
 ""Oh, and Alec's like a brother to me. Different how, exactly?""
 His lips moved, but nothing came out.
 There went another 5 Heartbreak Points. I almost laughed.
 In my last life, Sabrina was always around.
 Simeon used words like that to shut me up, saying I was making a fuss over nothing.
 Now I threw them back at him, and he couldn't handle it.
Chapter 2
 Alec tugged gently at my hand, sensing the tension.
 ""El, does Sim not like me? I don't want you two fighting because of me. Maybe I should just go.""
 I picked up a napkin and calmly dabbed the wine from his jacket.
 ""Relax. You didn't do anything wrong.""
 Then I turned to Simeon, who looked genuinely stunned.
 ""Apologize to Alec.""
 Simeon stared at me as if I'd lost my mind, then gave a sharp, bitter laugh.
 ""You want me to apologize? To him?""
 Oh, that got to Simeon?
 In my last life, he'd made me apologize more times than I could count. He was a total jerk.
 He loved me, sure, but he never treated me like it.
 This time, I was making sure he got a taste of his own medicine.
 ""Yeah, you heard me,"" I said. ""Alec flew straight in from overseas just to wish you a happy birthday.
 ""You smashed a glass and dumped wine all over him. You don't think that deserves an apology?""
 The room went dead silent again.
 Sabrina opened her mouth, but Alec beat her to it, squeezing my hand gently.
 ""El, it's fine.
 ""Sim's probably just in a bad mood. A jacket's not worth a fight.""
 Those gentle, reasonable words were anything but, and they pushed Simeon over the edge.
 He kicked the coffee table hard.
 ""Don't fucking call me that. Alec, be a man, and stop acting like you're helping. Elsie is my wife. Let go of her hand!""
 Alec flinched, instinctively leaning closer to me.
 ""El, maybe I should go. Mr. Goldberg seems... unstable. He's not violent, is he?""
 The moment Simeon saw me soothing Alec, his jaw clenched, fury burning in his eyes.
 I couldn't help but enjoy it. This was just the start, and he was already cracking.
 What would he do when the real storm came?
 I ignored his glare and picked up my purse.
 ""If Alec's not welcome, I'm out too. You guys have fun. We're leaving.""
 The door shut behind us, cutting off Simeon's shouting and the crash of glass.
 The spirit messenger blinked at me, wide‑eyed, then gave a thumbs‑up.
 ""That's badass. 25 Heartbreak Points already.""
 I knew Simeon had gone half‑mad after I died. If he hadn't, this trick would never have worked on him.
 Then I walked Alec to the front desk of his hotel.
 ""Thanks for today. One call and you hopped a flight back from overseas just to help me pull this off.""
 He took the room key with a lazy smile.
 ""Since when do you thank me? You used to be fearless. Never thought I'd see you needing backup.""
 His words stung, and I forced a small smile.
 ""Yeah, me neither.""
 In my last life, my love for him went to the point of madness.
 I cut off every guy I knew, including Alec, the boy next door I grew up with, simply because Simeon didn't like it.
 Alec came back so many times, eager to see me, and every time I shut him out with an excuse, just to keep Simeon happy.
 Once, twice... I lost count.
 Eventually, Alec just said, ""Alright then. Take care of yourself.""
 And I believed that was the kind of sacrifice love and marriage demanded.
 Looking back now, it was laughable.
 I shut myself off from the world for him, while Simeon let Sabrina into every corner of our life.
 Calling herself his ""best friend"", she trampled my boundaries again and again.
 Alec's smile vanished, replaced by a hard, serious look.
 ""El, if this marriage is making you miserable, divorce him.
 ""Don't waste your time trying to prove something with a guy like that. He's not worth it.""
 I looked out at the city, where neon lights cut through the darkness.
 ""I will,"" I said quietly.
 Just not yet. The King of Hell gave me 49 days.
 I had to collect enough Heartbreak Points from Simeon first. Only then could I be sure I'd really live.
Chapter 3
 The air inside was thick with cigarette smoke.
 From the dark came Simeon's voice, raspy and dripping with sarcasm.
 ""Back already? I figured you two would be talking till morning after not seeing each other in ages.""
 I switched on the light and sat beside him, keeping my tone soft.
 ""Still upset?""
 Hurt him, then soothe him, toy with his feelings—that was Heartbreak 101.
 He pulled away from my hand.
 ""Elsie, you showed up with another guy and humiliated me in front of everyone.
 ""And now you think a simple question fixes it? Do you care about me, or am I just nothing to you?""
 I sighed, letting a trace of weariness slip into my voice.
 ""You disrespected Alec first.
 ""He flew back just to celebrate your birthday, and you—""
 ""Alec, always Alec!"" Simeon shouted.
 Just hearing his name set Simeon off.
 ""You're always defending him. You let him measure your body, ditched me on my birthday, and you think that's nothing?""
 Watching him unravel, I threw back the same line he once used to wound me.
 ""Don't be so dramatic. He's a designer, so I asked him to make me a dress.
 ""That comment was just to lighten the mood. If there were anything between us, we'd be together already. Why would I have married you?""
 I waved it off. ""Anyway, let's not talk about him.
 ""It's your birthday. No need to ruin it.""
 I pulled out a gift box and handed it to him.
 ""Open it. It took me a while to pick this out.""
 His expression finally softened, suspicion fading into a flicker of hope.
 He stared at the velvet box for a few seconds before reaching for it.
 The moment he saw what was inside, his jaw tightened.
 ""Elsie, do you think I'm stupid?""
 He pulled out the plain cufflinks and raised his voice.
 ""Alec just posted a photo of the diamond tie clip you gave him. What is this? A freebie from his gift?""
 I didn't flinch.
 ""You're overthinking it.
 ""The cufflinks and the tie clip came as a set. I bought them together.""
 I met his furious glare, keeping my tone calm.
 ""The cufflinks are the base style—clean, understated, perfect for everyday wear.
 ""Alec's clip, well...""
 I gave a small smile.
 ""He's my best friend. Of course, his had to be something special, with a little sparkle.""
 His breath grew ragged, his eyes red, but I stayed unmoved as I stood.
 ""It's late. I'm wiped. I'm going to bed.
 ""You've been drinking and smoking all night, so crash in the guest room,"" I said.
 Back in my room, I couldn't wait to check with the spirit messenger.
 ""How many points now?""
 ""30,"" he answered.

My husbands family will be driving out from Philly to join us. My daughter’s friend is coming as well. My husband’s family is his sister/her husband; my husband’s niece/her husband; my husband’s other niece/her toddler son; myself/my husband; our daughter/her friend. So 10 adults, and a toddler. They are all staying overnight at a nearby hotel as we don’t have room to accommodate everyone. My husband’s Nieces are also bringing a birthday cake for our daughter to the restaurant. 

My husband’s Nieces adore our daughter and they planned a fun event at a venue for her and a few of her friends for after dinner in a nearby city.  We offered to pay for part of this, although we haven’t heard back from them yet about it. 

Also, we planned to have bagels, coffee,  and a fruit platter for breakfast Sunday morning at our house before they head back to Philly. We are paying for all this. 

I was thinking we should ask for a separate check for the four of us (me, hubby, our daughter, her friend) and my husband’s family could figure out their portions. My husband’s sister and her husband  are extremely wealthy (millionaires) and both his nieces have very high paying jobs. We’re retired and although not poor, compared to them, we are in a completely different financial universe. 

I asked my husband what he wants to do and he keeps saying he doesn’t know. I really don’t want to cover a dinner bill of $500+ dollars, so not sure what to do here. 

Just for clarification, this entire weekend event was planned ahead of time by my husband’s nieces about a month ago. We just picked the restaurant and made the reservations. Thoughts? ",0,1763066887.0,etiquette,44,0.43,False

I (F) have a best friend  (M) and we've been best friends  for almost 15 years now, we met in elementary school, went to a different middle school, but then got into the same high school again. The most important context here is that I am always the ""therapist"" friend for everyone, I get used to people coming up to me and essentially asking me for advice or simply just rant and I always made sure to at least shows up for everyone and this, including to him.

I would say that our friendships mostly ""rooted"" with him asking me for his relationship advice cause he once stucked in a very unhealthy relationship throughout his teenage years and I'm always there as the listener and encourage him to get out. But other than that, I also have to say that he's such a good friend, he listened to me, he once accompanied me when I've gone through the most difficult loss and hard time of my life and it helped me a lot like I actually cherished this friendship.

And after high school, we grew quite apart and I'm fine with that cause I know life's changes especially since I went to college that is far from our hometown, we kept in touch from time to time during college, he finally got a new girlfriend which I'm soooo genuinely happy for him, I'm also happy with my college life, we expressed that we're happy for each other, and all seemed fine, right?

Then fast forward to now, we've graduated from college like almost a few years ago, I'm back to the hometown, got a remote job for the most part, and he got a job out of town, again, it's understandable if we grew apart cause things got even more busy. Last year he contacted me saying that his girlfriend (that very same one I mentioned before) cheated on him, he called me and we talked, he told me how hurted and sad he was, you know the post-breakup stuffs, but the strange thing is that after that, I sort of felt like he ignored me or avoiding me on purpose.

I asked him to meet up cause I know he'd be back to our hometown every once in a while (his workplace is not very far, like 1-2 hours away from our town) but every time I brought up the conversation, it always ended up in radio silence. Until a few weeks ago I finally asked something like, ""Do you even still want to meet/talk to me? Or what's going on here?"" and that's when he said that he's been feeling sad at the thought of meeting me.

He said and I quote, ""It's just all this time I always come to you when I'm sad, so now I unconsciously associated you with sadness. I know it's my fault but I'm trying to fix this now""

I guess it makes sense???? In a way??? But reading that also somehow makes me really sad??? Or maybe I'm just dramatic like that idk.

I tried to talk it out though, asking him how he's doing now, and he said he's been doing a lot better now, he's happier and everything, and I said something like, ""then let's meet, let's talk again, and let's talk about the happy part for once"" but then he just said, ""I just feel like I've been a bad friend to you""

I mean I've never said or think of him that way, I still tried to reassured(?) and talked to him about it after that, but he never really gave me a clear answer whether or not he's still wanted to meet/talk to me and when I invited him for a coffee sometime soon or later, he just never replied to my message until this very day.

I guess I just have to give him the time he needed. But also it's saddened me to think someone (let alone my best friend) could associate me with the sad part of their life to the point that they can't face me(?) when all I'm trying to do was to show up back then.... It's just really devastating situation all over and I've been self-conscious about all of my friendships knowing mostly it all started with them coming to me when they're sad or needed company/help/advice.

I am now just trying to wait for him to come around or trying to accept the fact that maybe the friendship would be just hanging in a thin rope like this. Idk man this is sad.

1owcba7,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1owcba7/unheard_voices/,Unheard Voices,"Chapter 9: Through the Echoes

The alley was colder than it should’ve been.

Sam Carter stood at the scene long after the forensics team had packed up. The body was gone. The blood had been washed into the gutter. But the echo of it—that moment still lingered in the air.

He stared at the brick wall where Eric Lane’s body had slumped, the taped note now sitting in an evidence bag inside his coat pocket.

""The Voice That Died"".

A phrase that didn’t just sound poetic—it sounded intentional. Like the others.

He knew the other cases were connected. He was sure of it now. But this one? This one was louder, Bolder.

""Pull all security footage from within a three-block radius,"" Sam had told a patrol officer earlier that evening. ""I want everything. Street cams. Doorbell cams. I don’t care if it’s grainy—I want it.""

Hours later, inside the precinct’s cramped AV room, he sat in front of a bank of monitors as footage flickered past in silence.

He was on his third cup of coffee and his fifth hour of footage when he finally saw it.

At first, it looked like nothing. Just a crowd forming behind the police tape, faces turned to flashing lights, some filming on their phones. Normal.

But then there. In the corner of one camera’s wide lens.

A figure. Still. Watching.

Not reacting. Not recording. Just present.

The timestamp was 8:12 p.m.—minutes after the scene had been secured. The man was standing half in shadow, his face obscured beneath the hood of a black jacket, the light from the patrol car reflecting off his silhouette like a smear of ink.

Sam leaned in, heart quickening. He froze the frame and enhanced it as much as the ancient system allowed.

No clear face.

But the stance was… familiar. Controlled. Deliberate. Everyone else was moving. Talking. Taking photos. This man was still. Focused. Listening.

“Got you,” Sam muttered under his breath.

He printed the frame and pinned it to the corkboard in his office, right next to the notes from the other murders.

A new question took shape in his mind—not who is the killer. But how long has he been watching?

Because if he was bold enough to come back to the scene…

He might already know who’s following him.

David hadn’t slept.

The alley was colder than it should’ve been.

Sam Carter stood at the scene long after the forensics team had packed up. The body was gone. The blood had been washed into the gutter. But the echo of it—that moment still lingered in the air.

He stared at the brick wall where Eric Lane’s body had slumped, the taped note now sitting in an evidence bag inside his coat pocket.

""The Voice That Died"".

A phrase that didn’t just sound poetic—it sounded intentional. Like the others.

He knew the other cases were connected. He was sure of it now. But this one? This one was louder, Bolder.

Hours later, inside the precinct’s cramped AV room, he sat in front of a bank of monitors as footage flickered past in silence.

He was on his third cup of coffee and his fifth hour of footage when he finally saw it.

At first, it looked like nothing. Just a crowd forming behind the police tape, faces turned to flashing lights, some filming on their phones. Normal.

But then there. In the corner of one camera’s wide lens.

A figure. Still. Watching.

Not reacting. Not recording. Just present.

The timestamp was 8:12 p.m.—minutes after the scene had been secured. The man was standing half in shadow, his face obscured beneath the hood of a black jacket, the light from the patrol car reflecting off his silhouette like a smear of ink.

Sam leaned in, heart quickening. He froze the frame and enhanced it as much as the ancient system allowed.

No clear face.

But the stance was… familiar. Controlled. Deliberate. Everyone else was moving. Talking. Taking photos. This man was still. Focused. Listening.

“Got you,” Sam muttered under his breath.

He printed the frame and pinned it to the corkboard in his office, right next to the notes from the other murders.

A new question took shape in his mind—not who is the killer. But how long has he been watching?

Because if he was bold enough to come back to the scene…

He might already know who’s following him.

Four Seasons Landaa Giraavaru Overwater Villa Walkthrough: (will add as soon as it uploads)

# Overall

We just returned from a five-night visit to Ritz-Carlton Fari Islands Maldives, then continued on to Cheval Blanc Randheli (review for that coming soon). We spent most of the trip comparing our stay to our trip to Four Seasons Landaa Giraavaru’s overwater villa that we visited two years ago, so thought this combo review made sense!

**Ritz-Carlton Fari Islands:**  

The Ritz-Carlton is a five year old property with overwater and beach villa options. The design theme here is circles and the rooms are inspired by circles. This is because Maldives islands are largely circular, as are the Atolls. The architect that designed this resort also designed Aman Tokyo, Aman Kyoto, and Amankora. The island itself is lush with green vegetation and has many short bridges with picturesque views of the ocean.

The rooms are fairly basic for the price and the deck area is pretty small, so thus, the pool is also very small and in the shade, making it too cold to use.  Additionally, since the deck is small, there is limited outdoor space which is very important in the Maldives.  The service is more comparable to service the Caribbean in our opinion, so not consistent with most Maldives luxury resorts.

One of the benefits of Ritz is that you can have complimentary boat transfers to Patina and the Fari Marina Village area, which includes additional restaurants, food trucks, a beach nicer than the ones on Ritz’s island, and a pool, all in addition to those amenities on the Ritz island.

There really are no bad views in the Maldives and the Ritz is no different. There are endless photo opportunities. The views are great and you constantly find better places to take photos, especially of sunset. 

There were a lot of families with kids here, far more than we have seen in our past trip to the Maldives. We did hear it is school break in Europe so maybe that contributed to the amount of kids, but the resort is definitely kid-friendly.

**Four Seasons Landaa Giraavaru** 

This is one of two Four Seasons properties on the Maldives. While we visited here two years ago, and in fact went to both properties, I wanted to include it because I think it is a great alternative to the Ritz at comparable prices.

The villas are really nice here and include a separate living room area. The deck has an amazing infinity pool that stretches out over the water and many options of seating and lounging areas. We spent the majority of our time on the deck! 

The property is in the Baa Atoll, which is where some of the best snorkeling and diving in the Maldives is located. One excursion option gives you a “manta phone” that they’ll call you on when they see whale sharks or manta rays so they can take you to them. We carried it everywhere with us hoping for a call, but it never rang, unfortunately. 

I know many people don’t mention Four Seasons when talking Maldives, but in this price point, I think it is a great option. As expected, the service is amazing and they know how to make a trip special. We felt very well taken care of here even though there wasn’t an assigned butler. We used the Four Seasons app and everything we asked for was taken care of immediately. The only thing missing was proactive service you get by someone being assigned to you if that person also pays attention, but Ritz didn’t have this either despite having an assigned butler.

# Transfer 

**Ritz-Carlton:**

The Ritz does not require a sea plane but instead uses a small yacht to bring you to the island. You have to wait in a public waiting area outside the airport with guests from other resorts (which was warm and humid and mostly with guests going to non-luxury hotels - we learned this later from Cheval Blanc staff). We waited for a while for guests that were landing a little late, but were then taken to the resort on the nice yacht. It was a 75-minute and fairly smooth ride. They had drinks and a snack platter for each set of guests. We had a family of four with us and then another couple on their honeymoon. 

On the return trip, they do not use the yacht and instead use a speed boat. The seating was much less comfortable so overall a downgrade. No real staffing either beyond the team driving and working the boat. This was disappointing since we paid for a “luxury yacht” transfer and the speedboat was not luxury in any sense. 

We did not go back to the airport in Male via Ritz so cannot comment on that process. Instead we continued on to Cheval Blanc Randheli and were picked up by the CB staff right from the Ritz boat. 

Transfers for Ritz cost $1,000 per person round trip.  

**Four Seasons Landaa Giraavaru:**  

Upon arrival to the Male airport, Four Seasons has a private (but small) air-conditioned room inside the airport. This is a nice feature in comparison to Ritz which was a common room for all resorts and did not really have functioning air conditioning. 

You are then driven in a private vehicle to the sea plane airport. At the seaplane airport, they again have a lounge, but this one is larger and beautiful, with a larger variety of snacks and drinks. From there, you are taken to one of three sea plane transfer options, either the Trans Maldivian chartered flight, or one of the two Four Seasons sea planes. Four Seasons planes are better for comfort and less number of seats. We flew on the Flying Boxfish Four Seasons plane (the yellow one), which was an included promo benefit at the time, so no additional cost. 

The sea plane is small, with 10 seats, but overall it is a beautiful ride over all the various Maldivian islands. Many people choose to avoid sea planes when traveling to the Maldives, but my recommendation is to pick the best resort for you, and not limit your options by only wanting to use one speed boats unless you have an actual aversion to the sea plane option. We’ve done multiple seaplanes now and every trip has been pleasant for us. Depending on which resort, the costs can even be more on a boat transfer and take a similar amount of time. 

**Comparison**   

Four Seasons was a better process overall even though it is not an exact comparison since FS is sea plane and Ritz is boat transfer.  

The separate waiting area is a big plus for Four Seasons and while the yacht was nice on the way to the Ritz, the downgrade on the return was disappointing given the cost was the same.   

# Check-in

**Ritz-Carlton**

Like most resorts in the Maldives, your butler greets the yacht and takes you on a golf cart tour of the property and then brings you to your room for the check-in process. 

**Four Seasons**    
While you are not assigned a butler, the process is the same, you are greeted at the dock and taken on a golf cart tour of the property and brought to your villa.  

**Comparison**  

Overall, they are equal in their seamless check in process.  

# Room

**Ritz-Carlton**  

I was fairly underwhelmed by the website's room photos, so my expectations were low despite hearing good things from clients. The room turned out to be much better than photographs show, so the clients were right (of course)! The design similarities from the architect having an Aman pedigree shows in some places, so if you like that aesthetic then you would probably like it here.

The room is bigger than it looks in photos and much brighter. It always seemed dark to me in photographs and YouTube videos, but thankfully that wasn’t the case in person. The sliding doors to the deck open entirely into the walls so that you can literally feel like you are outside all the time with 80% or so of the wall between the bed and deck being open.  We like to keep our room (and house at home) pretty cold, around 65 F, and this air conditioner could quickly cool the room even beyond that! We usually crank the thermostat all the way down when we enter a room at a resort and it never actually gets there, but the Ritz room AC can cool off the room in less than an hour to uncomfortably cold temperatures even after the sliding door was open. A++ on the AC. 

The room is pretty straightforward, a bed that faces an incredibly beautiful Maldives view of the water. The bed was comfortable, I would say not overly soft, but also not hard.

There is a table that fits four easily with two chairs and a couch/banquette type seating.  That is also where the tv is located which has the ability to swivel but is fairly far from the bed and at a strange angle if you want to use it. That is not really a problem for us though because we don’t tend to watch TV in resort rooms. 

There is a small mini bar that has free snacks and drinks, with only alcohol charged. They include fresh cookies that were really good (chocolate chip, chocolate cookies), popcorn, sodas, juices, and milks. 

There is also a very large bathtub in the room, which seems out of place since it is not in the bathroom, but is clearly placed so one can see the endless views of the ocean. Just a bit strange to have a tub next to a bed.

The closet is large and is the entire length of the bathroom, which is the majority of the room’s length since it sits right behind the bed.  The bathroom has a double vanity, separate toilet room, and a fairly large shower than connects outside to the outdoor shower. The outdoor shower does not seem super private because there are large gaps in the wood and the next villa is close by. I could see their stairs into the water and saw a guest walk out once from the outdoor shower area. I think technically it is not visible from the other room unless you really want to try to look, but we still prefer more privacy. It was also quite dark given its location and the wood slats. 

The deck is fairly small, but has a very small table in the corner with banquette seating and then an outdoor daybed. 

The view from the overwater bungalow is what makes the very long journey to the Maldives worth it. We had stunning turquoise views right from our deck. There are pools with each overwater villa and beach villas, but there is no heating at any of them and based on the design, they don’t get a lot of sun so the pool temperature was cool. Other guests mentioned the same. The pool was unusable most of the day because the water was too cold. This could be different at a different time of year with more sun and hotter weather, but it was a letdown for us. 

There is a small netted lounge area below the pool level that also provides access to the water. 

**Four Seasons Landaa Giraavaru**  

On the other hand, the website photos of Four Seasons left me with high expectations and somehow in person, it is even nicer. 

We stayed in the overwater villa with pool which is very large, bright, has high ceilings and nicely decorated with whites, greys and blues. 

When you enter, there is a small bar area, a small table and chairs, a living area with a nice sized couch, and chair with coffee table. They have a CD player (so retro) with a CD that is FS Maldives themed of music they curated. I really liked a lot of the music and was able to find most of the songs on Apple Music, and have listened to my FS Maldives playlist often when thinking about this trip and needing a relaxing playlist. This is in a bit of contrast to the slightly EDM theme of the music at Ritz, and I felt it was a really nice addition to the room. The room is separated by a partial wall with a television. On the other side of the partial wall is the bed area. The bed, as always at the Four Seasons, is incredible. We loved this particular bed so much that we reached out through the app after we got home to ask what firmness it was because we were considering buying it for home. The staff on the app actually went to our room and looked at the bed to give us the answer, which was great service by Four Seasons even after we completed our stay.  A chair is also on this side of the room and again a television on the partial wall.

The closet is very large and opens to the bathroom. The bathroom is just beautiful with greys, white, and blue accents again.  The toilet area has a glass floor so you can see fish and other sea life pass by. As cheesy as it may sound, it is also pretty.

The bathroom has a large shower and large bath, which you can use while looking at the amazing views. We are not huge bath people, but it did seem really nice.

The deck is just incredible. It is so large, larger than most I have seen in the Maldives and all the sliding doors in the bedroom and bathroom open up to it. There are also so many seating areas which again is amazing. They have a daybed which allows both sides to adjust the settings separately, a large swing, a pavilion area with a bed type seating again, some chairs, and a very large table with seating. Then, there is a spiral staircase that takes you up to a nook where you can again sit on bean bag type seating and take in the views. We didn’t really use this area but I can see kids loving it. It was a bit hot up there since it was partially closed in, but had nice views. There was also a nice large netting area to sit in and watch the waves and marine life pass by.

The infinity pool is just great as well. It was a large size, jutting out into above the ocean and the temperature was always perfect. This was a dramatic difference between FS and Ritz with FS’s pool being incredible.

As is standard in the Maldives, you can take the ladder straight into the ocean. You can snorkel all around Landaa. We saw many sharks, fish, and sting rays. 

The outdoor shower is off the bathroom and is completely private with 7-foot walls surrounding it. Since it is outdoors, it is bright and nice to use. 

There are also island villas which are very similar to the overwater villas in layout to the overwater villas but many of them have more bedrooms.   

**Comparison**   

Four Seasons Landaa Giraavaru is significantly better in every way over Ritz in room design and features. 

While they are both overwater villas and have incredible views, that is where the similarities end. The Four Seasons room is much larger-feeling and brighter with the high ceilings and the set up of the room. The seating in the living room is much more usable in the FS where the banquette at the Ritz is not really usable and off in the corner. 

The outdoor shower is again much better at the Four Seasons whereas we did not use the one at the Ritz. 

Also, the outdoor area is just incomparable with the Ritz being so small and the pool is not really usable, whereas at the Four Season, we spent so much time in our pool and on the deck. We read in the large swing, ate meals outside at the nice table, and spent our days enjoying the Maldives on the deck at the FS. At the Ritz, we largely went elsewhere since the deck was so small with not much usable space.  

# Food 

**Ritz-Carlton**  

The breakfast buffet is good and includes options for many different types of cuisines, regardless of where you are from. You are also free to order off the a la carte menu, including omelettes, pancakes, waffles, and crepes. If you want something not listed, they will get it for you as long as they can make it. My wife was able to get both avocado toast and sliced mango, neither of which were listed anywhere.  

We ordered breakfast in our room twice and they actually have a more extensive a la carte menu for in-room dining. They did a nice set up, but the food was cold by the time it arrived, which is not entirely surprising given the size of the property and the fact that we were in an overwater villa, but still could have been executed better. The FS breakfasts arrived hot with similar distance to travel.

One of the best things about this resort is the variety of restaurants. Not only do you have the five on-site restaurants, but you also have access to Patina’s restaurants and the shared Fari Marina Village area near on Patina’s island where they have more restaurants. In total, there were over a dozen different dining options, including food trucks available during lunch. 

Overall, the food at the restaurants we tried were all good, but not amazing. We ate at two different Italian restaurants, an Indian/Lebanese fusion and a Chinese restaurant.  For the Maldives, the prices were actually not too bad.

They also had two themed dinners: one was autumn themed, the other Halloween. We walked through the Halloween night which essentially included booths with food from all the restaurants, as well as games and fun decor. It really was suited more for families with kids, but the kids certainly seemed to be having the time of their lives. At the price of $205 or $250 a person respectively, plus 28.5% taxes and charges. We chose to instead skip the buffet style dining (which is not our favorite) and just go to a restaurant of our choosing.

**Four Seasons**  

The breakfast was again great at the Four Seasons. You could also eat in your room which we did on the deck outside most mornings so we could enjoy the villa. The food here arrived hot and was set up very nicely.

There are several restaurant options: Italian, seafood, Lebanese, middle eastern and Asian.  We tried all of the restaurants and each one was very beautifully designed.  The Middle Eastern restaurant has a ceiling filled with Turkish lamps making it an Instagram dream for photos. The food was all good, and better overall than the Ritz. 

Where the Four Seasons excels is their service, which extends to dining. For instance, one night we went to the Italian restaurant only to find out it was a specialty themed night for lobster. A dream menu for someone that loves lobster, but my wife does not eat seafood and the menu had no options other than lobster. We tried to leave before being seated once we realized it was only lobster, but the manager stopped us quickly to ask if something was wrong. We apologized and said that we did not realize it was a specialty night and would just go to another restaurant, but he guided us back to this incredible table they set up for my wife’s birthday and said that they would never want a guest to leave because of the menu. They said they could make us anything we wanted and to not worry about the menu. We ended up having a great meal in a beautiful setting with multiple restaurant staff doting over us for my wife’s birthday, despite ordering a meal that required the kitchen staff to switch gears from the theme. We had Italian food with olive oil and balsamic vinegar for the bread course that was so good I found it online when we got home and imported it from Italy myself like they did.  

**Comparison**   

The food variety is better because of sheer restaurant options at Ritz, but the food was better quality at Four Seasons. The experience and service at the restaurants was significantly better at FS, even though the service  was also good at Ritz, just not above and beyond like FS.

# Beaches

**Ritz-Carlton**  

The main beach area at the Ritz is nice. There are lounge chair seating and cabanas, all complimentary and no fighting at all to get your desired seating. There are yeti coolers with water at each seating option. The sand is soft and the water is again more unreal colors and super clear. It was choppier than we are used to in the Maldives but still very much enjoyable.

Then there is Fari Marina Village, where there is another beach option. To get there, you take a short 7-minute boat because it is located on the same island as Patina. That beach is incredible with beautiful water and almost no one is there because of the need for the boat transfer. It was as calm as a bathtub, very clear, and the most incredible colors of blues and turquoise. We essentially had this beach to ourselves each day, which worked for us and we kept coming back. It really should not be missed if staying at Ritz or Patina. We tried to recruit some resort friends to come over with us, but they decided to stay at Ritz because of the boat transfer. 

In general, the beaches at Patina seem just as calm and beautiful so if you are planning to stay at Patina, you are in for amazing views and water.

**Four Seasons**   

Because there is a reef at Four Seasons, I would say the beach and ocean is not quite as swimmable, at least in terms of floating and relaxing. 

The designated beach area is by the Italian restaurant. The service was great, but the area was fairly small and was pretty busy. There were a ton of hermit crabs on the beach which were fun to watch. The ocean area for swimming was also pretty small. If you stay in a beach villa, those seemed to have the best beaches, but it was awkward to use those beaches unless it was your villa. This is great for beach villa guests, but not for overwater villa guests.

There is a walkable sandbar you can get to depending on the tide. There is a really nice beach at the end of the sand bar, but timing here is limited by the tide since you really can’t walk back at high tide. 

**Comparison**   

The Ritz is simply better when considering the Fari Marina Village beach area. The beach and sand was incredible there and perfect for spending the day relaxing. You’re also close to the food trucks for quick lunch options. We ended up going back to our villa at Four seasons and enjoyed our deck instead of staying at the beach.   

# Pool 

**Ritz-Carlton**

As noted above, the pool at the villas are small and not really usable. 

There is a common-use large circular infinity pool on the island. It is very pretty and overlooks incredible views. It is again unheated but was more manageable given that it had direct sunlight! The lounge chair area is a little odd where you are essentially on the ground with high bushes on both sides of you so you have no views of anything but a sliver of the pool. Most nights at sunset, they do a “defining moment” ceremony where they light a circle at the edge of the pool with flames that you can watch sunset descend through while they play a drum song. 

The pool at Fari Marina Village is again very nice and looks over the beautiful lagoon. This is the place to be. 

**Four Seasons**    

There is really no reason to go to a pool anywhere other than your villa. It is large with perfect views and great temperature. Most guests seemed to stay in their own pools as well.

That said, there are still four more pools (at least two of which are infinity pools), one being a kid's pool. All the pools were a very comfortable temperature all day. The one by all the restaurants is huge and never had anyone at it, so was very nice to relax by yourself in a massive pool. 

**Comparison**   

I would say Four Seasons has the slight edge here in terms of public pools, especially since they have four pools and one for kids.

In terms of Villa pools, Four Seasons wins again, hands down. No comparison in size, design, and functionality, with the FS pools dramatically better. 

# Service 

**Ritz-Carlton**

Every room gets a butler at the Ritz. This is supposed to be your go to person for anything from excursions, dinner reservations, or golf cart rides. In the Maldives, service is often at an unparalleled level, in our experience. Here, I would equate  our butler service more to what you may get in the Caribbean for “butler service”. You could tell each butler had way too many rooms to handle so they were on their phones typing and talking even while driving the golf cart. Ours would answer his phone in the middle of conversations with us, which was confusing and fairly awkward at times. We almost always had decent wait times for pickups. That said, most everyone else on the island is so kind and works hard to ensure your trip is great.

In general, you are expected to communicate everything to your butler via WhatsApp. 

**Four Seasons**  

While there are no assigned butlers, it is not something we missed at all with how great the resort handled requests through the Four Seasons app chat. That said, we are not really people that rely on butlers much. 

Every single person we encountered went above and beyond, whether that was someone providing golf cart rides, the snorkeling excursion team, the restaurant staff, or the marine biologist. We liked meeting more people and chatting with them since we weren’t always with the same assigned butler.

The Four Seasons app chat is really nice here. Resorts with assigned butlers generally use WhatsApp anyway, so FS app chat is really not much different except that it’s faster since the task gets assigned to the first or closest available person. Everyone we encountered was great and very nice. 

**Comparison**   

Service is just consistently better at Four Seasons. While I have had great service at other Ritz properties, and I am far from a Ritz hater, I just was not impressed with the service here at Ritz in the Maldives. 

# Getting around the island 

**Ritz-Carlton**

Every villa has bikes so you can use those to travel around the island. You can also walk or take a golf cart with your butler. The island is fairly large (for the Maldives) since it’s long when taking into consideration the overwater villa area, so most people are either using bikes or golf carts to get around, particularly if in the over water villas. The bridges are a bit narrow so it can get a little dicey on a bike when passing a golf cart. 

**Four Seasons**   

At Four Seasons, you are given bikes adorned with little wooden signs with the guests initials. They also have quick golf cart rides available as well, which is also needed for the fairly large island.  

**Comparison**  

Generally both the same, so no clear better option here. 

# Excursions

**Ritz-Carlton**  

They have a lot of the normal Maldives excursions such as snorkeling, turtle snorkeling, shark snorkeling, scuba diving, dolphin cruises and sunset cruises.

Fair warning, the water is pretty choppy when you are headed out on excursions. We are not normally ones to suffer motion sickness, but it was pretty rough and the staff commented it is fairly normal there. On the luxury sunset cruises, which uses a catamaran, we could not really move around due to the waves rocking the boat. We had to sit in place or risk falling over. We both ended up feeling sick after this trip. They also kind of just went back and forth twice with the sunset either in front of or behind the boat, which kind of sucked while the sunset was behind you when you can’t really move because of the waves.

**Four Seasons**  

The excursions available are really great at Four Seasons. We went on a snorkel trip. One of the great things about Four Seasons is that they have on-site marine biologists that either join on excursions or have mini presentations available before going. Our snorkel trip was amazing, and there were only four people including us. They have two members of their staff in the water pointing out things to see. We saw dozens of varieties of fish, an eagle ray, multiple sharks, and multiple turtles. 

We also signed up for the “manta phone” excursion. Four Seasons Landaa Giraavaru is in the Baa Atoll, which is one of the best places to dive or snorkel and has whale sharks and manta rays depending on the season. For this excursion, you sign up and are given a manta phone (essentially a phone on a lanyard that can go in the water) and you carry it everywhere you go. They have a scout team out on a boat and if the team sees manta rays or whale sharks, they call you and you have 15 minutes to get to the boat!  Unfortunately, we never got called while there, but we knew we were at the end of the season, and they told us it would be unlikely. 

They also have turtle snorkeling and dolphin cruises.

While not really an excursion, they have a turtle rehabilitation program as well, so we got to see some injured turtles they were working with. Turtles are sometimes caught in ghost nets in other regions where they’re not illegal yet, and get injured but somehow make their way to Maldives. By then, they sometimes lose their ability to swim properly or go below the surface, so struggle to survive. Some make it back in the water after rehabilitation, others eventually get sent to a bigger facility for long term living. It was sad to see them injured but nice to see them being well taken care of. The marine biologists would regularly take them out into the water and swim with them so they didn’t feel cooped up in the tanks.  They had many success cases which was really nice to see. 

**Comparison**   

Four Seasons once again is better. We have gone snorkeling many places and the team was just amazing here. They were so hands on and really made it an incredible experience. Hopefully one day we will get to see the whale sharks and manta rays!   

# Kids 

**Ritz-Carlton**  

The resort seems to really be a great option for families. There is a very active kids club that was also out and about all over the island doing different activities. They also have the cutest kids club in an area that looks like it’s a Hobbit Hole straight out of Lord of the Rings. They also have a water park type area for the kids.

As mentioned above, they also have themed dinner events (there were two in the five nights we were here) that were perfect for kids with games, dance areas, etc.

**Four Seasons**  

Four Seasons consistently does well with kids programs and based on client reports, it is great here as well. 

Their kids club does activities like sand castle building, yoga, beach games, cooking classes, mini spa days, turtle monitoring and IDing, scavenger hunts, and more. They also have baby-sitting services. There is a kids pool and slides as well!

**Comparison**   

They both seem great for kids, but given that I have had clients actually experience Four Seasons and reported back that it was great and they have a kids pool, I would put Four Seasons slightly ahead.

# Snorkeling from the overwater villa 

**Ritz-Carlton**  

While I did snorkel from our room, there was very little to see. I only saw two trigger fish. We did see some large stingrays when we were on the cart path several times.

**Four Seasons**   

Four Seasons is pretty good for snorkeling on the resort. A lot of the islands have no living reef so it is a plus to have one here. They also actively work to add new reef, which you can donate to add! You even get photos of its growth year to year! The house reef here is better than the Ritz, but if this is a strong desire to have, there may be better options in the Baa Atoll. It was perfect for us, though, since we’re snorkelers as opposed to divers. 

As mentioned above, we saw a lot while snorkeling on-site, including sharks (reef and nurse sharks), fish, sting rays, etc. 

**Comparison**   

Since Ritz really has no reef on site, Four Seasons is easily better for this metric.   

# Miscellaneous 

**Ritz-Carlton**

There are a lot of points stay guests at the resort. A sales director told me the majority of people here are staying with points. If you have Bonvoy points and want to go to a resort in the Maldives, it is a great place to stay as you won’t be the minority as a points stay. If you don’t have Bonvoy points and are paying cash, then I think there are better choices in the Maldives. 

We never saw or were bitten by any bugs on the island. 

There is fairly loud music playing at all the beaches and pools. We prefer to hear the ocean waves, but we know a lot of people prefer music, so it is just a preference thing.

Unfortunately, I had to use the clinic on the island so can comment that the doctor was very nice but ultimately gave the wrong diagnosis. I had to see a doctor at Cheval Blanc, our second resort, and was told the Ritz doctor gave me all the wrong meds, which is why I got worse and not better! The CB doctor fixed me up within an hour after we got there and saw her!

We were not very impressed with how the Ritz handled special occasions. They completely forgot our anniversary and my wife’s birthday was not mentioned really by anyone, but there was a bottle of wine in the room after dinner. Our butler only mentioned the birthday once when he offered a photo by the Ritz sign while taking us to the boat for our transfer to Patina for dinner, saying something like might as well take a photo since it’s your birthday. We regularly travel this time of the year so have seen how resorts handle celebrations and this was not nearly as special.  We are not expecting anything insane, but it is just surprising when you see how other resorts handle celebrations. That said, we met some honeymooners and they said the resort did a great job with them, so it probably depends on the butler. Their butler even made them a really cool hat from Palm leaves, as well as did nice little things each day for them. 

**Four Seasons**

For celebrations, they could not have been any better. We celebrated both my wife’s 40th birthday and our anniversary (they are only 6 days apart) and they made it so special. They set up amazing tables for us both evenings, provided presents (she got a coverup from the boutique and we got a wooden picture frame that had “Maldives” carved into it). They set up the room beautifully and just made every effort to make it special. Even random staff members that rode by us in golf carts said happy birthday or happy anniversary when we were walking around nowhere near our room or any other way to identify us other than knowing who we are. 
  
No bugs here either. 

The resort aesthetics at FS is much more our style, particularly because it has high ceilings and is brighter. It’s more elegant and didn’t have music playing everywhere you went. We really enjoyed our stay here!

# Conclusion 

Ritz-Carlton

Overall, we had a good time at the Ritz. The beach at Fari Marina Village made it all worth it and should not be missed (including if you are staying at Patina). For us, we preferred our stay at the Four Seasons which are a similar price point, if not a little cheaper. That said, it can be a great trip for many people including if you are using points! If we had a different butler here, I really think the entire experience would have been much improved, which is also why I think most people we talked to really enjoyed their trip.  I would say though that these guests had not been to the Maldives before though so had little to compare it to.   

**Four Seasons**  

I know this group is not necessarily fans of the Four Seasons Maldives properties but having been to both now, I can say that we had a really great time. Landaa Giraavaru in particular is a great option if you want to be in the Baa Atoll. It’s not perfect, but we very much enjoyed our stay here and would return again in the future.

Hope you're all doing amazing! I am aware that the sample above does not tell much about the actual plot, yet I wished to include it as an example of my writing (I can write more, depending on the situation in the roleplay itself ;).

But Frog, you may ask, what is this roleplay even about? Well, let me tell you: Zofia, a 19 year old daughter of a financially-struggling family, is sent to work as a maid in a noble household, somewhere distant. My main goal for this roleplay is to explore how her new life would look like, everyday chores and challenges that her occupation brings, relations between her coworkers (both camaraderie and conflict) and other members of the household as well as perhaps events happening in the town they’d live in. It's a simple premise, but one that gives us so many possibilities! I'd love to hear your ideas as well ^(\^)

A bunch of extra details:

* *Please know that even though I am looking for someone to GM this story, I’ll contribute as much as you wish. Be it brainstorming, playing some side characters, you name it. As someone who knows how it is to GM, I wish for you to enjoy the roleplay as well (＾-＾)*
* *While this roleplay is meant to be wholesome and cozy, there will be some more somber tones from time to time.*
* *Brainstorming and worldbuilding! Whether we decide to place it in our real world Victorian era, or perhaps a fictional setting, I’d appreciate it if we dedicated some time to setting up the plot, adjusting it and tailoring to our wants, deciding on the core themes as well as worldbuilding (the household, for example).*
* I’d love to capture the aesthetics of manga/anime, even with the ways we’d write our roleplay. Some exaggeration, tropes and so one are very welcome :D
* *I am open to romance, although only between two women* *^(”)* *I don’t mind it being a sizable part of our story, however, I don’t want it to overshadow everything else, nor feel rushed.*

Why hello! I shall introduce myself a bit, so that you also know who you’re dealing with. You may call me Frog. I’m a passionate, 18+ roleplayer from CET/GMT +1 timezone. However, I do not think those pose any obstacle in terms of writing, so don’t be deterred by that even if you’re from a completely different part of our space-roaming disc silly autocorrect, I meant globe :P. Besides that, I don’t have much to share about me, I reckon. I love cats though, that’s worth a mention!

The \[X4Y\] tag does reflect the gender of my characters, not my own. I prefer not sharing it. I hope you’ll understand <3

**About you:**

Here you’ll find a few requirements, so that we are sure we match.

* *Be 18+. Do not tell me your exact age or real gender, just confirm if you are 18+*
* *Be literate. I love writing, especially descriptions, which I find to greatly enhance the storytelling. I usually provide around 2-4 paragraphs per response and would ask for my partner to be able to match that. However, I’ve recently been hoping to try a short-length approach for conversations to make them more dynamic \^\^*

It's been almost two weeks since my last post, and I've been busy addressing several issues, I spent a long time fixing alot of bugs, improving code documentation for possible contributors  and completely reworking variable and function names to ensure better consistency

A major fix was implementing true 'uniform' variables, which corrects an honest mistake from the previous release and improves reliability and readability

I've also enhanced the library's cross platform capabilities with glyph\_gl.h receiving the most significant changes to achieve this

Looking ahead, I've started the process of adding full OTF font support to GlyphGL, which I expect to be fully tested and integrated within the next week or two (hopefully) Additionally, I am currently working on a dedicated website that will host comprehensive documentation for all of GlyphGL's features

Also, The UTF-8 decoder is still quite primitive, so if anyone have time please look forward to fix some of it's bugs (I will publish a TODO list in the readme soon),

There are many many features I'd like to add like full support of OpenGL ES, and make it compatible to Android

As always, please feel free to check out the updated code and look for any issues. I am completely open to criticism and feedback, as I want to make this project truly stand out,

Thanks!

It was just another typical day, waking up, kissing my wife, feeding the kids and going to work… But typical isn't my family. As soon as I stepped foot into the kitchen my two daughters had already latched onto my legs like magnets on metal.

“Daddy!” Both Louella and Leona exclaimed while I waddled towards the coffee pot.

Beside Bonnie being the one who makes me happiest, these girls didn't take after her personality in the slightest. That prize goes to my son.

“Daddy … Mama, wants you to take me today…” Charlie softly spoke, rubbing his eyes.

“Is that so?” I removed the girls from my legs and picked Charlie up. “Well I see no harm in bringing you with me today, but only if you really want to hang out with daddy okay?”

Charlie rested his head on my shoulder and gave a very subtle nod as he gripped my uniform. 

“That settles it then…” I turned on the coffee pot and moved towards the living room. “Girls behave and listen to your mother today.”

Leona and Louella both nodded in sync with each other and immediately dashed upstairs. It's crazy to think a year ago they were still trying to climb out of their beds, and now they're growing faster than normal… they're clearly anything but normal children. 

I couldn't ask for a better life, as this is as perfect as it'll get for me…

Today is the day that I went to the Sakuran sector, as they had informed me of someone that might suit the needs of the security team I was building. Yamato, and Musashi had both promised me that this person was worthy, skilled and efficient. But it was ultimately down to my decision. But with Charlie on my back… His decision was going to be important to whether this person was good enough.

“Daddy…?” Charlie shifted to look around my head.

“Yeah buddy?” 

Charlie pointed at Musashi in the distance along with two others who had wooden training swords. “Mushi… miss Mushi…”

Charlie was a big fan of Musashi, mainly because she lets him sleep in those tails. On the other hand she had made him an adorable stuffed fox with her colors she wore. But I can't blame him… the other kids all enjoy the fluffy fox tails…

“Yep, that's Musashi buddy.” I reached behind my back and lifted him over my head and set him down in front of me. “Go say hi.”

The usually shy and quiet boy I worried about took off towards the well endowed Kitsune woman, who most likely knew he was coming towards her.

“Miss Mushi!” Charlie called out as he made his way to her.

Musashi didn't even have to look, only an ear twitched. When Charlie got close enough a tail wrapped him up and brought his small body right onto Musashi's lap. 

She had yet to acknowledge my presence,  but I knew she knew I was there.

“Lady Musashi.” I said with a slight bow.

“Ah… Greetings Lumberjack.” Musashi responded as she ran a hand through Charlie's messy white hair.

I couldn't help but laugh. Shinano had called me that a few times before, and it had stuck too…

“Im here on request from you and your sisters.” I moved to sit beside her. “About a person that would suit my security team?”

Musashi's face scrunched up at the strikes between the two in the field in front of us, but ultimately nodded as she watched the smaller built person quickly counter the others attacks before losing her balance due to the weight of the training swords.

“Indeed, but why not watch the show? Or partake in it?” Musashi gave a sly grin as the shattering of a wooden sword broke the calm.

“Why must you inject such things?” I stood up and took off my uniform jacket. “You know I love a good fight.”

Musashi simply smirked while pulling another training sword from seemingly nowhere, but this one was way shorter than the ones currently in use.

“If you truly wish to test them, then do it with something more nimble.” Musashi handed over the wooden sword before wrapping a tail around Charlie who looked like he was about to fall asleep. 

The two youngsters looked in my direction, confused look evident to their faces as i took off my jacket and grabbed the practice sword offered by Musashi.

The two of them seemed to at least be mentally prepared for Musashi’s tests as they finished their combat, saluted each other and then turned in my direction.

“No need to pick turns.” I saluted them and then got to my preferred stance, weighting the wooden blade offered by Musashi “It will be a good practice for you and me if you come at me at the same time.”

I saw two pairs of eyebrows going up at that, the suggestion obviously catching them unaware. The two of them both looked behind me, obviously looking for their Sensei’s approval for such an unreasonable duel.

I didn't need to turn back to know that Musashi would simply nod curtly at that, no words needed. The two youngsters reluctantly prepared themselves, reading their stances.

They had pretty orthodox stances, almost textbook. Too predictable. Too… easy.

The girl took the initiative, dashing forward following well practiced moves. The fluidity of her movement was only betrayed by her habits.
A quick step forward from my part, with my sword aimed right at her face was all it took for the girl to prepare herself for a feint, one that never arrived. I dashed forward, using my own blade to push hers to the side, getting far closer than she was comfortable with.

As she attempted to move back, the taller more muscular boy had already come to assist, he moved directly to my left, aiming to approach me from a side that would be disadvantageous for me.

I moved my own feet with well practiced moves, rather than proper form I pulled knowledge from my own experiences against facing other nation's soldiers. Swift hard-to-predict movements that exploit gaps created by bad habits.

I twisted my body and lowered my center of gravity, moving my feet in such a way that would be perceived as a leg sweep. Rather than attempting to kick their legs, I used their own waryness to push forward from an unusual angle.

“Do!” Musashi said as she tapped a wooden piece on the ground.

The two youngsters stood still for a moment, obviously confused on why such a big man as myself could move in such a way. Too shocked that I had not only managed to somehow slip between the two of them, but evidently surprised that I had also somehow landed a solid hit on their torsos as I passed through.

I saluted them once they turned their heads to look at me. I changed my stance once more, ready for another bout of practice.

“Let's try again. Next time with more gusto, shall we?”

After what felt like hours, I finally returned the wooden sword to Musashi who smiled in return. And without a word Charlie was set down on the grass.

“Daddy… that lady… is she going to work with you?” Charlie asked, looking over at the girl who had shown to be most reliable.

Kneeling down I ruffled his hair and smiled.
“That's up to you buddy.” I said in a reassuring tone.

That's when Musashi stood up and walked over to the two people I had been sparring with and whispered something to the man, before handing something to the girl who was surprised to say the least, before turning back towards me and Charlie.

“Kyō wa chūi-san, go shusseki itadaki arigatōgozaimasu.” Musashi bowed, to which I returned.

“The pleasure is mine.” I stood upright again. “Tyler says I need to interact more with you guys… Even after three years I still throw myself in with the ruskis…”

Nodding Musashi stepped to the side and motioned with her arm towards the girl, who was carrying a pack, along with a very ornate Japanese Odachi with the Sakura Empire talisman where the sheath meets sword.

“This young lady is Tuskishiro Tsumi.” Musashi said in a suggestive tone that caused the girl to scoff and sigh.

Charlie ran right up to the girl and held out his fox plushie.

“You… Cool like Miss Mushi… will you work with my daddy?”

Tsumi gently took the plushie, knelt down and smiled as she began playing with Charlie.  “If it helps me atone for my sins, then I will.”

I turned to Musashi and nodded. “He may be young, but he's smart… “I want him to know his choices matter.”

‘I understand, unlike his sisters he'd have to go through things just to become like them and your wife… and like you he is human which saddens me, because you and him are special. Have you thought about what you'd do if you could physically live forever?” Musashi asked as Charlie played with the first of many for my security team. 

If I could live forever?

Musashi's question had lingered for a few seconds as Charlie was enjoying the attention from Tsumi. I couldn't immediately answer the question as it honestly needed a lot of thought to it. Until I pulled out the picture of myself holding Bonnie who held all three of our children in her arms.

“I do everything and more… I'd cause chaos and create peace. Inflict the most amount of damage, then get on my knees and render aid. But I'd start by opening a pizza place.” I answered truthfully.

“Is that so?” Musashi snickered. “Well I'll gladly be your first customer Lieutenant.”

It used to be a death sentence to many. But through the power of science and community, it became little more than an inconvenience. In this way, it metaphorically represents the other kinds of darkness and challenges in the world - past, present, and future - and our responsibility to rise and meet them.

We will begin with a vegan potluck dinner, followed by a 90-minute program of music and prose about the history of humanity, science, existential risk, and community. It will bring you out the other side hopeful and resolute in the face of the darkness of the world, particularly because we are facing it together.

The event itself is free, and we will have free vegan hot cocoa available. Please bring vegan food (no drinks), potluck-style! Vegan means no animal products whatsoever; no meat, gelatin, dairy, eggs, honey, etc.
There will be other drinks from a full service barista and coffee bar available for purchase.

Well-behaved children are all welcome to attend, but please be mindful of any noise they start to make.

We are holding this at the 'Arts on Broadway' event space, located inside Post Coffee company.

He seemed deep in thought, or maybe sad, and as I walked by him he started talking to me about fishing. He asked me a whole lot about fishing and we got to talking. 

For a little more context, I'm a shorter guy, roughly 5""7 and dress masculine, but I look moderately feminine (painted nails, done up hair, septum ring) He invited me to sit down, I did, very charming older ish guy. I got the vibe that he was potentially cruising, or interested in me. The moment I felt this, I asked him about people close to him. Apparently he has a wife and kids, so in that moment I felt a little safer.

We quickly get into deeper topics of  conversation, such as mental illness, relationships, and not knowing direction in life and things like that. 

This is where things get strange:

I'm visibly shivering and he notices, so invites me to sit in his car, I politely decline, and he invites me to go to breakfast with him around the corner, offering to drive us both over, with all my fishing stuff AND a large beach cruiser bike (which confused me, because his car didn't seem big enough?)I say no to the drive, but I let him bring my fishing stuff so I don't have to carry as much and agreed to meet him there.

I meet him a few minutes later at the breakfast place on my bike, he says he forgot his wallet and he would have to drive a ways to grab it, asked if I wanted to come with. Trying my best to be polite, I mentioned just sitting in a local coffee shop for a few mins to chat instead of getting food since we BOTH didn't have any money on us.

We go to do that, I ask him where exactly he lives and he says ""yknow, just up the street."" (Which was weird because he said he lived a ways away hence why we would have to drive to get his wallet.) Then he got up and shook my hand and told me he had to go. I offered to exchange contact in case he's in the neighborhood because I thought he was nice, he REFUSES up and down and just says he'll probably see me around at some point, and he leaves.

Only realizing now how odd this situation is. I love talking with people, especially strangers, hence why I decided on a whim to hang out with this guy. Part of me thinks this was completely normal, and that he left suddenly because something came up. Part of me believes he left suddenly because he realized I'm too smart to just follow him into his car.

1owbweq,https://tipstor.io/the-secret-ai-revolution-making-travel-addictive/,The Secret AI Revolution Making Travel Addictive,"The travel industry is no longer selling vacations. It’s selling belonging. Forget the predictable loyalty cards or the “earn one free night after ten” routines that feel as stale as airport coffee. The new frontier is travel subscription services. Sleek, seductive ecosystems powered by AI that promise curated wanderlust on tap. It’s the Spotify of escapism, a new way to consume the world one monthly payment at a time.

AI sits quietly at the core, orchestrating data like a jazz ensemble that never misses a note. According to McKinsey & Company, travel companies using AI-driven lifecycle management tools see up to 25% higher revenue growth through precision pricing and hyper-personalized offers. AI doesn’t just recommend the next beach. It anticipates the traveler’s mood, seasonality, and even financial comfort zones, ensuring that every experience feels tailored, exclusive, and instinctively right. The algorithm becomes the concierge, the travel agent, and the memory-maker rolled into one seamless digital organism.

This new ecosystem of subscription travel is spreading faster than a viral TikTok recipe. Companies like Inspirato and eDreams ODIGEO have built empires on the promise of all-you-can-travel memberships, where USD 2,500 a month unlocks a carousel of luxury stays and private experiences. Statista reports that 61% of global travelers now prefer subscription-based services that offer flexibility and predictability, even as travel costs surge. The model is intoxicating. Unlimited adventure without the friction of planning.

Lifecycle management systems, fed by mountains of behavioral data, now dictate which destinations rise or fall in algorithmic favor. AI analyzes historical patterns, flight demand, local event calendars, geopolitical shifts, and reshapes offerings dynamically. When a storm cancels half the flights into Lisbon, predictive models reroute interest toward Seville, dangling spontaneous perks to keep customers happy and revenue steady. It’s not chaos. It’s choreography, and it’s paying off.

Reverse Innovation Labs in Singapore has taken the concept global, testing travel subscriptions first in Southeast Asia before scaling west. Their model integrates gamified engagement loops, points, perks, social badges, that keep users hooked like a Netflix binge. Each swipe, each booking, becomes a data point feeding into the machine, refining the next offer with eerie precision. What used to be seasonal marketing is now a living ecosystem, alive with predictive modeling and perpetual feedback.

The hospitality giants are watching closely. Marriott Bonvoy, Hyatt, and Accor have rolled out their own hybrid subscription models, blending exclusive access with personalized recommendations drawn from AI-driven sentiment analysis. Forbes reports that subscribers to these premium programs spend 36% more annually than non-members. It’s not loyalty anymore. It’s lifestyle ownership.

And then there’s the psychology of it all. Subscriptions remove friction, yes, but they also create a sense of identity. Travelers become part of tribes. Digital nomads with global keys, eco-travelers who plant trees with every booking, foodies who follow Michelin stars through automated itineraries. AI refines these microcultures, ensuring brands speak directly to the soul of each community.

The rise of AI-powered travel subscriptions is more than a shift in business. It’s a reprogramming of human wanderlust. The old thrill of planning has been replaced by predictive intimacy. Every journey begins before the booking, forecasted by models that already know where the traveler will want to go next. The data is the passport now. And in this new world, spontaneity has never been so meticulously engineered.

1owbtqw,https://www.reddit.com/r/poverty/comments/1owbtqw/whats_helping_me/,What's helping me?,"In an effort to feel a little better about my situation. I joked that I started to become good at being broke. I've been doing these little things that have allowed me to clear up most of my debt. I'm still a long way to go from where I want to be, but at the very least things look like they could get better. Keep in mind though. I am single and I have no children to take care of. I do currently have a roommate but she's in a similar position as me. So take some of this advice with a grain of salt. It may not be helpful if you have kids. 

Always carrying a big bottle of water. I have an old one from forever ago. I don't even know the brand name of it because it's been scratched off from years of wear. I'm constantly filling it up. It keeps me hydrated and it stops me from wanting to eat more. 

Protein powders and freeze-dried stuff. I used to do this years ago where I would take protein powder and try to stretch my meals. Sometimes I would put a scoop of protein powder into my coffee or I would make oats for myself and throw a scoop of protein into them. Most protein powders want you to do two scoops, but if you're just eating to survive and not eating to gain weight, just do one scoop. There was a company I used to buy from called Huel, I'm sure there's other kinds But it's basically the freeze-dried food that you add water to and everything softens. But it's the same concept as the protein powder. You don't eat the full serving. You take one scoop and you try to thin it out. Even though that particular brand was designed to be like a little rice dish, a lot of times I would put more water in it so it would mimic a soup. And because it's shelf-stable I would usually buy and use that as my emergency stash if my food budget got tight. Both of those things I mentioned though, make sure you wait for a sale to buy these things. If you're going to do this, you'll get more for your money.

Become an accidental vegan/vegetarian. Hear me out on this guys, it's cheaper to buy beans and tofu over meat especially now. Lentilsand chickpeas have saved me so many times and my family background is Italian and it turns out that the peasant dishes did have a lot of cannelli beans in them. When it comes to tofu, if I buy a block of silken tofu, I can cut it into fours and whisk it (or use a blender if you have one) with some water and that becomes my base for a creamy sauce or soup and I can get some extra protein. I say the silken tofu because that one's usually the cheapest. The more firm tofu is usually a dollar more but that Is more of a meat replacer. Plus tofu freezes pretty well. I've also been using frozen peas, even a small bag by myself. I can stretch it out by throwing a cup full into soups or other recipes. It helps me eat the right vegetables. Plus It has some protein.
 Even if you still want to have your meat here and there. I know some people that have been cooking beans and grinding them up a bit and then mixing them in their ground beef to stretch what they have. Plus I know some people that tell me they only eat meat on special occasions now. 
 
Plan your meals and your fasting. Funny how What we currently call meal prepping was what my grandparents used to call rationing. I can't afford to eat out right now. The most I could probably drop if I'm on the run is on a coffee and depending on what's around that still may be too much for me. 
Going back to what I said about the protein powders and the freeze-dried food. I always keep a little bit of that in a small container in my backpack bc it's stable. If I have protein powder on me I'll either throw it in my water bottle or in some coffee.. If I'm really in a bind I'll put some water in it and I will eat it like it's a pudding (You do what you got to do). 
However, if I did not pack any of those things in my bag and my window of time to eat for the day ends at 9:00 and I get home at 9:30, I don't start digging for food. I drink either water or tea and then I go to bed.
Let me also get back to planning my fasting, usually 3 days a week. I only allow myself to eat from 11:00 a.m. until 7:00 p.m.. I know some people that have done fasting where they only allow themselves the chance to eat within a 4-Hour window during the day. I also know some folk that do it for religious reasons. If you decide to do this, trust me it's definitely worth it. Just don't go overboard and try to starve yourself for several days at a time. Keep it too a certain window of time during the day that you're allowed to eat and when that window has closed, drink water, tea or coffee with nothing in it.
I'm aware some people do this because they want to lose weight but this also helped me figure out if I was really hungry or if I just wanted something to eat because it would give me a dopamine rush. 

If you're short like me, look into kids clothes and shoes. I'm also a girl but I have no shame about buying boys things if they're cheaper. 
I try to buy fairly good quality sneakers because it's cheaper than having my knees give out. But it's easier to do that if it's kids shoes. 
Also when I was unemployed I got into sewing. I never got to a point of making my own clothes but I did learn how to repair the ones I did have. It's definitely a good skill to have that can turn into a creative hobby if you want it. 

Libraries that includes using something like Kanopy and Libby. I don't have any more streaming services. It's just another expense that I don't get to use much anyway. But Kanopy has movies and things for me to watch and Libby has a lot of audiobooks. You may have to wait for some of them, but if it's free, I can wait. The libraries themselves have helped me out when it comes to using the internet, typing and printing things. And when I want to get away but I don't want to spend money, The library is a good place to sit inside. Plus I started to get involved with the library in my area. It turns out there's a lot of events where you can meet people.",4,1763065249.0,poverty,0,1.0,False

I’m looking to make some new online friends, adults only (18+), because I more interested in sharing experiences with people around my age.

A bit about me: I live with five cats who clearly think they pay the rent. 😂 However, I adore all animals and believe each one is beautiful in its own chaotic way. I’d love to have a dog someday, but right now, cats suit my lifestyle way better.

I play football (soccer) almost every evening, it’s my daily dose of cardio. I’m big into fitness too, and working out is basically my cheap therapy. I also love cooking, especially healthy stuff that tricks my brain into thinking I'm a responsible adult. If you’re into fitness, we might just be accountability buddies and can hype each other up 💪

1owbrhg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Createhorrorwithme/comments/1owbrhg/dont_walk_away/,Dont walk away,"They still tell the story down at O’Malley’s, where the beer is cheap and the booths are sticky and the old men have time to pass a tale along until it’s smooth and dark. They call the road “Old Hollow,” though the state lists it as County 43. It cuts off Route 7 like a scar, a two-lane that dives between maples and hemlocks and then forgets itself. If you go by at night you’ll see the sign, half-rotted and thumb-nailed, and maybe you’ll think twice. That’s what people do now: they slow, they picture a cop in a uniform like something out of a rusted photograph, and they tell the kids to stay home. Stories travel that way...practical little superstitions dressed in rumor.

I don’t know the story like the old men do. I know it because I lived it. Because for one jagged night I was the punchline and the punchline nearly sank me.

It was late October. Vermont was doing that thin, hard-glow thing it does before deep cold sets in: maples on the shoulders of the road looked like they’d caught fire and forgot to go out. I’d come down from a week of maintenance at the radio tower. Cold coffee, long days, greasy hands. 

My sister texted me on Route 7 to say the world was fine and she’d see me tomorrow. I told her I’d be back and that I’d swing home the “shortcut,” County 43. I’d taken it before; it shaves a little time off, and you get the smell of wood smoke for free. Which to me is relaxing, kind of a meditation session, without the annoying music. 

The GPS dropped signal soon after the turn. That’s not rare there. The towers slump like old men and the phone shrugs. I laughed at myself, tossed the phone in the cup holder, and cracked the window for the cold. The road tightened into a canyon of trees, and the air changed. It became drier, a little thinner. The radio was off. Just the tire hum and the maples whispering.

I was doing fifty when the lights came up behind me.

Red and blue. Not an LED smear. They threw old light, thick and honest, and it painted the road in bands. I eased to the shoulder, the gravel pitching under the tires. The cruiser that eased up behind me had a long hood and a heavy feel, like a thing that had seen winters without heaters. It was older than most fleet cars: square lines, a chrome bar across the grill that looked like a relic. The engine idled low, patient. When the officer climbed out he stayed in shadow. He let the light from my headlights fall across his boots and the badge at the rim of his hat, but he didn’t step fully into the glow. It made him seem like a thing that belonged at the seam of the world, where night hems into dark.

“Evening,” he said. His voice was gravel and the kind of small-weathered courtesy you get from men who’ve worked long nights. “Do you know how fast you were goin’?”

I slid the registration across. “Fifty, maybe fifty-five. Didn’t mean to...”

“This stretch gets quiet,” he said. “People forget. They forget there are other things out here.” He had a chew of tobacco in one cheek; the scent of it came through the open window. Damp, a little sickly, like a house in winter.

He kept to the shadow while he took the information. When I asked his name he tipped his hat, slow, like a man showing respect to a thing he thought was better left alone. On his badge the letters were faded, but I could make out “State” and, lower, the old seal.

“You all set?” he asked, handing back the paperwork. He didn’t write a ticket. He didn’t make a show of his authority. He just stood there ,too steady, too...robotic. Like in the movies when you see the first Zombie where they barely move but kept looking at you.

“Yeah. Just passing through,” I said. My voice felt thin, like the inside of a throat after shouting.

He paused, like he was listening to something I couldn’t hear. Leaves, the far-off sluice of a brook. He then he said, “There’s been… incidents on this road. Folks take their shortcuts and the dark takes them. Keep it slow. Don’t follow lights that aren’t yours.”

It should have been a quick admonition. It should have been the ordinary thing: a nudge, a flashlight, a move-on. But his eyes were too old. Not the color—just old. He sounded like someone who could recite a roll call of names and dates by heart, like he had watched the ledger of the road and kept it tidy. I watched him step back toward his car, and the lights behind him drowned into the trees. For a second I thought I saw the crown vic’s reflection in the maple trunks like an afterimage.

When I pulled back onto the road I told myself it was nothing. A roadside heritage patrolman. Someone keeping local ghosts on a leash. It’s what people tell themselves: that there’s a reason to keep living, and if there’s a story you survive it. But the road doesn’t forgive curiosity. It shapes it.

Ten minutes later I saw the cruiser again.

This time he stood in a clump of birches where the shoulder sagged, hat in hands like a man hoping to hide. The car sat half under a low-branching maple, lights dimmed to a ghostly halo. He wasn’t watching the road. He was watching the dark beyond the trees, the place where highway sound died and the night made a bowl.

I passed him slow. He didn’t turn. He didn’t wave. Just stood there, a man made of shadow and the small blue of old police lights. My heart bumped a beat and then another. I kept the speed low, headlights cutting wet ribbons, and I had this ridiculous thought, that if I kept driving far enough the world would right itself and the man would fade like a roadside apparition.

At the bend near Mile Marker Nine the road goes down like a throat. There’s an old stone wall, and the culvert gurgles always in spring. I’d taken that curve a dozen times sober as a bell. Tonight the curve felt like a jaw.

My headlights snagged on something in the ditch; a tangle of metal, partly under water. For a moment I thought it was an old barrel the kids had tipped, then the shape resolved into a car. My car. The same make. Same rust spot by the rear fender. Same duct tape on the bumper to hold the cracked trim. The world tilted.

I killed the engine with a hand that trembled. Gravel slipped under my boots when I stepped out. The air tasted like pennies. The thing in the driver's seat didn’t move. I circled the car slow, as if the right pace could solve the problem.

It was me.

There, slumped over the wheel, one hand fallen on the dash, mouth slack. Pale like something that had been bleached. The glass was spiderwebbed where the impact had caught it. I told myself it was a mannequin. I told myself a hundred little denials until something knotted and I could no longer breathe.

A crackle of static came from the trees behind me, from the direction of the cruiser. The old officer’s voice threaded it, thin and steady. “You shouldn’t be here,” he said. “You should have stayed.”

I stumbled backward like somebody just hit me. My hands found the hood and I felt the faint grease print my palms left on the cold metal. The smell of smoke—old smoke, tar—rose like damp bread.

Then someone’s hand landed on my shoulder. Modern, warm, not the dry weight of anything spectral. I turned and a patrolman in reflective gear was squinting at me, his light in the ditch like a small sun. Behind him more modern cruisers now ringed the shoulder, blue strobes polite and precise. “Sir? You alright?” he asked. His voice had the clipped calm of dispatch-trained men. I tried to answer but my mouth wouldn’t form the words.

They led me to a blanket. Paramedics fussed. Someone asked what happened, what my name was. My name left the air like a soap bubble, and I couldn’t find it. A woman—my sister—came running down the shoulder hair wild, mascara streaked. Later she’d tell me she got the call from a neighbor, that I’d been found near the overturned car. She said she threw open the porch light and drove as fast as she could.

In the ambulance there was a shrillness like metal on glass and a simple fact: my head hurt in a way that kept the world thin. The doctor muttered “concussion,” “trauma,” “you’re lucky.” Lucky. It’s a word they bandage with in hospitals, as if survival is a ribbon you wear, not a hole you keep wanting to fill.

Later, sober in a room that smelled of antiseptic and old coffee, I tried to stitch the night together. The police report said I’d slid off Old County Road 43, struck the stone wall, then rolled down into the culvert. My car was pinned upside down in the shallow water. Witnesses said a woman walking a dog found me staggered on the shoulder, muttering, and called 911. I had a bruise blooming on my temple and a bandage on my head that flagged my hair to one side. Luke, the patrol sergeant, said it was as if I’d walked away from the wreck.

I walked away.

The phrase stuck like a burr. I’d left a mangled car with myself inside or beside it. That part was fuzzy, a thin smear of missing film. For some reason—shame, maybe, or that human survival trick they teach you in trauma—my head had boxed the night up and taped the lid on. The body remembered. The mind hid.

When they showed me the photos later—cold, clinical shots mounted in the report—there was my car in the ditch, roof crumpled, mirror dangling. And in the shadow of the trees, if you squinted at the glare, you could imagine the old cruiser with its tired lights, parked like a thing that had been waiting a long time. The captions said “no officer present at scene.” The reports from the modern cops were neat: I had been found. No sign of external interference. No witnesses who could locate an old cruiser.

But the old officer? He kept slipping into the corners of my days. People would nod, and their eyes would fold like maps. “Dupuis,” they’d say. “1979. Hit in a head-on. Drunk driver. Never made it.” They played it like a moral punch: don’t drink, don’t speed, don’t be careless. 

That was the useful part of the legend. But what unnerved me was the memory of the man in shadow who smelled of tobacco and spoke like a ledger. He’d said things in the dark that my medic’s vocabulary couldn’t explain. He’d said, “You should have stayed,” and it was a sentence that lived like a stone in the throat.

Therapy helped in the slow ways therapy does. I sat in a light office with a woman who had warm hands and a voice like a steady thermostat while she asked, “What do you remember?” I tried to give her a time line—tower work, the coffee with foam, the turnoff, the badge. But every bit I handed over felt crumbly. I told her about the cruiser that looked like it had walked out of a history book. She listened and then didn’t smile. “People repress things they can’t hold,” she said. “Sometimes the brain wants to protect you from the memory itself.”

It annoyed me, that language. Felt like a lawyer hiding behind words. I wanted to say: I saw him. He was there. He followed me. He watched.

A few nights later I drove Old County Road 43 again, this time with a buddy named Tom who insisted on coming along. The air changed where the blacktop began to narrow. My breath left white clouds in the headlights. We took it slow. I watched the tree line like a man peering at a wound. When we passed the spot of the crash, the world changed on the instant we entered it. The sound sucked out: you could hear your shoes on the pedals, your heartbeat, the leaves breathing. The light bent wrong, like you’re staring through hot glass.

Tom chuckled and said, “You see figments again, buddy?” He didn’t mean cruelty: just the easy joking of people who love the living to laugh in the face of ghosts.

We slowed under the boughs. That’s when the old cruiser appeared, not in the ditch but at the lip of the woods, hatless this time, front turned toward us. The lights were faint pale, like moth-eyes. I felt the car’s temperature drop, and the radio hummed with a static that matched the rustle in my scalp.

The man stepped out of shadow and this time I could see his face, weathered, salt-scarred, eyes small and set. He looked like a photograph left too long in the sun. He didn’t speak. He only watched us and then lifted an arm, not to wave but to mark a boundary.

Tom swore under his breath and started to go, but the cruiser’s lights lunged a little brighter and I swear the air tasted of iron and old tobacco. The old man's mouth moved once, like a man talking into his sleeve: “You ran.” It was not a judgment as much as a ledger balancing. My skin crawled because that’s when the memory rushed back in a jagged, terrible flood: the spin, the wall, the impact, the smell of oil. The bloom of pain. The opening of the window to a night sound that was not quite mine. I remembered crawling free while the car settled on its roof and the water kissed the glass and the world was a soundless sheet.

I’d walked away.

I’d gotten up, blood leaking from my temple, and I’d walked to a place where lights did not shine and I hid myself from the bright truth. I had come back later—staggering to the wreck to find the hulled shell and the silence and the modern cruisers, and I made the story tidy: a miracle, a rescue, a blank like a bandage.

Dupuis, if that’s what that shadow was—looked at me with something that wasn’t compassion. It was an inventory. A thing counting names. He folded his hat and tucked it to his chest like a soldier who’d kept vigil for years.

“You should have stayed,” he said again, just under his breath.

Tom grabbed me by the arm and pulled at the wheel. The moment broke like glass and the world rushed back: my foot on the gas, the rumble of the engine, the bob of my headlights down the road. When I checked the mirror the cruiser was gone like it had never been there.

People tell versions now. Some say the old cop is a guardian who keeps the road honest. Some say he’s a ledger, a phantom who collects names. I know a different truth. The night kept the important thing: if you run from what you did—not because you’re a coward but because your body can’t stomach the knowledge—then the night will follow you to remind you. The old man in the hat is the memory you refuse to fold.

I go by County 43 sometimes now, not to chase the thing but to see if the dark lines up with my fear. The trees still breathe in those particular ways where the cruiser sits on the edge of sight. Now, when I come back from a late shift and the air tastes like metal and burnt sugar, I slow and watch my mirror. If the old light comes up, I don’t feel the panic I used to; I feel the sight of a ledger that needs balancing.

I don’t know if Dupuis is a ghost or just a story we tell to keep the young people careful. I only know what I felt when he said, “You should have stayed.” I know what it took to let the memory in and to stop running from the kind of night that keeps tally.

If you drive Old County Road 43 and you see an old cruiser and a man at the trees, don’t stop to wave. Don’t try to prove him wrong. Drive through and when you’re safe, call someone and tell them what you saw. Don’t tuck your nights away in boxes. The ledger collects the things you leave on the road. It wants to balance them.

The story lives on because we keep telling it—some use it as a warning, some say it’s a ghost tale to keep teenagers off the fast lanes. For me, it’s a different sort of caution: don’t walk away from the wreck you made. Sometimes the road will bring it back to you anyway.",1,1763065105.0,Createhorrorwithme,0,1.0,False

He’d said things in the dark that my medic’s vocabulary couldn’t explain. He’d said, “You should have stayed,” and it was a sentence that lived like a stone in the throat.

Therapy helped in the slow ways therapy does. I sat in a light office with a woman who had warm hands and a voice like a steady thermostat while she asked, “What do you remember?” I tried to give her a time line—tower work, the coffee with foam, the turnoff, the badge. But every bit I handed over felt crumbly. I told her about the cruiser that looked like it had walked out of a history book. She listened and then didn’t smile. “People repress things they can’t hold,” she said. “Sometimes the brain wants to protect you from the memory itself.”

It annoyed me, that language. Felt like a lawyer hiding behind words. I wanted to say: I saw him. He was there. He followed me. He watched.

A few nights later I drove Old County Road 43 again, this time with a buddy named Tom who insisted on coming along. The air changed where the blacktop began to narrow. My breath left white clouds in the headlights. We took it slow. I watched the tree line like a man peering at a wound. When we passed the spot of the crash, the world changed on the instant we entered it. The sound sucked out: you could hear your shoes on the pedals, your heartbeat, the leaves breathing. The light bent wrong, like you’re staring through hot glass.

Tom chuckled and said, “You see figments again, buddy?” He didn’t mean cruelty: just the easy joking of people who love the living to laugh in the face of ghosts.

We slowed under the boughs. That’s when the old cruiser appeared, not in the ditch but at the lip of the woods, hatless this time, front turned toward us. The lights were faint pale, like moth-eyes. I felt the car’s temperature drop, and the radio hummed with a static that matched the rustle in my scalp.

The man stepped out of shadow and this time I could see his face, weathered, salt-scarred, eyes small and set. He looked like a photograph left too long in the sun. He didn’t speak. He only watched us and then lifted an arm, not to wave but to mark a boundary.

Tom swore under his breath and started to go, but the cruiser’s lights lunged a little brighter and I swear the air tasted of iron and old tobacco. The old man's mouth moved once, like a man talking into his sleeve: “You ran.” It was not a judgment as much as a ledger balancing. My skin crawled because that’s when the memory rushed back in a jagged, terrible flood: the spin, the wall, the impact, the smell of oil. The bloom of pain. The opening of the window to a night sound that was not quite mine. I remembered crawling free while the car settled on its roof and the water kissed the glass and the world was a soundless sheet.

I’d walked away.

I’d gotten up, blood leaking from my temple, and I’d walked to a place where lights did not shine and I hid myself from the bright truth. I had come back later—staggering to the wreck to find the hulled shell and the silence and the modern cruisers, and I made the story tidy: a miracle, a rescue, a blank like a bandage.

Dupuis, if that’s what that shadow was—looked at me with something that wasn’t compassion. It was an inventory. A thing counting names. He folded his hat and tucked it to his chest like a soldier who’d kept vigil for years.

“You should have stayed,” he said again, just under his breath.

Tom grabbed me by the arm and pulled at the wheel. The moment broke like glass and the world rushed back: my foot on the gas, the rumble of the engine, the bob of my headlights down the road. When I checked the mirror the cruiser was gone like it had never been there.

People tell versions now. Some say the old cop is a guardian who keeps the road honest. Some say he’s a ledger, a phantom who collects names. I know a different truth. The night kept the important thing: if you run from what you did—not because you’re a coward but because your body can’t stomach the knowledge—then the night will follow you to remind you. The old man in the hat is the memory you refuse to fold.

I go by County 43 sometimes now, not to chase the thing but to see if the dark lines up with my fear. The trees still breathe in those particular ways where the cruiser sits on the edge of sight. Now, when I come back from a late shift and the air tastes like metal and burnt sugar, I slow and watch my mirror. If the old light comes up, I don’t feel the panic I used to; I feel the sight of a ledger that needs balancing.

I don’t know if Dupuis is a ghost or just a story we tell to keep the young people careful. I only know what I felt when he said, “You should have stayed.” I know what it took to let the memory in and to stop running from the kind of night that keeps tally.

If you drive Old County Road 43 and you see an old cruiser and a man at the trees, don’t stop to wave. Don’t try to prove him wrong. Drive through and when you’re safe, call someone and tell them what you saw. Don’t tuck your nights away in boxes. The ledger collects the things you leave on the road. It wants to balance them.

The story lives on because we keep telling it—some use it as a warning, some say it’s a ghost tale to keep teenagers off the fast lanes. For me, it’s a different sort of caution: don’t walk away from the wreck you made. Sometimes the road will bring it back to you anyway.",1,1763065075.0,DarkTales,0,1.0,False

Should I celebrate his birthday?,"This is my husband and I’s first married birthday together. Mine is in October and his is in November. We just had a baby this year, so this would have also been both of our first birthdays as parents. He makes big promises about gift giving and celebrating me and I have not seen that to be true at all. 

For example, he made a huge deal about Mother’s Day this year when I was pregnant and told me he was going to do something ‘big.’ Well, that morning, he went to a coffee shop to work and didn’t even bring me back a coffee. No breakfast made for me, no card, no ‘happy Mother’s Day,’ no nothing. 

Then, we had our son. I had a horrific pregnancy and nearly died. I’ve been suffering postpartum, too, and just found out I am in heart failure. He had told me the day I pushed him out that he was going to get me a ‘super nice push present’ and then never did. I had told him I wanted a ring with our son’s birth stone. Didn’t happen.

Then, a week before my birthday (mid October), he asks what I want for my birthday. I just told him nothing. He pushed and said he wanted to get me something, so I told him again I would have loved a ring with our son’s birthstone. I gave him ideas and steps he could take to get it. He then asks again, a DAY before my birthday, what I wanted. I told him the same thing again, but then told him I felt like an afterthought at this point and didn’t need anything. We also didn’t plan to do anything for my birthday. As expected, we did nothing, and it turned into a huge fight. 

We have had other major problems since then. Like major problems. My son was also born prematurely because of all my health issues, so I have been navigating an entirely new identity and have not felt appreciated at all. His birthday is next week and I had planned a surprise party for all of his close friends who live far away to show up for him. I also got him very nice gifts. My thought was to show him how I set an expectation for him and I fulfill it, but I just get discouraged thinking about what happened and it makes me want to call it all off. 

Has anyone else experienced anything like this? Obviously there are deeper issues here, but I want to know if other people have recovered from this internally. TIA

tl;dr - First married bday together. My husband sets high expectations and did nothing for my birthday. Been a rough year for me (had a baby, now in heart failure, etc). His birthday is next week. I planned a surprise for him with gifts, but am now questioning it. ",5,1763065039.0,marriageadvice,9,1.0,False

1owbp2l,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1owbp2l/sea_salt_and_paper_storytime/,"Sea, Salt and Paper storytime","A few weeks ago, I bought Sea Salt and Paper on a whim after reading comments about games that would be similar to Jaipur, but better. My wife and I really enjoy Jaipur so I thought I would give it a try.

I’m glad we did, because we really enjoyed the game, and my 4 year old daughter specially enjoyed helping her mum choose one card from my hand whenever the shark and swimmer were played (for those who don’t know the game, there are some cards that you can play together for “special effects”, one of those pairs is the swimmer and the shark, which lets you rob a card from one of the other player’s hand). After playing a bunch, we decided to give it a rest and left it at the coffee table for future plays.

Fast forward to the next weekend, my 4-year-old daughter asks me to play a game “with the little sea creatures in the cards”. As you can imagine, I was really happy that she wanted to play the game with me, so I immediately agreed. To my utmost surprise, she grabbed the cards and set up the game perfectly. Then proceeded to take a turn, making comments and repeating the type of things my wife and I would say whenever we were playing. I was helping her a bit here and there, but generally, I was having a blast just looking at my little girl playing cards as if she was a grown-up. And she was not only playing whatever, she was making plays and aggressively looking for the swimmer and shark, her favorite play in the game. I throw an Octopus to see if she is even paying attention (I know she has one because she told me some turns before haha) and she immediately smiles and picks it up (the Octopus is part of a set that you collect for points).

A couple of plays after that, she gets really excited and almost forgets to discard one of the cards she picked up. She starts humming the “Jaws” theme song, as I did whenever I had the shark and swimmer while I was playing with her mom. She puts the pair down and proceeds to steal one of my 2 mermaids. Her laugh is maniacal when she sees what she stole (for those who don’t know the game, the mermaids are special cards that if you collect the 4 of them, you win the game, normally a game of 2 is between 2 and 4 rounds, so winning the whole game by collecting the 4 mermaids in one round is something very unlikely).

You may see where this is going. At this point we both have many cards, and I’m tempted to just end the round, but my girl is having so much fun that I decide to continue. She is up next, and after getting 2 cards from the deck, she gets really excited, again. Again, she almost forgets to discard one of the two cards she picked up. Again, she starts humming the “Jaws” theme song, and yes, again she steals my last mermaid, collecting the 4 and immediately winning the game.

She jumps from the sofa and does a crazy victory dance, I laugh and just can’t believe it. My little girl just beat me at a game fair and square, and in the most amazing way possible. I laugh and laugh, my daughter comes to me and I join her dance.

Since then, we have been playing almost every day. Her grandma had to learn the game, just to play with her, and they are both also really enjoying it.

Today I was working at home and I heard my wife, my mother in law and my daughter, all laughing hysterically. I went to see what was going on and what do I see? The three of them seated at the table, playing Sea, Salt and Paper, my daughter just stole a mermaid from my mother-in-law and is having a small celebratory dance, showing her mum what she got from grandma.

By now I’ve heard you’re dating someone else and that you’re mad I’ve moved on, ‘so fast.’

I believe your hypocritical words were, ‘you need time to heal.’ When you were the one who hurt me in the first place.

So Ex, I have something to say to you, but you don’t deserve to read this privately. These words below are words you don’t deserve to hear or I’d put it on my YT:

To Ex,

You left me broken, shattered, heartbroken, grieving the loss of the relationship and potential loss of my dog alone.

You dare be angry I’ve moved on? How dare you! He was there for me, hugged me as I used his shirt as a tissue, as I put myself down and hated on myself, when I felt like the lowest human being in the world simply because I wasn’t good enough for you.

Guess what, ex? He showed me what love actually is.

Love isn’t walking on eggshells, wondering, worrying you’re going to scream in my face about how my chronic pain is ruining your life, love is cuddling me, is handing me a hot water bottle, is making sure I can handle it and being there for me.

Love isn’t being lied to and gaslit, being made to feel insane or small because I’m not the perfect person you want me to be.

My partner does not lie to me, does not yell and scream in my face that it is all my fault that I am disabled, that I have limits others don’t have.

Love is not you, ex, love is a warm blanket, a cup of coffee and a loving smile, love is my heart skipping a beat when I see him, not sinking into despair.

Thanks to you, ex, I can see what I never want in a relationship and that is you, your impossible standards and moved goal posts, your lies and manipulation, toxicity and cruelty.

You say that no one will ever love me because I shouldn’t be loved? I say you’re wrong for I’ve found love, not just in my partner but in myself and love is beautiful, it is a power I never knew I had.

When you left, I fell into the pit of despair you were hoping I’d fall in, I fought hard to not text or call, beg you to come back, I refused to play your game and instead I became the person I was always meant to be, a better one without you.

I know my strength, my love and my self-worth and it is not made by you, it does not come from nor is it validated by you, you’re a selfish idiot who broke up with me because I wasn’t perfect enough for you and that’s fine, I am perfect for myself and that’s what matters whereas you, you will never be perfect in my eyes.

1owbove,https://i.redd.it/lg16t287131g1.jpeg,Talk me out of it… or in to it!,"I have a Paperwhite Signature edition (11th Gen)

It’s fine and there’s nothing wrong with it but I’m so tempted to get the newer Paperwhite. Mine is quite slow which is frustrating as I remove most of my downloads and am using a fraction of space anyway. I love the size in my hands and wouldn’t want a smaller one.

I see the benefit of having one upstairs and one downstairs but I tend to carry it around with me so I don’t know how much good I’ll get out of two, it’s more because mine is quite slow even though it’s fairly new (about 18 months)

Couple of points for consideration: I can’t read at work because I’m a teacher. I am an avid reader (read about 100 books a year).

Talk me out of it… or into it!!!
