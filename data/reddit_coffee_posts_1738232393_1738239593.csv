1idlnr6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1idlnr6,I am building my dream bike! Long post ahead,"About 10 months ago, I picked up this retro MTB— a Kona Koa— from Facebook Marketplace. It was in pretty good condition and came at a decent price.(check the last picture) My goal was to upgrade it and build my dream bike, but I had two main rules:

	1.	Use only second-hand parts.
	2.	Do all the work myself.
I didn’t quite stick to the first rule (more on that later), but I fully succeeded in the second!

The Build

I replaced the entire cockpit:
	•	The bars and stem came from a guy on Facebook Marketplace, who told me they were from a Specialized.
	•	From the same seller, I also picked up this purple Univega fork, which happened to be a perfect fit for the frame.
	•	The grips are ODI, and I bought them from Amazon along with a new cassette.
Next, I wanted to convert it to a 1x drivetrain to follow the trend. I started searching for a square-taper crankset that would work with one of the chainrings sold by Stridsland. I found a Deore LX crankset on DBA (Danish eBay), since my previous crankset was riveted and couldn’t be downgraded to a 1x setup (shoutout to r/xbiking people for helping me figure that out!).
Finally, I purchased the chainring, bolts, and stem cup along with the iconic RSDW sticker from the legendary Matias Stridsland.

The Final Touch

Two days ago, I finished building the bike myself at a community bike workshop in my city. While I was there, I found an amazing pair of Superstar Components pedals. In return, I gave them my old crankset and pedals.

The Experience

This project was such a rewarding experience. I learned a lot—not just from YouTube, but also from the community and the people I bought parts from. It’s amazing to see how much knowledge people are willing to share.
A huge thank you to everyone who helped along the way! If you love biking, I highly recommend taking on a project like this.
Ps: I still have a child dream to have MTB with disc brakes but this will be the next step for this bike.

1idlne6,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingthruit/comments/1idlne6/blocked_still/,Blocked Still?,"## Writer's Block? More Like Writer's *Bleh*. Let's Fix This:

**Feeling uninspired? Procrastinating like a panda on a treadmill? Fear not, fellow wordsmith! Let's outsmart this block with ninja tactics:**

**Environment Hacks:**

* **Shower Epiphany:** Write steamy scenes (figuratively, please) in the shower. Guaranteed inspiration (or at least clean ideas).
* **Nature Nudge:** Write under a tree, feeling the breeze whisper secrets (or scold you for slacking).
* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

**Challenge Your Inner Critic (Shut it Up):**

* **Write the Worst:** Write the absolute worst scene imaginable. You'll be so embarrassed, you'll write something good to redeem yourself.
* **Cliché Challenge:** Write a scene using every writing cliché in the book. Then rewrite it, destroying clichés with your brilliance.
* **Mirror, Mirror:** Stare into the mirror and have a deep conversation with your reflection about your story. Bonus points for dramatic monologues.
* **Future You Fury:** Imagine your future self, successful and published, berating you for procrastinating. Write a scene about their disappointment.

**Bonus Tip:** Reward yourself with something ridiculous for every completed scene. Like a dance party to the Macarena or wearing a lampshade as a hat. Embrace the absurdity!

Remember, writer's block is just a temporary hurdle. With a little wit and these offbeat techniques, you'll be back to churning out words like a caffeinated squirrel on a sugar rush. Now go forth and conquer that blank page! (And maybe wear a lampshade for good luck.)",1,1738239345.0,writingthruit,0,1.0,False

I probably only bought this printer because I thought it would make me look like a \~creative\~ person, but it's actually getting way more use than I imagined.

Here's my thoughts on it.

# First Impressions

Im not exactly the scrapbook type. More like the let’s let these memories rot in iCloud forever type. Do I really need to print photos in 2025? Probably not. But do I want to? 

Absolutely. 

It’s like buying a waffle maker. you don’t need it, but once you have it, you’re committed to a lifetime of waffles. Or, in this case, glossy 4x6 photos of your dog wearing sunglasses.

# My Favorite Features

**Print and charge functionality.** The dock doubles as a phone charger, which is either genius or completely unnecessary, depending on how often you forget to charge your phone. (For me, it’s genius.) 

**4PASS technology.** The printer uses a four-layer color process with a laminating finish, making the photos fingerprint-proof and water-resistant. It basically means my toddler can drool on them, and they’ll still look good.

**Border vs borderless photos.** You can choose between borderless photos for a sleek, modern look or bordered photos if you want to scribble notes like it’s 2005. Personally, I went with borderless because I’m fancy like that.

**Augmented reality app.** The Kodak Photo Printer app lets you add filters, frames, and even AR effects to your photos. It’s like Instagram, but with more commitment because you can’t just delete the photo if it looks bad.

**Low photo cost.** Kodak claims this is the most affordable way to print photos at home. And honestly, it’s cheaper than driving to Walgreens and dealing with their self-service kiosk, which is basically a test of my patience.

**Bluetooth connectivity.** The printer connects to your phone via Bluetooth, which is great unless your Bluetooth is as unreliable as my Wi-Fi. (Make sure your phone is fully charged before pairing, or you’ll be stuck in a loop of frustration.)

# Pros

* **Convenience.** Printing photos at home is actually really neat. No more waiting in line at the store, love it.

* **Photo quality.** The 4PASS technology delivers crisp, vibrant photos that look like they came from a professional lab. My dog has never looked better.

* **Durability.** The water-resistant, fingerprint-proof finish means your photos can survive spills, sticky fingers, and even the occasional coffee mishap or something.

* **App features.** The Kodak app is fun to use. The AR effects are a nice touch, and the filters are less cringe than some of the ones on Instagram.

* **Pretty small.** The printer is small enough to fit on a desk or shelf without taking up too much space. It’s also lightweight, so you can move it around easily.

# Cons

* **Docking connector.** The dock only charges your phone, it doesn’t transfer data. This kinda sucks if i'm honest.

* **Software issues.** The app can be glitchy, especially on Android. It also asks for way too many permissions, which is annoying.

* **Noise.** The printer is a bit louder than I expected. It’s not unbearable, but it’s definitely not whisper-quiet.

# Final Thoughts

I'd say it's great for anyone who loves printing photos but hates leaving the house. It’s also great for people who are constantly running out of phone battery (hi, it’s me). However, if you’re looking for a professional-grade printer or someone who hates dealing with apps, this might not be for you.

Overall, I’d say it’s worth the investment if you’re into tangible memories and convenience. Just don’t expect it to solve all your life problems, unless your only problem is a lack of glossy dog photos.

1idll5r,https://www.reddit.com/r/mokapot/comments/1idll5r/is_it_too_much_of_caffeine/,Is it too much of caffeine?,"Hello! 

I’ve had moka pot for about 5 years and I usually had 4 cups size (240 ml or 8.11 ounces) and what do I usually do is pour it all into a cup that has 350ml or 11.83 oz and fill it up with around 70ml or 2.37 oz of milk or water (+-10ml or 0.34 oz) and I usually have 2 of those daily, sometimes 3 and that’s my maximum. 

Lately I’ve been thinking how much of caffeine I am actually drinking daily and I’ve stumbled over a discussion that one cup has around 70mg of caffeine, which makes it 240 per my serving? 

This got me asking myself whether I am drinking too much of coffee and have more than recommended dose of 400mg coffee. 

Am I really drinking too much of caffeine? Or does the milk or water keep it under the recommended dose somehow?

Please note I don't want give my identity or location. 

I recently visited the open space at my local library and wanted to share some honest feedback, especially for those considering sending vulnerable adults or individuals with specific needs.

1. Limited Support for Vulnerable Adults:
While the open space is intended to be a welcoming environment, there isn’t much support for those who might need it. If you’re thinking about sending someone with specific needs, consider whether this space provides the right level of care and attention.

2. Lack of Trained Staff:
The staff are generally friendly, but there doesn’t seem to be enough trained personnel to fully support vulnerable individuals. This can leave those who require more structured support feeling somewhat neglected or unsure of where to turn for help.

3. Silence Can Be Overwhelming:
The space is often too quiet, which can worsen anxiety for some individuals. Without any background noise or even the typical hustle and bustle of a coffee shop, it can feel isolating and uncomfortable. The silence, combined with sometimes meaningless conversations between participants, can leave people feeling disconnected or restless.

4. Toxic Positivity and Lack of Room for Authenticity:
There’s a strong presence of toxic positivity in this space, where there seems to be an expectation to always remain upbeat or avoid expressing negative feelings. It can feel like your frustrations or struggles are dismissed, and you’re treated more like a “service user” than a person with real emotions. It becomes difficult to voice frustration or express how you truly feel without feeling shut down.

5. Colouring Pictures Can Feel Patronising:
One of the activities offered is colouring pictures, which some may find patronising or demoralising. It doesn’t always feel like an appropriate or meaningful use of time, especially for individuals who may need more intellectually stimulating or engaging activities to feel valued and productive.

6. Limited Activities or Resources for Engagement:
The space doesn’t offer much in terms of meaningful activities or resources. A lot of time is spent colouring, which many individuals might not find helpful or engaging. It can feel like you’re just sitting there with little to do, which may not be suitable for someone who needs more structure or something more stimulating.

7. A Shift Away from the “Recovery Mindset”:
There’s a constant focus on “recovery” or “distraction”, which can feel limiting. People may benefit from just being able to have a conversation about things like TV shows, music, or even other interests that aren’t centred around “healing”. If there was more room for casual, everyday discussions or even more engaging activities like group discussions around shared interests, it could make the space feel more welcoming and less about feeling constantly “in recovery”.

8. Less of a Hospital Waiting Room, More Natural:
The environment often feels like a hospital waiting room, which can be off-putting for those already feeling anxious or stressed. It would benefit from a more natural, relaxed atmosphere where people are seen as individuals with feelings, not as patients or service users. A setting that feels more like a community space rather than a clinical environment would likely create a more positive experience.

9. Improve Resources and Activities:
Investing in better quality stationery and more engaging materials could significantly improve engagement. Providing activities that go beyond colouring books—such as games, art supplies, or even simple conversation starters—could help individuals feel more connected and invested in the space.

10. Improve the Coffee Facilities:
A simple addition like improving the coffee facilities could go a long way. Having a better variety of drinks, along with a comfortable place to enjoy them, could help make the environment feel more welcoming and less clinical. This would also create a more relaxed atmosphere where people can take a break, have a conversation, or just enjoy a cup of coffee in peace.

11. Inconsistent Availability:
At times, the space isn’t readily available or may be difficult to access, so it’s worth checking beforehand to see if it will be open when you need it.

12. Double standards 
If you are person struggling with mental health you are often treated as if you are lowest clas citizen of the world to compared to those with learning disability challenges. There is essentially one rule for them and one rule for you. As the people tht go there often don't take responsibility and blame their ""autism"" ""I have learning disabilities""

I am not trying to be offensive to this community or discriminatory but it's not fair we have rule they have another.

At times, the space can feel as if double standards are being committed 
Overall, while the open space might work for some, I’d recommend considering whether it’s the right fit for individuals who may need more structured support, meaningful activities, or a more engaging environment. For those who struggle with anxiety or need something more than just quiet space, there may be better alternatives to explore.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Solo travel in Albania offers a unique opportunity for self-discovery and adventure. With stunning landscapes, rich history, and vibrant culture, Albania is becoming an increasingly popular destination for solo travelers. However, to fully enjoy your experience, it's essential to navigate the local culture and ensure your safety. Here are some tips to help you make the most of your journey.

### Cultural Awareness

Understanding the local culture is crucial for any traveler, especially when exploring solo. Albanians are known for their warmth and hospitality. Here are a few cultural tips to keep in mind:

- **Learn Basic Phrases:** Knowing a few words in Albanian can go a long way. Simple greetings like ""Mirëdita"" (Good day) and ""Faleminderit"" (Thank you) can help you connect with locals.
- **Respect Traditions:** Be aware of local customs. For instance, when visiting a home, it’s customary to bring a small gift. Dress modestly, especially when visiting religious sites.
- **Dining Etiquette:** If you’re invited for a meal, it's polite to try everything on your plate. Albanians appreciate good manners and hospitality in return.

### Safety Precautions

Your safety should always be a priority while traveling solo in Albania. Here are some essential tips:

- **Be Vigilant:** Keep an eye on your belongings, especially in crowded areas. Use a money belt or a secure backpack to protect your valuables.
- **Stay Connected:** Share your travel itinerary with someone back home. Regularly check in via messaging or social media to keep loved ones updated.
- **Use Trusted Transport:** Opt for official taxis or ride-sharing apps rather than unmarked cabs. Public transport is generally safe, but like anywhere, it's wise to remain cautious.

### Exploring Alone

Albania boasts breathtaking landscapes, from pristine beaches to majestic mountains. Here are some activities to consider during your solo adventure:

- **Hike in the Albanian Alps:** For the adventurous traveler, consider hiking in Theth National Park, where you can enjoy breathtaking scenery and encounter warm, welcoming locals.

### Finding Accommodation

When traveling solo, choosing the right accommodation can enhance your experience. Consider the following options:

- **Hostels:** They are budget-friendly and offer a chance to meet other travelers. Many hostels organize group activities, making it easier to socialize.
- **Guesthouses:** Staying in a local guesthouse provides a more authentic experience, allowing you to connect with locals and learn about their way of life.
- **Airbnb:** This can be a great way to find unique places to stay. Look for listings with good reviews that indicate a welcoming host.

### Stay Alert

While Albania is generally safe for solo travelers, it’s wise to trust your instincts. If a situation doesn’t feel right, don’t hesitate to leave. Engage with locals, but also be cautious about sharing personal information. Avoid isolated areas when exploring alone, especially at night, and keep your phone charged for navigation and emergencies.

Solo travel in Albania promises an engaging and enriching experience. By embracing the culture and prioritizing safety, you can enjoy all that this captivating destination has to offer. Remember to be open, adaptable, and respectful, and you'll create unforgettable memories. So pack your bags and get ready for an amazing adventure in Albania!

Maybe also our dive bar?

How do you feel about your identity development post-baby? 

When I first had my child, I felt sheer panic at the loss of my career. I am a postdoc, and got 8 weeks off. I had to struggle with lab politics right after having the baby. We assayed some data I collected and a student took a first author position from me because ""I would be too busy"" and we wanted to ""Get it published soon"". That experience made me pretty paranoid about getting back to the grind, and in retrospect it alienated me from my role as a mother. I have had a good run writing big grants, being on the job market, and publishing high impact papers (my first Nature portfolio pub came out before the one I had to fight for author over, wah wah). 

I'm now at a crossing point where I could lean hard into my career (at the expense of time with my 18 month old and likely the chance of having a second) or I could coast and explore new options. If you're an academic you'll know what I mean. I have an offer for a second postdoc in the UK I've tentatively accepted, though I'm still on the tenure track job market and have a fly out final round in Feb. 

For so much of my life I identified with my career. The thought of losing that paper, the thought of not getting a tenure track position, it would fill me with actual anxiety about my self worth. I find that feeling waning now. I have bonded more deeply with my daughter and the career sacrifices that seemed completely worth it (move anywhere for a job, move to ANYWHERE for a tenure track job) now seem deeply selfish. I feel unmotivated.

Do I still care about my work? I do, but not more than I care about her. Work feels suddenly like a means to an end, not a calling or vocation. Not something I am obliged to do (I used to feel this deeply as my work has a health equity component). 

  
For those of you in careers that you identified with, that shaped your vision of who you are and what you are worth, how has that changed (or not) with motherhood? Did you end up where you expected? Tell me about your path, drink is on me.",2,1738237865.0,workingmoms,1,0.75,False

# First Impressions

I was living in blissful ignorance until I started steam cleaning. Sure, my bathroom tiles were sporting a lovely shade of grayish-black, but hey, isn’t that just haracter? Then one day, my kid pointed at the floor and said, “Mom, why does our house look dirty?” Ouch. Kid logic strikes again.

At first glance, it looks like a cross between a vacuum cleaner and a futuristic coffee machine. Could this little gadget really tackle years of accumulated filth without making me want to cry? Or worse, would it make me feel guilty for letting things get so bad in the first place? Well, it's both.

# My Favorite Features

**17-piece kit.** Each piece serves a purpose, like the angled brushes designed to attack grout lines and the squeegee attachment that's great for glass shower doors. There's also microfiber cloths and basically everything you might need.

**Powerful steam cleaning.** The steam blasts through grease, grime, and bacteria like nobody’s business. According to science (and the box), it kills 99.9% of germs. Pretty nice.

**Chemical-Free.** No harsh chemicals = no weird smells lingering in your house for days, which is something I really appreciate.

**Compact and portable.** This thing weighs less than my cat, which is impressive considering how powerful it is (the cleaner, not my cat).

**Large tank.** You can clean multiple rooms without constantly refilling. 

**Ease of use.** Assembly took me approximately five minutes, including the time I spent reading the instructions upside down. Once heated, the controls are straightforward, just point and shoot. Literally.

# Pros

* **Versatility.**  This thing can clean anything. Floors, tiles, grout, upholstery, windows, you name it. 

* **Eco-friendly.** No chemicals means no guilt. Plus, it’s better for the environment and your lungs.

* **Pretty fast.** It heats up in five minutes, and the controls are so simple even my mom could figure it out (and he still thinks Wi-Fi is magic).

* **Results.** I didn’t even know grout could be white.

* **Durable.** It feels solid.

# Cons

* **Steam output.** I read some people found the steam isn’t as powerful as they’d like. I didn’t have this issue, but if you’re looking for a jet engine-level blast, this might not be it.

* **Cord length.** The cord is decent, but if you’re cleaning a large space, you might need an extension cord. Or just clean in sections.

# Final Thoughts

I'd say this is great for anyone who wants a cleaner home without resorting to industrial-strength chemicals. But if you live in a minimalist loft with zero grout lines or stains, maybe skip it. Also, if you hate gadgets, this probably isn’t for you.

Checked a couple but the end result was a 40% increase in the cost.  Did I mention I’m a little (lot) ADHD?  I was supposed to go by the agency and pay yesterday but I didn’t make it.  Completely forgot until I randomly drove by.  I was probably subconsciously holding off on paying for as long as I could.

Today is 100th day of school and I guess my F7 is dressing up.  I offered to sew her a dress and was quickly reminded I don’t know how to sew.  They dress up like a 100 year old.  I couldn’t find grey hair color spray either.  I told her she needed to figure out her outfit last night.  She didn’t.  I have a feeling it is going to be a fun morning.  

I have a widow friend that sells slices of pie she makes at a shop Tuesdays and Thursdays.  I really want to go visit and eat some pie but it’s hard to get there since it’s a 30 drive from my house.  I may wait at the insurance agency after dropping off kids and then drive to the pie shop an hour away for a slice of pie.  Or not.  Seems like a lot of work when I write it down.  

Either way, I need to get up and moving in a second.  Lots to do.  And I am dying for a cup of coffee.  And a toothbrush.  

But this lady’s pie is all homemade from scratch.  I almost never get homemade pie because everyone around here makes pecan pie from scratch and everything else is a can or frozen.  Or whatever but not from scratch.  

All I want is a slice of pie and a cup of coffee and a book to read.  Give me that for 30 minutes and I would be happy today.  

I hope you have your pie today.  Something sweet that you miss and rarely get.  A special treat that can’t casually be obtained regularly.  I want it to be uncommon.  I hope you allow yourself to have that “slice of pie”.  We all need a treat now and then.  You too.

Everyone is welcome to write here, but let’s keep it positive.  We all have plenty of negative in our lives.  ",1,1738237402.0,widowers,0,1.0,False

A big thank you to my fellow redditor, [u/tig33](https://www.reddit.com/user/tig33/), who loaned me the buds for a month so I could review them, measure their frequency response and record some sound and ANC samples, which I've encapsulated into a YouTube review [here](https://youtu.be/HvjvxV55_s4). I'm not a 'trust me bro' type reviewer - I try to make it as objective as possible so if you do want to hear what the ANC is like in a busy coffee shop, hear what they sound like out of the box and hear how effective the mics are in different, busy real-life scenarios, feel free to check that out.

For those of you that prefer text-based reviews - here are my thoughts. I was testing the Chinese version - the global version has since been released, and it has a few additional features, notably Google Fast Pair. In reality, in my experience it doesn't make a huge difference.

**Here are the pros:**

* Improved sound over the Buds 5 Pro. Bass is tighter and trebles are slightly more refined. Sound stage is bigger, imaging is about the same
* Compact, portable charge case and solid build quality in general
* Minimal occlusion effect (for me, at least)
* Impressive call noise reduction & possible to switch to transparency during a call
* Amongst the strongest ANC in its price category
* Multipoint works seamlessly - no need to press pause on your primary device
* Quick charge feature is excellent - the buds charge extremely quickly in the case and make up for the slightly-lower-than-average overall single use playtime with ANC on (around 4.5 hours with calls and features such as multipoint switched on)
* Mappable touch controls
* Lots of codec options (LDAC, LHDC and Xiaomi's own proprietary codec)
* Spatial audio & different 'use modes' - movie mode, for example

**And the cons:**

* Connectivity issues spoilt the experience
* No wireless charging
* No gaming mode and latency is worse than its competitors
* Whilst call noise reduction is strong, you do get occasional 'crackles' across your voice in busy scenes
* Battery life is OK, but falls short of competitors (Realme, OnePlus, Earfun)
* Touch controls are very prone to accidental touches. Swipe for volume is on the outside of the bud, which is not really practical compared to how OnePlus do it
* Moderate battery life (4h ANC on, 6h off)
* Whilst they are one of the few buds outside the Apple ecosystem to offer head-tracking, the effect is much less obvious

In summary, I did like the Buds 6 Pro a lot. The unboxing is basic and simplistic but they are nicely designed, with a smoky, gunmetal grey case and matching look and feel to the buds. The buds are short with a large oval shaped nozzle. This results in, for me at least, decent stability and minimal occlusion. The outside of the buds has a mirror-polished finish, looking similar to QCY's MeloBuds Pro. The ergonomics are generally pretty good.

The **ANC**, at maximum strength level, is probably only beaten in the sub-$100 category by the Soundcore Liberty 4 NC, and did actually outperform it at certain frequencies. The transparency mode is OK - you have a couple of toggles within the strength 'bar', the furthest of which gives better clarity but also places a fair amount of white noise into the presentation.

Whilst **sound** has improved - don't believe the 'triple driver' hype. The drivers are reasonably cohesive, but push them too hard and you will notice a bit of distortion if you move too far outside their range. You get an 8-band custom EQ and a bunch of presets. If you want to use those presets as a template to autoeq, I uploaded all the measurements to squiglink - [here](https://regancipher.squig.link/?share=Harman_2019_IE_v2_Target,Redmi_Buds_6_Pro_ANC,Redmi_Buds_6_Pro_AEB,Redmi_Buds_6_Pro_AET,Redmi_Buds_6_Pro_AEV).

In terms of sound 'quality', there are few tangible differences between the majority of the professional Chinese brands when you're spending $50 upwards. It isn't like IEMs, where you can manipulate airflow and use extremely high-sensitivity driver types because you have a small shell within which to house a PCB, battery, chipset, mic array and a variety of sensors. Most buds are performing about the same in metrics like group delay and harmonic distortion, which are probably the closest aligned measurements that are easy to retrieve to determine the actual quality of the sound.

The differences the average user perceives as 'sound quality' is in the tuning, for which we all have our own personal preference. The Buds 6 Pro roll off the subbass and focus the energy in the midbass. The mids lift slightly and the upper mids and midtrebles are a bit subdued, with added air in the treble extension. It makes for a rather inoffensive sort of sound across a medium staging, where nothing really jumps out, including the vocals which kinda blend into the overall sound. The bass is still quite palpable but it's punchier than previous Redmi offerings - it's good for EDM and techno but it makes for a bit of congestion if you're listening to rock or metal. They are particularly usable for long listening sessions where the percussion doesn't sound too scratchy.

The Redmi have lots of decent features, like a usable spatial audio mode, different 'scene' options to improve immersiveness when watching movies. They do feature a head-tracking mode, but the effect is so subtle you would be hard pressed to notice it. They include wear detection, which can be toggled on and off, and it works quite reliably.

For voice calls, the Buds 6 Pro are amongst the best in their price range. They outperform other popular options at their price like Earfun Air Pro 4 and Soundcore Liberty 4 NC. The only problem is, whilst their noise reduction is effective, it produces a 'crackle' sound across your voice when the scene gets particularly busy. Whilst it doesn't affect the clarity or coherency of your voice, it can be slightly off-putting for the receiver. Compared to another strong performer, the Realme Buds Air 6 Pro, the noise reduction is better and your voice isn't as soft, but the Realme don't have the crackle.

There are three main drawbacks to the Buds 6 Pro - **latency**, **touch/swipe controls** and **connectivity**. I measured the latency on my Sony Xperia 1 IV at 278ms, compared to Earfun Air Pro 4 at 248ms (132ms with Gaming Mode), Realme Buds Air 6 Pro at 165ms (98ms with Gaming Mode) and OnePlus Buds 3 at 183ms (72ms with Gaming Mode). Redmi have not included a low latency mode, putting them at quite the disadvantage for casual gamers. Thankfully, video synchronisation is fine, but if you're using them for first-person shooters you will notice the difference.

The touch controls are generally OK and customisable in the Xiaomi Earbuds app, with some exceptions (you can't change press and hold to anything other than ANC mode toggle and you can't change swipe to anything but volume control). Unfortunately, they put the swipe sensor on the outside of the bud, so you have to angle your arm backwards to use it. Try doing that in public and not getting any funny looks! Thankfully, you can change single touch to volume control as well, but the implementation isn't as reliable as OnePlus or Huawei.

The final issue, and the deal-breaker for me, is the connectivity issue that has plagued previous Redmi releases and still persists. With my Sony Xperia 1 IV, the buds connect the left and right channels separately. I assume this is partly because it's seemingly how LE audio works, and secondly to try and combat the issue of master/slave configurations resulting in the left bud battery draining quicker than the right and causing a mismatch over time. The problem is, many Android phones don't seem to be able to cope with this and I got frequent disconnections of either both buds or a single bud, and the only way to fix it was to put the buds back in the case and in some instances to reboot my phone as well. I don't get these issues on any other buds - even the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3, which also connect using LE in the same way - do not cause the same problem. I didn't get the issue on iOS (and I suspect it would not manifest as much on Xiaomi hardware) but it would be remiss of me not to mention it.

Hopefully this short summary gives you an insight into some of the pros and cons. If you have any questions, happy to answer them the best I can.",1,1738237294.0,Earbuds,0,1.0,False

I've managed to get back into the swing of things and although not perfect I'm glad I was able to pick up from where I left off. My team have been so amazing and supportive and said they were so proud of how I handled my first shift back and said my mum would be so proud.

Prior to the widespread use of smartphones, most folks would prefer in-person communication. Since, we’ve evolved to spending more time with a phone in hand, chasing para social relationships.  

This evolution has had devastating effects on global tree coverage: as most humans only have 2 hands, they find themselves forced to dedicate one of those hands to holding the phone - a responsibility they were previously freed from, as you don’t need to hold the face of the person you’re speaking to.  

Now this all has changed. We now need 3 hands to hold the phone, the coffee, and the cigarette. As it’s quite difficult for the common person to have a third hand, and some of us aren’t blessed enough with a third leg to balance a phone on, a need was created for a platform to rest one of the 3 primordial items on: a table.  

Tables are most commonly made of wood. Wood is most commonly found on trees. iPhones and Steve Jobs have inadvertently generated never seen demand for wooden tables which contribute massively to deforestation of the Amazonia and significant disruption to the native fauna and flora.

This should be an interesting discussion, lol. It's written in a way to be as neutral and objective as possible so may come off as a bit dry.

I will give you 3 pieces of information, separately, so we can know:

* Your genuine response as person A (late 20s to mid 30s)
* Your genuine response as person B (late 20s to mid 30s)
* What happened and your opinion of it

**Story:**

1. Person A is sitting on a couch doing some work, on their laptop.
2. Person B is on the same couch, eating food (it's chicken), leaning over the food bowl on the coffee table in front of them.
3. Person A needs to plan some business meetings for the week, and wants to know when person B is busy so that it doesn't interfere with their plans.
4. Person A turns to Person B and asks them about their availability for the week.
5. Person B has food in their mouth, puts their hand up to signal to wait, and continues to chew.
6. Person A waits.
7. After a few seconds, person B puts more food in their mouth and keeps chewing.

Question 1: As person A, what do you think, what do you feel, and what is your reaction as person B puts more food in their mouth and keeps chewing, after they told you to wait?

**The Response:**

>!After seeing Person B put more food in their mouth and keep chewing, person A reacts by yelling at Person B: asking them what they're doing, or asking for an answer.!<

Question 2: Was it reasonable or understandable >!for Person A to yell at Person B!<?

Question 3: As >!Person B!<, how would you respond?

**Some Context:**

>!Person A had voiced several times, over several months, in previous scenarios, that they feel person B does not take Person A into consideration and frequently makes person A feel unimportant or like their feelings or time doesn't matter. !<

>!Person A's reasoning for the yell is that Person A reacted to Person B putting more food in their mouth after being told to wait, as they thought Person B was just going to keep putting food in their mouth until they were done eating. They also felt Person B could have just finished chewing and given an answer or responded that they needed more time or that they would answer later, before putting more food in their mouth. That's what Person A thought Person B was going to do when Person B put their hand up to ""wait"", initially.!<

>!Person B feels Person A is overreacting and they didn't deserve to be yelled at.!<

Question 4: With this context, was it reasonable or understandable >!for Person A to yell at Person B!<?

Question 5: With this context, >!as Person B!<, how would you respond?

There's a LOT of detail here, and I'm sharing so that you can ask questions and hopefully compare notes with your own startup.

**Background:** I'm a 9x Founder with 5 exits (this wasn't one of them!) over 31 years. I spend all of my time helping Founders understand how to deal with these kinds of disasters so I not only have my only experiences, I've lived through the darkest times of a lot of other Founders as well.

# The Concept

In 2006 I Founded a company called **Affordit**, which was designed to create a simple weekly payment program out of everyday e-commerce purchases. Think ""Xboxes for $19 per week"". Yes, it's almost exactly what Affirm/Klarna is today, but this was before them (you can be too early...)  
It was a phenomenal business idea that I completely fucked up.

# The Funding

Initially, I planned on self-funding the business (I had some exits before this) but upon moving to Los Angeles from Ohio, I started to meet some angels and VCs, all of whom would later form the foundation of what we know of now as ""Silicon Beach"". Many of the most prominent at the time - Mark Suster (now UpFront VC), Mike Jones (now Science, Inc), Dave McClure (now 500 Startups) were incredibly supportive and provided the very first bit of startup capital, many out of their own pockets.

I want to pause there. These meetings didn't go ""kinda well"" - they went ""un-fucking believably well."" This has never happened to me since, and I do this for a living. When I met Mike Jones for the first time, I wasn't even looking for capital, and he said, ""How can I invest?"" He introduced me to Mark Suster the next day, who said, ""How can I invest?"" who I then got connected to Kamran Pourzanjani (founder of PriceGrabber, sold for $300m), who asked, ""How can I invest?""

You have to understand - I hadn't met any of these people before, and they were offering me checks immediately, and they were all ballers in their own right. I was blown away, and apparently, I was fundraising.

That led to a round from Bessemer, Founder's Fund, and Crosscut VC - all great firms. It was a ""big seed"" back then at $1.2m, which is peanuts these days. But at the time, we had the most prominent angels in town, and we were ""the company"". That would be as good as it would ever get.

# The Business

It turns out when you sell Xboxes for $19 per week, people want them. A lot of them. We sold $500,000 worth of Xboxes in our FIRST MONTH with a tiny Adwords campaign. Did we own $500,000 worth of Xboxes? Absolutely not. We were driving around town in a rented minivan, going to every Best Buy and Circuit City (different era) we could find, loading it up like we were ready for the apocalypse. It was insane.

If you're an angel investor (or any investor) and you hear that the startup you just invested in did $500,000 worth of sales in its first month, you lose your shit. I was getting every possible introduction you could possibly get to every VC there possibly was. If you were a VC in 2006, chances are I was in your office telling you a very plausible story about how this is going to be the next... well, this is funny - what is actually now Affirm or Klarna.

Everything was on FIRE. Everyone wanted me to speak at their event, I was throwing big parties on the rooftop of my Santa Monica building, and I was on top of the world. We were getting competing term sheets like crazy.

# The Market

Heading into 2007/2008, two things happened that we simply never saw coming. First, this little investment bank called Lehman Brothers melted down as part of a larger financial crash. All of a sudden, ""FinTech,"" especially those that were essentially high-interest rate sellers (like us), were in the crosshairs big time.

Overnight, we went from everyone throwing term sheets at us to being toxic. Every VC pulled their term sheet, which was a bigger problem because we had long since run out of money (remember that tiny raise and all of those Xboxes we had to buy?), and I was funding this thing out of my own pocket (never do that). I was 10000% sure that we were getting funded, so I thought I was going to MAKE money on the float. I did not.

# The Model

A second thing happened while this thing was heading to the land of dumpster fires. We had to start collecting all of those weekly payments. Well, it turns out, the people who can't afford to pay full price for an Xbox were the same people who didn't have $19 per week.

You want to know who our number one customer archetype was? No, not 20-year-old college kids. It was single moms trying to buy a present for their kids (remember that $500k in the first month - that was Xmas). I grew up with a single mom and never met my father till later in life. You want to know how excited I was to be collecting from single moms like mine trying to provide something special for their kids? Zero. Less than zero. NFW.

I figured this was fixable with different customer targeting, but something inside me knew that I had painted myself into a corner of a business I didn't actually want to see succeed but had committed to so many people so publicly that it should.

# The Wind Down

If there's anything I want you to take from this story, it's not the funding or the business concept - it's how it ended. I was humiliated. I had nothing but success in my previous ventures, and this was a very public failure. I don't know how many of you have been in a community of folks, but when you see people at coffee shops and they deliberately avoid you, not because they don't like you but because they are embarrassed for you - it sucks. That's a tiny microcosm of the feeling, but for those of you that have lived it - you get it.

I spent every waking hour for the next 18+ months trying to resurrect this company (unsuccessfully), and I learned a few powerful lessons. The first is that no one ever tells you, ""Hey, it's time to go home."" They will let you run yourself as far into the ground as you can go. It's not their fault - they have no incentive to stop you. That's your fault.

The second issue is that there is a point in our startups where we are no longer trying to succeed - we're simply trying to NOT fail. That works never. The moment we're in that death loop, we've already lost. Who do you know that wants to work for or invest in a company whose goal is to ""not fail""? No one.

The third point is that all this time I built up this horrible nightmare of what it would mean to shut this company down. The giant fights with disappointed investors, the press coverage, the looks on my co-workers' faces. I agonized to avoid this fate, shaving years off my life.

You know what happened? Nothing. Not a goddamn thing. I sat down with our lead investor, and he looked at me and said, ""Yeah, we wrote this thing off like 2 years ago - we were shocked you were still running it."" (OK, would have been useful information 2 years ago, but...) You know what the press said? Nothing. Because no one gives a shit. My team had other jobs before I even had a chance to tell them it was over.

# The Takeaway

At the time, the fall of that company was the worst failure I had ever had in my life. I was depressed, humiliated, and financially took a major hit. I had no idea how I would ever recover. That was 17 years ago, I was 33 years old.

Do you know, in the time that it took me to write this story, that's about as much time as I've ever thought about it since? I can barely remember what happened beyond what I just wrote. It was at best a blip in my career and a depressing footnote. 99% of my present life today (family, career, life) hadn't even happened up until that point in my life.

The losses suck, but it's a moment in time. What matters is what we do after it.",44,1738235248.0,startups,9,0.98,False

However, he's good at sweet-talking and somehow always avoids consequences.

CHAPTER III

No one goes to the City

The wagon he embarked on was inside a sad, torn and dissheveled thing, disfigured by the past rages of commuters, and abandoned by any semblance of maintenance. Most of the seats had had their stuffing and springs toyfully pulled out of them, and the walls
were densely matted with graffiti, through which snaked the faint outlines of pictoral dicks. Bardhyl was just content that whichever dark souls progressively degraded his train were cordial enough not to share his commute, and instead confined themselves to the
shadows of his world.

He looked out the window as the train took speed and snaked through the country side. In the field below could be seen the gentle pace of a tractor. No one sat there of course, but the roof has been dismounted and in the drivers seat had been awkwardly manacled a large robotic arm, the kind of which would normally be used on a factory production
line. The arm did its’ best to operate the tractor, hesitantly rushing between the steering wheel and gear shift, oscillating the machine down an imperfect line in the field. The sight of this always tended to cheer Bardhyl, as he, like every past day until now,
contemplated the robots’ inability to effectively replace man, a meditation that marked his commute into the City, maker and giver of all things.

The City gradually came into view, appearing as a pustulation of concrete and steel, becoming increasingly regular and dense. Bardhyl‘s commute for the past year had been a solitary thing, and his ‘people spotting’ had become an increasingly impossible task
from his carriage window. Slowly even the lights from the houses in the hillside had extinguished, until he knew for certain that he was completely alone in traveling to the City - perhaps the last worker ever to commute there.

The travel to the center was composed of two
parts - first the expanse of a thousand useless edifices and things built long ago, a prelude composed of missing roofs, windows and doors. After this came the living core, a Wagnerian triumph to a black monochrome steam punk’s nightmare. The core of the
city was most conspicuous for it‘s smooth, reflective surface, which was in fact a crawling mass of nanomites (also black). This was also why the City was principally abandoned - the nanomites determined who could freely pass.

These robots littered the streets like sand - their origin and purpose had been to once deliver free medical service to whomever walked upon them. Naturally you would have had to walk barefoot, and if the specks could get a whiff of a cancer or heart murmur on your palm, then they would let you sink in
amongst them, five meters deep, holding you faster than quicksand. Post recovery, you would rise to the surface, like a capsized corpse washed ashore. The process was said to quadruple the average human life
span, and had initially attracted thousands to its’ healing shores.

But then, as many others, Bardhyl had heard
that some of the patients had purportedly slipped into the dunes and never resurfaced. Reassurance had been given that this was a perverse speculation on those who required longer treatments, for which reason they
simply stayed longer underneath, but the damage was done, and increasing numbers decided to avoid the City altogether. Bardhyl tried to take neither side of the polemic, but he could not help wonder if the darker shadows that gently drifted beneath the ground were the shades of some trapped human form. 

This was perhaps why he held a total aversion to walking barefoot on the sands, and rather wrapped his shoes in several layers of plastic bags. He would be damned before those little shites got a sniff of his varicose veins, mild hernia and onset of glucoma.

As the train’s pace began to slow down, Bardhyl fixed his protection to his shoes. The speaker garbled an incomprehensible message, and then the doors opened, allowing the black sand to seep onboard. He
carefully overstepped this wave and continued on through the station into the City itself.
After already no more than a minute‘s walking,
he suddenly heard the sound of someone running. He froze, caught unawares as he had believed that the city was well and truly empty. 

Someone was running in his direction, the footfalls dampened by the nanomites. A figure appeared through the smog, but it
was not human. It was a thing, a bizarrely tinkered contraption, made up of two slender robotic legs upon which had been cruelly welded a heavy set antique TV.
The thing ran with less purpose and more under the struggle to compensate the weight of its‘ load, the screen jumping between static and black. This too perhaps had been the handiwork of those barbarians,
always at work some place just beyond Bardhyl‘s horizon. The thing paid no attention to him, running past into a side alley. And then silence once more - a brief encounter, a bizarre revelation better left unknown, punctuating his solitary trail.

In his distraction, he had allowed the sand to
seek its‘ way over his plastic: He shook his leg in a panic and knocked it against the tip of a lamp post for good measure. The empty socket of the lamp post resonated, and Bardhyl who preferred inattention, quickly walked on in embarrassment. Roth corporation was an impressive architectural design - it was the perfect emulation of the screwed up piece of paper upon which Mr Roth the founder had written his pre-eminent inspiration for global automation. His son, the second Roth, had
found it curled up within his father‘s palm on his deathbed, and the story goes that rather then unfold and read it, he confined it to a glass case, from which its‘ legend was naturally spun to greater lengths over
time. The building even copied the fragments of words that could be spied within the folds of the paper, but none had ever managed to successfully read it in full.

At the entrance to the building sat a metallic
sphere, which had in fact fallen from its’ mount some months prior, and lay sunken midway in the sand. A pale blue bubble drifted to the surface where Bardhyl placed his hand, and instantly the entire building emitted a symphony of clicks, like a box of Geiger
counters dropped into a radioactive mine shaft. A piece of the paper unfolded: the entrance to his place of work.
 
Inside, the space had been appropriated by and adapted exclusively for robots: they slid in tubes like fungi and tip toed with spider like legs through holes in the walls, crawling over a dense mat of ill managed wires. Only the stair case had been begrudgingly left as a vestige of the office past, or as an acknowledgement to Bardhyl‘s particular ‘human’ accessibilility needs. Conveniently, it stopped at the
third floor, precisely where his desk was situated.

The floor itself was pitch black, but he knew the way off by heart. He navigated through the darkness and in amongst the hum of ventilators, feeling his way to the small switch of his desk lamp. He was placed, as
he called it, in the pod room. All around him hung gigantic pods like bulbous wasp nests, vibrating incessantly, no doubt engaged in some task beyond his mortal comprehension. 

He took off his hat, scarf and Trenchcoat, folding them neatly over the back of his
chair. The time was now 8:05 - he had achieved another day on time much to the relief of his crippling anxiety, and could now peacefully sit and contemplate the absurdity of his position for the remaining eight and a half hours of his working day. The realisation and horror one would expect to torture him daily, was only imperfectly managed by
Bardhyl. He had been accustomed to his situation by gradual steps, each a momentary shock followed by his inevitable capitulation. Habit and time had worn down the sting of any worthwhile realisation on his condition, and besides, the small candle of pride that
he held above others, that he indeed still did go to work, kept him going, if only to appear slightly better off than his peers.

The first pod had been fixed to the ceiling
almost twelve years ago. Management had made it the centrepiece of the open working space - a work of art, beautiful to behold but simultaneously purposeful in furthering the corporation’s productivity. The CEO had made a quip about turning the world of work upside down („because the pod is upside down“ someone had pedantically whispered to Bardhyl‘s left, obviously eager for his colleagues to share in the mirth of their superior. “Looks like a ball sack“ another whispered over his right shoulder). At the time, he could not recall whether any explanation
had actually been given over what the pod was intended to do.

The common apprehension was that it was
listening to everything, and reporting on up. It‘s most particular feature was the spherical aperture at its‘ base. It was a hole big enough for someone to crawl up inside. But as the pod hung too close down to the ground, you would have had to crawl on your back to get a good look inside, and naturally office decorum
forbade such a manoeuvre during working hours. Even now, as he sat alone, Bardhyl had still not succumbed to his curiosity and stuck his head under the pod. Perhaps it was because he had been visited by a recurring dream where he was walking into the
office to retrieve something forgotten (an umbrella, hat, scarf...the details varied from night to night). As he came into the open space, there on the floor would be the CEO, looking up directly into the pod and laughing without restraint, the laugh of a man suddenly unburdened from all sorrow. He would
glance in Bardhyl‘s direction, then lift his head into the pod, and begin ascending into it. As fast as he could run, Bardhyl could never get there in time to free him.

He clung to his legs as they kicked him furiously back, and were swallowed upwards. The dream ended, but the image would remain with him, and so any time he felt like looking, he would be struck with the sight of the painful laugh of his former boss, a laugh full of abandonment, a face through which
emotion poured out like the impossible wrenching of a wet cloth.

On Bardhyl‘s desk were arranged a series of toys and souvenirs. It had been a former supervisor‘s idea that all the employees bring in their ‚totems‘: small objects that carried spiritual and emotional weight. Bardhyl had preserved them ever since in a drawer,
and only recently had relocated them amongst his papers. Each totem held the potent recollection of a colleague, and for some was the remaining bridge in his memory to them.

The plastic t-rex painted in a repulsive bright green and red had belonged to Kyle Maffin, a senior cost controller. Upon presenting it to the group, he had claimed to have fished it out of a forgotten toy box from his childhood, and that this piece had always been his favourite. The piece was less than exceptional - mass
produced and sold at every corner shop and gas station. Perhaps it betrayed a childhood of want, or the man simply was of humble taste. Everyone had felt slightly sorry for Karl as he had shared it, and the ancient beast, the lizard tyrant king looked almost pitiful in its plastic imitation. Decidedly, Bardhyl had thought, Kyle‘s parents had been mean not to at least
procure a beast of higher quality. Amongst the other ornaments that littered his desk
stood:

One picture of a cat he had never heard mention,

One wind up tin fire truck driven by
monkeys,

One clay figurine, obviously made by a
child, of a figure whose face lay merged in
its‘ stomach, the words ‚I love you
mummy‘ etched in an arc above its backside,

One silver fork, two prongs missing, 

And one travel sized bottle of whiskey.

Bardhyl‘s own memento was a very large and
sharp safety pin. He remembered his father had given it to him as a testament to his trust in his responsible young boy. The pin was long enough to reach the heart, his father had said, words which produced nothing but pride in his infant self at being awarded the safe keeping of such a dangerous object, but words also which later on did not ring in his memory with
the paternal love that he thought he had so cherished. Thus surrounded, so to speak, by his memento mori, Bardhyl wandered, adrift on a desk sized raft in a tempest made of industrial ventilators, his present
moment an unfolding and refolding of the past.
The silver fork had always stood at the coffee
machine - lamenting over the inefficiency of his colleagues, yet supporting it with a comic fatality. The whiskey bottle was perpetually sick, and in his rare appearances affected the image of a man overcome with work, hounded and hunted down by it like as a fox by pack of mad dogs. The tin fire truck had always
been at his desk before Bardhyl arrived, remaining without exception until after the last man had left.

But the picture of the cat had been his friend,
albeit from afar, a person whose congeniality volubly announced a jovial co- conspiracy to assure all on lookers that at least one good man was here alive in this office. „Don‘t make the rest of us look bad, Mr Imron“, he would quip whilst passing his desk, or „make sure the project for the board gets delivered on
time Bardhyl“, he would pat him on the shoulder, perhaps suggesting that he saw straight through Bardhyl‘s ruse, and all the more kept it safe between them by getting the office gossips off his scent.

This and other such remembrances Bardhyl
indulged in, poking at the embers of his nostalgia. And yet he could not help but equally observe that he felt absolutely no pain or regret in the absence of his colleagues.
His reasoning for this was simple - his former
life among men had been one punctuated by a rhythm of probable gestures and feints: the hanging of a coat, the clinking of a spoon carried in a mug to the coffee machine, the furious underlining, highlighting and
crossing out of lines upon paper later to be shredded, the chattering of keyboard keys and the performative answering of phones. All this was the sound of people working, but only the sound and nothing more. The real people here had always been absent - they had
left their selves behind with their loved ones, and here paraded their shells. As such, their disappearance was unremarkable, more like the melting of a ghost beneath a floating cloth than the loss of anything real.

Now, albeit without people, there was a similar
regularity to the things that scuttled, the curious optic assemblies that peered at him from round corners, the murmur in the pipes and the snap of the current in some stray wires. They perhaps did not drink coffee,
but they were similarly filled with their quirks and habits, some of which he had grown strangely accustomed to. And in turn he gave back as good as he saw: to the platonic shadows and shapes of existence
played out against his cave wall, he matched with his own appearances and feints. To him work had never been anything more than the stillness of a stick insect, moving in a forest of eyes. The eyes perhaps had changed, but they continued to watch him, and so he
continued to perform, and pretend to work.
His position however afforded him a curious
vantage point over his mechanical peers: through constant observation they took on the qualities of peculiar characters, and small gestures that would appear meaningless to any outsider, would to him stand out as a strange and meaningful deviations from
their productive cycle. It had been hard to humanise his human peers -that had been an a priori condition he was expected to see in them. But these robots seemed all the more relatable precisely for the fact that he had gifted them their relatability. But of all these characters, outlined in the finest
and inconspicuous of mechanical gestures, the most perfidious and unbearable to Bardhyl, was the inbuilt monitor to his cantina tray. Like every available space
in the building, the lunch hall had been repurposed as a data warehouse, an open space with tall ceilings, now filled with enourmous black server towers. It was
here that Bardhyl came to eat, for the meals delivered by the electronic caterer.

The insidious nature of this cantina tray could
no doubt only be made apparent by the keenly
persistent observer. The actual screen was dead, but the small array of LED lights remained operable - three blue dots that would flicker with random intensity. One day, as Bardhyl was peaceably masticating on
something that resembled a perfect cylinder of a baked sweet potato, he fell into the habit of
murmuring out his thoughts. And as he did so, the three lights turned on in succession as if registering the variation in a sound wave. He stopped, and the lights ceased, he spoke, and they registered the cadence of his speech once more. He barked and they shot up in frenzy. He whispered and a single blue eye
blinked hesitantly. Surprised by this behaviour, he did something he would live to regret - he asked the cantina tray its‘ name.

Normally such a question would have been
drowned out by the whirring ventilators of the servers, but this time they all simultaneously plunged into a sudden and irregular silence, to which his words rang out through the large space: „What‘s your name?“.

Instead of responding in playful kind, the lights
went out. Then, after a few moments, the space was drowned once more in the din of the ventilators. At the time, Bardhyl dismissed a feintly perceived offence as the paranoia of his regular isolation. But in retrospect, he could now see it as the first of many insults he had suffered at the twisted humour of this
cantina tray. On the second occasion, the tray -normally paired with his name, which would display above the menu selection once placed on the conveyor belt - had generated the name Barbara instead. This name was all the more displaced as Barbara had been the name of a project manager who had kissed him one year at an office party. They had never spoke of it afterward, but he had always wondered - did her soul too similarly stir every time he passed her, or had she forgot him the moment their lips had parted? When he
often wondered anxiously whether he had lived well, or had wasted his time in the dead end of a career, staring up at the ceiling in the evenings after work, his mind would go back to Barbara as a consolation, and a regret.

To think that this kiss had somehow been seen by the scheming miniaturised intellect that inhabited this tray confounded him. His better sense tried to reason it as pure coincidence, a happenstance that he gave intent to simulate the companionship of some kind. But the point of this happenstance seemed too sharp, too deliberately thrust into the steady sails of his
composure. He knew when he was being made fun of. And perplexingly enough, it was in front of this tray that he felt seen as a fool and an imposter for the first time - he felt that it knew everything about him, and only desired to mock his suffering.",2,1738234954.0,NewAuthor,0,1.0,False

1idkh8y,https://www.reddit.com/r/somethingiswrong2024/comments/1idkh8y/interesting_conversation_on_why_trump_is_doing/,Interesting conversation on why Trump is doing what he is doing,"Talking to my Republican son-in-law, who is no dummy as he has an advanced degree and does quite well for himself, he says the there is a big story which few are hearing. He listens to many Right leaning business podcasts (no idea which ones) and he understands what Trump and Company are doing long term. I didn't challenge anything he was saying and let him only talk for the most part. 

Ultimate goal for the USA is to generate at much as possible within the States to build the best economy in the world. Part of that plan is Greenland and all the resources. The USA will take it over to secure the rare minerals needed to mine for chip production.

Per Colombia dropping the threat Trump made of tariffs, that country needs the USA due to our coffee consumption, so actually they can't afford to lose the sales. Yes, we would pay higher prices if there was a tariff, but Colombia would hurt more. They gave in. (Yes, this is a business tactic but something businesses do.)

He also mentioned a bill is being pushed to stop all income tax. It will be replaced by a 40% sales tax on everything. He said the extra money in our pay checks would help make up for the sales tax. (This would hurt the poorest mostly).

Immigration policy and securing the borders. I said we are losing workers. He countered that American families need to be larger, like they we years ago. The American child birth rate has declined. He also got into it is declining across the globe as well but didn't elaborate much more.

The rest of my team members were kind enough to help me sort it out. 
For context, this co-worker who is 10 years older than me, seemed to be an introverted shu man who minded his business. Once he earned up to our team, we all start conversing more. We would usually talk about movies, or the news. But slowly he would start bringing in his personal life in our conversations, especially when talking to me (since he sits right next to me). I would wish him good morning or ask how his weekend was he would start bitching about his wife and how he doesn't like staying with her. I immediately felt uncomfortable and would not reply or react to the things he said. 

I also slowly started to avoid having any conversations with him other than work stuff. 

And so for the last couple of days he had been acting really weird and silent which got our attention as a team and we started to ask him what was wrong. And just for the sake of courtesy, I asked him if everything was ok and he ended telling me things that triggered the panic attack. He said that he feels a deep connection with me and he hasn't felt this way in 12 years. He demanded to know why I don't reciprocate his feelings, show that I care for him or talk to him outside of work. Why I don't drink coffee with him during breaks, why I talk to other co-workers especially other men,  or why I never share personal things with him. 

Hearing this I I immediately started shaking out of fear, but I also managed to voice record him. 
After he leaves, I immediately run out of the office building and call my best friend who also works with me. She suggests that I immediately talk to the manager. So today I told my manager, played the recording and found out that he has been doing a lot of other damage than initially thought. My manager has been quiet pissed of with him and felt what he did was beyond crossing the line. 

Now I am scared that he might try to harm me back, even though he doesn't know I talked to the manager about this with proof. From what my manager told me, I understand that he is a deeply disturbed man. 
But I am still scared. ",2,1738234186.0,Vent,3,1.0,False

So it started with me setting up 3 chairs in the office with 2 waste paper baskets and a coffee mug on them this in itself started off my hatred for coffee mugs. After the game starts I get to walk around underwater for the second time where I find my new companion THE BECKET, this bucket was with me until the elevator where it fell through the floor and disappeared, got sad over that until I reached Omicron. Im grabbing the battery when I turned around and saw a familiar face, it was the bucket again so I grabbed her and got out of there. After the cloning happens we get on the Abyss Climber Rig where I place the bucket in a seat then I sit next to it, the rig starts to move when I look over and see the bucket float through the roof again. I reach the bottom and take out my frustration on a coffee mug, eventually, I reach the ARK just before grabbing it though I see her again, in the bathroom SHE LIVED. So I do the puzzle and get the ark out taking the bucket, I'm now running to alpha and sacrificing an arm (the bucket looking away) and now I'm running to the finale area, then the worse thing happens, the angular Attacks picking me up, I drop down somewhat fine. But I turn around to grab the bucket but I don't see her, then it hits me, the bucket saves me sacrificing itself and getting eaten, I don't have time to possess the Greef as I kept running finally reaching the gun. I do the puzzle to get the ARK in, and then I shoot the gun, lying back in the chair, I cry as I'm stuck without a bucket as my duplicate gets her on the ARK.

CHAPTER III

No one goes to the City

The wagon he embarked on was inside a sad, torn and dissheveled thing, disfigured by the past rages of commuters, and abandoned by any semblance of maintenance. Most of the seats had had their stuffing and springs toyfully pulled out of them, and the walls
were densely matted with graffiti, through which snaked the faint outlines of pictoral dicks. Bardhyl was just content that whichever dark souls progressively degraded his train were cordial enough not to share his commute, and instead confined themselves to the
shadows of his world.

He looked out the window as the train took speed and snaked through the country side. In the field below could be seen the gentle pace of a tractor. No one sat there of course, but the roof has been dismounted and in the drivers seat had been awkwardly manacled a large robotic arm, the kind of which would normally be used on a factory production
line. The arm did its’ best to operate the tractor, hesitantly rushing between the steering wheel and gear shift, oscillating the machine down an imperfect line in the field. The sight of this always tended to cheer Bardhyl, as he, like every past day until now,
contemplated the robots’ inability to effectively replace man, a meditation that marked his commute into the City, maker and giver of all things.

The City gradually came into view, appearing as a pustulation of concrete and steel, becoming increasingly regular and dense. Bardhyl‘s commute for the past year had been a solitary thing, and his ‘people spotting’ had become an increasingly impossible task
from his carriage window. Slowly even the lights from the houses in the hillside had extinguished, until he knew for certain that he was completely alone in traveling to the City - perhaps the last worker ever to commute there.

The travel to the center was composed of two
parts - first the expanse of a thousand useless edifices and things built long ago, a prelude composed of missing roofs, windows and doors. After this came the living core, a Wagnerian triumph to a black monochrome steam punk’s nightmare. The core of the
city was most conspicuous for it‘s smooth, reflective surface, which was in fact a crawling mass of nanomites (also black). This was also why the City was principally abandoned - the nanomites determined who could freely pass.

These robots littered the streets like sand - their origin and purpose had been to once deliver free medical service to whomever walked upon them. Naturally you would have had to walk barefoot, and if the specks could get a whiff of a cancer or heart murmur on your palm, then they would let you sink in
amongst them, five meters deep, holding you faster than quicksand. Post recovery, you would rise to the surface, like a capsized corpse washed ashore. The process was said to quadruple the average human life
span, and had initially attracted thousands to its’ healing shores.

But then, as many others, Bardhyl had heard
that some of the patients had purportedly slipped into the dunes and never resurfaced. Reassurance had been given that this was a perverse speculation on those who required longer treatments, for which reason they
simply stayed longer underneath, but the damage was done, and increasing numbers decided to avoid the City altogether. Bardhyl tried to take neither side of the polemic, but he could not help wonder if the darker shadows that gently drifted beneath the ground were the shades of some trapped human form. 

This was perhaps why he held a total aversion to walking barefoot on the sands, and rather wrapped his shoes in several layers of plastic bags. He would be damned before those little shites got a sniff of his varicose veins, mild hernia and onset of glucoma.

As the train’s pace began to slow down, Bardhyl fixed his protection to his shoes. The speaker garbled an incomprehensible message, and then the doors opened, allowing the black sand to seep onboard. He
carefully overstepped this wave and continued on through the station into the City itself.
After already no more than a minute‘s walking,
he suddenly heard the sound of someone running. He froze, caught unawares as he had believed that the city was well and truly empty. 

Someone was running in his direction, the footfalls dampened by the nanomites. A figure appeared through the smog, but it
was not human. It was a thing, a bizarrely tinkered contraption, made up of two slender robotic legs upon which had been cruelly welded a heavy set antique TV.
The thing ran with less purpose and more under the struggle to compensate the weight of its‘ load, the screen jumping between static and black. This too perhaps had been the handiwork of those barbarians,
always at work some place just beyond Bardhyl‘s horizon. The thing paid no attention to him, running past into a side alley. And then silence once more - a brief encounter, a bizarre revelation better left unknown, punctuating his solitary trail.

In his distraction, he had allowed the sand to
seek its‘ way over his plastic: He shook his leg in a panic and knocked it against the tip of a lamp post for good measure. The empty socket of the lamp post resonated, and Bardhyl who preferred inattention, quickly walked on in embarrassment. Roth corporation was an impressive architectural design - it was the perfect emulation of the screwed up piece of paper upon which Mr Roth the founder had written his pre-eminent inspiration for global automation. His son, the second Roth, had
found it curled up within his father‘s palm on his deathbed, and the story goes that rather then unfold and read it, he confined it to a glass case, from which its‘ legend was naturally spun to greater lengths over
time. The building even copied the fragments of words that could be spied within the folds of the paper, but none had ever managed to successfully read it in full.

At the entrance to the building sat a metallic
sphere, which had in fact fallen from its’ mount some months prior, and lay sunken midway in the sand. A pale blue bubble drifted to the surface where Bardhyl placed his hand, and instantly the entire building emitted a symphony of clicks, like a box of Geiger
counters dropped into a radioactive mine shaft. A piece of the paper unfolded: the entrance to his place of work.
 
Inside, the space had been appropriated by and adapted exclusively for robots: they slid in tubes like fungi and tip toed with spider like legs through holes in the walls, crawling over a dense mat of ill managed wires. Only the stair case had been begrudgingly left as a vestige of the office past, or as an acknowledgement to Bardhyl‘s particular ‘human’ accessibilility needs. Conveniently, it stopped at the
third floor, precisely where his desk was situated.

The floor itself was pitch black, but he knew the way off by heart. He navigated through the darkness and in amongst the hum of ventilators, feeling his way to the small switch of his desk lamp. He was placed, as
he called it, in the pod room. All around him hung gigantic pods like bulbous wasp nests, vibrating incessantly, no doubt engaged in some task beyond his mortal comprehension. 

He took off his hat, scarf and Trenchcoat, folding them neatly over the back of his
chair. The time was now 8:05 - he had achieved another day on time much to the relief of his crippling anxiety, and could now peacefully sit and contemplate the absurdity of his position for the remaining eight and a half hours of his working day. The realisation and horror one would expect to torture him daily, was only imperfectly managed by
Bardhyl. He had been accustomed to his situation by gradual steps, each a momentary shock followed by his inevitable capitulation. Habit and time had worn down the sting of any worthwhile realisation on his condition, and besides, the small candle of pride that
he held above others, that he indeed still did go to work, kept him going, if only to appear slightly better off than his peers.

The first pod had been fixed to the ceiling
almost twelve years ago. Management had made it the centrepiece of the open working space - a work of art, beautiful to behold but simultaneously purposeful in furthering the corporation’s productivity. The CEO had made a quip about turning the world of work upside down („because the pod is upside down“ someone had pedantically whispered to Bardhyl‘s left, obviously eager for his colleagues to share in the mirth of their superior. “Looks like a ball sack“ another whispered over his right shoulder). At the time, he could not recall whether any explanation
had actually been given over what the pod was intended to do.

The common apprehension was that it was
listening to everything, and reporting on up. It‘s most particular feature was the spherical aperture at its‘ base. It was a hole big enough for someone to crawl up inside. But as the pod hung too close down to the ground, you would have had to crawl on your back to get a good look inside, and naturally office decorum
forbade such a manoeuvre during working hours. Even now, as he sat alone, Bardhyl had still not succumbed to his curiosity and stuck his head under the pod. Perhaps it was because he had been visited by a recurring dream where he was walking into the
office to retrieve something forgotten (an umbrella, hat, scarf...the details varied from night to night). As he came into the open space, there on the floor would be the CEO, looking up directly into the pod and laughing without restraint, the laugh of a man suddenly unburdened from all sorrow. He would
glance in Bardhyl‘s direction, then lift his head into the pod, and begin ascending into it. As fast as he could run, Bardhyl could never get there in time to free him.

He clung to his legs as they kicked him furiously back, and were swallowed upwards. The dream ended, but the image would remain with him, and so any time he felt like looking, he would be struck with the sight of the painful laugh of his former boss, a laugh full of abandonment, a face through which
emotion poured out like the impossible wrenching of a wet cloth.

On Bardhyl‘s desk were arranged a series of toys and souvenirs. It had been a former supervisor‘s idea that all the employees bring in their ‚totems‘: small objects that carried spiritual and emotional weight. Bardhyl had preserved them ever since in a drawer,
and only recently had relocated them amongst his papers. Each totem held the potent recollection of a colleague, and for some was the remaining bridge in his memory to them.

The plastic t-rex painted in a repulsive bright green and red had belonged to Kyle Maffin, a senior cost controller. Upon presenting it to the group, he had claimed to have fished it out of a forgotten toy box from his childhood, and that this piece had always been his favourite. The piece was less than exceptional - mass
produced and sold at every corner shop and gas station. Perhaps it betrayed a childhood of want, or the man simply was of humble taste. Everyone had felt slightly sorry for Karl as he had shared it, and the ancient beast, the lizard tyrant king looked almost pitiful in its plastic imitation. Decidedly, Bardhyl had thought, Kyle‘s parents had been mean not to at least
procure a beast of higher quality. Amongst the other ornaments that littered his desk
stood:

One picture of a cat he had never heard mention,

One wind up tin fire truck driven by
monkeys,

One clay figurine, obviously made by a
child, of a figure whose face lay merged in
its‘ stomach, the words ‚I love you
mummy‘ etched in an arc above its backside,

One silver fork, two prongs missing, 

And one travel sized bottle of whiskey.

Bardhyl‘s own memento was a very large and
sharp safety pin. He remembered his father had given it to him as a testament to his trust in his responsible young boy. The pin was long enough to reach the heart, his father had said, words which produced nothing but pride in his infant self at being awarded the safe keeping of such a dangerous object, but words also which later on did not ring in his memory with
the paternal love that he thought he had so cherished. Thus surrounded, so to speak, by his memento mori, Bardhyl wandered, adrift on a desk sized raft in a tempest made of industrial ventilators, his present
moment an unfolding and refolding of the past.
The silver fork had always stood at the coffee
machine - lamenting over the inefficiency of his colleagues, yet supporting it with a comic fatality. The whiskey bottle was perpetually sick, and in his rare appearances affected the image of a man overcome with work, hounded and hunted down by it like as a fox by pack of mad dogs. The tin fire truck had always
been at his desk before Bardhyl arrived, remaining without exception until after the last man had left.

But the picture of the cat had been his friend,
albeit from afar, a person whose congeniality volubly announced a jovial co- conspiracy to assure all on lookers that at least one good man was here alive in this office. „Don‘t make the rest of us look bad, Mr Imron“, he would quip whilst passing his desk, or „make sure the project for the board gets delivered on
time Bardhyl“, he would pat him on the shoulder, perhaps suggesting that he saw straight through Bardhyl‘s ruse, and all the more kept it safe between them by getting the office gossips off his scent.

This and other such remembrances Bardhyl
indulged in, poking at the embers of his nostalgia. And yet he could not help but equally observe that he felt absolutely no pain or regret in the absence of his colleagues.
His reasoning for this was simple - his former
life among men had been one punctuated by a rhythm of probable gestures and feints: the hanging of a coat, the clinking of a spoon carried in a mug to the coffee machine, the furious underlining, highlighting and
crossing out of lines upon paper later to be shredded, the chattering of keyboard keys and the performative answering of phones. All this was the sound of people working, but only the sound and nothing more. The real people here had always been absent - they had
left their selves behind with their loved ones, and here paraded their shells. As such, their disappearance was unremarkable, more like the melting of a ghost beneath a floating cloth than the loss of anything real.

Now, albeit without people, there was a similar
regularity to the things that scuttled, the curious optic assemblies that peered at him from round corners, the murmur in the pipes and the snap of the current in some stray wires. They perhaps did not drink coffee,
but they were similarly filled with their quirks and habits, some of which he had grown strangely accustomed to. And in turn he gave back as good as he saw: to the platonic shadows and shapes of existence
played out against his cave wall, he matched with his own appearances and feints. To him work had never been anything more than the stillness of a stick insect, moving in a forest of eyes. The eyes perhaps had changed, but they continued to watch him, and so he
continued to perform, and pretend to work.
His position however afforded him a curious
vantage point over his mechanical peers: through constant observation they took on the qualities of peculiar characters, and small gestures that would appear meaningless to any outsider, would to him stand out as a strange and meaningful deviations from
their productive cycle. It had been hard to humanise his human peers -that had been an a priori condition he was expected to see in them. But these robots seemed all the more relatable precisely for the fact that he had gifted them their relatability. But of all these characters, outlined in the finest
and inconspicuous of mechanical gestures, the most perfidious and unbearable to Bardhyl, was the inbuilt monitor to his cantina tray. Like every available space
in the building, the lunch hall had been repurposed as a data warehouse, an open space with tall ceilings, now filled with enourmous black server towers. It was
here that Bardhyl came to eat, for the meals delivered by the electronic caterer.

The insidious nature of this cantina tray could
no doubt only be made apparent by the keenly
persistent observer. The actual screen was dead, but the small array of LED lights remained operable - three blue dots that would flicker with random intensity. One day, as Bardhyl was peaceably masticating on
something that resembled a perfect cylinder of a baked sweet potato, he fell into the habit of
murmuring out his thoughts. And as he did so, the three lights turned on in succession as if registering the variation in a sound wave. He stopped, and the lights ceased, he spoke, and they registered the cadence of his speech once more. He barked and they shot up in frenzy. He whispered and a single blue eye
blinked hesitantly. Surprised by this behaviour, he did something he would live to regret - he asked the cantina tray its‘ name.

Normally such a question would have been
drowned out by the whirring ventilators of the servers, but this time they all simultaneously plunged into a sudden and irregular silence, to which his words rang out through the large space: „What‘s your name?“.

Instead of responding in playful kind, the lights
went out. Then, after a few moments, the space was drowned once more in the din of the ventilators. At the time, Bardhyl dismissed a feintly perceived offence as the paranoia of his regular isolation. But in retrospect, he could now see it as the first of many insults he had suffered at the twisted humour of this
cantina tray. On the second occasion, the tray -normally paired with his name, which would display above the menu selection once placed on the conveyor belt - had generated the name Barbara instead. This name was all the more displaced as Barbara had been the name of a project manager who had kissed him one year at an office party. They had never spoke of it afterward, but he had always wondered - did her soul too similarly stir every time he passed her, or had she forgot him the moment their lips had parted? When he
often wondered anxiously whether he had lived well, or had wasted his time in the dead end of a career, staring up at the ceiling in the evenings after work, his mind would go back to Barbara as a consolation, and a regret.

To think that this kiss had somehow been seen by the scheming miniaturised intellect that inhabited this tray confounded him. His better sense tried to reason it as pure coincidence, a happenstance that he gave intent to simulate the companionship of some kind. But the point of this happenstance seemed too sharp, too deliberately thrust into the steady sails of his
composure. He knew when he was being made fun of. And perplexingly enough, it was in front of this tray that he felt seen as a fool and an imposter for the first time - he felt that it knew everything about him, and only desired to mock his suffering.",1,1738233534.0,fiction,0,1.0,False

My Morning Coffee has been Optimised.,"I’ve always *hated* running out of coffee beans. There’s nothing worse than stumbling to the coffee machine on a bleary Monday morning, only to hear that dreadful sound of an empty grinder...

Sure, I could probably be a bit more organized. But instead, I decided to overengineer a solution so I’d never have to face this problem again... I built [The Bean Buddy](https://imgur.com/a/dR4IhCF)!

Although it’s not the prettiest right now, the Bean Buddy is a vacuum-sealed smart jar designed to keep your coffee beans fresh, just like a regular coffee jar. What sets it apart is its ability to track how many beans you have left as you use them. It notifies me when supplies are running low and even gives me a heads-up before it automatically places an order. It means fresh beans arrive at my doorstep before I ever run out.

What do you think? Would you use something like this? Maybe it's for tea, or dog food... maybe I'm crazy.

What if, for the regular townsfolk, Silent Hill was just a normal place? No fog, no monsters, no otherworld—just a quiet little town where life goes on as usual. They go to work, grab coffee at the diner, complain about the weather, and deal with everyday problems like anyone else.

But every now and then, some poor soul wanders in, looking lost and haunted. They start freaking out over things no one else can see, shouting about their past, swinging weapons at thin air, or having deep, dramatic monologues in the middle of the street. The locals? They just shrug it off.

*""Hey, you see that guy?""*  
*""Yeah. Must be going through something.""*  
*""Happens.""*

To them, Silent Hill isn’t a nightmare—it’s just home. Whatever weird stuff these outsiders are dealing with? Not their problem.

I have 40 pounds to go. I have been trying to intermittent fast because I have heard it works for losing weight but I find it just maintains my weight I lose from exercise. I wonder if my age has anything to do with this plateau. I think I remember losing weight much easier from fasting when I was in my 20's and 30's. So how do I speed up my metabolism when my body won't respond to exercise and diet like it did when I was younger? Is it possible to speed up metabolism at and after 40? What should I be doing instead? Right now I walk between 5 and 9 miles a day and I also try to run but I can only run a mile. I eat 1 to 2 meals a day. I keep it low carb eating meat and vegetables with nuts for a snack. I drink about 2-3 cups of coffee with unsweetened almond milk.

Transforming your kitchen into a warm and inviting space is easily achieved with rustic home decor elements. This style is characterized by its use of natural materials, vintage-inspired accessories, and a cozy atmosphere that makes the kitchen feel like the heart of the home.

One of the key aspects of rustic home decor kitchen design is the incorporation of wood. Exposed beams, reclaimed wood shelving, and farmhouse tables create a grounded ambiance. Consider installing wooden cabinets or using a distressed wood finish to add authenticity. Choosing open shelving allows you to display beautiful dishware and rustic utensils, enhancing the overall aesthetic.

Accessorizing your kitchen with vintage finds further enhances its rustic charm. Look for antique kitchen tools, mason jars, or even vintage signage to complement your decor. A collection of old cookbooks or a retro coffee grinder can serve as both functional and decorative pieces. Textiles also play a significant role; linen or burlap curtains, along with patterned or plaid tablecloths, bring warmth and texture to the space.

Color choices for a rustic home decor kitchen typically lean towards muted and earthy tones. Shades like taupe, sage green, or soft white create a serene backdrop, allowing natural elements to shine. Pair these shades with copper or wrought iron fixtures for an added touch of rustic elegance.

Finally, consider incorporating greenery. Fresh herbs in terracotta pots or a small farm-style vase with flowers can infuse life into your kitchen. Not only do they bring color, but they also enhance the rustic theme by connecting the indoor space with nature.

By combining natural materials, vintage accessories, and warm colors, you can create a rustic home decor kitchen that reflects charm and character, making every meal feel like a special occasion.

Generally people notice I am not fitting in on second year, they don’t treat me nice, everything becomes repetitive, so I will know I need to change.

I always thought those are ADHD signs, but still a lot of things I could not have explained with ADHD. After my dad’s illness and I needed to dedicate a lot of time between work and him, I started using my ADHD meds a lot. I was feeling really well then I was not. I think using ADHD meds concealed the ADHD symptom and the rest shows Autism. I also think I might be on the edge of burn out. I started self isolate, lost a lot of friends, don’t wanna do things that I do in order to make my life enjoyable, i am always tired, cannot breath properly. I am also living abroad, and needed visa etc to work.

So the question is, I am stuck now. I don’t like the situation I am in, to find a new job in same company (corporate) I have to do a lot of coffee dates etc with people, try to sell my best self, communicate extensively. I never liked to do those things, but now, I feel exhausted. I cannot stand people I don’t even want to go to office. 

How should I ask for help at work? My boss knows I have ADHD but they don’t know I have AuADHD since It is not official. Even they know, I don’t think they will know how they can accommodate. 
What should I do? How did you react when you were on the edge of burn out? How can i ask any support?
