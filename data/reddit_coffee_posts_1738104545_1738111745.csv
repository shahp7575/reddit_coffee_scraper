1ichfeg,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSubstance/comments/1ichfeg/questions_about_the_film/,Questions about the film,"Now I’ve seen the filme twice and I have this questions. 

1. There has been a big debate about whether Elisabeth and Sue share the same consciousness—whether they are truly one “you are one” or simply different versions of the same being. Has this ever been officially confirmed or denied?

Points in favor: Elisabeth knew Sue’s name the first time she woke up without being told or having read it anywhere. When old Elisabeth was terminating the experiment, she thought about “our big night” and that made her stop the terminating process. Also, if they did not share the same consciousness, what would Elisabeth gain from all of this? If they were separate beings, she would likely use The Substance, realize they were not one, and stop using it altogether cause she had nothing to gain with it. 

Points against: After Sue was with the first guy at Elisabeth’s house, Elisabeth seemed surprised by the mess—later, Sue was also surprised by the state of Elisabeth’s kitchen. Elisabeth also appeared shocked when she realized the guy Sue had been with was the same one she saw wearing the helmet—if they shared a consciousness, she would already know him and would not be that shocked, right? Later, when Sue was on TV giving an interview, Elisabeth mocked her answers, suggesting that they do not share a consciousness, as she wouldn’t know what Sue had said. Lastly, if they shared the same consciousness, would Sue deliberately harm Elisabeth like that miss using The Substance on purpose?

2. This might be a bit silly, but how did they actually know how to properly use The Substance, considering the instructions weren’t very detailed? Besides that, Sue also seemed to have knowledge of how to use it—knowledge that Elisabeth had learned. Could this be a clue that they share the same consciousness after all?

3. How did old Elisabeth manage to run so fast outside? And how did she even outrun Sue inside the house, running from the living room to the bathroom?

4. This is not a question but rather an observation—or possibly a continuity mistake. When Elisabeth was at the coffee shop, she ordered a mocha latte. Then, as she started speaking with the older version of the doctor, the coffee suddenly appeared on the table, even though the waitress had never delivered it.

5. How did Sue have so much strength to kick old Elisabeth so far—sending her flying from the stairs all the way to the table?

6. How did Monster Elisa-Sue went from Elisabeth’s house to the TV studio? And assuming Sue had been missing for a long time—given the fight and everything that happened inside the house—how did the show continues as planned? How were they expecting Sue to appear right at the exact moment she was supposed to start presenting, when she had been missing for at least a couple of hours?

Sorry about the long text but I’m loving The Substance so much. ",1,1738111666.0,TheSubstance,0,1.0,False

1ichar1,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Curious-Ebb-8451/comments/1ichar1/the_best_cloud_couch_dupe_7th_avenue_sofa_review/,The Best Cloud Couch Dupe — 7th Avenue Sofa Review,"https://preview.redd.it/ux5pzgpwvtfe1.jpg?width=1425&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=76af98c39022b514def8c6c2d6135fa1f0354c9d

**Summary:** *While it is an investment, the 7th Avenue Modular Sofa is 100% worth it. It meets all the criteria for sustainability, ethics, and non-toxic certifications. It’s also among the most versatile modular sofas available, offering countless configurations to suit your needs. Additionally, it’s effortless to clean and designed for everyday comfort. It truly does offer a “cloud-like” experience!*

# Pros

* The covers and fabrics for the [7th Avenue Modular Sofa](https://7thavenue.sjv.io/c/274622/1686529/19563?subId1=df-web-rw-&u=https%3A%2F%2F7thavenue.co%2Fcollections%2Fsectionals%2Fproducts%2F4-seat-sectional) modular sofa are OEKO-TEX certified, third-party tested, and formaldehyde-free, and free from flame retardants. The base is made from FSC-certified wood.
* The modular sofa has numerous configuration possibilities, and you can add on or downsize to fit different spaces and seasons of life.
* You can also change out the covers, which are washable, and coated with a nontoxic DWR coating technology. In my experience, I found that the couch was resistant to spills, stains, and daily debris.
* While a bit more expensive ($2950+), 7th Avenue sofas will last a lifetime and are made to grow with you over time for long-term savings and sustainability.
* If you’re in LA, you can opt to have the couch assembled by 7th Avenue’s delivery team. That’s what I did, but self-assembly seemed easily doable!

# Cons

* While the sofa is more affordable than some high-end options like the Restoration Hardware cloud couch, its significant price tag might be a deterrent for those on a tighter budget.
* The color selection is relatively limited compared to other brands that offer a wider range of upholstery choices. Options include white, black, and heather grey.

I’m not usually one to fall for TikTok trends. But last year, I found myself scrolling through videos of [cloud couches](https://www.tiktok.com/discover/cloud-couch?lang=en) in high-rise apartments and sun-filled living rooms. Something about the oversized cushions and neutral aesthetic drew me in, despite my usual taste for darker tones and mid-century decor.

My husband and I had just moved into a new apartment where, sadly, our beloved velvet green couch no longer fit. The two-seater sofa was swallowed by the size of the room. After much reluctance, we sold it, then began searching for cloud couch lookalikes and dupes to fill our space. (The real thing from Restoration Hardware costs upwards of $10k. No thanks.)

But even as I scoured secondhand listings, I struggled to justify buying a couch with questionable materials. Many are filled with goose down, and sofa covers are [often treated with toxic repellents](https://www.livingetc.com/news/is-your-sofa-harming-you). Sustainability is always at the top of my list, but nontoxic is an absolute must when it comes to bedding and fabric furniture. 

After months of searching, I came across [7th Avenue](https://7thavenue.sjv.io/c/274622/1686529/19563?subId1=df-web-rw-&u=https%3A%2F%2F7thavenue.co%2F), a new*ish* furniture company launched in 2022 with claims to have made “The World’s Greatest Modular Sofa.” And the couch seemed to meet my requirements for sustainability, ethics, *and* natural materials. 

>“7th Avenue, a new*ish* “7th Avenue, a new*ish* furniture company launched in 2022 with claims to have made ‘The World’s Greatest Modular Sofa.'”

  
For example, the covers and fabrics are OEKO-TEX certified, third-party tested, and formaldehyde-free (they use water-based glue instead). The LA-based brand doesn’t use flame retardant chemicals either, according to California laws, which have been known to be carcinogenic and toxic. As for the cushions, they are filled with a premium down alternative, making the couch hypoallergenic, vegan, and cruelty-free. 

The frame is FSC-certified too. 7th Avenue crafts its couches in Indonesia using Indonesian solid wood for construction — highly regarded as one of the strongest types of wood in the market. The brand is also making efforts to reduce waste by reusing and recycling as many packaging materials as possible.

Best of all, 7th Avenue’s cloud couch dupe is half the price of the real thing, starting at $2950+. I decided to go for it.

# Delivery & setup

One of the biggest selling points of 7th Avenue is the delivery and setup options. I’ve spent too many hours of my life carting couches across cities and putting them together like Ikea furniture. It once took us an entire afternoon to figure out how to get a sofa up two flights of narrow stairs. Let’s just say it involved a skateboard and some pulleys.

Because I live within a 60-mile radius of 7th Avenue’s LA warehouse, I opted to have their delivery team help with setup. (If you live outside of the area, you can still get help with this; they just use a verified third-party assembler.) The brand contacted me via call and follow-up email to schedule and confirm a date and time. In the morning, I received a text from the driver confirming they were on their way. 

When a small van arrived at my apartment, I was curious to know where the couch was. Surely it didn’t fit in there? But the two delivery workers explained that everything was in boxes for easy transport and setup. This also means the possibility of expanding or downsizing the couch in the future — a feature I love.

I had opted for the [4-Seat Modular Corner Sectional](https://7thavenue.sjv.io/c/274622/1686529/19563?subId1=df-web-rw-&u=https%3A%2F%2F7thavenue.co%2Fcollections%2Fsectionals%2Fproducts%2F4-seat-sectional) with the chaise, and aside from answering questions about where I’d like to couch and which side I’d prefer the corner on (it’s interchangeable and can be left or right facing), the setup team handled everything. It took about an hour, and I got to drink coffee and read a book, all while the 7th Avenue team transformed my living room into a luxurious TikTok loft. 

>

Once finished, they showed me how to attach and detach each piece for future configurations and left me with a bag of down inserts to create fluffier cushions if I wanted. Then they took the boxes away, leaving me with a new couch. It was a 15/10 experience. 

A note for DIYers: While putting the sofa together without a setup team may be intimidating, it’s definitely doable. Each piece is easy to move around and assemble, and the cushion covers go on seamlessly. The brand notes that each seat takes about 10-15 minutes for assembly.

# Comfort & functionality rating

Of course, a couch can look beautiful and luxurious, but the real question remains: Is it comfortable? My husband and I *loved* our last sofa, so the bar was set high for the 7th Avenue modular sectional. I’m happy to report that I sunk in and napped as soon as the delivery team left. The reviews and hype were spot on. While this wasn’t *the* cloud couch, it was a cloud couch, and I was quickly in love. 

We’ve enjoyed our new sofa for about a month now, and the comfort level keeps improving as it adjusts to our bodies and home. The cushions are firm and supportive while giving you a “cloud-like” feel. It’s easy to move around too, and I’ve rearranged configurations multiple times on my own — I love that you can bring the chaise over to the corner section to create a mini-bed for movie nights or guests. We even had friends sleep on it for five nights while visiting, and it was way better than a pullout or even a fancy air mattress. Just make sure you use the included screws to attach the pieces once it’s set to prevent any sliding. 

[Pro tip: Get the extra throw pillows for additional back support or to prop up your legs. ](https://preview.redd.it/23m04a2owtfe1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=401a9acd4a9d78a827340ce85421f0b1fe5888be)

# Caring for the sofa

When I told my friends I’d opted for a white sofa after years with a very forgiving velvet green couch, they laughed. While we don’t have children, and our dog knows that furniture is off-limits, white is white. 

That said, 7th Avenue has promised a durable fabric solution.

“Our DWR coating technology is unique because we are taking a feature that is commonly used in outdoor jackets and applying them to indoor upholstery,” the brand told me in an interview. “Our fabrics do not easily absorb liquid but can be easily cleaned if stained. \[They\] are also removable and washing machine safe.” 

In other words, the sofa is spill and stain-resistant, which has been our experience so far. The few times we’ve gotten dirt on the couch, it’s wiped off easily, and I’ve invested in a handheld upholstery steamer — just in case.

I’m still hesitant as I get used to it and put down blankets when eating. But I’ll be eager to see how the covers wash in the future. If white is too terrifying, the 7th Avenue sofas come in black and heather grey. You can even change out your covers in the future, further prolonging the life of our couch.

>– 7th Avenue

As for PFAS and microplastics, I asked the brand about them since it’s such a pertinent discussion right now, especially with waterproof fabrics. I was pleased to hear they are committed to being free from microplastics, PFC, PFAS, and PFOA in 2023. 

“Several states have legislation that bans microplastics such as PFAS and PFOA from household products by 2025. As a fast-growing upstart in the furniture industry, we believe we can do this much faster than legacy players,” they said. 

# Changing out the covers

One of my favorite features of the 7th Avenue couch is the fact that you can change out the covers and essentially have an entirely new couch. The company has multiple fabric alternatives and colors, including premium performance velvet, woven chenille, classic crossweave, and textured weave. (Keep an eye out for limited color drops too!

https://preview.redd.it/5696jztvwtfe1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=08e8bdf4defde86e221df32fd4098383610e6ab7

[I love how easy it is to swap out the covers without needing to replace the entire couch.](https://preview.redd.it/07ide7atwtfe1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fd4dcc2077cd7584d827f4c40b7931f517ca66cb)

Of course, when opting to try out the cover set for our couch, I knew I wanted something bold and moody to contrast the modern white we originally ordered. You can see in the photos below how we transformed our couch (and the feel of our living space) with the olive green velvet. It’s softer than the textured weave, and though all 7th Avenue covers are washable, it definitely hides more than the white.

Having an additional cover set also allows us to switch out the covers during different seasons or if we want to give the couch covers a deeper clean. When not in use, they fold up and store easily in our hall closet. I highly recommend this option to anyone who wants to freshen up their couch without buying a new one!

[The difference between the two colors. We also made the couch a bit smaller and moved the other half into our bedroom for a loveseat—there is so much versatility!](https://preview.redd.it/o1b9o1xywtfe1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=566d4224eb1b69985b9cd277067b093b5a6b027c)

# Final thoughts: Is the couch worth it? 

The short answer is yes. While this sofa is far from “cheap,” I think it’s 100% worth the investment. It checks all of the boxes in terms of sustainability, ethics, and nontoxic certifications. It’s arguably one of the most functional modular sofas on the market, with endless configurations and options for you and your family to grow. Plus, it’s easy to clean and made for everyday snuggles — kids and pets included.  

“Modular sofas are truly great for sustainability and longevity because they can be used as customers’ lifestyles change,” 7th Avenue said. 

“For example, those living in apartments or smaller spaces will likely purchase modular sofas with a smaller configuration. Once they move to a larger space or a single-family home, they can simply add modular pieces to make their sofas larger \[meaning\] they do not have to discard the older smaller sofa that they had and buy a new one.” 

It’s a money-saving and environmental win.

1ichanw,https://www.reddit.com/r/GameTableCentral/comments/1ichanw/furologee_cd013c_desk_with_power_outlet_review/,Furologee CD013-C desk with power outlet review,"I’ve had my fair share of desks over the years, but the Furologee CD013-C L-Shaped Desk definitely caught my attention. The rustic brown finish with its industrial style sold me right away, and I couldn’t resist trying it out for my home office. The moment it arrived, I was eager to put it together and see if it lived up to the buzz it’s been getting. Spoiler alert: it’s not perfect, but it’s close!

**Design & Build Quality**  
This desk is a looker. The rustic brown laminated finish gives it a warm, homey vibe, while the metal frame adds a modern industrial touch. It feels sturdy, though I wouldn’t go jumping on it (not that you should with any desk). The materials are impressive for the price, and I’ve been using it daily for work and gaming without any wobbling or sagging. I did notice that the drawers are made of fabric, which might not scream “premium,” but they’re lightweight and functional.

**Size & Space**  
Measuring 66.14 inches wide and 29.52 inches tall, it’s plenty spacious for my dual-monitor setup, laptop, and even a printer. The L-shape design fits snugly into the corner of my room, maximizing space without feeling overwhelming. If you have a small office or bedroom, this desk fits like a puzzle piece. The reversible design is a neat touch too—you can set it up to suit your room’s layout.

**Functionality & Features**  
The Furologee CD013-C desk comes equipped with three power outlets and two USB charging ports. This has been a game-changer for me, as I no longer have to fumble with extension cords or crawl under the desk to charge my gadgets. The two movable monitor stands are genius—they let me position my monitors at eye level, saving my neck from hours of strain.

Storage is another area where this desk shines. The adjustable shelves are perfect for my gaming console and speakers, while the upgraded fabric file drawer has enough space for my important documents. However, I did find the fabric drawers a bit flimsy for heavy files, so don’t expect them to handle a ton of weight.

**Assembly**  
I won’t lie—assembling this desk was a bit of a process. The instructions are clear, and each part is labeled, but it’s definitely a two-person job. It took me two hours with the help of my partner. If you’re going solo, set aside extra time and maybe prep a playlist to keep yourself entertained.

**Pros**

* The rustic brown aesthetic is both stylish and versatile.
* Built-in charging ports are a lifesaver for tech lovers.
* The desk is spacious yet compact enough for smaller spaces.
* Reversible design allows for customization based on room layout.
* Movable monitor stands are a thoughtful addition.

**Cons**

* Fabric drawers, while functional, feel a bit cheap compared to the rest of the desk.
* Assembly can be time-consuming and requires two people for efficiency.
* The desk’s surface isn’t heat-resistant—my warm coffee mug left a faint mark.
* Monitor stands are not fixed and can slide around if bumped.

**Comparison to Competitors**  
Compared to desks like the Cubiker L-Shaped Desk or the Walker Edison Soren desk, the Furologee CD013-C stands out for its built-in charging station and adjustable shelves. The Cubiker desk is slightly easier to assemble and has fixed monitor stands, but it lacks the premium features like charging ports and fabric file drawers. Walker Edison’s option offers a more modern aesthetic but at a higher price point and with less storage.

One area where the Furologee falls behind its competitors is the quality of the drawers. While the fabric drawers are lightweight and functional, they don’t hold up to heavier wooden or metal drawers found in higher-end desks.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**  
For what you’re getting, the Furologee CD013-C is a solid investment. It’s not the cheapest option out there, but the features and design make it a good bang for your buck. If you’re looking for a desk with ample storage, a unique look, and built-in tech conveniences, this one ticks all the boxes. While it’s not without its flaws, the pros far outweigh the cons in my book.

That’s been my routine for the past couple of weeks with the Braun ExactFit 3 Blood Pressure Monitor, model BUA6150US. This little device has become a part of my daily life, nestled comfortably amongst my other health gadgets on the kitchen counter. At first glance, it’s sleek and functional, but does it deliver on its promises? Let’s dive in.

The Braun ExactFit 3 is designed for simplicity, and that’s clear from the moment you unbox it. Included are two cuff sizes (S/M and L/XL), a set of 4 AA batteries, and a handy storage bag. The machine itself is lightweight at just 1.1 pounds, making it easy to carry around if needed. The extra-large backlit display is a game changer for groggy mornings or dimly lit rooms, ensuring that the readings are clear and easy to interpret.

**Want to see Braun ExactFit 3 Blood Pressure Monitor’s latest price on Amazon?** [**Click here to find out.**](https://thepressureexperts.com/product-reviews/braun-exactfit-3-review-model-bua6150us-b08mwd927f/)

One of the standout features is the color-coded guidance system. The device follows the American Heart Association guidelines, so the results are categorized into low, normal, and high blood pressure ranges. The color coding is a nice touch, especially if you’re not a numbers person or if you're just starting to monitor your health more rigorously.

Another great feature is the memory function. This machine supports two users, with the ability to store up to 40 readings per user. It even averages your last three readings for a more accurate picture of your blood pressure trends. My partner and I have been using this feature to track our readings over time, and it’s been incredibly helpful to notice patterns we might have missed otherwise.

# How It Performs Daily

Using the Braun ExactFit 3 feels intuitive. The soft inflation technology is a small but meaningful detail—no more uncomfortable squeezing sensations that leave your arm feeling numb. Setting it up is a breeze, and the instructions are straightforward. I’ve even tested its accuracy by comparing its readings with those from my doctor’s office, and the numbers match up remarkably well.

There’s also an irregular heartbeat detector, which I found to be a reassuring feature. Although I haven’t had any irregularities flagged yet, it’s good to know the monitor is looking out for me in this way. However, one limitation is that this device is primarily designed for use on the left arm. If you need to monitor both arms, you may find the readings on the right arm less reliable.

# Pros

* **Ease of Use**: Straightforward setup and operation, even for those who aren’t tech-savvy.
* **Accurate Readings**: Consistent results that align with professional medical equipment.
* **Comfortable and Adjustable Cuffs**: Two sizes ensure a proper fit for most users.
* **Memory Functionality**: Great for tracking progress over time, especially for two users.
* **Portable Design**: Lightweight and comes with a storage pouch.

# Cons

* **Left Arm Limitation**: Not as reliable when used on the right arm.
* **No Bluetooth Connectivity**: Some users may miss the ability to sync data with a smartphone app.
* **Basic Design**: While functional, it lacks some of the bells and whistles of more advanced models.

# Comparison to Competitors

When compared to other blood pressure monitors like the Omron Platinum or the Withings BPM Connect, the Braun ExactFit 3 holds its own in terms of accuracy and ease of use. However, it lacks Bluetooth connectivity, which both competitors offer. For those who love tech integrations, this might be a dealbreaker. On the other hand, Braun’s two cuff sizes and color-coded results make it more user-friendly for beginners or those who prefer simplicity.

In terms of comfort, the Braun ExactFit 3 edges out the competition with its soft inflation feature. Some monitors can feel harsh during inflation, but this one is gentle, even if you’re taking multiple readings in one session. The memory storage is comparable to Omron’s devices, though Withings takes the lead with its app-based tracking.

# Cost Analysis and Value for Money

This monitor offers excellent value for money, especially considering its features and accuracy. While it may not have all the advanced tech features of pricier models, it delivers where it matters most—reliable readings and ease of use. If you’re someone who doesn’t need Bluetooth or app integration, this device is a great investment for monitoring your health at home.

The inclusion of two cuffs, batteries, and a carrying case adds to its value. You’re essentially getting everything you need right out of the box without having to purchase additional accessories.

Every feature on the Braun ExactFit 3 feels purposeful. The large display, intuitive controls, and color-coded results make it accessible for users of all ages. I particularly appreciate the irregular heartbeat detector, as it feels like an added layer of safety. The dual-user memory function is another thoughtful addition, making it ideal for couples or roommates who want to share a device without mixing up their readings.

Overall, the Braun ExactFit 3 has proven to be a reliable companion in my daily health routine. It’s not perfect—no device is—but it delivers on its promises and makes monitoring blood pressure at home a hassle-free experience.

So I decided to start writing a blog to maybe relieve some of the stress that I feel me and others have been under for the last few years. So today, I’m going to discuss Stupid People.Just a warning, I may go off on a few tangents.

I don’t know about you, but I’ve found in my many years on this planet, you will have smart people and stupid people. Stupid people, for the last 20 or so years, have become some of our most dangerous people on this earth, especially in this country.  I’ll spend today’s blog talking about a few instances. 

I want to start off with the most recent incident of stupidity - The Gorilla Glue Woman. This idiot could not find a hair care product to hold her hair just so, that she thought it was a good idea to use INDUSTRIAL STRENGTH ADHESIVE in her hair. It says on the bottle - do not get on your clothes, skin or eyes. Anyone who has ever gotten just a drop of this stuff on their skin and had it dry before being able to remove it knows it’s on there for at least the next week. While I am not sure which type of Gorilla Glue product she used, I do know she probably doesn’t have a snowball’s chance in hell of winning a lawsuit. You read that right, she’s planning on suing Gorilla Glue for her own stupidity. 

I was a kid in maybe 5th grade and I remember hearing about the lady that sued McDonalds because she spilled a cup of hot coffee in her lap. She won. ([https://www.caoc.org/?pg=facts](https://www.caoc.org/?pg=facts)) Having had McDonalds coffee, or hell, any drive thru coffee, the shit is always piping hot. Now, being from the south, we males have a tendency to put a drink (usually in an aluminum can) between our legs when driving, especially in an older vehicle that doesn’t have cup holders, which is probably why there are so many damn cupholders in cars today. I can honestly say I haven’t done this in a while because my last 3 vehicles have had cup holders located conveniently nearby. I’ll be honest, I don’t like anything piping hot or ice cold near my testicles any day of the week to begin with, but I do remember before Louisiana passed the Open Container law back in the late 90s seeing my uncles or my dad drive with a cold beer between their legs. 

The next case of idiocy is from January 6th. The President of the United States incited an insurrection on the Capitol building when the electoral college was voting to certify the election. And before a Trumptard tries to come for me, I was at home watching it unfold on CSPAN and NBC - LIVE! What I cannot figure out is how seemingly smart people can willingly suspend their disbelief that the election was not the most secure election in the last 30 years. AND I WATCH WRESTLING AND TEACH THEATER! I teach my students about willing suspension of disbelief, but these are kids and they are willing to believe Peter Pan can actually fly and the Phantom of The Opera can be the love interest. I cannot imagine how so many millions of people can suspend their disbelief that 9-11, Sandy Hook, Columbine, & Stoneman-Douglass massacres did not take place and it's one big media stunt. These racists (let’s call it) drank the Kool-Aid of a morally and probably financially bankrupt man and his minions who spread his fake news and crackpot theories for the last 5 years and utterly brainwashed half of the country.

Now believe what you want and vote how you want, but I have a problem with people choosing to forget what they learned in Civics and American History class because they don’t wanna face the reality of what happened. I have uncles and aunts - people with college degrees in the medical field that actually believe that TRUMP was the best man for the job and that he was going to make things better. I’m still waiting to find out what got made better. Sure as hell wasn’t teacher pay, veteran affairs, social security, or LGBT+ rights. 

I have friends that I went to school with who are Trumptards. I remember the things Mrs. Dier and the late Ms. Shaver taught me about American Democracy and what was expected of every American. In college, I listened with bated breath when Dr. Edith Ambrose told us about what happened to this country during Reconstruction all the way to the end of the semester when she touched upon how important our vote was and to be on the right side of history when an old man who forgot about his brothers in arms many times on the Senate floor ran against a Black Senator from Chicago who was trying to do anything to bring the economy back from the brink of then President Bush’s ruin. In eight years, I don’t see what wrong President Obama had done except be an example of what a President without scandal should look like. Trump won because people didn’t like the fact that a Black man made the country a better place to live. There, I said it. Fox News had pundits daily berating and spitting their vitriol towards President Obama. Anyone remember the day President Obama wore a tan suit?

This may be a long one, I just feel like I need some outside perspective on the relationship. 

For background, I’ve been with my husband for 10 years and married for 3. We have a 1 year old and prior to having a baby we got along with his parents just fine, we weren’t overly close with them but we would visit once and a while and see them for holidays and it was always pleasant.  Once i became pregnant I saw this new controlling side to them. I’ll break down some of the events that have happened. 

Pregnancy:
- we told them and my parents early when we found out and asked them to keep it a secret until we were ready to announce.  We wanted to wait until at least the second trimester and once we reached that we weren’t in a huge rush and were going to let people know on our own time. His parents asked every day before I was 12 weeks if they could tel people yet. One time they were heading to a family party we couldn’t make it to and called to ask if they could announce it. We repeatedly told them no that WE would announce it when we’re ready to. 
- wrote me a 10 page document typed about pregnancy advice, how to make a baby shower registry, items we needed, where to even get my maternity bras. It also included directions to the hospital and where to park and what doors to enter. Insane thing to give two fully capable adults in their 30s who have never asked for their advice before. However we just let it go and threw it out. 
- offered to buy the crib and mattress for our baby shower gift, we were thankful and let them know we had been researching what we want and can let them know. They sent us an email with 4 options and said our choice of a 4-in-1 crib was “nonsensical”. The options they chose were similar in price so it’s not like they didn’t want to spend the amount we picked out. We held our ground and said we would go with the one we want. We also did research on mattresses and picked one that had top safety ratings and let them know, but my husband stopped by their house after work one day and they had a totally different mattress there and when he told them that’s not what we want his mom had a hissy fit and said “she can’t even choose a mattress now”. 
- my mom was throwing the baby shower but she really wanted to throw one for her side so we decided to do two since both sides at my moms would be a lot. We told both sets of parents we just want a low key backyard get together, both genders, no presents being opened, and some family and a few friends. She sent out invitation without checking with us with my last name as their family name (I didn’t change my name when we got married) and only invited women in her family and none of our friends. My husband called to inquire what happened and his father told him the men go to the bar instead- like no that’s not what we want. So we told them my husband will be there and the men in the family are invited to- at this point I didn’t even want friends there, they could just come to my moms only. She also fought with us about not opening gifts every day planning the shower up until the day. 

The baby shower:
- only women in the family showed up and most expressed they didn’t know men were invited 
- it was incredibly awkward because the gift table was in the center of the party and she kept mentioning how “she’s not allowed to say anything about opening gifts” and her sisters kept getting children at the party to come ask me to open gifts. I absolutely refused out of principle. 
- served sushi and sandwich meat. At a fucking baby shower. I had a bun. 
- his aunt bombarded me when I came out of the washroom telling me she was so disappointed I didn’t open her gift. I told her my husband can open it then. He did. It was a homemade blanket that I ended up donating because it had such bad memories attached to it. I cried on the way home. 

Post partum- 
- came to meet the baby the next day after we got home, we asked them to wash hands and they claimed they already did even though they drove over and just got in our house and didn’t. This is a reoccurring thing that happened constantly during the newborn phase 
- immediately said baby looks exactly like my husband, i agreed I see similarities and then I showed a picture of me as a newborn that also looks has similarities and my FIL laughed and said “are you trying to make yourself feel better”. This is ongoing where they are obsessed with my son looking like only their family and nothing like me. And will never stop talking about it. Even features that do look like me I can never bring up because it makes me feel almost pathetic for reaching after I was shut down like that. 
- when I had to breastfeed during the first visit they were already there for a while and they should have just left. We hinted it and his dad said no, some game on tv he wasn’t even paying attention to is in overtime so I had to hobble upstairs with stitches while wearing a diaper. 
- subsequent visits became even worse- every time I held my baby they would say “it’s grandma/grandpas turn” almost within 30 seconds of me holding my baby 
- every ask we had they were offended by- like don’t pass hot coffee over the baby (“IM NOT GOING TO DROP IT”) don’t pick up my baby and walk over to the open bbq to cook (“I WONT DROP HIM”) and so much more. If we ever said don’t do something my FIL would on purpose continue to do it as an act of defiance. Like one time when baby was a couple months old and couldn’t hold his head up he held him to stand on his lap. We all said not to do that and he wouldn’t stop until we just took the baby way.  There’s a million little examples. 

The 1st birthday party: 
- I asked months in advance if a weekend worked for everyone for his bday party. It was a week before his actual bday. They said yes it works. 
- the week of the party they let us know they would like us to plan a dinner for them the same weekend because it’s their anniversary and it’s a special weekend for them. We have never celebrated their anniversary together and didn’t know the date.  We accused them of attempting to hijack our babies bday party and instead we can just get together with my family for his party and do their anniversary the next day since it’s their special day. 
- they got angry and said to forget about the dinner and they’ll come to the party. So fine, I actually got them a gift card to a nice restaurant that I was going to give them after the party anyways which I thought was more than I needed to do for their anniversary. 
- at the party, they were totally overwhelming to our son. Following him around and always in his face and trying to pick him up. He just
Learned to walk so he wants to be on the ground. He also is trying to play with his cousins that are all on my side of the family. At one point my FIL brings him over to a balloon display and hands my son a balloon. I politely take it away and tell my FIL it’s a big choking hazard.  
- Balloon incident: my FIL questions me for like 5 minutes on why he can’t play with balloons, saying other kids were (who are older) and how he wouldn’t let anything bad happen to my son. I tel him well I’m not the other kids mother, I don’t want my child playing with a balloon. He puts everything in his mouth and even if you’re watching it can happen in a split second so it’s a no. He puts his hands around my neck to “jokingly” choke me and then walks away. I’m standing there shocked. I take my son and just walk away and try to forget it. My husband then comes up to me to tel me his dad has been mocking the balloon rule to my grandma and our friends. His dad is still going on about it and my husband says “dad enough about the balloons- whether you agree or not we don’t care- just say okay and respect it”.  It’s not loud enough that anyone notices. His mother then makes a scene and shouts “it’s clear you hate us! Do not speak to us that way!”  Room goes quiet. It’s awkward. They leave. We keep the gift card lol. 
- they call us the next day to “apologize” and say she behaved that way because they are upset about their anniversary and his dad said he doesn’t like when we tell him what to do because he feels we don’t trust him. So it was a sorry but it’s your fault kinda apology. 


Since they are the type of people who just sweep things under the rug they act like nothing has happened when we see them. I can’t be like that so I have a hard time seeing them. Instead I just avoid them as much as I can now. They invited us over next week and a few weeks after that it’s their bday and want to go for dinner. I just gave so much anxiety about seeing them and want to not go but I also don’t want my son around them without me. My husband is good about upholding boundaries, even more so than me but they push more if I’m not there. I don’t want to be accused of withholding their grandchild from them but i just am over feeling anxious every time they are around.

For example, one felt bad because they didn’t have cash to tip that way, and some would just disregard the tip screen completely once I said the drink was covered. Thankfully someone bought a bag of coffee which took a good chunk out of the gift card lol.

I've been trying to save as much as possible which has sort of led me into spending my free time on cheap (and solitary) activities such as reading, working out, playing video games, or biking/running. I have looked into some clubs for these things, but they usually don’t have many people in my age range or tend to be overly competitive. I did briefly try online dating, but it felt too dehumanizing and not many people on the apps were interested in relationships. So that leaves me with spending more on going out to random coffee shops, local events, bars, etc, just to put myself out there. I’ve never really done this before. I know that’s how it works in the movies, but is this actually worthwhile? I expect to hear a lot of either 1. ""You can do all sorts of fun things for free"" or 2. “Keep being responsible in your twenties.” But seriously, like it basically costs money to exist in public these days, is it reasonable to spend some to keep up?

I am very satisfied being single (got divorced almost 4 years ago) but after getting back on track after my divorce (financially and professionally), I struggle with knowing what to do with my free time.

I live in a rural area and work from home, so I dont know  a lot of people in my area and it is not so simple to just go and get coffee in town, since I live quite far from civilization, lol.

I love my current job, I have two amazing dogs and live close to mum and grandma.

Just like everybody else, I count the minutes to end my shift, but then... I sometimes get very bored or really really miss having a friend close to me. Audio messages are not enough anymore. 

Since getting my depresh diagnose over a decade ago, it is hard to focus on books, movies and even work out. This whole boredom situation makes me feel very needy sometimes.

Is this more my depression (which is under control with meds as far as it is possible) or my ""isolated"" location?

what do you usually do after work? I walk and care for my dogs, but hate cooking, so there's nothing much left. Family is close but they dont do much as well. Dont wanna keep brain rotting for hours no more.

1icgpsi,https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1icgpsi/am_i_being_micromanaged_or_is_this_normal_help/,Am I Being Micromanaged or Is This Normal? HELP,"**TL;DR:** I’m freelancing full-time - everyone in the company is -  and I'm redesigning an entire product by myself (UX/UI, design system, prototyping, animations, etc.), but my manager micromanages me to the extreme. He demands daily updates on every small task, monitors my Figma activity in real-time, and even messages me if I’m offline for 10 minutes. Former employees say he’s always been like this. The job pays well, but the constant scrutiny is draining, and I don’t know how to deal with it.

**Hey everyone,**

For the first time in my career, I feel like I’m being severely micromanaged, and I’m not sure if I’m overreacting.

A bit of background: I’ve worked in big corporations, agencies, and startups. In startups, we’d have simple daily standups to review what we did yesterday and discuss any blockers, straightforward stuff. Corporations and agencies were more gradual, with periodic check-ins and a focus on final deliverables.

I’m a Senior Designer with 9+ years of experience, and now I’m the only one left on the team alongside my manager because everyone else has left. Company is totally remote.

My current manager is on another level. At first, I thought I might be overthinking, but after talking to former employees, I found out they hated working with him too.

Here’s what I’m dealing with:

* **Daily Overkill:** I have to give him detailed updates every single day, including screenshots and written explanations of what I did. He wants to know every tiny thing, like if I added a background, changed a color, or updated a flow. People in the company share what they did during the day but is mostly writing ""I did X""
* **Real-Time Monitoring:** He keeps my Figma file open in a tab to track my activity in real time. If he doesn’t see me working, he messages me with things like, *“Is everything okay? I don’t see you on Figma...”*
* **Over-Communication:** He expects me to report every single interaction, even conversations with developers. One time, he asked me what I did during the morning, and when I told him I was talking with developers, his response was, *“You need to let me know when that happens.”*
* **Task Overload:** On top of Figma updates, I have to report my progress in Jira daily and then summarize everything in chat so he knows exactly which task I’m working on. It’s redundant, I already update Figma and explain the tasks there. I spend about 40 minutes every day figuring out what to share, which wastes time.
* **Always Online:** Even though I’m freelancing full-time, like everyone in the company, and technically shouldn’t need to follow strict office hours, I stick to “fake office hours” out of respect. But if I’m offline for 10 minutes, I immediately get a message like, *“Is everything okay? We need to know in case someone needs you.”* Sometimes I wake up a bit later, and he sends a message right away. I can’t even have a coffee in peace.

It’s exhausting. I’ve tried making things easier for him, like adding giant red circles labeled “REVIEW” in Figma to highlight what needs his attention, but it’s still not enough. He says, *“I need to know what you’re doing so I can update the producers,”* but honestly, it feels like an excuse to justify his lack of trust.

Former employees have said, *“It’s never enough,”* and I completely get it now. This constant scrutiny is draining.

Here’s the kicker: I’m redesigning the entire product by myself. I’m talking UX, UI, design systems, prototyping, animations, and even UX writing—all alone. I’m not included in high-level conversations. My role is just to take Jira tickets and execute them. Honestly, I do everything while he acts as a messenger. That’s it.

By the end of the day, I feel frustrated. I avoid him at all costs, every interaction gives me anxiety. I know that every message from him will either question my progress or make an assumption like, *“So, you’re not working on anything now, right?”* Who even said that?

I’ve never had to justify myself like this in any other role, and I have 9 years of experience.

The obvious answer is to leave, but the pay is great, and the job market is terrible right now. I’m putting up with it for the money, but it’s wearing me down, and my productivity is suffering. Other former employees told me he treated them the same way, so this isn’t going to change.

Has anyone else been in a situation like this? What would you do? If I am wrong tell me It's okay maybe it's just my temperement and I can't have managers like this, what comforted me in a sense is that other former employers talked about his behaviour without me not even asking them.",1,1738109705.0,UXDesign,3,1.0,False

I kindly request that the mods of r/2westerneurope4u introduce a new flair for the capital of Austria, [Vienna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna). To support my plea, I’ve put together a list of reasons that not only make this proposal logical but would also benefit the community as a whole, so please here me out:

*Explanatory Note: To make this essay easier to follow, from now on I will refer to “Austrian people from the countryside” as “they,” “them,” or ""Bauer(n).""*

**1 - Stats, Facts & Raw Numbers**

Vienna isn’t just a capital - it once was the beating heart of a mighty empire that was eventually obliterated into oblivion. While the rest of Austria shrank to a ridiculously small size, [Vienna’s population remained more or less unchanged](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gert-Dressel/publication/257795613/figure/fig3/AS:392556471963696@1470604164979/ennas-population-from-the-late-Middle-Ages-to-the-present-note-that-the-boundaries-of.png). Today, we stand strong with 2 million people, while the entire country has a population of merely 9 million. This means that one single city makes up **22% of the country's total population**.

To put it simply, Vienna is way bigger than it should be, and as a result, the rest of the nation is left with a deep, existential [inferiority complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferiority_complex).

*Bonus fact: Vienna is the largest German-speaking city in the world!* >!*(besides Berlin)*!<

**2 - People of Fame**

[Fritzl](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/A959/production/_132335334_mediaitem132335333.jpg), [Hitler](https://images.deccanherald.com/deccanherald%2Fimport%2Fsites%2Fdh%2Ffiles%2Farticle_images%2F2015%2F12%2F22%2F519017.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fmt=webp&fit=max&format=webp&q=70&w=400&dpr=2), [Schwarzenegger](https://images.fineartamerica.com/images/artworkimages/mediumlarge/3/official-portrait-of-california-governor-arnold-schwarzenegger-mountain-dreams.jpg)

That’s it - that’s the *complete* list of all Bauern who’ve ever gained any fame beyond Austria’s borders. Try to name one single Bauer with any notable status who isn’t already on that list. You can’t, because they don’t exist. For comparison, here's a [list of famous people from Vienna.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_from_Vienna)

Sure, they're gonna tell you ""B-b-b-bbuT mOzArT wAs saLzbUrgEr dU dePpaTa wEanA!1!"".

True, and he chose to live and die in Vienna for a reason. [I can visit his grave everyday if I wish so.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Marx_Cemetery)

**3 - Natural Habitat, Cuisine, Sports**

Bauern live in mountain caves, eat bricks of ice for breakfast and snowballs for dinner. Skiing is the only sport they’re halfway decent at, because without flat ground, football (or really any other serious sport) is off the table.

In contrast to that, Vienna is famous for its [stunning architecture](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/61e9b1539516cb18da85d455/e80e8e6d-2ddb-40a9-98ee-3cfd66c723ac/304294260_441319418025375_2019090503296244188_n.jpg), mouth-watering cuisine ([Wiener Schnitzel](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Wiener-Schnitzel02.jpg/1280px-Wiener-Schnitzel02.jpg), [Sachertorte](https://www.sacher.com/en/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/01/original-sacher-torte-3-scaled-e1675170934547.jpg) etc.), [Kaffeehauskultur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viennese_coffee_house_culture) and, of course, being home to the world-famous [Vienna City Marathon](https://www.vienna-marathon.com/).

**4 - Infrastructure & Culture**

Vienna has art, culture and electricity. Bauern, on the other hand, are lucky to have one of those three things (depending on the region), and most of the time, it’s neither culture nor electricity but rather some ['cool looking' rock piles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ez9So0Fp0jA) next to their cave entrances (a little bit like Barry but even less creative).

**5 - Sexual Preferences**

They fuck pigs, cows, goats and various other farm animals on a regular basis.

**6 - God-given Superiority**

As you’re all surely aware, [Vienna consistently secures the #1 spot as the most livable city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Liveability_Ranking) in the world and this has been going on for *decades*. Ever saw [Eisenstadt](https://jguideeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Musee-juif-autrichien-dEisenstadt.-Photo-de-Anton-kurt-Wikipedia-420x280.jpg) on that list? Me neither.

**7 - Language Differences**

The language spoken by locals becomes [completely incomprehensible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeLfb4oqXD4) as soon as you set foot outside Vienna’s borders. This phenomenon only gets worse the further west you travel, so don’t even bother trying.

**8 - Driving a Car**

Bauern can't drive a car in a city. I'd even argue they simply can't drive a car. This is most likely because they’ve spent the last century exclusively behind the wheel of [Traktoren](https://i.ds.at/-wv6xw/c:1200:671:fp:0.500:0.500/rs:fill:750:0/plain/lido-images/2025/01/16/b16daf0f-28aa-4c81-8da7-ff7ebd745369.jpeg) and because they are never exposed to the concept of traffic lights before they reach the capital.

Believe it or not, many Bauern will park their car on the outskirts of Vienna and then take the train into the city because they’re simply too afraid to drive here. Some of them even take pride in this bizarre habit, it's ridiculous and beyond comprehension.

*Pro tip: If you ever drive a car in Vienna and spot a car that* ***DOES NOT*** *have a “W” as the first letter on its license plate, be extra cautious and prepare for the unexpected.*

**9 - The Abhorrent Term** ***“Mou\*tain Germ\*n”***

Every time a fellow European refers to me as “Mou\*tain Germ\*n” my brain instinctively goes *""THERE ARE NO FUCKING MOUNTAINS IN VIENNA BITCH AND I'M NOT GERMAN BTW!!*"", and my heart aches in pain.

I honestly can’t decide which part hurts more - ""Mountain"" or ""German"" and that should give you a good sense of just how insulting this term is to us noble Viennese people.

**10 - Mutual Disrespect**

I know for a fact that they hate me just as much as I hate them. I can’t really blame them, though. I’d feel insecure too if the biggest 'city' within a 100km radius had a population of \~4k people and a single (super)market if you're lucky.

That’s why introducing a new flair wouldn’t just benefit us - it would be a win for them as well!

**11 - Political Attitude**

I’m not going to get too deep into this, but let’s just say that Hitler wasn’t born and raised in that particular corner of the world by accident.

**12 - The State of this Sub**

Aside from the huge gap in development between the capital and the rest of the country, and all the cultural differences I’ve already mentioned, it’s honestly *outrageous and completely unacceptable* that a 'country' like B\*lgium (just one example) gets more flairs than Austria.

And let’s not forget, how many of the existing regional flairs represent populations of 2 million or more? Most of them don’t, so give us the fucking flair we deserve, please.

**13 - Fact-based Racism**

Above all, **I want the ability to be racist towards my own countrymen** and I want to be able to identify them with a single glance. This isn’t a difficult task on subs where everyone speaks German, since their so-called grammar and spelling always reveals them immediately. It’s a different story here.

**Closing Remarks**

I realize that most of the points I’ve raised might not be relatable to the great mods of this great sub. Nevertheless, I sincerely hope that - based on the presented evidence - you understand my struggles and see a reason to act swiftly!

Lastly, I admit this essay has gotten a bit out of hand and might be a long read, but rest assured, I have a private list of **20+ more valid arguments** I’m ready to present, if needed.

**TLDR** \- I have absolutely nothing in common with Bauern and wish to distinguish myself. More importantly, I have an **overwhelming urge to be racist towards my fellow countrymen**, therefore I need to be able to identify them at a single glance.

I recently got into specialty coffee. I'm more of an espresso or tea person, but I figured if I was going to get a nice grinder might as well brew the occasional cup of coffee for when I'm in the mood / want to try my beans in a different way. I bought a v60 and an aeropress, but as got farther in the rabbit hole I learned about the Pulsar. I figured I might as well give it a go as well, given that it can also brew tea in the gongfu method that I like, and see if there's a point in keeping multiple or if I can return some of my equipment to keep my pile of stuff at a minimum. So to test them out I brewed a bunch of cups in different styles with each. I didn't see a lot of information on the pulsar online when I was considering trying it out (especially for tea), so figured I'd post this here and give my thoughts.

**Results TLDR** : Granted this is only first impressions, but I'm extremely happy with the pulsar. We'll see if it sticks, but at this point I'm pretty confident that I'll return the aeropress, the v60, and even my tea infuser. It just seems to me that the pulsar can do everything those things can, but better. All of the pulsar cups I brewed were the best across all different styles, and required less fussing + effort than the other methods. And convenience + clean up was basically just as easy as the other devices. I'm sure with practice you could make equally good brews with any of these, but for convenience and flexibility the Pulsar is the winner for me. Plus it also makes good tea, which for me is honestly kinda more important. (More details below.)

**--- Experiment details + Extra Thoughts ---**

So I don't die of caffeine overdose, I used a Peru medium-roast decaf from a local roaster for all of these. Each cup had a dose of \~15g of coffee.

AP Immersion - I followed the Gagne method for this, grinding at setting 13 on my Baratza encore ESP and using 200g of water (I wanted to do 250 but I didn't have the space). Only difference is I started out inverted, because I find it annoying to get the plunger to not pop out using the regular method. I didn't do a AP ""percolation"" because I tried the Hoffman method before and didn't really like it.

Pulsar Immersion - Same as the gagne AP method, but in the pulsar instead. To be consistent with the AP, also used grind setting 13 and 200g of water.

V60 Percolation - Followed the Hoffman 1-cup V60 method with 250g of water. Used grind setting 15.

Pulsar Immersion / Percolation - This one was a happy accident. Tried to follow the Gagne method for the Pulsar, but I also used grind setting 15 which turned out to be too fine for the water to drain out when trying to keep the water bed at 1 cm. So I decided to just pour in all the water (250g total) after the bloom stage and let it drain out all at once.

Pulsar Percolation - Increased my grind setting to 19 and followed the Gagne pulsar method. This time it worked and the brew finished at \~5 minutes, a little longer than desired but still in the ballpark of what is recommended. Also used 250g water total.

Taste Summary - Comparing between the pulsar brews is pretty much what you'd expect. Immersion has the most body, percolation has the most clean flavor, imm/perc is in the middle of the two. The AP immersion flavor is pretty similar to that of the Pulsar immersion, and the V60 similar to that of the Pulsar percolation. The notable difference is that both the V60 and AP brews have a little bit of bitterness / astringency in them, whereas that is not at all present in the Pulsar brews.

Tea - I also love this for tea! I started doing a gongfu brew of genmaicha each day, starting in the morning and re-infusing the same leaves throughout the day. Normally I do this with a OXO tea-infuser basket and just brew directly in the cup. But brewing in the pulsar instead gives the tea a lot more space to expand into. And it's also less messy, all I have to do is pour in the water, wait, open the valve, wait for the water to drain, close the valve and set it off to the side for later. Only downside is you need a filter for this. I'll eventually buy a metal filter to use with tea, but for now it works perfectly fine to use my spare aeropress or V60 filters (doesn't have to be a perfect fit for tea).",1,1738109558.0,pourover,2,1.0,False

My parents were on dad's VA benefits, SSDI, and teacher pension. Combined that was a good income. Then dad died in Dec. Only the teacher pension stayed. The SSDI went away because mom is too young and not disabled. She was in the process of applying for VA survivors. Mom was a teacher before I was born over 30 years ago but she was a stay at home mom and then a freelance writer. This can pay quite a lot, but less than most people think when they hear she has published books and it's entirely unpredictable and often a lump sum and then nothing for ages. She hasn't had full time traditional employment in decades and she's in her late 50s. I am autistic with very severe executive dysfunction that prevented me from getting a college degree, and all the jobs that I can get without one are in loud environments such as a store that don't work out with my sensory issues. I wish I could go back to work but I don't know what job I could possibly both get and keep. They really don't give out SSDI unless you really need it... If my rental assistance and income goes away I can move in with my mom and be physically safe but I would not be emotionally safe in that home. I am severely allergic to her pets and expect it would be roughly a permanent cold level of symptoms to live with dogs/cats. But what if mom loses the house? My sister is unemployed living with mom right now hasn't been able to find anything for months. If anything happens to mom dad will be spinning in his grave fast enough to uncremate himself he was a wife guy everything he did he did to take care of her she was his world and there's nothing I can do to protect her. I am scared and I don't know what to do. I really, really do not want to lose my home. I am autistic and very bonded to my home (I call it my home/house it's a one bed apartment lol). I don't know if I could mentally survive losing my home. I bought a lot of food, coffee, basic supplies but I don't know what good it'll do me if I wind up without any place to put it. I don't have a support network really I don't know how to bond with anyone outside my family in a long term way, and my family is kind of lowkey/mildly abusive. Like I know they'd never physically harm me and they don't swear at me it's hard to explain. But really dad was the one mostly doing that and he's gone.

Would the rtx 5080 be enough to brute force good frame rates even with my older components?","These are my current specs. I had an rtx 4090 but had to sell it awhile back and stayed with my older rx 6800, but I remember when I tested the 4090 on final fantasy xv (ultra settings, 4k) compared to someone that had a more modern CPU and other parts on youtube I was getting about 15-20 fps less with the same rtx 4090, but still very playable (above 60 fps). Should the 5080 hopefully be able to still hit ultra settings on my set up, or would my older CPU, motherboard, and RAM bottleneck it too much?

I was able to play ff7 remake easily at Max settings with the 4090, but that of course is 3 years older than ff7 rebirth so I'm worried that even if I get the 5080 my old components will bottleneck performance too much.

The listed specs for ultra settings by square enix require at least a rtx 4080 AND at least a 10th Gen Intel CPU to run, and mine is month gen.

I recently graduated from a BSc program in Design from SFU and now that I have free time again I’m ready to get back into socializing! All my friends have kids now and/or have moved out of town because rent here sucks though, haha. So I’m looking to build some new connections.

I’m not into joining a sports team or hiking group, so I’ve been wracking my brain trying to think of what I could do that doesn’t also cost an arm and a leg or feel like a job. When I was younger I used to go to the local movie rental and grab whatever looked weird or interesting and have a bunch of people over for a watch party and that was pretty fun. I’m looking for queer friendly people who like anything from high concept art films to fun b movie trash. I don’t like films with graphic realistic violence (like Saw) or anything too problematic (like Dallas Buyer’s Club) for no defensible artistic purpose, but besides that my taste is pretty varied. I like black and white German cinema from pre WWII (the original Nosferatu), 80s American exploitation film (Conan The Barbarian), classic Japanese surrealist anime (Ghost in the Shell and Paprika), Italian horror (Suspiria), French art film drama (Perfume), schlocky American horror (The Thing, Evil Dead), irreverent British comedy (Shaun of the Dead). Pretty much anything fun and weird or artsy and interesting.

Two movies that I’m currently excited to see are Love Hurts and the new Nosferatu.

My wife and I are happy to host but can also come over to yours if you’re not too far away. Anything in the Mount Pleasant, Kensington, and East Van area is doable for us. She’s also interested in getting some party video games and board games, if you’re into that. We’re both queer, obviously, and our politics lean far left, so we’d get along best with people who feel the same way. I’m into science and art and love talking about whatever interesting paper I’ve just read or whatever sci-fi show I’m currently watching. I watch a lot of science educators on Youtube like Miniminuteman (Archeology) and Kurzgasagt, skeptic channels like Genetically Modified Skeptic and Rebecca Watson, media analysis like Jacob Geller, queer content creators like Philosophy Tube and Dead Domain, and political channels like The Majority Report w/ Sam Seder. My favorite podcast right now is Behind the Bastards and the last great show I watched was Hysteria! which was loosely based on the satanic panic and has Bruce Campbell in it. The last great show I went to in town was Dandy’s Nutcracker: An Interactive Drag Comedy Show at the Rio Theatre. My wife is into video games, politics, and tech. Her favorite video game right now is Baldur’s Gate 3, her favorite political comedians are Jon Stewart and Jon Oliver, and she’s into retro gaming (super nintendo, dreamcast, atari). We both have pretty low interest in stuff like energy healing, alternative medicine, and conspiracy theories.

If you’re into the idea of bringing over some snacks and having a chill night in, gimme a dm and tell me a bit about yourself and what kind of movies you’re into. I’d love to meet up for coffee and see if we have some stuff in common.",6,1738109130.0,Vancouver4Friends,1,1.0,False

1icggq5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1icggq5,Uneven finish after doing a coffee dye,"This weekend I decided to coffee dye my white converses as I didn’t wear them much and figured I’d wear them more if they were a little less flashy. I had spilled a little coffee on them a few weeks prior and my wife said I should try a coffee-dye, so I figured why not. I watched a few videos and read a couple articles, but nothing was very in depth so I figured it must be a pretty straight forward process.

I started just by scrubbing the shoes clean and putting them in the washing machine. I read that if they were soaked already, the process would work a little better. Once the washing machine was near done, I got a 5 gallon bucket and filled with hot water, mixing in quite a bit of coffee grounds. When the wash was done, I put a couple small rocks in the shoes to help hold completely submerged. I swished the shoes around a couple times while the soaked for roughly 75 minutes. Once done soaking, I took them out and spent quite a while attempting to rinse all the remaining coffee and grounds out of the shoes until there was mostly clean water coming from the shoes. I then left out to dry.

As you can see from the first 4 photos, the dye is quite inconsistent as they’ve almost completely dried, though through most of the drying process they looked pretty consistent, as shown in the 5th photo. Where did I go wrong? Is there an easy fix for this?",1,1738109014.0,Customsneakers,3,1.0,False

# Starbucks Brews Up a Turnaround

Starbucks may still be nursing a hangover from its tough 2024, but there’s a glimmer of caffeine-fueled hope. The coffee giant reported a 4% drop in same-store sales for Q1, a smaller decline than Wall Street’s 5.5% expectation and a notable improvement from the previous quarter's 7% slide. Investors were perked up, sending shares up 3% in after-hours trading.

**Reigniting the Roast**  
  
CEO Brian Niccol, just five months into his tenure, has been steaming ahead with his “Back to Starbucks” strategy. From nixing the nondairy milk upcharge to revamping condiment bars and rolling out cozy, customer-centric policies, the company is doubling down on improving the in-store experience. Niccol has even brought in former Taco Bell colleagues to help brew a smoother operational blend.

But it’s not all lattes and smiles yet. Traffic to U.S. stores dropped 8%, and China—a key market—saw same-store sales fall 6% as Starbucks leaned into discounts to compete with budget-friendly rivals like Luckin Coffee.

**Profit vs. Progress**  
  
Starbucks posted $9.4 billion in revenue for the quarter, flat year-over-year but ahead of estimates. Earnings per share hit $0.69, also topping expectations. However, net income took a 23% hit, reflecting investments in Niccol’s turnaround plan and wage hikes for baristas. Operating margins were pinched, but analysts remain optimistic about the long-term payoff.

**A Latte on the Line**  
  
The chain’s overhaul extends beyond the café counter. Starbucks plans to scale back new store openings and renovations in 2025, redirecting funds to fuel its comeback efforts. Layoffs are also on the horizon as the company reshapes its corporate structure for clearer accountability.

Niccol’s bold moves—and Wall Street’s vote of confidence—suggest the turnaround might just have the steam to deliver. For now, Starbucks is walking the fine line between brewing better customer experiences and balancing profitability.

# Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic Gets Green Light for Kidney Disease Treatment

Novo Nordisk’s blockbuster drug, Ozempic, just expanded its resume. The FDA approved the GLP-1 injection to treat chronic kidney disease in adults with Type 2 diabetes, offering a lifeline for millions battling progressive kidney failure and related cardiovascular risks.

**A Lifesaver in a Syringe**  
  
Ozempic has already been a game-changer for diabetes and weight loss, but this approval takes it further. The drug slashed the risk of severe kidney outcomes—think kidney failure or death—from 24% to 29% in trials. For a condition affecting 37 million Americans, that’s huge. Novo’s Chief Medical Officer Stephen Gough called it a breakthrough in addressing diseases that “cluster within the same individuals,” targeting diabetes, obesity, kidney disease, and cardiovascular conditions with a single injection.

**A Competitive Landscape**  
  
This FDA nod strengthens Ozempic’s position as the most broadly approved GLP-1 drug. Novo now faces increased rivalry from Eli Lilly, whose own GLP-1 drugs are making waves, but with this approval, Novo aims to maintain its lead. The decision could also shake up the dialysis market, echoing the phase-three trial’s results that caused kidney dialysis stocks to plummet last year.

**Beyond the Injection:** Ozempic’s approval marks another win for GLP-1 drugs, which are proving their value beyond diabetes. The broader implications—like reducing cardiovascular and kidney risks—could reshape treatment strategies and encourage expanded insurance coverage.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

The Federal Reserve kicks off its first meeting of the year, with inflation and interest rates taking center stage. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is set to deliver the verdict tomorrow, and while markets are watching closely, there’s little expectation of a rate cut—current odds stand at a slim 0.5%.  
  
Tomorrow’s after-hours session will bring updates from three tech heavyweights: Tesla, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms. Their numbers are poised to offer fresh insights into how the sector is navigating a volatile market landscape as 2025 gets rolling.

# Before Market Open: 

* The first chipmaker to report earnings since DeepSeek’s AI bombshell, **ASML Holding** has some explaining to do. With analysts eager for updates on capital spending, the real spotlight will be on how tariffs and geopolitical tension are squeezing the company’s margins. Shares have been under pressure, but Wall Street remains optimistic with every analyst covering the stock issuing a “buy” rating. Consensus expectations sit at $6.71 EPS and $9.02 billion in revenue. ($ASML)

# After Market Close: 

* **IBM** may have roots in legacy tech, but it’s been steadily planting seeds in AI, cloud computing, and quantum technology. These forward-looking investments make the company more than just a relic of tech’s past, even if its pace of innovation is deliberate. Add to that a stable dividend that offers a cushion for patient investors, and IBM is quietly making its case as a long-term play. Analysts anticipate $3.79 EPS on $17.6 billion in revenue this quarter. ($IBM)",3,1738108919.0,Wallstreetbetsnew,0,1.0,False

However, net income took a 23% hit, reflecting investments in Niccol’s turnaround plan and wage hikes for baristas. Operating margins were pinched, but analysts remain optimistic about the long-term payoff.

**A Latte on the Line**  
  
The chain’s overhaul extends beyond the café counter. Starbucks plans to scale back new store openings and renovations in 2025, redirecting funds to fuel its comeback efforts. Layoffs are also on the horizon as the company reshapes its corporate structure for clearer accountability.

Niccol’s bold moves—and Wall Street’s vote of confidence—suggest the turnaround might just have the steam to deliver. For now, Starbucks is walking the fine line between brewing better customer experiences and balancing profitability.

# Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic Gets Green Light for Kidney Disease Treatment

Novo Nordisk’s blockbuster drug, Ozempic, just expanded its resume. The FDA approved the GLP-1 injection to treat chronic kidney disease in adults with Type 2 diabetes, offering a lifeline for millions battling progressive kidney failure and related cardiovascular risks.

**A Lifesaver in a Syringe**  
  
Ozempic has already been a game-changer for diabetes and weight loss, but this approval takes it further. The drug slashed the risk of severe kidney outcomes—think kidney failure or death—from 24% to 29% in trials. For a condition affecting 37 million Americans, that’s huge. Novo’s Chief Medical Officer Stephen Gough called it a breakthrough in addressing diseases that “cluster within the same individuals,” targeting diabetes, obesity, kidney disease, and cardiovascular conditions with a single injection.

**A Competitive Landscape**  
  
This FDA nod strengthens Ozempic’s position as the most broadly approved GLP-1 drug. Novo now faces increased rivalry from Eli Lilly, whose own GLP-1 drugs are making waves, but with this approval, Novo aims to maintain its lead. The decision could also shake up the dialysis market, echoing the phase-three trial’s results that caused kidney dialysis stocks to plummet last year.

**Beyond the Injection:** Ozempic’s approval marks another win for GLP-1 drugs, which are proving their value beyond diabetes. The broader implications—like reducing cardiovascular and kidney risks—could reshape treatment strategies and encourage expanded insurance coverage.

# Starbucks Brews Up a Turnaround

Starbucks may still be nursing a hangover from its tough 2024, but there’s a glimmer of caffeine-fueled hope. The coffee giant reported a 4% drop in same-store sales for Q1, a smaller decline than Wall Street’s 5.5% expectation and a notable improvement from the previous quarter's 7% slide. Investors were perked up, sending shares up 3% in after-hours trading.

**Reigniting the Roast**  
  
CEO Brian Niccol, just five months into his tenure, has been steaming ahead with his “Back to Starbucks” strategy. From nixing the nondairy milk upcharge to revamping condiment bars and rolling out cozy, customer-centric policies, the company is doubling down on improving the in-store experience. Niccol has even brought in former Taco Bell colleagues to help brew a smoother operational blend.

But it’s not all lattes and smiles yet. Traffic to U.S. stores dropped 8%, and China—a key market—saw same-store sales fall 6% as Starbucks leaned into discounts to compete with budget-friendly rivals like Luckin Coffee.

**Profit vs. Progress**  
  
Starbucks posted $9.4 billion in revenue for the quarter, flat year-over-year but ahead of estimates. Earnings per share hit $0.69, also topping expectations. However, net income took a 23% hit, reflecting investments in Niccol’s turnaround plan and wage hikes for baristas. Operating margins were pinched, but analysts remain optimistic about the long-term payoff.

I do hope some of you find this info useful to some extent!


Getting Started:

The first thing anyone should do when they start up a new survival save is begin exploring and collecting materials. Clothing is exceptionally important to survive the cold, as the average temperature will drop permanently at set intervals. 

For new players, Mountain Town is an ideal starting region, providing a large number of man-made structures and loot and a decent diversity of wildlife. 
If you get lost? Don't worry! The maps get easier to learn with time, and the wiki actually has maps for every in game region if you're a visual learner. 

If you have trouble finding food or water, don't panic! Starvation is incredibly slow, allowing you ample time to search for something edible. Here are some general locations to find food in a pinch:

* Follow water such as rivers and ponds. Cattail stalks make excellent easy food early on, and even contain vitamin C

* Glove boxes in cars

* Dead animal carcasses

Water can be found in any toilet in limited amounts! I promise, it's perfectly safe. 

You should always check the visors in cars, as some contain memento notes that lead to valuable loot. 
Car hoods can hide car batteries, which can be used to fix transmitter towers, traded for recipes, or broken down into lead for bullets. 


Hunting:

Now that you've done a little exploration and gotten some food and water, it's time to look at the next steps to a long and successful run.   If you're playing on stalker difficulty or below, you may have already found some tools, or if luck is in your favor, a firearm. These will no doubt improve anyone's chances. Even a flare gun can be used to kill larger animals with a well placed headshot.

Just remember, everything has durability. 

On the chance that you haven't found a firearm, you can always work towards making a bow and arrow. 
Using a hatchet or a hacksaw, chop down any birch or maple saplings you may come across and bring them inside to cure. These will become your bow, as well as high quality arrows later on. 

Rabbits and Ptarmigan are some of the earliest accesable food sources. Being small game, they can be stunned with a well aimed stoned. 
It may take practice, but once you stun your prey, you need to grab them with the interaction button and finish the kill. 

Ptarmigans will net you meat and down. The down is useful for making an improvised down bedroll later on, but take considerable time to harvest. 
Rabbits will give meat, one rabbit skin, and gut. Catch enough and you could make mittens or a hat in addition to a bow. 

For big game, deer are the most abundant and plentiful. If you manage to kill one with either a gun or a bow with simple arrows, the hides can be turned into boots or pants. 
Moose are also available as big game prey, but they are dangerous and are substantially less frequent to find. Their hide however can make a satchel, giving +5KG to your carry capacity as long as it is equipped. 

The remaining 3 animals are all predatory and should be avoided whenever possible. Wolves, bears, and cougars will all confront and attack you if you get too close, to varying degrees of effect. Their meat is also prone to parasites, even if you cook them. 
Because of this, it's normally best to avoid hunting predators until you either level up the cooking skill to level 5 or reach a point where their hides alone are worth the risk in confrontation. 

Any meat or fish that you store outside will deteriorate much slower. If you get a lot of meat and have nowhere to store it, try setting it outside your safehouse and cooking it as needed. 


Fishing:

As time goes on, vitamin C will become harder and harder to find as you exhaust man-made food options. 
Fishing is the best way to maintain your vitamin C levels, as well as providing sustainable food in a variety of regions and a renewable supply of lamp oil for the storm lantern. 

To fish, you will need at a minimum a fishing tackle, a tool to break the ice, and a suitably deep body of water. 
When you break the ice fishing hole and begin to fish, it's important to note that your fatigue meter (sleep) affects the frequency of your fishing line breaking, so fishing should ideally be done when well rested. 

If you are able to craft a fishing tip-up, a strategy I like to use is placing a second ice fishing hole next to the current one. Place the fishing tip-up in the hole and begin fishing manually in the other. 
When you hear a bell chime, you simply need to stop your current fishing and interact with the tip-up to collect your catch. Rinse and repeat until you reach your desired goal. 


Fending off the wildlife:

Predatory animals are, for the most part, a nuisance rather than a true threat. (Except a certain large and aggressive kitty cat that is)

All animals have certain weaknesses that can be exploited to tilt the tables in your favor should you find a bear charging at you or a pack of wolves following you. 

In the example of regular wolves, they are terrified of lit flares and torches. While holding a flare or torch, even if the wolf is allowed to approach, it will simply stand stationary and growl at the player. Throwing the item at the wolf will normally scare the wolf off entirely, as will a gun under most circumstances. 

For later game players, a bearskin coat can allow you to scare wolves away passively in many cases.

Aiming a gun at a wolf that is agroed on the player causes the wolf to break into a run and charge the player. If you do not feel confident in the shot, it may be best to go for scaring it away instead.

Bears, while incredibly sturdy and hard to scare, have absolute piss poor maneuverability. 
They're slower and easier to avoid than wolves, however they don't allow the player to struggle should they attack. Instead, upon a bear mauling, the player loses an amount equal to roughly 90% of your current health, as well as high damage to worn clothing. 
You can scare a bear with a shot from a distress pistol, should you have one. 
If scaring it isn't an option, you can outmaneuver them with practice. 

Timber wolves are just regular wolves with a real pack mentality. They attack all at once, surrounding the player from all sides. 
Marine flares can keep them at bay, and throwing flares or torches can damage their morale meter. 
If possible, build a fire immediately. If not, find a position where you have your back against something solid. Keep them from getting behind you and try to take them down as they run in for the frontal charge. 

Cougars are... Well. If you hear one, it's probably best to back away and go home. If that's not an option, cougars have an obnoxious amount of health. 
If you can find a tree branch or raised position to stand on, oftentimes you can confuse the cougar into either walking away or letting you kill it. Beyond that, I have no tips on that cat from hell unfortunately. 


Traveling:

Exploration across the great bear can be punishing at times, especially to the unprepared. 

The important things to take into account when traveling are carry capacity, food and water, and equipment. 

Carry capacity is difficult, especially as time goes on and you obtain more tools and better clothing. That being said there are a few things that can help carry capacity. 
Crafting a moose hide satchel is one method, adding +5KG capacity and taking up one accessory slot. 
A more passive method is to obtain the well fed bonus. By surviving 72 hours without letting your calories drop to starvation levels will grant another +5KG capacity. 
The technical backpack is an item located in the northwest corner of ash canyon at the abandoned gold mine and comes accompanied with crampons. This adds +5KG permanently to your capacity, while crampons in an accessory slot can drastically reduce fatigue during rope climbs and sprain chances on slopes. 

Combined, you can get up to +15KG capacity, not including the travoi which acts as a sled for longer distance or heavier transports. 
Making any type of meat pie will add an additional +3KG, however this is normally not worth the cost of cooking. 

Food and water, while being necessities, are often either under or over packed by people at one point or another. 
My personal take on how much to bring on an exploration varies based on where I'm going, however 2L of water is typically a safe bet, along with a MINIMUM of 1500 calories of food. 
Why these numbers specifically? 
2L of water is often enough to reach most destinations without having to stop to boil more water, and is enough that emergency teas or coffee isn't a hassle. 
750 calories provides enough food for a 9 hour sleep, which is enough to restore a considerable amount of condition. 
Should exploration go south, or should you not be able to find food along the way, this is 2 days of very valuable time. 
Hunting and gathering along the way is normally a feasible way of sustaining yourself as you go, but be prepared and bring something for emergencies. 

The last, and definitely not the least, is equipment. Everything from guns, crowbars, hatchets, knives, saws, and even simple tools or fire starting materials. Equipment is heavy. 

Too many times when I was starting out did I struggle over what to drop to make a rope climb or what to bring because I was bad at inventory management. 
Starting out, keep it simple. A crowbar, knife and hatchet, matches, and some kind of weapon when you get one. These basic tools can get you into most areas, gather most resources, and provide the easiest methods of sustaining yourself. 
As you go gather more tools and weapons and such, take care to make sure you keep track of where you leave duplicates. As you learn the map, you'll learn what tools are useless in certain areas and which ones are a must. 

When traveling long distances, drop the rifle and grab a revolver or a bow to save weight. Leave the crowbar at home if you're going somewhere you've already looted multiple times. 
Leave the hacksaw and the simple tools. Hacksaws only have a few niche uses, and very little requires simple tools to repair or craft. 
Dont bring loads of accelerant or 2 different sets of cookware. Travel light, and your stash will thank you later. 

Niche tools and places:

Some tools and places in the game serve very limited purpose. The hacksaws only unique uses are to harvest metal scrap from certain objects, as well as saw open the cargo crates on the summit of Timberwolf Mountain. 

Heavy Hammers serve a decent defense weapon against wolf attacks, however they are a requirement for forging improvised tools and metal arrowheads. A side note, they can also be used to crush acorns into acorn grounds or break ice to fish. 

Crowbars open jammed and locked containers and curtains doors across the island. Beyond that, they are a decent ice breaking tool. 

Simple tools and their variant, advanced tools, only allow the repair of certain tools and limited crafting capability. They aren't required for crafting, although they can speed up certain processes significantly. 

Forges are few and far between. They can be found in Desolation Point, Forlorn Muskeg, Broken Railroad, and Forsaken Airfield to name a few I have used before. With enough fuel, coal being required to reach the right temperature, you can craft a variety of improvised tools and items. 

Prepper caches are set locations that can contain various types of loot. Be warned, they are always empty on interloper. 

The gunsmithing bench is a crafting location located at the Bleak Inlet cannery and the Black Rock Penitentiary. Both are locked behind a keypad, with the code hidden at a location in their respective regions. 
Both locations allow the crafting of bullets, gun powder, and noise makers. With an aurora, the milling machine nearby each location can be used to make a variety of repairs. 

And finally, Forsaken Airfield. This area is colder than most in the base part of the great bear. It's the first area of the Tales From The Far Territory expansion, and is a required visit to begin the Tales, as well as a few intermediate stops during the quests themselves. 

Advanced Tips:

If you've survived long enough to see the far regions of the world and create better gear from mother nature's materials, congrats! But maybe there's some more I can share with you.

For instance, fires will burn considerably longer the colder it is. 
This means if you start a fire outside, so long as it's protected by wind, you will get more length for your firewood. 
For example, a fire burning for 1 hour indoors, under the right cold, could burn for 2 outside. 
If you need to cook lots of food or boil lots of water on a budget of sticks, an outdoor fire will save the day. 

Keeping with the theme of temperature, there are weather patterns in the game to keep an eye out for, with some varying on region. 
A prime example is if you have a blizzard in one of the central regions such as Mystery Lake or Pleasant Valley, once the snow clears up, it's typically considerably warmer than normal provided it's still daytime. 
In most regions, there's a sweet spot for traveling and exploration ranging from roughly 4 hours after noon, to just after nightfall where the temperature will be warmer other times of day. This is great for long distance travels or exploration with limited protection from the elements. 
(Disclaimer: this will not affect blizzards, which are random and can be deadly. Some regions, such as Coastal Highway, have a more fluctuating temperature)

For those of you playing with guns, but struggling to hit your target at a distance without level 5, try this!
Drop an item on the ground. Any item works. 
Crouch behind the item, and notice that the reticle will appear in the middle of the screen, despite not looking down. 
When you first aim down sight, your gun will almost always be directed on the reticle. Using the dot, you can choose your target, pick your moment, and fire as soon as you shoulder the rifle. 

For the more rugged survivalist, hitting something with a stone is as easy as aiming just above the tip of your thumb. You can use the rest of your fingers as a guide to acclimate yourself to how high to aim to account for distances, and it makes the throwing considerably more accurate. 

Many locations across the maps offer rope climbs to reach lower or higher locations. If you drink 0.25L of coffee by canceling the drinking action at the proper time, you can still get the fatigue reduction bonus. 
By doing this, you can effectively limit fatigue buildup as you climb, and it doesn't take a whole cup of coffee to do so. 
This works best when paired with crampons. 

Due to the difficulty in obtaining some of the required safehouse customization items, such as the meat curing box, one of the best survival foods for long distance travel in the late game is actually a breyerhouse pie! 
Given that they take a variety of types of meat to cook, many people shy away from it. By the late game, many people will have stockpiled venison outside their safehouse. 
With cooking level 5, and a single ptarmigan and rabbit, you can normally make 2 of these pies. Despite not having a vitamin C content, they provide enough calories that half of one pie can feed you enough for a 10 hour rest, at a fraction of the typical carry weight of most food items. 

For vitamin C on the go, when fishing isn't an option, birch bark tea is an amazing thing. Not only can you store it in a thermos as a source of slow condition regeneration with every cup, but the prepared bark is relatively light and makes for an ideal way to get the warming up buff in cold regions and minimal effort. 
As long as you've maintained your vitamin C levels before beginning your trip, birch bark tea can hold you over for days without Vitamin C.

When you're maintaining your clothes, don't forget that you can use fishing tackle as an impromptu sewing kit. This also applies to crafting clothing. 
The best tool for breaking apart manmade furniture as well as ice is the hammer, simply due to the repair costing only 1 fir firewood. 

If you want to escape a wolf without using any of your precious supplies, an unfortunate rabbit or deer can save you! You can lead a wolf following you to a rabbit or deer, and the wolf may give chase. This let's you either continue unbothered, or potentially get the wolf spoils in addition to the sacrificial rabbit or deer. 

And the LAST tip I can give is that the game is single player. Play however you want to have fun, at any difficulty. My guide is more just to cover a range of things that may help certain people, but I know it won't be helpful to all. 
This game can be whatever you want it to be in terms of where you go and what you do, so good luck yall!",7,1738108684.0,thelongdark,4,1.0,False

She mentioned that she was visiting but she didn't actually do anything for a living. I tried not to think too much about it and well thought she must be in between jobs. I asked out for coffee the next day and walked into the city to meet her during my lunch break.

She was gorgeous in person and I got us some coffee and we sat down for a chat. She hardly shared much about herself or what she did and was over all extremely vague about her life. It was so strange. I kept thinking why did you agree to the date if you didn't want to share anything about yourself.

The biggest thing that made me think was strange was how whenever I asked her what she did or where she was heading to next she just kept saying she hasn't decided yet. I kept wondering if she ran away from home or something or even if she was an escort which still didn't really add up.

The Bothered Child  

What is a world? A world can be many things; it can be vast and endless, or it can reflect someone else's perspective on life. A world can exist as a dream or as an inspiration. A world can be created or destroyed. It may have a god or be home to many gods. I dream of a world, but it's not just a dream; it feels more like a fragile creation, like a sandcastle. And just like all sandcastles, a wave will eventually crash upon it. -E)  

The sound of muffled voices surrounds me, and the flickering light in the room fades. My vision feels blurred and dull like the room is losing its vibrancy. In the distance, faint piano notes shimmer like a distorted memory, as if the pianist is trying to recreate a song I once knew. I struggled to remember what I was thinking.  

""Evan, are you okay?"" John asks.  

""Yeah, I'm fine. Just thinking about... ne—never mind.""  

""Oh, come on, don't be like that, Evan. I know you. You're always silent when something is bothering you.""  

""John, why do you always try to read me whenever you think something is wrong? Why did you invite me here in the first place?""  

""Well, I haven't heard from you in a while. I thought it would be nice if we caught up.""  

""Hey, how have you been? How was work at the hospital?"" John asks.  

I lean forward, not breaking eye contact with John. ""Wait, how did you know I work there? We haven't interacted in over a year.""  

John's eyes are wide and unblinking as he sips his coffee, like a doll’s.  

""Well, Evan, it's a small town. All I had to do was ask, and at least one person would give me the answer.""  

His words float around us, echoing like a distant melody. I want to deny it, but the town wraps itself around me like a dream, everything too vivid and surreal. It feels strange that he would ask about me as if I were a figment of this hazy reality. The townsfolk shift and merge, their glances laden with secrets—time slips and twists, distorting my sense of belonging. 

As I move through the streets, it becomes clear that beneath the ordinary facade lies a web of mysteries I am yet to unravel. I can't shake the feeling that I am merely a fleeting dream in the town's eternal story.  

""Evan, how is it working at such a depressing place? How are your cats doing?""  

""They're doing fine. That reminds me; I need to get them some litter before my apartment starts to smell like sulfur again.""  

The dialogue persists.  

The drive home stretches out endlessly, a surreal journey that blurs the line between reality and reverie. The fading light of dusk paints the sky in hues of purple and orange, while the landscape outside the window becomes a soft, indistinct blur. It feels as if time has slowed to a crawl, moving deliberately against me and stretching each moment into an eternity.  

I find myself lost in thought, with the hum of the engine and the soft rhythm of the tires on the asphalt creating a soothing backdrop for my wandering mind. Each mile seems to resonate with the weight of my reflections, making the trip feel both familiar and disconcertingly distant—as if I were traversing not just roads but the very fabric of my memories.  

Despite having driven for the past twenty minutes, the lingering scent of bleach fills my nostrils, adding to my sense of unease. I can feel headlights right behind me as I drive past stretches of complex roads and strip malls, not taking my eyes off the road for even a moment, in fear of what might be lingering behind me.  

As I open the car door and step onto the pavement, I retrieve my bags from the trunk, feeling their weight pull at me. Whistles and scrapes echo around me, creating an uneasy atmosphere.  

Navigating the worn concrete steps to my front door, I focus on not dropping anything. Just as I reach the door, I hear a whisper behind me: ""How are your cats doing?"" My heart races as I fumble for my key, finally managing to unlock the door. I rush inside and shut it firmly behind me, the silence of my home wrapping around me.  

""Evan, that couldn't have been real, right? I might have just been imagining things."" I try to lift myself back to the peephole, and with my suspicions confirmed, I see no one there. ""Sigh. I need some sleep.""  

I pick up my bags and awkwardly set them down in the corner, slightly askew.  

""Mew, mew."" ""Oh hi, Visco! Hi, Churro! How are my favorite boys doing? Were you guys behaving while I was gone?"" After feeding my cats, I walk down the hallway, not bothering to check any corridors. I just need sleep, so I throw myself into bed and quickly fall into a deep slumber.  

""I never existed to you,"" the voice exclaims.  

""Evan, what? Where am I?""  

""THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT.""  

Evan gasps and wakes up, frustrated. Another bad dream—I'm getting sick of this bullshit.

>Let's try again:

I speak to a handful of founders every day about design (run NUMI, $2m ARR + Flowglad, in alpha).

I’ve noticed that a lot of them don’t really understand how to conduct user research. They’re *curious*, but maybe don’t have the experience so here are some tips I share with them as a product designer:

1. **Just watch 'em:** See how users act in their natural habitat, where they'd actually use your product. You'll learn how they really behave and spot their pain points.
2. **Diary time:** Ask users to jot down their thoughts and feelings while using your product for a bit. You'll get a feel for their habits and emotions over time.
3. **Let them help design:** Invite users to join you in designing the product. They'll feel more invested, and you'll get a better idea of what they want.
4. **Job-to-be-done chats:** Focus on what your users are trying to do with your product. Talk to them about why they want to do these things and what outcomes they're after.
5. **Test on the fly:** Run quick, informal user tests in public spots like coffee shops or parks. You'll get fast feedback from all sorts of people.
6. **Prototype face-off:** Make a few different prototypes and see which one users like best. This way, you can quickly figure out what works and what doesn't.
7. **Lights, camera, action:** Get users to film themselves using your product and talking about their experience. You'll get an up-close look at their thoughts and feelings.
8. **Make research fun:** Turn user research into games or challenges. Users will have a blast and be more willing to share their thoughts.
9. **Social media stalking (kinda):** Keep an eye on social media for chats about your product or industry. You'll catch trends and pain points you might've missed otherwise.
10. **Team up with influencers:** Work with well-known folks in your industry to get feedback and reach their followers for user research. It's a win-win situation.
11. **Slack invite:** There is nothing scarier than having your customer have access to your time whenever they want. Equally, there is nothing more rewarding than having your customer have access to you whenever they want :) Embrace the scary…odds are, it’s good for you AND your company.

Is there anything you think should be added to this list? Always love to hear how other founders stay close to their customers!

I’m trying to decide on a new grinder setup and am torn between two options:
	1.	Lagom 01 + Lagom Casa
	2.	Weber EG-1 + Weber Key

I’m currently using Mazzer Philos, but I plan to sell it once I upgrade. My goal is to have conical burrs for pour-over and flat burrs for espresso. I drink a wide variety of coffee every day, around 5-10 cups, including:
	•	Espresso (light-medium roasts)
	•	Pour-over (light to dark roasts)
	•	Milk-based drinks (medium-dark roasts)

I also use a Decent Espresso DE1XL, which makes experimenting fun and easy—but picking a grinder has been a headache. Here’s the breakdown of the two setups, including costs and logistics.

Lagom 01 + Lagom Casa Setup
	•	Lagom 01: ~£1,950 GBP ($2,650 USD).
	•	Lagom Casa: ~£285 GBP ($389 USD).
	•	Shipping & Customs: Option-O offers 

reasonable shipping costs to the UK, and customs duties are relatively low compared to Weber. The total setup cost (excluding shipping) is approximately £2,500 GBP.

Option-O also seems to be known for their excellent support, with users praising their responsiveness and friendly service.


Weber EG-1 + Weber Key Setup
	•	Weber EG-1: ~£3,450 GBP (€3,995 EUR).
	•	Weber Key: ~£1,635 GBP (€1,895 EUR).
	•	Shipping & Customs: Shipping to the UK 

can cost between £500-£1,000, and customs duties + VAT will further increase the cost. Total setup cost (excluding shipping) is approximately £6000 GBP, over £3,500 GBP more expensive than the Lagom setup.

Sadly, Weber Workshops seems to be criticised for their customer support. Some customers report communication issues, including unfulfilled promises and inconsistent sales information. Like Sprometheus incident. 

The Weber setup is significantly more expensive. Is the EG-1 truly worth the extra £3,500 + GBP for my usage?

Also, do you think an average coffee enthusiast would notice a big enough difference in daily use to justify the price of the Weber setup?

I know logically it makes so much more sense to get Option O set up. But at the same time, I am just so drawn to Weber products haha maybe all the hype they get or have got in the past.

Understanding Teeth Whitening and Coffee Sensitivity

Teeth whitening is a delicate process that temporarily opens the pores of your tooth enamel, making them more vulnerable to staining. During this sensitive period, your teeth are like a fresh canvas - easily marked by dark-colored beverages and foods. Coffee, with its rich brown color and strong pigmentation, is particularly notorious for causing rapid discoloration.

Why Coffee is Problematic After Teeth Whitening

Immediate Effects of Coffee on Whitened Teeth

1. Increased Staining Potential
2. Enamel Porosity
3. Color Absorption
4. Reduced Whitening Results

**Recommended Waiting Period**

Most dental professionals recommend waiting at least 24-48 hours before consuming coffee after teeth whitening. This crucial window allows your tooth enamel to **remineralize and close its pores**, reducing the risk of immediate staining.

Tips for Coffee Lovers Post-Whitening

Strategies to Enjoy Coffee While Protecting Your Smile

1. Wait 48 Hours Before Drinking Coffee
2. Use a Straw to Minimize Direct Contact
3. Rinse Mouth Immediately After Drinking
4. Consider Lighter Roast Coffees
5. Practice Good Oral Hygiene

Alternatives During the Waiting Period

Long-Term Coffee Consumption and Tooth Whiteness

While temporary abstinence is crucial, long-term coffee drinkers can still maintain their white smile with proper care. Regular dental hygiene, professional cleanings, and occasional touch-up whitening treatments can help counteract coffee's staining effects.

Interesting Statistic: According to a dental health survey, **64% of Americans drink coffee daily**, making stain management a significant concern for many.

Professional Recommendations

Dental experts suggest:
- Drinking water alongside coffee
- Using whitening toothpaste
- Regular dental check-ups
- Considering professional cleaning every 6 months

Potential Risks of Immediate Coffee Consumption

Drinking coffee too soon after teeth whitening can:
1. Reverse whitening effects
2. Create uneven coloration
3. Increase tooth sensitivity
4. Reduce treatment longevity

Also, to try selling feet content as encouraged by my domme friends.

I did try sell feet pics and got 2 sales so far. 😂 Contrary to my findom experience, I didn't feel the same thrill I got when I had my first sale. I realized, despite my throne gift count addiction, I am still truly more into power exchanges and domination in general. I speak passionately and act instinctively with the right triggers.

My official findom life was short but adventure filled. I discovered crazy parts of myself that I didn't know existed. I experienced the appreciation and devotion I firmly believed I deserve. I also had the passion in returning the appreciation I got just because I want to. The financial benefit was surprisingly good despite my disinterest in self-advertising (with my photos). My random thought or thought of the day posts were enough. Funnily enough, even my comments racked me with lurking admirers.

My confidence level and idgaf behavior were at its best as I met an amazing finsub on my 1st try. My view about the next ones  and findom was never be the same. Having them quit for their well-being was hard but worth it. It's just that it did affect my motivation as I look forward on the days I had amazing subs. It didn't help I have personal concerns that further dampen my resolve. Fortunately, I stayed in touch with my sub and findom friends that matter. It makes things more bearable.

I am trying to come back and rediscover my passion. In the mean time, I stay part of the community I got so addicted to. Maybe one day, I will find a buyer or a submissive that can re-ignite and claw me out of my slumber. In the meantime, I just exist and carry on. And like always, pour out my thoughts in this space as I see fit.

Sends still thrill me. The idea of taking over lights up my mood. Coffee will forever enslave me. Throne notifications make me giggly. 😂

He has live with me for 8 years. He owns a house but rents it out for extra income. When he worked he made  twice as much as me ... The house we live in is in my name. I pay for all the household (mortgage, utilities, taxes, insurance, upkeep) the house was in need of major repairs which he agreed to help with... 4 months after moving in he was fire from his job and was unemployed for 3 months... then got a part time job... because of this I didn't ask for his help covering the costs renovations and just put them on the back burner... after 3 months he got a full time job ... but had to pay off the debt he incurred while unemployed... again I was understanding of the financial burden being left on my smaller income. after 2 years he quit this job for a lower impact job that made the same amount... again I mention how I am struggling to cover all the costs, and I was met with ""this job has costs and is further from my previous job so I am spending more..."" so I said it could wait until he was better set financially. He was quit this job and was out of work for 4 months and I had to help him cover his expenses ... he found another job , but with a steeper pay cut and again there were purchases needed for this job..(ie Tools and uniforms) he manages to keep this job for only a year when they fired him for nonperformance. I had to sign him up for unemployment because he refused to make an appointment for assistance. That was in  September of 2023. On the advice of a fellow employee he filed for disability (he ad both of his hips replaced from chronic arthritis), his unemployment ran out in April 2024 and I was the sole income for the house. I gave him money to buy cigarettes, coffee and snacks... In December I found out that he had take over $1000.00 of money I had set aside in case of emergency and spent it and later In the month that he had been granted his disability approved. He received over $18,000 in a lump payment. He delayed telling me but I found purchases he had made and he confessed that he had gotten the money. I asked if he planned to pay me back the money he took, and he asked me ""why would pay it back, I spent it on the house?"" I asked how much of the money was spent, and he said that he had gone through about $5000.00. I told him that he needed to repay the money he took from me. Christmas came and went in a tense silence (I got him $400 in auto body tools) he got me a pair of men's boots and a men's shirt 3 sizes to big for me. Overwhelmed by his amazing gifts, I asked how much of the money was left and to my surprise it was all gone. He got several new guns, ham radio equipment, new tires, and ton's of new clothes for him. I lot my shit, I told him he was selfish and thoughtless and that from now on he has to pay to live here. I told him that he has to pay 25% of mortgage and utilities and that I was done being living, breathing wallet for him. He says that is okay but he may struggle making the first couple of payments because he has other obligations he committed to. I told him that paying me has to be the priority or he can find someone else to live with.

Ryan’s days became a rhythm of joyful work and heartfelt interactions. He forged deep connections with the animatronics, each one becoming more human-like as they adapted to their roles. The bond they shared was special, built on mutual respect and understanding.

Candy, the vibrant and enthusiastic leader, had a knack for making everyone feel welcome. “Let’s make today magical!” he would cheer, his spirit infectious. Ryan admired Candy’s ability to light up the room with his presence.

Cindy, who had once been nervous and unsure, blossomed into a confident and caring figure. She had a gentle touch that put everyone at ease. “I’m here for you,” she would say, her voice soothing. Ryan appreciated Cindy’s compassionate nature and her genuine concern for others.

Chester’s playful energy was a constant source of joy. He had a way of turning even the simplest tasks into fun and games. “Let’s have some fun!” he would shout, his laughter echoing through the restaurant. Ryan loved Chester’s ability to bring laughter and lightness to any situation.

Blank, with his quiet wisdom and thoughtful demeanor, became a trusted confidant. He had a way of seeing beyond the surface and understanding the deeper needs of those around him. “Tell me what’s on your mind,” he would say, his voice calm and reassuring. Ryan found solace in Blank’s presence, knowing he could always turn to him for advice.

Old Candy’s nostalgic charm made him a favorite among the guests. His stories of the past brought a sense of continuity and history to the restaurant. “Back in the day, we had some unforgettable moments,” he would reminisce, his eyes twinkling with fond memories. Ryan admired Old Candy’s ability to connect with people through his stories.

The Rat’s mischievous nature added a touch of excitement to the team. He had a way of keeping everyone on their toes, always ready with a playful prank or witty remark. “Let’s keep things interesting,” he would say with a grin. Ryan enjoyed the Rat’s sense of adventure and his ability to bring spontaneity to their routine.

The Cat’s elegance and composure brought a sense of sophistication to the restaurant. She had a graceful presence that made everyone feel special. “We’re here to create magic,” she would say, her voice confident and poised. Ryan admired the Cat’s ability to elevate their performances with her refined demeanor.

The Penguins’ synchronized performances continued to be a highlight. Red, with his Australian charm, Blue, with his French elegance, and Green, with his enthusiastic spirit, created a delightful spectacle. “Let’s show them what we’ve got!” Red would chirp, while Blue added, “Oui, let’s make it magnifique!” and Green cheered, “This is going to be unforgettable!” Ryan marveled at the Penguins’ ability to work together seamlessly, each one bringing their unique flair to the team.

As the weeks went by, Ryan realized that Candy’s Burger and Fries had become more than just a restaurant. It was a place where dreams came true, and memories were cherished. The bond between the animatronics and the guests grew stronger with each passing day, creating a sense of community and belonging.

Ryan often took moments to reflect on the journey they had undertaken. He knew that the success of Candy’s Burger and Fries was not just about the food or the performances—it was about the people. The guests who came to the restaurant were more than customers; they were part of the family. And the animatronics, with their unique personalities and human-like qualities, were the heart and soul of it all.

One evening, as Ryan stood on the stage, looking out at the smiling faces of the guests, he felt a profound sense of gratitude. “Thank you all for being here,” he said, his voice filled with emotion. “Candy’s Burger and Fries is not just a place to eat—it’s a place to create memories, to laugh, and to share moments of joy. We’re so grateful to have you all as part of our family.”

Chapter 8: The Accident

A few weeks had passed since the grand reopening of Candy’s Burger and Fries, and business was booming. The restaurant was filled with laughter, excitement, and the delicious aroma of food. The hard work and dedication of Ryan, Jessica, and the animatronics had truly paid off.

One night, after the last guest had left and the lights had dimmed, Ryan stayed behind to close up the restaurant. He walked through the quiet space, reflecting on the day's events and enjoying a moment of solitude.

Suddenly, he smelled smoke and saw faint wisps rising from the kitchen. Panic surged through him as he realized that there was a fire. He rushed to the back of the restaurant to find flames licking at the walls and smoke quickly filling the room.

“We need to get out of here!” Ryan shouted, rushing to wake the animatronics.

Candy's eyes flickered open, instantly sensing the danger. “Fire! We need to act fast!”

Ryan quickly roused Cindy, Chester, Blank, Old Candy, the Rat, the Cat, and the Penguins—Red, Blue, and Green.

“Everyone, we need to grab what we can and get out of here!” Ryan instructed, his voice urgent.

Candy sprang into action. “Follow me, everyone! Let’s make sure we’re all safe!”

Cindy, though nervous, managed to stay focused. “What should we take first, Ryan?”

“Grab the essential supplies and anything valuable,” Ryan replied, quickly gathering important documents and equipment.

Chester's energetic spirit turned serious as he helped gather supplies. “We’ve got this, Ryan. We won’t let anything get left behind.”

Blank, being the strongest, moved with purpose, grabbing the heaviest items and carrying them out with ease. “We’ll make sure to get everything important.”

Old Candy, with his nostalgic charm, added, “Let’s move quickly and stay safe.”

The Rat, with a determined look, said, “We’ll get through this together.”

The Cat, always composed, nodded. “Let’s be careful and thorough.”

The Penguins sprang into action with their unique accents:

Red: “Let’s grab everything we need, mate!”

Blue: “Vite! Quickly, we need to move!”

Green: “Let’s get everything important!”

As the animatronics and Ryan moved swiftly through the restaurant, the smoke thickened and the flames spread. Ryan stayed behind as long as he could, trying to hold back the fire with a fire extinguisher. Sweat poured down his face as he battled the flames, buying precious time for the animatronics to save the most important items.

Candy and Chester led the way, helping Ryan carry the heaviest items. Cindy and Blank made sure no important documents were left behind. Old Candy, the Rat, and the Cat double-checked the area, ensuring nothing was overlooked. The Penguins, with their nimble movements, assisted wherever they were needed.

Finally, the flames grew too intense, and Ryan had to retreat. As they made their way outside, the sound of sirens filled the air. Firefighters arrived quickly, and Ryan directed them to the source of the fire. Thanks to their quick response, the flames were soon under control.

Once the fire was extinguished, Ryan and the animatronics took a moment to catch their breath. The restaurant had suffered some damage, but they had managed to save the most important items.

Overwhelmed by the situation, Ryan fell to his knees, feeling guilt and sorrow wash over him. “If I had been paying attention, this would have never happened,” he whispered, his voice breaking.

The animatronics noticed his distress and gathered around him.

Candy’s eyes filled with concern. “Ryan, are you okay?”

Cindy, her voice soft and comforting, added, “You’ve been so strong through all of this.”

Chester’s grin had faded, replaced with a look of worry. “We’re here for you, Ryan.”

Blank’s voice was steady and reassuring. “We’ll get through this together.”

Old Candy placed a hand on Ryan’s shoulder. “You’ve done an amazing job keeping us safe.”

The Rat, with a determined look, added, “We’re not just a team—we’re family.”

The Cat nodded. “You’re not alone, Ryan.”

The Penguins chimed in with their unique accents:

Red: “We’ve got your back, mate!”

Blue: “Together, we can handle anything!”

Green: “We’ll rebuild and make it even better!”

Ryan took a deep breath, trying to steady his emotions. “You all are going to have to stay at the factory until I figure something out. It’s the safest place for now.”

Candy’s eyes filled with determination. “Don’t worry, Ryan. We’ll be ready to help when you need us.”

Cindy, her voice gentle and supportive, added, “We understand, Ryan. We’ll be here, waiting.”

Chester’s usual grin returned, this time filled with reassurance. “We’ll make the best of it, Ryan. You’ve got this.”

Blank, ever the strong and steady presence, nodded. “We’ll stay ready and prepared.”

Old Candy placed a hand on Ryan’s shoulder. “Take your time to sort things out. We’re in this together.”

The Rat, with a determined look, added, “We’ll be patient. You’re not alone in this.”

The Cat nodded in agreement. “We’ll be here, Ryan. Take care of what needs to be done.”

The Penguins chimed in with their unique accents:

Red: “We’ll stick together, mate!”

Blue: “We’ll support you, Ryan.”

Green: “We’ll be waiting, ready to help.”

Ryan felt a surge of gratitude as he looked at his newfound family. “Thank you, everyone. I’ll make sure everything gets sorted out. I promise.”

As the animatronics disappeared into the distance, heading towards the factory, Ryan watched them go, his heart heavy with the weight of the night’s events. He knew that rebuilding would take time, effort, and resources, but he was determined to restore Candy’s Burger and Fries to its former glory.

As the weeks went by, Ryan worked tirelessly to assess the damage and plan the repairs. He coordinated with contractors, ordered new equipment, and started the rebuilding process. The animatronics remained at the factory, ready to assist whenever needed.

Ryan visited them often, updating them on the progress and sharing his plans. Each visit reinforced the bond they shared and reminded him of the unwavering support he had.

Candy’s eyes would light up with enthusiasm. “We’re with you every step of the way, Ryan!”

Cindy’s gentle smile reassured him. “We believe in you, Ryan. You’re doing an amazing job.”

Chester’s playful spirit lifted his spirits. “We’ll be back in action before you know it!”

Blank’s steady presence provided comfort. “Take it one step at a time, Ryan. We’ll get there.”

Old Candy’s nostalgic wisdom offered perspective. “We’ve come this far together. We’ll see it through to the end.”

The Rat’s determination inspired him. “We’ll rebuild and make it even better, Ryan.”

The Cat’s composure kept him focused. “We’ll overcome this challenge, Ryan. We’re in this together.”

The Penguins’ unique accents added a touch of optimism:

Red: “We’ll rise stronger than ever, mate!”

Blue: “We’ll create something magnifique, Ryan!”

Green: “We’ll make every moment unforgettable!”

In the weeks following the fire, Ryan faced numerous challenges. The restaurant was in ruins, and the damage was extensive. As Ryan reviewed the estimates for rebuilding, he discovered that he needed $500,000 to restore Candy’s Burger and Fries to its former glory. Unfortunately, he only had $400,000 available, leaving him $100,000 short.

Determined to raise the additional funds, Ryan came up with a plan. He decided to rent out the animatronics for private events, birthday parties, and special performances. This way, he could generate the extra income needed to complete the rebuilding process.

Candy, Cindy, Chester, Blank, Old Candy, the Rat, the Cat, and the Penguins were all supportive of Ryan’s plan. They understood the importance of raising the necessary funds and were eager to help in any way they could.

Candy, always the leader, said, “We’re in this together, Ryan. We’ll do whatever it takes to get the restaurant back on its feet.”

Cindy added, “We’ll make these events special for everyone. We’ll bring joy and excitement to all who attend.”

Chester, with his boundless energy, exclaimed, “Let’s get out there and show the world what we can do!”

Ryan organized the events, and soon the animatronics were performing at various venues, delighting audiences with their unique talents. The income from these performances slowly but steadily added up, bringing Ryan closer to his financial goal.

During this time, Ryan also envisioned a grander plan for the rebuilt restaurant. He dreamed of creating a larger, more spectacular venue where each animatronic would have its own stage. He imagined Cindy and Candy performing on the main stage, the Cat and the Rat on a side stage, Blank and Old Candy on their own separate stages, and even a new stage for two additional animatronics—a cat named Scribble and a daycare attendant named Emerald

As Ryan shared his vision with the animatronics, they were filled with excitement and determination.

Candy’s eyes sparkled. “A grand stage for everyone? That sounds amazing, Ryan!”

Cindy smiled warmly. “We’ll create an unforgettable experience for everyone who visits.”

Chester’s enthusiasm was infectious. “I can’t wait to see it all come together!”

Blank’s steady presence provided reassurance. “We’re ready for this new chapter, Ryan.”

Old Candy’s nostalgic charm brought a sense of continuity. “We’ll honor the past while building a bright future.”

The Rat’s determination was unwavering. “We’re stronger than ever, Ryan.”

The Cat’s composure was unshakeable. “We’re ready to shine, Ryan.”

The Penguins chimed in with their unique accents:

Red: “Let’s make it unforgettable, mate!”

Blue: “Let’s create something magnifique, Ryan!”

Green: “Let’s bring joy to everyone who walks through those doors!”

As the grand reopening continued, Ryan felt a surge of pride and gratitude. Candy’s Burger and Fries was more than just a restaurant; it was a place where dreams came true and memories were cherished.

With his animatronic family by his side, Ryan knew that they could overcome any challenge and create something truly magical. Together, they would continue to bring joy, laughter, and unforgettable moments to everyone who walked through their doors.

Chapter 9 the grand reopening

A few weeks after the grand reopening, Ryan decided to take a well-deserved day off. The restaurant was running smoothly, thanks to the hard work and dedication of his animatronic family. Ryan felt a sense of pride as he watched the guests enjoy their time at Candy’s Burger and Fries.

On his day off, Ryan decided to visit the restaurant to check on things. As he walked through the bustling space, he was greeted by the cheerful sounds of laughter and the delicious aroma of food. It was heartwarming to see the community enjoying the place he had worked so hard to rebuild.

Curious to see how the new daycare area was doing, Ryan made his way to the colorful and inviting space. As he entered, he found Cindy, Scribble, and Emerald sitting together, surrounded by the playful décor and toys of the daycare.

Cindy looked up and smiled warmly at Ryan. “Hey, Ryan! Taking a day off, huh?”

Scribble, the new cat animatronic, added with a cheerful tone, “It’s good to see you, Ryan! We’ve been keeping an eye on things here.”

Emerald, the daycare attendant, chimed in with her soft and soothing voice, “The children have been having a wonderful time, and we’ve made sure everything is running smoothly.”

Ryan couldn’t help but smile at the sight of his animatronic friends bonding and taking care of the daycare. “I’m glad to see you all here. How’s everything going?”

Cindy responded, “Everything’s been great! The kids love playing here, and we’ve been having a lot of fun with them.”

Scribble nodded enthusiastically. “We’ve been telling stories, playing games, and making sure everyone feels welcome and happy.”

Emerald added, “It’s been a joy to see the children’s faces light up. We’re doing our best to create a safe and fun environment for them.”

Ryan felt a surge of gratitude as he looked at Cindy, Scribble, and Emerald. “Thank you all for your hard work and dedication. I couldn’t have done this without you.”

Cindy’s eyes sparkled with warmth. “We’re all in this together, Ryan. This place means as much to us as it does to you.”

Scribble grinned. “And we’re always here to help, no matter what.”

Emerald’s gentle smile reassured him. “We’ll continue to make this place a welcoming haven for everyone.”

As Ryan spent a few more moments with his animatronic friends, he felt a deep sense of fulfillment. Candy’s Burger and Fries had truly become a place where dreams came true, and with the unwavering support of his animatronic family, he knew that they could overcome any challenge and continue to bring joy to all who visited.

Chapter 10: Sundays in the Playroom

Every Sunday, Candy’s Burger and Fries took on a different kind of magic. The “Closed for Maintenance” sign was up, but the restaurant wasn’t truly empty. Ryan had made a habit of stopping by, finding solace in the quiet atmosphere, but little did he know, the animatronics had their own way of spending this day.

A Surprise Visit

One Sunday afternoon, Ryan arrived at the restaurant with a cup of coffee in hand. The sun was shining, and the air was crisp. As he walked through the front door, he noticed something peculiar—soft laughter and playful noises coming from the daycare area.

Curious, Ryan made his way toward the sound. As he peeked into the room, he couldn’t help but smile. There they were: Candy, Chester, Cindy, Emerald, Blank, and Scribble, all hanging out together in the daycare. The usually lively animatronics were engaged in different activities, each one enjoying the relaxed atmosphere in their own way.

Games and Giggles

Candy, with his blue fur and red tie, was leading a game of hide-and-seek, his vibrant appearance a perfect match for the colorful playroom. Chester was organizing a mini-tournament of racing arcade games, his competitive spirit bringing out laughs from everyone. Cindy, the purple-furred animatronic, and Emerald were busy crafting, their nimble fingers creating intricate paper decorations.

Blank, always the quiet observer, was sitting in a corner, sketching new ideas for the restaurant. Scribble, true to her name, was bouncing around, helping with every activity and spreading her infectious energy.

Ryan watched from the doorway, feeling a warm sense of contentment. These moments of joy and camaraderie were exactly why he had wanted to give everyone Sundays off. It wasn’t just about resting; it was about creating a space where they could truly be themselves.

Joining the Fun

As he stepped into the room, the animatronics looked up and greeted him with cheerful smiles. “Hey Ryan!” Candy called out, waving him over. “Come join us! We’re just about to start a new round.”

Ryan chuckled and set his coffee down. “Alright, but don’t expect me to go easy on you,” he teased, joining the group.

The afternoon passed in a blur of laughter and games. They played hide-and-seek, built towers with colorful blocks, and even had a friendly dance-off. For a few hours, Ryan felt like a kid again, free from the stresses and responsibilities of running a business.

A Special Tradition

As the sun began to set, the group gathered in the main party room. They sat in a circle, sharing stories and dreams. It had become a tradition for them to end their Sundays like this, a time to reflect and connect.

Ryan leaned back, listening to Candy recount a funny memory from the past week. He felt grateful for these moments, for the bonds they had formed. “You know,” he said, looking around at his friends, “these Sundays have become something really special. I’m glad we decided to do this.”

Candy nodded, his eyes warm with understanding. “It’s our time to be ourselves, to enjoy each other’s company. It’s what makes Candy’s more than just a restaurant.”

As the evening drew to a close, Ryan felt a deep sense of peace. Sundays at Candy’s had become more than just a day off; they were a reminder of the importance of friendship, laughter, and finding joy in the little things.

Chapter 11: Expanding the Team

Sundays had become a special day at Candy’s Burger and Fries. Ryan loved these quiet moments and the surprises they brought. On one such Sunday, he walked into the daycare, drawn by the sounds of laughter and play.

A New Idea

Ryan found the animatronics gathered around a Monopoly game. He couldn't help but smile at Chester's intense focus and Candy's playful teasing. Then he noticed the Penguins—three hardworking servers.

“Hey, you guys are amazing,” Ryan said, walking over to them. “But I’ve been thinking... you were designed for a smaller location, and you’ve been working extra hard here. How would you feel about designing three more Penguins to share the workload?”

The Penguins looked at each other excitedly. Red, with his Australian accent, said, “Mate, we do our best, but it’s a lot for the three of us.”

Blue, with his French accent, added, “Oui, oui! We do our best, but we could use a little help to maintain our elegance and charm.”

Getting Help

Ryan knew he couldn’t do it alone, so he called Jessica, his old friend who had helped him build the animatronics when Candy’s first opened. Jessica was an amazing engineer.

When Jessica arrived, the animatronics greeted her warmly. “Hey Jessica!” Candy called out. “Ready to work your magic again?”

“Absolutely,” Jessica replied with a smile. “Let’s get started!”

Designing the New Penguins

Over the next few Sundays, Ryan, Jessica, and the Penguins met in the daycare to design the new additions. They had a lot of fun and some lively debates.

“I think we should have one who’s great at organizing,” Red suggested.

Blue nodded. “And perhaps one with a flair for entertainment, like me.”

Green, the third Penguin, added, “We need someone who can help with the culinary aspects. Maybe they can specialize in desserts!”

After discussing names, personalities, and special skills, they settled on three new Penguins: Purple, Orange, and Gray.

Building the Team

With the designs ready, Ryan and Jessica spent hours in the workshop building the new Penguins. Purple was organized, Orange loved entertaining, and Gray was a culinary expert.

When the new Penguins were finally ready, Ryan was excited to introduce them to the rest of the team.

A Warm Welcome

On the first Sunday after the new Penguins were built, Ryan invited everyone to the main party room for a special welcome celebration. The animatronics and the original Penguins gathered around, eager to meet their new teammates.

“Everyone, I’d like you to meet Purple, Orange, and Gray,” Ryan announced.

Purple spoke first with a refined British accent. “It's a pleasure to meet all of you. I look forward to helping keep things in order.”

Orange, with an American Southern accent, said, “Howdy, y’all! I’m here to make sure we have a blast and keep those smiles coming!”

Gray, with a laid-back Californian accent, added, “Hey dudes, I’m all about the sweet treats. Can’t wait to share some awesome desserts with everyone.”

Building Memories Together

As the weeks went by, the new Penguins quickly integrated into the daily operations of the restaurant. The increased efficiency allowed the animatronics to spend more time with guests, which brought even more joy to Candy’s.

Sundays continued to be a special time for the group. Ryan often found them in the daycare or the main party room, enjoying each other’s company. The new Penguins fit in perfectly, adding their own unique flair to the mix.

One Sunday, as Ryan watched the animatronics and Penguins play a game of charades, he felt a deep sense of gratitude. Expanding the team had improved the restaurant’s operations and strengthened the bonds of friendship.

Looking Forward

With the new Penguins on board, Candy’s Burger and Fries was thriving like never before. The themed nights were a hit, the guests were delighted, and the team was closer than ever. Ryan knew they would face any challenges together, united by their shared purpose and the special traditions they had built.

As he left the restaurant that evening, Ryan couldn’t help but smile. Candy’s was more than a place of work; it was a family. And Sundays had become a testament to the power of friendship, creativity, and the joy of working together.

Chapter 12: New Beginnings

With the new Penguins—Purple, Orange, and Gray—settled in, the restaurant's atmosphere felt more vibrant than ever. The team was thriving, and the guests could feel the positive energy.

Embracing New Ideas

One Sunday, as the group gathered for their usual coffee and conversation, Cindy brought up a new idea. “I’ve been thinking more about themed nights. Why not give our customers something new and exciting to look forward to?”

Ryan nodded. “I like it. What kind of themes do you have in mind?”

Cindy’s eyes sparkled. “We could have a Retro Night, play classic hits, and dress in vintage outfits. Or maybe an International Cuisine Night with dishes from around the world.”

Scribble added, “And I could paint murals to match the themes! Imagine a 50s diner scene or an Italian piazza right here in Candy’s!”

The group’s excitement was contagious, and Ryan could already see the changes transforming the space.

Planning the First Event

Over the next few weeks, the team worked together to prepare for the first themed night. They chose Retro Night, transforming the restaurant with checkered floors and neon lights. The team donned their best vintage attire, and the jukebox played classic hits.

As the evening progressed, Ryan couldn’t help but smile at the sight of families dancing and friends laughing. The success of Retro Night set the stage for many more themed events to come.

Finding Balance

Despite the excitement and growth, Ryan made sure to maintain the balance they had found. Sundays remained sacred, a time for rest and rejuvenation. The team used these quiet days to reflect, share ideas, and support one another.

One Sunday, as they sat around their favorite booth, Ryan looked around at his friends. “You know, I’ve been thinking about how much we’ve accomplished together. It’s not just about the restaurant. It’s about the memories we’re creating and the lives we’re touching.”

Candy nodded, her eyes warm with understanding. “You’re right, Ryan. Candy’s has become more than just a place to eat. It’s a community, a family.”

As the sun set on another peaceful Sunday, the team knew they were ready to face whatever the future held.

Chapter 13: Growing Together

Candy’s Burger and Fries continued to thrive, thanks to the creativity and dedication of Ryan and his team. The themed nights were a hit, and the guests loved the new Penguins.

A New Challenge

One day, Ryan noticed that the popularity of the themed nights was starting to put a strain on the team. The increased demand meant longer hours and more responsibilities.

Ryan called a meeting to discuss the situation. “I’ve noticed we’ve been working extra hard lately. I think it’s time we find a way to manage the workload better.”

Emerald suggested, “What if we rotate shifts? That way, everyone gets a break while still keeping things running smoothly.”

Chester agreed. “And maybe we can hire some part-time staff to help during the busiest nights.”

Implementing Changes

The team embraced the new plan. They hired part-time staff and created a rotating schedule to ensure everyone had time to rest. The changes made a significant difference, and the team felt more balanced and energized.

Sundays remained a special time for reflection and connection. Ryan often found the animatronics and Penguins in the daycare or the main party room, enjoying each other’s company.

A Sense of Gratitude

One Sunday, as the team gathered for their usual coffee, Ryan looked around at his friends. “I just want to say how grateful I am for all of you. Your hard work and dedication mean the world to me.”

Candy smiled. “We’re grateful for you too, Ryan. You’ve built something amazing here, and we’re proud to be a part of it.”

The group spent the rest of the day sharing stories and laughter, feeling a deep sense of camaraderie and gratitude.

Chapter 14: Building Dreams

As the months went by, Candy’s Burger and Fries continued to grow and evolve. The themed nights became more popular, and the restaurant was always bustling with activity.

A New Project

One Sunday, Ryan brought up a new idea. “I’ve been thinking about expanding the restaurant. Maybe we could add an outdoor seating area or a small stage for live performances.”

The team’s eyes lit up with excitement. Scribble exclaimed, “I could help design the outdoor area! It would be amazing!”

Jessica added, “And I can help with the technical aspects. We could make it something truly special.”

Planning the Expansion

Over the next few weeks, the team worked together to plan the expansion. They brainstormed ideas, created designs, and discussed the logistics. The project brought a new sense of excitement and purpose to the group.

As they worked on the expansion, they continued to maintain the balance they had found. Sundays remained a time for rest and reflection, and the team cherished these moments together.

A Bright Future

One Sunday, as the group gathered in the daycare, Ryan shared his thoughts. “I’m excited about this expansion, but what I’m most grateful for is the journey we’ve been on together. Candy’s isn’t just a restaurant; it’s a place where we’ve built dreams and created memories.”

Candy nodded. “You’re right, Ryan. And with this new project, we’re only going to make it even better.”

The team spent the rest of the day dreaming about the future and building memories together.

Chapter 15: A New Beginning

The expansion of Candy’s Burger and Fries was completed, and the new outdoor seating area and stage were ready for their first event.

A Grand Opening

Ryan and the team planned a special grand opening event to celebrate the expansion. They invited the community, and the turnout was incredible. The new outdoor area was a hit, and the live performances brought even more joy to the guests.

As the evening progressed, Ryan couldn’t help but feel a deep sense of pride and accomplishment. The journey had been challenging, but it was worth it.

Reflecting on the Journey

One Sunday, as the team gathered in the daycare, Ryan took a moment to reflect on the journey. “We’ve come so far, and I couldn’t have done it without all of you. Candy’s is more than just a restaurant; it’s a place where we’ve built dreams, created memories, and found a family.”

Candy smiled. “We’re grateful for you too, Ryan. You’ve built something amazing, and we’re proud to be a part of it.”

The group spent the rest of the day enjoying each other’s company, sharing stories and laughter, and looking forward to the future.

Looking Ahead

With the expansion complete, Candy’s Burger and Fries was thriving like never before. The team was closer than ever, and they knew they could face any challenge together.

As Ryan left the restaurant that evening, he felt a deep sense of gratitude and excitement for what the future held. Candy’s was more than just a place of work; it was a family, and Sundays had become a testament to the power of friendship, creativity, and the joy of working together.",1,1738107436.0,FiveNightsAtFredbears,0,1.0,False

1icfrs6,https://www.reddit.com/r/SmoshRedditStories/comments/1icfrs6/something_my_ex_husband_gave_me_that_i_still_have/,Something my ex husband gave me that I still have and I now want to file charges.,"This is a long one so buckle up. I’ll start with the background information first. In 2021 I was diagnosed with breast cancer. If this diagnosis wasn’t bad enough, my now ex husband began a toxic pitty party for himself and decided that making my life harder emotionally and physically was exactly what I needed during the worst time of my life. He offered no help, he did not ask he how I was. He acted annoyed if I asked him for help and said ‘why does it always have to be me? There are other people in this house that can help you!’ He would fix a coffee and not ask if I wanted one. And when I wasn’t even supposed to be lifting a kettle full of water because of the surgery, I would just think fuck it I’ll make my own. One morning I went to the kettle and flipped the switch and when I tried to lift the kettle it was full to the brim with water. I couldn’t lift it. My surgery was on my right side. So, I shouted to him in the conservatory where he hid everyday on his laptop and asked if he would come help because he was the one who’d filled the kettle all the way up. His response, ‘I filled the kettle up because I might want another coffee.’ He never ever in 20 years of marriage EVER filled the kettle full but suddenly started doing it when I wasn’t supposed to be lifting things. I reminded him that I wasn’t supposed to be lifting things and the kettle was now too heavy. His response, ‘use you other hand. You didn’t have surgery on both sides.’ And he refused to come help. I was being ‘pathetic’ and trying to gain sympathy. All this was shocking especially when I was physically and mentally at my lowest. I could go on about all the toxic things he did but you get the picture. You might ask if he was always like this? He could be an asshole but it was never like this. This was asshole in hyperdrive. I poured my heart out in my cancer group on social media as I couldn’t believe that he was going out of his way to be horrible to me while I was trying to act like nothing was wrong in front of the kids. A lot of women were having the same kind of issues and then one nurse said that woman are 6 times more likely to be have their partners leave when diagnosed with cancer. My ex didn’t leave but He would play loud music when I’d go upstairs to rest as the treatment knocked me off my feet and when I’d get up and go in to ask him to turn it down he’d start having a tantrum like a petulant teenager, ‘I can’t even play my music without you complaining. It’s not all about you around here!’
And he was not Covid testing when my immune system was at its lowest. He would have his adult children come to the house with their sick children and I asked him to meet them somewhere else as my immune system could not handle a bout with Covid too. He started gaslighting me about Covid and how this and that and I’m a Germaphobe etc… etc… 

So, I called my sister and my parents who live in another country and I told them everything. They asked how long this had been going on and I said I was always able to keep a lid on his intermittent asshole behaviour and drinking before but he’s gone completely off the rails and I can’t take it anymore. He was not helping or comforting or being the rock that so many other people have said their partners were during cancer. I felt alone and abused that I might as well do it all by myself because it would be easier. So my parents rented me a house and I moved out with my 
daughter who has special needs. 

The one of the last things I said to him was that I crossed an ocean for him and he wouldn’t even step over a puddle for me. He got all defensive and said, ‘what do you mean? I drove you to the hospital didn’t I?’ My response, ‘ I gave him a standing ovation. Clapping I said, ‘well done. The bare minimum. Well done you.’. I got accused of treating him like a child and I said, ‘I wouldn’t have to act so parental if you didn’t act so juvenile.’ 

So there’s the back story. It was the best thing I ever did walking out that house but 2 months after I left, one of my ex neighbours told me that he   Had a really large women staying there every weekend. Yes he was cheating the whole time. And yes I took him to court and rinsed him financially of which I felt I was owed that for the cheating the lying and the toxic things he did to me while I was fighting cancer. Plus the mental breakdown I had a few months after I left. Fight or flight had had enough. I’m doing much better now. 

Anyway to my question. In 2002 weeks were on a family holiday and the older kids had taken the younger kids to a play park. My ex and I were in the holiday rental alone. He had the idea to do the dirty in the 30 minutes they’d be gone I said no for obvious reasons. He would take no for an answer. Finally I was coerced into it. I wasn’t happy about if and was doing it under duress.  3 days later I start having a temperature, chills etc… I was pretty ill on the way home. A few days later I feel like I’m getting a yeast infection but it was so much more than that. I continued to get worse and I had no idea what was wrong with me. When I couldn’t urinate at all, I told him and he said I was just being dramatic. I asked him to not go to work as I was really ill. He refused and walked out the door. I called the doctors office sobbing and told them I was feeling like I was going to pass out. They said come in now. I called the ex and said they needed to see me now. He turned around and came back and took me to the doctors who diagnosed me with ‘the worst case of herpes they’d ever seen’ and my bladder was about to burst. I was rushed to the hospital and stayed there for 10 days. Shocked, horrified, my life suddenly altered and would never be the same. The doctor took all the details and looked at my ex and said ‘how long have you had those?’ Pointing to his cold sores. He got defensive and says I didn’t get it from him. The doctor said that I did and the timing was exactly what he’d expect from a new infection. So I sit there and listen to him defend himself while I cry my eyes out. For me if was life changing and for him it was just a Thursday. Sooo I have 2 to 3 outbreaks a year for 2 decades. He never told me he had herpes. He infected me and then shamed me every time I had an outbreak claiming I must have gotten it from someone else. I know. I should have left him right then… but when your in a trauma bond with a  covert narcissist… 

 During my cancer treatment I had an outbreak the whole time because my immune system wasn’t able to keep it in check. And every time I have one I hate him even more. I spoke to a solicitor (lawyer) about taking him to court again for this because I will never get rid of it. I will always be fighting it. I’ve given up ever having another relationship because I don’t want to hurt anyone with this and the solicitor said that we could go for a civil suit and not a criminal one as in the civil suit you don’t have to prove intent, you just have to prove it happened. The civil suit will be compensation but he doesn’t have much to give but I still so badly want to do this. 

Reddit, tell me if I’m doing the right thing or should I just let it go and live my life. I’m so torn and still so angry that this thing he gave me I will never get rid of. I hate him for it. ",1,1738107163.0,SmoshRedditStories,0,1.0,False

At least on the surface that’s how it appears. In reality I really started reconsidering my friendships because of something I heard: if you were to not call them would the friendship end there? I got pretty sick so I didn’t reach out for a while and when I told my best friend she had no reaction. We met up a few times after but the vibe was already off or tense. 

Years later we meet up after being at a family friends wedding/ we saw one another in church. She was nice and talked to me like nothing happened. We met up to get coffee and then said let’s do it again. We did not. Months after she follows my social media. The timeline of this  reconnection is December 2023-now. 

Her birthday was In December so I said let’s celebrate happy bday and all. She then said yes, i noticed she deleted and made brand new accounts. I just gathered if i said something she’d likely go, but not make plans herself. Also tried to talk about our falling out and she said she didn’t realize what even happened. We hung out practically daily too back then but I realized I shouldn’t touch the past.


Now current times, we seem to have a mutual friend. This mutual friend hung out with my former friend alone, and I hung out with this mutual friend myself too but back in 2022. She occasionally suggests plans but we live fairly far. Recently she did mention if I hang out with (best friend) and when we hung out back then she also mentioned her. She seemed to imply we should all do something- anytime she asks me. Do I go with this plan? Try to reinistste the friendship alone first? Thank you  ",0,1738107145.0,AskWomenNoCensor,1,0.5,False

I’ve noticed that a lot of them don’t really understand how to conduct user research. They’re *curious*, but maybe don’t have the experience so here are some tips I share with them as a product designer:

1. **Just watch 'em:** See how users act in their natural habitat, where they'd actually use your product. You'll learn how they really behave and spot their pain points.
2. **Diary time:** Ask users to jot down their thoughts and feelings while using your product for a bit. You'll get a feel for their habits and emotions over time.
3. **Let them help design:** Invite users to join you in designing the product. They'll feel more invested, and you'll get a better idea of what they want.
4. **Job-to-be-done chats:** Focus on what your users are trying to do with your product. Talk to them about why they want to do these things and what outcomes they're after.
5. **Test on the fly:** Run quick, informal user tests in public spots like coffee shops or parks. You'll get fast feedback from all sorts of people.
6. **Prototype face-off:** Make a few different prototypes and see which one users like best. This way, you can quickly figure out what works and what doesn't.
7. **Lights, camera, action:** Get users to film themselves using your product and talking about their experience. You'll get an up-close look at their thoughts and feelings.
8. **Make research fun:** Turn user research into games or challenges. Users will have a blast and be more willing to share their thoughts.
9. **Social media stalking (kinda):** Keep an eye on social media for chats about your product or industry. You'll catch trends and pain points you might've missed otherwise.
10. **Team up with influencers:** Work with well-known folks in your industry to get feedback and reach their followers for user research. It's a win-win situation.
11. **Slack invite:** There is nothing scarier than having your customer have access to your time whenever they want. Equally, there is nothing more rewarding than having your customer have access to you whenever they want :) Embrace the scary…odds are, it’s good for you AND your company.

Is there anything you think should be added to this list? Always love to hear how other founders stay close to their customers!

This week my mom was not around to help, she's quarantining after coming in contact with someone who was sick. My husband works until late 2 days per week and did not want me to be alone since I am up most nights holding our baby while she sleeps (the only way she sleeps unfortunately) so he asked MIL to come stay with us for these 2 days.

There haven't been any previous major issues with her, I've been critical of some of her actions but overall she's lovely and supportive, I love her and I know she means well but I'm feeling overwhelmed and frustrated over a few things:

- She's overbearing, I appreciate her support, but as soon as she stepped into our house she took the baby, and it's like she resist giving her to me even when she wants to feed. I EBF on demand and she throws comments at LO ""you just ate you can't keep breastfeeding"" which irks me...
- She's referred to herself as mom 4 times when talking to LO, yes I counted because each one stabbed me a little differently.
- It feels like she's not here to support me but only to get her dose of LO, to experience what it's like to have a baby girl... for example she leaves the dishes and cups she used for me to clean, even though the dishwasher is right there! 
- My LO hates the pacifier and basically uses me as human pacifier to sleep, which I absolutely do not have any problem with, and I explained that but all day today she was basically shoving the pacifier down my daughter's throat when she visibly did not want it. She thought it was funny-cute how she was rejecting it until the baby starting crying. She kept telling me how I should keep trying to force the pacifier on her, like what??
- She dozed off holding the baby while on the couch, I was cooking us lunch and turned around and saw her, I quickly took the baby and told her to take a nap if she's tired, thankfully she quickly obliged. 
- She wanted to drink her coffee, I told her to give me the baby while she finished, she said no and basically held baby in one arm and coffee in the other hand while walking around because baby was fussy, what the fuck! Holding a hot beverage, a baby and walking around just to not give her to me, her mother? WHY?
- Every time I wanted to do something to LO she would be jumping in with ""I'll do that"", ""I'll help with that"" and simlly takes over. 

The problem is I'm a people pleaser and very non confrontational, especially with her, and I know she's trying her best to be helpful but I just cannot with this. I barely got to hold my daughter today and something about it is just rubbing me the wrong way. 

Am I overreacting?

I go my way, to a different country to study, still not picking it up. I meet her first time I come back in a group with friends so we just chat and catch up. Only after that does a close friend of mine ask about her and ends up learning of what happened at work tells me that I am retarded and she was hitting on me. That was the first time I considered her as a potential partner. 

My next visit home was around Christmas and I got to see her twice, both times alone and quite the eventful. I learned a lot about her, it was all great and she stated she enjoyed it a lot, but we keep it friendly, mostly. Based on the way she writes I end up to the conclusion that she is either super passive or not interested.

I saw her again next time I came back, which was a few days ago. I was consider just bringing it up as so far based on a decent amount of one on one time spent together I figured she might be into me, and at that point I know I like her. Before meeting up I saw her try to help an old man. She didn't know I was watching, as it was never meant for both of us to go through the same street, since I don't know the city. I met her where we decided to meet and she later mentioned it, as to why she was a few minutes late.

I learn from someone from her class she asks about me because that someone is a cousin of mine. Everything goes great I give some hints and she is enjoying herself. We had a few ""moments"" even. I pay the bill at a dinner and she says she is embarrassed to accept it and so on. I end up paying anyway and she pays for the taxi home as she insisted and I respected that. She insists we see each other tomorrow morning for a coffee.

I decided to not say anything and do it tomorrow. We meet the next morning, mind you she has an exam the day after, and she is super behind (a person that usually studies a lot and is smart, studies law at thr best uni in my country), yet she chooses to be with me. At the end I can feel how stressed she is because of that exam so I decide to not be selfish and kept it for me. That day she told me a lot of super personal stuff and got vulnerable with me. 

At that point I decide I will come back to her city from the one I am staying in in a few days after said exam has passed and she is relaxed. 

Said exam was today so I message her to see how her exam went, and later ask about her schedule so I can see her tomorrow. She says she may be out of town and needa to check on some people. 20 minutes later, she says it is fine as she is staying, because her best friend (girl) was coming on Saturday (which she mentioned when we were out) and that... 
her boyfriend has decided to come visit. No specified day or anything, unlike her friend.

I am in shock. For 6 months, nothing did ever hint towards her being in a relationship. Not her socials, not our talks, not her behavior. There was never super obvious flirting but we are both shy and reserved, so we ""flirted"" in subtle ways. She teased numerous times and all. Everything was a green flag. We had convos at some point that came close to the question of her having a bf and she never said anything. 

I am certain she is not doing this to hurt me, she is simply not the person to do that, and from everything else it seemed like she definitely liked me. I tool a few friend's opinions before as I was always reserved and hesitant, but all of them told me I was delusional and should simply tell her as she was certainly into me. 

I ended up still arranging for a meeting tomorrow, when I will ask since when she has a bd and such. I plan to keep my feelings to myself. 

There it goes, half an year of hopes wasted into a relationship that never was. It took so long for me to convince myself she liked me, and just when I did, she dropped the bomb. 

I am speechless know and feel numb.

1icfhwm,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1icfhwm/why_doesnt_starbucks_use_roasted_dates_on_whole/,Why Doesn’t Starbucks Use Roasted Dates on Whole Bean Coffee?,"Hey everyone, I’ve been wondering why Starbucks doesn’t include the roasted date on our whole bean coffee. My guess is that it might be because the time it takes for coffee to be roasted, shipped to stores, and sold might surprise people. Plus, since we sell in supermarkets, seeing a roast date from six months or even a year ago might discourage customers from buying it, which is why we stick to a best-by date instead.

But as someone who enjoys high-quality coffee, I know freshness makes a big difference. Just like with craft beer, there’s a peak time to enjoy freshly roasted coffee. A best-by date doesn’t tell you how fresh the coffee is, which can feel a bit misleading.

So, I have a couple of questions:

1. Does anyone know why we don’t include a roasted date? Is it something Starbucks has looked into before?


2. How long is the best-by date typically from the actual roast date?

1icfgv0,https://www.reddit.com/r/2nordic4you/comments/1icfgv0/i_asked_chatgpt_how_a_kalmar_20_could_look_in/,"I asked ChatGPT how a Kalmar 2.0 could look in categories such as military power, economy and independence","I asked: “I will give you a scenario, and you will explain the estimated magnitude of each of the categories, I will specify later. Explain in a quantitive and qualitative detail how ever seem relevant to the category. 

Due to the reasons threats from the US to Denmark regarding Greenland, Denmark decides to create a joined Nordic alliance consisting of Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland. A modern Kalmar union could be a term used to explain it. This is formed in order to protect the Nordics from threading super powers such as Russia, China, The US, or similar aggressive nations/alliances. 

Explain in relative format (quali vs quanti) the following categories. Also mention other categories, that I might have missed, which could be relevant as well. Avoid potential other allies as I am focused on how only this “Kalmar 2.0” could be a potential super power. 

Categories: military power (soldiers, defense artillery, navy, air-force or others), ressources (natural resources, economy, energy, production or others), landmass and population, military defense (in case of potential invasion), agriculture, potential necessaries import and export, culture regarding patriotism  (joining the military and supporting the country), and other categories you deem relevant 

Ask me if you need a clearer explanation on something, then tell me. Think deeply about your answer.”

Answer:
“This is a fascinating scenario, and I’ll break it down thoroughly in the specified categories. If anything is unclear or if you’d like more details on a particular aspect, let me know.

Military Power

A united Nordic alliance (Kalmar 2.0) would have a moderately strong military compared to major superpowers but would be outmatched in a direct conflict with global giants like the US, China, or Russia. However, its strength would lie in advanced technology, strategic positioning, and defensive capabilities.

Estimated Quantitative Breakdown:
	•	Active Soldiers: ~120,000–150,000 total (current individual totals: Denmark ~20,000, Norway ~16,000, Sweden ~50,000, Finland ~30,000). Could be expanded with conscription (especially Finland & Sweden, which already have it).
	•	Reservists: ~900,000+ (Finland alone has 870,000 trained reserves due to mandatory service).
	•	Tanks: ~900–1,000 (mostly from Sweden and Finland).
	•	Navy:
	•	Submarines: ~12 (mostly Sweden and Norway).
	•	Frigates: ~12–15 (modern but limited in number).
	•	Corvettes and smaller ships: ~50–60.
	•	Amphibious forces: Well-developed due to Finland, Sweden, and Norway’s coastal defense focus.
	•	Air Force:
	•	Fighter Jets: ~300+ (including Sweden’s Gripen, Denmark & Norway’s F-35s, Finland’s mix of F-18s & future F-35s).
	•	Transport and support aircraft: ~50+.
	•	Missile & Artillery Defense:
	•	Strong in Finland and Sweden, modernizing in Denmark and Norway.
	•	Surface-to-air missile systems (Patriot, NASAMS, etc.).
	•	Cyber & Electronic Warfare: Advanced capabilities, particularly in Sweden and Finland.

Qualitative Analysis:
	•	Strengths: Advanced military tech, strong reserve forces, well-trained soldiers, Arctic and winter warfare expertise, strong cyber capabilities.
	•	Weaknesses: Limited raw military size, reliance on imports for certain weapons (e.g., Denmark & Norway buy most hardware from the US), geographically spread-out nations.

Resources

Natural Resources:
	•	Energy:
	•	Massive renewable energy capabilities (hydropower from Norway, wind power from Denmark, nuclear power from Sweden and Finland).
	•	Oil & Gas: Norway is a major exporter (one of Europe’s largest suppliers).
	•	Minerals & Metals:
	•	Sweden and Finland have large deposits of iron ore, nickel, copper, and rare earth elements (important for defense tech and electronics).
	•	Forestry:
	•	Sweden & Finland have vast forests, providing a strong timber and paper industry.
	•	Fishing Industry:
	•	Norway & Denmark are leading exporters.
	•	Arctic Access:
	•	Greenland provides strategic access to untapped rare minerals, fishery zones, and potential new oil/gas fields.

Economy & Production:
	•	Combined GDP: ~1.8–2.0 trillion USD (comparable to Italy or Canada).
	•	Highly industrialized economies with strong tech, pharmaceutical, and green energy sectors.
	•	Strong welfare states, meaning a potential war economy would need adjustments (higher military spending, possible temporary reduction in social benefits).

Qualitative Analysis:
	•	Strengths: Self-sufficient in energy, large access to rare resources, highly developed infrastructure.
	•	Weaknesses: Small industrial base for military production (heavily reliant on imports for heavy weaponry).

Landmass & Population
	•	Total Area: ~1.32 million km² (similar to India but sparsely populated).
	•	Total Population: ~27 million (low compared to major superpowers).
	•	Population Density: Very low, except in urban areas (Stockholm, Copenhagen, Helsinki, Oslo).
	•	Greenland’s Role: Would add strategic Arctic landmass but with minimal population (~56,000 people).

Military Defense (In Case of Invasion)

Key Defensive Advantages:
	•	Geography:
	•	Mountainous terrain in Norway & Sweden makes invasion difficult.
	•	Finland’s forests & lakes create natural defensive barriers.
	•	The Nordic coastline and archipelagos make amphibious landings difficult.
	•	Arctic Warfare Expertise:
	•	Cold-weather training, winter camouflage, and defensive structures in the north.
	•	Strong Naval & Air Defenses:
	•	Sweden’s Gotland Island would act as a strategic air and naval defense point.
	•	Conscription & Reservists:
	•	Finland alone can mobilize 900,000+ trained soldiers in case of war.

Weaknesses:
	•	Denmark’s flat geography makes it vulnerable.
	•	Limited long-range attack capabilities (no nuclear weapons, limited long-range missiles).
	•	Dependence on foreign military industries (fighter jets, tanks, and advanced weapons mostly imported).

Agriculture
	•	Food Self-Sufficiency: High (Denmark & Finland produce a surplus, Norway & Sweden depend more on imports).
	•	Livestock & Dairy: Denmark is a leading exporter of dairy and pork.
	•	Fishing Industry: Norway is one of the world’s largest seafood exporters.
	•	Weakness: Vulnerable to supply chain disruptions in extreme conflict scenarios.

Potential Necessary Imports & Exports
	•	Imports:
	•	Advanced military equipment (e.g., fighter jets, tanks).
	•	Some food products (tropical fruits, coffee, grains in extreme war situations).
	•	Consumer electronics & industrial machinery.
	•	Exports:
	•	Oil & Gas (Norway).
	•	Renewable energy technology.
	•	Iron ore & rare earth minerals (Sweden & Finland).
	•	Timber & paper.
	•	Seafood (Norway & Denmark).

Culture Regarding Patriotism
	•	Moderate-to-High Military Support:
	•	Finland has the highest military culture (due to historical conflicts with Russia).
	•	Sweden and Denmark have lower military participation but high defense interest.
	•	Norway has strong Arctic & special forces expertise.
	•	Challenges:
	•	Most Nordic countries have low birth rates and aging populations, which could make military recruitment harder over time.
	•	Traditional pacifist sentiment (especially in Sweden) could make full militarization unpopular.

Other Relevant Factors

Technological & Scientific Strength
	•	High-tech industries (especially Sweden & Finland with companies like Ericsson, Nokia, Saab).
	•	Strong AI & cybersecurity development.
	•	Leadership in green energy and sustainability.

Strategic Positioning & Alliances (if not avoiding this aspect)
	•	Arctic access gives strategic military positioning.
	•	Greenland would provide a critical Arctic base.
	•	Baltic Sea control (with Sweden & Finland involved) could block enemy naval movements.

Overall Assessment: Could Kalmar 2.0 Be a Superpower?
	•	Military Strength: Strong but not enough to rival the US, China, or Russia alone. Would excel in defensive warfare and Arctic operations.
	•	Economic Strength: Competitive but not dominant globally—comparable to a mid-tier global power.
	•	Resource Strength: High, especially in energy, minerals, and food production.
	•	Weaknesses: Small population, reliance on foreign military hardware, and some pacifist tendencies.
	•	Strategic Potential: Could become a major regional power, but not a top-tier superpower without nuclear capabilities or major military-industrial expansion.

Ryan’s days became a rhythm of joyful work and heartfelt interactions. He forged deep connections with the animatronics, each one becoming more human-like as they adapted to their roles. The bond they shared was special, built on mutual respect and understanding.

Candy, the vibrant and enthusiastic leader, had a knack for making everyone feel welcome. “Let’s make today magical!” he would cheer, his spirit infectious. Ryan admired Candy’s ability to light up the room with his presence.

Cindy, who had once been nervous and unsure, blossomed into a confident and caring figure. She had a gentle touch that put everyone at ease. “I’m here for you,” she would say, her voice soothing. Ryan appreciated Cindy’s compassionate nature and her genuine concern for others.

Chester’s playful energy was a constant source of joy. He had a way of turning even the simplest tasks into fun and games. “Let’s have some fun!” he would shout, his laughter echoing through the restaurant. Ryan loved Chester’s ability to bring laughter and lightness to any situation.

Blank, with his quiet wisdom and thoughtful demeanor, became a trusted confidant. He had a way of seeing beyond the surface and understanding the deeper needs of those around him. “Tell me what’s on your mind,” he would say, his voice calm and reassuring. Ryan found solace in Blank’s presence, knowing he could always turn to him for advice.

Old Candy’s nostalgic charm made him a favorite among the guests. His stories of the past brought a sense of continuity and history to the restaurant. “Back in the day, we had some unforgettable moments,” he would reminisce, his eyes twinkling with fond memories. Ryan admired Old Candy’s ability to connect with people through his stories.

The Rat’s mischievous nature added a touch of excitement to the team. He had a way of keeping everyone on their toes, always ready with a playful prank or witty remark. “Let’s keep things interesting,” he would say with a grin. Ryan enjoyed the Rat’s sense of adventure and his ability to bring spontaneity to their routine.

The Cat’s elegance and composure brought a sense of sophistication to the restaurant. She had a graceful presence that made everyone feel special. “We’re here to create magic,” she would say, her voice confident and poised. Ryan admired the Cat’s ability to elevate their performances with her refined demeanor.

The Penguins’ synchronized performances continued to be a highlight. Red, with his Australian charm, Blue, with his French elegance, and Green, with his enthusiastic spirit, created a delightful spectacle. “Let’s show them what we’ve got!” Red would chirp, while Blue added, “Oui, let’s make it magnifique!” and Green cheered, “This is going to be unforgettable!” Ryan marveled at the Penguins’ ability to work together seamlessly, each one bringing their unique flair to the team.

As the weeks went by, Ryan realized that Candy’s Burger and Fries had become more than just a restaurant. It was a place where dreams came true, and memories were cherished. The bond between the animatronics and the guests grew stronger with each passing day, creating a sense of community and belonging.

Ryan often took moments to reflect on the journey they had undertaken. He knew that the success of Candy’s Burger and Fries was not just about the food or the performances—it was about the people. The guests who came to the restaurant were more than customers; they were part of the family. And the animatronics, with their unique personalities and human-like qualities, were the heart and soul of it all.

One evening, as Ryan stood on the stage, looking out at the smiling faces of the guests, he felt a profound sense of gratitude. “Thank you all for being here,” he said, his voice filled with emotion. “Candy’s Burger and Fries is not just a place to eat—it’s a place to create memories, to laugh, and to share moments of joy. We’re so grateful to have you all as part of our family.”

Chapter 8: The Accident

A few weeks had passed since the grand reopening of Candy’s Burger and Fries, and business was booming. The restaurant was filled with laughter, excitement, and the delicious aroma of food. The hard work and dedication of Ryan, Jessica, and the animatronics had truly paid off.

One night, after the last guest had left and the lights had dimmed, Ryan stayed behind to close up the restaurant. He walked through the quiet space, reflecting on the day's events and enjoying a moment of solitude.

Suddenly, he smelled smoke and saw faint wisps rising from the kitchen. Panic surged through him as he realized that there was a fire. He rushed to the back of the restaurant to find flames licking at the walls and smoke quickly filling the room.

“We need to get out of here!” Ryan shouted, rushing to wake the animatronics.

Candy's eyes flickered open, instantly sensing the danger. “Fire! We need to act fast!”

Ryan quickly roused Cindy, Chester, Blank, Old Candy, the Rat, the Cat, and the Penguins—Red, Blue, and Green.

“Everyone, we need to grab what we can and get out of here!” Ryan instructed, his voice urgent.

Candy sprang into action. “Follow me, everyone! Let’s make sure we’re all safe!”

Cindy, though nervous, managed to stay focused. “What should we take first, Ryan?”

“Grab the essential supplies and anything valuable,” Ryan replied, quickly gathering important documents and equipment.

Chester's energetic spirit turned serious as he helped gather supplies. “We’ve got this, Ryan. We won’t let anything get left behind.”

Blank, being the strongest, moved with purpose, grabbing the heaviest items and carrying them out with ease. “We’ll make sure to get everything important.”

Old Candy, with his nostalgic charm, added, “Let’s move quickly and stay safe.”

The Rat, with a determined look, said, “We’ll get through this together.”

The Cat, always composed, nodded. “Let’s be careful and thorough.”

The Penguins sprang into action with their unique accents:

Red: “Let’s grab everything we need, mate!”

Blue: “Vite! Quickly, we need to move!”

Green: “Let’s get everything important!”

As the animatronics and Ryan moved swiftly through the restaurant, the smoke thickened and the flames spread. Ryan stayed behind as long as he could, trying to hold back the fire with a fire extinguisher. Sweat poured down his face as he battled the flames, buying precious time for the animatronics to save the most important items.

Candy and Chester led the way, helping Ryan carry the heaviest items. Cindy and Blank made sure no important documents were left behind. Old Candy, the Rat, and the Cat double-checked the area, ensuring nothing was overlooked. The Penguins, with their nimble movements, assisted wherever they were needed.

Finally, the flames grew too intense, and Ryan had to retreat. As they made their way outside, the sound of sirens filled the air. Firefighters arrived quickly, and Ryan directed them to the source of the fire. Thanks to their quick response, the flames were soon under control.

Once the fire was extinguished, Ryan and the animatronics took a moment to catch their breath. The restaurant had suffered some damage, but they had managed to save the most important items.

Overwhelmed by the situation, Ryan fell to his knees, feeling guilt and sorrow wash over him. “If I had been paying attention, this would have never happened,” he whispered, his voice breaking.

The animatronics noticed his distress and gathered around him.

Candy’s eyes filled with concern. “Ryan, are you okay?”

Cindy, her voice soft and comforting, added, “You’ve been so strong through all of this.”

Chester’s grin had faded, replaced with a look of worry. “We’re here for you, Ryan.”

Blank’s voice was steady and reassuring. “We’ll get through this together.”

Old Candy placed a hand on Ryan’s shoulder. “You’ve done an amazing job keeping us safe.”

The Rat, with a determined look, added, “We’re not just a team—we’re family.”

The Cat nodded. “You’re not alone, Ryan.”

The Penguins chimed in with their unique accents:

Red: “We’ve got your back, mate!”

Blue: “Together, we can handle anything!”

Green: “We’ll rebuild and make it even better!”

Ryan took a deep breath, trying to steady his emotions. “You all are going to have to stay at the factory until I figure something out. It’s the safest place for now.”

Candy’s eyes filled with determination. “Don’t worry, Ryan. We’ll be ready to help when you need us.”

Cindy, her voice gentle and supportive, added, “We understand, Ryan. We’ll be here, waiting.”

Chester’s usual grin returned, this time filled with reassurance. “We’ll make the best of it, Ryan. You’ve got this.”

Blank, ever the strong and steady presence, nodded. “We’ll stay ready and prepared.”

Old Candy placed a hand on Ryan’s shoulder. “Take your time to sort things out. We’re in this together.”

The Rat, with a determined look, added, “We’ll be patient. You’re not alone in this.”

The Cat nodded in agreement. “We’ll be here, Ryan. Take care of what needs to be done.”

The Penguins chimed in with their unique accents:

Red: “We’ll stick together, mate!”

Blue: “We’ll support you, Ryan.”

Green: “We’ll be waiting, ready to help.”

Ryan felt a surge of gratitude as he looked at his newfound family. “Thank you, everyone. I’ll make sure everything gets sorted out. I promise.”

As the animatronics disappeared into the distance, heading towards the factory, Ryan watched them go, his heart heavy with the weight of the night’s events. He knew that rebuilding would take time, effort, and resources, but he was determined to restore Candy’s Burger and Fries to its former glory.

As the weeks went by, Ryan worked tirelessly to assess the damage and plan the repairs. He coordinated with contractors, ordered new equipment, and started the rebuilding process. The animatronics remained at the factory, ready to assist whenever needed.

Ryan visited them often, updating them on the progress and sharing his plans. Each visit reinforced the bond they shared and reminded him of the unwavering support he had.

Candy’s eyes would light up with enthusiasm. “We’re with you every step of the way, Ryan!”

Cindy’s gentle smile reassured him. “We believe in you, Ryan. You’re doing an amazing job.”

Chester’s playful spirit lifted his spirits. “We’ll be back in action before you know it!”

Blank’s steady presence provided comfort. “Take it one step at a time, Ryan. We’ll get there.”

Old Candy’s nostalgic wisdom offered perspective. “We’ve come this far together. We’ll see it through to the end.”

The Rat’s determination inspired him. “We’ll rebuild and make it even better, Ryan.”

The Cat’s composure kept him focused. “We’ll overcome this challenge, Ryan. We’re in this together.”

The Penguins’ unique accents added a touch of optimism:

Red: “We’ll rise stronger than ever, mate!”

Blue: “We’ll create something magnifique, Ryan!”

Green: “We’ll make every moment unforgettable!”

In the weeks following the fire, Ryan faced numerous challenges. The restaurant was in ruins, and the damage was extensive. As Ryan reviewed the estimates for rebuilding, he discovered that he needed $500,000 to restore Candy’s Burger and Fries to its former glory. Unfortunately, he only had $400,000 available, leaving him $100,000 short.

Determined to raise the additional funds, Ryan came up with a plan. He decided to rent out the animatronics for private events, birthday parties, and special performances. This way, he could generate the extra income needed to complete the rebuilding process.

Candy, Cindy, Chester, Blank, Old Candy, the Rat, the Cat, and the Penguins were all supportive of Ryan’s plan. They understood the importance of raising the necessary funds and were eager to help in any way they could.

Candy, always the leader, said, “We’re in this together, Ryan. We’ll do whatever it takes to get the restaurant back on its feet.”

Cindy added, “We’ll make these events special for everyone. We’ll bring joy and excitement to all who attend.”

Chester, with his boundless energy, exclaimed, “Let’s get out there and show the world what we can do!”

Ryan organized the events, and soon the animatronics were performing at various venues, delighting audiences with their unique talents. The income from these performances slowly but steadily added up, bringing Ryan closer to his financial goal.

During this time, Ryan also envisioned a grander plan for the rebuilt restaurant. He dreamed of creating a larger, more spectacular venue where each animatronic would have its own stage. He imagined Cindy and Candy performing on the main stage, the Cat and the Rat on a side stage, Blank and Old Candy on their own separate stages, and even a new stage for two additional animatronics—a cat named Scribble and a daycare attendant named Emerald

As Ryan shared his vision with the animatronics, they were filled with excitement and determination.

Candy’s eyes sparkled. “A grand stage for everyone? That sounds amazing, Ryan!”

Cindy smiled warmly. “We’ll create an unforgettable experience for everyone who visits.”

Chester’s enthusiasm was infectious. “I can’t wait to see it all come together!”

Blank’s steady presence provided reassurance. “We’re ready for this new chapter, Ryan.”

Old Candy’s nostalgic charm brought a sense of continuity. “We’ll honor the past while building a bright future.”

The Rat’s determination was unwavering. “We’re stronger than ever, Ryan.”

The Cat’s composure was unshakeable. “We’re ready to shine, Ryan.”

The Penguins chimed in with their unique accents:

Red: “Let’s make it unforgettable, mate!”

Blue: “Let’s create something magnifique, Ryan!”

Green: “Let’s bring joy to everyone who walks through those doors!”

As the grand reopening continued, Ryan felt a surge of pride and gratitude. Candy’s Burger and Fries was more than just a restaurant; it was a place where dreams came true and memories were cherished.

With his animatronic family by his side, Ryan knew that they could overcome any challenge and create something truly magical. Together, they would continue to bring joy, laughter, and unforgettable moments to everyone who walked through their doors.

Chapter 9 the grand reopening

A few weeks after the grand reopening, Ryan decided to take a well-deserved day off. The restaurant was running smoothly, thanks to the hard work and dedication of his animatronic family. Ryan felt a sense of pride as he watched the guests enjoy their time at Candy’s Burger and Fries.

On his day off, Ryan decided to visit the restaurant to check on things. As he walked through the bustling space, he was greeted by the cheerful sounds of laughter and the delicious aroma of food. It was heartwarming to see the community enjoying the place he had worked so hard to rebuild.

Curious to see how the new daycare area was doing, Ryan made his way to the colorful and inviting space. As he entered, he found Cindy, Scribble, and Emerald sitting together, surrounded by the playful décor and toys of the daycare.

Cindy looked up and smiled warmly at Ryan. “Hey, Ryan! Taking a day off, huh?”

Scribble, the new cat animatronic, added with a cheerful tone, “It’s good to see you, Ryan! We’ve been keeping an eye on things here.”

Emerald, the daycare attendant, chimed in with her soft and soothing voice, “The children have been having a wonderful time, and we’ve made sure everything is running smoothly.”

Ryan couldn’t help but smile at the sight of his animatronic friends bonding and taking care of the daycare. “I’m glad to see you all here. How’s everything going?”

Cindy responded, “Everything’s been great! The kids love playing here, and we’ve been having a lot of fun with them.”

Scribble nodded enthusiastically. “We’ve been telling stories, playing games, and making sure everyone feels welcome and happy.”

Emerald added, “It’s been a joy to see the children’s faces light up. We’re doing our best to create a safe and fun environment for them.”

Ryan felt a surge of gratitude as he looked at Cindy, Scribble, and Emerald. “Thank you all for your hard work and dedication. I couldn’t have done this without you.”

Cindy’s eyes sparkled with warmth. “We’re all in this together, Ryan. This place means as much to us as it does to you.”

Scribble grinned. “And we’re always here to help, no matter what.”

Emerald’s gentle smile reassured him. “We’ll continue to make this place a welcoming haven for everyone.”

As Ryan spent a few more moments with his animatronic friends, he felt a deep sense of fulfillment. Candy’s Burger and Fries had truly become a place where dreams came true, and with the unwavering support of his animatronic family, he knew that they could overcome any challenge and continue to bring joy to all who visited.

Chapter 10: Sundays in the Playroom

Every Sunday, Candy’s Burger and Fries took on a different kind of magic. The “Closed for Maintenance” sign was up, but the restaurant wasn’t truly empty. Ryan had made a habit of stopping by, finding solace in the quiet atmosphere, but little did he know, the animatronics had their own way of spending this day.

A Surprise Visit

One Sunday afternoon, Ryan arrived at the restaurant with a cup of coffee in hand. The sun was shining, and the air was crisp. As he walked through the front door, he noticed something peculiar—soft laughter and playful noises coming from the daycare area.

Curious, Ryan made his way toward the sound. As he peeked into the room, he couldn’t help but smile. There they were: Candy, Chester, Cindy, Emerald, Blank, and Scribble, all hanging out together in the daycare. The usually lively animatronics were engaged in different activities, each one enjoying the relaxed atmosphere in their own way.

Games and Giggles

Candy, with his blue fur and red tie, was leading a game of hide-and-seek, his vibrant appearance a perfect match for the colorful playroom. Chester was organizing a mini-tournament of racing arcade games, his competitive spirit bringing out laughs from everyone. Cindy, the purple-furred animatronic, and Emerald were busy crafting, their nimble fingers creating intricate paper decorations.

Blank, always the quiet observer, was sitting in a corner, sketching new ideas for the restaurant. Scribble, true to her name, was bouncing around, helping with every activity and spreading her infectious energy.

Ryan watched from the doorway, feeling a warm sense of contentment. These moments of joy and camaraderie were exactly why he had wanted to give everyone Sundays off. It wasn’t just about resting; it was about creating a space where they could truly be themselves.

Joining the Fun

As he stepped into the room, the animatronics looked up and greeted him with cheerful smiles. “Hey Ryan!” Candy called out, waving him over. “Come join us! We’re just about to start a new round.”

Ryan chuckled and set his coffee down. “Alright, but don’t expect me to go easy on you,” he teased, joining the group.

The afternoon passed in a blur of laughter and games. They played hide-and-seek, built towers with colorful blocks, and even had a friendly dance-off. For a few hours, Ryan felt like a kid again, free from the stresses and responsibilities of running a business.

A Special Tradition

As the sun began to set, the group gathered in the main party room. They sat in a circle, sharing stories and dreams. It had become a tradition for them to end their Sundays like this, a time to reflect and connect.

Ryan leaned back, listening to Candy recount a funny memory from the past week. He felt grateful for these moments, for the bonds they had formed. “You know,” he said, looking around at his friends, “these Sundays have become something really special. I’m glad we decided to do this.”

Candy nodded, his eyes warm with understanding. “It’s our time to be ourselves, to enjoy each other’s company. It’s what makes Candy’s more than just a restaurant.”

As the evening drew to a close, Ryan felt a deep sense of peace. Sundays at Candy’s had become more than just a day off; they were a reminder of the importance of friendship, laughter, and finding joy in the little things.

Chapter 11: Expanding the Team

Sundays had become a special day at Candy’s Burger and Fries. Ryan loved these quiet moments and the surprises they brought. On one such Sunday, he walked into the daycare, drawn by the sounds of laughter and play.

A New Idea

Ryan found the animatronics gathered around a Monopoly game. He couldn't help but smile at Chester's intense focus and Candy's playful teasing. Then he noticed the Penguins—three hardworking servers.

“Hey, you guys are amazing,” Ryan said, walking over to them. “But I’ve been thinking... you were designed for a smaller location, and you’ve been working extra hard here. How would you feel about designing three more Penguins to share the workload?”

The Penguins looked at each other excitedly. Red, with his Australian accent, said, “Mate, we do our best, but it’s a lot for the three of us.”

Blue, with his French accent, added, “Oui, oui! We do our best, but we could use a little help to maintain our elegance and charm.”

Getting Help

Ryan knew he couldn’t do it alone, so he called Jessica, his old friend who had helped him build the animatronics when Candy’s first opened. Jessica was an amazing engineer.

When Jessica arrived, the animatronics greeted her warmly. “Hey Jessica!” Candy called out. “Ready to work your magic again?”

“Absolutely,” Jessica replied with a smile. “Let’s get started!”

Designing the New Penguins

Over the next few Sundays, Ryan, Jessica, and the Penguins met in the daycare to design the new additions. They had a lot of fun and some lively debates.

“I think we should have one who’s great at organizing,” Red suggested.

Blue nodded. “And perhaps one with a flair for entertainment, like me.”

Green, the third Penguin, added, “We need someone who can help with the culinary aspects. Maybe they can specialize in desserts!”

After discussing names, personalities, and special skills, they settled on three new Penguins: Purple, Orange, and Gray.

Building the Team

With the designs ready, Ryan and Jessica spent hours in the workshop building the new Penguins. Purple was organized, Orange loved entertaining, and Gray was a culinary expert.

When the new Penguins were finally ready, Ryan was excited to introduce them to the rest of the team.

A Warm Welcome

On the first Sunday after the new Penguins were built, Ryan invited everyone to the main party room for a special welcome celebration. The animatronics and the original Penguins gathered around, eager to meet their new teammates.

“Everyone, I’d like you to meet Purple, Orange, and Gray,” Ryan announced.

Purple spoke first with a refined British accent. “It's a pleasure to meet all of you. I look forward to helping keep things in order.”

Orange, with an American Southern accent, said, “Howdy, y’all! I’m here to make sure we have a blast and keep those smiles coming!”

Gray, with a laid-back Californian accent, added, “Hey dudes, I’m all about the sweet treats. Can’t wait to share some awesome desserts with everyone.”

Building Memories Together

As the weeks went by, the new Penguins quickly integrated into the daily operations of the restaurant. The increased efficiency allowed the animatronics to spend more time with guests, which brought even more joy to Candy’s.

Sundays continued to be a special time for the group. Ryan often found them in the daycare or the main party room, enjoying each other’s company. The new Penguins fit in perfectly, adding their own unique flair to the mix.

One Sunday, as Ryan watched the animatronics and Penguins play a game of charades, he felt a deep sense of gratitude. Expanding the team had improved the restaurant’s operations and strengthened the bonds of friendship.

Looking Forward

With the new Penguins on board, Candy’s Burger and Fries was thriving like never before. The themed nights were a hit, the guests were delighted, and the team was closer than ever. Ryan knew they would face any challenges together, united by their shared purpose and the special traditions they had built.

As he left the restaurant that evening, Ryan couldn’t help but smile. Candy’s was more than a place of work; it was a family. And Sundays had become a testament to the power of friendship, creativity, and the joy of working together.

Chapter 12: New Beginnings

With the new Penguins—Purple, Orange, and Gray—settled in, the restaurant's atmosphere felt more vibrant than ever. The team was thriving, and the guests could feel the positive energy.

Embracing New Ideas

One Sunday, as the group gathered for their usual coffee and conversation, Cindy brought up a new idea. “I’ve been thinking more about themed nights. Why not give our customers something new and exciting to look forward to?”

Ryan nodded. “I like it. What kind of themes do you have in mind?”

Cindy’s eyes sparkled. “We could have a Retro Night, play classic hits, and dress in vintage outfits. Or maybe an International Cuisine Night with dishes from around the world.”

Scribble added, “And I could paint murals to match the themes! Imagine a 50s diner scene or an Italian piazza right here in Candy’s!”

The group’s excitement was contagious, and Ryan could already see the changes transforming the space.

Planning the First Event

Over the next few weeks, the team worked together to prepare for the first themed night. They chose Retro Night, transforming the restaurant with checkered floors and neon lights. The team donned their best vintage attire, and the jukebox played classic hits.

As the evening progressed, Ryan couldn’t help but smile at the sight of families dancing and friends laughing. The success of Retro Night set the stage for many more themed events to come.

Finding Balance

Despite the excitement and growth, Ryan made sure to maintain the balance they had found. Sundays remained sacred, a time for rest and rejuvenation. The team used these quiet days to reflect, share ideas, and support one another.

One Sunday, as they sat around their favorite booth, Ryan looked around at his friends. “You know, I’ve been thinking about how much we’ve accomplished together. It’s not just about the restaurant. It’s about the memories we’re creating and the lives we’re touching.”

Candy nodded, her eyes warm with understanding. “You’re right, Ryan. Candy’s has become more than just a place to eat. It’s a community, a family.”

As the sun set on another peaceful Sunday, the team knew they were ready to face whatever the future held.

Chapter 13: Growing Together

Candy’s Burger and Fries continued to thrive, thanks to the creativity and dedication of Ryan and his team. The themed nights were a hit, and the guests loved the new Penguins.

A New Challenge

One day, Ryan noticed that the popularity of the themed nights was starting to put a strain on the team. The increased demand meant longer hours and more responsibilities.

Ryan called a meeting to discuss the situation. “I’ve noticed we’ve been working extra hard lately. I think it’s time we find a way to manage the workload better.”

Emerald suggested, “What if we rotate shifts? That way, everyone gets a break while still keeping things running smoothly.”

Chester agreed. “And maybe we can hire some part-time staff to help during the busiest nights.”

Implementing Changes

The team embraced the new plan. They hired part-time staff and created a rotating schedule to ensure everyone had time to rest. The changes made a significant difference, and the team felt more balanced and energized.

Sundays remained a special time for reflection and connection. Ryan often found the animatronics and Penguins in the daycare or the main party room, enjoying each other’s company.

A Sense of Gratitude

One Sunday, as the team gathered for their usual coffee, Ryan looked around at his friends. “I just want to say how grateful I am for all of you. Your hard work and dedication mean the world to me.”

Candy smiled. “We’re grateful for you too, Ryan. You’ve built something amazing here, and we’re proud to be a part of it.”

The group spent the rest of the day sharing stories and laughter, feeling a deep sense of camaraderie and gratitude.

Chapter 14: Building Dreams

As the months went by, Candy’s Burger and Fries continued to grow and evolve. The themed nights became more popular, and the restaurant was always bustling with activity.

A New Project

One Sunday, Ryan brought up a new idea. “I’ve been thinking about expanding the restaurant. Maybe we could add an outdoor seating area or a small stage for live performances.”

The team’s eyes lit up with excitement. Scribble exclaimed, “I could help design the outdoor area! It would be amazing!”

Jessica added, “And I can help with the technical aspects. We could make it something truly special.”

Planning the Expansion

Over the next few weeks, the team worked together to plan the expansion. They brainstormed ideas, created designs, and discussed the logistics. The project brought a new sense of excitement and purpose to the group.

As they worked on the expansion, they continued to maintain the balance they had found. Sundays remained a time for rest and reflection, and the team cherished these moments together.

A Bright Future

One Sunday, as the group gathered in the daycare, Ryan shared his thoughts. “I’m excited about this expansion, but what I’m most grateful for is the journey we’ve been on together. Candy’s isn’t just a restaurant; it’s a place where we’ve built dreams and created memories.”

Candy nodded. “You’re right, Ryan. And with this new project, we’re only going to make it even better.”

The team spent the rest of the day dreaming about the future and building memories together.

Chapter 15: A New Beginning

The expansion of Candy’s Burger and Fries was completed, and the new outdoor seating area and stage were ready for their first event.

A Grand Opening

Ryan and the team planned a special grand opening event to celebrate the expansion. They invited the community, and the turnout was incredible. The new outdoor area was a hit, and the live performances brought even more joy to the guests.

As the evening progressed, Ryan couldn’t help but feel a deep sense of pride and accomplishment. The journey had been challenging, but it was worth it.

Reflecting on the Journey

One Sunday, as the team gathered in the daycare, Ryan took a moment to reflect on the journey. “We’ve come so far, and I couldn’t have done it without all of you. Candy’s is more than just a restaurant; it’s a place where we’ve built dreams, created memories, and found a family.”

Candy smiled. “We’re grateful for you too, Ryan. You’ve built something amazing, and we’re proud to be a part of it.”

The group spent the rest of the day enjoying each other’s company, sharing stories and laughter, and looking forward to the future.

Looking Ahead

With the expansion complete, Candy’s Burger and Fries was thriving like never before. The team was closer than ever, and they knew they could face any challenge together.

As Ryan left the restaurant that evening, he felt a deep sense of gratitude and excitement for what the future held. Candy’s was more than just a place of work; it was a family, and Sundays had become a testament to the power of friendship, creativity, and the joy of working together.",1,1738106173.0,fivenightsatfreddys,0,1.0,False

Last few days have been quiet as we wait for our ride, all is good. Cigs, coffee and camp, rinse repeat.

This morning at abt 630, we're woken up by peace officers, turns out some other travelers came around after we hunkered down, caused a bit of a scene on the way.

Its legal to camp on public property in AB, as long as its not marked as a ""recreation zone"" (super ambiguous term, but essentially boils down to no parks), despite *no posting* turns out camp was on *private* property even though we were roughly half a click from any building/road in the center of town. Well, take the bumps with the bruises IG, its a good thing we can break down in about 5 mins.

All in all im thankful, the peace officers were *super* chill, they asked why we were out there, I explained our story, they even gave us till tomorrow to head out, no ticket, nothing didn't even ask ID. In fact, they gave me some suggestions of some (less than stellar tbh) locations in town that are either public/crown owned. Despite having a day to pack up and move I told TB, ""we'll have less trouble if we leave now. The cops were *way* nicer than they had to be.""

So we did, camp down and packed 5 mins flat, closest legal spot is abt 30 mins away by foot.

So now, we sit at the tims, charging, keeping warm. I hope TB is ready to hitch out soon bc IDK if we have the time to wait for our ride anymore.

**The Ace**

It was the kind of case that DI Vickers could feel in her bones before she even arrived at the scene. The call had come in just after midnight: a body discovered in the heart of the city’s wealthiest district, slumped in the corner of a magnificent penthouse apartment. The dispatcher’s tone carried the weight of something grim and droll, something unusual.

Now dusk, Vickers stepped out of the car, coffee in hand, her boots clicking against the polished marble of the building’s entrance. The elevator ride to the top floor felt interminable, her young but practiced mind already cataloguing what she might face.

The door to the penthouse was wide open, a uniformed constable standing awkwardly outside. “DI Vickers,” she said briskly, flashing her badge. The constable nodded, his pale face betraying his unease.

“It’s... you’d best see for yourself, ma’am,” he said.
Inside, the air was cool and faintly scented with something expensive and artificial; cologne, perhaps. The apartment was pristine, the kind of home that practically screamed money. Nothing seemed out of place, except for the man in the armchair by the window.

He was in his forties, dressed immaculately in a tailored suit, as if he had been preparing for an evening out—or an important meeting. His head lolled slightly to one side; a single, neat gunshot wound above his right temple. The blood, though stark against the pale leather of the chair, was contained—no splatter, no chaos.
It was a clean kill, Vickers noted. The kind of precision that spoke of control, of planning. But it wasn’t the wound or the man’s lifeless expression that drew her attention. It was the card.
Tucked neatly into the breast pocket of his blazer, just peeking out like an absurd handkerchief, was the Ace of Spades. Vickers knelt to examine it, careful not to disturb the crime scene. It was a standard playing card, unremarkable at first glance, yet it felt heavy with intent. The arrowhead of the spade had a small line of red running down the card.

“Any sign of forced entry?” Vickers asked, glancing up at the forensic officer who was snapping photographs of the body. 
“None, ma’am,” came the reply. “No broken locks, no scratches on the windows. Whoever did this, the victim either let them in—or they had access.”

She straightened, her sharp eyes scanning the room. There was something unnervingly personal about this killing. The card was deliberate, a signature of sorts, but why? Was it a taunt? A message? Or something else entirely?

“Do we have an ID on the victim?”

“Michael Chad,” said a second officer, consulting a driver’s licence. “Financier. Big name in the city, or so I’m told. No known criminal record, but we’re digging into his background now.”

Vickers nodded, her mind already racing ahead. Men like Chad rarely ended up in situations like this without skeletons rattling in their closets. “Check his phone, his emails, his calendar—anything that tells us who he was meeting or expecting to see tonight.”

As the team began their work, Vickers lingered by the window, her eyes drifting over the glittering cityscape, with a faint remnants of a constellation fading from the night before. Somewhere out there was a person who had walked into this room, pulled the trigger, and left behind a single, chilling clue.

A sound behind her made her turn. It was Detective Henderson, arriving late but with his usual quiet determination. “What do we have? Any sign of DNA?” he asked, glancing at the body and the card.

“A man killed cleanly in his own home,” Vickers said. “No sign of a struggle, no sign of entry. And this.” She gestured to the card.
Henderson’s brow furrowed. “An Ace of Spades. That’s odd.”
“No,” Vickers agreed. “It’s deliberate. The question is—what does it mean?”

As the forensic team worked late into the night, Vickers felt the weight of the case settling on her shoulders. This wasn’t like the domestic disputes or crimes of passion she’d handled before. This was something colder, more calculated.

It won’t be until later that Vickers would learn just how significant the card truly was. For now, all she could do was stare at the lifeless body of Michael Chad and wonder what kind of killer she was dealing with—and what the Ace of Spades was meant to signify.

1icf6vj,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1icf6vj/what_would_you_do_about_this_confusing_second/,What would you do about this confusing second date situation?,"I went on a coffee date about two weeks ago with a guy I know through a mutual friend. He was polite and seemed like a gentleman, though at times he gave off a bit of a “fake woke” vibe. The date was short—about an hour—and he walked me to my car afterward, asked about a second date, and we said our goodbyes.

Here’s where it gets weird: I didn’t hear from him for a couple of days after the date—not even a simple “Did you get home safe?” text. Then, out of nowhere, he texts me asking if I’d be comfortable being added to a group chat with a girl he recently met at a funeral. He said she and I have a lot in common and would get along (we’re from the same ethnic background and work in the same industry). I thought this was a strange and unnecessary request, so I asked him to just send me her info instead.

Turns out, I actually know this girl! We’re not close friends, but we know each other, and she’s a good person. When I told him this, he still kept pushing for the group chat. It felt unnecessary and uncomfortable since I already knew her better than I knew him. I ignored his request and kept the conversation casual, but then he called me (we had never spoken on the phone before).

On the call, he asked why I wasn’t open to the group chat—implying it might be because I’m shy or something. I explained that I already know her, and if I wanted to reconnect, I could do it on my own. Then he started contradicting himself—he originally said he met her at a funeral, but on the phone, he claimed they actually grew up together. The contradiction threw me off, and the way he kept pushing for the group chat felt like unnecessary mansplaining.

Finally, I told him he could make the group chat if it was that important to him, but then he got cold and said, “It’s not that deep, I’ll just text her.” The whole thing felt awkward and left me frustrated. He’s also never checked in on me or followed up about anything personal—it’s like he only texts to send resources or push for his agenda.

Then last week, he randomly asked me out for a second date (for that same day). I wasn’t free, so I suggested the following week instead. He made a reservation, and now the date is coming up.

Here’s why I’m conflicted:
	1.	I feel weird about how he acted. He barely knows me but was already talking about me to other people and being pushy about the group chat. I’m also a very private person, so this felt invasive.
	2.	He’s well-connected in our community, and we have mutuals, so I don’t want things to get awkward or tense between us. And I’m also questioning if this is a good person to be comfortable with because if things don’t go well, I don’t want him airing out my business.

I don’t know if I should go on this second date or just call it off. The whole situation left me feeling confused and uncomfortable. Or am I just overthinking it? What would you do in my position?

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”

In an extraordinary address before the National Assembly, Prime Minister Adriano Moreira today announced plans to leverage Portugal's substantial gold reserves and issue a major colonial bond series to sustain the increasingly fragile position of the Estado Novo in Africa. The unprecedented move aims to alleviate mounting fiscal and balance of payments pressures that threaten to engulf the overseas territories amid escalating insurgencies.

""We stand at an important moment in time in our long and glorious history as a pluricontinental nation,"" Moreira declared to the chamber. ""Insidious forces, backed by foreign powers, seek to dismantle five centuries of Christian civilisation and development across our African provinces. The very survival of Lusophone cultural values on the continent is in jeopardy.""

""Faced with this existential challenge, it is incumbent upon all true patriots to mobilise every means at our disposal to support the valiant efforts of our military and civilian defenders in Angola, Mozambique, and Guinea. Through providence, Portugal enjoys a veritable war chest of bullion reserves, the accumulated fruit of generations of our people's toil under the Salazarist creed of work and savings. Let us now deploy this immense patrimony to secure the blessings of stability and progress for all loyal citizens from the Minho to the Zambezi.""

Under the government's audacious plan, up to 100 tonnes of the nation's >!866-tonne!< official gold stockpile, currently valued at $310 million, will be earmarked as collateral for a special series of five-year bonds to fund development and defence in the overseas provinces. By leveraging this bullion hoard, one of the world's largest, the Treasury aims to raise an initial stipend of 8 billion escudos ($294 million), with scope for further issuances as needed.

The proceeds from the bonds will flow into a vastly expanded Fundo de Defesa do Ultramar, which will, in turn, channel indispensable foreign exchange to the troubled Fundos Cambiais in Angola and Mozambique. Chronic deficits in both territories' current accounts with the metropole have depleted their foreign reserves and led to crippling arrears on transfers, import bills, and debt servicing.

According to Finance Ministry projections, the full 8 billion escudo bond programme could cover the two territories' combined 6.1 billion escudo 1972 deficit with Portugal proper, trim a year off settlement backlogs, and free up to 3 billion escudos for enhanced infrastructure and security spending. The analysis suggests Angola and Mozambique's overall payments gaps could narrow by over 2.5 billion escudos apiece over 1973–74.

### Territorial Bond Revenue Impact

|                          | 1973 Proj. | 1974 Proj. |
|--------------------------|------------|------------|
| Angola Deficit Coverage  | 3.3        | 4.5        |
| Mozambique Deficit Coverage | 2.8      | 3.7        |
| Reduction in Transfer Arrears | 2.0    | 2.5        |
| Counterinsurgency & Infrastructure | 1.5 | 1.8      |
| **Total Impact** (billions of escudos)         | **9.6**    | **12.5**   |

While risky, Moreira's team argues that such unorthodox measures are essential to preserving Portugal's imperial reach as the global monetary order frays. With the US abandoning gold convertibility and the free market price for the metal soaring, proponents believe the timing is ideal to transmute idle bullion into a potent new financial weapon. The bonds' lofty 9% coupon, while raising eyebrows, is deemed necessary to entice private buyers and patriotic institutions to open their coffers for the federal Lusophone cause.

The plan has nonetheless come under blistering attack from an array of critics, who variously decry it as a neo-mercantilist folly, a crony capitalist catastrophe, and a morally bankrupt last gasp of Lusotropicalism. Sceptical bankers warn the high-yielding debt could quickly become unsustainable if the gold price slumps or the security situation deteriorates. Fiscal conservatives blast the scheme as a reckless ""doubling down"" on a visionary imperial mission at the expense of metropolitan development.

On the nationalist ultra-right, hardliners like General Kaúlza de Arriaga dismiss Moreira's ""hocus pocus"" as a sideshow to Portugal's military imperative to crush the insurgents with overwhelming force. They argue the funds would be better spent on naval frigates, helicopter gunships, and elite commando units than on hydroelectric megaprojects and indigenous hearts-and-minds campaigns.

Conversely, progressive elements see the bonds as a shameless ploy to co-opt Portugal's budding industrial elite and divert resources from urgent domestic reforms. The Lisbon weekly Expresso captured the disquiet in a wry editorial entitled ""O Último Grito do Império."" Students, trade unionists, and radical officers decry the ""blood money"" as a sop to monopoly capital and a morally odious life-support system for the colonial regime.

Despite the crescendo of criticism, the Moreira cabinet appears determined to press ahead, convinced that prudent financial engineering, civic action, and strategic concessions can yet salvage Portugal's imperial project. Allies argue that the gold bond initiative, coupled with the broader ""For a Better Guinea"" and ""For a Better Angola"" reform programmes, reflect a mature reckoning with demographic and developmental realities in the colonies.

By embracing a multi-racial meritocracy, accelerated Africanisation of provincial administration, and massive infrastructure upgrades, supporters contend that Portugal can drain the insurgency of its basis and lay the ground for an enduring Lusophone federation. The gold reserves and robust domestic capital markets, they argue, provide Lisbon with a unique capacity to bypass an unsympathetic international community and independently finance this enlightened imperial reconceptualisation.

Moreira's wager is that such an influx of investment, combined with new modes of political incorporation, will prop up loyalist African elites and the burgeoning multiracial middle class in the ""Lusophone states."" This expanding stratum of civil servants, smallholders, skilled workers, and indigenous petty bourgeoisie, the thinking goes, can form the nucleus of a moderate, pro-Western shield against revolutionary nationalism and Soviet-sponsored anarchy.

In this optimistic vision, Angola's booming coffee, diamond, and petroleum sectors, and Mozambique's Cahora Bassa dam complex will become powerful engines of export-led growth and modernisation. The government's hope is that the gold-backed bond revenues, by priming the pump of this state-led development model, can buy sufficient time for a genuine Lusophone consciousness to take root.

More sober voices have queried the viability of such an imperial Ave Maria in the face of inexorable African aspirations and declining domestic tolerance for the war effort. With the annual defence bill devouring over a third of the budget and fully 8% of GDP, the frenzied gold ""dowry"" and austerity for the masses are unlikely to reverse the plummeting legitimacy of Caetanismo.",6,1738105375.0,ColdWarPowers,0,1.0,False

All the examples of the times I should have known better: FEEL FREE TO SKIP AHEAD 
This “friend” has done numerous things such as taking pictures of me, laughing at them, and continuing to do so despite me requesting that she stopped. It took several tries before she finally apologized for making me uncomfortable, she later started crying which I now feel was manipulative. She would always ask me to edit her school work, literally every day (we are student teachers for context) and would take time out of my own planning to help her. One time, in my favourite class (she wouldn’t know because she never really listened to me) she made us switch laptops so I could edit her work. It got to the point where I was doing it most days even when I didn’t want to, I just didn’t know how to say no. She would make petty comments if I hung out with friends from my cohort or even simply sat somewhere else…she would continue to make such comments. One time, over text when I was with my cohort friends, I asked where she was. She replied that she would tell me “only on one condition.” Which was odd, she ended up telling me. Along with taking pictures she even made a comment about loyalty testing friends partners, saying “I would never do that to you” implying that my bf would probably leave me for her? She was also surprised I had a bf before my current one, which I found offensive. On top of this she would ask me to make her coffees and then get petty if I did not (I did when I went to her house). I one time went to shoppers asked her if she wanted anything and she didn’t reply in time and I would be late to class waiting and she was petty about that too. Whenever I talked about my problems it seemed like she was never listening and after talking to my best friend about this, she made me realize that body language, lack of eye contact, and multitasking are all indicators of listening. This friend often did not care about actually helping me. This is just a bit of background. 

Our friend ship ended: CURRENT SITUATION 
We were put into a group project, four of us where two of the members are sisters. The two sisters reached out to us over email on Thursday or Friday and sent over a google slides/ doc so we could collaborate. The two sisters were ahead and took care of part 1 and asked us to contribute for part 2. Me and this friend communicated over text and she said she would get to it on Sunday and I said I was going to work on it Saturday. She minimized the activity in text (indigenous focused) and said we should just take the group out to mediate … her dad is getting surgery so I assumed she wasn’t giving it much thought. Anyways. I crafted an activity that was well thought out and emailed EVERYONE including this friend Saturday night, I asked for feedback and input from EVERYONE. She never replied to the thread while the others did. This friend messaged me today, Monday 8pm, a day before the presentation asking if the other members had discussed anything. I told her “I emailed the one I made and you didn’t really contribute at all but you can lead the discussion after I explain it” … offering her a part. She blew up on me saying I didn’t include her and that I was rude for not contacting her directly. She said we should have worked on this portion together because the other girls were doing the activity. I just had time on sat night and still believe the group should have input on the activity as it is the most important part. I also offered her a part in the presentation but she lost it after I said I already emailed and contacted? 

She started freaking out and telling me not to contact her, calling me fake, and made a remark about my self esteem. I stood up for myself for once and am glad the friendship was over. But i am a people pleaser and offer people more compassion than they deserve at times. I feel she was highly irrational, erratic, disrespectful our whole friendship, selfish, and just a bad friend. She is an adult (27) and I am 23…but she acts like a child. She didn’t have an idea for the project and that’s fine but she could have at least replied to the email chain, and added her thoughts or maybe crafts a discussion question or requested the other member to assign her part? REGARDLESS, she could have just accepted the part I assigned, but she started raging about joining a new group. 

Look friend or not, be accountable for your own education and communicate with your group, why should I have to hold her hand? The second I said one honest thing she freaked out, and now she’s going to bad mouth me to everyone in her cohort… the same things she did to another friend who “had to apologize to her” to be back in the group… 

I’m done, when you realize you’re happy you don’t have to spend the day with someone or worry about your other social connections, or sacrifice ur time/resources for someone who literally only takes and never gives… man why? 

And just for a chuckle, the only nice thing she did for me in our 3-4 month friendship was give me frother for lattes which she demanded to receive back…? Like are you kidding me? 

I needed to vent and I’d really like to discuss with others who run into toxic friends to often… how do we improve our boundaries and make better friends? ",1,1738105189.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

I have been drinking coffee in the morning as I always do, but today I drank a Celsius instead.

I am 24, so what I'm reading says that 196 should be my maximum heart rate, and 135-ish should be my target. Staying below 140 seems almost impossible right now, and I'm at or above 90% (180bpm) most of the time if I'm not careful.

Is this just because my heart needs some training after a sedentary lifestyle, and/or should I be avoiding caffeine before cardio?",1,1738104992.0,beginnerfitness,3,1.0,False

Okay, so here I am again making one last call to the fabulous world of Istanbul-based gentlemen. (Yep, I’ve posted here before, but hey, life’s a marathon, not a sprint!)

I’m on the hunt for a charming, generous sugar daddy who appreciates wit, humor, and someone who can probably out-talk an auctioneer. I’m a teacher by day, dreamer by night, and an unapologetic lover of deep conversations, Turkish baklava, and spontaneous adventures.

Here’s the thing: I’m willing to travel to meet you. Planes, trains, magic carpets—you name it, I’m on board. But I’d love for you to be based in Istanbul (or at least somewhere I can get to before I finish my third cup of coffee).

I’m incredibly excited to meet someone new and see where this could go. So, if you’re a kind, supportive, and all-around fascinating gentleman looking for a dynamic, fun-loving partner-in-crime, let’s make this happen! Message me, and let’s create a story even better than a Netflix reboot.

Is it a sign of constipation ? low motility ?  
Why the separate bowel movements ?   
What should I try to work on to reduce my transit time ? MMC or Colon motility ? I'm a bit lost between these two.

Last issue in October I was admitted for Enteritis as I was having liquid diarrhea 15-20 times. Due to blood work being normal besides high heart rate and slightly elevated blood count the ER dr was going to send me home and have me take over the counter medicine. I explained I was in pain and not feeling good. Finally a CT scan was ordered and shown a possible blockage snd inflammation of my small intestine. I was admitted and on fluids and nil by mouth. Diarhea finally stopped 12 hours later. They described what I had as a stomach bug on steroids. 

Yesterday I went to see my primary care as I've been suffering from constipation. I don't remember when I last pooped it may be 5-7 days. I'm getting stomach pain, abdominal pain and pain in my sides. Took miralax yesterday and thought I could poop but felt like there was nothing there but was poop when I wiped. I felt like there was poop to pass but was not. 

Today I don't feel like eating had a couple of cups of coffee and some Ramen noddles.

Stomach pain is constant and abdominal pain comes and goes nausea is none stop and getting worse I don't vomit from gastroparesis just none stop nausea. 

I have passed wind a couple of times.

Any advice what to do? When would an ER visit be justified?

During our second date, we hooked up. I realized we never talked about what we were looking for beforehand (although my mutual friends definitely knew I've been looking for something serious). He didn't text me after 24 hours so I sent him a message ""I had fun yesterday! I'm looking for something serious - are you too? If so, see you on Friday! If not, it was so nice to meet you."" He replied that he was looking for something serious but he didn't think we had the chemistry he was looking for and that he would like to be friends/get dinner on Friday. I suggested we get coffee instead. After getting coffee, we continued to text and it was very clear he was looking to hookup. We did hook up two more times, but I realized I was starting to get attached, so I knew the right thing was to cut it off. I sent him a nice message ""It was really nice getting to know you, but I need to only focus on something serious right now, so I think it's better if we limit our interactions moving forward. I hope you find what you're looking for!"" He said ""Makes sense, happy to be friends."" But I then told him I'd rather not be friends because I would hope that a future partner isn't friends with exes/past hookups, so I wouldn't be either. He flipped out and started texting me degrading/condescending things.

Why was he upset? Did he actually want to be friends? I was surprised by his reaction. What would have been a better way to handle this? Some of my friends said it was harsh to send a message that I didn't want to be friends and I could have been more empathetic / soft ghosted him (which is disrespectful imo....)",0,1738104646.0,relationship_advice,9,0.33,False

1iceszp,https://i.redd.it/dfi4z7sddtfe1.jpeg,Help kittens get along? Or at least co-exist!,"Sorry if that’s the incorrect flare, and apologies for the blurry image! It’s the only reference I really have of their size difference (although both have grown since this).

Essentially, the issue me and my housemate have is that the bigger cat (Wolfie) wants to play with the smaller cat (Coffee) so badly. None of his body language seems aggressive at all, he truly seems to just be really excited to have a playmate whenever he sees her.

However, Coffee seems absolutely petrified of Wolfie. It has gotten better with exposure, since she can now be in the room with him and even right next to him so long as he mostly leaves her alone. Which he, unfortunately, does not really want to do.

It’s an issue we’re not quite sure how to resolve. We don’t necessarily want to punish Wolfie for just wanting to play? But also we do obviously punish him for behaviours that obviously bother her (usually removing him from the room if he ignores her hissing and/or growling, as an example). However, things have kind of come to a standstill at this level of growth, and they have fought a few times because of this (only like, 3-4 times since November, so not often, but often enough that we can’t leave them alone together just yet).

Essentially was just wondering if people had any advice on how to advance from here other than simple perseverance? Thanks!

-

Extra information that may be useful:
 - Wolfie is a little over a year old (born in November, we think), while Coffee is roughly 7 months old (born in July, we think).
- We were unfortunately lied to about Wolfie’s age when we adopted him, so he was actually only about 6-7 weeks, so while he’s really well socialised with humans, he isn’t with cats. He isn’t aggressive, but we think he just doesn’t understand what a lot of cat behaviour means.
- Wolfie lived in the house we’re in before we got Coffee, so there could be some scenting/territory stuff going on.
- Wolfie is huge. He’s currently about 5kg. Coffee, meanwhile, was the runt of her litter and is still quite small (I don’t have her exact weight, though).
- Coffee initially had no issues with him when we first introduced them, but this may have been due to her being in a cage/crate at that time. Her issues only seemed to really begin after he tried to hump her twice, something he has not done for months now, luckily.
- Wolfie has always been an indoor cat, since he was born, while Coffee was a stray until a few weeks before we took her in. So she does have a lot more nervous habits/energy anyway. She’s also generally very nervous around people other than me and my housemate, despite our attempts so far to get her used to at least being around others.
- Both are leash/harnesses trained! So that is usable if needed.",10,1738104625.0,CatTraining,5,0.92,False
1icesbl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1icesbl/why_does_my_wife_get_angry_when_i_help_her/,Why does my wife get angry when i help her,"I have been married for almost 8 years and there were alot of ups and downs but one of the issues that puzzles me and frustrated me is that when i help my wife with the kids she gets angry and its a specific situation. She always liked staying up late alone and sometimes more than often she would stay up watching a movie or tv show or doing any chores for her pr the house then she would go to sleep very late. When the kids wake up I would be up with them making them food whatsoever and prepare coffee for her when she wakes up. She usually wakes up 3 to 8 hours after us which is an issue to me but not a big deal. 
The main problem is that when she wakes up she is angry with me for no good reason and when i ask she would say “i saw a bad dream about you” or “I don’t feel i like you today” then she would act cold or angry for the rest of the day. This bothers me alot and i told her that you act like this when i do this specific favor for you but still nothing changed. This behavior is more frustrating when i help with the kids and im tired or have a work to do but she wakes up this way. Last week i was sick and had a fever for a whole day but still stayed up with our youngest and gave the kids their medicine so she would sleep but when she wake up she is angry and said i saw a dream about you.
