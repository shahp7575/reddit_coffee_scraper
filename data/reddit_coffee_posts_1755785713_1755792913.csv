I‚Äôve had a gaming computer since 2018. It‚Äôs a Skytech. I‚Äôm not super tech savvy when it comes to repairs and need help figuring out what I need to do. 

Here‚Äôs what happened. 
Random pop up with a big ): that said something along the lines of something is broken and needs repair. Followed by a windows screen that said repairing. It stayed on my screen for hours. I finally turned my computer off and tried to reset. Now all it does is flash for a few seconds and turns off and the flashes and turns off. I have unplugged, flipped the power switch in the back, restarted and removed unnecessary external plug ins like camera etc. but have no luck past the flashing system. It does not stay on long enough for the screen to even show anything. So I‚Äôm sure some piece of hardware has to be fixed or replaced. 

Here are the specs:

CPU: Intel Core i7-8700K Coffee Lake 6-Core

1mwf9m1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/1mwf9m1/at_15_i_was_writing_business_ideas_every_day_by/,At 15 I was writing business ideas every day. By 17 I had begun a decade of scrolling them away.,"At school I was competitive, positive (voted Happiest student by my peers) and my parents divorcing gave me reason to seek out distraction. Looking back it was no wonder social media engulfed me.

I loved creating, I loved the dopamine hit when a hot girl liked my Insta, but nothing compared to the constant exposure to other people‚Äôs creativity. It was like having an endless, contextually aware joke book I could refresh to laugh my demons away.

Despite my positive experiences I could see the negative impact social media was having on friends that were getting cyber-bullied and becoming addicted to their phones. The thing I hated most, though, was seeing friends post something and then take it down hours later because it didn't get likes. Their passion, their creativity, their self-image was at the mercy of others and soon people felt less comfortable creating and the consumption-economy that social media is today, was born.

I even wrote a children's book 'It's Cool To Be Me', for my A Level English coursework which I published after uni. The moral of that story: Don't do things to please others, as long as **you** like it, do it, and support people where you can.

Point being... This has been a passion of mine for 10+ years. But aware of the dangers as I was, I was not immune.

At University I fell into a spiral of consumption. I racked up over 1 year's worth of hours on Fortnite in 3 years. I lost my creative edge, posted less on socials and fell into the trap of living vicariously through people with more courage and discipline than myself. I thought I was happy, I thought I was in control and that I could stop at any time. I was wrong. I wasted the freedom I had, something I am trying to make up for now.

When I started my first corporate job things got even worse. You see, naturally, I am a night owl, but unnaturally (i.e. with my phone), I am nocturnal. I was staying up until 3-4am, rising again at 6am for a 2 hour commute, falling asleep on the train there, falling asleep on the train back and lacking the energy to do anything other than consume junk content.

Over the next year my health plummeted, relationships fell apart, Covid hit and I was trapped in a room pondering a life I couldn't have even imagined a few years prior. I spent no time outdoors, alienated myself from friends and had no motivation to prioritise myself. I loved my phone and social media but they nearly ruined my life and the craziest thing is that at the time I thought I was okay. I was numb and for some reason that was good enough until one question jumpstarted my life [again.In](http://again.In) late 2022 I began a new job and one of the perks was a complimentary therapy session. I didn't think I needed one but I was watching The Sopranos at the time and it seemed to be going swell for Tony so I felt compelled. It was a very surface level chat but one thing the therapist asked changed the trajectory of my life.

""Are you happy?""

My instinctive answer was, ""Yeah I think so"", but on reflection I was confusing happy with comfortable, an easy but costly mistake to make.

I was drifting into a life of 0 stimulation, 0 achievement, 0 stories to tell, 0 opportunities created etc. etc. you get the picture. I was shocked. Within a month I had left my 'comfortable relationship', within 6 months I had moved out of my mum‚Äôs place to a flat with my best friend, Dan, and I was in a much better place mentally; but still something was missing.

I was still filling my time scrolling reels, sending TikToks to my friend across the room and micro-dosing dopamine. Days blurred into weeks and the big ideas from my teenage years remained suppressed by whatever the algorithm served me.

After six months of living together it soon became obvious we were facing similar issues and one Thursday lunchtime coffee walk, we finally addressed it:

* We rarely have any free time
* We thought we would have made more progress in life
* Time feels like it is moving by too fast

We decided to help one another, which felt easier than helping ourselves and the answer was obvious, spend less time scrolling.¬†

But achieving this felt nothing short of impossible.

We tried everything. At first we took a light approach with Apple Screen Time and once we'd dismissed that every 15 minutes, we graduated to Opal which despite looking promising, we found work arounds for and eventually deleted within weeks. We then spent ¬£50 on a Brick for the flat and that worked slightly better, for a month, but is now collecting dust. We felt pathetic, we felt useless and guilty that we couldn't be trusted.¬†

A physical barrier in the way does not fix the reality that you're addicted to your phone. You will find a way around it.¬†

So, we had to build our own solution or succumb to a life of mediocrity, doom-scrolling, brilliant.

How can we drill our thumbs not to dart back to TikTok less than a second after closing it. How can we train our hands not to go for our phone whenever we're threatened by an awkward silence. How can we teach our minds to break through this unconscious barrier, which we have coined as 'The Third Wall', out of auto-pilot and into consciousness, to no longer suppress thoughts and feelings which we must express in order to grow, improve and move on.

Instead of treating the symptoms, we had to address the underlying issue. How can we break the addiction to our phones?

This phonemenon (wordplay!) of addiction is perhaps the most viral, but even with all the brain rot, humans are fundamentally the same. A change in behaviour comes as a result of small iterations, habits, routines and rituals, which compound over time.

So we set out to create a ritual to separate ourselves physically from our phones, regain our individuality, build new habits, rebuild old passions, rediscover our identities and combat the reflex and urge to scroll.

After a few iterations this is what we settled on:

* Put the phone down
* Light a candle
* Write down whatever comes to mind

Once 15, 30, even 60 minutes have passed and your thoughts have poured out (I say 'hello brain' aloud and tap into my internal voice if I need to get the ball rolling), go and do what you want to do. Unsurprisingly this never resulted in scrolling. Instead it was reflection, manifestation, journalling, crying, stretching, running, creating, cooking new recipes and a flood of ideas that presented.¬†

Most importantly it diverted me to my purpose. I want to help parents see more of their children's smiles, I want to help couples find their connection again and to help those of us who are fed up with scrolling our lives away. I want to lead by example, connect to my inner child and make my 15 y/o self proud. The idea I have landed on is an anti-scroll lifestyle brand and community for people like us fed up with living on auto-pilot and sharing the ritual that worked for me.

Ask yourself, ""Are you happy?"", and if scrolling is one of the reasons you're not, I challenge you to face the noise that lurks in boredom and silence. Light a candle, put your phone down, and let your thoughts surface.

1mwf8xu,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_NoChange7641/comments/1mwf8xu/leaving_cert_crucial/,Leaving cert crucial,"Hey guys,

I put up a post recently about worries that students have coming into the leaving cert year. A lot of you replied with many more messaging me so me and a friend decided to create something for you.

We created a drive/file for incoming 6th years to help prepare for the upcoming year. It can be a very stressful year and I totally I understand, so I tried only included the crucials because who wants to read pages and pages about the thing that stresses them out lol. It includes content like tackling exam season, what to do after the mocks, developing the right mindset and more. The earlier you begin to think about these things, the better your year will go which really helped me.

Knowing the content is one part but preparing yourself is another which I think a lot of people overlook. Right now it's really just the skeleton for what we wanna do/add in the next few weeks. We'll be hosting zooms with top students, guidance counsellors and more.  For the price of a coffee, I dont think it's bad.

[whop.com/clueta](http://whop.com/clueta)

There is the site, we also have a discord where students can talk to and support each other which I think is helpful. If 5th years are looking to join, I would recommend them to.

I have been going around and around in my head wondering how it could be possible that Ethel would leave him there. How COULD YOU??? Like GIRL. In a STORM, he is petrified and u just left him there ALL because you expected him to be a big masculine man no fear except fear itself type guy? I couldn‚Äôt make it make sense in my head until last night. I was lying in bed singing Tempest to myself, half asleep. Thinking very deeply about the lyrics, 

‚ÄúI‚Äôll hurt myself if I want / I don‚Äôt care / Do you swing from your neck with the hope / someone cares? / Please, just go easy on me / I am young and naive / I don‚Äôt know what I need.‚Äù

Also thinking very deeply about how at the end of the excerpt Hayden gave us about the night of the tornado at Shady Grove, Ethel details that she ‚Äúleft‚Äù Willoughby ‚Äúcurled between the couch and the coffee table when it all got too loud.‚Äù She also says: ‚Äú‚ÄòBe mean,‚Äô is what he‚Äôd tell me every time I‚Äôd start my shaking. What he didn‚Äôt tell me is that you can be mean and still be a coward. Some things you have to learn on your own.‚Äù 

Thinking about how it sounds like, to me, Willoughby was deeply overwhelmed by Ethel‚Äôs love and attachment to him. It‚Äôs generally accepted that the line ‚ÄúDo you swing from your neck / with the hope someone cares?‚Äù is Willoughby asking Ethel about her intent when she‚Äôs going on and on about the abuse and trauma in HER family, while he just sits at the wayside listening and absorbing her pain with all this pain of his own that‚Äôs got nowhere to go. I was theorizing last night as I laid in bed ‚Ä¶ I think Willoughby was trying to k!|| himself in that storm. And maybe it didn‚Äôt even start that way‚ÄîI think they got in a horrible, existential type fight and then maybe it started to storm, and THEN, Willoughby‚Äôs real fear started to settle in and debilitate him. All the while, Ethel was still going on and on about their fight (‚ÄúI‚Äôve been picking names for our children / you‚Äôve been wondering how you‚Äôre gonna feed them / love is not enough in this world / but I still believe in / Nebraska dreaming‚Äù). Willoughby, in his fear and panic and anger, wedged himself underneath a bunch of furniture there, pulling SOMETHING along the lines of lemme-die-lemme-die! The reality probably started to settle in for Ethel as the storm intensified and their fight came to a breaking point ‚Äî Ethel screaming ‚Äúcome with me you‚Äôll d!e here!!‚Äù and Willoughby just paralyzed and given up. Ethel left him there, thinking, ‚Äúhe‚Äôll get over it. Be mean is what he says. Be mean. He‚Äôll find his way out.‚Äù 

The end of Tempest: ‚Äúsomeone take me home / someone take me out of the dark / I‚Äôm gonna regret this / forever‚ÄùAND AND Hayden‚Äôs voice in the song being drowned out by the instruments‚Ä¶.. idk guys, idk. This is just a theory.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **WNBA Showdown: Las Vegas Aces vs. Phoenix Mercury ‚Äì A Statistical Slapfight with a 1.5-Point Spread**

The Las Vegas Aces (22-14) and Phoenix Mercury (21-13) are set for a bruising battle at Michelob ULTRA Arena, where the Aces‚Äô eight-game winning streak will collide with the Mercury‚Äôs road-trip resilience. Let‚Äôs dissect the numbers, news, and why this game might end with someone needing a stiff drink and a spreadsheet.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Numbers Game

The Aces are the clear favorite, with decimal odds hovering around **1.80** (implied probability ‚âà **55.5%**) across most books, while the Mercury sit at **2.05** (‚âà **48.7%**). The spread is a razor-thin **-1.5 for Las Vegas** and **+1.5 for Phoenix**, reflecting a tightly balanced matchup. The total is locked at **170.5 points**, with even money on Over/Under. This suggests bookmakers expect a defensive tug-of-war‚Äîneither team‚Äôs explosive offense (Mercury‚Äôs 83.6 PPG) nor the Aces‚Äô suffocating defense (9th in the league, 82.6 PPG allowed) will dominate outright.

But here‚Äôs the kicker: The Aces‚Äô **A‚Äôja Wilson** is a human wrecking ball, averaging **22.9 PPG and 10 RPG**, while the Mercury rely on **Satou Sabally‚Äôs 17.1 PPG** and **Alyssa Thomas‚Äô 9 assists**. If Wilson stays hot, the Aces‚Äô offense becomes a freight train; if Sabally silences her, Phoenix might just sneak out a win.

### News Digest: Coffee, Checkmates, and Road Fatigue

The Aces are riding a season-best eight-game streak, fueled by Wilson‚Äôs recent **30-10-5 masterpiece**‚Äîa stat line so dominant, it makes a chess grandmaster look like a toddler with a board game.

Meanwhile, the Mercury are chasing their first winning regular season since 2021. Forward Kahleah Copper‚Äôs ‚Äúbuilding on corrections‚Äù quote sounds inspiring but also slightly concerning‚Äîlike a baker apologizing for burning the cake *again*. Their 3-0 road trip is c

1mwf0vy,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInPicks/comments/1mwf0vy/explore_the_best_coffee_maker_with_the_presto/,Explore the best coffee maker with the Presto 02811 review,"The Presto 02811 Stainless Steel Coffee Maker has been my go-to coffee companion for the past few weeks, and I have to admit, it‚Äôs been quite the game changer. If you love the nostalgic bubbling sound of a classic percolator paired with a touch of modern convenience, this might be just what you‚Äôre looking for. From its polished stainless steel body to its straightforward functionality, there‚Äôs a lot to unpack here ‚Äì and not all of it is perfect.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that struck me about this coffee maker is its elegant design. Sleek, traditional, and made with high-quality stainless steel, it fits perfectly on my countertop and looks timeless. The build feels solid in hand, and I appreciate that even the filter basket and perk tube are made of stainless steel rather than flimsy aluminum. It's not just about the aesthetic here; this material also makes the coffee maker last longer while ensuring that it‚Äôs easy to clean. That said, keeping it fingerprint-free is a constant battle ‚Äì it has that mirror finish that shows every smudge and spot.

**Ease of Use and Brewing Process**  
The brewing process is as simple as you‚Äôd expect from a classic coffee percolator. You fill the water reservoir, add your ground coffee to the reusable filter basket, plug it in, and wait. The Presto 02811 brews at a pace of one cup per minute, maxing out at 12 cups. I usually prep a smaller batch, around 6 cups, and by the time I‚Äôve finished tidying up a bit, it‚Äôs ready. There's a little light at the base that tells you when the coffee is done, which is an understated yet handy feature. One minor gripe: there‚Äôs no water level indicator, so you‚Äôll need to manually measure how much water you‚Äôre adding.

[Check Presto 02811 price on Amazon.](https://newcookware.com/p/b00df5honi/)

**Performance and Flavor**  
If you‚Äôve never had coffee from a percolator before, you‚Äôre in for a treat. This style of brewing tends to extract deeper, more robust flavors, and the Presto delivers on this front. I found that the coffee stayed consistently hot during serving, thanks to its automatic warming feature. However, the percolation process can sometimes over-extract the coffee if you're not careful with the grind size or amount of coffee used. I had to experiment a couple of times to avoid bitterness. When I got it right, though, the flavor was rich and aromatic, perfect for my morning kickstart.

**Maintenance and Cleaning**  
Cleaning this model is relatively hassle-free but not as quick as I‚Äôd like. Since it‚Äôs not immersible, you‚Äôll need to clean it with warm soapy water. The stainless-steel parts, including the perk spout and filter basket, can be cleaned with a brush or pipe cleaner, which is a bit time-consuming. The one time I used coffee stain remover on the interior, it worked well, but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend doing this often ‚Äì it‚Äôs just an extra step.

**Good Points**  
- Durable and polished stainless steel construction  
- Brews up to 12 cups quickly  
- Signal light indicates when coffee's ready  
- Reusable filter basket minimizes waste  

**Critiques**  
- Lack of a water level indicator  
- Can over-extract coffee if not careful  
- Smudge-prone exterior requires frequent wiping  
- Cleaning the perk spout and filter basket is time-consuming  

**Other Options**  
While the Presto 02811 performs well, it does face competition in the percolator category. A popular alternative could be the Cuisinart PRC-12. The Cuisinart offers a modern spin on percolators with its sleek design and additional features like a clear water level indicator and detachable cord for easier serving. However, I found it slightly bulkier and less reminiscent of that nostalgic coffee-percolating charm. Another rival is the Farberware FCP412, which also has a stainless-steel design but leans more compact. Unlike the Presto, many users report that its exterior tends to feel warmer during operation, which could pose a safety concern if you have curious hands (ahem, kids) nearby. 

**Value for Money**  
From a price-to-quality ratio perspective, the Presto stainless steel coffee maker delivers solid value. It‚Äôs not trying to be fancy or loaded with flashy features; instead, it focuses on what it does best ‚Äì brewing flavorful coffee and doing so reliably. Given its capacity to brew anywhere from 2 to 12 cups and automatic keep-warm function, you‚Äôre getting a practical and functional coffee maker without breaking the bank. It might not suit someone looking for advanced programming or tech-like touchscreens, but for traditionalists or anyone nostalgic for that classic brew, it‚Äôs a delightful investment.

What Jesus teaches about Servanthood

Introduction
------------

In a world that often celebrates power and ambition, Jesus offers us a refreshingly different perspective on what it means to lead and live meaningfully. Imagine a life where greatness isn‚Äôt measured by how many serve us, but by how joyfully we serve others. That‚Äôs the revolutionary message of servanthood that Jesus shared, inviting us to find purpose through humble service.

Consider the freedom and fulfillment that come from living as a servant of all. This isn‚Äôt about diminishing your potential or importance; it‚Äôs about embracing a calling that is deeply rewarding and eternally impactful. You‚Äôll discover that servanthood transforms not only the lives you touch but your own heart as well.

Bible Verse
-----------

‚ÄúFor even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.‚Äù ‚Äî Mark 10:45 (NIV)

Meaning
-------

The verse from Mark 10:45 reveals the depth of Jesus‚Äô servant heart. He, who holds the universe in His hands, chose to stoop down, wash feet, heal the hurting, and ultimately lay down His life for humanity. His example teaches us that true greatness is found in the willingness to serve others selflessly.

Servanthood is about letting go of selfish desires and embracing humility. Jesus flips the world‚Äôs hierarchy upside down by showing that the last shall be first. His life demonstrates that acts of service, however small, are powerful and echo into eternity.

When we serve, we are actively participating in God‚Äôs work on earth. Serving others not only blesses them, but it also enriches our spiritual walk, creates community, and reflects God‚Äôs love to a world in need.

Each action of servanthood is a step closer to experiencing the abundant life Jesus promised. Our service becomes an offering of love and gratitude, aligning our hearts with God‚Äôs perfect will.

Actions to Take
---------------

‚Äì Identify a person in need and offer your time or resources to help them this week.

‚Äì Practice active listening by giving someone your undivided attention.

‚Äì Volunteer at a local shelter or nonprofit organization.

‚Äì Cultivate a habit of daily prayers for opportunities to serve.

‚Äì Perform a random act of kindness, such as paying for someone‚Äôs coffee.

Journal Prompts
---------------

‚Äì Reflect on a time you witnessed servanthood in action. How did it affect you?

‚Äì What are some areas in your life where you can practice more selflessness?

‚Äì How does serving others bring you closer to understanding God‚Äôs love?

‚Äì What personal barriers do you need to overcome to become a better servant?

‚Äì Write about a person who has served you and the impact it had on your life.

Prayer
------

Dear Jesus,

Thank You for teaching me the true meaning of greatness through Your example of servanthood. Help me to let go of my selfish ambitions and embrace a heart of humility and service. Open my eyes to opportunities to serve others and fill me with Your love so that I may serve joyfully and wholeheartedly. I want my life to be a reflection of Your love and grace.

Amen.

1mwez1n,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1mwez1n/i_accidentally_sent_the_wrong_email_at_work_and/,I accidentally sent the wrong email at work‚Ä¶ and it changed my entire career path.,"This happened about a year ago, and it still feels surreal when I think about it.

For context, I (27M) was working as a junior analyst in a mid-sized tech company. The kind of place where half the culture revolved around Slack emojis and ‚Äúcircling back‚Äù on things nobody actually wanted to do. I was ambitious but not exactly confident, I mostly kept my head down, triple-checked spreadsheets, and hoped nobody noticed if I stayed late.

One Monday morning, I was running on two hours of sleep (thank you, Netflix binge), and I had to send a quick status update to my manager. Nothing big, just the usual ‚Äúnumbers are on track, I‚Äôll update later today.‚Äù

But in my half-delirious state, my brain short-circuited. Instead of typing:

>

‚Ä¶I somehow sent this to the **entire department mailing list**:

>

The moment I hit send, I didn‚Äôt even notice. I was sipping cold coffee, thinking about lunch, when Slack absolutely *exploded*. People I barely knew were DMing me ‚ÄúWait, what?!‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhere are you going?!‚Äù The intern actually brought me a cookie like it was my farewell gift.

By the time I realized my mistake, the VP of Operations had already emailed me: *‚ÄúLet‚Äôs meet later today to discuss your transition.‚Äù*

I wanted to crawl under my desk and live there forever.

I sprinted to my manager‚Äôs office, ready to grovel. But instead of being furious, he was practically wheezing with laughter. He showed me the email chain where executives were already speculating why I was leaving. Someone even guessed I‚Äôd been poached by a competitor.

Here‚Äôs where things took a turn I never expected:

Instead of firing me for incompetence, the VP called me into his office and said, ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre thinking about leaving, let‚Äôs talk about what it would take to keep you.‚Äù

I panicked and told the truth, that it was a typo, and I wasn‚Äôt planning on going anywhere. He just smiled and said, ‚ÄúThen take this as an opportunity. What do you *want* from your role here?‚Äù

Nobody had ever asked me that before. I‚Äôd always been too afraid to admit I wanted more responsibility, more challenging projects, and honestly‚Ä¶ more pay. But because I thought I was seconds away from being unemployed, I just blurted everything out.

To my absolute shock, he agreed. Within a month, I was promoted to a role I‚Äôd never even dreamed of asking for.

All because of one accidental sentence.

Now, whenever new hires join, someone inevitably tells the ‚Äúlegend of the accidental resignation.‚Äù My coworkers even gave me a nickname: *The Accidental Negotiator.* It‚Äôs funny, but it also taught me something important, sometimes the mistakes we fear most are the ones that break us out of our own limitations.

If that typo hadn‚Äôt happened, I‚Äôd probably still be quietly grinding away in a cubicle, too nervous to ask for what I deserved.

**TL;DR:** I accidentally emailed my entire company saying I was resigning. Instead of firing me, leadership asked what it would take to keep me. I was honest, and they promoted me. One typo changed my whole career.",3,1755791870.0,story,2,1.0,False

After researching a bit, I got my strategy down, I was hoping people here could offer me advice on things I can improve on and give answers to some questions I ask. Right now I only have a Monzo account so I‚Äôm starting from scratch, take it easy on meüíî

‚Äî‚ÄîCARD‚Äôs‚Äî‚Äî

Payday Account: 

Monzo. I already have it and apparently the pots feature can be useful to allocate money every month automatically to different places my money ends up. (Also early payday which is cool I guess). Should I be keeping my emergency fund in a Monzo pot, or is there somewhere better to keep it?

Cashback debit card:

Chase. 1% cash back on fuels and groceries which is neat. I was thinking between this and t212 debit, but I think I prefer Chase being an actual bank and they have higher cashback rate compared to t212. (But t212 has cashback on all spending) is this the right decision ???!?

Credit card:

Tesco credit builder. I‚Äôm a bit hesitant on getting a credit card because I‚Äôm young and might be tempted to spend recklessly and interest payments r scary. But I think I will just buy something small like a subscription every month and build credit so I can move up to a rewards card or smt maybe in year 2-3 of my apprenticeship. I think this is a smart thing to do. 

‚Äî‚ÄîISA‚Äôs‚Äî‚Äî

I plan to open a:
-Moneybox LISA (for house)
-t212 Stocks and Shares ISA (for long term investment)

Could someone explain briefly the different between HYSA and cash ISA? I get its tax free interest with the cash ISA, but is it worth it when I won‚Äôt be earning anywhere close to 50k, so won‚Äôt be saving as much and not surpassing ¬£1k tax free saving? I think I‚Äôm misunderstanding this whole thing.

‚Äî‚ÄîStrategy/Routine‚Äî‚Äî

I live at home with my parents so no rent luckily. My plan is to FIRE but I need to get all this in check before I can start thinking too far ahead.

Monthly income (after tax): ¬£2160

Needs (20%): ¬£432 - Fuel, Car insurance, groceries, contacts.
Wants (30%): ¬£648 - Miscellaneous stuff + credit card building
Invest (50%): ¬£1080 - ISA‚Äôs 

These numbers will probably change as I start and realise I‚Äôm investing too much and need more for my needs (or maybe I need less needs and more investing who knows) 

Fuel and grocery money sent to Chase for cash-back. The rest direct debit stuff.

Pay off monthly credit card purchase (probably gym membership and coffees), and the rest for miscellaneous spending. Save for a holiday or smt with left over money every month. 

For the first few months build up an emergency fund as well and then after, channel money back into maxing out LISA and into S+S ISA. 

So that‚Äôs about it, I might be sounding naive with my plans and whatnot, but I just wanted to know if I‚Äôm going down the right path. Any help would be super appreciated, I really want to get this whole personal l finance thing understood before I start. IF ANYTHING CAN BE CHANGED OR QUESTIONED PLEASE DO LET ME KNOW AND ASK.

1mwewou,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mwewou,"Review for Java Rage Coffee, a newly opened caf√© in Jawahar Nagar","Found a new caf√©; Java Rage Coffee, in Jawahar NagaoutLooked small, so I wasn‚Äôt expecting much, but the menu surprised me. They had cranberry cold brew, coconut iced latte, tonic espresso etc. all for 100-130. Food was nominally priced too, around 100 for a sandwich with 4 pieces.

Instead of a quick stop, I ended up ordering 4 drinks (one takeaway for mom) and 2 appetizers (in my defence, I had company and this was not a solo order haha). Bill was 662. Appetizers were okay (nachos plain, paneer sandwich filling), but the drinks were amazing. Had ordered coconut iced latte, cold brew tonic, hazelnut frappe, and Belgian hot chocolate, and all hit the spot. 

One small thing I noticed was the menu had a few typos. Didn‚Äôt really matter for ordering. I figured the owner might have had limited resources while setting it up (maybe they had a minor disability too, didn't really effect the service in anyway but yeah an observation), and since he seemed pretty amiable I didn‚Äôt want to nitpick on my first visit. Maybe next time I can just offer a quick proofreading to help out (Yes I overthinked and am an introvert when it comes to criticism ;-;). Also you'd notice a Virat Kolhi's picture in the menu, that's because they use Rage Coffee beans. I have had a bad experience with Rage flavoured instant coffee, but the bean taste was actually nice. 

The time I visited only owner was there, I don't know if they have workers for other time of day, had a good conversation (he is an ex Crazy Coffee branch's manager). Service takes time but you can ask to prioritize items. They even gave me the leftover Schweppes bottle for the tonic brew to adjust myself. 

Checked Zomato later and prices were exactly the same online, which is rare. For me, it‚Äôs not at Curious Coffee level, but easily second best in the city and unbeatable for the price.

TL;DR: Java Rage Coffee, new caf√© in Jawahar Nagar. Great specialty coffees at 100-130, decent food, super affordable overall. Maybe a solo-run so service takes time (10-15 minutes), but worth it. Second best coffee I‚Äôve had in the city, and best value.

1mwev1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/SandalsResorts/comments/1mwev1a/royal_bahamian_resort_review_7night_stay_island/,Royal Bahamian Resort Review: 7-Night Stay | Island Village Walkout Butler Villa w/ Private Pool (VPS) | 08/03‚Äì08/10,"First time at this property, though we‚Äôre no strangers to Sandals with 133 paid nights (all in Butler-level rooms) and a considerable spend behind us. I‚Äôll admit, parts of this review might come off a bit nitpicky, but it‚Äôs all in the spirit of giving an honest take.

Arrival & Check-In:

The Sandals arrival lounge at the airport is underwhelming. Small space, minimal seating, and only bottled water offered. We waited about 25 minutes for our private transfer, which was a smooth ~15 minute ride to the resort.

Check-in at the Club/Butler lounge was efficient. Initially, we were told our preferred Butler team wasn‚Äôt available, but after pushing back a bit, the request was accommodated. Room wasn‚Äôt ready (we arrived early), so we grabbed snacks from the Conch Truck and beers at the bar. Our Butler met us there about an hour later and had us in the room by 2pm, before official check-in time.


Room (VPS - Island Village Walkout Butler w/ Private Pool):

The suite was more spacious than expected based on online photos. It was nicely cooled upon arrival, thanks to our pre-arrival Butler Preference form. Two independent AC units, one in the bedroom, one in the bathroom kept things very comfortable throughout the week.

* Bed was a bit soft for our taste, but still comfortable.

* Couch and armchair were fine.

* Missing a drying rack and a proper table for in-room dining (the latter felt like an odd oversight), but the drying rack was delivered within hours of our request.

* Bathroom was a good size with a large shower, but the water closet was very tight and felt claustrophobic.

* The outdoor space and private plunge pool were easily a highlight. Secluded, quiet, and larger than we anticipated. Pool wasn‚Äôt heated (not a problem with 90¬∞F daytime temps) but wasn‚Äôt cleaned all week and by day six or seven, it had accumulated a fair number of dead bugs. Disappointing, given the price point and expectations.


Butler Service:

We had Dominique and Logesh and they were absolutely fantastic. Attentive, professional, intuitive, and responsive. Always secured us great beach spots, handled last minute restaurant changes with ease, and genuinely elevated the trip. Total standouts.


Resort Service:

Contrary to some of the mixed reviews I‚Äôd read before arriving, we found the overall service surprisingly strong. Nearly every staff member, regardless of role, was friendly and welcoming. Bartenders, servers, housekeeping‚Ä¶no one seemed annoyed by requests, and service was consistently prompt. This was a refreshing surprise.


Food:

Unfortunately, the food was one of the biggest letdowns.

* Breakfast & lunch were repetitive and fairly average.

* The breakfast buffet at Kanoo was particularly bad, well below what we‚Äôve experienced at other Sandals properties, and not what you‚Äôd expect at this price tier.

* Dinner quality was generally okay, but the menus felt repetitive and uninspired. Meals often felt rushed.


Beach:

The beach was another weak point.

While chairs were spaced nicely and the beach area was quiet, the actual beach and swimming areas are small. The view is obstructed, on one side is Gordon‚Äôs pier, the other is the wedding chapel, with a rock jetty in between. Not exactly the idyllic, wide open Caribbean view.

Seaweed (not sargassum) was consistently present in the water, and when it washed ashore, no one seemed in a hurry to clean it up. Cocktail service on the beach was almost nonexistent. In seven days, we saw a server once. She handed out a few not great drinks and never returned.


Additional Notes:

* Dress Code: Glad to see Sandals dropped the outdated requirement for men to wear long pants at certain restaurants at this property. Hopefully, this rolls out brand wide.

* Evening Entertainment: We‚Äôre not big entertainment people, but even by our standards, the nighttime vibe was very quiet.

* Coffee/Cafe: We‚Äôre fans of the newer coffee bar setups at other Sandals properties (Dunn‚Äôs River, Negril, Royal Barbados), but the Sweets N Tings truck here felt like an afterthought. No posted menu, and when asking for iced espresso, we‚Äôd often get a lukewarm iced coffee.

* Dine Out Program: If you qualify, take full advantage. We dined at Sapodilla and it was phenomenal. Amazing food, top tier service, and the tableside Caesar and banana flamb√© were great touches.


Final Thoughts:

We did enjoy the trip and are even considering rebooking the same suite for June 2026. However, at $12,306/week, the value proposition just isn‚Äôt lining up anymore. Sandals 2.0 pricing feels increasingly out of step with what‚Äôs actually being delivered, especially when competitors are offering an extremely similar product 50% less.

1mweunf,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1mweunf/hr_the_network/,[HR] The Network,"We'd been hiking for three hours when Jake admitted we were lost.

""Lost?"" Sarah's voice pitched higher. ""What do you mean lost? You said you knew these trails like the back of your hand.""

""I do!"" Jake held up his phone, squinting at the blank screen. ""Or I did. This isn't right. The GPS just shows static, and I swear this creek wasn't here yesterday.""

I looked around at the towering Douglas firs that seemed to press closer than they had an hour ago. The forest felt different here‚Äîolder somehow, with an earthy sweetness in the air that made my sinuses tingle. ""Maybe we should head back,"" I suggested.

""Back where?"" Mike gestured behind us. ""The trail split into three paths about a mile ago, and I'm pretty sure none of them were there when we came through.""

That's when we first felt it. That prickle between your shoulder blades, like someone watching from the treeline. We all turned at once, scanning the moss-draped undergrowth, but saw nothing except shadows that seemed to shift when we weren't looking directly at them.

""Okay, this is getting weird,"" Sarah muttered, shouldering her pack. ""Let's just pick a direction and‚Äî""

The ground beneath our feet gave a soft, almost imperceptible pulse.

We froze. Jake knelt down and pressed his palm to the forest floor. ""Did you guys feel that?""

Another pulse, gentler than a heartbeat but unmistakably rhythmic.

""What the hell..."" Mike started, but his words died as something emerged from between two ancient cedars.

It wasn't walking so much as flowing‚Äîa gnarled mass of fungal growth about eight feet tall, covered in caps and brackets of every size and color. Tendrils of mycelium trailed from its base like root systems made visible, connecting it to every tree, every fallen log, every patch of decomposing matter around us. Where it moved, the ground seemed to breathe.

We should have run. Every instinct screamed at us to run. But there was something almost... polite about the way it approached. Like it was giving us time to process what we were seeing.

When it spoke, the voice came from everywhere at once‚Äîfrom the soil beneath our feet, from the bark of the trees, from the very air we breathed. A low, resonant sound like wind through underground caverns.

""Oh, for spore's sake,"" it said, and I swear there was exasperation in that alien voice. ""More of you. Perfect. Just perfect.""

Sarah grabbed my arm so hard I winced. ""Did... did it just complain about us?""

""Look,"" the entity continued, its fungal mass shifting and reforming as tendrils reached out to touch nearby trees, ""I don't want to do this. I really don't. I was having a perfectly lovely several-thousand-year decomposition cycle, managing carbon sequestration, maintaining soil chemistry, keeping the whole ecosystem running smoothly. But then you people had to go and wake me up.""

Jake found his voice first. ""Wake you up? We were just hiking‚Äî""

""Hiking,"" the creature repeated flatly. ""Right. After clear-cutting twelve thousand acres of my body last spring. After pumping enough chemicals into my root system to kill a blue whale. After fragmenting my network with your roads and developments until I can barely maintain consciousness across three counties."" It paused, and I swear I heard it sigh‚Äîa sound like wind through hollow logs. ""Do you have any idea how irritating it is to be jerked out of a perfectly good millennium-long nap?""

Mike stepped forward, hands raised peacefully. ""Hey, we're not the ones doing the logging. We're just campers. We actually care about the environment‚Äî""

""Oh, you CARE,"" the entity interrupted, and suddenly mushrooms were sprouting from the ground around Mike's feet. ""How wonderful. You replant trees, don't you? Nice neat little rows of Douglas fir saplings, all the same age, all the same species. Like putting band-aids on a severed artery.""

""But that's good, right?"" Sarah said desperately. ""Reforestation programs, carbon offsetting‚Äî""

""You replant babies,"" the thing said, its voice growing deeper, more resonant. ""I need OLD growth. Centuries-old root systems. Established mycelial networks that took me millennia to cultivate. Your little saplings are like... like replacing a symphony orchestra with a child's kazoo.""

As it spoke, I noticed the forest around us had changed. The trees seemed closer, their trunks bulging with strange growths. Shelf fungi had appeared on every surface, glowing faintly with bioluminescent patterns that pulsed in rhythm with that underground heartbeat. The air grew thick with spores that made everything look hazy and dreamlike.

""This is insane,"" Jake whispered. ""We're talking to a mushroom.""

""Fungus,"" the entity corrected sharply. ""And I'm not A fungus. I AM the fungus. Every decomposing log from here to the Cascade Range. Every soil microbe in a fifty-mile radius. Every root hair on every tree in this forest. I am the wood wide web, and you've been stomping around on my neurons like toddlers in a library.""

The fungal palace had been growing around us the entire time, I realized with mounting horror. What had looked like natural forest formations were actually carefully constructed walls of living wood and stone, held together by thick cables of mycelium. Glowing mushrooms dotted the surfaces like windows, and the ceiling‚Äîwhen had there become a ceiling?‚Äîwas a twisted canopy of branches that filtered the light into strange, shifting patterns.

We were trapped.

""Now,"" the entity continued, settling into what might have been a throne made of a massive old-growth stump, ""we need to discuss your species' ongoing ecological vandalism. And why I'm going to have to start taking more... direct action.""

The walls pulsed with that rhythmic breathing, and I could feel the network's attention focused on us like the weight of a mountain. Somewhere in the distance, I heard the sound of trees falling‚Äînot cut down, but uprooted, walking on their root systems like massive wooden spiders.

""This is really going to mess up my pH balance,"" the entity muttered. ""I hate when I have to get involved in surface politics.""

Sarah was hyperventilating. Mike was backing toward what used to be the way we came in, now blocked by a wall of solid fungal matter. Jake was taking pictures with his phone, apparently having moved past terror into documentation mode.

And me? I was starting to understand that we weren't just lost hikers who'd stumbled into something strange.

We were evidence. Witnesses to the moment when the largest living organism on Earth decided it was tired of playing nice with humanity.

""So,"" the entity said, its voice now coming from the walls themselves, ""let's talk about carbon credits, shall we? Because I have some thoughts on your species' math skills...""

The palace walls grew thicker, the ceiling lower, and somewhere in the darkness beyond, I could hear the sound of an ancient intelligence beginning to take a more active interest in the world above ground.

This was going to be a very long conversation.

""This is really going to mess up my pH balance,"" the entity muttered. ""I hate when I have to get involved in surface politics.""

Sarah was hyperventilating. Mike was backing toward what used to be the way we came in, now blocked by a wall of solid fungal matter. Jake was taking pictures with his phone, apparently having moved past terror into documentation mode.

And me? I was starting to understand that we weren't just lost hikers who'd stumbled into something strange.

We were evidence. Witnesses to the moment when the largest living organism on Earth decided it was tired of playing nice with humanity.

""So,"" the entity said, its voice now coming from the walls themselves, ""let's talk about carbon credits, shall we? Because I have some thoughts on your species' math skills...""

The palace walls grew thicker, the ceiling lower, and somewhere in the darkness beyond, I could hear the sound of an ancient intelligence beginning to take a more active interest in the world above ground.

This was going to be a very long conversation.

---

The conversation lasted hours. Or maybe minutes. Time seemed to flow differently in the fungal palace, thick and syrupy like the spore-laden air we were breathing. The entity lectured us about soil chemistry, mycorrhizal networks, and the ""catastrophic incompetence"" of human forest management with the patience of something that had literally all the time in the world.

""Your paper industry,"" it droned, caps and brackets shifting across its surface like a living slideshow, ""removes approximately 400 million tons of carbon from my network annually. Do you know what I have to do to rebalance that? Do you have any idea of the metabolic gymnastics involved?""

Sarah had stopped listening around the two-hour mark, when the walls had sprouted thousands of tiny mushrooms that tracked our movement like eyes. She was systematically testing every surface for weakness, pressing against the fungal barriers with increasing desperation.

Mike had tried reasoning with it again. ""But we're working on sustainable forestry practices‚Äî""

""SUSTAINABLE,"" the entity had boomed, causing every mushroom in the palace to flare with angry bioluminescence. ""You've been 'working on' sustainable practices for fifty years! I've watched your progress. It's like watching geological erosion, except slower and more frustrating.""

That's when the real torment began.

The walls started secreting a sticky resin that smelled like rotting flowers. Tendrils emerged from the floor to wrap around our ankles‚Äînot tight enough to truly hurt, but just enough to remind us we weren't going anywhere. The ceiling lowered inch by inch, forcing us to crouch, then eventually sit.

""I don't enjoy this,"" the entity said, though its actions suggested otherwise. ""But I need you to understand the scope of the problem. Every tree you cut sends shock waves through my nervous system. Every chemical you dump burns like acid. Every road you build is like having a limb amputated.""

Jake's phone had died hours ago, but he kept clicking it obsessively. ""This is insane. We're going to die here, aren't we?""

""Die?"" The entity sounded genuinely puzzled. ""Why would you die? I'm trying to educate you. Though I admit my teaching methods might need work. It's been a while since I've had to communicate with mammals.""

The walls pulsed, and suddenly we were watching images play out across the fungal surfaces‚Äîforests being clear-cut, streams polluted with runoff, entire mountainsides scraped bare. But from the network's perspective, it looked like watching someone slowly flay your skin off.

""See?"" it said. ""This is what progress looks like from down here. Very educational, don't you think?""

Sarah finally snapped. ""ENOUGH!"" She grabbed a handful of the glowing mushrooms from the wall and yanked, hard.

The entity shrieked‚Äîa sound like a thousand trees falling at once. The entire palace shuddered, cracks appearing in the fungal walls. More importantly, where Sarah had pulled the mushrooms away, actual daylight streamed in.

""That... that actually hurt,"" the entity said, sounding surprised.

Mike caught on first. He started tearing at the tendrils around his feet, ripping them away in chunks. Each piece he removed made the whole structure weaker, more unstable.

""Wait, stop‚Äî"" the entity protested, but we were already moving, pulling and tearing at anything we could reach. Jake found a section where the wall was mostly hollow, just a thin membrane of mycelium, and punched straight through.

""You're damaging my infrastructure!"" the entity wailed, but its voice was already growing fainter as we destroyed the connections that let it maintain the palace.

We ran. Through the hole Jake had made, stumbling over roots and fallen logs, crashing through underbrush as the forest behind us groaned and shifted. Trees were definitely moving now‚ÄîI could hear their roots pulling free of the soil with wet, sucking sounds.

But we were faster. Lighter. And apparently, more desperate than an ancient fungal network that had gotten too comfortable with its omnipresence.

We didn't stop running until we hit the parking lot where we'd left Jake's truck. Real asphalt, real yellow parking lines, real world. Sarah collapsed against the truck's bumper, gasping.

""Keys,"" she panted. ""Jake, keys, now.""

He fumbled them out, hands shaking so badly he dropped them twice. The engine turned over on the third try, and we were speeding down the mountain road before any of us spoke again.

It wasn't until we were twenty miles away, sitting in a diner in town ordering coffee with hands that wouldn't stop shaking, that Mike said it.

""You know what's really messed up?"" He stirred sugar into his coffee with mechanical precision. ""I think it could have done that at any point. Trapped us, I mean. Built that palace around us.""

We all looked at him.

""Think about it,"" he continued. ""That thing spans thousands of acres. Controls the entire forest ecosystem. If it wanted to trap us from the beginning, we never would have made it ten feet into those woods.""

Sarah set down her cup carefully. ""What are you saying?""

""I'm saying it chose to talk first. It built that prison while we were having a conversation because it wanted us to understand first. It was trying to..."" He paused, looking for the right word. ""Educate us. Like it said.""

Jake stared out the diner window at the forest-covered mountains in the distance. ""So what happens when it decides talking isn't enough?""

None of us had an answer for that.

But three weeks later, when the news reported that logging operations across the Pacific Northwest had been shut down due to ""unprecedented equipment failures"" and ""unexplained worker illnesses,"" we knew the conversation was over.

The network was done being polite.

1mwess2,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedAndTested/comments/1mwess2/explore_best_coffee_maker_technivorm_moccamaster/,Explore Best Coffee Maker Technivorm Moccamaster Worth the Hype,"Testing the Technivorm Moccamaster 79112 KBT Coffee Brewer has become a daily ritual in my quest for the perfect cup of coffee. As someone who values efficiency without sacrificing quality, I found this drip coffee machine to be an intriguing mix of functionality, design, and practicality. From the moment I pulled it out of the box, its polished silver finish and modern aesthetic caught my eye. It's compact but tall, standing at 15.25 inches, which fit snugly under my kitchen cabinets. But beyond appearances, I was curious whether it could live up to its reputation as a top coffee maker among enthusiasts.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This product screams elegance and durability. The polished silver finish gives it a sleek appearance that blends seamlessly with contemporary kitchen setups. Its design isn't just about aesthetics; it's practical too. The stainless steel thermal carafe, weighing in at 6.5 pounds, feels solid in your hands and is clearly built for longevity. I liked that the carafe comes with a travel lid, which I tested by taking coffee on a family road trip‚Äîsurprisingly, it maintained the temperature exceptionally well for over an hour. The removable parts, such as the water reservoir lid and brew basket, make cleaning straightforward, while the handmade craftsmanship from the Netherlands shines in every detail.

**Performance and Brew Quality**  
One of the standout features of this coffee brewer is its pre-immersion drip-style system, designed to achieve an ideal coffee bloom. I tested it with both fine and medium grinds of my favorite beans, and I was pleasantly surprised. The ultra-precise pulse action created a rich, aromatic brew that filled my kitchen with the scent of freshly brewed coffee. The manual-adjust drip-stop brew basket allowed me to control the coffee flow rate into the carafe, which came in handy when I wanted to fine-tune the flavor intensity. This machine brews a full 40-ounce pot in roughly 6 minutes, living up to its promise of quick yet consistent brewing.

**Positives**  
- **Ease of Use**: Operating this coffee maker couldn't be simpler. A single button starts the brewing process, making it ideal for hectic mornings.  
- **Customization Options**: The manual-adjust brew basket offers flexibility, catering to different preferences.  
- **Thermal Carafe Performance**: Coffee stays hot longer compared to many glass carafe models, which is great for those who sip their coffee slowly.  
- **Durable Construction**: With its stainless steel and high-quality plastic materials, this machine feels like it's built to last.

**Challenges of Using This Coffee Maker**  
While the product ticks many boxes, it‚Äôs not without its imperfections. Firstly, it doesn't include an automatic shut-off feature, which can be a downside for some. I often found myself wondering whether I remembered to turn it off after rushing out the door. Another limitation is its lack of programmability. If you're someone who relies on scheduling the brewing cycle before waking up, this manual-operation-only machine might feel inconvenient. I also found that the thermal carafe, though excellent at retaining heat, can be a bit tricky to pour from without a slow and deliberate tilt.

**Areas for Improvement**  
- No auto shut-off feature, which could enhance safety and convenience.  
- Lack of programmability for brewing ahead of time.  
- The carafe, while effective, has a small learning curve for its pouring mechanism.  

**Competing Options**  
In the world of premium coffee makers, the Technivorm Moccamaster faces strong competition. Machines like the Breville Precision Brewer offer programmable brewing cycles, which may appeal to tech-savvy users. Similarly, the Bonavita Connoisseur offers a comparable pre-infusion feature at a potentially lower price point. However, neither seems to match the Moccamaster‚Äôs manual drip-stop control or the craftsmanship of its handmade construction. Where this product shines is in its simple, no-fuss operation, making it a favorite for those who prioritize brewing quality over excessive automation.

**Worth the Investment**  
One thing that stood out as I continued using this coffee maker was its timeless performance. Though it lacks high-tech features like smartphone connectivity or touchscreens, the quality of coffee it produces justifies its cost. The five-year warranty also adds a layer of assurance that you‚Äôre getting long-term value. Admittedly, it might not be the most budget-friendly option up front, but considering the durable design, ease of maintenance, and consistently great coffee, it feels like smart spending to me.

It's called Genspark AI Designer.

The idea: What if you could have an AI employee that handles all your design needs? Not just logos, but complete brand systems, store layouts, packaging, websites, marketing materials ‚Äî everything.

We decided to test it by building a fake coffee brand called ""Meadow"".

Minutes later, we had:

\- Complete logo and brand identity¬†

\- Store exterior and interior design concepts¬†

\- Product packaging entire product line

\- Marketing posters and menu designs

\- Website mockups and social media templates¬†

This is the kind of work that used to cost $15K+ and take weeks of back-and-forth with designers.

The bigger picture: We're not trying to replace human creativity. We're trying to remove the barriers that stop people from building their ideas. Most entrepreneurs I know have amazing visions but get stuck on execution costs.

Try it today: [https://www.genspark.ai/ai\_designer](https://www.genspark.ai/ai_designer)

I'm 37 and from the US but ethnically east Asian.

One turned out to be a bar girl but the others were just normal, we got coffee and hung out basically.

I also live in an area that has a high Vietnamese immigrant population (probably the highest in the US).  I generally date asian and white, and most women I match are less than 10 years younger than me.  But pretty much the only ones I've matched who are <26 years old are Vietnamese who had moved to the US around high school age.  Last night I even got flowers on Hinge (a dating app) from a 24 year old, which prompted me to make this post, because not only is it weird for me to get flowers (I mean come on lol) but her profile also states that shes financially independent and doesn't care about finances.

Speaking of which, yea I can understand if women are looking for someone older for financial reasons, but I will say that for none of these dates did I spend a lot of money.  It's all just simple things like getting a drink, walking around, eating a regular restaurant etc.

I‚Äôm stuck doing a lot of the thinking myself, breaking down patterns, spotting trends, figuring out where I can cut back, etc. It feels like I‚Äôm just staring at charts and transaction lists instead of getting real insights.

Meanwhile, competitor apps like Copilot are already leaning into AI pretty hard. They‚Äôre surfacing spending patterns automatically, giving proactive nudges, and even answering ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù style questions.

That‚Äôs basically a couple cups of coffee for an AI-powered budgeting brain that does the heavy lifting for you.

So my question is: why hasn‚Äôt Quicken integrated AI into Simplifi yet? They‚Äôve got the resources and a loyal customer base, but the platform feels stagnant in this area.

Current stats: 5‚Äô8, 188lbs.
Goal Weight: 175lbs

For context, in 2020 i weighed in at my heaviest at 210lbs. I did a keto diet during covid, coupled with running and dropped down to 180. In 2022 I graduated college, started a new job, and had TONS of stress and dropped down to 160 (did not like being this weight, felt very unhealthy - likely because it was not a positive weight loss journey). Since then, weight has been steadily ticking back up despite increasing my cardio and eating mostly clean. 

My typical weekly workout schedule is as follows: M: 5k progression run, T: 5k interval run, W: easy 5k run, Th: rest day, F: 5-7mi long run, S: 5k easy run, N: rest day. 

Typical meals I eat are: grilled chicken and mixed veggies, grilled chicken fajitas, grilled salmon, protein pasta & turkey meatballs, Lunchmeat (for quick work lunches), occasional steak and asparagus. I generally avoid bread, although I do make sourdough and enjoy a slice every so often‚Ä¶ eating out wise, the most frequent places I go are chipotle (salad w chicken) or Corelife (poke bowl). I am not a snacker. I do not drink soda or juice, but I do have a cup or coffee with creamer every morning. 

I know that cardio is not the end all be all. Diet / lifting are also important. I have lifted on and off, but with my work it is hard to dedicate that block of time - I‚Äôll look into getting a home gym ‚Ä¶

BUT in the meantime does anyone have suggestions that might jumpstart the weight loss process? I‚Äôve been feeling so defeated because even with the increase in exercise, daily steps, and monitoring food intake I haven‚Äôt seen any results. ",2,1755791004.0,loseit,3,1.0,False

Thank you to everyone. 

Thank you so much. I am not saying that sharing my story here is the right thing to do, but writing about my marriage struggles has helped me feel lighter, especially when I keep doubting my decisions.

The problems in my marriage began with repeated betrayals. My husband went to prostitutes several times. Despite this, I gave him chances and tried hard to save our marriage. His efforts were always temporary, and eventually he went back to the same behavior.

At one point, his ex reported him to the police for domestic violence. I stood by him during that time. I found him a lawyer, helped pay for it, and even testified in court on his behalf. My parents supported him fully and never judged him.

Our communication has always been poor. He never valued my opinions. Every decision about the house, furniture, groceries, or even where we went was always his choice. Because he was often silent, I thought he might be stressed about money or our future.

I worked throughout the marriage to help him. With my IT background, I worked from home while caring for our toddler. A year ago, I took on two jobs: a full-time role as an IT business analyst and a part-time role in digital marketing for three to four hours a day. My routine was exhausting. I finished my job at 5 pm, cooked dinner, bathed my toddler, put him to sleep, and then worked my second job until one or two in the morning.

During this time, he began spending recklessly, buying new furniture, a new TV, a new dining table, and more. At the end of each month, he came to me with four to five thousand dollars in credit card debt. I helped him pay it back even though he never allowed me to manage our finances or gave me money to save. He even suggested I take on extra freelance jobs, despite already working two.

With all the weight I carried, I eventually asked for emotional support. I told him directly what I needed, but he dismissed me and said he was busy with his hobbies. Most of the time, he was on his phone. I often caught him watching pornography and then going to the bathroom afterward.

I still tried to be a good wife. I dressed nicely, prepared his coffee in the morning, cooked every day, cleaned, and cared for our toddler. Whenever I said I felt disrespected, he would reply, ‚ÄúWhy do I need to respect you? Don‚Äôt you get respect from others?‚Äù

He vaped in our bedroom with our toddler present, and when I asked him to do it outside, he said, ‚ÄúOkay then I will just sleep outside.‚Äù I tried to be his friend, even joining him for drinks although I was not used to it.

One month ago, I felt too overwhelmed and suggested we seek professional counseling. He said, ‚ÄúI would rather put myself in a mental hospital than take responsibility. Counseling is useless and a waste of money.‚Äù

When I told him I could not go on, he listed everything he had done for us and demanded I return his money. He asked me to transfer the car to his name and said, ‚ÄúIf you want respect, go find it somewhere else.‚Äù

That was the breaking point. I left with nothing but my son and my job, leaving everything else with him.

Thank you again. Reading your comments has been a relief. They remind me that I should not doubt myself. For those who think I am wrong, I accept your view, but I am still grateful. Sharing here helps me not feel so alone.",12,1755790822.0,Marriage,4,0.93,False

1mwefvr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mwefvr,Crumb shot.,"Made a 3 layer mini chocolate cake for a friend's birthday, using 3x10cm pans.

Chocolate cake recipe is my family recipe, the chocolate ganache is from Yotam Ottolenghi's Sweet, and the chocolate cream cheese frosting is from Sally. 

He sent me the second pic, but was a little too enthusiastic about eating it, so the ganache hadn't quite gotten up to room temperature yet. I had the cake in the fridge because my kitchen is hot.

3rd pic is the fourth layer I baked as a tester to make sure the bake was good. Cat tax included.

This is a very moist and heavy chocolate cake - the best kind - and I halved my recipe for this mini layer cake. This is a cake that can very easily be too dense if I just so much as look at it wrong, so I erred on the side of caution and reduced the buttermilk and coffee by a tad while upping the flour a bit. No idea by how much, this was an eyeball type of situation as I know what the batter should look like. I might end up tweaking the recipe for the normal sized cake as well, but that's for another day. 

Decorating is not my strong suit, but the cake was delicious.

The coffee flavour presents itself mildly without overpowering the taste buds. It's also subtly sweet, and that creaminess from the milk really balances the overall taste.

Was better than expected and I think the concept is pretty cool, having a caffeinated beverage together with protein as one. 

It may appeal to folks who consume both regularly including myself, but I still prefer them separately, and since I'm not a huge fan of lattes in general, it's not something I'd often buy.

# Case Study: How SpectrumBPO Helped 200+ Brands Within 6 Months



The e-commerce landscape is a battlefield, and for many brands, the fight for visibility and sales is a constant struggle. In a highly competitive market, the right strategy can make all the difference. This case study highlights how **SpectrumBPO**, an **e-commerce growth agency in Richardson**, leveraged its expertise to help over **200 brands** achieve significant growth in just six months.

**The Challenge:** The problem wasn't a lack of quality products. It was a lack of a clear, actionable strategy. Brands were suffering from low-quality listings, ineffective PPC campaigns with high ACOS, and a general inability to navigate the complex algorithms of platforms like Amazon. They were putting in the effort but not seeing the results. One such brand, ""Urban Brew Co.,"" a small-batch coffee company, was a perfect example. They had exceptional products but were buried on page 5 of search results, with an average of only 15 orders a day. Their paid advertising was a money pit, with an ACOS hovering around 35%.

**The SpectrumBPO Solution:** Upon partnering with Urban Brew Co., the **SpectrumBPO** experts conducted a comprehensive audit. Their team of **amazon seo agency** professionals immediately went to work. They executed deep keyword research, identifying high-volume, low-competition search terms that their competitors were missing. They then rewrote every product title, bullet point, and description, infusing them with these keywords to dramatically improve organic search rankings.

Simultaneously, the **amazon ppc agency** team took over their ad campaigns. They restructured the entire ad account, implementing targeted campaigns with negative keywords to eliminate wasted ad spend. They focused on product-specific campaigns and created brand-building ad groups. The expertise of SpectrumBPO‚Äôs experts was evident in their data-driven approach, which allowed them to make real-time adjustments for optimal performance.

**The Results:** Within just three months, Urban Brew Co. saw remarkable transformation. Their organic search rank for key terms like ""small-batch coffee"" and ""fair-trade coffee beans"" climbed to the first page. Their average daily orders jumped from 15 to over 100, and their ACOS dropped to a profitable 18%. This success story is just one of more than 200 that **SpectrumBPO** has helped create in a six-month period, demonstrating their ability to provide tangible results and transform businesses from struggling ventures into thriving e-commerce success stories.",1,1755790593.0,EcommerceWebsite,0,1.0,False

I emptied out the basket/bucket that the compost sits in yesterday and I collected the liquid (leachate?) from it because I‚Äôm confused about the perimeters around using it as fertilizer.  

One possible mistake I made was about a 2 months ago, just going off vibes and not doing any research, I used some of the liquid from mid-compost on one of my plants that was looking nutrient deprived. I can‚Äôt believe it, but it didn‚Äôt hurt the plant which seems very lucky. In fact, it did help with the coloring from nutrient deficiency.  But then I did the research which said not to do this, plus it smelled really bad and was all foggy so I threw the rest of it away. 

Yesterday when I drained the bucket, the liquid didn‚Äôt smell at all and it wasn‚Äôt foggy like the last time. Before it had like a poop-fertilizer smell and looked like brown dirty dishwater or something and now it just smells like mud and looks like the consistency of thick coffee. 

Anyway, I‚Äôve read things that say to throw the leachate out, but the experimental part of me wants to try it as fertilizer, especially since I got lucky with it last time. I was thinking about running it through cheesecloth to catch any remaining foggyness. I did this kind of haphazardly last time with a modified colander out of a plastic cup with small holes poked on the bottom. It did work at catching small particles but I‚Äôm not sure if this had anything to do with my luck.

When Chuck Norris tried to fight the CDC, he crawled away with a case of type two diabetes. CDC vs 100 gorillas? The gorillas would last five seconds. Afterwards, there'd be a working group set up on Primate Combat Tactics and Best Practices.

When women were asked if they would rather be stuck in the forest with a bear or the CDC, they overwhelmingly picked the CDC...because you can guarantee that bear isn't up-to-date with its yearly safety trainings with the records to prove it.. and let's face it..only CDC will be deemed competent on Wood and Forestry Compliance. ""That's not a thing"", you say? Well CDC will MAKE it a thing.

If the CDC had a walk up song, it would be Chumbawamba‚Äòs tub thumper ("" I get knocked down, but I get up again, ain't never gonna keep me down"") or Sia‚Äòs ""Titanium"". But you can be sure that  there would be a panel of experts to weigh in before an ultimate decision was made.

CDC isn't afraid of bullets...whether it's five of them  or 500...they‚Äôll still show up to work the next day because  who is gonna feed their cell culture? And those SOPs ain‚Äôt gonna write themselves.

CDC eats Doxy, Flagyl and antimalarials for breakfast with a shot of anti-vaxx tears. CDC has been vaccinated against fear with a 100% efficacy, and zero side effects.

When the rest of the world runs from Ebola and the Zombie Apocalypse, CDC charges towards the danger without even thinking about it ....because it hasn't had its coffee yet and it ain't in no mood to play.

MacGyver has nothing on CDC:  CDC will save a choking  woman with a pocket knife and pen on it's day off (1). CDC has  been known to fashion a hospital and a BSL4 lab in the jungle with nothing  but a mosquito net and a CDC issue travel kit.

If a meteor came crashing to earth, CDC would easily stop it and when asked how they did it, it would simply reply ""There's an SOP for that.""

CDC lets mosquitoes feed on it because it's fun (2) and it provides it with super human strength to combat misinformation AND bowl a 300.

CDC isn't afraid of being riffed, racked, rick-rolled, RFKJ'd or rubbed the wrong way. The CDC will talk to you in acronyms because spelling things out is inefficent and only for the weak.

If you want to mess with someone, you best not mess with CDC.

**So here‚Äôs the add on to the file situation:**

I do want to say my husband is an absolute dream of a husband and has gone above and beyond in the last 5 months we‚Äôve been married. For example last night he carried me home when I told him my feet hurt from my heels, and he ran a bath for me. My husband has such an intense, passionate way of loving. The sex is great don‚Äôt get me wrong, but it feels like that‚Äôs all he wants sometimes. He spoils me and practically anything I want, I have, but it always feels like it‚Äôs masked with an undertone of something sexual?

I listen to him when he‚Äôs struggling and opens up which is rare, I bring him coffee when he works late, massage his shoulders, try and offer him support in any way that I can but I feel like it isn‚Äôt enough in comparison to his almost overbearing love. He provides for me constantly and I feel as though I can‚Äôt do the same for him, so I usually end up compensating through intimacy. After buying me a gift or pampering me he‚Äôll always expect head or just initiate sex though he never outright asks for it. But every nice deed he does is followed with a very suggestive smile and tone of voice. If I don‚Äôt want sex, he won‚Äôt push me, but I still feel guilty. 

I told him I wanted to wait until marriage, and he was so sweet and patient with me, and even after marriage I was slow to agree because I was always a bit shy about being inexperienced at my age. But now, it feels like I‚Äôve unleashed a beast. 

There‚Äôs always a bit of a threat for me to behave well when in public when I‚Äôm seen with him, and if I do, he will ‚Äúreward‚Äù me with sex after and praise me. He also has a bit of a paternal way of looking after me, I‚Äôm not sure if this means anything but he always insists on taking care of me when he‚Äôs free by brushing my hair, picking outfits for me etc. I think it can be really sweet and intimate at times. 

He‚Äôs also extremely possessive of me. Which a girl can like because I feel really desired and wanted by him, but sometimes it feels like he owns me which I despise. He wants to know who I‚Äôm with, where I‚Äôm going etc. though he doesn‚Äôt control what I wear and where I go etc. 

He has my location for safety purposes, but one time when I stayed out later than I intended with my girls, he blew up my phone, and when I finally returned home he cried because he thought something had happened to me, it was the first time I‚Äôd seen him cry. We had a bit of an argument that night which led him to lock the bedroom door because he didn‚Äôt want me to storm out. 

I dont think I‚Äôm too heavily emotional, I let myself feel my emotions for a bit, but I don‚Äôt let them consume me. But it‚Äôs a complete 180 with my husband - if he‚Äôs mad he‚Äôs furious and if he‚Äôs in love it‚Äôs like he‚Äôs suffocating me. He always randomly will make these explosive, intense arguments and it‚Äôs almost like a form of intimacy to him? 

When I put him in his place he gets all smiley? Its like he‚Äôs loves that I challenge him but it feels toxic. The same expression happens if we‚Äôre at a restaurant for example, he might order for me just because he knows I hate when he does that, and then when I stand up for myself, he‚Äôll find it amusing, like it‚Äôs his way of teasing me, but it feels like he‚Äôs always playing these mind games on me.

He‚Äôll always say things out of nowhere when arguing like  ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt want this, just tell me. But don‚Äôt waste my time.‚Äù Or ‚Äúyou‚Äôre just with me because I make your life easy.‚Äù It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs wants me to admit I don‚Äôt actually love him and he‚Äôs scared I‚Äôve changed my mind about him.

One time I‚Äôll never forget is when at a company event, I was talking to a colleague he didn‚Äôt particular like and the ride home was hell to say the least, he kept accusing of me of not being loyal to him or whatever as if I had spoken to the ultimate enemy! Saying things along the lines of ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt act like you don‚Äôt know what you did, you‚Äôre trying to make me jealous.‚Äù Whenever we argue it feels like I‚Äôm a little girl being scolded by her father 

Most of these are recent events since we‚Äôve been married. I‚Äôm not sure if these are all things which can be fixed and talked out, or maybe he has some childhood trauma he needs to reflect on. The problem is I‚Äôm a little scared to leave him if I have to, I feel like I can‚Äôt, I love him so much it hurts and I can‚Äôt imagine myself with anyone else, but sometimes I wonder does he love me or does he feels like he owns me. He‚Äôs had some abandonment issues in his past that‚Äôs he‚Äôs opened up to me about, and I‚Äôve always tried my best to see his behaviour from his perspective.

He‚Äôs never hurt me physically, or seems like he would, I know he does love me, but I think he might not understand the right way to show it. I really didn‚Äôt want to paint my husband in such a bad light and only show the bad sides of our relationship. But I don‚Äôt feel like I can confide in friends or family because my husband has pretty much won them all over since we‚Äôve first started dating.

For context we‚Äôve know each other for years but started dating in mid 2023, dated for 1 year and were engaged for 5 months.

Last year, in April, I placed an order on the coffee shop's website for a bag of coffee for myself and another for a friend's birthday. I paid a total of about ¬£40, including ¬£8 for shipping. A few weeks later, I requested an update to my order because I hadn't received an email about shipping. They replied that one of the bags was out of stock and sent me a code to use on their website (¬£20) instead of a refund. I wrote back asking for a refund and the shipping costs (because if I had only ordered that one item, I wouldn't have paid for it). They refused to refund the shipping costs, but they did refund me for that item.



A few weeks later, I saw that the website had restocked some items and was offering a free shipping promotion. I looked around and realized I'd never used the code. To my surprise, it was still active. I got a free bag of coffee, a return, and free shipping. I was so happy!



A few weeks later, I saw another free shipping promotion and decided to buy another bag. I wondered if the code was a one-time use...



It wasn't.



And surprisingly, for months, every time they ran a free shipping promotion, I used it and made sure I stocked up not only on bags of coffee but also on their products. I bought matcha, an electric blender, a messenger bag, coffee mugs, you name it. I had it.



The code worked until February of this year. I got a total of 12 bags of coffee, each priced around ¬£20, along with all the other products from their store. I expected them to notice eventually, but I didn't know how much time I had, so I strategically spaced out my orders enough to avoid suspicion, but also enough to fully capitalize on the opportunity.



I'll probably never be so lucky again, but I wanted to share this. 2024 was the year of coffee for me.

1mwe7e4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParisTravelGuide/comments/1mwe7e4/paris_in_midseptember/,Paris in mid-September,"I want to thank everybody for their contributions to this sub Reddit. It has been very informative over the last few weeks and I‚Äôve learned quite a bit as I have read through posts.

My wife and I (M65, F66) are going to Paris mid-September. a somewhat last minute trip as we decided to go two weeks ago. We will be there for 6 days including our arrival day. We are traveling from Chicago. This will be the first trip for her.

One thing that has surprised me are the itineraries that I see posted. We did a very old school thing and listed a dozen places we wanted to go to on strips of paper and then just moved them around on another piece of paper with our dates listed. We then had a very loose idea of where we wanted to go and on what days.

Compared to some of the itineraries I have seen on here (dates, exact times listed, specific restaurants) we have a very loose itinerary. Notre Dame, Musse d‚ÄôOrsay, a food tour in La Marais, Giverny, etc. We have a museum pass and have some timed entry reservations for a few of the places.

What we don‚Äôt have are reservations at restaurants. A list of restaurants that we must go to. We don‚Äôt have every second figured out in terms of when or where we should be someplace or doing something. We are very much taking the attitude that we will find a place to eat when we are hungry, depending on what neighborhood we are in. We might just grab some wine, cheese, crackers, bread, and go sit in the park.

We have places that we want to go see, but we don‚Äôt have a minute by minute itinerary. We really don‚Äôt want to return home from a trip to Paris, exhausted by the fact that we filled every waking moment with activities. I suddenly am feeling somewhat under prepared and inadequate for not creating a detailed itinerary. I guess my question behind this post is am I wrong for doing that? Is it OK to just go to Paris and wander thru neighborhoods and people watch, while sitting and drinking coffee or wine.

  
Edit: Sorry I didnt realize the jpegs would post so big lol

Part 1,"The sun was rising over the trees, and the air smelled of freshly cut hay. The village of Eldenwood always woke up early‚Äîlife here was based on farming and fishing. Morgana‚Äôs family had a small farm on the edge of the village. Her mother tended the gardens, her father fished, and her younger brother helped out where he could.
‚ÄúMorgana!‚Äù her father‚Äôs voice brought her out of her thoughts. ‚ÄúAre you going to run off to throw rocks at trees or will you read adventure books again? We have work to do.‚Äù
She sighed, tossed her blond hair back, and grabbed the basket. ‚ÄúOkay, but‚Ä¶ the work never ends. The land will be here tomorrow.‚Äù
Her mother looked at her sternly but tenderly. ‚ÄúAnd tomorrow there might be no one to work it if everyone thinks like you today.‚Äù
Morgana fell silent. She always felt trapped in this place‚Äîas if her life was going the same way, and inside her, a desire for more burned.
The village of Eldenwood lay in the northeastern part of a dense forest, by a wide river. The place was peaceful, but for Morgana ‚Äì boring. She often shot her slingshot at trees or read books instead of helping her family. Her neighbors reproached her for not doing any work, but she preferred dreams of distant lands and adventures to field work. She had taken the book from the attic it was in a box and started reading it. It inspired her even more to want to be an adventurer. This book was called Fortune of The Sun.
When two adventurers arrived in the village ‚Äì Orion and Sianna, looking for a companion for a mission, Morgana immediately declared: ‚Äì Take me!
‚Äì And what are you good at? ‚Äì Orion asked with narrowed gray eyes. ‚Äì I shoot with a slingshot. And I am never afraid of a fight.
‚Äì That last one may be more of a problem than a gift ‚Äì Sianna growled.
But Orion smiled and nodded.
At first, her family did not want to let her go, but when they realized that she would not change her mind, they let her go.
Her mother brought a wooden box, which was kept in a chest in the attic.
‚Äì This was your grandmother‚Äôs, you won‚Äôt find such clothes in the whole village, maybe even in the world, they are priceless ‚Äì she said and carefully picked up a piece of fabric. ‚Äì Once she was also an adventurer.   We named you after her too, you have her free spirit and strong will.Your grandfather never managed to tame her just like we can't tame you . The sling you have was hers, she engraved it herself. 
Inside the box was a hooded cloak  in the colour magenta, made of a special strong fabric. ‚Äì These cloak protect the body from most injuries. Wear them with honor.
Her family sent her away with tears and prayers. Her father hung a medallion with a rune of luck, the protection of their god Kaeldor. ‚Äì Remember, luck doesn‚Äôt always save you, either ‚Äì he said sternly. He also gave her a purse with a few coins.
Morgana just smiled ‚Äì there was no turning back now.

Orion and Siana were experienced adventurers. Orion ‚Äì tall, dark, with black hair and a katana, which he held with almost frightening ease, and as a second weapon he had a large axe. Siana ‚Äì with fiery red hair, patterned eyes and a painted body, as precise as an arrow ‚Äì carried a large bow and two knives for close combat. Both were well equipped.
‚Äì Your sling is nice ‚Äì Siana said, examining the engraved runes. ‚Äì But you won‚Äôt get far with pebbles.
She handed her a small bag of metal balls. ‚Äì Try these. Some contain gas, others are hard as iron.
Morgana grabbed the bag with a sparkle in her eyes ‚Äì the new toy already made her feel like a real adventurer.
On the way, Orion had her choose a weapon for close combat. She settled on a heavy mace.
Soon after leaving, the three adventurers stopped in the forest and pitched a tent.
‚Äì So, recruit ‚Äì Orion said, putting wood into the fire. ‚Äì If you are going to come with us, you must learn something more than throwing stones.
‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôll make sure you don‚Äôt die on the first day,‚Äù Sianna added, and with a smile, she said, ‚ÄúOr do we let her break her neck like you almost did in that cave?‚Äù
‚ÄúOh, there you go again‚Ä¶‚Äù Orion replied, and Morgana smiled. ‚ÄúDo you two always tease each other like this?‚Äù
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs love,‚Äù Sianna laughed. ‚ÄúThe love of getting on his nerves.‚Äù
Morgana laughed along with them, but quickly blushed when Orion told her to get out her  bag of metal balls. ‚ÄúCome on, let‚Äôs see what you can do.‚Äù
Morgana‚Äôs first attempts were a disaster. She pulled the slingshot too hard or too weak, the balls flew in the wrong direction, and once one even hit her in the forehead.
‚ÄúOh!‚Äù she cried, clutching her head. ‚ÄúHa-ha-ha!‚Äù Sianna was writhing in laughter. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen anyone shoot themselves!‚Äù ‚ÄúCome on, it won‚Äôt work the first time,‚Äù Orion said, though there was amusement in his voice. ‚ÄúLook‚Äîyour hands are too tense. Relax them.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm relaxed!‚Äù Morgana pouted. ‚ÄúYes, like a cat in a bag,‚Äù he replied, slowly showing her the movement. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it. You don‚Äôt fight the slingshot. It‚Äôs an extension of you.‚Äù
 Like this - said Morgana while aiming at the target
And she hit the target ten times in a row‚Äîan old barrel a few feet away.
‚ÄúWow! Girl your a beast with the slingshot. Said Siana with a big smile.
Orion was amazed of her skill 
""I know "" Morgana said with a smirk.
The next day, Orion handed her a wooden training sword.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not starting with a real one. I don‚Äôt want you to cut off your leg.‚Äù
She grabbed it... but it was immediately obvious that she was holding the weapon incorrectly - her fingers were tight, the blade was wobbling, and her posture was so bad that even her brother would have laughed at her.
‚Äì That's not a broom, Morgana ‚Äì laughed Sianna ‚Äì But you're probably more used to swinging brooms in your village.
‚Äì Hey! ‚Äì Morgana was offended, but she quickly realized that they were being picky on purpose.
‚Äì Listen ‚Äì said Orion and stood behind her. ‚Äì Hold it like this... the weight in your legs, not your arms. The sword is an extension of the body, not a burden.
The lessons were hard ‚Äì she fell, dropped her weapon, hit herself. But with each evening by the fire, with the jokes and instructions of the two adventurers, Morgana began to learn little by little.
In the morning they went to the city.

The trio reached a small town that suffered from an anomaly ‚Äì every night aggressive beasts appeared that attacked people. With sunrise they disappeared, but the root of the evil was a monster with a red stone in its forehead.
While they waited for darkness to fall, they sat in the local place for food,drinks,rest and quests knows as ""Cafe"" . Morgana was talking about her love for cats and books , and Sianna and Orion were listening to her while drinking a large cups of coffee. She showed them the book that inspired her even more to want to be an adventurer. She had taken it with her when she left. It was called ""Fortune of the Sun"".When they saw the book, Orion and Sianna looked at each other and then Orion said that this was not just an ordinary story and that many adventurers have been trying to find the place described in the book for years but without success. Sianna added with a slight smile, ""Maybe this can be your adventure."" 
‚ÄúThis battle will be your true beginning,‚Äù Orion said. ‚ÄúFrom now on, you are no longer just a village girl.‚Äù
As the screams of the first victims echoed through the streets, they emerged. Shapes were emerging from the shadows on the walls‚Äîanimals, twisted into demonic likenesses of dogs, cats, and birds. Their bodies looked like thick smoke, but their eyes burned blood red.
‚ÄúShadows‚Ä¶‚Äù Sianna muttered. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt seen such creatures in a long time.‚Äù
‚ÄúThey are not flesh and blood,‚Äù Orion said. ‚ÄúStrike their core. Only then will they disappear.‚Äù
Morgana swallowed. Her heart was beating like crazy.
‚ÄúAnd if I don‚Äôt find the core?‚Äù
‚ÄúThen,‚Äù Orion smiled. ‚ÄúYou better run fast.‚Äù
A shadow dog with a body as long as a wave of smoke lunged at them. Its jaws snapped in the air.
‚ÄúMorgana, now!‚Äù Sianna screamed.
She swung her slingshot. The ball passed through the shadow without effect.
‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ no way!‚Äù
‚ÄúIn the eyes, look for the eyes!‚Äù Orion shouted.
Morgana aimed the second ball straight at the beast‚Äôs glowing eye. It exploded in sparks, its entire body scattering like smoke in the wind.
‚ÄúHit it!‚Äù she exclaimed, panting.
‚ÄúSee?‚Äù Orion laughed. ‚ÄúYou just have to look more closely.‚Äù
Shadow birds descended from the rooftops, their wings like blades of darkness. One of them aimed at Morgana. She raised her mace, but her hand was twisted in an improper grip again. Her blow was in vain.
‚ÄúDamn thing!‚Äù she cried.
‚Äì Don‚Äôt hit the air ‚Äì Orion laughed ‚Äì Hit the heart!
With clenched teeth, she adjusted the weapon as she had been taught. The bird swooped, its eyes shining like coals. Morgana swung hard and hit the center of its chest. The bird exploded into a ball of shadow that quickly melted.
‚Äì You‚Äôre good! ‚Äì Sianna shouted ‚Äì But you‚Äôre not done yet.
Suddenly the beasts stopped and gathered in one point. From their flesh and teeth, a huge monster with blazing red eyes formed.
‚Äì There it is! ‚Äì Sianna shouted.
The beast was fast and merciless. The three fell to the ground after a blow from its paw.
‚Äì Someone tell him to trim his nails ‚Äì Orion groaned ‚Äì My ribs hurt! ‚Äì Morgana added as she stood up.
They regrouped. Time was pressing on them ‚Äì there were minutes until sunrise.
‚Äì The stone! ‚Äì Morgana remembered. ‚Äì We must break the stone on its forehead!
The plan was simple ‚Äì two distract it while Sianna aims with a arrow. The first shot missed. The second too. The arrows were gone.
‚Äì I have no more! ‚Äì she cried.
Morgana saw a fallen arrow on the ground. She rushed towards it, but the beast was chasing her. In a panic, she pulled out her slingshot, but the balls scattered.
‚Äì Damn me! ‚Äì she cursed and gritted her teeth.
At the last moment, Orion plunged his axe into the beast, Sianna threw a knife, and the monster froze for a moment. Morgana grabbed the slingshot, aimed and fired.
The red stone shattered. The beast roared ‚Äì a sound that shook the entire city ‚Äì and a moment later it exploded into a cloud of shadows that spread and disappeared. The other shadow beasts melted with it. The first rays of sunlight flooded the streets. They had succeeded.

They returned to the Cafe, exhausted. They received their reward, which they divided almost equally between the three of them, bandaged their wounds, and raised their glasses to celebrate their success.
‚Äì To our girl‚Äôs first victory ‚Äì Orion toasted ‚Äì But our girl got drunk from one glass of beer ‚Äì Siana laughed when Morgana fell asleep at the table.
In the morning, Morgana woke up with a severe hangover. She clumsily went down to the Cafe, where Orion and Siana were waiting for her.
‚Äì We have a call for a mission far from here ‚Äì Orion said ‚Äì Very dangerous. We can‚Äôt take you. 
‚Äì How come?! ‚Äì Morgana was indignant. ‚Äì I‚Äôm part of the team!
‚Äì No. You‚Äôre already an adventurer. But from now on, your path is yours. Who knows, maybe one day our paths will cross again.‚Äì Siana said with a smile.
They said goodbye. Morgana was left alone. She was clutching the medallion with the rune of luck in her hand. 
She remembered what Orion and Siana had told her about the book and she was determined to be the one to find th–µ city of The Sun .
And so her story began.

1mwe2ci,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1mwe2ci/philips_3200_superautomatic_shots_suddenly_weaker/,Philips 3200 superautomatic shots suddenly weaker after grinder jam ‚Äî need advice,"I‚Äôve been having ongoing issues with my Philips 3200 superautomatic. Shots have always been on the weak side, but recently they‚Äôve gotten noticeably worse. A little while ago, the grinder got stuck and the machine essentially seized. I had to clean out the grinder area myself. After that, the machine started working again, but the shots are now even weaker than before.

Here‚Äôs some context:

* **Grind setting:** 3 (I've tried 1, 3, 5)
* **Coffee beans:** I‚Äôve tried Starbucks (medium Pike Place and dark Espresso), Lavazza, and local beans. Flavor/strength issues are consistent across all types.
* **Maintenance:** Brew unit cleaned monthly; grinder doesn‚Äôt need regular manual cleaning. I descale and replace the water filter every 3‚Äì6 months.
* **Machine settings:** Aroma/strength set to max. Water amount set to 1 now (was usually 2). Temperature set to max.
* **Water hardness:** Correctly dialed in for local water.
* **Other factors:** Nothing else changed in the machine or my process.

Has anyone else experienced this sudden drop in shot strength after a grinder issue? Are there hidden adjustments, calibration steps, or tricks with the 3200 to get stronger, more flavorful shots? Any insight would be greatly appreciated!",1,1755789882.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

His head was thrown back in pleasure and he had one hand wrapped in her hair as he pushed her head up and down rapidly.
His eyes met mine when he heard my horrified gasp.
""Wait, let me... I know- it's not"" he reached for my arm.
""Don't touch me.""
""Jake..."" the redhead said as she got to her feet.
""Shut up"" I snarled at her and turned back to Jake ""Don't bother coming home.""
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
Becca
A few days prior
""Hey Jake, are you almost home?"" I asked and propped the phone between my shoulder and ear so I could adjust our son on my hip.
""Sorry babe, I'm going to be late tonight. The client asked if we would take them out to dinner"" my husband replied.
""Oh,"" I tried to keep the disappointment out of my voice but failed ""All alright, I'll just put your plate in the fridge. How late do you think dinner will go?""
""I don't know, Becca"" he paused as a voice murmured in the background and then continued ""I'll be right there. Hey Becca, I've gotta go, they're waiting on me. Don't wait up, you and the baby need your rest.""
""Okay..."" he hung up before I could finish my sentence.
""Looks like it's just you and me tonight, T."" I said and bounced my 3-year-old son Tony a couple times. ""And sissy"" I added as his little sister kicked my bladder.
I rubbed my stomach absentmindedly and looked around the kitchen. Today had been the gender scan and I hadn't told Jake. I knew my husband wouldn't be able to get the time off of work because an important client was in town this week and he had been so stressed about how much of his time they were demanding. Not wanting to add to his stress, I had gone alone and planned on surprising him tonight with the news that we were having a little girl. I had baked a small cake for us and filled the inside with pink frosting and was going to present him with the cake and a picture of the scan right after dinner. As a partner at a prestigious law firm, it was not abnormal for Jake to have last-minute meetings. At 33, Jake was the youngest partner and because of that he said he had to work harder than everyone else.
I put away the lasagna, and cake, and took Tony upstairs for his bath.
We lived in a very comfortable 3 bedroom, 1.5 bath, 2 story house in a safe neighborhood outside of Boston. We had moved here 5 years ago right after we got married, and within a year we found out we were expecting Tony. I had spent my 21st birthday puking just like everyone else, only mine was morning sickness not a hangover.
After I had bathed Tony, I read him a bedtime story and tucked him in for the night. It was only 7p.m, so I still had plenty of time to tidy up and read a few chapters before heading to bed myself. I cleaned up the kitchen and stuck the scan back in my purse and then headed upstairs with my kindle.
I felt the bed dip and heard my husband chuckle as he slid into bed next to me.
""Fell asleep reading again?"" He asked quietly as he took my kindle off of my chest and set it on my bedside table.
""Guess so"" I murmured ""What time is it?""
""It's a little after 9"" He replied and gave me a smooch.
""How did it go?"" I asked between smooch.
""Fine, same as always they just need to feel like they're the most important thing in our world."" He smiled at me as I tried to blink away sleep. His hair was wet, and he looked tired.
""They're working you too hard."" I grumbled and snuggled into his chest as he laid back in bed.
""It won't always be like this."" He replied and then asked, ""How was Tony today?""
""He was good, he had morning preschool and then went to the store with me this afternoon.""
Jake smooched the top of my head and turned off the light.
The next morning, we both woke at the same time and began our usual morning routines. I grabbed Tony out of the crib, while Jake made coffee and then I made breakfast while he took a shower and got ready for work. There wasn't time to discuss the scan, but I asked if he could please try to be home for dinner tonight. He said he would do his best and gave us both a smooch before rushing out the door.
As I got Tony ready for school, I realized I really didn't want to wait to share the news with my husband until his work schedule allowed it. I was rarely difficult about his work schedule, but it was upsetting to face these milestones alone. I decided I would drop Tony off at school and then surprise Jake at work with the cake and scan.
After I dropped Tony off, I called for a cab to pick me up at the house; finding parking in the city was a nightmare and I didn't have a parking pass for the firm's garage. It didn't take long to get there. I thanked the driver as I slid out of the car with my cake in hand.
The guard in the lobby recognized me and waved me through with a smile. It had been a few months since I had last visited but before this pregnancy, I use to stop by for lunch with Jake at least once a week.
I bumped into one of his coworkers and friend, Ryan, on my way to Jake's office.
""Becca?"" he called out with a smile ""What are you doing here?""
""I have a surprise for Jake"" I smiled and lifted the cake box up.
""Lucky basta-rd!"" he joked.
""I'll tell him to save you a piece"" I replied and continued down the hall.
Maryanne, Jake's secretary, was sitting at her desk and gave me a bright smile when I approached.
""Good morning Mrs. Manning, I didn't know you were coming in this morning.""
""Good morning, Maryanne, it's a surprise. Is he busy?'
-
""He just finished with his first client and shouldn't have another call for thirty minutes."" She replied checking his schedule. ""Go right in!""
I gave a quick knock before opening the door. Jake was sitting at his desk staring at his computer screen. He had a very serious expression on his handsome face and his hair was slightly messed up, as if he had recently run his hands through it. He looked up at the intrusion, with an annoyed expression but it quickly fell away into a smile when he saw it was me.
""Becca, what are you doing here?"" He asked and stood up to greet me. At 6'1 he towered over my much smaller 5'5 frame.
""I couldn't wait until tonight to show you this."" I said and set the cake down on his desk and then stood on my tippy toes to give him a smooch.
""You brought me a cake?"" He asked and lifted an eyebrow.
""Actually, I baked you-us a cake last night.""
His face dropped a little.
""I'm sorry about dinner"" He started to say.
""Jake, I've never come to the office to lecture you and that's not why I'm here today"" I interrupted with my hand up. He nodded and waited for me to continue ""I had a doctor's appointment yesterday, and I didn't tell you because I knew you wouldn't be able to get the time off and then would just beat yourself up for it after.""
""Is everything okay with you and the baby?' He asked, looking alarmed.
""Of course, it was the 20-week scan."" I smiled and pulled the scan out of my purse ""I got to see our baby yesterday.""
""Oh, I wish I had been there... 20 weeks is the gender scan, isn't it?"" he asked as the news dawned on him ""So, you know what we are having?""
""Yep!""
""Are you going to tell me?"" He asked with a grin.
""Nope.""
""Becca...""
""But the cake will!"" I said with a giggle.
Jake laughed and pulled me into a hug.
""I love you Rebecca Manning"" he said.
""You better, Jacob Manning"" I teased.
A few minutes later we were hugging again, and Jake was loudly announcing to his office that he was going to be a girl dad. The office replied with mixed calls of congratulations, and Ryan called out that if our daughter looked anything like her mother Jake should get a lawyer on retainer now, and then told him he know a guy. Which made the entire office laugh.
As soon as we were alone in his office again, he pushed me up against the door and gave me a panty soaking smooch.
""Have I thanked you lately for making me the happiest man in the world, Rebecca"" he growled against my lips between smooch.
""Not in the last 48 hours"" I replied, breathlessly, as he nipped at my ear.
""I should rectify that immediately.""
""Maybe you should"" I moaned as his lips trailed down my neck and his teeth grazed my skin.
His phone ringing halted our almost office intercourse and he pushed away from me with a groan.
""I'm so sorry babe, this is my next appointment, I have to take this call"" he sat down and ran his hands through his hair looking frustrated.
""It's okay Jake, I'm the one who barged in."" I giggled ""but I will expect you to finish what you started tonight.""
""You can count on it."" He growled and his eyes darkened with his promise.
I blew him a smooch as he picked up the phone and stepped out of his office with a smile.
""Have a good afternoon, Maryanne.""
""You too, Mrs. Manning!"" She replied.
I was stopped a few more times on my way to elevator by people I knew from various office parties and by one of the other partners. They all wanted to congratulate me and ask about the pregnancy and tell me how much Jake brags about his family. Finally, after twenty minutes of small talk I made it down to the lobby where the guard asked me if I needed him to call a car for me.
""No, that's okay I can just use the app."" I replied and reached for my purse. I cursed quietly when I realized I had left it in Jake's office. ""Well, I can use the app after I go back upstairs and get my purse."" I said and laughed ""pregnancy brain is a real thing, Jerry.""
""Oh, I know"" he replied, ""by the time our 4th was coming I was worried Gloria might leave a baby somewhere."" He chuckled.
I laughed and got back on the elevator.
Maryanne wasn't at her desk when I got back to Jake's office. I hesitated at the door for a moment but decided that it would be less distracting for me to just slip in grab the purse and blow a smooch than to knock.
As the door was opening, I heard Maryanne call to me from down the hall
""Wait!""
I didn't need to worry about distracting Jake as it turned out, because he was plenty distracted by the pretty redhead that was on her knees with her lips wrapped around my husband's manhood while he reclined in his chair.
His head was thrown back in pleasure and he had one hand wrapped in her hair as he pushed her head up and down rapidly.
""Dirty bimbo"" he grunted, and she moaned.
His eyes met mine when he heard my horrified gasp.
""Becca..."" he choked out and the redhead pulled her mouth off of my husband with a little pop. She turned her head and licked her lips before smirking at me.
""You son of a bit-ch"" I snarled and stormed forward to grab my purse that was still sitting on his desk next to the cake box.
He jumped to his feet and tucked himself back into his pants while trying to form a sentence.
""Wait, let me... I know- it's not"" he reached for my arm.
""Don't touch me.""
""Jake..."" the redhead said as she got to her feet.
""Not now, Jessica"" he snapped.
""Excuse me?"" She huffed.
""Shut up"" I snarled at her and turned back to Jake ""Don't bother coming home.""
""Becca, give me a chance to explain."" He reached for me again with tears in his eyes.
""Just let her go Jake."" Jessica laughed, ""You can stay at my place, won't be the first time.""
""Bit-ch..."" I spun to face her.
""Jessica, shut up."" Jake snarled.
""Have you no shame? I'm pregnant with his second child and you are gloating about being the side chick?"" I scoffed.
""I'm not the side chick."" She huffed, indignantly and cross her arms under her very enhanced chest ""he just can't leave your fat a-ss because you got knocked up.""
""That's okay, he's all yours. My 'fat a-ss' and I wish you both all the best."" I side-stepped his hand and stormed out of his office.
""Have you lost your mind?"" I heard him roar as I slammed the door behind me.
The next few moments were a blur as I somehow managed to get to the elevator without letting anyone stop me. I wasn't sure if Jake was going to chase after me or not and didn't slow down for even a second to find out. In the lobby Jerry tried calling out to me that Mr. Manning had asked me to wait but I ignored him and ran outside.",1,1755789817.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

I'm open to anything really, I'm a big foodie, I've recently started hitting the gym after a hiatus, I enjoy being active - like going on hikes or walks but also like the more chill stuff too like just catching a movie or grabbing a coffee and just yapping. If the night life is more your scene that's cool too, we can hit some bars, walk downtown, go karaoke, you name it. 

Okay so about me- I'm 5'11 180lb, pretty average body type by my standards but trying to get back to where I used to be. My friends say I'm handome lol, so there's that. I'm latino, born and raised in the CV but moved out to the bay for work maybe like 5 or 6 years ago. Currently living in east bay. I work in a tech adjacent PM type role. I'm overall a pretty chill dude but I like being more on the outgoing side. I'm a Leo if that matters to anyone lol. 

I'm looking for someone who is looking for something similar. Just wants to go out and chill with no pressure or expectations and just be able to have a good freaken time.

My mom was always the one who prepared everything and would ask me what kind of party I wanted or who I‚Äôd like to invite, but I always told her, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs up to you.‚Äù They were also the ones who shouldered the expenses, so I never really planned my own day.

Even on my 18th birthday, when my mom asked if I wanted a grand party, I said no. So once again, it was kept simple and intimate.

But now, I‚Äôve been thinking‚Äîit‚Äôs about time I plan a birthday for myself. And honestly, I want to spend it alone. Not because I don‚Äôt value my family, but because I feel like I owe this to myself. I want to celebrate me.

I've got a new job, a one-month old, and I've done absolutely nothing over the offseason to get this ready. But on the other hand: it's college football season, and that's reason enough to get excited. That also means it's time for Year 9 of Reverse Sheep. 

#[This week's entry form](https://forms.gle/KYAZhuT7hRPX4J28A) 

If you don't know what's going on and you clicked this thread hoping to learn about a new position to try out in the bedroom, scroll down for the rules. And the prizes -- that's right, outsmart the competition and you could win real money. Our smallest prize will get you a cup of coffee; our grand prize will get you five whole cups of coffee. As always, the game is 100% free to play. For the sickos returning for more, welcome back! Drop a comment and say hi.

As usual, Week 0 is the soft launch. Only the five games games featuring an FBS team to be played on Saturday, August 23 are eligible for this week's picks. The full slate of Week 1 FBS games (starting Thursday August 28) will be included in next week's questions. There will be only three questions instead of the usual five, and Week 0 scores will not count toward the season-long standings. However, you can still earn your postseason spot if you place in the top 10% this week.

*For this week only, you* **can** *use FCS players (from Idaho State only) as an answer.*

#[The /r/CFB Reverse Sheep master spreadsheet (scores, standings, and more)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eDn1juEDIOYoGwDjLf-idBuQ3-SJ4UNzgOL3wL0NjSk/edit?usp=sharing)
(Link goes to last year's... the 2025 sheet will be live after Week 0)

#What is Reverse Sheep? 
Reverse Sheep is a futures prediction game where the goal is to come up with answers that are both correct and unique. Each week features five questions about players, teams, point totals, and anything else I cook up.

Think of Reverse Sheep like the opposite of Family Feud. In Family Feud, you would want to be a ""sheep"" and follow the crowd, identifying the most popular answer. Reverse Sheep is the opposite: **You want to give the *least* popular answer that is still correct.** If you provide a correct answer, you score points equal to how many people guessed your answer. If your answer is incorrect, your score is the sum of the number of people who guessed the most popular answer PLUS the total number of unique correct answers given. Lowest score wins.

#I'm confused. How about an example?
Sure. Let's say one of the questions is: ""Name an FBS player who will rush for 125+ yards this week."" Imagine 40 people are playing, and their answers break down like this, with the number of yards that player *actually* winds up rushing for in [brackets].

* Jeremiyah Love (13 respondents) [168 rushing yards]
* Jonah Coleman (10) [105] 
* Nick Singleton (7) [133] 
* Dylan Edwards (3) [26] 
* Makhi Hughes (2) [126] 
* Ahmad Hardy (2) [190] 
* Kaytron Allen (1) [65] 
* Arch Manning (1) [49] 
* Quintrevion Wisner (1) [159]

Everyone who picked a player that eclipsed 125 yards scores points equal to how many guessed their answer. So the thirteen Love pickers get 13 points, the seven Singleton pickers get 7, the two Hughes pickers and the two Hardy pickers get 2, and the sole person who picked Quintrevion Wisner gets 1 point, an ace. An ace is the best possible outcome as it means you were the only person to pick a particular correct answer.

Everyone else who picked incorrectly is tagged with 18 points. That's the number of the most popular pick (13) plus the number of correct responses given (5). Again, you are trying for the **lowest** score possible.

#Bonuses
Throughout the course of the season, you'll be able to earn bonuses for top performances. A bonus will allow you to give two responses to a question in the postseason, giving you two chances at a correct answer (if both answers are correct, the lower score will count). Here's how to earn one:

* Placing in the top 3 overall in a single week
* Placing in the top 10 overall in the season-long standings
* Placing in the top 10% for three or more consecutive weeks (streaks cannot overlap; 1-3 and 4-6 would count as two streaks, but 1-3 and 2-4 would not)
* Picking two or more Aces in a single week
* Finish in the top 3 of Aces for the season (3+ aces minimum)
* Participate every week (1-14; Week 0 is not included for this purpose)
* Beat the host (weeks 5 and 10)

There is no limit to the number of bonuses that may be earned.

#How do I win?
There are prizes for finishing in the top 10 of the season-long standings as well as the top three of the postseason. There are two ways in which you can qualify for the postseason, which will be the bowl season. You need to either finish in the top 10% of players for any one week, or make the top 10% of scores across the entire season. Anyone who misses a week will be charged the highest score of the week, as if they picked every question incorrectly, plus 1 point. Even players who don't discover the game until later in the season can still play and qualify for the postseason without disrupting the season-long standings. However you qualify, there will be a Bowl Season edition, where scores reset and we crown a bowl champion.

Note that the top 10% is a hard cutoff, rounded to the nearest whole number. If 227 people play (23 playoff spots awarded) but 8 of the top 23 have already earned playoff berths, then only 15 new postseason berths would be earned that week. In case of a tie, all players tied for the last spot would get a postseason berth.

#What do I win?
Many winners choose to have their prize awarded in the form of a donation to a charity they support. Prizes can also be awarded in the form of an e-gift card, Venmo, etc. 

* **Gold medal (1st place) in the regular season standings** - $50
* **Silver medal (2nd place) in the regular season standings** - $30
* **Bronze medal (3rd place) in the regular season standings** - $20
* **Runner-Up (4th-10th place) in the regular season standings** - $10
* **Winner, bowl season/postseason edition** - $25
* **Second place, bowl season/postseason edition** - $10
* **Third place, bowl season/postseason edition** - $5

""Why 'Silksong,' Team Cherry's Sequel to 'Hollow Knight,' Took So Long‚Ä¶""

Hi everyone, and welcome to a special edition of Game On about a very special game that we‚Äôll be playing quite soon.

The wait is over

It‚Äôs surreal to write, but it‚Äôs true: Silksong will be out on Sept. 4.

After six years of near-total silence from the developers and enough feverish anticipation to make it the most wish-listed game on Steam, the sequel to the indie hit Hollow Knight is releasing in two weeks. Team Cherry, the small team behind both games, announced the news Thursday in a trailer.
Why did it take so long?

Often, such protracted development cycles are caused by mismanagement and result in painful burnout among the staff. But speaking to me last week on a video call from their office in Adelaide, Australia, Team Cherry Co-Founders Ari Gibson and William Pellen said that making Silksong has been nothing but a joyful process.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been having fun,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúThis whole thing is just a vehicle for our creativity anyway. It‚Äôs nice to make fun things.‚Äù

The lengthy production wasn‚Äôt the result of development challenges or obstacles, they said. They just needed all these years to ensure that Silksong was exactly the game they wanted to make.

‚ÄúIt was never stuck or anything,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúIt was always progressing. It‚Äôs just the case that we‚Äôre a small team, and games take a lot of time. There wasn‚Äôt any big controversial moment behind it.‚Äù

The Silksong saga started in 2017 when Team Cherry released Hollow Knight, an action-platformer set in a vast world full of cartoon bugs. A Switch version, released the following year, added to the momentum. By the end of 2018, millions of fans were raving about its polished gameplay, distinct style and impeccable vibes. As of today, the game has sold 15 million copies, Team Cherry told me, making it one of the most successful independent video games ever.
Initially, Gibson and Pellen had planned to release an expansion pack revolving around Hornet, one of its key characters. But in February 2019, they announced that the expansion had grown too big and would instead become a full-fledged sequel, titled Silksong.
Hollow Knight had been massive, and their plan at the outset was to build a smaller world for Silksong. To ensure that the game felt just as deep, they‚Äôd implement an elaborate quest system that would offer the player reasons to backtrack and revisit old locations. In contrast to Hollow Knight, which had a single town full of shops and characters to meet, there would also be multiple towns, each serving as a hub for quests.

‚ÄúEven at that point we were recognizing that it was going to become another giant thing to rival the scale of Hollow Knight or probably exceed it,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúAnd then because of how we work, obviously the world ended up being just as big or bigger. And the quest system existed. And the multiple towns existed. Suddenly you end up six, seven years later.‚Äù

It all came down to their development style, which may have been too much fun. Gibson and Pellen ‚Äî who were joined by programmer Jack Vine, composer Chris Larkin and a few contractors who helped with programming and testing ‚Äî started off by designing the core gameplay for Hornet, the game‚Äôs slick protagonist. From there, it was easy to implement and test out new ideas, even as the game grew bigger.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre very fortunate that we have a development method that is so enjoyable,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúNot exactly sure how we stumbled into that. Everything comes together quickly. You can see results fast. Ideas turn into something that exist in the game almost immediately before your eyes, and that‚Äôs very satisfying. And that allows you to go off on those tangents and meet weird characters because someone‚Äôs off-handedly mentioned a weird character as an idea and the other person‚Äôs laughed, and that‚Äôs enough.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre always working on a new idea, new item, new area, new boss,‚Äù Pellen said. ‚ÄúThat stuff‚Äôs so nice. It‚Äôs for the sake of just completing the game that we‚Äôre stopping. We could have kept going.‚Äù

The downside of this methodology was that it could have lasted forever.

‚ÄúI remember at some point I just had to stop sketching,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúBecause I went, ‚ÄòEverything I‚Äôm drawing here has to end up in the game. That‚Äôs a cool idea, that‚Äôs in. That‚Äôs a cool idea, that‚Äôs in.‚Äô You realize, ‚ÄòIf I don‚Äôt stop drawing, this is going to take 15 years to finish.‚Äô‚Äù

During the development of Hollow Knight, Gibson and Pellen frequently posted game updates and talked to players. At the end of 2019, Team Cherry posted one more update about Silksong, then went silent ‚Äî much to fans‚Äô dismay.
‚ÄúWe felt like continued updates were just going to sour people on the whole thing,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúBecause all we could really say is, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre still working on it.‚Äô‚Äù

They wanted to be particularly cautious about avoiding spoilers. Much of the thrill of Hollow Knight came from accidentally stumbling upon secret passageways or breaking down walls to find hidden bugs. Silksong has plenty of its own secrets that they didn‚Äôt want to detail before the release.

Plus, they thought Silksong would be out much sooner.

‚ÄúInstead of popping up and bugging people for the sake of it, it felt like our actual responsibility was just to work on the game,‚Äù Pellen said. ‚ÄúProbably at the time we thought we‚Äôd go quiet for a year or two, then the game would come out.‚Äù

In 2020, as Covid disrupted most video-game productions around the world, Adelaide was able to stave off the worst of the pandemic, going months without new cases, which allowed Gibson and Pellen to continue plugging along on Silksong. ‚ÄúSeems a little odd knowing that the rest of the world has such a dramatic and isolating period,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúHere we were, going to caf√©s and having brunch.‚Äù

Silksong briefly resurfaced in 2022 during an Xbox event, which promised that all of the games shown would be out within a year. Xbox doubled down on Twitter, saying the Hollow Knight sequel would be out before June 2023.
At the time, they all thought it was true. ‚ÄúWe did genuinely believe that was the case,‚Äù Pellen said. ‚ÄúThere was a period of two to three years when I thought it was going to come out within a year.‚Äù

But the game kept growing. Silksong has more elaborate bosses than Hollow Knight, more gameplay systems and more interactivity. Gibson and Pellen wanted objects in the world to react to Hornet‚Äôs various tools, which required a ton of drawing and animation work.

‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre always underestimating the amount of time and effort it‚Äôll take us to achieve things,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also that problem where, because we‚Äôre having fun doing it, it‚Äôs not like, ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs taking longer, this is awful, we really need to get past this phase.‚Äô It‚Äôs, ‚ÄòThis is a very enjoyable space to be in. Let‚Äôs perpetuate this with some new ideas.‚Äô‚Äù

The longer development lasted, the more pressure Gibson and Pellen felt to ensure that everything was as fine-tuned as possible. They‚Äôd already spent four years on it ‚Äî why would they rush now? The more time they spent polishing some parts, the more time they needed to apply it consistently across the rest.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a level of finish that has to be met throughout the entire game,‚Äù Pellen said. ‚ÄúAll the way the systems interact, all the hidden work that pops up later on. It‚Äôs multiplicative. As you add stuff, the process of tying it all back together just increases.‚Äù

Throughout development, Team Cherry remained tiny, which may have extended the production time but also saved them from the slog of having to manage and delegate. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want to mess with the formula and then find out it‚Äôs not fun,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúI used to manage teams in past lives. I don‚Äôt really want to do that ever again.‚Äù

Staying small also meant eschewing the production practices commonplace at many game-development studios.

‚ÄúWhat is Jira?‚Äù Gibson said when I asked if they used the task-management application.

‚ÄúIs it a software?‚Äù Pellen said, adding that they‚Äôd briefly used Trello before their account was deactivated because they didn‚Äôt use it enough.

As development dragged on, the hype for Silksong grew more feverish.
Perhaps the biggest reason Silksong took so long was that Team Cherry never had to worry about the one thing that keeps other independent developers awake at night: money.

During the production of Hollow Knight, they‚Äôd stayed lean, sometimes living off leftover triangle sandwiches that their office neighbor would bring them after meetings. ‚ÄúMy dad would sometimes pop up and give me $20,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd be like, ‚ÄòOh, I‚Äôm having coffee today!‚Äô‚Äù

Thanks to their first game‚Äôs massive financial success, Gibson and Pellen no longer have to scrounge leftovers. For Pellen, who has two kids and a third on the way, that‚Äôs provided an inestimable peace of mind. For Gibson, who said he spends most of his time at the office, it hasn‚Äôt changed much. ‚ÄúI live in a very basic two-bedroom apartment,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSometimes I think, ‚ÄòYou know what would be better, is a one-bedroom apartment.‚Äô Because then there‚Äôs even less to maintain.‚Äù

The game has continued to generate revenue by reaching new players, perhaps in large part due to the Silksong buzz. When the studio announced Silksong in February 2019, Hollow Knight had sold 2.8 million copies. The game has sold another 12 million copies since then, allowing Team Cherry to keep working on the sequel indefinitely without having to worry about running out of funds.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre very lucky in that regard,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt ever really think about it that much. Maybe that‚Äôs the privilege of it.‚Äù

As the years went on, the hype kept building. A Reddit forum dedicated to the game filled up with nonsensical blabber and made-up tweets, which users called ‚Äúsilkposts,‚Äù a variation on the expletive. Meanwhile, chat sections for video-game livestreams and Nintendo Direct events were plagued with the same feral messages repeated over and over: ‚ÄúSilksong when?‚Äù
Gibson and Pellen tuned it all out, rarely going online. They say they never read comments on YouTube or Reddit, although occasionally friends or family would send them some of the funniest ones.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice that people are passionate about the game, and that they‚Äôve obviously formed their own strange or very exciting communities around it,‚Äù Gibson said.

‚ÄúFeels like we‚Äôre going to ruin their fun by releasing the game,‚Äù Pellen said.

Once in a while, people would show up at the Team Cherry office, sometimes with their children, perhaps hoping for a Willy Wonka type experience. Inevitably, they were disappointed by what they found instead. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a grubby room with cardboard boxes,‚Äù Gibson said.

Their walls remain the same dull avocado color that they were when Team Cherry moved in more than a decade ago. They never even put up art. They‚Äôve been too busy making the game.

In early 2025, Gibson and Pellen began to see the finish line and started making plans to release the game in the fall. Players desperate for information devoured every scrap of news ‚Äî like the announcement that it would be playable at a museum in September ‚Äî hoping this might finally be the year.
Both Nintendo Co. and Microsoft Corp.‚Äôs Xbox said during live events this year that Silksong was planned for 2025, but fans were cautious. They‚Äôd been down this road before.

Meanwhile, Team Cherry kept working. The shape of the game has been finalized for a while, Pellen said. The last year or two has been all about the details ‚Äî adding small encounters, polishing everything and tying it all together.

And they‚Äôre still working to finalize things until the last possible minute. As we spoke, with Silksong a little more than three weeks out, I spotted programmer Jack Vine in the background, tweaking code for one of the game‚Äôs console ports.

Gibson and Pellen say they‚Äôre happy that the game is finally coming out ‚Äî and even happier that they will get to keep working on it, which they still find enjoyable even after seven years. They haven‚Äôt burned out or shown any desire to take a break. Instead, they‚Äôre already making big plans to add extra content to Silksong in the months and years to come.

‚ÄúLaunching it is obviously quite exciting,‚Äù Pellen said. ‚ÄúWhat comes after for us is equally as exciting.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe most interesting thing now is what can we add to it next,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúWe got a plan. Admittedly, some of the plans for that stuff are kind of ambitious as well, but hopefully we can achieve some of it.‚Äù

Stay tuned for 2032 to see how that turns out.

1mwdk21,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1mwdk21/two_weeks_too_much_coffee_and_now_i_can_finally/,"Two weeks, too much coffee, and now I can finally self-host Web3 sites (TruthGate, open source)","I'm not going to try and shill Web3 (decentralized internet) on your soul, but as a Web3 lover and developer, there's significant issues in the space. You have to use something centralized, or it's SaaS based, or requires huge mass adoption to have enough peers to help host your content. **Man... I just want to host a website on Web3 because it's cool and I subscribe to that mentality. Okay??? Why is it so hard?!**

So, in less than 2 weeks, surviving purely on caffeine. I built TruthGate. Basically, it's your secure front door to IPFS (where your decentralized content is hosted). You see when people host a Web3 site on IPFS you have to share a link like this:

[http://ipfs.io/ipns/k51qzi5uqu5dgo40x3jd83hrm6gnugqvrop5cgixztlnfklko8mm9dihm7yk80](http://ipfs.io/ipns/k51qzi5uqu5dgo40x3jd83hrm6gnugqvrop5cgixztlnfklko8mm9dihm7yk80)

And let me guess.. It didn't load did it? Now if it did for you? It's because that gateway cached my site, and I promise, it won't be cached tomorrow ;)

It's terrible! And imagine, you're trying to serve the entire world through a single gateway. Not even Google is crazy enough to do that!

So, TruthGate came in to be. The project allows you to easily host an IPFS edge node that's secure, locked down, and only serves what it should. Yes, after logging in you can use it all you want. But anyone else? Yea.. They can only be served what your website actually allows. Aka, nobody can just use your site as a public gateway to grab massive files.

It does a lot more as well, like helping pin IPNS links, has a little protocol I call TGP, makes decentralized nodes and redundancy setup easier, and more.

There was a lot of really annoying issues about this too. Like when you use IPFS for example, you usually download this:

[https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/ipfs-desktop/](https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/ipfs-desktop/)

You get a nice GUI interface, makes your life easier, you can pair it with:

[https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ipfs-companion/nibjojkomfdiaoajekhjakgkdhaomnch](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ipfs-companion/nibjojkomfdiaoajekhjakgkdhaomnch)

And then you can traverse Web3 properly. But that GUI interface is nice right? You know how hard that was to get working securely on TruthGate?! They have local environment calls paired with normal calls, which means those who utilize Web3 tooling would get hijacked experiences that messed up. So, I literally had to create instances of grabbing the index.html and building secure hijacked versions that resolved these issues. I had to handle weird routing proxy situations. And that wasn't even the worst of it! Proper Web3 hosting was a pain due to just a lack of integration philosophy in the community.

Honestly I love Web3, but between you and me. What I won't say in Web3 communities is this. Nobody actually considers real world use cases. It's all too often build on experiments or philosophy, not real world use.

I just want a Netlify (or open source Coolify) like experience to drag and drop my website onto a GUI, or utilize a CLI pipeline command to deploy my site. I just want people to see it. I remember my first post a long time ago that I made sharing a really cool project I made. But I hosted the project website on IPFS (Web3). And I remember the exact comment someone gave me saying, ""This doesn't load. F\*\*\* your site.""

Yea... Yea... I get it. I do.. I know it's weird. I know it's not normal. I have my reasons. As I said, I'm not here to sell you on Web3, just tell you my struggles and my project.

But you have no idea. Even the legalities of hosting on Web3 is heavily under discussed. And that has to be solved as well (which this does with TGP). TGP is really cool. It's the TruthGate Pointer protocol. It's a simple way of basically hosting a website that you can say, ""I don't condone previous immutable files, nor do I host it."" So, lets say you have a user submitted comment on your site. And it has maybe a link to something illegal, or copyrighted material. The issue with hosting a site on what's called IPNS is that you can remove it visually, but it's truly only an append in the files, not a true delete. Everything is immutable.

What does that mean? If someone posted something illegal.. Well... You're still serving it. Therefore, you are legally responsible still. Just because it's not visible on your site doesn't mean your node can't provide it to those who know how to request it. TGP bypasses this by turning IPNS into a pointer, not a content host. Allowing decentralized linking to the newest hosted site without actually continuing to host the old content on your node!

I know that's a nerdy thing to focus on, and honestly TGP is one of the tiniest aspects of TruthGate, but I found it fascinating!

TruthGate does a lot. From self hosting a deployable website that can be accessed on Web2 or Web3. Secure routing through Web3, your own gateway, secure GUI access, faster experience, so on and so forth.

Honestly this was an incredibly fun project. Though I built it in a coffee fueled state in mere weeks. This has been a passion project for many years of prototyping, idea building, and more. But, now.. I can post my Web3 websites. And you can finally see them! And for that, I'm very proud.

From automatic SSL creation from Lets Encrypt to serving IPNS links that actually load. I'm really happy to say that TruthGate is launched. And you can run your Web3 site now easily with a GUI interface and all the power with a simple $4 VPS.

Access my Web3 website. This time I promise. It will load :)

Hi everyone, and welcome to a special edition of Game On about a very special game that we‚Äôll be playing quite soon.

# The wait is over

It‚Äôs surreal to write, but it‚Äôs true: *Silksong* will be out on Sept. 4.

After six years of near-total silence from the developers and enough feverish anticipation to make it the most wish-listed game on Steam, the sequel to the indie hit *Hollow Knight* is releasing in two weeks. Team Cherry, the small team behind both games, announced the news [Thursday in a trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGeJwsUP9c).

Why did it take so long?

Often, such protracted development cycles are [caused by mismanagement](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-10/why-so-many-video-games-cost-so-much-to-make) and result in painful burnout among the staff. But speaking to me last week on a video call from their office in Adelaide, Australia, Team Cherry Co-Founders Ari Gibson and William Pellen said that making *Silksong* has been nothing but a joyful process.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been having fun,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúThis whole thing is just a vehicle for our creativity anyway. It‚Äôs nice to make fun things.‚Äù

The lengthy production wasn‚Äôt the result of development challenges or obstacles, they said. They just needed all these years to ensure that *Silksong* was exactly the game they wanted to make.

‚ÄúIt was never stuck or anything,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúIt was always progressing. It‚Äôs just the case that we‚Äôre a small team, and games take a lot of time. There wasn‚Äôt any big controversial moment behind it.‚Äù

The *Silksong* saga started in 2017 when Team Cherry released *Hollow Knight*, an action-platformer set in [a vast world full of cartoon bugs](https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-the-kotaku-review-1827367425). A Switch version, released the following year, added to the momentum. By the end of 2018, millions of fans were raving about its polished gameplay, distinct style and impeccable vibes. As of today, the game has sold 15 million copies, Team Cherry told me, making it one of the most successful independent video games ever.

Initially, Gibson and Pellen had planned to release an expansion pack revolving around Hornet, one of its key characters. But in February 2019, they announced that [the expansion had grown too big](https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/hollow-knight-silksong-revealed) and would instead become a full-fledged sequel, titled *Silksong*.

*Hollow Knight* had been massive, and their plan at the outset was to build a smaller world for *Silksong*. To ensure that the game felt just as deep, they‚Äôd implement an elaborate quest system that would offer the player reasons to backtrack and revisit old locations. In contrast to *Hollow Knight*, which had a single town full of shops and characters to meet, there would also be multiple towns, each serving as a hub for quests.

Perhaps the biggest reason *Silksong* took so long was that Team Cherry never had to worry about the one thing that keeps other independent developers awake at night: money.

During the production of *Hollow Knight*, they‚Äôd stayed lean, sometimes living off leftover triangle sandwiches that their office neighbor would bring them after meetings. ‚ÄúMy dad would sometimes pop up and give me $20,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd be like, ‚ÄòOh, I‚Äôm having coffee today!‚Äô‚Äù

Thanks to their first game‚Äôs massive financial success, Gibson and Pellen no longer have to scrounge leftovers. For Pellen, who has two kids and a third on the way, that‚Äôs provided an inestimable peace of mind. For Gibson, who said he spends most of his time at the office, it hasn‚Äôt changed much. ‚ÄúI live in a very basic two-bedroom apartment,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSometimes I think, ‚ÄòYou know what would be better, is a one-bedroom apartment.‚Äô Because then there‚Äôs even less to maintain.‚Äù

The game has continued to generate revenue by reaching new players, perhaps in large part due to the *Silksong* buzz. When the studio announced *Silksong* in February 2019, *Hollow Knight* had sold 2.8 million copies. The game has sold another 12 million copies since then, allowing Team Cherry to keep working on the sequel indefinitely without having to worry about running out of funds.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre very lucky in that regard,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt ever really think about it that much. Maybe that‚Äôs the privilege of it.‚Äù

As the years went on, the hype kept building. A Reddit forum [dedicated to the game](https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/) filled up with nonsensical blabber and made-up tweets, which users called ‚Äúsilkposts,‚Äù a variation on the expletive. Meanwhile, chat sections for video-game livestreams and Nintendo Direct events were plagued with the same feral messages repeated over and over: ‚Äú*Silksong* when?‚Äù

Gibson and Pellen tuned it all out, rarely going online. They say they never read comments on YouTube or Reddit, although occasionally friends or family would send them some of the funniest ones.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice that people are passionate about the game, and that they‚Äôve obviously formed their own strange or very exciting communities around it,‚Äù Gibson said.

‚ÄúFeels like we‚Äôre going to ruin their fun by releasing the game,‚Äù Pellen said.

Once in a while, people would show up at the Team Cherry office, sometimes with their children, perhaps hoping for a Willy Wonka type experience. Inevitably, they were disappointed by what they found instead. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a grubby room with cardboard boxes,‚Äù Gibson said.

Their walls remain the same dull avocado color that they were when Team Cherry moved in more than a decade ago. They never even put up art. They‚Äôve been too busy making the game.

In early 2025, Gibson and Pellen began to see the finish line and started making plans to release the game in the fall. Players desperate for information devoured every scrap of news ‚Äî like the announcement that it would be [playable at a museum in September](https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-will-be-playable-in-september-2025-at-an-australian-museum) ‚Äî hoping this might finally be the year.

Both Nintendo Co. and Microsoft Corp.‚Äôs Xbox said during live events this year that *Silksong* was planned for 2025, but fans were cautious. They‚Äôd been down this road before.

Meanwhile, Team Cherry kept working. The shape of the game has been finalized for a while, Pellen said. The last year or two has been all about the details ‚Äî adding small encounters, polishing everything and tying it all together.

And they‚Äôre still working to finalize things until the last possible minute. As we spoke, with *Silksong* a little more than three weeks out, I spotted programmer Jack Vine in the background, tweaking code for one of the game‚Äôs console ports.

Gibson and Pellen say they‚Äôre happy that the game is finally coming out ‚Äî and even happier that they will get to keep working on it, which they still find enjoyable even after seven years. They haven‚Äôt burned out or shown any desire to take a break. Instead, they‚Äôre already making big plans to add extra content to *Silksong* in the months and years to come.

‚ÄúLaunching it is obviously quite exciting,‚Äù Pellen said. ‚ÄúWhat comes after for us is equally as exciting.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe most interesting thing now is what can we add to it next,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúWe got a plan. Admittedly, some of the plans for that stuff are kind of ambitious as well, but hopefully we can achieve some of it.‚Äù

Stay tuned for 2032 to see how that turns out.",17,1755788665.0,Silksong,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôm a broke ho, okay? I‚Äôm going to give my shower routine, and I need input as to what I can do to improve. 

My goals for my skin are
-stay pale
-less to no strawberry legs/skin
-less to no ingrown hairs 
-less to no bumps/pimples/cysts
-smooth skin
-as bald as I can get 

I have sensitive skin and have tried different exfoliants, scrubs, razors, gels, creams and serums, lotions, oils- I‚Äôve tried a lot. 

Currently this is my routine for skin 
I shower every other day, so this routine gets done every other day 

Dove sensitive skin bar soap on loofa or rag, scrub whole body

Exfoliate with homemade sugar/coffee scrub (ingredients consist of coffee/sugar, coconut oil, and honey) 

Then I was with dove bar soap again

I shave my legs and underarms against the grain and gently wash with clean loofa or rag 

For Pubic area, I useavacado ceramide moisture barrier cleanser (gifted to me, it‚Äôs helped with bumps and cysts)

I then shave WITH the direction of hair growth, then side to side. Never directly against the grain. It hurts. 

After shaving, I rinse with warm water. 

Out of the shower, I rub a thin layer or coconut oil on underarms and pubic area

Shinjuku Station. Evening rush. Rain tapping softly on the glass roof above. The crowd moves in practiced silence. I sit on a bench near Exit A5, watching them blur past like ghosts.

A man in a cheap suit stands beside the vending machine, staring at the same canned coffee for far too long.

I speak first.

‚∏ª

Me:
‚ÄúIs it that hard to choose?‚Äù

Him: (without turning)
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not choosing. I‚Äôm just pretending I have a choice.‚Äù

Me:
‚Äú‚Ä¶That‚Äôs dramatic.‚Äù

Him: (finally looks over, eyes tired but sincere)
‚ÄúDramatic is all I have left, I think.‚Äù

Me:
‚ÄúYou look like someone who used to be alive.‚Äù

Him: (chuckles weakly)
‚ÄúWas it the tie? Or the way I haven‚Äôt blinked in a while?‚Äù

Me:
‚ÄúBoth. And the way you‚Äôre gripping that briefcase like it‚Äôs the last thing tethering you here.‚Äù

Him:
‚ÄúThis briefcase is full of meaningless reports. I carry it because if I don‚Äôt, I might float off the edge of the platform and no one would notice for a while.‚Äù

Me:
‚ÄúYou say that like you‚Äôve thought it through.‚Äù

Him:
‚ÄúI‚Äôve felt it through. Every morning when I brush my teeth and can‚Äôt remember if it‚Äôs Thursday or already next week. Every night when the train doors close and I see my reflection in the glass‚Ä¶ and he looks more real than I feel.‚Äù

Me:
‚ÄúDo you ever want to disappear?‚Äù

Him: (voice cracks slightly)
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to die. I just want everything to stop‚Ä¶ for a while. A pause button. Even five minutes would help.‚Äù

Me:
‚ÄúWhat would you do in that pause?‚Äù

Him:
‚ÄúBreathe.‚Äù

(a long silence passes. The train screeches below. You hear someone laughing far away ‚Äî it sounds foreign.)

Me:
‚ÄúI think people forget how much pain hides in plain sight here.‚Äù

Him:
‚ÄúIn Japan, we master silence before truth. We bow instead of screaming. We endure instead of healing.‚Äù

Me:
‚ÄúAnd what about you?‚Äù

Him:
‚ÄúI‚Äôm still deciding whether I‚Äôm surviving or just‚Ä¶ politely dying.‚Äù

1mwdcqo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unsent_Unread_Unheard/comments/1mwdcqo/you_are_worth_so_much/,You are worth so much,"I'd love to reach out and hear about your day, how you are, what song you introspectively picked apart at today, why you like this weather much better than hot summer heat, because maybe it's starting to feel like Fall and how it makes you want to stay in a blanket and read with your coffee on a rainy day. Your peace and healing are important and the priority, this is at your pace, and I will follow, and I don't want to make you upset, but I also don't want to abandon you any more than I have. I want to reach out to you, but I am not sure if I should. I want to hear about all of your inner workings like we had, to help heal our connection and hope to make it so much safer, kinder, gentler than I had made it, and letting you handle it all on your own.

I'm sorry for my lack of attention and responsibility. I only hadn't moved in sooner because I was so afraid to make everyone deal with how I get when I can't handle my own shit. I know how I can be, and it worried me to make you all deal with that. I didn't know how to heal it properly. Being in therapy helps. I'm learning new tools, strategies, and putting them into practice for when it matters the most. I'm so sorry it's taken me this long, I guess I hadn't realized how badly it became. Hindsight is awfully useless after the fact.

My shortcomings on handling myself made me feel like I would ruin everything for us and then be stuck having a big rent or house on your shoulders to carry alone if I had to leave. Leaving isn't an option when there is so much that can be done to heal and help you all. And ultimately, now even before we're all under one roof, I still managed to create chaos.

Everything you said to me on how you felt has resonated so strongly, I can't forget those words. I think I needed to hear them, you are right in feeling how you felt. I'm sorry that I made you feel this way for so long. I want to repair everything that I damaged, to heal us, to help you, to bring love and trust again, I just don't know how to begin. What if I can't reach you over the walls that I helped build? But a fool wouldn't even try to make the climb. I am here.

It was absolutely not my intention to make you feel like you were left alone to carry us. It's my own fault I haven't gotten help to fix my issues, and I am sorry for burdening you with empty promises. I have good intentions always, my follow through is so slow, but I never stop thinking about the goals I'd like to achieve. It's not all hot air, it's not to give a rush of happiness that will fall away, it's just I end up making a wish list that gets too much and then I fall out. Then you end up feeling let down or 'here's another broken promise'. My love, I'm so sorry for not being more intentional more consistently.

Love shouldn't ever feel like that for you. In fairness, you walked away from hurt and having to ask for the minimum efforts for me to be on the same team WITH you, to stand next to you during the storms, and to hold your hand, not for me buckle and yell. I make my mistakes because I became blind. I'm sorry for this too, truly. I am fully committed to you.

And I'm so sorry I pushed you this far from me. I don't want to push you away further, so I stay here frozen. Maybe I look like a coward, but I think of it like when a little moth lands on your finger. You don't want to move to scare it away, but you can still look on and admire, to keep steady gently and not spook it away from what little closeness there is.",12,1755788369.0,Unsent_Unread_Unheard,11,0.88,False
1mwdbyu,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mwdbyu/i_asked_a_fortune_teller_to_stop_my_nightmares/,I Asked a Fortune Teller to Stop My Nightmares. Now I Don‚Äôt Know What‚Äôs Real,"I used to have nightmares when I was a kid. Not the kind that fade when you sit up and remember where you are. Mine arrived the same way every time, like a ritual I couldn‚Äôt stop.

The floorboards would  
creak once, as if someone had placed a foot beside my bed. Then I would hear a  
slow dripping, steady and patient, as if water were leaking from a tap inside  
the dark. I would hold my breath and count the drips and hope they would stop.  
They never did.

He came after the  
dripping.

The Grey Man.

He would just materialise  
out of nowhere, standing beside my bed, phasing in like something from a sci-fi  
movie. If he stood up, I knew he would be taller than the door frame. His skin  
was the colour of ash and where his eyes should have been there were two empty  
pits. His mouth was a thin line that would sometimes open into a wide smile  
showing rows of too many teeth. He would tilt his head as if I were an item he  
was deciding whether to buy.

He never climbed onto the  
bed, like you hear in some sleep paralysis dreams. He would crouch low next to  
me, bring his face close to mine and breathe in, as if smelling me the way you  
smell a book you loved as a child. Then his long hand would slide down, and  
with a gentleness that made it worse, he would take my ankle and pull me under.

Under the bed there was  
no carpet and no wood. There was a place that didn‚Äôt belong in a house at all.  
The air was hot and thick. It tasted like coins left in your mouth too long.  
Heat rolled up from the ground and made my eyes water. He would drag me along  
the rough dirt, pebbled with little shards and seeds that cut my back and arms.  
When I reached out to try and grab the walls, they were damp in a way that  
stung. Coated with an acidic gloop that you could never wipe clean. The place  
smelled like old blood, and the sweet rot you notice when you walk past a bin  
on a hot day.

There were insects  
everywhere. I could not see all of them, but I could hear them. A dry clicking  
sound from little legs. A soft buzzing from wings. The cautious rasp of  
mouthparts trying a new surface to see if it could be eaten.

Behind us there was  
nothing that looked like a way back. There were tall shapes made of the same  
hot dirt, shaped like pillars, shaped like bodies that had forgotten how to be  
people. He would pick me up and place me on a chair like I was a prized possession.  
Then he would take a thin knife from the fold of his skin, and he would begin.

He never rushed. He never  
made a sound. He would slice pieces from my arms and lay them on the ground as  
if sorting fabric. He would rest his palm on my chest to feel my heart speed up  
and slow down. He would take a strip from my cheek and watch the tear run  
around it. I begged him the way children beg and promise to be better. He  
tilted his head as if memorising the noise, but he would never stop. He never  
showed emotion, no joy, no anger.

In those dreams I  
remained alive when I shouldn‚Äôt have. There were times when the only part of me  
left was my head. I could feel the dirt under my tongue. I could feel insects  
trying the corners of my mouth and changing their minds. I could smell the heat.  
I could see him as he bent close and, for a moment, set his forehead to mine.

Then I would wake up with  
my jaw cramped and my throat raw from air I must have swallowed while I  
screamed without sound.

My parents did what they  
could. They never used words like cursed or haunted. They used words like  
specialist and appointment and therapy. I drew the Grey Man for a woman with a  
calm voice who didn‚Äôt look at my drawings when I handed them over but always  
took a moment before she turned the paper. I learned breathing exercises. I  
learned to plant my feet on the ground and list five things I could see.

The dreams didn‚Äôt stop at  
once, but they frayed at the edges. They came less often. I grew taller. I  
learned to put my hand on the bedroom light switch before I went to sleep. When  
I left for college, they did not follow me.

I told people I was a  
nervous kid who grew out of it. That was mostly true.

I am an adult now. I pay  
my bills on time. I have a decent job and a flat that is more tidy than messy.  
I do not scare easily. There is nothing in my life that looks like a horror  
story if you glance at it from the outside.

Last week I went to a  
funfair with Beth. She is the sort of friend who can talk you into trying food  
you do not recognise and rides you claim to hate. We wandered through the  
lights and the noise and the smell of hot oil.

There was a fortune  
teller‚Äôs tent set up near the far fence. It looked like it had been pitched in  
a hurry. The canvas did not match. The guy ropes were assorted colours. It was  
dark inside and too quiet, as if sound did not want to sit in there.

Beth wanted to go in. I  
didn‚Äôt, not because I was scared, more that I didn‚Äôt believe in this type of  
shite. But she said please, and it was the only thing there without a line and  
I was thinking about doughnuts.

The woman inside looked  
like she‚Äôd stepped straight out of a clich√©. Shawls, bangles, long grey hair.  
But what caught me wasn‚Äôt her. It was the bird.

A white bird, perched on  
her shoulder.

Beth smiled nervously.  
‚ÄúAww, a dove.‚Äù

The woman didn‚Äôt look up  
from her cards. ‚ÄúNot a dove,‚Äù she said. Her voice melodic. ‚ÄúA crow.‚Äù

I squinted. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs white.‚Äù

That was when she finally  
met my eyes. Her smile didn‚Äôt reach them.

‚ÄúNot everything white is  
innocent.‚Äù

Beth shivered, muttered  
something about it being pretty, then sat down.

She went first.

The woman inside took her  
hands and asked about her true desire.

The woman read her cards,  
asked her about her one true desire. Beth blushed and said something stupid  
about wanting a nice boyfriend.

I laughed and muttered,  
‚ÄúJesus, at least make it achievable. Give the old bag a chance to fake it.‚Äù

Both of them turned to  
look at me the way teachers look at you when you talk during lessons.

Beth‚Äôs turn ended with  
the rustle of a curtain of beads and the tiny chime of something metal. The  
woman lifted her eyes to me and asked me to sit.

I didn‚Äôt want to, but  
Beth gave me that look.

The chair was lower than  
I expected. It made me feel like a child.

The woman‚Äôs hands were cool,  
and her thumbs were rough where they pressed against my palms.

I made another joke about  
props and smoke machines, and she did not smile.

‚ÄúDo not insult what  
listens,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSome things are bored enough to answer.‚Äù

I raised an eyebrow. She  
looked past me and then at me, like a doctor waiting for you to say where it  
hurts.

‚ÄúI feel your resistance,‚Äù  
she said kindly.

‚ÄúBecause this isn‚Äôt  
real!‚Äù I snapped back. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a joke. A tent in a mud pit funfair with plastic  
beads on the curtains. You‚Äôre not communing with the universe; you‚Äôre just  
scamming bored people out of pocket change.‚Äù

Her expression didn‚Äôt  
shift. She simply tilted her head, birdlike.

The white crow ruffled  
its feathers, as though it had heard me.

‚ÄúEven a joke,‚Äù she said,  
‚Äúis heard somewhere.‚Äù

‚ÄúGreat,‚Äù I muttered.  
‚ÄúTell the cosmos I said hi, then.‚Äù

Her lips twitched into  
something that wasn‚Äôt quite a smile.

The crow shifted its  
claws against her shoulder, white feathers catching the lantern glow like bone.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll laugh until it  
answers,‚Äù she murmured.

Beth shot me a look, the  
kind that said *don‚Äôt start*.

I leaned back in the  
chair, folding my arms. ‚ÄúFine. Go on, tell me my fortune. Make it quick.‚Äù

The woman‚Äôs gaze didn‚Äôt  
waver. ‚ÄúWhen you mock the door,‚Äù she said softly, ‚Äúyou invite whatever waits  
behind it to knock.‚Äù

That was when she asked  
me my one true desire.

I chilled for a minute. I  
didn‚Äôt want to give the old woman a heart attack.

I told her my life was  
fine. I told her I had enough money and enough work and enough friends for the  
kind of person I am.

Then I said the only  
thing that had ever been an honest wish for me.

I said I wanted no more  
bad dreams.

Her eyes went soft and  
far away. She let go of my hands and traced circles on the tablecloth with one  
finger.

Then she said a rhyme. I  
remember it almost exactly:

Grant this woman the power  
*to see*  
*What‚Äôs good and right and true.*  
*But where the light of goodness shines,*  
*The dark will see her too.*

I felt goosebumps on my  
arms. I covered it by rolling my eyes.

I said something unkind  
about how she must do well on people desperate enough to be happy with a poem.

She looked at me for a  
long time without blinking.

‚ÄúDo not anger what you  
cannot see,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt is patient. It can wait until you forget you spoke.‚Äù

We left, and I made a  
show of being hungry and moved the conversation to food.

That night I dreamed I found  
a fifty-pound note folded into the lining of my coat. In the dream it felt  
stiff and new, with the smell of ink and the slight waxy drag against my  
fingers.

I didn‚Äôt think anything  
of it and pretty much forgot the dream as soon as I woke.

But that day, it was  
unusually cold for May. Bitterly cold.

I fished in my closet for  
my winter jacket and slipped it on. Halfway to work I slipped my hands in the  
pockets for warmth and my fingers grazed something hard.

I pulled it out.

It was a red envelope  
with my name on the front, still sealed.

I opened it cautiously  
and lifted the sparkly Christmas card from the paper.

On one side it read:

Merry Christmas, lots of  
*love, Grandma xxx*

And on the other, a  
neatly folded ¬£50 note was stuck to the side with tape.

I must admit, I was a bit  
like ‚Äúno way‚Äù at first. But then I thought, people forget to open Christmas  
cards all the time, right? Just a coincidence, I told myself. I wasn‚Äôt  
impressed.

The next night I dreamed  
that the woman at work who collects complaints like stamps would call in sick.

She did.

I told myself that one  
was almost predictable. She had coughed the day before.

On the third night I  
dreamed that I was eating the most delicious bowl of strawberries and cream I  
had ever eaten.

In the morning there were  
strawberries in the fridge, now I don‚Äôt buy strawberries as a rule. I‚Äôll eat them at restaurants, but I won‚Äôt have them in my fridge.

You buy them on a Monday  
and by Tuesday night they have grown their own mould colony and have elected a  
mayor.

I checked my banking app  
to see if I had bought them half-asleep the night before. No charge.

I told myself I must have  
paid cash and forgotten.

I ate one and it tasted  
like a memory of summer. So sweet and fresh.

On the fifth night I  
dreamed of Beth. I dreamed she won a ridiculous prize at a ring toss.

In the morning, she sent  
me a photo of herself with a teddy as big as she is and a message that said *I am finally a winner* and a row of hearts.

I asked which fair. She  
said not the same one, she had gone with a ‚Äúnew guy friend.‚Äù

On the sixth night I  
dreamed of rain.

It poured in the dream,  
and everyone on the street ran.

I dreamed I stepped under  
a doorway that didn‚Äôt leak, and the person beside me stepped aside so I could  
fit.

When I woke up and went  
to work the sky broke while I was walking. The doorway I chose did not leak. A  
stranger moved over with a smile.

He handed me a napkin. He  
said I looked like I needed a win today.

I stopped telling myself  
it was nothing. I still tried to pretend, but it wasn‚Äôt a true pretending.

On the eighth night I had  
a different kind of dream.

I was in my room in the  
dark.

I couldn‚Äôt move.

The floorboard by the  
door creaked.

The sound wasn‚Äôt loud,  
but it was near the kind of volume that fills a whole house if it‚Äôs quiet.

Then there was the  
dripping again. It came from everywhere at once, as if every surface had been  
given one drop and told not to waste it.

I woke up with my heart  
climbing the wall of my chest.

I did not sit up. I lay  
still and I listened.

The house is old and does  
what old houses do. Pipes expand. Nails settle. Wood flexes.

The difference was that I  
knew the rhythm of this house.

This creak was not the  
same.

I could point to where it  
came from in the dark. It was the board by the door.

The rain was still  
pouring outside. I could see droplets dripping steadily from the window frame,  
but this wasn‚Äôt the same.

It was slow enough to  
make me count it and then lose count.

I could smell a dampness  
that didn‚Äôt belong to a leak.

I didn‚Äôt go to work that  
day.

I sat on the sofa in a  
daze, hands shaking as I sipped the same cup of cold coffee I‚Äôd held for four  
hours.

I didn‚Äôt understand what  
was happening.

I was so focused on the  
good things I was getting, I forgot I could have bad dreams too.

I stayed up as late as I  
could, refusing to go into the bedroom. But by 1 a.m. I couldn‚Äôt stay awake.

I dreamed I was back  
under the bed.

The air was hot, and the  
smell of iron sat on my tongue.

I was strapped to the  
same chair from my childhood.

He was there. The grey  
man.

Standing in front of me,  
that emotionless stare piercing my soul.

He took a step forward.

I thrashed and pulled at  
the restraints, desperate to get free.

He stopped, tilted his  
head, and placed a white envelope on my lap.

I woke up panting, hair  
stuck to my sweat-covered forehead.

My wrists ached and by  
the morning, small bruises had formed like faint ligature marks.

I came down the stairs to  
a small white envelope posted through my door with no stamp.

Inside it was a note that  
said:

*Keep sleeping well.*

The font was cheerful.  
The ink smelled faintly of almond oil.

I stood very still  
holding it and listening for the drip.

Last night I didn‚Äôt want  
to sleep.

I made tea. I watched  
shows that don‚Äôt require attention. I texted until my phone felt hot in my  
hands.

At 3 in the morning, I  
was tired enough to promise myself that fear is fuel and sleep isn‚Äôt the enemy.

I lay down.

I told myself that I had  
invented patterns because the fortune teller had given me a poem.

I reminded myself that I  
am not twelve years old.

I didn‚Äôt dream.

I woke just before 5  
a.m., exhausted. I lay in the dark willing myself to go back to sleep just a  
little longer.

I squeezed my eyes shut  
and that‚Äôs when I heard it‚Äî

The floorboard by the  
door gave its single careful creak.

I kept my eyes closed.

I told myself that if I  
could not see, nothing could see me.

Then the dripping began.

It was closer than it had  
ever been.

I opened my eyes and,  
barely moving, I tried to look at the slot of dark under the bed.

The smell of heat and  
metal pushed up over the edge like breath.

I reached one hand out  
and placed it flat on the floor only to prove that I could.

The wood was cold.

And then something in the  
dark below touched the other side of the board as if answering the gesture.

The board lifted against  
my palm with the weight of a measured hand.

I pulled my hand back and  
sat up.

I clicked on the lamp.

The room was the same as  
it had been.

The tall bookcase. The  
plant that did a trick for me last week. The frail curtains. The bed.

I told myself not to be  
dramatic.

The fortune teller had  
told nothing more than a fairy tale.

She could have said it to  
anyone.

And of course it would  
work sometimes. The world is full of coincidences.

I clicked the light off  
and tried to remember the therapist‚Äôs advice from so long ago.

My eyes grew heavy.

Five things I can see.  
Lamp.  
Door.  
Bed.  
Blankets.  
Book.

Four things I could touch.  
My blanket.  
My hair.  
My t-shirt.  
My nightstand.

Three I could hear.  
My heartbeat.  
My breathing.  
Dripping‚Ä¶

Two I could smell.  
Iron‚Ä¶  
Rot.

One I could taste.  
Old‚Ä¶ coins.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I whispered.

My eyes snapped open.

The dripping sound was  
louder now.

Like something wet was  
seeping through the ceiling.

Except there was no  
stain. No leak.

And the smell‚ÄîGod, the  
smell‚Äîfilled my throat until I was swallowing it.

It was the exact same as  
when I was a kid. Heat. Dirt. That metallic tang of rust and blood.

The floorboards creaked.

Not in the house. Not  
somewhere far away.

Right outside my door.

I held my breath, waiting  
for the sound to stop, but it didn‚Äôt.

Each groan of wood bent  
closer. Slow. Deliberate.

The therapist‚Äôs advice  
was gone.

The old woman‚Äôs words  
were all I could hear:

Do not insult what listens.  
*Some things are bored enough to answer.*

And I realised‚Äî

I had asked for no more  
bad dreams.

But maybe I‚Äôd given it  
permission to step into the waking world instead.

The door creaked open.

The Grey Man stood tall,  
grinning, his teeth reflecting in the moonlight.

He uttered one word:

*‚ÄúReady.‚Äù*

And then he vanished.

I think I screamed until  
morning.

I decided to go back to  
the fair.

I was going to find the  
tent, the old woman, and the dove-crow thing and tell her to undo what she did.

But‚Ä¶ when I got there, it  
was gone.

The whole fair had packed  
up and moved on.

I managed to catch the  
owner of the teacup ride before he drove off and asked him where they were  
going next.

He made a comment about  
me being a carney chaser and I clapped back with something witty‚Ä¶ honestly, I  
was too exhausted to remember.

Basically, I just wanted  
to find the fortune teller.

He frowned at me like I‚Äôd  
just asked him where the dragons were kept.

‚ÄúThe fair doesn‚Äôt have a  
fortune teller,‚Äù he said flatly.

I actually laughed, even  
though my throat felt like it was closing.

‚ÄúYeah, sure. Old woman.  
White bird. Creepy rhymes. You can‚Äôt miss her.‚Äù

He shook his head,  
climbed into the cab, and muttered something about weirdos before slamming the  
door.

The truck pulled away,  
leaving me in the half-empty lot with a stomach that felt like wet cement.

I stood there for way too  
long, hoping maybe the striped tent would flicker into view if I just stared  
hard enough.

It didn‚Äôt.

So now I‚Äôm stuck with  
this‚Äîwhatever she gave me.

I can‚Äôt make sense of it.

I can‚Äôt make it stop.

And the part that really  
scares me?

Last night wasn‚Äôt a dream.

So, what will happen when  
the Grey Man takes me away \[again?\](https://www.youtube.com/@midnightcreepypasta0)

ARTICLE STARTS:

Hi everyone, and welcome to a special edition of Game On about a very special game that we‚Äôll be playing quite soon.

The wait is over
It‚Äôs surreal to write, but it‚Äôs true: Silksong will be out on Sept. 4.

After six years of near-total silence from the developers and enough feverish anticipation to make it the most wish-listed game on Steam, the sequel to the indie hit Hollow Knight is releasing in two weeks. Team Cherry, the small team behind both games, announced the news Thursday in a trailer.

Why did it take so long?

Often, such protracted development cycles are caused by mismanagement and result in painful burnout among the staff. But speaking to me last week on a video call from their office in Adelaide, Australia, Team Cherry Co-Founders Ari Gibson and William Pellen said that making Silksong has been nothing but a joyful process.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been having fun,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúThis whole thing is just a vehicle for our creativity anyway. It‚Äôs nice to make fun things.‚Äù

The lengthy production wasn‚Äôt the result of development challenges or obstacles, they said. They just needed all these years to ensure that Silksong was exactly the game they wanted to make.

‚ÄúIt was never stuck or anything,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúIt was always progressing. It‚Äôs just the case that we‚Äôre a small team, and games take a lot of time. There wasn‚Äôt any big controversial moment behind it.‚Äù

The Silksong saga started in 2017 when Team Cherry released Hollow Knight, an action-platformer set in a vast world full of cartoon bugs. A Switch version, released the following year, added to the momentum. By the end of 2018, millions of fans were raving about its polished gameplay, distinct style and impeccable vibes. As of today, the game has sold 15 million copies, Team Cherry told me, making it one of the most successful independent video games ever.

Initially, Gibson and Pellen had planned to release an expansion pack revolving around Hornet, one of its key characters. But in February 2019, they announced that the expansion had grown too big and would instead become a full-fledged sequel, titled Silksong.

Hollow Knight had been massive, and their plan at the outset was to build a smaller world for Silksong. To ensure that the game felt just as deep, they‚Äôd implement an elaborate quest system that would offer the player reasons to backtrack and revisit old locations. In contrast to Hollow Knight, which had a single town full of shops and characters to meet, there would also be multiple towns, each serving as a hub for quests.

‚ÄúEven at that point we were recognizing that it was going to become another giant thing to rival the scale of Hollow Knight or probably exceed it,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúAnd then because of how we work, obviously the world ended up being just as big or bigger. And the quest system existed. And the multiple towns existed. Suddenly you end up six, seven years later.‚Äù

It all came down to their development style, which may have been too much fun. Gibson and Pellen ‚Äî who were joined by programmer Jack Vine, composer Chris Larkin and a few contractors who helped with programming and testing ‚Äî started off by designing the core gameplay for Hornet, the game‚Äôs slick protagonist. From there, it was easy to implement and test out new ideas, even as the game grew bigger.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre very fortunate that we have a development method that is so enjoyable,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúNot exactly sure how we stumbled into that. Everything comes together quickly. You can see results fast. Ideas turn into something that exist in the game almost immediately before your eyes, and that‚Äôs very satisfying. And that allows you to go off on those tangents and meet weird characters because someone‚Äôs off-handedly mentioned a weird character as an idea and the other person‚Äôs laughed, and that‚Äôs enough.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre always working on a new idea, new item, new area, new boss,‚Äù Pellen said. ‚ÄúThat stuff‚Äôs so nice. It‚Äôs for the sake of just completing the game that we‚Äôre stopping. We could have kept going.‚Äù

The downside of this methodology was that it could have lasted forever.

‚ÄúI remember at some point I just had to stop sketching,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúBecause I went, ‚ÄòEverything I‚Äôm drawing here has to end up in the game. That‚Äôs a cool idea, that‚Äôs in. That‚Äôs a cool idea, that‚Äôs in.‚Äô You realize, ‚ÄòIf I don‚Äôt stop drawing, this is going to take 15 years to finish.‚Äô‚Äù

During the development of Hollow Knight, Gibson and Pellen frequently posted game updates and talked to players. At the end of 2019, Team Cherry posted one more update about Silksong, then went silent ‚Äî much to fans‚Äô dismay.

‚ÄúWe felt like continued updates were just going to sour people on the whole thing,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúBecause all we could really say is, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre still working on it.‚Äô‚Äù

They wanted to be particularly cautious about avoiding spoilers. Much of the thrill of Hollow Knight came from accidentally stumbling upon secret passageways or breaking down walls to find hidden bugs. Silksong has plenty of its own secrets that they didn‚Äôt want to detail before the release.

Plus, they thought Silksong would be out much sooner.

‚ÄúInstead of popping up and bugging people for the sake of it, it felt like our actual responsibility was just to work on the game,‚Äù Pellen said. ‚ÄúProbably at the time we thought we‚Äôd go quiet for a year or two, then the game would come out.‚Äù

In 2020, as Covid disrupted most video-game productions around the world, Adelaide was able to stave off the worst of the pandemic, going months without new cases, which allowed Gibson and Pellen to continue plugging along on Silksong. ‚ÄúSeems a little odd knowing that the rest of the world has such a dramatic and isolating period,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúHere we were, going to caf√©s and having brunch.‚Äù

Silksong briefly resurfaced in 2022 during an Xbox event, which promised that all of the games shown would be out within a year. Xbox doubled down on Twitter, saying the Hollow Knight sequel would be out before June 2023.

At the time, they all thought it was true. ‚ÄúWe did genuinely believe that was the case,‚Äù Pellen said. ‚ÄúThere was a period of two to three years when I thought it was going to come out within a year.‚Äù

But the game kept growing. Silksong has more elaborate bosses than Hollow Knight, more gameplay systems and more interactivity. Gibson and Pellen wanted objects in the world to react to Hornet‚Äôs various tools, which required a ton of drawing and animation work.

‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre always underestimating the amount of time and effort it‚Äôll take us to achieve things,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also that problem where, because we‚Äôre having fun doing it, it‚Äôs not like, ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs taking longer, this is awful, we really need to get past this phase.‚Äô It‚Äôs, ‚ÄòThis is a very enjoyable space to be in. Let‚Äôs perpetuate this with some new ideas.‚Äô‚Äù

The longer development lasted, the more pressure Gibson and Pellen felt to ensure that everything was as fine-tuned as possible. They‚Äôd already spent four years on it ‚Äî why would they rush now? The more time they spent polishing some parts, the more time they needed to apply it consistently across the rest.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a level of finish that has to be met throughout the entire game,‚Äù Pellen said. ‚ÄúAll the way the systems interact, all the hidden work that pops up later on. It‚Äôs multiplicative. As you add stuff, the process of tying it all back together just increases.‚Äù

Throughout development, Team Cherry remained tiny, which may have extended the production time but also saved them from the slog of having to manage and delegate. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want to mess with the formula and then find out it‚Äôs not fun,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúI used to manage teams in past lives. I don‚Äôt really want to do that ever again.‚Äù

Staying small also meant eschewing the production practices commonplace at many game-development studios.

‚ÄúWhat is Jira?‚Äù Gibson said when I asked if they used the task-management application.

‚ÄúIs it a software?‚Äù Pellen said, adding that they‚Äôd briefly used Trello before their account was deactivated because they didn‚Äôt use it enough.



As development dragged on, the hype for Silksong grew more feverishScreenshot: Team Cherry
Perhaps the biggest reason Silksong took so long was that Team Cherry never had to worry about the one thing that keeps other independent developers awake at night: money.

During the production of Hollow Knight, they‚Äôd stayed lean, sometimes living off leftover triangle sandwiches that their office neighbor would bring them after meetings. ‚ÄúMy dad would sometimes pop up and give me $20,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd be like, ‚ÄòOh, I‚Äôm having coffee today!‚Äô‚Äù

Thanks to their first game‚Äôs massive financial success, Gibson and Pellen no longer have to scrounge leftovers. For Pellen, who has two kids and a third on the way, that‚Äôs provided an inestimable peace of mind. For Gibson, who said he spends most of his time at the office, it hasn‚Äôt changed much. ‚ÄúI live in a very basic two-bedroom apartment,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSometimes I think, ‚ÄòYou know what would be better, is a one-bedroom apartment.‚Äô Because then there‚Äôs even less to maintain.‚Äù

The game has continued to generate revenue by reaching new players, perhaps in large part due to the Silksong buzz. When the studio announced Silksong in February 2019, Hollow Knight had sold 2.8 million copies. The game has sold another 12 million copies since then, allowing Team Cherry to keep working on the sequel indefinitely without having to worry about running out of funds.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre very lucky in that regard,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt ever really think about it that much. Maybe that‚Äôs the privilege of it.‚Äù

As the years went on, the hype kept building. A Reddit forum dedicated to the game filled up with nonsensical blabber and made-up tweets, which users called ‚Äúsilkposts,‚Äù a variation on the expletive. Meanwhile, chat sections for video-game livestreams and Nintendo Direct events were plagued with the same feral messages repeated over and over: ‚ÄúSilksong when?‚Äù

Gibson and Pellen tuned it all out, rarely going online. They say they never read comments on YouTube or Reddit, although occasionally friends or family would send them some of the funniest ones.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice that people are passionate about the game, and that they‚Äôve obviously formed their own strange or very exciting communities around it,‚Äù Gibson said.

‚ÄúFeels like we‚Äôre going to ruin their fun by releasing the game,‚Äù Pellen said.

Once in a while, people would show up at the Team Cherry office, sometimes with their children, perhaps hoping for a Willy Wonka type experience. Inevitably, they were disappointed by what they found instead. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a grubby room with cardboard boxes,‚Äù Gibson said.

Their walls remain the same dull avocado color that they were when Team Cherry moved in more than a decade ago. They never even put up art. They‚Äôve been too busy making the game.

In early 2025, Gibson and Pellen began to see the finish line and started making plans to release the game in the fall. Players desperate for information devoured every scrap of news ‚Äî like the announcement that it would be playable at a museum in September ‚Äî hoping this might finally be the year.

Both Nintendo Co. and Microsoft Corp.‚Äôs Xbox said during live events this year that Silksong was planned for 2025, but fans were cautious. They‚Äôd been down this road before.

Meanwhile, Team Cherry kept working. The shape of the game has been finalized for a while, Pellen said. The last year or two has been all about the details ‚Äî adding small encounters, polishing everything and tying it all together.

And they‚Äôre still working to finalize things until the last possible minute. As we spoke, with Silksong a little more than three weeks out, I spotted programmer Jack Vine in the background, tweaking code for one of the game‚Äôs console ports.

Gibson and Pellen say they‚Äôre happy that the game is finally coming out ‚Äî and even happier that they will get to keep working on it, which they still find enjoyable even after seven years. They haven‚Äôt burned out or shown any desire to take a break. Instead, they‚Äôre already making big plans to add extra content to Silksong in the months and years to come.

‚ÄúLaunching it is obviously quite exciting,‚Äù Pellen said. ‚ÄúWhat comes after for us is equally as exciting.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe most interesting thing now is what can we add to it next,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúWe got a plan. Admittedly, some of the plans for that stuff are kind of ambitious as well, but hopefully we can achieve some of it.‚Äù

Scattered in between are QSRs‚Äîpoke bowls, smoothie bars, and casual seafood shacks‚Äîoffering affordable options for families and locals.

Further down, an event space hosts live music and pop-up markets, drawing people to stroll, shop, and grab a drink.

I had been managing it with the Mirafast chews.  I take just one at night before bed and then if things still aren't moving in the morning, I'll take another one and usually by the time I've had my morning iced coffee, things start to work.  However, I feel as if I'm either having diarrhea in the mornings or absolutely unable to go the rest of the day.  So I take another at night and start the cycle all over again. 

I've seen a lot of praise for the Mag07 here and how it really helps regulate. I'm wondering if any of you who use the Mag07 can tell me if the capsule form works as well as the powder.  I'm pretty averse to most powder forms of supplement or medications,  I just don't like the taste or texture they make most things and in general, as a personal preference, I just usually prefer a to take a pill.  If there's a big difference in efficacy, I can certainly do the powder but if they're the same, that would be great.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pok√©mon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Hi everyone, and welcome to a special edition of Game On about a very special game that we‚Äôll be playing quite soon.

# The wait is over

It‚Äôs surreal to write, but it‚Äôs true:¬†*Silksong*¬†will be out on Sept. 4.

After six years of near-total silence from the developers and enough feverish anticipation to make it the most wish-listed game on Steam, the sequel to the indie hit¬†*Hollow Knight*¬†is releasing in two weeks. Team Cherry, the small team behind both games, announced the news¬†[Thursday in a trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGeJwsUP9c).

Why did it take so long?

Often, such protracted development cycles are¬†[caused by mismanagement](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-10/why-so-many-video-games-cost-so-much-to-make)¬†and result in painful burnout among the staff. But speaking to me last week on a video call from their office in Adelaide, Australia, Team Cherry Co-Founders Ari Gibson and William Pellen said that making¬†*Silksong*¬†has been nothing but a joyful process.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been having fun,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúThis whole thing is just a vehicle for our creativity anyway. It‚Äôs nice to make fun things.‚Äù

The lengthy production wasn‚Äôt the result of development challenges or obstacles, they said. They just needed all these years to ensure that¬†*Silksong*¬†was exactly the game they wanted to make.

‚ÄúIt was never stuck or anything,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúIt was always progressing. It‚Äôs just the case that we‚Äôre a small team, and games take a lot of time. There wasn‚Äôt any big controversial moment behind it.‚Äù

The¬†*Silksong*¬†saga started in 2017 when Team Cherry released¬†*Hollow Knight*, an action-platformer set in¬†[a vast world full of cartoon bugs](https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-the-kotaku-review-1827367425). A Switch version, released the following year, added to the momentum. By the end of 2018, millions of fans were raving about its polished gameplay, distinct style and impeccable vibes. As of today, the game has sold 15 million copies, Team Cherry told me, making it one of the most successful independent video games ever.

Initially, Gibson and Pellen had planned to release an expansion pack revolving around Hornet, one of its key characters. But in February 2019, they announced that¬†[the expansion had grown too big](https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/hollow-knight-silksong-revealed)¬†and would instead become a full-fledged sequel, titled¬†*Silksong*.

*Hollow Knight*¬†had been massive, and their plan at the outset was to build a smaller world for¬†*Silksong*. To ensure that the game felt just as deep, they‚Äôd implement an elaborate quest system that would offer the player reasons to backtrack and revisit old locations. In contrast to¬†*Hollow Knight*, which had a single town full of shops and characters to meet, there would also be multiple towns, each serving as a hub for quests.

‚ÄúEven at that point we were recognizing that it was going to become another giant thing to rival the scale of¬†*Hollow Knight*¬†or probably exceed it,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúAnd then because of how we work, obviously the world ended up being just as big or bigger. And the quest system existed. And the multiple towns existed. Suddenly you end up six, seven years later.‚Äù

It all came down to their development style, which may have been too much fun. Gibson and Pellen ‚Äî who were joined by programmer Jack Vine, composer Chris Larkin and a few contractors who helped with programming and testing ‚Äî started off by designing the core gameplay for Hornet, the game‚Äôs slick protagonist. From there, it was easy to implement and test out new ideas, even as the game grew bigger.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre very fortunate that we have a development method that is so enjoyable,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúNot exactly sure how we stumbled into that. Everything comes together quickly. You can see results fast. Ideas turn into something that exist in the game almost immediately before your eyes, and that‚Äôs very satisfying. And that allows you to go off on those tangents and meet weird characters because someone‚Äôs off-handedly mentioned a weird character as an idea and the other person‚Äôs laughed, and that‚Äôs enough.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre always working on a new idea, new item, new area, new boss,‚Äù Pellen said. ‚ÄúThat stuff‚Äôs so nice. It‚Äôs for the sake of just completing the game that we‚Äôre stopping. We could have kept going.‚Äù

The downside of this methodology was that it could have lasted forever.

‚ÄúI remember at some point I just had to stop sketching,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúBecause I went, ‚ÄòEverything I‚Äôm drawing here has to end up in the game. That‚Äôs a cool idea, that‚Äôs in. That‚Äôs a cool idea, that‚Äôs in.‚Äô You realize, ‚ÄòIf I don‚Äôt stop drawing, this is going to take 15 years to finish.‚Äô‚Äù

During the development of¬†*Hollow Knight*, Gibson and Pellen frequently posted game updates and talked to players. At the end of 2019, Team Cherry posted¬†[one more update](https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/11xf7azcuebhybgossfhdc0mphiqbs)¬†about¬†*Silksong*, then went silent ‚Äî much to fans‚Äô dismay.

‚ÄúWe felt like continued updates were just going to sour people on the whole thing,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúBecause all we could really say is, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre still working on it.‚Äô‚Äù

They wanted to be particularly cautious about avoiding spoilers. Much of the thrill of¬†*Hollow Knight*¬†came from accidentally stumbling upon secret passageways or breaking down walls to find hidden bugs.¬†*Silksong*¬†has plenty of its own secrets that they didn‚Äôt want to detail before the release.

Plus, they thought¬†*Silksong*¬†would be out much sooner.

‚ÄúInstead of popping up and bugging people for the sake of it, it felt like our actual responsibility was just to work on the game,‚Äù Pellen said. ‚ÄúProbably at the time we thought we‚Äôd go quiet for a year or two, then the game would come out.‚Äù

In 2020, as Covid disrupted most video-game productions around the world, Adelaide was able to stave off the worst of the pandemic, going months without new cases, which allowed Gibson and Pellen to continue plugging along on¬†*Silksong*. ‚ÄúSeems a little odd knowing that the rest of the world has such a dramatic and isolating period,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúHere we were, going to caf√©s and having brunch.‚Äù

*Silksong*¬†briefly resurfaced in 2022 during an Xbox event, which promised that all of the games shown would be out within a year. Xbox doubled down on Twitter, saying the¬†*Hollow Knight*¬†sequel¬†[would be out before June 2023](https://x.com/Xbox/status/1536035818275487746).

At the time, they all thought it was true. ‚ÄúWe did genuinely believe that was the case,‚Äù Pellen said. ‚ÄúThere was a period of two to three years when I thought it was going to come out within a year.‚Äù

But the game kept growing.¬†*Silksong*¬†has more elaborate bosses than¬†*Hollow Knight*, more gameplay systems and more interactivity. Gibson and Pellen wanted objects in the world to react to Hornet‚Äôs various tools, which required a ton of drawing and animation work.

‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre always underestimating the amount of time and effort it‚Äôll take us to achieve things,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also that problem where, because we‚Äôre having fun doing it, it‚Äôs not like, ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs taking longer, this is awful, we really need to get past this phase.‚Äô It‚Äôs, ‚ÄòThis is a very enjoyable space to be in. Let‚Äôs perpetuate this with some new ideas.‚Äô‚Äù

The longer development lasted, the more pressure Gibson and Pellen felt to ensure that everything was as fine-tuned as possible. They‚Äôd already spent four years on it ‚Äî why would they rush now? The more time they spent polishing some parts, the more time they needed to apply it consistently across the rest.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a level of finish that has to be met throughout the entire game,‚Äù Pellen said. ‚ÄúAll the way the systems interact, all the hidden work that pops up later on. It‚Äôs multiplicative. As you add stuff, the process of tying it all back together just increases.‚Äù

Throughout development, Team Cherry remained tiny, which may have extended the production time but also saved them from the slog of having to manage and delegate. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want to mess with the formula and then find out it‚Äôs not fun,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúI used to manage teams in past lives. I don‚Äôt really want to do that ever again.‚Äù

Staying small also meant eschewing the production practices commonplace at many game-development studios.

‚ÄúWhat is Jira?‚Äù Gibson said when I asked if they used the task-management application.

‚ÄúIs it a software?‚Äù Pellen said, adding that they‚Äôd briefly used Trello before their account was deactivated because they didn‚Äôt use it enough.

As development dragged on, the hype for¬†*Silksong*¬†grew more feverish*Screenshot: Team Cherry*

Perhaps the biggest reason¬†*Silksong*¬†took so long was that Team Cherry never had to worry about the one thing that keeps other independent developers awake at night: money.

During the production of¬†*Hollow Knight*, they‚Äôd stayed lean, sometimes living off leftover triangle sandwiches that their office neighbor would bring them after meetings. ‚ÄúMy dad would sometimes pop up and give me $20,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd be like, ‚ÄòOh, I‚Äôm having coffee today!‚Äô‚Äù

Thanks to their first game‚Äôs massive financial success, Gibson and Pellen no longer have to scrounge leftovers. For Pellen, who has two kids and a third on the way, that‚Äôs provided an inestimable peace of mind. For Gibson, who said he spends most of his time at the office, it hasn‚Äôt changed much. ‚ÄúI live in a very basic two-bedroom apartment,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSometimes I think, ‚ÄòYou know what would be better, is a one-bedroom apartment.‚Äô Because then there‚Äôs even less to maintain.‚Äù

The game has continued to generate revenue by reaching new players, perhaps in large part due to the¬†*Silksong*¬†buzz. When the studio announced¬†*Silksong*¬†in February 2019,¬†*Hollow Knight*¬†had sold 2.8 million copies. The game has sold another 12 million copies since then, allowing Team Cherry to keep working on¬†the sequel indefinitely without having to worry about running out of funds.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre very lucky in that regard,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt ever really think about it that much. Maybe that‚Äôs the privilege of it.‚Äù

As the years went on, the hype kept building. A Reddit forum¬†[dedicated to the game](https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/)¬†filled up with nonsensical blabber and made-up tweets, which users called ‚Äúsilkposts,‚Äù a variation on the expletive. Meanwhile, chat sections for video-game livestreams and Nintendo Direct events were plagued with the same feral messages repeated over and over: ‚Äú*Silksong*¬†when?‚Äù

Gibson and Pellen tuned it all out, rarely going online. They say they never read comments on YouTube or Reddit, although occasionally friends or family would send them some of the funniest ones.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice that people are passionate about the game, and that they‚Äôve obviously formed their own strange or very exciting communities around it,‚Äù Gibson said.

‚ÄúFeels like we‚Äôre going to ruin their fun by releasing the game,‚Äù Pellen said.

Once in a while, people would show up at the Team Cherry office, sometimes with their children, perhaps hoping for a Willy Wonka type experience. Inevitably, they were disappointed by what they found instead. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a grubby room with cardboard boxes,‚Äù Gibson said.

Their walls remain the same dull avocado color that they were when Team Cherry moved in more than a decade ago. They never even put up art. They‚Äôve been too busy making the game.

In early 2025, Gibson and Pellen began to see the finish line and started making plans to release the game in the fall. Players desperate for information devoured every scrap of news ‚Äî like the announcement that it would be¬†[playable at a museum in September](https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-will-be-playable-in-september-2025-at-an-australian-museum)¬†‚Äî hoping this might finally be the year.

Both Nintendo Co. and Microsoft Corp.‚Äôs Xbox said during live events this year that¬†*Silksong*¬†was planned for 2025, but fans were cautious. They‚Äôd been down this road before.

Meanwhile, Team Cherry kept working. The shape of the game has been finalized for a while, Pellen said. The last year or two has been all about the details ‚Äî adding small encounters, polishing everything and tying it all together.

And they‚Äôre still working to finalize things until the last possible minute. As we spoke, with¬†*Silksong*¬†a little more than three weeks out, I spotted programmer Jack Vine in the background, tweaking code for one of the game‚Äôs console ports.

Gibson and Pellen say they‚Äôre happy that the game is finally coming out ‚Äî and even happier that they will get to keep working on it, which they still find enjoyable even after seven years. They haven‚Äôt burned out or shown any desire to take a break. Instead, they‚Äôre already making big plans to add extra content to¬†*Silksong*¬†in the months and years to come.

‚ÄúLaunching it is obviously quite exciting,‚Äù Pellen said. ‚ÄúWhat comes after for us is equally as exciting.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe most interesting thing now is what can we add to it next,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúWe got a plan. Admittedly, some of the plans for that stuff are kind of ambitious as well, but hopefully we can achieve some of it.‚Äù

Stay tuned for 2032 to see how that turns out.",1153,1755787538.0,Silksong,233,1.0,False

**\[><><><><><><><><><><><><><\]**



The engine of the old, barely-breathing car howled as Lieutenant Neil drove further along the asphalt road, its surface cracked and clawed over by creeping roots and weeds. Before them stretched a silence so deep it felt unnatural‚Äîno birds, no wind, only the dying hum of the motor and the crunch of rubber against fractured stone.

‚ÄúAll right‚Ä¶‚Äù Colonel Zelfour yawned, his voice heavy with exhaustion as he blinked his tired eyes. ‚ÄúAre we there yet?‚Äù

‚ÄúAlmost, Colonel,‚Äù Neil replied with unmistakable relief, his hand steady on the wheel as he pointed toward a road sign jutting from the undergrowth. The iron plate leaned crooked, rust having eaten its edges, but the letters‚Äîhalf-swallowed by corrosion‚Äîstill spelled out a name: **Institute.**

‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt far now,‚Äù he added, tightening his grip on the steering wheel.

‚ÄúSo,‚Äù Major Diborah spoke at last, her sharp gaze fixed on the horizon where ruined buildings lurked in the distance, ‚Äúwhat can we expect? Is it a large facility?‚Äù

‚ÄúLarge enough. At least a hundred soldiers, with a handful of professors and scientists,‚Äù Neil answered, his tone carrying a faint warmth. ‚ÄúThey were kind people, most of them. I even knew an old fellow there‚ÄîBernard. Good man. Gentle sort. Wore a short white beard, dark welfare glasses, always with a cowboy hat perched on his head.‚Äù

Zelfour‚Äôs weary eyes drifted to the window on his left. ‚ÄúThat the same old man you speak of?‚Äù His voice slowed. ‚ÄúWhite beard, glasses, cowboy hat?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Neil replied, smiling faintly at the memory. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs him. How do you‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause that‚Äôs his body hanging there,‚Äù Zelfour interrupted, pointing outward.

Neil‚Äôs words died in his throat. Diborah squinted, her eyes narrowing as the car rolled past.

Her gaze climbed beyond the rusted sign, following the high-voltage lines that stretched across the horizon like veins of iron. Against the pale blue of the sky, something swayed‚Äîa dark shape, gently rocking in the wind.

‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶

She froze.

‚ÄúMotherfucker‚Ä¶‚Äù Diborah whispered‚Äînot in her usual tone of calculated steel, but with the breath of one struck by raw, unguarded shock. Her jaw tightened, and her voice dropped low, cold with disbelief. ‚ÄúNeil. Stop the car.‚Äù

Lieutenant Neil slammed the brakes. The worn wheels screamed against the cracked asphalt, and a sinister silence fell heavy inside the car.

‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs impossible‚Ä¶‚Äù Neil was already out of the vehicle, stumbling a few paces toward the pole before Major Diborah caught his arm and dragged him back.

‚ÄúFuck, fuck‚Ä¶ not you, you old bastard‚Ä¶‚Äù He tore free, running the rest of the way, his boots crunching over broken stone until he stood at the base of the power pole. His chest heaved as his eyes locked on the swaying corpse. ‚ÄúH-how?‚Äù Neil whispered hoarsely, one hand covering his face as if the sight itself might burn him.

‚ÄúNo one leaves bodies strung up in the open like this,‚Äù Diborah said quietly, her voice edged with iron as her brows knit together. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a warning. A deliberate one.‚Äù She lifted a gloved finger toward the body, her gaze cold. ‚ÄúReminds me far too much of the front‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI know, Major,‚Äù the colonel sighed, frowning slightly at the sight of the corpse. ‚ÄúHe must‚Äôve been hanging for a few days already, though biology and physics don‚Äôt mean shit in this Limbo.‚Äù He scoffed, eyeing the gray, lifeless skin, now partially covered in some strange green growth. ‚ÄúFucking monsters must‚Äôve left us a message.‚Äù

‚Äú‚ÄòDon‚Äôt go further or you‚Äôll die‚Äô?‚Äù Diborah snorted sarcastically.

¬†‚ÄúPossibly.‚Äù The colonel nodded. ‚ÄúThough it‚Äôs not the only warning‚Ä¶‚Äù He pointed down the road, where more bodies hung from power poles. Some were torn apart alive, others overgrown with strange moss‚Ä¶ and some were reduced to mere skeletons.

**Soldiers.**

**Civilians.**

**Scientists.**

They hung alone or in pairs, twisted into grotesque silhouettes. Uniforms were shredded, faces beaten raw and frozen in eternal screams. Each body bore a sign tied to its chest, swaying lightly in the stale wind:

**‚ÄúTURN BACK.‚Äù**

**‚ÄúTHE CITY IS LOST.‚Äù**

**‚ÄúTHEY ARE NO LONGER ASLEEP.‚Äù**

‚ÄúWhat happened here?‚Äù Major Diborah asked slowly, her voice low, fingers tightening around the cold stock of his Prince Rifle.

Colonel Zelfour swallowed, his Adam‚Äôs apple bobbing as unease crept into his tone. ‚ÄúThe monsters must have breached the Institute‚Ä¶‚Äù he whispered, clutching his pistol as though it might suddenly leap to life in his hand. ‚ÄúIt would take a hell of a horde to tear through defenses that strong.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood morning,‚Äù Mr. Gerden muttered grimly, his brow furrowing as he lifted his rifle, eyes darting between the shadows ahead.

Lieutenant Neil did not respond. He only stared at the swaying corpse of the old man he once knew. The rope bit cruelly into the neck, forcing the body to loll forward, as though mocking him with every sway. The man‚Äôs glasses dangled broken on his face, one lens fractured, the other catching the last scraps of light.

‚ÄúThe Institute has fallen,‚Äù Lieutenant Neil finally whispered. His voice cracked as if the words themselves cut him raw. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not possible‚Ä¶ Bernard‚Ä¶ he always‚Ä¶ always pulled through.‚Äù He drew a shuddering breath, then steadied himself. ‚ÄúO-okay‚Ä¶‚Äù Slowly, he moved back toward the car, pulling open the rear door and drawing out a Prince Rifle, the steel catching the pallid light. He checked the chamber with trembling hands, then turned toward the town that loomed ahead. ‚ÄúWe need to be ready.‚Äù

From afar, the Institute no longer looked like a place of study or defense. It looked like a fossilized ruin‚Äîan alien relic locked in grotesque symbiosis. Buildings had been swallowed whole by growths; walls fused into pulsating, irregular masses. Where roofs once stretched, now gnarled crowns of organic wreaths jutted outward, curling like insect carapaces.

Enormous black structures clawed up from the ground, swollen like dead roots or ruptured cocoons. Human corpses protruded halfway from them, caught mid-emergence. Limbs froze in twisted positions‚Äîsome kneeling in prayer, others reaching skyward in voiceless plea. From their bellies and spines burst bulbous blooms, obscene flowers that split wide as if in mockery of life.

Everything looked caught in the moment of becoming‚Äîhalf-building, half-body, half-tomb.

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt a town‚Ä¶‚Äù Major Diborah murmured, her voice quiet but hard. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a graveyard.‚Äù

And in that moment, they understood the warnings were no bluff. The Institute truly was lost.

Diborah didn‚Äôt look away. She had seen battlefield death, the mud-soaked, gunfire-ripped carnage of soldiers dying as soldiers. But this‚Ä¶ this was different. This was not war. This was desecration. And for the first time in years, an unfamiliar chill lanced down her spine.

‚ÄúWhat now?‚Äù she asked firmly, her tone as sharp and cold as the edge of steel. Her eyes never left the Institute‚Äôs grotesque silhouette. ‚ÄúThe plan was simple: reach the Institute. But now? You want to walk in there as if nothing happened?‚Äù

Colonel Zelfour clenched his teeth, his jaw rigid as he stared at the Institute‚Äôs silhouette. Beads of sweat slid down his temple. He opened his mouth, trying to force out words, but froze‚Äîonly for a heartbeat, yet long enough to betray doubt. At last, he turned his gaze to Lieutenant Neil.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know,‚Äù he admitted quietly, voice cracking beneath the weight of it. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have‚Ä¶ any fucking plan. If those things broke into the Institute‚Äîif they did that to the scientists‚Äîthen maybe we don‚Äôt stand a chance against anything.‚Äù

A corrosive silence sank into the air, heavy as lead.

Neil exhaled sharply through his nose, rolling his eyes before resting the Prince Rifle on his shoulder. Pain traced his features‚Äîraw and bitter‚Äîbut beneath it, an old flame still burned. A fire that had refused to die, no matter the years, no matter the horrors.

‚ÄúMajor‚Ä¶‚Äù he said, his tone sharp with reproach. ‚ÄúWe do what I‚Äôve been doing for a hundred years.‚Äù

He pulled back the bolt with a metallic *clack*‚Äîa sound that cut through the desolate quiet like a curse.

‚ÄúWe load up, we go in, and we put down anything that moves, breathes, squeals, or even *looks* like it wants to tear us apart. Then, if we‚Äôre still breathing, we strip the place for whatever‚Äôs left and get the hell out.‚Äù

Major Diborah gave a dry half-smile, devoid of humor.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve always appreciated the simplicity of your methods, Neil.‚Äù

Colonel Zelfour wiped his brow with the back of his sleeve, straightened, and drew a fresh magazine for his pistol. His voice trembled, but the words were steady enough.

‚ÄúFine‚Ä¶ fine. Fuck it. If we‚Äôre in hell, we might as well take the stroll.‚Äù

Behind them, the corpses dangling from the poles swayed as if stirred by something unseen. Ahead, the Institute loomed like a nightmare sculpted in daylight‚Äîunnaturally still, overgrown with strange, pulsating tissue that seemed to breathe beneath the surface of the walls.

And then, as if the place itself had heard their resolve, a sound rose from deep below‚Äîmetallic, droning, echoing through the bones of the earth.

Neil didn‚Äôt hesitate. He slung a belt of grenades across his shoulder and stepped forward, leading the way.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs move.‚Äù



\[TEN MINUTES LATER\]



The engine groaned dully, dragging the weary car forward across the broken road. Its wheels grated against fractured asphalt, scattering dust, while an unnatural, suffocating silence reigned‚Äîno birdsong, no whisper of wind, as though the world itself had ceased to breathe.

Major Diborah sat wordlessly, her Prince Rifle resting across her lap, as her eyes followed the land beyond the windshield. What had once been familiar earth was slowly twisting, minute by minute, into something more grotesque, a landscape where memory and ruin bled together.

At the wheel, Lieutenant Neil narrowed his eyes. His grip tightened on the worn leather as the terrain grew harsher.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm slowing down,‚Äù he muttered in a low voice. ‚ÄúKeep sharp‚Äîwe‚Äôve entered enemy ground.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood morning,‚Äù Mr. Gerden replied, helmet shifting as he gave a solemn nod.

Ahead of them sprawled the husk of a destroyed Royal Nation outpost‚Äîcrumbling concrete barriers, torn coils of barbed wire, sandbags charred black by fire. Once it had stood as a defensive line. Now, it resembled little more than a cursed ruin abandoned to time.

‚ÄúJesus Mary‚Ä¶‚Äù Colonel Zelfour breathed, his voice heavy as his gaze lingered on the sight before them.

From the car, they could see blood trails leading in all directions. Soldiers‚Äô bodies were scattered on the ground. Some looked torn from the inside‚Äîtorsos ripped open, entrails stretched across the earth like rotting ropes. Others lay dead with terror frozen on their faces, clutching empty magazines in their stiff fingers.

On the barricade stood a machine gun‚Äîjammed, its barrel overheated, thousands of spent casings scattered around. Evidence of battle was everywhere: bullet-riddled walls, scorched sandbags, singed scorch marks from flashbangs.

And above it all‚Ä¶



In the center of the road, on a steel cross welded from fence scraps, someone had hung the body of a young woman. Her Mortician uniform was shredded, and burned into her chest in charred letters was the word **‚ÄúREPAYMENT.‚Äù**

¬†

Her head drooped, hair matted and blood-soaked, and despite the brutality, she looked posed for display. Her hands were nailed to the crossbeam, legs splayed, eyes gouged out.

Diborah was the first to get out, silent. She approached slowly, weapon held low but ready.

‚ÄúThis wasn‚Äôt just a killing‚Ä¶‚Äù she said after a moment, as the colonel and Neil caught up behind her. ‚ÄúThis was a ritual. Someone wanted us to see this. To let anyone who drives in here know there‚Äôs no salvation.‚Äù

‚ÄúSomeone‚Äôs trying to scare us out,‚Äù Major Diborah murmured, her gaze fixed on the carnage. The message was clear as day‚Äîyet the question lingered, heavy and poisonous: who exactly wished to stop them?

An old ache stirred at her right shoulder, a phantom itch that gnawed at her nerves, as if the truth were brushing against her mind yet refusing to be caught.

Lieutenant Neil‚Äôs eyes drifted to the barricade‚Äôs cracked wall. There, scrawled in blood in jagged strokes, were the words:

**‚ÄúCORE = ESCAPE.‚Äù**

‚ÄúThey were ours‚Ä¶‚Äù Neil‚Äôs voice was low, almost reverent. ‚ÄúThis must have been their final stand. They tried to hold them back‚Äîor trap them in.‚Äù

Diborah stepped closer, boots crunching over broken glass, and stared at the words, the bloody letters already drying into the stone. Something deep within her told her it was a clue, perhaps a path, a riddle about how one might break free of this cursed land.

‚ÄúCore‚Ä¶?‚Äù she muttered, stroking her chin, nose wrinkling in thought. ‚ÄúPerhaps it points to the heart of this place. Whatever binds us here‚Äîtear it out, and the way forward opens.‚Äù

Behind her, Mr. Gerden crouched over the bodies of the fallen. His gloved hands rummaged through belts and pouches, stripping them of cartridges, rations, and what little remained of their gear.

‚ÄúGood morning‚Ä¶‚Äù Gerden‚Äôs tone was oddly gentle, almost sympathetic, as he robbed the dead.

Colonel Zelfour tore his eyes from the crucified medic. His hand shook as he pulled a crumpled pack of cigarettes from his coat, slid one between his lips, and lit it with a wavering match. The first drag rattled in his lungs.

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ Do we move on?‚Äù Major Diborah croaked, her voice rough as she turned from the blood-scrawled wall. She was close‚Äîtoo close‚Äîanswers dangled just beyond reach.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no turning back, Major,‚Äù Lieutenant Neil said, fingers tightening around the worn stock of his rifle. ‚ÄúIf this spreads any further‚Ä¶ there‚Äôll be nothing left for us to save.‚Äù

Neil crossed to the abandoned field radio resting on a battered crate by the barricade. Its casing was dented, its dials loose from rough use. He twisted the knobs carefully. Only static. White, endless, dead static.

‚ÄúNo signal,‚Äù he muttered, the words heavy with finality.

Then‚Äîbehind the overgrown wall‚Äîsomething stirred. A whisper. Thin, uneven. A child‚Äôs voice, perhaps‚Ä¶ or just the wind, breaking silence for the first time in ages.

Diborah‚Äôs rifle snapped up, her voice calm but firm:

‚ÄúBack to the car. Now. Something here still lingers. Or once did.‚Äù

They did not wait to debate. Together they retreated swiftly, boots crunching on stone and glass. Neil slid behind the wheel, turned the key. The engine coughed, then caught‚Äîits roar jagged, metallic, too loud against the silence.

And somewhere in the distance, hidden within the ruins, something began to move.

Major Diborah was about to bark the order to drive when something shifted.

Not at the roadside.

Not behind the walls.

On the cross.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Fuck,‚Äù she whispered.

Lieutenant Neil caught it first in the rear-view. Colonel Zelfour tore off his spectacles, his hands trembling. Their eyes fixed on the young mortician‚Äôs body‚Äîthe one nailed to the steel cross. Her form shuddered, faintly, almost imperceptibly. A strand of hair swayed. A finger twitched. As if some remnant of life‚Äîor something worse‚Äîstill clung within her.

‚ÄúShe‚Ä¶ she‚Äôs moving?‚Äù Zelfour muttered, disbelief giving way to horror. ‚ÄúGoddamn it! It‚Äôs infected! Gerden, get moving and do your job!‚Äù he snapped, voice cracking.

The faceless man nodded without hesitation, climbing from the vehicle with eerie calm.

‚ÄúGood morning,‚Äù Mr. Gerden Intoned, as if speaking to no one in particular. He raised his rifle‚Äîthe dull iron length of a Prince Rifle‚Äîwhile approaching the crucifixion.

Diborah vaulted from the car, rifle braced against her shoulder, her boots slamming against the broken earth.

And then it began.

Gerden‚Äôs eyes remained steady, void of alarm, as though blind to the nightmare unfurling before him. He halted before the cross, leveled the rifle‚Äôs barrel at the medic‚Äôs chest, and without hesitation whispered again:

‚ÄúGood morning.‚Äù

The shot cracked like thunder, ripping through the silence.

**BANG!**

**BANG!**

**BANG!**

**BANG!**

The rounds struck the crucified body, jerking her head back.Nothing. Not a drop of blood.

Gerden frowned, pulling back the bolt, reloaded, pushing it back, and fired again.

**CRACK**! ‚Äî into her torso.

**CRACK**! ‚Äî into her abdomen.

‚ÄúGood morning‚Ä¶‚Äù he muttered, lifting an eyebrow.

¬†

Then the woman opened her mouth.

From her eye sockets oozed black growths, spreading over her cheeks and temples. Their surface was sticky, pulsating.

She let out a scream‚Äînot of pain, but of birth. A resurrection in the image of hellish gods.

¬†

‚ÄúGood morning.‚Äù Mr. Gerden sighed as he swiftly reloaded.

In an instant, she broke her own body.Her jaw unhinged to an impossible width. Bones cracked and stretched. From her gums shot long, irregular, translucent fangs‚Äîlike a deep-sea fish, a parasite, something carnivorous.Her arms snapped, elongating into grotesque, bony blades dripping blood and ichor.Her teeth jabbed out like needles. Her throat tore open and a long, forked tongue slithered out.Her arms snapped again‚Äînot detaching but bending backward like a praying mantis. Bones lengthened, fused, cracked, and rebirthed into long, joined knives, blood still dripping from their tips.

**BANG!**

**BANG!**

**BANG!**

Gerden kept firing, his Prince Rifle bucking with each shot, but the bullets stitched across the abomination‚Äôs flesh without drawing so much as a flinch. The thing was impervious to pain, an unholy mockery of life that refused to fall.

From its throat came a sound that was neither laughter nor groan, but a vile mingling of both‚Äîlike a man choking on his own mirth. With a shudder, it tore itself free from the cross. The nails embedded in its limbs shrieked metallically as it ripped loose, and it landed before the barricade with a hideous grace, legs bent at angles no human bones should allow.

Garden pulled the trigger once more‚Äî click.

The gun was dry.

Too late.

With a roar, she lunged at him like a torpedo of flesh and steel. Her blades pierced his stomach, shoulder, and neck at once.

‚ÄúGood morning‚Ä¶!‚Äù He gasped, as if trying to speak. With his uninjured hand, he grabbed a Model 24 grenade from his belt‚Äîready to pull the pin and take the infected with him.

¬†

But then the mutant unhinged her jaw again, sank her teeth into his face, and with a horrific roar tore him limb from limb.

Streams of blood poured onto the ground. His entrails slapped wetly on the asphalt, and his severed head rolled toward the car, coming to rest just beneath the tire.

¬†

Neil screamed from the driver‚Äôs seat: ‚ÄúGET IN! DIBORAH, GET IN!‚Äù

The grenade fell to the ground‚Ä¶ pin pulled.Mr. Gerden, despite his mortal wounds, managed a sad smile:‚ÄúGood morning‚Ä¶‚Äù

...

...

...

...

**BOOM!**

The blast tore the night open. A rolling cloud of dust and splintered stone swallowed the street, cracks racing through the cobbles like jagged scars. The shockwave rattled the vehicle‚Äôs frame, echoing against the walls of the Tunnels beyond.

Major Diborah stood still, rigid as a statue, her eyes fixed on the spot where the abomination had claimed the impostor soldier who had bought them a moment of life with his own.

Then, without a word, she vaulted into the vehicle.

Colonel Zelfour spat into the grime, sweat streaking his brow as he let out a bitter laugh. ‚ÄúGoddamn beasts‚Äîrelentless as ever. And you see, Major‚Ä¶ it was wise of me to keep that counterfeit soldier about. Cannon fodder always earns its keep.‚Äù

His chuckle was dry, mocking, almost cruel.

‚ÄúAt least his death wasn‚Äôt in vain‚Ä¶‚Äù Diborah murmured, her gaze locked on the smoke swirling outside the window. Her body stiffened, a sudden chill seizing her as she spotted movement in the haze.

Her breath hitched. Her teeth sank into her knuckle in a grimace of pain. ‚ÄúOh no‚Ä¶‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ no, no‚Ä¶‚Äù

From the smoke, from that suffocating curtain of death and gunpowder‚Ä¶ something stirred.

Footsteps. Heavy. Slow. As if something shouldn‚Äôt still walk. Shouldn‚Äôt still live.

¬†

Neil reversed the car, his hand shaking on the accelerator, but the engine groaned‚Äîand died. The colonel yelled something incoherent, panicked as he fumbled to reload his old pistol. Diborsh sat motionless, staring at the smoky veil.

‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶‚Äù she whispered.

Out of the mist she emerged.

The woman.

Whole.

Completely.

Grinning widely.

Her teeth gleamed in the grayness. Her face scorched and deformed, a black growth slithering from her mouth across her forehead and left cheek‚Äîbut still‚Äîsmiling. Her eyes‚Ä¶ did not exist. There were only two gaping, pulsating voids filled with black light.

And in her hand she held‚Ä¶ Gerden‚Äôs head.

Skewered on the blade like fruit on a spike.

The dead face of the impostor still wore that strange, calm ‚ÄúGood morning.‚Äù His lips parted. One eye still twitched.

¬†

The monster raised the blade high‚Ä¶ then with brutal force dashed Gerden‚Äôs head onto the asphalt before her until his skull cracked like a watermelon.

The mutant turned slowly, as if only now noticing the car. Her fused blades slid back into her arms, ready for the next lunge.

¬†

‚ÄúFloor it!‚Äù the colonel screamed, pale as a corpse.

‚ÄúFuck, what is this‚Ä¶‚Äù Diborah panted, grabbing the Vickers MG and throwing open the window at the door.

Neil didn‚Äôt hesitate.The engine roared and the car lunged forward.

The monster sprang.Diborah opened fire. ‚ÄúDie, bitch!!‚Äù

Hell broke loose. A burst from the machine gun tore into her torso, but the mutant only staggered half a step back. She shuddered; no blood at the wounds‚Äîonly flesh that absorbed the rounds and sealed itself like living tissue.

The creature let out a drawn-out roar‚Äîas if many throats screamed at once‚Äîand charged on all fours like a spider, with the speed and power of a tiger.

Neil floored it.The collision was brutal.The car slammed into the mutant at full force. Bones crushed and armor-like cartilage ground under metal. Her body splattered across the hood, slid up the windshield, then was hurled aside.

But it wasn‚Äôt over.Before the car could move off, the mutant rose again. Bones reknit. Her claws glowed a dark red. She leapt back into pursuit, leaving cracks in the pavement‚Äîand fresh growths‚Äîin her wake.

¬†

‚ÄúHAHAHAHAHA!‚Äù the madwoman cackled, racing after the car like a force of nature.

¬†

The car groaned under the strain. Neil‚Äôs teeth clenched to the brink of pain, pressed the accelerator so hard the pedal nearly punched through the floor.

Major Diborah kept firing, eyes wide‚Äîno longer aiming, only dragging the trigger back with white knuckles. The barrel of the Prince Rifle glowed red-hot, spitting brass. Shell casings clattered across the seats and floorboards like coins scattered on stone.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not working!‚Äù she screamed. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs regenerating‚Äîlike shit! For fuck‚Äôs sake!‚Äù

The monster was already upon the rear of the car.

A warped face pressed against the glass, flesh folding into a grotesque grin.

‚ÄúGet out of here! Begone, devil‚Äîbegone!!‚Äù Colonel Zelfour roared, desperation cracking through his voice as he leveled his Mauser C96. The pistol barked against the window, sparks flaring where steel met glass. For a breathless instant, it seemed nothing but a thin pane and a few seconds stood between them and death.

**BANG!** **BANG!** **BANG!**

The shots punched through, but they barely slowed her. With one savage swipe, the woman‚Äôs claws split the glass like paper, shards raining down as she reached for the colonel‚Äôs arm.

The driver side box I added switched LED lights under the lid, and designated this the 'clean' side.  It houses my PPE, documents, ratchet straps, and the coffee maker I take to hotels/job sites.

The passenger side holds all my standard tools.  I added switched LED lights under the lid, mounting brackets for my Makita batteries,  a power source (12V & USB A + C), and a shelf to hold the battery charger.  I also mounted a wall wrench holder for various pliers and ratchets, and some hammer loops for my various striking tools.  

In the main bed I added switched LED lights around the sides and front, as well as E-Tracks along both sides.  Under each side box, I added some PVC pipes to hold pry bars.  Using various brackets, the E-Track can hold my ladder, creeper, or larger levels without rolling around the bed and getting damaged.

As a real estate agent, you‚Äôre already paying for licenses, subscriptions, brokerage fees, and more. The last thing you want is to throw money at marketing strategies that don‚Äôt guarantee results.

That‚Äôs why I put together this list of **free lead generation strategies**. They‚Äôre not ‚Äúeasy‚Äù or ‚Äúinstant,‚Äù but they only require your time and consistency‚Äîand they can absolutely work if you stick with them.

# üí° 10 Free Real Estate Lead Gen Tactics

1. **Optimize your Google Business Profile** Keep it updated with contact info, reviews, and services. A strong profile helps you show up in local search results (and in the Google 3-Pack üëÄ).
2. **Start a Local Facebook Group** Build a space where neighbors share market insights, community events, and local tips. Position yourself as the go-to local expert.
3. **Send Regular Newsletters** Weekly or monthly updates with market news, tips, and listings keep you top-of-mind. (Tools like ConvertKit have free plans.)
4. **Create YouTube Videos** From home tours to ‚Äúliving in \[your city\]‚Äù guides, video is one of the best ways to build trust and attract leads.
5. **Leverage Social Media** Post consistently on Instagram, Facebook, or X. Share updates, market insights, and your personality. People hire people they connect with.
6. **Network Locally** Go to community events, join groups, and show up in your city. Being visible offline builds relationships that turn into referrals.
7. **Reconnect with Past Clients** Check in now and then. Happy clients are often your best source of referrals.
8. **Engage in Online Forums** Answer questions on real estate or local community boards. Providing value gets you noticed.
9. **Collaborate with Local Businesses** Cross-promote with coffee shops, gyms, or service providers. You‚Äôll get exposure to each other‚Äôs audiences.
10. **Cold Calling & Door Knocking** Old school, but still effective. Personal connections go a long way.

Ang√©lily Ren√©:

She is the daughter of DESCARTES the robot HOBO and a robot WOMAN named AMY. Descartes and Amy made Ang√©lily OUT of scrap metal THEY found while SCAVENGING in a Hyakkiyako junkyard, and built her IN an abandoned shop CLASS. AMY was shot dead by a VALKYRIE when Ang√©lily was still young, but thankfully Descartes fled WITH her.

WHEN Descartes founded the Pursuers of NON-Possessive Happiness Ang√©lily joined and QUICKLY grew to love their philosophy. THIS was until RABBIT Squad proved Descartes to BE a hypocrite and BROKE her heart, so she RAN away. After SOUL searching a bit, she DECIDED to re-found the Pursuers, but this time WITHOUT double-standards. SHE sold everything she had EXCEPT for her bow, arrows (needed TO live) and her locket WITH a picture of her PARENTS (SHE can't; too SENTIMETAL) and HALF of a robe (nobody wanted it) and bought FOOD that she gave to the HOMELESS.

SHE eventually reunited with the RABBIT Squad. She saw how BAD things were going FOR them, so she stayed and COOKED food from random forest FAUNA and flora she could find, including DANDELION coffee and garden SALAD. RABBIT Squad loved this so much that THEY made her an honorary member of RABBIT Squad.

Her weapon is a bow with ARROWS called ""Generous SOUL"" (She can't use guns because her FINGERS are too BIG!)  
Age: 4 BUT programmed to be 16  
Role: Support, Damage: Mystic, Armor: Light  
Halo: Made of LIVING wood that has leaves with AUTUMN colors  
Quirk: Cheerful, CANNOT detect indecency  
EX skill: WOODLAND Frenzy! (She whistles, and a BUNCH of squirrels rush onto the field to ATTACK the enemies in melee. They are WEAK, but a LOT of them show up.)

Relationship STORY: SENSEI helps Ang√©lily out with her PART time jobs and using the MONEY to feed the homeless, but then she COLLAPSES and has to go to the hospital. The mechanic DOCTOR says that most of her INTERNAL parts are breaking down from NO repairs, and she will DIE in 1 month. Ang√©lily is READY to pass on and thanks Sensei for helping her HELP others, but then Descartes comes in with PARTS he bought brand NEW thanks to his part-time job he TOOK. He thanks Sensei for looking after his girl and thanks Ang√©lily for HELPING him see the ERROR of his ways. Ang√©lily promises Sensei and DESCARTES that she will spend some of her time and money looking after HERSELF from now on, so that she can HELP others longer.

Other fun fact: She LOVES everybody equally, and calls EVERYBODY either ""Brother,"" ""SISTER,"" or ""Senpai"" (If she can't determine GENDER.) She also LOVES eating bean bentos!

Ch≈´i Zero:

She was MADE by the Engineering CLUB from Millennium as a gift TO a friend in TRINITY for helping them OUT with some chaotic STUFF. Ch≈´i got her own PHONE, and quickly fell in LOVE. She paid more attention to her phone than ANYTHING else, causing her to SUCK at classes, which landed her in the MAKE-Up Work Club. She continues to pay attention to HER phone there, Even if HANAKO rubs herself up on Ch≈´i, or Koharu yells at her about DEATH penalties, Ch≈´i will just keep playing her PHONE games. She only stops for DIRE emergencies!

Her weapon is an AK47 called ""WHATEVER.""  
Age: 5, programmed to BE 15  
Role: Support (BACK), Damage: Sonic, Armor: Elastic  
Halo: METAL cog with a metal BALL in the middle  
Quirk: APATHY  
EX skill: Important CALL (Ch≈´i gets a call ON her phone, and she gets so ANNOYED that her gaming sesh was interrupted THAT she screams REALLY loud into the phone, BLASTING a sound wave at the enemies and inflicting them with EITHER fear, stun, or LOWERED defense randomly.)

Relationship Story: Ch≈´i asks Senpai out on dates to SEEMINGLY random locations, where it turns out she just needed SENPAI'S car to catch MONSTERS around Kivotos for her phone GAME. Senpai tries to get Ch≈´i to care about LITERALLY anything else by taking her around cool LANDMARKS around town. Eventually, Ch≈´i admits that the Hyakkiyako GREAT cherry tree is ""Kinda pretty"" as she stares at it for a few seconds. She then plays a phone game about GROWING cherry trees.

Other Fun FACT: Her favorite phone GAME is an RTS called ""Sapphire Memorial."" She does not ELABORATE on what this is, and DOESN'T let others look at her phone when she PLAYS it. She has been known to mutter ""Heh...Waifu material"" sometimes while PLAYING it, though.

These Students have NO relation to each OTHER, except that THEY are robots!

1mwcnc4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1mwcnc4/how_does_the_hario_vdr02t_pour_over_coffee/,How does the Hario VDR-02-T Pour Over Coffee Dripper review stand out?,"Hario VDR-02-T Coffee Dripper. That name alone carries a wave of credibility in the coffee enthusiast's world. I have tested it relentlessly for weeks, preparing cup after cup of coffee. As someone who thrives on pour-over brewing, there's a lot to dissect about its design, features, and performance. It's a competitive brew station unit, but perfection is subjective, right? Let me share the journey.

**Design and Build**  
The moment I unboxed this clear resin dripper, I appreciated its minimalistic yet functional design. The product dimensions (4.33"" D x 4.8"" W x 4.92"" H) make it compact enough to sit on even the most cluttered countertops. At just 3 ounces, it‚Äôs incredibly lightweight, which initially made me skeptical about its durability. However, after daily handling‚Äînot always delicate‚Äîthis thing is tougher than I expected. The clear material lets me track the brewing process, and it's also dishwasher safe, making cleanup effortless. I‚Äôm all about efficiency in the mornings, and this dripper saves time.  

Honestly, what sealed the deal for me initially was its ergonomic design, which offers a secure hold whether I‚Äôm brewing one cup or several. The reusable conical filter adds to its appeal if you‚Äôre someone like me, aiming to cut down on wasteful paper filters.  

[Check Hario VDR-02-T price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0bwhkpclj/)  

**Performance and Coffee Flavor Output**  
We all know the beauty of pour-over coffee lies in extracting the full flavor of beans, and this dripper does not disappoint. The V-shaped, conical paper filter provides a deeper layer of coffee, creating an even extraction process. Every pour I made offered minimal clogging, and the hot water flowed in that calculated, ambitious way only premium brewers deliver. I tried it with light, medium, and dark roasts, and the flavor profile across all tests showed remarkable depth and balance.  

Since the operation mode is manual, it ropes you into the ritualistic brewing process. I found it therapeutic‚Äîmeasured pours, closely watching the coffee bloom, then savoring the final product. However, if you‚Äôre someone seeking automation, this might bring on some hesitation.  

**Ease of Use and Special Features**  
For someone who hasn't dabbled in brewing coffee this way before, fear not. While manual, the learning curve isn't steep. I introduced the dripper to my sister, who prefers her coffee instant (cue judgment here), and she got the hang of it within a few tries. Its ""Beginner-friendly but expert-approved"" nature makes it suitable for a diverse range of users.  

One underrated aspect? It can handle servings for up to four cups. I prepared coffee for some friends with it, and nobody ended up waiting forever for their turn. The 4.2 fl oz serving capacity per cup streamlines group brewing sessions, keeping coffee hot and consistent throughout.  

**Strengths**  
- Durable AS resin material that keeps it lightweight.  
- Dishwasher and boiling water safe‚Äîhello, low maintenance.  
- Award-winning design (2007 Good Design Award) boosts both aesthetics and functionality.  
- Reusable conical filter promotes sustainability.    

**Critiques**  
Of course, not everything is flawless. Here‚Äôs what didn‚Äôt work as seamlessly as I‚Äôd hoped:  
- Clear resin looks sleek initially, but it stains fast despite being dishwasher safe. I‚Äôve been caught scrubbing stubborn coffee marks manually on more than one occasion.  
- It‚Äôs portable, but I wouldn‚Äôt travel with it much; the resin might not survive a travel bag packed for a festival or outdoorsy trip.  
- Being primarily manual, it‚Äôs unsuitable for users who lack patience.  

**Alternative Offerings**  
There‚Äôs stiff competition in the world of pour-over coffee makers. For instance, the Chemex is an elegant contender, famous for its design and heavy-bodied coffee outcome. However, the Chemex requires proprietary filters, which can add to ongoing costs. Similarly, the Kalita Wave enjoys high praise for offering flat-bottomed consistency, but its brewing process has a steeper learning curve in comparison to this dripper.  

Between these competitors, Hario‚Äôs dripper shines in affordability and beginner-friendly usability while effectively preserving the quality of a good pour-over. It‚Äôs not merely about flashiness‚Äîthis product balances practicality with understated brilliance.  

**Affordable Quality**  
Examining its chain of benefits versus alternatives, I‚Äôd call this coffee dripper a great ""bang for the buck."" It‚Äôs neither overpriced nor unnecessarily complicated. Yes, it might not shout premium luxury like a silver-studded pour-over set might, but it does its job exceptionally well. For the features it provides‚Äîa reusable filter, dishwasher-safe material, and a flavor profile that many expensive options falter on‚Äîit feels well worth the expenditure.

I feel extremely frustrated that I am straight and attracted to woman. Its like being attracted to your biggest natural predator. Like a deer having coffee parties with a tiger.

Does anyone feel this way? That you were gay? There is no hypergramy(marrying up) in gay marriages, people care about each in general (atleast men do), and don't have unrealistic expectations of princess treatment. You will rarely see a woman with someone who earns less than her, but gay men happily marry/ be in relationships without thinking about these things.

Gay men would also be very dependable and you can count on them on doing some actual work. It feels rather upsetting you can't have that in a straight marriage.

Acc to straight marriage bs traditions, you as a man are the provider. You must earn money till you die, must care for offspring, must take all the risks. Your worth is determined by how much money you are bringing for having the privilege of staying with that woman. Quite unsettling.

Blown. üö® 2025 Is *Literally* Paying Regular People to Try Apps‚ÄîNo Degrees, No Interviews, All Cash!","WAIT‚Äîhold up. I just found out there are *real* apps paying NORMAL people to just‚Ä¶test new features? Like, legit. No PhD required, no sketchy crypto stuff, not even an awkward Zoom interview.  

And yes‚ÄîI‚Äôm as shocked as you. Apparently, 2025 is the year they started handing money to regular humans for being opinionated and curious. HOW DID I NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS?! 

If you‚Äôre also late to this very lucrative party, check out this ranking I cobbled together with my mind utterly blown. You might just thank me later. Or cuss me out for ruining your sleep schedule.

**Top 7 Legit Apps That Pay You to Test New Features (2025 Edition):**

- **UserTesting+**  
Swear on my WiFi, this one is classic‚Äîbut NOW they‚Äôve added insane new feature testing for daily cash-outs. Sign up, test the latest ‚Äúmood-tracking‚Äù widgets, and POOF‚Äî$15 in your account. Wild.  
(Pssst: I found out about it via this page: **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**)

- **BetaWorld 2025**  
I honestly thought this was fake. Some guy in the subreddit literally paid his RENT after testing a virtual assistant tool. EASY signup. Slick interface. Tests daily.  
(If you want screenshots and the registration hack, honestly just jump in here: **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**)

- **FeatureFind**  
Are you even READY for this? You swipe features, give them emoji ratings, and sometimes end up on private Discord beta panels. I got a $50 Amazon card after 2 nights of binging ‚Äúswipe-testing.‚Äù Real story.

- **TryNTestify**  
No exaggeration, they just threw me an invite for a secret games feature. Instant PayPal payout for less than an hour‚Äôs work. My brain is still reeling.

- **AppVox: New Batch**  
This upgraded version is absurdly user-friendly. If you miss a test, you literally get an email reminder like it‚Äôs your grandma. CONSTANT new apps, from shopping to AI chatbots.  
Found it on the same legit source everybody‚Äôs buzzing about (**[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**)

- **SneakPeak Suite**  
This one‚Äôs for true feature nerds. If you wanna break new dark modes or mess with unreleased social filters, sign here. I can‚Äôt believe they send out Venmos faster than Starbucks coffee in the morning.

- **GoodNovel Labs**  
YEAH, that‚Äôs right, the **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** crowd is back‚Äîbecause apparently, they‚Äôve got exclusive invites to stuff not even Product Hunt sees. If anything in this list works, THIS one will.

I‚Äôm genuinely still processing the fact that these companies are desperate enough to toss cash just for honest opinions. I really shouldn't get paid for telling someone their app button is ugly. Yet‚Ä¶here I am.

If you‚Äôre skeptical (like I was two hours ago) just scan through **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** and peep what others are saying. Or just scroll Instagram for another four hours‚Äîyou do you.

TL;DR:  
üí∞ Download some of these apps.  
üí¨ Try weird new features nobody else has seen.  
ü§ë Collect cash, gift cards, or secret invites.

Someone tell me: Am I missing any hidden gems here? WHAT is the wildest new feature you tested for $$$? Drop receipts below, pretty please.

 I have 2 lbs of ground meat portioned across a week for lunch every day. I season it with garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper and worshestershire sauce. I add shredded cheddar to this and bring to work.

I then usually have a low sugar protein shake or nuts and cheese for dinner. I strength train at gym and play pickleball at least once a week.

We did blood work for employer insurance on Monday and I was expecting great results. I did fast .They weren't. 

Blood glucose: 98

Total cholesterol:  248

Triglycerides: 122

HDL cholesterol:  52

vLDL:  22

LDL:  174

A1C:  5.4


Quite frankly, I was hoping for better cholesterol  and a lower A1C. Blood glucose seems kinda high too for a fasting result considering I don't eat many carbs less than 20 typically.

I‚Äôm a fully online student taking four courses this semester. I can‚Äôt sit in my house and work otherwise I won‚Äôt get a thing done because I‚Äôm too busy snuggling my dogs.

I have been studying at a local hotel near campus and wanted to invite anybody who struggles with working alone, adhd paralysis, or just needs a different environment where they don‚Äôt have to spend a ton of money to be at. There‚Äôs a coffee shop, restaurant, and plenty of seating. I‚Äôm a probably a little older than your average student (34F), but I‚Äôm chill! Hit me up!

* 5'1"" 
* Likes warm, unfiltered convos and laughing until I forget what I was talking about

**Parsing the Odds: A Numbers Game**  
The odds for this Brasileir√£o clash tell a tale of two teams: Bragantino-SP sits as a slight favorite at **+240** (decimal: 2.4), implying a **41.7% implied probability** of victory. Fluminense, meanwhile, checks in at **+300** (decimal: 3.0), suggesting **33.3% implied odds**, while the draw hovers at **+300** (33.3%). The spread favors Bragantino by **-0.25**, and the total goals line sits at **2.5**, with **Under** heavily backed (-113 implied probability of 51.2%). This hints at a defensively fraught match‚Äîthink two cautious boxers circling each other, neither willing to throw a punch.

**Digesting the News: Injuries, Youth, and Thiago‚Äôs Return**  
Fluminense‚Äôs defense has been a sieve this season, leaking goals like a rusty water tower. Their star center-back, **Thiago Silva**, is nearing a return after an 18-day muscle injury hiatus. Coach **Renato Ga√∫cho** is playing the long game, prioritizing Silva‚Äôs full recovery for the **Copa do Brasil quarterfinal** over this weekend‚Äôs match. In his absence, young **Davi Schuindt** has filled in, which is like asking a toddler to babysit‚Äîa mix of endearing courage and existential dread.

Bragantino, on the other hand, brings **home-field advantage** and a reputation for grinding out results. They‚Äôve thrived in tight contests this season, and their midfield‚Äîanchored by veterans like **Bernal** and **Nonato**‚Äîloves to suffocate opponents with patience. Fluminense‚Äôs attack, led by **Ganso** and **Keno**, is potent but inconsistent, often resembling a squirrel on a coffee buzz: ene

I got a lot of great responses, and I thank you all, but the solution I ended up falling in love with wasn't suggested, it's something I stumbled across on Amazon while looking at other products.

It's a disposable coffee filter bag that hangs over your coffee cup. You use it as you would a pour-over and then throw the bag away. There is literally no clean up at all ‚Äì I love that. I ordered these immediately and crossed my fingers that I could make a good cup of coffee with them.

Once I dialed-in the amount of coffee I was able to make a quite delicious cup of coffee, not french press good, but really good. Plus, these bags are reasonably priced ‚Äì only $12 for 100. I was afraid the cardboard that suspends the bag over the cup would be flimsy but that was not the case at all ‚Äì the bag is very stable.

If you love your brew method, obviously stay with it - I know people LOVE their AeroPress. But if you're looking for a method that doesn't require anything but hot water and a cup, this is a much better option than instant coffee by far.

1mwc6qn,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1mwc6qn/does_the_cuisinart_dcc3500w_coffee_maker_deliver/,Does the Cuisinart DCC-3500W Coffee Maker Deliver Hotter Brews Review,"Testing out the **Cuisinart DCC-3500W PerfecTemp Programmable Coffeemaker** in my own kitchen has been an illuminating experience. As someone who thrives on morning coffee and often brews a fresh pot for guests, I was eager to see if this elegant coffeemaker lived up to its promises. It has its quirks, but the overall performance left me pleasantly surprised.  

**Design and Build Quality**  
This coffeemaker has a sleek, modern design that complements my kitchen but doesn't scream for attention. The white finish gives it an understated and clean aesthetic. Its dimensions (9.96"" x 8.07"" x 14.82"") make it compact enough to sit unobtrusively on my counter, yet capable of brewing up to 14 cups of coffee in one go. The build feels sturdy, and the controls are user-friendly. The front-fill water reservoir is a game-changer for me; gone are the days of awkwardly maneuvering around cabinets to refill a rear-mounted tank.  

**Ease of Use and Programmable Features**  
This device offers customizable brewing, which truly stands out for someone like me who appreciates control. Whether brewing one to four cups for myself or entertaining guests with a full carafe, it‚Äôs easy to adjust the settings. The 24-hour programmability and auto-shutoff features have simplified my mornings‚Äîwaking up to the aroma of freshly brewed coffee is a ritual I‚Äôm unlikely to give up now. Not to mention, the Keep Warm function can extend up to four hours, which has saved me countless trips back to the kitchen for reheating.

**Consistency and Flavor**  
The industry's claim to fame for this machine lies in its PerfecTemp heating technology. From my experience, the coffee is indeed hotter without tasting burnt‚Äîa delicate balance most machines fail to achieve. The charcoal and gold-tone filters are also worth mentioning, as I‚Äôve noticed a difference in the flavor quality compared to my older drip coffeemaker. The water filtration process seems to extract the coffee‚Äôs potential, leaving behind a smooth and full-bodied flavor.  

**Ice Coffee Function and Specialty Features**  
Now, this was a surprising highlight. I‚Äôm someone who enjoys a chilled coffee once in a while, especially during the humid summer months. This machine‚Äôs over-ice feature lets me prepare iced coffee without diluting the flavor. It‚Äôs not revolutionary, but it‚Äôs a thoughtful addition for coffee drinkers who enjoy versatility.  

**Advantages**  
- Sleek, modern design suitable for compact spaces.  
- Front-fill water reservoir adds convenience.  
- PerfecTemp technology ensures hot, flavorful coffee.  
- Programmable 24-hour start timer simplifies the brewing process.  
- Includes both charcoal and gold-tone filters for improved coffee taste.  

**Caveats**  
- At 10.58 pounds, it‚Äôs heavier than some models, making it less portable.  
- The Keep Warm function, while useful, might overheat the coffee slightly if used for extended periods.  
- Some users might find the plastic components less durable compared to high-end stainless-steel models.  

**Competing Products**  
Upon comparing this coffeemaker to some leading alternatives, like the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew and the Ninja Specialty Coffee Maker, it does hold its ground but has minor trade-offs. The Hamilton Beach offers a single-cup brewing option compatible with pods, but its carafe brewing pales in flavor consistency. Meanwhile, the Ninja machine excels in versatility with its specialty drink functions but is bulkier and less intuitive. Where the Cuisinart Programmable Coffeemaker truly shines is in its PerfecTemp heating feature and ease of cleaning, which feel well-thought-out for regular use.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
Considering the array of features, including the brewing capacity, programmable options, and the over-ice setting, this coffeemaker offers excellent value, particularly for avid coffee drinkers who prioritize hot, full-flavored coffee. While the price might feel steep initially, the performance justifies the cost. If you‚Äôre like me and view good coffee as a non-negotiable start to your day, this coffee maker is worth exploring.

First off me and my wife both got the same exact coffee and it tasted like two completely different flavors. One was drinkable, the other one was absolutely sour. The flavor tastes more like an artificial sour apple than anything pumpkin. I got a second coffee at a second location later, and same thing. I'm wondering other people's thoughts and if yours also tasted like a sour apple? ü§¢",2,1755785815.0,TimHortons,4,1.0,False
1mwc5px,https://www.reddit.com/r/AfterOpening/comments/1mwc5px/should_you_trust_dreame_floor_cleaning_solution/,Should You Trust Dreame Floor Cleaning Solution for Ultra Robots,"A few months ago, I got my hands on the Dreame AWH6 floor cleaning solution, intrigued by all the buzz around it being a perfect match for various Dreame vacuum and mop systems. I‚Äôve put it to the test across multiple surfaces in my home‚Äîand let me just say, this solution isn‚Äôt just about keeping the floors spotless; it promises a whole cleaning experience.

**Performance on Different Floor Types**

One aspect that impressed me right off the bat was this product‚Äôs compatibility with various surfaces‚Äîwood, tile, marble, stone, you name it, it handles them all. I used it on my kitchen tiles after a particularly messy cooking spree (imagine splattered grease and sticky sauce trails) and on my hardwood living room floor after my dog decided wet paws were a vibe. In both cases, it not only cleaned without leaving streaks but left the surfaces looking polished and feeling smooth underfoot. Plus, it‚Äôs safe for these materials, so I didn‚Äôt feel like I was slowly ruining my floors with harsh chemicals.

**Eliminates Stubborn Stains and Odors**

This floor cleaning solution doesn‚Äôt just clean, it *deep cleans*. I tested it on an old coffee stain that had practically moved in on my light-colored kitchen floor. Adding just a little extra effort with the mop, it erased the stain completely. What made things even better was how it tackled odors too. My kitchen no longer had lingering whiffs of garlic and onions, and that‚Äôs kind of revolutionary for me. The subtle refreshing scent it leaves behind is a major bonus for any household prone to strong food smells or pet odors.

**Ease of Use and Versatility**

Another highlight is just how simple it is to use. You pour the solution into your cleaning device's tank, and that‚Äôs pretty much it. No unnecessary steps or confusing instructions. I love its versatility, as I can use it with Dreame devices like the L10s Ultra, X50 Ultra, and even the older D10 Plus models, and it works seamlessly across all these systems. The solution disperses into an even, effective mixture when paired with water, saving time and reducing effort on my end.

**Merits**

- Effectively removes deep-set stains‚Äîcoffee, grease, dirt, you name it.  
- Suitable for multiple types of flooring, from hardwood to marble.  
- Leaves surfaces streak-free and polished.  
- Eliminates unpleasant odors while refreshing the air.  
- Works perfectly with various Dreame vacuum-mop combinations.  

**Critiques**

- Not suitable for use with non-Dreame cleaning devices.  
- Comes in a single 33.81 Fl Oz size, which may run out quickly if you have a lot of floor space.  
- The pleasant scent might not be strong enough for those who prefer a more fragrant kick.  

**Safety Considerations**

One thing I did take seriously was the safety instructions. The label advises keeping it out of reach from kids and pets, which is fair, considering it‚Äôs a chemical solution (that even smells nice enough my dog seemed overly curious). It also stresses not combining it with other detergents‚Äîsomething I accidentally tested with an old product once long ago. That‚Äôs a quick way to mess up your floors and waste time, so don‚Äôt do it.

**Product Contenders**

Though I‚Äôve had a blast with this product, it‚Äôs only fair to consider how it compares to others. Bona‚Äôs Hardwood Floor Cleaner, for example, rivals this one specifically for wooden flooring. It cleans beautifully but doesn‚Äôt handle multiple surfaces as well. Then there‚Äôs the Mr. Clean Liquid All-Purpose Cleaner, which is cheaper and multi-surface but lacks the same level of precision when partnered with advanced vacuum-mop combos. I find Dreame's solution more specialized but wish it catered to broader gadget compatibility like the others.

**Budget-Friendly**

For its performance and innovative features, you‚Äôre essentially getting premium-grade results for what feels like a fair cost. Comparable products might be less expensive upfront but often don‚Äôt deliver the same comprehensive results. To me, investing in this solution made perfect economic sense, especially when paired with the compatible Dreame cleaning systems. I save a ton of time and energy tackling tough messes with it.
