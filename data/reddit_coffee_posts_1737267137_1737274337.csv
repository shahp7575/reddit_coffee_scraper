1i4trrd,https://www.reddit.com/r/CafelatRobot/comments/1i4trrd/shots_for_iced_latte_and_iced_mocha/,Shots for Iced Latte and Iced Mocha,"I use the Cafelat Robot to make iced coffee, and I'm concerned about heat loss. To minimize this, I usually fill the basket almost to the brim with boiling water. Since my iced coffee drinks are typically mixed with milk and sugar, I thought using all the water wouldn‚Äôt affect the drink.

I usually end up with a coffee-to-water ratio of around 1:2.5 to 1:3. My question is, for iced coffee, would a standard 1:2 ratio or a shots with better texture produce better iced drinks than just pushing all the water into a shot?",1,1737274204.0,CafelatRobot,0,1.0,False

1i4trao,https://www.reddit.com/r/MoneyDiariesACTIVE/comments/1i4trao/travel_diary_long_weekend_in_belgium_as_a_standby/,travel diary: long weekend in belgium as a standby traveler,"i‚Äôve written money diaries before (in my post history), but i‚Äôve never done a travel diary before! this was a 3-night trip taken with my mom over thanksgiving to ghent and brugge. my mom had never been before and wanted to see brugge all christmasy, so that was the prime directive of the trip.

background
* total HHI $255K-ish before bonus (which varies but targets around $15K)
* total spent on travel in 2024: just over $19K (this was our second-biggest spend category after housing)
* days of PTO: at the job i‚Äôve had since may - besides holidays, i get 15 vacation days (separate from sick, personal, etc) plus the ability to flex every other friday. for this trip, i didn‚Äôt use any PTO because i left wednesday night (my office closed at 1) and i traveled over the thanksgiving long weekend.
* costs below are my personal spend; i indicated where my mom paid for things (i took on the bulk of the cost of the trip except meals).
* probably the most unusual feature of my travel is that i fly standby for free! the fact that i do not pay for flights (my dad is a retired commercial airline pilot) is a HUGE reason i am able to travel as much as i do (and do things like go to europe for a long weekend which might not be ‚Äúworth it‚Äù if i had to spend a bunch of money on airfare). i have to stay really flexible with my plans and travel at off-peak times, but generally speaking it is an enormous benefit. this trip is a good example of a standby off-peak classic - i fly internationally almost every thanksgiving because while all the domestic flights are full for the holiday, the international flights are empty!

BEFORE DEPARTURE
* i covered the hotel: i used 35,000 chase points + paid $387.78 in cash. this was a cute small hotel that had a ‚Äúduplexed‚Äù family room with a loft so we could have some privacy without getting 2 hotel rooms. we stayed in ghent all 3 nights and took the train back and forth to brugge.
* flights: the outbound flight incurred no up-front cost to me; there is some imputed income (~$9?) that my dad will be taxed on at the end of the year (typical for any flight originating in the US, regardless of destination). the return flight cost $59.31, which is usually departure taxes, etc (plus some imputed income here as well).
* i had a bunch of random euros left over from other trips, so i brought i think 85‚Ç¨ in cash.
* technically this trip spurred the purchase of a new raincoat, but i needed one anyway. i‚Äôm not counting towards the total, but it was $242.25.

NOTE - all currency converted to USD except when noted where i used cash in euros.

WEDNESDAY
* head to airport on public transit in chicago - $2.25 (pre-paid from ventra account)
* mcdonald‚Äôs at airport - $12.88
* flight is free; we are lucky enough to get seats in business so that‚Äôs nice. dinner & breakfast on the plane.

THURSDAY
* upon landing, realize i never bought an esim; grab one on airalo before i leave the airport - $7 for 2 GB
* 2x one way train tickets from brussels airport to ghent - $39.82 (returns are only same-day so we buy one-ways here)
* toilet at ghent station - $1.06 (there were other times i paid for this, but i already had 1‚Ç¨ coins with me so didn‚Äôt track much)
* taxi from ghent train station to hotel - 15‚Ç¨ cash (rounded up from 14‚Ç¨)
* city tax at hotel upon check-in - $22.24
* lunch (a crepe and a waffle) - mom pays
* dinner (burgers & beer) - mom pays

FRIDAY
* brunch (we slept in) - $34.36
* tried to pay for the tram but tap to pay didn‚Äôt work? it‚Äôs unmanned so will investigate later.
* train tickets RT to brugge from ghent - mine is $16.70, mom‚Äôs senior ticket is $8.77
* coke zero from vending machine because i don‚Äôt drink coffee and i‚Äôm struggling - $1.90
* walking & boat tour - mom pre-paid; i tipped boat driver 5‚Ç¨ in cash
* emergency waffle before we get hangry and are completely paralyzed by choosing a restaurant - $7.51
* dinner (beef stew & steak) - this place is booked solid but she says we can have a table if we can be out in an hour. hold my beer. - mom paid
* pick-and-mix chocolate for later - $9.98
* tram tix from ghent train station back to hotel - $5.29 total for both of us (paid at a kiosk this time)

SATURDAY
* brunch (slept in again) - mom paid
* tram tix to train station - used the ones we bought last night and forgot to scan (how did i forget this? no idea.)
* train tix from ghent-brugge again (weekend rate tix, round trip) - $19.50 total for both
* coke zero at brugge station - $1.91
* christmas ornaments for gifts - paid cash - maybe 30‚Ç¨?
* topped up my esim with 1 mor gig of data to be safe - $4.50
* fancy chocolate for gifts to bring home - $58.29
* coffee, gluhwein, afternoon snack - mom paid
* ticket back to ghent was RT so already covered
* tram in ghent back to hotel - tap to pay (figured it out!!) - $5.29
* christmas gifts for me (oops) and my niece at a cute little shop - $87.86
* christmas gifts for me (oops again) and my niece at HEMA - $13.32
* dinner - thai - i paid 60‚Ç¨ cash (my mom offered, but i wanted to spend down my euros)

SUNDAY
* cab to train station - 20‚Ç¨ cash (ugh, he didn‚Äôt run the meter and i knew this was too much, but i was too tired to argue and i had exactly 20‚Ç¨ left. whatever.)
* train tix to brussels airport from ghent - $36.72 total
* coffee, chai, & 2 pain au chocolat for breakfast - $12.72
* water from airport vending machine because there‚Äôs no water fill station after a very stringent passport control - $3.18
* taxi home from o‚Äôhare because my husband misjudged our arrival time and my mom is TOAST - $48.90

Served my time, I move back to my hometown.
Now this is where it gets a little complicated. 6 months before I moved back to town I started dating someone new which happened to be my best friend‚Äôs fianc√©s ex gf. So fianc√©s ex gf is who I‚Äôm dating. Fianc√© is with best friend. lol if you can‚Äôt tell it‚Äôs a small town. Also atp best friend and I haven‚Äôt had any reconnection between us since I left for the military. 

New gf and I have been dating for a year at this time. I go out to a local coffee shop to meet up with a friend for a little bit. While I‚Äôm there fianc√© walks in and immediately recognizes me. I think nothing of it and continue my conversation with my friend. Fianc√© is about to leave with their to go coffees but I could see their hesitation before exiting, they just couldn‚Äôt leave without saying something to me. That is when I am met with very angry nonsensical shouting. 

At this point a huge scene is being made in this once quiet coffee shop, so I made the decision to just try to leave. Fianc√© wasn‚Äôt having that. They got in between me and my car door and kept threatening me. Throughout this entire interaction so far I had remained very calm and tried to deescalate the situation but nothing was helping. 
I kid you not the next thing they did was turn their back towards me and tried to donkey me in the stomach. After trying not to laugh at that sad attempt to hurt me?? I once again asked them to step away from my car door and let me leave to which they tried to swing at me. I put them in a headlock and kept them there tightening my grip, until my friend talked reason back into me and I let go before they passed out. Another chance for them to walk away. No still wasn‚Äôt enough for them. They then tried to pull my hair. So that‚Äôs when I punched them straight in the eye and nose. Drawing some blood finally made them run away to their car. 

Mind you the whole time this fight is happening in a coffee shop parking lot, my once best friend is screaming at her fianc√© ‚Äúif you love me you will stop‚Äù just repeatedly. Also the first time and last time I saw her again since I left for the army. Now it‚Äôs pretty obvious fianc√© tried to jump me bc they are clearly mad I was fuckin their ex right? 

Well another year or so passes after this whole fight mess. I got lonely and reminiscent and called up my best friend to see how she was doing and I honestly just needed someone to talk to(I was battling ptsd pretty hard at the time). We talked for hours, it felt like old times just her and I against the world again. Having conversations with her feels like getting high, but it started to get late and conversation started to dwindle. That‚Äôs when she said ‚Äúlisten I‚Äôm all for us being friends again and I really do miss you a lot but you know we can‚Äôt be friends again till you apologize to my fianc√©‚Äù‚Ä¶.and she said that those were her terms that her fianc√© had nothing to do with those boundaries‚Ä¶Aitah?

Later when I use the same test the following hours I dont see anything on another clearblue.. which might be due to me forcing more and more pee out diluting any hcg lol üòÇ

I also took a digital clear blue test that said not pregnant which was stupid bc it had 25 in sensitivity and I barely got any lines on my 10 sensitivity babyplan and clearblue lol. 

This morning I took a digital clear blue with 10 sensitivity and it said not pregnant.

I just got my result with **T/AT/AT**, and I‚Äôm incredibly grateful for the support I received from this amazing community! ‚ù§Ô∏è

I wanted to share my experience and give back to this group, so here‚Äôs my journey:

# Studying

**Timeline:**  
I studied for 2 months, 1-2 hrs a day on average. I have 3 years of project management experience in the supply chain consulting field.

**Resources & Tips:**

1. **AR‚Äôs Udemy Course for 35 PDU:**
   * Don‚Äôt overallocate your time to this course. It‚Äôs great for building a foundation, but the quizzes and mock exams are outdated.
   * I spent too much time taking notes and trying to memorize everything. Instead, focus on understanding the key concepts and developing the right mindset.
2. **David McLachlan‚Äôs YouTube PMBOK 7 guide video and 150 PMP/200 Agile/110 Drag-Drop Question Videos:**
   * Extremely valuable! These videos are great for developing the mindset needed to tackle scenario-based questions.
3. **Mohammad Rahman‚Äôs Mindset Video:**
   * A good-to-have resource for understanding the approach and mentality.
4. **SH Essentials (Study Hall):**
   * An **absolute** must. Go through every practice test, mini exam, and both full-length exams.
   * My scores averaged around **72%**, with **77%** on both full-length exams.
   * Some questions are tricky or poorly written. Don‚Äôt waste too much time on them; instead, focus on understanding the logic behind the tricky ones.
   * **SH Essentials** is sufficient, and in my opinion, **SH Plus** is not necessary.
5. **Third3Rock Notes:**
   * I didn‚Äôt use these, but I‚Äôve heard they‚Äôre very helpful.

**Additional Tips:**

* Take notes as you study and review them regularly. This habit was incredibly beneficial, especially during the final days before the exam.
* No need to physically go through the PMBOK. I have, no significant gains.

# Exam Day

**Test Center vs. Online Exam:**  
After hearing horror stories about online exams, I scheduled mine at a test center for peace of mind. The check-in process and environment were comfortable and stress-free.

**Managing Stress:**  
Feeling stressed before and during the exam is 100% natural. Accepting this will help you handle it better.

**Exam Details:**

* The exam was slightly easier than I expected, comparable to Study Hall in difficulty.
* There were almost no rote-memorization questions. Most questions were scenario-based and focused on agile and hybrid concepts.
* I encountered 5 drag-and-drop questions (similar to those in David McLachlan‚Äôs videos) and 7 multi choice. The rest were classic questions.
* The hardest part was maintaining focus during the last session when fatigue set in.

**Time Management:**

* Allocate your time as **80-80-80** for each session. You‚Äôll have 240 minutes for 180 questions, excluding two 10-minute breaks.
* Use the scratchpad to jot down your time management plan *after* the timer starts. Note that you cannot use it before the exam begins or during breaks.
* Check your time every 5-10 questions, and avoid spending too much time on tough ones.
* For difficult questions, choose an answer, flag them, and revisit them if you have time before the break.
* Keep in mind there are 5 experimental questions that don‚Äôt count toward your score, so don‚Äôt let these consume your time.

**Breaks:**

* Bring coffee and snacks to keep in your locker. You can access these during breaks.
* Phones and personal notes cannot be used during breaks.

# Post-Exam

* I received my provisional pass immediately after the exam, and the official results arrived two days later.
* I asked the proctor beforehand if I could use water during the exam, and they said yes. I was worried this might cause issues with my results, but it didn‚Äôt.

# Final Thoughts

The support I received from this subreddit was invaluable. This is such an amazing and helpful community, and I‚Äôm so grateful to everyone here. I wore blue an got my cake after the provisional pass!

Good luck to everyone preparing for the exam‚Äîyou‚Äôve got this!",6,1737272441.0,pmp,1,1.0,False

It was a rather slow realisation as I awoke to a new day, the crushing truth that none of this had been a dream slowly dawning on me as I awoke to the sound of waves lashing against the upper floor windows. It was then that my sleepy state rapidly subsided, and I recalled every awful detail of the previous night. With the effects of last night‚Äôs alcohol consumption largely wearing off by this stage, little things began to come back to me. The first notable image which ran through my mind with renewed clarity, was the arrival of this mysterious ferry at Balmain East, near on midnight. It was clear to me now there were definitely not supposed to be any ferries running back this way at that time. And furthermore, something about the vessel didn‚Äôt look right. The ferries of Sydney Harbour have a distinct green and yellow look to them. I suppose I passed it off at the time, as it was dark and foggy, and I was more interested in getting home than anything, but I did recall being slightly taken aback at the time by the unique dark grey colouring of this one. I sat up, rubbing my eyes, intending to head outside and confirm my hazy memory, when I heard a crackle from above me‚Ä¶

*‚ÄúGreetings passengers. The caf√© service is now open. Please proceed to the counter in an orderly fashion, and you will be served momentarily.‚Äù*

Huh‚Ä¶ I thought. I might actually get to speak to someone, maybe find out what the hell is going on. I glanced around, and yes, there was indeed a man behind the counter at the caf√©. He was a rather tall individual, bald, and he wore a grey suit. Strange attire for a caf√© worker on a commuter ferry, I thought, but then again‚Ä¶ look where we are‚Ä¶ I gathered myself before standing up and making my way over to the caf√©. There were a couple of passengers ahead of me, so I stood back and waited my turn. Their behaviour seemed ever so slightly off to me, and I was reminded of the strange man last night. They were acting very similar to him, standing there nervously, shifting their weight from side to side, heads down staring at their feet. The first man made his way up to the counter, and quietly mumbled something to the attendant, before stepping back and waiting for his order. The tall man behind the counter smiled softly, before turning around and reaching into the freezer compartment, pulling out a Mrs Macs sausage roll and throwing it into the microwave. He then returned to the counter as the second customer stepped up, placing an order for a coffee and a slice of carrot cake. Caf√© guy gave me a weird vibe. He was simultaneously the kindest man I had ever laid eyes on, smiling the sweetest of smiles as he served the customers their orders, and yet there was something ominous about his demeanour, as though secrets were hiding behind those kind eyes. Secrets I wanted in on. I snapped myself back into the present moment, as I noticed he was staring at me, and I stepped up to the counter. His expression changed as he got a good look at me, the kind smile replaced with a look of concern, and a hint of amusement.

‚ÄúHmm‚Äù, he mused. ‚ÄúInteresting‚Ä¶‚Äù

I raised an eyebrow at this, curious to know what he found so interesting about me.

‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶ excuse me, but, what‚Äôs interesting?‚Äù I asked him, not bothering to beat around the bush. He stared back at me for a moment, before shaking his head.

‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ sorry sir, never mind me, it‚Äôs a bit too early in the morning I suppose. What can I get you today?‚Äù

I glanced around behind me, and seeing no more customers waiting in line, I decided now was a good time to press for answers. I leaned in, lowering my voice to an almost whisper.

‚ÄúCan you tell me what‚Äôs going on? I got on this ferry late last night and before I knew what was going on we were heading out to sea. Is this normal? Is there a new route I don‚Äôt know about? And what‚Äôs with the Captain? He didn‚Äôt answer when I knocked on the door and called out‚Ä¶‚Äù

Caf√© guy breathed in slowly before letting out a sigh, and I stepped back, sensing a little annoyance on his part. I quickly relaxed though, as that kind smile returned.

‚ÄúSir‚Ä¶ this is the same route this service has always taken. This is the same route it will always take. There‚Äôs no need to worry, you‚Äôll be home soon. Now, what can I get you?‚Äù

I just stared at him, a mix of curiosity and concern present on my face. But I decided to place a molecule of faith in his words, he seemed confident that I‚Äôd be on my way back home soon enough. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, even in that moment, I was still acutely aware that something was very wrong with this ferry, but it‚Äôs amazing how far the rational side of the brain can stretch when it wants to.¬†

With a sigh, I spoke up. ‚ÄúJust a coffee thanks mate. Latte. Two shots.‚Äù

Caf√© guy nodded, ‚ÄúComing right up sir.‚Äù

I waited patiently as he prepared my coffee, humming Kumbaya to himself as he did so. He was an odd fellow, with a personality that didn‚Äôt seem to match his face. With a hiss of the coffee machine, steam pouring out of the vents, my coffee was ready, and he handed it to me with that same warm smile, never wavering. I nodded to him before turning and walking back toward the rear doors, eager to get some caffeine into my system.

Sliding open the rear doors, I stepped out onto the upper deck, walking over to the railings and resting against them as I stared out over the infinite blue expanse before me. Yep, definitely wasn‚Äôt a dream, there was no sign of land in any direction. I noticed how strangely quiet it was, and I then realised the ferry‚Äôs engine wasn‚Äôt running. We were just kind of bobbing up and down there in the water. The waves, a little calmer now, lapping up against the side of the boat. I gripped the railing a little tighter, as I noted the absence of Seagull calls, realising we must be very, very far out to sea. I felt a chill come over me as I imagined the expansive black hole beneath the ferry, the only protection from being swallowed up by it being this rickety bucket of bolts I was standing on. My grip on the railing tightened a little further as the ship subtly rocked from side to side. I sipped my coffee, trying my best to distract myself from those thoughts, and I pondered what lay ahead for me. My mind was still plagued by the possibilities as to what could be going on, still not satisfied that a hijacking was out of the question. Would we soon be approached by pirate vessels? Would we simply explode at any moment, leaving any survivors to the fate of the pacific ocean? No, that didn‚Äôt make sense, there weren‚Äôt enough of us on board to make any kind of terroristic political statement worthwhile. There was something more to this. I didn‚Äôt know what, but with every passing second the hope of actually getting home was becoming more and more of a distant pipe dream.

***Bwooooooom! Bwooooooom!***

Two loud blasts from the Ferry‚Äôs blower, and the engine roared to life, an announcement over the P.A following a moment later.

*‚ÄúAttention passengers, this service will be departing momentarily. The caf√© is now closed. Please take your seats.‚Äù*

I stepped back inside, just in time to see caf√© guy closing up shop and heading downstairs. He gave me a little wave as he left, and I hesitantly gave a half hearted wave back to him. I really wasn‚Äôt sure about this guy, and I think he knew it. Something about his non-answers earlier had my alarm bells ringing. Chugging back the last of my coffee, I threw the cup in the trash before heading downstairs to grab a seat on the front deck. I noticed my fellow passengers on the way past, all 3 of them this time. All sitting in the same row of seats. They gave me a little side eye as I walked past, one of them still chowing down on his sausage roll as he stared at me, a look of apprehension in his eyes. What the hell? Why were they so worried about my presence? Brushing it off, I pushed open the door to the deck, and made my way up to the bow, grabbing a seat in the shade provided by the upper deck. There I sat, my leg nervously bouncing up and down, as the ferry began to make a move. I wondered where we were headed this time. Norfolk Island? Auckland? Bloody Antarctica? All I could see ahead of me and out both sides was blue. It gave me the feeling of being stranded in another world. In a lot of ways I suppose I was, the underwater realm beneath me a dark, endless, alien landscape to those of us who dwell above it. I shook my head, not wanting to think about that. The ferry began to pick up speed now, and the winds blew harshly across my face. It was still cold, despite being in the middle of the summer months. I squinted my eyes and shuffled across a couple of rows where I could be at least a little shielded from the harsh sea breeze, and there I kicked back and tried my best to enjoy the ride.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

For ages we sailed, it must have been at least 3 hours at a guess, before I finally began to catch sight of land. It wasn‚Äôt long before the iconic Sydney skyline started to come back into view, and I felt at least some relief in the knowledge that we were heading in the direction of some form of normality. The vessel slowed its pace as it rounded the bend into Port Jackson and we began the scenic cruise into Sydney Harbour. Despite the strangeness, I couldn‚Äôt help but take in the beauty around me. I had lived here for many years, and I had seen these sights a million times, but they still never failed to take my breath away. My home city truly is beautiful, picture perfect beaches and stretches of crystal blue waters define the natural landscapes, intertwined with lush forest reserves, age old architecture, and the awe inspiring cityscape rising up beyond. The smell of the salty harbour air gave me something of a sense of calm as we sailed past beautiful Watson‚Äôs Bay, the Sydney Harbour National Park, Robertsons Point, the Botanical Gardens, and eventually rounding the bend into Circular Quay as the Harbour Bridge and Opera House came into view. It doesn‚Äôt matter how many times you‚Äôve seen it, there‚Äôs still that same sense of wonder that overcomes you every time you lay eyes on it. I actually managed to crack a smile in that moment, my racing anxious mind finally slowing to a manageable pace. We were back. I was almost home.

Except‚Ä¶ I wasn‚Äôt. It probably took me longer than I should have, but eventually it dawned on me. Where the hell was everyone? I got up from my seat and I walked around to the port side of the ferry, looking out over Circular Quay, usually packed with tourists and people going about their day by this hour, yet it was eerily empty. I could see random people, just figures, walking between various laneways and side streets in the distance, but nobody walking along the waterfront. The restaurants, normally so busy the lines are out the doors, were all closed. Even the Opera House was strangely deserted, no tourists posing for photos, no tour groups making their rounds. I wondered if perhaps it was a public holiday or something. But no‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt think it was. At least, not as far as I knew. That shouldn‚Äôt account for the total lack of tourists in any case.

I continued to pace around the deck, my feet clanging against the metal as I strolled, and I gazed out all over the harbour. There were a few vessels out and about, but even the water traffic was very quiet today. Nowhere near as many boats out as there usually were. The ferry began to slow its pace now, the engine dying down to a low gurgle as we began to swing into Darling Harbour. I glanced out over the oddly still waters as we steadily drifted by the Barangaroo docks, where all this had begun. I was silently hoping perhaps we may be stopping there, but alas, it was not to be. The ferry did indeed stop, however, right there in the middle of the harbour. The vessel lurched backwards, swinging to the left slightly as it came to an abrupt halt, and I steadied myself on a nearby pole as it did. I shot glances all around, wondering what may be the cause of this sudden emergency stop. As I stood there, I began to get the strangest sensation come over me. It was nothing like the creeping dread that had been building over the last 12 hours, it was a sudden, urgent sensation, screaming at me that I was not safe. I stood frozen, clinging to that pole and staring out over the deck, into the deep, murky waters mere feet away. Suddenly, startling me out of my fixation, an announcement over the crackly P.A system‚Ä¶

*‚ÄúRemain inside the vessel. Attention. Remain inside the vessel. For your own safety, do not go near the water. I repeat, stay away from the water‚Äù.*

I leaned back a little upon hearing that. This has gotta be a joke, right? An audible ripple on the surface startled me, and I took a step back. The water was otherwise still, what had caused that? Another barely perceptible splash, and the water began to ever so slightly bubble, right there in that one spot where the ripple had appeared. I slowly stepped back, fearing sudden movements may startle‚Ä¶ something‚Ä¶ One step‚Ä¶ then another‚Ä¶ until finally I could feel the port side doorway. I quietly slid open the door, and stepped backwards inside, before sliding it shut again. I turned around, and I froze. All three of my fellow passengers were staring at me, eyes wide with fear. Not concern this time, no, stone cold fear. I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I just stared back at them, gesturing with my hands as if to say ‚Äúwhat?!‚Äù They all turned away as I did so, looking straight ahead, their backs rigid, their hands in their laps. I didn‚Äôt know what was going on, but I got the vibe that the expectation was to sit still and be quiet, so I quickly grabbed a seat next to the doorway and steeled myself. As I sat there in my seat, I heard things. It was barely audible at first, but grew slightly louder with each repetition. A soft banging sound, emanating from below the vessel.

***Bwoonngggg!***

It echoed throughout the cabin. I glanced outside, hoping to catch sight of something. Anything that might give me a clue as to what was going on.

***Bwoonngggg!***

There it was again, louder this time. It was as though there was something heavy floating under or around the ship, bashing into it periodically. But here‚Äôs the troubling part, it was clearly impacting a different area of the ferry each time it happened. Something was down there, intentionally slamming into us.

***Bwoonngggg!***

For many long hours, I and my fellow riders sat there, still as statues, as this‚Ä¶ whatever it was‚Ä¶ slammed itself into the boat over and over. Occasionally, I could feel us tipping backwards, or to the side ever so slightly, and I silently prayed that whatever was doing this did not possess the force necessary to tip this floating nightmare into the harbour where it awaited. I wanted off this ferry, but not that way. The hours ticked on by, and as night began to settle in over Sydney, our knocking menace finally left us be. I couldn‚Äôt be sure, but I could have sworn as the ferry‚Äôs engines powered up once again, I saw a clearly defined slipstream catapulting away into the dark waters in front of us. Maybe it was just my imagination, or a trick of the light, but honestly? I don‚Äôt think so‚Ä¶

The ferry began chugging away again, and at this point I was all but convinced I was still not getting off this thing. It had been almost 24 hours by this point. This time last night, I was still slaving away in the office, and as I thought back to that, I‚Äôd have given anything to be back there again. I glanced over at my 3 fellow travellers, still sitting there in that same row of seats, one of them with his head in his hands, shaking his head from side to side. I decided to try my luck and just talk to them, I really wasn‚Äôt sure how approachable they were, so I‚Äôd held off until now. But I wanted answers. I got up from my seat and walked on over to their side of the ship, sitting down one row behind them. I spoke up‚Ä¶

*‚ÄúI‚Äôm just gonna ask‚Ä¶ do any of you have any idea what‚Äôs going on?‚Äù*

They stayed silent, their eyes facing straight ahead, not moving at all. I focussed my attention on the one guy who was acting a little differently from the rest, his head still in his hands, his hands clearly shaking now‚Ä¶

*‚ÄúMate‚Ä¶ please‚Ä¶ this is clearly not normal. Whatever is happening here, it‚Äôs* ***not normal!*** *Please! I just want to know what‚Äôs happening!‚Äù*

The man lifted his head from his hands, and slowly turned around to face me. I could see his eyes were red and wet. He was quite a young man, in stark contrast to the older two beside him. He looked like he wanted to say something, but was holding back.

*‚ÄúPlease man‚Ä¶ please! What‚Äôs going on?! Where is this ferry going?!‚Äù*

He quietly stared for a moment, before speaking up‚Ä¶

*‚ÄúTo the end of the line‚Ä¶‚Äù*

He spoke these words softly, yet with a tone of finality, before turning back around, and facing straight ahead like the rest of his group.

With a groaning creak, the ferry took a sharp left, adjusting its heading toward the Parramatta River. I sat there in a state of shock. I tried once again to get the attention of any of these guys, but with no luck. Something about the way he said what he did suggested that this ‚Äúend of the line‚Äù was not a place I wanted to end up. I got up from my seat and left them be, making my way to one of the front rows of seats again, resting my head against the glass, and just‚Ä¶ watching‚Ä¶

A strong wind began to pick up outside, and the ferry was swaying softly from side to side, its metal construction straining and creaking as it drifted slowly down river. As I watched out my window, I noticed things that just‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt make sense. Things were in their place, kind of. I had sailed down this river many times for work functions and what not, and everything I was seeing was technically where it was meant to be‚Ä¶ But, what was there, was entirely wrong. A mass of tidal trees, right there where they should be, yet different. Gnarly were their forms, twisted and lanky. Not the beautiful green canopy I was used to, but a looming mess of spindly dead limbs which seemed to reach out for our vessel as it slowly made its way past. A few of them even scraped along the side of the ferry as we went, sending out an awful noise not unlike nails on a chalkboard. The houses which lined the river, they were different too. Gone were the beautiful brick constructed riverfront homes which lined the waters. In their place, tall cage-like constructions, their bars rattling in the fierce winds outside, and the water from the murky river lashing up and over them. As we sailed closer to them, I began to notice figures inside these cages. People‚Ä¶ at least I think they were. Flailing around from side to side, splashing through the shallow waters of the riverbanks which these enormous cages sunk into. They waved their hands as the boat sailed by, as if trying to get somebody‚Äôs attention. I turned away from the window when we sailed close enough by them that I got a good look at their faces. They were terrifying, their expressions distorted into scowls with a burning anger deep in their eyes.

I got up from my seat, deciding to once again try to raise someone‚Äôs attention. I ran up the stairs, making my way to the entrance to the Captain‚Äôs quarters. As I got to the door, I noticed the internal privacy shield was down, and I could see inside this time. I saw only a man facing straight ahead, much like the other passengers. But this man was not nervous. He stood firm, his composure rock solid. I once again tried knocking on the door, screaming at him to open up and help me, but his focus did not break. He had one job, it seemed, to drive this ferry, and nothing was going to stop him. Defeated, I wandered back to the rear of the upper deck, taking a seat by the Portside windows. I could do nothing but sit and watch as we traversed further and further into the darkness. As we sailed, I noticed yet another strange figure. Not in the cages this time, no, just walking along the riverside, navigating around those awful trees as it made its way along. Eventually, it took a turn, walking down to the riverside. I watched as this person‚Ä¶ or this thing‚Ä¶ took slow steps out along a strange wooden pier, something that looked like it was built in the 50s. And there they stood.

I knew what was coming, but I didn‚Äôt want to believe it. My heart skipped a beat as the ferry swung a hard left, and began pulling in to dock at this rickety old jetty. As we pulled in closer, I could see this person‚Äôs face more clearly. It was a relatively young man, perhaps mid 30s, and he was shaking. Whether from the cold or out of fear, I did not know. I shuddered as a terrible grinding noise rang out as the ferry scraped against the old jetty. A clang from below, and I looked out to see a well built man wheeling a ramp out onto the wooden docks. It was the same guy from last night, the one I had resolved to keep clear of. But where the hell had he been?! I hadn‚Äôt seen him at all since I boarded.

***Bwooooooom! Bwooooooom!***

Another two blasts from the ferry‚Äôs horn, followed by a stern voice through the P.A‚Ä¶

*‚ÄúDO NOT EXIT THE VESSEL! DO NOT EXIT THE VESSEL! DO NOT EXIT THE VESSEL!‚Äù*

My heart was racing. This was my chance! I looked down, watching as the young man shuffled his way across the ramp, the ferry bouncing up and down threatening to dunk it into the water at any moment. I got up from my seat, and started making my way downstairs.

*‚ÄúDO NOT EXIT THE VESSEL! DO NOT EXIT THE VESSEL! DO NOT EXIT THE VESSEL!‚Äù*

To hell with that. I picked up my pace, running down the stairs, my only goal to get the hell off this forsaken boat. I gave no thought to the strangeness outside, to this twisted otherworldly plain which awaited me, all I knew was that step one was getting myself off this thing. I broke into a sprint when I hit the bottom floor, dashing toward the doors, when suddenly‚Ä¶

***SMACK!***

I ran straight into the boarding passenger. I stepped back, my plight pointless now, as the gates slammed shut and the ferry began to pull away into the night. The man stared at me, his eyes wide, and clearly shot with fear. The look in his eyes as he saw me, it was like he was staring his own death in the face. It was haunting. He grabbed on to my arms suddenly, and I tried to pull away, asking him what the hell he was doing! He simply stared at me, as he gripped me tight, and asked‚Ä¶

*‚ÄúHOW‚Ä¶ are you here?!‚Äù*

Before I could get a single word out, he turned and ran upstairs. In shock, I just stood there for a moment, watching as ‚Äúramp guy‚Äù slammed the contraption back against the wall and stormed off to the back of the ship. Shaking myself back into the moment, I turned and I ran upstairs, following that guy‚Ä¶ And I froze.

There he stood. Right there just beyond the top of the stairs in the aisle‚Ä¶ just staring. He didn‚Äôt look scared anymore. No, he scared ***me***. His face, the best I can describe it is devoid. Devoid of emotion, devoid of expression‚Ä¶ devoid of life. He was completely and totally still, staring straight ahead. Not at me, just straight ahead into thin air. I slowly approached the guy, waving my hand in front of his face. No response. I tapped his shoulder, trying to raise any sign of life. Nothing. Very carefully, I tiptoed around to the side of him, keeping my eyes locked on him at all times. I was just about to back away, when in that moment, his head snapped toward me‚Ä¶

***‚ÄúARE YOU LOOKING AT ME?!‚Äù***

Jesus Christ! His voice was‚Ä¶ awful! Deep and distorted, and his eyes full of sheer hatred. I stumbled back, almost toppling down the stairs. I grabbed at the rail, trying to keep my composure as I stepped backwards. As I did so, he took measured paces toward me, coming closer and closer. I turned, and I ran. Grabbing the side of the wall, I pivoted around the corner, making a beeline to the ferry‚Äôs lavatory. I could hear his footsteps, still coming down the stairs as I ripped open the bathroom door and hurled myself inside, locking the door behind me.

And there I stayed. Listening to this thing, for a human being I was now convinced it was not, knocking on the door‚Ä¶ all throughout the night.",1,1737272420.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

we we did finally talk via insta messages we started talking about random stuff and our age did come up and after BB to me he was 16 I did sorta have a breakdown and I ghosted him since I wasn't bout to catch a case, but after about a week and a half I felt bad for ghosting him so I texted him back an apology and asked if we could still be friends and he agreed and after talking for a few days, BB asked me out again and because he worded it as ""want to hang out?"" way I took it as that since I figured he wanted to still be friends and nothing else. 

so onto the date today, we met at a coffee shop downtown and we starred the ""date"" and we got ice cream and eventually we just sat around and talked for a bit, he even got bold and held my hand and he really likes my hands (something I've been very insecure about for years) and after a bit he kissed me and because I actually really like him I didn't push him off, after a while we felt less awkward and even cuddled a little (something he Initiated) and after we spent more time tonight he started getting a little bolder and I didn't stop him.

after a fee more times of use kissing we started to makeout a little bit even on the bench in the shopping center downtown, he stuck his tounge in my mouth and even held the back of my head and hip to hold me closer to him, I never initiated it but I never stopped him tho. He even kissed my neck and gave me a hickey in public too so I was embarrassed that he was bold but I was also very happy he was bold. BB even asked me on another date and I agreed but of course I don't want to say I'm ""dating"" him when I'm actually older then him since it's illegal and such, so I'd want to wait till he's 20 or something so it's less weird, but I have to ask,

It has been medium-distance when I leave for school. We have a good time together when I am home, and I feel we have the same values, interests, and goals in life. I love spending time with his friends and family. I love him a lot, but unfortunately, recently, it has felt like he hasn't put in the same effort as he used to. I know he struggles with depression, and I want to be as understanding of his struggles as I possibly can. His father is terminally ill, and he only just recovered from a wrist injury that he dealt with for a year.  It was hard for him to work as a mechanic because of the injury, so he quit and started a mechanical engineering degree last semester.  When dealing with his negative attitude regarding life and his situation, it's hard for it not to impact me. I am dealing with my struggles as well, as I am graduating this spring with my bachelor's in nursing, and I have a lot on my plate. I try to be as optimistic as I can when he gets upset, but it is hard to keep up the positive energy. It seems as if his mood will do a complete 180 even when I feel like things are calm and good. He will get angry at one minute thing, and he will slam doors, slam whatever he was messing with, stomp around, and not tell me what is wrong...Or if he loses his keys/wallet, he will stomp around and dishevel the room so he can find what he is looking for. There was one situation a few months ago where I had meant for us to go to the grocery store earlier in the day, and I had made a comment- not in malice- about how I'd been trying to get us to go. We had just made it in his car, and he got upset at what I said and aggressively spun the car around, slamming the brakes and whipping it out of the drive, and commented, ""Well, you said you wanted to go to the store earlier."" I cried in the car. He felt somewhat bad.. he apologized and bought me a coffee. Sometimes, he gets into moods where he is clearly not happy about SOMETHING... but he won't tell me what it is. He will even invite me to come over or come over to pick me up, and he will be in such a terrible mood and not want to talk. So then, the entire time we are hanging out, his bad mood lingers through the day and there is no resolution. Sometimes, I feel so connected with him, but other times, I feel as if he doesn't care for me. When I am at school which is a few hours away, I always initiate texts, tell him good morning, ask how his day went. It doesn't seem like he actually cares about what I have to say or what I am doing with my day.  Last year, we talked about whether I would want to move in with him once i graduate, and I decided recently that it wouldn't be possible with my situation. I have no money to support myself, I have a lot of loans that I owe, and I was just going to live at home until I can be independent. This upset him. He had expected me to move in with him, and he insisted that I wouldn't have to pay rent if I helped pay for groceries and kept the house clean. This isn't exactly the only reason I am hesitant about moving in there. The house is not in good condition itself. He has roommates right now, but he said he would kick them out in order for me to live there. When he lived alone, the place was messy, and I was not trying to clean after another person's messes, but I also understand it might be different when you actually live together. This makes me feel somewhat like he doesn't have my best interest in mind. Another issue came up recently, when I came home from winter break. He basically told me that he felt insecure about me potentially making more money than him in the future, and he felt like I was going to leave him for someone ""better"" once I graduate. It seems like he will be vague in text, when something like this is subconsciously in disarray. I don't know. Let me know your interpretations.

1) I brought a Coffee Grinder and Coffee Beans - Set to Coarse and I am unclear on the many different variation of ratios, 1:5 or 1:8 or 1:10, I want to make a jug for my wife to mix with milk and I can use the same coffee but maybe add water and ice so I can drink it black. Should I just do 1:5 and add water/ice to my glass? I understand I'll probably have to make a few batches until I find the right ratio... But what is the general ratio for medium roast?

2) I brought a 'coffee' brew pot off [Amazon ](https://imgur.com/MuDmnQo)but it won't be delivered until tomorrow so I decided to go down to my local store and purchased a cheap $8 (AUD) pitcher with a infuser for coffee/tea from [Kmart ](https://imgur.com/a/xF0NtWB)(Australian version) however upon now looking at them both, the infusers won't even fit 120g of coffee (1:5 ratio / 600ml water) and even if I just stick the entire infuser full of coffee (80g) and I empty a bottle of water into the pitcher, [it only touches the tip of the infuser](https://imgur.com/undefined), wouldn't this just defeat the entire purpose of 'brewing' as it's not even wetting the top of the infuser? If I fill it up, it would be 1.5litres to 80grams of coffee and that sounds way too diluted and becomes 1:15 almost. Could someone explain this to me the purpose of these jugs if the ratio of space available in the infuser to water is so drastic? I ended up putting all the water and coffee into the jug and sitting in the fridge, and tomorrow I'll just strain it through the infuser a couple of times...

Hey guys, I went on a date with a cute Korean guy 2-3 weeks ago. He speaks perfect English, but came from Korea like 3 months ago.
We met up for coffee one evening and which he paid for and proceeded to chat until the cafe closed at 9pm, he walked me back to my car and asked for a hug.
I drove off and upon arriving home realized he messaged me on bumble asking for my phone number while giving me his. We texted frequently the day after and he revealed that he wanted to kiss me before we left. And that he was imagining pulling me close / kissing me. But he held himself back. He also revealed that he found me very attractive 8.5/10, but was shy to make a move. I initially was scared to meet him because although his photos made him look like a K-pop idol or singles inferno contestant. The only thing I couldn't see was his face. He blocked his face with his phone in every bumble picture. I was worried about going because I thought it was fishy and potentially dangerous. but my friends convinced me to go.
During the date he told me that his previous gfs often complained to him asking if he really even liked him. And that the two other dates he's been on, one girl really likes him, but he's not into her at all / doesn't find her attractive. But she still pursues him. I asked him why does he continue to talk to her if this is the case, but he said he didn't want to be rude because she's Korean. All this to say, that I think he's used to women chasing him. He is cute, dresses very well and has a cute face with dimplec He's also an MD working for a pharmaceutical V startup.

l asked if he wanted to meet up, he said he did but didn't message to make plans. And this gave me anxiety, so I told him that I prefer someone a little bit more forward. And that he doesn't like me and is only looking for s*x. The morning after I apologized and he said he understands and it's okay.

After that he didn't text me for a week. The fires in LA just happened and he popped up again asking if I was okay. After some brief convo, he ghosted me again.

Another week passed and he popped up again asking how I was doing. I said I was fine but bored.

He mentioned that he's coming back from a business trip and that we could make plans to meet up, once l asked where, he ghosted me again. Every time we talk like a week goes by. And i was kind of sick of it.
I feel like my answer is that he's not that into me and just stringing me along for an ego boost. But the other half of me says he does like me? Idk what to think.

I ultimately told him that I don't really appreciate being strung along and that I don't really want to chase someone either. That there's no hard feelings and that I don't want to meetup with someone who does that to me.

What do you guys think? What do you think was his intention? How do you think I handled it? Pls try not to be too mean. Dating is anxiety inducing and I'm trying my best to manage it better.",1,1737271249.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I just wanted to get a few opinions as I'm weighing it all up and I'm honest I really want to but a little scared to take the leap which I suppose is natural.

A commercial premises has become available at a local train station within the ticket hall. It's a small station with 4 trains an hour, has around 1200 daily users (500k yearly) and this has increased year on year. plus a number of housing developments and offices nearby that are brand new. It is the only premises within and currently operates as a convinience store/take away coffee.

I'm planning to make mine a premium coffee takeaway and offering pastries and limited snacks/drinks.

Is it unrealistic to calculate sales conversion of the footfall at 5% so 75 customers per day or am I being pessimistic?

I have a full time job which is fairly flexible so I can hopefully manage both at the same time but I'll be looking to employ someone to do the day to day running of the shop. How have people dealt with staffing issues ie sickness or last minute leaving without notice?

Well, but this is what happened yesterday - He called and told me 'The coffee bags stock is over, and I am already hooked to it. You should have ordered it in surplus'. That was such a wholesome moment for me :p

I‚Äôm envisaging them tucked in a bookshelf or shelf somewhere. I don‚Äôt like people who touch you without permission, I know I can be a bit uptight but I also think I‚Äôm quite relaxed for the most part but also don‚Äôt put your hands on my shoulders and neck?! I don‚Äôt know you?! Ick. Some man had a stall and he was trying to get mum and I to try the product it was like a bees wax balm and that was fine and I said sure so I rubbed a bit into my hand and said it smelled like
a natural Vicks and then he started saying yeah do you get sore shoulders and neck and I said no not really as I was starting to walk away and he just reached out to start rubbing my shoulders or something and so I ducked out the way a bit because no thanks? I just laughed and said no really I‚Äôm fine. But mum wasn‚Äôt so quick and he landed his beeswaxy palms on her like under her shirt a bit on the shoulders? Like excuse me sir but how about don‚Äôt. Anyway then we just wandered around. I felt so heinous and icky, I had zero makeup on and I‚Äôm having a good hair day so that was nice idk what it is when I‚Äôm here but I washed it last night and didn‚Äôt put any serum or anything in and woke up to it being soft and bouncy and shiny - though it could use some shaping but anyway. But anyway I just felt yuck and ugly and then the sun was out and people were everywhere and I could feel myself getting ‚Äúoverstimulated‚Äù - I don‚Äôt mind crowds on the whole at all, tbh I like them, but not when I‚Äôm with others and am relying on them to move too. I like being on my own and I can move at a speed and route I want. But my handbag was also slipping off my shoulder and I just felt jsgshsgslagshsjagai. 

I‚Äôm starting to really think I don‚Äôt want children. I saw a guy with his kids and they were going to the playground and I just thought god i don‚Äôt ever want to have to do that like just this really determined voice in my head thinking NO THANKS. I think kids are great and I adore them, but I‚Äôm thinking more and more they aren‚Äôt for me. I don‚Äôt want them, I just wonder what life would be like with one or if I will regret not having one and that‚Äôs not a reason to have one. I think I‚Äôm just not going to be a mother? I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm still undecided but I‚Äôm leaning more towards not doing it. 

I want friends I can have dinner parties with. Just a small handful. And we can have girls dinners every few months and one of us hosts and we can have them be themed or just whatever - like seasonal ones! Spring, summer, autumn and winter! And the food and table scape can match the theme a little bit :) That would be so fun! I wonder which one I would want to host? Hm. Anyway I just think that would be fun. I want girlfriends who I can do that with, read and talk about books obsessively with, go see music and shows and the ballet and everything together, go for casual lil meals and coffees out, go for walks together and have movie nights and maybe a lil girls weekend sort of trip to a spa and like an annual or biannual girls night because lord knows I am not a night out girly but I also still love the idea of getting dolled up with makeup and heels and a pretty outfit and perfume and my hair all done and going for dinner and cocktails and dancing and getting tipsy! It‚Äôs fun! It‚Äôs just I don‚Äôt like it often. And then getting to come home to my baby. I also kinda feel like almost nothing makes you feel internally sluttier than a girls night where you feel nice and get nice comments or whatever and then you get to come home and get railed to absolute bits by your man - dream, no? I just feel like, and this is from memory, but all the time getting dolled up and girl talk and cocktails and dancing just primes you for it, or at least it does for me. I remember having girls nights out when I was with R and I‚Äôd come home and go utterly savage on him. I think it‚Äôs just all that pent up energy and I don‚Äôt flirt with men if I‚Äôm with someone even when I‚Äôm tipsy like I truly am just not like that at all and never have been - apart from once and again was with R but we were barely together and I was a party and chatting to a guy on a sofa and had my legs draped over him - that thought and guilt still haunts me. Anyway. Enough about that loser. I just want friends I can do that with. And I also want to feel like I want to do that stuff. I know I do want to, I mean obviously because look I‚Äôm writing about it! But i get in my head. Anyway. 

I‚Äôve had a lot of puppy cuddles today. He came and had a nap with me earlier for like half an hour or a bit longer and I didn‚Äôt sleep but he did and he was all wrapped up in my arms and he was so warm and cuddly. I took him for a lil walk earlier, not a ‚Äúproper‚Äù one as still don‚Äôt have shoes so I wore some sandals to the park and walked barefoot in the grass a few times with him so he could have some running about. I love my baby puppy so much. 

I have nothing really to say other than - *Andy* ‚ù§Ô∏è

I felt better today. A lot better. Well less in my head, my general hopeless mindset is still very much here but I am able to manage it today which I struggled to yesterday. I think I would have felt better regardless, but puppy helps SO much.

1i4sqrg,https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/1i4sqrg/diary_of_a_tea_brand/,Diary of a tea brand,"Hi!

A few months ago, my partner Wen-Hsuan and I decided to start a project related to tea.  
It all began out of pure ignorance (mine, to be specific). 

The tea culture in Europe is quite lacking (except for the UK), and ever since I was introduced to it, I‚Äôve grown to appreciate tea more and more, becoming increasingly interested in finding high-quality tea (My favorite is oolong tea). Wen-Hsuan is from Taiwan, so her experience is completely different. She‚Äôs always had access to high-quality tea as part of her daily life.

I really enjoy tea culture. While coffee is often associated with speed, productivity, and a hectic pace, tea represents reflection, tranquility, and calm.

That‚Äôs when we asked ourselves: what if we tried to bring tea from Taiwan and export it to Europe? It‚Äôs this learning process that [we want to document](https://buttondown.com/slowteaclub/archive/). In fact, this March, we‚Äôll be going to Taiwan for three months to visit tea fields and deeply understand how to source high-quality tea.

With that said, I wanted to ask:

* Do you have any good resources for learning about tea? 
* How can you distinguish high-quality tea from lower-quality tea? 
* Any advice from those with more knowledge?

Thank you! :)

My cousin/friend and I wanted to try some new things out from this restaurant we love. Neither one of us had ever had enchiladas, flautas or horchata so we wanted to try them. I'd also never had the quesadilla from here or the vegan chicken taco and hot those too. 

We got our enchiladas with smokey mole sauce but it wasn't really for us. It was still nice to try. We did however really like the flautas and the horchata. I absolutely love horchata now and I would definitely prefer it over coffee. The quesadilla reminded me of A&W's beyond burger but that is likely due to them using beyond chorizo. It was still delicious and I would eat it again. The chicken gringo taco was good too but my heart is still with the fishless tacos (I love fishless tacos so much). We both liked the side of rice too.  The churro was perfection and we got a vegan chocolate sauce for dipping. 

We got so much food that I ended up saving my tamals for tomorrow and I have some leftover rice/refried beans too. I plan to make tacos with the leftovers. Overall it was a nice meal and it was fun to try new things together üíö",2,1737269544.0,MediocreVeganFoodPorn,0,1.0,False

we we did finally talk via insta messages we started talking about random stuff and our age did come up and after BB to me he was 16 I did sorta have a breakdown and I ghosted him since I wasn't bout to catch a case, but after about a week and a half I felt bad for ghosting him so I texted him back an apology and asked if we could still be friends and he agreed and after talking for a few days, BB asked me out again and because he worded it as ""want to hang out?"" way I took it as that since I figured he wanted to still be friends and nothing else. 

so onto the date today, we met at a coffee shop downtown and we starred the ""date"" and we got ice cream and eventually we just sat around and talked for a bit, he even got bold and held my hand and he really likes my hands (something I've been very insecure about for years) and after a bit he kissed me and because I actually really like him I didn't push him off, after a while we felt less awkward and even cuddled a little (something he Initiated) and after we spent more time tonight he started getting a little bolder and I didn't stop him.

after a fee more times of use kissing we started to makeout a little bit even on the bench in the shopping center downtown, he stuck his tounge in my mouth and even held the back of my head and hip to hold me closer to him, I never initiated it but I never stopped him tho. He even kissed my neck and gave me a hickey in public too so I was embarrassed that he was bold but I was also very happy he was bold. BB even asked me on another date and I agreed but of course I don't want to say I'm ""dating"" him when I'm actually older then him since it's illegal and such, so I'd want to wait till he's 20 or something so it's less weird, but I have to ask,

I would also make my own at home that were quite tasty but unfortunately my favorite concentrate is loaded with sugar(Tazo and Oregon Chai). Are there any substitutions I can make or any brands without added sugar that taste good? The problem with me is that my drinks have to be sweet. Like, I can‚Äôt drink unsweetened tea. I know it‚Äôs bad. I have experimented with matcha now but am trying to figure out how to make it taste good and be sweet without sugar. Any advice?

I ignored it at first, but it quickly became uncomfortable and agitating. I tried to move to the other couch but they started moving in the direction I was, when I asked them to stop or just not have it facing me because it makes me uncomfortable they accused me of trying to look.

I had to try and explain for the next 20 minutes that I‚Äôm not trying to look, and the whole reason i want them to stop is BECAUSE I don‚Äôt want to. 

They didn‚Äôt try to listen, instead just seeing me as weird and controlling, And I‚Äôm starting to doubt myself.

I‚Äôm having an issue with my **SMEG Manual Espresso Coffee Machine with Built-In Grinder**, and I‚Äôm hoping someone can help. The machine's lights keep flashing (attached photo/video for reference), and I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs causing it or how to fix it.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve tried so far:

* Ensured the water tank is full and correctly seated.
* Checked the bean hopper for jams or blockages in the grinder.
* Cleaned the machine and grinder area.
* Restarted the machine (turned it off, unplugged, and waited before turning it back on).

Despite these steps, the lights continue to flash. I couldn‚Äôt find anything specific in the manual to explain this issue. Does anyone know what these flashing lights mean or how to fix it?

Thanks in advance for any advice!

From: https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/osdkcd/why_does_my_whole_bean_coffee_taste_lose_its/

I use the James Hoffmann aeropress recipe and adjust accordingly with the coffee compass. I feel as if my technique + water is decent (barista hustle recipes) and beans are fresh and rested (I also use airtight containers for storage). 

Recently I've found that as I'm going through the bag the bean flavour becomes muted and flat. I changed up the water recipe and it went back to having flavour before becoming flat again after some time. 

I've then reverted to my initial water recipe and the taste seems to have improved.

1i4sfsh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i4sfsh,"Greater Seattle, WA, USA area home game","We played our first round of the home game a couple weekends ago to celebrate someone‚Äôs birthday. We used the greater Seattle area with a starting point of a mall parking lot with a breakfast option to meet up. The hiders took their Snackle-box off to find a good place in an hour, while the seekers did some research and planning over breakfast. We adapted a few things to have teams of 2, use cars (plus any form of public transportation including rental bikes/scooters/ferries/etc all available in this area), selected an intersection instead of train station, and unlimited size card hand. We played the medium game, and our first hiders earned a time of 4hrs:12mins including the 18min bonus card. Since this was a birthday weekend we tried to send the seekers off on fun challenges/curses that added time but also just made the day more enjoyable! The favorite parts of the day were the seekers‚Äô ‚Äúvacation‚Äù at a mall where they brought us souvineer pretzels and Photo Booth strips, and when I yelled ‚Äúsquirrel!‚Äù Out the car window and drove off quickly to go get a photo, leaving my partner confused in a random parking lot. (We had just drawn the curse where you need an animal/insect/bird photo to make the seekers find a similar species.)

Things we learned that were helpful:

1) Study your map zones ahead of time to find tentacle items, bodies of water, cafes, etc and try to hide somewhere with some interesting features. It‚Äôs more fun to throw them off your trail, and to have answers other than ‚Äúnot applicable for my zone‚Äù

2) a quarter mile is reaaaallly small if you are in cars. You can just drive back and forth without having to ask questions at the end. Also, it‚Äôs hard to find hiding zones with much in them (Seattle is not as dense as Japan).

3) As hiders you really won‚Äôt have downtime like they do in the show. There is no ‚Äúresearch for 2hrs while on a train‚Äù in a medium game. We thought we would have time to have a picnic, knit, walk around, stop for food, etc. And we had to stop game time to get a bathroom break in! It was an action packed 4hrs! But soooo much fun! Be sure the seekers only ask 1 question at a time and you draw cards before moving on. It‚Äôs tough when trying to answer a question, drive or walk around and find research options or next moves. It‚Äôs tough to get curses back if you aren‚Äôt staying on top of the order things happen. Find ways to slow the pace down with forced bathroom breaks or time btwn questions to allow for thinking ahead üëç

4) Set up ground rules ahead and be ok with asking for clarification on questions. It‚Äôs always better for the seekers to give more info than needed. Like ‚Äúwe are 5 miles from a coastline- are you further or closer‚Äù to save the hiders some research time.

5) Bring a separate device just for tracking the seekers! As a hider, clicking back and forth btwn windows on a phone took time, and we found the tracker app wasn‚Äôt as accurate on where the seekers were if we closed and opened it a lot instead of having it open. It also makes answering questions faster!

6) Take pics of the day and take time for fun ü§ó As home game enjoyers, remember it IS just a game and you aren‚Äôt being filmed every minute. If you need a break, take one! If you want to stop for coffee- do it!

I started recovery like 6 months ago and right now I am doing really well mentally in my covery in most aspects. I really do want to gain weight. Ive loved lifting weights for a long time so now I want to be strong and gain weight. But ever since I started recovery, I've had lots of GI issues. I think my recovery is probably very different from what I see in posts but I guess every journey is different. By the 2nd month I was eating non stop. Felt like my body was trying to play catch-up with all the food it had missed out on. That lasted about a month and I did gain some weight back. But then I started getting super nauseous after I ate. Not from overeating, from eating literally anything from a few bites to a snack to a meal. Nog once have I actually thrown up but I feel sick to the point of not moving or talking just laying down for an hour or so til I feel better. Because it's did just go away after a while. I have emetophobia and have had allergy related stomach problems growing up so this just completely discouraged me from eating anything. I only want to eat at home because I can go to my room and be alone. Feeling sick at work is my worst nightmare and it happens almost daily now. I would just rely on coffee and nicotine at work and then eat something at dinner and deal with the nausea. But I felt and still feel frustrated and stuck because I now mentally want to recover. After about 2 months the really bad stomach issues went away but not fully. My stomach is extremely sensitive to what will feel fine vs not and I will still get extreme nausea often. I know that now a lot of it is anxiety driven too. I have so much anxiety around eating because of the initial 2 months of it being so bad and when I'm anxious it makes the stomach problems worse which makes me more anxious and so on. Vicious cycle. I carry zofran with me at all times and take it pretty regularly. But it makes me super constipated so that sucks bc that doesn't make my stomach feel great either. Part of this is just venting but also has anyone else experienced this when recovering? I'm so worried that being anorexic did some permanent or serious damage to my GI system. I'll be so sad if I figure out that's the case. I am in the process of getting medical insurance. Its been an annoying long process but I should be getting insurance soon and this will be #1 on my list to get an appointment for. It's so debilitating honestly and causes me so much anxiety I hate it. I try to drink mint or ginger tea a lot and eat lots of fresh ginger.

My sister(28F) and I (26F)have never gotten along our entire childhood. We are complete opposits, and not getting along as children has turned into little to no contact as adults. Both of us are content with this. Lately we've been having quite a bit of arguments due to our opposite views. I am agnostic, un-biased to politics and  intentionally childfree. She's  very religious mormon, republican. She has 4 children, pregnant with her 5th and wants at least 8. 
Our parents has the same religious and political views as her, and she's the only one giving them grandchildren. Naturally, she would be favoured . My biggest issue is, she's never told ""no"". She's been a spoiled brat her entire life. Ever since her first child, she drops off all of her children to our parents house, leaving them there overnight several times a week because she ""needs a break"". If they made plans, they have to cancel them to cater to her needs. It doesnt matter what they had going on, the moment she calls, they do what she asks. Last week was where it finally drew the line for me. It was our fathers birthday and he was looking forward to going to his favourite restaurant. He also asked if I could make his favourite dessert, which is tarimasu. He gave my sister an entire week notice stating that he didn't want any children sleeping over on his birthday so he could sleep in. She got very annoyed by his request and said she ""can't promise anything."" The day before his birthday,  she pulls up to their house 4 kids and overnight bags in hand. I was over that day to make his dessert and that's where this argument took place. I confronted her, stating dads request for no children to spend the night on his birthday. She said she ""needed a break, and needed to make her own request to mum and dad"". She told me to make something other than tiramisu because the smell of coffee triggers her morning sickness. She demanded to our mum to cancel dads dinner reservation and get takeaway instead because she felt too tired to go out, and didnt like that resturant. Our mother of course, agreeded with no hesitation. 
Her statements pissed me off so much that this is where I'm asking if im the asshole. After her tangent to our mother, I told her that she is 28 and needs to grow the hell up. I said that its incredibly rude to constantly drop her children at our parents place and expect them to take care of them. If she wants 8 children, she should bear the consequences of the effort and exhaustion that'll come with it. It's rude to come to their house, demanding things for our dads birthday. What she wants on his day does not matter. If she doesn't want to go out, she can stay home. If the smell of coffee is making her sick, she can not have any tiramisu. This turned into a huge argument between her and our mother and myself. Apparently, because I don't have children, I could never understand what she's going through and I need to be more sensitive and reliable. That if I allowed her to drop off her kids at my place, it could lighten the load on our mum and dad. Absolutely not. My home is child free and will always be childfree. I questioned how tired she could actually be when she's a stay at home mum who only has her kids in the house maybe 4 days out of the week. She needed to act her age and realise that not everyone is going to cater to her ridiculous requests. Our dad, bless him, to keep the peace agreed to get takeout and a cake from the shop instead. I can't get over the smug look on my sisters face. So, I took my dad out to dinner, just him and I to the restaurant he wanted to go to and shared the tiramisu I made. I sent everyone else a text to enjoy their takeaway, dad deserves to have his day the way he wants it.
That is when I got texts and missed calls from family members saying that I was too harsh on my sister, I shouldn't have told my sister to grow up and she's very upset over what I said. I've been told to apologise, but I'm not budging. Someone needs to tell her no and I'm not apologising for anything I said. Our father, my boyfriend and my auntie agree with me, but don't want to speak about it to my sister. So, reddit, AITA for telling my sister to grow up?",2,1737268353.0,AITAH,6,1.0,False

My brother is TBM but pretty JackMo, growing up in a small Mormon community in Missouri. We went to seminary early before school like most Mormons outside Utah‚Äîmaybe they have in-school seminary in Idaho, idk, I digress. The point is, he was used to partying and stuff while still going to church every Sunday. Well, he started dating this girl, we'll call her ""Eve"" (My brother can be ""Adam"" üòä).

They date for a while (at the behest of my parents) and would later secretly go on a senior trip together to South Padre Island, making my mom think it was him and 3 friends, when really it was about 12 partner couples. Adam brought back cigars and stories of wild beach parties. My TBM mom found out (obviously) and freaked out; the girl is ""taking my Adam down the wrong path""‚Äîsleepless nights... constant admonishments to us about his behavior, the standard boomer TBM rote phrases.

Well, one day Adam gets a revelation. After smoking a joint on the roof outside his bedroom window (parents were out of town), Adam climbed back inside and swears to this day he was visited by my dead grandfather's spirit to go on a mission.

**Side note about my grandpa to give context:** Grandpa was beaten and abused by his alcoholic LDS father in Sugar House, Utah, from 3 y/o (the time his mother died) until he went into the foster system. IDK what age he was then, but he was in & out of abusive foster homes til he ran away at 13 y/o to fake his age and get a DL (stating he was actually 16 y/o). Then, when he actually turned 16 (stating he was 18), he joined the Air Force and took apart bombs the rest of his life, until retirement (he was also colorblind ü§Ø).

The significance of this, you ask... Grandpa smoked and drank most of his life, loved coffee too (along w/ Grandma), but my TBM mom (his biological daughter) wouldn't let him around his grandchildren unless he quit smoking etc. Basically, no one admits it, but my mom and her siblings (the TBM ones) manipulated him and my grandma into becoming active in the church and eventually getting sealed in the brand new St. Louis Temple (where I tripped Gordon B. Hinkley üòà).

He was faithful and served callings, but he was a dwindling old man with Type 1 Diabetes (insulin-dependent), COPD (constant O2), and all the comorbidities that follow years of those conditions. He wasn't a TBM... he was just active to fill a void older people often feel and to maintain a relationship with his family. Whether he actually had a testimony, I don't think anyone knows. He was sooo quiet.

Which is why, of all people to ""visit"" in spirit, it would be someone who recently died (emotional reaction), that could seem like a pillar of strength‚Äîa person beaten and off the right path, that corrected and stayed true... when in my reality, Adam consumed a psychotropic substance, and constructed that experience, noting the alternative narrative of my grandpa... Adam ""envisioned"" grandpa because he had died 1‚Äì2 years prior, and he was a man we loved and connected to very deeply. But Grandpa never really spoke about the abuse. It wasn't until years after he died that his relatives told us how much he endured at the hands of so many ""so-called"" Mormons.

He would never (IMO) be the one to visit anyone and rebuke them for living a life of aimless frivolity (especially at 19 y/o). Anyway, the ""visit"" sobered Adam up, so to speak, and he applied to serve his mission.

Before the mission, as he's preparing and correcting course, he asks her to take the missionary discussions. She takes the discussions and CONVERTS... I believe he got to baptize her too!

He gets called to Samara, Russia (not the easiest place to send/receive communication). While he's there, he also gets Type 1 DM, and healthcare in Russia is not good. Let‚Äôs just say hospitals close on weekends, and you get better care if you give nice gifts to your nurses... all of them. So they stabilize him in Russia at some qualified hospital, he gets sent to the U.S., where he's evaluated again, but near customs‚Äîor the border, I think (memory is fuzzy on the nitty gritties)‚Äîbut... she ""Dear John's"" him.

About 1.5 years in, she sends the ""Dear John"" letter because she found a Mormon guy at college. IDK how many weeks it normally takes to get a letter from the U.S. to Russia, but Adam wasn't even in Samara when she sent it, so the letter is lost in limbo, while Adam is none the wiser. Finally, the letter gets rerouted to my parents, in another state‚Äînot close to Eve, Adam, or anyone else in the family, for that matter.

My psychotic TBM mom opens the letter CLEARLY addressed to Elder Adam from Eve. It basically says she still loves him and wishes him the best, but she found a ""John"" at college and wishes ""Adam"" well. Eve had no idea that Adam was on his way home from Russia (the whole reason the letter was forwarded to my parents).

A few weeks go by as Adam is released and off to my parents' new home. Once Adam reaches home, TBM Mom uses the letter to manipulate him into not pursuing the girl and finishing his mission stateside (an offer/recommendation from the church). But Adam was told he had served enough of the 2-year commitment, that a stateside mission would be available, but they would formally conclude his mission as honorably served if he declined the remaining months.

Back to Adam. He is furious (she opened his mail, she tried breaking up his relationship \[through manipulation\], she disparaged the girl he loved and CONVERTED to the faith‚Äîno small task for a 19 y/o prior to his mission). So he moved to ""Eve's"" local area as fast as he could and turned up the RIZZ dial (missionaries can sell anything!).

She dumped ""John,"" and Adam married Eve soon after.

They are still married and now have a beautiful family. Still TBM too.

TRIGGER WARNING: The post includes mentions of suicidal thoughts

sorry in advance for the long post..

I'm in a relationship for 6 years that can be divided into three main stages:

**Stage 1**: The first 2.5 years were amazing! we used to stand by each other, travel, adventure, and explore life. We come from different religious backgrounds and that is a big taboo in our culture and is even illegal.. we fought to be together and didn't care for that.

She had troubling traumatic experiences of living through a war and becoming a refugee then separated from family members and didn't see them again for over 9 years which definetely took a toll on her. Anyways, this meant that she had anger issues, sometimes suicidal thoughts, can lash out easily, can fall in depression easily and so on.

That being said, she was fighting it, going to therapy, taking care of herself, trying to get out of her comfort zone, try new things and I was happy attracted to her reselience.

**Stage 2:** We both travelled to different countries for grad studies so we did 2 years in long-distance. We only met twice (once per year) but were videocalling every day. During this period she was so irritated by everything, would fight people around her all the time, felt ungrateful and highly critical of everything being offered to her and would always be talking about how she deserves a better education or better friends or better house or better documents ... literally everything.

This negative energy was just eating up everything, she couldn't enjoy any moments even when we met the second time in a super romantic camping trip (that's our thing), all we did was just fighting.

**Stage 3:** The last 1.5 years we have been reunited and it has been a rollercoaster between hell and meh ok-ish times. When I first arrived, she was in a VERY VERY bad place. Her suicidal tendancies were so frequent, but not in a depression flee way more in a threatening tone. She would use suicide to threaten me whenever I said or acted in a way that she did not like. Her anger issues became more extreme, she would not only shout but throw stuff, scream non-stop, pull her hair, hit her head, if I try to intervene she starts to shove and become more aggressive.

I tried to break up and she attempted suicide and I had to call paramedics in.. we also had our neighbours call the police on us twice suspecting there might be domestic violence because all they can hear is screaming and throwing things...

When things go against her will, she would instantly collapse into this mood.. even if it's a tiny thing. For example, one time she asked me to make her a coffee but I was running late for work so I couldn't.. she snapped out shouting that I always value other things over her, take her for granted, then followed me to my workplace and stood outside shouting and yelling until security got involved and asked her to leave.

Lately I have been so drained, I feel that I have tried over this 1.5 year everything I could but it is like she has given up. Even though our life now is ""better"" in terms of having our own place that was an amazing find, stable jobs, financially not bad, have better chances for travelling.. but she does not enjoy any of it and I feel like she doesn't even want to try. The only thing she is interested in now is smoking weed non-stop all the time in crazy amounts.. no interest in therapy, no interest in going out of the house, no interest in trying new restaurants, or going to bars/cafes or learning something new.. all she can see is things that she does not have and complain about them.

I can sense in the last 2 months an ""improvement"" but coupled with total dependency on me.. everything in her daily life is dependent on me doing it. For example, I write her emails, write her cover letters when applying for new jobs, do the laundry all the time, dishes most of the time, most food and drinks and so on, she just always says that she has no energy for anything.

When I talk to her about how we can get out of this, she just says it is part of her healing journey, she experienced over 15 years of consequences for the war that she left and this is her first time to catch a breath and confront reality.. I think she is actually withdrawing not confronting and do not know if I'm being manipulated/abused or if I should just ride this wave a little longer or if I'm a bad person to think about leaving her when I know this would significantly disrupt her wellbeing...

Lately, I've been digging into the fascinating world of¬†**commodity markets**, and I can't help but notice the growing impact of converging trends shaping the industry. From supply chain dynamics to macroeconomic shifts, these interconnections are influencing not just commodities, but¬†**global trade**¬†as a whole.

Here are some key trends I‚Äôve been thinking about:

1. **Energy Transition and Its Ripple Effect:**¬†The shift towards renewable energy is shaking up traditional markets like oil and gas. But here‚Äôs the kicker‚Äîit‚Äôs also driving demand in metals like lithium, cobalt, and copper. Could we see these metals become as pivotal as crude oil once was?
2. **Climate Change and Harvest Volatility:**¬†Agricultural commodities like corn, wheat, and coffee are feeling the heat (literally). Droughts, floods, and changing growing seasons are altering yields. What does this mean for food prices and trade dependencies?
3. **Geopolitical Tensions:**¬†Sanctions, trade wars, and political upheavals are throwing traditional trade flows into chaos. For example, disruptions in fertilizer exports have had a domino effect on agricultural markets worldwide. Anyone else concerned about how these tensions might reshape alliances and supply chains?
4. **Tech & Speculation:**¬†The rise of sophisticated trading strategies (thanks, algorithms!) and the growing role of speculators are transforming price dynamics. Do you think this is helping or hurting smaller producers and emerging markets?

There's so much to unpack here, and I‚Äôd love to get your perspectives! Are these trends creating more stability or chaos in the¬†**commodity markets**? What do you think the long-term impact will be on¬†**market trends**¬†and¬†**global trade**?

Would love to hear your takes and see if there are other dynamics I‚Äôve missed. It‚Äôs crazy how interconnected this world is, right?

1: the quality of life is really bad. There isn‚Äôt much to do on the island. Campus is super small and there‚Äôs no fun activities. The gym is small too, not nearly enough for the amount of students there are. 

2: for some reason, practically everything is closed on the weekends. The coffee shop and all ‚Äúrestaurants‚Äù (cheap knockoffs of chipotle and subway) are closed. The dining hall has super weird times (opens at 10 am and serves mediocre food)

3: the closest actual restaurants (fast food chains, diners, bars) are all 2+ miles away. Not accessible unless you have a car. Nothing is available walking distance. 

There are some solid positives too:

1: closer relationship with professors. Class sizes are small and you‚Äôll often have the same professors several semesters in a row. 

2: dorms are super close to classes. I once woke up 5 minutes before class started and made it on time.

(Massive read)","I basically wrote the following massive text to chatgpt for help (I'm brain dead), I know people here don't like to read a lot or help if I'm not a female or relate to what I'm struggling with, at the end there will be a TL;DR (which I also asked chatgpt) if someone can help me as to how I should go into this situation I'd really appreciate it:  
Hey so I am a student in university, I'm studying something related to IT and software engineering, but the career is called Computational Systems Engineering. The career is comprised of 12 semesters, and I'm currently in the process of entering 6th semester. So I've had a massive problem with social anxiety throughout my entire life, drug addiction, alcoholism and such, but essentially, I don't really feel nor do I understand why people interact with each other, even if I try to interact with people, I can't really keep that going for a long time, as I don't feel like it. In this sense, something like Exposure Therapy does not work for me, considering I've been exposed to a social environment for this long and things have only gotten worse, even more so, I have found classmates that I could've potentially felt comfortable with. Taking this into consideration, I have not been able to feel comfortable around any of them, and I've already tried a lot. Here's the thing, when the whole Covid thing happened, I had dropped out from a previous uni and career, I had hit rock bottom many times mainly because of my alcoholism and such. Thereafter I spent around a year completely isolated, drinking and smoking literally every day, so when I decided to study again and get into where I am right now, I had a lot of hope things would be better. I really put in the effort, and going back to what I said about exposure therapy not working, it turned out, when you make relationships with people, things will only get more complicated. Let me explain my thought process behind this, as it is entirely different for different people. So when you start interacting with someone for the first time, you'll probably find things or topics in common, or there will be an exchange of interesting facts so as to make things more interesting. After a certain period of time, for someone like me, there will be no more interesting things to talk about, and even then, at first, I try to be more social, but eventually I just get tired of it. Now, there are these two classmates that I got to know a lot better in third semester, as we got to work together on projects and such, and there were a lot of things that happened that made us bond, I had talked to them and shared with them some of these limitations that I have, especially apologizing for being asocial and cold, as I don't really deal well with interactions. That being said, from there onwards, every semester we would get in contact with each other in a group we have (only the three of us) to see which group we would go in. Let me explain this, before starting every semester, there will be a certain day where you can log in to the uni website, and select which group you wanna go to (A, B, etc...) considering which schedule fits better for you. So we would get in contact with each other to go into the same group. The last year, things went really bad for me, I couldn't keep up with workloads, assignments, etc... what I'm gonna say now is one of my main problems and this is completely my fault. So there were certain classes I struggled a lot with, namely, differential calculus and electrical principles and digital systems. At this point, I had already quit alcohol for about two years, but kept smoking weed, and my resolution for this year was to quit cold turkey and basically go completely clean. I had achieved this so far, but I had replaced it with coffee, and this made things hard, as I couldn't sleep well at night, even if I slept I would wake up tired, I couldn't focus, very anxious all the time, you name it. So these two classmates, which by then already considered me their friend were always there to help me. They offered to help me with assignments and all, and I'm gonna be bluntly honest, I've never said or written this before but I have massive amounts of proud, I was not used to people getting things done that I couldn't, so I didn't feel comfortable accepting their help, to this day I feel the same. There were projects, specifically in electrical principles, where we had to work together on a breadboard in class, this meant the professor would be there observing everyone working and helping with questions and whatnot. So at first I barely kept up, but everything when south gradually. At some point, they were doing all the work, and they didn't really tell me anything about it. To clarify something, by this point, I had also helped them a lot with other projects and sometimes they couldn't understand something and I helped them, our relationship was to help each other no matter what, it was a very friendly environment and we were basically looking out for each other. I didn't voice things out, so this happened without us talking about it, but it was really uncomfortable to be in class with them working and me just doing nothing or on the phone. About me being on the phone on class, I'm gonna be completely honest, at first I tried to help them, but they were so good at what they were doing, I just couldn't keep up and would be all quiet, I have a massive problem with learning, my thoughts are usually scattered as a result of my anxiety and I would just completely shut down, it was something that really made me feel bad, uncomfortable and uneasy. The professor noticed I didn't help as much, but to make everything short, we passed the class, but I didn't deserve the grade we got (we got a good grade). This has since been burned in my memory, but from there on, there has been a lot of situations where I am definitely not helping them. Here's a second point I wanna make and this is also very imperative to point out: I have noticed I have narcissistic tendencies, I have made very little research about it and a few tests, it turns out I'm not entirely a narcissist. So the interaction with these classmates for the past year has been like this: I sit near them but try to stay a little bit away, sometimes I hear them talking about something and I feel left out, even though I obviously wanna be left out. They're really smart and I've always been really proud of them, to some extent, our relationship has been like siblings, I somewhat consider them like my little siblings, as they're really patient with me, and no one has been as understanding as them. Here's the problem and this breaks my heart, as I have to accept that this is something I feel and it's interfering with my life: I don't feel comfortable with them, I don't like when they send a message on the group, I don't like answering it. I don't like being around them and hearing them talking about the assignments, or talking about how to solve a problem, or anything for that matter. It's devastating to look into my heart and realize that I am jealous of them, that I wanna be better than them. I really don't like this about myself, and I've been clean long enough to clearly accept that this is an inherent part of myself, that this will not change, this is who I really am. This is not fair to them, they are really putting a lot of effort into helping me and I don't deserve it. I know my limits, I know this is not gonna change. I feel really uncomfortable to keep working with them and have been feeling like this for a long time. I know I won't find people like them, they're special, really good people, it's a shame. So next semester I wanna go into a different group, it'll probably be only A and B, but I really don't wanna tell them that I feel like this. My plan is to pretend I couldn't get into their group on time (usually, students with higher grades get to choose earlier in the morning, the lower the grade, the later you get to choose, so by evening the best group will already be full). And choose the other group. This is something I've just considered never really wrote it or voiced it out, I'm not so sure as to what to do.

**TL;DR:**

I'm a 6th-semester university student studying Computational Systems Engineering and struggling with severe social anxiety, past addiction issues, and feelings of inadequacy. Despite being clean and making an effort to rebuild my life, I find it hard to form or maintain meaningful relationships. Two classmates have been incredibly supportive, but my insecurities, jealousy, and discomfort around them have strained our bond. I don't feel deserving of their help and have decided to switch to a different group next semester to avoid them, even though they mean a lot to me. Not sure if this is the right decision, but I feel stuck.",1,1737267793.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

First item:  
I need to send a sim card to Brazil.  What is the most reliable method and what is the fastest VS cost effective.  While I am cognizant of cost, I need to be certain that I can get the card to Belo Horizonte in 2 weeks.  I would of course prefer the most reasonable cost, but if going with let say FedEx is the most reliable vs UPS, USPS, or DHL I need to know that.  I am also wondering if any or all use last mile local mail carriers.  I thought I read there was a postal issue for a bit. 

  
Second item:

I would like to send (6) 1lb (453g) bags of Dunkin' Donuts coffee to Belo also.  There are always things that change the price.  For example, sometimes businesses get better pricing.  Or sometimes a certain weight tips the scale such as anything odd sized or over 70 pounds domestically in the US.  Or in the US there is a media rate for books or videos or whatnot.  So, seeing as how I can break this up if needed, such as 3 sub kilo bags or something, what might be the best method to get it there?  And if there is a problem sending coffee, I could use a citation of any rules I might have to abide by.  For example, maybe DHL generally gets stuff through.  For the coffee, speed is less important.  I am not in a hurry; they will have their Dunkin' religious experience when it gets there. :)

Now why did I leave? It‚Äôs the awful workspace I am required to work in. The lighting is insufficient and cold with no natural light, the air conditioning is incredibly cold and smells moldy, the coffee tastes bad, the internet is slow and broken down a lot, table and seating are the cheapest Ikea stuff and the noise from coworker gossiping is very distracting. What worst, the layout is designed to put in as many seats as possible and my table is next to a pathway that has people constantly walking by. I have asked HR to make some improvement without success and I know I had to leave when I constantly find myself escaping from the office to work at a coffee shop next door to get work done.

I‚Äôve been to a few coworking spaces downtown, and I find it either expensive or lacking some of the things I need to be productive. So, I took it upon myself to create a workplace I want to work in every day.

4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Fast & stable internet

5.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Good lighting and great smell

I am not focused on the network and community but to make it a place of pure focus and productivity. It will open in Feb 25 and I want to share this with anyone who live aroud the area and wanting to try it out.

The last year, things went really bad for me, I couldn't keep up with workloads, assignments, etc... what I'm gonna say now is one of my main problems and this is completely my fault. So there were certain classes I struggled a lot with, namely, differential calculus and electrical principles and digital systems. At this point, I had already quit alcohol for about two years, but kept smoking weed, and my resolution for this year was to quit cold turkey and basically go completely clean. I had achieved this so far, but I had replaced it with coffee, and this made things hard, as I couldn't sleep well at night, even if I slept I would wake up tired, I couldn't focus, very anxious all the time, you name it. So these two classmates, which by then already considered me their friend were always there to help me. They offered to help me with assignments and all, and I'm gonna be bluntly honest, I've never said or written this before but I have massive amounts of proud, I was not used to people getting things done that I couldn't, so I didn't feel comfortable accepting their help, to this day I feel the same. There were projects, specifically in electrical principles, where we had to work together on a breadboard in class, this meant the professor would be there observing everyone working and helping with questions and whatnot. So at first I barely kept up, but everything when south gradually. At some point, they were doing all the work, and they didn't really tell me anything about it. To clarify something, by this point, I had also helped them a lot with other projects and sometimes they couldn't understand something and I helped them, our relationship was to help each other no matter what, it was a very friendly environment and we were basically looking out for each other. I didn't voice things out, so this happened without us talking about it, but it was really uncomfortable to be in class with them working and me just doing nothing or on the phone. About me being on the phone on class, I'm gonna be completely honest, at first I tried to help them, but they were so good at what they were doing, I just couldn't keep up and would be all quiet, I have a massive problem with learning, my thoughts are usually scattered as a result of my anxiety and I would just completely shut down, it was something that really made me feel bad, uncomfortable and uneasy. The professor noticed I didn't help as much, but to make everything short, we passed the class, but I didn't deserve the grade we got (we got a good grade). This has since been burned in my memory, but from there on, there has been a lot of situations where I am definitely not helping them. Here's a second point I wanna make and this is also very imperative to point out: I have noticed I have narcissistic tendencies, I have made very little research about it and a few tests, it turns out I'm not entirely a narcissist. So the interaction with these classmates for the past year has been like this: I sit near them but try to stay a little bit away, sometimes I hear them talking about something and I feel left out, even though I obviously wanna be left out. They're really smart and I've always been really proud of them, to some extent, our relationship has been like siblings, I somewhat consider them like my little siblings, as they're really patient with me, and no one has been as understanding as them. Here's the problem and this breaks my heart, as I have to accept that this is something I feel and it's interfering with my life: I don't feel comfortable with them, I don't like when they send a message on the group, I don't like answering it. I don't like being around them and hearing them talking about the assignments, or talking about how to solve a problem, or anything for that matter. It's devastating to look into my heart and realize that I am jealous of them, that I wanna be better than them. I really don't like this about myself, and I've been clean long enough to clearly accept that this is an inherent part of myself, that this will not change, this is who I really am. This is not fair to them, they are really putting a lot of effort into helping me and I don't deserve it. I know my limits, I know this is not gonna change. I feel really uncomfortable to keep working with them and have been feeling like this for a long time. I know I won't find people like them, they're special, really good people, it's a shame. So next semester I wanna go into a different group, it'll probably be only A and B, but I really don't wanna tell them that I feel like this. My plan is to pretend I couldn't get into their group on time (usually, students with higher grades get to choose earlier in the morning, the lower the grade, the later you get to choose, so by evening the best group will already be full). And choose the other group. This is something I've just considered never really wrote it or voiced it out, I'm not so sure as to what to do.

**TL;DR:**

I'm a 6th-semester university student studying Computational Systems Engineering and struggling with severe social anxiety, past addiction issues, and feelings of inadequacy. Despite being clean and making an effort to rebuild my life, I find it hard to form or maintain meaningful relationships. Two classmates have been incredibly supportive, but my insecurities, jealousy, and discomfort around them have strained our bond. I don't feel deserving of their help and have decided to switch to a different group next semester to avoid them, even though they mean a lot to me. Not sure if this is the right decision, but I feel stuck.",1,1737267433.0,socialanxiety,0,1.0,False

I am a native Russian speaker. I have been learning English for some time now and am just starting to learn Vietnamese because I am going to this beautiful country. I would like to be closer to the people and make friends there.

Let me tell you a little about myself. I like to read and listen to books, walk, play video games, watch cartoons and horror films. I am a bit boring and not always verbose, but I can always listen to a person and try to help them as much as I can. I also love hot coffee (even in a hot climate) and swinging (even in a cold climate).

I will be grateful if you help me with English and I will be especially happy if I find someone who will help me with Vietnamese. In return, I will try to help you with Russian and maybe even become your friend.

Even if you have not started learning Russian yet, it is okay, we will start from the very beginning. Patiently, step by step.

Well, if you do not need my language, but you want to communicate and maybe become friends, well, just write to me. Two people, if they want, can always find common ground.",1,1737267356.0,language_exchange,0,1.0,False
1i4s3nl,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoItaly/comments/1i4s3nl/learning_basic_italian_phrases_for_your_trip/,Learning basic Italian phrases for your trip.,"## Learning Basic Italian Phrases for Your Trip: Ciao!

So you're jetting off to Italy? *Bellissimo!*  Before you go, learning a few basic Italian phrases can dramatically enhance your trip. It's not about becoming fluent overnight (though that would be amazing!), it's about showing respect and making connections with the locals.  Plus, it opens doors to more authentic experiences.

Forget complicated grammar rules for now. We're focusing on practical phrases you can use immediately.  Think of it like packing ‚Äì you don't need your entire wardrobe, just the essentials.

**Essential Greetings & Politeness:**

* **Ciao (Chow):**  A versatile greeting, used for hello and goodbye.  Works for any time of day.
* **Buongiorno (Bwohn-jor-noh):** Good morning/good day. Use this until about 6 pm.
* **Buonasera (Bwoh-nah-seh-rah):** Good evening/good night.  Use this from around 6 pm onwards.
* **Grazie (Grah-tzee-eh):** Thank you.  This is your most frequently used phrase!
* **Prego (Preh-goh):** You're welcome / please.
* **Scusi (Skoos-ee):** Excuse me (to get someone's attention).
* **Mi scusi (Mee skoo-see):**  Excuse me (more formal, for apologies).
* **Per favore (Per fah-voh-reh):** Please.


**Ordering Food & Drink:**

* **Un caff√®, per favore (oon kahf-fay, per fah-voh-reh):** A coffee, please.  (Espresso is the default.)
* **Un bicchiere di vino, per favore (oon bee-kee-eh-reh dee vee-noh, per fah-voh-reh):** A glass of wine, please.

**Navigating & Asking for Help:**

* **Dov'√®...? (Dohv-eh...?):** Where is...? (Follow with the place, e.g., Dov'√® il bagno? - Where is the bathroom?)
* **Parla inglese? (Par-lah een-gleh-zeh?):** Do you speak English?
* **Non capisco (nohn kah-pees-koh):** I don't understand.
* **Aiuto! (ah-yoo-toh!):** Help!


**Pro Tip: Pronunciation Matters (a little)**

Italian pronunciation is relatively straightforward.  Listen to audio pronunciations online (many apps and websites offer this) to get the rhythm and intonation right. Even a rough attempt shows effort and is appreciated.

**Beyond the Basics:**

Don't be afraid to try! Even a few words will show your willingness to engage with Italian culture. You‚Äôll find that Italians often appreciate the effort, even if your pronunciation isn't perfect.  And remember, a smile goes a long way!  Enjoy your trip! *Buon viaggio!* (Have a good trip!)
