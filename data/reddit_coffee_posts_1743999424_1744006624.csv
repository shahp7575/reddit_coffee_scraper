1jtekta,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/1jtekta/i_like_flat_heineken/,I like flat Heineken.,"Have you ever opened a bottle of Heineken just to have it foam out of your mouth as you take a worthy swig? I gotta say, when I buy Heineken, I just open all of them up and leave them on the counter. That way it gets easier towards the end. Honestly the Luke warmness doesn't bother me much either. Have you ever tried one of those opened overnight left out Heineken the next morning with an Americano, it's actually superb! Flat Heineken and Coffee actually go great together.

1jtekd9,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyResearch/comments/1jtekd9/husbands_friend_fucked_me_as_he_was_passed_out/,Husband's friend fucked me as he was passed out! (wife's POV),"Nick and my husband had a drinking contest and both got smashed. My husband got so drunk that he passed out on the bed. The party winded down and everyone began to leave so Nick said he would stay to help me clean up the mess.



I was wearing tight fitting jeans and wanted to get out of them so I went to the bedroom and put on my sleeping outfit the tank top and tiny baggy shorts. As we picked up all the empty beer cans and food mess, Nick kept looking down my shirt at my bare breast. I know he was trying to sneak a peak and I loved every minute of it.



As I was dishes, he would bring me dirty dishes and slide behind me and brush his hard cock against my ass. He was driving me wild and my pussy was getting super wet. I went to get a bowl of the coffee table bending over right in front of him putting my ass right in his face. My shorts were riding up and I am sure he a clear view of my aching pussy.



**He followed my back to the kitchen and as I washed the bowl he pinned me against the counter began pressing his hard cock against my ass and kissing my neck. Whispering in my ear, I have to have you now and slid his hands around me cupping my young breast.**



I knew that my husband was in the other room and knew it was wrong but I couldn't stop myself. We began kissing; stripping each others clothes off, and I dropped to my knees taking his hard cock in my mouth.



His cock was so thick and big like a baby's bottle that it was hard to get it in my mouth. Pre-cum was leaking from the head of his cock and it tasted so good. He grabbed me by the hand and led me to the couch and started to eat my pussy. His expert tongue swirled around my clit driving me wild. My pussy has never been eaten so well and he made sure I came twice before he stopped.



He laid me on the couch and rubbed the head of his cock against my swollen clit and dripping wet pussy. I begged him to stick his dick in me and he slowly drove his thick cock deep into me and held it there until I adjusted to his size. He loved my tight pussy and pulled his cock almost out before driving it back in while sucking on my hard nipples.



We reposition so that I was lying over the arm of the couch and he was behind me. Grabbing my hips, he aimed his big tool back at my pussy and drove it completely in making me gasp. I never have been fucked as hard before as he pounded away on my tight cunt with my pussy making sloshing noise as he used me.



He pulled me tightly back onto his cock as I felt his cock began to throb in me. I tried to pull his cock out but it was too late as he grunted and shot his seed deep into me. It seemed like he came forever shooting 3 or 4 times overflowing my sore pussy. His cock slowly slipped out of my well fucked cunt leaving a sloppy mess that ran down my legs and onto the couch arm. Spanking my ass and giving me a kiss on the cheek, he told me to go to bed and the next time we fuck it will be even better.",1,1744006434.0,MyResearch,0,1.0,False

1jtejhn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jtejhn/aitah_for_putting_nair_in_my_shampoo_knowing_that/,AITAH for putting nair in my shampoo knowing that my roommate would use it?,"We are both 19F and live with one other girl who is 20F.

This roommate, we’ll call her C, has been consistently using things that I buy, as well as my other roommates things (we’ll call her F). We all moved in together in September as we go to the same college, and none of us knew each other prior.

It started when I noticed that my tide pods were disappearing at a much faster rate than ever before. I gaslit myself for a while but at one point I knew there was one left and that got taken which was confirmation that I’m not crazy. I don’t mind sharing and they’re probably less than a dollar each and I didn’t think it was worth the confrontation so I just started keeping them in my room and moved on.

Next thing I noticed was that my tampons had been opened (I leave them in my bathroom drawer). But by the end of the week at least 6-7 of them were gone (I hadn’t started my period that week so i hadn’t used any at all). F was visiting her family that week so she wasn’t home so I knew it was C using them. Again I started keeping them in my room.

Then one day we were all in the kitchen and F asked us if we had been using her coffee creamer (I don’t drink coffee) and C said no. I ended up telling F about the tide pods and the tampons because it seemed to be a pattern at this point. F told me that she noticed the same thing with her laundry detergent getting empty quickly and her spices being used. She said she also hadn’t addressed it because she didn’t want to make it a big deal and she didn’t know who was doing it.

At this point I felt I had enough evidence to ask C about the tampons/laundry detergent. I didn’t come at her in an aggressive or accusatory way (although I knew it was her), I just brought it up as a “oh by the way, have you been using my laundry detergent or tampons by chance?” And she denied it, she was even acting a little mad and said she’s offended I would even ask that. Regardless I was hopeful that me questioning her would make her stop since it would make her aware that I know what she’s doing. I said “okay well if you ever need to borrow something I don’t mind but please ask first, I’ve noticed a few things of mine going missing consistently and I just don’t want anyone to use what I buy without asking because it’s not fair to me financially.” Unfortunately I was wrong and it kept happening, I feel like I have to hide everything I own so she doesn’t use it.

What really pissed me off is that she was using my expensive hair oil. I don’t have a lot of extra money so I don’t splurge on myself often, but haircare is something I prioritize. I had 2-3 weeks left of my hair oil but bought a new one while I was already at Sephora and I had a feeling she’d use it (I’m a psycho and took a pic of the oil beside a ruler to see if the line would go down, and it did). F uses the same oil and I know it wasn’t her. So I asked C about it and she denied it again.

I’m not sure if this part is okay to be annoyed about but C comes from a wealthy family which she is open about, and F and I have both visited her house. I bring this up because she doesn’t have to pay for her rent or groceries, meanwhile F and I are working as much as we can while in school to make ends meet. None of our parents pay our rent or anything like that so I’m upset because I work hard for what I buy meanwhile C feels entitled to use whatever she wants of ours, while she doesn’t have to worry about money like us. C also doesn’t have a job because her parents want her to focus on her studies.

Anyway it’s been 8 months of this and I was almost finished with my shampoo (which I had been questioning if she’s been using it or not) and (possibly?) against my better judgement I put nair in it. I told F what I did because if by chance she just needed a squirt for a day I didn’t want her to be the one to find out (again I don’t mind if someone’s in a pinch or uses something once or twice, what bothers me is that I’ve already addressed what’s been happening and it continues). So two days later C is freaking out in the bathroom saying her hair is falling out and she knows I put nair in my shampoo and she’s gonna take me to court (lol). She’s by no means bald but I saw how much of her hair came out and I’d have to say like 30-40%. Anyway she said I’m the scum of the earth amongst other things and that I’ll be paying for her hair extensions etc. I am starting to feel really guilty. I did it in the heat of the moment because 8 months of my shit going missing was weighing on me especially while I’m in a not-fantastic financial place.

AITAH?

TLDR: roommate used many of my belongings for months and lied about it, I put nair in my shampoo bc I had a feeling she was using that too and her hair fell out. Now she wants to sue me.

In hopes of keeping up the good spirit and reaching my goal I am going to do a weekly report, showing my progress (or stagnation) with OMAD.

My main goal with OMAD is loosing some weight, an to remove the temptation of candy, junk food and sodas throughout the day, due to the simplicity of only eating once per day. Getting rid of my sugar addiction will surely be a wonderful thing!  
Other than that I stick to only water and black coffee both while fasting and during my meal.  
I am choosing not to calorie count, but most days I will just eat a large, homecooked meal with my wife and kids. As I am the one who does most of the cooking at home, I have made sure to increase the size of our dinner Meal a little, to make up for the fact that I now eat a bit more at dinnertime than I used to. Probably about once a week, we order takeout, and I assume that will not be a problem either.

**Overall Stats:**  
**Gender:** Male  
**Starting weight:** 110,0 kg  
**Current weight as of this morning:** 100,2 kg  
**Height:** 193 cm  
**Goal:** 90 kg  
**Weeks on OMAD:**  6

**Week 6:**

**Saturday:** ?? kg  
**Sunday:** 101,8 kg  
**Monday:** 100,2 kg

A great week, where I even broke fast, to have an ice cream in the warm weather with my children on sunday.  
For the first time in 6 weeks I simply forgot to weigh my self this Saturday, but i really see that as a good sign! - I pay less attention to the individual weigh ins, and more attention to what i see in the mirror, and how I feel.  
I have cleaned up my weight tracking app, so that it now only shows my morning weights, this should give a bit less of a messy overview.

Stay safe out there and hail the one meal god!

So many dying dreams that lay waste in only our minds.

So many of these dreams have already been fulfilled but I took it ALL for granted.  I look back and just think “fuck me if only I” such and such and so and so.  

I haven’t accepted that it’s over yet.  I still have this strong feeling that she is my one.  

But it’s over.  I need to move on with or without her in my life.  

It sucks because it’s one of those things where we may look back and think “maybe if we were older, more mature, gained the wisdom before meeting”

1jtefh0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/1jtefh0/looking_for_mentorship/,Looking for mentorship,"Greetings!

I’m currently a sophomore at the college having a difficult time finding “adult” mentorship. 

My academic advisor is seldom available for meetings, and when we do talk, it seems like he’s very busy and not at all interested in doing much else besides lift my holds (he has a large amount of students he advises, so I can’t blame him entirely, but my roommate even commented that he seemed a bit harsh in responding to some of my questions). 

My resident tutor is great, but her interest areas are not even remotely close to my own unfortunately. I’ve been friendly with some professors but many of my classes have been large lectures, and I’m having a really hard time establishing closer relationships with them. 

I’ve also tried to pursue professional mentorship through internships and summer research, but haven’t found much luck—especially with Trump cutting many of the government roles. 

I have lots of great friends on campus, but I feel very alone in terms of professional guidance. I’m  not first-generation by any means, but I come from a very small town, was the first from my high school to go to Harvard, and my parents went to smaller public schools and are often busy.

I feel like I’m just figuring out things that many of my peers knew coming in, like how to cold email or leverage connections. I just wish I had an older, well-connected mentor-type figure that could support me and impart some life wisdom. Both of my grandfathers have passed on—I hope I’m not making it too obvious that I miss them dearly. 

Besides my above “rant”, I have a few questions that I hope this sub have some knowledge on:

1. How do I get into contact with Harvard alumni looking to be mentors to the next generation of students? I’ve tried LinkedIn and cold emailing (not directly asking for mentorship per se, mostly just for brief chats) but have received very few responses. 
2. Where else should I be looking for professional guidance? Do these kinds of relationships actually exist, or are they either over exaggerated by popular media or products of a bygone era? 

If anyone here would be willing to take on a mentee or knows someone who may be, please feel free to DM me! I’d love to grab coffee (either literally or figuratively) sometime. For reference, my academic focus area is international political economy, with specific interests in economic development, central banking, trade, and economic security. I’m looking to either pursue a masters or go to law school and would love to meet someone who has advice on these paths.

Many people complain that Egypt, as a nation, will never change, but I believe much of this stems from a lack of awareness rather than inevitability.
This initiative is strictly non-political and non-religious. I’m not trying to recruit anyone or push an agenda. I just want to understand where people stand. My goal is to identify the best starting point for discussions that foster awareness and curiosity.
Over time, these discussions could evolve into local gatherings in coffee shops and parks, open to anyone willing to listen and think. Local gatherings will be absolutely crucial for raising people's awareness, specifically the ones who are not tech savvy and don't use social media.
If necessary, I’m even open to involving a government representative to observe or participate in the conversation to avoid any raising of eyebrows or suspicions. I don’t intend to take that step unless absolutely needed, but I want to explore how this could work in a way that’s open, transparent, and welcoming to all.
To do this, I’d like to post a simple yes/no poll: ""Do you think there’s hope for our people?""
The responses will help me identify the starting point. Feel free to share your thoughts in the comments too. I’d really like to know what made you vote yes more than no, because the reasons behind a no are, in many ways, already known or expected.
That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t explain why you said no. On the contrary, every opinion matters, and every answer has its weight.
I truly believe this conversation is valuable. It's a chance to find the zero-point where change begins, where good things take root and grow.

حابب أبدأ سلسلة من النقاشات هدفها تشجيع الناس، خصوصًا اللي جايين من خلفيات بسيطة أو متوسطة وعايشين في المدن، إنهم يفكروا بشكل أعمق في واقعهم بدل ما يكون كل التركيز على البقاء اليومي بس.
ناس كتير بتقول إن مصر عمرها ما هتتغير، بس أنا شايف إن السبب الأساسي ورا الإحباط ده مش إنه واقع لا يمكن تغييره، لكن غالبًا سببه نقص في الوعي والإدراك.
المبادرة دي مش سياسية ولا دينية بأي شكل. معنديش أجندة معينة ولا بتكلم عشان أضم ناس لفكرة أو اتجاه. كل اللي عايزه هو أفهم الناس واقفين فين. الهدف إني أحدد نقطة البداية المناسبة لنقاشات تفتح باب الوعي والفضول.
مع الوقت، النقاشات دي ممكن تتحول لتجمعات صغيرة في كافيهات أو في جنينة عامة، مفتوحة لأي حد حابب يسمع أو يفكر. النوع ده من التجمعات مهم جدًا، خصوصًا للناس اللي مش بيستخدموا السوشيال ميديا أو مش متمكنين في التكنولوجيا.
ولو لزم الأمر، ماعنديش مانع إن مسؤول حكومي يحضر أو يراقب أي تجمع علشان الأمور تبقى واضحة وما تثيرش شكوك. مش ناوي أطلب ده إلا لو فعلاً احتجناه، بس يهمني أعرف إزاي ممكن نعمل الموضوع ده بشكل شفاف، محترم، ومفتوح للجميع.
عشان نبدأ، حابب أنزل تصويت بسيط بنعم أو لا: ""هل شايف إن لسه في أمل في شعبنا؟""
الردود هتساعدني أعرف أبدأ منين. تقدر تقول رأيك تحت كمان. حابب اعرف ايه الأسباب اللي خلتك تقول اه أكتر من لا, عشان ال ""لا"" اسبابه بشكل ما او باّخر معروف. ده مش معناه متقولش لا ليه.
أنا مؤمن إن الكلام في المواضيع دي له قيمة حقيقية. دي فرصة نلاقي بيها ""نقطة الصفر"" اللي منها ممكن يبدأ التغيير، وتطلع منها حاجة كويسة تكبر.
شكرًا جدًا لوقتك واهتمامك.

I’m in second year and I want to get an internship in accounting for 3rd year summer given that it’s spring recruit right now and I’m so damn stressed. Everyone keeps telling me I need genuine connections to get anything, it doesn’t depend on my application or resume. I’ve been going on coffee chats and events but no connection yet. I love accounting but I cannot go through recruit it’s stressing me out like crazy especially during finals now. Recruit is making me think if I should take accounting or not. There’s nothing else I’d want to take honestly. 

Also, someone told me that you can only apply once a year (spring or fall) and only one position. Is it true? I can’t find a straight answer online.

Heartbreak

Veronica’s POV

He is laughing with her again.

I stood outside Carter’s office, gripping the tray of coffee and muffins so tightly that my fingers ached.

Through the glass wall, I could see him sitting across from Meghan, his first love.

His laughter echoing faintly in the air, deep and warm, the kind of laugh I hadn’t heard from him in… I couldn’t even remember how long.

Did he ever laugh like that with me? I wasn’t sure.

I clenched my jaw, fighting the sting of tears.

It was our third wedding anniversary today, not that Carter remembered.

Not that he ever cared.

I was his secretary in name, his wife in title only.

But I wished he would only just forget it and not spend it giggling with another woman.

Or maybe I was the other woman because they looked like the perfect couple.

“Do you remember that one time we went bowling? When you couldn’t even hit a single pin for the life of you?” Meghan’s pitchy voice rang out.

“Okay, now you’re exaggerating. That is not how I remember it!” Carter defended with a light chuckle, tears pricked my eyes.

Since Meghan returned to the country two months ago, everything has changed. Carter, who was always distant but at least polite, now treated me like I didn’t exist. Meghan was always around, using the pretence of “cooperation” to cling to him, and Carter let her.

I could only keep hurting in silence cause what could I say? Our marriage had been a mistake from the start, forcedly by circumstance rather than love. Yet I was so happy to marry my crush even though he was just doing his grandfather’s bidding.

Still, I had hoped. Hoped that three years might soften his heart, that maybe he’ll notice how much I loved him. But watching him now, so carefree with Meghan, my hope seemed more foolish than ever.

I watched as Meghan tilted her head, flashing him that perfect, coy smile. He leaned closer, his face soft with amusement. My chest tightened painfully. I told myself to walk away, to stop torturing myself.

But when I heard Meghans voice again, loud and flirtatious, “Oh, K!You haven’t changed one bit and I like it”

It was followed by another groan of laughter from Carter, I couldn’t take it anymore.

Before I knew it, I was opening the door. Their gazes immediately snapped at me, and I felt like an intruder.

“Carter”, I called out, trying to sound calm even though my voice trembled a bit, “I need to talk to you. It’s urgent”.

The laughter stopped. Carter turned to me, his expression hardening instantly. “Veronica!”, he said sharply, “I’m busy. Can’t it wait?”.

My heart clenched tightly. Wow! He was really busy indeed.

Meghan, seated gracefully in her chair, smirked. “Oh, Carter, let her speak. I’m sure it’s important”, she said, her tone dripping with mock sweetness.

I ignored her, though it took every ounce of self control in me. “I won’t take much of your time”, I said, my voice quieter now.

Carter sighed, leaning back in his chair. “Fine. What is it?”, his voice was dripping with annoyance.

Meghan stood, brushing imaginary lint from her dress. “I’ll step out and give you two some privacy” she said lightly.",1,1744004648.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False
1jte4uc,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1jte4uc/praise_to_the_what/,"""Praise to the WHAT""!?!?","I'm NeverMo. Grew up with one generic Christian parent who wasn't into going to church, but thought we should say bedtime prayers. The other was raised Catholic but was the only one of all the 7 siblings in the family not to marry a devout Catholic and raise the whole house full of devout Catholic children. When I visited them overnight, for a weekend, or several weeks during the summer, I was dragged to mass, and expected to sit up straight, listen, and participate.

Therefore, I know more than the average non-Catholic about Catholicism. 

Also, as an adult, i've lived in heavily Mormon communities far across the country from Utah twice, for extended periods. So know more about the LDS Church than the average non-Mormon. 

I was STUNNED a couple of years ago when one of my favorite cousins was bamboozled by the missionaries to convert into Mormonism. This guy was SERIOUSLY Catholic. Spent all of high school, all of college, and a couple of years after firmly convinced he was meant to be a priest. Then, he decided he would rather marry another devoutly Catholic, chaste young woman , and have lots of Catholic babies.

He and I are as close as can be, so I was stunned that he didn't tell me he was converting. Again, I have no skin in the Catholic game. I was equally shocked that he didn't tell any of his friends or family until the night before he was baptized, when he texted or emailed them the link to watch his baptism online.

This is one of those guys who used to go to his Catholic ""spiritual advisor""/parish priest before making big decisions, or when conflicted about something. He also didn't tell anyone in his large Catholic Church he was converting. Apparently, he just mysteriously disappeared. He and I live in different states, and his parents and most of his sibling live in a different state from either one of us.

You don't have to be Sigmund Freud or Dr. Phil to realize he didn't want to give anyone a chance to talk him out of it. 

We usually talk every Sunday, and sometimes in the middle of the week. Today's chat had to wait until after GC. Here I go using Mormon lingo, pretty impressive for someone who has never been LDS, drinks coffee and alcohol, and swears like a sailor, but for some reason I was ""prompted""to look up the lyrics to ""Praise to the Man"".

When I spoke with my cousin, ' Bob', I asked him how many gods Mormons believe in. He arrogantly, self righteously, and with a very uppity attitude, confidently respond  ""ONE!""

I asked him why Mormons sing songs in church referencing there being more than one God, ""We do NOT!""

I told him I had found the lyrics to PTTM online. He accused me of surfing the Internet just looking for falsehoods from random sources to put down his church. I told him I had found the lyrics on the OFFICIAL LDS website. After we hung up, I screenshot it  and texted it to him. i'm sure he deleted without reading.

Those of you who sang that song repeatedly for however long you were a TBM and/or PIMO, PLEASE correct me where I am misinformed or I'm misconstruing things. It's my understanding that the song ""praise the man"" is referring to the man Joseph Smith. In it there is a phrase that refers to JS, as ""mingling with gods""

""Gods"" is a plural word. Isn't it? I was an English major I know damned good well it is.

Reading into the lyrics further, I had a sudden flashback to my childhood Sundays in mass with my aunts, uncles, and cousins. You could tell they were a proper Catholic family because they took up an entire pew! They squeezed in to make room for me, the heathen cousin.

Somewhere in ""PTTM,"" the lyrics say that he(JS, if I'm reading correctly) ""ascended to heaven""

Hold on a minute there! 

I don't know the name of the creed Catholics say during mass, all together and out loud, but somewhere in there it says something about Jesus who ""ascended into heaven"". 

Are Jesus and JS EQUALLY holy enough/mystical/whatever to BOTH have actually ascended into heaven? 

WHAT in the actual HELL?! !?!?

I thought traditional Christian belief included a belief that Jesus, having given his life to cover the sins of all of us heathens forevermore, or rather by that act, ascended into Heaven. Wasn't that the special privilege Jesus received for dying for ""all of our sins""?

I don't really care if you worship God, Allah, the Great Pumpkin, or Satan, or just yourself, because it's none of my business. HOWEVER, if you're going Going to be___, and then teach something that is directly contrary to one of the holy books you profess to hold dearly and believe in, how can you compare anybody to Jesus in that ""ascended into heaven"" manner??

SURELY I am totally missing something here.

Thank you, dear Exmos(none of my business, but I still think you should call yourselves NoMo's)

Thank you for any enlightenment you can give me on the subject. I swear, my cousin's body and brain has been invaded by aliens!

They got him when he was at a particularly low point in his life, and he's just naturally always been socially awkward. College educated. Employed. Could have more friends if he would put himself out there. My aunt, his mother, is overwrought, but his uncle/father keeps telling his mom that ""he just joined the Mormons so he would have a social life"".

Now all he talks about is brother so-and-so or brother whatchamacallit, his calling to work with the YM, and, God help us, the most recent single adult event he attended.  Says there were about 25 people there. Four of them were men. He was the youngest by far, at 35. The other men were in their 70s and 80s! He said the rest of the attendees were women in their 60s. Many had to use walkers or canes.

If he joined the LDS Church thinking he would find himself a nice wife, he was dead wrong. He should've looked around to realize that if you are a 22-year-old female Mormon, and aren't married with at least one or two kids, and one on the way, you're already a spinster. His mother and I worry that some wonderful member of his ward will have a daughter, either 18 or 60, who is the victim of some sort of tragic brain injury at some point in her life, or was born with a severe intellectual disability. My cousin loves to chat, laugh, joke around, etc., And is VERY kind. I'm not saying that disabled people, or even elderly people, don't deserve to be married and have a good marital relationship. I'm just afraid that that's the dating pool in which my cousin has limited his fishing.

The song ""PTTM"": Am I reading the words and interpreting the language correctly? All opinions are not only welcome, but also greatly appreciated!

Yes, yes, I know I'm awfully close to my cousin, but since we are very close in age, and he's always been sort of an ""uncle"" to my kids, and is a dear friend to me, my husband, and our kids, we are close. I'm an only child, so my cousins were all I had. He and I just clicked when we were young. He would let me play with his trucks, when my other male cousins wouldn't. He's a good guy!

So, ""PTTM,"" what's it REALLY about? I almost puked when I read all the stuff about how he was murdered/martyred . I get that nobody mentions that he was in jail, or why, or that someone snuck a gun into him in the jail.

I bet if you went to any early morning seminary class in any ward in the world, seminary teachers would discourage sneaking a gun into a buddy of yours who is in jail. Or, perhaps they wouldn't… As long as you're Mormon, So if old Russell M. Nelson, or any other profit, seer or revelator goes to jail, it would be fair game for every one of the apostles and those 70 other old guys, each and every one of them, to sneak a gun into him so he could shoot his way out. Correct?

JESUS! No, I am not using the Lord's name in vain. I am praying that my cousin gets his head out of his ass. It's probably going to take a call 911 to tell them to bring the jaws of life to accomplish that.

1jte37p,https://www.reddit.com/r/neurology/comments/1jte37p/advicepaths_for_non_traditional_medschool/,Advice/Paths for Non Traditional Med-School Applicants,"Hey everybody,

So i am a neuroscience research technician with a BS in Integrative Neuroscience. I am looking for some advice and feedback on:

1.) What are some possible pathways towards getting accepted into a medical program?
2.) What does my current standing look like compared to other applicants?
Experience, especially from people who have been in similar positions, is greatly appreciated!

So to put things into context, I had a very hard time getting through undergrad. I am excellent at learning things very fast and taking exams. But growing up with one parent with cancer and the other working (and also heavy undiagnosed autistic), I have strongly lacked the know-how to take care of my basic needs, plan, and organize. I have also had tumultuous struggles with depression, insomnia, ADHD, Tourette’s syndrome, late emerging food allergies, and anything else the universe can think to throw at me. So, long story short, I had no scholarships, no honors, and my grades were seriously lacking. 

Going into the field after school, I got lucky with a very kind boss, so I have stayed at my current job for 5 years now while I try to figure out what I want to do with my career, and try to develop the skills to properly take care of and organize myself. 

With the current govt cuts and disruptions to the grant review process (at a time when we JUST submitted a grant), there is a high likelihood our funding will lapse and I will lose my job. So I’m trying to use this opportunity to break out of a rut, move forward, and start taking a more active role in my life and future. I think I am finally ready and able to go back to school with more intentionality. 

So in terms of accomplishments, I have a degree in Neuro. I have 5 years work experience + 2 years volunteer lab work in undergrad. In that time, I have my name on about 5 or 6 publications, with another one on the way by the end of the summer. I have created 1 poster for an event. As an exercise, I give regular presentations of academic literature to my coworkers - so I am confident with public speaking, with many coworkers and supervisors telling me I am very good at communicating literature in an easy to consume manner. I have worked 3 of these 5 years as the chemical safety manager for 2 different lab spaces, I have worked 3 years as the maintainer of the animal colony for those same 2 labs, and I have also collaborated with a handful of other labs- primarily because I am proficient and precise in a growing assortment of rodent surgeries. As the sole employee of a retired scientist, I am the only person trained to take on his work- which I have continued for the last year.

Proficient skills/surgeries (all brain) include:
-telemetry implants (EEG, LFP, MEG, single-unit, and optic fibers for optogenetics)
-Virus, tracer, and drug injections
-Craniotomy and head-plate installation for 2-photon Calcium Imaging (2PCI)
-Relevant recording techniques for all the above surgeries. 
-Relevant histological techniques for All the above surgeries. 
-Perfusion.
-Extraction of electrophysiological recordings for analysis.
-Analysis + illustration of data in excel, python (self-taught), and R. (I even re-purposed another python script in order to show moment-to-moment changes in coherence between brain regions in 8 regions simultaneously in awake and freely moving rats).
-General relevant and/or supplementary behavioral testing (odor habituation, fear conditioning, go/no-go, object placement, etc.). 
-At this point, I have done surgeries on hundreds of animals with a very high success rate for a variety of different labs. 
-I have been promoted to the 3rd level of my position for a couple years now. (More would require another degree). 
-For what it’s worth, I also just get along very well with multiple departments- especially the animal facilities, chemical safety, and veterinarian. 

I also have many years of involvement in non-science community activities and hobbies like music ensembles, political/community organizing, doing appearances at the local home for ppl with developmental disabilities as the school mascot, and years of experience working in specialty coffee while I was going to school. 

So how good/bad do I look? How can I compensate for the pitfalls? And how can I lean into the things that look okay. Are there short, transitionary degree programs I should consider? Should I just keep working while I prepare to take MCATs? Or, are there direct resources where I can just go have them answer all these questions? Atm my plan A is to try speaking to a past PI because they work at a school I want to go to- to see if there are jobs like mine in labs there.

We both come from families who do not know how to communicate or treat each other properly.  We basically started acting like our parents. Fast forward, we decided to turn it all around and we are doing way better and communicating really well. 

My partner is week on, week off with work which I am fine with. It's nice to have alone time even though I miss him. Anyway, there was one night at a work party, where he got embarrassingly drunk and sent a picture of him and another guy to his female co-worker. It was a pretty innocent picture but it was when we were struggling in our relationship.

 Fast forward to now, I asked him about her and if he found her attractive (I KNOW, I shouldn't have) and he replied saying that yes and that basically before we sorted our relationship that he did picture sleeping with her but that had changed and he doesn't view her in that way anymore. I know it's normal to find other people attractive, I'm not blind but for him to say what he said... it's not just attraction, it is sexual attraction. I know people can change the way they look at someone but my issue is that they play chess and have coffee together at his work place and I feel so uncomfortable about it. 

Them hanging out at work one on one. He said that he is just a social guy but has many co workers.... He said that if it was an issues, he would just slowly stop hanging out with her so it didn't look so weird. But I almost feel guilty that because I am not completely trusting him, he has to cut a relationship. 

But it really does make me very uncomfortable. Please give me some advice...",1,1744004417.0,relationships,1,1.0,False

I'm currently on the lookout for a life partner. I'm 29 years old, based in Canada, with an engineering degree and working in technical sales. Life's going well overall.

I've tried several matrimonial apps, but unfortunately, most responses end in rejection due to caste differences. It's surprising that even in the 21st century, caste still plays such a major role.

Honestly, I'm not sure how to go about this anymore—maybe I'll start frequenting coffee shops in hopes of bumping into ""the one.""

**Total CI Time: 150 hours**

**Speaking practice: 40 hours (7 year ago)**

**Level: 3**

Progress & Wins This Month

This month I officially hit Level 3 in Dreaming Spanish and passed 150 hours of comprehensible input. It’s honestly wild how much more I can understand now, especially when I look back to where I started. I'm not fluent (not even close), but my brain is starting to *expect* Spanish now. It's clicking.

One of the biggest wins? I stumbled onto [this advanced Shel video](https://www.dreamingspanish.com/watch?id=67d1c916891bcf6812fa8615), and to my surprise, I understood a *good chunk* of it. That moment hit hard, it felt like real, tangible progress.

**Content I’m Watching**

This month I decided to start watching from the beginning chronologically—mainly just to make sure I didn’t miss any of the foundational stuff.

But let’s be honest… those early videos can be hard to sit through when your brain is foggy from work, parenting, and packing up your life to travel the world.  So I’ve been mixing in newer, more engaging videos to keep the energy up, especially 5am in the morning before I have had coffee when I need something to *wake my brain up.*

This balance of old + new has been key to staying consistent without burning out.

**Outside Resources I’m Loving**

I’ve also been listening to the Spanish Booster Podcast. Started with the Minecraft series (which is surprisingly relaxing) and just discovered that he’s got a bunch of other videos on personal development and mindset topics.

That’s totally my thing, so I’ll be weaving more of that in this month.

**Content Wishlist**

If the Dreaming Spanish team is taking notes, I'd love to see more content around:

* Mindfulness + meditation
* Reading habits + personal growth
* Learning how to learn
* Spirituality (non-religious)

The educational stuff is awesome, but it’d be amazing to have deeper, reflective content as I'm slowing getting to the stage where I can no longer watch the clothes hauls, weddings, jewellery videos and Andrea singing.

**What’s Working**

I’ve found my rhythm this month:

* Morning DS with coffee (low pressure, high repetition content)
* CI videos during chores or solo drives
* Spanish Booster audio while walking or stretching
* CI as a background companion during non-high-intensity workouts

One huge mindset shift: I got stuck in traffic for an hour recently and my first thought was, *“Nice—I get more CI time.”* That alone tells me it’s becoming part of my life.

**Goal Update**

My goal in the app is still set to 60 minutes/day, mostly because I love hitting that celebration animation. But realistically, I’m averaging 2–3 hours a day now between DS and passive listening. I’m not forcing it, it’s just part of the routine now and

**Why I’m Learning**

In 4 months, we leave the UK to travel long-term through South and Central America as a family of four. Between working, raising kids, running a travel blog, and planning everything, I'm  juggling a lot.

But this part? Learning the language? It matters. I want to be able to connect, to show up respectfully, and to experience more than just the tourist version of these countries.

I’ll be adding speaking lessons about a month before we go to round it all out. Though before all the DS and when I was in my 20's so around 7 years ago I had accumulated around 40-50 hours of speaking practice.

**What’s Next**

Stay consistent. Explore more intermediate content.

Still early in the journey but this month was a turning point.

¡Vamos!

1jtdzj2,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1jtdzj2/rf_type_four/,[RF] Type Four,"Written by someone who believed he was unique

Nobody could quite explain what the company did. There were departments and sub-departments, acronyms piled like bricks, and enough meetings to simulate momentum. The elevator paused on every floor as if to remind people they could leave, though no one ever did.

Mary Ellenson—known affectionately, and only somewhat ironically, as Miss June—was 45 years old, with a kind of composed beauty that made people apologize before speaking to her. Blondish-brown hair coiled like a scroll across her shoulders, and her figure was long and quietly elegant, like an exclamation point held at polite attention. Her desk smelled faintly of rose petals. Her computer background was a rotating slideshow of her children, waterfalls, and scripture.

Carter Blome, 51, inhabited the chair across the aisle. Bald, bloated, with a red, always-damp face and fingers that lingered too long on the “send” button. He worked just hard enough to avoid a performance plan. He spoke to Mary as if she were a romantic subplot in his personal tragedy. She ignored it, kindly.

But Carter considered himself profound. His sadness was his art. When he sighed—and he sighed often—it was a performance for an invisible audience. He was the misunderstood center of a mediocre universe. A martyr of sensitivity, crushed under fluorescent lights.

Then came the Tuesday.

Miss June approached him just before lunch, cradling a brochure like a communion wafer. “Have you ever taken the Enneagram?” she asked, voice soft as pressed linen.

Carter shrugged. “Is that like astrology for people who read The Atlantic?”

She smiled. “I think it could help you understand yourself.”

He took the pamphlet. A circle of numbers blinked back at him—Nine types, Nine paths, arrows coiling in and out like a trap disguised as a clock.

She pointed at the number Four, already circled in purple ink.

“You might be this one,” she said.

Carter completed the test online that night, hunched over his flickering monitor. As he answered, the cursor seemed to guide itself. The screen pulsed faintly.

He was, undeniably, a Four.

“The Individualist. Romantic, introspective, driven by a need to feel unique. Prone to melancholy. Fears being ordinary.”

He read it once. Then twice. His mouth went dry. He clicked deeper into the site, into forums, footnotes, user comments, psychology essays. All of it—all of it—matched him. Word for word. He wasn’t unique.

He was described.

And something inside him loosened.

The next day, Carter arrived late and glassy-eyed. He shuffled through the halls like a malfunctioning wind-up toy. His sentences unraveled halfway through.

He spoke only in Enneagram terms.

“You’re a Three,” he whispered to the copier. “You think success makes you real.”

By Thursday, he’d taken to sitting under his desk, reciting the description of Type Four like psalm. “I am the Tragic Beauty,” he mumbled. “I fear being ordinary. I am… I am not real.”

Friday morning, Miss June found him in the supply closet, whispering into a pack of sticky notes.

“I used to be me,” he said, tears beading on his cheeks like dew. “But now I’m just… inventory.”

They sent him home. Or said they did.

No one actually saw him leave the building.

Weeks passed. Carter’s desk was quietly absorbed into Facilities. His name was wiped from the directory. His poems vanished from the shared drive.

One night, the building security camera caught a frame of something hunched in the breakroom. A blurred shape, like a man, sitting perfectly still and whispering to a coffee pod.

Miss June continued her work. Flawless. Efficient. She handed out Enneagram brochures like breath mints, always gently, always at the right moment.

She never circled the numbers now.

They circled themselves.

Some say the Enneagram test was a file from corporate. Some say it appeared on the shared drive without a creation date. Some say it existed before the building did.

But in the dark corners of the office, behind the hum of dead computers and disused fax machines, there are whispers.

Nine Types.

Nine Doors.

You open the one you’re told to open.

And behind each door?

Someone like you.

Exactly like you.

Forever.

However My bf (M33) and I (F32) feel like we're at a place in our lives that where it makes sense to get a dog now, and I'm stoked! It wasn't rushed or anything. We saw our first dog about a year ago. 

Anywhooo, we found our pup! We met her last week, and she's a wonderful year-old mutt from Mexico. Later that same day, we met my bfs parents for coffee. I was waiting for him to bring it up, but he didn't. I asked him why, and he said that he just felt nervous and worried about their reaction. 

Fast forward a few days and all the paperwork has gone through, and we pick her up tomorrow. We're supposed to go there for dinner on Friday (bf goes over for dinner a couple of times a week; I usually only go every couple of months), so obviously, we had to tell them we were getting a dog. We video-called and excitedly shared the news and sent photos. At first she was so silent and just kept repeating ""oh no, you didn't.. nnoooo"", really quietly. Then she sort of cheered up but it did seem a bit forced. She said she had to hang up cause she was in shock. 

A little later, bf's brother messaged that everyone was in shock cause it was such a quick decision, and poor timing cause of dinner on Friday. As if we're expected to adopt a dog at a time convenient for casual dinner plans? Just leave her at the shelter an extra week? Or pass up on the dog we want cause we already had plans?? I was so confused. He also said their mom was looking forward to dinner, and that we better not be planning on dining and dashing cause of the dog. Is this super weird behavior? I can imagine I would be a little upset if I had invited people over and were planning a dinner, and that something came up.. But if it was something good that would bring joy to their life I'd totally be happy for them! And it's not like we said we wouldn't come.. She has a dog daycare from home, and although she doesn't have any at the moment, she often has dogs overnight in her house, so we assumed it would be fine to bring her if she was being calm and pleasant to be around. If she's acting up, of course one of us would have to stay home. So it sounds like she's just mad that the attention would be on the dog and not her? I have no clue but I feel super disappointed, and also a bit worried about dinner. 

If I have to stay home if the dog is acting up or scared (it'll be her 4th day at our place - she's had a pretty tough past as far as we know), she'll be mad, if the dog is fine and we bring her, she'll be mad. What do I do? ",11,1744003344.0,JUSTNOMIL,5,0.92,False

But I was pleasantly shocked and need to talk about it!

I've been a Coke fiend since I was a teenager. It's embarrassing to think about the times 15-year-old me spent fishing for loose change in the couches and armchairs at the city library, hoping to come up with the five quarters I needed for a cherry Coke from the vending machine. It's even more embarrassing to be 31 and still guzzling soda at every meal, every snack break. Every morning my wife drinks black coffee and I drink a can of Coke (or two) and feel like less of an adult than her.

Well, not anymore. I've finally accepted I can't keep soda in the house, can't drink it at all, because I cannot drink it in moderation. That includes the diet stuff, which just makes me crave the real stuff. So I've been drinking water. A lot of water. And y'all. Y'ALL. Now that I've stopped pouring upwards of 150g of sugar into my mouth on the daily, it's like I have brand new taste buds. Carrots aren't just crunchy bland water - they're sweet! Cucumbers have a flavor, even celery has a flavor! Fruit used to taste like wet pulp with maybe a wisp of sweetness; I had to struggle through eating an entire apple like I was trying to eat a ream of paper. Now I can mow through an orange as easily as I can inhale a bowl of chips.

I genuinely feel a little dumb. I've been swearing for years that fruit used to taste better when I was a child, that it had been years since I had a strawberry that tasted like a strawberry, that modern agriculture had stolen all the flavor from produce. Today I had a handful of strawberries, regular-ass Dole strawberries, and had to stop what I was doing to savor the taste because for the first time in years I could actually taste them. Fruit wasn't ruined for me, I've been ruining it for myself.

Definitely not a revelation but holy crap, it's so much easier to gravitate towards healthy, whole foods when you can actually taste the foods. I'll probably eventually have another Coke, but I'm gonna work hard to keep it from being a habit because I'd rather taste the million other things I put in my body.",32,1744003079.0,loseit,5,0.97,False

Not sure if this really counts as “shifting,” but it was… unsettling. I wasn’t even going to post until this morning but I’m curious about your thoughts, so here goes.

I’ve been trying to get a promotion, putting in some extra effort with one of our clients. The meeting ran way too long, the kind where you’re nodding politely through your sixth round of revisions on a PowerPoint slide for the appendix that no one will ever read. I was fried, suit still on, tie half-loosened, and walking to the subway stop on 42^(nd) Street.

I remember hating that it was already humid in April. Sticky shirt, damp collar, basically perfect subway weather.

The train was maybe a third full. Everyone had that glazed, dead-eyed late-night look. There was a guy with a construction vest sleeping upright. Two teens with headphones sharing a phone screen. A woman doing the crossword in pen. Normal.

A candy woman walked by. You know the type “Got candy, got snacks, two for a dollar, cash or CashApp.” She had a small plastic tote, crinkling as she moved down the aisle. Nobody bought anything, but she made it to the next car and kept going. Her voice faded. Just the sound of wheels on track, the low hum of the semi-working AC.

The lights overhead blinked once, just a surge, and suddenly everything went black and white. Not dark. Just… colorless. The teens. The crossword woman. The ad posters. Even the orange seats were just gray. The whole world, drained of color.

Except me. I looked down at my hands, my pants, my socks. Still in color, slightly shaking.

No one else reacted. That’s what really got me. They just sat there, perfectly still, eyes glassy. No confusion. No movement. Just... grayscale passengers in a world that had stopped caring about color.

It took a few seconds before I realized that it wasn’t visual. The train kept moving, but everything inside it stopped. The hum? Gone. The clatter of the tracks? Gone. I clapped my hands once. Nothing. Tried to speak, no voice. I couldn’t even hear my own heartbeat.

It was like someone hit mute on the universe.

That’s when I noticed the sconce. Yes, a literal wall sconce, like something out of an old mansion, attached near the connecting door. It hadn’t been there before. Wrought iron, twisted into an impossible knot, the flickering flame was the only color in the car, the orange flame bent sideways, but it didn’t cast any light. The glow stayed trapped in the glass.

Right next to it was a brass handle, not a rail, but a handle, like you’d use to pull open a hidden panel. It gleamed faintly, even in the absence of light.

I stood up. Don’t ask me why. I just felt like I had to see more. And I did.

I looked out the window. Not the tunnel walls I expected. Not graffiti or pipes or dust.

Outside, the tunnels stretched upward and sideways, hundreds of them intersecting like water pipes. Inside some, I saw people frozen in grayscale.

Below us, buildings that reminded me of the Gothic cathedrals in Europe. More sconces lined the outside too, hundreds of them, spaced unevenly, some upside down, some floating inches off the wall. They all burned that same pale flame that didn't touch the walls.

I was captivated, staring at the scenery with utter fascination.

That’s when the fear hit me. Sweat dripped into my eyes, and I moved to wipe it away. And as soon as I blinked…

Color.

Sound.

Movement.

I felt a jolt of normalcy like cold water to the face. The train jerked slightly. The lights buzzed. The crossword lady flipped a page.

It was like nothing happened.

I got off two stops later. Walked home in a daze. Told myself it was exhaustion. Maybe something in the air. Dehydration. Or just too much work.

The next morning, Wednesday, I booted up. Coffee in hand, half-asleep, just trying to get through the day.

1jtdqcm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tonsillectomy/comments/1jtdqcm/food_recs_for_recovery/,Food recs for recovery!,"Hi everyone!

I was very scared before my tonsillectomy, but honestly had a very easy recovery. It may have been because my tonsils were on the smaller side, but I had no severe pain really at any point in the process. I wanted to share some food recommendations that worked for me— I followed all the usual tips (humidifier, ice collar, sleep propped up, hydrate with pedialyte or Nuun, berry dissolve Tylenol instead of pills), but I found that nausea from eating certain foods actually caused the most discomfort.

First few days
-I drank coffee, but blended it with oat milk ice cream. 
-I mostly ate CocoJune brand yogurt with lots of honey, which felt amazing on my throat and it never caused nausea. I HIGHLY recommend this for the first few days
-I ate soup, but began to get sick of it. I ate a lot of Annie’s deluxe instant Mac n cheese — the boxed kind will be too much at this point, and these have a “soupy” texture and are easy to eat + make. I added olive oil + salt for extra calories 

A few days in
-I switched to dairy products at this point, it definitely did increase mucus production but felt more nutritious— I would recommend the Yasso Greek yogurt bars
-Around day 6-7 I began eating softer foods such as: bibigo mini wontons, steamed bao buns, scrambled eggs and mashed avocado, French toast made with brioche and soaked in maple syrup, instant oatmeal with toppings like melted chocolate chips + nut butter

I hope this helps anyone who is preparing for their surgery! It is a tough few days/weeks but the pain will eventually pass and it will be worth it!!",4,1744002979.0,Tonsillectomy,0,1.0,False

(19F, 19M)","So I love mornings and I especially love doing stuff in the mornings, I wake up naturally between 5-7 AM and always get out of bed as soon as I can to start my day. My boyfriend however likes sleeping in until 1-2 PM on his free days and I hate my mornings at his place because of it. 

Often when I stay at his place, I wait until 10 AM and then quietly leave, go for a walk and come back with coffee and sometimes breakfast if he doesn’t have anything I could cook for him that I’d also like (we have quite different tastes in food, we’re both picky). This is my way to “compromise”, as I do wake him up when I get back, usually at around 12, but at least it’s a nice morning for him and he has always seemed to love it. 

My issue is wtf do I do with those few hours before going out? He lives in a tiny apartment where the bed is 3 steps away from the kitchen so I can’t just go and chill in another room. I’ve tried taking my macbook with me to make music or play or watch something, etc. but I can’t help but hate the feeling of being “stuck” inside such a little space and not doing anything at least a little productive

Thats fine and dandy except his version of cleaning also involves him “decluttering”. Its not really decluttering. He’s just taking it out of his sight. And he doesn’t care if its his. 

So where the consumption problem comes in is my stuff gets lost fairly frequently. He’s recently lost grass seed and a type of coffee maker of mine. He doesn’t recall seeing either. I found the grass seed tonight while hunting for my coffee maker. Didn’t find the coffee maker. In the past he has lost an iron. I was home on summer break, bought an iron so I could sew. Came back the next summer and he had no clue what he had done with it and my digging produced nothing. I bought another. 

This gets frustrating on many levels, and they are deeper emotionally for me than just trying to reduce consumption. But none of us are here for that. Do I buy another coffee maker? Do I go through their storage sheds (yes, plural) and clean and get rid of trash and organize? Mind you, we finally seem to have beat the bed bugs mostly back, but the sheds are full of quarantined stuff. Do I just accept that its gone and won’t be replaced? (Picky coffee drinker, but its part of some personal stuff that I’m not getting into, thats the way I will drink coffee). 

At a loss for now and just contemplating the value of any of these ideas. My family is not exactly on anti consumption in any way, but sometimes I do reduce some ways of waste. So this complaint falls mostly on deaf ears until I explain its also sentimental to me. Until then, they don’t really see the problem replacing things. ",2,1744002011.0,Anticonsumption,1,1.0,False
1jtdg2n,https://www.reddit.com/r/FIRE_Ind/comments/1jtdg2n/bacherlorpythons_guide_to_firey_dating/,BacherlorPython's Guide To FIREy Dating,"Married people, this post is not for you. Please feel free to skip it. 


A few weeks ago, there was a post raising concerns about the impact of FIRE on romantic relationships. Apparently, the words ‘Early Retirement’ does not quite have the effect of an aphrodisiac on people you are hoping to date. FIRE is still a very fringe idea in society and people willing to bow out of the game with a lot of money still on the table are not looked upon favorably by reasonable, salt-of-the-earth folks; your prospective date possibly being one of them. 


Now, most Indian kids, sometime in their 20s, approach their parents and say ‘please find someone who will have sex with me for the rest of my life as I don't have the charm or the confidence to get it done myself’ (What? Isn't that how the arranged marriage process starts? No? Okay… my bad). But you are different. You are in your late 20s/early 30's, single, pursuing FIRE, definitely interested in dating and maybe in marriage. You are perfectly capable of dating on your own. You just need some help in framing your FIRE pursuit as a reasonable, logical, even desirable goal. Successfully navigating questions from your date around FIRE could be the difference between ‘let's check the sturdiness of your bed’ and ‘let's end the date early as I am permanently moving to Yemen tomorrow’. 


But who has the knowledge of such a niche subject? Who has retired in his early 40s, has more than 28 years of dating experience and is wisdom personified? …Yours Truly, of course! And I am willing to help. Just hold your applause till the end. 


**Starters**

So you are in the initial phase of dating someone. You have covered hobbies, interests, family background etc in your conversations and now approaching finances. Now, before even touching the topic of early retirement, you need to sell the importance of Early Financial Independence. You can state that in today's day and age, there is no such thing as job security. Massive job cuts due to the advent of AI and automation, ageism in companies, changing workforce dynamics etc. are some of the reasons. Refer to this scholarly [article](https://www.reddit.com/r/FIRE_Ind/s/BxKOBihnZ3) for detailed talking points. Your date is likely to agree as this is happening all over. 


**Main Course**

Then you get into the territory of job dissatisfaction. You can say something to the effect that in the beginning of your career, you loved your job. But after years of meaningless assignments, impossible deadlines, obstinate bosses and toxic colleagues in multiple companies, you are feeling a bit worn out. Money is probably the only reason you are still continuing with this job. Your date would agree with you here too as most jobs are like this. 


**Dessert**

Now comes the tricky part about early retirement. You can say that one of the reasons you are pursuing financial independence is that after achieving it, you will be able to say 'NO' to more problematic assignments. If things get truly unbearable, you can move on and find something that you really like. And if you are unable to find anything like that then you would prefer to be retired+bored than be employed+depressed. Give an impression that early retirement is the last option you will consider even if it's the first thing you will do after hitting your corpus target. To your date, this may sound bold but not totally unreasonable.


**Coffee**

Here your date might ask ‘How much corpus is required to be able to retire early?’ No need to get into too much depth and simply answer ‘From various studies and simulations, 33 times the annual expenses invested equally in equity and debt should last 40 years’. 


The next obvious question will be ‘How do you know for sure that your FIRE Corpus will last your lifetime?’ You need to counter that question with ‘How do you know that the corpus you will amass by working till 58 will definitely last your lifetime?’ Suggest that no amount of corpus can fully cover all the risks that are known today; forget about new risks that will arise in future. One can only make reasonable assumptions, prepare contingency plans and hope for the best. 


By this time, your date will be curious about your current corpus. I trust it goes without saying ‘NEVER reveal your corpus figure to ANYBODY’. Now many people won't ask you directly. They will look for nonverbal cues to assess your wealth. Ideally, you would want to come across as ‘financially comfortable but not necessarily rich.’ Towards that, take your date to modest restaurants/pubs/bars but pay the full bill. Don't order fancy dishes but tip very well. Wear inexpensive clothes but sport an elegant watch. Keep them guessing about your corpus. If someone asks you directly (This is India, after all) then deflect it by saying something funny such as ‘that’s a 5th date conversation' or ‘it is bad luck to talk about money when Mercury is in retrograde’. If they still persist, that's an obvious red flag. 


**In Conclusion** 

Do not hard-sale FIRE. You are supposed to be a romantic and not an Amway associate. FIRE is a radical idea but not that complicated. Most people will understand it, no problem. But very few will approve of it. That's the reality. Remember… Even if everyone else is wrong and you are right then for all practical purposes, you are wrong. But that did not have to be a big problem. You can still have a short term relationship with people who do not care for FIRE. But when it comes to long term relationships, not only your prospective partner needs to approve of FIRE but their vision of the same also needs to be in sync with yours. The relationship won't work if you are comfortable with LEANFIRE but your partner is not willing to consider anything less than FATFIRE. Please get that clarity before making any long term plans with your paramour. 

So go forth, swipe wisely and may your awkward silences be short!

I have been on various different medications over the years and nothing has ever worked except prednisone. I have struggled for a long time but thankfully no surgeries. I have always researched and seen cases of people curing themselves by doing various diets and fixing their gut microbiome. I always wished that for myself but unfortunately I was younger and just wanted to eat whatever I wanted and go out with my friends. It never really made any sense though because all that did was cause me to suffer more in the long run with pain, terrible bathroom visits, and rapid weight lose and gain (from the prednisone). Just about a week ago I finally decided to make a change, a real one. I cut out my usual sugar free energy drink or 2 a day. I saw research about how artificial sweeteners can disrupt the gut microbiome so I cut them cold turkey. Now I have just a cup of coffee or iced matcha in the morning, herbal tea and bone broth at night, and tons of water throughout the day. Most of my daily diet has just consisted of grass fed beef (a lot of it), pasture raised eggs, dairy, and many different types of fruits. Mostly berries, kiwis, bananas, and oranges. Adding to that I have been trying to eat probiotic rich foods such as sauerkraut and bubbies pickles. When it comes to dairy mostly I couldn't tolerate dairy for the most part but after looking up a lot of information I ended up giving it a try. Not just any dairy, raw dairy. I started consuming raw milk and raw cheese for the probiotic benefits. I feel absolutely no discomfort from these things which I still cant believe because if I ever had a cup of conventional milk I felt like my stomach was going to explode. 

To summarize the book I just fed everyone, I have been feeling amazing. Its only been about a week but I can already tell an 80% relief in symptoms. Stools have been solid for the most part, not perfect but a ton better. I am not as tired throughout the day and I just mentally feel so much better. I am going to keep this up and keep committing to getting better. Would love any tips from anyone on things to add to my daily routine. I will not be a victim, I will be an example.

1jtd5cu,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1jtd5cu/am_i_doing_something_wrong/,Am I doing something wrong???,"On a trip with a girl friend. We’ve been fine till we came to this small town on a lake. A lot more people (mostly boys) have been giving me attention but it’s been purely casual. Last night we hung out with two guys after a bar and just drank and smoked and talked for a long time. She was the one who accepted the invitation to hang with them after the bar. My friend wanted to go but kept giving me signals (like why can’t you also call it a night too??) so after the second signal I called it.  Afterwards they said that I enjoyed the attention from men (so what???). 

This morning they got a super late start so I went ahead and ventured off on my own and swam in the lake and met a couple more people. One guy in particular asked to hang out so I met up with my friend again after the lake. They wanted to split off and go to the lake, and I wanted to eat. So I went into town and shopped for a bit and then met up with the guy for coffee and a chat. Again, purely casual. My friend was texting me asking about the cafe I was at and what smoothies they had so I sent her the menu. She came over and stayed completely silent on her phone. Then basically said “I’m trying to take the boat to the next town asap so if you want to keep hanging with the boy I’m going to ditch you”. So I said goodbye and off we went. 

They said that I was ignoring them because I missed a call but I was texting them back pretty frequently and never left them on read. 

They never said they wanted to eat in the other town and we had a time limit to catch the transportation back so it was very quick. They mentioned they wanted to eat in the town we were at when we were leaving and I apologized and said “I’m so sorry if I had known you wanted to eat there I would’ve been more in a rush”. Which I feel is reasonable?? 

It’s a short trip and I’m trying to be respectful of the places they want to go to as well. But I had a few moments so far on this trip where I felt like they are “dimming my light”. Small comments that make me feel bad about myself, the boys approaching me being a problem. I feel like I’m doing something wrong but I’m also just trying to have fun on this trip too. 

Anyways, TLDR am I the problem for hanging out with a boy while they went off and did something else? ",3,1744000747.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

1jtd20g,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jtd20g,Still very bitter... But not as unpleasant.,"Good night! Yesterday I made a post asking for advice with the Moka pot. I mentioned that the brew that came out was so bitter that it ""stang"" when I driked it.
Many people here gabe their advises and suggestions, and I did the following changes:

- Actually made sure the basket was filled up to the top
- Boiling water instead of room temperature
- Grinded finer
- Took out of the heat earlier 

The result was a still VERY bitter coffee, but not as bitter as before. It didn't ""sting"", but the bitterness was very upfront. It didn't linger.
Weirdly enough, I also noticed the coffee was kinda ""thick"" (last image).
I thought it might've been the beans I was using, because despite the recent roast date, the roast itself wasn't Medium as it was labeled, it was very dark, so I changed to an actual medium roast coffee I have ( Fava de Mel from Fazenda 7 Senhoras).
What surprised me is that the result didn't change much. Very little was different, from the smell to the color of the coffee.
I made these same coffees in different methods, and they all were tasty, and they had little to no bitterness whatsoever. This makes me believe it's something I'm doing very wrong still, since I used different coffees with different roast profiles and it came out the same taste, smell and appearance.

So what else am I missing?
Is it normal for the puck to change color this much?
Is my gas stove too hot?
Should I try to go coarser? Should I use less water?
I can see my grind is not coming out very even, but it's what I'm able to work with right now, is this a huge problem?

So, a lot of people have messaged me asking about my protocol. Figured at this stage it's probably easiest to just put it here for people to come back to.

About three years ago I got rid of my SIBO. It took about two years to do it, and a LOT of trial and error.A lot.I've avoided posting for a while because in my experience any time I do it ends up with a lot of debate and arguments, and just to be perfectly honest that's not what I'm here for.I assume most people who get rid of SIBO leave these boards and likely don't come back, job done. As a result, a lot of the help is from people who still have it, or have 'done the research', or are trying to find people to come to their clinic (seen a lot of this lately, including a TCM practitioner who is using this board to find clients which is sketchy af) 

Not ideal. You need something that has worked. Not should work in theory.

The other thing I run into is a lot of questioning the rationale or attempts at retailoring/adjusting. This is a relatively new diagnosis. It is not an exact science. What works for one person may or may not work for another. My honest is, find a system that worked for someone, and try that. Don't reinvent it. Don't armchair expert it. Do what worked, or at least try it. And then if it doesn't work, abandon it.

I once had the best chocolate chip cookie I've ever had at a party once, I asked the woman what her secret was. She said 'I follow the instructions on the box exactly to the measure. Why would I think I know more than the cookie people?'

I'm definitely not the cookie people. But I do have a method, it took a lot of work to get right. And I believe it needs to be done just right to work. I hope that it will work for you. Just to avoid argument I'll likely be muting replies on this at some point. But If you DO try it out, and need help, please feel free to DM me. All I ask that you try it this way first.

1: You need to get the mechanics right first. Before you can kill it. This is the most important single aspect of beating SIBO. If you start at part 2, you it won't work, because your sibo is coming back at the same time you're killing it.

What I'm going to try to get you to do is hyperdigest food. So much so that food goes through you easier and faster. We're not trying to isolate a specific issue. We're going to put your whole digestion into overdrive. Motility gets a lot of attention, but if food isn't digested well, it will move slower. The two go hand in hand.

This is primarily for Hydrogen, but it should work for the most part for methane. Methane is tougher, but this SHOULD make everything else easier once you've done it consistently for about a month.

I want you to get these EXACT brands.

1: Power Digest by Wholesome Health. This takes the place of like 7 other supplements I tried. It literally mimics digestion. Top to bottom. It is phased so it digests the way your body is supposed to, almost like an exogenous digestion. It's incredibly helpful. Take TWO with each meal or snak. As soon as you eat.They don't as of now offer international shipping, and the company is super tiny, but I bet if you ask them they would do it.

2: Spectrazyme Pancreatin 9x ES 1 with meals: the only downside to Power Digest is the pancreatic enzymes aren't enough. This stuff is like baby creon, it's pretty powerful and hits right when your body needs it.

3: Benfotiamine 150-250mg- 1 with meals: Increases motility, gastric acid, it does a lot. If you get tired the first time you take it, don't worry it will go away. Other forms of Thiamine work too, but Benfo just happens to be my favorite.

4: Zinc. Ideally liposomal 50mg- once per day. Codeage is a good brand. Low Zinc correlates to low gastric acid. 

5: Motegrity/Plucaloopride or Pyrodistimine if you have it. Take it how is best for you, some people find motegrity best 3-4 hours after eating. Some people right after. If you can't get either, and Artichoke/Ginger supplement like Gut Motility can help a lot, but it may run out of it's efficacy long term. The others should still help a lot, so hopefully this is just getting you from an 7/8 to a 9/10.

Try that, as written, on it's own for two weeks before adding any of the next pieces. Your SIBO will not go away. But keep very clear notes of whether you digestion gets even slightly easier.

If not, lets add based on your experience:

A: You feel like food is still getting 'stuck' and you're constipated.

Add Fibercon. This is not just another Fiber, it can't feed bacteria, and it will help get fluid into your intestines. So, it should make things easier to pass.

B: You still don't feel like you're able to digest... at all. Likely you have a bit of dysbiosis, you probably did a kill phase at some point, or an antibiotic that left you not feeling great. Get Kefirlabs Coconut Kefir, have about a third of a bottle after each meal. If it makes things worse, drop it right away. This is a 50/50 split- works great for some, not for others. 

C: You still can't eat some stuff.You can't go spend your life avoiding foods. If your car doesn't turn left, you don't just never take left turns. You take it to the mechanic and get it fixed. Based on which foods bother you most, go to Intoleran.com and try to find the one the works for you. Alternatively, Fodmate works great for many people in doing all of them.

D: You're getting gassy symptoms:Take Atrantil whenever you get symptoms. It will say to take it when you eat, just take it as needed, two at a time. This stuff is magic for gas.

If you're still having trouble, try adding another from the A/B/C/D category, it's tough to exactly line up symptoms to treatments. But try to stick to these temporarily.

E: You've tried ABCD exactly as suggested and they are just not doing it.Can you get pyrodistigmine or motegrity and add them in? If so, do it. If not, I may not have an answer for you. I deeply apologize. 

F: One last thing that helped me a lot: Intoleran's Starchway. I take one before bed and it feels like my gut goes into overdrive. Can't explain it for the life of me, but try it!

I would also HIGHLY recommend not eating within 4 hours of going to bed.

Now, likely you have ideally some improvement when you eat. Sibo is still there, but you have less difficulty when eating. (I hope, I got like a 70% hit ratio at this point. Ideally you're in the 70.) If you're not here, don't move to kill. I'm telling you it won't work. I would bet a lot of people reading have actually figured out their kill but because the mechanics are off, the SIBO is actually coming back at the same time they're killing it. If you haven't gotten your mechanics right, it will likely come back soon after or worse, it won't even feel like it's gone.

THE KILL:

1: The first thing I would try is EPC's Sustained Release Dehydroberberine.

The slow release makes it kill slowly and over time. It's powerful but it just stays in your system killing over and over. It's great stuff. It's not just berberine, it's the sustained release aspect that makes it so potent, I've yet to see another supplement work that way.

2: Next up: Xifaxin + NAC. Taking 1000mg of NAC each time you take Xifaxin makes it like crazy potent, at least for me. Cedars recommends this protocol as well, so there's def rationale behind it.

3: You're gonna tell me I'm crazy, but if you're getting here and you still aren't having success, try Kefir Labs Coconut Kefir- the amount of good bacteria in there can just wipe out the bad. It helps me on the rare occasion I get a flare up (normally I only get them if I eat super late before bed.) It's worked for a few people on these threads.

Lastly, there are the more extreme methods:

A: If you're open to it, Antibiotics will likely work. My two favorites are Alinia and Cipro. Alinia is a lot of things at once, but it's antibiotic qualities seem to be perfect for most SIBO. Cipro gets a lot of haters. Obviously talk to your doctor first, and you will need to to get it prescribed anyways. Yes, It has red label warnings, but then again so does Tylenol. It's frequently prescribed at hospitals and generally considered fairly safe except for those with tendon issues among older people. I suggest you decide for yourself by visiting the floxxies thread on Reddit if you're on the fence. You'll likely notice the lack of consistency in the symptoms people claim to have. I don't agree with the hate but again I don't want to argue, but  if you're really concerned about it Just Don't Take It. (easy enough!)

B: Just do the Elemental Diet. It works. Nearly every time. The thing is, you HAVE to have your mechanics figured out first. It takes a LONG FUCKING TIME, and it is awful. People say 2 weeks, I say it's more like three for most people to see success. You got to stick to it. The worst would be to go through all that and not have your mechanics figured out and have to do it again, so focus on that first and foremost. Oh, and you can have coffee. It's kind of the one little cheat. And if you get a decent tasting Elemental, you can put a little in your coffee too and it's kinda like sweet and low.

BEST OF LUCK. Feel free to hit me up if you need any guidance, all I ask is do part 1 first.
