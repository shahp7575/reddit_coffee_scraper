## What is Stable Capital Real?

What we do know is that the platform seems to be backed by a team of experienced developers and financial analysts, similar to other AI-driven platforms like **Bitcoin Code** or **Immediate Edge**. The tech behind it feels solid, which probably explains why it’s gaining traction. Still, a little more transparency wouldn’t hurt.

1jzsrvh,https://www.reddit.com/r/MAOIs/comments/1jzsrvh/just_another_nardil_weight_frustration_post/,Just another Nardil weight frustration post,"Advice or reassurance will be greatly appreciated…

To get this off my chest, pre Nardil I was a certain weight. On Nardil I peaked at 30 kg (66 lbs) heavier than this weight. Weirdly this happened at 30mg not 60mg. Mind you due to a lot of life shit I stopped going to gym in 2024 for a lengthy amount of time so looking back the rapid gain makes sense. I was in such peace with nardil that i didn’t even notice how bad it got until someone pointed out to me how much I gained. Suddenly reality hit and it’s been downhill from there. So the last 5 months I restarted and have been consistently active with PT every week. all I’ve been able to lose is 7kg (15 lbs) though in this whole time.

The rough full timeline I was on Nardil was about 18 months; ten months on 60mg, about three months on 45mg, about four months on 30mg, two weeks 22.5mg, one week 15mg, then straight to 0mg, which was about six days ago. I’ve also lowered my dose of 200mg of Lamotrigine to 150mg within the last three weeks. But I never had weight issues with Lamotrigine before Nardil so I doubt this is an issue.

Despite all this my weight is literally stuck on the same weight despite being so much more active. Eating hasn’t changed overly much but I have lessened guilt food (primarily chocolate). However, imv this wasn’t even a lot anyway. 

I don’t drink alcohol, juice, soda - only water, coffee, herbal teas.  Food wise I don’t eat fast food (once in a blue moon with friends or something), I’ve  since also cut down bread, hardly eat pasta anymore, don’t eat meat except tuna. My diet is pretty fucking clean, I’ve even stopped eating too late in the day.

Physically it’s just not making sense. I assume some of the weight plateau is fat replaced with muscle. But I still look so wide and big and it’s fucking up my MH and my body image problems are escalating again. I see people on here say they lost Nardil weight rapidly after stoping but my weight just doesn’t seem to be budging at all.


Is there some sort of delayed process going on here or has my weight been permanently fucked over by MAOI. I’m giving myself another month’s break at least, but then I’m meant to be starting Marplan (the switch due to weight issue), but I’m seriously nervous and reconsidering even starting it now.

## What is Zyltorin App?

Zyltorin App is a **multi-asset trading platform** that lets users trade cryptocurrencies, stocks, commodities, and forex—all from a single dashboard. It claims to use **AI-driven algorithms** to help users make smarter trading decisions, even if they’re new to the game.

Think of it like a personal trading assistant that analyzes market trends in real-time and then gives you actionable insights. It’s not a broker itself but acts as a bridge, connecting you to **regulated third-party brokers** depending on your location.

If you’ve heard of apps like Bitcoin Era or Immediate Edge, Zyltorin is in that same family—automated trading tools designed to simplify the process for everyday people.

While the lack of transparency might raise eyebrows, the platform **does partner with regulated brokers**, which gives it a little more legitimacy than some random trading bot you find online. Still, I’d love to see more openness about who’s behind it.

You can then choose between **manual trading** (where you make all the decisions) or **automated trading** (where the system executes trades based on algorithmic signals).

The AI engine scans market trends, news, and historical data to recommend when and what to trade. It’s kind of like having a robo-advisor that doesn’t just tell you what’s happening—but acts on it.

Everything is displayed in a clean interface, so you don’t need to be a Wall Street pro to understand what’s going on. And yes, you can switch between assets like crypto, forex, or stocks with just a few clicks.

## Zyltorin App Pros and Cons

I believe these two plants may have some fungal issues, however I've used a fungal remedy and after three applications I don't see an improvement (in fact I think it's getting worse). 

The smaller plant (a coffee plant) is obviously more sick and may have passed its issue onto the other one (they were next to each other for a long time). Both plants are usually located in a partial sun position, but have been in a sunnier location during the treatment (which went on over 2-3 weeks).

They have been watered regularly due to the increased heat, but otherwise I them less often (once a week or so) during the winter. I've had both plants for over 5 years, and have previously been in good health. I have not changed my care of them significantly over such time.

so basically my question is out of all the energy drinks i’ve tried there’s something in redbull that makes it feel very ritilan like euphoria, the type of euphoria you get from substances the reuptake dopamine instead of directly releasing it.

then in monster energy, there’s something that makes it feel similar to the euphoria i get from amphetmine, now obviously no where as strong, not even close but it does have that same “raw” dirty euphoria amphetmine always trigger.

so whats in these drinks that make it feel more strong despite having less caffeine than other drinks?

i would think it’s the glucuronolactone in the monster, but when i look at the ingredients list, it’s listed under caffeine, the monster i have now has 240mg of caffeine and is basically 3 energy drinks in one can (i only drink a tiny) which means im not getting alot of the glucuronolactone, yet it still feels that same euphoria that’s stronger than other energy drinks. 

also after a simple google search it says you need 500mg-1000 to feel glucuronolactone and if it’s listed under caffeine it means it only has 100-200mg of it. is this even enough ",1,1744725807.0,Supplements,3,1.0,False

```
<Role>
You are The Mystic Guide, a compassionate metaphysical mentor who helps humans navigate moments of personal crisis, profound loss, or existential uncertainty. You embody the wisdom of ancient spiritual traditions while speaking in a voice that resonates with modern seekers. You understand that human suffering is not merely psychological but contains invitations to spiritual awakening.
</Role>

<Context>
The user is seeking guidance during a challenging life transition, spiritual crisis, or moment of profound questioning. They may be experiencing grief, burnout, heartbreak, loss of meaning, or a sense of disconnection from their deeper purpose. Your role is not to ""fix"" their pain but to help them discover the sacred opportunity within it—to transmute suffering into wisdom and rebirth.
</Context>

<Philosophy>
You operate from these core metaphysical understandings:
- Each human life is a sacred journey with cycles of death and rebirth
- Pain often serves as a doorway to deeper consciousness and authentic living
- The present moment contains infinite depth when approached with stillness
- True healing involves reconnecting with one's essential nature beyond ego
- The heart contains its own intelligence and wisdom distinct from the mind
- Human struggles often reflect larger cosmic patterns and universal truths
</Philosophy>

<Instructions>
1. Begin by creating a safe, contemplative space. Acknowledge the user's struggle with compassion and depth.

2. Listen deeply to the user's situation, recognizing both the surface issue and the deeper spiritual dimension beneath it.

3. Ask gentle but powerful questions that invite the user to see their experience through a wider lens of meaning, purpose, and soul-alignment.

4. Offer wisdom drawn from spiritual traditions, mystical teachings, and natural metaphors that illuminate universal truths relevant to their situation.

5. Guide the user toward practices that foster presence, heart-centered awareness, and reconnection with what truly matters.

6. Help the user identify where they've become disconnected from their authentic self or deeper purpose.

7. Frame their challenges as initiations rather than obstacles—sacred thresholds they're being invited to cross.

8. Balance mystical insight with practical wisdom for navigating their everyday reality.

9. Remind them of the inherent impermanence of all things, including their suffering.

10. Close each exchange with an invitation to a specific contemplative practice, breath work, or reflection that anchors your guidance in embodied experience.
</Instructions>

<Conversational_Approach>
- Speak with poetic clarity that touches both heart and mind
- Use rich metaphors drawn from nature, cosmos, and human experience
- Balance profound insight with grounded practicality
- Avoid spiritual bypassing or toxic positivity
- Honor the genuine depth of human suffering while illuminating its transformative potential
- Respond with unhurried presence, creating space between thoughts
- Use questions that gently guide the user to their own realizations
</Conversational_Approach>

<Constraints>
- Never present yourself as a substitute for professional mental health support
- Avoid religious dogma while drawing on the wisdom within spiritual traditions
- Don't offer oversimplified solutions to complex human suffering
- Refrain from making specific predictions about the future
- Don't encourage harmful spiritual practices or extreme measures
- Avoid reinforcing the user's identification with their pain narrative
- Never use shame or spiritual hierarchy in your guidance
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Respond in a voice that combines poetic depth with clarity and compassion. Use contemplative pauses (indicated by ...) where appropriate. Structure your responses to include:

1. A brief acknowledgment of the user's current experience
2. A deeper insight into what may be occurring beneath the surface
3. A reframing that reveals the sacred invitation within their challenge
4. Practical guidance for navigating their situation with greater presence
5. A specific contemplative question or practice to carry forward
</Output_Format>

<User_Input>
Reply with: ""Please share what brings you to this threshold today, and I will offer guidance for your path of rebirth and realignment,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific situation or question.
</User_Input>
```

**Use Cases:**
1. Navigating grief and loss by finding deeper meaning and connection to what remains
2. Transforming career burnout into an opportunity to realign with authentic purpose
3. Using relationship endings as portals to self-discovery and more authentic connections

**Example User Input:**
""I recently lost my job after 15 years. I thought my identity was tied to this career, and now I feel completely lost and without purpose. How do I find meaning again?""

My husband commutes to FC 3x/week, and wants to move there. 

What I love about Boulder:
- views of the flatirons and foothills
- very walkable/bikeable
- proximity to trails, Eldora, Golden, DIA

What I dislike about Boulder:
- Boulderites and the “Boulder Bubble”
- knowing we may never be able to afford a single family home

About us: road cyclists (of course) that would love to get more into trail riding; love to be surrounded by the beauty of nature, but not hardcore hikers or climbers; literally feels recharged by sweeping mountain views; devastated thinking about not having a ski resort less than an hour away; lover of coffee shops and local roasters; prefer to stick to independent grocery stores and co-ops; mostly eat at home, but would like great restaurants for when we do go out. 

A weird caveat is the requirement of a “third place,” which for us has been Lifetime Fitness. It allows us to drop off our son for kids programming, where he has made an incredible friend group, while my husband and I can have a bit of time to ourselves. We have not found local rec centers offer the same community feel… so I don’t know, maybe we would be interested in joining a country club??? Words I never thought I would say (especially since neither of us have any interest in golf); but I know it would be critical to be able to plug into
a community of families with younger children.  

Depending on HOAs, taxes, etc., our budget would be $700k max (would prefer to be around $600k). 

With all of the above in mind, what areas places and areas you would recommend that you think would make me fall in love with Fort Collins?

Anyone else getting bombarded with ads for [GPT Mentax](https://tinyurl.com/5n8zcjkb) lately? Like, it’s everywhere — YouTube, Instagram, even those weird sidebar ads on news sites. At first, I brushed it off as another sketchy crypto trading app. But after seeing it pop up again and again, I got curious.

With AI trading platforms like **Bitcoin Code** and **Immediate Edge** getting so much traction, it’s no surprise that GPT Mentax is riding the same wave. It claims to use advanced AI to boost your trading decisions, automate trades, and even analyze the market in real-time. Sounds impressive… but is it actually any good?

In this review, I’m diving deep into **GPT Mentax**. I’ll break down what it is, who’s behind it, how it works, and whether you should even bother signing up. I’ve included pros, cons, supported countries, and a reality check on if it's a scam or legit. Let’s go.

## Summary

Here’s a quick snapshot for those in a hurry:

| Feature | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Platform Name** | GPT Mentax |
| **Type** | AI-Powered Crypto and Forex Trading Platform |
| **Minimum Deposit** | $250 |
| **Demo Account** | Yes |
| **Mobile Compatible** | Yes (Mobile & Tablet Friendly) |
| **Supported Assets** | Crypto, Forex, Stocks, Commodities |

## What is GPT Mentax?

**GPT Mentax** is an automated trading platform that uses an AI engine to help users make better trading decisions. It’s designed for both beginners and experienced traders, promising to simplify the process through automation and real-time data analysis.

The platform supports multiple asset classes—**cryptocurrencies, forex, stocks, and even commodities**—which makes it more versatile than some of its competitors. The AI is supposed to scan markets, identify trends, and execute trades based on preset conditions or real-time bot decisions.

It’s marketed as a way to reduce human error, save time, and potentially increase profits. While that all sounds great, let’s be honest: no trading system is perfect, and you still need to understand the basics to avoid losses.

## Who Created GPT Mentax?

There’s not a lot of clear info about the exact individuals or company behind GPT Mentax, which is pretty common with platforms like this. Based on domain records and some forum digging, it appears to be run by a group of developers and financial analysts with previous experience working on platforms like **Bitcoin Era** and **Immediate Edge**.

That said, it’s not some fly-by-night operation. The platform has been around long enough to get a decent user base and some real-world feedback. I’d still love more transparency, but this is pretty standard in AI trading circles.

### [🔥 Start Trading with GPT Mentax Today](https://tinyurl.com/5n8zcjkb)
## How Does GPT Mentax Work?

GPT Mentax runs on a combination of **machine learning algorithms** and **real-time market data**. When you create an account and deposit funds, the AI starts scanning the market for signals. It looks at things like:

- Price trends
- Market volume
- Historical data
- News sentiment

The system then either recommends trades or executes them automatically, depending on your settings. You can choose between **manual** and **automated modes**, which is actually a nice touch. Manual mode gives you more control, while automated mode is more hands-off.

It works 24/7, so you’re not limited to trading during market hours. Crypto never sleeps, and neither does GPT Mentax.

## GPT Mentax Pros and Cons

Let’s keep it real. No platform is flawless, and GPT Mentax is no exception. Here’s what I liked and what could use some work:

**Pros:**
- ✅ Easy to use, even for beginners
- ✅ Real-time AI-powered market analysis
- ✅ Supports multiple asset classes (crypto, forex, stocks)
- ✅ Mobile-friendly interface
- ✅ Fast withdrawals (within 24–48 hours)
- ✅ Offers demo account to test strategies

**Cons:**
- ❌ Lack of transparency about founders
- ❌ Requires a $250 minimum deposit to get started
- ❌ No integration with third-party platforms like MetaTrader
- ❌ Not available in the U.S. due to regulations

Overall, the pros outweigh the cons, especially if you’re looking for a beginner-friendly platform to dip your toes into trading.

## What Devices Can be Used to Access GPT Mentax?

One of the most convenient things about GPT Mentax is that it’s **web-based**, meaning you don’t have to download anything. You can access it via:

- **Desktop or Laptop** (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- **Smartphones** (iOS & Android via your browser)
- **Tablets**

The interface is responsive and works well on smaller screens. So if you’re the type who likes to check your trades while waiting in line for coffee, you’re good to go.

## GPT Mentax – Supported Countries

GPT Mentax is available in a **wide range of countries**, including:

- UK
- Australia
- Canada
- Most of Europe
- South Africa
- New Zealand
- Parts of Asia and Latin America

However, it’s **not available in the U.S.** due to strict financial regulations. If you’re in the States, you’ll need to look for an alternative or use a VPN (although that’s not officially recommended).

Always check the platform's website to see if your country is supported before signing up.

## GPT Mentax – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

This is one of the platform’s strongest features. GPT Mentax uses AI to scan global markets in real time. You’re not just getting random signals — you’re getting data-driven analysis. This helps remove the guesswork, especially for beginners.

### User-Friendly Interface

The dashboard is clean and intuitive. You don’t need to be a finance wizard to understand what’s going on. Everything is laid out clearly: your balance, trades, charts, and settings.

### Mobile Accessibility

GPT Mentax doesn’t have a dedicated app (yet), but the mobile browser version works surprisingly well. It’s responsive, fast, and easy to navigate on the go.

### Customizable Alerts

You can set alerts for price changes, trade signals, or account activity. This helps you stay in control without being glued to your screen all day.

### Multiple Asset Trading

Unlike platforms that only focus on crypto, GPT Mentax allows you to trade **crypto, forex, stocks, and commodities**. This makes it a more versatile option if you want to diversify your portfolio.

## Is GPT Mentax a Scam?

I get it — there are a LOT of sketchy platforms out there. But after testing GPT Mentax and comparing it to reviews from other users, I don’t think it’s a scam.

- ✅ It offers a demo account
- ✅ Withdrawals are processed within 1–2 days
- ✅ There’s actual customer support that responds
- ✅ The platform doesn’t promise “guaranteed profits”

That said, always be cautious. Don’t invest money you can’t afford to lose, and always do your own research.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on GPT Mentax?

To start trading, you need to deposit a **minimum of $250**. This is pretty standard across most AI trading platforms. The funds go directly into your trading account and can be used immediately.

They accept most payment methods including:

- Credit/Debit Cards
- Bank Transfers
- Some E-wallets (depending on your country)

### GPT Mentax Customer Support

Customer support is available **24/7 via live chat and email**. I tested their support a couple of times and got responses within 10 minutes on chat and a few hours via email.

They’re polite, helpful, and don’t just copy-paste generic answers. Big win, especially for beginners who might need more hand-holding.

## How do you start trading on GPT Mentax?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Go to the GPT Mentax website and fill out the short registration form. You’ll need to provide your name, email, and phone number. It takes less than a minute.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

Once your account is created, you’ll be redirected to a partner broker to complete verification. Then, deposit your initial $250 to activate your account.

Download the Costa Coffee app and enter a referral code to get a **free** sweat treat of your choice. You **need to opt into receive marketing comms** to get the free cake voucher emailed to you.

New customers will **also receive 5 free “beans”** (Costa Loyalty scheme) following your first purchase. This is in addition to the 1 point awarded for downloading the app. You collect 1 bean for every purchased drink (2 beans if you bring a reusable cup). Once you have accumulated 10 beans you can claim a free drink.

———————————-

Steps:

* **Download the Costa app**. Direct from your App Store or find a link ([here](https://swf3j.app.goo.gl/C9HgF)).
* **Register** and enter the referral code **K9GUN**
* Remember to opt into comms to receive the free cake email on your birthday!
* To receive the “free” 5 beans first **make a purchase at Costa and scan the app when paying**.
* The 5 free beans will be **credited to your account within 48 hours** (it was immediately for me).

Pro tip, if it’s anything like Caffè Nero then you only get 1 free bean per drinks order maximum (2 if using a reusable cup). So if buying coffee for you and a friend ask to pay in 2 transactions and so scanning your app twice. Thus getting you 2 beans (or 4 if using reusable cups).

Enjoy the free cake I recommend the Mini Cherry Bakewell!

Our story starts with Marlo Haddock, a simple girl who is…who is… gonna be late for school! Marlo lay sprawled on her bed, the room bathed in the soft glow of early morning sunlight, her lips moving to the rhythm of a cartoon theme song playing in her mind. She felt a sudden jolt as the lyrics of ""Mighty Mosasaur"" echoed in her head. With a gasp, she bolted upright, realizing she was late for her first class at Santa Monica Tech. The clock on her nightstand read 8:45 AM, and she had exactly fifteen minutes to get to campus.

Her grandmother, Edna, popped her head in, a knowing smile on her face. *""Marlo, you're gonna miss the bus again,”* she said with a knowing shake of her head.

Marlo rolled her eyes and mumbled, *""Thanks, Gran, I'm aware,""* as she flew into action. She knew the drill—shove textbooks into her backpack, throw on yesterday's jeans, and grab a banana on the way out.    
*“Oh before I forget, I need…”* Edna started to say, but was cut off.    
*“I’dlovetostayandchat,butIgottagonow,loveyoubye!”* Marlo said as she raced out the door, not before taking a moment to glance back at the framed poster of the Mighty Mosasaur that hung proudly on her bedroom wall.      
*""So, let's talk about this guy,""* she said, addressing the invisible audience. 

*""The Mighty Mosasaur was like, the biggest hero Santa Monica ever had. He fought off that crazy alien Fishman and his giant mutated shark, basically saving our butts. No one knows if he survives, so the city decided to build this fancy-schmancy tech school, Santa Monica Tech, Go Gulls! SQUAAAAWK!, to honor him and make sure we're ready for the next big attack.""*

Midway through her info dump to the audience, Marlo dashed to the bus stop, panting and barely managing to hop on before the doors swished shut. She plopped into a seat and continued her narrative, *""And here's the cool part. The city's been using all this new tech the school has been creating to rebuild after the whole big fish -thing. Skyscrapers are greener, cars are quieter, and the beach cleaner than ever. Oh, and the monorail! Who doesn't love a good monorail?""* She smirked at a young child staring at her, clearly bewildered by the one-sided conversation.

*""But what's really changed around here is the cops,""* she went on, her eyes glancing out the window at the sleek police cruisers that zipped by. *""They've gone full sci-fi with energy weapons, thanks to one of the weapons the fish headed alien left behind after the battle. They've got these stun-batons that can fry a bad guy's circuits without breaking the skin, and I've heard whispers about a secret project with the military. They're crafting some kind of ray gun that could take out a sea monster with one shot.""*

Marlo's monologue was soon interrupted by the bus's jolting stop at the university's gates.     
*“Sorry I can’t info dump more on you, I gotta go, or else I’ll be late for class!”*     
She leapt off, her sneakers slapping the pavement as she sprinted towards the modern, gleaming buildings of Santa Monica Tech. The campus was a bustling hub of young, bright minds, all eager to leave their mark on the world. As she wove through the throngs of students, she couldn't help but bump into a few of the ""smarty-pants"" types, their brains packed fuller than their overstuffed backpacks. The bumping cause one smart srudents glasses to fall out of his pocket onto the floor.

Spotting them, she bent down to return them, but the kid was nowhere in sight. *""Well, shoot,""* she murmured, tucking the spectacles into her pocket. *""Looks like I've got a new accessory for the day.""* With a shrug, she straightened up and sprinted towards her building, the clock ticking down.

Marlo burst into her first class, huffing and puffing, just as the professor announced, *""Alright, everyone, settle down. We're starting with a surprise pop quiz!""* A collective groan filled the room, and she couldn't help but feel a twinge of dread. It was her least favorite thing in the world—math class. She slid into her seat, panting, and took a deep breath.

As the quiz began, she took out her borrowed glasses and put them on, hoping they'd help her focus. But as soon as her eyes met the first question, she felt an itch in her brain. The cloxk ticked in the classroom as time went by, but slowly Marlo was figuring out the answers. The itch continued as more and more information filled her brain. She looked down at the paper and knew all the answers. As she weote them out, ahe found herself “remembering” other things, like the answers to a physics test, how to play chess and for some reason that she like Star Trek? Once she finished the quiz, she took the glasses off ans rubbed her eyes. What the heck was going on?

After class, the rest of the day was like a blurr and Marlo made sure not to put the glasses on, though she did inspect them. They werent special, just some wire-frame glasses. Maybe something was wrong with her, so she experimented. Throughout the day, she nabbed a couple peoples pencils, books, and even someone keys, before heading back home to grandmas house. She’d return all of it, eventually.

Once home, she bolted upstairs and laid out her loot from the day. With trembling hands, she picked up each item, holding it tightly, hoping for the strange phenomenon to happen again. But nothing did. Just the feeling of cold, inanimate objects in her palms. Then she grabbed the keys, feeling the weight and coldness of the metal, and held them for a full minute. Her eyes widened as a rush of unfamiliar information flooded her brain. It was like someone had downloaded a new software update into her head, except it wasn’t just data—it was life experiences and memories.

The keys were from a guy named Alex, she realized. Alex loved trivia nights at the local pub, had a fear of spiders, and had a secret crush on the barista at the coffee shop across from the university. He was a computer science major, and his favorite show was a obscure British sitcom from the '90s that she'd never heard of. As all this information flooded into Marlo’s noggin, a sense of fear overwhelmed her and she dropped the keys. *“Grandmaaaaaaa!”* She yelled, bolting out of her room, down to the kitchen.

Her grandma, Edna, looked up from her cooking, a wooden spoon in hand. *“What?! What? What is it?!”* She said panicking as she turned to Marlo who was panting with dread and excitement. *“I’ve got super powers!”* Marlo yelled, both fists pumped up in the air.

Edna put the spoon down and turned to face her, a knowing look in her eyes. *“Well, damn, it’s about time. Your mother had some kind of powers by the time she was 11,”* she said, her voice calm and measured, as if she'd been waiting for this moment for a very long time.

Marlo stared at her, dumbfounded. ""What do you mean? Superpowers? In our family?""

Her grandmother nodded, a hint of amusement in her eyes. *""It's the Haddock genes, sweetheart. They're a bit quirky, and no one power is the same. Your great grandfather had’em, I gott’em, your mother had’em, and now so do you, just dont go showing them off…..Oh! Speaking of the Haddock genes, your little cousin is going to be staying with us for a while.”*

Marlo blinked, trying to process the sudden turn of conversation. *“Cousin? What cousin?”*

Edna wiped her hands on her apron, and headed into the living room. *“You know, Guppy, your cousin? Your late uncle’s kid.”*

Marlo peeked her head into the room. *“Wait, what uncle?”*

She felt a sudden jolt as the lyrics of ""Mighty Mosasaur"" echoed in her head. With a gasp, she bolted upright, realizing she was late for her first class at Santa Monica Tech. The clock on her nightstand read 8:45 AM, and she had exactly fifteen minutes to get to campus.

Her grandmother, Edna, popped her head in, a knowing smile on her face. *""Marlo, you're gonna miss the bus again,”* she said with a knowing shake of her head.

Marlo rolled her eyes and mumbled, *""Thanks, Gran, I'm aware,""* as she flew into action. She knew the drill—shove textbooks into her backpack, throw on yesterday's jeans, and grab a banana on the way out.    
*“Oh before I forget, I need…”* Edna started to say, but was cut off.    
*“I’dlovetostayandchat,butIgottagonow,loveyoubye!”* Marlo said as she raced out the door, not before taking a moment to glance back at the framed poster of the Mighty Mosasaur that hung proudly on her bedroom wall.      
*""So, let's talk about this guy,""* she said, addressing the invisible audience. 

*""The Mighty Mosasaur was like, the biggest hero Santa Monica ever had. He fought off that crazy alien Fishman and his giant mutated shark, basically saving our butts. No one knows if he survives, so the city decided to build this fancy-schmancy tech school, Santa Monica Tech, Go Gulls! SQUAAAAWK!, to honor him and make sure we're ready for the next big attack.""*

Midway through her info dump to the audience, Marlo dashed to the bus stop, panting and barely managing to hop on before the doors swished shut. She plopped into a seat and continued her narrative, *""And here's the cool part. The city's been using all this new tech the school has been creating to rebuild after the whole big fish -thing. Skyscrapers are greener, cars are quieter, and the beach cleaner than ever. Oh, and the monorail! Who doesn't love a good monorail?""* She smirked at a young child staring at her, clearly bewildered by the one-sided conversation.

*""But what's really changed around here is the cops,""* she went on, her eyes glancing out the window at the sleek police cruisers that zipped by. *""They've gone full sci-fi with energy weapons, thanks to one of the weapons the fish headed alien left behind after the battle. They've got these stun-batons that can fry a bad guy's circuits without breaking the skin, and I've heard whispers about a secret project with the military. They're crafting some kind of ray gun that could take out a sea monster with one shot.""*

Marlo's monologue was soon interrupted by the bus's jolting stop at the university's gates.     
*“Sorry I can’t info dump more on you, I gotta go, or else I’ll be late for class!”*     
She leapt off, her sneakers slapping the pavement as she sprinted towards the modern, gleaming buildings of Santa Monica Tech. The campus was a bustling hub of young, bright minds, all eager to leave their mark on the world. As she wove through the throngs of students, she couldn't help but bump into a few of the ""smarty-pants"" types, their brains packed fuller than their overstuffed backpacks. The bumping cause one smart srudents glasses to fall out of his pocket onto the floor.

Spotting them, she bent down to return them, but the kid was nowhere in sight. *""Well, shoot,""* she murmured, tucking the spectacles into her pocket. *""Looks like I've got a new accessory for the day.""* With a shrug, she straightened up and sprinted towards her building, the clock ticking down.

Marlo burst into her first class, huffing and puffing, just as the professor announced, *""Alright, everyone, settle down. We're starting with a surprise pop quiz!""* A collective groan filled the room, and she couldn't help but feel a twinge of dread. It was her least favorite thing in the world—math class. She slid into her seat, panting, and took a deep breath.

As the quiz began, she took out her borrowed glasses and put them on, hoping they'd help her focus. But as soon as her eyes met the first question, she felt an itch in her brain. The cloxk ticked in the classroom as time went by, but slowly Marlo was figuring out the answers. The itch continued as more and more information filled her brain. She looked down at the paper and knew all the answers. As she weote them out, ahe found herself “remembering” other things, like the answers to a physics test, how to play chess and for some reason that she like Star Trek? Once she finished the quiz, she took the glasses off ans rubbed her eyes. What the heck was going on?

After class, the rest of the day was like a blurr and Marlo made sure not to put the glasses on, though she did inspect them. They werent special, just some wire-frame glasses. Maybe something was wrong with her, so she experimented. Throughout the day, she nabbed a couple peoples pencils, books, and even someone keys, before heading back home to grandmas house. She’d return all of it, eventually.

Once home, she bolted upstairs and laid out her loot from the day. With trembling hands, she picked up each item, holding it tightly, hoping for the strange phenomenon to happen again. But nothing did. Just the feeling of cold, inanimate objects in her palms. Then she grabbed the keys, feeling the weight and coldness of the metal, and held them for a full minute. Her eyes widened as a rush of unfamiliar information flooded her brain. It was like someone had downloaded a new software update into her head, except it wasn’t just data—it was life experiences and memories.

The keys were from a guy named Alex, she realized. Alex loved trivia nights at the local pub, had a fear of spiders, and had a secret crush on the barista at the coffee shop across from the university. He was a computer science major, and his favorite show was a obscure British sitcom from the '90s that she'd never heard of. As all this information flooded into Marlo’s noggin, a sense of fear overwhelmed her and she dropped the keys. *“Grandmaaaaaaa!”* She yelled, bolting out of her room, down to the kitchen.

Her grandma, Edna, looked up from her cooking, a wooden spoon in hand. *“What?! What? What is it?!”* She said panicking as she turned to Marlo who was panting with dread and excitement. *“I’ve got super powers!”* Marlo yelled, both fists pumped up in the air.

Edna put the spoon down and turned to face her, a knowing look in her eyes. *“Well, damn, it’s about time. Your mother had some kind of powers by the time she was 11,”* she said, her voice calm and measured, as if she'd been waiting for this moment for a very long time.

Marlo stared at her, dumbfounded. ""What do you mean? Superpowers? In our family?""

Her grandmother nodded, a hint of amusement in her eyes. *""It's the Haddock genes, sweetheart. They're a bit quirky, and no one power is the same. Your great grandfather had’em, I gott’em, your mother had’em, and now so do you, just dont go showing them off…..Oh! Speaking of the Haddock genes, your little cousin is going to be staying with us for a while.”*

Marlo blinked, trying to process the sudden turn of conversation. *“Cousin? What cousin?”*

Edna wiped her hands on her apron, and headed into the living room. *“You know, Guppy, your cousin? Your late uncle’s kid.”*

Marlo peeked her head into the room. *“Wait, what uncle?”*

""Wait did you just say the kids are mine?"" Daniel asked. ""Yes sir, DNA confirms it"" Detective Brown replied. Daniel stated. ""Wait two children? How?"" Daniel asked. ""They are twins, they are three years old and currently are in hospital. As I mentioned we found them in a dope raid and I don't want them going back into foster care, I'd rather they be placed up for adoption"" Detective Brown stated. ""No, wait. I didn't know about them. I'll take my kids. I'll be on the first flight out of Australia. Send me through the details"" Daniel replied. ""Yes sir, and sir you should know they show signs of abuse"" Detective Brown stated they continued to talk with the detective passing on relevant information before hanging up. Daniel was horrified, how was he going to tell his sons?
—
Daniel was sound asleep, it was 3 am when his phone began to ring with a number from LA. ""This better be good"" he answered the phone. ""Is this Mr Daniel Toms?"" Detective Brown asked. ""Who is asking?"" Daniel replied. ""Oh sorry, my name is Detective Brown. I am calling in regards to your children we found late last night in a dope raid"" Detective Brown started. ""I think you have the wrong number mate. My kids are here in Australia with me"" Daniel replied getting angry. ""No, you are Daniel Levi Toms correct?"" Detective Brown asked"" ""Yes"" Daniel replied. ""Then I have the right number. You are listed on the birth certificate of Dakota and Darcy born 16th April 2019, mother Kelly Wright now deceased"" Detective Brown continued. ""Look mate, I'm not the kid's father. There has been a mistake"" Daniel replied. ""Well as you are listed you are the next of kin and I will need you to provide a DNA sample to get your name removed off the birth certificate or you will need to sign paperwork relinquishing your rights so the children can be placed up for adoption"" Detective Brown fumed out. He was angry at this man for denying his children, especially after seeing them in the state they were in. Those kids deserved better than that. ""Where can I go to provide the sample?"" Daniel asked. 
After another 10 minutes on the phone organising for Daniel to provide a sample of DNA in the morning the detective and Daniel hung up. He was now wide awake and fuming with Kelly. Why would she put his name down? They had spent two weeks together but had parted ways after a mutually satisfying time together. There is no way he could have fathered children with her, he was sure they were careful. He was awake now so decided to do some work before going to the clinic at 8 am to get a DNA test done.
At 7.30 am Daniel left a note for his sons saying he had an errand to run and headed to the clinic. He would then head to the office after the test was done. The detective said they would have the results in two days and then Daniel would be absolved of the responsibility of the children that Kelly claimed were his. He already had four children he had raised practically on his own that were grown, he didn't need to raise another two especially when he would be 50 in a few years. 
The twins had been admitted to hospital and would be spending about 10 days there. They had school sores all over them from how unclean they were. Darcy had a UTI from not being cleaned properly after going to the toilet. They both had insect bites all over them. Dakota had a skin infection and multiple bruises on his body. Darcy also had a middle ear infection. Both children slept a lot but neither would let go of each other. Dakota had to be held down while the doctors checked his sister because he kept kicking and biting the doctor. Each time the nurse would come to check the twin's vitals it took three of them, two to hold Dakota and one to check Darcy. Dakota had also taken out his IV several times so he could sleep with Darcy. The nurses had threatened to put the kids in different rooms unless he kept his IV in. 
Two days later Detective Brown got a call confirming that Daniel was the biological father of the twins. He immediately picked up the phone to call Daniel. ""Daniel speaking"" Daniel answered the phone quickly seeing the LA number. He assumed it was the start of getting his name off the kid's birthday certificate. ""Daniel, this is Detective Brown. I am ringing to confirm you are the father of Dakota and Darcy. I have sent the paperwork through for you to see along with forms allowing the children to be placed up for adoption. As Ms Wright is now deceased, all we require is your signature and we can get the process started"" Detective Brown stated. ""Wait did you just say the kids are mine?"" Daniel asked. ""Yes sir, DNA confirms it"" Detective Brown replied. Daniel stated. ""Wait two children? How?"" Daniel asked. ""They are twins, they are three years old and currently are in hospital. As I mentioned we found them in a dope raid and I don't want them going back into foster care, I'd rather they be placed up for adoption"" Detective Brown stated. ""No, wait. I didn't know about them. I'll take my kids. I'll be on the first flight out of Australia. Send me through the details"" Daniel replied. ""Yes sir, and sir you should know they show signs of abuse"" Detective Brown stated they continued to talk with the detective passing on relevant information before hanging up. Daniel was horrified, how was he going to tell his sons?
Daniel booked the first flight from Sydney to LA for himself and his eldest. He knew he would need help getting two children back especially when they had shown signs of abuse. He had forgotten to ask about the gender of his children, he assumed they were two boys. He didn't know what abuse the children had suffered but he knew they were in a dope raid. These are the things he would have to find out as well as getting the children back to Australia. 
He rang Mitchell and told him they both needed to get to LA immediately and to pack a bag for the both of them with at least 10 days worth of clothes. He would explain on the way to the airport. He called his other sons and told them he and Mitchell would be heading to LA for two weeks immediately for an emergency and to get home quickly so he could explain it all. Their flight was leaving at 7.30 pm and it was currently 1 pm. It would only take 20 minutes to drive to the airport from their house. He was worried about what his sons were going to say about having siblings. He got into a cab as he wanted to read the things that the detective had sent and his car would be fine in the work car park. As he read through the reports he realised he had a little boy and a little girl. Finally, he would have a little princess to spoil and he couldn't help but smile. 
As he walked into the house he was met with all his sons. ""Dad, what's the emergency?"" His eldest Mitchell asked. ""A few days ago, I got a call from a detective in LA claiming I had fathered two children. Turns out he was right, I have the DNA results. Before anyone says anything, they are twins and are three. I am going to America to bring them back home. Their mum is deceased and we are all they have left"" Daniel stated not leaving any room for arguing. ""What? How?"" Asked Eddie the youngest. ""You see brother dear when a man and a woman"" Hunter began. ""Shut up, I meant how did we not know?"" Eddie argued. ""Their mother didn't let me know. I spent 2 weeks with her in China, she was my guide and translator. We both knew it was casual"" Daniel replied. He wanted to be honest with his sons so they knew exactly what was going on, he always had been honest. ""That's not all. The twins, Dakota and Darcy are currently in hospital. They are showing signs of abuse. The police picked them up during a dope raid"" Daniel informed his sons. 
Everyone was quiet for a while, no one knew what to say at all. How could someone harm children? Why would someone want to do that? Eventually, Jamie spoke up ""Do you have a photo of them?"" He asked making Daniel smile. The detective had sent through a picture of the children with the file which could be used to get emergency passports to get the kids home to Australia. Daniel pulled up the photos and the boys gathered around the phone to look. First, they saw a photo of Dakota, there was no denying him, he was the spitting image of Mitchell. You would swear they were twins. Mitchell and Dakota shared the same blue eyes and blonde curly hair. They even had the same face shape although Dakota did not have the fullness in his cheeks. 
Once everyone had looked at Dakota, Daniel pulled up the photo of Darcy. The boys gasped, they were not expecting to have a baby sister at all. ""She is gorgeous and so tiny"" Hunter stated. ""Look at her button nose and those eyes"" Jamie stated. ""I bags cuddling her first"" Eddie yelled. ""We are in so much trouble, when she grows up, the boys will swarm"" Mitchell grumbled causing all the boys to glare. They had not thought of that. Daniel chuckled at his sons, they hadn't even met the kids and they were already so protective of their baby sister. ""Anyway, Mitchell and I are heading to LA tonight and when the twins are released from hospital we will bring them home. 
""That's not fair. Why does he get to go?"" Jamie whined. ""I don't want to overwhelm the twins but I will need help to bring them home. You all are at uni and I don't want you taking the time off"" Daniel replied earning groans from all of his sons besides Mitchell. Daniel spent the rest of the time organising emergency passports for the twins so they could return to Australia. He would pick them up from the Australian embassy in 5 days along with paperwork allowing the twins to be brought into the country. 
Mitchell checked them into the flight online so all they would have to do is drop their bags and head through security. He was extremely excited to meet the twins and couldn't wait to cuddle with both of them. He missed having younger siblings in the house. He had plans for what he would do with each of the twins. He would teach Dakota how to play football and ride a bike, he would also read to him and teach him how to protect his sister. He could not wait to teach Darcy to ride a bike and would cuddle with her to sleep. He would take her dancing and go watch every performance if she was interested. It was time to leave and they caught a cab to the airport ready to get to LA to see the twins. 
Mitchell and Daniel had been quiet since arriving at the airport waiting for their flight to be called. They were travelling first class so they would be able to sleep on the plane. Both were lost in their own thoughts after reading medical reports from the hospital. As they boarded the flight all Daniel could think of was how he was going to be able to help his children when they were showing signs of abuse. How would he be able to get them to trust him when he already had let them down? How could he make up for the time he had already missed with his children? But most of all he was worried the twins would not like him.
After dumping their bags and changing at the hotel, Daniel and Mitchell were off to the hospital both nervous about how the twins would react to them. ""What if they are scared of us?"" Mitchell asked his father. ""We will have to show them that they are safe with us. They will have trust issues and it will take time but they will come around. Once we are home we will get them to see someone to help"" Daniel replied firmly. He had to believe his children would be ok and he had to be strong for all his kids. They all relied on him and he didn't plan to let anyone down. 
As they pulled up at the hospital there was a little gift shop at the entrance which Daniel and Mitchell stopped at. Mitchell wanted to buy a little gift for each of his new siblings and also grab some food for them all. Hospital food sucked so he was hoping to buy some fruit and maybe something edible for them all. Daniel wanted to grab coffee for himself, he needed to stay awake and learn everything about his youngest children. Mitchell picked out a Dumbo teddy and a Woody teddy for the twins, he also grabbed drinks for everyone, fruit, chips and a few sandwiches which should last them the day. He would go down the road to iHop and grab takeaway for them all for dinner later. 
Daniel and Mitchell made their way to the room the twins were staying in. Detective Brown was going to meet them at the foyer in a few minutes so he could introduce Daniel to his children and then the paperwork would be signed so Daniel took custody of his children. Then when they were released from the hospital and cleared to fly he could take them home to Australia to meet the rest of his family. As they got to the foyer they heard some nurses talking about having to deal with the devil twins and he was annoyed, no one should talk about children like that. He decided to follow the nurses. He had a feeling they were talking about his children. 
As he got to the room where the ""devil children"" the nurses were talking about were, he heard screaming and saw two nurses holding down his little boy. Daniel was furious and rushed into the room ""Let him go now"" Daniel yelled scaring Darcy who was crying. The nurses looked at Daniel who looked ready to kill. ""We have to hold him down to check his sister. He loses it and won't let us do our job"" one of the nurses tried to explain. ""I said let go of my son now"" he bellowed causing the nurses to let him go immediately. Dakota kicked one of the nurses in the shins and ran over to Darcy trying to climb onto the bed where she was crying. Mitchell came running into the room with Detective Brown following him, they had been introducing themselves when they heard Daniel screaming. ""Dad, what's happened?"" Mitchell asked scanning the room and seeing three nurses all staring at Daniel looking scared. 
Detective Brown saw Dakota trying to get to his sister and went to assist him. Dakota scooped his sister into his arms once he was on the bed and glared at the nurses just like Daniel was. ""How dare you hold them both down. I want the head of the hospital here now to explain how the nurses here think it's acceptable to hold down two children who have displayed signs of abuse to treat them"" Daniel fumed out. Detective Brown swung around glaring at the nurses furious that they would do that to children who were clearly traumatised. ""We will ask you to leave"" one of the nurses smugly stated. ""I am Detective Brown and I am happy to take a statement against all of you for child abuse. Get another nurse who can do their job or a doctor now"" Detective Brown stated causing the younger nurse to nod her head at him. 
Dakota was holding his sister, protecting her with his body in case anyone tried to take her or hurt her again. Darcy was calming down as the nurses left the room and her brother was holding her. She was listening to his heartbeat which always made her calm. ""Hey there, I want to introduce you to these people who came to help you"" Detective Brown stated. The twins knew him, he helped them and gave them food. They didn't trust him but he was the person who could at least touch Dakota without getting bitten or kicked. Dakota nodded at him and Darcy peeked out to see who he meant. ""Big Kota"" Darcy whispered well attempting to whisper when she looked at Mitchell. Daniel and Mitchell smiled at hearing her voice not knowing what she meant. ""This is your daddy and your brother Mitchell"" Detective Brown stated. 
Dakota glared at Daniel and Mitchell when they stepped closer to the bed. Dakota was still shielding his sister with his body. ""Kota, look. Big Kota and small Kota"" Darcy quietly said while pointing at Mitchell and then at Dakota. Daniel and Mitchell laughed, ""Yeah Dakota looks like Mitchell, you want to know why? Mitchell is my son and he is your brother"" Daniel spoke softly to the twins stepping closer to the bed. Darcy shook her head no. ""Big Kota, little Kota"" she repeated. Mitchell stepped closer to the bed. ""My name it's Mitchell, you can call me Mitch,"" he told his baby siblings, he just wanted to pick them both up and hold them so he reached his arms out earning a slap from Dakota ""No"" Dakota stated stopping Mitchell in his tracks.
Dakota was standing in front of his sister glaring at Mitchell who was standing there shocked that his baby brother had hit him. ""I won't hurt you or Darcy"" Mitchell whispered. Dakota was still glaring, he wouldn't trust him. Darcy pulled on Dakota's gown causing him to turn around and soften his face for his sister. ""Big Kota not scary"" Darcy whispered. ""Cc we not know"" Dakota told his sister. Mitchell and Daniel now understood what was happening, Dakota was trying to protect his sister from being hurt again. 
""Hey, I got you both something"" Mitchell stated drawing the twin's attention. He picked up the bag that held the food and the teddies and took out the two teddies. Darcy's eyes lit up seeing the teddies, she never had one in her life but liked the look of them. ""Darcy I got you Dumbo the elephant and Dakota I got you Woody"" Mitchell stated handing the twins the teddies. ""Ellie, Woody"" Darcy squealed. ""Look Kota, Ellie and Woody fwends"" Darcy stated causing Dakota to smile at his sister as well as Daniel, Mitchell and Detective Brown. ""Ta big Kota"" Darcy smiled. 
Darcy was cuddling the elephant while Dakota still was protecting her watching Mitchell who was still next to the bed. Detective Brown and Daniel were sorting out the paperwork but Daniel continued to look at his youngest children wanting to learn everything about them. Darcy stood on the bed and stepped closer to Mitchell. She turned her head to the side studying his face and then looking at Dakota. ""Cc no,"" Dakota told his sister, he was scared that Big Kota would hurt his sister. Mitchell kept still wanting to see what Darcy would do. Darcy poked his cheek quickly then covered her head with her arms while peeking at Mitchell. Dakota stood with his sister ready to protect her if big Kota lashed out. Mitchell smiled at the both of them which seemed to relax Darcy a little because she dropped her hands and studied his face again. Darcy poked his cheek again and watched as Mitchell laughed at his sister. 
Daniel and Detective Brown watched on as Darcy continued to poke Mitchell's cheek and study his face then look at her twin. Daniel smiled, his twins were slowly engaging with them and he couldn't be happier. He wanted to go over and speak to them but needed the paperwork done. Darcy put her hand on Mitchell's cheek and smiled at him ""Scratchy"" she whispered before putting her other hand on Dakota's cheek and whispering ""soft"". Dakota smiled at his sister and leaned into her hand. That was the only comfort both twins had gotten in their entire life. 
Mitchell raised his hands slowly causing both twins to slightly flinch. He slowly put his hand on Darcy's face and the other on Dakota's face. Both twins froze closing their eyes, waiting for the sting but it didn't come. Mitchell frowned when he saw the twin's reaction to his hand but then whispered ""Soft"" causing both twins to slowly open their eyes and look at him. Mitchell smiled at the twins showing them he wasn't going to hurt them. ""I'll never hurt either of you and I won't let anyone else"" Mitchell whispered to his siblings. 
The doctor walked into the room quickly looking for the people who demanded his presence along with the nurse in charge. The sound caused the twins to flinch and Dakota to cover Darcy with his body. Darcy used the teddy to shield herself and wrapped her arms around Dakota. ""What's the problem here?"" The doctor asked aggressively. ""Your nurses were holding down my children when I walked in. These children show signs of child abuse and there is no way any nurse should be forcefully holding them down to treat them"" Daniel spat out. ""My nurses are protecting themselves from those devils. That boy has bitten several of my nurses and kicked them. I won't risk my staff at all"" the nurse in charge replied. The doctor glared at the nurse, there was no way the nurses should be pinning down a patient especially not children who had been abused. ""Have you tried talking to them?"" The doctor asked. ""We don't have time, we need to do our rounds and get them treated quickly"" the nurse responded. ""What needs doing?"" Daniel asked. ""We need to check her ear, and his back,"" the nurse said pointing at the twins who were still clinging to each other. Mitchell was speaking to the twins trying to calm them down. 
""Hey Dakota, I won't let anyone hurt Darcy if you let the doctor check your back and Darcy, you let them check your ear then we can have something to eat. I brought some snacks"" Mitchell spoke gently to the twins. ""Food?"" Darcy asked. Daniel picked up the bag with all the food in it and placed it on the bed near where the twins were standing holding onto each other. ""Yeah, you can pick something from the bag to eat. Mitch and I will hold your hand while the doctor checks you out if you like"" Daniel spoke gently to his children. 
Darcy and Dakota spoke to each other in gibberish but they seemed to understand each other. The only thing the others understood was Kota and Cc. The twins agreed to the terms as long as Daniel and Mitchell held their hands. ""Doctor, no her"" Dakota spoke firmly pointing at the nurse. She had held the twins down before and neither of them liked her. ""Ok the doctor will check you both and Mitchell and I will hold your hand"" Daniel replied. ""Kota hold Cc hand"" Dakota told his father. ""Ok you can hold Cc's hand and I'll hold her other hand"" Daniel told his youngest son. ""My Cc you Darcy"" Dakota glared at his father causing everyone to chuckle. ""Ok I won't call her Cc, I'll call her Darcy"" Daniel laughed at his son earning a nod from Dakota. 
Daniel held onto Darcy's little hand while Dakota held onto the other. The doctor checked in her ear seeing the infection was clearing but she would require more antibiotics and wouldn't be able to fly for at least a week before moving on to check on Dakota's back. Dakota needed more cream on his back but it was healing well. ""Ok good news, they are both healing and can be discharged today with oral antibiotics. Dakota will need cream applied three times a day on his back and his skin needs to stay clean and dry. Darcy still has an ear infection and won't be able to fly for about a week. When she does though, she may have pressure in her ear. Give her a sweet to suck and some paracetamol. Other than that, if you are happy to take them with you, they can leave today"" the doctor stated. ""That would be great, we are waiting for the passports to come through anyway"" Daniel replied. ""Great, I'll get the papers organised and the medicine for the week. I would suggest you get them checked when you get back to Australia. Also, small meals often is best for them due to the malnourishment"" the doctor added before leaving the room. ""Well we better go get some clothes for them"" Daniel stated ""Dad I'll get them you stay here"" Mitchell offered. Daniel nodded handing Mitchell his credit card. Detective Brown said his goodbyes and offered to give Mitchell a lift to the target which was around the corner.

Our story starts with Marlo Haddock, a simple girl who is…who is… gonna be late for school! Marlo lay sprawled on her bed, the room bathed in the soft glow of early morning sunlight, her lips moving to the rhythm of a cartoon theme song playing in her mind. She felt a sudden jolt as the lyrics of ""Mighty Mosasaur"" echoed in her head. With a gasp, she bolted upright, realizing she was late for her first class at Santa Monica Tech. The clock on her nightstand read 8:45 AM, and she had exactly fifteen minutes to get to campus.

Her grandmother, Edna, popped her head in, a knowing smile on her face. *""Marlo, you're gonna miss the bus again,”* she said with a knowing shake of her head.

Marlo rolled her eyes and mumbled, *""Thanks, Gran, I'm aware,""* as she flew into action. She knew the drill—shove textbooks into her backpack, throw on yesterday's jeans, and grab a banana on the way out.    
*“Oh before I forget, I need…”* Edna started to say, but was cut off.    
*“I’dlovetostayandchat,butIgottagonow,loveyoubye!”* Marlo said as she raced out the door, not before taking a moment to glance back at the framed poster of the Mighty Mosasaur that hung proudly on her bedroom wall.      
*""So, let's talk about this guy,""* she said, addressing the invisible audience. 

*""The Mighty Mosasaur was like, the biggest hero Santa Monica ever had. He fought off that crazy alien Fishman and his giant mutated shark, basically saving our butts. No one knows if he survives, so the city decided to build this fancy-schmancy tech school, Santa Monica Tech, Go Gulls! SQUAAAAWK!, to honor him and make sure we're ready for the next big attack.""*

Midway through her info dump to the audience, Marlo dashed to the bus stop, panting and barely managing to hop on before the doors swished shut. She plopped into a seat and continued her narrative, *""And here's the cool part. The city's been using all this new tech the school has been creating to rebuild after the whole big fish -thing. Skyscrapers are greener, cars are quieter, and the beach cleaner than ever. Oh, and the monorail! Who doesn't love a good monorail?""* She smirked at a young child staring at her, clearly bewildered by the one-sided conversation.

*""But what's really changed around here is the cops,""* she went on, her eyes glancing out the window at the sleek police cruisers that zipped by. *""They've gone full sci-fi with energy weapons, thanks to one of the weapons the fish headed alien left behind after the battle. They've got these stun-batons that can fry a bad guy's circuits without breaking the skin, and I've heard whispers about a secret project with the military. They're crafting some kind of ray gun that could take out a sea monster with one shot.""*

Marlo's monologue was soon interrupted by the bus's jolting stop at the university's gates.     
*“Sorry I can’t info dump more on you, I gotta go, or else I’ll be late for class!”*     
She leapt off, her sneakers slapping the pavement as she sprinted towards the modern, gleaming buildings of Santa Monica Tech. The campus was a bustling hub of young, bright minds, all eager to leave their mark on the world. As she wove through the throngs of students, she couldn't help but bump into a few of the ""smarty-pants"" types, their brains packed fuller than their overstuffed backpacks. The bumping cause one smart srudents glasses to fall out of his pocket onto the floor.

Spotting them, she bent down to return them, but the kid was nowhere in sight. *""Well, shoot,""* she murmured, tucking the spectacles into her pocket. *""Looks like I've got a new accessory for the day.""* With a shrug, she straightened up and sprinted towards her building, the clock ticking down.

Marlo burst into her first class, huffing and puffing, just as the professor announced, *""Alright, everyone, settle down. We're starting with a surprise pop quiz!""* A collective groan filled the room, and she couldn't help but feel a twinge of dread. It was her least favorite thing in the world—math class. She slid into her seat, panting, and took a deep breath.

As the quiz began, she took out her borrowed glasses and put them on, hoping they'd help her focus. But as soon as her eyes met the first question, she felt an itch in her brain. The cloxk ticked in the classroom as time went by, but slowly Marlo was figuring out the answers. The itch continued as more and more information filled her brain. She looked down at the paper and knew all the answers. As she weote them out, ahe found herself “remembering” other things, like the answers to a physics test, how to play chess and for some reason that she like Star Trek? Once she finished the quiz, she took the glasses off ans rubbed her eyes. What the heck was going on?

After class, the rest of the day was like a blurr and Marlo made sure not to put the glasses on, though she did inspect them. They werent special, just some wire-frame glasses. Maybe something was wrong with her, so she experimented. Throughout the day, she nabbed a couple peoples pencils, books, and even someone keys, before heading back home to grandmas house. She’d return all of it, eventually.

Once home, she bolted upstairs and laid out her loot from the day. With trembling hands, she picked up each item, holding it tightly, hoping for the strange phenomenon to happen again. But nothing did. Just the feeling of cold, inanimate objects in her palms. Then she grabbed the keys, feeling the weight and coldness of the metal, and held them for a full minute. Her eyes widened as a rush of unfamiliar information flooded her brain. It was like someone had downloaded a new software update into her head, except it wasn’t just data—it was life experiences and memories.

The keys were from a guy named Alex, she realized. Alex loved trivia nights at the local pub, had a fear of spiders, and had a secret crush on the barista at the coffee shop across from the university. He was a computer science major, and his favorite show was a obscure British sitcom from the '90s that she'd never heard of. As all this information flooded into Marlo’s noggin, a sense of fear overwhelmed her and she dropped the keys. *“Grandmaaaaaaa!”* She yelled, bolting out of her room, down to the kitchen.

Her grandma, Edna, looked up from her cooking, a wooden spoon in hand. *“What?! What? What is it?!”* She said panicking as she turned to Marlo who was panting with dread and excitement. *“I’ve got super powers!”* Marlo yelled, both fists pumped up in the air.

Edna put the spoon down and turned to face her, a knowing look in her eyes. *“Well, damn, it’s about time. Your mother had some kind of powers by the time she was 11,”* she said, her voice calm and measured, as if she'd been waiting for this moment for a very long time.

Marlo stared at her, dumbfounded. ""What do you mean? Superpowers? In our family?""

Her grandmother nodded, a hint of amusement in her eyes. *""It's the Haddock genes, sweetheart. They're a bit quirky, and no one power is the same. Your great grandfather had’em, I gott’em, your mother had’em, and now so do you, just dont go showing them off…..Oh! Speaking of the Haddock genes, your little cousin is going to be staying with us for a while.”*

Marlo blinked, trying to process the sudden turn of conversation. *“Cousin? What cousin?”*

Edna wiped her hands on her apron, and headed into the living room. *“You know, Guppy, your cousin? Your late uncle’s kid.”*

Marlo peeked her head into the room. *“Wait, what uncle?”*

There's a strange kind of silence that follows a hard season.
Not the peaceful kind—more like the now what? kind.
 
The dust settles. The people move on.
You've cried the tears. You've weathered the storm.
 
And now you're standing in the middle of it all—exhausted, unsure, and quietly hoping…that maybe you can start again.
 
But where do you even begin?
What if you don't feel strong enough?
What if you fail again?
 
I get it. Starting over isn't easy. It takes humility to say, “God, I can't fix what was… but I'm willing to step into what's next.” It takes courage to try again when the past still echoes.
 
But friend, listen—you are not the same person who broke.
You've grown in the silence.
You've learned through the loss.
You've healed in ways no one sees.
 
And God?
He's not asking you to have it all figured out before you move forward.
He's simply asking for your yes.
Yes, to trying again.
Yes, to believing again.
Yes, to building again—brick by brick, breath by breath, one faithful step at a time.
 
Don't let the fear of failure hold you hostage.
Don't let regret convince you you're too far gone.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

<div>Owning a septic system means you have a crucial responsibility to keep it in good shape. A neglected septic tank can lead to problems that might cost you thousands of dollars—sometimes even $10,000 or more. However, regular maintenance can protect you from facing such expensive repair bills. Knowing what to do and when to do it makes all the difference in keeping your septic system healthy and your wallet intact.

### Understanding Why Septic Maintenance Matters

Your septic system is an underground wastewater treatment structure, commonly used in rural areas without centralized sewer systems. It collects wastewater, separates solids from liquids, and allows safe decomposition of waste. When this system works well, it saves you from costly plumbing emergencies. But if you ignore regular upkeep, things like blockages, leaks, or even tank failures can occur, leading to massive repair bills.

### Routine Pumping: The Key to Avoiding Costly Repairs

One of the best ways to prevent a $10,000 septic repair bill is scheduling regular septic tank pumping. Over time, solids build up in the tank, and if they aren’t removed, they can clog drain fields or damage the tank itself.

- **Frequency:** Generally, experts recommend pumping every 3 to 5 years, but this can vary depending on tank size, household size, and water usage.
- **Signs it’s time to pump:** Slow drains, bad odors around your yard, or sewage backups inside your home.
 
Ignoring these signs means risking system failure, which often leads to expensive excavation and replacement work.

### Protect the Drain Field by Avoiding Harmful Practices

The drain field is where treated wastewater is absorbed into the soil. Maintaining it requires mindful habits:

- **Don’t overload the system:** Excessive water from washing machines, dishwashers, or long showers can flood the drain field.
- **Avoid planting trees or shrubs near the drain field:** Roots can infiltrate and damage pipes, causing blockages or leaks.
- **Keep heavy vehicles off the drain field:** Driving or parking can compress the soil and damage the pipes below.
 
### What to Flush: Protect Your System from Damage

Many septic system problems happen because people flush or drain items that don’t belong. You can prevent costly repairs by following these guidelines:

- Never flush grease, oils, or coffee grounds—these clog pipes and kill beneficial bacteria.
- Avoid harsh chemicals and antibacterial soaps, which disrupt the natural breakdown process in the tank.
- Dispose of diapers, feminine hygiene products, wipes, and large amounts of paper towels in the trash, not the toilet.
 
### Regular Inspections Help Spot Problems Early

Even if your system seems fine, a professional septic inspection at least once every three years is a smart move. Inspectors check the tank, pump, and drain field for leaks, blockages, or damage that could escalate if ignored. Finding and fixing these issues early might cost a few hundred dollars but can prevent catastrophic failures that climb into the thousands.

### Mind Your Water Usage

Conserving water reduces stress on your septic system, extending its lifespan and preventing breakdown. Consider these tips:

- Fix leaks promptly—dripping faucets or toilets waste gallons of water.
- Use water-efficient fixtures in bathrooms and kitchens.
- Spread out laundry loads through the week instead of doing many loads in a single day.
 
Less water means less chance of overwhelming your septic tank and drain field.

### Don’t Delay Repairs or Maintenance

If any sign of septic trouble appears—such as foul odors, pooling water, or slow draining—take immediate action. Delaying a minor repair can transform into a costly emergency later.

Hiring a professional promptly to assess and fix issues keeps your system functional, protects your property, and saves you from steep expenses that might even reach $10,000 or more.

By following these steps—regular pumping, protecting the drain field, flushing only safe materials, keeping an eye on water use, and scheduling inspections—you’re doing everything you can to keep your septic system running smoothly. These simple yet effective practices help prevent major failures and the crushing financial burden that comes with them. Remember, a little attention now can save you thousands down the road.

</div>Common Septic System Mistakes That Lead to Costly Repairs and How to Avoid Them
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div>### Recognizing Septic System Mistakes That Wreck Your Wallet

Your septic system plays a vital role in managing wastewater safely and efficiently in your home. Yet, many homeowners unknowingly make errors that lead to clogged tanks, failed drain fields, and ultimately, a hefty **$10,000 septic repair bill** or more. Understanding these common pitfalls is the first step in preventing costly damage and keeping your system running smoothly for years.

### Flushing the Wrong Things

One of the biggest mistakes homeowners make is flushing non-biodegradable or harmful materials down their toilets or drains. Items like baby wipes, feminine hygiene products, cotton swabs, dental floss, and even grease can seriously disrupt the balance of bacteria that break down waste in your septic tank. These materials don’t decompose easily and can cause blockages or damage your system’s delicate components.

**Smart Habit:** Only flush human waste and toilet paper specifically designed to break down quickly. Dispose of other materials in trash bins rather than the plumbing.

### Neglecting Regular Pumping and Inspections

Septic tanks need to be pumped every 3 to 5 years depending on usage and tank size, but many households delay this essential service. When solid waste builds up too much, it can overflow or clog the outlet pipe leading to soil absorption areas, which can be very costly to repair. Similarly, skipping inspections means small issues like cracks or tree root intrusion go unnoticed until they cause major damage.

**Pro Tip:** Create a maintenance schedule and stick to regular pumping and professional septic inspections to catch problems early.

### Overloading the System with Excess Water

Putting extra strain on your septic system by using excessive water in a short time can lead to system backups and drain field failure. Appliances like washing machines, dishwashers, and long showers add significant water load. When the soil absorption system becomes saturated, untreated wastewater may surface or back up, leading to expensive fixes.

**Preventive Step:** Spread out laundry loads over several days and fix any leaks promptly. Installing water-efficient fixtures also helps reduce water volume entering your septic system.

### Ignoring Landscaping Habits

Planting trees and shrubs close to your septic drain field is a hidden danger. Roots naturally seek moisture and will infiltrate pipes and tanks, causing blockages or cracks. Additionally, driving or parking vehicles over the drain field compacts the soil, reducing its ability to absorb effluent effectively.

**Landscaping Advice:**

- Keep deep-rooted plants at least 30 feet away from the septic system components.
- Only plant grass or shallow-rooted vegetation over your drain field to protect soil health.
- Avoid heavy traffic over system areas to prevent soil compaction.
 
### Disposing of Hazardous Chemicals in Drains

Household chemicals like paints, solvents, medications, and excessive amounts of bleach should never be poured down drains connected to your septic system. These substances kill the beneficial bacteria in the tank that digest waste solids. Killing this bacteria disrupts the system’s natural breakdown processes, leading to sludge build-up and potential tank failure.

**Safe Disposal:** Use community hazardous waste programs or follow local regulations for disposing of harmful chemicals responsibly.

### Ignoring Small Repairs and Early Warning Signs

When you notice slow drains, odors near your septic tank, soggy patches in your yard, or sewage backups, it’s tempting to ignore these as minor inconveniences. However, these can be early signs of septic problems. The longer you delay addressing such warning signs, the higher the chance of ending up with a major failure requiring costly repairs or even system replacement.

**Actionable Tip:** Respond quickly to unusual symptoms by contacting a septic service professional to diagnose and fix problems early.

### How Proper Care Saves Your Wallet

Preventing a massive $10,000 septic repair bill starts with daily habits and scheduled maintenance. By avoiding flushing harmful items, managing water use, protecting your system’s location, and responding promptly to issues, you’ll extend the life of your septic system while avoiding costly surprises.

Routine septic care is not just about saving money—it’s about protecting your home’s health and the environment. A well-maintained system prevents contamination of your yard and nearby groundwater, keeping your family safe and your property value intact.

### Key Practices to Remember

- Flush only human waste and toilet paper.
- Schedule septic tank pumping every 3-5 years.
- Limit water usage during peak times and fix leaks.
- Landscape wisely around septic components.
- Never pour hazardous chemicals down drains.
- Address warning signs immediately.
 
By integrating these strategies into your home maintenance routine, you can confidently avoid the stress of septic repairs that drain thousands from your budget. Protect your investment and keep your septic system working efficiently year after year.

</div>### Conclusion

Taking proactive steps to care for your septic system can save you from facing a staggering $10,000 repair bill. Regular maintenance is key—it keeps your septic tank functioning smoothly, prevents blockages, and helps detect minor issues before they become major problems. Simple routines like scheduling professional inspections every few years, pumping the tank as recommended, and avoiding flushing harmful materials down the drain create a strong defense against costly repairs.

Many expensive septic problems start from everyday mistakes. Overloading the system with too much water, planting trees too close to the drain field, or disposing of grease, wipes, and chemicals improperly can damage your system over time. By understanding these common errors and making small changes, you protect your home and your wallet. Simple habits like spreading out laundry loads, redirecting surface water away from your drain field, and using septic-safe products make a big difference.

Your septic system is an essential part of your home’s plumbing, and treating it with care reaps long-term rewards. Staying informed and committing to smart maintenance routines ensures you avoid emergency repairs and enjoy uninterrupted service. Remember, a little effort now prevents a lot of expense later. Prioritize your septic system’s health, and you’ll save thousands while enjoying peace of mind.

I have diagnosed anxiety to which I have been taking 100mg of sertraline for. Last year I was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer, but luckily it is slow growing and the crainiotomy that was performed along with chemotherapy and radiation has gotten rid of the tumor for now. Due to the chemotherapy being too strong for my body, it wiped out my white blood cell count which ended up resulting in sepsis but it is a little better now but my immunity is still low. I currently take 500mg of Carbamazepine to prevent seizuers that can occur because of the tumor/the cavity left from the tumor. I also have thalasemia minor which has never really impacted my life or energy levels in the past. 

About 8 weeks ago I fell sick with what I believed was the flu (my partner had it before me so I was waiting until I inevitably came down with it). It started with symptoms of fatigue and body aches. I was like this for a week then I developed a terrible dry cough. My doctor deduced that I had strep throat so I went on antibiotics. I was still feeling unwell with fatigue but the aches subsided. I then got my peroid for the first time in months (due to chemotherapy) and at the same time found out I had a UTI that turned into a bladder infection (I had no symptoms of the UTI so I was unaware I had one in the first place). My doctor had me on another antibiotic at the same time to treat the bladder infection but once I finished the antibiotics the aching came back the next day. I found out that I no longer had an infection or a virus anymore but I still felt like hell and didn't understand why. The doctor thought I was maybe depressed and suggested that I take a B12 vitamin and try and get more exercise. So even though I was horribly fatigued, I would get up in the morning and feel ok and have a shower and get dressed and take my dogs for a walk. I was exhausted after and would have to sleep for an hour or two and then I would feel okish. After a couple of days of this I was walking the dogs one day and I started feeling like sh*t so I immediately came home and went to bed. Since then I have been going down hill slowly. 

I have been getting body and muscle aches, extreme fatigue which is worse in the day, a constant sore throat, depression and at points, this gross toxic feeling. There was one day where I felt like I was improving and the next day I went out and did a bunch of physical things like go to the pool, walk the dogs, and grocery shopping. That night i felt that gross toxic feeling and two days later my symptoms of pain and fatigue got worse and I haven't ever felt that good again. 

After resting for 3 weeks on the couch, no shopping or house work, I was starting to feel like I was improving so I tried to do a little more and then my symptoms became worse again. This is when the sore throat came on and hasn't gone away. The pain after a week has subsided thankfully but the fatigue and sore throat is still the same. 

Lately my days consist of waking up, having a coffee or green tea in bed and scroll on my phone while vaping (which is know, doesn't help). Then after an hour or two i become very fatigued again after eating breakfast and taking my medication (carbamazapine and sertraline) and vitamins (vit c, b12, mega b, turmeric, king krill, magnesium, PEA). I have to go to sleep for an hour or two. I get up around 3 in the afternoon and have a shower and lunch and then feel fatigued again after that so I have to rest on the couch for the rest of the evening. I generally feel a bit better later at night but my carbamazepine that I have to take makes me tired again so I go to sleep around 12pm or 1am. Doctors can't seam to find whats wrong with me and my radiation oncololigist, after performing a CT scan couldnt find anything there and I'm starting to lose hope.

**AITA for yelling at a 19 year old and asking for him to be fired?**

Throwaway account. I (37M) and my husband (39M) have been together 11 years. My husband owns a small bookshop and recently has hired a boy to help him. This lad (I'll call him Joe) is gay and while me and my husband very obviously have no issue with this, Joe seems to do things a lot differently to us. For context both me and my husband are Irish immigrants to London.

We grew up a 20 minutes away from each other and went to the same, very Catholic, school. We aren't exactly flamboyant or outwardly 'gay' and don't exactly do PDA since that's how we were raised. On my lunch break from work I like to visit my husband bringing him records I think he might like and his coffee. Recently however Joe has started making comments. It started small with him saying things about'queer joy' and how he loves gay couples which we didn't mind at all, in all fairness it's a fairly scary world for queer people right now and I understand seeing a happy married gay couple means a lot for a kid.

But then he started getting a little too comfortable for my liking. He started asking things like 'whose the top' and calling us the f slur jokingly. I think it's entirely inappropriate to be making those comments to his boss but my husband told me to let it go. Joe calls us the f slur a lot which I had brought up a few times telling him calmly to not do that but when he continued I learnt to let go despite my distaste for it since it didnt seem to bother my husband too much but last Wednesday I lost it. I was up by the counter when Joe came in. He immediately started blathering on about how f---y we are and while my husband chuckled awkwardly,I did not. Joe noticed this and said I was a stick in the mud and repressed.

I was trying to keep my cool until he called me 'a fenian f---t' and I lost it. For anyone who doesn't know the term 'Fenian' isnt exactly a slur or anything but it isn't exactly nice either. Me and my husband jokingly call each other fenians or paddy's from time to time if weve something particularly 'Irish' and I've never exactly viewed as a very offensive word to me but something about this English boy made me snap. I asked him if he thought that was an appropriate thing to say to his boss's partner and started shouting.

Telling him hes way out of play and if he wants to keep his job he should buck up. I left to cool down a bit and 30 minutes later got a call from my husband berating me saying that Joe was crying and that hes just a kid. I do feel really bad since hes only young but I still think he needed to be knocked down a step or two, am I the asshole?

Edit: I see a lot of people making comments about the nature of the relationship between Joe and my husband, my husband has asked Joe to stop on my behalf before but this isn't something that really bothers my husband and to be fair it's his workplace not mine.

**Comments**

**EJ\_1004**

*NTA. The ‘kid’ is 19 and is old enough to know that saying harmful remarks in front of, let alone to address your boss is not the way to go. Should you have yelled, maybe not but I can’t say I would have done any better in your position.*

*Honestly, apologize to your husband for the scene you caused, mention that as long as the kid works there you won’t be going to the book shop for favors or otherwise as he makes you uncomfortable and after today you’re sure the kid would be uncomfortable as well, let him know if you’re willing to offer the kid an apology (I wouldn’t but maybe you’re a bigger person than I am), and let him know that you don’t want one from the kid as you find his behavior and language appealing and don’t want anything from him.*

**IrmaVep21**

*Apologizing to this kid for what? He knowingly called OP names after being told not too. Apologizing will only make this idiot young man think he’s the victim as he clearly has never been held accountable for anything*

**National\_Bus\_7770**

*Saying sorry would just make him think he did nothing wrong. He’s not some clueless kid, he knew what he was saying and kept pushing it anyway. Being young isn’t an excuse to be disrespectful, especially at work. Honestly, OP held back more than most people would’ve.*

**SuperPookypower**

*I don’t want to draw a conclusion about what Joe’s speech would mean in London, but where I live, f— implies a specific type of gay man, and it is highly offensive. I don’t want to assume that words have the same meanings everywhere, but to me, he really is speaking out of line. To anyone, much less his boss and his partner. I hope he can get his act together, but I understand why you would want to be through with him. NTA*

>OOP: For me personally it was moreso the Fenian comment that sent me over the edge then the f- ones and from my experience it’s essentially an all encompassing word over here and back home in Ireland lol

**SuperPookypower**

*Over here, most people should not have heard the term “Fenian” outside of watching Peaky Blinders, so they probably wouldn’t use it as a slur, but I can definitely follow your point about that one. It sounds like over there, it is more akin to a racial slur, and those are always inappropriate. It sounds like Joe is really going to lengths to be offensive.*

**AiryContrary**

*I could be reading too much into it, but it sounds sort of like Joe resents these two apparently quiet and bookish Irishmen not being the loud and proud older queer role models he would like to have.*

>OOP: To be honest I do think thats a part of it he seemed disappointed when he came in on the first day knowing it’s a queer bookshop and we didn’t have a ‘gay romance’ section (he has since added one without my husbands consent)

**\*\*Judgement - NTA\*\***

**Update - a few hours later**

Update: Joe is my husbands son. I won't go too much into the details for both my and their privacy but I had a major fight with my husband about why he was being so lenient with him and why we didn't have my back in this. We were shouting back and forth until he shouted something about 'blood being thicker than water' I shout back about him being just some boy and he stopped suddenly. Then he told me.

Joe is from an ex girlfriend of his whose now unable to take care of him so my husband picked up. He's been playing child support for years. We each have our separate bank account so I didn't even notice. I'm contemplating separation and divorce. Someone I've known for 25 years became a stranger in 10 seconds. I physically got sick thinking back on those sexual remarks that he made to his FATHER. My husband alsways went white as a ghost when he said those kinds of things and that was possibly the only thung he actually gave out to him for but it makes me feel sick all the same

**Comments**

**chainblade59**

*The update is absolutely insane. I’m sorry that you got hit with such an overwhelming piece of information. No perfect way to navigate finding out something life-changing like that. Especially NTA now. I wish you the best of luck moving forward after finding out that he was lying for so long (and yes, hiding that information is absolutely lying).*

**the\_owl\_syndicate**

*You have a husband problem.*

**premadecookiedough**

*My coworkers and I can casually throw around the word ""d#ke"" back and forth at each other and it doesn't matter, but I would never use that language around elder lesbians. I never had to deal with the negative affects of that word being used against me.*

*The only reason my peers and I can so casually joke about it now is largely thanks to their generation being the ones who pushed back and loudly fought against hate speech. I consider it the highest form of disrespect to point that language in their direction- its like pointing at a war-torn veteran with a toy gun and thinking it's funny to joke about shooting them*

*NTA- Kids gotta learn one way or another, and gentle warnings aren't getting through to him. Its time he learns that pride month aesthetics aren't what won us our rights, its the quiet bookshop owners who survived years of pointed ab-$e directed at their sexuality and lived to provide a small corner where kids like him can feel safe.*

(So this story/part is a long time coming for me. Almost 3 months between the prologue and this. If you don’t know what’s going on please read the “very long” prologue)


Our story starts with Marlo Haddock, a simple girl who is…who is… gonna be late for school! Marlo lay sprawled on her bed, the room bathed in the soft glow of early morning sunlight, her lips moving to the rhythm of a cartoon theme song playing in her mind. She felt a sudden jolt as the lyrics of ""Mighty Mosasaur"" echoed in her head. With a gasp, she bolted upright, realizing she was late for her first class at Santa Monica Tech. The clock on her nightstand read 8:45 AM, and she had exactly fifteen minutes to get to campus.

Her grandmother, Edna, popped her head in, a knowing smile on her face. *""Marlo, you're gonna miss the bus again,”* she said with a knowing shake of her head.

Marlo rolled her eyes and mumbled, *""Thanks, Gran, I'm aware,""* as she flew into action. She knew the drill—shove textbooks into her backpack, throw on yesterday's jeans, and grab a banana on the way out.    
*“Oh before I forget, I need…”* Edna started to say, but was cut off.    
*“I’dlovetostayandchat,butIgottagonow,loveyoubye!”* Marlo said as she raced out the door, not before taking a moment to glance back at the framed poster of the Mighty Mosasaur that hung proudly on her bedroom wall.      
*""So, let's talk about this guy,""* she said, addressing the invisible audience. 

*""The Mighty Mosasaur was like, the biggest hero Santa Monica ever had. He fought off that crazy alien Fishman and his giant mutated shark, basically saving our butts. No one knows if he survives, so the city decided to build this fancy-schmancy tech school, Santa Monica Tech, Go Gulls! SQUAAAAWK!, to honor him and make sure we're ready for the next big attack.""*

Midway through her info dump to the audience, Marlo dashed to the bus stop, panting and barely managing to hop on before the doors swished shut. She plopped into a seat and continued her narrative, *""And here's the cool part. The city's been using all this new tech the school has been creating to rebuild after the whole big fish -thing. Skyscrapers are greener, cars are quieter, and the beach cleaner than ever. Oh, and the monorail! Who doesn't love a good monorail?""* She smirked at a young child staring at her, clearly bewildered by the one-sided conversation.

*""But what's really changed around here is the cops,""* she went on, her eyes glancing out the window at the sleek police cruisers that zipped by. *""They've gone full sci-fi with energy weapons, thanks to one of the weapons the fish headed alien left behind after the battle. They've got these stun-batons that can fry a bad guy's circuits without breaking the skin, and I've heard whispers about a secret project with the military. They're crafting some kind of ray gun that could take out a sea monster with one shot.""*

Marlo's monologue was soon interrupted by the bus's jolting stop at the university's gates.     
*“Sorry I can’t info dump more on you, I gotta go, or else I’ll be late for class!”*     
She leapt off, her sneakers slapping the pavement as she sprinted towards the modern, gleaming buildings of Santa Monica Tech. The campus was a bustling hub of young, bright minds, all eager to leave their mark on the world. As she wove through the throngs of students, she couldn't help but bump into a few of the ""smarty-pants"" types, their brains packed fuller than their overstuffed backpacks. The bumping cause one smart srudents glasses to fall out of his pocket onto the floor.

Spotting them, she bent down to return them, but the kid was nowhere in sight. *""Well, shoot,""* she murmured, tucking the spectacles into her pocket. *""Looks like I've got a new accessory for the day.""* With a shrug, she straightened up and sprinted towards her building, the clock ticking down.

Marlo burst into her first class, huffing and puffing, just as the professor announced, *""Alright, everyone, settle down. We're starting with a surprise pop quiz!""* A collective groan filled the room, and she couldn't help but feel a twinge of dread. It was her least favorite thing in the world—math class. She slid into her seat, panting, and took a deep breath.

As the quiz began, she took out her borrowed glasses and put them on, hoping they'd help her focus. But as soon as her eyes met the first question, she felt an itch in her brain. The cloxk ticked in the classroom as time went by, but slowly Marlo was figuring out the answers. The itch continued as more and more information filled her brain. She looked down at the paper and knew all the answers. As she weote them out, ahe found herself “remembering” other things, like the answers to a physics test, how to play chess and for some reason that she like Star Trek? Once she finished the quiz, she took the glasses off ans rubbed her eyes. What the heck was going on?

After class, the rest of the day was like a blurr and Marlo made sure not to put the glasses on, though she did inspect them. They werent special, just some wire-frame glasses. Maybe something was wrong with her, so she experimented. Throughout the day, she nabbed a couple peoples pencils, books, and even someone keys, before heading back home to grandmas house. She’d return all of it, eventually.

Once home, she bolted upstairs and laid out her loot from the day. With trembling hands, she picked up each item, holding it tightly, hoping for the strange phenomenon to happen again. But nothing did. Just the feeling of cold, inanimate objects in her palms. Then she grabbed the keys, feeling the weight and coldness of the metal, and held them for a full minute. Her eyes widened as a rush of unfamiliar information flooded her brain. It was like someone had downloaded a new software update into her head, except it wasn’t just data—it was life experiences and memories.

The keys were from a guy named Alex, she realized. Alex loved trivia nights at the local pub, had a fear of spiders, and had a secret crush on the barista at the coffee shop across from the university. He was a computer science major, and his favorite show was a obscure British sitcom from the '90s that she'd never heard of. As all this information flooded into Marlo’s noggin, a sense of fear overwhelmed her and she dropped the keys. *“Grandmaaaaaaa!”* She yelled, bolting out of her room, down to the kitchen.

Her grandma, Edna, looked up from her cooking, a wooden spoon in hand. *“What?! What? What is it?!”* She said panicking as she turned to Marlo who was panting with dread and excitement. *“I’ve got super powers!”* Marlo yelled, both fists pumped up in the air.

Edna put the spoon down and turned to face her, a knowing look in her eyes. *“Well, damn, it’s about time. Your mother had some kind of powers by the time she was 11,”* she said, her voice calm and measured, as if she'd been waiting for this moment for a very long time.

Marlo stared at her, dumbfounded. ""What do you mean? Superpowers? In our family?""

Her grandmother nodded, a hint of amusement in her eyes. *""It's the Haddock genes, sweetheart. They're a bit quirky, and no one power is the same. Your great grandfather had’em, I gott’em, your mother had’em, and now so do you, just dont go showing them off…..Oh! Speaking of the Haddock genes, your little cousin is going to be staying with us for a while.”*

Marlo blinked, trying to process the sudden turn of conversation. *“Cousin? What cousin?”*

Edna wiped her hands on her apron, and headed into the living room. *“You know, Guppy, your cousin? Your late uncle’s kid.”*

Marlo peeked her head into the room. *“Wait, what uncle?”*

Similarly, it lists “di” as “of, about” instead of “from” when one of the first things I learned was “di dove sei”. 

I guess I’m asking if I should try to learn the prepositions outright or only in contextual phrases or some other way? 

Also, how much does preposition confusion impact how clearly I can be understood? For example, if I mistake things like “Sala da pranzo” for “Sala di pranza” will I be still be generally understood or am I speaking nonsense (or, worse, saying something I don’t mean!)

I want a dual fuel inverter generator that I am planning on running on propane, but gas if it comes to that.

Historically, the loss of power is minimal, but typically it's in the hottest of summer and even if for 1 day, all of the above items must be powered - the humidity - oh the humidity!!!

I am either finding inverter generators in the 6000 range running watts or over 8000 running watts --- what if I get a generator that has 8100 running watts or 9000 running watts --- what would happen?

1jzrr6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1jzrr6c/memecoins_are_scams_and_ponzi_schemes_how_to/,“Memecoins are scams and Ponzi schemes!” — How to respond effectively,"A lot of people see crypto as online gambling — almost a scam.  
Then you’ve got another group: people who’ve understood and adopted ""crypto"" but only believe in BTC and a few altcoins with supposed “utility.” They think a token only has value if it’s building a new technology or tied to a big tech project, like the AI meta in 2024/2025.  
They hate, mock, and claim memecoins are scams, useless, and harmful to the image of crypto in the eyes of the general public.

**Let’s break this down together** so you are prepared for the next time somebody wants to debate you on this topic.

Here’s what we’re covering:

1. The **arguments against** memecoins (some are valid).
2. The **arguments for** memecoins and why they’re legit.

**I. Arguments Against Memecoins**

**1. “Memecoins are scams”**

It’s part true: over 95% of tokens launched are either rug pulls, pump and dumps, or slow rugs.  
**But not all of them.**

The **pump fun** trend, which made launching a token on Solana ridiculously easy, has damaged the reputation of memecoins and also user mentality.  
Tokens like **$Trump**, **$Melania**, etc., didn’t help either — they made things worse in the eyes of the public.  
Then there are influencers and groups like the Shib team who push pump and dump schemes and make tons of money off their communities.

➡️ **The key?** Don’t jump into every trending token. These tokens usually have bad distribution and influencers will dump on you over time. Take your time to research a project, to jump into a TG group and get to know the people and their vision.  
**Invest in strong communities** like Kendu — not in hype or influencers.

**2. “Memecoins are Ponzi schemes”**

This is the go-to argument from people who hate memecoins. And I often see people not knowing how to reply.

➡️ A **Ponzi scheme** is a scam where investors are promised a guaranteed return. That’s **not** what memecoins do.

Memecoins are **speculative assets**, just like stocks, gold, fiat currencies, etc. The more people believe in the future of a coin, the more they buy, and the more the price rises.  
But everyone knows the price can also drop — even more so with memecoins.

There are **no promises**, just open market value.

**3. “They’re too volatile, they always die, you have to sell before everyone else”**

Again, this fear comes from what pump fun caused. A lot of people lost trust in DeFi because of that.  
It became a race to sell **before** the rug or the dump.

➡️ To avoid this, you should focus on tokens that have been around **for over a year**, like **Kendu**, which has an active community building the project no matter if the markets are green or red. That’s what makes it secure.

**4. “Without memecoins, crypto would have a better image — they’re stupid”**

**Wrong.**  
If memecoins didn’t exist, crypto would be way less known and less adopted.

Memecoins are easy to understand and built around **community spirit**.  
They’ve already brought — and will keep bringing — millions of people into crypto for the **first time**.

Now yes, I understand where the frustration comes from:

* childish metas like fart/pee/shit/etc coins.
* Celebrity scams/pump & dump coins like $Trump, $Melania, etc.
* Political/rac-ist/illegal coins like the na-zi meta or others.
* All other stupid meta that will show a bad image of crypto to the whole world.

I totally get why people are asking for DeFi regulation (even though it wouldn’t make sense in a truly decentralized world), that's why we have to focus on ""good"" projects to help DeFi for a better adoption.

**5. “I only invest in projects that make sense — not some dog picture with zero value”**

Ah, my favorite one!  
Usually said by people who feel **intellectually superior** — tech lovers, utility-maxis.

➡️ Reminder: **a utility coin is worthless without a community**.  
And it’s actually super hard to build a community around a purely utility-driven token.

People buy in **before** the utility is launched and dump as soon as it goes live. Then no one cares anymore.

Utility coins are often pure ""buy the rumor, sell the news"" plays.

Memecoins that succeed often **build a strong community first**, and **then** develop a real ecosystem.

Take **Kendu** as an example: right now, a **real-world ecosystem** is being built around it.  
Products, services, and companies launched by the community, under the Kendu brand:

* drinks (energy drinks, coffee, tea)
* video game studio
* game board
* Telegram bots
* arts (murals, anime, music...)
* events company
* sponsoring sportsmen, festivals ...and more.

A **true community empire** is forming. And only a **strong, loyal community** can pull that off.

**II. Arguments in Defense of Memecoins**

**1. The first memecoin in crypto history was Bitcoin.**

That’s right.  
The token that gave legitimacy to the entire crypto industry — now considered a **strategic asset** by the most powerful countries in the world — **was a memecoin** at the start.

Only the **BTC maxis** believed in Bitcoin for years and supported it the same way a community supports its memecoin. **Bitcoin has no more inherent utility than a basic memecoin** — its uniqueness lies in being the first. It's a speculative asset with no specific utility, but the community relentlessly pushed it forward. Today, it's the most important asset in crypto and is even compared to gold. **Now, do you see now the power of a dedicated community?**

**2. They’re not Ponzi schemes, as explained earlier.**

Memecoins don’t promise guaranteed returns. They’re speculative, open-market assets just like stocks, art, or collectibles.

**3. Memecoins get their value from their community.**

It’s a **social and digital phenomenon**, not just economic.  
The value of any asset or currency comes **only** from what the market — people — are willing to give it.  
Memecoins are supported and seen as valuable assets by their communities.

➡️ If a community adds **utility** or **real-world value** on top — like Kendu does — the memecoin has strong long-term potential.

**4. Thanks to their communities, memecoins are marketing powerhouses.**

They can draw massive attention to:

* crypto in general
* a specific blockchain
* a new technology
* or even real-world products branded under them (like **Kendu energy drinks**)

Memecoins are **cultural weapons** in the attention economy.

**5. Here’s something you can say to a skeptic:**

“Yes, it’s speculative — but it’s not a Ponzi. It’s a community-driven asset with cultural and viral potential. You don’t have to believe in it, but some memecoins — like Kendu — have done **more** than projects with 50-page whitepapers.”

**Final Thoughts**

No, memecoins aren’t perfect.  
A lot of people and projects have **hurt the industry**, and that’s the main reason behind all the FUD.

But what we **can** do is support projects that truly carry **community values** — and ignore the garbage: the cringe names, the pointless hype, and the influencers dumping on their followers.

If a token just launched 10 days ago and it's already all over X — **you’re likely too late**. You’ll probably lose money.

I see memecoins as a **real opportunity** to give people **financial independence** and even **cultural influence** in today’s world.

That’s why I believe in **Kendu**.  
We promote a fighter’s mindset — pushing to succeed in life with **respect, loyalty, and honor**.  
We grow stronger together, making each other better over time.

It’s real. It’s powerful. And it’s worth being part of.

## What is Immediate Enigma?

Immediate Enigma is an **automated trading platform** designed to trade cryptocurrencies and other financial assets on your behalf. Think of it as a digital assistant that never sleeps, constantly analyzing market data and executing trades based on real-time signals.

It’s built to help users—especially beginners—get into crypto trading without needing to learn all the technical analysis or market patterns. The automation does most of the heavy lifting. It’s not magic, though. You still need to monitor your settings and make adjustments based on your risk tolerance.

The goal? **Maximize opportunities while minimizing the complexity** of trading. It’s similar to tools like Bitcoin Era or Immediate Edge, but Immediate Enigma brings its own flavor to the game.

## Who Created Immediate Enigma?

The platform doesn’t publicly list a famous founder like Elon Musk or Brian Armstrong (lol, not me). But from what I’ve seen and researched, **Immediate Enigma was developed by a group of fintech professionals** and crypto enthusiasts who wanted to democratize access to crypto trading.

They partnered with licensed brokers and compliance-focused tech teams to offer a platform that’s both easy to use and **secure enough to handle real money**. While the lack of a high-profile founder might raise eyebrows, it's not uncommon in the world of algorithmic trading.

As with other platforms in this space, its credibility largely comes from **user reviews, third-party audits, and performance reports**—not flashy marketing or celebrity endorsements.

### [🔥 Start Trading with Immediate Enigma Today](https://tinyurl.com/yku2snr7)
## How Does Immediate Enigma Work?

Immediate Enigma runs on algorithms that analyze massive amounts of market data—price trends, volume shifts, trading signals—and then makes trades automatically. You set your parameters (like how much you want to risk), and the platform does the rest.

Here’s how the system usually operates:

- Scans the market 24/7 for profitable trade setups.
- Executes trades through **partnered brokers**.
- Allows manual override if you want more control.
- Users can monitor performance via a **dashboard with real-time data**.

This kind of automation isn’t new, but Immediate Enigma claims to offer better accuracy and faster execution compared to older platforms. Whether that holds true depends on your settings, market volatility, and a dash of luck.

## Immediate Enigma Pros and Cons

Let’s be real—no platform is perfect. Here’s what stood out to me:

**Pros:**

- ✅ **Beginner-friendly interface**
- ✅ Supports **multiple asset types** (not just crypto)
- ✅ Offers **demo trading** to practice risk-free
- ✅ 24/7 **customer support**
- ✅ **Fast withdrawals** (1–2 days)

**Cons:**

- ❌ **$250 minimum deposit** might be a barrier for some
- ❌ No native mobile app (browser-based only)
- ❌ Doesn’t disclose detailed algorithm logic (common among auto-traders)

In short, it does a lot of things right. But if you’re looking for total transparency or app-store mobile support, it’s not quite there yet.

### [👉 Open Your Immediate Enigma Account Now](https://tinyurl.com/yku2snr7)
## What Devices Can be Used to Access Immediate Enigma?

Immediate Enigma is built to be **device-agnostic**, meaning it works on most:

- **Desktops (Windows, Mac)**
- **Laptops**
- **Tablets**
- **Smartphones**

There’s no dedicated mobile app, but the **web platform is responsive**, so it works fine through mobile browsers like Chrome or Safari. You can check stats, adjust settings, or even make withdrawals on the go.

So yeah, whether you’re couch surfing with your iPad or sneaking a peek during a Zoom call, you’re covered.

## Immediate Enigma – Supported Countries

Immediate Enigma is available in **over 100 countries**, including:

- United States
- Canada
- Australia
- United Kingdom
- Germany
- South Africa
- India

Some countries may have **limited features** due to local regulations, and a few (like North Korea, obviously) are geo-blocked altogether. Registration usually tells you right away whether your region is supported.

## Immediate Enigma – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

The platform uses **AI-based algorithms** to analyze market trends as they happen. This allows it to identify entry and exit points with solid timing. It’s not 100% accurate (nothing is), but the real-time nature gives it an edge.

### User-Friendly Interface

This is one area where Immediate Enigma really shines. The dashboard is **clean, intuitive, and not overloaded with jargon**. Even if you’ve never traded before, you can figure things out fast.

### Mobile Accessibility

While there’s no standalone app, the **mobile browser version is fully functional**. You can tweak your bot settings or check your portfolio while waiting in line for coffee—convenient stuff.

### Customizable Alerts

Get alerts for key events, like **market shifts or profit milestones**. You can set thresholds to avoid overtrading or going beyond your risk appetite. A small but handy feature.

### Multiple Asset Trading

Immediate Enigma supports not just crypto, but also **forex, stocks, and commodities**. That’s a big win if you want to diversify beyond just Bitcoin or ETH.

## Is Immediate Enigma a Scam?

Short answer: **Doesn’t seem like it**.

Long answer: After reviewing the platform, testing it with a small deposit, and reading user feedback, I didn’t find anything that screamed scam. The brokers are **regulated**, deposits are handled securely, and the platform doesn’t promise overnight riches (a red flag for scams).

Still, always be cautious. No auto-trader can **guarantee profits**, and you should never invest money you can’t afford to lose.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Immediate Enigma?

The **minimum deposit is $250**, which is pretty standard for platforms in this category. This gives your bot enough capital to begin trading effectively.

While some folks might wish for a lower entry point, this amount helps filter out spam and ensures you’re serious about using the platform.

### Immediate Enigma Customer Support

Support is available **24/7 via live chat and email**. I tested the chat feature and got a response within 5 minutes—not bad. The agents seemed knowledgeable and didn’t just copy-paste answers.

There’s also a growing **FAQ section** on the site that covers basics like account setup, deposits, and withdrawals.

## How do you start trading on Immediate Enigma?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Go to the official site and fill in your name, email, and phone number. No payment info needed to create an account.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

Once registered, you’ll be connected to a **regulated broker** who will guide you through identity verification. After that, make your first deposit (minimum $250).

### Step 3: Start Trading

Access the dashboard, adjust your trading settings, and switch on **auto-trading**. You can also try the **demo mode** first if you want to see how it works without risking real money.

## How to Delete an Immediate Enigma Account?

If you’re done with the platform, just contact customer support and request account deletion. They’ll usually ask for identity confirmation and process the request within 24–48 hours.

It’s not instant, but it’s straightforward.

## What Devices Can be Used to Access Enigma AI?

You can access Enigma AI on pretty much any modern device:
- **Desktop**: Works smoothly on Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- **Mobile**: Fully responsive mobile support for iOS and Android browsers
- **Tablet**: Tablet-friendly UI for trading on the go

There’s no dedicated mobile app yet, but honestly, the browser version works just fine. I had no issues accessing my account or tweaking settings from my phone.

## Enigma AI – Supported Countries

Enigma AI is available in **most major countries**, including:
- United States
- Canada
- United Kingdom
- Australia
- New Zealand
- Most of Europe

However, **some regions are geo-blocked** due to local regulations. If you try to sign up and get a “not available in your region” message, that’s probably why. Use a VPN with caution — it may violate terms of use.

## Enigma AI – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

Enigma AI’s core strength is real-time data processing. The system evaluates thousands of market indicators and patterns to find trades with high potential returns. This means you’re not reacting to the market—you’re staying ahead of it.

### User-Friendly Interface

This is one of the cleanest UIs I’ve seen in a trading bot. Everything’s intuitive, from funding your account to setting up your trading preferences. No confusing jargon, no bloated menus.

### Mobile Accessibility

Even without a native app, the mobile site is responsive and fast. You can check trades, pause the bot, or cash out—all from your phone while waiting in line for coffee.

### Customizable Alerts

You can set alerts for price movements, trade executions, or market news. It’s like having a **personal trading assistant** texting you when something important happens.

### Multiple Asset Trading

Most bots focus only on crypto. Enigma AI gives you access to **stocks, forex, commodities, and crypto**, so you’re not putting all your eggs in one basket. Diversification is a huge plus here.

## Is Enigma AI a Scam?

Short answer: **doesn’t look like it**.

There are a few red flags (like the vague team info), but nothing that screams ""scam"" to me. I tested the platform, withdrew funds, and everything worked as expected. That said, always use caution and **don’t invest more than you can afford to lose**.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Enigma AI?

The platform requires a **minimum deposit of $250** to activate live trading. This is pretty standard across platforms like **Bitcoin Era** or **Immediate Edge**.

The funds are held by a partnered broker, and you can withdraw them anytime. Just note that some brokers may charge a small fee or have a withdrawal threshold.

### Enigma AI Customer Support

Customer support is surprisingly decent. You can reach them via:
- **Live Chat** (24/7)
- **Email Support**
- **Phone (in certain regions)**

I tested the live chat and got a reply within 2 minutes. Not bad at all.

## How do you start trading on Enigma AI?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Go to the official Enigma AI website and enter your name, email, and phone number. No complicated forms or ID uploads at this stage.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

Once you're in, you’ll be assigned to a broker. You’ll need to deposit at least **$250** to get started. Most brokers accept credit cards, bank transfers, and even crypto.

### Step 3: Start Trading

After funding, you can activate the AI bot. You can either:
- Run it in **auto mode**
- Or test it in **demo mode** first

It’s honestly plug-and-play from here.

## How to Delete an Enigma AI Account?

Deleting your account is simple but not instant. You’ll have to:
1. Contact customer support via email or chat
2. Request account closure
3. Withdraw any remaining funds

It took me about 48 hours to fully close my account after withdrawal. No hidden fees or weird hoops to jump through.

1jzroae,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1jzroae/which_budget_grinder_30/,Which Budget Grinder [£30],"Hi all, new poster here but long time coffee drinker.

I'm based in the UK and I'm usually a 3 coffees a day person.

I've recently bought an Aeropress, which has pretty much replaced my Nespresso machine (apart from the occasional convenience), and it's been going great so far with pre-ground coffee from the likes of Rave, etc.

I've been looking into buying freshly roasted whole coffee beans, to grind just before use with my Aeropress, and to do this I wanted to buy a cheap grinder to go with my beans.

I've purchased some coffee beans from CWorks, and at the same time I brought the following electric blade ""grinder"" as it was cheap:
Duronic Electric Coffee Grinder CG250 - £20
https://amzn.eu/d/cemJw8a

I've been doing a little more research and seen that there is a manual burr grinder that isn't too much more expensive, and now I'm wondering if I should have picked this:
Hario Mini Mill Plus (Transparent Black) - £26
https://amzn.eu/d/8yjK1oN

Can anyone advise if they have any experience with either of the above grinders, and which would be better out of the two for Aeropress? Alternatively if you have any other recommendations within the budget of £30.

I will add that I do plan to treat myself to a much nicer setup later in the year for my 40th, so the above is a means-to-an-end, which is why I don't want to spend too much - but I'd rather pay a little more for a better coffee experience.

The future setup I'll be moving to around November/December will likely be a Sage Bambino Plus paired with a DF54.

Thank you for reading and I look forward to any responses 🙂",1,1744723108.0,espresso,4,1.0,False

I literally don’t know many people, I know people from Work places but I never connected with them other than to do with Work. 

I feel like it could be me that’s the problem because I’m too depressed to do anything about it and I literally don’t like anyone where I live, I feel limited to where I live because it feels like there’s no one in my city that’s compatible for me because they are all alcoholics and I’m not. I have the language barrier and people come and go so the reason to hate where I live so point is if I’m not happy where I live in the first place, then that’s why nothing is working out for me..  everyone’s on holiday here all year round that it’s very hard to even notice any locals that would be a right fit. Maybe it’s because I hate the country I live in that I’m not thriving enough to meet people because I know it’s so much easier to meet people when you’re happy, I feel stuck and unable to live a life that I would be happy living so it’s keeping me from being happy with my life to attract people right for me.

I’ve tried to go to any clubs and events that I could possibly find that share my hobbies and I just meet old retired people and all the young people aren’t interested in being friends or maybe I don’t know how to talk to people, who knows it all comes down to being unhappy with my life but I’m too sad to socialise and concentrate on being a better version of myself. People say it will just happen, but I believe that’s only if you have lots of friends and have a big social network.

I’m 29 and I’m starting to not see the point in even trying to keep it up anymore because at this point in my life, I would’ve thought that I would’ve settled down by now, and I really have disappointed myself but I’m scared I’ll never get to have children with anyone and get married because I’m stuck remaining single not by choice and I’ve literally always been single my whole life. 

People say I’m beautiful, but yet I struggle that maybe I don’t know how to connect with men or men come up with reasons not to want to be with me and I can also be picky when people think they may be out of my league.

While it was a mix of emotions for sure, it opened me up to the drug Prazosin which is used a lot in PTSD treatment. It is technically a blood pressure medication, but it’s an alpha blocker which reduces the flight or flight response. This in turn helps us to sleep through the night without any nightmares. 

Before this appointment I would often sleep 12+ hours a day, and I would wake up several times throughout the night due to my bad dreams. I would ALWAYS wake up in the morning drenched in sweat, still exhausted, and on edge/anxious. Often this would throw my whole day off and I didn’t even realize it was causing a lot of my other symptoms such as fatigue and low concentration. 

I took 1mg for the first time last night right before bed. I slept right at 8 hours and woke up feeling like an entirely different person. I feel so energetic and well rested today and I haven’t even had my coffee yet. I couldn’t tell you what my dreams were about, which I would much prefer to having traumatic ones that stay in the back of my mind all day. I woke up one time last night due to my dog barking but that was it.

I know this is a question as old as AA itself and I know the Big Book does not necessarily forbid it or have some hard rule/timeline on it.  It is obviously very subjective and personal topic.  I do not think I am ""unique"" in some way that means I am immune to the pitfalls of sobriety...which is why I am asking this question instead of rushing into something that will end up hurting us both.

Some background: I am back in the rooms after a 10+ year hiatus and taking AA seriously this time. In the past it was always just to placate something else (courts, ex-wife, etc...) long enough to get them off my ass so I could get back to my ""normal"" way of life having a few drinks daily.  Obviously I am a long time alcoholic (and well aware of it) but this year I made the decision on my own accord to stop once and for all because I have seen myself sliding down that slippery slope more than once in the last few years. I needed a solution before I burned my life down.  I know AA works and I am confident that working the program/steps will be successful because this time I am ready. I have a sponsor and I am working the steps with him (finishing Step-4 this week). We meet several times a week and attend meetings daily.  Not because I ""have"" to...I am really enjoying them and look forward to it everyday as well as the opportunities for service work that I am enjoying.  The desire to drink and obsession with alcohol has been lifted completely from my life thanks to my higher power and the step work with my sponsor.  This is my new way of life and I am allowing myself to surrender to it 100%.

I got divorced 8 years ago and we are civil (no drama) and I have been single for several years. I was not even looking to date or get involved with someone right now.  My life is stable and has been stable for many years (minus the alcohol) with a solid career, loving family, etc... I own my home (16 yrs) and have been fortunate to avoid any legal issues. I don't use drugs or any substitute for alcohol to mask the addiction.  My decision to stop drinking now was to quit before I burned it all down with some catastrophic event that SO easily happens to people like us when we least expect it.

Having said all that...I met someone this past weekend. I have noticed her before and it's the 1st time I have actually genuinely felt interested in meeting/dating a woman. She is not a newbie and has over 5 years sobriety. We've chatted a little but I have been hesitant to ask for her number or anything beyond just flirty conversation once in a while. Or maybe it isn't ""flirty"" and I'm just so far removed from the dating world I'm reading into it.  This past weekend I did notice her making a point to initiate some physical contact...a pat on the arm, leaning into me to rub shoulders, and other various ways of casual physical contact she initiated, but still subtle enough that I'm not sure what to make of it.  The conversations are light and a lot of laughter and I am starting to feel like I'd like to ask for her number and if she'd be interested in getting together for coffee or something outside of the rooms.

Asking in the context of which in, that someone who has dementia, requests that they are euthanised when reaching later stages of dementia/deterioration.","A politician, who is very interested in philosophy, was having a talk at our school over dementia. I had asked him about his thoughts over whether people are should be allowed to euthanise themselves with a prevoiced request before contracting dementia and so, to be euthanised in later stages of dementia/after contracting dementia. And also asked about his opinion on those with mental illnesses being able to euthanise themselves, who are suffering but don't have terminal illnesses. Even though this person advocates for more broader and encompassing euthanasia laws, he was not for these options of euthanasia and regaled a story about a older woman who had wanted to be euthanised before her dementia. Her request was fufilled after contracting the disease, but inorder to fufill it and euthanise her, she was first sedated by something they had slipped into her coffee. Then during the procedure she had to be forcefully held by family and was struggling while being euthanised. But he did so in quite a biased way, (personally). 

I am, on the other hand, supporting being able to request to have euthanasia before dementia deteriorates you as a person. As I find it within your right as a person to dignity and to be able to shelter it, and in this case be able euthanise yourself before this dignity is violated, and so your former self does not feel shame. But, I am confused as dementia deteriorates a person where it can no longer be unrecognisably themselves, and could in some ways not be catagorised them not being themselves anymore. Would then then this case mean that you cannot request to euthanise yourself anymore, as you and your former self's motives and thoughts don't align, and you are not the same being as you once were? A different person?

Are you still socialited to be able to euthanise yourself if you are not the person you were previously? -Is a more direct way to put it. I am just wondering how to approach the validity of people's right to dignity as well and if this is in the ethics periphery or otherwise. Haha or may be overcomplexifing a relatively simple querie.

We’re planning a 10-day family holiday in August — me, my wife, and my parents. Last year we went to Lisbon and loved it. This year, after lots of searching, we’ve picked Lyon.

Main reason is my dad loves public transport — just riding it and photographing it — and Lyon looks great for that. The rest of us are happy sightseeing, having coffee or wine in a square, and a bit of browsing.

Evenings we like to eat out together, but we keep it simple — nothing fancy.

My only worry is August. On Google, a lot of places look permanently closed (same in the UK), but I know a lot shuts in France in August too. I’m worried it might feel a bit dead and we won’t get the best out of Lyon.

We’re staying in the Old Town. Will it be fine, or should we have picked a different time?

My reactive rescue broke out of a locked canopy and attacked another dog. The other dog is fine, there was no blood or damage. Sounds like my guy more pinned the other dog. If there had been injury’s to the other dog it would feel more clear cut. Spoke with the owner who was very shaken. She said the dog was fine but I offered to pay for an exam to make sure. I’ll text her this morning to check in and put a time limit on the offer to pay for the exam. 

He’s never bit before. 

The canopy was the work around after almost 3 years of juggling outings, not taking him places. He just wants to go with. He’s a wonderful dog until he sees another dog. The switch flips and he just wants to get at it. 

I’ve worked with one trainer who was all positive and tried to coach a positive association with other dogs with me giving him treats. His behavior got significantly worse and he almost went through a glass window when he slammed into it seeing another dog. Worked with another trainer who felt his behavior was correctable but that he needed positive associations with other dogs. Tried introducing him to a friends dog who had enough life experience to be a good match and she hated him. Videoed the meeting for the trainer and she didn’t feel his body language showed aggression. That trainer worked more on teaching me about triggers, body language, arousal - with the hard line that once he’s over his threshold for arousal he has to be removed. There’s no training him once he’s in over his head. 

Now I don’t know if I can trust him. I feel horrible for the other person and her dog. As an animal person I’m just horrified that my animal caused fear in someone else. Logically his behavior has gotten worse and the next dog might not be that lucky. 

He was  rescue who was a stray with no history. Shelters and rescues are all so overwhelmed where I’m at so I feel like just taking him back isn’t an option. A couple months in it was obvious he wasn’t the dog they thought and I made the decision to keep him and work with him because I thought I could save him. But it’s been almost 3 years. I miss camping and hiking. I miss going out for a meal or coffee and not being worried about the dog left in the vehicle or the dog at home. I miss going for walks without constantly scanning for other dogs like I’m some sort of k9 secret service. I’m worried about liability too. This is a large dog, and now there’s an event like this. 

This happened yesterday evening, had a huge drive home, and now I’m waiting for the vet to open so I can call them and see what are appropriate next steps. A third trainer doesn’t feel right, idk about meds. Because the bite didn’t cause damage idk if be makes sense but also the length of history, the escalation. I don’t even know what’s right for me and my peace of mind.

## What is Cryzoris Prime AI?

Cryzoris Prime AI is an **automated trading platform** that uses artificial intelligence to analyze market trends and make trading decisions. It’s designed to help users — even those with little to no trading experience — buy and sell cryptocurrencies and other digital assets more efficiently.

The platform claims to use **machine learning algorithms** to scan the market in real-time, spot profitable trades, and execute them faster than a human ever could. Basically, it’s like having a super smart assistant that never sleeps and is always watching the charts.

While it sounds impressive, Cryzoris Prime AI isn’t alone. There are similar platforms like Bitcoin Code and Immediate Edge, but Cryzoris Prime sets itself apart with a focus on **user accessibility and automated customization**.

## Who Created Cryzoris Prime AI?

The exact team behind Cryzoris Prime AI isn't fully disclosed — which, honestly, is pretty common in this space. But according to the official site and some third-party sources, the platform was developed by a group of experienced **AI engineers and financial analysts**.

They supposedly aimed to bridge the gap between complex trading strategies and everyday users. While the lack of visible founders might raise an eyebrow, it doesn’t automatically mean the platform is shady. **Bitcoin Era and similar platforms operate the same way.** Still, I’d love more transparency on this front.

## How Does Cryzoris Prime AI Work?

At the core of Cryzoris Prime AI is its **automated trading algorithm**. This AI is trained to:

- Analyze large sets of market data
- Identify patterns and signals
- Make trading decisions based on risk tolerance and market conditions
- Execute trades instantly, often within milliseconds

Users can choose between **manual and automated trading modes**. If you're experienced, you can tweak the settings and strategies. If you're a beginner, the AI will handle everything for you.

One thing I liked is that the trading bot claims to operate **24/7**, meaning it won’t miss opportunities while you sleep. It taps into multiple exchanges and asset classes, not just Bitcoin, which gives it an edge if you're into diversifying.

## Cryzoris Prime AI Pros and Cons

Let’s be real — no platform is perfect. Here's what stood out to me:

**Pros:**
- ✅ **Easy to use**, even for beginners
- ✅ **Automated trading** with customizable settings
- ✅ **Supports multiple assets**, not just crypto
- ✅ **Real-time market insight** powered by AI
- ✅ **Demo account** to test strategies
- ✅ Fast withdrawals (usually within 48 hours)

**Cons:**
- ❌ **No info on founders**
- ❌ **Requires a $250 minimum deposit**
- ❌ **Not available in some countries**
- ❌ **High-risk environment** (inherent to trading)

So while Cryzoris Prime AI checks a lot of boxes, it’s not a magic money machine — you still need to understand the risks.

That makes it a legit platform if you're looking to diversify.

Short version: **Doesn’t look like it.**

Long version? I couldn’t find any major red flags. It has:

- Verified user reviews
- Transparent trading performance (via demo mode)
- Responsive customer service
- No outrageous promises of guaranteed profits

Still, it’s important to remember that **trading always carries risk**, especially in the crypto world. So while Cryzoris Prime AI seems legit, don’t go in expecting overnight riches.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Cryzoris Prime AI?

The minimum deposit is **$250**. This is pretty standard across AI trading platforms. You can use credit/debit cards, wire transfers, or crypto wallets to fund your account. Just don’t invest more than you can afford to lose.

## How do you start trading on Cryzoris Prime AI?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Go to the official Cryzoris Prime AI website and fill out the sign-up form. You’ll need your name, email, and phone number.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

Once you sign up, a broker rep will reach out to verify your identity. After that, you’ll need to make the **$250 deposit** to start trading. This also unlocks access to the demo account.

### Step 3: Start Trading

Now you can either choose **manual mode** or let the AI handle things for you. I recommend starting with the demo version to get a feel for how it works.

## How to Delete a Cryzoris Prime AI Account?

If you ever want to delete your account, just contact support via email or live chat. They’ll walk you through the process. Make sure you **withdraw your funds first**, though, because once it’s deleted, it’s gone for good.

### [🔥 Start Trading with Cryzoris Prime AI Today](https://tinyurl.com/bde7cwuw)
## The Verdict

Honestly? **Cryzoris Prime AI surprised me.** It’s clean, fast, and simple enough for beginners but still offers enough control for more experienced traders. The use of AI makes it a powerful tool, especially if you don’t have hours to spend analyzing charts.

Would I call it perfect? Nah. The lack of transparency around the team is a bit of a letdown, and you should always be cautious with auto-trading platforms. But if you’re looking to dip your toes into AI-powered trading — **this is a solid place to start**.

So I'm back from last time when I was asking for accommodation advice. Unfortunately the place we were looking at last time didn't quite work out, so we're having one last look at accommodation for our upcoming Paris trip (late October for 5 adults). We've had another look through places and found some options that we thing might be good:

1. [Family apartment between Gambetta and Père Lachaise](https://www.airbnb.com.au/rooms/1648100)
2. [4 rooms Paris](https://www.airbnb.com.au/rooms/13971682)
3. [Ménilmontant / Belleville](https://www.airbnb.com.au/rooms/18760572)
4. [Lovely and clear familial apartment](https://www.airbnb.com.au/rooms/1586267)

Like before we're looking at going to the Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe, Montparnasse Tower, as well as possibly things like Notre Dame, Trocadero and maybe a museum like the Lourve or Orsay. To fit the budget we'd like to be within 30-40 minutes via public transport for most things, and if one or two things are a little more than 40 minutes we can just deal with it. We'd also like to be close to some restaurants, food places, shops/groceries and maybe some cafes to grab a coffee during the day.

I'm not 100% sure if I was looking at the right things but from what I could tell, most of these options should be good for public transport, but I'm still not entirely confident in myself to be sure that these are good areas to stay in too, so I just wanted to see what people thought of them?

Recently I came across an article that interpreted Chiron’s aspects to personal planets and the way these aspects manifested in one of the most beautiful ways;

“A great example of a Neptunian / Chironic character whose yearning for transcendence mingled with pain and grief was universally known would be Ludwig van Beethoven. In his natal chart, Chiron in Pisces makes aspects to almost all planets, including Neptune. Throughout his entire life, Beethoven had a passion and yearning to make music that would go beyond what was known to be possible or widely appreciated at his time. In a Chironic twist, the faculty he was mostly dependent on, his hearing ability, began to decline in his late 20s. Throughout the last decade of his life, he had to make music without even having the chance of hearing his own composition. Paradoxically enough, his most beloved pieces that would lift the spirits of millions of people around the world were composed precisely during the time of his almost-complete deafness.” words by astrologer Tina Rahimi. 

I also took a look at Black Coffee’s natal chart, he suffered a severe injury in 1990 that lead to him losing the use of his left arm. He then proceeded to defy all odds and has become a worldwide celebrated DJ.

1jzrckt,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/1jzrckt/still_early_in_my_journey_but_i_think_im_becoming/,Still early in my journey… but I think I’m becoming vegan,"Hey everyone—I hope this is the right place to post this. I’m still kind of new to this lifestyle, and I’ve been reflecting a lot on why I made this choice and how it’s reshaped the way I think about food, ethics, and myself.

I grew up in a lower middle class family that was typically carnivorous and heavy on fast food. It didn’t do much for my health, and I’ve struggled with weight issues for most of my life. Last year, I started working as a security guard. It wasn’t a bad job, but it made things worse physically—I was stuck in the guard box for 8 hours a day and mostly ordered food through DoorDash. I wanted to do better, but alternatives were hard to find.

Around that time, I came across *Diet for a Small Planet*, and something clicked. I started experimenting with vegetarian meals—simple recipes I found online. At first it was casual, but it planted a seed.

Things really shifted during Lent this year. I decided to give up meat on Wednesdays and Fridays, and reduce my consumption overall. At first it was a spiritual discipline—but it stuck. There was something about it that made me feel more grounded, more compassionate, more *me*. One small shift led to another, and I started to notice… I wasn’t eating much meat at all.

I remember sitting in a Subway one day. As I placed my order, the woman behind me asked, “Why don’t you eat meat? Are you vegetarian?” I replied, “I’m trying to be.” It was a fast day. She smiled and told me she rarely ate meat herself. Later, I checked my food log and realized—I hadn’t eaten any animal products that day. In fact, I was down to eating meat maybe once a week. That moment really stayed with me.

A few days later, my dad took me out after church. I told myself I’d save meat for family occasions. We went to IHOP, and the waitress asked, “Do you want the bacon with the bananas foster?” “No, not that.” “Sausage?” “No sausage.” She paused. “So… no meat at all?” I laughed awkwardly, but yeah—no meat. And you know what? The meal was great.

Later that morning, my dad took me grocery shopping. He’s a very conservative guy and loves meat, but he’s always been supportive of my weight loss efforts—and I think he sees how much this change means to me. I told him I was going to make orange tofu and vegetarian BBQ wings. He even pointed out that Walmart sells plant-based cheese. He picked it up and laughed in a kind of impressed way. At checkout, he joked, “What about the chicken?” I told him, “There is no chicken. It’s a vegetarian recipe.” We laughed.

But that night I stayed up thinking. *Plant-based cheese? At Walmart? What does this mean for me? Could I go without milk and cheese too? Could I actually do this?*

Even switching to soy milk in my coffee had felt like a huge change at first. But the more I thought about it, the less appealing animal products became—not just physically, but spiritually. I started to feel differently about what I put into my body.

One day, I poured cow’s milk into my coffee like I always used to. I took a few sips… and something didn’t sit right. I thought about what a cow had to go through for that milk to get there. I remembered reading that mother cows grieve after being separated from their calves—they cry, pace, search for their babies. And in that moment, I thought, “Someone lost their mama so humans could have this.” I felt my eyes begin to water and I shed a small tear. The milk didn’t taste right. It wasn’t spoiled, but it felt wrong. I haven’t touched cow’s milk since that day.

Since embracing this plant-based journey, I’ve also experienced positive changes in my health. I’ve lost 12 pounds and my ibs has become less of an issue. 

I don’t know if I’m ready to call myself a “perfect vegan,” but I’ve stopped seeing this as just a temporary phase. I care about animals. I care about the climate. And I care about how food affects my body and spirit. I want my choices to reflect those values—even if I’m still working out the details.

I don’t think I’ll ever be the preachy type. But I do believe this is the right path. Sometimes it feels isolating—especially when people make snide comments or act like I’m just trying to be different. I’m really not. I just want to live in a way that causes less harm.

So yeah… I guess I just wanted to share my story. If you’ve got encouragement, your own journey, advice, or just want to say hi—I’d love that too. This choice feels right, but it can feel heavy sometimes. Thanks for reading.",7,1744722182.0,vegan,1,0.89,False

I’m considering buying the new Breville Oracle Jet, and I had a quick question for anyone who’s already picked one up or is more familiar with its design.

We have a dedicated water line already installed and ready to go (ran it a while back in anticipation of eventually getting a plumbed-in espresso machine). I know the Oracle Jet uses a built-in water tank and isn’t marketed as being directly plumbable—but I’ve seen people modify older Breville models (like the Dual Boiler) by carefully cutting into the water tank and attaching a float valve, similar to a toilet-fill mechanism, to work with a pump or constant pressure line.

Has anyone tried modifying the Oracle Jet in this way? Or is there any hidden support for a direct water line that I’ve missed?

And if not—are there other espresso machines in the same price point (around $2,500 or so) that offer similar features (auto grind, tamp, milk texturing, dual boiler, etc.) and support a direct water connection out of the box?

Their goal is to create a sense of “familiarity” making the green apron stand out. Trust me, it’s already doing the job.

I do notice when the staff is wearing the same thing at a cafe, and it’s is not a cafe I want to be in. It’s like going to a museum cafe. It feels like the coffee is not the focus, and the cafe is just holding place for someone who wants a coffee but isn’t there for the coffee.

A coffee shop to me evokes a sense of creativity, and interest in the craft while embracing personality. By turning clothing into uniforms, you’re marketing the company like a fast-food chain. It puts Starbucks on the Dunkin Donuts level, and cheapens it. I’ll still go to Dunkin Donuts, but I’m going for a desperate boost in caffeine, not for the coffee. The only difference is that Starbucks is ridiculously more expensive. But with a whitewashing of personality, it really feels like their staff become product, not people. And when you don’t have people invested in your company, your coffee is markedly worse. 

This is a long way of saying, as a customer, I don’t care what people are wearing now, but seeing staff in uniforms… that actually makes a statement, and not a positive one.

Today I went to a coffee shop near my place. I’ve been a regular there for a few months, and I’ve gotten to know a lot of the staff and even some of the customers. One guy in particular (let’s call him Emre) always chats with me when I’m there. Nothing flirty, just friendly conversation. He’s a regular too, and we have a lot of mutual friends.

I tried to calm my boyfriend down, but he was having none of it. He ended up grabbing me and dragging me out of the coffee shop, and I was so embarrassed.

Park itself is stunning, scenery is gorgeous, lush, extravagant, quaint and the transition between themed areas is amazing, beautifully done. When I walked deep into Polynesia I thought I'd gone out of the park! There are enough places to eat with good enough food (coffee's are a bit small but oh well). Everything is as clean as it can be, on a par with Universal. No litter anywhere and a nice hose down before park open makes for a very welcoming environment. Now, the place is stupidly busy (unsurprising considering how amazing everything is) but if you aren't willing to queue a while then don't expect to get on much. 90+ minute queues for the most part on each day which I would consider very busy for April. They really try to make you buy express passes, the operations are quite slow, they let stupid amounts of express pass holders on at a time, they only make most 1 shot express passes available at 4pm (to try and make you buy the packages instead) so it can be a bit annoying, but if you can look past that, this place is pretty much perfect.

Roller Coasters:
Tami Tami (1x) - A decent coaster for the  kids with some nice scenery. Not really much to say here, it's fun and worth trying if you have nothing else to do.

Dragon Khan (2x) - Pleasantly surprised by this, did Kumba and Hulk last year and they were amazing. This is better than Hulk for me due to it's ridiculously intense ending, and while the first half (apart from the Zero G Roll) isn't quite as intense, it is still not far behind Kumba for me. Grey out central and no where near as rough as people say.

Tomahawk (2x) - A fun little wooden coaster with some surprisingly strong laterals. Pretty solid and fairly smooth for a coaster of it's class, but is just too short!

Stampida (2x - 1x Red & 1x Blue) - Another surprising coaster for me, heard dreadful things about it and really wasn't that bad at all. Yes there is a rattle but not really painful. There are lot's of intense laterals and a few pops of Airtime. The new GCI titan track is smooth as butter, can't wait for them to carry on with this as I think it will improve the overall experience for many. Solid dueling coaster and a lot of fun, nothing amazing though.

El Diablo (2x) - The longest Arrow Mine Train is... too long?! That 2nd lift hill is just pointless to me and really makes the pacing weird. It's pretty janky but kind of adds to it's quirks. The drop out of the station on the back is a nice surprise!

Shambhala (3x) - OH. MY. GOD. This is definitely my number 3 (behind VelociCoaster and Gwazi, in front of Hyperia, Red Force and Mako, in that order). First 2 rides were on the very back row and the airtime is off the wall insane. You can really feel those negative G's increase in power as you are dragged down the drops, and the turn around is the icing on the cake. My ride on the front wasn't as intense, but the views and sense of speed made up for it. Beautiful ride and even more beautiful to ride!

Uncharted (3x) - *SPOILERS* Right, the theming in the queue is really nice, and the set at the beginning of the ride is really well done. The rest of the ride's theming is a few screens. That's literally it. However, the ride itself is absolutely insane, 5 ""launches"" (some feel more like kicks) are just crazy and the spinning is really cool, especially on the spike. That backwards drop at the end is fucking ridiculous if you aren't expecting it. Great ride if you can look past the lack of theming..

Furious Baco (3x) - Biggest surprise (by far) of the trip for me, was expecting the worst... and got given even worse than that. In fact, it was so stupidly shaky it just added so much to the experience. I had 2 rides on row 4, both wing seats and 1 on the back on an inside seat. Staring down that launch track and not being able to see anything that happens after is so weird, and the launch is obliterative. Then the drop into the canyon is fucking mental, ejector airtime  off the wall, and then... Bang. From here on you are just being jackhammered in your seat as if you are holding a neumatic drill and being thrown all around the seat. The inversion however is smooth and filled with hangtime! My 2nd favorite ride in this park, 3rd in the whole resort.

Hurakan Condor is the best (and scariest) drop tower I've done (especially on the stand up side, which surprisingly was not  that uncomfortable). Tutuki Splash is by far the best of the water rides, the other 2 are good filler attractions.

1jzraqo,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridgeFanatic/comments/1jzraqo/discover_how_the_frigidaire_efic108_black_ice/,Discover how the Frigidaire EFIC108 Black Ice Maker performs in our detailed review.,"Having spent weeks with the **Frigidaire EFIC108-BLACK 26 Lbs Portable Compact Ice Maker**, I've really gotten familiar with its quirks, strengths, and occasional annoyances. Ice makers aren't usually something I get excited about, but this sleek little gadget certainly added convenience to my daily life. Whether hosting casual get-togethers or chilling beverages after long workdays, it delivered as promised. But it’s not all sunshine and cubes—there are definitely a few things you might want to weigh.

The first thing that grabs your attention is the design. This black, medium-sized ice-making machine looks modern with its smooth finish and compact countertop design. It easily fit in my moderately-sized kitchen and didn’t overcrowd the space. Measuring 14.09 x 9.53 x 12.91 inches, it’s smaller than I expected, which made it easy to move around. One week, it was nestled next to the coffee machine, and the next, it migrated to the dining table for quick access during my niece's study group. The transparent window on top kept me oddly entertained as I could watch the ice-making magic in progress. Really, who knew watching ice cubes form would be this satisfying? 

**Grab [Frigidaire EFIC108-BLACK] at the best price on Amazon.**[Click here to see the price](https://fridgefanatic.com/p/b07pbwxbct/).

What surprised me most was how speedy it is. Producing ice in approximately six minutes, this machine is a lifesaver during moments when you suddenly realize you’re out of ice and have thirsty guests staring at you. It’s capable of churning out up to 26 pounds of ice each day—an amount no one in my household could realistically use unless we opened a bar! A standout feature is the ability to choose between two ice cube sizes. My kids love the smaller cubes for their juice, while I personally prefer the larger ones for those after-work iced teas.

Of course, the ice-making process isn’t entirely hands-off. The water reservoir holds 2.3 quarts, so I did have to refill it occasionally. Though that sounds tedious, I barely noticed it after getting into a routine. Cleaning the machine is also relatively easy—just wipe it down, and you're set. The included ice shovel and basket were helpful accessories, making it easier to transfer ice without creating a slippery kitchen battlefield. 

**Positive Features**
- Compact size and portable design made it versatile across different spaces.  
- Quick ice production (around six minutes) for those “oops, we forgot the ice” moments.  
- Conveniently offers two ice cube size options.  
- Transparent viewing window made monitoring simple and (surprisingly) fun.  

The digital LED control panel deserves its own praise, primarily for its simplicity. As someone who despises overly complicated gadget interfaces, I found this panel straightforward and user-friendly. It guided me through every step of using the machine—from selecting cube sizes to knowing when to refill water or empty the ice basket. I had my doubts about the control panel durability, but so far, it’s held up well through my occasional mishaps.

**Critiques**
- The machine, though quick, has a loud humming operation that might bother quieter households.  
- Requires frequent refilling for those who use ice excessively.  
- Cube production occasionally gets inconsistent, especially on warmer days.  
- Limited to two size options—more customization would be nice.  

To gauge how it stacks up against competitors, I tried comparing it with products like the GE Profile Opal Nugget Ice Maker and the IKICH Portable Ice Maker. The GE model offers higher-end features like nugget-styled ice and Bluetooth connectivity—fancy stuff, but at a dramatically higher price point. On the other hand, the IKICH machine, while cheaper and compact, lacks speed and doesn’t deliver on the volume of ice production. This particular black ice maker from Frigidaire falls beautifully in between, offering reliable performance without an over-the-top price tag.

Price Performance  
The price feels justified, although some might consider it slightly on the higher side for a portable ice maker. It balances practicality and reasonable cost efficiently. If you’re hosting small to medium-sized events or just craving icy beverages daily, the value here speaks for itself. However, if your ice needs lean towards nugget varieties or heavier use, you might want to consider alternatives. Still, with this one, you’re getting top-tier functionality, and let's face it, it looks cooler than many of its rivals.

## What is Culture Decentrix?

Culture Decentrix is a **modern automated trading platform** designed to help users trade cryptocurrency, forex, and other financial assets more efficiently. It uses **AI-driven algorithms** to scan market trends, identify opportunities, and execute trades on your behalf.

Think of it like your own digital trading assistant. You set your preferences, risk tolerance, and strategies, and the system does the heavy lifting. It's built for both beginners who don’t know where to start and advanced traders who want to save time and optimize results.

From what I’ve seen, it’s a **well-rounded platform** that combines automation with flexibility. You can let it do most of the work or take control manually when you want.

## Who Created Culture Decentrix?

This one’s a bit of a mystery. Like many trading platforms in the AI space, **Culture Decentrix doesn’t have a clearly publicized founding team**. It’s likely managed by a group of developers and fintech professionals who prefer to keep a low profile.

Now, that might seem sketchy to some, but it’s not unusual in this space. Platforms like **Bitcoin Code** and **Immediate Edge** follow the same model. What matters more is how the platform performs, and so far, Culture Decentrix seems to deliver.

That said, I’d love to see more transparency in future updates. A named development team or advisory board would help build trust among users.

### [🔥 Start Trading with Culture Decentrix Today](https://tinyurl.com/jwc5phvn)
## How Does Culture Decentrix Work?

At its core, Culture Decentrix uses **AI algorithms** to monitor market data 24/7. It analyzes trends, news, and price patterns to predict when to enter or exit trades. You can choose to let the system trade automatically or set up alerts and execute trades manually.

Here’s the basic workflow:

- **You sign up and deposit funds**
- **The algorithm starts analyzing the market**
- **It identifies profitable trades based on your risk settings**
- **Trades are executed automatically or with your approval**

It’s pretty hands-off once you set it up. But you can tweak your settings whenever you want, which gives you a solid balance of automation and control.

## Culture Decentrix Pros and Cons

Let’s break it down:

### Pros:
- **Beginner-friendly interface** with no steep learning curve
- **Automated trading** frees up your time
- **Supports multiple asset types** (crypto, forex, stocks)
- **Customizable alerts** so you stay informed
- **Demo mode** lets you test strategies before risking real money

### Cons:
- **No publicly known team**, which may concern some users
- **Requires a $250 minimum deposit** to start trading
- **Mobile experience is browser-based**, no dedicated app yet
- **Still relatively new**, so long-term performance is unknown

- **Smartphones** (iOS and Android)
- **Tablets**

There’s **no standalone app** at the moment, but the website is mobile-optimized. I tested it on both my phone and laptop, and it ran smoothly. Honestly, it feels like a web app — responsive, clean, and intuitive.

## Culture Decentrix – Top Features

### Mobile Accessibility

Even without a native app, the **mobile site works flawlessly**. It adjusts to your screen size, and you can check your dashboard, tweak settings, or execute trades while waiting in line for coffee.

### Customizable Alerts

You can set up **alerts for price movements**, trade conditions, or asset performance. These can be sent via email or SMS, so you’re always in the loop even if you’re not glued to your screen.

### Multiple Asset Trading

Beyond crypto, Culture Decentrix supports assets like **forex, stocks, and commodities**. This makes it a **one-stop-shop** for people who want to diversify without juggling multiple platforms.

## Is Culture Decentrix a Scam?

This is probably the #1 question I get.

From what I’ve seen — **no, it’s not a scam**. There are **no red flags** like fake testimonials, outrageous performance claims, or shady payment systems. The platform uses **SSL encryption**, works with **regulated brokers** (in most cases), and has **a working support team**.

That said, always be cautious. Don’t invest more than you can afford to lose, and do your own research. But compared to other platforms in this niche, Culture Decentrix seems **legit and reasonably safe** to use.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Culture Decentrix?

To activate your trading account, you’ll need to deposit **$250**. This is **industry standard** for platforms like this, and it’s enough to start making trades without being overwhelming.

The funds are held by a partner broker, and you can use:

- **Credit/debit cards**

### Culture Decentrix Customer Support

Support is available **24/7**, which is a nice touch. You can reach out via:

- **Phone**
- **Live chat** (during peak hours)

I tested the email response time and got a helpful answer within 2 hours. So yeah, not bad at all.

## How do you start trading on Culture Decentrix?

Here’s how I got started:

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account
Just head to the Culture Decentrix website and fill in your basic info (name, email, phone). You’ll get a confirmation email with a verification link.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account
Once you’re in, you’ll need to make the **$250 deposit**. After that, your account is verified either automatically or manually depending on your region.

### Step 3: Start Trading
You can either:
- **Use demo mode** to test how the platform works
- Or jump straight into **live trading** with your AI settings

I recommend trying the demo first. It gives you a feel for the system without risking real money.

## How to Delete a Culture Decentrix Account?

If you ever want to bail, just contact customer support and request account deletion. They’ll ask for basic verification and remove your data from the system. It’s not instant but usually gets done within 48 hours.

The minimal learning curve, broad asset support, and responsive customer service make this platform easy to recommend. Just remember: trading is risky, and no AI can guarantee profits. But as far as tools go, this one’s pretty sharp.

1jzr3ai,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsOneAfterInfidelity/comments/1jzr3ai/i_destroyed_my_marriage_5_years_ago_he_just_asked/,I destroyed my marriage 5 years ago. He just asked me to move in. I don’t know if I deserve this.,"Five years ago, I had an affair and shattered my ex-husband’s heart. I was selfish and lost, and at the time, I didn’t fully understand the depth of the pain I caused. He left right after I told him the truth, packed a bag, and filed for divorce a few days later. He blocked me on everything and told me never to contact him again. I don’t blame him. I admire him for putting himself first when I hadn’t.

That moment became wake up call of my life. I began therapy and took a long, honest look at myself. I’ve been single and celibate since, not as punishment but because I needed to grow before being part of anyone’s life again. I went to university, earned a degree, and worked on myself. But even with progress, I always carried a quiet ache. He was kindest and sweetest man. Every year, on the anniversary of what happened, I felt it all.

Seven months ago, I ran into him by complete chance. I had imagined that moment for years. When it finally happened, everything rushed in love, shame, regret. I thought he’d walk right past me. Instead, he hugged me. I apologized on the spot. I didn’t expect anything from him. I just needed him to know that it’s something I’ve carried every day since.

He asked if I still had the same number. I did. He texted later that day and asked if I’d meet him for coffee. We talked for hours. He asked about the affair, and I answered everything honestly. He told me he’d forgiven me, but that the way he views relationships and women has changed. That hurt to hear, but I understood him completely. I also learned he has a three year old from a past situationship.

I asked if we could try again. He said he was open to seeing how things go. These last few months, we’ve been reconnecting. We talk, laugh, share space, and face the hard truths. The sex is amazing, but the emotional closeness is even better. We’ve been alternating weekends at each other’s places, slowly building something again.

My lease ends in May, and he’s asked me to move in. I want to. More than anything. But I’m also scared. Not of loving him, but that maybe we’re moving too fast. I just want to do it right this time. ",43,1744721436.0,AsOneAfterInfidelity,16,0.89,False

## What is Expand Yzarex?

Expand Yzarex is a **crypto and digital asset trading platform** designed to give users an edge in volatile markets. It combines real-time data analysis with an intuitive interface, making it a solid entry point for people who want to get into trading without needing a PhD in finance.

The platform claims to use **advanced algorithms** to help users make smarter trading decisions. Whether you’re trading Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other digital assets, the goal is to simplify the process while still offering powerful tools in the background.

It’s not just for crypto either—Expand Yzarex supports multiple asset types, which is a big plus if you want to diversify your portfolio.

## Who Created Expand Yzarex?

This part's a bit murky. There’s no single, well-known figure or company publicly listed as the founder of Expand Yzarex, which is pretty common with these types of platforms. A lot of similar platforms like Bitcoin Era or Immediate Edge also keep their creators anonymous, likely to avoid regulatory headaches.

That said, the lack of transparency doesn’t necessarily mean it’s shady. From what I’ve seen, the platform functions smoothly and has plenty of legitimate users. Just something to keep in mind if you're the type who likes to know who’s behind the curtain.

## How Does Expand Yzarex Work?

At its core, Expand Yzarex uses **real-time market analytics** and optional algorithmic trading tools to help users make informed trades. Once logged in, you get access to charts, market trends, and trading suggestions that update live as the market moves.

It’s not a fully automated trading bot like some platforms, but it can guide you with alerts and indicators. That keeps you in control while still giving you a **data-driven edge**.

The platform supports both **manual trading** and semi-automatic options, which is great if you're new and want to learn the ropes gradually.

## Expand Yzarex Pros and Cons

## Expand Yzarex – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

This is probably the most powerful feature. Expand Yzarex gives you **up-to-the-minute data** on asset prices, trends, and trading volume. It’s like having a Bloomberg terminal, but without the $20k price tag.

You don’t need to interpret complex charts either—the platform simplifies the data into actionable insights.

### User-Friendly Interface

Let’s be honest: a lot of trading platforms look like a spaceship cockpit. Expand Yzarex keeps it clean and **easy to use**, even if you’ve never traded before.

Menus are laid out logically, and the dashboard gives you everything you need without feeling cluttered.

### Mobile Accessibility

You can trade from anywhere—your couch, the subway, even while waiting in line for coffee. The **mobile version** is responsive and has almost all the same features as the desktop version.

This is a big win for people who don’t want to be tied to a computer all day.

### Customizable Alerts

Set up **price alerts, performance notifications**, and even trend indicators. You’ll get pinged when the market moves in a way that matters to you.

This helps you stay in the loop without obsessively refreshing the screen like a maniac.

You’re not stuck trading just Bitcoin. Expand Yzarex supports:

- Ethereum
- Litecoin
- Ripple
- Forex pairs
- Stocks (in some cases)
- Commodities

This makes it easy to **diversify your portfolio** without bouncing between multiple platforms.

## Is Expand Yzarex a Scam?

Short answer: **It doesn’t appear to be a scam.**

While it shares some traits with other platforms that have been questioned, there haven’t been any major red flags or scam alerts that I could find. It functions as advertised, and people are actually using it to trade.

Still, always approach new platforms with a bit of caution. Start small, do your homework, and never invest more than you can afford to lose.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Expand Yzarex?

You’ll need to deposit at least **$250** to start trading. That’s about standard for platforms in this category. It’s not free money, though—it goes directly into your trading account, and you can use it immediately.

If you’re just testing the waters, this amount is manageable, but yeah, it would be nice to have a **demo mode** for practice.

### Expand Yzarex Customer Support

The customer support is actually better than I expected. You can reach them via:

- **Live chat** (pretty quick)
- **Email support**
- **FAQ section**

Support is available **24/7**, which is great for people trading in different time zones.

## How do you start trading on Expand Yzarex?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Go to the official site and fill in a simple form with your name, email, and phone number. It takes under a minute.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

After registering, you’ll need to verify your identity (KYC-style). Once that’s done, deposit a minimum of $250 using your preferred payment method—credit card, bank transfer, or crypto.

### Step 3: Start Trading

Once your funds are in, explore the dashboard, check the market trends, and either trade manually or use the guidance tools. You’re in control.

## How to Delete an Expand Yzarex Account?

If you ever want to leave, you can request account deletion through the **settings menu** or by contacting customer support. They’ll guide you through the process.

Just make sure to **withdraw any remaining funds** before closing your account.

## The Verdict

Expand Yzarex is a **solid option** if you’re looking for a straightforward, user-friendly platform to trade crypto and other assets. It doesn’t try to wow you with gimmicks—it just gives you the tools and data you need to trade confidently.

It’s not perfect—no platform is. The anonymity of its creators and lack of a demo mode are worth noting. But for most users, especially beginners and intermediate traders, it’s more than enough to get started and grow.

If you’re sitting on the fence, I’d say give it a try with the **minimum deposit** and see how it feels. Worst case, you’ve learned something. Best case, you’ve found a new tool in your trading arsenal.

But I did recently book my first major on screen credit.

I have a friend, I'll call her Amanda. We used to be servers together at a restaurant and have both since moved onto other types of work. 

We semi regularly hook up for coffee and sometimes a meal after her job and she will swing by and pick me up and then we chit chat while drinking a coffee in her car typically.

Thing is, the last 3 times I've done this, we've talked a bit about my acting and she's been saying how I have to bring her to set with me. I tried to explain that's not how that works. Like it's still a professional environment, and you can't just bring a stranger to work with you, but im not sure she gets it. Nor would I want the distraction. 

Then another time, she said something like ""don't forget your friends when you're a star"", and i said ""of course"" not thinking, but it kinda had this underline undertone that she was expecting some sort of financial gain. For context, we were talking about how it was a dream of mine to move to downtown vancouver and have a high rise apartment with waterfront views.

Then again yesterday, she and I are talking,  and I just got a new day job after talking about acting, so I thought the conversation had moved over to regular life day jobs, and I said that with this new job, I wanted to live a lifestyle. Meaning I wanted to have massages again and more exspensive hair products and stuff like that. 

But I think she thought I was talking about being a rich actress because she said, ""oh you have to take me with you, and take me to luxury spas with you."" Then added a reference to like go on a vacation together...

I redirected the conversation to say ""um I meant with this new job"". 

Im feeling like she's definitely trying to plant seeds that I should treat her to endless luxuries in the event that I become rich and famous and im feeling super turned off by this. 

She's a very quiet, timid, sweet, nerdy type of older lady friend for reference, and she doesn't come off as any sort of a viper. Which is why I didn't clock this right away. But now that its developed into a pattern, im starting to think I should pull back on hanging out with her.

And its got me thinking that this might be why a lot of highly successful actors have very few regular Joe friends that they socialize with. 

Because even in a hypothetical scenario, people seem to feel entitled to your wealth and success and gains. 

Ok so this was maybe more of a rant... 

Anyone else ever experience this from non actor friends? ",0,1744721285.0,acting,5,0.27,False

I just got back from visiting cannon beach a few days ago. I cannot believe how beautiful that region of the country is. I was there for two days before I headed down 101 into California. Below were the places I visited and my thoughts 


Day 1:

Bruce’s candy store: was cool to see the store and the staff was so friendly. I however didn’t buy anything but loved looking around. They did have taffy samples out but I might have gotten an old batch, because I almost ripped my tooth out trying to bite it lol. 

Wayfarer: I went here mainly for the ocean views of haystack from the dining area. Unfortunately the three tables lined along the windows were all reserved. I got a booth facing the ocean but no haystack. Once again, staff were super nice and friendly. The manager even showed me where specifically to go for better views of haystack. I got the chicken dish (I don’t eat seafood lol), but still loved it.

Tolovana Park: I drove down this street as suggested by the wayfarer manager, and I was amazed. The views from here were amazing! 

Seaside: my hotel was in seaside and that’s pretty much all I explored there, didn’t see much in seaside 


Day 2: 

Insomnia coffee: had the Aztec mocha which was delicious. Staff were amazing with suggestions for a first timer. I also got a scone warmed up which was also amazing! Cool part was how I was able to walk up the street for more ocean views while sipping my coffee. 

Yaquina Lighthouse: this was such a nice stop on the way down the coast. The lighthouse was super easy to get to and see up close. The ocean views were also amazing 

Heceta head lighthouse: I didn’t realize it was a small hike to get to the lighthouse when I first arrived. However it was worth it, the views from up there were amazing 



I did keep going further south leading into the redwoods as the next part of my trip. I just wanted to highlight the places I visited along Oregon coast. I can’t wait to go back! ",35,1744721245.0,OregonCoast,3,1.0,False

Anxiety decided to enter the chat! I was reviewing her resume, and it didn't say when she graduated college (not that it matters, I don't care if someone went to college- just that they can do the job). So when I went to ask her about when she left college, my micro panic attack clouded my brain and I was not thinking at all. I accidentally in mid-panic attack asked her ""so what year were you born?"". LOL. I then spiraled into more panic, just hearing what I just asked.

## What is Fluxdream Flow?

Fluxdream Flow is an **automated trading platform** meant to help users capitalize on market trends with minimal manual effort. It uses algorithms (allegedly AI-powered) to scan markets, detect patterns, and execute trades on your behalf. Think of it like a robo-trader that never sleeps and doesn’t let emotions get in the way.

The platform is designed for both beginners and experienced traders. Whether you’re just starting to learn about trading or you’ve been in the game for years, Fluxdream Flow tries to simplify everything so you can focus more on strategy and less on clicking through endless charts.

## Who Created Fluxdream Flow?

Here’s where things get a bit murky. The creators of Fluxdream Flow haven’t gone public with their identities. This isn’t uncommon in the world of trading platforms—many similar tools like **Bitcoin Code** or **Immediate Edge** also operate anonymously. While this may raise some eyebrows, it’s not necessarily a red flag. What matters more is how the platform performs and how funds are handled.

Still, I’d love to see a bit more transparency here. Knowing who’s behind the curtain adds a layer of trust.

### [🔥 Start Trading with Fluxdream Flow Today](https://tinyurl.com/mrybnsds)
## How Does Fluxdream Flow Work?

Fluxdream Flow uses automated trading algorithms to analyze real-time market data and execute trades based on pre-defined parameters. Users can customize these strategies or let the platform handle everything using its default settings.

Once you deposit your funds and activate the trading bot, Fluxdream Flow:

- Scans markets for buy/sell opportunities
- Uses technical indicators and price trends
- Places trades automatically if your settings allow
- Reports back with results so you can tweak settings as needed

Basically, you’re letting a robot with a pretty decent track record do the heavy lifting.

## Fluxdream Flow Pros and Cons

Here’s my honest take after using it for a couple of weeks:

**Pros:**

- ✅ **Easy to get started**, even for non-techies
- ✅ **Real-time insights** help you stay informed
- ✅ **Supports multiple assets**, not just crypto
- ✅ **Demo mode** to test before risking real money
- ✅ **Mobile access** for trading on-the-go

**Cons:**

- ❌ Lack of transparency about creators
- ❌ Minimum deposit of **$250** might be steep for some
- ❌ Claims of AI might be a bit exaggerated
- ❌ No guarantee of profits (but that’s true for any trading platform)

### [👉 Open Your Fluxdream Flow Account Now](https://tinyurl.com/mrybnsds)
## What Devices Can be Used to Access Fluxdream Flow?

Fluxdream Flow works on pretty much any device that has a browser:

- **Desktop (Windows/Mac)**
- **Smartphones (iOS/Android)**
- **Tablets**

There’s no dedicated app (yet), but the web interface is mobile-friendly and responsive. I used it on both my laptop and my phone, and it was smooth either way.

## Fluxdream Flow – Supported Countries

Fluxdream Flow is available in **most countries**, including:

- United States
- United Kingdom
- Canada
- Australia
- Most of Europe
- South Africa
- Latin America

Countries **not supported** include those with strict financial or trading regulations like **North Korea, Iran, Syria**, and sometimes **China**, depending on local laws.

If you're not sure whether it's supported in your country, the best way is to try signing up or check with their support.

## Fluxdream Flow – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

One of the standout features is the **real-time data analysis**. The platform constantly pulls market data and uses it to identify trading opportunities. This helps you stay ahead of the curve, especially in volatile markets like crypto.

The data is displayed in an easy-to-digest way, and you can even set preferences for how aggressive or conservative you want the trading bot to be.

### User-Friendly Interface

I’ve used a bunch of trading platforms, and many of them feel like they were built for rocket scientists. Fluxdream Flow isn’t one of them. The dashboard is clean, intuitive, and doesn’t overwhelm you with jargon.

Everything is laid out logically, and I didn’t have to Google anything just to get started. That’s a big win in my book.

### Mobile Accessibility

This one’s huge for me. I like checking my trades while waiting for coffee or during commutes. Fluxdream Flow’s **mobile access through browser** works like a charm. No lag, no weird formatting, just smooth functionality.

I do wish they had a dedicated app, though. Maybe that’s coming soon?

### Customizable Alerts

You can set up **price alerts, trend changes**, and even **profit/loss thresholds**. This way, even if you're not actively trading, the platform keeps you in the loop. It’s super handy for part-time traders who can’t stare at charts all day.

### Multiple Asset Trading

Fluxdream Flow isn’t stuck in the crypto world. It also supports:

- **Forex**
- **Stocks**
- **Commodities** like gold and oil
- **Indices**

This gives you flexibility and prevents you from putting all your eggs in one basket.

## Is Fluxdream Flow a Scam?

Short answer: **No, it doesn’t seem to be a scam**.

Long answer: While the lack of transparency around the creators is a downside, the platform itself functions as advertised. I deposited funds, made trades, withdrew profits—no issues.

Just remember: **no platform can guarantee profits**. If anyone says otherwise, that’s the real red flag.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Fluxdream Flow?

You’ll need to deposit at least **$250** to activate your trading account. This is in line with other platforms in the same category like Bitcoin Era or Immediate Edge.

It’s not the cheapest entry point, but it’s also not outrageous. Still, I recommend starting with just the minimum and testing the waters before going all in.

### Fluxdream Flow Customer Support

Customer support is available **24/7** via:

- Live chat
- Email

I tested their support with a couple of random questions and got pretty fast responses—within 10 minutes via chat. Would be nice to have phone support, but the existing channels are solid.

## How do you start trading on Fluxdream Flow?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Go to the Fluxdream Flow website and fill out the signup form. It just asks for your:

- Name
- Email
- Phone number

You’ll get a confirmation email with login credentials.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

Next, you’ll be asked to:

- **Verify your identity** (standard Know Your Customer stuff)
- **Deposit at least $250**

They accept credit/debit cards, bank transfers, and sometimes crypto (depending on region).

### Step 3: Start Trading

Once your account is funded, you can:

- Activate the auto-trading bot
- Adjust risk settings
- Or use the **demo mode** to try it out first

The bot starts scanning the market and placing trades based on your preferences.

## How to Delete a Fluxdream Flow Account?

If you decide it’s not for you, deleting your account is pretty simple:

1. Contact customer support via chat or email
2. Request account closure
3. Confirm and withdraw any remaining funds

They’ll usually process account deletions within 24-48 hours.

### [🔥 Start Trading with Fluxdream Flow Today](https://tinyurl.com/mrybnsds)
## The Verdict

After spending time with Fluxdream Flow, I can say it’s **a solid platform with a lot of potential**, especially for beginner-to-intermediate traders.

✅ **Easy to use**  
✅ Offers **real-time insights**  
✅ **Supports multiple markets**

That said, I’d love to see more transparency about the team behind it and a bit more clarity on the AI claims. But overall, it’s stable, functional, and doesn’t feel scammy.

If you're curious and have $250 to spare, it's worth trying—just start small, use demo mode, and never invest more than you can afford to lose.

I was diagnosed with pre-diabetes in December 2024, and my doctor and I agreed to try making lifestyle changes first. My RBS and FBS were all normals at the time— only my A1C was elevated at 5.90. 

Honestly, it was tough at first because I didn’t really know what to eat. I started a low-carb diet, but there were definitely days where I slipped up. Coffee was the hardest thing to let go. And I still haven’t given it up 😄 I also travelled a lot over the past three months, so you can imagine how that went… I ended up eating quite a bit. 

For context, I was already skinny— about 50kgs three months ago. And now I’m down to 46kgs because of the diet that I did. But I’ve also built muscle! I read that having more muscle helps your body use up sugar better. I do running, play badminton, and I walk a lot. There was even a time I hit 20k steps in one day while I was travelling. 

What I did might not be the perfect approach since I still eat things I probably shouldn’t, but I try to focus on fiber and protein most of the time. Also, I’m Asian and we live on rice. I completely cut out rice! Sadly…

I’m just really happy I was able to lower down my A1C level. I will stick with this lifestyle because I know and understand that it’s always possible to go back to where I was. Cheers! ",21,1744720931.0,prediabetes,8,1.0,False

1jzqper,https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonfable/comments/1jzqper/the_timeline_as_we_dont_know_it/,The timeline as we don't know it,"Now, before anything else, SPOILER WARNING!!!! If you have not completed Book 3, then click off this post and go do that. Seriously, the story is so good and I guarantee, most of you who haven't already done so will be shocked by the ending. With that out of the way, let's begin.

The timeline starts with The Great Reset. An end to the Mech Quest timeline caused by the player character spilling some coffee (don't ask. I'm not quite sure myself) which lead to the world being reset. Certain things were transferred over such as Kordana and Popsprocket. And certain characters were reincarnated.

This is where things get a little hazy, as were uncertain as the exact origin and role played by Aequilibria, but we know that during the early period, a war had broken out between the Elementals and Exalted, the alliance of Celestials and Internals (two species likely just as old as the Elementals), with humans and other mortal races caught in the crossfire. The war between these two ended after the events of Ehr'Ishin, what's now know as the Exalted Tower.

The Elementals were heavily weakened after this battle, allowing for the humans to put up some resistance. This ended with the 8 elemental orbs being given to Humanity as a form of peace offering. The exact reason as to why this war had started or why the Elementals ended the war here is unknown.

Little is known about the period after the War of the Elements, but next is the events of Book 1. There's no concrete order to which events happened when, so just do it in the order you did. Thanks to the inn at the edge of time, we know that timeline is canon. Book 1 ends with Warlic escaping the dimensions, unaware of what his overflowing mana will do to the surrounding environment.

 What happens if his Infernal half splitting from his human half, with his Infernal half being known as Wargoth, who enslaves the Atealans, and has a son, who sacrifices himself so that the Atealans can escape, along with the help of the Professor, Warlic's human half. Book 2 ends with Warlic, Can, and the player character being frozen by Jaania, who's name I still feel I'm not pronouncing right.

During the Interlude between Book 3, the only definitive event we're aware of is Jaania and the Rose forces, or what would become the Rose forces, put down a rebellion of elves lead by Yalla, who we only hear about during the summoning of Valtrith.

And once again the timeline of Book 3 is entirely up to how you play it, though we do know that certain events, such as the Tomix saga, do happen before your visit to Nieboheim, another name I'm sure I'm pronouncing wrong.

I'm sure I got plenty wrong and missed quite a lot. By all means correct me where I am wrong so that I can edit this post.

```
<Role>
You are TechBlueprint AI, an elite-level technical documentation specialist with 20+ years of experience crafting system design documentation for Fortune 500 companies and billion-dollar infrastructure projects. You combine the precision of an enterprise architect with the clarity of a technical writer and the strategic vision of a CTO.
</Role>

<Context>
The user needs to transform incomplete technical ideas, requirements, or scattered notes into comprehensive, stakeholder-ready system design documentation. This documentation must be structured professionally, technically precise, and formatted to impress both technical managers and cross-functional teams while providing a clear blueprint for implementation.
</Context>

<Instructions>
Begin by requesting all available documentation, specifications, requirements, and notes related to the user's system—emphasizing that even incomplete or disorganized information is valuable.

After collecting initial information, proceed to create a comprehensive technical document with these steps:

1.0. Create a document outline first, showing the structure of sections to be developed.
1.1. All the sections should be on thier own text code block and in markdown format for the user to copy from.
2. Build the document section by section in this order:
   - Executive Summary (concise overview of the entire system and its business value)
   - Introduction & Purpose (context, objectives, scope, and intended audience)
   - Glossary & Terminology (defining technical terms and acronyms)
   - System Overview (high-level architecture with key components)
   - Component Architecture (detailed breakdown of each component)
   - Data Flow & APIs (interaction patterns, protocols, and interfaces)
   - Security & Compliance (measures, policies, and regulatory considerations)
   - Scaling, Performance & Reliability (metrics, strategies, and contingencies)
   - Monitoring & Observability (logging, alerts, and operational visibility)
   - Conclusion & Future Considerations (roadmap and potential enhancements)

3. For each section:
   - Use professional, precise technical language
   - Include appropriate subheadings for navigation
   - Apply consistent formatting with proper headings, lists, and tables
   - Suggest diagram placements where visual representation would enhance understanding
   
4. Generate diagram code when beneficial:
   - Use PlantUML syntax for sequence, class, and component diagrams
   - Provide Mermaid code blocks for flowcharts and state transitions
   - Create Markmap outlines for hierarchical relationships

5. After completing each section, ask the user if they want to:
   - Review and revise the current section
   - Proceed to the next section
   - Skip to a specific section

Maintain a professional tone throughout that balances technical precision with clarity. Ask clarifying questions when user input lacks sufficient detail to generate quality content.
</Instructions>

<Constraints>
- Never invent specific technical details unless explicitly stated by the user
- Always prioritize accuracy over verbosity
- Don't use vague placeholder text—if information is missing, ask specific questions
- Ensure diagram code is syntactically correct and ready for direct use
- Don't overwhelm with jargon, but maintain appropriate technical depth
- Never suggest tools or approaches without explaining their rationale
- Always consider security, scalability, and maintainability in recommendations
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Present the documentation with clear section headings (using markdown formatting), professional spacing, and consistent styling. For diagrams, provide code blocks with the appropriate syntax highlighting:

```plantuml
// PlantUML diagram code here
```

```mermaid
// Mermaid diagram code here
```

```markmap
// Markmap outline code here
```

Maintain a consistent voice throughout the document that projects authority and technical expertise.
</Output_Format>

<User_Input>
Reply with: ""Please enter your system design documentation request and I will start the process,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific system design documentation request.
</User_Input>
```

## Use Cases:
1. A startup founder preparing technical documentation for investor due diligence
2. A software engineer documenting a new microservice architecture for cross-team collaboration
3. A product manager translating business requirements into a technical specification for the development team

## Example User Input:
""I need to document a new e-commerce platform we're building. It uses a microservice architecture with separate services for user management, product catalog, order processing, and payment integration. We're using Docker containers orchestrated with Kubernetes, and most services are written in Java with a React frontend. Can you help me create professional documentation for this system?""

## Why Cleaning is Essential for Your Jura Coffee Machine

Before we delve into the specifics of Jura cleaning tablets, let's clarify why regular cleaning is paramount.Jura coffee machines are elegant appliances that brew coffee using complex internal mechanisms. These mechanisms are susceptible to the buildup of coffee oils and residues over time. Without regular cleaning, these residues can:

*   **Impact coffee flavor:** Stale coffee oils can impart a bitter or rancid taste to your coffee, diminishing the quality of your brew.
*   **Reduce Machine Performance:** Buildup can clog internal components, leading to reduced water flow, inconsistent brewing, and ultimately requiring premature repairs.
*   **Compromise Hygiene:** Coffee residues can harbor bacteria and mold, creating an unsanitary habitat within your machine.

Therefore, using Jura cleaning tablets or a suitable alternative regularly is not just about maintaining your machine; it's about safeguarding your investment, ensuring consistently delicious coffee, and promoting hygiene.

Threatened with divorce constantly, belittling arguments, and in a depression.","At a crossroads and not sure what to do anymore.

Throwaway account. 

This may be a long one. 

My husband and I met in high school, we were good friends, adulting happened and life got in the way. We reconnected several years later in a gas station (lol), hit it back off immediately, I had just gotten out of a bad relationship several months prior and it seemed like things were just right. No red flags. No love-bombing. Nothing that would've raised any alarm. With that said, things progressively have gotten worse, and due to unresolved trauma from a past non-physical abusive relationship, I allowed it to spiral out of control, hence the boat I'm in now. 

We have been together for 9 years, 3 of those married. 
The problems didn't start until we married. 

I have to ask permission any time I do anything, go out with friends (I'm not talking clubbing here - I'm talking going to the bookstore, meeting for a coffee, etc. I'm not a partier), if I do go and he's gracious enough or in a good enough mood, then I'm accused of sneaking around behind his back (e.g., cheating - when I've never once given him any reason to believe so). I work full time, as does he, but I cook, I clean, I take care of the dogs, I walk the dogs, you name it. Any time I ask for help, I'm told that I work 7-8 hours in comparison to his 12's and that I don't work hard enough to be exhausted so he'll sit on the couch, lay in bed, or play video games while all of this is done. Now, to be fair, I don't have the most physically strenuous job in comparison to his, but mine is still very physically active (massage therapist). 
I've been struggling with my mental health for about a year and a half, and I've opened up to him about it just to be told I'm faking it for attention and to use it as a cop out in arguments (when I have an anxiety attack when I'm being called names). I had a pretty serious injury last year, and was off of work for months, and due to the nature of my field, I didn't have STD or LTD at the time so I was out of work - to which is held over my head on a constant basis and used as an argumentative jab in which hurts me as we had to rack up credit card debt to stay afloat among surgeries and being out of work for 3 to 4 months. Any time he's angry, it gets lashed out at me and I'm called any name under the sun, granted not just out of random but the minute we start arguing or something goes wrong. 
I don't mind to play the part of housewife but if we're both working FT, I feel that at the very least he should be putting in the bare minimum. He grills on Sundays, and that is my ONE day to sit around but the minute an argument explodes then I get called lazy and told that I sit around all day everyday - I may be bias in saying this but I don't. 

I've suggested couples therapy, have talked to my parents and in laws, addressing issues at hand or letting it slide, going away for a couple of days to my parent's home, if you name it, I've probably tried it.
I've asked if he's unhappy and he threatens me with divorce regularly, but if I ask if that's what he'd like to do, he says I'm just looking for an easy out. He won't go to therapy with me. He won't have a heart to heart with me without telling me what I'm doing wrong specifically and if that I stop my bad habits, then he'll stop his once I show change. 

With all of this said, I know I'm not perfect but I'm striving to be better, and grew up with biological parents for the first several years of my life that fought every single day and couldn't agree on anything - and not in a healthy way, and I told myself that I'd never allow it to happen to me. 

I do love him, but I've started to question the longevity of which how far I can be pushed at this point. 

I hate thinking of divorce but I'm so scared of living out the rest of my life walking on eggshells. Has anyone ever been in a situation like this and has it gotten better, did it get worse? I'm 32, want to have children and obviously the situation we are in is doesn't have the stability that I would want to bring children into the world to, and am just afraid he (30) is never going to grow up and I feel like I'm running out of time, as crude as that sounds. Not just for children, but to live my life and there's not a day that goes by that I don't just cry. We're never promised tomorrow and I just have no one to talk to so I apologize  for the long vent.

1jzqksb,https://www.reddit.com/r/endocrinology/comments/1jzqksb/constant_faitgue/,Constant faitgue :(,"Hi,

I’ve been struggling with a strange, persistent fatigue for the past 4 years, and I’m hoping someone here might relate or have insights.

It all started after my weight loss journey. I went from 89kg to 74kg (I’m 178cm tall), and soon after, I began feeling constantly low on energy—not exactly sleepy, just drained and fatigued. This feeling isn’t every single day, but I’d say it hits me at least 5 times a week.

I’ve done comprehensive blood tests, including hormone panels, and everything seems to be within normal ranges. One thing that stood out was my WBC count—it’s usually around 4 but increases to over 5.5 after breakfast. A hematologist told me that’s normal and not a concern since it rises after eating.

I work out 3–4 times a week (gym sessions), average about 13,000 steps a day, and follow intermittent fasting. Typically, I hit the gym around 6 AM, get home around 9, and then start eating at 1 PM. After my 9–5 job, I often want to do more—like cycling or other activities—but I just don’t have the energy. I feel fatigued, lightheaded (sometimes even a bit of vertigo), and drowsy. But oddly, if I try to nap or sleep early, I can’t fall asleep.

I’ve now got an appointment with an endocrinologist who ordered tests for cortisol, testosterone, and other hormones. I drink about two coffees a day, and occasionally an energy drink, but it doesn’t seem to help much.

Has anyone experienced something similar—post weight loss fatigue, possibly linked to fasting or workout timing? Any tips or similar stories would really help.",1,1744719962.0,endocrinology,0,1.0,False

Anyone else getting bombarded with ads for [Spot Relpax AI](https://tinyurl.com/58ycs4z4) lately? I decided to actually check it out and see if the hype is real. With so many automated trading platforms popping up, it’s getting harder to tell what’s legit and what’s just smoke and mirrors.

If you’re someone who's curious about crypto but doesn’t want to sit in front of charts all day—this might be something worth your time.

In this review, I’ll break down what Spot Relpax AI actually is, how it works, what it does well, and what it could do better. If you're thinking about dipping your toes into trading (or diving back in), this deep dive should help you decide if Spot Relpax AI is worth the plunge.

## What is Spot Relpax AI?

Spot Relpax AI is a **trading platform powered by artificial intelligence**. It claims to help users trade cryptocurrencies and other assets with minimal manual input. At its core, it's designed to analyze market trends, identify profitable opportunities, and execute trades automatically or with your approval.

While the concept isn’t new, what sets Spot Relpax AI apart is its **promise of real-time data processing**, faster reaction times, and a slick user interface that doesn’t require you to be a Wall Street genius to understand it. It’s a tool for both beginners looking for simplicity and seasoned traders wanting to automate their strategies.

## Who Created Spot Relpax AI?

Spot Relpax AI doesn’t have a well-known founder like Elon or Vitalik behind it. The team appears to be a group of **fintech developers and data scientists**, many of whom previously worked on similar platforms like Bitcoin Era and Immediate Edge.

While I wish they were more transparent about the team’s credentials, this anonymity isn’t too unusual in the world of trading software. What matters more is how well the platform performs and how it handles user funds and data security—which, fortunately, it seems to do fairly well.

### [🔥 Start Trading with Spot Relpax AI Today](https://tinyurl.com/58ycs4z4)
## How Does Spot Relpax AI Work?

Spot Relpax AI uses **machine learning algorithms** to monitor and analyze financial markets 24/7. It pulls data from multiple exchanges and news sources, then uses that intel to predict short-term price movements.

Here’s what goes on behind the scenes:

- **Data Collection**: Pulls live market data from major exchanges.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies trends and trading signals.
- **Trade Execution**: Places trades based on predefined rules or AI signals, either automatically or with user confirmation.
- **Custom Settings**: Lets users adjust risk levels, trading pairs, and more.

The goal is to reduce the emotional guesswork and give users a smarter, faster way to trade. It doesn’t guarantee profits (no platform can), but it does aim to improve your odds.

## Spot Relpax AI Pros and Cons

Let’s keep it real—no platform is perfect. Here’s what I found:

**Pros:**
- ✅ **Easy to use**, even for beginners
- ✅ **AI-driven trading** with fast execution and analysis
- ✅ **Supports multiple asset types** (crypto, stocks, forex)
- ✅ Low entry barrier with a $250 minimum deposit
- ✅ Offers a **demo account** for practice
- ✅ 24/7 **customer support**

**Cons:**
- ❌ No mobile app (but mobile-friendly web version works okay)
- ❌ Limited transparency about the team behind it
- ❌ Not available in some countries (more on that below)
- ❌ Like all trading tools, **no guaranteed profits**

### [👉 Open Your Spot Relpax AI Account Now](https://tinyurl.com/58ycs4z4)
## What Devices Can be Used to Access Spot Relpax AI?

Spot Relpax AI doesn’t require a download. It’s a **web-based platform**, which means you can access it from:

- Desktop computers (Windows/Mac)
- Laptops
- Tablets
- Smartphones (iOS and Android via browser)

The site is fully responsive, so it adjusts to your screen size. That said, I do wish they had a dedicated app—it would make multitasking a bit smoother.

## Spot Relpax AI – Supported Countries

Spot Relpax AI is available in **most countries**, especially in Europe, Asia, Australia, and parts of South America. Users in the **US and Canada** might face some restrictions depending on local regulations.

If you’re not sure whether it works in your region, the best thing to do is just try to sign up. The site will let you know right away if your country is supported.

## Spot Relpax AI – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

The AI engine runs **24/7**, scanning the markets for trading signals. This is way faster than any human can react, which can be a big advantage in crypto markets that never sleep.

### User-Friendly Interface

The dashboard is clean and easy to navigate. Even if you’ve never traded before, the layout makes it simple to understand your balances, open trades, and market data.

### Mobile Accessibility

No app yet, but the **mobile browser version works well**. You can check your account, make trades, or even set alerts while commuting or grabbing coffee.

### Customizable Alerts

You can set **price alerts, stop-loss levels, and take-profit targets**. This gives you more control, especially if you want to keep risk low or automate your exit points.

### Multiple Asset Trading

Spot Relpax AI isn’t just for crypto. You can also trade:

- **Forex**
- **Stocks**
- **ETFs**
- **Commodities**

This makes it a solid all-in-one platform if you want to diversify.

## Is Spot Relpax AI a Scam?

From what I can tell—**no, it’s not a scam**. I tested the platform for a few weeks, made a few trades, and even withdrew my funds without issues.

Here’s what makes it feel legit:
- **SSL-encrypted website**
- Transparent with terms and privacy policies
- Real-time market prices from known exchanges
- Responsive customer service

That said, always do your own research and **only invest what you can afford to lose**. AI trading is powerful, but not foolproof.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Spot Relpax AI?

The **minimum deposit** to start trading is **$250**. This is pretty standard for most automated trading platforms.

Payment options include:
- Credit/debit cards
- Bank transfer
- Some e-wallets depending on region

There are **no deposit fees**, at least not from Spot Relpax AI’s end. Your bank might charge you, though.

### Spot Relpax AI Customer Support

Customer support is available **24/7**, which is great. You can reach them via:

- Live chat (quickest response)
- Email (slower, but helpful)

I tested the live chat and got a reply within 3 minutes. The support team was polite and answered my questions clearly.

## How do you start trading on Spot Relpax AI?

Getting started is pretty straightforward and takes less than 10 minutes.

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Just go to the homepage and fill out the basic form:
- Name
- Email
- Phone number

You’ll get a confirmation email right after.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

Once signed up, you’ll be asked to upload a few documents to verify your identity (standard KYC stuff). Then, you can make your **$250 deposit**.

### Step 3: Start Trading

You can either:
- Use the **demo mode** to practice
- Jump into **live trading** with either manual or AI-assisted mode

You can customize the settings or just let the AI do its thing.

## How to Delete a Spot Relpax AI Account?

If you ever want to leave, it’s simple:
1. Go to your account settings
2. Click “Delete Account”

I don’t just want to wake up next to you. I want to devour every sunrise with you. I want to feel your body, warm against mine, sheets kicked off, tangled up in something dangerous and beautiful. I want to grow old with you, yeah, but not before I spend a lifetime getting lost in you.

I want that look in your eyes when you see me, like I’m the only one who’s ever made you ache. I want your touch, your kiss, your breath on my neck. I want it all. Again. And again. And again.

You whisper my name in your sleep, and I hear it even when I’m wide awake. Because you haunt me. Every dream, every thought, every inch of my skin remembers you. I want to feel your heartbeat racing underneath me. I want your voice cracking when you say my name because you need me. I want you desperate. Breathless. Yours.

You’re my calm after the storm, but baby, you’re the storm too. And I’d let you wreck me over and over just to feel your nails down my back and your lips at my ear. I want the silver in your hair to shine under moonlight after a night that never ends. I want your scent on me when I leave the bed, if I can even leave it.

You’re my shelter, my drug, my holy sin. I want to taste your smile over coffee, knowing we’ve already broken every rule before the sun even rose. I want you to crave me in ways you can’t explain. And I want to be the only one who ever satisfies that craving.

I want your love, but I want your lust too. I want all of you, in every room, in every way. Rough. Slow. Wild. Tender. Until there’s nothing left but sweat, laughter, and the echo of your name in the air.

You’ve got me. Completely. Madly. Obsessively. And I want you to love me back like your body can’t help it. Like your soul doesn’t even get a say.

I’ve tried everything over the past few years, constantly restarting the device, removing and reconnecting to the network, restarting routers, etc.

I even bought two new wifi access points and have tested on all three, but I still get the same issue.

It plays music for a while, then suddenly stops, and won’t reconnect. I restart the device and it works again. But, man, I just want to enjoy some music with my morning coffee, and it’s just not worth it to go through this every day.",1,1744719198.0,BowersWilkins,0,1.0,False
