I‚Äôm a 25 year old female and grew up in an alcohol free strict religious household. Only about 1 years ago I was able to afford moving in with my then boyfriend and since then my alcohol consumption has escalated from maybe once a week with friends (because i couldn‚Äôt drink at home), to every single night. It started with sharing a bottle of wine with my partner, and now has escalated to buying a bottle for myself for the evening, every day, and sometimes ending it with a cocktail. 
I don‚Äôt struggle with drinking from depression but truly from boredom. When I‚Äôm bored I just think- let me grab a drink! I also think that growing up with alcohol being such a huge ‚Äúsin‚Äù, made me truly idolize and look forward to drinking. I always wanted to cook dinner with a glass of wine (or 10 now!!), grab a cocktail with friends, or visit a beer garden etc. I GREATLY romanticized it in my teenage years and I think it‚Äôs a big factor in my current habits. 

I don‚Äôt feel out of control- I don‚Äôt feel like my life is ruined. But every time I think ‚ÄúI should do a ‚Äúcleanse‚Äù or an alcohol break for a few days/weeks/months, I feel this tightening in my chest‚Ä¶ THATS how I know I don‚Äôt have a healthy relationship with it. I‚Äôm so concerned about my health, and I feel like it escalated so quickly that now I‚Äôm just in shock at how I can stop‚Ä¶

The biggest obstacle that I can see is the fact that I live in a stunning town in Western Europe where drinking is SO commonplace at everyday/all day events. It feels like I‚Äôm on vacation everyday! 
If I meet my friends for coffee in the morning, by lunch we‚Äôre all sharing a bottle. Any event or activity we do usually is accompanied by an artisanal beer, wine, or cocktails. 

I am fine with not buying it and having it in the house, but I don‚Äôt trust my ability to not consume it with my friends. It‚Äôs hard being the odd man out.

Hearing my position, my drinking habits, etc, 
Please give me some advice, anything!

Pretty much self-explanatory, would I be allowed to bring caffeine pills inside the festival?  
I dislike the taste of coffee and these help making it through the end.

However I reckon how suspicious bringing pills into a festival will look. I'm sure it'll be fine at DV, but what about inside the festival?  
I understand that, as a minimum, I should bring the whole bottle they come in, but given that it'll be opened, will that be a problem?

I checked if anyone asked already, but only found old posts.

Adding a pic of what the bottle looks like.

Thanks!

1ljbyhc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ljbyhc,"Grand Hyatt Singapore, Newly Renovated for 2025: a full review","TLDR: gorgeous renovation throughout, a WOW breakfast, lovely club, pool that‚Äôs a slice of urban tropical paradise, and attentive service = my other favorite Hyatt hotel. 

Arrival: just 25 minutes from the coolest airport I‚Äôve ever been in, we arrived at a jewel box lobby that said tropicalsexycool. No upgrade offered above the Grand Suite (their standard suite) that I‚Äôd booked with cash + an SUA at check in. But it was ready an hour early so I said yes please. 

The Room: chic meets gorgeous. They nailed the renovation here with a sweet little entry + bar area, pitch black automatic shades, full walk in closet, good sized living/dining area separated by pocket doors from the bedroom. King felt oversized, bathroom certainly was including 2 sinks, and a separate area for shower and toilet which included a bidet. Lots of modern tasteful touches like the simply laid out light controls, bidet, lovely glassware for drinks and coffee. 

The Club: decent small tea 2-4pm with a few snacks. NA drinks available all day, alcohol only served 5:30-7:30pm but a nice selection of wines, beers and cocktails all of which are pour your own. Dinner was one hot bar with a few hot plates and then some of then basic snack and hors d‚Äôoeuvres. Tasty, not outstanding. The look is so well done, think sexy lounge, and I barely felt cool enough to be there. 

The Service: warm and professional throughout the hotel. Housekeeping came twice daily. Our youngest had a cold the second day so we had the privacy light illuminated, and housekeeping even came at 8pm (upon request) to tidy up. 

Breakfast: holy shit. Most fabulous breakfast buffet I‚Äôve been to. Felt like it went for half a mile. Loved the way they grouped it into 5-7 different styles of food (Chinese, Malay, Indian, western, etc) and had attentive staff there to help out or answer questions. My favorite was the Indian chef preparing paratha and other breads off his hot griddle behind glass. Servers were on top of plate clearing. Everything I had was somewhere between yum to wow (and occasionally, huh, never had that before). I could go on and on. 

The Incident: my wife cut her lip on a chipped glass at our first breakfast. The staff were all over it, apologetic. The food director sent up a high end bottle of Moet champagne and a hand written note, then followed up with a ‚Äúlet me know if there‚Äôs anything I can do‚Äù email to which I replied, ‚ÄúDinner?‚Äù, to which he said a reservation is waiting for you and didn‚Äôt charge us a dime for the ~$250 meal for my wife/2 kids/me. 

The Pool: is a 5ish minute enclosed walk from the main building (which houses The Club, Straits grand buffet where globalist/club breakfast happens, and two other restaurants) to the Terrace wing which has another bar/restaurant called Oasis and the spa/gym. I absolutely loved the large almost get lost tropical oasis they created by the smaller wellness pool as well as the much larger main pool. Lots of seating tucked in among the tropical plants, no ‚Äúpay extra cabanas‚Äù. During our 3 visits to the pool there were an average of 5-15 people there at any one time. Gym/spa feels high end, clean lines, a little serious. 

The Location: central, right next to Orchard Road shopping and MRT stop. Also adjacent a couple of malls with all the designer brands. Felt hip, happening, youngish, jet setter ish. 

The Complaints: if I have to come up with something, the views from the rooms are nothing special (unless perhaps you got one overlooking the pool area), and the club offerings are just good/great and not exceptional.

Points vs Cash: For our June dates, the room was 25K/night, or $310/night all-in ($535 for suites). That‚Äôs about 1.2 CPP, so I chose to pay cash for the three nights and used a Suite Upgrade Award (SUA). Cash particularly made sense when adding the 9,860 points from using the WOH card. I‚Äôd value club access which includes that killer breakfast at ~$75 per adult per day‚Äîeven more if you drink alcohol‚Äîor about $200‚Äì$250 per day for a family of four. 

Vs. Grand Hyatt Hong Kong: since I just spent 6 nights at Grand Hyatt Hong Kong I‚Äôll add that GHHK wins on views, service and Grand Club, while GH Singapore wins on pool, breakfast and aesthetics. I‚Äôd say tied on location, value, and the standard suites.

On Saturday morning he was brought into an emergency spinal surgery that will determine if he will ever walk again. 

Saturday morning my mom had called me to let me know about the surgery. I had stepped off the floor to take her call. The manager told me that my daddy's issues aren't krogers issues and kroger isn't doing the surgery so I need to get off the phone.

Fast forward to last night.  I was in the back doing fresh start, printing my new order guide and putting my order on. I had literally 20 minutes left of my shift. My mom calls me because she fell asleep while driving home from the hospital. My poor mom is exhausted, she works 7 am to 6 pm monday - Friday, is on call Saturday and sunday, and is now driving 45 minutes to the hospital to see my dad then 45 minutes home. So to keep her awake while driving we just discuss what fresh start is, why I need to print a new order guide each period, the difference between bouquets, why I hate the  new spray rose bouquet, I ask if she ate yet today (shes diabetic but full of bad habits), etc etc etc. 

The manager storms out of the office and tells me shes going to fire me for being in my phone on the clock. Im like dude my mother is falling asleep while driving. Im just trying to keep her awake. Give it a rest. She tells me that it isn't up to kroger to keep my mom awake and if she wrecks she wrecks, tell her to go drink a coffee or something.

Ngl, he was my favorite haha kase he was really good in bed. Iniiwasan ko siyang makita kase parang di ko kaya magpigil (ng galit? lol), and knowing him, ang lakas ng charisma niya and he really knows how to play the game. Though I know in myself that I must be ready everytime I go sa centro kase there's always a possibility that we will meet. Wala naman akong masyadong update sa kanya, pero I know lumalaki at dumadami business nila dito sa city. 

I got hungry and I feel like getting some coffee after hitting the gym, so nagpunta ako sa cafe malapit lang sa kung saan ako nag gym. May pumasok na guy and bigla akong kinabahan, and nagpapanic na ako in my head, wishing na sana hindi siya kase putangina baka sasabog ako.

Tangina, it's really him... He gained weight, lumaki tiyan niya, tapos nagkabalbas na wow uncle na talaga datingan niya eh. Girl he used to be so fit kase naggym yun way before (I love gym rat guys haha) and I'm so into tall buff guys, ewan lakas ng dating nila for me. 

We ended up things na hindi okay hahahaha. Ang funny lang kase fubu lang naman kami, pero nag-away kami. Just because I wanted to stop doing it with him, eh ayaw niya nun LOL, but the reason was, may girlfriend pala siya that time. I'm not proud of that of course, and I swear wala akong kaalam-alam nun. He was really good at hiding din. Isa na din sa factor na I was just there for the deed, kaya di ko na siya masyadong inalam kung sino at ano siya kase in the first place, di naman ako interested sa personal life niya. Pero at the end of the day, nalaman ko paren. 

He didn't approach me inside the coffee shop, pero nung I went out na, I did not know sinundan niya pala ako. He asked me if we could go somewhere and chat a little bit kase he wanna say something important saken. I didn't see him sus naman, so pumayag ako. 

First thing he did, nag apologize saken. I didn't tell his girlfriend about it, I know na dapat sinabi ko, pero I got panicked and I really didn't know what to do back then. The moment kase that I found out na I was the ""other woman"", kinain ako ng galit ko talaga, kase he was showing motives na din saken nun na gusto niya ako, that he wanted us to be from fubus to lovers ba. Hinding hindi ko kaya maging kabit kase hindi ko deserve yun. Kaya lumayo ako, and he never heard of me after that kase blocked siya lahat saken on social media. Good thing talaga na hindi din ako nagaaral dito samin, kaya out of sight, out of mind naman talaga. Nadagdagan din galit ko nun sa kanya kase everytime na magspend ako ng summer vacation dito samin, nakakasalubong ko madalas friends niya, pero the way they stare at me, parang alam na alam nila ganap namin before. Isa sa mga ayaw ko talaga yung parang pinagsisigawan na we did the deed and shits, parang tanga lang. In short, aware friends niya pala about samin and they tolerated his kagaguhan.

He then told me na ikakasal na daw siya, but not with the girl he cheated on with me. They broke up kase naging honest siya sa ex girlfriend niya nun. After I ghosted him, he tried to reach out on me paren, and nakita yun ng girl, nahuli siya at di na rin niya kayang magtago kaya sinabi na niya yung totoo. Pero after a couple of months, nakahanap naman na siya agad ng bagong girlfriend, na fiancee na niya ngayon. Nalaman ko rin na siya rin pala owner nung coffee shop hahahaha hay nako. 

He feels like he owes me big time just because I stfu, and never told anyone about samin nun, kaya parang I deserve to know daw. Ayun umuwi naman akong kumpleto at walang nangyare ah. 

I hope na he's not gago anymore kase despite of his past, may naging willing paren na i-accept siya :)

1ljbsni,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ljbsni/long_relationship_and_marriage_ended_between_my/,"Long relationship and marriage ended between my ex (35F) and I (35M), polar shift in perceived situation and dreams for future at the end of a miserable process","Greetings everyone,

This is not a short (and might not be the most coherent) write-up but I‚Äôm looking for perspective for my, by as of now, ended marriage due to very wild turn of events.

Basis: 35M (me) and 35F, together for 15 years, were married for 10, one 10-year old child. Well-off for our age, both on good career paths, perfect fa√ßade from outside. 

The major grounds for divorce were the disappearance of romantic gestures, and need disparity in cleaning, personal interests and intimacy. Wife initiated divorce after I had been adamant in doing a large (1000 sqft) terrace project for our house last summer by myself without asking help from anyone and I got really frustrated after one error and cursed the bad mana out for 5 minutes straight before fixing the mistake and continuing.

Backstory: Both had felt that the relationship had not included any of the romantical (dates, gestures, ‚Äúseeing the other person‚Äù) aspects for a long time and the relationship. We had resorted to just running the ship; being happy with our child, going about day-to-day life, advancing careers, no big worries but also no dreams to speak of.

I‚Äôm not a person who lives in filth or likes disarray, but wife has always had a huge need to have a pristine house, thus I have always felt that I cannot live up to this standard because in an otherwise totally clean house, a single loose item on a counter can make her feel as if the house is dirty and cause her to feel lethargic. I.e., if understood as a threshold to initiate cleaning, my threshold to start cleaning automatically is higher and I have felt guilty if I have not noticed it and she feels sad about perceived uncleanliness. This has been a major pain point in our relationship for a long time.
We have always watched series and movies together, we have also done many different sporting and exercise activities together over the years, done trips around the world, local yearly trips, normal stuff. While highly educated, our professional fields are as far apart as they can be with hers being much closer to average day-to-day talk  (yet still on a higher level). I‚Äôve always felt that she would not care at all about my work topics and I‚Äôm okay with that, and I‚Äôve always tried to keep up when she wants to go through some issues in her work and field, hanging on by thread but happily nodding along, trying to get in a witty question or two. I have felt that when there is something I would have liked to open about, there is absolutely zero interest about it and she would rather do something else. While still something that would be okay, this has been a recurring behaviour from her on my personal topics of interest as well that I have tried to make known I like to just tell about what I found facinating (e.g., new household projects, technology, space, trade) and I know I have deliberately tried to return the favor in past times because of frustration.

Another major thing has been the disagreement with how we (mostly I) handled the first year of raising our child. She felt that I was not there to support her and that I was with my friends every weekend (not nights, just a day in a weekend), leaving her alone. While I do not have a record of the actual number of days spent away during the year, I have the understanding that it was probably one to two weekends a month at most. This was a topic we went through earlier on but during the divorce process it came up that there was no forgiveness given about this. Additionally, after the first discussions earlier on, there has been guilt on my part in spending time away from home and we get to the next problem.

I like(d) to play with my friends and game in general. I thought that maybe it would be then nice to be with my friends by gaming with them instead, being able to react to anything that arises in our home. While we gamed together earlier in our relationship, she discarded it citing it as a waste of time and I thought that it cannot be a waste of time if I like to do it as a hobby (very variable profile throughout years, sometimes more, sometimes less; in apex ‚Äúmore‚Äù times probably around 5 days a week 1-2 hours on average; apex ‚Äúless‚Äù times around 2 days a week 1 hour). I know during ‚Äúmore times‚Äù it was borderline problematic from her perspective but also that I used it to phase out my bad feelings. For past years, I have felt guilty about opening up the computer.

The last point I would like to raise is intimacy. I have always wanted to be touched and I have always wanted to touch. Disregarding the first few years, my wife has been the opposite of this. For a long time, my touch has not felt good to her and I have felt like I would do anything for even the lightest or caresses towards me. I stopped trying to initiate sex because of being turned down. I now learned that for the past years, she had been initiating sex out of duty because she had felt I was grumpy after a certain time without it but that she had not found enjoyment in it. The reason she did it had completely eluded my thought and I felt devastated for her having the need to do so. She has now described that her want would have needed to be based on feeling cared for, feeling being seen.

Divorce process in our country: two-staged; first application opens a half-year consideration period after which the second application can be filed to finalize the divorce process. Second-stage application needs to be submitted within 6 months of the consideration period having ended or the divorce process is annulled. Submitting the second-stage application (unilaterally or by either party) finalizes the divorce upon submittal. The divorce was initiated by her; I fought the grounds for the divorce and saw that we can work through them, quite adamantly I saw that we had all things in order, just forgot who we were individually and who we were supposed to be together.

Timeline: Divorce initiated early fall of 2024 (2nd stage application possible after mid Feb 2025). During the early phase we tried counseling and self-thought ways to find romance again. There were good times and I got vastly better at describing my feelings (here another such write-up as this would be in order) through seeing a psychologist, something I always thought she was much better at, leading me to just submit in arguments because I could not organize my thoughts and share them. Anyway, it always ended in me hearing from her that she just does not feel anything towards me and how the sex is something she would not see herself having (with me at least) even if we stayed together and back to being defeated I got. There were many such situations before the year‚Äôs end. Ultimately she admitted that she has had troublesome thoughts for much longer (from childhood) than she had ever opened up to me about and that she finally admits that seeing a professional would be of best interest (until now she had not wanted to receive a diagnosis in to her records). She got some medication for her condition and was a completely different person; I fell for her in this state hard again. She was very forthcoming and open, something that I found very appealing as much of our disagreements usually arose from me not being able to read between the lines and she being disappointed in me not instinctively understanding something she thought obvious. Also she was, well, lusty. I somehow understood that on an abstract level, the person I now found desire for does not exist per say and told her that. She agreed but was not really sad about it.

For all the time during this process, I feel like she was guilty about wanting to divorce me and while mostly positive comments (I got told that I will find a person who likes me, I should be brave, I should move on etc.), I got some very negative as well (she does not see me as an interesting person, she does not see that we have anything in common etc.). I still held up the thought of fixing things. During year‚Äôs end we had a discussion and as a result of much crying, we decided to end the relationship and move on to finalizing the divorce. From this point on, I decided that I have to bury any feelings for her and especially the idea of us being together. That was hard and I felt so worthless, not seeing myself as an appealing person let alone partner to anyone. We tried a few more times to just to spend time together but it felt forced. During the time, on my wife‚Äôs behest, I also had a coffee with another woman that ended up in very jealous reaction from my wife, warranting me to return home from said occasion to high praise of abandoning the other woman for her upon my arrival. But any positive feeling from my wife‚Äôs side again died very fast. Also I had kind of tuned to think that I was a horrible person towards her during our marriage due to my communication and household upkeep shortcomings, not to mention not having noticed she was doing a duty-mode in sex.
I moved out of the house almost at the instant that the consideration period was ending (I thought it the best for both of our sanity, limbo state living together and avoiding each other was eating at least myself inside out) but neither of us submitted the 2nd stage application because our property had not been divided yet. I submitted to the failure of seeing anything worth salvaging for and felt nothing for months and nothing really happened in the divorce process, just time ticking out of the 2nd stage submittal deadline.

A month ago she was on a trip and I decided to try to find anything to feel instead of misery and got on a dating app. I stumbled upon a woman who seemed genuinely very interesting both physically and from similar interest perspective and we got around to have some coffee and after-work on another day. I was smitten. I really did not know what I had set out looking for but I was not ready for how great spending time with her is. She is genuinely interested in what I am like, what I like to do, what I think about, she likes to caress me and can communicate how she likes to be touched. She‚Äôs also slightly awkward in the most cute way I cannot better describe; very genuine. We‚Äôve kissed some but I was hesitant to move forward, she was ok with this and supportive because I was quite open about what my situation is. I am also a one woman show sexually so far but there is great interest from also mine but definitely from her part to move forward.

And we get to the wild turn of events. Having seen this other woman and really getting a hefty amount of exquisitely good feelings mentally for having seen her, my wife kind of got a hunch through our child that I might have been seeing another woman and went ballistic, calling me a pig and so on. Turns out she had gotten a diagnosis for her mental illness and another type of medication than during last year. Even before the diagnosis and starting new medication, she had written a letter. A very beautiful letter how she finally sees how in vain all of our differences were and how she now sees what I saw; a possibility to overcome them and continue together. Half a year ago the letter would not have been a lifeline to me drowning, it would have dried the sea around me. But now I felt like a horrible person for subduing my belief in our relationship and feelings for her, my leg half out to moving on. She also submitted the 2nd stage application by herself and I got scolded for going out with a woman while we still had not submitted it (we finalized the property division before she left for the trip though). A few days I got shat on verbally as she had just started the new meds and those include heavy mood swings. Now that phase has passed and she is very expectant of us getting together, painting a beautiful picture of how she now sees that it has been the sickness for so long preventing her from being herself and there is such sadness in her when I cannot say (I feel like I do not want to do any decision) can I see us back together, married or not. I know I also have been subduing my feelings towards this another woman and she seems very keen on meeting even casually with me and I feel like a terrible person towards her as well for thinking that the ex-wife and I could probably have the future I earlier this year abandoned thinking of.

I am at a loss with this all. I know that there is uncertainty in all decisions, I know that I am subduing my emotions towards everyone. I know that there is not a decision where no one will get hurt. I am a deer in headlights.

Need for advice: I do not seek direct advice but rather perspective, a reality check. I know I should be selfish with my decision, I just cannot help feeling bad for either my ex-wife (I feel so so sad for her to come to this realization now and how I am just about to move on) or this other woman (she is so genuine and tickles my long-lost feelings just right). Overall I just feel like I don‚Äôt deserve anyone, being the piece of shit that caused my ex-wife‚Äôs misery for years by not being able to see what was wrong and defaulting to being passive, and my instinct is to accept that keeping the family together and finally being able to be there for my ex-wife would be the best and we can probably rediscover the happiness we lost. My heart on the other hand screams that nothing has fundamentally changed; I had made the decision to move on with the information I had and processed through ten months of misery and that I have stumbled on something unique I don‚Äôt even fully want to comprehend yet.

I (F22) and my ex (M23) broke up a week or two ago. We were originally friends, which grew to be something more, in a relationship for 3 months, then last week he suddenly broke up with me. i was head over heels in love and did not see this coming. we met up a few days later to return our things and have a chat for closure (mainly for my sake as he didnt give me an explanation at the time), where he explained that after a while our relationship felt less romantic and more like we were roommates. I was staying with him alot, my understanding was that we both wanted that routine, but i understand looking back that I was probably codependent and he wasn't speaking up about his true wishes. but long story short, he just wasn't feeling like we were working out, totally valid and fair and I've made my peace with his decision.

Now a bit of backstory about both me and him before catching you up to today-

Ex suffered with a bad c0k3 addiction before we knew each other. he's been through alot, including rehab, and now to this day he stands being over 500 days clean! he has worked so hard and continues to, to make this his life and I couldn't be prouder of him. he still attends weekly support group meetings and will continue to for a long time, he's now also volunteering at the sessions and is looking for a job similar to this.

as for me, I'm not an addict myself, but addiction runs in both sides of my family and I've had alot of trauma in my life surrounding people around me using. the most prominent being my dad, who was an addict who eventually committed suicide when I was very young. certain things happened which led me and others to blame myself for this event and I carry alot of abandonment and trust issues with me, along with quite a fragile sense of self that im realising about myself right now. there are many other people and experiences that I could list which is relevant to this trauma, but I'd be here all day. it mainly stems i think from me being the youngest and last addition to an already dysfunctional family and adding more stress to my familys situation. other family members and many close friends also used or relapsed or died extremely close to me in drug related matters. things that I always look back on and wish I had made more effort even though I was just a child. 
my childhood trauma was extremely challenging to work through, but with alot of therapy and alot of self work, I genuinely believed that I could put that part of my life behind me. in fact, being in a relationship with Ex actually healed alot, seeing someone that I love in recovery gave me so much faith and happiness for others who are struggling.

So as of today, me and Ex met up to exchange a few more things back and to grab a coffee. we've both agreed that we would love to be friends, and that there's no bad blood between us. things were a little awkward but overall it was genuinely nice to see him and I was feeling hopeful that we could both form a friendship again with true intentions on both sides. 
Eventually I noticed that he seemed very upset, so I checked in with a ""hey, are you sure you're okay? you know you can talk to me if you need to, this is a safe space and I'm here for you"". to which he responded that he feels sad that he doesn't have any close friendships right now, and that if he were to have a bad evening and go out, he would relapse with some drinks. 

it took me totally by surprise. this person who I genuinely think the world of, who I look up to so much, I care unconditionally about, and who seemed so absolutely sure of himself, is feeling so alone that he's considering relapsing. I'm so sad for him. I can't imagine what he's going through and I just want to help him and make sure that he stays on track with his sobriety. but, I dont know if i can do that. we went our own ways shortly after he mentioned this because he needed to get home, and as soon as I was inside my home I had a panic attack. it was so bad that I debated calling an ambulance in case I was having a heart attack. so many old wounds reopened and I am terrified that I am a curse for people with addictions. 

how do I stop hurting people? I don't want to trigger people. I genuinely just want to love and make sure people are okay, and it seems that im in this cycle of fucking peoples lives up without even trying. does my presence really hurt people that bad that they're forced to relapse?
this situation is extremely triggering for me, but I can't say that to him, can I? that his trigger is triggering me?

How is it looking so far? I am sure there are inaccuracies as some wikis have conflicting information.

1ljboce,https://i.redd.it/y6uu81rvpv8f1.jpeg,Third Machine; First Gaggia Classic,"TLDR: I bought a GCP E24 after good experiences with multiple machines and am surprised how good it is stock/out of the box.



I recently purchased this Gaggia Classic Pro E24 from Whole Latte Love and so far I have really enjoyed my decision.

Background; I‚Äôve been making espresso for 8 years, first as a barista at a small chain shop, and now at home. After leaving the coffee shop I got my hands on a Breville Dual Boiler and used that for 4 years and I didn‚Äôt really have an issue. Being able to steam and pull shots at the same time is probably the biggest benefit of that machine. After that I purchased a used Delonghi Dedica with the steam wand upgrade and basic espresso accessories. I bought the Delonghi as a temporary machine while I did some traveling and moving. All Ill say about that machine is, boy is that thing capable for its size. I think a used Dedica is possibly the cheapest way to get into good espresso.

Now I have the Gaggia, and although I‚Äôve only had it for a week, I think this is my favorite one so far. I fully intend on upgrading it eventually but I am astonished on how capable it is out of the box. I drink a lot of milk drinks and the common consensus on its steaming ability concerned me slightly. Maybe I went in thinking it would be pretty bad but I am thoroughly impressed with the steam pressure and consistency. As I use the machine more, maybe Ill find its steaming flaws but initial thoughts are extremely positive. The other major concern was with the temperature inconsistency, and however I will probably run into that down the line, as it sits currently, I haven‚Äôt had an issue. I‚Äôll typically pull 1-3 shots in a row depending on the day and steam roughly 6-10oz of milk at a time. I almost want to do the basic PID, Steam wand, and other mods rather than go with Gaggimate or Gaggiuino, but I plan to use it in its stock configuration for a year or two before anything major.

I met a woman in 2021 who I had a really intense platonic friendship with but lost contact with. At the start of the year we ran into each other in the most unlikely of circumstance. 

It started out feeling platonic but quickly started to feel like she was trying to seduce me and I developed some limerence about her. Over coffee I told her that I had a crush on her but regardless of this I didn‚Äôt believe either of us were in a space where we could be together.

She told me that she also had a crush on me and that it was a relief that we weren‚Äôt going to take it any further as she was ‚Äúa runner‚Äù and ‚Äúdestroyed people in relationships‚Äù.

So with the air cleared we just went ahead and became quite enmeshed emotionally. I‚Äôm thinking of just going ahead and trying to take the relationship with her to the next level. I guess I‚Äôm worried about the ethics of it for a couple of reasons some being 1) that she kind of let me know she wanted to have some boundaries on a romantic relationship 2) I‚Äôm convinced that I‚Äôm too jealous/insecure to be in a relationship with a woman who is so vivacious/flirty 3) I have a history of making it work for way longer than it works with woman with cluster b disorders.

Any feedback?

I kind of feel that we have been able to maintain a really authentic relationship over the past 5 months‚Ä¶

I am having an outdoor wedding in October and would really love to have a small coffee station set up out there. My fiance and I and many of my friends enjoy a good coffee so I would like it to be kind of quality with at least locally roasted beans. 

I have reached out to a few ‚Äútruck‚Äù like setup options and they are mostly $500+ which is out of my budget. I‚Äôd really rather not spend over $200 on coffee and all supplies if I can help it. 

Does anyone have any ideas of how this could be done without just putting low quality large batch Dunkin‚Äô Donuts brewed coffee out there?
My next thought was having drip coffee, something like a large chemex set up and grabbing my own beans locally. 

Thanks in advance!!",3,1750772997.0,lexington,5,1.0,False
1ljbl1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ljbl1a/my_things_keep_disappearing/,My things keep disappearing,"About three years ago I finally bought a house. Huge achievement (for me at least) 
And I was so proud of myself. I had graduated collage with a bachelors in electrical engineering, had gotten a nice paying job at a place that designs microcontrollers for everyday hobbyists. 

My house wasn‚Äôt huge, nor was it in the biggest part of town, but it was still a decent house. 3 room, 1 bathroom (with a nice shower), 1 huge walk in closet (though I never filled it). It was a nice house.

About a year ago things started to go missing. At first it was my coffee cups, then food. It was never enough for me to be worried, I am an incredibly unfocused person, and have lost my wallet on multiple occasions. It was never anything major, but it was definitely a bit annoying. However it got worse when my front door began to unlock itself.

There were multiple occasions when  I would close my door and lock it behind me, only for me to come back home, and it be completely unlocked, sometimes even slightly ajar. Again, I chalked it up to my scatterbrain, but it was still a little odd. Eventually I realized that the little metal nub, the part that keeps the door locked and closed was gone. It was just not there. It spooked me, I talked to the police (there had been break ins near me before), but since nothing could be confirmed stolen, and there was no evidence of any actual person, and there was no actual sign of a break in (no broken parts, nothing definitive) they couldn‚Äôt really do much. They told me to buy  something like a ring camera if I‚Äôm still spooked, so I did.

It had been a year, nothing had happened, nothing had seemed to go missing. I got a girlfriend finally! We had been dating for about 8 months, when she came over to my house to watch this new show with me. We were about 2 episodes in when I really had to go use the bathroom. When I came back, she was completely gone. Her car was in the driveway, I saw it out the window, but she was not there. I called her phone, but she didn‚Äôt pick up. The bowl of popcorn she was eating was gone. The pillow she was holding was gone. I was really worried, so I went to go outside when I realized the handle to my door handles were gone.

I was looking for my phone, but it, and my wallet where both no where to be seen, even though they where in my pocket only moments ago. I ran to the neighbors, I thought was losing it. I called her number on there phone, and then the polices. The police thought that it was a break in, and were worried that my girlfriend was in danger, and then I remembered my doorbell camera. Because I had no phone, I to log into my account, but my email account would not work. My phone number didn‚Äôt exist. The police were unable to do anything, seeing as there was absolutely no evidence. There was no reselling of my items on anything like eBay, no scratch or damage to the house, no finger prints, nothing. 

Work was worse. I came in and my desk was empty. My boss told me my position, and all my employment contracts don‚Äôt exist, and he thinks I‚Äôm just trying to get a job. He doesn‚Äôt know me. I had worked there for 4 whole years, right out of college. I contacted my college, since they had helped me get the job with a workforce thing, and they said I have no records of ever being there. I went home.

My whole house was gone. The plot of land it sat on is gone. My car was gone. It‚Äôs been like this for weeks. I have no accounts. No money. My parents don‚Äôt remember me. Do you know how much it hurts for your own mother to tell you she doesn‚Äôt have a son? That she‚Äôs never had a son? To hear your dad tell you to ‚Äúquit messing around boy, you‚Äôre scaring my wife‚Äù?

About a month ago my clothes disappeared. I‚Äôm hiding in this guys house right now, I‚Äôve stolen his clothes, and messed with his lock so he can‚Äôt hear me come and leave his house. I‚Äôve stolen his phone. About an hour ago my left hand disappeared. ",2,1750772893.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

1ljbhpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingadvice/comments/1ljbhpt/cant_tell_if_shes_interested/,Can‚Äôt Tell If She‚Äôs Interested,"There's this girl (we'll call Pinky since her hair is pink) that works at the dispensary I go to. We've spent the last year building a casual report, just general BS-ing when I'd end up in her queue. I've always thought she was cute but just put the idea of anything happening out of my head.

Back in August, my wife and I separated. I was thinking of people I could/would want to ask on a date and couldn't think of any, except for this girl. I'm kind of being picky with relationships since I feel incredibly hurt. As a result, I'm looking for a super nice and gentle person to spend time around. This girl hits all those marks. However, I always just chalked up Pinky's kindness as both part of her job and just her overall personality (I had seen her interact with other customers and she was always super helpful and nice to them), so I never asked since I assumed her kindness toward me wasn't special (I default assume girls being nice to me at their jobs are just being nice...not into me).

So, as a small side note, I'm a goober. I like being weird and having fun with people while they work. Nothing bad...just cracking small self-depreciating jokes or talking smack on a credit card reader that isn't working (I refuse to say ""it must be free"" when something doesn't ring up, though). Back in January, I noticed a comment section when ordering from the dispensary online. As a goof, I put ""No Pickles"" in the comments. I thought it was funny, so I kept doing it. I eventually ran out of fake fast food requests and moved onto dad jokes. 

After a few months, I go in one day and end up in Pinky's queue. After she grabs my order and returns to the counter, she says ""And, awesome joke by the way."" It was the first time anyone working there said anything about my comments. We bantered a bit and I complimented her hair (I've been wanting to for months). I left and didn't see her for a solid month or so.

The next time I do see her, I wasn't in her queue but she was hanging out around the register I was at...hovering a bit. She checked the joke for that day, told me it was pretty good, and then told me I was her favorite order to fill. We had a few more interactions over the next week or so, and I felt like she might actually like me (not in a romantic way but she certain wasn't repulsed by me). 

I went in one night without filling in an order online, so no joke. I half-apologize for no joke and she says ""It's okay. It'll make the anticipation greater for next time."" Before I ended the transaction, I ended up asking for her number. I basically told her that I have a joke I can tell her but I'll only do it if I can text it. I did not expect her to grit her teeth and lean back as a response but that's what I got. She said ""I don't think my BF would like that."" I left pretty disheartened (legit thought she was repulsed by me asking her out).

I didn't go back to the dispensary for over a week. When I finally returned, she waved me to her queue and was a super sweetheart to me the whole time. She even complimented this rubber, squeaking chicken keychain I keep on my backpack and called it cute. As she handed me my order, she said ""And, you have $5 dollars credit for your next visit"", emphasizing ‚Äònext visit‚Äô obviously indicating that she wanted me to come back.

For the past month, whenever I order and she's working (even if I don't end up in her queue), I find a small ink pen doodle (related to the joke) on the ticket that prints out with my order and joke. She's drawn me a fish, a kitten, and even a rainbow in all black (that she referred to as a goth rainbow).

There's been a few times I've walked into the selling floor and looked over at her to see her turn bright red, too. I feel like this girl is into me but I have such low expectations for love that I assume she's just being nice. I guess I'm hoping for advice from an unbiased view (friends like to tell you what you want to hear). I know I should probably just ask her but that's never worked out well for me as I think it just scares most girls. I don‚Äôt want her to break up with her BF for me, but I wouldn‚Äôt be upset knowing if they DO split, I might be able to at least treat her to a coffee.",1,1750772667.0,datingadvice,1,1.0,False

The thing is my parents were always strict since my childhood, they almost prevented me from anything!(THANKS TO THEM) So today i was feeling very sad and kinda lonely as all my friends are busy with their own lives and sheet. So out of fking curiosity i just created a dating profile in a app (avoided Tinder cause it's too mainstream and all my friends are in it). And oh boy i was for a surprise!!üò≠

  
BOY OH BOY, just after i created my profile, i got my first like! wtf!! i haven't even introduced myself in bio üò≠üò≠. Within the next 2 hrs I got 60+ likes!! The responses and chat request from premium users alone was overwhelming (not even going to comment about free users chat request). 

  
The chat request ranged from 18 to 50+, responses ranged from ""HI"" to "" I'll book you a room , we can talk and enjoy"" and even some like ""HI, beautifulllll  you look hot , i can pay 8k for coffee date"". I mean there were more vile chats but these are just the tip of the iceberg...There are married men looking for ""friends"" as they are very ""lonely""

I was just flabbergasted by this and just closed the app. Oh boy I realized the shortage in supply and demand in such apps today. 

  
I feel so sorry for the genuine people who are looking for a partner on some platform like this!!!

I will break it to you all(my reddit bros)! She is not going to accept your chat request/like and if she does, there is someone she is already chatting to you just below your chat in the chat box. Please stop wasting your time/ money over these miniscule things, you have better chances of getting a female partner in real life than whatever this is !! Hell now i'm ready to accept boys from my college lol, the dating apps are not the place for anything!!

**üöÄ Salem Tech Meetup - Coffee, AI Adventures & Building Something Epic Together!**

Hey Salem tech folks! Who's ready to geek out over some seriously cool stuff happening in the AI/tech space right now?

**The Deal:**¬†I'm buying coffee for everyone at Isaac's ‚òï - just need to know if you prefer morning meetups or after 5pm crew?

**What I've Been Playing With:**

* VEO 3 has been blowing my mind (made some epic Bigfoot videos that may or may not be Reddit-appropriate üòÖ)
* Perplexity is absolutely crushing it lately
* Replit's new features are insane
* Really want to connect with anyone using 8n8!

**The Bigger Vision:**¬†I'm not just looking for coffee chat (though that's great too). I want to start something real here - a tech group that could evolve into an actual incubator space for Salem's tech pioneers. I've got connections to some prime locations and already have 2-3 collaborators ready to dive in.

**Why This Matters:**¬†There's an incredible amount of innovation happening right now, and I know there are other passionate builders hiding in Salem. Let's find each other, share what we're working on, and maybe lay the groundwork for something that could change our local tech scene.

If you're the type who gets excited about emerging tech, wants to build something meaningful, and believes Salem deserves its own thriving tech community - let's talk. This could be the start of something big.

1ljbd49,https://www.reddit.com/r/lanadelrey/comments/1ljbd49/a_perspective_on_her_setlist/,A perspective on her setlist,"So we all can make the observation her setlist has been pretty consistent over the past few years. Last year she gave us some off Ocean Blvd like Candy Necklace, The Grants, the second part of A&W, and of course tunnel. But after that, it‚Äôs like what are we doing? She barely plays anything from NFR which is so critically acclaimed, crumbs from UV, nothing from Lust for Life or Honeymoon. So I‚Äôm just speculating on why that may be. 

Every artist is going to play the songs that made them famous, their first hits so I expect Video Games, BTD, and Summertime Sadness to always make the list and that‚Äôs great. We love those songs. 

What if she‚Äôs tired of singing the blues? (Pun intended) most of her songs are about painful relationships that fail. Barrie has haunted her discography since UV and Sean has haunted her discography since Chemtrails. Lana and Barrie are on good terms and to me, it seems there is this recognition like hey we didn‚Äôt work out, but I‚Äôll always have love for you. He was there with her right as her career took off. That‚Äôs a special place to be and I think she‚Äôll always appreciate him in her life. Sean on the other hand, seemed to break her in a way I never seen her break from a failed relationship. There‚Äôs a lot of bitterness when it comes to him. Her heartbreak from Sean followed all the way to Ocean Blvd. 

So now she‚Äôs married. Maybe she‚Äôs not wanting to sing songs about Barrie out of respect to her husband, and maybe she‚Äôs so over Sean and never wants to acknowledge him again. She really thought Sean was the one she was gonna marry, and from what we heard in A&W, she was convinced she would never be anything more than a side piece. I can imagine how hard it would be to sing these songs where someone destroyed you and made you think you weren‚Äôt worthy of true love. She‚Äôs gone through some dark periods with failed love and now she‚Äôs happy and in love. The past is the past. So these songs she‚Äôs choosing is making sense in that aspect. 

But that‚Äôs what happens when you‚Äôre an artist and you create masterpieces that the rest of us can relate to but now she‚Äôs not there with us to relate to anymore. Most of us don‚Äôt have a husband of mine. None of us have 57 million listeners on Spotify. Some of us still feel like an American Whore, some of us are Brooklyn babies or Venice bitches and the setlist backlash is from a lack of representation on top of boredom from the repetition. That‚Äôs why I was hoping her newer album would reflect how she closed Ocean Blvd with more upbeat, unserious lyrics. She would hold our attention and she‚Äôd probably be happier on stage if she went with the fishtail-taco truck vibe. It‚Äôs got a beat we can dance to, laid back lyrics where she‚Äôs just having fun and not taking herself seriously.

1ljbbm2,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaximizeMe/comments/1ljbbm2/why_your_morning_routine_determines_your_success/,Why Your Morning Routine Determines Your Success?,"Hey MaximizeMe fam! Ever wonder why some people seem to crush their goals before the rest of us have even had coffee? Here‚Äôs the deal: your morning routine can MAKE or BREAK your success. I‚Äôve been digging into the habits that separate high achievers from the rest, and trust me‚Äîthere‚Äôs science and strategy behind it. Let‚Äôs break down why your AM rituals are so powerful and how you can hack yours to win every day. 

**1. Sets the Tone for Your Entire Day**  
Mornings are like the foundation of a skyscraper‚Äîif it‚Äôs shaky, the whole structure suffers. A solid morning routine activates your brain and body for productivity, focus, and energy. When you start with intention‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs journaling, meditation, or a quick workout‚Äîyou‚Äôre telling your brain, ‚ÄúToday counts.‚Äù  
(PS: Consistency is king. The more consistent your routine, the stronger the signal your brain gets.)

**2. Reduces Decision Fatigue**  
Ever reached midday and felt paralyzed by all the choices you still have to make? A morning routine takes away those early decisions. By having set actions‚Äîlike wake-up time, hydration, and planning‚Äîyou conserve mental energy for your big moves later. 

**3. Builds Momentum That Carries You Through**  
Momentum is a feel-good chain reaction. When you complete a few small wins early (read: your routine), your brain releases dopamine, the reward chemical, motivating you to tackle bigger challenges. It‚Äôs a biological hack to keep you fired up all day long. 

**4. Champions Mental Clarity and Reduces Stress**  
In the quiet morning hours, we have space to breathe and center ourselves before life‚Äôs chaos kicks in. Activities like mindfulness or gratitude journaling can reduce cortisol (stress hormone), leading to better decision-making and emotional control throughout the day.

**5. Encourages Goal Alignment and Visualization**  
Taking just 5‚Äì10 minutes each morning to review your goals or visualize success reinforces your purpose and commitment. When your actions align with your ambitions first thing, small distractions lose their power.

### Practical Takeaway: Build Your Power-Packed Morning Routine  

Here‚Äôs what an optimized morning could look like based on top productivity research:

- **Wake up at a consistent time:** Regulate your circadian rhythm.  
- **Hydrate immediately:** Kickstart metabolism and brain function.  
- **Move your body:** Even a 5-minute stretch or quick walk.

I have a small, shitty, obscure channel laced in parody and self deprecation, and I had an idea while drinking coffee this morning.

Previous I did a 'difficult conversations made simple' video where I said things for people that was difficult for them, and they could just cue the video up and hand it to the person they wanted to, I dunno, break up with, and I delivered a ""we're broken up"" line, boom, done.

I was gonna shoot a video today in the same series, but feature actual requests instead of just generic statements.

Any comment on here or request I will put in the video, and direct it to whoever you need. You tell me specifically what you need said, and I'll do it, no problem.

If no one responds to this it makes no difference to me, just had the idea and thought it would be a fun way to share some shit.

I'll promote your shit, I'll tell your boyfriend you cheated, I'll tell your wife that she's bad at giving directions, I'll tell your husband that his taste in movies sucks. I'll tell your teacher that you're actually three little kids in a trenchcoat.

I'll tell your boss they're a fucking douchebag.

That stupid raccoon that keeps getting in the trash cans and shit? I'll tell it to fuck off back to the forest with it's striped ass.

Or, just tell me to fuck off. I'll read everyone's comments about me and this idea in the video as well. I'll censor what you want, and reserve the right to censor what I want via a long bleep. I'll also mention your usernames or channels, or whatever you want me to credit you as.

1ljbapm,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ljbapm/my_ex_might_relapse_because_of_me/,My ex might relapse because of me?,"First ever post, so apologies if I leave out information or type anything wrong.

I (F22) and my ex (M23) broke up a week or two ago. We were originally friends, which grew to be something more, in a relationship for 3 months, then last week he suddenly broke up with me. i was head over heels in love and did not see this coming. we met up a few days later to return our things and have a chat for closure (mainly for my sake as he didnt give me an explanation at the time), where he explained that after a while our relationship felt less romantic and more like we were roommates. I was staying with him alot, my understanding was that we both wanted that routine, but i understand looking back that I was probably codependent and he wasn't speaking up about his true wishes. but long story short, he just wasn't feeling like we were working out, totally valid and fair and I've made my peace with his decision.

Now a bit of backstory about both me and him before catching you up to today-

Ex suffered with a bad c0k3 addiction before we knew each other. he's been through alot, including rehab, and now to this day he stands being over 500 days clean! he has worked so hard and continues to, to make this his life and I couldn't be prouder of him. he still attends weekly support group meetings and will continue to for a long time, he's now also volunteering at the sessions and is looking for a job similar to this.

as for me, I'm not an addict myself, but addiction runs in both sides of my family and I've had alot of trauma in my life surrounding people around me using. the most prominent being my dad, who was an addict who eventually committed suicide when I was very young. certain things happened which led me and others to blame myself for this event and I carry alot of abandonment and trust issues with me, along with quite a fragile sense of self that im realising about myself right now. there are many other people and experiences that I could list which is relevant to this trauma, but I'd be here all day. it mainly stems i think from me being the youngest and last addition to an already dysfunctional family and adding more stress to my familys situation. other family members and many close friends also used or relapsed or died extremely close to me in drug related matters. things that I always look back on and wish I had made more effort even though I was just a child. 
my childhood trauma was extremely challenging to work through, but with alot of therapy and alot of self work, I genuinely believed that I could put that part of my life behind me. in fact, being in a relationship with Ex actually healed alot, seeing someone that I love in recovery gave me so much faith and happiness for others who are struggling.

So as of today, me and Ex met up to exchange a few more things back and to grab a coffee. we've both agreed that we would love to be friends, and that there's no bad blood between us. things were a little awkward but overall it was genuinely nice to see him and I was feeling hopeful that we could both form a friendship again with true intentions on both sides. 
Eventually I noticed that he seemed very upset, so I checked in with a ""hey, are you sure you're okay? you know you can talk to me if you need to, this is a safe space and I'm here for you"". to which he responded that he feels sad that he doesn't have any close friendships right now, and that if he were to have a bad evening and go out, he would relapse with some drinks. 

it took me totally by surprise. this person who I genuinely think the world of, who I look up to so much, I care unconditionally about, and who seemed so absolutely sure of himself, is feeling so alone that he's considering relapsing. I'm so sad for him. I can't imagine what he's going through and I just want to help him and make sure that he stays on track with his sobriety. but, I dont know if i can do that. we went our own ways shortly after he mentioned this because he needed to get home, and as soon as I was inside my home I had a panic attack. it was so bad that I debated calling an ambulance in case I was having a heart attack. so many old wounds reopened and I am terrified that I am a curse for people with addictions. 

how do I stop hurting people? I don't want to trigger people. I genuinely just want to love and make sure people are okay, and it seems that im in this cycle of fucking peoples lives up without even trying. does my presence really hurt people that bad that they're forced to relapse?
this situation is extremely triggering for me, but I can't say that to him, can I? that his trigger is triggering me?

This is general question due to the fact I have a 14-month old son. His energy levels are through the absolute roof, I feel beyond the level of 'toddler'. He is my first child and I spend all day everyday sprinting after him in every direction. 

I am unable to go to playgroups and he sprints out the door, runs to climb on top of toilets, grabs everyones water bottle and hot drink. I have been to 5 groups in last few weeks, I don't think he played with a toy or sat for more than 30 seconds. I didn't sit down, drink a coffee or stop moving. 

He goes to nursery and comes back with at least two accident forms a day as he's at such speed he falls into things (it is the same at home)

I look around at similar aged children and they are playing, I don't know when I last saw him play with something, he's just..up the walls, tables, toilet, kitchen counter, mantle piece, inside cupboard draws..you name it he's there. This is with a baby-proofed house.

Developmentally, he's always been ahead of his peers and 7 months he was climbing up and over a pikler and opening doors himself. Overall, he's very intelligent and 'switched on' for a baby/child his age.

My husband and I are beyond exhausted and he's not even 18-months yet. So if your child has diagnosed ADHD, how young did you truly notice and discover it was legitimately correct?

Hey MaximizeMe fam! üéâ

Ever find yourself knee-deep in a to-do list that seems to stretch into oblivion? Or maybe you‚Äôve experienced that dreaded afternoon slump where your brain feels like it‚Äôs wading through molasses? Ugh, right?

**Here‚Äôs a little secret:** Sometimes, it‚Äôs the tiniest tweaks that can turn an ""I can‚Äôt even"" day into a ‚ÄúHECK YES, I just crushed it!‚Äù kind of day. So let‚Äôs chat about that! What‚Äôs that one little change that‚Äôs made a massive impact on your focus?

For me, it was as simple as *shifting my morning coffee ritual*. ‚òï Instead of scrolling my phone while sipping my brew (you know, the usual mindless scrolling), I started spending those precious moments with a good audiobook or a quick meditation. 

**Here‚Äôs why it sparked my focus:**

- **Less Distraction**: No more getting sucked into social media vortexes before I'm even awake. üåÄ 
- **Positive Mindset**: Listening to something uplifting put me in a mindset ready to tackle the day. üìö‚ú® 
- **Boosted Energy**: Those few quiet minutes set a productive tone that carried through my morning. üöÄ 

But I‚Äôm curious: What‚Äôs YOUR game-changing tweak? Here are some ideas to spark your memory:

- **Morning Rituals**: Did you shake up your routine? Maybe swap a scroll for a stretch? üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- **Tech-Free Time**: How about implementing a ‚Äúno phone‚Äù zone during work hours? üìµ
- **Power Hours**: Are you scheduling those focused blocks of time? Like 25 minutes of pure hustle, followed by a quick stretch? (Hello, Pomodoro technique!). üçÖ
  
Or perhaps you‚Äôve found that one little productivity hack, like using a specific playlist that just makes you *zoom*. üé∂ 

Each of these tiny tweaks might seem small on their own, but when you start stacking them up, you'll be surprised by how much they can supercharge your day. 

So let‚Äôs share our nuggets of wisdom! Whether your tweak is wildly innovative or something you thought was basic‚Äîspill the tea! There‚Äôs power in simplicity, and we‚Äôre all here to learn and grow together.

I did not know he was an alcoholic when we met, we both lived in the city, dated, and got married in the city. We went out maybe 2-3 nights a week for drinks and the other nights of the week we spent at home, cooking, going on walks ect. We were so happy.

After getting married we decided to buy a house but we could only afford one an hour away from the city in his hometown.

The second we moved back, he was never home. Always with friends, always drinking. 
He started doing impulsive things like buying a boat, selling it, buying a motorcycle, selling it, buying a sports car, selling it. 

He works really hard and pays a majority of our bills as I‚Äôve been in school finishing up my masters.
I thought it was fair because I put the downpayment on our home (over 50k). 

Oh btw, he never wanted to get a joint checking account‚Ä¶ it didn‚Äôt really bother me but now looking back it‚Äôs weird kinda. 

Anyways, ever since the drinking and staying out increased I would sit him down maybe once every two weeks to let him know that I felt his drinking was a bit much and that I felt it took time away from us. 
He‚Äôd apologize, and book us a trip. We have fun on the trip then get home and go back to the same old shit. 
Then he started getting defensive when I‚Äôd bring up drinking so I started making sure I brought it up in a way where I told him I‚Äôm not perfect and maybe there‚Äôs something I could do for him to make him happier. He never ever had a recommendations for me other than he wished I was a morning person and would get up at 6 am with him and drink coffee. 
So I started waking up early with him.


He got a DWI in December. His drinking increased after this. Our fights increased. Then his mom died in April. I stopped fighting him on the drinking because I didn‚Äôt want to make him feel worse and let him grieve how he needed to.
I gave him a month of crazy drinking after her death before I started telling him we should find constructive outlets or do therapy. Nope, he thinks therapy is a joke.

Aside from his drinking and staying out, this man never complains to me about me, he‚Äôs blows up my phone all day with how much he loves me, he brags to everyone about how much he loves me, he sends me pictures of our wedding day every week telling me it was the best day of his life‚Ä¶

Now here‚Äôs where things have blown the fuck up-

2 months ago my dad got him into a private hunting/fishing club. It‚Äôs like a big deal I guess because they only vote people in when a member has died and spot opens up and you have to get a unanimous vote. 
The deal with the club is most people just use it for hunting and fishing and being a part of the land ownership. But there‚Äôs a small group that just using the place to go and drink everyday, 
And that‚Äôs what my husband is doing.
He made new bestfriends there. That drink 24-7. 

2 weeks ago I sat him down and told him I loved him and that I believe in him and that I want him to dial back on the drinking because I cant live the rest of my life with someone who doesn‚Äôt want to spend time with me. He completely agreed.

He drank the next 2 days. Came home and sat me down while I was studying for an exam and said ‚ÄúI want a divorce‚Äù
I was shocked. And I could tell he was insanely drunk.
I asked him why and his response was that I don‚Äôt do anything to initiate good times with him, that I‚Äôm an unhappy person and that I stopped getting up early with him. 
I started sobbing and just was so confused trying to plead. (I know I‚Äôm pathetic for that, but it was the first time he had ever told me he was unhappy with ME). He looked at me with dead cold eyes and said he was tired and went to bed. I cried myself to sleep and he woke up the next morning saying ‚Äúsorry for the fight last night, I love you, and I don‚Äôt believe in divorce and I want to be with you in the afterlife‚Äù then left town for a work trip. I was distraught. 

He texted me every day that week pictures of us through the years saying how much he loved me and how sorry he was and that he was wrong and that he needed to change.

I accepted.

When he got back in town he stayed out drinking for 2 days and didn‚Äôt reach out to me and when I called him, he said ‚ÄúI want a divorce, I want AWAY from you. You‚Äôre a miserable person, you talk shit about my bestfriends, you‚Äôre not a good person, and I need you out of my life‚Äù

Again I was so shocked. Before two weeks ago he had never ever said anything like this to me. He had never indicated he was unhappy with me or anything I do.

I asked him why again. I asked him how could he say all this after never mentioning anything before and his response was, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a man that‚Äôs what we do, we just stand by endure the bullshit and hope for the best til we can‚Äôt‚Äù

It‚Äôs been 4 days. He won‚Äôt come home. He has gone no contact. He won‚Äôt meet with me. Nothing.

But on our phone call he did mention he has COURT for his DWI this week (today now)‚Ä¶. Well I had NO idea when his court date was. He never tells me anything. 
So I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs absolutely shitting his pants about it because it‚Äôs more than certain he will be on probation and not be able to drink. 

Which I‚Äôm thinking what the hell, you‚Äôre literally about to be told by the court to stop drinking, the one thing I‚Äôve wanted from you all this time so we could rebuild our relationship and you leave me right before?????

I‚Äôm so confused, angry, heart broken. 

And most of all I‚Äôm mad at myself for even feeling this way because I probably should‚Äôve been the one to leave him, but I just love him so much and miss who he was and always believed I‚Äôd get that side of him back. 

So now I‚Äôm 30, getting a divorce, while I‚Äôm in the hardest part of school, only work a part time job‚Ä¶ ugh I‚Äôm just happy we don‚Äôt have kids but fuck.

Idk why he did this.
I‚Äôve been trying so hard lately, I‚Äôd wake up early with him every morning, I started sticking up for his shitty friends when other people said they were drunks, I‚Äôve been working out and dieting hardcore and lost a ton of weight to be a hot wife for him, I cook insanely nice dinners for us every night that he barely showed up to‚Ä¶. 

All I wanted was him to just be with me. Yeah he‚Äôs been an alcoholic for a while but he‚Äôs never been cruel to me til just now. It‚Äôs gut wrenching. I feel sick. 

Side note: although he pays our house bills (which are under $2400 a month and he makes 10k a month), I don‚Äôt ask him for any money and completely pay for my own things and pay for our groceries. ",12,1750771398.0,AlAnon,9,1.0,False
1ljazzz,https://www.reddit.com/r/hysterectomy/comments/1ljazzz/mission_complete/,Mission Complete!,"I successfully had my surgery yesterday 6/23/25.
Removed uterus and fallopian tubes, kept my cervix and ovaries.This thread has given me hope, anxiety, laughs, and a plethora of information. Thank you!!

Surgery was scheduled for 1:45 and they wanted me there at 12:45. Surgery didn‚Äôt actually start until maybe 2 something? No food past midnight, and water, clear liquids, cranberry or apple juice, or black coffee allowed until 7 am- at least a full 6 hours prior to the procedure.

I was called back to provide a urine sample and change into a gown, cap, compression socks, and grippy socks, then they stated my IV. After I was settled they called in my fianc√© to sit with me. 

Next anesthesia came in and I asked for something for the anxiety because I was so scared. My surgeon came but to see me once she heard I was crying, which was really sweet. After receiving the anxiety meds, I was fine and they wheeled me to the OR and let me know I‚Äôd be cold. They helped me move to the OR table but I was feeling the meds and didn‚Äôt care what went down lol. I asked who had the aux and told them I like the music selection lol. Living For The Love of You by the Isley Brothers was playing! I remember bopping to the song and the anesthesiologist sitting a mask on my face saying it was oxygen.

I was out, and my next memory was being woken up in Phase 1 being asked my pain lever. No idea what I said but I heard a nurse say she‚Äôd give me more meds. And I fell back asleep. Very vaguely do I remember getting help to get out of bed and walk yo the recliner in Phase 2. Fell asleep again then woke up to my sister coming in. Only one person allowed back so she stayed for a while then maybe switched back and forth with my fiance? Apparently I kept asking questions then falling asleep before I got the answer. 

I do remember my sister being with me and I heard another patient moaning in pain. That bothers me and hurts my empath heart so I had my sister help put on my dress and called a nurse to wheel me out to go home.

QUICK FACTS:
-First surgery, never had a broken bone or stitches. 
- I only had wash my stomach and belly button with Hibiclens- Chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG). And was able to wear lotion everywhere else as well as deodorant.
-I was diagnose 7/2024 with suspected adeno and had my surgery less than a year later.
- I traveled 7 hours for surgery at CIGC in Rockville, MD. I‚Äôm aware of the bad things about them in the post but I used my family‚Äôs personal experience and did my due diligence in making my decision.
-So far I am thoroughly impressed with them and the whole process. 
-Everyone has been very nice and supportive and listened to my fears. I felt heard.
-Done outpatient, and I even left with 6-8 printed pictures of what was removed.
-I had the Dual Port GYN procedure, so no cutting through my muscles.
-No sore throat from the breathing tube, no pain or discomfort at all from the catheter. First time urinating was perfectly fine, save the stream pausing sometimes but it starts right back up. I‚Äôm having to go live every 2 hours. 
-I‚Äôve had absolutely no bleeding. 

Sorry for the long post! Just wanted to give my experience in case it helps someone else know what to expect. üíú

1ljazpd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlienAbduction/comments/1ljazpd/abduction_or_sleep_paralysis_as_a_child/,Abduction or sleep paralysis as a child?,"Ever since I was around 6-7 years old I have had sleep paralysis, it would happen every other day or so. I would always see those tall shadows with longer arms than normal in the room, they were around 7 feet tall and very thin. They had no eyes or mouth but I ""knew"" they had one despite the fact it was not visible.

For many years I couldn't explain it and no one believed me, as a teen I found out through the internet that they were called shadow people and that what I was experiencing was sleep paralysis.

For the past few months following a couple of UAP sightings and many, many dreams of ships and of aliens coming I have started to think that they might have been aliens, ever since I learned that they communicate telepathically I realized that I saw those shadow people talk to each other telepathically a few times. Whenever they spoke to one another it was as if I could hear this frantic and very fast whispering and as if it was blocked out by glass, however when they spoke my eyes would involuntarily flick between the figures depending on which one spoke despite the fact that they never spoke to me.
When this happened I knew that they were saying much more stuff that it was physically possible to say in such a short amount of time and at times more than two at once would speak between each other.

Anyway whenever they appeared they would usually put their hands on my chest or abdomen and then they would sink their hands in and tear my chest open, I have read of experiences that some people had of aliens putting/pulling balls of light in/out of their chest and that also made me think it could have been them.
They however never put/pulled anything from my chest, they would either observe me next to my bed, whisper between themselves or put their face very close to mine and watch me or they would sink their hands inside my body, the figures were almost never alone usually there were at least 2-3 at a time and I remember seeing up to 6 and they always felt VERY negative.

When I turned 18 it slowly stopped, the paralysis never went away altough it happened way less often and I stopped seeing them entirely.

I'm writing this post because yesterday I had a very strange experience where I asked an alien that I saw during meditation to show himself to me and he did in the form of an orb/UAP (you can check my post history) but mostly because in the days leading up to it I have felt very strange, every night when it's time to sleep I find myself absolutely unable to resist sleep much like it happened as a child (even if I drink a lot of coffee while it happens to stay awake despite the fact that I never drink it) when it happened sleep paralysis would always follow. 
Just like when I was a child as soon as I fall asleep the paralysis happens and I get this feeling of doom and of being watched, I keep fighting it and end up spending many hours falling asleep, going into paralysis and out of it dozens if not hundreds of times.
However something else has been happening during the day that is freaking me out, I randomly feel as if I am getting out of my body, even as I am writing this I have to move every few seconds so I can ""get back inside"", if I stay still too long I fall asleep for a few seconds and the paralysis starts.
I have been really scared for the past few hours and I can't shake the fear of being abducted, i don't know where the feeling or even the idea came from as the experience I had with the UAP was very positive.

Has anyone else gone through something similar? Perhaps I am jumping to conclusions but if it's abduction is there any way to prevent it?
I hope it's just sleep paralysis, I am even considering that it might be narcolepsy, any insight is appreciated and sorry for my bad english, it's not my first language.

So this sem break, I thought of buying a pepper coffee setup rather than instant coffee. 

I figured to start with an immersion brewer since there are less things that can go wrong with it compared to a percolation brewery, and also since immersion brewing produces better coffee than percolation brewing (watch James Hoffmann's video). So I went with a French press, as this is a pretty good and cheap beginner friendly brewer.

Since most recommend not skimping out on a grinder, I'll buy the Timemore C2 on Amazon. A kitchen scale will also be brought. The French press itself from sipologie(600mL), and a coffee beans pouch for beginning. 

I calculated the total amount√∑
French Press- Rs. 640
Kitchen Scale- Rs. 900
Timemore C2- Rs. 4800
Devan's Coffee Beans- Rs. 500

This results in a total initial cost of Rs. 6840. But seeing this cost makes me question whether I should put this much of an investment and use so much money, or should I stick to nescafe instant coffee for college and consider buying the brewer later down the line when I earn money myself. Do the benefits outweigh the cost of the setup? For more context, my monthly pocket money is Rs. 5000 in college.

1ljatn2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Glaucoma/comments/1ljatn2/need_to_offload_a_bit/,Need to offload a bit,"Hello! I've been following this sub for a couple of weeks - it's been good to read along, even when the subject matter's a bit alarming . . .  
I think I'm just not dealing with my own situation too well tonight. I've been doing my best **NOT** to Google and look at support groups - for some reason my Facebook log in isn't working and that's probably a blessing - I usually follow the uveitis groups and the poor folks there are almost always having a really, really bad time.  
I've had myopia all my life, then retinal tears, detachments, cataracts, secondary cataracts and uveitis (not to boast or anything) so I never paid much attention to my pigment dispersion syndrome. I've taken Combigan for years and sometimes Xalatan/Latanoprost (though I don't like the side effects - I got hair down the side of my face, ingrown eyelashes and dark sunken eye sockets - yuck).  
Until last year, I honestly didn't get why glaucoma was ever considered a big deal in wealthy countries in the 21st century (I was ignorant). I remember my grandfather having glaucoma - and most of the  family on my Dad's side have the pigment thing. We just take drops and occasionally get laser. It hasn't seemed to progress to ocular damage for anyone and it doesn't hurt - so no big deal.  
Except for me. Mine is suddenly galloping along. Since getting uveitis last year (no cause for that identified) I seem to be regularly getting IOPs in the late 30s and early 40s. And now I've got a bit of optic nerve damage. And really thin corneas, so.  
I was a bit slack with my drops earlier this year and realised I was getting headaches that didn't respond to paracetamol. I didn't make the connection until I was driving home one night and the rainbows around the lights were SO dazzling I could barely see! Oops. And then the pain and visual disturbance went away when I put my drops in. Double oops.  
So, now I feel I've been sleepwalking into a bad, bad ocular situation. I've had SLT done in both eyes and thus far it's done nothing. The pressures spiked even when iopidine was administered straight afterwards and, strangely, the pressure in the unlasered eye just goes crazy. Both my eyes ache. I'm on Vizo-Dorzo, Iopodine, Alphagan and Xalatan for the pressure and Azopt for the inflammation (I think I've gotten that right). Rocklatan isn't readily available in Australia for glaucoma but my ophthalmologist has said she'll help me get some if it's still needed after my next visit.   
I had Diamox last year for two weeks when I responded to steroids for the uveitis. I turned into a half-alive thing with a ball of wool for a head and failing kidneys, so I'd prefer not to go that route again.  
It looks like the next thing to do might be the Preserflo MicroStent. I've Googled alot in the last couple of days (despite trying not to). I've asked ChatGPT many, many questions, so I'm sorry to everyone for overloading the grid, but AI was really helpful (more helpful than my optometrist tbh) . However, I still don't know how much the Microstents will cost, what the risks are for someone like me, and how likely it is that they'll work. I also don't really know how to handle my work situation. I've taken so much time off in the last two years, firstly for kids with chronic illnesses and then because I was burnt-out and injured my spine. I don't have much leave accrued, and taking leave without pay is risky for both my mortgage and my job security. I understand that with IOPs consistently so high I don't have a lot of time to waste or many other choices to consider.  
I love yoga (I was training to be a yoga teacher last year, before getting uveitis) but am taking this week off to reconsider my practice and whether I can adapt it enough to continue with my local studio. I have a fairly healthy lifestyle, but I've been under considerable stress, so I'm trying to get sleep, not look at the news (!) and to be good about using my CPAP for sleep apnea. I'm drinking lots of water, no alcohol and only ONE coffee a day. 

I don't know what else I can really do, except accept my fate and be glad about the excellent eye surgery available in Australia. All ideas, suggestions, random thoughts welcome though.

And, thank you for reading this rant (if you did)!",2,1750770907.0,Glaucoma,0,1.0,False

Freezing. Minus forty-two Celsius. A new record for the middle of polar night in Hub Three.



Ivar had forgotten to activate thermal protection on his implant again. The corneal display flashed yellow‚Äîa security protocol violation warning. Not critical. Such minor infractions would only be counted in the next hourly level recalculation. He'd have time to fix it. He sighed and touched his temple, activating the interface.



\`\`\`

TCSE. USER STATUS:

IVAR HOLT, ID#78092/CB

NORTHERN CLUSTER, HUB-3

LEVEL: 12.17 \[WARNING\]

\`\`\`



Highlighted in red. That had never happened before. Before, it was yellow. Just a month ago he'd had 16.3‚Äîalmost like everyone else in the technical maintenance sector.



The thermal protection normalized, his face stopped stinging from the frost. Ivar disconnected the display and headed toward his module, crossing the main atrium of the hub. The glass dome overhead, reinforced with polymer fibers, protected against the fifty-degree Celsius frost outside. Synthetic palm trees grew beneath the dome‚Äîa feeble attempt to imitate life beyond the Arctic Circle.



From the direction of the Administrative Block, Martha called out to him‚Äîthe director's secretary. Her pale, almost transparent face with freckles was always framed by bright red hair pulled back in a tight bun.



""Ivar! Wait!""



He pretended not to hear. The system recorded the ignore. It would show up in the next recalculation, but right now he didn't care.



\---



The old thermal generator hummed in his module. Standard cell‚Äîtwo hundred and fifteen square feet of sterile privacy. Gray walls, minimal furnishing: bed, work desk, terminal, closet for personal items, sanitary block behind a partition. On the nightstand‚Äîan old photograph in a worn frame: a woman with a child. His wife and daughter. They'd stayed in the main cluster when he was transferred north. ""Temporarily,"" they'd said then. Five years had passed.



Ivar stripped off his work coveralls, threw them on the bed. Standard evening routine for a fourth-rank technician: synth-spirit, three swallows, warm shower, then sleep. Evenings in the Northern Cluster stretched endlessly‚Äîespecially during polar night, when the sun didn't appear above the horizon for a hundred and twenty days straight.



Instead of his usual ritual, he sat at the terminal and launched his personal console. He wanted to test his theory.



\`\`\`

REQUEST: LEVEL DROP STATISTICS FOR LAST 30 DAYS

\`\`\`



An access error appeared on screen. Logs‚Äîadministrators only. He knew this, but checked anyway. Every evening.



Was it dropping this sharply for others too? Or just him? After that incident with the foreman, when Ivar refused to falsify energy consumption data, his level started declining. Not immediately‚Äîgradually, from recalculation to recalculation. Someone had clearly put him on a blacklist. Possibly Jensen himself‚Äîhead of resource allocation. A massive man with a perpetually red face and small eyes like black buttons. Ivar had seen him talking to the administrator after their conflict.



The communicator vibrated on the table. Incoming call from Earth. Caroline‚Äîhis wife. Ex-wife. The divorce had been finalized exactly a year ago, paperwork completed three months ago. His daughter was already calling another man daddy.



He didn't answer.



\---



Morning in Hub Three arrived on schedule. Exactly at 6:00 local time, lighting in the residential modules gradually intensified, simulating sunrise. From 7:00 to 8:30‚Äîbreakfast time in the common cafeteria. The morning briefing usually took place there as well.



""Holt, you look like shit,"" Karen worked the same shift as him. A tall blonde with cold blue eyes and perpetually compressed lips. Ivar glanced at the glowing number 17.4 hanging above her head. The corneal implant displayed each person's level in his field of vision‚Äîa constant reminder of status and position. Karen only smiled at management.



Ivar studied her face, noticing for the first time the tiny wrinkles at the corners of her eyes. How old was she? Thirty-five? Forty? In the Northern Hub, people aged faster.



""I'm fine,"" Ivar turned away to secure a cooling element on the hub's external circuit. He was fifteen minutes late for the start of work. Another minus at the next recalculation.



""You haven't been to the common cafeteria for three days,"" she stood too close. She smelled of antiseptic and synthetic apple. ""Everyone's talking about your level.""



""I prefer eating alone.""



Karen looked around, made sure no one was listening, and lowered her voice:



""Pekarson says you have a critical decline. Is it true?""



Ivar frowned. Pekarson‚Äîa minor administrator with database access. A gossip lover.



""Fuck off, Karen. Mind your own business.""



Something like fear flickered in her eyes. Or pity. She left without saying another word.



In the evening, after the hourly recalculation, Ivar noticed a new system notification.



\`\`\`

LEVEL: 11.83 \[CRITICAL DECLINE\]

PSYCHOLOGIST-NORMALIZER CONSULTATION REQUIRED

\`\`\`



Ivar deleted the notification without opening it. This would be recorded in the next recalculation. Minus to level. Whatever.



He drank half a bottle of synth-spirit and fell asleep right at the table, staring at the hologram of his daughter. She should be seven now. Or eight? He'd lost track.



\---



Dreams became dense, viscous. In them, Ivar was always falling. Sometimes it was an elevator shaft, sometimes an icy well. Most often‚Äîjust darkness without end or edge. And always at the bottom something waited for him... something he couldn't make out but felt with his entire being.



At work, he was transferred to the night shift. Official reason‚Äîoptimization of life support systems maintenance. Unofficial‚Äîno one wanted to be near a person whose level was approaching ten and below.



They whispered behind his back. Thought he couldn't hear.



""...they say the system doesn't make mistakes. If his is that low, there's a reason. ‚Äî I heard he hacked some databases. Or sold info to outsiders. ‚Äî And I heard he's just a psycho. Quiet, but dangerous. ‚Äî Looks like an ordinary guy, but you never know...""



Collective distrust. Another minus at the next recalculation.



\---



""Holt, stay after shift,"" foreman Jensen caught him in the corridor. ""We need to talk.""



The small office smelled of synthetic coffee and tobacco‚ÄîJensen's old habit, for which the system lowered his level at each recalculation. But the technical service director had access to special rations that compensated for losses.



""Your indicators are falling, Holt. Below eleven is already a serious risk zone.""



Ivar remained silent, studying the boss's face. Jensen's nose was covered with a network of burst capillaries‚Äîa sign of high-grade synth-spirit abuse.



""I can help,"" Jensen leaned closer. ""The system takes management recommendations into account during recalculation. If I note positive progress...""



""What do you want?""



""We have problems with resources. Reports need to show savings.""



""You're asking me to falsify data?""



Jensen winced as if the word caused him physical pain.



""I'm asking you to survive, Holt. A loner in the Northern Cluster with a level below ten... you know how that usually ends.""



Ivar stood up.



""I'll think about it.""



He didn't think about it. That evening, after the hourly recalculation, his level dropped to 10.96. Critical threshold.



\---



\`\`\`

LEVEL: 10.96 \[CRITICAL\]

FINAL WARNING

CONTACT HUB ADMINISTRATOR

\`\`\`



Ivar tried to get an appointment with the Chief Administrator. They wouldn't let him in. Said all slots were booked for the next two weeks.



That night he drank more heavily than usual. His head was buzzing. The system periodically issued warnings about exceeding acceptable blood toxin levels. Whatever.



Karen appeared at his module's threshold. Her eyes widened when she saw the bottle in his hand.



""Your level..."" she nodded at the glowing red number 10.96 above his head. ""I can see you're in the critical zone.""



""So what? Come to watch the fall?""



""No, I..."" she hesitated. ""I can help. I know how the recalculation system works.""



Ivar laughed, letting her inside.



""Really? And I thought that was top secret.""



Karen carefully entered his module, looking around. Her gaze lingered on the photograph in the frame.



""You have a child?""



""Had,"" Ivar poured himself more synth-spirit. ""Want some?""



She shook her head, then changed her mind and reached for a glass.



""Everyone here is lonely. Such is the Northern Cluster.""



They drank in silence. Then Karen began to speak‚Äîhaltingly, nervously. About how the system really doesn't make mistakes in calculations, but people make mistakes who can deliberately create situations that lower the level of undesirables.



""Jensen hates you for that incident. He deliberately fragments assignments so you can't keep up. Every delay, every mistake‚Äîeverything gets recorded. I've seen his instructions to foremen.""



Ivar listened silently. So that's what it was. All so simple and so complex at the same time.



""Why are you helping me?""



Karen was quiet for a long time, twirling the empty glass in her hands.



""My brother... last winter... He started falling too. No one helped.""



Silence hung in the air. Ivar carefully touched her hand. She didn't pull away.



That night they made love. For Ivar it was simply physical need, a desperate attempt to feel alive. For Karen‚Äîsomething more. She looked at him with a gaze that held a long, painful feeling. Her pale skin glowed in the dim light of the module, bruises under her eyes made her face exhausted, almost ghostly. But her body was warm, real.



""I've been waiting for this moment for two years,"" she whispered when he entered her. ""Since the day you appeared in the hub.""



Ivar didn't respond. He didn't care. He dug his fingers into her thighs as if trying to hold on above an abyss. Karen bit her lips to keep from screaming‚Äîthe walls in the modules were thin. In her eyes was not just desire‚Äîpainful, long-standing love that he had never returned, never even noticed. When it was over, she cried, burying her face in his chest.



""The system will record a personal boundary violation if anyone finds out,"" she whispered.



""Fuck the system.""



In the morning Karen left before the lights came on. For a moment it seemed to Ivar that she hadn't been there at all‚Äîthat it was just another dream in the middle of endless polar night.



After the hourly recalculation, his level unexpectedly rose to 11.26. Positive social interaction, intimate closeness, emotional contact‚Äîthe system counted all this as positive factors. A green number glowed above his head‚Äîfor the first time in months.



Ivar felt a surge of hope. Maybe not everything was lost? Maybe the system was giving him a chance?



He worked diligently all day, following all protocols. Jensen glanced at the changed number above his head but said nothing.



But in the evening there was an incident with the cooling system. Ivar was blamed for negligence. The system recorded the violation. After the next recalculation, the level dropped again‚Äîto 9.83.



\---



\`\`\`

LEVEL: 9.83 \[CRITICAL\]

ISOLATION STRONGLY RECOMMENDED

\`\`\`



In the workshop they stopped talking to him. Even Jensen avoided him. A level below ten was like a disease‚Äîcontagious, dangerous. No one wanted to risk their own status.



Only Karen sometimes came at night. Silently. They didn't talk‚Äîjust lay next to each other, pressing against one another. Sometimes they had sex‚Äîfiercely, almost painfully. Sometimes they just breathed in unison until they fell asleep.



Once she brought an injector with clear liquid.



""This will help,"" she said. ""Temporary neural interface blocker. For four hours the system will stop recording your actions.""



""Where did you get this?""



""Don't ask.""



Ivar turned the injector in his hands. Four hours of freedom. What could he do?



""The level will still drop at the next recalculation.""



""Maybe,"" Karen whispered. ""Or maybe you'll have time to change something.""



He didn't have time to change anything. The blocker worked, but the system recorded an anomaly in the neural interface operation. After the hourly recalculation, the level dropped to 7.65.



\---



Days merged into one endless nightmare. The level continued falling‚Äîslowly but steadily. Every hour the system recalculated indicators, taking into account new actions, violations, reactions of others. A closed loop.



Karen stopped coming. Ivar sometimes noticed her in the corridors‚Äîthe number 17.4 above her head remained just as bright and green. Once their eyes met, and he saw in her eyes the same painful feeling, but now fear was mixed with it. She turned away and quickly left. Later he learned she'd been transferred to the day shift at the other end of the hub. When he tried to find her, security wouldn't let him into that sector. Access restricted for employees with levels below 10.



On the last day, when the level dropped to 0.24, Ivar received a message from the system:



\`\`\`

LEVEL: 0.24 \[PRE-CRITICAL\]

ISOLATION STRONGLY RECOMMENDED

\`\`\`



He left the module without thermal protection. The skin on his face immediately began crystallizing from the frost. Pain pierced every nerve, but he almost welcomed it‚Äîit proved he was still alive.



Ivar walked to the observation deck in the far wing of the hub. Usually no one was there at this time‚Äîeveryone preferred to stay closer to the central heating systems. Beyond the protective dome, the aurora borealis shimmered with pearlescent light. Beautiful. Incomprehensible. Indifferent to human levels.



The corneal display flashed.



\`\`\`

LEVEL: 0.09 \[CRITICAL\]

PREPARING FOR NULLIFICATION

\`\`\`



Ivar almost smiled. There was the answer. The system counted to the last hundredth. Interesting, could anyone see zero? Had at least one person managed to record that?



He felt no injustice. There was no anger or despair. Only strange calm and detached curiosity of a researcher.



""Ivar!""



He turned around. Karen stood in the doorway. Her eyes were red from tears, her breathing ragged.



""Go away,"" he said quietly. ""The system will record contact. Your level will drop too.""



""I don't care,"" she stepped toward him, looking at the bright red number 0.09 above his head. ""Everyone can see your level. The administrator gathered the whole shift. As an example.""



Ivar smiled.



""Effective personnel management.""



""This can be fixed,"" despair sounded in her voice. ""Jensen can file an appeal. If he admits his guilt...""



""He won't admit it. And you know it.""



The corneal display flashed again.



\`\`\`

LEVEL: 0.01 \[INEVITABLE\]

\`\`\`



The last hundredth. Recalculation time had come. Ivar looked at the aurora, listening to his sensations. His heart beat steadily. Thoughts flowed calmly.



""It's beautiful, isn't it?"" he nodded at the aurora. ""People used to think it was gods talking to us.""



""Ivar, please..."" Karen reached out to him.



His implant emitted a quiet beep. The corneal display flashed red:



\`\`\`

LEVEL: 0.00 \[NULLIFICATION\]

TERMINATION INITIATED

\`\`\`



The first discharge was like a weak electric shock. Something jerked in his chest, disrupting the rhythm. Ivar grabbed his heart, feeling it beat faster and more irregularly.



The second discharge was stronger. His knees buckled and he fell to the floor of the observation deck. Karen rushed to him, cradling his head in her hands.



""No, no, no!"" she screamed, looking at his dilated pupils. ""Not this!""



The third discharge was unexpectedly weak. The system in the Northern Cluster was one of the first versions‚Äînot fully debugged, with bugs and glitches. The implant was trying to stop his heart, but something was going wrong.



Ivar felt his body convulsing. Blood trickled from his mouth‚Äîhe'd bitten his tongue. Pain came in waves and receded.



Karen pressed his head to her chest, begging the system to stop. Useless. The algorithm had been launched.



The fourth discharge was the last. Ivar's heart stopped. His body went limp.



His last thought was: ""I wonder, does the system record the moment of death in the logs? Does a person become minus one in their equations?""



\---



""Did you hear about that technician? Holt, I think?"" ‚Äî ""What about him?"" ‚Äî ""Got nullified yesterday. First case in our hub."" ‚Äî ""Wow. What did he do?"" ‚Äî ""Don't know the details. They say cumulative effect. Series of violations, antisocial behavior."" ‚Äî ""Terrible. What about the body?"" ‚Äî ""Disposed of according to protocol. Like biowaste. Security system doesn't allow burying the nullified‚Äîbad example."" ‚Äî ""Logical. The system doesn't make mistakes. If he got nullified, he deserved it.""



The cafeteria was warm. Outside the windows‚Äîthe same polar night. Hub-3 operated in normal mode. Technician Ivar Holt's position was filled by a new employee with a level of 16.8. Someone installed an additional heater on the observation deck‚Äîthe old one was malfunctioning.



In the deceased's module, administrators found an old family photograph and a single entry in the personal terminal:



""The system was created by people. That means it can be deceived. I wonder what will happen to the one who first discovers this possibility? Perhaps the system automatically nullifies not those who are useless, but those who see its imperfection?""



The entry was encrypted and later deleted from the logs‚Äîpotentially dangerous content.



A record appeared in the TCSE system archives:



\`\`\`

FIRST NULLIFICATION CONFIRMED

ID#78092/CB DISPOSED

MATHEMATICAL MODEL FUNCTIONING CORRECTLY

\`\`\`



Jensen received a promotion‚Äîfor effective personnel management and preventing the spread of destructive ideas.



Karen was transferred to another facility‚Äîa distant outpost of the Northern Cluster. Her level dropped to 11.4‚Äîemotional deviation during work hours and unauthorized contact with the nullified.



The system worked. There were no malfunctions. The aurora continued to shimmer in all colors above the hub's dome‚Äîindifferent, eternal, beautiful. Everything as before, only slightly colder.

The before-work crowd was still streaming in, corporate-looking men and corporate-looking women hurriedly ordering coffees and sandwiches at the counter before rushing to the office.

Jo and I sat in our usual booth, tucked away in the corner of the room and pressed up against a large street-side window. Jo liked to watch as people scurried about on their way to work, and she‚Äôd said that sitting by the window was the only way to do it fairly, so that they could watch us too.

The nine-o-clock sun was spilled across our table, warming us on an otherwise chilly February morning.

Jo stuffed her cigarette into the ashtray which sat between our coffees and smiled at me.

‚ÄúWhat was she like?‚Äù

Her question startled me.

It had seemed some sort of unwritten law between us to never speak of it.

That being said, it was the anniversary of the whole damned thing. Seven years. It hardly seemed possible.

Had Jo known that, or was her asking just a strange coincidence? I guessed I‚Äôd shared the date with her at some point, during a long-ago conversation in a distant, forgotten corner.

I cleared my throat. Jo continued to smile toward me.

‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt want to talk about her, it‚Äôs okay.‚Äù

‚ÄúUm,‚Äù I managed.

‚ÄúNo, really, it‚Äôs okay.‚Äù She took a small sip from her mug, momentarily looking away.

I suddenly felt warm all over. The heat rose from my chest to my head and went back down again, with no way to get out.

It‚Äôs a funny thing to lose someone when you‚Äôre young and invincible, and twenty-seven is still that, and then to be thirty-four and still somewhat broken, but mended, so that the scar yet shows under the right lighting but doesn‚Äôt hurt so much anymore.

I didn‚Äôt know how to respond. It had been so long since I‚Äôd last talked about her.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Jack. Really, forget I even brought it up.‚Äù

The sunlight glistened off of Jo‚Äôs wedding band, still new and mostly un-scuffed, blinding my eyes and turning everything amber.

I remembered much about her, but the memories were no longer clear, like old video tape that had been worn out and recorded over.

There were smiles and tears and laughter and arguments and forgiveness, over and over again, all unspooled and jumbled up together.

I saw once-familiar places and old friends and long drives home and her leaning out of the sun-roof of my dad‚Äôs car, shouting at the moon and laughing hard, and that CD was probably still in there somewhere, tucked under the passenger seat forever.

There was sneaking through my bedroom window and fumbling around in the dark and falling in love and heading off to college but still making it work.

I remembered that first apartment together when there was no money, and then suddenly a lot of it, but nothing different between the two of us expect for the growing wrinkles around our eyes and my hair growing thinner, and there was a dog named for a movie we liked and a view of the city and a candle always lit on the dining room table.

And then there was none of it.

Suddenly and abruptly and unfairly and foully, but there was nothing that could be done about that now.

Her mom and dad, and mine were already gone, and her brothers and sisters that had become my own but were no longer, and all of those friends were ours together and it wasn‚Äôt right to have them on my own so I didn‚Äôt anymore.

Nothing to be done about it but continuing to move forward and smiling through it all and working to forget and trying not to remember. Yes, that was the way to do it.

Her smile was gone forever and I wasn‚Äôt sure how to answer Jo so I just sat there. I noticed through the amber that her smile was gone now, too.

Chapter 1 


I was finally able to fall asleep after cleaning the house, washing the dishes, doing the laundry, making dinner, and getting my brothers and sister to bed, not to mention getting my homework done. I have a major paper due tomorrow, and I just finished it. Getting it done with three three-year-old toddlers running around is not the easiest thing to do. I had just finally fallen into a deep slumber when I was ripped out of bed and dragged down the stairs. Damn that is going to leave a mark or two. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck is this shit?‚Äù My mother yelled at me. ‚ÄúYour father will be home soon, get this shit cleaned up!‚Äù She shouted, throwing me in the kitchen. ‚ÄúFirst of all, you made this mess, I had everything spotless, so you need to clean up after yourself and secondly, he‚Äôs NOT my FATHER!‚Äù I spat back. My mother reared back and slapped me so hard that she drew blood and making me fall back to the floor. I shook my head slightly trying to get my bearings back. ‚ÄúHe IS your FATHER! Now get this shit cleaned up before he gets home.‚Äù She shrieked at and stormed out of the kitchen to her room. This isn‚Äôt the first time she has done this; she would come home and make a mess and tell him that I didn‚Äôt do any of my chores. My mom‚Äôs not as bad as he can be, he can be downright evil. He beat me so badly once that I could hardly move and of course that meant I couldn‚Äôt clean, cook, or take care of the triplets and that made things worse, and it led to another beating. I had to force myself up to get things done. Eventually I fell into a routine and was able to get everything done, even on the days when my mom came home in a bitchy mood.



I was in the middle of cleaning up the mess my mom made when HE walked into the kitchen. ‚ÄúWhat is this shit? Why is nothing clean!‚Äù I heard him bellow. I was already pissed at mom, so this was not going to be good for me in the end. ‚ÄúIt was clean until your wife got home and decided that her day wasn‚Äôt complete until she made mine into shit!‚Äù I spat; my words laced with venom. ‚ÄúWhat did you say?!‚Äù He snarled. I saw his eyes shift back and forth between his brown color to pitch black. He always did that when he got angry. ‚ÄúYou heard me; I didn‚Äôt stutter.‚Äù I yelled at him as I finished cleaning up after my mom. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you ever speak about your mother like that!‚Äù He yelled, the next thing I knew pain was shooting down my neck. I fell to my knees grabbing the back of my head. I tried to stand but his fist cracked against the right side of my face. ‚ÄúYou will show us some respect!‚Äù He growled out standing over me. ‚ÄúI told you he wouldn‚Äôt be happy.‚Äù Mom sneered. ‚ÄúC‚Äômon Freddy dear, I‚Äôm tired, it‚Äôs been a long day.‚Äù She told him rubbing herself against him, that is so gross. He pulled her to his chest as she purred in his arms. She gave him her, what she calls, her sexy smile and walked out of the kitchen, swaying her hips. ‚ÄúI better not find any blood here in the morning. You understand?‚Äù He yelled. I didn‚Äôt answer so he repeated himself and he hated to repeat himself. ‚ÄúDO. YOU. UNDERSTAND.‚Äù He gritted out. ‚ÄúDO NOT MAKE ME REPEAT MYSELF.‚Äù He growled as he towered over me, and I nodded my head.



Once I was finally finished cleaning the kitchen, again, I went to bed, praying I could get a few hours of sleep before my alarm went off. My alarm clock went off at five a.m., I groaned and shut it off. I went to my bathroom as quietly as I could since the triplets slept in my room. I did my business, showered, brushed my teeth, and got started on trying to hide the bruises on my face. They were a little darker than usual, so I wasn‚Äôt able to cover them all the way. I did the best I could. I walked out of the bathroom to find my little ones wide awake and sitting quietly waiting for me. Fred has them trained and so scared not to cry, yell, or throw temper tantrums. He beat me in front of them when they misbehaved and told them that if they keep it up, he will do the same thing to them. It only took for them to see him beat me once and they never made a peep again. I would take a beating for them anytime; the slightest squeal of joy would throw both of into a fit of rage. Imagine that the squeal of happiness from their children makes them angry.



‚ÄúStowme.‚Äù I heard Ryder call out softly. ‚ÄúGood morning my little loves. Did you sleep well?‚Äù I asked, helping them from their bed and placed them on the floor. They nodded their heads with yawns. ‚ÄúC‚Äômon, we need to get you cleaned up and outta your jammies.‚Äù I told them as they waddled to the bathroom. Nancy never took care of them, except for the first six months after they were born she was a good mom and I thought that maybe she would change but when they turned six-month-old, she started back to work and would stay out late. Fred moved their stuff into my room and told me that they are now my problem and responsibility and that they are my kids now. By the time I got the four of us ready it was six thirty. I took them downstairs, packed their snack bags, their sippy cups, grabbed our backpacks and quietly made our way out the door. Fred and Nancy were still asleep, they slept until whenever they decided to get up. They both worked in the evening until sometime in the early morning hours, it usually worked out because we hardly ever had to see each other, unless Nancy was in one of her moods or I accidentally came face to face with one of them.



Chapter 2


My first class started at eight fifteen, giving me a little over an hour to drop them off at daycare, which was on campus, run by the child development department. Since I didn‚Äôt have money to pay I explained my situation to them, well except the beatings. They were able to find a scholarship to help pay for the triplets fees, they even offered me a job to help me make some money to take care of my siblings. ‚ÄúGood morning, Stormie.‚Äù Mrs. Black, the director of the center, greeted. ‚ÄúMorning.‚Äù I chirped back. ‚ÄúMowny.‚Äù The triplets greeted in unison. ‚ÄúWhy good morning little ones. Are you ready to get your day started?‚Äù She asked them, bending down to their level. ‚ÄúYesh ma‚Äôam.‚Äù They smiled. ‚ÄúWell come along, you can help me get things ready. Get your bags and say goodbye to mom.‚Äù They walked over to me, who they call mama, I put their backpacks on them, and they each gave me a hug and kiss and waddled off with Mrs. Black. Mrs. Black turned to me and mouthed, See ya later. I waved at Mrs. Black and made my way out. The weather was starting to change, it was getting cooler, the leaves were changing colors and that means winter break is around the corner. I hate winter break; the beatings always got worse.



‚ÄúHi, what would you like?‚Äù The girl behind the counter asked with boredom. ‚ÄúA large hot mocha please.‚Äù I was digging through my bag looking for my wallet when the girl said, ‚Äúfour dollars and twenty-five cents, please.‚Äù She huffed at me. ‚ÄúSorry, sorry, sorry, I have my wallet in here somewhere.‚Äù I smiled at her. ‚ÄúLook lady, if you can‚Äôt pay, why did you order?‚Äù ‚ÄúI can pay, I just can‚Äôt find my wallet.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre holding up the line.‚Äù She snapped. I turned around and saw that there were six people behind me. ‚ÄúC‚Äômon lady, hurry up!‚Äù Someone grunted. ‚ÄúYeah, we‚Äôre gonna be late for class.‚Äù I blushed in embarrassment. ‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù I said one more time and ran out. I couldn‚Äôt help it, but I started crying. As I was hurrying out, I bumped into a wall, well it felt like a wall, but it turned out to be a person a very HUGE person, a male person. I bumped into him so hard that we both dropped our things. I quickly picked up my things. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry.‚Äù I muttered looking at the stranger. We made eye contact and wholly shitzu, I felt like I was hit by a lightning bolt. Who is this Greek God looking back at me? He has the deepest gray eyes, shoulder length black hair and his lips, his oh so plump kissable lips. What is wrong with me? I don‚Äôt even know him, and my lower region is on fire. I heard him say, ‚ÄúMATE - MINE.‚Äù I gave him a confused look and then he shook his head lightly. ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù His voice sent chills down my spine. ‚ÄúUmm‚Ä¶Yeah, I‚Äôm fine.‚Äù I answered him softly as he extended his hand to help me up. I reluctantly put my hand in his. I had no idea what happened, but I felt jolts of electricity flow through my body. He felt it also because he inhaled sharply. I pulled my hand away from his and thought I heard a low growl from him. The way he looked at me made me wish I had a change of panties. ‚ÄúUh, again, sorry. I need to go. I‚Äôm gonna be late for class.‚Äù I said backing away from him. I wasn‚Äôt anywhere from being late for class, I still had at least an hour, but I couldn‚Äôt chance letting him get any ideas that I was interested in him, even though I wouldn‚Äôt mind climbing that mountain. He opened his mouth to say something, but I turned tail and ran off. What did he mean by saying, MATE MINE? I knew I could never belong to anyone, except of course to Fred, he would never let me go. Although I‚Äôm sure my mom wouldn‚Äôt mind, she wouldn‚Äôt miss us, she would be free to live her life like she wants, not that she doesn‚Äôt already. 



I was deep in thought when I heard someone clear their throat and ask, ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù I looked up and saw a pretty blue eyed, perky blonde smiling at me. ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm fine.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt even realize I was on the ground. I grumbled in embarrassment. ‚ÄúIt happens, here let me help you up.‚Äù She said, extending her hand. ‚ÄúOh my! What happened to your face? Did someone here hurt you?‚Äù She gasped. ‚ÄúWhat?! Oooh, nothing. I‚Äôm just very clumsy, as you can see, I wasn‚Äôt paying attention and got hit by a door.‚Äù I tried to explain but the look on her face told her that she didn‚Äôt believe me. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôll excuse me‚Ä¶"""" I started to say. ‚ÄúHere, try this.‚Äù She said handing me a bottle of cover up. ‚ÄúC‚Äômon, let's see if we can get this covered.‚Äù She offered. ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù I sighed as we walked into the lady‚Äôs room, and the girl applied the cover up. ‚ÄúBy the way my name is Stormie.‚Äù I smiled faintly. ‚ÄúNice to meet you, Stormie.‚Äù She smiled back at me. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Summer SilverMoon, I just transferred, so today is my first day.‚Äù She replied, stood back, and admired her work. ‚ÄúThere all covered up.‚Äù She turned me to look in the mirror. ‚ÄúWhoa!‚Äù I gasped. Whatever she did, she was able to cover every single bruise and cut. I need to ask her how to do that. ‚ÄúThank you. I really appreciate it.‚Äù I softly said. ‚ÄúNo problem. Would you tell me who did this to you?‚Äù She asked. I stood there in silence, no one ever asked me about my bruises. They always walked by and ignored me. ‚ÄúI know we just met but if you ask for help, I can help you.‚Äù Summer offered. I wanted to ask for help, but I was scared. I knew that Fred would never let me go, he would follow me to the end of the world if he had to.







Chapter 3


When Summer realized that I wasn‚Äôt going to answer her she changed the subject. ‚ÄúSo, what class are you going to? Ethics with Mr. Sheridan.‚Äù ‚ÄúHey me too!‚Äù She said with excitement. ‚ÄúBut he‚Äôs not the instructor anymore.‚Äù She said as we walked into the classroom. ‚ÄúWhat? He‚Äôs been teaching since the semester started.‚Äù I frowned. ‚ÄúYeah, rumor is that he was in a car accident over the weekend, so there‚Äôs a new instructor.‚Äù She explained. How did I not know this? I asked myself. Oh yeah, three 3-year-old little terrors, my little terrors. I have no time for anything else outside of them, right now, they are my life. We walked into the classroom, and I started making my way to my normal seat at the top of the room. Summer tugged at my arm and led me to the second-row corner seats. I shook my head no. I didn‚Äôt like sitting so close, it was easier for me to stay invisible, especially when I had bruises to hide. ‚ÄúSummer, I‚Äôm gonna go sit up there, these seats are just too close to the front.‚Äù I said pointing to my regular seat and lowering my head. ‚ÄúNo, please sit with me. I can‚Äôt see the board from way up there and you‚Äôre the only person I know.‚Äù Summer pouted. I groaned, I hate pouting, the triplets do it all the time, Summer reminded me of them. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt pout!‚Äù I groaned at her. She kept her pout going and gave puppy dog eyes. ‚ÄúUuggg‚Ä¶fine, okay.‚Äù I grumbled and Summer squealed in delight. I shook my head and settled into my seat as the rest of the class started making their way in. I got a few glances and stares, but I just kept my head down and chatted with Summer.



‚ÄúOh, my Goddess!‚Äù A shrill voice came from behind us. Have you seen our new instructor?! She excitedly asked her friend. I rolled my eyes. ‚ÄúI got a peek at him and the other guy as I passed by his office on my way here.‚Äù She smirked. ‚ÄúThey are both beyond hot and they don‚Äôt even look that much older than us. I am so going to love getting into his pants.‚Äù She smirked as she adjusted her boobs. ‚ÄúSuch whores.‚Äù Summer snorted and I snorted out a laugh. ‚ÄúExcuse you! No one was talking to you or asked for your opinion. You and the invisible girl need to mind your own business.‚Äù She spit back at us. ‚ÄúI can say whatever I want.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the one telling the whole class what you‚Äôre THINKING will happen. I‚Äôm not here to listen to your wanna be conquests. This is not a dating service; this is a place of higher education. If you‚Äôre just here to find your mate, then I think you‚Äôre in the wrong place.‚Äù Summer coolly said. Wait?! Did Summer just say mate? This is the second time I‚Äôve heard that word MATE, is it like the Australian people use the word MATE. I‚Äôll have to remember to ask her about that later. ‚ÄúOh puh-lease, you‚Äôre just jealous.‚Äù The girl said looking at her manicured fingers. ‚ÄúWe can get any guy we want anytime we want.‚Äù She bragged. Summer snorted so hard that she blew her coffee out her nose. ‚ÄúMe jealous? Of you?‚Äù Summer snorted wiping her face. Storm couldn‚Äôt help but laugh at the whole situation and when she finally got herself together she said, ‚ÄúYeah sure, keep telling yourself that Barbie doll. The only guys you will get are little boys, not MEN.‚Äù Summer said.



I was still giggling when the most amazing scent hit my nose, sandalwood, and fresh cut grass. A small, low whimper escaped my lips, OH DAMN. I hoped that no one heard that. I looked towards the door where the scent was coming from. Oh, my dear heavenly skittles, it‚Äôs him, the Greek God I bumped into this morning. He lifted his nose like he is sniffing the air and looked around, his eyes shifted to pitch black as we locked eyes. We stared at each other for a few seconds before he broke eye contact licking his bottom lip. All I could feel was a shiver run down my spine. Why didn‚Äôt his scent hit me earlier? I have no idea what‚Äôs going on but whatever it is, I can‚Äôt‚Ä¶ let myself have feelings for anyone. Fred will kill him and me. ‚ÄúHey. you, okay?‚Äù Summer nudged me. ‚ÄúHuh? Yeah, I‚Äôm good.‚Äù I said, feeling my face blush. ‚ÄúLooks like someone has the hots for the teacher.‚Äù Summer sniggered. The girl behind us leaned into my ear and said, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt even think about it, he‚Äôs mine. Besides, why would he want a nobody like you? He‚Äôs not gonna want to be stuck with a single mom with three little monsters.‚Äù I could feel my anger rising, my jaw clenched, and my hands balled into tight fists. I was ready to beat the shit outta this skank, she needs to stay away from him. Before I could do anything else, I felt a presence next to me. ‚ÄúIs there a problem, ladies?‚Äù He asked in his smooth and husky voice, for some reason, just the sound of his voice helped calm and soothe me. How is that even possible? ‚ÄúNo, no problem prof.‚Äù Summer commented glaring at the girls behind her. ‚ÄúWell, please be respectful in my class ladies. This classroom will be treated as a professional work atmosphere just as if you are in an actual business setting.‚Äù He said but more to the skanks sitting behind us. ‚ÄúI would hate to hafta treat you like children but I‚Äôm going to ask you two to take seats on the other side of the room.‚Äù I started to gather my things. ‚ÄúNo, not you two but the two behind you.‚Äù He said motioning to the skanks. ‚ÄúWhat?! Why?!‚Äù Skank number one asked with surprise. ‚ÄúBut, but‚Ä¶‚Äù She stammered out. ‚ÄúPlease, go take your new seats, we need to get class started. And those will be your regular seats from now on.‚Äù He announced. ‚ÄúThe seats you are in will be your assigned seats and the person to your right will be your assigned partner. If no one is sitting next to you or you don‚Äôt have a partner by the end of class, see me during my office hours.‚Äù He said as he made his way down to the podium. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve never had assigned seats!‚Äù Skank one grumbled. ‚ÄúWell, this is my class now, and I assign seats.‚Äù He told her raising an eyebrow at her. 







Chapter 4


Summer chuckled and sent a small wave bye to them. I took my seat, and I could feel him watching me from the corner of his eye. I would steal a few glances at him and the last time I did, he caught me, he smiled and threw a quick wink at me. Oh, cheese and crackers, my panties are in trouble. I can‚Äôt let this happen! Fred would kill me; he‚Äôs never going to let me go. He‚Äôs already told me, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve NEVER been on a date. I don‚Äôt even want to think about what would happen, who would take care of the triplets. I have to stay away from him, somehow. I just don‚Äôt know how or if I can do that, I‚Äôm drawn to him, but I have no idea why? He started his lecture, but I wasn‚Äôt really listening, I‚Äôm glad that I had a small recorder set up. I was so caught up in my own thoughts, the what if‚Äôs, the can not‚Äôs, the why can‚Äôt my life be different, why couldn‚Äôt I have a normal family life. Am I ever going to be happy? Am I ever going to fall in love and have a family of my own? What about my siblings, will they grow up happy? Or will they be condemned to a life of hell with Fred and our mom.



Yeah, some mother she is. After my dad died, she lost it. I was ten when my dad died, my world fell apart and I thought that my mom and me would get through it together, but she would go out and be gone for hours and then eventually she‚Äôd be gone for days at a time. I knew right then and there that I was on my own. Nancy packed us up the day after dad‚Äôs funeral and we moved to some decrepit house across the country so, I had no other family to turn to, I had to grow up quickly. A few months later mom came home and told me that she‚Äôs pregnant and the father of the baby would be living with them. He just had to be near his child and his female, as he called her. Mom was never the same after she got together with Fred, it‚Äôs like she was under some spell of his that wouldn‚Äôt let her go. We had no idea that she was having triplets until the day they were born. They were squishy little things, but I fell in love with them immediately. They were my family, and I was never going to let anything happen to them.



‚ÄúStorm. Hey hello. Earth to Stormie.‚Äù I heard Summer as she snapped her fingers in front of my face. ‚ÄúHuh, what?‚Äù I said coming out of my daze. ‚ÄúWhere did you go?‚Äù She chuckled. ‚ÄúSorry. Just getting lost in my own thoughts.‚Äù I shrugged. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been told that I‚Äôm a pretty good listener.‚Äù She says with a comforting smile. ‚ÄúThanks, but I don‚Äôt want to burden you with my problems.‚Äù I shrugged my shoulders. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a bother. It‚Äôll be good to let it all out. If you let it sit and fester, you may end up snapping and then you will be committed, and I would have to break you out and we would be on the run with your three little monsters. Way too much drama so, let‚Äôs just grab lunch at the caf√© and talk.‚Äù She suggested with a chuckle. I let out a small snort. I know she meant nothing bad when she called the triplets little monsters. ‚ÄúUh, no, not the caf√©. I had a rather embarrassing moment there.‚Äù I scrunch my nose. Summer giggled. ‚ÄúWhen and where do you not have an embarrassing moment?‚Äù She snickered. ‚ÄúHey.‚Äù I laughed, nudging Summer with my elbow. ‚ÄúExcuse me, Miss‚Ä¶‚Äù I looked up and low and behold it‚Äôs my Greek God. I was at a loss of words, ‚Äúwholly shitzu! What‚Äôs my name? I can‚Äôt remember my name!‚Äù I heard muffled laughing in the back of mind. After a few seconds, I finally remembered my name and found my voice, maybe. ‚ÄúS-Storm, m-my n-name is S-St-Storm Hawk.‚Äù I stuttered out as Summer continued to cover her mouth trying not to laugh at me as I shoot her a death glare. ‚ÄúWell, Storm, please give me a few minutes, I would like to speak with you.‚Äù He said, giving me a small smile. I swallowed the big lump that formed in my throat. ‚ÄúUuumm...o-okay.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know what to say, all I wanted to do was run and hide. ‚ÄúOkay then, I will go grab our lunch and meet you in the quad.‚Äù Summer said flashing me a mischievous grin, giving me two thumbs up and wiggling her brows. I shook my head and rolled my eyes at her as she made her way out of the room. ‚ÄúExcuse me, Mr.‚Ä¶, I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt get your name.‚Äù Her shrill voice brought me back to attention making me cringe. ‚ÄúActually, I don‚Äôt think I gave my name.‚Äù He said keeping a close eye on me. ‚ÄúOh, well anyway, I wanted to invite you for a drink to apologize for my earlier behavior.‚Äù Skank said, giving me a snide smile. ‚ÄúActually, I think you owe Ms. Hawk and the rest of the class an apology for your behavior and taking up their class time. Not to mention for calling her children‚Ä¶‚Äù he looked at me and squinted ‚Äú‚Ä¶little monsters. Do you know them? Do you know for a fact that they are little monsters?‚Äù He scolded her like I would the triplets. I couldn‚Äôt help myself, but I threw a smirk at the skank. I couldn‚Äôt believe I just did that; I‚Äôve never done that before; it would usually end up with me being slapped across the face. Fred would definitely punish me if he found out. So as quickly as the smirk appeared, it disappeared.""



Chapter 5


Besides she‚Äôs just the invisible girl, it‚Äôs not like she matters. She‚Äôs just a stupid, weak human.‚Äù She said standing closer to him rubbing his arm. I don‚Äôt know why but there was something in me that made me wanted to rip skanks arms off. I was jealous. No way! How can I be jealous over someone I doesn‚Äôt even know? I don‚Äôt even know his name. I narrowed my eyes at the skank. I wanted to say something, but I kept my mouth shut. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name?‚Äù He asked the skank sweetly. I want to vomit; this is disgusting. Skank gives him what I assume is supposed to be a seductive smile. ‚ÄúGwen Lloyd.‚Äù Skank said running her finger across her collar bone. Blahhhhhh, I just vomited in my mouth. ‚ÄúMs. Lloyd, first of all, dating a student is strictly forbidden, so that is going to be a NO to the drink. Second, you need to remove your hand from me, my mate will not appreciate the unwanted touching.‚Äù He said removing her hand from his arm. ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just reject her and let me be the one to please you in ways she never could. I can drive you wild.‚Äù She whispered, well not really whisper because I heard her. She was as quiet as a bullhorn. I wished I hadn‚Äôt heard her though, whoever his mate is, she is one lucky girl. I assume, at this point, that mate means girlfriend, boyfriend, significant other. I‚Äôm so confused. I have no idea what alternate world I‚Äôve been thrown into.



I didn‚Äôt want to stay and continue to watch this, so I slowly turned and started to walk out of the room. ‚ÄúMs. Hawk, I need you to stay please. We have a few matters to discuss. Ms. Lloyd, please exit the room and I suggest that you drop this class and perhaps even find a new major that is more suited to your abilities.‚Äù Oh, crap! He didn‚Äôt just say that. She was angry, I could see it in her eyes. I guess no one has ever spoken to her like that. ‚ÄúHow dare you!!‚Äù She yelled. ‚ÄúYou will pay for this!‚Äù She said, slapping him and then stomping out. I wanted to run and soothe the spot she slapped but I had to stop myself. I felt bad, this was, after all, my fault. Now he‚Äôs going to get in trouble. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. I didn‚Äôt mean for any of this to happen.‚Äù I whispered. He gave me a confused look. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have anything to apologize for, you did nothing wrong, none of this is your fault. Besides, I won‚Äôt get in trouble.‚Äù He tried to assure me. ‚ÄúI have you as my witness that she was the one who threw herself at me and I politely declined.‚Äù He smiled. I shrugged. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶yeah, just let me know if anyone needs to talk to me.‚Äù I told him. We were quiet for a few minutes. ‚ÄúMaybe I should go.‚Äù I walked to the door, before I could even put my hand on the doorknob, I was swiftly turned to face him and he had me caged in between his arms. He lowered his face to mine, his warm minty breath fanning against my lips. He leaned in close to my ear and I heard him inhale. ‚ÄúMmmmm, such a sweet scent, vanilla, and honeysuckle.‚Äù He whispered as he kissed the flesh in the crook of my neck. I had to bite my bottom lip to keep myself from releasing the moan that had built up. All I could do at this point was fist his shirt in my hands and close my eyes. I couldn‚Äôt move, I couldn‚Äôt run, not that I wanted to, all this felt so good and so right for some reason. As much as this felt right, I had to get away from him, I can‚Äôt get involved with anyone, especially not my instructor. ‚ÄúS-s-sir, p-p-please, l-l-l-let m-me g-g-go.‚Äù I was finally able to shutter out. 



Before I could say anything else, a male voice yelled from the top of the lecture hall, ‚ÄúBlas√©, c‚Äômon let‚Äôs‚Ä¶ Silas, you shit, get out!‚Äù My instructor, who I know now, his name is Blas√©. This Silas guy came bouncing down the stairs. ‚ÄúDude‚Ä¶oh shit! Sorry, didn‚Äôt know you were giving private tutoring.‚Äù He grinned. ‚ÄúSilas! If you don‚Äôt get outta here, you‚Äôre not walking out of here on your own.‚Äù Blas√© said sounding angry. He released his grip enough for me to open the door and I high tailed it outta there. ‚ÄúStorm! Wait, please come back.‚Äù He shouted at me for me to stop. There was no way I was going to stop. I ran out of there making my way to the quad, I needed to find Summer. ‚ÄúHey Stormie! Over here.‚Äù Summer call out. I made my way over to where she was sitting. ‚ÄúHey Summer.‚Äù I said still trying to catch my breath. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about time, I thought you forgot about me.‚Äù She frowned at me. ‚ÄúSorry, I got held up.‚Äù I told her. ‚ÄúI bet you did.‚Äù She giggled and winked at me. ‚ÄúHere eat, you look a little pale.‚Äù She said handing me my lunch. I took the bag that held a roast beef sandwich, chips, and tea. I was actually pretty hungry; I didn‚Äôt get a chance to have breakfast because of my little fiasco this morning. We sat in silence for a while, I was lost in my thoughts over the events of earlier. ‚ÄúHow could this be happening? I‚Äôm so confused.‚Äù I whispered to myself thinking no one could hear me. ‚ÄúHow could what happen? What are you confused about Mimi?‚Äù She asked looking at me with true concern.



‚ÄúWait? What?‚Äù I stared at her. ‚ÄúDid you just call me Mimi?‚Äù She shrugged her shoulders. ‚ÄúYeah. I like it, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù She asked a little sad. ‚ÄúNo one has ever given me a nickname before.‚Äù I smiled. ‚ÄúWell, you have one now. So, tell me what happened that had you running here like your ass was on fire?‚Äù She asked giving me a warm concerned smile. 



Chapter 6


The skank huffed. ‚ÄúThat is not going to happen. I do not apologize to anyone for anything. I took a deep breath. ‚ÄúThis is going to sound absolutely crazy but what is a mate?‚Äù Her eyes went a little wide. ‚ÄúI heard you mention it earlier and well‚Ä¶‚Äù I paused; Summer motioned for me to continue. ‚ÄúI bumped into our instructor this morning when I was running out of the caf√©. When he looked at me, he said, Mate - Mine.‚Äù I explained. ‚ÄúAnd what did you do?‚Äù She asked biting into her food. ‚ÄúI freaked out and ran, then you found me on the ground.‚Äù I stopped again taking a drink of my tea and then looking around. I wanted to make sure that no one was listening. Summer sat quietly waiting for me to continue. ‚ÄúAfter you left, Gwen the skank.‚Äù I said her name with disgust. ‚ÄúBasically, threw herself at him, it was, she was gross. He told her it was against school policy and that she needed to stop touching him because his mate wouldn‚Äôt appreciate her touching him. He told her to leave, find another major. After she left, pretty pissed off, I might add. I tried to leave but he pinned me to the door and he‚Ä¶he sniffed me. He said I smelled like vanilla and honeysuckle and then he started kissing my neck. I finished scrunching my face. I have no idea what is happening, as freaked out as I was, it felt good and so right. Like I‚Äôm supposed to be with him, but I have no idea what a mate is, and I have NO idea who he is. He said his mate wouldn‚Äôt appreciate her touching him but yet he pinned me to the door and was kissing on me!‚Äù I whisper-yelled. ‚ÄúSo, how was the kiss?‚Äù Summer asked with a huge grin. ‚ÄúSummer!!! That‚Äôs all you got outta what I just said?‚Äù I scolded her. ‚ÄúOh, and what the hell is a MATE?‚Äù I whispered-yelled glaring at her.



‚ÄúStorm!! Get your fat ass over here NOW!‚Äù I froze in fear as his familiar voice filled my ears. ‚ÄúFred? What are you doing here?‚Äù I asked him with my eyes wide with fear as he stalked towards me. Summer stood closer to me. ‚ÄúMimi, are you okay? Who is he?‚Äù She asked. ‚ÄúYou were supposed to be home for lunch! Did you forget we were having guests over? Do you have any idea the embarrassment you caused your mother having to order take out?‚Äù He yelled grabbing my wrist tightly, his nails digging into my skin. I winced in pain. ‚ÄúI left the food in the fridge, all she had to do was put it in the oven for twenty minutes.‚Äù I told him trying to free my now bleeding wrist trying not to make eye contact with him. ‚ÄúThat wasn‚Äôt good enough! Your mother threw it out! She said it wasn‚Äôt even worthy of feeding to a wild animal.‚Äù He was now holding me by my collar. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not my problem! I made what she asked for, if she wanted something different then she should have made it herself!‚Äù I gritted out. I knew the second those words left my mouth, punishment was going to rain down hard on me and of all places, here at school for everyone to see. Next thing I know the side of my face was stinging. I could hear Summer yelling at him. ‚ÄúGet away from her asshole. Don‚Äôt touch her again!‚Äù She growled as his fist came down on me again and again, I fell to the ground, and he started kicking me in the ribs, stomach and anywhere else he could get to. ‚ÄúMind your own business bitch or you‚Äôll be next!‚Äù He growled at her. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to see you try and she is my business!‚Äù Summer snarled back. ‚ÄúSummer, please stop, it‚Äôs okay.‚Äù I whimpered to her.



‚ÄúGET YOUR HANDS OFF HER!!‚Äù I heard someone roar. I tried to crawl away from Fred, but he stomped on my shoulder bring me to a stop as I heard a popping sound. I looked up trying to see what was happening. I heard scuffling, yelps, growls, and grunts. What was going on? I saw Fred thrown to the ground a few feet away from me. He was covered in blood and was a crumpled mess lying next to me. Who did that to him? My vision was starting to blur but I could see a bunch of feet circling around Fred. I just want to curl up in my bed and not come out. ‚ÄúOh, my Goddess, Mimi. What did he do to you?‚Äù Summer gasped. ‚ÄúBlas√©! Get over here, NOW!‚Äù She yelled out. Why is she calling for him? How does she know his name? Does she know him? ‚ÄúMy head is killing me.‚Äù I mumbled. I tried to get up. ‚ÄúI have to get my little ones. They‚Äôre going to be so worried about me.‚Äù I said but I felt myself stumble and before I hit the ground again, a pair of warm arms caught me. I could feel sparks where his fingers touched me. I couldn‚Äôt help but nuzzle closer to him. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay my love. I got you. You‚Äôre safe. He will never hurt you again, no one will hurt you.‚Äù He whispered. Before I faded into darkness, I said, ‚ÄúTriplets.‚Äù



‚ÄúTriplets?‚Äù I repeated looking at Summer. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right, that skank referred to some little monsters.‚Äù Summer said turning towards me. ‚ÄúShe has kids. Three of them?‚Äù I said out loud cradling her in my arms. ‚ÄúSummer go check the day care, maybe they go there. If so, take them back to the pack house, maybe they‚Äôll know what‚Äôs going on and what happened to their mom.‚Äù Summer nodded and sprinted to the daycare center. ‚ÄúBlas√©, what do we do with him? The human authorities are leaving him to us.‚Äù Silas informed. ‚ÄúTake him to the cells, have doc ready also, see what you can find out about my mate and her family.‚Äù I ordered him getting into the back seat of my car still holding my mate. Yes, I have personal driver. ‚ÄúRobbie, get us back to the pack house quickly.‚Äù I demanded. ‚ÄúYou got it boss.‚Äù He quickly but carefully got us to the pack hospital.



‚ÄúAlpha, this way, I have a room ready for her.‚Äù The doctor in charge stated. I followed the doctor into one of the private rooms. 



Chapter 7


‚ÄúWhat happened to her?‚Äù The doc asked examining Storm. ‚ÄúShe has bruises upon bruises!‚Äù She exclaimed. ‚ÄúPoor child who would do this to her?‚Äù She looked at me with tears in her eyes. ‚ÄúIt was her so-called father.‚Äù I told her grinding my teeth. I felt the doctor put her hand on my shoulder. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôll be okay. I‚Äôll run some tests, get some scans, give her fluids, pain medicine, some antibiotics and let her rest; she must be a strong one for her to endure all these injuries.‚Äù She tried to assure me. ‚ÄúBlas√©, I have the triplets.‚Äù Summer mind linked. ‚ÄúThey are scared and are crying for Storm. Also, she‚Äôs their sister not mom. She‚Äôs the one who has cares for them, her mom and Fred, well I think you can figure it out.‚Äù She sighed. ‚ÄúWhere are you?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúI need to make sure they‚Äôre okay, siblings or kids, it‚Äôs all the same to me, I will protect her and them. They are my family now. I‚Äôll be there in a few minutes.‚Äù I told her. I looked over at my still sleeping, well, unconscious mate. How could anyone treat her like this. I could feel the anger and rage build. I moved closer to her, kneeled down, and inhaled her scent, her scent calmed me and my beast. ‚ÄúBlas√©, son.‚Äù My mom‚Äôs voice sounded in the room. She was standing next to me with a frown on her face. My mom is the best, she‚Äôs always been there for me and my siblings, the twins, Silas, and Summer. ‚ÄúSon, you need to come to the house and eat.‚Äù She softly said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been here for over four hours; her little ones are so worried about her.‚Äù ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt leave her mom. Every time I try to get up to leave, my legs get heavy and won‚Äôt move. She needs me. She doesn‚Äôt even know me mom! He never presented her to the pack! I don‚Äôt even know how long she‚Äôs been here.‚Äù I growled. ‚ÄúShe does need you and always will, but you need to keep your strength up or you won‚Äôt be any good to her or those cute little pups of hers.‚Äù She smiled as she said the last part. ‚ÄúYou met them?‚Äù I looked up at her. ‚ÄúYes, they are such sweet little angels. They are also very worried about her, she‚Äôs very important to them. It seems that her love is all they‚Äôve ever had. You should spend some time with them, they could use your assurance.‚Äù She said patting my shoulder. 



‚ÄúAs soon as the doctor comes back with news, I‚Äôll go check on them.‚Äù She kissed the top of my head and left me alone with my mate. I traced my fingers along her jawline, gently rubbing each black and blue mark on her face with each touch, sparks tickled the tips of my fingers. I think she felt the sparks also because her heart rate would spike a little bit and she would softly sigh. ‚ÄúAlpha.‚Äù The doctor called getting my attention. ‚ÄúWhat did you find?‚Äù I was able to croak out. She sighed. ‚ÄúShe has a lot of healed fractures; her ribs have been broken on several occasions. She also has a small fracture along her left cheek, I may have to wire it shut for a week or so. I will need to keep an eye on it and see how it looks over the next day or two. Hopefully it should heal with no problem just make sure on one hit‚Äôs her again.‚Äù I snorted. ‚ÄúNo one will ever touch her like that again!‚Äù I growled. ‚ÄúI know, please try to stay calm. I‚Äôm sorry. I didn‚Äôt mean‚Ä¶‚Äù He started to say. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay. I understand.‚Äù She smiled at me. ‚ÄúHow long does she need to stay here?‚Äù I asked still watching my mate. ‚ÄúAs soon as she wakes, I want to make sure there are no other unseen issues.‚Äù She advised. ‚ÄúAlpha, you should go eat and get some rest. I‚Äôll call you if there are changes.‚Äù Dr. Reese told me. ‚ÄúThe second she opens her eyes, no matter what time or what I am doing.‚Äù I demanded of her. ‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù She agreed. 



‚ÄúI‚Äôll also need for you to check her three siblings.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhere are they?‚Äù ‚ÄúThey are at the pack house, my mom has been looking after them, so you‚Äôll need to get by her.‚Äù I chuckled. ‚ÄúOh dear.‚Äù She mumbled to herself. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll bring them by to visit there sister and you can give them a checkup then.‚Äù I suggested to her. ‚ÄúThank you, that will work.‚Äù She said a little relieved. ‚ÄúMom is very protective of those she considers her babies and I think these three new little ones are falling into that category.‚Äù I sighed and rubbed my face. I want her with me, by my side, in my bed, our bed. I‚Äôve been searching for her since I was sixteen. ‚ÄúFather must die for hurting little mate!‚Äù My wolf grumbled. ‚ÄúI will deal with him.‚Äù I told him. My wolf was ready to tear Fred apart earlier, if Summer hadn‚Äôt called me over, Fred would be dead. ‚ÄúHe should be dead.‚Äù My wolf growled at me. I leaned down and placed a kiss on her cheek. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be back later, my love. I promise. I‚Äôm going to go check on our pups, they‚Äôre worried about you. You need to come back to them, to me, please. I‚Äôve finally found you; I can‚Äôt lose you the same day I found you.‚Äù I whispered in her ear. I felt her shiver a little. I smiled and kissed her again before I walked out.""

I am writing this message  
on the day when I don't know who are you , how do you look, where are you ,  
what you do. So many unknowns.

But one thing I want to  
tell from bottom of my heart. ""**I LOVE YOU"".**¬†

My heart is full of love for you. Every day I think and hope wish I can have a cup  
of coffee with you. I just want to have your presence in my life. I don't have any expectation from you. All I have in my heart is pure love and warmth for you. A desire to your man. A desire to be you compliment energy.

I know when we will meet we both will complete each other, like two missing piece that never quite fit anywhere else

Sometime I wonder‚Ä¶..how do you look? What is your skin colour, how your eyes look, are they deep. I am not fantasising about your looks but a deep desire to know your physical form.

Sometime I think, what is your way of thinking, are you like me , deep thinking, analysing the things till the end. OR are you that bubbly who take the decision on the first thought it comes to you. Again just curious to know your brain.

And some time, I wonder, how is your soul, is it wanderer like me, looking for the meaning of life, trying to find the happiness inside yourself, wondering about the beauty of soul, world, music, taste etc.

I promise and hope when we met, we will see and experience this world together. We will see all the beauty of the world and admire it.

We will watch TajMahal of India and hold our hand together without event realising.

We will order a fancy coffee and cakes in front of Eiffel Tower and get romanticise in each other eyes (of course i will ask you to remove your fancy sun glasses).

We will watch that beautiful green sky in Norway while you head on my shoulder (Please don't judge me if you see a tear drop in my eyes). You have no idea how much I have waited for this night.¬†

When we make love, we will not just physically present with each other, we would be having our soul merged. I will have you tightly in my arms, wrapped our legs in each other. You are so close to my face that I can hear your breath and I can feel your heartbeat. I am all wrapped in your warmness of your body heat. Your beautiful lips are just inch away from my lips and your eyes are tucked in my eyes. We both are getting wet but that moment of soul merging is more beautiful than anything. I can see the drop of sweat rolling from your neck and going towards your beautiful breast. Your beautiful soft breast is just so tightly stuck with my chest. We both can feel each other body heat which is melting our skins and body.

We know we both have waited for this moment for years. So let it happens, all our emotions, desire, love and lust. Let them come out.

I am preparing my heart and soul for you. I am getting ready for the pure love you have for me. Thank you my baby. To be my soul partner. Now I really feel this love and feeling we are having and sharing with each other is not for this lifetime. I want you to be your soul partner in next life or any other life too.

I LOVE YOU. Love you with bottom of my heart. ‚ù§Ô∏è üòòüíì¬†",0,1750770352.0,TrueOffMyChest,5,0.4,False

I used to get a great roast-y flavor that included some acidity but this no longer happens with the same beans. I use the Hoffman v60 technique at about 188 degrees F for a medium-dark roast (1:16 ratio, 45 second 2x bloom, 2 30 second pours and a swirl at the end). Why is this happening?

Is this a polite brush-off to the CMO? Should I wait for the CEO or engage with the CMO?

‚ÄúNo problem, happy to chat when \[CEO\] is back. This‚Äôll make more sense from his chair.‚Äù

My situation right now is, that during the last month, I've successfully gone from 2-3 300 ml cups, to one 100 ml cup of light roast coffee per day. I really was able to do that without much pain.

So, Im wondering if it's worth it to go down all the way to zero coffee per day at this point? I've already noticed some reduction in anxiety (I have anxious personality), and improved sleep. 

Do I have to be completely caffeine-free to get the best out of this? In your experience, is zero caffeine superior to relatively low caffeine consumption?

What kind of experiences you have about quitting all caffeine even with already lower daily consumption?

Thank you.

This week my husband kicked off his tenure as a stay at home dad and our six-year-old had a birthday party!,"Hi all! I submitted a diary in winter 2021 that you can find [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MoneyDiariesACTIVE/comments/ld4ghl/i_am_in_my_early_30s_make_75k_a_year_120k_joint/), and one in spring 2023 that you can find [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MoneyDiariesACTIVE/comments/124k1le/followup_diary_i_am_in_my_mid30s_work_in/)! Since my last diary my income has increased significantly, and we‚Äôve had another baby, survived a major natural disaster, endured a difficult death in the family, and received a small (?) inheritance. All of those factors helped us make the decision for my husband to take a pause from teaching and stay home with the kids for a few years. We know having a parent at home is a huge luxury in 2025 and are really grateful to be able to give it a shot.

# ‚ù§Ô∏è Section 1: Assets and Debt

**Total Net Worth: $396,500** if you believe the equity calculator I reference below. Much less if you think equity is fake money, which I kind of do!

**Retirement Balance: $227K.** We received an inheritance from my late father last year, which was passed down from my late grandmother, all in the form of stocks; presently it is valued at about **$150K.** We are treating this like a retirement fund. Additionally I have **$45K** across two 401ks, and my husband, L, has **$30K** in the state plan, after 10 years of teaching (sigh).

**Savings Account Balance: $39K.** This is our ‚Äúemergency fund‚Äù in a HYSA. It is the result of prioritizing this fund over the last few years and a $18K life insurance payout after my father died.¬†

**Checking Account Balance:** About **$2.5K**, right now. We put most of our spending on credit cards, and I obsessively pay on them throughout the month.

**Credit Card Debt:** None! We paid this off in 2023, wahoo.

**Car Loan Debt:** About **$20K** owed on our used Ascent. We opted for a larger emergency fund vs paying this off since I‚Äôm the sole earner now.

**Student Loan Debt: $80K** for L‚Äôs undergrad and MAT. **$18K** for my undergrad and (unfinished, womp womp) MAT. The SAHD plan has us throwing caution to the absolute wind as L is up for loan forgiveness in August, assuming several factors that aren‚Äôt guaranteed at this time (PSLF is [very confusing](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/31/nx-s1-5343770/trump-student-loan-forgiveness) right now!). If the GOP doesn‚Äôt cancel PSLF altogether, L‚Äôs loans will be forgiven two months after he returns to work. I have worked exclusively for the kinds of orgs targeted by Project 2025 since leaving the classroom, so I‚Äôm [not hopeful mine will be forgiven](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/07/nx-s1-5321313/trump-executive-action-public-service-loan-program) by this admin.¬†

**Equity: $226K**. This number is from an online equity calculator, and is for our century-old house in a walkable neighborhood in a popular Southern city. You can read the full backstory on our 2022 purchase in my last MD. Blessings on anyone trying to buy a house in America; I found the process to be totally fucked.

‚ù§Ô∏è **Section 2: Income**

***Monthly Take Home:*** My base pay at my full-time job is **$170K**. I also work occasionally for a consulting firm in my industry on the side. That income really varies, but I typically hold 8 hours a month for that work, which amounts to **$12K** a year. Thus I bring in about **$11K** a month (or $182K/year). This is after taxes on my full-time pay and about $500/month in insurance (work covers almost the full cost of our family‚Äôs insurance).¬†

***Income Progression:*** I‚Äôve been working since I was 15 years old, moved out at 18, and paid my own bills starting that year, but income below starts the year I graduated college.

**Year 1:** $15,000 (part time ABA therapist, full time baby anarchist)

**Years 2-8:** $28,000 (This is a rough average of my income across these years. I accepted a spot in Teach for America right out of college for the stable salary, despite my maximalist politics at the time. With that salary, I paid for L‚Äôs expenses in college and supported my mom, sister, and father variably over the years. When I took a big pay cut to organize full-time around year 6, L‚Äôs teacher salary helped support us).

**Year 9:** $45,000 (got a full-time nonprofit fundraising job, quit teaching)

**Year 10:** $55,000 (got a raise)

**Year 11:** $65,000 (got a raise and promotion)

**Year 12:** $75,000 (promoted again)

**Year 13:** $98,000 (new job!)

**Year 14:** $125,000 (promoted)

**Year 15:** $135,000 (promoted again); got a new job at $160K later that year.

**Year 16:** $170,000 (significant merit raise early this year)

‚ù§Ô∏è **Section 3: Expenses**

**Mortgage, Taxes, & Insurance:** A sneeze away from **$3K** for a 2000 sq foot home in the middle of town.

**Investment Contribution:** Starting this month, we‚Äôre going to put **$600** in an account for L‚Äôs retirement. My job contributes 3% of my paycheck, no match required, to a 401k, which comes out to around $425 a month. I may start contributing more to that plan after we get our expenses down.

**Savings Contribution:** We have to get our spending down significantly to save meaningfully on my $11K take home. For example, this month we‚Äôre on track to spend $10.5K. Part of that is because we paid our dear nanny for her last two weeks of work while L wrapped up at school (to the tune of $1700), but part of it is also because I bought a [new dress](https://shopnoble.com/products/noble-utility-dress-in-oat-milk?variant=45116661661834&country=US&tw_source=google&tw_adid=751648222308&tw_campaign=22548995975&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=22548995975&gbraid=0AAAAADkiyhm2KoannmJZCbJy9UaxMyQoz&gclid=CjwKCAjwgb_CBhBMEiwA0p3oOOuvXaNKJxATARYVR0io9MLVuoAUefHizchQUSvmxO4kQ1ZgeFXxrxoCu0UQAvD_BwE), because we‚Äôve already spent $285 on meals out, because I elected to make $100 in donations this month so far, etc. TL;DR the goal is to save at least $500 in addition to L‚Äôs retirement contribution, but I‚Äôm not sure where we‚Äôll land.

**Debt Payments:** Student loan payments are still paused for us, and we are in no hurry to restart. Because of all the confusion, we have no sense of when L‚Äôs next required payment might be or what amount it will be. If it‚Äôs really high, it will likely affect the retirement contribution and/or our savings.

**Electric/Gas: $150ish,** varies significantly. We installed a high-efficiency wood stove when we moved in, which cuts down on the cost of our old furnace a bit.¬†

**Internet: $80,** but reimbursed by work.

**Water: $75**

**Cellphone: $100**, for L & I both

**Subscriptions: $13** Spotify; **$12** Youtube music; **$2.99** Apple data; **$24** Netflix; **$22** NYT, for newspaper and cooking app. I also pay yearly: **$40** for the Freedom app, **$20** for Hobnob, **$60** for Insight Timer, **$50** for ABC Mouse, and **$50** for Homer.

**Car Payment and Insurance: $450** monthly payment for a new-to-us 2021 Subaru Ascent, which we bought right before a major natural disaster displaced us for 3 months last year. Have never regretted a major purchase less! We also have a paid-off 2012 Honda Fit. We pay about **$875 for insurance twice a year**. It covers the Ascent, the Honda, and my father-in-law‚Äôs old Chevy which he gave to us a couple years ago. We recently re-gifted the Chevy to L‚Äôs brother, so I guess I need to ask him to pay us back for the insurance.

**Medical/Therapy:** My therapist is **$200** a session, and I see her once a month (pending emotional disasters, which do happen with some frequency given my family of origin). B just started therapy once a week, which has a **$30** copay each visit.Otherwise, pretty much everything is covered by our insurance or has a small and only occasional copay.

**Pet Expenses:** Our precious pittie suffered some injuries before we adopted her. She‚Äôs on Gabapentin daily for pain management which is about **$60** a month.

**Gym memberships: $86** for a family Y membership**.**

**Donations: Varies**. We give **$10** monthly to the Working Families Party. We give one-off donations when asked or when we come across a need, usually $50-$100 at a time. I just joined a local board, and we‚Äôll probably make a yearly gift to that org once we have our finances figured out.

**Childcare: $0**. Unless you count losing L‚Äôs salary, in which case the cost is about $50K/year. We will spend occasionally on babysitting this year, but it‚Äôs no longer a fixed expense.

**Kids‚Äô Activities:** We budget **$150** monthly for ‚Äúfamily fun,‚Äù which is where these expenses live.

**Outdoorsy memberships: $110** yearly for memberships to nonprofit parks, botanical gardens, etc etc. These are not too expensive and a fun way to spend a day with our kids.

**House cleaner: $320**. They come twice a month and charge **$160** each time. This is some of the best money we spend each month.

**Nuuly: $104, occasionally**. I don‚Äôt purchase this during months I‚Äôm not travelling for work.¬†

‚ù§Ô∏è **Section 4: Money Diary**

# ‚ú® DAY 1: TUESDAY‚ú®

**4:30 am:** I wake up for no discernable reason and try to make myself sleep until the more-reasonable hour of 5 am. B was up several times last night excited for his 6th birthday, and F, our one-year-old, was up twice and ended up in our bed, as she does most nights. I can‚Äôt sleep, though, so I roll over and turn on the smart plug to our coffee machine remotely. This is the life hack to end all life hacks, and I must recommend.

**5:00 am:** Downstairs, drinking coffee. Our fireplace is decorated for B‚Äôs 6th birthday, which is today, with sparkly bunting and gold balloons that spell YAY! A few small presents are wrapped on top of the woodstove, and on the kitchen table is the Big Present: a Playmobil pirate set complete with a truly giant ship. L found it on Facebook marketplace and set it up in a cute vignette last night. I sit on the couch and work for about an hour before the kids wake up.

**6:00 am:** B is up and thrilled with the pirate ship. We play for a while, then wake up L and F and open the other presents. One of his favorite gifts is the Fishwife smoked salmon, which he has been begging us to buy him for months. He eats it for breakfast alongside a blueberry muffin and looks over his new Magic Treehouse books. Meanwhile, F eats peanut butter oatmeal and practices walking. Overall, a very cute birthday morning.

I consider going to my workspace after my breakfast (granola and greek yogurt), but decide to brave the work day at home instead. I‚Äôm really tired, and I also want to experience B‚Äôs birthday as much as I can through my office door.

On work: I‚Äôm about nine months into a new job, and it‚Äôs pretty demanding. The reasons why are layered: my role is quite senior, cuts across multiple departments, and requires lots of travel, calls, strategy, and untangling. As I approach a year on the team, it‚Äôs becoming clear the organization has unclear lines of decision making and lots of simmering tension across staff. And, if I‚Äôm honest, my income growth over the last five years is due in part to my willingness to shoot above my experience level when I apply out. All of this combines into really challenging work day-to-day. This is a big part of the reason L decided to stay home: I just couldn‚Äôt keep up with being the primary parent (simply because I work from home ‚Äì his teaching schedule didn‚Äôt allow any flexibility during the school year) and the primary breadwinner.¬†

**12:30 pm:** Several detailed spreadsheets and two project proposals later, I emerge to heat up some pizza in the microwave. I made it the other night for dinner using [Joanna‚Äôs crust recipe](https://magnolia.com/recipe/40de6344-b059-4fb6-a888-537ea4b6e6a9/homemade-pizza-dough/?srsltid=AfmBOor-1H7qoGato1FaCDRse2temIsL_TF0JpV4eOLZP-lVQkB1IxdF), and, honestly? It continues to deliver.

**3:00 pm:** L and the kids have gone to a summer event held by the parks & rec department. They stop at Pelican‚Äôs on the way home, and B gets a big purple situation with whipped cream on top. I think L got something too. **$13**¬†

Meanwhile, I‚Äôm off-camera on a poorly facilitated, tortuous group call making dinner ‚Äì greek bowls with couscous! I recommend this [Trader Joe‚Äôs Greek Chickpeas Copycat Recipe](https://modernbites.com/copycat-trader-joes-greek-chickpeas-recipe/) should you be as obsessed with that staple as we are.¬†

**4:30 pm:** I wrap up a little early today, and L picks up where I left off on dinner. B is happily playing with his new toys, so F and I head out just the two of us to the weekly farmer‚Äôs market in our neighborhood. In an effort to limit my spending, I take along $20 in cash. At the farmer‚Äôs market, we spend **$18** on spinach, purple cauliflower, local hummus, and a tip for the musicians who turn out to be one of my favorite regional folk-punk bands from the naughties. F bops to the music and makes friends with another baby.¬†

My sister, J, and her husband, H, are coming over tonight to celebrate B, so I decide to pop by the wine shop and buy a beaujolais rose. This is *not* covered by my remaining $2 cash. **$28**

**5:30 pm:** Back at home, we eat greek bowls and watermelon for dinner and have a movie night to celebrate B. J and H bring an ice cream cake to the party, and it‚Äôs very well-received. Everything is precious, hooray.



We put the kids to bed around 8; I‚Äôm asleep by 10.

**üåø DAILY TOTAL: $59**

# ‚ú®DAY 2: WEDNESDAY‚ú®

**4:30 am:** Wake up with F somehow upside down and sideways in the bed. I am determined to sleep more for my HEALTH!!!!! So I rotate her around and read the NYT real estate section on my phone for a bit. Works like a charm!¬†

**6:12 am:** Very proud to have slept in this late! I head downstairs, where B is already up, dressed in undies and a frog hat. We work together on a lego set my sister got him for his birthday. L and F come down soon after. For breakfast B and F have protein waffles and fruit with some dulce de leche (it was a birthday gift! it‚Äôs fine!) and the adults have green smoothies.

L has a doctor‚Äôs appointment ‚Äì just a checkup! ‚Äì at 8am, which has a **$30** copay. When he gets back, I head to my workspace, lunch and iced coffee in tow. On the way, I listen to Ezra Klein‚Äôs latest episode featuring [Rep. Sarah McBride](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/17/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-sarah-mcbride.html). Her analysis on why the Left has lost America on trans issues and much more is interesting and worth a listen (though I know it‚Äôs gotten [some blowback](https://open.substack.com/pub/erininthemorn/p/what-sarah-mcbride-gets-wrong?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=994764&post_id=166428528&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=false&r=9s792&token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxNjQzMjMxMCwicG9zdF9pZCI6MTY2NDI4NTI4LCJpYXQiOjE3NTA0NzM4NjEsImV4cCI6MTc1MzA2NTg2MSwiaXNzIjoicHViLTk5NDc2NCIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.NxAeixog0CMakzekb_WJhOGZFQ5O9BlhM6ZKCxlZALw) for being too conciliatory, now). One of my favorite quotes of hers was halfway through (emphasis mine):

*I think the dynamic with social media is that the most outrageous, the most extreme, the most condemnatory content is what gets amplified the most. It‚Äôs what gets liked and retweeted the most, and people mistake getting likes and retweets as a sign of effectiveness. Those are two fundamentally different things. And I think that, whether it‚Äôs subconscious or even conscious,* ***the rewarding of unproductive conversations has completely undermined the capacity for us as individuals ‚Äî or politically ‚Äî to have conversations that persuade, that open people‚Äôs hearts and minds, that meet them where they are.***

**12:30 pm:** At 12:30 I switch gears from timely projects from my main gig to get on a Zoom with the consulting firm I work with occasionally. This is some of the most exciting work I‚Äôm doing, and the most impactful. I don‚Äôt have much time to work on it, though, and I do tend to get really wrung out on weeks where I have to prioritize it, since those hours have to fall on my lunch break or the early mornings. Luckily, this week is a little lighter than last across the board.¬†



At 1:30, I toggle back to my full-time job ‚Äì and at 2:30, I decide to take a little (real) break and visit L and the kids. My phone says they are at the park next to my workspace. Very fun! I only hang out for 15 minutes but it was really worth it to get outside.

**4:30 pm:** I‚Äôm feeling restless in my little flex space, so I head upstairs to the coffee shop attached to the flex space. One of the perks of this office space is a monthly gift card to the coffee shop. I spend the last $8.55 for this month (not my money ‚Äì work covers this membership!) on a mango smoothie and settle in to finish up my work day.¬†



At 5:45, I‚Äôm finally done with work. I bike home and go out on a quick run while L is at the gym with the kids. On the way back, I pick up some filters for our coffee maker. **$6.20**

**7:00 pm:** L and the kids are home kind of late! We eat leftovers (greek bowls!) and then I make a lot of noise about getting them in the shower, but instead I help B blow these cool new [pollen bubbles](https://www.uncommongoods.com/product/save-the-bees-pollinating-bubbles-kit?srsltid=AfmBOor1Q_QPG-g7iR9NSGkhphQQgaaKGmOvEXCgUnjymR1IiCRlnu-l) my sister bought him, and follow F around while I chat with my neighbor about nasturtiums.¬†

**9:00 pm:** The kids are finally in bed, and L is downstairs playing video games with H, my sister‚Äôs husband and our dear friend. I scroll Facebook marketplace for fun and leisure and go to sleep around 10:30.

**üåø DAILY TOTAL: $36.20**

# ‚ú® DAY 3: THURSDAY‚ú®

**3:45 am:** F is up and crying. It continues until 5 am. A third bottle finally puts her to sleep.¬†

**6:45 am:** B wakes us up to ask if he can play Mario Kart on L‚Äôs Switch. I get up with him ‚Äì L asked last night if I please would be the early riser so he could stay up late with H. Downstairs, I put on a timer so that we both put our screens down before we go full zombie mode, and I happily (or at least, with interest?) [read](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/18/opinion/trump-miller-immigration-ice.html) [on](https://newrepublic.com/article/196860/trump-unexpected-crisis-national-security?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email) [my](https://www.pbs.org/articles/the-meaning-and-history-of-juneteenth-foods?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email) [phone](https://hammerandhope.org/article/trump-europe-meloni-orban) while B plays Mario Kart. Then we read some real-life books together. B is reading more fluently every day and I couldn‚Äôt be more proud and excited for him.

**8:00 am:** Breakfast time! We‚Äôre doing red foods for Juneteenth (the internet said it‚Äôs a thing and I wanted to mark the day with B, at least), so we eat jam toast and watermelon. We consider dying the boiled eggs that we eat with breakfast but decide that‚Äôs a bit much.¬†

L and F come downstairs around 9. After they eat, we go for a family walk, during which B hangs fliers so the older neighbors on our block know about his birthday party parade this weekend. It‚Äôs Earth themed and costumes are encouraged.

**11:30 am:** I put F down for a nap while L and B head to Aldi. The plan is that I‚Äôll sew for a while while she sleeps, and then take the kids later this afternoon so L can have some time to himself, too.¬†

I simply must sew today because I am dying for a new crop top a la [Nooworks](https://nooworks.com/products/crop-top-super-bloom) but they are sixty! six! dollars! I am having a hard time letting go of being the person that could once afford to support a living wage for sewists, but alas: now I am the sewist. I recently cleared out our local Joann‚Äôs of all their most whimsical floral knits during the liquidation sale, so I really have no excuses here besides lack of time.¬†

F sleeps for about an hour, which gives me just enough time to clean the kitchen and cut the pattern. At the store, L buys stuff for B‚Äôs birthday party on Saturday: ingredients for a [quasi-homemade](https://www.mybakingaddiction.com/ice-cream-sandwich-cake/) birthday cake; two watermelons; pears, brie, gouda, and crackers for a cheese tray; some hummus and corn dip; Lacroix aplenty; and some juice boxes. He also buys some staples for us ‚Äì half and half, oat milk, bread, tofu, garbanzo beans, various snacks, etc. The total comes out to **$136.07** which is why Aldi is the GOAT.

**1:15 pm:** We eat lunch together ‚Äì ramen and fruit for the kids, leftover greek bowls for L and I. F is starting to toddle around on her own, and she grins a big grin each time, as though she can‚Äôt believe she‚Äôs nailed it again.

L hangs with the kids for a while and I finish my crop top. It‚Äôs fine! I use this [cheap pattern](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1506820525/crop-tank-top-sewing-pattern-xs-xl?ls=r&ref=items-pagination-6&pro=1&content_source=aec5059dc6bd3cdfcf0ebed775f8de987f79caee%253A1506820525&logging_key=aec5059dc6bd3cdfcf0ebed775f8de987f79caee%3A1506820525), and recommend halving the width of the neck and sleeves as they‚Äôre really chonky. Does anyone have a good pattern for a crop top with sleeves? I don‚Äôt particularly want to draft my own.

**3:00 pm:** I load B and F up for some fun errands: we‚Äôre on the hunt for body and hair paint to prepare for the Earth parade. Our first stop is Michael‚Äôs, where we *do* find special birthday sprinkles, body paint, and thread, but don‚Äôt find hair paint. I buy too much thread, actually, and the total is **$52.84.**

We head to Target for the hair paint and score. By some miracle, we leave with just the hair paint: **$12.18.**

On the way home, B and F share snacks and water in the cutest way, and we get gas for **$42.48.** For reference re: our spending, I only have to fill up once every few weeks, especially when the weather‚Äôs nice and we can walk and bike most places.

**6:00 pm:** While we were out, L shaped the blank for his very first knife! It‚Äôs already beautiful and it‚Äôs not even done! He also started dinner: pasta with a pistachio and mint pesto, which intrigued us as we are forever trying to find ways to use up the metric ton of mint in our garden. While he finishes cooking, the kids play outside and I fertilize most of our roses. I feel very accomplished ‚Äì I‚Äôve been meaning to do this for months!

The kids are tired today and we‚Äôre trying to get them in bed at a reasonable time. It works! They‚Äôre asleep by 8, and I‚Äôm working on this money diary in bed by 9. I also text our beloved babysitter about watching the kids Monday night while we hang out with my sister and my best friend, who‚Äôs coming to town this weekend; and text our neighbor teen about walking the dog a few times to prep for dog and house sitting during a little weekend vacation we‚Äôre taking next week with my mom. Life is costly, and sometimes fun.

**11:00 pm:** Horreur: F is up and crying, and nothing we do except letting her sleep in the big bed placates her. We try in vain to put her back in her bed for hours, and then give up. Once she wins, she snoozes between us easily.¬†

**üåø DAILY TOTAL: $243.57**

# ‚ú® DAY 4: FRIDAY‚ú®

**6 am:** Today is a ‚Äúsummer Friday‚Äù at work so I‚Äôm off again! I wake up with B, tired from F‚Äôs antics last night. We read together on the couch while I drink my coffee, and split one of my favorite budget coffee accompaniments: [Benton‚Äôs Breakfast Biscuits.](https://shop.aldi.us/store/aldi/products/20110059-benton-s-cinnamon-breakfast-biscuits-8-8-oz)¬†

Today I am determined to a) clean this house and b) get the children out of the house afterwards so it stays clean. Likely an impossible combo, but my reasons are solid: my best friend arrives to stay for the weekend! And my mom, in-laws, and grandparents are coming for the party, along with maybe the whole neighborhood. Our house has to be perfectly clean for the VIP adults, and needs to be in order so it can be properly destroyed by the three- to eight-year-old set.

**7 am:** As soon as L wakes up, I dash upstairs to clean the guest room. Last week marked L‚Äôs last day as a teacher, and he brought boxes and boxes of art and art supplies home from school with him. Some of his work is still out in the guest room, and I must prepare it for bestie. In the process I decide to clean out the closet and determine that we must list several baby items on Facebook marketplace. I delegate the pictures to L and promise to write the descriptions. He does a bang-up job. While I‚Äôm cleaning, he makes breakfast: omelets for us all!¬†

**9 am:** B and I collaborate on his birthday cake, and find we do not have enough cool whip to finish it. I come from a long line of bakers (think the [Cake Bible](https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=l&ai=DChsSEwiejb_9qIKOAxWaoVoFHXnYOcMYACICCAEQAxoCdnU&co=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwsNnCBhDRARIsAEzia4DS9dBq7U3or5-ex3fSx-sMK6ZDBjbBe87VzhEDMnM-tZ5DAIVWNO4aAs3wEALw_wcB&category=acrcp_v1_48&sig=AOD64_0yFtoZiV_tbCGphkzOjNrnOBNK9Q&ctype=5&q=&ved=2ahUKEwjs1br9qIKOAxXQSjABHbViC6YQ9aACKAB6BAgoEBs&adurl=), elaborate made-by-hand cheesecakes, etc) and kind of can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm in this place where I‚Äôm using cool whip rather than making my own whipped cream. But please believe me when I tell you this represents growth.

After the cake is complete, L and I join forces to clean as much and as quickly as possible while also supervising our children ‚Äì a mighty feat. Then, I take F upstairs for a nap. She and I both are exhausted. L retreats to his shop, and B plays in the back yard.

**11 am:** I bring F downstairs and check in on L‚Äôs knife progress. It‚Äôs progressing! While L preps lunch, B and I walk over to the grocery store for a few party needs: that cool whip, two boxes of forks, some napkins, and a little more cheese for the masses. The total comes to **$20.18**.¬†

While we‚Äôre out, I cannot resist the pull of the thrift stores nearby. I feel I must find a new outfit for this party (I really should have just ordered a Nuuly this month). We pop into the thrift store across the street from the grocery store and proceed to discover many treasures. B discovers a clown costume ($16) and a cat mask ($8): both fit perfectly and are must-buys. I find some cheetah print shorts ($10), a pair of giant tortiseshell sunglasses ($10), and 60‚Äôs wrap pants that are an absolute contraption (they look like [this](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1012202930/70s-chessa-davis-wide-leg-pants-floral?ls=s&ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=vintage&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=floral+wrap+pants+60s&ref=sr_gallery-1-14&sr_prefetch=1&pro=1&frs=1&nob=1&content_source=5fc91a84-3a00-4a9f-84d5-91ffa5c53df4%253A87550f903284d6ae1c161ccd73861f57e6e94cbc&organic_search_click=1&logging_key=5fc91a84-3a00-4a9f-84d5-91ffa5c53df4%3A87550f903284d6ae1c161ccd73861f57e6e94cbc), ish) ($20). Upon further investigation, I think they‚Äôre missing some ties, but they work. Our total comes to **$68.48**.

**12 pm:** F yells HEY when we walk in the door ‚Äî new skill! We show off our wares and eat some lunch (ramen and fruit for the kids and L, a weird fridge salad for me), and then pack up for our big activity ‚Äì a hike to a baby-friendly swimming hole! I earlier told my best friend, Z, that we‚Äôd be leaving around 11 am. We don‚Äôt leave til 2 pm. This is typical!

**5:30 pm:** We‚Äôre back in the car post-swim, post-hike. F fell asleep in the backpack as we hiked through an azalea grove and B was thrilled to show us tadpoles in the creek. All in all, a success. On the way home, my sister, J, texts and offers to walk our sweet dog for us with her best friend, who‚Äôs also in town for the weekend; and my best friend, Z (I‚Äôm losing track of all the letters here, team) promises she is leaving the town over very soon to come our way. This is great news, because B has asked no less than 10 times whether she‚Äôs arrived yet.

We see my sister and her bestie just briefly since they have dinner plans of their own, then eat leftover pasta for dinner. After we clean up, my phone indicates that Z is just 20 minutes away, so we let the kids wait up for her. B is dressed in full clown costume, bare feet, and his good friend ‚Äì our neighbor ‚Äì happens to walk by with his dad on their evening walk. B dashes out the gate to walk with them.¬†

And Z arrives in typical fashion ‚Äì loaded with TREATS! Spicy water, delicious bread, Nutella but somehow local, cheeses aplenty, and a perfume sample for B which THRILLS him.

Together we walk to gather B, then L and I put the kids to sleep. We hang out for a bit with Z before my sister‚Äôs husband, H, arrives for a brief hang. He‚Äôs headed out of town tomorrow and wanted to catch Z beforehand. Bedtime for L and I is around 10:30.

**üåø DAILY TOTAL: $88.66**

# ‚ú® DAY 6: SATURDAY‚ú®

**5:45 am:** I wake up to an immaculate kitchen and living room. It looks like Z cleaned in detail after we went to sleep. I am indescribably lucky.

Another reason I‚Äôm lucky: It‚Äôs party day! There‚Äôs lots to do: clean off the front porch for sign making, gather instruments, purchase popsicles, prepare charcuterie, charge the speaker, prep some signs for the parade, buy ice aplenty, set up kir royale station, clean up B‚Äôs play basement to make it company-ready, etc etc and so on. I also have to repair the contraption pants, which it turns out are missing some critical ties.¬†

We get it all done with a lot of help! My grandparents arrive unannounced two hours prior to the party, which initially stresses me out but then my dear grandmother slices the pears for the cheese board. My mom paints B‚Äôs face and hair for the parade. My sister and bestie and my sister‚Äôs bestie do so many different helpful things I‚Äôve lost count. Somewhere in this mix L pops to out to buy a few last items, and a lot of ice. The total is **$12.18** at the grocery store, and **$13.32** at the ABC store.

**2:30:** I am somehow dressed and ready to apply my eyebrows which is a miracle. Reader: I have never been ready for my own party prior to its start. Not once in these 36 years. And that‚Äôs on community!

We party for the rest of the day, around the block and down a giant blow-up waterslide that my in-laws bring. We invite neighbors watching the parade to pop by for a drink, because this is the best way to counter the forward march of totalitarianism (Hannah Arendt [told us](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-political-consequences-of-loneliness-and-isolation-during-the-pandemic) so). The party wraps around 6, and our nephew ‚Äì one of B‚Äôs besties! ‚Äì stays the night to celebrate. Tomorrow, we‚Äôll drop him and B off with our in-laws so they can spend a couple nights together and have maximum fun in their above-ground pool.

The kids eat mac and cheese and broccoli for dinner, and we adults kind of piece it together ‚Äì except for Z who has a blind date with a friend of J‚Äôs tonight! We try to wait up for the report but they‚Äôre having too much fun and stay out til midnight.

**üåø DAILY TOTAL: $25.50**

‚ú® **DAY 6: SUNDAY**‚ú®

This journal just does not make it to the top of my list today. A summary: Z buys pastries for breakfast and tells us the tale of the date (it went well, but they‚Äôre not sure if there was enough chemistry). B and his cousin play with toys all day and are generally cute. L takes them to meet his in-laws around 3. F and I play at home, which means, mostly, she drags me around the house and gardens by my finger.

At 6:45, we head out to pick up some stuff for veggie burgers and come back home to cook it up. **$13.10.**¬†

In bed, I bid too low on several Nooworks Magic Suits listed on Poshmark. As a result my offers are rejected :(¬†

**üåø DAILY TOTAL: $13.10**

‚ú® **DAY 7: MONDAY**‚ú®

**6:00 am:** Wake up and read the latest on our attacks on Iran and Israeli aggression broadly, and then watch a couple of videos of civilians confronting ICE here in the US. I open Substack to a meme that says something like, ‚ÄúIf you want to know the worst the world is capable of, read the news. If you want to know the best, go outside.‚Äù That‚Äôs kind of a wild sentiment these days, I think, since folks across the world don‚Äôt get to ‚Äúexperience nature‚Äù because they‚Äôre living through the worst the world is capable of -- in Gaza, Iran, and Israel today, and in mixed-status communities across the US, for example. But the meme does serve the function of getting me to put my phone down.

**8:15 am:** While doing my weekly planning, I receive a reminder to pay our $867 six-month premium on our car insurance and rage apply for a new carrier (Progressive). Do a few googles to double-check I‚Äôm not doing something rash and end up confirming online. Looks like this‚Äôll save L & I at least $200 a year! Huzzah. I text L the password to our new portal and forward him all the docs via email.

**9:00 am:** I head out on a run and it is glorious this morning. I take my favorite route past several anarchic gardens and down a big hill with a mountain view. On the way back I stop at my favorite tiny grocery store to buy some fancy items for the dinner party we‚Äôre attending later tonight at J‚Äôs, and I don‚Äôt hold back. Vegan sopressata, local spicy pickled carrots, two giant chocolate bars, some veggie sausage and a big coconut water for the walk home comes to **$47.38**, which is why we normally shop at Aldi.

On my walk home I listen to [Mahmoud Kahlil interviewed on NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/06/23/nx-s1-5441691/mahmoud-khalil-interview), and am so moved by his courage and clarity, and how he is using his case as an opportunity to bring attention to the plight of families impacted by imperial aggression here in the US, in Gaza, and beyond. I start my work day feeling a heavy gratitude that I, and my children, are safe.

**10:00 am:** I hop on a call in my workout clothes, which L deems ‚Äúvery Alpha‚Äù of me. I‚Äôll take it. After the first call, I take a shower and work til 5 pm, with a short break midday to hug F and make mango smoothies for L and I. Z is still here and I‚Äôm sad that I‚Äôm too back-to-back to cowork with them; maybe tomorrow!¬†

Midday, our CEO calls me in to her virtual office to reveal that another senior leader at the org will not be returning to work. The :::grimace emoji::: continues apace over here, and I suppose I‚Äôm along for the ride. I‚Äôm trying hard to be a value-add amidst all the confusion. Really, really glad that I have a (new) leadership coach external to the org and will be meeting with her this week.¬†

**6:00 pm:** Our dear babysitter arrives to take over with F while we go out! She was our nanny during the school year. We love her and wish we were endlessly wealthy and could employ her forever. But now that L is home with the kids, she just babysits occasionally. Tonight she‚Äôll feed F mac and cheese and peas and play until bedtime. We‚Äôll be out til 10:30, which brings the total for her time to **$95.**

**10:30 pm:** Home from J‚Äôs! It was a hoot and a holler with a delicious and robust collaborative charcuterie situation. I had a long discussion with one of my dear friends about getting matching ‚Äúpoetry‚Äù tattoos on our butts, and then recited some Edna St Vincent Millay. I kind of thought I was done with tattoos, though. What do you all think? Is getting a ‚Äúpoetry‚Äù butt tatt at 36 a MILFy move that I should take post-haste?

At bedtime, I check my phone and find that I did, in fact, win a Nooworks Magic Suit on Poshmark! My bid was $60, and you know there‚Äôs all kinds of extra dollars tacked on when you buy on Poshmark (shipping, etc) ‚Äì so it comes to **$73.05.**¬†

I also find that I have a random Amaz\*n charge for **$7.48.** For years I paid my dad‚Äôs different channel subscriptions through the app, and I‚Äôm still cleaning them up 9 months after his death. I go cancel the PBS subscription no one was using. Sorry, PBS. :(

‚ù§Ô∏è **Section 6: REFLECTION**

We had some extra spending this week for the party, but nothing spectacular. I‚Äôm really proud that we pulled it together for under $200 all-told! Overall, this is much less than we have spent over the last few months. In fact, my spending app says our spending is down 17% compared to May. 

Here are my tips for reining in lifestyle creep so that your partner can stay home with the kids: recall that your spending currently supports the Trump administration; be scared that you will lose your job shortly due to the Trump administration; remember that your money today is your kids‚Äô money tomorrow, as long as you don‚Äôt spend it. That last tip is really working for me, somehow, and I bet could be adapted for the DINKs out there.

Blessings on you all and thanks for reading!

1ljai0j,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucksbaristas/comments/1ljai0j/new_pricing/,new pricing,"From what I can tell, starbucks is no longer double charging for sauce and syrup - but is now charging for flavored syrups in iced coffee, cold brew. Classic is free. 

so with my regional pricing as an example a venti pep mocha was $7.22 and now is like $6.42, and a venti cold brew with vanilla and cream was $5.62 and is now like $6.42.

So if your iced coffee regulars get annoyed, you can recommend classic to keep the price the same.  

extra add-in scoops are charged per scoop as well? 

Starbucks could win SO many points with people if they lowered the price of iced coffee/cold brew by $.80, so flavored iced coffee drinkers could keep their price and basic iced coffee drinkers could actually get a discount. Like, whatever, charge for flavored syrups. But it‚Äôs one of our cheapest, easiest, fastest drinks to make, definitely not worth $6.50+. ",4,1750770060.0,starbucksbaristas,3,1.0,False

Bambino owners, what‚Äôs your preferred workflow for steaming microfoam and pulling a decent shot? 

We have an office machine that I‚Äôm just starting to use. I find that if I steam for a latte, then pull a shot within 10 seconds or so, I get over temp water, kind of like on an HX machine (must be the heater coil/loop design causing this?).

1ljafcf,https://www.reddit.com/r/theisle/comments/1ljafcf/5_things_i_think_the_isle_devs_needs_to_deal_with/,5 things i think the isle devs needs to deal with,"I remember i was in the dc once and i suggested the devs use their time to work on fixes apposed to changing things or developing things that lets be real are probably never coming into the game, i got that instamute from superlunary (of course) 

since ive been seeing so many issues i thought i would suggest 5 things the devs could actually work on to make the game better

  
1) AI - im not even sorry to say this, ai has been so inconsistent since the switch to the new map. To the point i really feel like im playing ""spawn in and starve to death"" simulator. I see the devs mad that there are ""hotspots"" but what do you expect when you have a map almost double the size only 100 players and there is no reliable AI system so yeah if you want to eat and live you have to go where people are. 

  
2) Humans - at this point developing humans seems like the biggest waste of time going. Its been what 10 years? and there is no ETA or even hint at when they will come to be playable but every month we get to see they rigged 3 different office chairs, some coffee cups and a few rooms we have no use for. When there are so many issues with the current game spending development resources on something thats probably only playable on their private dev servers seems like such a waste of time

3) map changes - im sorry but when there are so many issues and some that are so long standing i think there are better things to be working on than redoing large chunks of the map

  
4) bugs that have been in the game for 4+ years - this one makes me the most angry and its actually the one i was muted for. Im so sick of spending 5+ hours growing a dino, playing how they want me to play by following migration zones not afking in a bush you know how your ""supposed"" to play for it all to be lost on my next log in because i was spawned in and just died or better yet the server dino logged was just wiped with no way to get your progress back..... this has been happening since the old map so the fact its still a bug is INSANE especially in a game that you take hours and hour to grow your playable especially with new playables coming that take even longer to grow

5) server size - unfortunately the map is to big, and 100 people is not enough to have a fun experience most time i just log in run around until i find someone thats starved to death eat them and log out before i come to the same fate if unofficials can host 340 people at once and have it run smoothly i dont think there is a real reason to have officials capped at 100 its simply not enough people.

  
i want to end this and say i love this game so much, it is by far one of my fav games and its sad to see the downfall not be because the games awful but because the devs are. seeing them in DC say they dont care about our opinion and its ""their"" game when lets be real with out us it would just be dondi and his yes men on some private server living their dino dreams out together is kinda sad.

  
what are some things you could add to this list? what do you think that they could work on fixing to make this game better?

The two are close enough that she can simply enter.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre going to mow,‚Äù she said, stepping into the living room of his new home. Fristoe‚Äôs dog, Opie, stopped yapping as Vaughn lifted him into the crook of her arm. The dog‚Äôs tail continued to wag.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean going to mow?‚Äù Fristoe asked, his tone slightly defensive. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt been out mowing yet.‚Äù A weed whacker lay next to the front door.

‚ÄúI know, I know, but I want it to be mowed before we‚Äôre on TV,‚Äù Vaughn pressed.

The two friends had 30 minutes to prepare before the arrival of a Columbia broadcast reporter, who would tape the third installment of Fristoe‚Äôs homeownership saga ‚Äî a community effort in which Vaughn has served as a linchpin.

In early June, Fristoe closed on a $120,000, two-bedroom, brick house across from Hickman High School‚Äôs football field.

With the help of 280 neighbors, friends, strangers and anonymous donors, Fristoe and Vaughn raised just over $22,000 for the down payment that would make Fristoe, a retired Navy veteran on a fixed income, a first-time homeowner at 72.

The median age of a first-time home buyer in the United States is 38, according to 2024 data from the National Association of Realtors. First-time homeowners accounted for just 24% of home purchases last year, the lowest in more than four decades.

‚ÄúIt was hard,‚Äù Fristoe said of the homeownership process. ‚ÄúVery frustrating at times.‚Äù

The journey began in November, when Fristoe found out he had to vacate the modest two-bedroom he rented in Columbia‚Äôs tight-knit West Ash neighborhood.

During his five-year tenure renting in the neighborhood, he grew close to the community. Fristoe walked everywhere. He volunteered to mow the lawn at the preschool next to his house

When his landlord announced plans to renovate and raise the rent, Vaughn and Fristoe undertook a process of making Fristoe a homeowner.

On Nov. 6, Vaughn created a GoFundMe, soliciting $250 so Fristoe could qualify for a credit card to build better credit. Within about 20 days, donations swelled to more than $2,600.

The fund ballooned over Thanksgiving weekend, topping $20,000 after the Missourian and KOMU 8 ran stories about GoFundMe‚Äôs initial success.

Raising enough for a down payment was just the first step. Fristoe took home ownership classes at the nonprofit Love Columbia and secured a loan from Veterans United Home Loans.

Loan officers at Veterans United shepherded the pair through the process, Vaughn said. ‚ÄúIt was a lot of uploading documents through the VU portal,‚Äù she said, laughing.

Vaughn has kept the West Ash community updated via the neighborhood‚Äôs Facebook page.

Fristoe hesitated when he initially saw the fixer-upper that would become his home.

The first thing he noticed about it was the smell of mildew. ‚ÄúI got over that real quick,‚Äù he said, because he noticed the stained and scratched hardwood floors.

Fristoe faces a formidable list of home improvement projects: painting, sealing cracks in bricks, replacing rotting wooden beams and much more. He is endeavoring to tackle the projects do-it-yourself style ‚Äî with help from friends.

‚ÄúI hate to call it, but it‚Äôs a money trap,‚Äù he said of the home, holding up a wooden floorboard that broke off. ‚ÄúSo, it‚Äôs on Doug.‚Äù

Buying supplies from Habitat for Humanity ReStore, which sells used construction material, reduced costs. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to save a dollar here, a dollar there,‚Äù Fristoe said.

Three bulging discs in his back slowed progress on one of his first projects: hand-sanding the hardwood floors. In the end, he decided to cover the floors with rugs.

Evidence of his DIY projects litters his new living room. Sandpaper sits on top of a gallon of polyurethane on the coffee table next to a caulking gun. Beside the coffee table is a vacuum cleaner filled with sawdust.

Hints of Fristoe‚Äôs charm have also emerged in the month and a half since he moved in.

Overgrown weeds cover the unenclosed yard on one side of his home, much to Vaughn‚Äôs chagrin. Along the back, though, barely noticeable from the sidewalk, Fristoe planted mint, oregano, basil and tomato. He told his new neighbors they can take as much as they want.

He even plans to plant flowers along the backside of his fence, facing the low-rise apartment complex behind his house.

‚ÄúI have always felt that you got to give to get, and God has given me this opportunity,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúGod and the people that donated ‚Ä¶ I thank them for everything they‚Äôve done.‚Äù",9,1750769853.0,columbiamo,1,0.85,False

This is a competitive space, with thousands of applicants daily, so standing out is essential. Read all instructions carefully, be original, and avoid using external tools or AI assistance. These types of sites work with big tech companies that give projects, they can detect this easily. Your answers should be creative yet clear, with proper grammar, punctuation, and structure. Keep your responses concise and to the point. Rambling or adding filler content may confuse the AI and lower your score.

Although the assessments typically don‚Äôt have strict time limits, completing them in one focused sitting is best. Taking too long or pausing mid-way for a break (like making coffee) could be interpreted as a lack of commitment or preparation. Then again, with the number of applicants they get, I wouldn't blame them for getting rid of the slow workers. That said, don‚Äôt rush! Balance quality with reasonable pacing. If you're unsure about a response, take the time to double-check your work. These platforms prioritize quality input to ensure the AI models learn from accurate, well-written content.

Only apply for roles that match your skills. Many people lose access after being accepted because they struggle with project-specific requirements or receive too much bad feedback (R&Rs). Choose projects you're confident in and comfortable with. If a task seems too difficult or unclear, it's better to skip it than risk poor performance. The platforms even recommend taking breaks when tired, as high-quality work matters more than volume.

Also, follow the rules. Don‚Äôt use VPNs, fake identities, or create multiple accounts to game the system. These platforms work with major tech companies and have strict verification processes, including ID checks. If your country isn‚Äôt supported yet, don‚Äôt try to bypass restrictions. Instead, sign up and wait. They‚Äôll notify you if and when your region becomes eligible.

Finally, be patient. Even after passing the assessment and updating your profile, it might take weeks or even months to be assigned your first project. Many users report long waiting periods, so don‚Äôt be discouraged if you don‚Äôt get immediate work. Stay ready, and keep checking your dashboard for opportunities.

Now I‚Äôm documenting the journey: the wins, the losses, and everything in between.

I‚Äôve also set up a Discord community ‚Äî¬†**WFH Earners Club**¬†‚Äî for anyone who wants to get into remote work, learn how to qualify for projects, share progress, and stay motivated. Whether you're new to this or turning side gigs into full-time income, it's a space to connect, co-work, and grow together.

‚ÄúOf course, son. Perfectly fine,‚Äù Dad said.¬†

‚ÄúHas he changed since he came back from seeing his uncle?‚Äù I asked.¬†

‚ÄúNope, not one bit.‚Äù¬†

This was odd. A normal person would say, ‚ÄòWhy do you say this?‚Äô and ‚ÄòWhat makes you think this?‚Äô.

But my dad was just saying, rather flatly, no.¬†

‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt noticed anything?‚Äù I asked.¬†

‚ÄúNo son, I haven‚Äôt.‚Äù¬†

I had no more to say. It wasn‚Äôt just Charlie, now was it?

I was trying to talk myself out of my accusations against Charlie, but meanwhile, everybody was acting strange. My mum was compulsively hoovering the same spot of carpet, on repeat for an hour.¬†

I went to speak to her.¬†

‚ÄúMum, don‚Äôt you think that is hoovered enough?‚Äù I asked.¬†

‚ÄúWhy, dear, it can never be hoovered enough,‚Äù she replied.¬†

¬†‚ÄúDo you think Charlie or even Dad are both cting a bit odd?‚Äù I asked.¬†

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù she said promptly.¬†

I left the room and left my mum to her compulsive hoovering.¬†

I went back to my dad, again, compulsively affixing and detaching pieces of LEGO.¬†

‚ÄúDad, don‚Äôt you two have work today?‚Äù I asked.¬†

‚ÄúSick day for us both,‚Äù he said.¬†

I packed my bag and left for school. I couldn‚Äôt stay in that house. Maybe school was a refuge? Maybe a place of normality?¬†

I was trying to talk myself out of Charlie being *off.* Only to talk myself into realising that my parents were acting pretty fucking strange themselves.¬†

*Now, my parents are odd anyway. But this was extra odd. Not ‚Äúparents are weird‚Äù odd, but extra-terrestrial (God, I hate that word).*

And if it came down to Charlie converting people.¬†

Shifting and changing them, burying himself within. Then why not me?¬†

Why was I still Raymond? Why had I not been changed?¬†

Maybe I had changed and didn‚Äôt even know that I had changed?¬†

What was I now? Still a boy, I felt normal, I spoke normal, and I acted normal‚Ä¶¬†

School was strange. The hallways were bare. I wandered through in a daze, and there were as many people ambling about. I went to the main stage next to the reception. Maybe there was an assembly that I missed.¬†

Lo and behold, there was. The doors were locked and I couldn‚Äôt enter. But I could peer through the glass. I saw Charlie on the stage, speaking to a rapt audience of about 95% of the school. They were gazing up at him, it was as if he were a cult leader. I could see Mr McCarthy as one of the attendees.¬†

I looked deep into that audience and saw every member with their mouths wide open. Toni was there, Rory was there (arm in a sling), Mr McCarthy, the Deputy Head, Mr Brumwin, the Head of Science, Mr Griffin and the school priest, Father Duncan.¬†

Surely if this were a cult, then Father Duncan couldn‚Äôt attend?¬†

I started to hear a strange language coming from Charlie. It wasn‚Äôt human. It was a despicable gurgling sound that reverberated through the halls and vibrated the glass that I was looking through.¬†

Then another student clocked me, got up, walked to the pane of glass and closed the curtain in my face.¬†

With the school nearly empty, I went back to my home, went into my bedroom and closed the door, locked it, jumped into bed and threw the covers over my head.¬†

My final thoughts before a long sleep were - **WHY NOT ME?**¬†

**Day Five**¬†

Officially bat-shit crazy things going on.¬†

I slept through the day and into the night and awoke in the morning.¬†

My parents made me an English fry-up and I wolfed it down with some gusto. I was starving.¬†

Then Charlie and I walked to school.¬†

I decided it was time to speak to him (mano y mano), as we walked through the glistening sun shining down onto the trees, the tops of the houses and the pavement.¬†

‚ÄúDid something happen to you in Germany?‚Äù I asked.¬†

‚ÄúNo, why?‚Äù Charlie asked.¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve come back, and you‚Äôre strange, everything is strange, and everyone is strange. Did you even go to Germany?‚Äù I asked.¬†

‚ÄúI saw my uncle.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúBut what happened? You travelled the country alone. You‚Äôve come back and you‚Äôre not yourself, neither are my parents, and neither is the school.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs in your head, Raymond.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt gaslight me. Don‚Äôt do that,‚Äù I shout.¬†

‚ÄòLook around you, everything is beautiful,‚Äù Charlie said.¬†

‚ÄúYou know, I looked at your passport, and nobody stamped it. Did you go to Germany?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI was chosen.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúFor what?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYou will see.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWhat have you done to my parents?‚Äù I asked.¬†

‚ÄúThey seemed fine, did you not eat the breakfast that they made you just ten minutes ago?‚Äù Charlie asked.¬†

‚ÄúNo, something strange is going on, and I cannot describe it.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúRaymond, if you carry on like this, you‚Äôre liable to get committed.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWhat does that mean?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre acting like a lunatic.‚Äù¬†

School went ahead as normal. No mention of the ad-hoc assembly/ceremony yesterday. We walked through the hallways anonymously, like before, like always.¬†

We attended our classes. Ate our lunch. Even played football for a bit. And it seemed like things were normal.¬†

But everybody was off, and the conversations were formal and robotic. There was no emotion throughout the entire school.¬†

People walked like zombies. Nearly everyone. I‚Äôd hear the odd F-word or C-bomb, and I‚Äôd know that not *everyone* was affected. But the majority.¬†

We went home, we had dinner, and we watched The Simpsons until bedtime. Right up until Charlie turned to me and said:¬†

‚ÄúRaymond, can you leave the room so that I may speak to your parents alone?‚Äù¬†

I didn‚Äôt argue, I just left.¬†

And I went to my hiding place - under the covers.¬†

**Day Six**¬†

That night, I was awoken by the door opening and being slammed shut.¬†

I ran downstairs. There was a trail of mucus on the carpet, leading to the front door and flowing down to the outside.¬†

The mucus had a life of its own. It moved like a snake, and within the damp, dark liquid, there seemed to be an exoskeleton. It was vile. I coughed up vomit at the sight of it.¬†

I ran outside and followed the trail, glistening in the moonlight. I could see Charlie ahead, but his skin was peeling and falling off. It was like a reptilian shedding. What lay underneath, I don‚Äôt have words to describe. But it was translucently blue and glossy.¬†

Like a laminated skeleton.¬†

My parents walked on either side of Charlie, and then, as he stood in the middle of the town square - a good ten minutes run from my house - I saw the entire town almost form a circle around him. Around Charlie or whatever Charlie had morphed into.¬†

They were all humming. The town was still human, but Charlie stood alone as some fucked-up entity.¬†

I ran to the outside of the huddle, and I barged my way into the middle.¬†

‚ÄúCharlie‚Äù looked down at me with these beady octopus eyes that were emanating a blinding light.¬†

I screamed:¬†

‚ÄúWhat the fuck is this?‚Äù¬†

Nobody even acknowledged me. The town was in a trance, and Charlie was the main focal point, right in the middle.¬†

The lights shone from his eyes and beamed up into the sky.¬†

He laughed, a bellicose laugh. And then‚Ä¶ he walked towards me.¬†

‚ÄúRaymond,‚Äù he gurgled.¬†

He couldn‚Äôt speak. Whatever he was didn‚Äôt have the tongue and vocal range to formulate words. Instead, he gargled and gurgled my name.¬†

He put his arms out. But they weren‚Äôt arms? They were something else.¬†

Not tentacles. I know that is the obvious allusion.¬†

But to describe these clawing objects with their blinding light as arms, tentacles, or appendages is just *wrong.*¬†

Whatever Charlie was *in that moment* was something that human words can‚Äôt do justice to.¬†

He slipped towards me. The mucus was still trailing off his body.¬†

Charlie had grown twenty, thirty, forty and then a hundred feet tall. Then it came to a point where it was like looking up at Big Ben.¬†

Charlie‚Äôs alien body took over the whole skyline above me.¬†

Gargantuan.¬†

He put his arms out to embrace me.¬†

I submitted.¬†

*The light was blinding. The light was blinding.*

*The darkness engulfed me.*¬†

I felt like Ahab in the belly of Moby Dick.¬†

*Nothingness.*¬†

**Day Seven**¬†

How long was I asleep? I turned to look at Alexa - a full day had passed.¬†

Charlie was at the foot of my bed when I awoke. He was smiling. He passed me a fresh cup of coffee, and I took a sip.¬†

His skin was back to normal, his voice was, and no shooting lights were emanating from his throat.¬†

‚ÄúPretty freaky dreams, huh?‚Äù Charlie asked.¬†

‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt a dream,‚Äù I said.¬†

‚ÄúI know.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúSo, what is this?‚Äù I asked.¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs for the best.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWhat are you? And where is Charlie?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúCharlie‚Äôs gone.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúAnd you?‚Äù I asked.¬†

I began to cry for Charlie. I missed him. And now, it was confirmed that Charlie was gone.¬†

‚ÄúI have taken the essence of Charlie,‚Äù he said, smiling.¬†

‚ÄúWhy am I not one of your zombies?‚Äù I asked.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôve tried. You‚Äôre too strong. Think of it being like a virus. And you have immunity. Maybe because you‚Äôre smarter than most people I know. Maybe your strength of character. I don‚Äôt know. But you don‚Äôt have it. But that‚Äôs ok. I still want you to join me. I care for you, Raymond.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWhat if I don‚Äôt want to?‚Äù I asked.¬†

‚ÄúDrink your coffee,‚Äù he said.¬†

I took another sip. It was just normal coffee, no voodoo.¬†

‚ÄúWhatever happens. This is for the best,‚Äù Fake Charlie said.¬†

‚ÄúDid this happen to you in Germany?‚Äù I asked.¬†

‚ÄúAs you probably realise, where I went was many, many miles away from Germany,‚Äù he said.¬†

‚ÄúAnd what is the end game?‚Äù I asked.¬†

‚ÄúWhatever it is - it‚Äôs for the best. You could be the last one, you‚Äôre the first one I‚Äôve met with immunity. You could be a beacon of hope for this planet. And we can do this together,‚Äù he said.¬†

I was stumbling for the right words. I didn‚Äôt know whether to fight or flee.¬†

‚ÄúThis is for the best,‚Äù Charlie said.¬†

‚ÄúBut why you? What makes you, or should I say ‚ÄúCharlie,‚Äù the chosen one?‚Äù I asked.¬†

‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt just me. We are having these outbreaks daily at this rate. Why Mohammed? Why Jesus? Why anyone? Nobody asked for greatness. Did they?‚Äù¬†

He grabbed my hand and squeezed it hard.¬†

I tried to smile back at him.¬†

‚ÄúRemember what you told me when my mother left me and you first adopted me,‚Äù Charlie said.¬†

‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre not Charlie?‚Äù I asked.¬†

‚ÄúAnd yet, the memories remain within me. What you said was that everything happens for a reason, even the worst news can be good news.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúPretty deep for a ten-year-old, I think my father said it first.‚Äù¬†

I looked in the doorway, and my ‚Äúparents‚Äù stood watching us, big smiles on their faces.¬†

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre proud of you, son,‚Äù Dad said.¬†

‚ÄúJoin us, and let us understand what makes you immune and so special. You‚Äôll get an even bigger slice of the pie than the rest of those zombies,‚Äù Charlie, but not Charlie said.¬†

**So, what do you think, Reddit? Should I join him?**¬†

1lja5y8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lja5y8,My Last Cigarette,"
I have been thinking for a long time about quitting it. So I guess today is the day. I still vaguely remember when I started it. It was in my hostel during my college days back in 2022. I was a bit drunk at that time still thinking why I started it honestly. I have come a long way, since then I have tried to stop it many times and then lapsed again. Over time it has sort of become a night routine for me. I have had thousands of cigarettes with my tea, coffee, cold drinks and alcohol. I have had it with my friends and alone when I was in a meloncaly. 

My mother has told me so many times to not smoke but I guess it didn't matter much to me. So you may ask why today. I don't know why, but today feels a good day to just leave. I am gonna have a haircut as well today. Something has changed but I can't put a finger on exactly what. 

I was talking to someone over an anonymous app, let's name her 'A'. She told me that I should stop it. I exactly remember the day, it was 16th june 2025 after 11pm. She said you know why pregnency rates are going down, it's because of men who involve themselves in such sedentary lifestyle and not just destroy their life but also the woman's and their upcoming child's lives as well. She also said if you think what you are doing is so good, then why not tell it to your parents. I actually have no answer to it, but I do think my parents know it. She is younger than me, but I way mature in thoughts, ""Jo Insaan khudse pyaar nhi kr skta, wo kisi aur se kabhi nhi kar payega"", ""agar sab kuch jaan ne ke baad bhi aap nhi sudhroge to aapka, aapse bada dushman koi nhi hai"". These lines stuck with me. I know I love myself more than my cigarette, I have to.

I don't have much money left in my bank account as well. Probably a few thousand rupees at max, and just enough money to make it through the next month. I am just broke at this point. I still try to be positive about the fact that I have food to eat but the dread of not having money is just killing me at this point. I just know that this is not what I want my life to be, but here we are. 

I think I was a good kid back then and honestly not much has changed now, it's just that being kind is not enough. I need to be competent to earn money. It has been more than 2 months now since I have a job. I ruined my last interview and there is nothing to look forward to. You might think why I am telling you this, the thing is I have been feeling judged by my family. They don't say it to my face but I know. Everyday when I talk to my mother, I just try to be positive as she is very possessive. I hate it most of the times honestly, I want to be sad. Like how can I pretend to be cheerful and positive when I know the reality is totally different. The only time I feel at ease is when I am having drag. 

The cigarette does not judge you, it just waits on your lips to be sucked in. I don't feel any hit as well, it's not as good as the first time as well. I don't know why, but I still feel at ease. Probably it's just that it is the only time when I am not thinking about anything else. But lately that feeling is going down as well. 

There was a time in my life when I used to listen to a lot of bollywood music, but with time the liking just vanished. Some of it can be blamed to the fact that bollywood is not making good music, but mostly it's just me, I don't connect it with anymore. I still remember there was a time, when before going to sleep I used to listen music on radio, this was long back around 2010-11. I used to pulg in my wired earphones on a nokia phone, one bus in my ear and the second in my father's. I don't know why I never liked that, probably because for me music is very intimate thing which I like to do it alone. 

I still do listen to music, but my prefrances have changed. I am more into hip hop now. Not as much into international, I prefer DHH. But lately that feeling is also fading. What I am trying to convey is that there is a time for things to come and go in your life, and there is no point in clinging to those things. Likings change with time and that's fine. But before leaving it completely I want to have it one last time, just for reminiscing. Just for that one last time, because I know there is no going back from this. 

If I remember correctly my first cigarette was Marlboro advanced. And my last Cigarette will be Marlboro Classic Regular. I think that with time your preference for cigarettes changes as well. Right now my favourite is the new Editions cigarette, I like it's flavour so very much, it's the best tasting cigarette that I had by a long margin. Then there is indie mint, for a long time I didn't try it as people told men don't smoke indie mint. But I like it, I think after advance it is my most smoked cigarette. 

I was also very interested in lighters. My first lighter was simple nothing special. It was transparent blue/violet which you can find in any nearby kirana shop. My second lighter was a gas lighter, utility wise they are the best, as the speed of wind does not affect the fire. It's hard to explain, but I never liked these gas lighters as they light the cigarette in one go. There is something about using match sticks or a normal lighter, it takes more effort it feels worth it. 

-------------------------------------------------;

I just had my last Cigarette with tea. It's 7.50am right now in Gurgaon. It just started to rain as well while I was smoking. It should mean something right, I want it to mean something. I listened two songs as well. One by Jagjit Singh, Tujhko dariya Dil ki Kasam and other by Talha Anjum, downers at dusk. Downers at dusk is my most streamed song in last two years since it came out in Feb 2023. I like that song very much. It has helped me so much during my tough times, and it makes so much sense to listen to it while I am smoking my last. I think it deserves this.

I was also thinking about how I smoked a cigarette. I like to hold it in my left hand, it looks much more aesthetic. My friend likes to hold it using his thumb and index finger, I think he learned this from peaky blinders. I hold it between my index and middle finger. 

It made me a bit emotional while I was throwing the bud and the lighter. I wanted to hold it for a bit longer, but it's time to let it go now. I feel at ease now. I can move on now. I gave my cigarette the best farewell, smoking it in the balcony while it's raining and my favourite song in my ears. I don't know what else I could have done. Probably enjoy it more, but I don't really feel anything right now. 

I smoked my first at night when I was high, and I smoked my last in broad day light in my full senses. In a way I started at night and I smoked till morning, and now it's time to move in. It is a new day and I have to do a lot more.",13,1750769135.0,TwentiesIndia,4,1.0,False

I'm a 34-year-old man who lives in a fairly liberal place in which sex before marriage is more of the norm, a place to which I traveled when I was 29.

I was born and raised in a pretty conservative environment in which pre-marriage intercourse wasn't something the average man could pull off, so I spent my teenage years and all my 20s as a sexless virgin who's only interested in gym, video games, and male fragrances (perfumes have always been a passion of mine)

My first kiss happened when I was 30, and I lost my virginity a year later. I've had quite a few sexual/romantic encounters since then, but erectile dysfunction has occurred in every single one of them, which is expected due to my performance anxiety (I have morning wood, and I don't have a problem getting hard outside of sex)

I don't think I am a super attractive man, but I've received many compliments regarding my looks and been approached by multiple women, and funnily enough, I'm very confident around women and can be very flirty with them without any kind of mental barrier, despite my lack of experience.

One of my sexual encounters was a one-night stand that turned into a friends-with-benefits type of situation, and even though that woman made it clear that she only wanted to have short-term fun, she kept coming back for my 5-inch ED-suffering friend lol, because she said I was amazing at foreplay. (I mentioned that situation for you to know where my frustration is coming from)

A month ago, I met a 39-year-old woman on Tinder. We went out on a date, and she seemed like an amazing person to hang out with and not just a Tinder date for short-term fun. She said she wanted to find something long-term and that she hated sex without any emotional attachment, and I was all for it.

We spent hours together kissing, laughing, and talking about politics and random stuff. She seemed to really like me, so much so that she would come pick me up in her car outside my house before every date (except the first one).

On our second date, when we first made out, she mentioned she was going to travel to another city for business in the near future and that she'd spend 20 days there.

A day before her trip, we talked and decided to meet up so we could see each other. The weather got really rainy that day, and even though I really wanted to see her, I could understand if that wasn't possible, due to the bad weather, but she insisted and told me she wouldn't leave before seeing me first.

She picked me up like usual, we drank coffee, and then she invited me to her house.

We had a couple of drinks and started making out. I tried to use what I'm allegedly good at (foreplay) to get her off, but after 10 minutes or so, she brought a condom and told me that she wanted me inside her.

Alchohol + rubber + performance anxiety = ED for damn sure.

I couldn't get it up, but I didn't get too embarrassed; instead, I started making jokes about it.

We had a smoke and asked her if she was willing to go for it again, but she said she wasn't in the mood anymore.

We sat for an hour and a half more, passionately kissing and cuddling, and when I was about to leave, she literally climbed up onto me and started sniffing my neck and kissing me for 5 minutes at the door.

Even though I wasn't pleased with my sexual performance, I left very happy because I had spent a great night with her.

I sent her a message the next day asking about her trip, but she left my message unread for 2 days. On the third day, I noticed that she'd read my message but didn't respond.

I was left confused because she'd never done that to me before, and I started questioning the reasons.

Now it's been 5 days without a response, I don't think I'll hear from her ever again, but what is shocking to me is that she didn't seem like a sexually-driven person at all, and I'm gonna be honest, even though she doesn't have a curvy body, I didn't care and found her really attractive because of who she was.

I don't know if I should talk to her again or if this is the end, but let me tell you this: getting ghosted by someone you like feels bad, but getting ghosted by someone you like for not being able to maintain a boner is the worst feeling ever.",0,1750769066.0,offmychest,1,0.5,False

But when someone didn‚Äôt just break your heart‚Äîwhen they manipulated, hurt, or betrayed you‚Äîwhat lingers is more than pain. It‚Äôs their imprint on your life, your home, your routines, and even your body.

I didn‚Äôt realize how much of my space was still tied to him until I started reclaiming it piece by piece.

Here are some places you might want to check‚Äîand what I did to take my power back:

‚∏ª

üß¥ Bathroom Products
His shampoo, body wash, beard oil‚Äîwhatever he left behind. Don‚Äôt let them sit there like shrines. Use them to clean toilets. Dump them out. Use them as bubble bath. If it was left behind, you get to decide how to use it. 

‚∏ª

‚òï The Coffee Pot He Insisted On
Maybe he had to have that French press or pour-over setup, and there was no room for what you actually wanted. Get rid of it. Buy yourself the coffee maker that fits your life, not his ego. Start your mornings on your terms again.

‚∏ª

üìÖ Schedules Built Around Him
You might still be waking up at his preferred time, cooking when he expected food, or organizing your day around his needs and wants. Rebuild your schedule. Sleep in, eat late, exercise and walk when you want to walk. Let your body breathe without catering to his clock.

‚∏ª

üíÑ Perfume or Clothing He Liked on You
If he picked the perfume, it wasn‚Äôt for you‚Äîit was for his pleasure. If he had a favorite dress or a specific kind of lingerie he bought you, that wasn‚Äôt love; that was control wrapped in a ribbon. You don‚Äôt owe those items a place in your drawer. Donate them. You are not a product to be packaged.

‚∏ª

üëó What You Were Wearing When You Were Betrayed
If you remember the outfit you had on when you were sexually assaulted, or when you received that ‚Äúhey girl‚Äù message from his mistress, you do not need to keep it. You don‚Äôt have to relive that trauma every time you see it in your closet. It‚Äôs okay to let it go. It‚Äôs okay to grieve it. It‚Äôs okay to never wear it again.

üíé Gifts That Were About Ownership, Not Love
Jewelry that was more about showing you off than cherishing you. Lingerie that was meant to make you more desirable for him, not help you feel confident in your skin. These gifts were not about love. They were props in his fantasy. You are not obligated to keep them as proof of anything.

‚∏ª

This isn‚Äôt about being petty. It‚Äôs about cleansing. It‚Äôs about taking back space in your life‚Äîphysical, emotional, spiritual‚Äîthat someone else invaded or claimed.

Getting rid of their things isn‚Äôt revenge. It‚Äôs relief.
It‚Äôs healing.
It‚Äôs yours literal and metaphorical space.

If anyone else is doing this too, I‚Äôd love to hear what you got rid of and how it made you feel. Let‚Äôs make space together.",1,1750768925.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1lja2wy,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1lja2wy/family_priming_you_up_to_be_a_drinker/,Family Priming You Up To Be A Drinker,"My folks weren't daily drunks or anything but they did enjoy social drinking with friends a couple times a month or so. They had a very laid back attitude when it came to alcohol and us kids though. (This was in the¬†late 70's/mid 80's) Mom would have a vodka and 7-Up sometimes on family game nights and would make me a weak drink if I asked. 

My dad's family had a lot of hard drinkers - his dad, uncles, cousins...Man, those men could knock back the drinks. My Papa - dad's dad - lived next door to us and, every morning starting around 6am, relatives and friends would gather around his¬†kitchen table for a few strong whisky and coffees before setting off to work. Evenings were a heavier repeat of everyone gathering for whisky and beer after work. I was always in and out and loved being around those old men because they always had such great tales to tell and never treated me like just some annoying little girl. I also started going on hunting and fishing trips with them from a very early age. I thought it was just the coolest thing, ever, to hang out and be included. Somewhere there exists a picture of me as a 7 year old with a teddy bear in one arm taking a swig of whisky from the bottle with the other. It was on a November deer hunt, bitterly cold, and they said the whisky would warm me up - and oh man, I'm sure it did.¬†

Fast forward to my teen years. If I was out with my mom and her friends at an event or luncheon, I was allowed to order whatever kind of adult drink I wanted. I was sipping Long Island Iced Teas and Colorado Bulldogs by age 13-14. I was also 14 the first time I drank enough to get alcohol poisoning after raiding Papa's booze cabinet while having a sleepover at his house while he was out of town. My folks didn't punish me; said the hangover should be punishment enough. Afterwards, I was still allowed to have a drink on game night or Dad would make me a gin and tonic or two along with his while we'd both sit by the woodstove reading books all evening. (Those were honestly my favorite drinking times. So sophisticated to sip a drink and read by the fire, isn't it?) 

If I had friends staying over and we wanted to drink, Mom would buy us some wine coolers, no problem. The reasoning was that they'd rather have me safe at home than out at keggers or bonfires, getting rides with drunk teenagers and getting hurt. They weren't entirely wrong because I did have a couple of friends that got in wrecks and got seriously hurt or killed. I just don't think they ever considered the damage that their laid-back approach was doing in the long run.¬†

By the time I was 18, I could get into bars without being carded. Oh boy. Fun times. Nothing safer than an 18 year old girl pounding shots in a bar of grown-ass adults! How I never got assaulted is beyond me. My years of hanging out with the rough drinking old men always challenging each other to drink more and/or bragging about their drinking escapades left me with an attitude of, ""Screw it, I'll man up and do another shot!"" Except, I wasn't an old man. I was a young woman weighing about 120lbs. I thought it was just sooooo cool that I could drink guys twice my size under the table. Yikes.¬†

I did dial my drinking back in my early 20's and managed to get through a decade or so without regularly drinking as I got married, had a couple of kids and pretended to be an adult. But, the times when I did drink? Yeah, it was all in or nothing. If I didn't end up puking, it was a miracle - and a rare one. 

After the kids were all grown and the years of tending to family duties, caring for sick/dying parents I felt like I deserved to relax, cut myself some slack and have a little fun. Aaaand....Boom. Within a couple of years, it became a regular thing for husband and I to down several shots every evening and more on weekends. That, ""I'll man up!"" voice in my head has never learned to just shut up so if I'm in for one shot, I'm in for a dozen or more. We both got tired of the damage to our health and bank account and quit.¬†

For some inexplicable reason, after more than a year of sobriety, I grabbed a bottle of tequila. I mean, I learned my lesson so it won't be a regular thing, right? \*Snort\* Two years later and here I am again. Back at square one and sick of my own nonsense. The empty bottle of tequila went in the garbage on June 1st and there won't be a replacement bottle purchased. It's just so aggravating to start over AGAIN.¬†

I don't blame my parents for my own bad choices as an adult but man, it's hard not to wonder how differently things would have gone for me if they had treated the early - hell, the¬†*childhood*¬†\- drinking as a more serious thing? What if someone had thought that hey, maybe cheering a little girl on for being a badass enough to swig whisky might not be the best thing for her?¬†

Anyways, sorry for the long ramble. I've been reading through this sub and doing some serious reflecting on my choices and so the history of the how and why of my drinking has been on my mind. At least I'm ready to 'man up!' and get sober again. This time for good.¬†",13,1750768908.0,stopdrinking,4,1.0,False

So we have a regular who gets a venti peppermint mocha and this morning it was like $6.42 instead of $7.22, and our regular who gets a venti cold brew with vanilla classic and cream paid like $6.42 instead of $5.62. 

So if you usually get a hazelnut iced coffee with cream, your cost will go up $.80. If you want to keep the price the same, switching to classic instead of hazelnut should do it.

I have never felt so invisible or treated with so much disrespect. I don‚Äôt like being referred to as an admin or having someone wish me happy admin professional day.

Hi folks,

Over the past five years, aTyr Pharma ($ATYR) has been navigating the treacherous waters of clinical development, steadily refining its strategic course towards what promises to be a monumental inflection point. We stand now, in June 2025, just three short months away from the eagerly anticipated topline readout of the EFZO-FIT Phase 3 study in pulmonary sarcoidosis. This isn't just another data point; it's the culmination of decades of foundational science and years of disciplined execution, poised to reshape the company‚Äôs trajectory and, potentially, revolutionise a therapeutic landscape starved of innovation.

The market is quiet, volumes have thinned, and the usual chatter has subsided. To most, this appears as a lull. But in my experience, these are precisely the moments where the *smart money* positions itself‚Äînot on headlines, but on structure, psychology, and the nuanced signals hidden within the company‚Äôs public record. It's in these quiet periods that the real work‚Äîthe deep, analytical thought‚Äîtakes place.

This is not just another analysis; it is one of the deepest dives I have undertaken, meticulously crafted to resonate deeply and provide an unparalleled read. My objective here was to go far beyond superficial insights, to draw out a strong, compelling story about aTyr Pharma, rooted solely in their official filings.

For those new to navigating these waters, a Form 10-K is an annual report required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that provides a comprehensive summary of a company's financial performance, operations, and risks. A Form 10-Q, on the other hand, is a similar, but less extensive, quarterly report. Together, these documents serve as a rich, time-series repository of a company's official narrative, revealing its evolution in a manner you wouldn't have seen before. For me, personally, undertaking this rigorous exercise in deep analytical thought has profoundly deepened my conviction in the company's trajectory and the strength of its underlying strategy.

I have performed a forensic, institutional-grade analysis of aTyr Pharma's journey from 2021 through Q1 2025. Through this analysis, I have unravelled the intricate development of aTyr's story‚Äîuncovering the time-series narrative of its strategic evolution, extracting hidden insights that often escape casual observation, and building robust hypotheses around the company's future trajectory. My ultimate goal is to bridge the information gap that institutional investors typically enjoy, providing our community with the context, clarity, and conviction needed to navigate this critical investment journey.

This is not mere reporting; it's an exercise in *reading the company's mind*‚Äîunderstanding what management is planning, fearing, downplaying, and preparing for, solely through the lens of their official disclosures.

Thousands of you are reading these posts‚Äîliterally thousands‚Äîand the engagement has been brilliant. I love doing this. But I need to work out a way to make it sustainable. Every post takes hours of research, deep analysis, and careful writing. It's a labour of love, but it adds up. So if you're reading this, just take a moment to remember there's someone behind the scenes doing the digging, stitching things together, and making it accessible. *If you're getting value out of it‚Äîif it's helping shape your understanding, your thesis, or even just your interest in biotech‚Äîplease consider dropping a few dollars through [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/biobingo). It really helps.* I want to build this bigger: more stocks, more deep dives, more data-rich insight. I‚Äôd love to eventually take some of you along for the ride‚Äîshare the actual process, the research layers, the method behind it all. But we‚Äôre not there yet. First, I need to show that this model can work. I don‚Äôt want to put any of this behind a paywall. I want it open. I want it available. But I also need to make it viable. If you can help‚Äîeven just a little‚Äîit genuinely makes a difference. *And to those who already have: thank you. I see you.*

Get ready for a truly deep and illuminating read. This is a long one, a multi-part read, but I think this is one you're really going to enjoy and get a great deal of value out of.

# I. Executive Summary: The Macro Narrative & Investment Thesis at a Glance

For aTyr Pharma ($ATYR), the narrative has transitioned from that of a promising, broad-platform discovery company to a laser-focused, late-clinical-stage entity on the precipice of a binary, multi-billion-dollar market inflection. This shift, meticulously tracked across five years of SEC filings, reveals a leadership team that has moved from cautious exploration to aggressive, conviction-driven execution.

At its core, aTyr has systematically narrowed its strategic aperture, pouring resources and focus into efzofitimod, its lead asset for pulmonary sarcoidosis. This decision, visible through the progressive de-emphasis of earlier pipeline assets and the explicit ramp-up of pre-commercialisation efforts, signals profound internal confidence in the upcoming EFZO-FIT Phase 3 readout in Q3 2025. Management‚Äôs actions‚Äîinvesting in a commercial infrastructure, ensuring a cash runway through the catalyst, and actively engaging with regulators‚Äîspeak louder than any single press release.

The current market valuation, with $ATYR trading at $4.97 and a market capitalisation of approximately $493 million, significantly underprices what I currently estimate to be a $3‚Äì$10 billion total addressable market for efzofitimod alone in seven major global markets by 2030, and what I currently think is potential peak global sales at $2.5 billion. This disconnect highlights the profound information asymmetry between current market perception and the underlying strategic preparedness.

**Key facets of this deep dive point to a unique investment setup:**

- **Unwavering Focus:** The time-series analysis reveals a deliberate strategic decision to concentrate resources on efzofitimod, a move indicative of high internal conviction.
- **Commercial Readiness:** The significant and growing investment in pre-commercialisation activities suggests management is planning for approval as their base case.
- **De-risked International Expansion:** The evolving Kyorin partnership has transformed into a robust operational engine for rapid commercialisation in Japan/APAC, providing a well-funded and established ex-US pathway.
- **Qualitative Clinical Signals:** The emergence of the Expanded Access Programme (EAP), driven by clinician feedback from the blinded study, provides a compelling, organic signal of perceived clinical benefit.
- **Structural Moat:** The extensive and strategically layered intellectual property (IP) estate, encompassing 385 patents, creates a wide moat around aTyr‚Äôs platform and offers significant latent value beyond efzofitimod.
- **Financially Positioned:** Proactive capital raises have secured a cash runway through the pivotal readout, mitigating near-term dilution risk and enabling a focused sprint to the catalyst.

This comprehensive forensic analysis, drawing directly from the granular details and time-series shifts within aTyr‚Äôs SEC filings, underscores that the company is not merely awaiting a binary outcome; it has meticulously engineered its operational and financial landscape to capitalise on a positive result. While the inherent risks of biotech remain, the converging signals suggest that the *smart money* is actively positioning for a potential re-rating that could dramatically shift the stock's valuation, making $ATYR a compelling catalyst play at its current entry point.

# III. The Evolving Corporate Narrative: A Time-Series Forensic Review

This section delves into the intricate evolution of aTyr Pharma's corporate narrative, meticulously tracing the strategic shifts, linguistic nuances, and underlying intentions revealed across its 10-K and 10-Q filings from 2021 through Q1 2025. This time-series forensic approach uncovers how the company's story has progressively shaped itself from a multi-faceted biotech to a laser-focused commercial entity, poised for a major inflection.

---

## A. Business Overview: The Dynamic Evolution of Corporate Identity and Strategy

The ""Business Overview"" section in the 10-K filings serves as the company's foundational self-definition, and its evolution provides a powerful time-series narrative of strategic intent. It's here that aTyr subtly, then overtly, communicated its progressive commitment to a singular asset.

**2021: The Broad, Foundational Story ‚Äì Initial Hedging and Platform Emphasis**

In 2021, aTyr Pharma presented itself with a broad mandate, defining itself as a ""biotherapeutics company engaged in the discovery and development of innovative medicines based on novel biological pathways,"" explicitly rooted in ""more than a decade of foundational science on extracellular tRNA synthetase biology."" The narrative emphasised diversification, *leveraging platform*, and broad academic partnerships. The inclusion of multiple pipeline assets‚Äîefzofitimod as the lead, but also significant column inches dedicated to ATYR2810 (an oncology antibody) and new discovery programmes (AARS, DARS)‚Äîunderscored a hedging strategy, typical of early-stage discovery firms seeking to validate a broad technological approach. The explicit mention of COVID-19 impacts further highlights the external pressures shaping early operations, affecting clinical trials and supply chains. The prevailing tone was one of exploration and cautious optimism, typical of a company still defining its optimal path.

**2022: The First Strategic Filter ‚Äì Prioritisation and the Initial Cull**

A critical and subtle shift began to emerge in the 2022 filing, marking the first clear inflection point in the time-series narrative. While still broadly framing itself as a ""biotherapeutics company... from our proprietary tRNA synthetase platform,"" the language pivoted decisively to identify efzofitimod as the ""primary focus."" This wasn't a casual remark; it was backed by a definitive, internal strategic decision in Q3 2022 to ""pursue alternative avenues"" for ATYR2810. This marked the clear culling of a non-core asset from internal development, signalling the growing belief in efzofitimod's primary potential. The initiation of the pivotal Phase 3 EFZO-FIT study publicly cemented this prioritisation. The introduction of broader geopolitical risks, such as the Ukraine-Russia conflict and other macroeconomic conditions, reflected increasing awareness of external factors impacting even specific clinical development, moving beyond just COVID-19. This year‚Äôs narrative indicates a tightening of focus, hinting at increasing conviction but still framed with ""potential"" language.

**2023: Crystallisation of Focus and the Implicit Commercial Glimmer**

The strategic shift solidified further in 2023. The company now described itself as a ""clinical stage biotechnology company leveraging evolutionary intelligence to translate tRNA synthetase biology into new therapies for fibrosis and inflammation."" While the overarching platform was still mentioned, the overwhelming emphasis was on efzofitimod's clinical readiness. The consistent updates on EFZO-FIT enrolment progress, alongside the launch of the EFZO-CONNECT study in SSc-ILD, showed a tangible commitment to advancing the primary asset. More subtly, the financial sections began to carry the weight of nascent commercial ambition. The statement that R&D expenses are tied to ""possible commercialisation of efzofitimod"" marked a crucial transitional phase in the narrative‚Äîmoving from purely clinical development costs to implicitly funding future market entry. This suggests that internal scenario planning for a successful outcome had already begun. The DSMB (Data Safety Monitoring Board) review concluding that the EFZO-FIT study could ""continue unmodified"" was a quiet but powerful endorsement of the trial's integrity and safety, likely fuelling internal confidence and providing a foundation for future, more explicit commercial messaging. The tone becomes more confident, less exploratory, with initial hints of future market aspirations.

**2024: The Overt Commercial Transformation ‚Äì ""When, Not If.""**

The 2024 10-K represents a significant and unmistakable leap in the time-series narrative. The company explicitly stated its intent to ""Transition from a clinical stage biotech to a commercial pharmaceutical company."" This was no longer an implicit hope or a distant possibility; it was the stated corporate goal. The bold declaration of ""begun pre-commercialisation efforts in the U.S. market and intend to expand these efforts with positive topline data,"" focusing on ""marketing, commercial operations and commercial supply,"" serves as tangible evidence of this pivot. These are concrete, irreversible investments that fundamentally underscore a high level of internal conviction. The completion of EFZO-FIT enrolment in July 2024, with topline data anticipated in Q3 2025, made the commercial transition a near-term, unavoidable reality. The ""future optionality"" of preclinical assets (ATYR0101/0750) was clearly relegated to a secondary, longer-term bucket, highlighting the laser-focus on efzofitimod. This year‚Äôs filing embodies the ""acting like they know"" philosophy, with a decisive and proactive tone geared towards market entry.

**2025 (Q1): The ""All-In"" Catalyst Moment ‚Äì The Culmination of Strategic Evolution**

The latest 10-Q (Q1 2025) serves as the culmination of this five-year narrative, solidifying the all-in posture just months ahead of the pivotal readout. It reinforces the explicit commercial pivot, highlighting ongoing ""pre-commercialisation efforts"" as a continuous, active endeavour. The subtle shift in spending patterns‚ÄîR&D expenses potentially stabilising or slightly decreasing as the pivotal trial winds down, while G&A (General and Administrative) costs inch up (driven by commercial hires and infrastructure)‚Äîprovides a financial reflection of this strategic shift, moving resources from core clinical development to commercial build-out. The consistent language about having ""sufficient cash for a period of at least one year"" from the Annual Report date (March 2025) further underscores management's confidence in funding through the critical Q3 2025 readout. The addition of broader geopolitical risks, such as ""armed conflicts in the Middle East,"" reflects a mature company's awareness of its global operating environment, moving beyond just internal R&D challenges. The narrative is now fully honed on the impending EFZO-FIT readout and the subsequent commercial launch, treating success as the primary, high-probability scenario for which they are meticulously preparing.

**Key Institutional Read: The Unmistakable Pivot ‚Äì A Time-Lapse View**

From a time-series perspective, the evolution of aTyr's business overview is a textbook example of a biotech progressing from a speculative platform play to a single-asset, binary-driven commercialisation story. The language shifts are not random or accidental; they represent a carefully managed and progressively aggressive narrative designed to align external perception with internal strategic execution. The gradual culling of pipeline diversity, the subtle introduction of commercial language, and then the overt commitment to pre-commercialisation activities create an incredibly strong signal of internal conviction that has been building over several years, culminating in the current ""all-in"" posture just months from the pivotal data. This deliberate progression implies that management has accumulated substantial internal data and confidence, making the upcoming catalyst highly anticipated and signalling a readiness that belies its current market capitalisation.

> **Hypothesis: Strategic Clarity Through Narrative Progression (95% Probability)**
>
> *Rationale:* The consistent, step-by-step evolution of the Business Overview narrative from broad exploration to laser-focused commercialisation for efzofitimod indicates a deeply ingrained, company-wide strategic clarity. This isn't a sudden, reactive shift but a well-thought-out, multi-year progression of resource allocation, executive decision-making, and public messaging. Such sustained, clear narrative development implies that internal data or insights have continually reinforced the executive team's conviction in efzofitimod's success and its significant market potential, leading them to shed non-core assets and invest heavily in commercial readiness. The tight control over the narrative, as evidenced by consistent phrasing and strategic timing of disclosures, reflects a highly disciplined management team executing a high-stakes plan.

## B. Pipeline: Shrinking for Focus, Growing for Optionality ‚Äì A Deliberate Concentration

The pipeline section of aTyr Pharma's filings provides a compelling time-series narrative, revealing a strategic evolution from a diversified discovery effort to a laser-focused, high-conviction bet on a single lead asset. This deliberate concentration of resources and narrative space speaks volumes about escalating internal confidence.

**2021‚Äì2022: Diversified Bets and the First Cull**

In 2021, aTyr‚Äôs pipeline was presented as a diversified portfolio, with efzofitimod as the ""lead programme"" but sharing significant space with other assets. The filings detailed ATYR2810, an NRP2 antibody programme for oncology, and even earlier-stage discovery programmes focused on other tRNA synthetases (AARS and DARS). This reflected a typical early-stage biotech approach: exploring multiple avenues from a broad scientific platform.

The crucial shift appeared in the 2022 filing: a strategic decision was made in Q3 2022 to ""pursue alternative avenues"" to advance ATYR2810, explicitly stating that internal resources would be focused elsewhere. This marked the first significant ""cull"" in the time series, a deliberate act of pruning the pipeline. It signalled a growing, but still nascent, conviction in efzofitimod's potential, choosing to prioritise its advancement over internal investment in other programmes. The initiation of the global pivotal Phase 3 EFZO-FIT study in Q3 2022 publicly cemented this shift, making efzofitimod the unequivocal flagship.

**2023: Dominance Takes Hold**

By 2023, efzofitimod had become the singularly dominant narrative within the pipeline section. The overwhelming majority of the discussion, particularly in the ""Product Candidates"" section, revolved around the EFZO-FIT pivotal trial. While ATYR0101 (DARS) and ATYR0750 (AARS) were named as ""next-gen preclinical candidates,"" their descriptions were brief, serving more as a nod to future optionality rather than immediate priorities. This narrowing reflects a company moving into full execution mode for its primary asset. The announcement of the EFZO-CONNECT Phase 2 study in SSc-ILD (Systemic Sclerosis-associated Interstitial Lung Disease) for efzofitimod further emphasised its centrality, exploring label expansion within the ILD space, rather than new, disparate therapeutic areas.

The Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) review for EFZO-FIT, concluding that the study could ""continue unmodified,"" was a critical, quiet de-risking event. While not a headline, it internally validated the trial's safety and design, likely fuelling deeper conviction within the company and solidifying its single-minded focus on efzofitimod.

**2024‚Äì2025 (Q1): The ""All-In"" Pipeline ‚Äì The Singular Focus**

The 2024 and Q1 2025 filings represent the zenith of this time-series concentration. The EFZO-FIT trial reached a critical milestone with enrolment completed in July 2024 (268 patients, exceeding target), setting the stage for the anticipated Q3 2025 topline readout as the singular, near-term binary event. The pipeline graphic and accompanying text unequivocally spotlight efzofitimod and its immediate label expansion potential (EFZO-CONNECT). The preclinical assets ATYR0101/0750 are consistently mentioned, but primarily as part of a ""plan to further elucidate their therapeutic potential""‚Äîsignalling long-term, high-conviction optionality if the lead asset succeeds, rather than active, resource-intensive development.

A profoundly significant time-series development is the emergence of the Individual Patient Expanded Access Programme (EAP), announced in February 2024. The filings explicitly state this EAP was ""based on blinded EFZO-FIT study investigator and patient participant feedback,"" and carefully distinguishes it as ""not an open-label extension (OLE) and no long-term data will be collected by us."" EAPs are typically a direct response to a compelling, real-world clinical need or perceived benefit emerging from ongoing trials. The fact that investigators and patients, while blinded to treatment arm, are proactively seeking continued access to efzofitimod is a powerful qualitative indicator of efficacy surfacing from the trial itself, even before unblinding. This ""pull"" from the medical community, rather than a ""push"" from the company, is an incredibly strong, organic signal of clinical confidence and potential efficacy, building directly from the ongoing Phase 3 study's progression. It speaks to a subtle, yet profound, shift from clinical observation to real-world demand.

**Hedge Fund Signal: The ""Winner Take All"" Play ‚Äì A Culmination of Confidence**

This progressive, time-series tightening of the pipeline is not arbitrary; it's a direct reflection of escalating internal conviction in efzofitimod. No senior management team takes an ""all-in"" bet of this magnitude, shedding other programmes and focusing capital so acutely, unless they possess compelling internal data or strong qualitative signals (like EAP demand) that profoundly bolster their confidence. The evolution of the pipeline narrative implies that resources, once distributed across various early programmes, are now optimally funnelled into the one asset believed to generate the most immediate and significant value. This strategic funneling amplifies both the potential upside and, inherently, the downside of the upcoming catalyst, demonstrating a highly focused and high-stakes approach to value creation.

> **Hypothesis: EAP as a Strong Leading Efficacy Indicator (90‚Äì95% Probability)**
>
> *Rationale:* The precise timing and stated rationale for the EAP (initiated once the trial was concluding and explicitly driven by ""blinded EFZO-FIT study investigator and patient participant feedback"") are critically important time-series cues. This is not a routine, broad open-label extension. Its appearance at this specific juncture, combined with the emphasis on investigator and patient feedback from a blinded study, indicates a genuine, unsolicited pull from the clinical community. This strongly implies that enough patients on the active drug in the trial are experiencing meaningful improvements (e.g., reductions in steroid use or stabilisation of lung function) for clinicians to advocate for continued access. This ""grassroots"" signal of perceived therapeutic benefit, while qualitative, is often a powerful leading indicator of positive efficacy and is highly predictive of eventual positive topline data. It suggests that aTyr is not just hoping for a win, but has received strong positive feedback from those closest to the trial data, allowing them to make such a bold move.

## C. Risk Factors: Disclosures as Market Psychology Signals ‚Äì The Diminishing Weight of Fear

The evolution of how aTyr Pharma presents its risk factors across its filings provides a unique and powerful time-series insight into management's changing perception of threats, their growing operational confidence, and their implicit belief in the company's trajectory. What begins as broad, defensive caution gradually shifts into a more nuanced articulation of challenges being actively managed.

**2021‚Äì2022: Overwhelming Caution and Explicit Regulatory Hurdles**

In these initial years, the filings were saturated with heavy, defensive, and frequently reiterated warnings. The language was stark, emphasising fundamental biotech risks such as ""substantial delays and other challenges in our planned clinical trials or we may fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities.""

A critical, specific hurdle highlighted in the 2022 10-K was the lack of an established regulatory pathway for pulmonary sarcoidosis:
> ""The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved any product candidate for the treatment of patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis, and as such, there is no established FDA regulatory pathway for approval of a drug in that indication. As a result, the EFZO-FIT study, even if successful, may not be sufficient to support FDA approval, which would materially and adversely harm our business.""

This explicit, daunting statement underscored a genuine, high-probability regulatory risk for a novel asset in a new indication. The sheer prominence and reiteration of these risks across the filings indicated a prudent, but also defensive, management stance, reflecting the significant uncertainties inherent in early-to-mid-stage clinical development.

**2023‚Äì2025: A Subtle Shift in Emphasis ‚Äì Risk Management as a Core Strategy**

As the time series progresses, a fascinating transformation occurs. While the legal language regarding regulatory pathways and clinical success persists (due to SEC reporting requirements, which mandate the disclosure of all known material risks), its placement, tone, and proportional weight within the overall filing begin to diminish. The consistent inclusion of the ""no established pathway"" risk, for example, subtly transforms from a stark, standalone warning into what appears as a necessary legal boilerplate, almost perfunctory, nestled within a broader discussion of strategic execution.

Crucially, the company begins to frame these risks within their explicit strategy for advancement. The phrase, first appearing prominently in the 2024 10-K and reiterated in the 2025 Q1 10-Q,
> ""Our strategy for the advancement of efzofitimod includes submitting data from the EFZO-FIT study to the FDA, which we expect to serve as the basis for U.S. regulatory approval,""

marks a significant time-series shift. This phrasing demonstrates a proactive, confident approach to risk mitigation, implying that the company believes it can navigate this specific regulatory challenge, rather than simply stating its existence. This is a subtle yet powerful signal of internal conviction, where the risks are acknowledged but managed within a positive forward-looking framework.

**CDMO/Manufacturing: Emerging Operational Vigilance ‚Äì A New Risk in Time Signalling Proximity to Launch**

A particularly insightful time-series development is the appearance of specific, detailed risk language regarding ""CDMO (Contract Development and Manufacturing Organisation) manufacturing stoppages and other CDMO challenges"" in the 2024 and 2025 filings, which were not as explicitly prominent in earlier years. This isn't just generic manufacturing risk; it's specific to the intricacies of relying on third-party manufacturers as the product approaches commercial scale. The 2025 10-Q goes further, noting risks from ""operational errors at the CDMO... could negatively impact the timing of our potential BLA submission and could require significant additional funding.""

This new emphasis suggests that the company is moving from theoretical manufacturing considerations to actual commercial scale-up, where reliance on third-party manufacturers (CDMOs) becomes a critical operational vulnerability. Its emergence now, just months from potential approval, is a direct signal of commercialisation readiness and foresight. It implies that this is a current, active operational concern rather than a distant possibility, as they are preparing to literally make the drug for market. This time-series observation indicates a shift from distant clinical-stage worries to tangible, commercial-stage operational challenges.

**Dilution/Capital: From Warning to Routine Funding ‚Äì A Progressive Financial Narrative**

The narrative around dilution and capital raising also undergoes a significant time-series transformation. In 2021‚Äì2022, the need for additional capital was a prominent and frequently reiterated risk, creating an overhang. The significant increase in share count from ~16M (Dec 2020) to ~53M (March 2023) reflected the necessity of early-stage funding. However, from 2023 onwards, the tone shifts dramatically. Capital raises (e.g., $66.2M in 2023) are reported more matter-of-factly. Crucially, the consistent statement
> ""We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents... will be sufficient to meet our material cash requirements... for a period of at least one year from the date of this Annual Report""
(reiterated across 2023, 2024, and Q1 2025 filings) is a powerful, ongoing signal. This indicates active and successful financial planning to ensure a cash runway through the anticipated Q3 2025 readout, mitigating near-term dilution risk. The continued growth in share count to ~89M (May 2025) is the cost of this runway, but the narrative implies it was a necessary and well-managed trade-off for strategic execution.

**Hedge Fund Signal: Conviction Outweighs Caution ‚Äì The Sublimation of Fear**

This progressive ""dilution"" of fear in the risk factors section, evidenced by their diminishing prominence and changed framing over the time series, coupled with rising operational spend on commercialisation, is a powerful time-series indicator of management's conviction. They are legally compelled to disclose risks, but their resource allocation decisions (ramping up pre-commercial activities, despite these acknowledged risks) signal an internal belief that the probability of success fundamentally outweighs the magnitude of these disclosed risks. The explicit CDMO risk, while new, highlights their advanced state of commercial planning rather than a debilitating problem. The overall narrative shift demonstrates a confident management actively managing risks on a path they believe will lead to approval and commercialisation.

> **Hypothesis: High Internal Confidence in Regulatory Pathway (80‚Äì90% Probability of Sufficient Data)**
>
> *Rationale:* The time-series analysis shows a clear shift in the regulatory risk narrative: from broadly stating the problem of ""no established pathway"" to proactively framing it within their BLA (Biologics License Application) submission strategy. This change, coupled with the increasing investment in pre-commercialisation efforts, suggests management's strong internal conviction that their EFZO-FIT data, if positive, will indeed be sufficient for FDA approval. This is not mere optimism; it implies a deep internal assessment, possibly informed by ongoing, although private, dialogue with the FDA, that has yielded enough clarity or confidence to make these aggressive commercial moves. They are implicitly signalling that they believe they can define or navigate this novel pathway successfully with their clinical data. This confidence is a culmination of years of clinical execution and likely regulatory engagement.

Our top picks: TRX suspension trainer for versatility, adjustable dumbbells for strength, and foldable treadmills for cardio - all fitting in spaces under 50 square feet.

# Small Space Fitness Planning: Maximizing Your Available Area

Creating an effective home gym in a small space isn't about cramming as much equipment as possible into every corner - it's about strategic selection of multi-functional equipment that maximizes workout variety while minimizing space requirements.

# Space Assessment Fundamentals

**Measuring Your Available Space:** Before purchasing any equipment, conduct a thorough space audit of your living area. Here's how to identify workout-friendly zones:

**Primary Workout Zones:**

* **Living room:** Typically offers 6x8 feet of clearable floor space
* **Bedroom:** Usually provides 4x6 feet when furniture is moved
* **Garage/storage room:** Often 8x10 feet but may have temperature/ventilation issues
* **Outdoor spaces:** Balconies, patios, or shared courtyard areas

**Space Calculation Method:**

1. **Measure total floor area** in each potential workout room
2. **Subtract permanent furniture** that cannot be moved
3. **Account for safety clearance** (2 feet around equipment when in use)
4. **Consider ceiling height** for overhead movements (minimum 8 feet)
5. **Evaluate storage options** for equipment when not in use

# The 3-Zone Small Space Gym Strategy

**Zone 1: Active Workout Area (20-40 sq ft)** This is your primary exercise space that must be kept clear during workouts. Equipment here should be easily moveable or foldable.

**Zone 2: Storage/Setup Area (10-20 sq ft)** Adjacent space for equipment storage and quick setup. This can overlap with living space when using furniture that doubles as storage.

**Zone 3: Overhead/Wall Space** Vertical storage and wall-mounted equipment that doesn't consume floor space. Often the most underutilized area in small space planning.

**Real-World Example:** *Sarah's 450 sq ft studio apartment uses a 6x6 living room area for workouts, stores equipment under her bed and in a decorative storage ottoman, and utilizes wall-mounted TRX anchor points. Total equipment footprint when stored: 8 square feet.*

# Common Small Space Challenges and Solutions

**Challenge: Limited Floor Space**

* **Solution:** Prioritize vertical storage and wall-mounted equipment
* **Equipment focus:** Suspension trainers, resistance bands, wall-mounted pull-up bars
* **Storage strategy:** Under-bed storage, wall hooks, ceiling-mounted systems

**Challenge: Noise Concerns (Apartments)**

* **Solution:** Focus on low-impact, quiet equipment and add sound dampening
* **Equipment focus:** Resistance training, yoga, quiet cardio alternatives
* **Noise reduction:** Exercise mats, carpet padding, time restrictions

**Challenge: Multi-Purpose Living Space**

* **Solution:** Furniture that doubles as fitness equipment and quick setup/breakdown
* **Equipment focus:** Storage ottomans, foldable equipment, portable options
* **Organization strategy:** 5-minute setup rule, designated storage zones

# What exercise equipment is apartment-friendly for noise?

**Answer:** **Resistance bands, TRX suspension trainers, dumbbells, and kettlebells** are excellent quiet options. **Yoga and bodyweight exercises** create minimal noise. Avoid: treadmills without proper mats, jumping exercises without sound dampening, and equipment with mechanical noise. Use exercise mats, carpet padding, and consider neighbor schedules when planning workouts.

# Is it worth buying expensive compact fitness equipment?

**Answer:** For regular use (3+ times per week), premium compact equipment often justifies the cost through superior durability, better workout variety, and enhanced user experience. **PowerBlock dumbbells** last decades vs. budget adjustables that break yearly. **TRX trainers** provide superior versatility compared to basic suspension systems. Consider cost-per-workout over 3-5 years when evaluating value.

# How do you create a home gym in a studio apartment?

# What's the most versatile piece of fitness equipment for small spaces?

**Answer:** The **TRX suspension trainer** wins for versatility, providing strength, cardio, and flexibility training in a 2-pound package that stores anywhere. However, **adjustable dumbbells** are equally valuable for those prioritizing strength training, while **resistance band systems** offer the best value and smallest storage footprint.

# Can resistance bands replace weights for strength training?

**Answer:** High-quality resistance bands can provide effective strength training, especially for beginners to intermediate users. They offer variable resistance and can be ""stacked"" for heavier loads. However, for maximum strength development and progressive overload, **adjustable dumbbells or kettlebells** remain superior. Many users find success combining bands with weights for complete training flexibility.

# Conclusion: Building Your Perfect Small Space Gym

After testing 25+ pieces of compact fitness equipment across multiple small living spaces over 12 months, the key to small space fitness success lies not in cramming maximum equipment into minimum space, but in strategic selection of multi-functional tools that maximize workout variety while minimizing storage requirements.

**The Small Space Fitness Reality:** Creating an effective home gym in limited space requires a fundamental shift from traditional equipment thinking. Instead of asking ""What equipment do I want?"" the question becomes ""What workout capabilities do I need, and what's the most space-efficient way to achieve them?""

**Our Proven Small Space Gym Formulas:**

**Minimalist Setup (Under $150, 3 sq ft storage):**

* **TRX GO Suspension Trainer** ($95) - Complete bodyweight strength and cardio
* **Resistance Band Set** ($40) - Variable resistance strength training
* **Jump Rope** ($15) - High-intensity cardio
* **Total capability:** Full-body workouts rivaling commercial gyms

**Complete Setup (Under $750, 8 sq ft storage):**

* **PowerBlock Adjustable Dumbbells** ($400) - Progressive strength training
* **TRX Suspension Trainer** ($150) - Bodyweight and functional training
* **Kettlebell Set** ($120) - Power, cardio, and strength integration
* **Foldable Exercise Bench** ($80) - Enhanced exercise variety
* **Total capability:** Professional-grade training in apartment-sized space

**Budget Setup (Under $100, 2 sq ft storage):**

* **Resistance Band System** ($40) - Complete strength training
* **Basic Suspension Trainer** ($30) - Bodyweight exercises
* **Yoga Mat** ($20) - Exercise surface and flexibility
* **Jump Rope** ($10) - Cardio conditioning
* **Total capability:** Effective fitness maintenance and improvement

**Key Success Principles:**

1. **Multi-functionality trumps specialization** \- Choose equipment that serves multiple purposes
2. **Storage efficiency enables consistency** \- Equipment you can't easily access won't get used
3. **Quality investment pays long-term dividends** \- Premium compact equipment lasts years longer
4. **Quick setup enables spontaneous workouts** \- 5-minute setup rule maintains exercise habits
5. **Vertical thinking maximizes space** \- Walls and overhead areas are underutilized resources

**The Reality Check:** Small space fitness isn't about compromising your fitness goals - it's about optimizing your approach. Our testing proved that strategic equipment selection can provide workout variety and effectiveness that rivals commercial gyms while fitting in spaces smaller than most walk-in closets.

**Your Next Steps:**

1. **Assess your actual available space** \- Measure workout area and storage options realistically
2. **Identify your fitness priorities** \- Strength, cardio, flexibility, or balanced approach
3. **Choose equipment based on space efficiency ratios** \- Maximum capability per square foot
4. **Start with core multi-functional pieces** \- Build your system gradually rather than all at once
5. **Develop your setup/breakdown routine** \- Practice makes spontaneous workouts possible

**The Bottom Line on Small Space Fitness:** Limited space doesn't have to limit your fitness potential. With strategic equipment selection and creative space utilization, you can create workout capabilities that exceed many commercial gyms while maintaining the convenience and cost-effectiveness of home fitness.

*Your small space can become your fitness advantage - no commute, no crowds, no excuses. Choose your equipment wisely, organize strategically, and discover that the best gym might be the one that fits in your living room.*

**Testing Methodology Disclosure:** All equipment was tested in real small living spaces including studio apartments, one-bedroom apartments, and shared living situations. Space measurements, storage assessments, and workout capabilities were evaluated over 6-12 month periods with multiple users of different fitness levels and living situations.

I'm older and more experienced now, i know myself better. I know i do well with structure, and i don't do well with protein.   
  
Now is the time for a new experiment... the primary goal is to get back to the level of energy and activity i had in september 2023.   
The secondary goal is cancer prevention (i'm 44 years old) through improved insulin sensitivity, autophagy, and anti angiogenesis foods.   
Tertiary goal is to lose excess body fat.   
  
I pay quickly for excess dietary fat (sluggish, elevated heart rate), but it resolves in a day. Excess protein is more insidious, and i need at least several week of low protein to see any improvement in my energy levels.

So i've made an eating plan for a whole (lunar !!) year. The new year starts in a few days, June 27. This lunar year is 355 days.

Meal frequency :   
\- 3MAD 5% of the time.  
\- OMAD 15 to 20% of the time : dinner, sometimes preceded by a few hours of dry fasting  
\- 2MAD 75 to 80% of the time : breakfast, dinner, and a midday coffee

Food macros (see attached pic for planning) are divided into four tiers :  
\- gold : 15 days of **feasting** : high fat (up to 160g), ad lib protein without forcing it, moderate carb  
\- blue: 50 days of modified **fasting** : zero fat, minimal protein (banana, potato, broccoli), moderate carb  
\- violet: 90 **moderate** days : low fat (30g), low protein, moderate carb   
\- green: 200 **lean** days : very low fat (10g), low protein, moderate carb 

There is enough variety to keep me entertained, but enough structure to keep me on plan.   
Fat sources are egg yolks, cream, butter, mutton tallow, and chocolate. Keeping all my fat budget for dinner, except on feast days.

Carb are ""moderate"" rather than ""high"", as long as i have extra calories on my own body. I'm hoping to settle on a savory, starchy breakfast... someday. For now it's usually fruit.

Breakfast is tea and bananas, maybe other fruits, sometimes jam on bread. Occasionally buckwheat crepes.  
Midday espresso has sugar.  
Dinner is vegetables, fat and starch (in that order). No sugar, or keeping it extra low. Sometimes glycine in my night tea.

1lj9nz5,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_imjonconner/comments/1lj9nz5/what_happened_after_i_took_this_daily_dental/,What Happened After I Took This Daily Dental Supplement for 30 Days,"I‚Äôve always taken oral hygiene seriously. I brush twice a day, floss (almost) every night, and try not to go too long between dentist visits. Yet, despite all my efforts, I still found myself dealing with the same frustrating problems: bleeding gums, occasional bad breath, and a sensitivity to cold drinks that made summer a little less enjoyable.

So when I came across a growing buzz online about a natural [dental supplement](https://checkqit.com/what-happened-after-i-took-this-daily-dental-supplement-for-30-days/) called¬†**ProvaDent**, I was curious ‚Äî but skeptical. I‚Äôd never really thought of taking a pill to support my gums and teeth. Like most people, I figured oral health started and ended with what you physically did to your mouth ‚Äî brush, floss, rinse, repeat.

# [Visit Official Website](https://af099i53t9kf4lea0g74g8-eed.hop.clickbank.net/)

Still, the idea of something working from the¬†*inside out*¬†caught my attention. And with so many people sharing their stories, I figured: why not try it myself for 30 days and see what happens?

Here‚Äôs how it went.

# Week 1: A New Routine

Starting a supplement regimen feels a bit like trying to get into the habit of stretching every day ‚Äî you know it‚Äôs good for you, but it takes a minute to click.

I took one capsule of ProvaDent each morning with my breakfast. The pill itself was easy to swallow, with no strong aftertaste or noticeable smell. It didn‚Äôt upset my stomach, which I appreciated since I have a somewhat sensitive digestive system.

The ingredients list looked promising ‚Äî zinc, berberine, milk thistle, artichoke extract, beetroot, and a few others that claimed to support everything from healthy circulation to bacterial balance. It seemed thoughtfully formulated, not just a random mix of herbs.

# [Visit Official Website](https://af099i53t9kf4lea0g74g8-eed.hop.clickbank.net/)

That said, I wasn‚Äôt expecting miracles overnight.

By the end of the first week, I hadn‚Äôt noticed any huge changes, but one thing I did realize was that my breath seemed‚Ä¶ cleaner. Not minty ‚Äî just less ‚Äúmorning-breath‚Äù and more neutral. It was subtle, but enough for me to keep paying attention.

# Week 2: Something‚Äôs Changing

This was when I started noticing a difference in how my gums felt. Usually, when I floss, there‚Äôs some bleeding ‚Äî not a lot, but enough to make me wince. During week two, that bleeding began to noticeably decrease.

I wasn‚Äôt doing anything different with my flossing technique, so it caught my attention.

My teeth also seemed to feel¬†*cleaner*, even in between brushing. It‚Äôs hard to explain ‚Äî like the usual fuzziness you sometimes feel late in the day wasn‚Äôt there. I‚Äôd seen a few¬†[**ProvaDent reviews**](https://checkqit.com/provadent-reviews-complaints/)¬†online where users mentioned the same thing, and now I understood what they meant.

# [Visit Official Website](https://af099i53t9kf4lea0g74g8-eed.hop.clickbank.net/)

Here‚Äôs a quote I‚Äôd read earlier that echoed what I was feeling:

>

Was it placebo? Maybe. But I‚Äôve had placebo effects before, and this felt more like a gentle, consistent improvement than wishful thinking.

# Week 3: No More Sensitivity?

One of the biggest surprises came around day 17 or 18. I was sipping an iced coffee ‚Äî something I normally drink through a straw because of cold sensitivity ‚Äî and I realized I didn‚Äôt need the straw.

I took a few more sips. Still no zinging feeling in my molars. Could it really be from a supplement?

I checked back on the product information. ProvaDent claims to support not just gum health, but¬†**overall oral tissue strength**, which could explain why my teeth didn‚Äôt feel as ‚Äúraw‚Äù as they used to with cold drinks.

I also found this user comment in a discussion thread:

>

Of course, I‚Äôm not suddenly chomping on popsicles, but the fact that I could enjoy an iced drink without wincing felt like a small victory.

# Week 4: Real Results

By week four, I was genuinely impressed. Here‚Äôs a rundown of the most noticeable changes:

# 1.¬†Healthier Gums

Flossing was no longer something I dreaded. My gums didn‚Äôt bleed, didn‚Äôt ache, and looked pinker. There was also no soreness along the gumline after brushing.

# 2.¬†Fresher Breath

I hadn‚Äôt used mouthwash in over two weeks and didn‚Äôt miss it. Even after meals or waking up, my breath felt neutral ‚Äî not minty, but definitely not offensive. My partner actually commented that my ‚Äúmorning breath isn‚Äôt even a thing anymore,‚Äù which I took as a major compliment.

# 3.¬†Reduced Sensitivity

This was huge. I used to avoid cold drinks and had a mild aching sensation when breathing through my mouth on a windy day. That‚Äôs almost entirely gone now.

# 4.¬†Clean Feeling All Day

This one‚Äôs harder to quantify, but you know when your teeth feel ‚Äúfilmy‚Äù by late afternoon? That barely happened anymore. It‚Äôs like the oral environment just felt‚Ä¶ balanced.

# [Visit Official Website](https://af099i53t9kf4lea0g74g8-eed.hop.clickbank.net/)

# A Word on Side Effects

I experienced¬†**no negative side effects**¬†during the 30 days.

I know that‚Äôs not everyone‚Äôs experience ‚Äî I saw one review where someone mentioned slight nausea if they took it on an empty stomach. But I always took it with breakfast and had zero issues.

Still, it‚Äôs worth noting that ProvaDent contains herbs like berberine and milk thistle, which could interact with certain medications. If you‚Äôre on any prescriptions, it‚Äôs smart to ask your doctor first.

# Is ProvaDent Worth Trying?

In my opinion, yes ‚Äî especially if you‚Äôre someone who:

* Has mild to moderate gum problems
* Struggles with bad breath
* Has sensitive teeth
* Wants a more natural and proactive way to care for your mouth

I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this as a substitute for seeing a dentist or brushing your teeth. It‚Äôs a¬†**supplement**, not a magic bullet. But as an added layer of support? It‚Äôs impressive.

And based on a range of¬†**ProvaDent reviews**¬†I‚Äôve seen, I‚Äôm not the only one who thinks so:

>

# [Visit Official Website](https://af099i53t9kf4lea0g74g8-eed.hop.clickbank.net/)

# Final Thoughts: 30 Days Later

I started this experiment unsure if a capsule could make any real difference in my oral health. Thirty days later, I‚Äôm a convert.

ProvaDent didn‚Äôt just help ‚Äî it delivered results I could feel and see. My gums are healthier, my breath is fresher, and I don‚Äôt dread the sting of cold drinks anymore. That‚Äôs more than I expected from a bottle of supplements.

Will I keep taking it? Absolutely.

If you‚Äôre on the fence and tired of trying different toothpastes or mouthwashes with little to no effect, it might be worth giving ProvaDent a shot. It‚Äôs simple, it‚Äôs natural, and based on my 30-day trial ‚Äî it works.

1lj9nwu,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/1lj9nwu/stop_fearing_cr_assumptions_youre_already_an/,Stop Fearing CR Assumptions ‚Äì You're Already an Expert at Identifying Assumptions! üéØ,"Every time you decide when to leave for work, what to wear, or whether to check your phone before an important meeting, you're solving assumption questions. These everyday decisions require the exact same logical thinking process as CR assumption questions. So why does everyone panic when they see them on the GMAT?  
**The Real Talk About Assumptions**  
Here's the thing ‚Äì assumptions aren't some mystical GMAT concept invented to confuse students. They're literally how your brain works every single day. You just don't realize you're doing it!  
Think about it: You're managing a project at work and your boss asks, ""When will this be done?"" You look at the scope, check your resources, and confidently say, ""Two weeks."" But wait ‚Äì how did you arrive at that date?  
**You made assumptions:**  
\* Your team members won't quit mid-project.  
\* The client won't change requirements (LOL, good luck with that one!)  
\* Your only developer won't disappear on a spontaneous meditation retreat without a replacement.  
\* The coffee machine won't break down (okay, maybe that's just me).  
If ANY of these assumptions fail, your deadline goes out the window faster than your motivation on a Monday morning.  
**That's exactly what CR assumptions are** ‚Äì the essential, unspoken conditions that must be true for a conclusion to hold up.  
**The Two Golden Rules of Correct Assumptions**  
Every correct assumption has these characteristics:

1. **It brings in NEW information** (not already stated in the argument)
2. **It's MUST BE TRUE** (if you flip it to false, the conclusion crumbles like a cookie) Let's Practice with Real Life **Scenario:** You're heading out for a few hours. You glance outside ‚Äì clear skies, no clouds in sight. You think, ""Perfect! No need for an umbrella today."" **What assumptions are you making?**

**Pop Quiz:** Which of these is NOT a correct assumption?

1. In the next few hours, it can rain enough to need an umbrella only if it's cloudy right now.
2. It won't get cloudy soon enough.
3. You won't need an umbrella for sun protection.
4. It won't rain today at all. .

.

.  
*The answer:*  
**Number 4 is wrong!** Here's why: It could absolutely rain today ‚Äì just AFTER you get back home. Since you only need the umbrella while you're out, what happens after you return is irrelevant. This assumption isn't ""must be true"" for your conclusion to work.  
The first three? Spot on! Try negating any of them and watch your ""no umbrella needed"" conclusion fall apart:  
\* ""It can rain enough to need an umbrella in the next few hours even without clouds right now"" ‚Üí Uh oh, better grab that umbrella!  
\* ""It'll definitely get cloudy soon"" ‚Üí We have a problem!  
\* ""I absolutely need an umbrella for sun protection"" ‚Üí Plot twist!

**The Bottom Line**  
Stop treating assumption questions like they're written in ancient hieroglyphics. You've been solving them since you learned to think logically. The GMAT just puts them in fancy academic language to mess with your head.  
**Pro tip:** When you see an assumption question, channel your inner project manager. What unstated conditions need to be true for this argument to work? What could go wrong that isn't already covered?  
Trust me, once you realize assumptions are just common sense in disguise, these questions become way less intimidating. You've got this! üí™  
**Your Turn to Think Deeper! üïµÔ∏è**  
Now that you've got the hang of identifying assumptions, let's dive deeper with some thought-provoking questions:

1. Is there any limit on the number of assumptions in an argument?
2. Is an assumption a sufficient condition? In other words, will a conclusion definitely hold true if an assumption is true?
3. Can you think of any other assumptions for the umbrella scenario we just discussed?
4. What's your biggest struggle with CR assumptions? **Drop your thoughts in the comments! Let's see how deep your assumption detective skills go.**",7,1750767741.0,GMAT,0,1.0,False

I posted a short while ago because was offered an opportunity in Liverpool.

I've since had one become available in Belfast as well.

I'm not asking everyone to choose cities for me or anything, but I know Belfast a little better than Liverpool so I'm just seeing if anyone has an insight into the relative pros and cons of both?

I love Belfast for its friendly people, laid back lifestyle, and the nature which is so close to the city.

I also feel like there's an underlying 'indie arts' type buzz, with a good coffee scene, and trad music too... it feels a little bit 'up and coming' and hipster to me.

I also feel really safe there - even though the sectarianism is still an obvious problem; I'm not involved in any of that so I just ignore it all. There's kind of a 'church culture' there too - which would annoy a lot of people, but I quite like it because it aligns with my worldview in a lot of ways.

I know Liverpool a tiny bit, and was initially drawn to it because I felt the Irish influence, and it feels like a young, vibrant city - bigger than some, but way smaller than London (which is good, imo).

But yeah - I'm just getting a sense of how those two options might compare to each other.

I've seen a few posts on this subreddit about petty crime/teenagers being annoying, too - so I guess I also wondered about that.

Any thoughts or opinions would be gratefully received! :)

Thanks everyone

1lj9krd,https://www.reddit.com/r/northernireland/comments/1lj9krd/what_do_do_for_a_first_date/,What do do for a first date?,I live in the country and am giving online dating a try (I know) and want to know what do people do for a first date? Do I go to a restaurant? Do you go for a drive and then get something to eat like McDonald's or something(I'm not a fan of McDonald's) or get coffee. See the way my hours work I can only do evenings like 7 onwards for dates so coffee is nearly out as most places close early. I've only been on one date and that was to a restaurant which went well.

1lj9jmp,https://www.reddit.com/r/BusinessPH/comments/1lj9jmp/affordable_coffee_near_schools_still_worth_it_in/,Affordable Coffee Near Schools ‚Äì Still Worth It in 2025? Need Insight!,"Hi! I‚Äôm planning to open a small coffee kiosk near a high school, selling affordable drinks (around ‚Ç±39 per cup). I know the coffee market is very saturated already, but I‚Äôm wondering ‚Äî is this kind of setup still profitable if placed near schools?

If anyone here has experience selling budget coffee near schools or universities, I‚Äôd really appreciate your insights!

‚Ä¢How many cups do you usually sell on a regular day?
	
‚Ä¢How about during rainy days ‚Äî do sales drop a lot?
 
‚Ä¢And in general, do students still go for the PHP 39 price point, or are they more into other trending drinks now?

Any advice would help. Thank you in advance!

The mocha Master is not designed to sprinkle water under the coffee in a perfectly uniform manner. So stop worrying about that. Taste your coffee and adjust your grind size according to the taste. The starting point for your water ratio is 16 to 1. Start there and add water a little bit at a time. Until it tastes right to you. I brew world class coffee and this is what my coffee bed looks like.",0,1750767343.0,Moccamaster,12,0.5,False

Years ago, I had a cake decorating/jams and jellies home business called Aunt Dee's Sweets. I did everything from charcuterie tables to wedding cakes to party planning. This is my diorama fantasy if I'd have had a shop front. There's a LOT of Miniverse originals and remixes in here. Shelves, display case and floor sign were purchased online. Chalkboards were purchased at dollar store and used white acrylic paint pens for text. Cake table is made from bass wood and tissue paper for table cloth. Breads are painted polymer clay. Front door is craft foam. Window frames are coffee stirrers. Welcome mat is piece of old quilt and acrylic paint.",18,1750767322.0,dioramas,1,1.0,False

1lj9hqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/NevilleGoddard/comments/1lj9hqy/feeling_extremely_depressed/,Feeling extremely depressed,"Last month, I got an interview for my dream job. I would use Neville‚Äôs teachings to manifest that I had a successful interview and was working in that dream position. I would effortlessly imagine myself in that job, truly feel a sense of happiness and belonging that my life worked out so well. It felt incredibly natural and fun.

Then, I ended up bombing the interview and didn‚Äôt receive an offer. I was extremely devastated. A lot of you on here advised me to keep persisting and revise. I‚Äôve done that for weeks and haven‚Äôt seen anything. I‚Äôm also worried to continue revising and putting myself in that headspace, because the reason the initial rejection was so devastating to me in the first place is because of how heavily I was immersed in the state of having the job in the first place. 

I‚Äôve always wanted to believe the law but never had success, even with small manifestations such as balls, coffee, and fruit. I can‚Äôt seem to understand what I‚Äôm doing wrong. It seems everyone here has different interpretations of successful people (urgency and desire has the highest success, forgetting and letting go works better, etc.) 

Just reading other success stories, if it were anyone else that immersed themselves like I did, they would have had the desire. So why not me? What am I missing and why have I never been successful? I read Neville and apply his teachings just like you all. Please don‚Äôt tell me I don‚Äôt, as I truly did shift my internal state before that job interview. I just don‚Äôt know what to believe and any advice would be helpful.",8,1750767245.0,NevilleGoddard,6,0.91,False
