I Will Never Step Foot Inside a Jungle Again - Part 1 of 2,"My name is Sarah Branch. A few years ago, when I was 24 years old, I had left my home state of Utah and moved abroad to work as an English language teacher in Vietnam. Having just graduated BYU and earning my degree in teaching, I suddenly realized I needed so much more from my life. I always wanted to travel, embrace other cultures, and most of all, have memorable and life-changing experiences.  

Feeling trapped in my normal, everyday life outside of Salt Lake City, where winters are cold and summers always far away, I decided I was no longer going to live the life that others had chosen for me, and instead choose my own path in life – a life of fulfilment and little regrets. Already attaining my degree in teaching, I realized if I gained a further ESL Certification (teaching English as a second language), I could finally achieve my lifelong dream of travelling the world to far-away and exotic places – all the while working for a reasonable income. 

There were so many places I dreamed of going – maybe somewhere in South America or far east Asia. As long as the weather was warm and there were beautiful beaches for me to soak up the sun, I honestly did not mind. Scanning my finger over a map of the world, rotating from one hemisphere to the other, I eventually put my finger down on a narrow, little country called Vietnam. This was by no means a random choice. I had always wanted to travel to Vietnam because... I’m actually one-quarter Vietnamese. Not that you can tell or anything - my hair is brown and my skin is rather fair. But I figured, if I wanted to go where the sun was always shining, and there was an endless supply of tropical beaches, Vietnam would be the perfect destination! Furthermore, I’d finally get the chance to explore my heritage. 

Fortunately enough for me, it turned out Vietnam had a huge demand for English language teachers. They did prefer it if you were teaching in the country already - but after a few online interviews and some Visa complications later, I packed up my things in Utah and moved across the world to the Land of the Blue Dragon.  

I was relocated to a beautiful beach town in Central Vietnam, right along the coast of the South China Sea. English teachers don’t really get to choose where in the country they end up, but if I did have that option, I could not have picked a more perfect place... Because of the horrific turn this story will take, I can’t say where exactly it was in Central Vietnam I lived, or even the name of the beach town I resided in - just because I don’t want anyone to get the wrong idea. This part of Vietnam is a truly beautiful place and I don’t want to discourage anyone from going there. So, for the continuation of this story, I’m just going to refer to where I was as Central Vietnam – and as for the beach town where I made my living, I’m going to give it the pseudonym “Biển Hứa Hẹn” - which in Vietnamese, roughly, but rather fittingly translates to “Sea of Promise.”   

Biển Hứa Hẹn truly was the most perfect destination! It was a modest sized coastal town, nestled inside of a tropical bay, with the whitest sands and clearest blue waters you could possibly dream of. The town itself is also spectacular. Most of the houses and buildings are painted a vibrant sunny yellow, not only to look more inviting to tourists, but so to reflect the sun during the hottest months. For this reason, I originally wanted to give the town the nickname “Trấn Màu Vàng” (Yellow Town), but I quickly realized how insensitive that pseudonym would have been – so “Sea of Promise” it is!  

Alongside its bright, sunny buildings, Biển Hứa Hẹn has the most stunning oriental and French Colonial architecture – interspersed with many quality restaurants and coffee shops. The local cuisine is to die for! Not only is it healthy and delicious, but it's also surprisingly cheap – like we’re only talking 90 cents! You wouldn’t believe how many different flavours of Coffee Vietnam has. I mean, I went a whole 24 years without even trying coffee, and since I’ve been here, I must have tried around two-dozen flavours. Another whimsy little aspect of this town is the many multi-coloured, little plastic chairs that are dispersed everywhere. So whether it was dining on the local cuisine or trying my twenty-second flavour of coffee, I would always find one of these chairs – a different colour every time, sit down in the shade and just watch the world go by. 

I haven’t even mentioned how much I loved my teaching job. My classes were the most adorable 7 and 8 year-olds, and my colleagues were so nice and welcoming. They never called me by my first name. Instead my colleagues would always say “Chào em” or “Chào em gái”, which basically means “Hello little sister.”  

When I wasn’t teaching or grading papers, I spent most of my leisure time by the town’s beach - and being the boring, vanilla person I am, I didn’t really do much. Feeling the sun upon my skin while I observed the breath-taking scenery was more than enough – either that or I was curled up in a good book... I was never the only foreigner on this beach. Biển Hứa Hẹn is a popular tourist destination – mostly Western backpackers and surfers. So, if I wasn’t turning pink beneath the sun or memorizing every little detail of the bay’s geography, I would enviously spectate fellow travellers ride the waves. 

As much as I love Vietnam - as much as I love Biển Hứa Hẹn, what really spoils this place from being the perfect paradise is all the garbage pollution. I mean, it’s just everywhere. There is garbage in the town, on the beach and even in the ocean – and if it isn’t the garbage that spoils everything, it certainly is all the rats, cockroaches and other vermin brought with it. Biển Hứa Hẹn is such a unique place and it honestly makes me so mad that no one does anything about it... Nevertheless, I still love it here. It will always be a paradise to me – and if America was the Promised Land for Lehi and his descendants, then this was going to be my Promised Land.  

I had now been living in Biển Hứa Hẹn for 4 months, and although I had only 3 months left in my teaching contract, I still planned on staying in Vietnam - even if that meant leaving this region I’d fallen in love with and relocating to another part of the country. Since I was going to stay, I decided I really needed to learn Vietnamese – as you’d be surprised how few people there are in Vietnam who can speak any to no English. Although most English teachers in South-East Asia use their leisure time to travel, I rather boringly decided to spend most of my days at the same beach, sat amongst the sand while I studied and practised what would hopefully become my second language. 

On one of those days, I must have been completely occupied in my own world, because when I look up, I suddenly see someone standing over, talking down to me. I take off my headphones, and shading the sun from my eyes, I see a tall, late-twenty-something tourist - wearing only swim shorts and cradling a surfboard beneath his arm. Having come in from the surf, he thought I said something to him as he passed by, where I then told him I was speaking Vietnamese to myself, and didn’t realize anyone could hear me. We both had a good laugh about it and the guy introduces himself as Tyler. Like me, Tyler was American, and unsurprisingly, he was from California. He came to Vietnam for no other reason than to surf. Like I said, Tyler was this tall, very tanned guy – like he was the tannest guy I had ever seen. He had all these different tattoos he acquired from his travels, and long brown hair, which he regularly wore in a man-bun. When I first saw him standing there, I was taken back a little, because I almost mistook him as Jesus Christ – that's what he looked like. Tyler asks what I’m doing in Vietnam and later in the conversation, he invites me to have a drink with him and his surfer buddies at the beach town bar. I was a little hesitant to say yes, only because I don’t really drink alcohol, but Tyler seemed like a nice guy and so I agreed.  

Later that day, I meet Tyler at the bar and he introduces me to his three surfer friends. The first of Tyler’s friends was Chris, who he knew from back home. Chris was kinda loud and a little obnoxious, but I suppose he was also funny. The other two friends were Brodie and Hayley - a couple from New Zealand. Tyler and Chris met them while surfing in Australia – and ever since, the four of them have been travelling, or more accurately, surfing the world together. Over a few drinks, we all get to know each other a little better and I told them what it’s like to teach English in Vietnam. Curious as to how they’re able to travel so much, I ask them what they all do for a living. Tyler says they work as vloggers, bloggers and general content creators, all the while travelling to a different country every other month. You wouldn’t believe the number of places they’ve been to: Hawaii, Costa Rica, Sri Lanka, Bali – everywhere! They didn’t see the value of staying in just one place and working a menial job, when they could be living their best lives, all the while being their own bosses. It did make a lot of sense to me, and was not that unsimilar to my reasoning for being in Vietnam.  

The four of them were only going to be in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple more days, but when I told them I hadn’t yet explored the rest of the country, they insisted that I tag along with them. I did come to Vietnam to travel, not just stay in one place – the only problem was I didn’t have anyone to do it with... But I guess now I did. They even invited me to go surfing with them the next day. Having never surfed a day in my life, I very nearly declined the offer, but coming all this way from cold and boring Utah, I knew I had to embrace new and exciting opportunities whenever they arrived. 

By early next morning, and pushing through my first hangover, I had officially surfed my first ever wave. I was a little afraid I’d embarrass myself – especially in front of Tyler, but after a few trials and errors, I thankfully gained the hang of it. Even though I was a newbie at surfing, I could not have been that bad, because as soon as I surf my first successful wave, Chris would not stop calling me “Johnny Utah” - not that I knew what that meant. If I wasn’t embarrassing myself on a board, I definitely was in my ignorance of the guys’ casual movie quotes. For instance, whenever someone yelled out “Charlie Don’t Surf!” all I could think was, “Who the heck is Charlie?” 

By that afternoon, we were all back at the bar and I got to spend some girl time with Hayley. She was so kind to me and seemed to take a genuine interest in my life - or maybe she was just grateful not to be the only girl in the group anymore. She did tell me she thought Chris was extremely annoying, no matter where they were in the world - and even though Brodie was the quiet, sensible type for the most part, she hated how he acted when he was around the guys. Five beers later and Brodie was suddenly on his feet, doing some kind of native New Zealand war dance while Chris or Tyler vlogged. 

Although I was having such a wonderful time with the four of them, anticipating all the places in Vietnam Hayley said we were going, in the corner of my eye, I kept seeing the same strange man staring over at us. I thought maybe we were being too loud and he wanted to say something, but the man was instead looking at all of us with intrigue. Well, 10 minutes later, this very same man comes up to us with three strangers behind him. Very casually, he asks if we’re all having a good time. We kind of awkwardly oblige the man. A fellow traveller like us, who although was probably in his early thirties, looked more like a middle-aged dad on vacation - in an overly large Hawaiian shirt, as though to hide his stomach, and looking down at us through a pair of brainiac glasses. The strangers behind him were two other men and a young woman. One of the men was extremely hairy, with a beard almost as long as his own hair – while the other was very cleanly presented, short in height and holding a notepad. The young woman with them, who was not much older than myself, had a cool combination of dyed maroon hair and sleeve tattoos – although rather oddly, she was wearing way too much clothing for this climate. After some brief pleasantries, the man in the Hawaiian shirt then says, ‘I’m sorry to bother you folks, but I was wondering if we could ask you a few questions?’ 

Introducing himself as Aaron, the man tells us that he and his friends are documentary filmmakers, and were wanting to know what we knew of the local disappearances. Clueless as to what he was talking about, Aaron then sits down, without invitation at our rather small table, and starts explaining to us that for the past thirty years, tourists in the area have been mysteriously going missing without a trace. First time they were hearing of this, Tyler tells Aaron they have only been in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple of days. Since I was the one who lived and worked in the town, Hayley asks me if I knew anything of the missing tourists - and when she does, Aaron turns his full attention on me. Answering his many questions, I told Aaron I only heard in passing that tourists have allegedly gone missing, but wasn’t sure what to make of it. But while I’m telling him this, I notice the short guy behind him is writing everything I say down, word for word – before Aaron then asks me, with desperation in his voice, ‘Well, have you at least heard of the local legends?’  

Suddenly gaining an interest in what Aaron’s telling us, Tyler, Chris and Brodie drunkenly inquire, ‘Legends? What local legends?’ 

Taking another sip from his light beer, Aaron tells us that according to these legends, there are creatures lurking deep within the jungles and cave-systems of the region, and for centuries, local farmers or fishermen have only seen glimpses of them... Feeling as though we’re being told a scary bedtime story, Chris rather excitedly asks, ‘Well, what do these creatures look like?’ Aaron says the legends abbreviate and there are many claims to their appearance, but that they’re always described as being humanoid.   

Whatever these creatures were, paranormal communities and investigators have linked these legends to the disappearances of the tourists. All five of us realized just how silly this all sounded, which Brodie highlighted by saying, ‘You don’t actually believe that shite, do you?’ 

Without saying either yes or no, Aaron smirks at us, before revealing there are actually similar legends and sightings all around Central Vietnam – even by American soldiers as far back as the Vietnam War.  

‘You really don’t know about the cryptids of the Vietnam War?’ Aaron asks us, as though surprised we didn’t.  

Further educating us on this whole mystery, Aaron claims that during the war, several platoons and individual soldiers who were deployed in the jungles, came in contact with more than one type of creature.  

‘You never heard of the Rock Apes? The Devil Creatures of Quang Binh? The Big Yellows?’ 

If you were like us, and never heard of these creatures either, apparently what the American soldiers encountered in the jungles was a group of small Bigfoot-like creatures, that liked to throw rocks, and some sort of Lizard People, that glowed a luminous yellow and lived deep within the cave systems. 

Feeling somewhat ridiculous just listening to this, Tyler rather mockingly comments, ‘So, you’re saying you believe the reason for all the tourists going missing is because of Vietnamese Bigfoot and Lizard People?’ 

Aaron and his friends must have received this ridicule a lot, because rather than being insulted, they looked somewhat amused.  

‘Well, that’s why we’re here’ he says. ‘We’re paranormal investigators and filmmakers – and as far as we know, no one has tried to solve the mystery of the Vietnam Triangle. We’re in Biển Hứa Hẹn to interview locals on what they know of the disappearances, and we’ll follow any leads from there.’ 

Although I thought this all to be a little kooky, I tried to show a little respect and interest in what these guys did for a living – but not Tyler, Chris or Brodie. They were clearly trying to have fun at Aaron’s expense.  

‘So, what did the locals say? Is there a Vietnamese Loch Ness Monster we haven’t heard of?’  

Like I said, Aaron was well acquainted with this kind of ridicule, because rather spontaneously he replies, ‘Glad you asked!’ before gulping down the rest of his low-carb beer. ‘According to a group of fishermen we interviewed yesterday, there’s an unmapped trail that runs through the nearby jungles. Apparently, no one knows where this trail leads to - not even the locals do. And anyone who tries to find out for themselves... are never seen or heard from again.’ 

As amusing as we found these legends of ape-creatures and lizard-men, hearing there was a secret trail somewhere in the nearby jungles, where tourists are said to vanish - even if this was just a local legend... it was enough to unsettle all of us. Maybe there weren’t creatures abducting tourists in the jungles, but on an unmarked wilderness trail, anyone not familiar with the terrain could easily lose their way. Neither Tyler, Chris, Brodie or Hayley had a comment for this - after all, they were fellow travellers. As fun as their lifestyle was, they knew the dangers of venturing the more untamed corners of the world. The five of us just sat there, silently, not really knowing what to say, as Aaron very contentedly mused over us. 

‘We’re actually heading out tomorrow in search of the trail – we have directions and everything.’ Aaron then pauses on us... before he says, ‘If you guys don’t have any plans, why don’t you come along? After all, what’s the point of travelling if there ain’t a little danger involved?’  

Expecting someone in the group to tell him we already had plans, Tyler, Chris and Brodie share a look to one another - and to mine and Hayley’s surprise... they then agreed... Hayley obviously protested. She didn’t want to go gallivanting around the jungle where tourists supposedly vanished.  

‘Oh, come on Hayl’. It’ll be fun... Sarah? You’ll come, won’t you?’ 

‘Yeah. Johnny Utah wants to come, right?’  

Hayley stared at me, clearly desperate for me to take her side. I then glanced around the table to see so too was everyone else. Neither wanting to take sides or accept the invitation, all I could say was that I didn’t know what I wanted to do. 

Although Hayley and the guys were divided on whether or not to accompany Aaron’s expedition, it was ultimately left to a majority vote – and being too sheepish to protest, it now appeared our plans of travelling the country had changed to exploring the jungles of Central Vietnam... Even though I really didn’t want to go on this expedition – it could have been dangerous after all, I then reminded myself why I came to Vietnam in the first place... To have memorable and life changing experiences – and I wasn’t going to have any of that if I just said no when the opportunity arrived. Besides, tourists may well have gone missing in the region, but the supposed legends of jungle-dwelling creatures were probably nothing more than just stories. I spent my whole life believing in stories that turned out not to be true and I wasn’t going to let that continue now. 

Later that night, while Brodie and Hayley spent some alone time, and Chris was with Aaron’s friends (smoking you know what), Tyler invited me for a walk on the beach under the moonlight. Strolling barefoot along the beach, trying not to step on any garbage, Tyler asks me if I’m really ok with tomorrow’s plans – and that I shouldn’t feel peer-pressured into doing anything I didn’t really wanna do. I told him I was ok with it and that it should be fun.  

‘Don’t worry’ he said, ‘I’ll keep an eye on you.’ 

I’m a little embarrassed to admit this... but I kinda had a crush on Tyler. He was tall, handsome and adventurous. If anything, he was the sort of person I wanted to be: travelling the world and meeting all kinds of people from all kinds of places. I was a little worried he’d find me boring - a small city girl whose only other travel story was a premature mission to Florida. Well soon enough, I was going to have a whole new travel story... This travel story. 

We get up early the next morning, and meeting Aaron with his documentary crew, we each take separate taxis out of Biển Hứa Hẹn. Following the cab in front of us, we weren’t even sure where we were going exactly. Curving along a highway which cuts through a dense valley, Aaron’s taxi suddenly pulls up on the curve, where he and his team jump out to the beeping of angry motorcycle drivers. Flagging our taxi down, Aaron tells us that according to his directions, we have to cut through the valley here and head into the jungle. 

Although we didn’t really know what was going to happen on this trip – we were just along for the ride after all, Aaron’s plan was to hike through the jungle to find the mysterious trail, document whatever they could, and then move onto a group of cave-systems where these “creatures” were supposed to lurk. Reaching our way down the slope of the valley, we follow along a narrow stream which acted as our temporary trail. Although this was Aaron’s expedition, as soon as we start our hike through the jungle, Chris rather mockingly calls out, ‘Alright everyone. Keep a lookout for Lizard People, Bigfoot and Charlie’ where again, I thought to myself, “Who the heck is Charlie?”  ",1,1743199531.0,ChillingApp,1,1.0,False

Since the start I was introduced to their coffee liqueur whiskey which is sweet like candy, delicious but ultimately something I don't really buy. I'm here for the real whiskey after all.

They have a restaurant on site and was there earlier this evening. Took a peek in their gift shop and noticed something different besides their usual selection. 

I Saw a couple bottles that were just absolutely begging to be sampled.

The kind lady's working the shop allowed me a taste of each and was really impressed by the wheat whisky. Absolute winner in this release.

The rye is a great tasting choice as well at barrel strength, bit older and great for sipping. The wheat was doing it for me though.

These are both limited releases, and I believe no longer available in their web store and nearly OOS at their shop.

1jm6xxn,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1jm6xxn/what_to_do_in_this_situation/,what to do in this situation,"To give some context, I haven't seriously dated anyone in almost 5 years, since high school basically. But 3 months ago I met a girl I really liked on tinder (yeah it sucks, but i just moved to a new city due to college and this was the best way to meet someone).

I \[22M\] met her \[20F\] at the start/middle of january and we went on a first date after almost two weeks of talking due to both of us being decently busy at the time. We had an amazing time drinking cocktails, talking for almost 6h at which point I had to go as it was getting late and I didn't have any bus after 12pm. After 10ish days we went on a second date, drinks as well, again had a great time, planned a third date while on the second date which sadly didn't pan out as she had some stuff to do with her parents and after that she got sick pretty badly which made it impossible to meet up for almost a month.

As soon as she felt better we did go out again (this was a week ago), we went on a shorter coffee date on which she was visibly still not completely fine, was coughing still (which means she didn't lie about the fact that she was sick, which I was kinda concerned about). Few days before that she passed her drivers exam so she excitedly told me how she can't wait to get her drivers licence and come to my place to pick me up and drive around and told me that as she is finally better we can hang out more. I was happy as she obviously hints toward the fact that she is interested?

After a few days I asked her if I was taking things too slow (as we haven't kissed yet) and she responded that if anything was wrong that she would tell me and to just let things flow naturally.

I asked her to go out again on thursday but she declined as she said she felt obligated to spend a bit of time with her friends as she basically spent a month at home almost as if she was in quarantine but that we will arrange something. Now in a day it will be a week since the last time we went out, but she hasn't told me any day that she'd be fine with and the one I asked her about (monday) she said that she is not sure yet.

Now I know that this might be very paranoid and I might be overthinking hard but it just seems weird not seeing eachother for more than a week if we want to actually progress the relationship? I mean I am not asking to hang out every day, thats absolutely crazy, but I would just like to go out like once sometimes twice a week.

Should I tell her that? Or is it too early to ask for something like that. I mean 2.5 months already passed and everyone I asked for advice told me to drop her because she isnt engaging that much with me irl as in dates (we do text, not a huge amount, sometimes a conversation sparks but usually it's short or we just play word hunt) but none of them saw how interested she looks when we do meet up and how much she mentions hanging out/doing stuff together. Am I weird? Should I just give her more space? Even though I genuinely like her and would love to get into a relationship with her, but I also can't just drop that on her without even getting to a kiss/ spending more time together.

I hope any of this makes sense, english isn't my native language so I wouldn't be surprised if it feels disjointed

edit: she also said that she deleted tinder soon after going on a the first date with me. I deleted mine recently purely because I forgot I had it installed as I turned off notifications on it a long time ago. When I did open tinder our match didn't exist anymore so I am inclined to believe that she did actually delete the account as she said.",1,1743199374.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

Although most English teachers in South-East Asia use their leisure time to travel, I rather boringly decided to spend most of my days at the same beach, sat amongst the sand while I studied and practised what would hopefully become my second language. 

On one of those days, I must have been completely occupied in my own world, because when I look up, I suddenly see someone standing over, talking down to me. I take off my headphones, and shading the sun from my eyes, I see a tall, late-twenty-something tourist - wearing only swim shorts and cradling a surfboard beneath his arm. Having come in from the surf, he thought I said something to him as he passed by, where I then told him I was speaking Vietnamese to myself, and didn’t realize anyone could hear me. We both had a good laugh about it and the guy introduces himself as Tyler. Like me, Tyler was American, and unsurprisingly, he was from California. He came to Vietnam for no other reason than to surf. Like I said, Tyler was this tall, very tanned guy – like he was the tannest guy I had ever seen. He had all these different tattoos he acquired from his travels, and long brown hair, which he regularly wore in a man-bun. When I first saw him standing there, I was taken back a little, because I almost mistook him as Jesus Christ – that's what he looked like. Tyler asks what I’m doing in Vietnam and later in the conversation, he invites me to have a drink with him and his surfer buddies at the beach town bar. I was a little hesitant to say yes, only because I don’t really drink alcohol, but Tyler seemed like a nice guy and so I agreed.  

Later that day, I meet Tyler at the bar and he introduces me to his three surfer friends. The first of Tyler’s friends was Chris, who he knew from back home. Chris was kinda loud and a little obnoxious, but I suppose he was also funny. The other two friends were Brodie and Hayley - a couple from New Zealand. Tyler and Chris met them while surfing in Australia – and ever since, the four of them have been travelling, or more accurately, surfing the world together. Over a few drinks, we all get to know each other a little better and I told them what it’s like to teach English in Vietnam. Curious as to how they’re able to travel so much, I ask them what they all do for a living. Tyler says they work as vloggers, bloggers and general content creators, all the while travelling to a different country every other month. You wouldn’t believe the number of places they’ve been to: Hawaii, Costa Rica, Sri Lanka, Bali – everywhere! They didn’t see the value of staying in just one place and working a menial job, when they could be living their best lives, all the while being their own bosses. It did make a lot of sense to me, and was not that unsimilar to my reasoning for being in Vietnam.  

The four of them were only going to be in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple more days, but when I told them I hadn’t yet explored the rest of the country, they insisted that I tag along with them. I did come to Vietnam to travel, not just stay in one place – the only problem was I didn’t have anyone to do it with... But I guess now I did. They even invited me to go surfing with them the next day. Having never surfed a day in my life, I very nearly declined the offer, but coming all this way from cold and boring Utah, I knew I had to embrace new and exciting opportunities whenever they arrived. 

By early next morning, and pushing through my first hangover, I had officially surfed my first ever wave. I was a little afraid I’d embarrass myself – especially in front of Tyler, but after a few trials and errors, I thankfully gained the hang of it. Even though I was a newbie at surfing, I could not have been that bad, because as soon as I surf my first successful wave, Chris would not stop calling me “Johnny Utah” - not that I knew what that meant. If I wasn’t embarrassing myself on a board, I definitely was in my ignorance of the guys’ casual movie quotes. For instance, whenever someone yelled out “Charlie Don’t Surf!” all I could think was, “Who the heck is Charlie?” 

By that afternoon, we were all back at the bar and I got to spend some girl time with Hayley. She was so kind to me and seemed to take a genuine interest in my life - or maybe she was just grateful not to be the only girl in the group anymore. She did tell me she thought Chris was extremely annoying, no matter where they were in the world - and even though Brodie was the quiet, sensible type for the most part, she hated how he acted when he was around the guys. Five beers later and Brodie was suddenly on his feet, doing some kind of native New Zealand war dance while Chris or Tyler vlogged. 

Although I was having such a wonderful time with the four of them, anticipating all the places in Vietnam Hayley said we were going, in the corner of my eye, I kept seeing the same strange man staring over at us. I thought maybe we were being too loud and he wanted to say something, but the man was instead looking at all of us with intrigue. Well, 10 minutes later, this very same man comes up to us with three strangers behind him. Very casually, he asks if we’re all having a good time. We kind of awkwardly oblige the man. A fellow traveller like us, who although was probably in his early thirties, looked more like a middle-aged dad on vacation - in an overly large Hawaiian shirt, as though to hide his stomach, and looking down at us through a pair of brainiac glasses. The strangers behind him were two other men and a young woman. One of the men was extremely hairy, with a beard almost as long as his own hair – while the other was very cleanly presented, short in height and holding a notepad. The young woman with them, who was not much older than myself, had a cool combination of dyed maroon hair and sleeve tattoos – although rather oddly, she was wearing way too much clothing for this climate. After some brief pleasantries, the man in the Hawaiian shirt then says, ‘I’m sorry to bother you folks, but I was wondering if we could ask you a few questions?’ 

Introducing himself as Aaron, the man tells us that he and his friends are documentary filmmakers, and were wanting to know what we knew of the local disappearances. Clueless as to what he was talking about, Aaron then sits down, without invitation at our rather small table, and starts explaining to us that for the past thirty years, tourists in the area have been mysteriously going missing without a trace. First time they were hearing of this, Tyler tells Aaron they have only been in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple of days. Since I was the one who lived and worked in the town, Hayley asks me if I knew anything of the missing tourists - and when she does, Aaron turns his full attention on me. Answering his many questions, I told Aaron I only heard in passing that tourists have allegedly gone missing, but wasn’t sure what to make of it. But while I’m telling him this, I notice the short guy behind him is writing everything I say down, word for word – before Aaron then asks me, with desperation in his voice, ‘Well, have you at least heard of the local legends?’  

Suddenly gaining an interest in what Aaron’s telling us, Tyler, Chris and Brodie drunkenly inquire, ‘Legends? What local legends?’ 

Taking another sip from his light beer, Aaron tells us that according to these legends, there are creatures lurking deep within the jungles and cave-systems of the region, and for centuries, local farmers or fishermen have only seen glimpses of them... Feeling as though we’re being told a scary bedtime story, Chris rather excitedly asks, ‘Well, what do these creatures look like?’ Aaron says the legends abbreviate and there are many claims to their appearance, but that they’re always described as being humanoid.   

Whatever these creatures were, paranormal communities and investigators have linked these legends to the disappearances of the tourists. All five of us realized just how silly this all sounded, which Brodie highlighted by saying, ‘You don’t actually believe that shite, do you?’ 

Without saying either yes or no, Aaron smirks at us, before revealing there are actually similar legends and sightings all around Central Vietnam – even by American soldiers as far back as the Vietnam War.  

‘You really don’t know about the cryptids of the Vietnam War?’ Aaron asks us, as though surprised we didn’t.  

Further educating us on this whole mystery, Aaron claims that during the war, several platoons and individual soldiers who were deployed in the jungles, came in contact with more than one type of creature.  

‘You never heard of the Rock Apes? The Devil Creatures of Quang Binh? The Big Yellows?’ 

If you were like us, and never heard of these creatures either, apparently what the American soldiers encountered in the jungles was a group of small Bigfoot-like creatures, that liked to throw rocks, and some sort of Lizard People, that glowed a luminous yellow and lived deep within the cave systems. 

Feeling somewhat ridiculous just listening to this, Tyler rather mockingly comments, ‘So, you’re saying you believe the reason for all the tourists going missing is because of Vietnamese Bigfoot and Lizard People?’ 

Aaron and his friends must have received this ridicule a lot, because rather than being insulted, they looked somewhat amused.  

‘Well, that’s why we’re here’ he says. ‘We’re paranormal investigators and filmmakers – and as far as we know, no one has tried to solve the mystery of the Vietnam Triangle. We’re in Biển Hứa Hẹn to interview locals on what they know of the disappearances, and we’ll follow any leads from there.’ 

Although I thought this all to be a little kooky, I tried to show a little respect and interest in what these guys did for a living – but not Tyler, Chris or Brodie. They were clearly trying to have fun at Aaron’s expense.  

‘So, what did the locals say? Is there a Vietnamese Loch Ness Monster we haven’t heard of?’  

Like I said, Aaron was well acquainted with this kind of ridicule, because rather spontaneously he replies, ‘Glad you asked!’ before gulping down the rest of his low-carb beer. ‘According to a group of fishermen we interviewed yesterday, there’s an unmapped trail that runs through the nearby jungles. Apparently, no one knows where this trail leads to - not even the locals do. And anyone who tries to find out for themselves... are never seen or heard from again.’ 

As amusing as we found these legends of ape-creatures and lizard-men, hearing there was a secret trail somewhere in the nearby jungles, where tourists are said to vanish - even if this was just a local legend... it was enough to unsettle all of us. Maybe there weren’t creatures abducting tourists in the jungles, but on an unmarked wilderness trail, anyone not familiar with the terrain could easily lose their way. Neither Tyler, Chris, Brodie or Hayley had a comment for this - after all, they were fellow travellers. As fun as their lifestyle was, they knew the dangers of venturing the more untamed corners of the world. The five of us just sat there, silently, not really knowing what to say, as Aaron very contentedly mused over us. 

‘We’re actually heading out tomorrow in search of the trail – we have directions and everything.’ Aaron then pauses on us... before he says, ‘If you guys don’t have any plans, why don’t you come along? After all, what’s the point of travelling if there ain’t a little danger involved?’  

Expecting someone in the group to tell him we already had plans, Tyler, Chris and Brodie share a look to one another - and to mine and Hayley’s surprise... they then agreed... Hayley obviously protested. She didn’t want to go gallivanting around the jungle where tourists supposedly vanished.  

‘Oh, come on Hayl’. It’ll be fun... Sarah? You’ll come, won’t you?’ 

‘Yeah. Johnny Utah wants to come, right?’  

Hayley stared at me, clearly desperate for me to take her side. I then glanced around the table to see so too was everyone else. Neither wanting to take sides or accept the invitation, all I could say was that I didn’t know what I wanted to do. 

Although Hayley and the guys were divided on whether or not to accompany Aaron’s expedition, it was ultimately left to a majority vote – and being too sheepish to protest, it now appeared our plans of travelling the country had changed to exploring the jungles of Central Vietnam... Even though I really didn’t want to go on this expedition – it could have been dangerous after all, I then reminded myself why I came to Vietnam in the first place... To have memorable and life changing experiences – and I wasn’t going to have any of that if I just said no when the opportunity arrived. Besides, tourists may well have gone missing in the region, but the supposed legends of jungle-dwelling creatures were probably nothing more than just stories. I spent my whole life believing in stories that turned out not to be true and I wasn’t going to let that continue now. 

Later that night, while Brodie and Hayley spent some alone time, and Chris was with Aaron’s friends (smoking you know what), Tyler invited me for a walk on the beach under the moonlight. Strolling barefoot along the beach, trying not to step on any garbage, Tyler asks me if I’m really ok with tomorrow’s plans – and that I shouldn’t feel peer-pressured into doing anything I didn’t really wanna do. I told him I was ok with it and that it should be fun.  

‘Don’t worry’ he said, ‘I’ll keep an eye on you.’ 

I’m a little embarrassed to admit this... but I kinda had a crush on Tyler. He was tall, handsome and adventurous. If anything, he was the sort of person I wanted to be: travelling the world and meeting all kinds of people from all kinds of places. I was a little worried he’d find me boring - a small city girl whose only other travel story was a premature mission to Florida. Well soon enough, I was going to have a whole new travel story... This travel story. 

We get up early the next morning, and meeting Aaron with his documentary crew, we each take separate taxis out of Biển Hứa Hẹn. Following the cab in front of us, we weren’t even sure where we were going exactly. Curving along a highway which cuts through a dense valley, Aaron’s taxi suddenly pulls up on the curve, where he and his team jump out to the beeping of angry motorcycle drivers. Flagging our taxi down, Aaron tells us that according to his directions, we have to cut through the valley here and head into the jungle. 

Although we didn’t really know what was going to happen on this trip – we were just along for the ride after all, Aaron’s plan was to hike through the jungle to find the mysterious trail, document whatever they could, and then move onto a group of cave-systems where these “creatures” were supposed to lurk. Reaching our way down the slope of the valley, we follow along a narrow stream which acted as our temporary trail. Although this was Aaron’s expedition, as soon as we start our hike through the jungle, Chris rather mockingly calls out, ‘Alright everyone. Keep a lookout for Lizard People, Bigfoot and Charlie’ where again, I thought to myself, “Who the heck is Charlie?”  ",1,1743199254.0,cant_sleep,1,1.0,False

>Bad coffee is the stuff you make a full pot of on the weekends just in case some friends stop by. It's what you sip when you're alone at the mechanic's shop getting your oil change, thinking about where your life has taken you; what you nurse as you wait for a loved one to get through a tough surgery. It's the Sanka you share with an elderly great aunt while listening to her tell stories you've heard a thousand times before. Bad coffee is there for you. It is bottomless. It is perfect.

I (F38) live 3 hours drive from my Mom (F65). We have....a tumultuous relationship. Periods when we are on good or bad terms. Right now... it's good. We speak at least once a week and see each other every couple of months.

Now, I am super busy with work and I have not visited her since Christmas. She has had surgery recently and has her one remaining elderly relative visiting so I know would like me to visit her. I am so stressed with work: I am doing 8 days a week; so I up my calls but  can't promise her a visit.

So.... 3 weeks ago I get this invitation to a school reunion, so obviously near my Mom. 

I feel very mixed emotions about going, so I don't tell anyone about it. I do some thinking and I say to my partner can we go? This is 2 days before. He knows me, my past and know last minute things mean many days/weeks of stress-thinking.

He (M40) says ""Sure let's do it, I'll be your wingman, you'll be fine"".

We drive down and I think ""Perfect I'll call in on my Mom and check in on her. See if she needs anything.""

I call her, but no answer - this is typical. But she usually calls back same day.

I get there. She's not in. ""That's fine,"" I think, ""she'll call me later and I can tell her I'm in town"".

I go to the reunion, it's weird but healing.

I go to sleep... because I, like all humans, sleep.

Next morning, I'm making coffee when  she calls. But, I call straight back.

OP: ""Hey Mom, how are you? I'm in town do you want me to come over?""

OP's Mom: Silence.

OP's Mom: ""What?!""

OP : ""I'm in town""

OP's Mom: ""Unbelievable OP. I am disgusted with you.  You are a miserable person.""

She goes on.

OP's Mom: ""Communication is essential.  I  am good with your brother, we had a great conversation last week. He is so caring.

But, You, I don't know! 

You have spoilt my day.

Get... a... grip.""

She put the phone down.

Now, I know my communication was not the best, but AITA here? Why bring in my brother? And did I deserve that? Would your parent(s) freak if you showed up unannounced?

I Will Never Step Foot Inside a Jungle Again - Part 1 of 2,"My name is Sarah Branch. A few years ago, when I was 24 years old, I had left my home state of Utah and moved abroad to work as an English language teacher in Vietnam. Having just graduated BYU and earning my degree in teaching, I suddenly realized I needed so much more from my life. I always wanted to travel, embrace other cultures, and most of all, have memorable and life-changing experiences.  

Feeling trapped in my normal, everyday life outside of Salt Lake City, where winters are cold and summers always far away, I decided I was no longer going to live the life that others had chosen for me, and instead choose my own path in life – a life of fulfilment and little regrets. Already attaining my degree in teaching, I realized if I gained a further ESL Certification (teaching English as a second language), I could finally achieve my lifelong dream of travelling the world to far-away and exotic places – all the while working for a reasonable income. 

There were so many places I dreamed of going – maybe somewhere in South America or far east Asia. As long as the weather was warm and there were beautiful beaches for me to soak up the sun, I honestly did not mind. Scanning my finger over a map of the world, rotating from one hemisphere to the other, I eventually put my finger down on a narrow, little country called Vietnam. This was by no means a random choice. I had always wanted to travel to Vietnam because... I’m actually one-quarter Vietnamese. Not that you can tell or anything - my hair is brown and my skin is rather fair. But I figured, if I wanted to go where the sun was always shining, and there was an endless supply of tropical beaches, Vietnam would be the perfect destination! Furthermore, I’d finally get the chance to explore my heritage. 

Fortunately enough for me, it turned out Vietnam had a huge demand for English language teachers. They did prefer it if you were teaching in the country already - but after a few online interviews and some Visa complications later, I packed up my things in Utah and moved across the world to the Land of the Blue Dragon.  

I was relocated to a beautiful beach town in Central Vietnam, right along the coast of the South China Sea. English teachers don’t really get to choose where in the country they end up, but if I did have that option, I could not have picked a more perfect place... Because of the horrific turn this story will take, I can’t say where exactly it was in Central Vietnam I lived, or even the name of the beach town I resided in - just because I don’t want anyone to get the wrong idea. This part of Vietnam is a truly beautiful place and I don’t want to discourage anyone from going there. So, for the continuation of this story, I’m just going to refer to where I was as Central Vietnam – and as for the beach town where I made my living, I’m going to give it the pseudonym “Biển Hứa Hẹn” - which in Vietnamese, roughly, but rather fittingly translates to “Sea of Promise.”   

Biển Hứa Hẹn truly was the most perfect destination! It was a modest sized coastal town, nestled inside of a tropical bay, with the whitest sands and clearest blue waters you could possibly dream of. The town itself is also spectacular. Most of the houses and buildings are painted a vibrant sunny yellow, not only to look more inviting to tourists, but so to reflect the sun during the hottest months. For this reason, I originally wanted to give the town the nickname “Trấn Màu Vàng” (Yellow Town), but I quickly realized how insensitive that pseudonym would have been – so “Sea of Promise” it is!  

Alongside its bright, sunny buildings, Biển Hứa Hẹn has the most stunning oriental and French Colonial architecture – interspersed with many quality restaurants and coffee shops. The local cuisine is to die for! Not only is it healthy and delicious, but it's also surprisingly cheap – like we’re only talking 90 cents! You wouldn’t believe how many different flavours of Coffee Vietnam has. I mean, I went a whole 24 years without even trying coffee, and since I’ve been here, I must have tried around two-dozen flavours. Another whimsy little aspect of this town is the many multi-coloured, little plastic chairs that are dispersed everywhere. So whether it was dining on the local cuisine or trying my twenty-second flavour of coffee, I would always find one of these chairs – a different colour every time, sit down in the shade and just watch the world go by. 

I haven’t even mentioned how much I loved my teaching job. My classes were the most adorable 7 and 8 year-olds, and my colleagues were so nice and welcoming. They never called me by my first name. Instead my colleagues would always say “Chào em” or “Chào em gái”, which basically means “Hello little sister.”  

When I wasn’t teaching or grading papers, I spent most of my leisure time by the town’s beach - and being the boring, vanilla person I am, I didn’t really do much. Feeling the sun upon my skin while I observed the breath-taking scenery was more than enough – either that or I was curled up in a good book... I was never the only foreigner on this beach. Biển Hứa Hẹn is a popular tourist destination – mostly Western backpackers and surfers. So, if I wasn’t turning pink beneath the sun or memorizing every little detail of the bay’s geography, I would enviously spectate fellow travellers ride the waves. 

As much as I love Vietnam - as much as I love Biển Hứa Hẹn, what really spoils this place from being the perfect paradise is all the garbage pollution. I mean, it’s just everywhere. There is garbage in the town, on the beach and even in the ocean – and if it isn’t the garbage that spoils everything, it certainly is all the rats, cockroaches and other vermin brought with it. Biển Hứa Hẹn is such a unique place and it honestly makes me so mad that no one does anything about it... Nevertheless, I still love it here. It will always be a paradise to me – and if America was the Promised Land for Lehi and his descendants, then this was going to be my Promised Land.  

I had now been living in Biển Hứa Hẹn for 4 months, and although I had only 3 months left in my teaching contract, I still planned on staying in Vietnam - even if that meant leaving this region I’d fallen in love with and relocating to another part of the country. Since I was going to stay, I decided I really needed to learn Vietnamese – as you’d be surprised how few people there are in Vietnam who can speak any to no English. Although most English teachers in South-East Asia use their leisure time to travel, I rather boringly decided to spend most of my days at the same beach, sat amongst the sand while I studied and practised what would hopefully become my second language. 

On one of those days, I must have been completely occupied in my own world, because when I look up, I suddenly see someone standing over, talking down to me.

Feeling as though we’re being told a scary bedtime story, Chris rather excitedly asks, ‘Well, what do these creatures look like?’ Aaron says the legends abbreviate and there are many claims to their appearance, but that they’re always described as being humanoid.   

Whatever these creatures were, paranormal communities and investigators have linked these legends to the disappearances of the tourists. All five of us realized just how silly this all sounded, which Brodie highlighted by saying, ‘You don’t actually believe that shite, do you?’ 

Without saying either yes or no, Aaron smirks at us, before revealing there are actually similar legends and sightings all around Central Vietnam – even by American soldiers as far back as the Vietnam War.  

‘You really don’t know about the cryptids of the Vietnam War?’ Aaron asks us, as though surprised we didn’t.  

Further educating us on this whole mystery, Aaron claims that during the war, several platoons and individual soldiers who were deployed in the jungles, came in contact with more than one type of creature.  

‘You never heard of the Rock Apes? The Devil Creatures of Quang Binh? The Big Yellows?’ 

If you were like us, and never heard of these creatures either, apparently what the American soldiers encountered in the jungles was a group of small Bigfoot-like creatures, that liked to throw rocks, and some sort of Lizard People, that glowed a luminous yellow and lived deep within the cave systems. 

Feeling somewhat ridiculous just listening to this, Tyler rather mockingly comments, ‘So, you’re saying you believe the reason for all the tourists going missing is because of Vietnamese Bigfoot and Lizard People?’ 

Aaron and his friends must have received this ridicule a lot, because rather than being insulted, they looked somewhat amused.  

‘Well, that’s why we’re here’ he says. ‘We’re paranormal investigators and filmmakers – and as far as we know, no one has tried to solve the mystery of the Vietnam Triangle. We’re in Biển Hứa Hẹn to interview locals on what they know of the disappearances, and we’ll follow any leads from there.’ 

Although I thought this all to be a little kooky, I tried to show a little respect and interest in what these guys did for a living – but not Tyler, Chris or Brodie. They were clearly trying to have fun at Aaron’s expense.  

‘So, what did the locals say? Is there a Vietnamese Loch Ness Monster we haven’t heard of?’  

Like I said, Aaron was well acquainted with this kind of ridicule, because rather spontaneously he replies, ‘Glad you asked!’ before gulping down the rest of his low-carb beer. ‘According to a group of fishermen we interviewed yesterday, there’s an unmapped trail that runs through the nearby jungles. Apparently, no one knows where this trail leads to - not even the locals do. And anyone who tries to find out for themselves... are never seen or heard from again.’ 

As amusing as we found these legends of ape-creatures and lizard-men, hearing there was a secret trail somewhere in the nearby jungles, where tourists are said to vanish - even if this was just a local legend... it was enough to unsettle all of us. Maybe there weren’t creatures abducting tourists in the jungles, but on an unmarked wilderness trail, anyone not familiar with the terrain could easily lose their way. Neither Tyler, Chris, Brodie or Hayley had a comment for this - after all, they were fellow travellers. As fun as their lifestyle was, they knew the dangers of venturing the more untamed corners of the world. The five of us just sat there, silently, not really knowing what to say, as Aaron very contentedly mused over us. 

‘We’re actually heading out tomorrow in search of the trail – we have directions and everything.’ Aaron then pauses on us... before he says, ‘If you guys don’t have any plans, why don’t you come along? After all, what’s the point of travelling if there ain’t a little danger involved?’  

Expecting someone in the group to tell him we already had plans, Tyler, Chris and Brodie share a look to one another - and to mine and Hayley’s surprise... they then agreed... Hayley obviously protested. She didn’t want to go gallivanting around the jungle where tourists supposedly vanished.  

‘Oh, come on Hayl’. It’ll be fun... Sarah? You’ll come, won’t you?’ 

‘Yeah. Johnny Utah wants to come, right?’  

Hayley stared at me, clearly desperate for me to take her side. I then glanced around the table to see so too was everyone else. Neither wanting to take sides or accept the invitation, all I could say was that I didn’t know what I wanted to do. 

Although Hayley and the guys were divided on whether or not to accompany Aaron’s expedition, it was ultimately left to a majority vote – and being too sheepish to protest, it now appeared our plans of travelling the country had changed to exploring the jungles of Central Vietnam... Even though I really didn’t want to go on this expedition – it could have been dangerous after all, I then reminded myself why I came to Vietnam in the first place... To have memorable and life changing experiences – and I wasn’t going to have any of that if I just said no when the opportunity arrived. Besides, tourists may well have gone missing in the region, but the supposed legends of jungle-dwelling creatures were probably nothing more than just stories. I spent my whole life believing in stories that turned out not to be true and I wasn’t going to let that continue now. 

Later that night, while Brodie and Hayley spent some alone time, and Chris was with Aaron’s friends (smoking you know what), Tyler invited me for a walk on the beach under the moonlight. Strolling barefoot along the beach, trying not to step on any garbage, Tyler asks me if I’m really ok with tomorrow’s plans – and that I shouldn’t feel peer-pressured into doing anything I didn’t really wanna do. I told him I was ok with it and that it should be fun.  

‘Don’t worry’ he said, ‘I’ll keep an eye on you.’ 

I’m a little embarrassed to admit this... but I kinda had a crush on Tyler. He was tall, handsome and adventurous. If anything, he was the sort of person I wanted to be: travelling the world and meeting all kinds of people from all kinds of places. I was a little worried he’d find me boring - a small city girl whose only other travel story was a premature mission to Florida. Well soon enough, I was going to have a whole new travel story... This travel story. 

We get up early the next morning, and meeting Aaron with his documentary crew, we each take separate taxis out of Biển Hứa Hẹn. Following the cab in front of us, we weren’t even sure where we were going exactly. Curving along a highway which cuts through a dense valley, Aaron’s taxi suddenly pulls up on the curve, where he and his team jump out to the beeping of angry motorcycle drivers. Flagging our taxi down, Aaron tells us that according to his directions, we have to cut through the valley here and head into the jungle. 

Although we didn’t really know what was going to happen on this trip – we were just along for the ride after all, Aaron’s plan was to hike through the jungle to find the mysterious trail, document whatever they could, and then move onto a group of cave-systems where these “creatures” were supposed to lurk. Reaching our way down the slope of the valley, we follow along a narrow stream which acted as our temporary trail. Although this was Aaron’s expedition, as soon as we start our hike through the jungle, Chris rather mockingly calls out, ‘Alright everyone. Keep a lookout for Lizard People, Bigfoot and Charlie’ where again, I thought to myself, “Who the heck is Charlie?”  ",1,1743198972.0,BeingScaredStories,1,1.0,False

1jm6rgm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Manifestation/comments/1jm6rgm/is_the_law_of_assumption_the_biggest_lie_or_the/,Is the Law of Assumption the Biggest Lie or the Key to Life?,"Hey everyone, wanted to open this topic to discuss the Law.

First off, I am new to Law of Assumption, and from consuming content, we can all agree that the basics to applying the law is assuming something is true will harden into fact if persisted on ( not talking about techniques, but the mechanism i.e. Assumption when persisted in will harden into fact, wheter you get to that point with techniques or just by deciding doesn't matter to me).

Now, a couple questions I as a newbie have when it comes to the law that make me doubt it, so that's why I am asking everyone to comment their thoughts ( i'd appreciate if they came from people who actually manifested the stuff they wanted not coffee, shirt or whatever but ""Big"" stuff, house, money, love, health, and that they know for a fact it came as a result of applying these teachings )

I'll just list the questions as they come to mind no particular order :

1. If the law works 100% of the time, why does 80-90% of this subreddit or any other community for that matter fail constantly after ""applying"" the law. (I know someone can say ""Oh, but maybe they're not applying it consistently, maybe they're constantly 3d checking, they think as if they have it but still are aware of not having it in 3d and so on"" is it really just this or?
2. Talent show funny clips are filled with ""delusional"" people thinking they can perform arts, sing, draw, dance whatever, once instance comes to mind is when there's this guy who is objectively awful at singing but says to the judges that he is better then them, knows how to sing etc, but he never gotten to a point where it hardened into fact, what's wrong here? I mean clearly they're persisting in the fact that they know how to do xyz, and this is not just talent related, there's tons of people in our everyday life claiming XYZ but it never happens?

3. When it comes to taking action, from what I understand, your only job is to live in the end and everything that needs to happen will happen in order to bring your desire to you, wheter it's you taking action (action that you'll take that will take you to your desire without you being aware that it's taking you there, you'll be able to connect the dots only after the 3d conformed completely) , getting an idea, or whatever else, is this true or not?

4. How can someone design an ""experiment"", where they can 100% without fail every single time so they can know none of the results were coincidences and prove to themselves that the law is absolutely real, what things made you convinced that it's real.

5. Has anyone in here manifested material success such as wealth or knows someone that used the law and that the use of the law is 100% what caused them to become wealthy ( i.e. millions of dollars, multiple 7,8,9+ figures net worth. I mean from the premise of the law every billionaire got there because of the law wheter conciously or unconciously applying it, but I am interested in someone who did it conciously, do you know such people or have done it yourself?

6. When it comes to physical appearance, some people say they grew in height, changed eye colors, changed the way their face completely looks. I've seen a couple of these posts especially when it comes to people reversing the age they look or facial changes, but honestly i've not seen much difference in the before and after photos, or the ""wow you're 60, can't believe you look like 30"" moments, it was mostly yeah you definetly look close to 60 for example, rather then looking the age ""they assume they're"". 

Not to bash anyone, just curious what's going on here, I personally as a newbie would love to know that the law is 100% real so that I can change stuff in my life, but I'd like to know the answers to these questions. Oh and one funny thing that made me ""kind of doubt"" the law is just the sheer amount of coaches on YouTube whose ""how"" & ""when"" to manifesting money is selling LoAss content just made me feel a certain way and doubt it, but I am open to every comment & would love to personally know that the law is real.",1,1743198908.0,Manifestation,1,1.0,False

1jm6q1l,https://www.reddit.com/r/SMG4/comments/1jm6q1l/nexus_au_overview_trivia/,Nexus AU Overview & Trivia,"Now that the main story of Taking Flight has reached 71 chapters (plus side stories), I wanted to take the time to give a bit of an overview of this AU I've been building for a while now. I'll mostly be going over what this AU is about, how I've been handling the story, how it compares and contrasts to canon, how things have been coming along, and what I hope to accomplish moving forward, plus some pieces of trivia about characters, places, and worldbuilding. There will be minor spoilers, but nothing too serious. 

Now, LETS A GO! 

1. This AU technically began with my fan made episode ""FSG5: Food Wars 2, The Second Course."" 

2. Worldbuilding is gonna be a central pillar of this AU. I'm treating the world of SMG4 as........ well, a world, and I wanna flesh out the main setting in ways that haven't been shown before in order to tell a more engaging story without sacrificing too much of the show's meme-ness and meta humor. 

3. Knowing where your AU begins to differentiate from Canon is crucial to avoid confusion while opening up more possibilities for where you take your story. Irefer to this point as the CDP (Canonical Divergence Point), which refers to the point where an AU begins to diverge from official Canon. Everything we see in episodes leading up to the CDP still happened in this AU, and everything that happens AFTER that point is now subject to change. For example, the Nexus AU's CDP is the episode ""The Day My Arm Went Psycho,"" meaning everything we see happen in the series before and during that episode's debut still happened in this AU, whereas events that occur AFTER the episode is now subject to change. 

4. My previous thesis on the Protomeme Theory will play a role on the worldbuilding side of things. If you don't know what I'm talking about, the Protomeme Theory is a thesis I wrote back in 2021, when the Genesis arc was still going on. The theory is that Memes as we see them today have actually existed since the dawn of cultural exchange, and that many ancient deities from various cultures were actually the Memes of their time. The reason these ""Protomemes"" aren't around anymore is because they became ""unpopular,"" resulting in them turning into Dead Memes, Corrupted Memes, and finally Antimemes that were sealed away in the darkest depths of reality. The initial theory also stated that the God Box didn't exist at the time since it and the internet Graveyard were created AFTER the advent of the internet, meaning these ancient antimemes were locked up somewhere else. Where that is........ you'll have to wait and see. 

5. On the topic of Genesis and Revelations, I've also expanded upon the concept of Meme Energy as the lifeblood of the universe. In this AU, Tari discovers the power of Meta, a type of refined Meme Energy tied to the Metarunners, an ancient civilization that plays a massive role in Taking Flight's story. The Void from Warframe and the Ascendant Plane from Destiny are also present in this AU and are also closely tied to Meme Energy. 

6. While this is primarily a written story, I have put plenty of thought into what the character models would look like if it were ever to be animated in GMod or SFM. Recolors like Minion, X, and FM now have their own redesigned models just like SMG4 and SMG3. Same goes for the rest of the recolors and characters that are just Nintendo Characters with different names slapped onto them. Tari and Meggy also have newer designs with more even proportions like we see with Melony and Saiko. 

7. There's a popular fan theory that Whisk's mother from Sunset Paradise is actually Karen, and I included this dynamic in Whisk's first proper visit in the Showgrounds. Whisk is also now a student at Omnia Academy, having joined both the Ninja Club and the Archaeology Club. I also wanna include aspects of the ongoing story arc with Karen in the official show, but I'll need to hold off until the current saga runs its course as of the time I'm writing this. 

8. On the topic of Omnia Academy, SMG1 and SMG2 are still the heads of the Meme Research Club. Matt and Hank Hill are also still the heads of the Coaching and Ninja clubs respectively. The head of the Archaeology Club is Purah as she appeared in LOZ: Tears Of The Kingdom. 

9. Characters from other GLITCH series are also present in the Nexus AU, but in ways that are different from their GLITCH counterparts like Tari is. Murder Drones characters like Uzi now look human/human-like, and characters from The Amazing Digital Circus have a more ""anime"" vibe to their designs while not straying too far from their original designs. And before you ask, yes, I do plan on including characters from The Gaslight District and Knights Of Guinevere. Much like with the current Karen arc, I'm currently holding off on that until more teasers and/or the pilots come out in order to have a solid idea on how to incorporate those characters into the story. 

10. Besides GLITCH Characters, I've also included notable names from other GMod series. I had Soldine make his debut in the Cave Adventure Arc, along with some TF2 Merc OCs of my own making such as Rufus Mason, Edward Marston, Pietro Sterling, Theodore Potman, Tödliche Heilung, May, Ivan, Garnet, and so on. Doctor Lalve's Anti Spook Squad from his Spooktacular series. Have also made an appearance in the ""They Came From Below"" arc, and I have some plans to include freaks from other series like Australium Assault and The Lost Ones at some point.

11. The character Rhode is supposed to be a Xelor from the Dofus/Wakfu/Waves series of games and shows. He has clear inspirations from Nox from the Wakfu Season 1, but also other Xelor OCs. He's also Melony's new personal antagonist in this AU because of the events that transpired in the Maritime Mayhem arc. 

12. Wario has fallen into alcoholism after the disappearance of Waluigi. 

13. Unlike Meggy, Melony is an amazing chef. She and Kaizo are usually the ones who make food for the Anti Crew. 

14. Tari has since moved out of her home in Onnett and now lives with Saiko in her apartment. 

15. Tari's job at the zoo was unfortunately short lived. She didn't quit or get fired. The animals just rebelled and took over the zoo after killing all the workers. Tari was spared because of how nice she was, and she still visits them whenever she gets the chance. 

16. Saiko works at a little guitar shop in Mushroom City. 

17. N, J, and V now go by the names Noah, Julia, and Vale. They're also siblings in this AU, along with a mute version of Cyn who isn't as evil as she was in Murder Drones. Noah and Cyn are the naive little siblings, Julia is the stuck up oldest sibling, and poor Vale is the clinically depressed middle child. They are all currently under the employment and care of Miss Mildenhall. 

18. The mortal coil is what ties a soul to the body. If someone dies, they can technically still be saved until the mortal coil is severed. The window of opportunity for revival varies depending on the individual's age and the condition of their body. The mortal coil will snap a short time after death, and once it does, the person can no longer be revived. 

19. One-ups don't resurrect people. They just heal all wounds, which could come in handy if one's mortal coil hasn't been severed yet. 

20. After death, a soul will pass into the afterlife to go through the process of reincarnation. Interrupting this process is possible, but extremely I'll advised. 

21. The TADC cast are all Lost Souls, which are souls that inhabit metaphysical bodies sustained by the resonance of old memories. Losing ones memory can lead to the body ""abstracting"" into an unrecognizable beast like form. Caine and his brother Aybel formed the Circus to build a community where Lost Souls can form new bonds and thus stave off Abstraction. 

22. Resonance is the connection a soul can form with other things such as people, objects, places, and events. Strong resonance is usually a sign of an exceptionally close bond. 

23. Three's Coffee and Bombs has been upgraded into Three's Lustrous Lair, which now includes a bar and diner. Melony and Kaizo work there as cooks. 

24. Miss Martha Mildenhall is a Boo in this AU, with a design heavily inspired by the works of ShadowScarKnight on DeviantArt. She's a savvy business woman with plenty of connections, which is how she got the job of Manager at Three's Lustrous Lair. 

25. In this AU, Marty and Mario escaped prison together after the events of WOTFI 23, so Marty hasn't turned evil.......... yet. 

26: Meggy has actual plot armor and a s***ton of PTSD. SMG3 hosts regular therapy sessions with her. 

27. Boopkins is the grandson of Hastur, the King in Yellow. This technically makes him a demigod. 

And that's it for the time being. If you have any more questions about this AU, feel free to ask.

Hi! I’m Stephanie. I’m 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection. I’d like to find someone I can confide in, get to know on a personal level, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older(28+). Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don’t have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I’d be okay with it if there was some flirting involved, but I’m not looking for anything very sexual. If your post history is mostly or completely nsfw, we likely won’t jive. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I have a dog that I love very much 
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health
*[This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/OxamSqG)

That’s just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages.

1jm6ggt,https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/1jm6ggt/chase_centers_bag_policy/,Chase Center's Bag Policy,"Went to Chase Center last night, taking Caltrain from Sunnyvale.

I read their bag policy and I measured my bag carefully to ensure that it was smaller than 14"" x 14"" x 6"" (it was 14"" x 10.5"" x 4""). The first line I went in, the bag checker was pretty rude and then grudgingly said, ""you're lucky, it just fit,"" she was clearly disappointed that she could not turn me away.

I had an empty travel coffee mug in the bag, that I had used on Caltrain on the way up. Oops, my fault. I had only read the food and beverage policy of: ""Chase Center does not allow for outside food or beverage to be brought into the arena,"" but I had not read the prohibited items section that stated: ""Refillable water bottles/cups"" were prohibited. They obviously don't want anyone drinking free tap water! They told me to put the mug in my car (which was parked in Sunnyvale). Then they said I could check the mug at bag check, which would have cost $10 for a used mug that cost about $12, I went to the bag check, where the person in front of me was livid that she could not take her empty stainless water bottle into the event. In the end I left the mug outside the venue by some plants, thinking that it would be unlikely that anyone steal a used mug.

I got back in a different line and this time the bag checker was concerned that the bag looked like a laptop bag, which it was (laptop computers and tablets are not allowed), but there was no laptop inside, only my phone, some ibuprofen, a charger, a cable, and some tissues. He was polite and called a supervisor to check if it was okay, and it was.

I think if it had been a vertical bag like [amazon.com/dp/B0CHYC8HQ2](http://amazon.com/dp/B0CHYC8HQ2) which looks more like a man purse it might have been better. Also, any bag can't have straps that make it into a backpack, since those are prohibited. It's very hard to find a stadium-size bag that isn't one of those clear bags.

The mug was still there after the event.

## Why Choose Reusable Nespresso Capsules?

Before we delve into⁢ the best options, let's ⁤explore the compelling reasons to switch to reusable Nespresso capsules. The ‍environmental impact of single-use aluminum‌ capsules ​is meaningful.

Choosing a reusable alternative is a powerful step towards reducing your environmental footprint and embracing a more sustainable lifestyle.

Beyond the environmental benefits, reusable capsules offer ‌significant​ cost savings. The initial investment in a set‌ of reusable pods is quickly offset by the reduced cost of coffee grounds compared to pre-filled capsules. Over time, you can save a substantial amount of money while enjoying your favorite⁣ coffee.

refillable Nespresso⁢ pods empower you to customize your⁤ coffee experience. You're no‌ longer limited to the flavors offered by Nespresso. Instead,you ‍can‌ use your preferred coffee beans,experiment with⁣ different ‍roasts and blends,and fine-tune your brewing process to achieve the perfect cup. This level of control and customization⁣ caters to the true coffee‍ connoisseur.

## ‌Understanding the Different Types of Reusable ‌Nespresso Capsules

The market ⁣offers ‍various types of‌ reusable Nespresso capsules, each⁤ with its own advantages​ and disadvantages. Understanding these differences is crucial for selecting the best option for your⁤ specific needs and⁤ preferences.

### Stainless Steel nespresso Capsules

Stainless steel nespresso capsules​ are known⁢ for their durability and longevity. They are resistant to corrosion and can withstand repeated ⁣use without degrading. Many coffee lovers find that stainless steel also doesn't impart any unwanted flavors into⁢ the coffee and is typically ‍considered a ""cleaner"" beverage.

**Pros:**

* ‌  Exceptional ‌Durability: Stainless steel capsules are built to last, offering years of reliable use.
*  ⁣ Neutral Flavor: Stainless steel doesn't affect the taste of your coffee,‌ allowing the true flavor of your chosen beans to shine.
*   Easy to Clean: Most stainless steel‍ capsules are dishwasher-safe, making cleaning a breeze.

**Cons:**

*​  ​ Higher Initial Cost: Stainless steel options tend​ to be more expensive than plastic alternatives, but the longevity often justifies the investment.
*   Potential ⁢for Machine Damage: Some users report that poorly designed⁢ stainless steel capsules can possibly damage Nespresso machines, so choosing a well-reviewed product with good ⁤user⁤ feedback ⁤is extra crucial.

### Plastic Reusable Nespresso ⁣Capsules

Plastic reusable⁤ nespresso capsules are generally more affordable than their stainless steel counterparts. They​ are frequently enough lighter and easier to handle. however, the quality of plastic can vary substantially, so it's important⁣ to choose BPA-free and food-grade options.

**Pros:**

*   Affordability: Plastic capsules are generally more budget-kind,‍ making them​ a good entry point for those‍ new ​to reusable options.
*   Lightweight: Their lightweight design makes them easy to handle and fill.

**Cons:**

*   Durability Concerns: Plastic capsules may not be⁤ as durable as stainless steel and may degrade over time.
*   Potential for Flavor Absorption: Some plastics can absorb flavors from coffee, potentially affecting ⁢the taste of future brews. (Always opt for BPA-Free and Food-Grade when you can)
*   Environmental Concerns: While reusable, plastic still contributes to environmental concerns​ if not properly recycled at the end of its lifespan.

### Alternative Nespresso Capsules (Other Materials)

Besides stainless steel and plastic, some reusable capsules utilize alternative materials ‌like⁣ silicone or biodegradable composites. Silicone ⁢lids for Nespresso pods are ‍frequently enough sold separately to help​ create tighter seals. Biodegradable options aim to reduce the environmental impact even further.

**Pros:**

*  ‍ Variety of Options: These alternatives offer a wider range of choices and materials.
*   Potential Eco-Friendliness: Biodegradable options offer a more sustainable solution if you are looking to reduce overall waste.

**Cons:**

*  ⁢ Variable Quality: The ‍quality ​and reliability of these options can vary significantly, so research​ is crucial.
*   Limited Availability: These options might potentially be less readily available ‍compared ⁢to stainless⁣ steel or ⁢plastic capsules.

## Key Features to Consider ⁣When ​Choosing Reusable Nespresso Pods

When selecting the​ best reusable Nespresso capsules for your needs, consider these essential features:

*   **Compatibility:** Ensure the capsules are specifically⁣ designed for your Nespresso machine model. Not all capsules are compatible with ‍all machines,and using an incompatible capsule can⁢ damage your⁤ appliance.
*   **Durability:** look for capsules made from ‍high-quality materials that can withstand‌ repeated ‍use and cleaning. ⁢Stainless steel is generally the most durable option,while choosing durable plastic‍ is important when going that ⁤route.
*​  ​**seal Quality**: ‍Ensure the lid ⁢creates a⁤ tight‍ waterproof seal so coffee ⁤grounds do not spill into your Nespresso Machine.
*   **ease of Use:** Opt ​for capsules that are easy to fill, clean, ‌and reuse. Consider features like removable lids, dishwasher-safe materials, and included tools.
*   **Coffee Quality:** Look for capsules designed to preserve the flavor and ‌aroma of your coffee.Some capsules have built-in filters or fine mesh screens to prevent sediment from passing through.
* ⁢  **Cleaning Options:** Check if the ⁢capsule components easily come‌ apart, and if all parts are dishwasher safe or not.[[explore Top Rated reusable nespresso capsules on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/breville/?kw=reusable nespresso capsules)

## How to Use Reusable Nespresso Capsules

1.**Grind Selection:** Use ⁤a medium-fine grind similar to what you would use for espresso. Experiment with ⁣different grind sizes to find the sweet spot⁤ for your chosen capsule and coffee beans. If ​you buy⁣ pre-ground coffee, ‍make sure it is suited to espresso machines.

3.  **Tamping:** Gently tamp the coffee grounds to⁤ ensure even distribution and optimal water flow. Some capsules come with a dedicated tamper tool.
4.  **Sealing:** Secure the ⁢lid tightly to prevent ‍leaks‍ and ensure proper‍ pressure during brewing. Silicone lids for Nespresso pods⁢ are a ⁢great supplement to ⁢ensure quality seals..
5.  **Brewing:** Insert the filled capsule into your Nespresso machine and brew as usual.

I wanted to share my case in case someone has experienced something similar — and maybe get some guidance on what I should be asking or testing next.

**Timeline:**

* **June 2024:** First major episode. Right-sided abdominal pain, strong acidity. Blood tests showed **ASAT 590 / ALAT 295**, **FIB-4 = 3.9**. No clear cause found, liver ultrasound normal. I was told it might have been a transient viral hepatitis or reaction to meds **that maybe we will never know**.
* **January 2025:** Strong digestive discomfort again. Epigastric pain, bloating, acid reflux. **Lipase = 93 U/L**, but not enough for full-blown pancreatitis. Symptoms settled without hospitalization.
* **March 2025:** Went to ER for sharp epigastric and lower right quadrant pain, burning sensation, abdominal tension. **Lipase = 181 (ASAT was a little high here)**, Scannet TAC showed a **hypertrophied pancreas**, no necrosis or biliary dilation. Diagnosed with **acute pancreatitis**, hospitalized briefly, discharged with conservative treatment. Pain improved, but I still have residual abdominal tenderness, especially when pressing.
* Next day from March hospitalization, all values were within normal ranges.

This are values from the hospital on March:

|Parameter|My Value|Reference Range|Interpretation|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Erythrocytes (Red Blood Cells)**|4.25 million/µL|4.3 – 5.7|🔽 Slightly low|
|**Hemoglobin**|12.9 g/dL|13.8 – 16.1|🔽 Slightly low|
|**Hematocrit**|38% (0.38)|40 – 54%|🔽 Slightly low|
|**Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW)**|12.2%|14 – 16%|🔽 Low|
|**Neutrophils**|48.5%|55 – 65%|🔽 Slightly low|
|**Eosinophils**|3.5%|1 – 3%|🔼 Slightly elevated|
|**Lymphocytes**|37.8%|25 – 35%|🔼 Slightly elevated|

Shared symptoms across all episodes:

* Daily **bloating**, **belching**, and **gastric discomfort**, especially after eating.
* **Acid reflux**, sometimes even hours after a light meal.
* General feeling that something is ""off"" in my digestion.
* When eating or drinki water the pain dissapears.

Personal background:

* No gallstones (confirmed via Scanner and Radio)
* I eat quite clean: low-fat, no fried foods
* I don’t smoke (quit 8 years ago)
* Alcohol: 1–2 times/month, usually 3 cocktails max
* Coffee: I used to drink **4 cups per day** regularly until recently — I’ve stopped for now

I wonder if this could be a case of **chronic H. pylori infection**, given the ongoing digestive symptoms and the relief I get from eating or drinking. I’m also considering whether a **viral cause** (like EBV, CMV, or Hepatitis E) might explain both the **spikes in liver enzymes** and the **episodes of pancreatitis**. I’m also concerned about whether this could represent the beginning of **early-stage chronic pancreatitis**, even though current scans haven’t shown necrosis or calcifications.

Thanks for reading — and if you've experienced anything similar or have thoughts on how I should approach this with my GI doctor, I’d really appreciate your input.

Thank you!",2,1743198031.0,pancreatitis,0,1.0,False

However, he's not the reason why I can't be her bridesmaid as there are other factors. First, besides Elle, I don't know any of her other friends as we went to different high schools and we're very different people. And since I don't know anyone, I can't trust any of the bridal party to share a hotel room and split costs on that. Speaking of costs, some of us, me, can't afford expensive stuff and oh how Elle loves things to be expensive even when she's not the one paying for it. The venue they are getting married at has some areas that are very scenic which means hotels cost more. Lastly, I do not have the time or means available to do anything bridesmaid-esque. I also don't drink alcohol and don't want to be the person in charge of complete strangers who will become drunk. I don't mind going as a guest and be allowed to have a plus one so I'm not by myself, but there's also a chance she won't give someone who has been single for a long while a plus one to the wedding. We've already planned to meet up tomorrow for coffee so she could give me stuff to make me being a bridesmaid official, so I'm going to tell her that I can't come to her wedding as a bridesmaid but as a guest. 

(just for added information: I have told her that I would love to go to her wedding but won't have the funds to be her bridesmaid and yet a few weeks ago she asked about my schedule so we could meet and she could give the bridesmaid stuff so I'm not entirely sure how this is going to go)",1,1743197907.0,AmItheAsshole,2,1.0,False

It looks like they got a rebrand since their LinkedIn logo differs from their website one, but their three shipping locations (Surrey, UK and Portland) match.

I know there are more practical ways like relying on friends and family in Canada, but besides not wanting to burden them, the shipping option from Surrey allows me to select Canada Post (cheapest) or DHL over FedEx or UPS. At least it's supporting Canadian services even if it's probably going to be expensive

I haven't used this yet but I might try and get them to say, forward an order from London Drugs. If all goes well, then I might try to do a group order with other Canadians in Hong Kong.

I was 233 and now just single digits from my goal weight! I told myself when I started ozempic, I was going to do the work with a little help from my friend. I changed my diet, I cut out a lot of snacking and sugary drinks. Sometimes I would get myself a dr peppy zero sugar because Dr peppy is life. If I crave that carbonated drink..I drink ginger ale zero sugar. To me it's the healthier soda? If that makes sense. 😂 My husband and I drink a slim fast every morning. I went from drinking two cups a coffee to 4oz because I love myself I add creamer. So I get what I love in smaller doses. I have a very physically demanding job so no. I don't exercise. When I start to feel like I might be a smidge hungry I'll drink a protein shake, because do I actually want to eat? Or not. I really upped my water intake. My bowels didn't want to work at the start and well, we all know how that feels. My husband(God bless this man) told me I really needed to up my water intake to help stay regular. I eat lots of steaks, burgers, cheese, and eggs. But heck yeah I also eat cake! I definitely got discouraged many times because I wasn't losing. Why not just up the dose?

1jm66ze,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharacterRant/comments/1jm66ze/simulation_of_the_mind_not/,Simulation of the mind. Not.,"I guess most of you have wondered some time what if everything is just a simulation. So I thought about fictional characters at times, that they are like a small simulation that happens in the authors mind.

  
Except not. Nothing in stories happens as if it would be simulated. If the characters frustration and patience levels would be at all time low, he will still patiently hear the dumb bad guy monologue because the story demands it.

  
Self explanatory? Maybe, but it makes everything so dull. It means that the characters are not even characters, so to speak, they are more like archetypes, caricatures, or what have you. They are actually something that a human mind probably can't quite comprehend fully, so it pretends, at least partially, that they are this simulated thing (or something that can be simulated), such as we are, that has all these parameters like mood, intelligence, hunger level... endless amounts of them.

  
The degree of the illusion of the characters goes even deeper, such as that the author himself cannot always be an authority of his own creations. This is because the author is not the same person that he/she was before. People change. And their memory of their own creations is anything but foolproof. But this would be an another topic in of itself.

  
So what even the characters actually are? Does this just go back to the thing that ""Godzilla is actually an atomic bomb"" or maybe ""some kind of manifestation of collective fear and anxiety that needs to be represented""? Is Hulk just smash + more smash + green + actually kinda smart guy twist... When the author is feeling good, and has had his morning coffee?

  
I think actually the quality smashing comes close, that they are like a collection of qualities. Someone said that ""the only thing worth writing about is the human heart in conflict with itself"". So endless qualities of the human heart, in conflict with other qualities represented by some ""characters"" that represent these qualities. I don't even know at this point, is this getting any closer to some kind of truth? Maybe it all boils down to emotions at the end, how the characters and the story make you feel. If culture would dictate that red hair is a symbol of heroism, then heroes would have a red hair... because what makes one a hero is that people feel like you are a hero? So the appearance of the character is just a convenient shell that takes any appearance that is needed to communicate the feeling or idea at the time? So two characters could actually be the same character even if they would look and even act different, since they communicate exactly the same emotion or idea, just that the target audience has different perceptions of what needs to be shown to represent these emotions or ideas? Damn, this gets tough.

  
Well, whatever the case, but the longer this line of thought goes on, it has some implications, such as comparing character power levels from different series is kind of pointless. And probably many more, my favourite maybe being that it does not really matter if someone is called a demon or looks like one, because the characters then are not their shells, so if the the ""demon"" does good deeds and acts like a human, you could consider it actually to be a human, or equal to human.

  
I guess some smart psychologist has this all already figured out, but didn't inform me for some reason, so here we are, rambling endlessly about stuff that might seem kind of obvious. But I do like to think, that even if some things are not that complicated, they can be still kind of hard to really ""get"". Just having a piece of information in your brain that fictional media is, \*gasp\* in fact, fictional, is easy, but to actually comprehend and meaningfully demonstrate some simpler, or at least simple looking truths can be still hard.",1,1743197379.0,CharacterRant,0,0.67,False

It's best practice for system instructions to include something like, ""You are a professional programmer"" and also lower the temperature setting.

If you ask it to generate a website, for example, for a school or a coffee shop, it's unlikely to generate much text, or only very little, and will probably lack an interesting design, structure/layout, etc. (Claude always includes these things, which is something I initially missed in Gemini 2.5 Pro).

1jm5z2u,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofassumption/comments/1jm5z2u/is_the_law_the_biggest_lie_ever_told_or_the_key/,Is the LAW the Biggest Lie Ever told or the Key to Life?,"Hey everyone, wanted to open this topic to discuss the Law.

First off, I am new to Law of Assumption, and from consuming content, we can all agree that the basics to applying the law is assuming something is true will harden into fact if persisted on ( not talking about techniques, but the mechanism i.e. Assumption when persisted in will harden into fact, wheter you get to that point with techniques or just by deciding doesn't matter to me).

Now, a couple questions I as a newbie have when it comes to the law that make me doubt it, so that's why I am asking everyone to comment their thoughts ( i'd appreciate if they came from people who actually manifested the stuff they wanted not coffee, shirt or whatever but ""Big"" stuff, house, money, love, health, and that they know for a fact it came as a result of applying these teachings )

I'll just list the questions as they come to mind no particular order :

1. If the law works 100% of the time, why does 80-90% of this subreddit or any other community for that matter fail constantly after ""applying"" the law. (I know someone can say ""Oh, but maybe they're not applying it consistently, maybe they're constantly 3d checking, they think as if they have it but still are aware of not having it in 3d and so on"" is it really just this or?
2. Talent show funny clips are filled with ""delusional"" people thinking they can perform arts, sing, draw, dance whatever, once instance comes to mind is when there's this guy who is objectively awful at singing but says to the judges that he is better then them, knows how to sing etc, but he never gotten to a point where it hardened into fact, what's wrong here? I mean clearly they're persisting in the fact that they know how to do xyz, and this is not just talent related, there's tons of people in our everyday life claiming XYZ but it never happens?

3. When it comes to taking action, from what I understand, your only job is to live in the end and everything that needs to happen will happen in order to bring your desire to you, wheter it's you taking action (action that you'll take that will take you to your desire without you being aware that it's taking you there, you'll be able to connect the dots only after the 3d conformed completely) , getting an idea, or whatever else, is this true or not?

4. How can someone design an ""experiment"", where they can 100% without fail every single time so they can know none of the results were coincidences and prove to themselves that the law is absolutely real, what things made you convinced that it's real.

5. Has anyone in here manifested material success such as wealth or knows someone that used the law and that the use of the law is 100% what caused them to become wealthy ( i.e. millions of dollars, multiple 7,8,9+ figures net worth. I mean from the premise of the law every billionaire got there because of the law wheter conciously or unconciously applying it, but I am interested in someone who did it conciously, do you know such people or have done it yourself?

6. When it comes to physical appearance, some people say they grew in height, changed eye colors, changed the way their face completely looks. I've seen a couple of these posts especially when it comes to people reversing the age they look or facial changes, but honestly i've not seen much difference in the before and after photos, or the ""wow you're 60, can't believe you look like 30"" moments, it was mostly yeah you definetly look close to 60 for example, rather then looking the age ""they assume they're"". 

Not to bash anyone, just curious what's going on here, I personally as a newbie would love to know that the law is 100% real so that I can change stuff in my life, but I'd like to know the answers to these questions. Oh and one funny thing that made me ""kind of doubt"" the law is just the sheer amount of coaches on YouTube whose ""how"" & ""when"" to manifesting money is selling LoAss content just made me feel a certain way and doubt it, but I am open to every comment & would love to personally know that the law is real.",2,1743196780.0,lawofassumption,8,0.63,False

I have a pretty small family, there's 10 of us from grandparents to grandkids, and I used to make an effort to spend time with them because even if they are all shitty people at their cores, they were still family and I figured as long as no one was actively making my life *worse* then they could stay in it. That is no longer the case lmao. Im not too upset bout all this, I came to terms Years ago that my family sucks, but it's just bonkers to me how it all played out lmao so imma share the gist with yall. So we had
-uncle telling me to move my car out of his driveway
-uncle banning me from his house (my mom lives with him so I was essentially banned from her house too)
-grandpa sending some weird ass anti trans YouTube video to the gc (it was about some book cadence Owen's wrote about the French prime ministers wife actually being his transgender dad?????)

-I skip Sunday brunch 
-I skip Sunday brunch again, but figured me and my mom would do our own thing like we normally do. That did not happen (and I think she's still doing brunch with my grandpa?)
-a 2nd family group chat was made without me in it (apparently this was on accident but idk)
-my grandpa uses this opportunity to shit talk me behind my back, he calls me crazy and then Agressively dead names and misgenders me in the chat
-my cousin that I haven't really talked to in years comes to my defense and brings up how ""suicidality increases in trans people when they are treated the way yall are treating Max (me)"" and then threw out that Bible quote about throwing stones. I was *not* expecting that so cousin for the win lmao, we even got coffee later and just caught up for a bit, it was nice lol
-also my grandpa tries to hold paying for my aunts phone over her head (she's only a few years older than me and we've been super close our entire lives since we're both the black sheep's of the family lmao)
-she takes over her phone plan while on her lunch break and let's grandpa kno he doesn't need to pay for it anymore, fucking ICON behavior lmfao
-annnnnnd my moms been really fuckin weird the entire time, defending everyone's actions cuz ""it's just their opinion"" and saying she would ""kill for me"" but she hasn't once asked how I'm doing or if I'm ok, or tried to meet up at all
-my mom randomly messages me one day like ""are u ok,,,,, I saw what happened :((("" in regards to an anti trans bathroom bill that my state just passed. That one pissed me off ngl, it might not come across like it, but it felt very performative and cold. And then I didn't respond cuz I lowkey started having a mental break down at work 🤪 and she never reached out to me after that lmfao
-then tomorrow me and my aunt are planning to sit down with my mom and sorta clear the air so she knows what's going on on my end. Pretty much just gonna be me telling her when I will and will not be doing shit with her

So that's all that craziness, which is extra whack cuz I've literally just been standing here doing nothing lmfao.

""What did it do?"" the Champion asked the Tinkerer, who stood in front of him with the suppressed Specter Core.

The Tinkerer took a deep breath, terror on her face.

""It encrypted our database,"" she said in horror.

The Champion furrowed his brows. ""So? Just decrypt it.""

The Tinkerer laughed nervously. ""That's not that easy.""

""Why not?"" the Champion asked.

""We don't know how it has been encrypted. We need a number to decrypt it, and we don't know that number,"" she explained.

""Then just try all of the numbers,"" the Champion said.

""Champion, the number might be thousands or millions of digits long. We would need to try out every number from one to Googolplex. If we use our most advanced machines to try all of the numbers, we might need trillions of years.""

The Champion's eyes widened in shock.

At that point, creating a new database and researching everything from scratch would be faster!

""What's the impact on Aegis?"" he asked.

The Tinkerer took a deep breath.

""All data is inaccessible. We can't see anything. The automatic Containment Units can't be accessed. We can't verify or assign identities. We can't open doors. We can't operate most of our machines. We can't contact cities. We can't contact the strongholds…""

""I had to open the doors by hand…""

The Champion just looked at the Tinkerer with horror.

The next moment, he used his Barrier to command his coffee machine to make some coffee.

The coffee machine just answered that it couldn't verify the Champion's identity.

His own coffee machine was refusing to make coffee!

Aegis had been crippled.

The individual Barriers could still communicate with each other, but anything that required access to the database didn't work anymore.

""The good news is,"" the Tinkerer continued, ""our Containment Units have a failsafe. As long as they still have Zephyx, they will keep suppressing the Specters.That means our contained Force Specters will only start breaking out within the next couple of days. We still have time to-""

""What?!"" the Champion shouted. ""Our Force Specters might break out?!""

""They won't!"" the Tinkerer quickly answered. ""We just have to refill their Zephyx manually! After we've done that, we just need to change their design a bit to allow us to gain access-""

""We don't have access to our Specters?!"" the Champion shouted, standing up from his throne.

'Pretty sure I've said that,' the Tinkerer thought.

""Yes, we don't have access to our Specters at the moment,"" she said.

""Fix this immediately! You're the Technician's replacement! It's your job to deal with these things!"" the Champion shouted.

The Tinkerer started to sweat.

""We have to know how it was encrypted. If we know how it was encrypted, we can decrypt it,"" the Tinkerer said. ""I need to ask the Specter.""

The Champion furrowed his brows as he looked at the suppressed Specter Core.

Then, he just waved his hand.

The Tinkerer nodded and put the Zephyx Suppressors away.

The next moment, the Specter recovered and looked around.

""This does not look like a Containment Unit,"" the Specter mused.

""Tell us how you encrypted the database,"" the Tinkerer asked.

""I encrypted the database?"" the Specter asked. ""Oh, that's what all these lines were about. I didn't know. Sorry.""

The Champion looked at the Specter in disgust.

He knew exactly that the Specter was not sorry.

""Tell us what you typed in,"" the Tinkerer asked.

""Of course,"" the Specter answered.

Naturally, its life was in Aegis' hands, and it would help them so that they wouldn't kill it.

The Specter recited the complicated lines it put into the database.

""Fuck!"" the Tinkerer shouted, kicking the ground.

The Champion glanced at the Tinkerer.

That was… an unusual outburst.

Naturally, the Champion didn't understand anything of what the Specter had just recited.

""What did it say?"" the Champion asked.

The Tinkerer was breathing heavily.

""The encryption is based on our database's contents. The order it sent gathered random letters from millions of random entries, converted them into numbers, and multiplied them with each other.""

""I know what parts were read out and how they are multiplied, but without access to the database, I don't know the values of these parts.""

""In essence, I need access to the database to access the database.""

""Even worse, there was no check for the sum. That means it put a lock on the database and then destroyed the key! Nobody knows what number is needed to decrypt the database. Not me. Not Julian. Not this Specter. Nobody!""

The Champion put his head in his hands while the Tinkerer glared at the Specter.

""Why?! Why did Julian do this?! What does he want?!"" she shouted.

""I don't know,"" the Specter said. ""I only have a message to deliver, and then, I no longer serve Julian Winter.""

The Champion pulled his head out of his hands and looked at the Specter.

Maybe that message had some information that they needed.

""Speak,"" the Champion said.

""I am now going to recite Julian Winter's message,"" the Specter said.

""I did my job. If you are unhappy with how I do my job, you are free to do it for me. My job has to be done one way or another. Do it for me, and I don't have to do it myself.""

""That is the message,"" the Specter spoke.

The Tinkerer furrowed her brows.

She wasn't sure what the Specter meant.

However, the Champion knew exactly what that meant, and he clenched his fists in rage.

Do his job for him?!

Julian was telling the Champion that he had simply done the job of the Envious Researcher.

He had dealt with humanity's advancement.

And if the Champion was unhappy with how Julian did it, he was free to do it for him.

Julian was using him!

Julian was forcing the Champion to do his job for him!

After all, if the Champion didn't,Julian would keep doing his job like this!

All of Aegis had been crippled!

They had not lost a single person, and their Extractors were still as powеrful as ever!

But he had essentially crippled Aegis' eyes, ears, and mouth.

They would need to make a completely new database and set up all the parameters again!

They would need to gather all of the knowledge again and put it back into it!

That would take years!

And after years or decades, they would be in the same position they had been just two hours ago!

""Can I go into my Containment Unit now?"" the Specter asked.

At that moment, the Champion's rage exploded.

BANG!

He vaporized the Specter on the spot.

The Tinkerer gulped nervously as she looked at the smoking stain on the ground.

1jm5tgh,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1jm5tgh/why_am_i_killing_my_friends/,Why am I... killing my friends?,"There was only one good thing about snow.

Traipsing through drifts up to my knees, I dropped onto my stomach, fingers already trigger-happy.

Snow was the perfect hiding place. 

Trees were unreliable when hiding was on everyone's mind. 

My first kill was a girl in a tree—Maybeth. I sat behind her in trigonometry. She used to lend me her calculator. Snow was why I found her. 

Why I pointed my sniper rifle at her head and blew her brains out, beads of dripping red splattering pristine white.

The warm glow of the cabin against the pitch-black sky was cruel. 

But I had adapted to the cold. 

I was used to *numb*.

Rolling onto my front, I spied three of my classmates standing watch in the doorway. 

Emmet and Boyce.

Boyce was my first kiss.

He smelled like burger sauce and coffee. 

“I’m cold,” he mumbled to Emmet. 

“You're *always* cold,” Emmet snapped back. 

I shot Boyce. 

Then Emmet.

I watched a river of slow-moving red seep into freshly fallen snow.

It hit me while I was reloading and checking for ammo. 

I lost my breath, choking on wisps of white, the world suddenly violently jerking. I dropped to my knees. 

My chest ached. 

*Why was I… killing my… friends?*

“Don't fucking move.”

Jude Garside. Pointing a rifle directly between my brows.

Oh... I killed his boyfriend. 

“Turn around, Posie.”

I did, dropping my weapon. 

“Do you… trust me?” Jude’s voice shuddered. 

My response turned into a screech when he plunged a knife into the back of my neck. I waited to die, but instead—

A voice. 

*“A thermonuclear war has just broken out! You are our last hope! Kill to be the last one standing! I repeat—”*

""It's a loop."" Jude whispered, holding up a tiny chip between his fingers slick with my blood. He stepped forward, trembling. 

“We’ve been through this so many fucking times, and you keep *forgetting*."" He stuck the barrel of his gun between my eyes and blew my brains out before I could reply. 

*Darkness.*

I woke up face down in the snow, back where I started. 

Maybeth was in her tree.

No. No. No.

This wasn't fucking happening. This wasn't real. 

With trembling hands, I dragged my pocket knife across my throat. 

I woke up face down, blinking up at the pitch dark sky. 

I ran into the cabin, screaming, and was immediately shot.

I woke up to Jude looming over me this time. 

His fingers were trembling on the trigger, taking down two classmates who ambushed us.

He took a shaky step back. 

“I'm *not* shooting you,” he whispered. “I'm not *fucking* shooting you!”

**GAME OVER.**

Hissing, I dropped my controller.

“They're doing it again,” I muttered. 

On screen, my avatar was trying to slit her throat with her fingernails. 

“They're refusing to play!”

Jude scoffed, chewing pizza next to me. 

“Well, yeah. Duh.” he grinned, slamming X. 
 
Jude's character dropped to his knees, shaking, the gun slipping from his hands.

1jm5rid,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1jm5rid/please_help_a_new_barista/,Please Help a New Barista!!,"Hi all, I have been lurking on this sub for a long time now! I am a first time barista at my local cafe, and I’ve been having some issues. I’m having a hard time knowing if this is normal behavior/ culture for a coffee shop, or if this is an unhealthy work environment. 

Background: As I’ve said, I’m a first time barista. I’ve been working at my local cafe for about 5/6 months. I’m in college right now, and I’m taking a good amount of credits, so I’ve only been able to work 2 days a week since those are my only full days of availability. When I first started working and training, I averaged about 16 hour work weeks, sometimes a little less. I started in the fall, so it was very busy. Christmas came and went and I still averaged the same. I made good money for only 16 a week and I was doing well, however I always felt a beat behind. However, I chalked it up to me doubting my abilities. I always felt like I did bad on bar, so I tended to stick to register. I felt bad that I couldn’t work on bar as well however I knew it was my first time. A little more into the job, I got my first complaint of being rude. I cleaned up my act right away, and made it a huge point of being kinder. Also, about 4 weeks ago, I asked if I could work more in the summer, and he said yes. 

I worked really hard, however, my hours sharply got cut again. I asked my boss and he said we were slow and he had to train someone. I found it odd that if we were so slow he would hire someone else. She started slowly getting more and more hours than me. I was upset at first but then rethought the situation- she was more experienced. Okay, shitty feeling but makes sense-until this week. 

My hours had been noticeably reduced further. At now 4 hours a WEEK, I grew concerned. I had a weird feeling people I worked with didn’t like me. I started dealing with a coworker that honestly just makes me feel bad about myself (weird comments), and I felt like my boss didn’t like me. He never talked to me or made a point of even greeting me like the others in the morning. Again, I chalked it up to just being in my head. Until today. I decided that I would ask him if I could work more hours in the summer, just incase he forgot. This is how the conversation went.. 

I started by asking if it was possible I could pick up some more hours due to me being out of school. He hesitated, and I was worried, and he said “You’re gonna have to pick it up around here”. I said I understood, and he elaborated saying “You’ve been here long enough to understand expectations” and the part that made me write this post “and everyone thinks it’s harder to work with you when you have to get told what to do”, something along those lines. I said I understood, but that I really was trying my best, and I practiced drinks, but I still have a hard time adjusting since my last job was so drastically different. I told him how I really appreciate the job and I care about it, and I don’t intend to be lazy. I asked what area he thinks I should improve upon the most, and he said probably side tasks. However, that is so broad! I definitely do side tasks throughout the day, so maybe he is referring towards closing. I finished up with some irrelevant comments and concerns, about just random things. He said I could ask for more availability but I had to earn it. 


Now, with that being said, I don’t disagree with everything. Yes, I could definitely do better at my job. I am probably the least experienced. However, saying everyone thinks it’s hard to work with me and I make things harder for everyone was a low blow. I don’t get my feeling hurt easily, but I’ll admit, I cried when I left because I try hard to be nice and helpful with my coworkers. And in return, they all kind of make fun of me, however that’s besides the point. I really thought my doubts on myself were all in my head, but I guess not. 

So baristas, my question to you: Is there a way I can improve and feel more comfortable with the job so I can earn my hours back? I feel like I can do better, but I didn’t get great training, and being told to do side tasks isn’t the most helpful. Any advice? And yes, I know I might be in the “wrong” or I might deserve what he said. But is it normal that before and after this incident, I’m terrified to work with/communicate with my boss? I’m not really sure how the work culture is in coffee, but so far my experience hasn’t been great even other than today. Thank you guys so much in advance for any responses, and please keep positing latte art inspo! 

TLDR: my boss says I’m not working hard enough; any suggestions on how to improve my efficiency at work?

We broke up six months ago and while I was upset at the time, I’ve moved on and don’t have any real resentment toward him. 

Anyway, during our conversation he asked how I felt about our relationship now that time has passed. I was honest and said “Truly? I think it was kind of a waste of time.”  

I know that sounds harsh but I didn’t mean it like that. I just meant that, in hindsight we were never really compatible in the long run. 

We spent a year together, and it ultimately ended because he couldn’t get past his insecurities about my work. I do theater and I take it seriously. He really struggled with certain aspects of that. 

He’d get distant whenever I had roles that involved that involved any kind of intimacy (not even sex, just my character having a partner in general) and even though I reassured him a million times that acting is literally pretend, he never fully believed me. It got to the point where every performance or rehearsal became this minefield where I had to anticipate his mood. 

Eventually, Cole broke things off because he “couldn’t handle it.”  

To me, that makes the whole relationship feel like a waste of time. I could’ve been with someone who actually understood my career instead of spending a year constantly trying to convince someone that my job wasn’t a personal attack on them or at least knows how to handle those feelings better than he did.  

 
I don’t think that’s an unfair assessment, it’s just reality. But when I said that, he got really offended and said that was a cruel thing to say because, to him, our relationship wasn’t a waste and it meant a lot to him.  

 
He said he truly cared about me, and it hurt to hear that I thought it was all for nothing. I didn’t really get why he was so upset. I wasn’t saying he was a waste of time, just that the relationship didn’t lead anywhere for either of us. 

It wasn’t compatible, it wasn’t going to last, so what’s the issue with acknowledging that? 

Now I’m wondering if I was too blunt. I didn’t mean to hurt his feelings, and I wasn’t trying to diminish whatever he felt for me or his personal feelings about our relationship. I was just being realistic. But maybe I should’ve phrased it differently?

I got a job as a night-time janitor at her church, the biggest  Church in town. The relationship was rocky so 2 months after I moved I asked her if she was breaking up with me. That's when she told me that she didn't like my baldness and she wanted me to tell her what to do which I thought was weird but after we talked she didn't break up with me so I thought there was a chance to fix the problem. 
 2 months later on November 1st she asked to meet me at a local coffee shop. When I got there she had a serious face. She broke up with me. I was emotional because of undiagnosed depression and I was crying and the Cafe was busy so people were looking. Then she said ""I never really liked you anyway"" and that she only went out with me because her friend told her too. Knowing I was hurting she very coldly hurt me again. At that time in spite of the hurt I knew I was lucky it was over. 

On November 10th I was setting up chairs for the Sunday Service. During a break I saw my ex leaving the church and the guy working the day shift (I went to college with him) ran after her I watched out the window as they hugged and talk and wasn't concerned and went back to work.

I was confused and after he said two more times it set in. I said that my ex and I broke up only 10 days earlier. He then said that it was over in September not November 1st. If that was true then they were dating before we broke up. In desperate disbelief I called and asked her if it was true she answered ""Would I do that to you?"" which 
was avoiding answering the question so I knew it was true. I was very upset as my former tried to talk to me I told to leave me alone he got angry and threw a chair across the room and left. I was very upset and depressed and over the next 2 weeks it became much worse. I thought we might stay friends without approaching them I waved then he talked to an elder to keep me busy while they left. Which was unnecessary as I never moved towards them"". I became very upset at the loss of a friendship. Buy the mid-afternoon noon I bought several strong pills and Ice Tea. Later I took the pills and called the guy at the church and I to tell him 3 Times before he understood. Just before I passed out the police arrived. And I blacked out a minute later. 
I woke up 2 days later and was escorted by a constable to a mental health facility. When I was discharged 5 days later all I wanted to do was ask questions about what happened with my ex and the guy I worked with.

My marriage was abusive and traumatic. I have gotten much better but it's still a work in progress. 

A few weeks ago, I was able to talk to him about something that was bothering me and the conversation went well and he offered comfort and support. I was very nervous and shaking... it was hard. His understanding was something I've never experienced before.

We have been dating for almost 8 months now, and I still ruminate about how to bring up difficult topics.  I am afraid that I come across as needy and clingy... especially when I comes to expressing my needs.  In this case, I want him to make more of an effort when we spend time together.  

We see each other weekly with an overnight but for example, we were able to spend some extra time together this week and in the morning, he didn't have anything to eat for breakfast and just a small amount of coffee (because he was running low).  This extra time was pre-planned so he knew about it.  He lives about 45 minutes away from me and he had mentioned that we could do something in his area that I had never seen before.  I was looking forward to it.

In the morning, he got up and made coffee, lounged for a bit and he fell asleep until noon.  We didn't do the activity.  He didn't seem to care and I was sad and disappointed.  He has his kids about 80% of the time (I don't have kids) and I know those days are tiring and busy.  I was thinking... 'maybe he just needed some extra rest... I should be more understanding'.  

He works hard, is kind, a great Dad, and seems to enjoy spending time with me.

I'm married and have a son and two cats. I’m extremely introverted and reserved, so I’ve never really felt uncomfortable being alone. But recently, after turning 40, I started looking back and realizing how much I’ve missed out on. I feel like I’ve grown older without experiencing the things that come with having friends. I wanted to make friends, so I started looking around, and that’s how I ended up here. I'm new to Reddit. I’ve read the community rules, but if I make any mistakes, I apologize.

I’m very shy at first, but once I get close to someone, I love goofing around and being playful. People often describe me as “very thin and super wide”. I’m easygoing, receptive, and not the type to dig deep or argue.

I used to love gaming, especially raids and endgame content. But after having a child, I haven’t been able to play much, so I don’t think I can call gaming my hobby anymore. I also enjoy writing and drawing, though I mostly just do it for myself. I love novels, dramas, and movies. Especially sci-fi. I also enjoy apocalyptic and dystopian themes. But since I’m “very thin and super wide,” I can enjoy almost anything.

I take care of plants, but I wouldn’t say I have expert knowledge about soil or nutrients. I’m just barely managing to keep things like succulents, roses, a coffee tree, and hydrangeas alive. (the color of hydrangeas changes every year😂)

The one hobby I’ve consistently kept up with is hiking. But I haven’t gone anywhere with an elevation gain over 400m yet, since I have to plan around my kid’s drop-off and pick-up times.

Recently, I’ve been really into skincare and working out. I feel like I wasted my 30s, so I’m trying to catch up now. But because of my shy personality, I can’t bring myself to register at a gym😂😂 I just work out at home.

I’m so introverted that if someone pulls me along, I’ll just follow, but if no one does, I’ll stay exactly where I am. That’s one of my biggest weaknesses. Because of this, it’s really hard for me to reach out first when making friends. Before I get any older, I want to change that about myself.

Hey Reddit!

I’m a 46-year-old guy looking to meet a wonderful woman who shares a similar vibe. I like to think of myself as funny, sweet, and just the right amount of sarcastic. I believe laughter is key in life, so if you can appreciate a good joke (or a bad pun), we’ll get along just fine!

A little about me: I enjoy spending my weekends exploring new places, trying out different cuisines, and just enjoying life’s little moments. Whether it’s watching a movie, going for a hike, or just having deep conversations over coffee, I’m all in.

Physically:
5’10, 200lbs, olive complexion, light brown eyes, broad shoulders, well groomed, into fitness, smell good, treat others the way I’d wanna be treated.  Latin descent.  

I’m looking for someone who is genuine, shares a sense of humor, and is ready for some fun adventures together. If you’re interested, don’t hesitate to reach out! Let’s see where this goes.",1,1743195632.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

Anyone got advice?,"We have been together for well over a decade now, and married for the last 3. But throughout our relationship I have become terrified of experiencing good things or voicing my emotions.

One story that should have rang alarm bells was all the way back in the first two months of our relationship. We were out drinking in town when, from my wife's (then girlfriends) perspective I suddenly b-lines to the side. I had spotted two £20 notes laying on the ground and rushed to pick them up before the wind took them. Excitedly I showed her, laughing about how I felt bad for whoever dropped them, but also how lucky I was. I expected her to be excited, or happy for me, but instead she because visibly annoyed. She told me that when I walked off she turned and saw them too, and because she saw them before I picked them up it rightfully belonged to her. I laughed it off and said we would go for more drinks and both share it anyway, but that made her angrier because I was not giving her ""her money"". 
I put it down as being drunk and figured we would be sharing it through the night anyway and so gave her one of the £20 notes, at which point she calmed down like it never happened. Unfortunately this turned out to be nothing to do with alcohol. 

Every time I got a suprise free coffee from the barista, or a free side from the takeout place, or won a contest of any kind, my wife would become angry or depressed. And it wouldn't get better until I gave her what I was received or bought her something to cheer her up.

Lately, and bear with me here, it's Pokemon cards. and jealousy of luck.  I got back into collecting a couple of years ago and my wife slowly began to realise she liked them too. I used to get exited at release days for new sets, and was over the moon when I pulled a card I wanted. But now, when I pull a good card, I feel genuine panic. The second I find one, my wife's face will drop, her shoulders slump, and she will go quiet. She then won't speak for a while, and when she does it's easy to hear how depressed she is. Nothing will cheer her up, unless I find another card she wants and give it to her. The whole thing is stressful, and I find myself scared to open packs around her, but she gets furious if I don't let her open the packs because she enjoys it. She has sucked all the joy out of the hobby. 

Regardless of the scenario, whenever my wife does anything that upsets me or makes me feel down, I can't talk to her about it because she will either become defensive and angry, or she will begin to cry until I end up consoling her. If I do get an apology it's one that's snapped at me, or delivered with an eye roll, like ""eugh, fine then, I'm sorry.""
If I ignore it I get told repeatedly that she has already apologised and that I'm being impossible. If I address it I get told that she is trying and that I don't appreciate her efforts. And so I have to swallow it down and ignore it. 

I don't know what to do. I can't talk to her about it because it makes it worse. I can't keep losing things that make me happy because there isn't much left. I love her but I need to know how to handle this. I need to find a way to not let up break me. Does anyone  have any advice?",2,1743195630.0,relationship_advice,5,1.0,False

When she pulled up to the window I explained why we can’t do that, and that the other store was wrong in doing that. (I even knew the exact store before she told me what store) she cut me off and was like “I don’t care. i just want the drink.” 

I was stunned speechless for a second and then said “okay” and walked away and let DTR handle the rest. They told me later that she said “I’m sorry, I just didn’t want to hear a whole thesis on coffee”

…a THESIS???? 

I’m sorry that caring about standard and trying to make sure you understand that we’re not just making up rules to deny you your drink is too much for you, but I genuinely had your best interest in mind. A lot of people like to know why they could get something in one location but not another. 

It’s just so discouraging. I’m a high masking autistic and I really thought I was following the right social protocol/etiquette, but it just ruined my day. 

Bottom line is, STOP SEEING STANDARD AS A NONNEGOTIABLE. I’m not a Starbucks-standard-police, but when it goes against the whole nature of the drink, it’s not negotiable. Please stop. ",34,1743195614.0,starbucks,9,0.96,False

He knows other people here - we have a common acquaintance, namely, a girl who's hanging out with my group of friends every now and then and whom he knows better than I do - but I noticed he's not inviting her to our hangouts that often. 

When we meet up, he behaves like he does with his male friends, so he's not flirty (...I guess?). However, his friends have always told me he's very insecure around other women and that he's never had a girlfriend.

Now, I am getting kind of interested in my friend, but I do not want to misinterpret any signals he may be sending.

1jm5g88,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkGathering/comments/1jm5g88/i_was_an_english_teacher_in_vietnam_i_will_never/,I Was an English Teacher in Vietnam... I Will Never Step Foot Inside a Jungle Again - Part 1 of 2,"My name is Sarah Branch. A few years ago, when I was 24 years old, I had left my home state of Utah and moved abroad to work as an English language teacher in Vietnam. Having just graduated BYU and earning my degree in teaching, I suddenly realized I needed so much more from my life. I always wanted to travel, embrace other cultures, and most of all, have memorable and life-changing experiences.  

Feeling trapped in my normal, everyday life outside of Salt Lake City, where winters are cold and summers always far away, I decided I was no longer going to live the life that others had chosen for me, and instead choose my own path in life – a life of fulfilment and little regrets. Already attaining my degree in teaching, I realized if I gained a further ESL Certification (teaching English as a second language), I could finally achieve my lifelong dream of travelling the world to far-away and exotic places – all the while working for a reasonable income. 

There were so many places I dreamed of going – maybe somewhere in South America or far east Asia. As long as the weather was warm and there were beautiful beaches for me to soak up the sun, I honestly did not mind. Scanning my finger over a map of the world, rotating from one hemisphere to the other, I eventually put my finger down on a narrow, little country called Vietnam. This was by no means a random choice. I had always wanted to travel to Vietnam because... I’m actually one-quarter Vietnamese. Not that you can tell or anything - my hair is brown and my skin is rather fair. But I figured, if I wanted to go where the sun was always shining, and there was an endless supply of tropical beaches, Vietnam would be the perfect destination! Furthermore, I’d finally get the chance to explore my heritage. 

Fortunately enough for me, it turned out Vietnam had a huge demand for English language teachers. They did prefer it if you were teaching in the country already - but after a few online interviews and some Visa complications later, I packed up my things in Utah and moved across the world to the Land of the Blue Dragon.  

I was relocated to a beautiful beach town in Central Vietnam, right along the coast of the South China Sea. English teachers don’t really get to choose where in the country they end up, but if I did have that option, I could not have picked a more perfect place... Because of the horrific turn this story will take, I can’t say where exactly it was in Central Vietnam I lived, or even the name of the beach town I resided in - just because I don’t want anyone to get the wrong idea. This part of Vietnam is a truly beautiful place and I don’t want to discourage anyone from going there. So, for the continuation of this story, I’m just going to refer to where I was as Central Vietnam – and as for the beach town where I made my living, I’m going to give it the pseudonym “Biển Hứa Hẹn” - which in Vietnamese, roughly, but rather fittingly translates to “Sea of Promise.”   

Biển Hứa Hẹn truly was the most perfect destination! It was a modest sized coastal town, nestled inside of a tropical bay, with the whitest sands and clearest blue waters you could possibly dream of. The town itself is also spectacular. Most of the houses and buildings are painted a vibrant sunny yellow, not only to look more inviting to tourists, but so to reflect the sun during the hottest months. For this reason, I originally wanted to give the town the nickname “Trấn Màu Vàng” (Yellow Town), but I quickly realized how insensitive that pseudonym would have been – so “Sea of Promise” it is!  

Alongside its bright, sunny buildings, Biển Hứa Hẹn has the most stunning oriental and French Colonial architecture – interspersed with many quality restaurants and coffee shops. The local cuisine is to die for! Not only is it healthy and delicious, but it's also surprisingly cheap – like we’re only talking 90 cents! You wouldn’t believe how many different flavours of Coffee Vietnam has. I mean, I went a whole 24 years without even trying coffee, and since I’ve been here, I must have tried around two-dozen flavours. Another whimsy little aspect of this town is the many multi-coloured, little plastic chairs that are dispersed everywhere. So whether it was dining on the local cuisine or trying my twenty-second flavour of coffee, I would always find one of these chairs – a different colour every time, sit down in the shade and just watch the world go by. 

I haven’t even mentioned how much I loved my teaching job. My classes were the most adorable 7 and 8 year-olds, and my colleagues were so nice and welcoming. They never called me by my first name. Instead my colleagues would always say “Chào em” or “Chào em gái”, which basically means “Hello little sister.”  

When I wasn’t teaching or grading papers, I spent most of my leisure time by the town’s beach - and being the boring, vanilla person I am, I didn’t really do much. Feeling the sun upon my skin while I observed the breath-taking scenery was more than enough – either that or I was curled up in a good book... I was never the only foreigner on this beach. Biển Hứa Hẹn is a popular tourist destination – mostly Western backpackers and surfers. So, if I wasn’t turning pink beneath the sun or memorizing every little detail of the bay’s geography, I would enviously spectate fellow travellers ride the waves. 

As much as I love Vietnam - as much as I love Biển Hứa Hẹn, what really spoils this place from being the perfect paradise is all the garbage pollution. I mean, it’s just everywhere. There is garbage in the town, on the beach and even in the ocean – and if it isn’t the garbage that spoils everything, it certainly is all the rats, cockroaches and other vermin brought with it. Biển Hứa Hẹn is such a unique place and it honestly makes me so mad that no one does anything about it... Nevertheless, I still love it here. It will always be a paradise to me – and if America was the Promised Land for Lehi and his descendants, then this was going to be my Promised Land.  

I had now been living in Biển Hứa Hẹn for 4 months, and although I had only 3 months left in my teaching contract, I still planned on staying in Vietnam - even if that meant leaving this region I’d fallen in love with and relocating to another part of the country. Since I was going to stay, I decided I really needed to learn Vietnamese – as you’d be surprised how few people there are in Vietnam who can speak any to no English. Although most English teachers in South-East Asia use their leisure time to travel, I rather boringly decided to spend most of my days at the same beach, sat amongst the sand while I studied and practised what would hopefully become my second language. 

On one of those days, I must have been completely occupied in my own world, because when I look up, I suddenly see someone standing over, talking down to me. I take off my headphones, and shading the sun from my eyes, I see a tall, late-twenty-something tourist - wearing only swim shorts and cradling a surfboard beneath his arm. Having come in from the surf, he thought I said something to him as he passed by, where I then told him I was speaking Vietnamese to myself, and didn’t realize anyone could hear me. We both had a good laugh about it and the guy introduces himself as Tyler. Like me, Tyler was American, and unsurprisingly, he was from California. He came to Vietnam for no other reason than to surf. Like I said, Tyler was this tall, very tanned guy – like he was the tannest guy I had ever seen. He had all these different tattoos he acquired from his travels, and long brown hair, which he regularly wore in a man-bun. When I first saw him standing there, I was taken back a little, because I almost mistook him as Jesus Christ – that's what he looked like. Tyler asks what I’m doing in Vietnam and later in the conversation, he invites me to have a drink with him and his surfer buddies at the beach town bar. I was a little hesitant to say yes, only because I don’t really drink alcohol, but Tyler seemed like a nice guy and so I agreed.  

Later that day, I meet Tyler at the bar and he introduces me to his three surfer friends. The first of Tyler’s friends was Chris, who he knew from back home. Chris was kinda loud and a little obnoxious, but I suppose he was also funny. The other two friends were Brodie and Hayley - a couple from New Zealand. Tyler and Chris met them while surfing in Australia – and ever since, the four of them have been travelling, or more accurately, surfing the world together. Over a few drinks, we all get to know each other a little better and I told them what it’s like to teach English in Vietnam. Curious as to how they’re able to travel so much, I ask them what they all do for a living. Tyler says they work as vloggers, bloggers and general content creators, all the while travelling to a different country every other month. You wouldn’t believe the number of places they’ve been to: Hawaii, Costa Rica, Sri Lanka, Bali – everywhere! They didn’t see the value of staying in just one place and working a menial job, when they could be living their best lives, all the while being their own bosses. It did make a lot of sense to me, and was not that unsimilar to my reasoning for being in Vietnam.  

The four of them were only going to be in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple more days, but when I told them I hadn’t yet explored the rest of the country, they insisted that I tag along with them. I did come to Vietnam to travel, not just stay in one place – the only problem was I didn’t have anyone to do it with... But I guess now I did. They even invited me to go surfing with them the next day. Having never surfed a day in my life, I very nearly declined the offer, but coming all this way from cold and boring Utah, I knew I had to embrace new and exciting opportunities whenever they arrived. 

By early next morning, and pushing through my first hangover, I had officially surfed my first ever wave. I was a little afraid I’d embarrass myself – especially in front of Tyler, but after a few trials and errors, I thankfully gained the hang of it. Even though I was a newbie at surfing, I could not have been that bad, because as soon as I surf my first successful wave, Chris would not stop calling me “Johnny Utah” - not that I knew what that meant. If I wasn’t embarrassing myself on a board, I definitely was in my ignorance of the guys’ casual movie quotes. For instance, whenever someone yelled out “Charlie Don’t Surf!” all I could think was, “Who the heck is Charlie?” 

By that afternoon, we were all back at the bar and I got to spend some girl time with Hayley. She was so kind to me and seemed to take a genuine interest in my life - or maybe she was just grateful not to be the only girl in the group anymore. She did tell me she thought Chris was extremely annoying, no matter where they were in the world - and even though Brodie was the quiet, sensible type for the most part, she hated how he acted when he was around the guys. Five beers later and Brodie was suddenly on his feet, doing some kind of native New Zealand war dance while Chris or Tyler vlogged. 

Although I was having such a wonderful time with the four of them, anticipating all the places in Vietnam Hayley said we were going, in the corner of my eye, I kept seeing the same strange man staring over at us. I thought maybe we were being too loud and he wanted to say something, but the man was instead looking at all of us with intrigue. Well, 10 minutes later, this very same man comes up to us with three strangers behind him. Very casually, he asks if we’re all having a good time. We kind of awkwardly oblige the man. A fellow traveller like us, who although was probably in his early thirties, looked more like a middle-aged dad on vacation - in an overly large Hawaiian shirt, as though to hide his stomach, and looking down at us through a pair of brainiac glasses. The strangers behind him were two other men and a young woman. One of the men was extremely hairy, with a beard almost as long as his own hair – while the other was very cleanly presented, short in height and holding a notepad. The young woman with them, who was not much older than myself, had a cool combination of dyed maroon hair and sleeve tattoos – although rather oddly, she was wearing way too much clothing for this climate. After some brief pleasantries, the man in the Hawaiian shirt then says, ‘I’m sorry to bother you folks, but I was wondering if we could ask you a few questions?’ 

Introducing himself as Aaron, the man tells us that he and his friends are documentary filmmakers, and were wanting to know what we knew of the local disappearances. Clueless as to what he was talking about, Aaron then sits down, without invitation at our rather small table, and starts explaining to us that for the past thirty years, tourists in the area have been mysteriously going missing without a trace. First time they were hearing of this, Tyler tells Aaron they have only been in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple of days. Since I was the one who lived and worked in the town, Hayley asks me if I knew anything of the missing tourists - and when she does, Aaron turns his full attention on me. Answering his many questions, I told Aaron I only heard in passing that tourists have allegedly gone missing, but wasn’t sure what to make of it. But while I’m telling him this, I notice the short guy behind him is writing everything I say down, word for word – before Aaron then asks me, with desperation in his voice, ‘Well, have you at least heard of the local legends?’  

Suddenly gaining an interest in what Aaron’s telling us, Tyler, Chris and Brodie drunkenly inquire, ‘Legends? What local legends?’ 

Taking another sip from his light beer, Aaron tells us that according to these legends, there are creatures lurking deep within the jungles and cave-systems of the region, and for centuries, local farmers or fishermen have only seen glimpses of them... Feeling as though we’re being told a scary bedtime story, Chris rather excitedly asks, ‘Well, what do these creatures look like?’ Aaron says the legends abbreviate and there are many claims to their appearance, but that they’re always described as being humanoid.   

Whatever these creatures were, paranormal communities and investigators have linked these legends to the disappearances of the tourists. All five of us realized just how silly this all sounded, which Brodie highlighted by saying, ‘You don’t actually believe that shite, do you?’ 

Without saying either yes or no, Aaron smirks at us, before revealing there are actually similar legends and sightings all around Central Vietnam – even by American soldiers as far back as the Vietnam War.  

‘You really don’t know about the cryptids of the Vietnam War?’ Aaron asks us, as though surprised we didn’t.  

Further educating us on this whole mystery, Aaron claims that during the war, several platoons and individual soldiers who were deployed in the jungles, came in contact with more than one type of creature.  

‘You never heard of the Rock Apes? The Devil Creatures of Quang Binh? The Big Yellows?’ 

If you were like us, and never heard of these creatures either, apparently what the American soldiers encountered in the jungles was a group of small Bigfoot-like creatures, that liked to throw rocks, and some sort of Lizard People, that glowed a luminous yellow and lived deep within the cave systems. 

Feeling somewhat ridiculous just listening to this, Tyler rather mockingly comments, ‘So, you’re saying you believe the reason for all the tourists going missing is because of Vietnamese Bigfoot and Lizard People?’ 

Aaron and his friends must have received this ridicule a lot, because rather than being insulted, they looked somewhat amused.  

‘Well, that’s why we’re here’ he says. ‘We’re paranormal investigators and filmmakers – and as far as we know, no one has tried to solve the mystery of the Vietnam Triangle. We’re in Biển Hứa Hẹn to interview locals on what they know of the disappearances, and we’ll follow any leads from there.’ 

Although I thought this all to be a little kooky, I tried to show a little respect and interest in what these guys did for a living – but not Tyler, Chris or Brodie. They were clearly trying to have fun at Aaron’s expense.  

‘So, what did the locals say? Is there a Vietnamese Loch Ness Monster we haven’t heard of?’  

Like I said, Aaron was well acquainted with this kind of ridicule, because rather spontaneously he replies, ‘Glad you asked!’ before gulping down the rest of his low-carb beer. ‘According to a group of fishermen we interviewed yesterday, there’s an unmapped trail that runs through the nearby jungles. Apparently, no one knows where this trail leads to - not even the locals do. And anyone who tries to find out for themselves... are never seen or heard from again.’ 

As amusing as we found these legends of ape-creatures and lizard-men, hearing there was a secret trail somewhere in the nearby jungles, where tourists are said to vanish - even if this was just a local legend... it was enough to unsettle all of us. Maybe there weren’t creatures abducting tourists in the jungles, but on an unmarked wilderness trail, anyone not familiar with the terrain could easily lose their way. Neither Tyler, Chris, Brodie or Hayley had a comment for this - after all, they were fellow travellers. As fun as their lifestyle was, they knew the dangers of venturing the more untamed corners of the world. The five of us just sat there, silently, not really knowing what to say, as Aaron very contentedly mused over us. 

‘We’re actually heading out tomorrow in search of the trail – we have directions and everything.’ Aaron then pauses on us... before he says, ‘If you guys don’t have any plans, why don’t you come along? After all, what’s the point of travelling if there ain’t a little danger involved?’  

Expecting someone in the group to tell him we already had plans, Tyler, Chris and Brodie share a look to one another - and to mine and Hayley’s surprise... they then agreed... Hayley obviously protested. She didn’t want to go gallivanting around the jungle where tourists supposedly vanished.  

‘Oh, come on Hayl’. It’ll be fun... Sarah? You’ll come, won’t you?’ 

‘Yeah. Johnny Utah wants to come, right?’  

Hayley stared at me, clearly desperate for me to take her side. I then glanced around the table to see so too was everyone else. Neither wanting to take sides or accept the invitation, all I could say was that I didn’t know what I wanted to do. 

Although Hayley and the guys were divided on whether or not to accompany Aaron’s expedition, it was ultimately left to a majority vote – and being too sheepish to protest, it now appeared our plans of travelling the country had changed to exploring the jungles of Central Vietnam... Even though I really didn’t want to go on this expedition – it could have been dangerous after all, I then reminded myself why I came to Vietnam in the first place... To have memorable and life changing experiences – and I wasn’t going to have any of that if I just said no when the opportunity arrived. Besides, tourists may well have gone missing in the region, but the supposed legends of jungle-dwelling creatures were probably nothing more than just stories. I spent my whole life believing in stories that turned out not to be true and I wasn’t going to let that continue now. 

Later that night, while Brodie and Hayley spent some alone time, and Chris was with Aaron’s friends (smoking you know what), Tyler invited me for a walk on the beach under the moonlight. Strolling barefoot along the beach, trying not to step on any garbage, Tyler asks me if I’m really ok with tomorrow’s plans – and that I shouldn’t feel peer-pressured into doing anything I didn’t really wanna do. I told him I was ok with it and that it should be fun.  

‘Don’t worry’ he said, ‘I’ll keep an eye on you.’ 

I’m a little embarrassed to admit this... but I kinda had a crush on Tyler. He was tall, handsome and adventurous. If anything, he was the sort of person I wanted to be: travelling the world and meeting all kinds of people from all kinds of places. I was a little worried he’d find me boring - a small city girl whose only other travel story was a premature mission to Florida. Well soon enough, I was going to have a whole new travel story... This travel story. 

We get up early the next morning, and meeting Aaron with his documentary crew, we each take separate taxis out of Biển Hứa Hẹn. Following the cab in front of us, we weren’t even sure where we were going exactly. Curving along a highway which cuts through a dense valley, Aaron’s taxi suddenly pulls up on the curve, where he and his team jump out to the beeping of angry motorcycle drivers. Flagging our taxi down, Aaron tells us that according to his directions, we have to cut through the valley here and head into the jungle. 

Although we didn’t really know what was going to happen on this trip – we were just along for the ride after all, Aaron’s plan was to hike through the jungle to find the mysterious trail, document whatever they could, and then move onto a group of cave-systems where these “creatures” were supposed to lurk. Reaching our way down the slope of the valley, we follow along a narrow stream which acted as our temporary trail. Although this was Aaron’s expedition, as soon as we start our hike through the jungle, Chris rather mockingly calls out, ‘Alright everyone. Keep a lookout for Lizard People, Bigfoot and Charlie’ where again, I thought to myself, “Who the heck is Charlie?”  ",1,1743195437.0,TheDarkGathering,1,1.0,False

	•	I ride motorcycles and may or may not have a slight speed addiction. Bonus points if you also ride

	•	I love deep conversations, chaotic adventures, and that feeling when you find someone who just gets you.

	•	I’m into spontaneous plans, like deciding on a whim to go for a late-night ride or go grab coffee. I think life is more fun when things aren’t too planned out.

I (38M) just found out that my wife (36F) has been CHEATING on me… for *years*. Like, I’m genuinely upset. I thought we had trust. I thought we had honesty. Turns out, she’s been living a DOUBLE LIFE behind my back.

Every morning for the last 6 years, she’s told me she makes our coffee with the *French press*. She KNOWS I’m a French press guy. I go around telling people, “We’re a French press household. No drip. No pods. Just beans, love, and pressure.”

WELL GUESS WHAT.

Today I walk into the kitchen early and catch her using a KEURIG. A. FREAKING. KEURIG.

There was a stash of pods hidden in the back of the cabinet like some kind of caffeinated contraband. She even had secret seasonal flavors. Pumpkin spice. Hazelnut. Things she *knows* I call “hipster bean blasphemy.”

Y’all. She has been waking up early, making her pod coffee, dumping it into the French press to “marinate” it, and THEN serving it to me so I *think* it’s legit.

I’m SHOOK.

I feel like my whole marriage is a lie. Who IS this woman?? What ELSE is she hiding?? Is she secretly a tea drinker too?? Is this why the barista at Starbucks always smirks at me when I order?

Anyway. I’m sleeping on the couch tonight. Not because we’re fighting, but because the couch is closer to the fridge and I need to emotionally eat an entire pint of ice cream.

Send help. And maybe a real French press.

Looks to have upgraded parts, greater durability, and some improved looks. 

(Apparently my post is too short so I'll copy part of the website text below)

9Barista produces authentic espresso by using a revolutionary, patented technology that sets it apart from all other espresso machines.

At its heart is a unique twin-boiler system. One boiler sets the brewing pressure, while the second regulates the brewing temperature. 

The high-pressure boiler is heated on a stove-top until it reaches 179ºC, increasing the pressure inside to 9 bar. As the boiler approaches the ideal brewing pressure, a spring-loaded valve opens, allowing water to flow from the high-pressure boiler into the coil heat exchanger. 

As the high-pressure water from the first boiler passes through the coil, it is cooled from 179ºC to 100ºC while maintaining pressure. The water then passes through the fin heat exchanger, where it is cooled further to 93ºC.

Now the water is at the correct pressure and temperature to pass through the ground coffee, producing a perfect crema-cloaked espresso in the cup at the top.",20,1743195161.0,espresso,2,0.95,False
1jm5c9t,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1jm5c9t/i_was_an_english_teacher_in_vietnam_i_will_never/,I Was an English Teacher in Vietnam... I Will Never Step Foot Inside a Jungle Again - Part 1 of 2,"My name is Sarah Branch. A few years ago, when I was 24 years old, I had left my home state of Utah and moved abroad to work as an English language teacher in Vietnam. Having just graduated BYU and earning my degree in teaching, I suddenly realized I needed so much more from my life. I always wanted to travel, embrace other cultures, and most of all, have memorable and life-changing experiences.  

Feeling trapped in my normal, everyday life outside of Salt Lake City, where winters are cold and summers always far away, I decided I was no longer going to live the life that others had chosen for me, and instead choose my own path in life – a life of fulfilment and little regrets. Already attaining my degree in teaching, I realized if I gained a further ESL Certification (teaching English as a second language), I could finally achieve my lifelong dream of travelling the world to far-away and exotic places – all the while working for a reasonable income. 

There were so many places I dreamed of going – maybe somewhere in South America or far east Asia. As long as the weather was warm and there were beautiful beaches for me to soak up the sun, I honestly did not mind. Scanning my finger over a map of the world, rotating from one hemisphere to the other, I eventually put my finger down on a narrow, little country called Vietnam. This was by no means a random choice. I had always wanted to travel to Vietnam because... I’m actually one-quarter Vietnamese. Not that you can tell or anything - my hair is brown and my skin is rather fair. But I figured, if I wanted to go where the sun was always shining, and there was an endless supply of tropical beaches, Vietnam would be the perfect destination! Furthermore, I’d finally get the chance to explore my heritage. 

Fortunately enough for me, it turned out Vietnam had a huge demand for English language teachers. They did prefer it if you were teaching in the country already - but after a few online interviews and some Visa complications later, I packed up my things in Utah and moved across the world to the Land of the Blue Dragon.  

I was relocated to a beautiful beach town in Central Vietnam, right along the coast of the South China Sea. English teachers don’t really get to choose where in the country they end up, but if I did have that option, I could not have picked a more perfect place... Because of the horrific turn this story will take, I can’t say where exactly it was in Central Vietnam I lived, or even the name of the beach town I resided in - just because I don’t want anyone to get the wrong idea. This part of Vietnam is a truly beautiful place and I don’t want to discourage anyone from going there. So, for the continuation of this story, I’m just going to refer to where I was as Central Vietnam – and as for the beach town where I made my living, I’m going to give it the pseudonym “Biển Hứa Hẹn” - which in Vietnamese, roughly, but rather fittingly translates to “Sea of Promise.”   

Biển Hứa Hẹn truly was the most perfect destination! It was a modest sized coastal town, nestled inside of a tropical bay, with the whitest sands and clearest blue waters you could possibly dream of. The town itself is also spectacular. Most of the houses and buildings are painted a vibrant sunny yellow, not only to look more inviting to tourists, but so to reflect the sun during the hottest months. For this reason, I originally wanted to give the town the nickname “Trấn Màu Vàng” (Yellow Town), but I quickly realized how insensitive that pseudonym would have been – so “Sea of Promise” it is!  

Alongside its bright, sunny buildings, Biển Hứa Hẹn has the most stunning oriental and French Colonial architecture – interspersed with many quality restaurants and coffee shops. The local cuisine is to die for! Not only is it healthy and delicious, but it's also surprisingly cheap – like we’re only talking 90 cents! You wouldn’t believe how many different flavours of Coffee Vietnam has. I mean, I went a whole 24 years without even trying coffee, and since I’ve been here, I must have tried around two-dozen flavours. Another whimsy little aspect of this town is the many multi-coloured, little plastic chairs that are dispersed everywhere. So whether it was dining on the local cuisine or trying my twenty-second flavour of coffee, I would always find one of these chairs – a different colour every time, sit down in the shade and just watch the world go by. 

I haven’t even mentioned how much I loved my teaching job. My classes were the most adorable 7 and 8 year-olds, and my colleagues were so nice and welcoming. They never called me by my first name. Instead my colleagues would always say “Chào em” or “Chào em gái”, which basically means “Hello little sister.”  

When I wasn’t teaching or grading papers, I spent most of my leisure time by the town’s beach - and being the boring, vanilla person I am, I didn’t really do much. Feeling the sun upon my skin while I observed the breath-taking scenery was more than enough – either that or I was curled up in a good book... I was never the only foreigner on this beach. Biển Hứa Hẹn is a popular tourist destination – mostly Western backpackers and surfers. So, if I wasn’t turning pink beneath the sun or memorizing every little detail of the bay’s geography, I would enviously spectate fellow travellers ride the waves. 

As much as I love Vietnam - as much as I love Biển Hứa Hẹn, what really spoils this place from being the perfect paradise is all the garbage pollution. I mean, it’s just everywhere. There is garbage in the town, on the beach and even in the ocean – and if it isn’t the garbage that spoils everything, it certainly is all the rats, cockroaches and other vermin brought with it. Biển Hứa Hẹn is such a unique place and it honestly makes me so mad that no one does anything about it... Nevertheless, I still love it here. It will always be a paradise to me – and if America was the Promised Land for Lehi and his descendants, then this was going to be my Promised Land.  

I had now been living in Biển Hứa Hẹn for 4 months, and although I had only 3 months left in my teaching contract, I still planned on staying in Vietnam - even if that meant leaving this region I’d fallen in love with and relocating to another part of the country. Since I was going to stay, I decided I really needed to learn Vietnamese – as you’d be surprised how few people there are in Vietnam who can speak any to no English. Although most English teachers in South-East Asia use their leisure time to travel, I rather boringly decided to spend most of my days at the same beach, sat amongst the sand while I studied and practised what would hopefully become my second language. 

On one of those days, I must have been completely occupied in my own world, because when I look up, I suddenly see someone standing over, talking down to me. I take off my headphones, and shading the sun from my eyes, I see a tall, late-twenty-something tourist - wearing only swim shorts and cradling a surfboard beneath his arm. Having come in from the surf, he thought I said something to him as he passed by, where I then told him I was speaking Vietnamese to myself, and didn’t realize anyone could hear me. We both had a good laugh about it and the guy introduces himself as Tyler. Like me, Tyler was American, and unsurprisingly, he was from California. He came to Vietnam for no other reason than to surf. Like I said, Tyler was this tall, very tanned guy – like he was the tannest guy I had ever seen. He had all these different tattoos he acquired from his travels, and long brown hair, which he regularly wore in a man-bun. When I first saw him standing there, I was taken back a little, because I almost mistook him as Jesus Christ – that's what he looked like. Tyler asks what I’m doing in Vietnam and later in the conversation, he invites me to have a drink with him and his surfer buddies at the beach town bar. I was a little hesitant to say yes, only because I don’t really drink alcohol, but Tyler seemed like a nice guy and so I agreed.  

Later that day, I meet Tyler at the bar and he introduces me to his three surfer friends. The first of Tyler’s friends was Chris, who he knew from back home. Chris was kinda loud and a little obnoxious, but I suppose he was also funny. The other two friends were Brodie and Hayley - a couple from New Zealand. Tyler and Chris met them while surfing in Australia – and ever since, the four of them have been travelling, or more accurately, surfing the world together. Over a few drinks, we all get to know each other a little better and I told them what it’s like to teach English in Vietnam. Curious as to how they’re able to travel so much, I ask them what they all do for a living. Tyler says they work as vloggers, bloggers and general content creators, all the while travelling to a different country every other month. You wouldn’t believe the number of places they’ve been to: Hawaii, Costa Rica, Sri Lanka, Bali – everywhere! They didn’t see the value of staying in just one place and working a menial job, when they could be living their best lives, all the while being their own bosses. It did make a lot of sense to me, and was not that unsimilar to my reasoning for being in Vietnam.  

The four of them were only going to be in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple more days, but when I told them I hadn’t yet explored the rest of the country, they insisted that I tag along with them. I did come to Vietnam to travel, not just stay in one place – the only problem was I didn’t have anyone to do it with... But I guess now I did. They even invited me to go surfing with them the next day. Having never surfed a day in my life, I very nearly declined the offer, but coming all this way from cold and boring Utah, I knew I had to embrace new and exciting opportunities whenever they arrived. 

By early next morning, and pushing through my first hangover, I had officially surfed my first ever wave. I was a little afraid I’d embarrass myself – especially in front of Tyler, but after a few trials and errors, I thankfully gained the hang of it. Even though I was a newbie at surfing, I could not have been that bad, because as soon as I surf my first successful wave, Chris would not stop calling me “Johnny Utah” - not that I knew what that meant. If I wasn’t embarrassing myself on a board, I definitely was in my ignorance of the guys’ casual movie quotes. For instance, whenever someone yelled out “Charlie Don’t Surf!” all I could think was, “Who the heck is Charlie?” 

By that afternoon, we were all back at the bar and I got to spend some girl time with Hayley. She was so kind to me and seemed to take a genuine interest in my life - or maybe she was just grateful not to be the only girl in the group anymore. She did tell me she thought Chris was extremely annoying, no matter where they were in the world - and even though Brodie was the quiet, sensible type for the most part, she hated how he acted when he was around the guys. Five beers later and Brodie was suddenly on his feet, doing some kind of native New Zealand war dance while Chris or Tyler vlogged. 

Although I was having such a wonderful time with the four of them, anticipating all the places in Vietnam Hayley said we were going, in the corner of my eye, I kept seeing the same strange man staring over at us. I thought maybe we were being too loud and he wanted to say something, but the man was instead looking at all of us with intrigue. Well, 10 minutes later, this very same man comes up to us with three strangers behind him. Very casually, he asks if we’re all having a good time. We kind of awkwardly oblige the man. A fellow traveller like us, who although was probably in his early thirties, looked more like a middle-aged dad on vacation - in an overly large Hawaiian shirt, as though to hide his stomach, and looking down at us through a pair of brainiac glasses. The strangers behind him were two other men and a young woman. One of the men was extremely hairy, with a beard almost as long as his own hair – while the other was very cleanly presented, short in height and holding a notepad. The young woman with them, who was not much older than myself, had a cool combination of dyed maroon hair and sleeve tattoos – although rather oddly, she was wearing way too much clothing for this climate. After some brief pleasantries, the man in the Hawaiian shirt then says, ‘I’m sorry to bother you folks, but I was wondering if we could ask you a few questions?’ 

Introducing himself as Aaron, the man tells us that he and his friends are documentary filmmakers, and were wanting to know what we knew of the local disappearances. Clueless as to what he was talking about, Aaron then sits down, without invitation at our rather small table, and starts explaining to us that for the past thirty years, tourists in the area have been mysteriously going missing without a trace. First time they were hearing of this, Tyler tells Aaron they have only been in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple of days. Since I was the one who lived and worked in the town, Hayley asks me if I knew anything of the missing tourists - and when she does, Aaron turns his full attention on me. Answering his many questions, I told Aaron I only heard in passing that tourists have allegedly gone missing, but wasn’t sure what to make of it. But while I’m telling him this, I notice the short guy behind him is writing everything I say down, word for word – before Aaron then asks me, with desperation in his voice, ‘Well, have you at least heard of the local legends?’  

Suddenly gaining an interest in what Aaron’s telling us, Tyler, Chris and Brodie drunkenly inquire, ‘Legends? What local legends?’ 

Taking another sip from his light beer, Aaron tells us that according to these legends, there are creatures lurking deep within the jungles and cave-systems of the region, and for centuries, local farmers or fishermen have only seen glimpses of them... Feeling as though we’re being told a scary bedtime story, Chris rather excitedly asks, ‘Well, what do these creatures look like?’ Aaron says the legends abbreviate and there are many claims to their appearance, but that they’re always described as being humanoid.   

Whatever these creatures were, paranormal communities and investigators have linked these legends to the disappearances of the tourists. All five of us realized just how silly this all sounded, which Brodie highlighted by saying, ‘You don’t actually believe that shite, do you?’ 

Without saying either yes or no, Aaron smirks at us, before revealing there are actually similar legends and sightings all around Central Vietnam – even by American soldiers as far back as the Vietnam War.  

‘You really don’t know about the cryptids of the Vietnam War?’ Aaron asks us, as though surprised we didn’t.  

Further educating us on this whole mystery, Aaron claims that during the war, several platoons and individual soldiers who were deployed in the jungles, came in contact with more than one type of creature.  

‘You never heard of the Rock Apes? The Devil Creatures of Quang Binh? The Big Yellows?’ 

If you were like us, and never heard of these creatures either, apparently what the American soldiers encountered in the jungles was a group of small Bigfoot-like creatures, that liked to throw rocks, and some sort of Lizard People, that glowed a luminous yellow and lived deep within the cave systems. 

Feeling somewhat ridiculous just listening to this, Tyler rather mockingly comments, ‘So, you’re saying you believe the reason for all the tourists going missing is because of Vietnamese Bigfoot and Lizard People?’ 

Aaron and his friends must have received this ridicule a lot, because rather than being insulted, they looked somewhat amused.  

‘Well, that’s why we’re here’ he says. ‘We’re paranormal investigators and filmmakers – and as far as we know, no one has tried to solve the mystery of the Vietnam Triangle. We’re in Biển Hứa Hẹn to interview locals on what they know of the disappearances, and we’ll follow any leads from there.’ 

Although I thought this all to be a little kooky, I tried to show a little respect and interest in what these guys did for a living – but not Tyler, Chris or Brodie. They were clearly trying to have fun at Aaron’s expense.  

‘So, what did the locals say? Is there a Vietnamese Loch Ness Monster we haven’t heard of?’  

Like I said, Aaron was well acquainted with this kind of ridicule, because rather spontaneously he replies, ‘Glad you asked!’ before gulping down the rest of his low-carb beer. ‘According to a group of fishermen we interviewed yesterday, there’s an unmapped trail that runs through the nearby jungles. Apparently, no one knows where this trail leads to - not even the locals do. And anyone who tries to find out for themselves... are never seen or heard from again.’ 

As amusing as we found these legends of ape-creatures and lizard-men, hearing there was a secret trail somewhere in the nearby jungles, where tourists are said to vanish - even if this was just a local legend... it was enough to unsettle all of us. Maybe there weren’t creatures abducting tourists in the jungles, but on an unmarked wilderness trail, anyone not familiar with the terrain could easily lose their way. Neither Tyler, Chris, Brodie or Hayley had a comment for this - after all, they were fellow travellers. As fun as their lifestyle was, they knew the dangers of venturing the more untamed corners of the world. The five of us just sat there, silently, not really knowing what to say, as Aaron very contentedly mused over us. 

‘We’re actually heading out tomorrow in search of the trail – we have directions and everything.’ Aaron then pauses on us... before he says, ‘If you guys don’t have any plans, why don’t you come along? After all, what’s the point of travelling if there ain’t a little danger involved?’  

Expecting someone in the group to tell him we already had plans, Tyler, Chris and Brodie share a look to one another - and to mine and Hayley’s surprise... they then agreed... Hayley obviously protested. She didn’t want to go gallivanting around the jungle where tourists supposedly vanished.  

‘Oh, come on Hayl’. It’ll be fun... Sarah? You’ll come, won’t you?’ 

‘Yeah. Johnny Utah wants to come, right?’  

Hayley stared at me, clearly desperate for me to take her side. I then glanced around the table to see so too was everyone else. Neither wanting to take sides or accept the invitation, all I could say was that I didn’t know what I wanted to do. 

Although Hayley and the guys were divided on whether or not to accompany Aaron’s expedition, it was ultimately left to a majority vote – and being too sheepish to protest, it now appeared our plans of travelling the country had changed to exploring the jungles of Central Vietnam... Even though I really didn’t want to go on this expedition – it could have been dangerous after all, I then reminded myself why I came to Vietnam in the first place... To have memorable and life changing experiences – and I wasn’t going to have any of that if I just said no when the opportunity arrived. Besides, tourists may well have gone missing in the region, but the supposed legends of jungle-dwelling creatures were probably nothing more than just stories. I spent my whole life believing in stories that turned out not to be true and I wasn’t going to let that continue now. 

Later that night, while Brodie and Hayley spent some alone time, and Chris was with Aaron’s friends (smoking you know what), Tyler invited me for a walk on the beach under the moonlight. Strolling barefoot along the beach, trying not to step on any garbage, Tyler asks me if I’m really ok with tomorrow’s plans – and that I shouldn’t feel peer-pressured into doing anything I didn’t really wanna do. I told him I was ok with it and that it should be fun.  

‘Don’t worry’ he said, ‘I’ll keep an eye on you.’ 

I’m a little embarrassed to admit this... but I kinda had a crush on Tyler. He was tall, handsome and adventurous. If anything, he was the sort of person I wanted to be: travelling the world and meeting all kinds of people from all kinds of places. I was a little worried he’d find me boring - a small city girl whose only other travel story was a premature mission to Florida. Well soon enough, I was going to have a whole new travel story... This travel story. 

We get up early the next morning, and meeting Aaron with his documentary crew, we each take separate taxis out of Biển Hứa Hẹn. Following the cab in front of us, we weren’t even sure where we were going exactly. Curving along a highway which cuts through a dense valley, Aaron’s taxi suddenly pulls up on the curve, where he and his team jump out to the beeping of angry motorcycle drivers. Flagging our taxi down, Aaron tells us that according to his directions, we have to cut through the valley here and head into the jungle. 

Although we didn’t really know what was going to happen on this trip – we were just along for the ride after all, Aaron’s plan was to hike through the jungle to find the mysterious trail, document whatever they could, and then move onto a group of cave-systems where these “creatures” were supposed to lurk. Reaching our way down the slope of the valley, we follow along a narrow stream which acted as our temporary trail. Although this was Aaron’s expedition, as soon as we start our hike through the jungle, Chris rather mockingly calls out, ‘Alright everyone. Keep a lookout for Lizard People, Bigfoot and Charlie’ where again, I thought to myself, “Who the heck is Charlie?”  ",3,1743195147.0,TheCrypticCompendium,1,1.0,False

This mostly happens on the cold coffee setting. I’ve cleaned the needles, descaled, and done full troubleshooting with Keurig, but nothing fixed it.

Finally back in the serving game after being stuck at a coffee shop for 9 long months. My old danskos were the slip on kind that weren’t the clogs & I remember them hurting for a hot min, but eventually felt super great. I’ve got my back problems like most of us do, so these shoes I know have worked well for me in the past.

I had to buy a new pair because when I pulled the old ones out that I wore for about a year & a half they were literally talking…. So, this time I decided to try the patten black clogs. 2nd wearing them & dayum I am blisteringgggg. It didn’t help that I chose to work a double the first time wearing them this past Wednesday. So, any tips to help speed up the breaking in process?

Also- I normally am a size 8, but my heel was literally going to fly out of those & that’s how my last pair was too (which is why I’ve gotten a 7.5 instead for this pair & the last one). Heel still slips out, but just feels like it fits better. So yeah I do know I got the right size for me. ",1,1743194823.0,Serverlife,1,1.0,False

I Will Never Step Foot Inside a Jungle Again - Part 1 of 2,"My name is Sarah Branch. A few years ago, when I was 24 years old, I had left my home state of Utah and moved abroad to work as an English language teacher in Vietnam. Having just graduated BYU and earning my degree in teaching, I suddenly realized I needed so much more from my life. I always wanted to travel, embrace other cultures, and most of all, have memorable and life-changing experiences.  

Feeling trapped in my normal, everyday life outside of Salt Lake City, where winters are cold and summers always far away, I decided I was no longer going to live the life that others had chosen for me, and instead choose my own path in life – a life of fulfilment and little regrets. Already attaining my degree in teaching, I realized if I gained a further ESL Certification (teaching English as a second language), I could finally achieve my lifelong dream of travelling the world to far-away and exotic places – all the while working for a reasonable income. 

There were so many places I dreamed of going – maybe somewhere in South America or far east Asia. As long as the weather was warm and there were beautiful beaches for me to soak up the sun, I honestly did not mind. Scanning my finger over a map of the world, rotating from one hemisphere to the other, I eventually put my finger down on a narrow, little country called Vietnam. This was by no means a random choice. I had always wanted to travel to Vietnam because... I’m actually one-quarter Vietnamese. Not that you can tell or anything - my hair is brown and my skin is rather fair. But I figured, if I wanted to go where the sun was always shining, and there was an endless supply of tropical beaches, Vietnam would be the perfect destination! Furthermore, I’d finally get the chance to explore my heritage. 

Fortunately enough for me, it turned out Vietnam had a huge demand for English language teachers. They did prefer it if you were teaching in the country already - but after a few online interviews and some Visa complications later, I packed up my things in Utah and moved across the world to the Land of the Blue Dragon.  

I was relocated to a beautiful beach town in Central Vietnam, right along the coast of the South China Sea. English teachers don’t really get to choose where in the country they end up, but if I did have that option, I could not have picked a more perfect place... Because of the horrific turn this story will take, I can’t say where exactly it was in Central Vietnam I lived, or even the name of the beach town I resided in - just because I don’t want anyone to get the wrong idea. This part of Vietnam is a truly beautiful place and I don’t want to discourage anyone from going there. So, for the continuation of this story, I’m just going to refer to where I was as Central Vietnam – and as for the beach town where I made my living, I’m going to give it the pseudonym “Biển Hứa Hẹn” - which in Vietnamese, roughly, but rather fittingly translates to “Sea of Promise.”   

Biển Hứa Hẹn truly was the most perfect destination! It was a modest sized coastal town, nestled inside of a tropical bay, with the whitest sands and clearest blue waters you could possibly dream of. The town itself is also spectacular. Most of the houses and buildings are painted a vibrant sunny yellow, not only to look more inviting to tourists, but so to reflect the sun during the hottest months. For this reason, I originally wanted to give the town the nickname “Trấn Màu Vàng” (Yellow Town), but I quickly realized how insensitive that pseudonym would have been – so “Sea of Promise” it is!  

Alongside its bright, sunny buildings, Biển Hứa Hẹn has the most stunning oriental and French Colonial architecture – interspersed with many quality restaurants and coffee shops. The local cuisine is to die for! Not only is it healthy and delicious, but it's also surprisingly cheap – like we’re only talking 90 cents! You wouldn’t believe how many different flavours of Coffee Vietnam has. I mean, I went a whole 24 years without even trying coffee, and since I’ve been here, I must have tried around two-dozen flavours. Another whimsy little aspect of this town is the many multi-coloured, little plastic chairs that are dispersed everywhere. So whether it was dining on the local cuisine or trying my twenty-second flavour of coffee, I would always find one of these chairs – a different colour every time, sit down in the shade and just watch the world go by. 

I haven’t even mentioned how much I loved my teaching job. My classes were the most adorable 7 and 8 year-olds, and my colleagues were so nice and welcoming. They never called me by my first name. Instead my colleagues would always say “Chào em” or “Chào em gái”, which basically means “Hello little sister.”  

When I wasn’t teaching or grading papers, I spent most of my leisure time by the town’s beach - and being the boring, vanilla person I am, I didn’t really do much. Feeling the sun upon my skin while I observed the breath-taking scenery was more than enough – either that or I was curled up in a good book... I was never the only foreigner on this beach. Biển Hứa Hẹn is a popular tourist destination – mostly Western backpackers and surfers. So, if I wasn’t turning pink beneath the sun or memorizing every little detail of the bay’s geography, I would enviously spectate fellow travellers ride the waves. 

As much as I love Vietnam - as much as I love Biển Hứa Hẹn, what really spoils this place from being the perfect paradise is all the garbage pollution. I mean, it’s just everywhere. There is garbage in the town, on the beach and even in the ocean – and if it isn’t the garbage that spoils everything, it certainly is all the rats, cockroaches and other vermin brought with it. Biển Hứa Hẹn is such a unique place and it honestly makes me so mad that no one does anything about it... Nevertheless, I still love it here. It will always be a paradise to me – and if America was the Promised Land for Lehi and his descendants, then this was going to be my Promised Land.  

I had now been living in Biển Hứa Hẹn for 4 months, and although I had only 3 months left in my teaching contract, I still planned on staying in Vietnam - even if that meant leaving this region I’d fallen in love with and relocating to another part of the country. Since I was going to stay, I decided I really needed to learn Vietnamese – as you’d be surprised how few people there are in Vietnam who can speak any to no English. Although most English teachers in South-East Asia use their leisure time to travel, I rather boringly decided to spend most of my days at the same beach, sat amongst the sand while I studied and practised what would hopefully become my second language. 

On one of those days, I must have been completely occupied in my own world, because when I look up, I suddenly see someone standing over, talking down to me. I take off my headphones, and shading the sun from my eyes, I see a tall, late-twenty-something tourist - wearing only swim shorts and cradling a surfboard beneath his arm. Having come in from the surf, he thought I said something to him as he passed by, where I then told him I was speaking Vietnamese to myself, and didn’t realize anyone could hear me. We both had a good laugh about it and the guy introduces himself as Tyler. Like me, Tyler was American, and unsurprisingly, he was from California. He came to Vietnam for no other reason than to surf. Like I said, Tyler was this tall, very tanned guy – like he was the tannest guy I had ever seen. He had all these different tattoos he acquired from his travels, and long brown hair, which he regularly wore in a man-bun. When I first saw him standing there, I was taken back a little, because I almost mistook him as Jesus Christ – that's what he looked like. Tyler asks what I’m doing in Vietnam and later in the conversation, he invites me to have a drink with him and his surfer buddies at the beach town bar. I was a little hesitant to say yes, only because I don’t really drink alcohol, but Tyler seemed like a nice guy and so I agreed.  

Later that day, I meet Tyler at the bar and he introduces me to his three surfer friends. The first of Tyler’s friends was Chris, who he knew from back home. Chris was kinda loud and a little obnoxious, but I suppose he was also funny. The other two friends were Brodie and Hayley - a couple from New Zealand. Tyler and Chris met them while surfing in Australia – and ever since, the four of them have been travelling, or more accurately, surfing the world together. Over a few drinks, we all get to know each other a little better and I told them what it’s like to teach English in Vietnam. Curious as to how they’re able to travel so much, I ask them what they all do for a living. Tyler says they work as vloggers, bloggers and general content creators, all the while travelling to a different country every other month. You wouldn’t believe the number of places they’ve been to: Hawaii, Costa Rica, Sri Lanka, Bali – everywhere! They didn’t see the value of staying in just one place and working a menial job, when they could be living their best lives, all the while being their own bosses. It did make a lot of sense to me, and was not that unsimilar to my reasoning for being in Vietnam.  

The four of them were only going to be in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple more days, but when I told them I hadn’t yet explored the rest of the country, they insisted that I tag along with them. I did come to Vietnam to travel, not just stay in one place – the only problem was I didn’t have anyone to do it with... But I guess now I did. They even invited me to go surfing with them the next day. Having never surfed a day in my life, I very nearly declined the offer, but coming all this way from cold and boring Utah, I knew I had to embrace new and exciting opportunities whenever they arrived. 

By early next morning, and pushing through my first hangover, I had officially surfed my first ever wave. I was a little afraid I’d embarrass myself – especially in front of Tyler, but after a few trials and errors, I thankfully gained the hang of it. Even though I was a newbie at surfing, I could not have been that bad, because as soon as I surf my first successful wave, Chris would not stop calling me “Johnny Utah” - not that I knew what that meant. If I wasn’t embarrassing myself on a board, I definitely was in my ignorance of the guys’ casual movie quotes. For instance, whenever someone yelled out “Charlie Don’t Surf!” all I could think was, “Who the heck is Charlie?” 

By that afternoon, we were all back at the bar and I got to spend some girl time with Hayley. She was so kind to me and seemed to take a genuine interest in my life - or maybe she was just grateful not to be the only girl in the group anymore. She did tell me she thought Chris was extremely annoying, no matter where they were in the world - and even though Brodie was the quiet, sensible type for the most part, she hated how he acted when he was around the guys. Five beers later and Brodie was suddenly on his feet, doing some kind of native New Zealand war dance while Chris or Tyler vlogged. 

Although I was having such a wonderful time with the four of them, anticipating all the places in Vietnam Hayley said we were going, in the corner of my eye, I kept seeing the same strange man staring over at us. I thought maybe we were being too loud and he wanted to say something, but the man was instead looking at all of us with intrigue. Well, 10 minutes later, this very same man comes up to us with three strangers behind him. Very casually, he asks if we’re all having a good time. We kind of awkwardly oblige the man. A fellow traveller like us, who although was probably in his early thirties, looked more like a middle-aged dad on vacation - in an overly large Hawaiian shirt, as though to hide his stomach, and looking down at us through a pair of brainiac glasses. The strangers behind him were two other men and a young woman. One of the men was extremely hairy, with a beard almost as long as his own hair – while the other was very cleanly presented, short in height and holding a notepad. The young woman with them, who was not much older than myself, had a cool combination of dyed maroon hair and sleeve tattoos – although rather oddly, she was wearing way too much clothing for this climate. After some brief pleasantries, the man in the Hawaiian shirt then says, ‘I’m sorry to bother you folks, but I was wondering if we could ask you a few questions?’ 

Introducing himself as Aaron, the man tells us that he and his friends are documentary filmmakers, and were wanting to know what we knew of the local disappearances. Clueless as to what he was talking about, Aaron then sits down, without invitation at our rather small table, and starts explaining to us that for the past thirty years, tourists in the area have been mysteriously going missing without a trace. First time they were hearing of this, Tyler tells Aaron they have only been in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple of days. Since I was the one who lived and worked in the town, Hayley asks me if I knew anything of the missing tourists - and when she does, Aaron turns his full attention on me. Answering his many questions, I told Aaron I only heard in passing that tourists have allegedly gone missing, but wasn’t sure what to make of it. But while I’m telling him this, I notice the short guy behind him is writing everything I say down, word for word – before Aaron then asks me, with desperation in his voice, ‘Well, have you at least heard of the local legends?’  

Suddenly gaining an interest in what Aaron’s telling us, Tyler, Chris and Brodie drunkenly inquire, ‘Legends? What local legends?’ 

Taking another sip from his light beer, Aaron tells us that according to these legends, there are creatures lurking deep within the jungles and cave-systems of the region, and for centuries, local farmers or fishermen have only seen glimpses of them... Feeling as though we’re being told a scary bedtime story, Chris rather excitedly asks, ‘Well, what do these creatures look like?’ Aaron says the legends abbreviate and there are many claims to their appearance, but that they’re always described as being humanoid.   

Whatever these creatures were, paranormal communities and investigators have linked these legends to the disappearances of the tourists. All five of us realized just how silly this all sounded, which Brodie highlighted by saying, ‘You don’t actually believe that shite, do you?’ 

Without saying either yes or no, Aaron smirks at us, before revealing there are actually similar legends and sightings all around Central Vietnam – even by American soldiers as far back as the Vietnam War.  

‘You really don’t know about the cryptids of the Vietnam War?’ Aaron asks us, as though surprised we didn’t.  

Further educating us on this whole mystery, Aaron claims that during the war, several platoons and individual soldiers who were deployed in the jungles, came in contact with more than one type of creature.  

‘You never heard of the Rock Apes? The Devil Creatures of Quang Binh? The Big Yellows?’ 

If you were like us, and never heard of these creatures either, apparently what the American soldiers encountered in the jungles was a group of small Bigfoot-like creatures, that liked to throw rocks, and some sort of Lizard People, that glowed a luminous yellow and lived deep within the cave systems. 

Feeling somewhat ridiculous just listening to this, Tyler rather mockingly comments, ‘So, you’re saying you believe the reason for all the tourists going missing is because of Vietnamese Bigfoot and Lizard People?’ 

Aaron and his friends must have received this ridicule a lot, because rather than being insulted, they looked somewhat amused.  

‘Well, that’s why we’re here’ he says. ‘We’re paranormal investigators and filmmakers – and as far as we know, no one has tried to solve the mystery of the Vietnam Triangle. We’re in Biển Hứa Hẹn to interview locals on what they know of the disappearances, and we’ll follow any leads from there.’ 

Although I thought this all to be a little kooky, I tried to show a little respect and interest in what these guys did for a living – but not Tyler, Chris or Brodie. They were clearly trying to have fun at Aaron’s expense.  

‘So, what did the locals say? Is there a Vietnamese Loch Ness Monster we haven’t heard of?’  

Like I said, Aaron was well acquainted with this kind of ridicule, because rather spontaneously he replies, ‘Glad you asked!’ before gulping down the rest of his low-carb beer. ‘According to a group of fishermen we interviewed yesterday, there’s an unmapped trail that runs through the nearby jungles. Apparently, no one knows where this trail leads to - not even the locals do. And anyone who tries to find out for themselves... are never seen or heard from again.’ 

As amusing as we found these legends of ape-creatures and lizard-men, hearing there was a secret trail somewhere in the nearby jungles, where tourists are said to vanish - even if this was just a local legend... it was enough to unsettle all of us. Maybe there weren’t creatures abducting tourists in the jungles, but on an unmarked wilderness trail, anyone not familiar with the terrain could easily lose their way. Neither Tyler, Chris, Brodie or Hayley had a comment for this - after all, they were fellow travellers. As fun as their lifestyle was, they knew the dangers of venturing the more untamed corners of the world. The five of us just sat there, silently, not really knowing what to say, as Aaron very contentedly mused over us. 

‘We’re actually heading out tomorrow in search of the trail – we have directions and everything.’ Aaron then pauses on us... before he says, ‘If you guys don’t have any plans, why don’t you come along? After all, what’s the point of travelling if there ain’t a little danger involved?’  

Expecting someone in the group to tell him we already had plans, Tyler, Chris and Brodie share a look to one another - and to mine and Hayley’s surprise... they then agreed... Hayley obviously protested. She didn’t want to go gallivanting around the jungle where tourists supposedly vanished.  

‘Oh, come on Hayl’. It’ll be fun... Sarah? You’ll come, won’t you?’ 

‘Yeah. Johnny Utah wants to come, right?’  

Hayley stared at me, clearly desperate for me to take her side. I then glanced around the table to see so too was everyone else. Neither wanting to take sides or accept the invitation, all I could say was that I didn’t know what I wanted to do. 

Although Hayley and the guys were divided on whether or not to accompany Aaron’s expedition, it was ultimately left to a majority vote – and being too sheepish to protest, it now appeared our plans of travelling the country had changed to exploring the jungles of Central Vietnam... Even though I really didn’t want to go on this expedition – it could have been dangerous after all, I then reminded myself why I came to Vietnam in the first place... To have memorable and life changing experiences – and I wasn’t going to have any of that if I just said no when the opportunity arrived. Besides, tourists may well have gone missing in the region, but the supposed legends of jungle-dwelling creatures were probably nothing more than just stories. I spent my whole life believing in stories that turned out not to be true and I wasn’t going to let that continue now. 

Later that night, while Brodie and Hayley spent some alone time, and Chris was with Aaron’s friends (smoking you know what), Tyler invited me for a walk on the beach under the moonlight. Strolling barefoot along the beach, trying not to step on any garbage, Tyler asks me if I’m really ok with tomorrow’s plans – and that I shouldn’t feel peer-pressured into doing anything I didn’t really wanna do. I told him I was ok with it and that it should be fun.  

‘Don’t worry’ he said, ‘I’ll keep an eye on you.’ 

I’m a little embarrassed to admit this... but I kinda had a crush on Tyler. He was tall, handsome and adventurous. If anything, he was the sort of person I wanted to be: travelling the world and meeting all kinds of people from all kinds of places. I was a little worried he’d find me boring - a small city girl whose only other travel story was a premature mission to Florida. Well soon enough, I was going to have a whole new travel story... This travel story. 

We get up early the next morning, and meeting Aaron with his documentary crew, we each take separate taxis out of Biển Hứa Hẹn. Following the cab in front of us, we weren’t even sure where we were going exactly. Curving along a highway which cuts through a dense valley, Aaron’s taxi suddenly pulls up on the curve, where he and his team jump out to the beeping of angry motorcycle drivers. Flagging our taxi down, Aaron tells us that according to his directions, we have to cut through the valley here and head into the jungle. 

Although we didn’t really know what was going to happen on this trip – we were just along for the ride after all, Aaron’s plan was to hike through the jungle to find the mysterious trail, document whatever they could, and then move onto a group of cave-systems where these “creatures” were supposed to lurk. Reaching our way down the slope of the valley, we follow along a narrow stream which acted as our temporary trail. Although this was Aaron’s expedition, as soon as we start our hike through the jungle, Chris rather mockingly calls out, ‘Alright everyone. Keep a lookout for Lizard People, Bigfoot and Charlie’ where again, I thought to myself, “Who the heck is Charlie?”  ",5,1743194814.0,stories,1,1.0,False

Mr. B was the math teacher. He was smart, but also a smart ass. Very sarcastic and loved cracking jokes. With school done, and getting to hang out and do an activity I enjoyed, I was always happy and high in energy. I bought some chocolate chip cookies from the vending machine, but didn't have a drink to go along with it. You ever enjoying some delicious cookies and need some milk or something?

""Man, I'm thirsty!"" I said out loud. ""This is chocolatey!""

Now, I don't know about now, but back in my day™ they'd put transparent sheets over the overhead projector and write with marker. The teachers (especially in math classes) would spray a solution on the sheets and erase it.

Responding to my complaint of thirst, Mr. B offered me the spray. Now, the problem is... I thought it was water they sprayed on the sheets to erase them. 🤦🏿‍♂️ I grabbed the spray and sprayed it right in my mouth.  
You think taking a sip of a cup of coffee as a kid thinking it was *Coca Cola* sucked? You think biting into an oatmeal raisin cookie thinking it was chocolate chip sucked? Imagine consuming an alcohol based solution thinking it was water.

As soon as I sprayed it, I regretted it. My mouth turned numb and began to burn... Mr. B looked at me bewildered ""**What is wrong with you**?!!""

My tongue was numb... ""I thougth ith wath wather!"" (I thought it was water) I blurted out! I sprinted out of the room to go wash my mouth out with water.

When I returned I explained that I never knew it was an alcohol based solution. Mr. B asked me ""Did you learn a valuable lesson?""

""Yeah, not to trust you!"" I said.

""You should've already known that!"" He responded sarcastically. 🤓

Things went back to normal, I regained sensation in my tongue and played chess. During my match, Mr. B came over to our table, placed the Windex near us and said:

So whether it was dining on the local cuisine or trying my twenty-second flavour of coffee, I would always find one of these chairs – a different colour every time, sit down in the shade and just watch the world go by. 

I haven’t even mentioned how much I loved my teaching job. My classes were the most adorable 7 and 8 year-olds, and my colleagues were so nice and welcoming. They never called me by my first name. Instead my colleagues would always say “Chào em” or “Chào em gái”, which basically means “Hello little sister.”  

When I wasn’t teaching or grading papers, I spent most of my leisure time by the town’s beach - and being the boring, vanilla person I am, I didn’t really do much. Feeling the sun upon my skin while I observed the breath-taking scenery was more than enough – either that or I was curled up in a good book... I was never the only foreigner on this beach. Biển Hứa Hẹn is a popular tourist destination – mostly Western backpackers and surfers. So, if I wasn’t turning pink beneath the sun or memorizing every little detail of the bay’s geography, I would enviously spectate fellow travellers ride the waves. 

As much as I love Vietnam - as much as I love Biển Hứa Hẹn, what really spoils this place from being the perfect paradise is all the garbage pollution. I mean, it’s just everywhere. There is garbage in the town, on the beach and even in the ocean – and if it isn’t the garbage that spoils everything, it certainly is all the rats, cockroaches and other vermin brought with it. Biển Hứa Hẹn is such a unique place and it honestly makes me so mad that no one does anything about it... Nevertheless, I still love it here. It will always be a paradise to me – and if America was the Promised Land for Lehi and his descendants, then this was going to be my Promised Land.  

I had now been living in Biển Hứa Hẹn for 4 months, and although I had only 3 months left in my teaching contract, I still planned on staying in Vietnam - even if that meant leaving this region I’d fallen in love with and relocating to another part of the country. Since I was going to stay, I decided I really needed to learn Vietnamese – as you’d be surprised how few people there are in Vietnam who can speak any to no English. Although most English teachers in South-East Asia use their leisure time to travel, I rather boringly decided to spend most of my days at the same beach, sat amongst the sand while I studied and practised what would hopefully become my second language. 

On one of those days, I must have been completely occupied in my own world, because when I look up, I suddenly see someone standing over, talking down to me. I take off my headphones, and shading the sun from my eyes, I see a tall, late-twenty-something tourist - wearing only swim shorts and cradling a surfboard beneath his arm. Having come in from the surf, he thought I said something to him as he passed by, where I then told him I was speaking Vietnamese to myself, and didn’t realize anyone could hear me. We both had a good laugh about it and the guy introduces himself as Tyler. Like me, Tyler was American, and unsurprisingly, he was from California. He came to Vietnam for no other reason than to surf. Like I said, Tyler was this tall, very tanned guy – like he was the tannest guy I had ever seen. He had all these different tattoos he acquired from his travels, and long brown hair, which he regularly wore in a man-bun. When I first saw him standing there, I was taken back a little, because I almost mistook him as Jesus Christ – that's what he looked like. Tyler asks what I’m doing in Vietnam and later in the conversation, he invites me to have a drink with him and his surfer buddies at the beach town bar. I was a little hesitant to say yes, only because I don’t really drink alcohol, but Tyler seemed like a nice guy and so I agreed.  

Later that day, I meet Tyler at the bar and he introduces me to his three surfer friends. The first of Tyler’s friends was Chris, who he knew from back home. Chris was kinda loud and a little obnoxious, but I suppose he was also funny. The other two friends were Brodie and Hayley - a couple from New Zealand. Tyler and Chris met them while surfing in Australia – and ever since, the four of them have been travelling, or more accurately, surfing the world together. Over a few drinks, we all get to know each other a little better and I told them what it’s like to teach English in Vietnam. Curious as to how they’re able to travel so much, I ask them what they all do for a living. Tyler says they work as vloggers, bloggers and general content creators, all the while travelling to a different country every other month. You wouldn’t believe the number of places they’ve been to: Hawaii, Costa Rica, Sri Lanka, Bali – everywhere! They didn’t see the value of staying in just one place and working a menial job, when they could be living their best lives, all the while being their own bosses. It did make a lot of sense to me, and was not that unsimilar to my reasoning for being in Vietnam.  

The four of them were only going to be in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple more days, but when I told them I hadn’t yet explored the rest of the country, they insisted that I tag along with them. I did come to Vietnam to travel, not just stay in one place – the only problem was I didn’t have anyone to do it with... But I guess now I did. They even invited me to go surfing with them the next day. Having never surfed a day in my life, I very nearly declined the offer, but coming all this way from cold and boring Utah, I knew I had to embrace new and exciting opportunities whenever they arrived. 

By early next morning, and pushing through my first hangover, I had officially surfed my first ever wave. I was a little afraid I’d embarrass myself – especially in front of Tyler, but after a few trials and errors, I thankfully gained the hang of it. Even though I was a newbie at surfing, I could not have been that bad, because as soon as I surf my first successful wave, Chris would not stop calling me “Johnny Utah” - not that I knew what that meant. If I wasn’t embarrassing myself on a board, I definitely was in my ignorance of the guys’ casual movie quotes. For instance, whenever someone yelled out “Charlie Don’t Surf!” all I could think was, “Who the heck is Charlie?” 

By that afternoon, we were all back at the bar and I got to spend some girl time with Hayley. She was so kind to me and seemed to take a genuine interest in my life - or maybe she was just grateful not to be the only girl in the group anymore. She did tell me she thought Chris was extremely annoying, no matter where they were in the world - and even though Brodie was the quiet, sensible type for the most part, she hated how he acted when he was around the guys. Five beers later and Brodie was suddenly on his feet, doing some kind of native New Zealand war dance while Chris or Tyler vlogged. 

Although I was having such a wonderful time with the four of them, anticipating all the places in Vietnam Hayley said we were going, in the corner of my eye, I kept seeing the same strange man staring over at us. I thought maybe we were being too loud and he wanted to say something, but the man was instead looking at all of us with intrigue. Well, 10 minutes later, this very same man comes up to us with three strangers behind him. Very casually, he asks if we’re all having a good time. We kind of awkwardly oblige the man. A fellow traveller like us, who although was probably in his early thirties, looked more like a middle-aged dad on vacation - in an overly large Hawaiian shirt, as though to hide his stomach, and looking down at us through a pair of brainiac glasses. The strangers behind him were two other men and a young woman. One of the men was extremely hairy, with a beard almost as long as his own hair – while the other was very cleanly presented, short in height and holding a notepad. The young woman with them, who was not much older than myself, had a cool combination of dyed maroon hair and sleeve tattoos – although rather oddly, she was wearing way too much clothing for this climate. After some brief pleasantries, the man in the Hawaiian shirt then says, ‘I’m sorry to bother you folks, but I was wondering if we could ask you a few questions?’ 

Introducing himself as Aaron, the man tells us that he and his friends are documentary filmmakers, and were wanting to know what we knew of the local disappearances. Clueless as to what he was talking about, Aaron then sits down, without invitation at our rather small table, and starts explaining to us that for the past thirty years, tourists in the area have been mysteriously going missing without a trace. First time they were hearing of this, Tyler tells Aaron they have only been in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple of days. Since I was the one who lived and worked in the town, Hayley asks me if I knew anything of the missing tourists - and when she does, Aaron turns his full attention on me. Answering his many questions, I told Aaron I only heard in passing that tourists have allegedly gone missing, but wasn’t sure what to make of it. But while I’m telling him this, I notice the short guy behind him is writing everything I say down, word for word – before Aaron then asks me, with desperation in his voice, ‘Well, have you at least heard of the local legends?’  

Suddenly gaining an interest in what Aaron’s telling us, Tyler, Chris and Brodie drunkenly inquire, ‘Legends? What local legends?’ 

Taking another sip from his light beer, Aaron tells us that according to these legends, there are creatures lurking deep within the jungles and cave-systems of the region, and for centuries, local farmers or fishermen have only seen glimpses of them... Feeling as though we’re being told a scary bedtime story, Chris rather excitedly asks, ‘Well, what do these creatures look like?’ Aaron says the legends abbreviate and there are many claims to their appearance, but that they’re always described as being humanoid.   

Whatever these creatures were, paranormal communities and investigators have linked these legends to the disappearances of the tourists. All five of us realized just how silly this all sounded, which Brodie highlighted by saying, ‘You don’t actually believe that shite, do you?’ 

Without saying either yes or no, Aaron smirks at us, before revealing there are actually similar legends and sightings all around Central Vietnam – even by American soldiers as far back as the Vietnam War.  

‘You really don’t know about the cryptids of the Vietnam War?’ Aaron asks us, as though surprised we didn’t.  

Further educating us on this whole mystery, Aaron claims that during the war, several platoons and individual soldiers who were deployed in the jungles, came in contact with more than one type of creature.  

‘You never heard of the Rock Apes? The Devil Creatures of Quang Binh? The Big Yellows?’ 

If you were like us, and never heard of these creatures either, apparently what the American soldiers encountered in the jungles was a group of small Bigfoot-like creatures, that liked to throw rocks, and some sort of Lizard People, that glowed a luminous yellow and lived deep within the cave systems. 

Feeling somewhat ridiculous just listening to this, Tyler rather mockingly comments, ‘So, you’re saying you believe the reason for all the tourists going missing is because of Vietnamese Bigfoot and Lizard People?’ 

Aaron and his friends must have received this ridicule a lot, because rather than being insulted, they looked somewhat amused.  

‘Well, that’s why we’re here’ he says. ‘We’re paranormal investigators and filmmakers – and as far as we know, no one has tried to solve the mystery of the Vietnam Triangle. We’re in Biển Hứa Hẹn to interview locals on what they know of the disappearances, and we’ll follow any leads from there.’ 

Although I thought this all to be a little kooky, I tried to show a little respect and interest in what these guys did for a living – but not Tyler, Chris or Brodie. They were clearly trying to have fun at Aaron’s expense.  

‘So, what did the locals say? Is there a Vietnamese Loch Ness Monster we haven’t heard of?’  

Like I said, Aaron was well acquainted with this kind of ridicule, because rather spontaneously he replies, ‘Glad you asked!’ before gulping down the rest of his low-carb beer. ‘According to a group of fishermen we interviewed yesterday, there’s an unmapped trail that runs through the nearby jungles. Apparently, no one knows where this trail leads to - not even the locals do. And anyone who tries to find out for themselves... are never seen or heard from again.’ 

As amusing as we found these legends of ape-creatures and lizard-men, hearing there was a secret trail somewhere in the nearby jungles, where tourists are said to vanish - even if this was just a local legend... it was enough to unsettle all of us. Maybe there weren’t creatures abducting tourists in the jungles, but on an unmarked wilderness trail, anyone not familiar with the terrain could easily lose their way. Neither Tyler, Chris, Brodie or Hayley had a comment for this - after all, they were fellow travellers. As fun as their lifestyle was, they knew the dangers of venturing the more untamed corners of the world. The five of us just sat there, silently, not really knowing what to say, as Aaron very contentedly mused over us. 

‘We’re actually heading out tomorrow in search of the trail – we have directions and everything.’ Aaron then pauses on us... before he says, ‘If you guys don’t have any plans, why don’t you come along? After all, what’s the point of travelling if there ain’t a little danger involved?’  

Expecting someone in the group to tell him we already had plans, Tyler, Chris and Brodie share a look to one another - and to mine and Hayley’s surprise... they then agreed... Hayley obviously protested. She didn’t want to go gallivanting around the jungle where tourists supposedly vanished.  

‘Oh, come on Hayl’. It’ll be fun... Sarah? You’ll come, won’t you?’ 

‘Yeah. Johnny Utah wants to come, right?’  

Hayley stared at me, clearly desperate for me to take her side. I then glanced around the table to see so too was everyone else. Neither wanting to take sides or accept the invitation, all I could say was that I didn’t know what I wanted to do. 

Although Hayley and the guys were divided on whether or not to accompany Aaron’s expedition, it was ultimately left to a majority vote – and being too sheepish to protest, it now appeared our plans of travelling the country had changed to exploring the jungles of Central Vietnam... Even though I really didn’t want to go on this expedition – it could have been dangerous after all, I then reminded myself why I came to Vietnam in the first place... To have memorable and life changing experiences – and I wasn’t going to have any of that if I just said no when the opportunity arrived. Besides, tourists may well have gone missing in the region, but the supposed legends of jungle-dwelling creatures were probably nothing more than just stories. I spent my whole life believing in stories that turned out not to be true and I wasn’t going to let that continue now. 

Later that night, while Brodie and Hayley spent some alone time, and Chris was with Aaron’s friends (smoking you know what), Tyler invited me for a walk on the beach under the moonlight. Strolling barefoot along the beach, trying not to step on any garbage, Tyler asks me if I’m really ok with tomorrow’s plans – and that I shouldn’t feel peer-pressured into doing anything I didn’t really wanna do. I told him I was ok with it and that it should be fun.  

‘Don’t worry’ he said, ‘I’ll keep an eye on you.’ 

I’m a little embarrassed to admit this... but I kinda had a crush on Tyler. He was tall, handsome and adventurous. If anything, he was the sort of person I wanted to be: travelling the world and meeting all kinds of people from all kinds of places. I was a little worried he’d find me boring - a small city girl whose only other travel story was a premature mission to Florida. Well soon enough, I was going to have a whole new travel story... This travel story. 

We get up early the next morning, and meeting Aaron with his documentary crew, we each take separate taxis out of Biển Hứa Hẹn. Following the cab in front of us, we weren’t even sure where we were going exactly. Curving along a highway which cuts through a dense valley, Aaron’s taxi suddenly pulls up on the curve, where he and his team jump out to the beeping of angry motorcycle drivers. Flagging our taxi down, Aaron tells us that according to his directions, we have to cut through the valley here and head into the jungle. 

Although we didn’t really know what was going to happen on this trip – we were just along for the ride after all, Aaron’s plan was to hike through the jungle to find the mysterious trail, document whatever they could, and then move onto a group of cave-systems where these “creatures” were supposed to lurk. Reaching our way down the slope of the valley, we follow along a narrow stream which acted as our temporary trail. Although this was Aaron’s expedition, as soon as we start our hike through the jungle, Chris rather mockingly calls out, ‘Alright everyone. Keep a lookout for Lizard People, Bigfoot and Charlie’ where again, I thought to myself, “Who the heck is Charlie?”  ",2,1743194578.0,stayawake,1,1.0,False

Or the opposite, this advice is genderless. Works on everyone, gay strait or whatever else, this advice is fluid.","Alright, listen to an old person.

I wrote this out as an answer to someone's question about interpreting a text. But it wouldn't post... Later I couldn't stop thinking about it so I had to make a post. Maybe OP will see it. 

Ok so first off, all these manosphere alpha influencers are pure frauds, and the advice they give is the opposite of what works, especially long term. 

I see so many guys on here asking about if they think a girl likes them based on a text or a snap ect.

and its all wrong.

Ok here is what you do. First you need money, so if you are broke- get a job, or sell your things, or whatever you can do to save a few hundred dollars.

Next find a pretty girl, make eye contact smile, find a reason to talk to her, maybe a compliment, about something she has choice over, clothing is a good one. Like hey i just wanted to say I love your hoody, you look like a burton model from a magazine I have at home. 

Its a little creepy, but oh well, ice broken.

Then either that day or the next day.

Be like ""hey I know this is a little weird, but there is this new cool sushi place i have wanted to try, I would love your company, any chance you would have a dinner date with me, my treat""

Boom! ask her out. 

No texting, no snap, no social media, no ask her friends, no nothing. 

Just ask can i treat you to dinner, I am a foodie, and i was curious if you would try this new place with me. 

if she says no, perfect, move on. 

1 week later try again with a different cute girl.

When you get someone to agree, it might take like 5-10 trys... maybe more, be ready for that. 

Just pay for everything, pick them up, feed them as much delicious food as you can, and TAKE THEM HOME. 

dont touch them! dont ask can i be your boyfriend, dont ask them if they like you, 

dont talk about yourself, dont make fun of them, dont gossip, dont shit talk, dont complain,

just ask them about themselves, like their family, their ambitions, their friends, their feelings, LISTEN TO THE ANSWERS and ask more questions. 

If you cant think of anything to say, make fun OF YOURSELF ONLY!

be really nice to the staff, and pay for it all, drop them back off. 

If they lose interest, perfect, add to the fails pile, and just move on right away. 

don't get obsessed, or jealous, its just a date.

Even if your heart is broken after 2 dates, dont freak out. just chill, and move on and try again. 

This is the secret cheat code to making women fall in love with you. Feed them, be humble, ask about them, dont text at all, dont be jelious, dont be controlling. 

Just date them, buy them food, and act like its all about the food, YOU LOVE FOOD, so you need cool people to share that with, buy food and take cute girls to eat and dont put on any pressure. just ask them after they are safe at home and a few days have passed, if they want to eat somewhere else. 

If they lose interest, thats good, just move on. 

If you can do this with like 5 girls, one will fall in love with you, maybe less bro, maybe 2.

Its really very easy.

You dont have to be smart, good looking or cool,

All you need is to be humble, funny, and feed them

Being funny is too easy too, just make fun of yourself, not her, not your friends, not the place. 

be humble, and say thank you.

""hey thanks for eating with me, see ya later""

drop them off, 

text them later ""hey that was fun want to do pizza next week, my treat""

dont ask them about being your girlfriend, dont ask them if they like anyone. 

dont ask them if they wanna eat again while you are with them, 

Just pick one up, ask about her, eat food, talk about food, drop her off. wait 2 hours and see if she wants to do it again in a week. 

This will either work and you will have a cute girl, or it doesn't and you move on, the whole process should take like a month or 2.

You will have a cute girl in one year max.

I wrote this as a dude, but it works in reverse too, or if you are gay or whatever. Its not gender or sexuality specific. 

This works so well, I feel like I figured it out in my 20's and as soon as I did my life changed, went from 0 to 100%

It even worked when I moved cities, I had a cute girl in like 4 days...

Before doing this, nothing worked, after doing this, i could not fail. 

You now love food, and you love to learn about people, so date one, one at a time and check the reaction.

YOU ARE A FOODIE!

You love food and culture, you cant wait to travel the world and try sushi in japan, coffee in turkey. But for now the best you can get is good conversation, and good local food, thats your hobby, you are a foodie. 

Good luck

**Final Draft**  
Thanks to all who sent logos, updated logos, sent openings & closures and contributed to this revision. A bit sad to see we're down from 87 to 82 breweries since last version (2023) but considering all that's happened in the economy and the market that's not a massive net loss in breweries over the past two years.  
***Take a look and help me be accurate please?***  I had to wing it on Save the World, Old Gregg and Fast Friends using web-scraped logos, but the rest were sent to me.  The rough geographical distribution on the page is noted by those squiggly lines (that will *not* be on the finished version), and they are grouped as: CP/Leander/NW at upper-left, North, upper right, Dripping Springs/SW at lower left, and South at lower right. Austin central is central. Thanks again to all who helped.  82 breweries within a 45 mile radius is pretty great.

&nbsp;

I'm primarily looking to trade for games from my **[wishlist](https://redd.it/zw7tvs/)**, otherwise I am also open to selling them. I am not interested in games I already have, only exception are some co-op games, and all games I'm getting for myself are activated on my own account. Other than that feel free to offer your list of Steam games and something I may not have and fulfills my criteria I could/would be willing to trade for it/them.

* To trade you must respond to this thread first, I will not respond or accept anyone outside of this thread, only exception are unless we've traded more than once before.
* Only interested in trading for games on Steam.
* I don't do Humble gifts whether receiving or giving, all my keys are in unrevealed form right after purchase.
* No interest in any keys from an unofficial retailer/source (aka grey market), curator/reviewer keys (aka beta/reviewer/beta-testing/etc.), keys for games that are already free on Steam itself, Steam profile-limited keys, although some interest in VR-titles and/or de-listed games (no banned games).
* Anything marked as wishlist/paypal, it's self-explanatory and I won't look through lists.
* All my keys are EU keys, if you are outside of EU, make sure you double check for any region locks for your country. For quite a few which I was aware of I already listed the region lock, however this is not my responsibility as I did specify the key's region.
* When buying, I only accept payments in Euro's. Minimum purchase of €1,00. Fees are on buyer.

If you're either trading or buying please state the game(s) you are interested in and your offer (game(s)/list/price).

&nbsp;

**Info:**

* Region (and keys region): **Europe**

* **[IGS Rep Page](https://reddit.com/r/IGSRep/comments/zvionr/xiaoliis_igs_rep_page/)**

&nbsp;

I kindly ask of you is to be reasonable when making offers to make it a fair trade for both of us.

Let's have a good exchange/trade!

1jm509s,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1jm509s/i_was_an_english_teacher_in_vietnam_i_will_never/,I Was an English Teacher in Vietnam... I Will Never Step Foot Inside a Jungle Again - Part 1 of 2,"My name is Sarah Branch. A few years ago, when I was 24 years old, I had left my home state of Utah and moved abroad to work as an English language teacher in Vietnam. Having just graduated BYU and earning my degree in teaching, I suddenly realized I needed so much more from my life. I always wanted to travel, embrace other cultures, and most of all, have memorable and life-changing experiences.  

Feeling trapped in my normal, everyday life outside of Salt Lake City, where winters are cold and summers always far away, I decided I was no longer going to live the life that others had chosen for me, and instead choose my own path in life – a life of fulfilment and little regrets. Already attaining my degree in teaching, I realized if I gained a further ESL Certification (teaching English as a second language), I could finally achieve my lifelong dream of travelling the world to far-away and exotic places – all the while working for a reasonable income. 

There were so many places I dreamed of going – maybe somewhere in South America or far east Asia. As long as the weather was warm and there were beautiful beaches for me to soak up the sun, I honestly did not mind. Scanning my finger over a map of the world, rotating from one hemisphere to the other, I eventually put my finger down on a narrow, little country called Vietnam. This was by no means a random choice. I had always wanted to travel to Vietnam because... I’m actually one-quarter Vietnamese. Not that you can tell or anything - my hair is brown and my skin is rather fair. But I figured, if I wanted to go where the sun was always shining, and there was an endless supply of tropical beaches, Vietnam would be the perfect destination! Furthermore, I’d finally get the chance to explore my heritage. 

Fortunately enough for me, it turned out Vietnam had a huge demand for English language teachers. They did prefer it if you were teaching in the country already - but after a few online interviews and some Visa complications later, I packed up my things in Utah and moved across the world to the Land of the Blue Dragon.  

I was relocated to a beautiful beach town in Central Vietnam, right along the coast of the South China Sea. English teachers don’t really get to choose where in the country they end up, but if I did have that option, I could not have picked a more perfect place... Because of the horrific turn this story will take, I can’t say where exactly it was in Central Vietnam I lived, or even the name of the beach town I resided in - just because I don’t want anyone to get the wrong idea. This part of Vietnam is a truly beautiful place and I don’t want to discourage anyone from going there. So, for the continuation of this story, I’m just going to refer to where I was as Central Vietnam – and as for the beach town where I made my living, I’m going to give it the pseudonym “Biển Hứa Hẹn” - which in Vietnamese, roughly, but rather fittingly translates to “Sea of Promise.”   

Biển Hứa Hẹn truly was the most perfect destination! It was a modest sized coastal town, nestled inside of a tropical bay, with the whitest sands and clearest blue waters you could possibly dream of. The town itself is also spectacular. Most of the houses and buildings are painted a vibrant sunny yellow, not only to look more inviting to tourists, but so to reflect the sun during the hottest months. For this reason, I originally wanted to give the town the nickname “Trấn Màu Vàng” (Yellow Town), but I quickly realized how insensitive that pseudonym would have been – so “Sea of Promise” it is!  

Alongside its bright, sunny buildings, Biển Hứa Hẹn has the most stunning oriental and French Colonial architecture – interspersed with many quality restaurants and coffee shops. The local cuisine is to die for! Not only is it healthy and delicious, but it's also surprisingly cheap – like we’re only talking 90 cents! You wouldn’t believe how many different flavours of Coffee Vietnam has. I mean, I went a whole 24 years without even trying coffee, and since I’ve been here, I must have tried around two-dozen flavours. Another whimsy little aspect of this town is the many multi-coloured, little plastic chairs that are dispersed everywhere. So whether it was dining on the local cuisine or trying my twenty-second flavour of coffee, I would always find one of these chairs – a different colour every time, sit down in the shade and just watch the world go by. 

I haven’t even mentioned how much I loved my teaching job. My classes were the most adorable 7 and 8 year-olds, and my colleagues were so nice and welcoming. They never called me by my first name. Instead my colleagues would always say “Chào em” or “Chào em gái”, which basically means “Hello little sister.”  

When I wasn’t teaching or grading papers, I spent most of my leisure time by the town’s beach - and being the boring, vanilla person I am, I didn’t really do much. Feeling the sun upon my skin while I observed the breath-taking scenery was more than enough – either that or I was curled up in a good book... I was never the only foreigner on this beach. Biển Hứa Hẹn is a popular tourist destination – mostly Western backpackers and surfers. So, if I wasn’t turning pink beneath the sun or memorizing every little detail of the bay’s geography, I would enviously spectate fellow travellers ride the waves. 

As much as I love Vietnam - as much as I love Biển Hứa Hẹn, what really spoils this place from being the perfect paradise is all the garbage pollution. I mean, it’s just everywhere. There is garbage in the town, on the beach and even in the ocean – and if it isn’t the garbage that spoils everything, it certainly is all the rats, cockroaches and other vermin brought with it. Biển Hứa Hẹn is such a unique place and it honestly makes me so mad that no one does anything about it... Nevertheless, I still love it here. It will always be a paradise to me – and if America was the Promised Land for Lehi and his descendants, then this was going to be my Promised Land.  

I had now been living in Biển Hứa Hẹn for 4 months, and although I had only 3 months left in my teaching contract, I still planned on staying in Vietnam - even if that meant leaving this region I’d fallen in love with and relocating to another part of the country. Since I was going to stay, I decided I really needed to learn Vietnamese – as you’d be surprised how few people there are in Vietnam who can speak any to no English. Although most English teachers in South-East Asia use their leisure time to travel, I rather boringly decided to spend most of my days at the same beach, sat amongst the sand while I studied and practised what would hopefully become my second language. 

On one of those days, I must have been completely occupied in my own world, because when I look up, I suddenly see someone standing over, talking down to me. I take off my headphones, and shading the sun from my eyes, I see a tall, late-twenty-something tourist - wearing only swim shorts and cradling a surfboard beneath his arm. Having come in from the surf, he thought I said something to him as he passed by, where I then told him I was speaking Vietnamese to myself, and didn’t realize anyone could hear me. We both had a good laugh about it and the guy introduces himself as Tyler. Like me, Tyler was American, and unsurprisingly, he was from California. He came to Vietnam for no other reason than to surf. Like I said, Tyler was this tall, very tanned guy – like he was the tannest guy I had ever seen. He had all these different tattoos he acquired from his travels, and long brown hair, which he regularly wore in a man-bun. When I first saw him standing there, I was taken back a little, because I almost mistook him as Jesus Christ – that's what he looked like. Tyler asks what I’m doing in Vietnam and later in the conversation, he invites me to have a drink with him and his surfer buddies at the beach town bar. I was a little hesitant to say yes, only because I don’t really drink alcohol, but Tyler seemed like a nice guy and so I agreed.  

Later that day, I meet Tyler at the bar and he introduces me to his three surfer friends. The first of Tyler’s friends was Chris, who he knew from back home. Chris was kinda loud and a little obnoxious, but I suppose he was also funny. The other two friends were Brodie and Hayley - a couple from New Zealand. Tyler and Chris met them while surfing in Australia – and ever since, the four of them have been travelling, or more accurately, surfing the world together. Over a few drinks, we all get to know each other a little better and I told them what it’s like to teach English in Vietnam. Curious as to how they’re able to travel so much, I ask them what they all do for a living. Tyler says they work as vloggers, bloggers and general content creators, all the while travelling to a different country every other month. You wouldn’t believe the number of places they’ve been to: Hawaii, Costa Rica, Sri Lanka, Bali – everywhere! They didn’t see the value of staying in just one place and working a menial job, when they could be living their best lives, all the while being their own bosses. It did make a lot of sense to me, and was not that unsimilar to my reasoning for being in Vietnam.  

The four of them were only going to be in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple more days, but when I told them I hadn’t yet explored the rest of the country, they insisted that I tag along with them. I did come to Vietnam to travel, not just stay in one place – the only problem was I didn’t have anyone to do it with... But I guess now I did. They even invited me to go surfing with them the next day. Having never surfed a day in my life, I very nearly declined the offer, but coming all this way from cold and boring Utah, I knew I had to embrace new and exciting opportunities whenever they arrived. 

By early next morning, and pushing through my first hangover, I had officially surfed my first ever wave. I was a little afraid I’d embarrass myself – especially in front of Tyler, but after a few trials and errors, I thankfully gained the hang of it. Even though I was a newbie at surfing, I could not have been that bad, because as soon as I surf my first successful wave, Chris would not stop calling me “Johnny Utah” - not that I knew what that meant. If I wasn’t embarrassing myself on a board, I definitely was in my ignorance of the guys’ casual movie quotes. For instance, whenever someone yelled out “Charlie Don’t Surf!” all I could think was, “Who the heck is Charlie?” 

By that afternoon, we were all back at the bar and I got to spend some girl time with Hayley. She was so kind to me and seemed to take a genuine interest in my life - or maybe she was just grateful not to be the only girl in the group anymore. She did tell me she thought Chris was extremely annoying, no matter where they were in the world - and even though Brodie was the quiet, sensible type for the most part, she hated how he acted when he was around the guys. Five beers later and Brodie was suddenly on his feet, doing some kind of native New Zealand war dance while Chris or Tyler vlogged. 

Although I was having such a wonderful time with the four of them, anticipating all the places in Vietnam Hayley said we were going, in the corner of my eye, I kept seeing the same strange man staring over at us. I thought maybe we were being too loud and he wanted to say something, but the man was instead looking at all of us with intrigue. Well, 10 minutes later, this very same man comes up to us with three strangers behind him. Very casually, he asks if we’re all having a good time. We kind of awkwardly oblige the man. A fellow traveller like us, who although was probably in his early thirties, looked more like a middle-aged dad on vacation - in an overly large Hawaiian shirt, as though to hide his stomach, and looking down at us through a pair of brainiac glasses. The strangers behind him were two other men and a young woman. One of the men was extremely hairy, with a beard almost as long as his own hair – while the other was very cleanly presented, short in height and holding a notepad. The young woman with them, who was not much older than myself, had a cool combination of dyed maroon hair and sleeve tattoos – although rather oddly, she was wearing way too much clothing for this climate. After some brief pleasantries, the man in the Hawaiian shirt then says, ‘I’m sorry to bother you folks, but I was wondering if we could ask you a few questions?’ 

Introducing himself as Aaron, the man tells us that he and his friends are documentary filmmakers, and were wanting to know what we knew of the local disappearances. Clueless as to what he was talking about, Aaron then sits down, without invitation at our rather small table, and starts explaining to us that for the past thirty years, tourists in the area have been mysteriously going missing without a trace. First time they were hearing of this, Tyler tells Aaron they have only been in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple of days. Since I was the one who lived and worked in the town, Hayley asks me if I knew anything of the missing tourists - and when she does, Aaron turns his full attention on me. Answering his many questions, I told Aaron I only heard in passing that tourists have allegedly gone missing, but wasn’t sure what to make of it. But while I’m telling him this, I notice the short guy behind him is writing everything I say down, word for word – before Aaron then asks me, with desperation in his voice, ‘Well, have you at least heard of the local legends?’  

Suddenly gaining an interest in what Aaron’s telling us, Tyler, Chris and Brodie drunkenly inquire, ‘Legends? What local legends?’ 

Taking another sip from his light beer, Aaron tells us that according to these legends, there are creatures lurking deep within the jungles and cave-systems of the region, and for centuries, local farmers or fishermen have only seen glimpses of them... Feeling as though we’re being told a scary bedtime story, Chris rather excitedly asks, ‘Well, what do these creatures look like?’ Aaron says the legends abbreviate and there are many claims to their appearance, but that they’re always described as being humanoid.   

Whatever these creatures were, paranormal communities and investigators have linked these legends to the disappearances of the tourists. All five of us realized just how silly this all sounded, which Brodie highlighted by saying, ‘You don’t actually believe that shite, do you?’ 

Without saying either yes or no, Aaron smirks at us, before revealing there are actually similar legends and sightings all around Central Vietnam – even by American soldiers as far back as the Vietnam War.  

‘You really don’t know about the cryptids of the Vietnam War?’ Aaron asks us, as though surprised we didn’t.  

Further educating us on this whole mystery, Aaron claims that during the war, several platoons and individual soldiers who were deployed in the jungles, came in contact with more than one type of creature.  

‘You never heard of the Rock Apes? The Devil Creatures of Quang Binh? The Big Yellows?’ 

If you were like us, and never heard of these creatures either, apparently what the American soldiers encountered in the jungles was a group of small Bigfoot-like creatures, that liked to throw rocks, and some sort of Lizard People, that glowed a luminous yellow and lived deep within the cave systems. 

Feeling somewhat ridiculous just listening to this, Tyler rather mockingly comments, ‘So, you’re saying you believe the reason for all the tourists going missing is because of Vietnamese Bigfoot and Lizard People?’ 

Aaron and his friends must have received this ridicule a lot, because rather than being insulted, they looked somewhat amused.  

‘Well, that’s why we’re here’ he says. ‘We’re paranormal investigators and filmmakers – and as far as we know, no one has tried to solve the mystery of the Vietnam Triangle. We’re in Biển Hứa Hẹn to interview locals on what they know of the disappearances, and we’ll follow any leads from there.’ 

Although I thought this all to be a little kooky, I tried to show a little respect and interest in what these guys did for a living – but not Tyler, Chris or Brodie. They were clearly trying to have fun at Aaron’s expense.  

‘So, what did the locals say? Is there a Vietnamese Loch Ness Monster we haven’t heard of?’  

Like I said, Aaron was well acquainted with this kind of ridicule, because rather spontaneously he replies, ‘Glad you asked!’ before gulping down the rest of his low-carb beer. ‘According to a group of fishermen we interviewed yesterday, there’s an unmapped trail that runs through the nearby jungles. Apparently, no one knows where this trail leads to - not even the locals do. And anyone who tries to find out for themselves... are never seen or heard from again.’ 

As amusing as we found these legends of ape-creatures and lizard-men, hearing there was a secret trail somewhere in the nearby jungles, where tourists are said to vanish - even if this was just a local legend... it was enough to unsettle all of us. Maybe there weren’t creatures abducting tourists in the jungles, but on an unmarked wilderness trail, anyone not familiar with the terrain could easily lose their way. Neither Tyler, Chris, Brodie or Hayley had a comment for this - after all, they were fellow travellers. As fun as their lifestyle was, they knew the dangers of venturing the more untamed corners of the world. The five of us just sat there, silently, not really knowing what to say, as Aaron very contentedly mused over us. 

‘We’re actually heading out tomorrow in search of the trail – we have directions and everything.’ Aaron then pauses on us... before he says, ‘If you guys don’t have any plans, why don’t you come along? After all, what’s the point of travelling if there ain’t a little danger involved?’  

Expecting someone in the group to tell him we already had plans, Tyler, Chris and Brodie share a look to one another - and to mine and Hayley’s surprise... they then agreed... Hayley obviously protested. She didn’t want to go gallivanting around the jungle where tourists supposedly vanished.  

‘Oh, come on Hayl’. It’ll be fun... Sarah? You’ll come, won’t you?’ 

‘Yeah. Johnny Utah wants to come, right?’  

Hayley stared at me, clearly desperate for me to take her side. I then glanced around the table to see so too was everyone else. Neither wanting to take sides or accept the invitation, all I could say was that I didn’t know what I wanted to do. 

Although Hayley and the guys were divided on whether or not to accompany Aaron’s expedition, it was ultimately left to a majority vote – and being too sheepish to protest, it now appeared our plans of travelling the country had changed to exploring the jungles of Central Vietnam... Even though I really didn’t want to go on this expedition – it could have been dangerous after all, I then reminded myself why I came to Vietnam in the first place... To have memorable and life changing experiences – and I wasn’t going to have any of that if I just said no when the opportunity arrived. Besides, tourists may well have gone missing in the region, but the supposed legends of jungle-dwelling creatures were probably nothing more than just stories. I spent my whole life believing in stories that turned out not to be true and I wasn’t going to let that continue now. 

Later that night, while Brodie and Hayley spent some alone time, and Chris was with Aaron’s friends (smoking you know what), Tyler invited me for a walk on the beach under the moonlight. Strolling barefoot along the beach, trying not to step on any garbage, Tyler asks me if I’m really ok with tomorrow’s plans – and that I shouldn’t feel peer-pressured into doing anything I didn’t really wanna do. I told him I was ok with it and that it should be fun.  

‘Don’t worry’ he said, ‘I’ll keep an eye on you.’ 

I’m a little embarrassed to admit this... but I kinda had a crush on Tyler. He was tall, handsome and adventurous. If anything, he was the sort of person I wanted to be: travelling the world and meeting all kinds of people from all kinds of places. I was a little worried he’d find me boring - a small city girl whose only other travel story was a premature mission to Florida. Well soon enough, I was going to have a whole new travel story... This travel story. 

We get up early the next morning, and meeting Aaron with his documentary crew, we each take separate taxis out of Biển Hứa Hẹn. Following the cab in front of us, we weren’t even sure where we were going exactly. Curving along a highway which cuts through a dense valley, Aaron’s taxi suddenly pulls up on the curve, where he and his team jump out to the beeping of angry motorcycle drivers. Flagging our taxi down, Aaron tells us that according to his directions, we have to cut through the valley here and head into the jungle. 

Although we didn’t really know what was going to happen on this trip – we were just along for the ride after all, Aaron’s plan was to hike through the jungle to find the mysterious trail, document whatever they could, and then move onto a group of cave-systems where these “creatures” were supposed to lurk. Reaching our way down the slope of the valley, we follow along a narrow stream which acted as our temporary trail. Although this was Aaron’s expedition, as soon as we start our hike through the jungle, Chris rather mockingly calls out, ‘Alright everyone. Keep a lookout for Lizard People, Bigfoot and Charlie’ where again, I thought to myself, “Who the heck is Charlie?”  ",1,1743194298.0,scarystories,2,1.0,False

If you want all the details you can find the post on my profile, but long story short I had intense flu-like symptoms including a fever, no appetite at all, and intense abdominal pain when moving that had me bed-bound for a couple of days. I’m on day 3 since my shot and the cramps are still there but fading slowly and I’m finally able to catch up on all the sleep I lost. But now I’m terrified to take my next shot. I’m on the lowest dose so titrating down is not an option. I think the trigger food was a Dunkalatte from Dunkin, so hopefully if I avoid heavy coffee drinks like that within the first couple of days it won’t happen again? My coffee drinks made at home are much lighter, but when I go out for coffee they tend to make me poop a lot, and with the shot slowing everything down it just tore me to shreds. That’s just my guess anyway.

Does anyone have any thoughts? I felt so awful that I actually missed a couple of days of work, and I’m scared to do that to myself again. Should I let my doctor know before I take the next dose? I don’t want to give up and say I can’t tolerate it, but I’m terrified to go through that again.",0,1743194252.0,Zepbound,5,0.5,False

1jm4xbe,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1jm4xbe/clarity/,Clarity,"I (28m) broke up with my ex (27f) about a month ago. 

I've known this girl for the better part of 10 years. We were friends for 7 years prior to us getting together after she divorced her ex. She told me she split because there was physical and emotional abuse. I knew the guy and he was friendly, pretty good guy. 

The first 2 years of our relationship were perfect. We got along well, traveled well, her family was great too. There was some underlying issues she had been facing with her older sister that came up very often. I was supportive where I could be and made sure she knew I was in her corner. She was going to family therapy and had a session that seemed to flip everything in her life 180⁰. I can't say the exact details as to how it was discovered and or stated, but the therapist told me ex that my ex was sexually abused as a child. I was heart broken for her to discover this, but also perplexed as to how they came to this discovery. Albeit, I didn't ask. Was my business. I was as supportive as I knew how to be. 

After this discovery my ex made this her entire personality for 6 months. She would hyper focus on it, she would constantly talk about it to me. She asked me to go see a therapist to be there for her, to offer her support in a better, more effective way. I said absolutely, I wanted to help, wanted to be there for her. (This was 1 month after her realization). The next 5 months were hard. I met with a therapist 1/2 times a week, we went to couples therapy 1/2 times a week). The sessions started out great, I learned a lot and understood how I could help her out when the thoughts started flooding her mind. At this point we had little to no sexual intimacy (I was not pushy and was reassuring when she rejected my advances, it was a struggle but I dealt wit it). Until I stated that zero sexual contact was becoming difficult. She would walk around the house naked, taking photos of herself and began painting these photos. She would hang them up around the house. (She was loving her body again, I was happy for her. Still no sexual contact). I finally voiced that my needs weren't being met and I was craving her. Craving her physical affection. She told me to find someone else to have sex with for the time being. I was crushed and felt blindsided after doing therapy, being there for her, etc. I did not find someone else.

Moving forward.

A few months after the above situation happened things got a little better. Normalcy seemed to be coming back to our relationship. Things were going well. Until I stated I didn't think therapy was still necessary. Our therapist voiced to me that he rarely met with couples more than 12 times. I was blown away. At this point we'd have probably seen the therapist 40+ times. After stating this to my ex she blew up. Stating I did not care about her, and I did not care about the relationship. I sat there in a daze. Where did the last half year go? The effort, the vulnerability, the tears and growth.. I again was crushed. I began to pull away. 

Things began to get worse. She would double down, stating that I didn't care. Even in front of the therapist. Mind you.. I cooked, cleaned, general house maintenance,, paid the majority of the bills, splurged on nice gifts, vacations, surprises, flowers. And she would still say I didn't care. I pulled away. She began to say I tricked her into a relationship, that I love bombed her early on and I no longer did all the nice things I used to do. At this point, I was exhausted, I put myself in a corner where she had expectations of being spoiled, she didn't have to do chores, would expect me to pay for all the groceries, take the dogs on walks alone, literally do it all. I sat her down and told her my feelings, how things were going for me in the relationship. I didn't feel valued, I didn't feel valid, I didn't feel worthy, I didn't feel happy. It got worse. 

The expectations grew. The messes around the house got worse. The additional work she would expect me to do for her. I was tired. She wanted me to be her rock, her boulder, but she chipped away at me until I was a pebble, a shell, a sad man. 

Valentines day came around. We had a conversation the week prior. She stated that she was not going to plan anything at all because she had planning fatigue. I stated that valentines day is a celebration of love, for BOTH of us. She got mad. Stated that she wanted to feel like a loved woman. I explained to her that she shouldn't be the own person feeling affection. But, I folded. I said I would find something to do. I ordered a couples painting activity, spent $200 on a custom necklace, got some nice steaks, opened a special wine bottle I was saving and lit some candles. I asked if she could put some music on and she got PISSED but put the music on. Dinner was good, conversation was good. But sadly, the couples painting activity didn't arrive in time. I didn't have a plan b and told her this. Again, she got PISSED. She suggested we do a couples card game. Simple game, read the questions/prompts on the card. It was cute, we danced, listened to the music. At this point I was exhausted (long hard day of work prior to all of this) and asked if she wanted to go to bed with me. She did not. I kissed her goodnight and fell asleep the moment my head hit the pillow.

We woke up the next day. I got up, made her her favorite breakfast and coffee. She was pissed. Told me that valentines day sucked, that the necklace I got her was horrible, etc. I was crushed. It felt likr she stepped on my heart and rubbed dirt in it. So, I reacted. I got pissed. Lost my temper. Said she was ungrateful among other things. She kicked me out of the house. 

I spent the night in a motel, had to wait til 3pm to contact her. Once 3pm rolled around she said that I would need to isolate in a single room in the house for the next week. Work out of it, sleep, reside. This was the final straw for me. I knew if I agreed to this demand, she would continually use it against me moving forward into our future.I walked into the house and broke it off. Contacted my manager and put my two weeks in. (Great job, but I couldnt live in the area anymore). Drove 5 hours to stay with a friend for a week. 

A month and some change after the break up, I'm sitting her wondering why I feel bad about the break up. Per my circumstances.. is this feeling ""normal""? I've left out a LOT of details here. There's a lot more. Does anyone have any pieces of advice for me? What to do next. How to move on. I'm just lost and am struggling with the self doubt and don't have an idea what I need to do next.

So I'm an aspiring tarot reader for like, ever. I just turned 40 last month. I've been a (mostly) practicing witch for I guess about 20 years now. 😳🤯😲 Wooooooooooooow.

Anyhow. I want to know HOW you read. 

Like, you're watching tv, the mood strikes and you bust out the cards on the coffee table. No fuss, anytime, anywhere kind of method? I feel like this would almost be a great way to practice. 

If a friend says hey, read my cards right quick. Is that something you ""can"" do? ""Would"" you even do that? Also, probably a great way to practice. My 15 year old is forever asking me to read for him and always make an excuse and put it off. Can you do that? Is there a rule about reading for family or friends?

Or, do you need your space, your set up, your practice and ritual to do a reading? I know so much of our magical practice is rituals and processes and ambiance. That's one of my favorite things about this practice. I almost feel like, if that's how you practice in other ways, then reading tarot should be no different. Is there a requirement or suggestion to perform a certain way? Like cleansing, candles, offerings, etc. 

Or, do you do all of those? I would like to imagine that professional readers would have specific ways, too. Do the pros casually read for family or friends and professionally for others? If so, what's the difference in how you do that? 

What about you?   

Thank you in advance for all answers. I'm really curious what could be seen as acceptable or inappropriate. I know lots of things are based on personal practices and I get that and I love that. And I totally know that you do what is most comfortable for you, but I wonder what advice you could share?

I Will Never Step Foot Inside a Jungle Again - Part 1 of 2,"My name is Sarah Branch. A few years ago, when I was 24 years old, I had left my home state of Utah and moved abroad to work as an English language teacher in Vietnam. Having just graduated BYU and earning my degree in teaching, I suddenly realized I needed so much more from my life. I always wanted to travel, embrace other cultures, and most of all, have memorable and life-changing experiences.  

Feeling trapped in my normal, everyday life outside of Salt Lake City, where winters are cold and summers always far away, I decided I was no longer going to live the life that others had chosen for me, and instead choose my own path in life – a life of fulfilment and little regrets. Already attaining my degree in teaching, I realized if I gained a further ESL Certification (teaching English as a second language), I could finally achieve my lifelong dream of travelling the world to far-away and exotic places – all the while working for a reasonable income. 

There were so many places I dreamed of going – maybe somewhere in South America or far east Asia. As long as the weather was warm and there were beautiful beaches for me to soak up the sun, I honestly did not mind. Scanning my finger over a map of the world, rotating from one hemisphere to the other, I eventually put my finger down on a narrow, little country called Vietnam. This was by no means a random choice. I had always wanted to travel to Vietnam because... I’m actually one-quarter Vietnamese. Not that you can tell or anything - my hair is brown and my skin is rather fair. But I figured, if I wanted to go where the sun was always shining, and there was an endless supply of tropical beaches, Vietnam would be the perfect destination! Furthermore, I’d finally get the chance to explore my heritage. 

Fortunately enough for me, it turned out Vietnam had a huge demand for English language teachers. They did prefer it if you were teaching in the country already - but after a few online interviews and some Visa complications later, I packed up my things in Utah and moved across the world to the Land of the Blue Dragon.  

I was relocated to a beautiful beach town in Central Vietnam, right along the coast of the South China Sea. English teachers don’t really get to choose where in the country they end up, but if I did have that option, I could not have picked a more perfect place... Because of the horrific turn this story will take, I can’t say where exactly it was in Central Vietnam I lived, or even the name of the beach town I resided in - just because I don’t want anyone to get the wrong idea. This part of Vietnam is a truly beautiful place and I don’t want to discourage anyone from going there. So, for the continuation of this story, I’m just going to refer to where I was as Central Vietnam – and as for the beach town where I made my living, I’m going to give it the pseudonym “Biển Hứa Hẹn” - which in Vietnamese, roughly, but rather fittingly translates to “Sea of Promise.”   

Biển Hứa Hẹn truly was the most perfect destination! It was a modest sized coastal town, nestled inside of a tropical bay, with the whitest sands and clearest blue waters you could possibly dream of. The town itself is also spectacular. Most of the houses and buildings are painted a vibrant sunny yellow, not only to look more inviting to tourists, but so to reflect the sun during the hottest months. For this reason, I originally wanted to give the town the nickname “Trấn Màu Vàng” (Yellow Town), but I quickly realized how insensitive that pseudonym would have been – so “Sea of Promise” it is!  

Alongside its bright, sunny buildings, Biển Hứa Hẹn has the most stunning oriental and French Colonial architecture – interspersed with many quality restaurants and coffee shops. The local cuisine is to die for! Not only is it healthy and delicious, but it's also surprisingly cheap – like we’re only talking 90 cents! You wouldn’t believe how many different flavours of Coffee Vietnam has. I mean, I went a whole 24 years without even trying coffee, and since I’ve been here, I must have tried around two-dozen flavours. Another whimsy little aspect of this town is the many multi-coloured, little plastic chairs that are dispersed everywhere. So whether it was dining on the local cuisine or trying my twenty-second flavour of coffee, I would always find one of these chairs – a different colour every time, sit down in the shade and just watch the world go by. 

I haven’t even mentioned how much I loved my teaching job. My classes were the most adorable 7 and 8 year-olds, and my colleagues were so nice and welcoming. They never called me by my first name. Instead my colleagues would always say “Chào em” or “Chào em gái”, which basically means “Hello little sister.”  

When I wasn’t teaching or grading papers, I spent most of my leisure time by the town’s beach - and being the boring, vanilla person I am, I didn’t really do much. Feeling the sun upon my skin while I observed the breath-taking scenery was more than enough – either that or I was curled up in a good book... I was never the only foreigner on this beach. Biển Hứa Hẹn is a popular tourist destination – mostly Western backpackers and surfers. So, if I wasn’t turning pink beneath the sun or memorizing every little detail of the bay’s geography, I would enviously spectate fellow travellers ride the waves. 

As much as I love Vietnam - as much as I love Biển Hứa Hẹn, what really spoils this place from being the perfect paradise is all the garbage pollution. I mean, it’s just everywhere. There is garbage in the town, on the beach and even in the ocean – and if it isn’t the garbage that spoils everything, it certainly is all the rats, cockroaches and other vermin brought with it. Biển Hứa Hẹn is such a unique place and it honestly makes me so mad that no one does anything about it... Nevertheless, I still love it here. It will always be a paradise to me – and if America was the Promised Land for Lehi and his descendants, then this was going to be my Promised Land.  

I had now been living in Biển Hứa Hẹn for 4 months, and although I had only 3 months left in my teaching contract, I still planned on staying in Vietnam - even if that meant leaving this region I’d fallen in love with and relocating to another part of the country. Since I was going to stay, I decided I really needed to learn Vietnamese – as you’d be surprised how few people there are in Vietnam who can speak any to no English. Although most English teachers in South-East Asia use their leisure time to travel, I rather boringly decided to spend most of my days at the same beach, sat amongst the sand while I studied and practised what would hopefully become my second language. 

On one of those days, I must have been completely occupied in my own world, because when I look up, I suddenly see someone standing over, talking down to me. I take off my headphones, and shading the sun from my eyes, I see a tall, late-twenty-something tourist - wearing only swim shorts and cradling a surfboard beneath his arm. Having come in from the surf, he thought I said something to him as he passed by, where I then told him I was speaking Vietnamese to myself, and didn’t realize anyone could hear me. We both had a good laugh about it and the guy introduces himself as Tyler. Like me, Tyler was American, and unsurprisingly, he was from California. He came to Vietnam for no other reason than to surf. Like I said, Tyler was this tall, very tanned guy – like he was the tannest guy I had ever seen. He had all these different tattoos he acquired from his travels, and long brown hair, which he regularly wore in a man-bun. When I first saw him standing there, I was taken back a little, because I almost mistook him as Jesus Christ – that's what he looked like. Tyler asks what I’m doing in Vietnam and later in the conversation, he invites me to have a drink with him and his surfer buddies at the beach town bar. I was a little hesitant to say yes, only because I don’t really drink alcohol, but Tyler seemed like a nice guy and so I agreed.  

Later that day, I meet Tyler at the bar and he introduces me to his three surfer friends. The first of Tyler’s friends was Chris, who he knew from back home. Chris was kinda loud and a little obnoxious, but I suppose he was also funny. The other two friends were Brodie and Hayley - a couple from New Zealand. Tyler and Chris met them while surfing in Australia – and ever since, the four of them have been travelling, or more accurately, surfing the world together. Over a few drinks, we all get to know each other a little better and I told them what it’s like to teach English in Vietnam. Curious as to how they’re able to travel so much, I ask them what they all do for a living. Tyler says they work as vloggers, bloggers and general content creators, all the while travelling to a different country every other month. You wouldn’t believe the number of places they’ve been to: Hawaii, Costa Rica, Sri Lanka, Bali – everywhere! They didn’t see the value of staying in just one place and working a menial job, when they could be living their best lives, all the while being their own bosses. It did make a lot of sense to me, and was not that unsimilar to my reasoning for being in Vietnam.  

The four of them were only going to be in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple more days, but when I told them I hadn’t yet explored the rest of the country, they insisted that I tag along with them. I did come to Vietnam to travel, not just stay in one place – the only problem was I didn’t have anyone to do it with... But I guess now I did. They even invited me to go surfing with them the next day. Having never surfed a day in my life, I very nearly declined the offer, but coming all this way from cold and boring Utah, I knew I had to embrace new and exciting opportunities whenever they arrived. 

By early next morning, and pushing through my first hangover, I had officially surfed my first ever wave. I was a little afraid I’d embarrass myself – especially in front of Tyler, but after a few trials and errors, I thankfully gained the hang of it. Even though I was a newbie at surfing, I could not have been that bad, because as soon as I surf my first successful wave, Chris would not stop calling me “Johnny Utah” - not that I knew what that meant. If I wasn’t embarrassing myself on a board, I definitely was in my ignorance of the guys’ casual movie quotes. For instance, whenever someone yelled out “Charlie Don’t Surf!” all I could think was, “Who the heck is Charlie?” 

By that afternoon, we were all back at the bar and I got to spend some girl time with Hayley. She was so kind to me and seemed to take a genuine interest in my life - or maybe she was just grateful not to be the only girl in the group anymore. She did tell me she thought Chris was extremely annoying, no matter where they were in the world - and even though Brodie was the quiet, sensible type for the most part, she hated how he acted when he was around the guys. Five beers later and Brodie was suddenly on his feet, doing some kind of native New Zealand war dance while Chris or Tyler vlogged. 

Although I was having such a wonderful time with the four of them, anticipating all the places in Vietnam Hayley said we were going, in the corner of my eye, I kept seeing the same strange man staring over at us. I thought maybe we were being too loud and he wanted to say something, but the man was instead looking at all of us with intrigue. Well, 10 minutes later, this very same man comes up to us with three strangers behind him. Very casually, he asks if we’re all having a good time. We kind of awkwardly oblige the man. A fellow traveller like us, who although was probably in his early thirties, looked more like a middle-aged dad on vacation - in an overly large Hawaiian shirt, as though to hide his stomach, and looking down at us through a pair of brainiac glasses. The strangers behind him were two other men and a young woman. One of the men was extremely hairy, with a beard almost as long as his own hair – while the other was very cleanly presented, short in height and holding a notepad. The young woman with them, who was not much older than myself, had a cool combination of dyed maroon hair and sleeve tattoos – although rather oddly, she was wearing way too much clothing for this climate. After some brief pleasantries, the man in the Hawaiian shirt then says, ‘I’m sorry to bother you folks, but I was wondering if we could ask you a few questions?’ 

Introducing himself as Aaron, the man tells us that he and his friends are documentary filmmakers, and were wanting to know what we knew of the local disappearances. Clueless as to what he was talking about, Aaron then sits down, without invitation at our rather small table, and starts explaining to us that for the past thirty years, tourists in the area have been mysteriously going missing without a trace. First time they were hearing of this, Tyler tells Aaron they have only been in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple of days. Since I was the one who lived and worked in the town, Hayley asks me if I knew anything of the missing tourists - and when she does, Aaron turns his full attention on me. Answering his many questions, I told Aaron I only heard in passing that tourists have allegedly gone missing, but wasn’t sure what to make of it. But while I’m telling him this, I notice the short guy behind him is writing everything I say down, word for word – before Aaron then asks me, with desperation in his voice, ‘Well, have you at least heard of the local legends?’  

Suddenly gaining an interest in what Aaron’s telling us, Tyler, Chris and Brodie drunkenly inquire, ‘Legends? What local legends?’ 

Taking another sip from his light beer, Aaron tells us that according to these legends, there are creatures lurking deep within the jungles and cave-systems of the region, and for centuries, local farmers or fishermen have only seen glimpses of them... Feeling as though we’re being told a scary bedtime story, Chris rather excitedly asks, ‘Well, what do these creatures look like?’ Aaron says the legends abbreviate and there are many claims to their appearance, but that they’re always described as being humanoid.   

Whatever these creatures were, paranormal communities and investigators have linked these legends to the disappearances of the tourists. All five of us realized just how silly this all sounded, which Brodie highlighted by saying, ‘You don’t actually believe that shite, do you?’ 

Without saying either yes or no, Aaron smirks at us, before revealing there are actually similar legends and sightings all around Central Vietnam – even by American soldiers as far back as the Vietnam War.  

‘You really don’t know about the cryptids of the Vietnam War?’ Aaron asks us, as though surprised we didn’t.  

Further educating us on this whole mystery, Aaron claims that during the war, several platoons and individual soldiers who were deployed in the jungles, came in contact with more than one type of creature.  

‘You never heard of the Rock Apes? The Devil Creatures of Quang Binh? The Big Yellows?’ 

If you were like us, and never heard of these creatures either, apparently what the American soldiers encountered in the jungles was a group of small Bigfoot-like creatures, that liked to throw rocks, and some sort of Lizard People, that glowed a luminous yellow and lived deep within the cave systems. 

Feeling somewhat ridiculous just listening to this, Tyler rather mockingly comments, ‘So, you’re saying you believe the reason for all the tourists going missing is because of Vietnamese Bigfoot and Lizard People?’ 

Aaron and his friends must have received this ridicule a lot, because rather than being insulted, they looked somewhat amused.  

‘Well, that’s why we’re here’ he says. ‘We’re paranormal investigators and filmmakers – and as far as we know, no one has tried to solve the mystery of the Vietnam Triangle. We’re in Biển Hứa Hẹn to interview locals on what they know of the disappearances, and we’ll follow any leads from there.’ 

Although I thought this all to be a little kooky, I tried to show a little respect and interest in what these guys did for a living – but not Tyler, Chris or Brodie. They were clearly trying to have fun at Aaron’s expense.  

‘So, what did the locals say? Is there a Vietnamese Loch Ness Monster we haven’t heard of?’  

Like I said, Aaron was well acquainted with this kind of ridicule, because rather spontaneously he replies, ‘Glad you asked!’ before gulping down the rest of his low-carb beer. ‘According to a group of fishermen we interviewed yesterday, there’s an unmapped trail that runs through the nearby jungles. Apparently, no one knows where this trail leads to - not even the locals do. And anyone who tries to find out for themselves... are never seen or heard from again.’ 

As amusing as we found these legends of ape-creatures and lizard-men, hearing there was a secret trail somewhere in the nearby jungles, where tourists are said to vanish - even if this was just a local legend... it was enough to unsettle all of us. Maybe there weren’t creatures abducting tourists in the jungles, but on an unmarked wilderness trail, anyone not familiar with the terrain could easily lose their way. Neither Tyler, Chris, Brodie or Hayley had a comment for this - after all, they were fellow travellers. As fun as their lifestyle was, they knew the dangers of venturing the more untamed corners of the world. The five of us just sat there, silently, not really knowing what to say, as Aaron very contentedly mused over us. 

‘We’re actually heading out tomorrow in search of the trail – we have directions and everything.’ Aaron then pauses on us... before he says, ‘If you guys don’t have any plans, why don’t you come along? After all, what’s the point of travelling if there ain’t a little danger involved?’  

Expecting someone in the group to tell him we already had plans, Tyler, Chris and Brodie share a look to one another - and to mine and Hayley’s surprise... they then agreed... Hayley obviously protested. She didn’t want to go gallivanting around the jungle where tourists supposedly vanished.  

‘Oh, come on Hayl’. It’ll be fun... Sarah? You’ll come, won’t you?’ 

‘Yeah. Johnny Utah wants to come, right?’  

Hayley stared at me, clearly desperate for me to take her side. I then glanced around the table to see so too was everyone else. Neither wanting to take sides or accept the invitation, all I could say was that I didn’t know what I wanted to do. 

Although Hayley and the guys were divided on whether or not to accompany Aaron’s expedition, it was ultimately left to a majority vote – and being too sheepish to protest, it now appeared our plans of travelling the country had changed to exploring the jungles of Central Vietnam... Even though I really didn’t want to go on this expedition – it could have been dangerous after all, I then reminded myself why I came to Vietnam in the first place... To have memorable and life changing experiences – and I wasn’t going to have any of that if I just said no when the opportunity arrived. Besides, tourists may well have gone missing in the region, but the supposed legends of jungle-dwelling creatures were probably nothing more than just stories. I spent my whole life believing in stories that turned out not to be true and I wasn’t going to let that continue now. 

Later that night, while Brodie and Hayley spent some alone time, and Chris was with Aaron’s friends (smoking you know what), Tyler invited me for a walk on the beach under the moonlight. Strolling barefoot along the beach, trying not to step on any garbage, Tyler asks me if I’m really ok with tomorrow’s plans – and that I shouldn’t feel peer-pressured into doing anything I didn’t really wanna do. I told him I was ok with it and that it should be fun.  

‘Don’t worry’ he said, ‘I’ll keep an eye on you.’ 

I’m a little embarrassed to admit this... but I kinda had a crush on Tyler. He was tall, handsome and adventurous. If anything, he was the sort of person I wanted to be: travelling the world and meeting all kinds of people from all kinds of places. I was a little worried he’d find me boring - a small city girl whose only other travel story was a premature mission to Florida. Well soon enough, I was going to have a whole new travel story... This travel story. 

We get up early the next morning, and meeting Aaron with his documentary crew, we each take separate taxis out of Biển Hứa Hẹn. Following the cab in front of us, we weren’t even sure where we were going exactly. Curving along a highway which cuts through a dense valley, Aaron’s taxi suddenly pulls up on the curve, where he and his team jump out to the beeping of angry motorcycle drivers. Flagging our taxi down, Aaron tells us that according to his directions, we have to cut through the valley here and head into the jungle. 

Although we didn’t really know what was going to happen on this trip – we were just along for the ride after all, Aaron’s plan was to hike through the jungle to find the mysterious trail, document whatever they could, and then move onto a group of cave-systems where these “creatures” were supposed to lurk. Reaching our way down the slope of the valley, we follow along a narrow stream which acted as our temporary trail. Although this was Aaron’s expedition, as soon as we start our hike through the jungle, Chris rather mockingly calls out, ‘Alright everyone. Keep a lookout for Lizard People, Bigfoot and Charlie’ where again, I thought to myself, “Who the heck is Charlie?”  ",2,1743193758.0,Odd_directions,2,0.76,False

I'm working on baking a custom cake for a fiend for her springtime themed party. The theme is ""forest floor"" - so here's a recipe I had chat come up with and I'm wondering if anyone has better suggestions for an ""earthy"" or ""dirty"" flavor for the cake.

The goal is for the cake to smell and feel like dense, moist, freshly shoveled earth.

I'm also trying to get it extra-super moist. It's adapted from an Ina Garten's chocolate cake recipe. 

Here's the recipe:

**Instructions:**

1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease and line two 8-inch pans.
2. In a large bowl, sift together: flour, charcoal, matcha, baking soda, baking powder, salt.
3. In another bowl, mix beet syrup/sugar, oil, eggs, vanilla, beet purée, and tea.
4. Combine wet into dry. Stir just until smooth.
5. Pour into pans. Bake for 30–35 minutes, until a toothpick comes out with a few moist crumbs.
6. Cool fully before frosting.

# 🌲 Juniper Icing (Frosting of the Pines)

* 8 oz cream cheese (or vegan version)
* 2 ½ cups powdered sugar (or powdered beet sugar)
* 1 tbsp crushed juniper berries

* 1 tsp lemon zest
* Pinch of salt

**Instructions:**

1. Simmer crushed juniper berries in gin or hot water for 3–5 minutes. Cool and strain.
2. Beat cream cheese + butter until fluffy.
3. Add powdered sugar, juniper infusion, lemon zest, and salt. Beat until smooth and thick.
4. Chill if too soft; frost when cake is fully cool.

# 🌿 Decoration Ideas

This seems to be a nice group so I wanted to throw out something and see what you all had input wise.

While our kitchen is under construction, which is pretty much a full gut job, we have a makeshift kitchen going with a microwave, sometimes a coffee machine or air fryer. Sporadically a rice cooker too. 

The cord to my microwave does not reach all the way down to the outlet from the card table that we have put together for us to have the microwave on top of. The only solution I have is an outdoor extension cord, but my concern, based on reading things is that I should not keep that plugged in forever (let’s say 90 days). What are my best options for a use of a normal plug to keep a microwave on, but also from time to time and air fryer or coffee machine. The card table is very much clear of carpet, and it’s not going through any walls. It’s a straight down to the plug.

I feel like my marriage is in trouble and I have no one else to discuss this with. The obvious advice I've gotten in another sub and also from friends/family IRL is to just break up. But I'm coming here because I'm willing to do the work to fix things. My wife (34F) and I (37M) been together for 11 years, married for 10. We have 2 kids together plus her son/daughter from a previous relationship who both live with us full time so i.e. we have 4 kids, ages 15, 13, 9, and 7.

I have been struggling with depression and anxiety on/off for a few years. I have good months and bad months, but when its bad its really bad; jolted awake in the middle of the night with intense anxiety like a buzzing feeling all over my face and torso. I've struggled with ED on/off ever since I got a vasectomy (6 yrs ago) which may or may not be related. My wife had an affair which started just a few months after my vasectomy and my ED problem. It got so serious we actually separated while she attempted to make things happen with this new guy (10 yrs younger than her, 13 yrs younger than me)...obviously a huge blow to my confidence. It didn't work out for her so we got back together which itself was probably a mistake for me. She hasn't been consistently faithful since we got back together. She hasn't admitted to another affair but I've caught her going to see this same guy from affair multiple times, texting & snapchatting him, etc, lying saying she's going to a friends when I can see on her apple location she actually went to the bar where the kid works.

For about a year (up until Dec2024) things had gotten so much better, no funny business from her, starting to feel really connected again, zero problems with ED for me. Then in December I found out through a drunken admission from her friend that this ex-dude of hers now works at this new bar that just opened and she's been going there to see him. The whole thing blew up into a huge argument - her making me feel like I'm being crazy/controlling by expecting her to not go the bar where he works. I say: out of respect for me and our relationship you should not be going to the place where this dude works, even though she says ""that's not why I go there, my friends and I just like that bar"".. Our arguments rarely get resolved and typically just end in both of us giving the silent treatment, and the next morning she'll typically be extra affectionate and apologetic for ""being mean"" but not actually discussing the issues or making any kind of promises to be better.

At this point I am feeling extremely discontent and disconnected from this relationship, desperately wanting out. For nearly 2 months I would wake up every morning with such intense resentment for her but I bottle it up because she hates communicating. Multiple times throughout Dec/Jan/Feb I can see on her apple location that she's at his bar and when she gets home she just lies saying she was working late or some other excuse (she's also a bartender who usually gets off work around 9pm but occasionally work does keep her until 10 or so). The only time in five years where we've ever had a serious discussion about ANY issue plaguing our relationship (kids, sex, anything) is when she is really drunk. And her outlook obviously isn't the best in that state. ED problems back really bad. I've tried to take men's health supplements to combat this, even sometimes taking ED meds which have helped in the past but what's really scaring me now is for the past few months even those don't work. The only time we've been able to have sex for the past 3 months is when I'm drunk, which I would imagine is because its suppressing my stress/anxiety.

Anyway cut to now (early March2025) and it's like overnight she snapped herself out of it and has been like an angel to me. She doesn't go out drinking after work at night (at all, let alone to ex-dude's work) and she's been clearly making an effort to be nicer to me around the house. She has even been the one initiating sex semi-regularly (once a week or so) which she normally never does. My problem is I still feel this same disconnect. I feel like I have no soul when I'm around her. I try to do nice things to revive my love such as bring her flowers & coffee the other day, but while I'm doing I feel like a complete sucker/loser like why would any dumbass spoil this women who's treated me like she has? Even though I honestly have been the one being spoiled for the past month. But still I wake up every morning desperately wanting out of this relationship, though that itself is not easy as we're raising four kids and have a huge mortgage payment on our house, and while I could definitely survive financially on my own - she definitely could NOT.

I guess the advice I'm looking for is how can I start up my feelings for her again? When we first got back together after her trial/affair/separation (only lasted 3 months) it was fairly easy for me to fall in love with her again because I missed her so much and was devastated by the break-up. But now even though for at least 4 weeks she has done nothing wrong and been nicer to me than she has in 5-ish years. I still find her insanely attractive, she's the hottest woman in the world in my eyes. This morning she initiated sex (in a very sexy manner that any man would be thanking god for such a moment) and as soon as we get naked in bed together my erection dies. Extremely frustrating for both of us but she's typically pretty patient with that (taking a step back, slowing it down) because we've struggled with it on/off for a few years now. But this time it just wasn't working at all, even after taking my ED meds earlier that morning. I'm so afraid to bring up the real issue of how I feel completely disconnected from her emotionally because she stonewalls and gets REALLY mad whenever I try to talk about my feelings or even worse when I try to get her to talk about hers.

What I really think happened was we were on a good run up until Dec2024 when she happened to run into her ex-guy and this new trendy bar and it sparked old feelings. Maybe she didn't actually even do anything unfaithful this time but she was loving the attention from him so she kept going. And what I was assume was either she tried to make a move and he shut her down, or she realized she wasn't getting anywhere with it, so ultimately she decided to focus back on me and our relationship.

I want to address bad money/spending habits at a psychological level. For example: I realize I used to waste money on eating lunch out in cafes not because I was lazy and didn’t want to cook, but because I was lonely and wanted a change of scenery and to interact with people. Often times, people spend money on things they don’t need because they are filling some other kind of void. Or, like, how being distracted and failing to attend to basic maintenance issues become large expenses down the road when you ignore them.

## Why Choose a Bonavita Electric Kettle?

For many coffee and tea enthusiasts, a quality electric kettle is not a luxury but a necessity.But why Bonavita? Several compelling reasons make the Bonavita electric kettle a top choice:

*   **Precise Temperature Control:** The hallmark of the Bonavita kettle is its ability to heat water to precise temperatures, crucial for optimal extraction and flavor growth. Different teas and coffees require different temperatures, and a variable temperature kettle allows you to fine-tune your brewing process. The Bonavita 1L Digital Variable Temperature Gooseneck Electric Kettle epitomizes this feature,allowing you to adjust the water temperature from 140° to 212°F.

*   **Gooseneck Spout:** Many Bonavita models feature a gooseneck spout, providing remarkable pour control. This is especially important for pour-over coffee, as it enables a slow, even saturation of the coffee grounds, resulting in a more balanced and flavorful cup. If you're looking for the best electric kettle for pour over, the Bonavita gooseneck kettle is an excellent starting point.

*   **Durable Construction:** Bonavita kettles are generally built to last, often featuring stainless steel kettle construction. This not only ensures durability but also helps prevent the transfer of unwanted flavors into your water.

*   **Ease of Use:** Despite their advanced features, Bonavita kettles are designed to be user-friendly. Programmable kettle options allow you to save your preferred temperature settings for different beverages.[[Explore Top Rated bonavita electric kettle on Amazon.]](https://wabashop.com/travel-gifts-7/?kw=%%keyword%)

1jm4kwi,https://www.reddit.com/r/DrCreepensVault/comments/1jm4kwi/i_was_an_english_teacher_in_vietnam_i_will_never/,I Was an English Teacher in Vietnam... I Will Never Step Foot Inside a Jungle Again - Part 1 of 2,"My name is Sarah Branch. A few years ago, when I was 24 years old, I had left my home state of Utah and moved abroad to work as an English language teacher in Vietnam. Having just graduated BYU and earning my degree in teaching, I suddenly realized I needed so much more from my life. I always wanted to travel, embrace other cultures, and most of all, have memorable and life-changing experiences.  

Feeling trapped in my normal, everyday life outside of Salt Lake City, where winters are cold and summers always far away, I decided I was no longer going to live the life that others had chosen for me, and instead choose my own path in life – a life of fulfilment and little regrets. Already attaining my degree in teaching, I realized if I gained a further ESL Certification (teaching English as a second language), I could finally achieve my lifelong dream of travelling the world to far-away and exotic places – all the while working for a reasonable income. 

There were so many places I dreamed of going – maybe somewhere in South America or far east Asia. As long as the weather was warm and there were beautiful beaches for me to soak up the sun, I honestly did not mind. Scanning my finger over a map of the world, rotating from one hemisphere to the other, I eventually put my finger down on a narrow, little country called Vietnam. This was by no means a random choice. I had always wanted to travel to Vietnam because... I’m actually one-quarter Vietnamese. Not that you can tell or anything - my hair is brown and my skin is rather fair. But I figured, if I wanted to go where the sun was always shining, and there was an endless supply of tropical beaches, Vietnam would be the perfect destination! Furthermore, I’d finally get the chance to explore my heritage. 

Fortunately enough for me, it turned out Vietnam had a huge demand for English language teachers. They did prefer it if you were teaching in the country already - but after a few online interviews and some Visa complications later, I packed up my things in Utah and moved across the world to the Land of the Blue Dragon.  

I was relocated to a beautiful beach town in Central Vietnam, right along the coast of the South China Sea. English teachers don’t really get to choose where in the country they end up, but if I did have that option, I could not have picked a more perfect place... Because of the horrific turn this story will take, I can’t say where exactly it was in Central Vietnam I lived, or even the name of the beach town I resided in - just because I don’t want anyone to get the wrong idea. This part of Vietnam is a truly beautiful place and I don’t want to discourage anyone from going there. So, for the continuation of this story, I’m just going to refer to where I was as Central Vietnam – and as for the beach town where I made my living, I’m going to give it the pseudonym “Biển Hứa Hẹn” - which in Vietnamese, roughly, but rather fittingly translates to “Sea of Promise.”   

Biển Hứa Hẹn truly was the most perfect destination! It was a modest sized coastal town, nestled inside of a tropical bay, with the whitest sands and clearest blue waters you could possibly dream of. The town itself is also spectacular. Most of the houses and buildings are painted a vibrant sunny yellow, not only to look more inviting to tourists, but so to reflect the sun during the hottest months. For this reason, I originally wanted to give the town the nickname “Trấn Màu Vàng” (Yellow Town), but I quickly realized how insensitive that pseudonym would have been – so “Sea of Promise” it is!  

Alongside its bright, sunny buildings, Biển Hứa Hẹn has the most stunning oriental and French Colonial architecture – interspersed with many quality restaurants and coffee shops. The local cuisine is to die for! Not only is it healthy and delicious, but it's also surprisingly cheap – like we’re only talking 90 cents! You wouldn’t believe how many different flavours of Coffee Vietnam has. I mean, I went a whole 24 years without even trying coffee, and since I’ve been here, I must have tried around two-dozen flavours. Another whimsy little aspect of this town is the many multi-coloured, little plastic chairs that are dispersed everywhere. So whether it was dining on the local cuisine or trying my twenty-second flavour of coffee, I would always find one of these chairs – a different colour every time, sit down in the shade and just watch the world go by. 

I haven’t even mentioned how much I loved my teaching job. My classes were the most adorable 7 and 8 year-olds, and my colleagues were so nice and welcoming. They never called me by my first name. Instead my colleagues would always say “Chào em” or “Chào em gái”, which basically means “Hello little sister.”  

When I wasn’t teaching or grading papers, I spent most of my leisure time by the town’s beach - and being the boring, vanilla person I am, I didn’t really do much. Feeling the sun upon my skin while I observed the breath-taking scenery was more than enough – either that or I was curled up in a good book... I was never the only foreigner on this beach. Biển Hứa Hẹn is a popular tourist destination – mostly Western backpackers and surfers. So, if I wasn’t turning pink beneath the sun or memorizing every little detail of the bay’s geography, I would enviously spectate fellow travellers ride the waves. 

As much as I love Vietnam - as much as I love Biển Hứa Hẹn, what really spoils this place from being the perfect paradise is all the garbage pollution. I mean, it’s just everywhere. There is garbage in the town, on the beach and even in the ocean – and if it isn’t the garbage that spoils everything, it certainly is all the rats, cockroaches and other vermin brought with it. Biển Hứa Hẹn is such a unique place and it honestly makes me so mad that no one does anything about it... Nevertheless, I still love it here. It will always be a paradise to me – and if America was the Promised Land for Lehi and his descendants, then this was going to be my Promised Land.  

I had now been living in Biển Hứa Hẹn for 4 months, and although I had only 3 months left in my teaching contract, I still planned on staying in Vietnam - even if that meant leaving this region I’d fallen in love with and relocating to another part of the country. Since I was going to stay, I decided I really needed to learn Vietnamese – as you’d be surprised how few people there are in Vietnam who can speak any to no English. Although most English teachers in South-East Asia use their leisure time to travel, I rather boringly decided to spend most of my days at the same beach, sat amongst the sand while I studied and practised what would hopefully become my second language. 

On one of those days, I must have been completely occupied in my own world, because when I look up, I suddenly see someone standing over, talking down to me. I take off my headphones, and shading the sun from my eyes, I see a tall, late-twenty-something tourist - wearing only swim shorts and cradling a surfboard beneath his arm. Having come in from the surf, he thought I said something to him as he passed by, where I then told him I was speaking Vietnamese to myself, and didn’t realize anyone could hear me. We both had a good laugh about it and the guy introduces himself as Tyler. Like me, Tyler was American, and unsurprisingly, he was from California. He came to Vietnam for no other reason than to surf. Like I said, Tyler was this tall, very tanned guy – like he was the tannest guy I had ever seen. He had all these different tattoos he acquired from his travels, and long brown hair, which he regularly wore in a man-bun. When I first saw him standing there, I was taken back a little, because I almost mistook him as Jesus Christ – that's what he looked like. Tyler asks what I’m doing in Vietnam and later in the conversation, he invites me to have a drink with him and his surfer buddies at the beach town bar. I was a little hesitant to say yes, only because I don’t really drink alcohol, but Tyler seemed like a nice guy and so I agreed.  

Later that day, I meet Tyler at the bar and he introduces me to his three surfer friends. The first of Tyler’s friends was Chris, who he knew from back home. Chris was kinda loud and a little obnoxious, but I suppose he was also funny. The other two friends were Brodie and Hayley - a couple from New Zealand. Tyler and Chris met them while surfing in Australia – and ever since, the four of them have been travelling, or more accurately, surfing the world together. Over a few drinks, we all get to know each other a little better and I told them what it’s like to teach English in Vietnam. Curious as to how they’re able to travel so much, I ask them what they all do for a living. Tyler says they work as vloggers, bloggers and general content creators, all the while travelling to a different country every other month. You wouldn’t believe the number of places they’ve been to: Hawaii, Costa Rica, Sri Lanka, Bali – everywhere! They didn’t see the value of staying in just one place and working a menial job, when they could be living their best lives, all the while being their own bosses. It did make a lot of sense to me, and was not that unsimilar to my reasoning for being in Vietnam.  

The four of them were only going to be in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple more days, but when I told them I hadn’t yet explored the rest of the country, they insisted that I tag along with them. I did come to Vietnam to travel, not just stay in one place – the only problem was I didn’t have anyone to do it with... But I guess now I did. They even invited me to go surfing with them the next day. Having never surfed a day in my life, I very nearly declined the offer, but coming all this way from cold and boring Utah, I knew I had to embrace new and exciting opportunities whenever they arrived. 

By early next morning, and pushing through my first hangover, I had officially surfed my first ever wave. I was a little afraid I’d embarrass myself – especially in front of Tyler, but after a few trials and errors, I thankfully gained the hang of it. Even though I was a newbie at surfing, I could not have been that bad, because as soon as I surf my first successful wave, Chris would not stop calling me “Johnny Utah” - not that I knew what that meant. If I wasn’t embarrassing myself on a board, I definitely was in my ignorance of the guys’ casual movie quotes. For instance, whenever someone yelled out “Charlie Don’t Surf!” all I could think was, “Who the heck is Charlie?” 

By that afternoon, we were all back at the bar and I got to spend some girl time with Hayley. She was so kind to me and seemed to take a genuine interest in my life - or maybe she was just grateful not to be the only girl in the group anymore. She did tell me she thought Chris was extremely annoying, no matter where they were in the world - and even though Brodie was the quiet, sensible type for the most part, she hated how he acted when he was around the guys. Five beers later and Brodie was suddenly on his feet, doing some kind of native New Zealand war dance while Chris or Tyler vlogged. 

Although I was having such a wonderful time with the four of them, anticipating all the places in Vietnam Hayley said we were going, in the corner of my eye, I kept seeing the same strange man staring over at us. I thought maybe we were being too loud and he wanted to say something, but the man was instead looking at all of us with intrigue. Well, 10 minutes later, this very same man comes up to us with three strangers behind him. Very casually, he asks if we’re all having a good time. We kind of awkwardly oblige the man. A fellow traveller like us, who although was probably in his early thirties, looked more like a middle-aged dad on vacation - in an overly large Hawaiian shirt, as though to hide his stomach, and looking down at us through a pair of brainiac glasses. The strangers behind him were two other men and a young woman. One of the men was extremely hairy, with a beard almost as long as his own hair – while the other was very cleanly presented, short in height and holding a notepad. The young woman with them, who was not much older than myself, had a cool combination of dyed maroon hair and sleeve tattoos – although rather oddly, she was wearing way too much clothing for this climate. After some brief pleasantries, the man in the Hawaiian shirt then says, ‘I’m sorry to bother you folks, but I was wondering if we could ask you a few questions?’ 

Introducing himself as Aaron, the man tells us that he and his friends are documentary filmmakers, and were wanting to know what we knew of the local disappearances. Clueless as to what he was talking about, Aaron then sits down, without invitation at our rather small table, and starts explaining to us that for the past thirty years, tourists in the area have been mysteriously going missing without a trace. First time they were hearing of this, Tyler tells Aaron they have only been in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple of days. Since I was the one who lived and worked in the town, Hayley asks me if I knew anything of the missing tourists - and when she does, Aaron turns his full attention on me. Answering his many questions, I told Aaron I only heard in passing that tourists have allegedly gone missing, but wasn’t sure what to make of it. But while I’m telling him this, I notice the short guy behind him is writing everything I say down, word for word – before Aaron then asks me, with desperation in his voice, ‘Well, have you at least heard of the local legends?’  

Suddenly gaining an interest in what Aaron’s telling us, Tyler, Chris and Brodie drunkenly inquire, ‘Legends? What local legends?’ 

Taking another sip from his light beer, Aaron tells us that according to these legends, there are creatures lurking deep within the jungles and cave-systems of the region, and for centuries, local farmers or fishermen have only seen glimpses of them... Feeling as though we’re being told a scary bedtime story, Chris rather excitedly asks, ‘Well, what do these creatures look like?’ Aaron says the legends abbreviate and there are many claims to their appearance, but that they’re always described as being humanoid.   

Whatever these creatures were, paranormal communities and investigators have linked these legends to the disappearances of the tourists. All five of us realized just how silly this all sounded, which Brodie highlighted by saying, ‘You don’t actually believe that shite, do you?’ 

Without saying either yes or no, Aaron smirks at us, before revealing there are actually similar legends and sightings all around Central Vietnam – even by American soldiers as far back as the Vietnam War.  

‘You really don’t know about the cryptids of the Vietnam War?’ Aaron asks us, as though surprised we didn’t.  

Further educating us on this whole mystery, Aaron claims that during the war, several platoons and individual soldiers who were deployed in the jungles, came in contact with more than one type of creature.  

‘You never heard of the Rock Apes? The Devil Creatures of Quang Binh? The Big Yellows?’ 

If you were like us, and never heard of these creatures either, apparently what the American soldiers encountered in the jungles was a group of small Bigfoot-like creatures, that liked to throw rocks, and some sort of Lizard People, that glowed a luminous yellow and lived deep within the cave systems. 

Feeling somewhat ridiculous just listening to this, Tyler rather mockingly comments, ‘So, you’re saying you believe the reason for all the tourists going missing is because of Vietnamese Bigfoot and Lizard People?’ 

Aaron and his friends must have received this ridicule a lot, because rather than being insulted, they looked somewhat amused.  

‘Well, that’s why we’re here’ he says. ‘We’re paranormal investigators and filmmakers – and as far as we know, no one has tried to solve the mystery of the Vietnam Triangle. We’re in Biển Hứa Hẹn to interview locals on what they know of the disappearances, and we’ll follow any leads from there.’ 

Although I thought this all to be a little kooky, I tried to show a little respect and interest in what these guys did for a living – but not Tyler, Chris or Brodie. They were clearly trying to have fun at Aaron’s expense.  

‘So, what did the locals say? Is there a Vietnamese Loch Ness Monster we haven’t heard of?’  

Like I said, Aaron was well acquainted with this kind of ridicule, because rather spontaneously he replies, ‘Glad you asked!’ before gulping down the rest of his low-carb beer. ‘According to a group of fishermen we interviewed yesterday, there’s an unmapped trail that runs through the nearby jungles. Apparently, no one knows where this trail leads to - not even the locals do. And anyone who tries to find out for themselves... are never seen or heard from again.’ 

As amusing as we found these legends of ape-creatures and lizard-men, hearing there was a secret trail somewhere in the nearby jungles, where tourists are said to vanish - even if this was just a local legend... it was enough to unsettle all of us. Maybe there weren’t creatures abducting tourists in the jungles, but on an unmarked wilderness trail, anyone not familiar with the terrain could easily lose their way. Neither Tyler, Chris, Brodie or Hayley had a comment for this - after all, they were fellow travellers. As fun as their lifestyle was, they knew the dangers of venturing the more untamed corners of the world. The five of us just sat there, silently, not really knowing what to say, as Aaron very contentedly mused over us. 

‘We’re actually heading out tomorrow in search of the trail – we have directions and everything.’ Aaron then pauses on us... before he says, ‘If you guys don’t have any plans, why don’t you come along? After all, what’s the point of travelling if there ain’t a little danger involved?’  

Expecting someone in the group to tell him we already had plans, Tyler, Chris and Brodie share a look to one another - and to mine and Hayley’s surprise... they then agreed... Hayley obviously protested. She didn’t want to go gallivanting around the jungle where tourists supposedly vanished.  

‘Oh, come on Hayl’. It’ll be fun... Sarah? You’ll come, won’t you?’ 

‘Yeah. Johnny Utah wants to come, right?’  

Hayley stared at me, clearly desperate for me to take her side. I then glanced around the table to see so too was everyone else. Neither wanting to take sides or accept the invitation, all I could say was that I didn’t know what I wanted to do. 

Although Hayley and the guys were divided on whether or not to accompany Aaron’s expedition, it was ultimately left to a majority vote – and being too sheepish to protest, it now appeared our plans of travelling the country had changed to exploring the jungles of Central Vietnam... Even though I really didn’t want to go on this expedition – it could have been dangerous after all, I then reminded myself why I came to Vietnam in the first place... To have memorable and life changing experiences – and I wasn’t going to have any of that if I just said no when the opportunity arrived. Besides, tourists may well have gone missing in the region, but the supposed legends of jungle-dwelling creatures were probably nothing more than just stories. I spent my whole life believing in stories that turned out not to be true and I wasn’t going to let that continue now. 

Later that night, while Brodie and Hayley spent some alone time, and Chris was with Aaron’s friends (smoking you know what), Tyler invited me for a walk on the beach under the moonlight. Strolling barefoot along the beach, trying not to step on any garbage, Tyler asks me if I’m really ok with tomorrow’s plans – and that I shouldn’t feel peer-pressured into doing anything I didn’t really wanna do. I told him I was ok with it and that it should be fun.  

‘Don’t worry’ he said, ‘I’ll keep an eye on you.’ 

I’m a little embarrassed to admit this... but I kinda had a crush on Tyler. He was tall, handsome and adventurous. If anything, he was the sort of person I wanted to be: travelling the world and meeting all kinds of people from all kinds of places. I was a little worried he’d find me boring - a small city girl whose only other travel story was a premature mission to Florida. Well soon enough, I was going to have a whole new travel story... This travel story. 

We get up early the next morning, and meeting Aaron with his documentary crew, we each take separate taxis out of Biển Hứa Hẹn. Following the cab in front of us, we weren’t even sure where we were going exactly. Curving along a highway which cuts through a dense valley, Aaron’s taxi suddenly pulls up on the curve, where he and his team jump out to the beeping of angry motorcycle drivers. Flagging our taxi down, Aaron tells us that according to his directions, we have to cut through the valley here and head into the jungle. 

Although we didn’t really know what was going to happen on this trip – we were just along for the ride after all, Aaron’s plan was to hike through the jungle to find the mysterious trail, document whatever they could, and then move onto a group of cave-systems where these “creatures” were supposed to lurk. Reaching our way down the slope of the valley, we follow along a narrow stream which acted as our temporary trail. Although this was Aaron’s expedition, as soon as we start our hike through the jungle, Chris rather mockingly calls out, ‘Alright everyone. Keep a lookout for Lizard People, Bigfoot and Charlie’ where again, I thought to myself, “Who the heck is Charlie?”  ",1,1743193180.0,DrCreepensVault,1,1.0,False

1jm4egw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllureStories/comments/1jm4egw/i_was_an_english_teacher_in_vietnam_i_will_never/,I Was an English Teacher in Vietnam... I Will Never Step Foot Inside a Jungle Again - Part 1 of 2,"My name is Sarah Branch. A few years ago, when I was 24 years old, I had left my home state of Utah and moved abroad to work as an English language teacher in Vietnam. Having just graduated BYU and earning my degree in teaching, I suddenly realized I needed so much more from my life. I always wanted to travel, embrace other cultures, and most of all, have memorable and life-changing experiences.  

Feeling trapped in my normal, everyday life outside of Salt Lake City, where winters are cold and summers always far away, I decided I was no longer going to live the life that others had chosen for me, and instead choose my own path in life – a life of fulfilment and little regrets. Already attaining my degree in teaching, I realized if I gained a further ESL Certification (teaching English as a second language), I could finally achieve my lifelong dream of travelling the world to far-away and exotic places – all the while working for a reasonable income. 

There were so many places I dreamed of going – maybe somewhere in South America or far east Asia. As long as the weather was warm and there were beautiful beaches for me to soak up the sun, I honestly did not mind. Scanning my finger over a map of the world, rotating from one hemisphere to the other, I eventually put my finger down on a narrow, little country called Vietnam. This was by no means a random choice. I had always wanted to travel to Vietnam because... I’m actually one-quarter Vietnamese. Not that you can tell or anything - my hair is brown and my skin is rather fair. But I figured, if I wanted to go where the sun was always shining, and there was an endless supply of tropical beaches, Vietnam would be the perfect destination! Furthermore, I’d finally get the chance to explore my heritage. 

Fortunately enough for me, it turned out Vietnam had a huge demand for English language teachers. They did prefer it if you were teaching in the country already - but after a few online interviews and some Visa complications later, I packed up my things in Utah and moved across the world to the Land of the Blue Dragon.  

I was relocated to a beautiful beach town in Central Vietnam, right along the coast of the South China Sea. English teachers don’t really get to choose where in the country they end up, but if I did have that option, I could not have picked a more perfect place... Because of the horrific turn this story will take, I can’t say where exactly it was in Central Vietnam I lived, or even the name of the beach town I resided in - just because I don’t want anyone to get the wrong idea. This part of Vietnam is a truly beautiful place and I don’t want to discourage anyone from going there. So, for the continuation of this story, I’m just going to refer to where I was as Central Vietnam – and as for the beach town where I made my living, I’m going to give it the pseudonym “Biển Hứa Hẹn” - which in Vietnamese, roughly, but rather fittingly translates to “Sea of Promise.”   

Biển Hứa Hẹn truly was the most perfect destination! It was a modest sized coastal town, nestled inside of a tropical bay, with the whitest sands and clearest blue waters you could possibly dream of. The town itself is also spectacular. Most of the houses and buildings are painted a vibrant sunny yellow, not only to look more inviting to tourists, but so to reflect the sun during the hottest months. For this reason, I originally wanted to give the town the nickname “Trấn Màu Vàng” (Yellow Town), but I quickly realized how insensitive that pseudonym would have been – so “Sea of Promise” it is!  

Alongside its bright, sunny buildings, Biển Hứa Hẹn has the most stunning oriental and French Colonial architecture – interspersed with many quality restaurants and coffee shops. The local cuisine is to die for! Not only is it healthy and delicious, but it's also surprisingly cheap – like we’re only talking 90 cents! You wouldn’t believe how many different flavours of Coffee Vietnam has. I mean, I went a whole 24 years without even trying coffee, and since I’ve been here, I must have tried around two-dozen flavours. Another whimsy little aspect of this town is the many multi-coloured, little plastic chairs that are dispersed everywhere. So whether it was dining on the local cuisine or trying my twenty-second flavour of coffee, I would always find one of these chairs – a different colour every time, sit down in the shade and just watch the world go by. 

I haven’t even mentioned how much I loved my teaching job. My classes were the most adorable 7 and 8 year-olds, and my colleagues were so nice and welcoming. They never called me by my first name. Instead my colleagues would always say “Chào em” or “Chào em gái”, which basically means “Hello little sister.”  

When I wasn’t teaching or grading papers, I spent most of my leisure time by the town’s beach - and being the boring, vanilla person I am, I didn’t really do much. Feeling the sun upon my skin while I observed the breath-taking scenery was more than enough – either that or I was curled up in a good book... I was never the only foreigner on this beach. Biển Hứa Hẹn is a popular tourist destination – mostly Western backpackers and surfers. So, if I wasn’t turning pink beneath the sun or memorizing every little detail of the bay’s geography, I would enviously spectate fellow travellers ride the waves. 

As much as I love Vietnam - as much as I love Biển Hứa Hẹn, what really spoils this place from being the perfect paradise is all the garbage pollution. I mean, it’s just everywhere. There is garbage in the town, on the beach and even in the ocean – and if it isn’t the garbage that spoils everything, it certainly is all the rats, cockroaches and other vermin brought with it. Biển Hứa Hẹn is such a unique place and it honestly makes me so mad that no one does anything about it... Nevertheless, I still love it here. It will always be a paradise to me – and if America was the Promised Land for Lehi and his descendants, then this was going to be my Promised Land.  

I had now been living in Biển Hứa Hẹn for 4 months, and although I had only 3 months left in my teaching contract, I still planned on staying in Vietnam - even if that meant leaving this region I’d fallen in love with and relocating to another part of the country. Since I was going to stay, I decided I really needed to learn Vietnamese – as you’d be surprised how few people there are in Vietnam who can speak any to no English. Although most English teachers in South-East Asia use their leisure time to travel, I rather boringly decided to spend most of my days at the same beach, sat amongst the sand while I studied and practised what would hopefully become my second language. 

On one of those days, I must have been completely occupied in my own world, because when I look up, I suddenly see someone standing over, talking down to me. I take off my headphones, and shading the sun from my eyes, I see a tall, late-twenty-something tourist - wearing only swim shorts and cradling a surfboard beneath his arm. Having come in from the surf, he thought I said something to him as he passed by, where I then told him I was speaking Vietnamese to myself, and didn’t realize anyone could hear me. We both had a good laugh about it and the guy introduces himself as Tyler. Like me, Tyler was American, and unsurprisingly, he was from California. He came to Vietnam for no other reason than to surf. Like I said, Tyler was this tall, very tanned guy – like he was the tannest guy I had ever seen. He had all these different tattoos he acquired from his travels, and long brown hair, which he regularly wore in a man-bun. When I first saw him standing there, I was taken back a little, because I almost mistook him as Jesus Christ – that's what he looked like. Tyler asks what I’m doing in Vietnam and later in the conversation, he invites me to have a drink with him and his surfer buddies at the beach town bar. I was a little hesitant to say yes, only because I don’t really drink alcohol, but Tyler seemed like a nice guy and so I agreed.  

Later that day, I meet Tyler at the bar and he introduces me to his three surfer friends. The first of Tyler’s friends was Chris, who he knew from back home. Chris was kinda loud and a little obnoxious, but I suppose he was also funny. The other two friends were Brodie and Hayley - a couple from New Zealand. Tyler and Chris met them while surfing in Australia – and ever since, the four of them have been travelling, or more accurately, surfing the world together. Over a few drinks, we all get to know each other a little better and I told them what it’s like to teach English in Vietnam. Curious as to how they’re able to travel so much, I ask them what they all do for a living. Tyler says they work as vloggers, bloggers and general content creators, all the while travelling to a different country every other month. You wouldn’t believe the number of places they’ve been to: Hawaii, Costa Rica, Sri Lanka, Bali – everywhere! They didn’t see the value of staying in just one place and working a menial job, when they could be living their best lives, all the while being their own bosses. It did make a lot of sense to me, and was not that unsimilar to my reasoning for being in Vietnam.  

The four of them were only going to be in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple more days, but when I told them I hadn’t yet explored the rest of the country, they insisted that I tag along with them. I did come to Vietnam to travel, not just stay in one place – the only problem was I didn’t have anyone to do it with... But I guess now I did. They even invited me to go surfing with them the next day. Having never surfed a day in my life, I very nearly declined the offer, but coming all this way from cold and boring Utah, I knew I had to embrace new and exciting opportunities whenever they arrived. 

By early next morning, and pushing through my first hangover, I had officially surfed my first ever wave. I was a little afraid I’d embarrass myself – especially in front of Tyler, but after a few trials and errors, I thankfully gained the hang of it. Even though I was a newbie at surfing, I could not have been that bad, because as soon as I surf my first successful wave, Chris would not stop calling me “Johnny Utah” - not that I knew what that meant. If I wasn’t embarrassing myself on a board, I definitely was in my ignorance of the guys’ casual movie quotes. For instance, whenever someone yelled out “Charlie Don’t Surf!” all I could think was, “Who the heck is Charlie?” 

By that afternoon, we were all back at the bar and I got to spend some girl time with Hayley. She was so kind to me and seemed to take a genuine interest in my life - or maybe she was just grateful not to be the only girl in the group anymore. She did tell me she thought Chris was extremely annoying, no matter where they were in the world - and even though Brodie was the quiet, sensible type for the most part, she hated how he acted when he was around the guys. Five beers later and Brodie was suddenly on his feet, doing some kind of native New Zealand war dance while Chris or Tyler vlogged. 

Although I was having such a wonderful time with the four of them, anticipating all the places in Vietnam Hayley said we were going, in the corner of my eye, I kept seeing the same strange man staring over at us. I thought maybe we were being too loud and he wanted to say something, but the man was instead looking at all of us with intrigue. Well, 10 minutes later, this very same man comes up to us with three strangers behind him. Very casually, he asks if we’re all having a good time. We kind of awkwardly oblige the man. A fellow traveller like us, who although was probably in his early thirties, looked more like a middle-aged dad on vacation - in an overly large Hawaiian shirt, as though to hide his stomach, and looking down at us through a pair of brainiac glasses. The strangers behind him were two other men and a young woman. One of the men was extremely hairy, with a beard almost as long as his own hair – while the other was very cleanly presented, short in height and holding a notepad. The young woman with them, who was not much older than myself, had a cool combination of dyed maroon hair and sleeve tattoos – although rather oddly, she was wearing way too much clothing for this climate. After some brief pleasantries, the man in the Hawaiian shirt then says, ‘I’m sorry to bother you folks, but I was wondering if we could ask you a few questions?’ 

Introducing himself as Aaron, the man tells us that he and his friends are documentary filmmakers, and were wanting to know what we knew of the local disappearances. Clueless as to what he was talking about, Aaron then sits down, without invitation at our rather small table, and starts explaining to us that for the past thirty years, tourists in the area have been mysteriously going missing without a trace. First time they were hearing of this, Tyler tells Aaron they have only been in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple of days. Since I was the one who lived and worked in the town, Hayley asks me if I knew anything of the missing tourists - and when she does, Aaron turns his full attention on me. Answering his many questions, I told Aaron I only heard in passing that tourists have allegedly gone missing, but wasn’t sure what to make of it. But while I’m telling him this, I notice the short guy behind him is writing everything I say down, word for word – before Aaron then asks me, with desperation in his voice, ‘Well, have you at least heard of the local legends?’  

Suddenly gaining an interest in what Aaron’s telling us, Tyler, Chris and Brodie drunkenly inquire, ‘Legends? What local legends?’ 

Taking another sip from his light beer, Aaron tells us that according to these legends, there are creatures lurking deep within the jungles and cave-systems of the region, and for centuries, local farmers or fishermen have only seen glimpses of them... Feeling as though we’re being told a scary bedtime story, Chris rather excitedly asks, ‘Well, what do these creatures look like?’ Aaron says the legends abbreviate and there are many claims to their appearance, but that they’re always described as being humanoid.   

Whatever these creatures were, paranormal communities and investigators have linked these legends to the disappearances of the tourists. All five of us realized just how silly this all sounded, which Brodie highlighted by saying, ‘You don’t actually believe that shite, do you?’ 

Without saying either yes or no, Aaron smirks at us, before revealing there are actually similar legends and sightings all around Central Vietnam – even by American soldiers as far back as the Vietnam War.  

‘You really don’t know about the cryptids of the Vietnam War?’ Aaron asks us, as though surprised we didn’t.  

Further educating us on this whole mystery, Aaron claims that during the war, several platoons and individual soldiers who were deployed in the jungles, came in contact with more than one type of creature.  

‘You never heard of the Rock Apes? The Devil Creatures of Quang Binh? The Big Yellows?’ 

If you were like us, and never heard of these creatures either, apparently what the American soldiers encountered in the jungles was a group of small Bigfoot-like creatures, that liked to throw rocks, and some sort of Lizard People, that glowed a luminous yellow and lived deep within the cave systems. 

Feeling somewhat ridiculous just listening to this, Tyler rather mockingly comments, ‘So, you’re saying you believe the reason for all the tourists going missing is because of Vietnamese Bigfoot and Lizard People?’ 

Aaron and his friends must have received this ridicule a lot, because rather than being insulted, they looked somewhat amused.  

‘Well, that’s why we’re here’ he says. ‘We’re paranormal investigators and filmmakers – and as far as we know, no one has tried to solve the mystery of the Vietnam Triangle. We’re in Biển Hứa Hẹn to interview locals on what they know of the disappearances, and we’ll follow any leads from there.’ 

Although I thought this all to be a little kooky, I tried to show a little respect and interest in what these guys did for a living – but not Tyler, Chris or Brodie. They were clearly trying to have fun at Aaron’s expense.  

‘So, what did the locals say? Is there a Vietnamese Loch Ness Monster we haven’t heard of?’  

Like I said, Aaron was well acquainted with this kind of ridicule, because rather spontaneously he replies, ‘Glad you asked!’ before gulping down the rest of his low-carb beer. ‘According to a group of fishermen we interviewed yesterday, there’s an unmapped trail that runs through the nearby jungles. Apparently, no one knows where this trail leads to - not even the locals do. And anyone who tries to find out for themselves... are never seen or heard from again.’ 

As amusing as we found these legends of ape-creatures and lizard-men, hearing there was a secret trail somewhere in the nearby jungles, where tourists are said to vanish - even if this was just a local legend... it was enough to unsettle all of us. Maybe there weren’t creatures abducting tourists in the jungles, but on an unmarked wilderness trail, anyone not familiar with the terrain could easily lose their way. Neither Tyler, Chris, Brodie or Hayley had a comment for this - after all, they were fellow travellers. As fun as their lifestyle was, they knew the dangers of venturing the more untamed corners of the world. The five of us just sat there, silently, not really knowing what to say, as Aaron very contentedly mused over us. 

‘We’re actually heading out tomorrow in search of the trail – we have directions and everything.’ Aaron then pauses on us... before he says, ‘If you guys don’t have any plans, why don’t you come along? After all, what’s the point of travelling if there ain’t a little danger involved?’  

Expecting someone in the group to tell him we already had plans, Tyler, Chris and Brodie share a look to one another - and to mine and Hayley’s surprise... they then agreed... Hayley obviously protested. She didn’t want to go gallivanting around the jungle where tourists supposedly vanished.  

‘Oh, come on Hayl’. It’ll be fun... Sarah? You’ll come, won’t you?’ 

‘Yeah. Johnny Utah wants to come, right?’  

Hayley stared at me, clearly desperate for me to take her side. I then glanced around the table to see so too was everyone else. Neither wanting to take sides or accept the invitation, all I could say was that I didn’t know what I wanted to do. 

Although Hayley and the guys were divided on whether or not to accompany Aaron’s expedition, it was ultimately left to a majority vote – and being too sheepish to protest, it now appeared our plans of travelling the country had changed to exploring the jungles of Central Vietnam... Even though I really didn’t want to go on this expedition – it could have been dangerous after all, I then reminded myself why I came to Vietnam in the first place... To have memorable and life changing experiences – and I wasn’t going to have any of that if I just said no when the opportunity arrived. Besides, tourists may well have gone missing in the region, but the supposed legends of jungle-dwelling creatures were probably nothing more than just stories. I spent my whole life believing in stories that turned out not to be true and I wasn’t going to let that continue now. 

Later that night, while Brodie and Hayley spent some alone time, and Chris was with Aaron’s friends (smoking you know what), Tyler invited me for a walk on the beach under the moonlight. Strolling barefoot along the beach, trying not to step on any garbage, Tyler asks me if I’m really ok with tomorrow’s plans – and that I shouldn’t feel peer-pressured into doing anything I didn’t really wanna do. I told him I was ok with it and that it should be fun.  

‘Don’t worry’ he said, ‘I’ll keep an eye on you.’ 

I’m a little embarrassed to admit this... but I kinda had a crush on Tyler. He was tall, handsome and adventurous. If anything, he was the sort of person I wanted to be: travelling the world and meeting all kinds of people from all kinds of places. I was a little worried he’d find me boring - a small city girl whose only other travel story was a premature mission to Florida. Well soon enough, I was going to have a whole new travel story... This travel story. 

We get up early the next morning, and meeting Aaron with his documentary crew, we each take separate taxis out of Biển Hứa Hẹn. Following the cab in front of us, we weren’t even sure where we were going exactly. Curving along a highway which cuts through a dense valley, Aaron’s taxi suddenly pulls up on the curve, where he and his team jump out to the beeping of angry motorcycle drivers. Flagging our taxi down, Aaron tells us that according to his directions, we have to cut through the valley here and head into the jungle. 

Although we didn’t really know what was going to happen on this trip – we were just along for the ride after all, Aaron’s plan was to hike through the jungle to find the mysterious trail, document whatever they could, and then move onto a group of cave-systems where these “creatures” were supposed to lurk. Reaching our way down the slope of the valley, we follow along a narrow stream which acted as our temporary trail. Although this was Aaron’s expedition, as soon as we start our hike through the jungle, Chris rather mockingly calls out, ‘Alright everyone. Keep a lookout for Lizard People, Bigfoot and Charlie’ where again, I thought to myself, “Who the heck is Charlie?”  ",1,1743192720.0,AllureStories,1,1.0,False

Find his channel and reviews here:
 https://youtube.com/@mikekreischerreviews3420?feature=shared

My view of this ration may be tainted a bit since I enjoyed it in Texas while on vacation and enjoying beautiful scenery all around me!

This was a new country for me, 17 total now!

This ration has a best by date of 2021, so 4 years past at this point. To be honest, I was worried it may not be ok given the similarity in some components to Russian items.

Upon opening my fears disappeared as there were no rancid aromas at all, just smelled like a plastic bag which is perfectly fine in our hobby!

The bag contained 3 smaller clear bags with each meal being self contained. See pics 3-6 for each meal contents.

Pic 7 shows the veg caviar stuff which was the only component I did not eat because the tin it was in was pretty bloated. It smelled nice, exactly like salsa in my opinion!

There were 3 black tea bags and plenty of sugar. I drank all 3 teas using my tried and true method, 1/2 cup milk, 1 tsp sugar, and allow to sit overnight in the fridge. Made 3 wonderful milk teas with great black tea flavor! I make all my coffees this way too; note, this ration had no coffee. That tea on the 3rd meal Pic is the same as the other 2, the tea bag packaging was black on one side and silver on the other for some reason.

Pic 8 shows a biscuit with some of the apple jam. Those biscuits and that jam were great! Reminded me very much of the Russian apple jam. The biscuits were neutral in flavor, which was great because they can be used with pretty much anything that way. No staleness detected at all.

Pic 9 is breakfast. It was Millet with Beef. The millet seemed to taste sort of like corn meal but far softer. I fried this stuff and then mixed with busted up biscuits, hearty and flavorful with no salt needed, but I did add some ground cayenne pepper! There wasn't a lot of beef, but it was sufficient.  A lovely meal with a lovely view!

Pic 10 was lunch and boy was this awesome!!! It was cabbage soup with beef. Prep was one can of soup with one can of water and heat thoroughly.  This stuff was fantastic folks! So simple and yet so tasty! I added ground cayenne again and the 2nd half of the leftover millet with beef. Salt level was perfect. Made a fantastic hearty stew!!

Pic 11 is breakfast Day 2. This was the can of stewed beef. When I opened it there were 3 huge chunks of white fat which I removed because it was just so much. Trust me, this still packed a flavor bomb with just the right saltiness and with some added cayenne, perfect. Therevwas a slight metallic taste in this one. Crumbling up a few biscuits made it a hearty and complete meal!

Pic 12 is lunch Day 2. Buckwheat with beef. This got fried until nice and crispy, a dash of cayenne, and some biscuits busted up inside! Again, a great, hearty, and filling meal!

Pic 13 just shows a full house of those sexy Kazakhstan biscuits!

I'd encourage folks to try a Kazakhstan ration. Very reminiscent of Russian,  which makes since as the 2 countries border each other. Next, some fighting words I'm sure...this Kazakhstan may be better than Russian for one simple reason, the biscuits are far superior in both flavor and texture.

I am acquiring an in-date Kazakhstan ration in another trade here soon, so stay tuned for a comparison post perhaps!?

Enjoy the hobby!

1jm4e17,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jm4e17,Trip Report: 10 Days and 7500 Miles in Amtrak economy,"First things first: I had never been on an overnight train prior to this trip. Only ever day trips between Boston and NYC. Where did I go? I started in Boston, MA, and took the Lake Shore Limited overnight to Chicago. I had a few hours to enjoy the city before getting on the Empire Builder to Portland, OR. I spent an overnight there to shower and get some laundry done before hopping on the Coastal Starlight the next morning for a quick overnight to Emeryville, CA. I spent the afternoon exploring the Bay Area and stayed the night before hopping on the California Zephyr first thing in the morning. 2 days later I arrived back in Chicago and stopped in for a quick shower at the metropolitan lounge before taking the Lake Shore Limited the rest of the way home back to Boston. 10 days and 7500 miles later, I was thoroughly exhausted but so glad I did it. Here are some takeaways I had. 

Price: I purchased the USA Rail Pass back in January when it was on sale for US$299.99. I was able to complete this whole journey as well as 2 day trips to NYC from Boston with the 10 tickets. Hotels in Portland and Seattle were about $130 each, metropolitan lounge in Chicago was purchased with points, and food was about $300 more or less. In total probably spent $750 out of pocket. 

Food: I did most of my food shopping at overnight/major stops, specifically Trader Joe’s since they have a healthy selection of snacks and to-go items. The only meal I found myself purchasing on-board was breakfast; usually a coffee with oatmeal to start my days. 

Luggage: I brought one carry-on sized bag for clothing, a blanket, and a pillow as well as a personal backpack for my laptop and camera gear. 

Sleeping: This was my biggest worry going into this trip. Don’t get me wrong, they weren’t the easiest nights of sleep I’ve had, but thanks to always having an empty pair of seats to myself (minus the Denver-Chicago segment) I never had an issue getting at least 5-7 hours of sleep with the blanket and pillow I had packed. I’m a bit on the larger side (5’ 9 240) but had no issue getting comfortable with the help of some melatonin gummies. 

The views: For the most part, it wasn’t the most exciting scenery. Boston-Chicago is mostly greenery with a city here and there, and the midwest (Chicago - Nebraska and Denver - Chicago) was all pretty much beige and flat. HOWEVER the Empire Builder from Spokane, WA to Portland, OR, the Coastal Starlight, and the Zephyr from Emeryville, CA - Denver CO had some of the most amazing views. The cliffs along the Columbia River on the WA/OR border were otherworldly, and the fields and rolling hills of southern OR and northern CA were incredible. But the best views truly came from the Zephyr. The snow-capped mountains of California were a sudden but welcoming change from the 60 degree weather in the bay area a few days prior, and the Rocky Mountains with views over the great plains entering Denver are something everyone should experience. I have so many photos and videos I wish I could share with you all but I’ll limit it to a few for now. 

Delays: None. And I know I’m one of the lucky few but I can’t think of a moment where we were more than 30 mins late but had made it up by the next stop. Well done Amtrak. 

Final thoughts: This isn’t for everyone. If you have young kids, pets, responsibilities, a bad back, impatience, travel anxiety, etc, this isn’t for you. Me? A college student with a week off for spring break and a whole country to see? Different story. Anyone else my age reading this: pull the trigger. Go see the country. Fort Lauderdale is overrated anyway. ",53,1743192689.0,Amtrak,5,1.0,False
