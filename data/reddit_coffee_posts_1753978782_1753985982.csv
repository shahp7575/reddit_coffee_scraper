The Hamilton Beach 46111 Drip Coffee Maker stands out for its compact size and modern styling. It fits snugly under cabinets, which is a win for anyone working with limited kitchen counter space. I tried placing it in my already cramped kitchen, and it slid in seamlessly without looking bulky. The stainless steel accents provide a sleek touch that complements a variety of kitchen decor. Plus, the lightweight design (just 3.3 pounds) made it easy to move when I wanted to switch spots.  

It's worth noting that because of its size, this isn’t ideal for those who need multiple pots of coffee throughout the day. However, for tight spaces or single users, it’s nearly perfect.

**Ease of Use and FrontFill System**  
Making coffee with this machine couldn’t be more straightforward. The FrontFill system caught my attention because it eliminates the frustration of awkwardly maneuvering under cabinets. Simply swing out the brew basket and fill it with pre-ground coffee—no spilling grounds all over the place. The water reservoir also fills from the front, making it an overall user-friendly experience.  

Even my clumsy teenager managed to set it up without asking a million questions, which says a lot about the intuitive design. However, I did find that the lid to the reservoir needs a little extra push to close properly sometimes, which might annoy someone in a hurry.  

**Brewing Performance**  
This drip coffee maker is designed to brew up to 5 cups, which might seem small compared to standard 12-cup machines, but it works out perfectly for two people or someone who wants just a few fresh cups per day. The coffee comes out smooth with no bitter aftertaste, which sometimes happens with smaller coffee machines.  

I particularly enjoyed the programmable timer function, which lets you set the machine up to 24 hours in advance. There’s nothing quite like waking up to the smell of fresh coffee already brewed, and this feature worked flawlessly during my testing.  

**Winning Points**  
- Compact design ideal for small kitchens or apartments.  
- Convenient FrontFill system minimizes spills.  
- Programmable clock and timer are simple yet effective.  

**Features That Could Use Some Work**  
- The lid of the water reservoir occasionally requires extra effort to close.  
- Small capacity may be limiting for households with multiple coffee drinkers.  

**Auto Pause and Pour Feature**  
I’ve seen plenty of automatic pause features, but few work as cleanly as this one. During brewing, removing the carafe immediately paused the flow without causing any mess, which I really appreciated on my busier mornings. This is especially handy when you’re pouring a quick cup while waiting for guests.  

Although the function is neat, it could be a bit more seamless as the brewing resumes a hair slower than expected once you return the carafe. That said, those split seconds might not even register for most users.  

**Energy Efficiency and Auto Shut-Off**  
The fully automatic operation of this coffee maker extends to its energy-efficient auto shut-off feature. After two hours, the machine powers down to save energy. I’m someone who often forgets whether I turned off appliances, so this provided great peace of mind.  

For those concerned about safety and energy, this is a solid plus, though anyone wanting a longer warming window for their coffee may find the two-hour limit a touch restrictive.  

**Versus Competitive Options**  
Comparing this to larger drip coffee makers like the Cuisinart SS-15 or Keurig K-Classic, the Hamilton Beach model excels in its compact and space-saving design. Its straightforward functionality also makes it a fantastic pick for beginners. The competitors offer larger brewing capacities and advanced settings, but they’re bulkier and more expensive. 

On the lower-end spectrum, generic 5-cup coffee makers are available, but most lack the programmable timer and Auto Pause & Pour features that make this model stand out.  

**Price Worthiness**  
Given its features, this coffee machine offers excellent value for money. It falls into the budget-friendly range yet delivers functionality typically seen in pricier models, such as programmability and a sleek design. While you won’t get the fancy versatility of machines that brew pods and ground coffee interchangeably, what you do get is consistent, hassle-free coffee.

1me931m,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1me931m/writ_in_flesh/,Writ in Flesh,"A fierce burning on my thigh yanks my focus. My finger slips on the controller, and crimson splatters on my screen.

“Head shot! BOOM!” Don’s voice screeches into my headset and I yank it off, cursing.

I look at the burning spot. My birthmark seems a little inflamed. Did something bite me there?

“I was distracted, dude,” I yell into the mic.

“Excuses, bitch!”

I drop the headset and exit the game. Don will call me a sore loser, but I don’t care. I’ve warned him for the last time to stop calling me a bitch.

I press down on the skin next to my birth mark. The redness gets more vivid with the skin taut. I flinch as another searing pain shot through the spiral mark.

I’ve a love-hate relationship with my birth mark. Love, because it’s cool as hell.  Who else has a perfect, fibonacci proportioned spiral as a birthmark? Hate, because the universe seems out to get it. It’s easily aggravated. Insects love biting in that spot. Cuts happen to land there. In the summer heat, it rashes. In the winter, it cracks.

I grab a half-used tub of aloe vera and slather some on. The relief is instant, but short-lived. Another stab of pain.

It’s never been this bad before. I study the skin. The spiral is filling up with welts, such that it’s getting three dimensional on my skin.

I trace the spiral and the burn intensifies.

I think about going to the doctor. But it’s late, and I don’t want to pay extra for night charges. So I do the next best thing.

I down a bottle of wine, grab an ice pack, strap it to my thigh, and fall asleep.

\*\*\*

The man’s face is lit by candle light. He’s kneeling, bound. The veins on his forehead are bulging. His right eye is swollen shut. Red lines trace across the whites of his left eye. Sweat slicks his face and neck. His breath comes in laboured rasps.

“Let him go.” I hear myself say in a lower pitch than my actual voice. I feel the blood throbbing through my veins. An icy rage envelops me.

“Or?” a voice sneers. I look up at an ugly face full of glee. My brain tells me that the tall, heavyset man before me is called Naro. He walks over to the man with the swollen eye, and something flashes in the dull orange light.

A gaping tear blooms on the bound man’s chest. A guttural scream escapes the man before he squashes it. Blood spurts from the torn flesh.

I feel that tear in my heart. Sharp despair lines my gut. I want to make a rush at Naro, disarm him. But I’m bound too, I realise.

“Or I will spend the rest of my life making you pay,” I hiss.

“Do that. Live a long, healthy life. I wanna watch you try.” The man splits the bound man’s flesh again, carves out another chunk of meat.

This time, the man doesn’t make a sound. But his pain slams into my mind.

“Stop!”

“Say please.”

“Please.”

“Nope.” The man tears another chunk of flesh from the man’s arm. He holds the chunk in my face, the tendrils and muscles dripping blood.

I scream.

And I awake, soaked in perspiration. Fear cloaks my senses. It takes me a moment to realise I’m back in my bed.

I find the switch, and sit in the fluorescent light for a good twenty minutes before I’m able to move. It is unlike any nightmare I have ever had. It was so visceral, so real. And the heartbreak. The intense terror and pain. That crazed need to protect the bound man.

I’ve been playing too many violent games. I’m going to tone it down. Play Stardew Valley or something for a while.

I can’t take my mind off the dream. The emotions feel seared into my body. I’m still shaking by the time I’m sipping coffee at the table. I can’t imagine going into the office in that state, so I call in sick.

A heavy shadow clings to me the entire morning. There’s a crushing sense of loss I can’t make sense of.

My birth mark has turned a violent maroon. The welts are filled with pus. I’m burning up. It looks like calling in sick wasn’t a lie after all.

I get dressed, slowly. Even putting my arms through my sleeves hurt. I head out the door, and the sun hits my eyes like a hammer.

I groan and shield my eyes with my arm. I give up on public transport and call a taxi.

\*\*\*

The doctor is alarmed by my welts. He insists on an immediate incision and drainage procedure. I agree.

The pain is unbearable. I scream as he cuts the abscess open and drains the pus. It feels like he’s boring a hole in my thigh with a jet of boiling water. The doctor looks stunned by my scream, then miffed. “It doesn’t usually hurt,” he says, accusatorily. I want to punch him in the face.

He cleans the wound, each swipe of disinfectant feeling like acidic sandpaper on raw flesh.

I’m trembling and sweating in pain by now. The doctor stares at me, puzzled. “You have a really low pain tolerance,” he comments. I grip my fists tight and ignored him.

He gives me a course of antibiotics. Strong ones. And pills to bring down my fever. And sends me home.

When I reach home, I take the medication and pass out on the couch.

I awake at night from the pain. I undo the dressing, and see pus and blood pouring from the spiral. A wave of nausea sweeps through my stomach, and I dry retch.

I’ve barely laid back down before I pass out from the pain.

And the next dream begins.

I’m cradling the body of the man I saw. Calling his name. “Boe, please. Please don’t leave me. Please.”

I’m wrecked with sorrow. I’ve never felt anything of that intensity. That level of pain. That pure despair.

And rage. Such rage. It doesn’t feel natural for my body to be able to harbour such intense rage. I worry that my flesh might crack apart, and send forth waves of hatred and fury to demolish everything in its path.

I want to kill Naro. I need to kill Naro.

But I can’t get to him. I writhe in my helplessness and rage.

That’s when I make the terrible decision. One I never thought I’d turn to.

My family is more than familiar with spells and curses. And one curse, above all, was strictly forbidden. Used only once in our family’s history, by my grandmother.

My mother told the story often. I think telling the story helped her heal. Helped her make sense of it. My grandmother had only one daughter. My mum. My grandfather wanted more children. A boy, above all. But a birth complication had rendered my grandmother infertile.

So my grandfather had taken home a mistress. It slowly drove my grandmother mad. She had finally snapped, and cast a curse on my grandfather.

She sat down, wrote of a death - my grandfather’s. Then she carved a perfect spiral onto her arm. Carved it, while chanting strange words. My mother repeated those words often when she told the story. The first time she told the story, she left out the words. The second time, she said them in a trembling voice. Her tone became bolder over the years. I think it was her way of taking away its power, to show that she was no longer afraid of those words.

The strange words had a lyrical tilt. And were composed of simple syllables. I could see how my mother remembered them so clearly, so many years later. That, plus the trauma of it all.

My mother couldn’t stop her, and was too young to understand exactly what my grandmother was doing. Not until it was too late.

My grandmother ended the ritual by pressing the piece of paper, with grandfather’s death written, onto the spiral wound on her arm.

My grandfather died of a heart attack that night. Just like what my grandmother had written, on the piece of paper. So did my grandmother.

I sit up. I’ve no paper with me, but there’s cloth. I untie the cloth knotted around my lifeless husband’s wrists, and write, with his blood, on the long strip of cloth.

Pain, agony, death. I hesitate, then dip my finger in more blood. In this life, and the next.

Then I begin to scratch out a spiral, as perfect as I could make it, on my thigh. I’ve to press hard for my nail to rake the skin. I tear off a strip of skin, then another. I don’t flinch at the pain. At that point, with my husband dead beside me, the pain feels cathartic.

Naro comes in then. Looks at me in my madness, and laughs.

He just watches as I complete the spiral, chanting the familiar words spun from memory. He calls out to his men, “Look at this crazy bitch!”

I take the cloth with the blood written words, and I press it onto the spiral.

Naro just laughs, and laughs. Until the cloth begins to flame. I scream then. Pain tears through the spiral into my bones. The cloth burns into a blackened crisp, leaving just the spiral wound on my thigh.

Naro’s eyes widen. And he begins to clutch at his chest. He pulls his shirt aside. A spiral marks  his chest.

A spasm of pain rips through my spiral wound. I flinch, and moments later, Naro doubles over in pain. I grin.

\*\*\*

I awake to Don knocking on my door.

I push past the crippling headache and pain in every part of my body and open it.

“I feel like shit,” he says. He looks like shit. Pale, shaking, sweating.

“What the hell. Me too.” I weakly gesture for him to come in.

“What happened to you?” he asks once we’re seated.

“This,” I say, showing him the spiral of blood and pus on my thigh. “Think it got infected.” No way was I telling him about the crazy dreams.

Colour bleeds from his already pale face.

He stares at the wound on my thigh, a touch of horror in his eyes.

“Gross, huh?” I ask.

“It’s…” he stops abruptly, and just stares at my wound.

“I don’t know what happened. Bunch of welts, then this, after the doctor drained them. That reminds me,” I say and reach out to down the antibiotic pills.

“I…I saw it,” he sputters. “I thought it was just a stupid dream, but…”

“Saw what?”

“The spiral. I saw it. In a dream,” Don says, voice uncertain, almost embarrassed.

My jaw tenses. “What do you mean?”

“I saw…there was this…well this woman was carving it on her thigh. I…I remembered you had a birthmark right where she carved it. It looked…I thought of you…I thought maybe…I…after the dream, I thought of you and I just felt like I needed to come see you.”

A chill sips into my veins.

“Was there a man, dead? Tied up?”

He stares at me with horror.

“Yes. You dreamt of her too?”

“I was the woman. In the dream.”

He’s silent. He keeps staring at me. His pale face mirrors mine. His forehead is too, beaded with sweat.

Then silently, he pulls down the neck of his tee shirt.

A dark crimson spiral marks his chest.

I gasp. Another wave of pain roils through my body. Then it clicks. A stab of fear pierces my gut.

“You’re…you’re Naro. The murderer.”

His face darkens. I swallow.

“And you’re the one who doomed us both. For two lifetimes.”

Rage sweeps through my body. My face heats up.

“Because you murdered my husband,” I spit. Then I blink, surprised. The fury was sudden, intense.

“Your husband from a past life. Why the hell did you have to damn us both, this life too?”

I have nothing to say. But rage keeps rising, overwhelming me in waves. I want to reach out, slam his face into the table. To tear at his eyes.

But I bury the feelings, force myself to be logical.

“So, you don’t think it’s just a dream,” I say.

“Not if we both had it. And from different points of view.”

“The spiral on your chest, it appeared the day we were gaming?”

He nods. “Shortly after you logged off.”

It’s getting less and less likely that it was all just a series of coincidences.

“It’s getting worse,” I say. I slump over on the sofa. I can’t keep my head up from the weakness and the pain.

“Same.”

“Did you see how long it took? From the pain, ‘til death?”

“In the dream? No. I awoke after you…that woman was chanting, pressing stuff against the spiral.”

My legs are beginning to ache in a horrendous way. Like little cracks are forming in the bones.

“Why’s this happening now?” I ask.

He shrugs, “How the hell would I know.”

I study his face. He looks about the age Naro was in the dream. I don’t theorise out loud.

“So… we just…we die?” I ask instead.

“I was hoping you could undo this.”

“Me?” I say weakly. “I don’t know what this is.”

“Do you remember the words? What you…that woman did?”

“Sort of, not really. Not exactly. I…”

“You did this,” he snarls, grabs my shirt, face wrecked with pain. “You undo it.”

Rage surges once again, mixed with fear. “You did this. Murderer,” I bark, shoving him hard.

He stumbles back, then bends over in pain.

“Get out!” I cry, then pull out my phone. “Get out before I call the cops.”

He lunges at me, tries to grab at my phone.

I dodge, causing pain to ripple up my side.

I dial the police. The phone rings. He swears, turns, and staggers out of my apartment.

I hang up. Limp to the door, lock it. Then I slide to the ground, giving in to the pain.

\*\*\*

It’s night now. The pain has only gotten worse. I don’t even know how I’ve typed this all out. I keep having to stop, to let the roaring waves of pain subside before I can continue.

The wound is crusted up now, with new welts pushing the bits of dried blood up.

The medication doesn’t help. The painkillers don’t work.

Just two days ago, I was planning out a month-long trip for the end of the year. I was thinking of quitting. Changing jobs. Getting an internship at a botany design place.

Now I’m in almost constant, unbearable pain. And apparently, about to die.

My feet have turned purple. And the veins around my hands are blackened. I might call the ambulance soon. Maybe other doctors can help. I doubt it, in my heart of hearts, but it’s worth trying.

I think of the rage I felt in my past life, the rage that leaked over into this one. I understand why she did what she did, the woman who I might have been in the past life.

But I don’t want that fate. Not in this life. I resent the woman. I resent Naro. They should have kept their bullshit in their own lifetimes. Another blast of pain.

I’m calling the ambulance now. I don’t know how, but I’m going to fight this. Fuck Naro. I’m not dying with him. Not this time[.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkSeas/)",3,1753985784.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

4/08/2073

Transcript:

Slitted rays of sun stripe my apartment wall. The sun reflects so viciously off my mirror and into my eye, but I do not shift over. It feels warm on my face. As though the sun, the only unaffected bit of nature, is reminding me of its presence. I close my eyes and slow my breathing, yet I do not sleep. Those dreams are the only bit of escape I can get, a place that isn’t here. Only in sleep can I forget about the Flood. But when I am awake, no matter how hard I try, my situation is always in the background. It is always attached to me, yet I try my best to block it out like the contractions in my organs, the invisibility of my nose, and the electrical circuitry of my Cerebyre. It’s always there, part of me.

My alarm rings, and my head fills with noise. Tapping my temple, the alarm in my head stops and a timer in small green numbers projects into the top right corner of my vision, 5 minutes. Eventually, I relent and sit up in bed, the timer disappears. The Embedded Cerebyre flat screen I had saved up so much money for was covered in a film of dust and grime, around it was a multitude of empty food canisters and plastic bags. I rub my eyes and tap my temple, bringing up the Cerebyre menu in front of me. 10:43am. A list of things I typed out for myself to do for today is displayed. Clean hallway for floors 54, 60, and 65; Clean solar panels; Help Gabriel prepare dinner. You’d think that one wouldn’t be burdened with chores during the apocalypse, yet here I am. I hear a gentle knocking at my door. Whoever it was, they could not have picked a worse time. My Cerebyre pulls up a proximity call request from Leila. My annoyance quickly dissipates as I accept.

""Hector?"" The feminine sounding thought rings out in my mind.

""Yeah?"" I think.

“Can you open the door? I hate calling using the Cerebyre.”

""Sure thing…” I flick my finger and end the Cerebyre call as I walk towards the door. I push my thumbprint onto the padlock until the shifting of the deadlock dies. I open the door and am met with Leila. She’s quite short for her age, with long black hair and irises so dark they blend in with her pupil and make her eyes look so full.

""Took ya long enough fatass..."" she shoved me, trying to feign aggression despite a smile creeping onto her lips.

""I'm not even fat anymore""

""Staying in bed till 11 makes you a fatass."" There was a bag in her hand, swaying as she walked in. She plopped herself down at my small dining table and placed the bag on it.

""Whatever, what's up with the bag?""

“Your coffee machine still work?” She pulled out a see-through plastic bag full of dark powder. The sly smile on her face told me what I needed to know.

“If Hos finds out you stole from the supply, he’ll throw you off the roof.”

“It’s fine, we’ll only use a little bit. I’ll put it right back where it was, like it didn’t even happen.”

“alright then…” Hos’s intricate structure for the past 3 months was what kept us alive this long, so to steal something and desecrate that order felt blasphemous. But, it's Leila so I can’t snitch.

Hot coffee drips down into the coffee pot. Like a tsunami, it rushes through it and takes its soul, leaving behind only empty buildings and people. When it ends, I throw away the mushy remnants into the trashcan. I sit down across from Leila and pour the black essence into our cups.

“Look what else I brought!” She said plopping a bag of white sugar between us.

“Oh my god, Hos is gonna skin you alive when he finds out.”

“But he won’t,” She flippantly rolled her eyes. “Cmon, you can’t have coffee without sugar.”

Reluctantly, I scoop a hill of sugar and pour it into the coffee. Dissolving within as I stir it around. Leila does the same. I bring the mug up to my face and a warning projects into the corner of my vision, ‘WARNING. Liquids this hot can be incredibly dangerous. Please use caution.’ The popup dissipates as soon as I blink my eyes.

“Geez you still have safety warnings enabled on your Cerebyre?”

I look up at Leila, slightly surprised, “Huh? How’d you know?”

A look of pride sprawled across her face, “I can see the light from your I’Lashe”

The way the Cerebyre enables us to see its menu is through the I’Lashe. A single, slightly thicker, silver rod is implanted directly centered with the other natural eyelashes. This projects light directly into the eye, and thankfully not as harshly as the sun’s reflections. There used to be discussion around whether the direct light can harm your vision, but that’s hardly of any concern now.

“I mean, it’s nice to have y’know?” I say before I finally take a sip of the coffee. “Better to have any precautions than none when the world's ending.” At this, I see Leila's proud smile weaken, but she quickly regains her composure. Just because the boards of the hull straighten themselves out doesn't mean they have the same strength as before. It’s like object permanence, once it appears you know it's there, even if something covers it. She speaks again.

“Uhh… so what’s going on with Louis? He seems really disenchanted lately.”

“I don’t really know. I tried talking to him a couple days ago but he kinda just brushed me off. See what you mean though, he’s been really down.”

“I get that, but still. Y’know I’m surprised you’ve taken this all so well, with the whole Flood going on.”

“I mean, I’m just optimistic I guess. And why’re you surprised? You seem rather unbothered as well.”

“Just curious,” she says with an exhumed doubt.

Though Leila and I are extremely close, Louis and I are equally as close

Him and I met 3 years ago now, back when I worked at the Mezzio supply warehouse. I had been given nightshift, an affront to nature. The first week of that job had been the most miserable in my life. Horrible sleep, constant fatigue, and difficulty staying awake at work were just some of my woes. One day, I was incredibly close to dosing off at my break when I heard a voice, a real voice. The manager didn’t like actually talking, so he put us all in a Cerebyre Group so we could think to each other from wherever in the building. So, to hear somebody genuinely talk to me and not implant their stupid requests in my mind stunned me.

“Hey man, are you new?”

I looked up at the voice. It was a guy with glasses, around my height. He had black, wavy hair down to his shoulders and a faint mustache. Somebody you’d just pass by at the store without a second thought. He became my savior that night.

“Yeah, can you tell that easily?” I asked as I wiped the sleep from my eyes.

A toothy grin appeared as he spoke, “Yup. It fucks you up real bad when it’s your first time.” He skipped over and sat in the chair next to me.

“Tell me about it.”

“Y’know what? I’ll cover for you man, get some sleep”

I almost cried at these words. Imagine if someone stepped in and gave Atlas a break from holding up the heavens, that wouldn’t equate to a single nano-percentage of the relief that filled me in that moment. Whoever this man was, he was my complete and utter savior.

“Wait what? Dude you have to be joking”

“No I’m being for real. Feeling good today y’know?.”

“Please, you have no idea how big of a favor you're doing for me.”

“Don’t sweat it,” he said, fanning his hand.

“What’s your name?” I asked gratefully as I outstretched my hand.

He met my hand and shook it, “Louis, what about you?”

Ever since that day, Louis has been the most reliable guy in my life. The long grueling hours bled along slowly. Louis was my hemophilia. I finally began looking forward to work, everything is so much easier when you actually have someone to talk to. We would race with the carts and joust with Mezzio boxes. Eventually, we realized we literally lived on the same apartment floor. Our friendship continued to evolve, going from hanging out at work, to bars, to barbeques, and eventually just his apartment. In those three years, if I ever had an issue I could talk to him about it. We had the same favorite shows, the same favorite video games, hell the same taste in music. After all my years as an only child, this was the first time I felt like I truly had a brother. Someone who’ll always defend you, and be there for you no matter how annoying you can be to them. I was with him when it all happened.

“Huh- Thats weird” Louis said as his eyes gleamed, the familiar signal for Cerebyre usage.

“What, did someone leak your porn folder?”

“No… I don’t watch porn dickhead.” He looked at me with a thinly veiled gaze of seriousness. “I use my imagination,” he said, pointing at his head.

“Nasty.”

“Yeah yeah, whatever. Anyways, open up your Cerebyre.”

I double-tapped my temple and displayed the Cerebyre menu, the normal amount of ads and background activity was no longer there. “What the hell?”

“Is your Connection off too?”

“Yeah it is.” I pointed my finger and went to settings. Searching, it said. My Cerebyre was ‘attempting’ to connect, but it seemed to eternally load. The sisyphean circle spun and spun and I didn’t have hope that it would stop. Previously, we were watching a movie Louis had found on a ‘free movies’ website on his Cerebyre and he was projecting it onto his screen.

“Damn, the movie was getting good too,” I sighed and shook the popcorn crumbs off my chest.

“It's fiiineee, we’ll just have fun the old fashioned way!”

“...I like girls…”

“Damn… always ruining my damn day,” he said sarcastically. “But for real, I got something we could really do.” He stood up and walked over to a small cabinet he had under his window. Crouching in front of it, Louis had just pulled out a stack of CD’s when the room flickered. Like somebody had turned the light off and on, though the only light coming in was from the window. Both of our attention went to the glass. After 10 seconds of inactivity, Louis stood up and walked away from the window.

“That was weird.”

“Yeah, it wa-” before I could finish my sentence, another free falling object passed over the window and obscured the gleaming sunlight. It was fast. And large. At this, Louis moved his gaze to the window again just in time to see Mr. Higgins, the tenant above his room, plummeted past us.

“HOLY SHIT!” Louis yelled, we both ran to the window and peered out. My jaw seemed to be frozen, and my lip quivered. Did we just see a suicide? Before we could break the silence, another shadow passed in front of us, and then another. Glimmering shards of glass sprinkled down, adorning the free falling people barreling towards the sidewalk. It felt like I was in a dream, one that can only come from stress or sickness, and if it was, then I have yet to awaken. The rate of fallers increased. I remember catching a glimpse of one, I can’t remember any other features, what he was wearing or what his hair looked like, but I remembered his expression. The most authentic portrayals of fear cannot be compared to the face of utter horror and dread etched into that man’s head. That face can only be made once in one’s life, once and never again. It’s the face you make before dying. It was frozen on him, unmoving and stone like, as though an ancient artist had chiseled it.

I could not speak, nor could I move. All I could do was stare out onto this surreal, macabre display. Before long, shattering glass descended from every building in the vast LA skyline, and out them tumbled people. Thousands and thousands of people. Waves of squirming bodies like ants  descend like a sheet of snow off a roof and slam into the streets creating ever expanding piles of corpses upon corpses. The pedestrians were not spared from this self inflicted fate. People swerved their cars into store fronts, others continuously drove their head like a hammer on a nail onto the corners of concrete walls. Wherever you looked, you saw a dante-like ritual of suicide without explanation. 10 minutes passed. By then, there was no more movement or sound. The streets were either covered in the mountains of bodies or the expanding lake of blood. From my peripherals, I saw Louis turn his head towards me, but my attention was unwaveringly attached to the first spurs of waves. Subtly, movement came from the mounds of cadavers. Gentle squirming. Like a chain reaction, the movement of one moved onto the movement of another 2 and so on until every fatal hill was buzzing. Mangled corpses dragged themselves between one another and snaked under the surface. They clutched and dragged onto whatever they could. Blood covered every ripple and eventually it appeared like a mountain of shiny fire ants swarming a predator. The mountains began to expand, pushing themselves outwards and melting into others. A roaring ocean came of it. A forever fluid sea of bloody dead grasping out and reaching towards the heavens. This was hell on earth, the Flood.

Eventually Leila and I finished our coffee.

“Alright well, I better get started with chores.” Leila said as she stretched in her seat and stood up, both articles of stolen goods in her bag.

“Good, now my room won’t smell like shit”

“Haha, whatever jerk.” She said opening the door. “See ya later Hector.”

She left and once again, I became aware of my situation. I sat and thought for a while. What is the normal way to feel in the apocalypse? Despite Louis’s desperation and fear being detrimental to him and the group as a whole, is he not the only one with a valid response? I’m not sure if the way I’ve reacted to it all is the right way. Loneliness and fright are feelings I’ve felt before, but they have the same intensity now as they did before in my regular life. Perhaps it isn’t a case of ‘reacting the correct way’ but truthfully it is a matter of how you see this all.

The rest of my morning is spent completing the chores given to me by Hos. I sweep up the hallways, bumping into Ms. Goose on the 65th floor. I walk up the stairwell, making my way up to the roof to clean the solar panels of the grime that accumulates on them. I open up the door and a hot breeze trickles across my body like the warm breath of a beast. Normally, the roof was completely empty, but strangely, somebody sits near the edge looking out onto the crimson currents. My mind wanders away from my task and onto this figure, and the wavy black hair tells me who it is.

“Hey man!” I say excitedly as I promptly sit down next to Louis. He pays no mind to me, simply staring forward into the tinted neptune. Those writhing corpses with arms waving in the currents of their blood. Though, with how long we’ve survived without much incident, the immediate fear of their image no longer fills us. I observe wherever he’s looking at, but I couldn’t tell where it was specifically. “What are we looking at?”

Louis’s attention didn’t break as he said, “The Flood.”

“Well what’s with the sudden fascination?”

“It’s uh… nothing really” Louis said, finally looking at me.

We look at each other in silence, a palpable tension in the room feels like humidity on my skin. We both know he’s keeping something from me, and I look intently into his dull eyes, trying to perhaps nonverbally persuade further explanation. But no break. He continued to look at me without a single change in his expression. Completely unmoving. I furroughed my eyebrows and shifted my face and lips into a curled position. In our years of friendship, it was always this face that made him laugh. During team meetings in our time at Mezzio, I would make that face and stare at him from across the room. We were scolded a couple of times. This time though, his eyes remain glazed over, and not a single twitch in his expression gives way to amusement. He doesn’t laugh one bit, and he looks forward once again towards the scenery. My spirits quickly drop. The silence continues between us.

I break it, “it’s all to shit huh…”

Louis finally looks over to me with a different face, one of attention, “what do you mean?”

“The world I mean. Who knew this would be the way it ends.”

“Not me.” He said dryly, chuckling.

A slight pause, “What’s going on with you man? I mean, the Flood really has fucked us all up, but I feel like you’ve been feeling worse and worse as it goes on.”

I look over at him and see him ponder. His eyes look down at the Flood, a number of thoughts behind it. “I just want to, to escape.” He says defeatedly, “I never thought it would all come down to this. All my life, I’ve wanted a family, you know. A nice wife, little kids, a dog, and a house. I wanted it more than anything. But now, that will never be possible. The only thing worth living for is… well, you and the rest.” His eyes remain unchanging, not a tear nor a flicker.

I can’t really protest, because I know he’s right. We can’t lead a normal life anymore, not like this. “Maybe this will all end eventually. The Flood will rot someday, and maybe it will disappear.”

“No it won’t”

A timer rings out in my head, and judging by the slight light in Louis’s pupil, I could tell it was sounding for him too. Lunch time. I speak out, “It’ll be fine man, just hang in there. We won’t just survive, we’ll live too, I promise.”

I stand up, but he stays seated. The Flood has run through his being, stolen his soul and diluted him. And even if it can’t have his physical body, it has his life.

“Cmon man, let’s go get some food.” I beckon him.

“I’ll be there in a bit, don’t worry about me dickhead.”

I smile at the words, he’s still in there. “Alright your loss. Cya.” I turn over my shoulder and walk away, holding the doorhandle when he says,

“I love you bro.”

I pause, stunned because this has been the first time I’ve heard these words from him.

“You too”

I spoon chunks of pork up into my mouth, broth slowly rolling down my mouth and onto my chin dripping down on the table.

“Eww, why are you so fucking nasty,” Leila said with sarcastic judgement.

“Ghuat, is ghood.” I say through a mouth full of soup.

Individual conversations ring out across the 3 different tables in the small lobby on the 70th floor. My table usually has people actually speaking. The next table over is a bit of both. The last table, with Hos and Gabriel, is silent. They speak to each other through proximity calls. I wonder what they are discussing. The bowl in front of me is full of thick brown soup and pork. I sit across from Leila, an empty seat next to me. In contrast to my gluttonous devouring, Leila eats her food slowly, with a small paper towel she rubs her mouth with sitting next to her bowl.

“Where’s Louis?” She asks with concern in her voice.

I swallow my food before speaking, “Uh, I talked to him earlier on the rooftop. I came over for lunch and I asked if he was coming. He said he would in a bit.”

“How long ago was that?”

I sigh, “Like an hour ago.”

Leila reaches over and hits me on the head, not in aggression but more in a lecturing manner. “Dumbass. You should’ve brought him down here instead of leaving him behind. You know he isn’t doing good.”

“Well what do you want me to do, forcefeed him?”

“Whatever… I guess he’ll eat when he wants.”

My spoon scrapes against the bottom of the bowl suddenly, did I already finish it all? I look up at Leila and see she’s looking at me with a sly smile.

“Don’t say i-”

“Fatasssssssss”

Eventually, lunch ends and Leila leaves. She has a point. There was more I could have said to Louis, I could’ve spent more time convincing him. I ask Ms. Goose for a second bowl.

“Hungry dear?”

“No Ms. Goose, it’s for Louis”

“oh, that Louis boy! How’s he doing dear?”

The bowl warms my hands, “He’s doing okay”

Ms. Goose's aged face wrinkles into a compassionate expression. “Oh I hope so! That young man… hm, what’s his name? With the blonde ha-“

“Gabriel?”

“That one! Louis and him have been talking quite a bit. He’s an odd one my dear, I hope he doesn’t mess with Louis..”

“I see what you mean Ms. Goose. Thanks for the advice!” I politely respond as I walk away.

The Flood follows me in my mind as I walk to Louis’s room, but I pay no attention to it. The hallway is dim and depressing. Only every other light is illuminated, as ordered by Hos, and the dull black and whites and beiges of it all makes me feel as though I’m in a hospital. Each step echoes throughout the hall, each step gets me closer to Louis. I can feel the plan forming in my head. The wood is being pieced together with every step, the hammering of the nails rings out throughout the whole hall. I can see my Ark floating high, keeping us all alive. Louis is on it. The hammering continues as I walk towards his room, as I get to his door, and a hammer strikes from within his room. My finger is frozen at the door, ready to knock. Every one of these rooms has sound cancelling wallpaper, so an audible thud would need to be immensely loud.

“Louis?” I knock on his door, no response. I knock harder, still no response. I grip the door handle, ready to wrestle the door open, but it gives way immediately. Gently, I open up the door. The creaking of the hinges mixes with the dripping.

“Louis…?”

The bowl spills out onto the floor, and my Ark cracks, the hull bends and blood shoots in. I can see them all drowning in the bodies and becoming a part of them. They writhe forever now because my ship has broken. It does nothing but sink. I am alone at the top of the mast where the Flood reaches my foot. There is nothing there other than the roaring waves of corpses and the thundering heavens. I can’t save them all. I can’t build an Ark, not without Louis. There is a gun carelessly thrown on the floor. The dripping gets louder and my vision constricts. Louis sits slumped back in a chair, body limp. My eyes water, and everything looks distorted. All that's left is his jaw. The entirety of his forehead to the back of his head has been blown apart. Flaps of skin drip with gore at the back of his head and his matted hair is split down the middle. My vision gets fuzzy, as though my soul does not want to bear the weight of my sight. I couldn’t save him, I can’t save anyone. In between the visible brains and splurting blood vessels ripped open through the splitting of the red sea, there is a light. An angel of light deep within his head, at the bottom of the ocean. It blinks rhythmically, I know what it means. It whispers to Louis’s lifeless body, and I see his eyelid twitch. The devil is in his brain and it's telling him to join him in hell. He missed the Cerebyre brain implant. My knees buckled and my vision caved in on me. The walls of the sea crashed down on my mind, and before I knew it, I was waving into unconsciousness.

No. I can’t pass out. He’s dead, but if I don’t act, he’ll join the Flood. I need to get up. I need to destroy the implant. I need to stop it before it tells him the final number. As I stand up and face Louis, my brain fights for me to give in. My Cerebyre holds me back and keeps me locked but I push past it and I need to exorcise that demonic light from within his thalamus. I stumble towards him, his glazed over eye begins to move and twitch in its socket. There isn’t much time. I reach out towards his exposed brain, blood seeping out at all sides and I push my hand into his head. I wrap my hands around the squelching, spongy section of cerebral matter the Cerebyre implant resides, yet before I can pull it out and free him from sinking into the undertow, his lifeless eye darts to my direction. I’m too late. It pushes itself away from me and falls back in its chair. Its flowering head splatting on the floor and squeezing out a fan of blood. I look at my hand and see I hold a chunk of raw, fleshy brain, but there is no circuitry within it. Slowly, it gets up off the floor, spittles of chunky blood trail from where its head was to where its head is now. It stands up and stares at me, the gleaming apartment window behind it. The corpse's eye stares at me with an emotion I can’t comprehend. Louis is in there, and it looks at me with pain. The flickering light took him over. My muscles lock, I am chained up and I can’t do anything but watch my friend get dragged further into hell. With such an unfathomable fear and distress in its eyes, it shifts its gaze from me to the window behind it.

I manage to squeeze out “Louis… don’t”

Louis’s body dives headfirst into the window, an explosion of glass and brain matter and wood shards expel out around him as he tumbles into the Flood. My body fills with every emotion I could possibly feel and pushes me towards the window. I look down at it.

His body floats atop the Flood, the sea of bloody, writhing corpses that has completely sunk LA. The naked bodies grip out and bite and hold and pull on Louis’s corpse. He sinks below the snaking arms.

Cerebyre Thought Recording: #95

4/09/2073

Transcript:

Soft fabric kisses my skin and sunlight once again blinds me awake. I groan and shift over. Mist permeates my mind, enshrouding my thoughts. It doesn’t take me long to remember what happened. I don’t scream, nor do I wail. I lay silently, on my side and stare at the door. My mind isn’t flooded with guilt or sadness or confusion, instead, it remains empty. Is there something wrong with me? Why do I feel like I don’t care? Is it shock? An hour goes by I think, my Cerebyre alarm goes off, fuck you. Fuck Cerebyre, and fuck the Flood. I feel a knot in my throat start to constrict me, and my eyes begin to burn sharply. No longer does it sit in the corner, but it sits atop me. Staring into my face, no longer trying to stay in the background. It chokes me and tells me my fate is identical to Louis’s. It looks just like him.

Just then, a knock at the door shifts my attention away from him, the pressure leaves from my throat and eyes and chest, yet it only migrates to my brain. Hos walks in carrying a small box in his hands.

“Hey Hector”

“Hey”

Hos sits on a wooden chair next to the bed, almost like a medical consultation. He’s a bit shorter than me with a thick mustache and a buzzcut and a bit of a country accent slipping through his normal speech, “How you feelin’?”

“Uhh, I don’t know… Okay I guess” I look up at the ceiling, the shadows and lights make the shape of a face.

“You sure?”

I face Hos. “Yes I’m fucking sure,” I snap at him. A bit of silence comes between us.

Why am I yelling at him? He didn’t do anything to me. “I-I didn’t mean that, I’m sorry Hos.”

“Don’t sweat it bud.”

“Why’d you come?”

Hos paused for a moment, “To see how you were doing.” A look of concern peers at me with compassion.

“Thanks, I really appreciate it. But honestly, I’m alright.” As much as I want this to be a lie, it feels like the utter truth. I don’t feel a thing

“What happened after I passed out.”

Hos leaned back in his chair, his eyes still on me. “I was up a couple a floors when I heard that shot. When I get there, Leila was right outside the doorway looking in, white as a ghost.”

“Who could blame her…”

“I know. She had her hands over her mouth. I told her to move when I saw the room. You was on the floor. I got Gabriel to help me pick you up n’ take you back over here to your room n’ we washed you up and left you on your bed.”

“Is uh, is Leila okay?”

“She keep insisting she is, but she got a horrible poker face. It really shook her up.” I can only imagine.

Hos sighed, “On another note, while we was cleaning up Louis’s room…” I shivered at the name. “...we saw he actually left somethin’ for ya.” He handed me the box. It was cardboard, a material one rarely saw nowadays. My name was sprawled across the top in dark pigment.

“Thanks Hos, I really appreciate this,”

“Don’t mention it” Hos stood up from his seat and rubbed the back of his neck. “If you need to talk to anyone, I’ll always lend an ear for ya.”

Hos was a strong man before and after the Flood began. He would always let us know that if we ever needed help moving or repairing anything, we could call him. Thus, whenever we discussed a possible leader role, it was only natural that it would end up being him. Truthfully, I look up to him more than anyone else. I look into his eyes and he still has that hope, I can see the mast and the flag and the hull reflecting off his eyes, yet that light fails to touch me. For Louis stands between us, monstrous and bloody, he absorbs that mirage of living a full life. His cavernous head scatters that light into thousands of shining specks which can not work as individuals. They all scatter around me anyways.

“I’ll have Leila come by every hour or so, if you need anything just let her know. Feel better Hector, okay?” As Hos walked out the doorway, he looked back at me and said, “Speak of the devil.”

Hos’ departure juxtaposed Leila’s entrance into my room. Hos wasn’t kidding. The usual brashness in her eyes was instead exhumed as doubt. No attempt was made towards her physical features for how could one worry themselves with self image after witnessing something so horrid.

“Hey loser” she stopped and stood awkwardly in the middle of the room, her previously shining eyes were now glistening with tears.

“Hey Leila” I tried my best to give at least a half hearted smile. It felt as though fish line ran through my lips and tried to yank them shut. A shiny reflection ran down her cheek and to her chin, falling off and darkening the floor. She sniffled and wiped the trail left by the tear. And she laughed it off.

I pat the edge of the bed as I sit up and lean against the headboard. She follows suit and gently lowers herself onto the edge, her back arched forward and her arms crossed affront her abdomen. There's silence between us for a moment.

“What happened?” She asks unceremoniously. The question forces me to relive the memory only hours old. Drip, drip, drip. Blood falls down and darkens the floor.

“Uh…”

“Oh I’m sorry, I-” Leila quickly stands up, but I reach out and touch her hand.

“Hey, it’s fine. I’ll tell you.” She sits back down and listens guiltily.

I run her through what I had witnessed up to the moment I passed out. I tried my best to describe it in an almost medical way, pulling whatever emotion I may have and currently feel out of my account. It is as much for her own sake as it is for mine. I finished and she sat silently. I could tell the whirlwind going on in her mind was eating away at her nerves. It was a telling silence, like there were things unsaid just waiting to be invited in, so I do.

“How do you feel? About all this”

She slowly flinches, and looks in my direction. Dark strands of hair blend in with her full moon eyes and tell of those nightly feelings. Emotions that need not come into the sun lest they are perceived and thus become true. Not unlike my own experience. Yet Leila and I are different in that I innately keep it hidden within. Unconsciously or not I can not know, but my body does not let my attachment to him cloud me. Quite different from her, for that darkness is told in the night sky of her image, so much dimmer than before. Her mouth opens and the sun stops patiently right before the horizon. And there it stays.

“Just a bit worried, that’s all.”

I know there is so much left in that darkness, silhouettes and structures, but I can’t force her to illuminate it all. I do not know the extent of her issues, but I will support her regardless.

“Alright… but please remember,” she looks at me intently, “I’ll always help you, no matter what.”

“Thanks fatass” she says with a tired, yet genuine smile on her lips. This quickly dissipates as she speaks once again, “I didn’t mean to make this all about me, I’m sorry… How’re you feeling Hector?”

I pause. Do I owe her some of my own vulnerability? No, it’s not whether I owe her or not, it’s whether she deserves it. I have my own dark corners, yet if I relay them to her, I worry that they will darken her even further. I don’t want to crack that masquerade she has, for I know how crucial it can be. And yet, I still yearn to spill out. Reach out the oblong shadows of sunset towards her and reveal all of myself, and help us both.

“I’m okay Leila, don’t worry.”

Eventually, I am left alone once again. The square shape sits awkwardly in my hands. As my fingers gravitate towards the lid, I feel the pressure entering my body once again. Louis is inside of this box. All the doubt and guilt in my heart seeps out like radiation and chokes every nerve and vessel. Would it bring me closure? Or would it crush me even more, bringing every bit of that moment back into me. Is it worth risking all of the motivation I have for our survival, just to linger on him? Either way, no matter where I go, he’ll be clutching onto my back, and my hand will never feel clean. I’m sorry Louis, but I have to forget you. I push away the pressure, burying it into the sea floor and the watery walls crash down and submerge it 40 miles down. I need to be like Hos, I need to focus on saving as many as I possibly can. But I know it doesn’t work. I push it into the ground yet I am the earth. Though I don’t think about it, nor do I feel for it all, it will always be inside of me. It will come again, but all I can do is put the box under my bed and pull my blanket over me. I lay once again, the morning light seeps in angularly and catches on my mirror. The sun glares into my eyes, and I pull the blanket over my head.",1,1753985733.0,u_Aleggs_lftdm,0,1.0,False

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one.

You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship.

Just wanted to come here and vent a bit. I’m a 29M from a business background, currently going through the arranged marriage process - and I honestly find it super frustrating.

I was diagnosed last week and today took my starting dose: 30mg of Elvanse. I took it with a protein rich breakfast, skipped my usual morning coffees and headed to work. Stayed hydrated all day.

The medication helped me get things done. I didn’t have to think twice about menial tasks, I just dived straight in and completed them. The reason I’m disappointed, though, is that I felt no more ‘present’ and focused than I usually do. I felt the same overstimulation I always do: the feeling that a dozen burly thoughts are trying to squeeze past each other through a tiny doorway at the same time, so much that, in the end, none of the thoughts actually make it through. My brain works so hard and yet it feels like I’m thinking about nothing. When I actually put my mind to delineating a thought, it was still really hard to focus on anything. Just really hard in a different way. 

The state of mind I want to live in is that completely grounded state of mind you might have after a heart to heart conversation with a friend, in nature, where your conscious thought is neither wading through thick soup nor bursting ahead before it can walk. I want all that dissociation I feel on a daily basis to fade away, so that I feel ‘present’. I’ve heard ADHD-ers can indeed get to this state of mind on a regular basis with the help of meds, but today felt like anything but that.

I swiftly crashed at 2pm and have felt extremely low since. 

I guess I wanted to feel closer to what I think of as my true personality on meds, but ended up feeling even more distant from that personality.

I really don’t like indulging in talking about myself usually, so all of this seems a bit silly. I wish I didn’t seek help for ADHD in the first place and just lived ignorant to all of it, I feel an imposter about it already.",2,1753985165.0,ADHDUK,2,1.0,False

I was recently prescribed 15mg of mirtazapine (for night) to help me with my insomnia and seroxat (12.5 CR) for mornings to help with my mood. Previously, I used to take seroquel or zyprexa for my symptoms - BPD and MDD - and especially for sleep because I struggled with insomnia or waking up terrified/with debilitating anxiety and they did help most of the time. 

The antipsychotics did make me groggy the next day but mirtazapine is on a whole other level!! I had 3 servings of coffee and had problems keeping my eyes open. 

Outside of this, I am a relatively active and healthy person. I lift 4x a week and love to move but I feel like my whole day is gone to fatigue and drowsiness and I don’t like that. Did not even have energy to eat haha.

It's not all my fault. I started taking antidepressants last year, an SSRI, a tricyclic one for sleeping, and an antipsychotic that I stopped taking now. That + stress binging + not exercising anymore led me to this horrible body, with constant friction rashes, stretch marks, and can't cross my legs.

I also miss a lot of the bad side effects of Ana. Like not having periods, I'm a trans man and that felt validating. My chest was way smaller. I was also cold all the time, which meant I could wear hoodies all the time (I loved it). 

And I miss the self control I had to not eat, to deal with hunger, to workout when I didn't want to, etc.

1me8q99,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1me8q99/uncover_how_the_lancord_cord_organizer_transforms/,Uncover How the Lancord Cord Organizer Transforms Kitchen Appliance Storage Review,"The LANCORD LANCORD-C Cord Organizer for appliances, a nifty accessory aimed at taming the jungle of wires sprawling across your countertop, quickly caught my attention. With the promise of keeping kitchen and household appliances neat and orderly, I was curious to see if this item could live up to the hype. As someone who often struggles with cords taking over my limited counter space, giving this product a test drive seemed like a natural fit.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The design of this cord organizer is simple yet incredibly thoughtful. Constructed out of high-quality soft rubber material, it feels durable and safe to use. The bendable rubber bottom was a nice surprise as it perfectly adheres to curved or flat surfaces. I tested the soft rubber on devices like my coffee machine and air fryer, both of which have unique shapes, and it clung firmly. There's an eco-friendly vibe here, too, with the material being non-toxic and safe for daily use around food preparation areas. Its modern but low-profile design effectively blends with almost any appliance without sticking out like a sore thumb, a feature I appreciated in my minimalistic kitchen.

**Ease of Installation**  
Applying this cord organizer could not have been easier. I followed the product’s installation instructions precisely—cleaning the appliance’s surface beforehand and waiting the recommended six hours for the adhesive to set. I used it on metal, glass, and plastic finishes to ensure it lived up to its compatibility claims. Each time, it was a breeze to set up, and I loved how forgiving the reusable Nano Tape adhesive was. No sticky residue or gunky aftermath when repositioning—bonus points for that convenience alone! 

[Is LANCORD LANCORD-C discounted? Find out on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b0c5t5mq26/)

**Suitability for Various Appliances**  
This cord organizer caters to an impressive roster of appliances, from toasters and kettles to hair dryers and mixers. I tested it extensively with my pressure cooker (it was, after all, ranked #1 in Pressure Cooker Accessories), and it worked like a charm. The upgraded design, which accommodates both thicker and longer cords, was highly beneficial. Unlike other similar products, this one didn't leave wires loosely hanging or semi-managed. My previously unruly blender cord stayed perfectly wrapped after hours of use—talk about kitchen efficiency!

**Performance and Adhesive Strength**  
The adhesive is probably this product’s pièce de résistance. The Nano Tape boasts impressively strong adhesiveness, and from my testing, I can confirm it’s not just marketing fluff. The organizer stayed put despite heavy usage of my mixer and air fryer, two appliances I use almost daily. Even when jostled or moved, there was no hint of detachment. While other reviews mentioned adhesives failing with time, I didn’t encounter any such problems even after extensive testing over a couple of weeks.

**Positives**  
- The upgraded design makes it versatile, accommodating thicker and longer cords seamlessly.  
- Reusable Nano Tape ensures it’s eco-conscious and easy to reposition.  
- Premium, non-toxic rubber feels sturdy yet flexible enough to adhere to various surfaces.  
- Works well across multiple appliance types and materials.  

**Critiques**  
- Appliances need a completely clean and dry surface for the adhesive to hold optimally.  
- The six-hour waiting period after installation might be a minor inconvenience for users who want instant results.  
- Limited color options (only the standard black) might not satisfy everyone’s aesthetic preferences.  

**Market Rivals**  
While LANCORD’s cord organizer scores high on durability and adhesive reliability, it’s worth comparing this with a few other contenders in the market. Products from companies like Wrap-It Storage offer similar adhesive cord management solutions but often struggle to stick to curved surfaces effectively. On the other hand, brands like CordSafe provide locking mechanisms for added security but come at a higher price point. What gives LANCORD a competitive edge is its blend of affordability and the practical use of nano-adhesive material, which not many rivals seem to integrate as effectively.

**Quality for Price**  
Is the product worth the investment? Speaking from experience, I’d say yes. The multi-purpose usability combined with sturdy construction and eco-conscious materials makes it an excellent value for money. Finding good cord management that doesn’t compromise on adhesive quality or reusability can be a challenge, and this organizer strikes a good balance between cost and efficiency.

1me8i1w,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInReviews/comments/1me8i1w/can_the_brentwood_ts10_rice_cooker_truly_simplify/,Can the Brentwood TS-10 Rice Cooker Truly Simplify Your Cooking Routine?,"Testing out the Brentwood TS-10 was an unexpected delight for someone like me who’s a self-proclaimed kitchen gadget enthusiast. I’ve tested my fair share of small appliances, but this 5-cup rice cooker had a mix of simplicity and practicality that made it stand out in a sea of similar products. From its sleek stainless-steel exterior to the way it flawlessly cooked a small pot of rice, it was quickly evident why this compact device has remained a favorite for so many. But let’s dive into what stood out, what didn’t, and how it compares to other options on the market.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing I noticed is the clean and understated design. The Brentwood TS-10 doesn’t try to be flashy, but the stainless-steel finish paired with the tempered glass lid adds a modern touch. Its compact size is a blessing if you don’t have much counter space like I do. We’re talking about a cooker that takes up less real estate than a coffee maker, making it ideal for small apartments, dorm rooms, or spaces where every inch counts. The removable non-stick pot felt of good quality, which I appreciated because cleaning non-stick coatings can sometimes be nightmarish, but this one lived up to its promise of easy cleaning. 

**Ease of Use**  
Here’s where the Brentwood rice cooker shines: simplicity. You push one button, walk away, and come back to perfectly cooked rice. That’s it. No scrolling through a digital display or troubleshooting advanced settings. It automatically switches to a keep-warm mode once cooking is done, so I didn’t have to worry about food getting cold if I got caught up in binge-watching a series (not that I’ve done that… recently). That said, it might leave power users wanting more options, but for someone looking for functional and hassle-free cooking, this is hard to beat.  

[Check Brentwood TS-10 price on Amazon.](https://appliancedirectory.com/p/b003chavhk/)

**Performance and Versatility**  
While it’s sold as a rice cooker, this little powerhouse isn’t a one-trick pony. Apart from rice, I tried it with quinoa, steel-cut oats, and even soup. Everything came out surprisingly well-cooked. One weekend, I whipped up a batch of chili for lunch using this tiny machine, and I was impressed with how evenly it heated the meal. The capacity is enough for a couple or a small family but bear in mind that it won’t work for big dinner parties unless you’re batch cooking. I also loved that I could watch the food through the transparent glass lid. Frankly, it felt oddly satisfying to see the bubbling without the need to lift the lid every five minutes to check progress. 

**Positives**  
Some of its key benefits left a strong impression:
- Intuitive one-touch operation.  
- The automatic keep-warm setting makes mealtime flexible.  
- Compact design perfect for tight spaces.  
- Great results with additional foods like soup and oats.

**Limitations**  
Every silver lining has its cloud, and there were some areas where this rice cooker could improve.  
- Limited 5-cup capacity might feel restrictive for larger families.  
- Lack of advanced cooking options like custom timing or steaming functionalities.  
- The lightweight build might make it less durable over an extended period of daily use.  

**Competing Brands**  
I’ve had the chance to use other budget-friendly rice cookers in a similar price range, like the Aroma Housewares 8-Cup Cooker and the Hamilton Beach 8-Cup Rice Cooker. The Aroma model had a slight edge in terms of maximum capacity—it can prepare more rice at once and comes with a steaming tray for veggies. On the other hand, the Hamilton Beach model offers digital programming, which adds convenience but might overwhelm someone looking for simplicity. What sets the Brentwood option apart is its plug-and-play design and portability, making it ideal for users who need a straightforward kitchen partner rather than a tech-packed gadget. If you’re seeking an uncomplicated appliance that gets the job done well, this one delivers.

**Value for Money**  
Evaluating its price-performance spectrum, the Brentwood TS-10 punches above its weight. While it might lack some features like programmable timers or a steam basket, it compensates by being reliable and incredibly user-friendly. For those on a budget who aren't seeking too many bells and whistles, this rice cooker truly embodies smart spending. It’s a solid choice that doesn’t break the bank while managing to become a dependable part of your kitchen routine.

1me8gyu,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthatbook/comments/1me8gyu/book_about_a_divorce/,Book about a divorce,"Twelve years of marriage. Twelve years with Jack, my childhood sweetheart turned millionaire husband. And now, he's fallen for the new receptionist at his company.

She's pushing forty—not as pretty as me, not as fit, nothing special at all. Yet in just six months, she's managed to give Jack something I couldn't: emotional fulfillment.

Exhausted, he looked at me and said, ""If we divorce, you can have the house, the car. Olivia, just… let me go.""

I lowered my gaze and whispered, ""Alright.""

Then I bought a calendar and circled a date.

Divorce countdown: 30 days.

Forty minutes after Jack confessed his affair and asked for a divorce, I slid the papers across his desk. The agreement was simple: the house, the car, full custody of our child—all mine. Plus a lump sum of $2 million for support. After that, he'd be free. No more obligations. No more us.

Jack was on a conference call when I walked in. His eyes flickered when he saw the words ""Divorce Agreement,"" but he barely reacted. Just a nod.

I left without another word.

To make things easier, I packed up everything of his—three suitcases' worth. Clothes, toiletries, even the dusty childhood photos from the attic. Then I spotted our wedding portrait tucked in the corner.

There we were—young, radiant, wrapped in each other's arms under golden sunlight. Back when he'd pull me close and murmur, ""Honey, I love you so much. I'm the luckiest man alive.""

We met in college. Back then, Jack was just a broke kid in worn-out sneakers. I had plenty of admirers, but he was different—calm, kind, effortlessly charming. We married right after graduation, and he built his company from the ground up.

When I got pregnant, I quit my job to focus on our family. I poured everything into making our home perfect—cooking, cleaning, raising our child. Meanwhile, Jack balanced late-night meetings with helping me with the baby and smoothing things over with his mother.

To everyone else, we were goals. The perfect couple.

But then, the late nights became more frequent. ""Meetings,"" he'd say. Sometimes, he wouldn't come home at all.

Friends joked I should keep an eye on him. I laughed it off, but doubt gnawed at me.

So I showed up at his office a few times with late-night snacks.

Everything seemed normal—just a bunch of exhausted employees in a conference room. And Rachel, the receptionist, sitting quietly at her desk.

Early forties, average height, thin, short hair. Nothing striking—except her voice. Soft, warm, completely at odds with her plain appearance.

She smiled when she saw me.

All these years, I'd imagined this moment. I'd braced myself for a glamorous secretary, a young intern, maybe even a high-powered businesswoman.

Never in a million years did I think it'd be Rachel.

From what I'd heard, she'd been through a messy divorce herself. This job was her fresh start. She came in early, memorized everyone's coffee orders, even baked treats for the office. Some coworkers even bought lunch from her.

I'd actually felt bad for her. Once, I told Jack to go easy on her—she'd been through enough.

His response? ""The company isn't a charity. I've already warned her about side hustles.""

At the time, I teased him for being heartless.

Now? Now I realize he was just pissed she had to work extra to make ends meet.

As for why he chose today to drop the bomb—

This morning, like always, I made him hangover soup after he stumbled in drunk.

He stared at the bowl like it offended him, then pushed it away. After a long silence, he finally looked up, exhaustion in his eyes.

""I've been seeing someone,"" he admitted. ""For six months. Hotels, late nights… it's Rachel.""

My heart shattered.

Rachel.

The name hit me like ice water.

And just like that—our perfect life was over.

Chapter 2

By the time Jack wrapped up his meeting and stepped out, I'd already eaten, cleaned the kitchen, and settled onto the couch with the TV on.

Like nothing had happened.

He headed for the shower but paused halfway, realizing there were no towels. Out of habit, he called from the bathroom.

""Honey, where's my bath towel?""

I didn't even glance his way. ""Already packed it in the suitcase. If you don't mind, use mine for now. I'll toss it later.""

Silence stretched between us.

When Jack finally emerged, his eyes landed on the three suitcases lined up by the door.

He sat across from me, nudging the divorce agreement toward me with his fingertips.

""I can give you $1.5 million upfront for child support, and the rest in monthly installments—""

I cut him off. ""No. One lump sum. I doubt she'd want you keeping in touch with me anyway.""

Jack frowned. ""The kid isn't just yours. I have a right to be part of his life. I know this is my fault, and I'll make it right—but don't use him as leverage.""

I hit pause on the show and met his gaze.

""The affair is your fault, so paying up is fair. The house and car barely scratch the surface of what you've got. And our son? I've raised him since day one. He's sensitive. He needs attention. Tell me—how much energy will you really have for him while you're off playing newlywed?""

I flipped open the agreement. ""Two million covers everything. If you want to play doting dad later, wire the money to his account. I'll set up a card for him.""

Jack let out a sharp laugh. ""Olivia, I never pegged you for someone so hung up on money. Is that all you care about?""

""What else is there?"" I shot back. ""Did loving you ever get me anywhere?""

He froze. Then, jaw tight, he snatched a pen and signed.

By morning, he was gone.

Our son bounded out of his room, wrapping his arms around me, bubbling over about some happy dream he'd had. As I listened, I gently broke the news—Dad's work would keep him away for a while.

Instead of his usual plea—""Dad, when are you coming home?""—he just nodded. ""Oh. That's okay. I've got you, Mom.""

My throat closed up. I ducked into the bathroom before the tears could spill.

Divorcing Jack hurt, but the real ache was failing our son—denying him the family he deserved.

Except it wasn't my fault.

After dropping him at school, Jack and I filed the paperwork. Thirty days until it's final.

Back in the car, I circled the date on my calendar.

# Best Red Plaid Pants 2025: reviews & Buying Guide

Red plaid pants have surged in popularity, becoming a statement piece in modern wardrobes.No longer confined to customary or festive contexts, they offer a bold and versatile option for expressing individual style. For fashion-conscious consumers looking to add a vibrant touch to their attire, red plaid pants represent a compelling blend of classic pattern and contemporary flair.This guide explores the best red plaid pants of 2025,providing in-depth reviews and practical advice to help you make the perfect purchase.

## Key Features Analysis

The ideal pair of red plaid pants should balance style, comfort, and durability. The material composition, fit, and pattern design all play critical roles in determining their overall quality and suitability for different occasions.

**Fabric Composition:** The majority of high-quality red plaid pants are crafted from a blend of cotton and polyester, often with a touch of spandex or elastane for added stretch and comfort. A good blend should offer breathability, durability, and resistance to wrinkles. The ideal ratio usually involves a higher percentage of cotton for softness and breathability, combined with polyester for structure and longevity. For example, a blend of 60% cotton, 35% polyester, and 5% spandex provides a cozy fit with good stretch and wrinkle resistance. Different blends, such as wool blends for colder weather, can also be suitable depending on the intended use.**Plaid Pattern Design:** The design of the plaid pattern itself is crucial. A well-executed plaid design features balanced colors, clean lines, and precise intersections. Consider the size and density of the plaid – larger patterns make a bolder statement, while smaller patterns offer a more subtle look. The colors within the plaid should complement each other, typically combining shades of red with black, white, gray, or even subtle hints of green or blue. Look for patterns where the plaid lines align seamlessly at the seams, especially at the pockets and waistband, indicating attention to detail and quality craftsmanship.**Fit and Cut:** Red plaid pants come in various fits, including slim fit, straight leg, relaxed fit, and wide leg. The most flattering fit depends on your body type and personal preference.Slim-fit pants offer a modern,streamlined silhouette,while straight-leg pants provide a more classic and versatile option. Relaxed-fit pants prioritize comfort and ease of movement,and wide-leg pants create a fashion-forward,statement look. Ensure the pants have a comfortable and adjustable waistband, plus functional pockets that don't distort the shape of the pants.Consider the inseam length to ensure a proper break at the shoes.

**construction Quality:** Check the stitching, seams, and hardware of the pants. Look for reinforced seams, particularly at stress points like the crotch and pockets, to ensure durability.The zipper should be sturdy and smooth, and the buttons should be securely attached. Higher-quality red plaid pants frequently enough feature a lined waistband for added comfort and structure. Inspect the quality of the pockets; they should be made of a durable fabric and deep enough to hold everyday essentials without bulging or tearing.

**Care Instructions:** The care label provides essential information on how to properly clean and maintain your red plaid pants. Most cotton-polyester blends are machine washable but may require specific washing instructions, such as washing in cold water or on a gentle cycle. Some pants may require dry cleaning to maintain their color and shape, particularly those made from wool or delicate fabrics. Avoid high heat when drying to prevent shrinkage and damage to the fabric. Following the care instructions carefully will prolong the life and appearance of your pants.

**colorfastness:** A key factor in the longevity of red plaid pants is their ability to retain color after repeated washing. Look for pants made with dyes that are resistant to fading. Before wearing, consider a pre-soak in cold water with a bit of vinegar to help set the dyes and prevent bleeding. When washing,always wash red plaid pants with like colors to avoid color transfer. Air drying can help preserve color better than machine drying.

For a night out, try pairing them with a black top, heels, and statement jewelry. The key is to balance the boldness of the pants with complementary pieces that enhance the overall look.

**Are red plaid pants suitable for all body types?**
Yes, red plaid pants can be flattering on all body types, but the fit and style should be chosen carefully. Slim-fit pants can work well for those with a slender build, while straight-leg or relaxed-fit pants are more forgiving for curvier figures. High-waisted styles can help elongate the legs and create a more balanced silhouette. Ensure the pants fit properly in the waist,hips,and thighs for optimal comfort and appearance.

As we head into 2025, the market is flooded with options, making it challenging to choose the right one.This buying guide aims to help you navigate the world of koi rugs, presenting our top picks and providing the expert advice you need to make an informed decision. We will consider factors such as material, design, durability, and price to ensure you find the perfect koi rug to enhance your home.

## Key Features Analysis

The best koi rugs offer a combination of aesthetic beauty, durability, and comfort. Several key features contribute to their overall quality and appeal.**Material Composition:** The material used in a koi rug substantially impacts its durability, texture, and maintainance requirements. Common materials include wool, nylon, polyester, and polypropylene. Wool offers a luxurious feel and excellent stain resistance but can be more expensive and require professional cleaning. Nylon is a synthetic fiber known for its strength and resilience, making it a good choice for high-traffic areas.Polyester is a cost-effective option that is soft, stain-resistant, and easy to clean. Polypropylene, also known as olefin, is highly durable, water-resistant, and ideal for outdoor use.

**Design and color Palette:** Koi rugs come in a wide variety of designs, ranging from realistic depictions of koi fish in their natural habitat to more abstract and stylized interpretations. The color palette can vary from vibrant and bold hues to subtle and muted tones. Consider the existing decor of your space and choose a rug with a design and color scheme that complements it. Look for rugs with high-quality printing or weaving techniques that ensure the colors stay vibrant for years to come. Intricate details and a well-balanced composition will enhance the rug's visual appeal.

**Size and Shape Options:** Koi rugs are available in various sizes and shapes to suit different spaces and needs. Common shapes include rectangular, round, oval, and square. The size of the rug should be proportionate to the room and the furniture arrangement. A large rug can anchor a seating area and create a sense of cohesion, while a smaller rug can add a pop of color and visual interest to a specific area. Measure your space carefully before making a purchase to ensure the rug fits properly and enhances the overall aesthetic.

**Construction and Weave Quality:** The construction and weave quality of a koi rug determine its durability, texture, and overall longevity. Hand-knotted rugs are known for their remarkable quality and intricate designs, but they are also the most expensive. Hand-tufted rugs offer a good balance of quality and affordability, while machine-made rugs are the most budget-kind option. Look for rugs with a dense pile and a tight weave, as these tend to be more durable and resistant to shedding. The backing material should also be strong and well-attached to prevent the rug from slipping or sliding.

Key features to consider when purchasing a koi rug:

   Durable materials
   Vibrant and detailed designs
   Appropriate size and shape
   High-quality construction

**What is the best material for a koi rug in a high-traffic area?**

**How do I clean and maintain a koi rug?**

Wool rugs typically require professional cleaning to avoid damage and maintain their quality.Synthetic rugs like nylon, polyester, and polypropylene can usually be spot-cleaned with mild soap and water.Regular vacuuming is essential to remove dirt and debris and prevent them from becoming embedded in the fibers. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the rug's colors and fibers.

**Are koi rugs suitable for outdoor use?**

Polypropylene is highly resistant to water, mildew, and fading, making it ideal for patios, decks, and other outdoor spaces.

These rugs can add a touch of style and comfort to your outdoor living area.**How can I prevent my koi rug from slipping on hardwood floors?**

Not to punish you. Not to play games.
But because I was scared.
Scared of how much I felt.
Scared of how deeply I loved you, maybe from the very beginning.

And you…
You were the rock in our relationship.
You leaned in. You made sure we were okay. That I was okay.
You were always the one who came back to mend what I broke.

Our time ended long before either of us wanted to admit.
And I’m sorry I left when things were darkest for you.
You were fighting your way through so much.
For the first time, you were facing your inner demons, working through everything you’d bottled up for so long.
I know you wanted to get better. You even started therapy.
For you? For me? For us? I’ll never know.
But I was so damn proud of you for making that step.
You were brave.

Somewhere along the way, I lost you.
You said you’d come back.
You said you'd send me the message you’d been working on for more than 10 days.
The message that had turned into a journal. A kind of therapy for you.
So I waited.
Quietly. Hopefully. Painfully.
But you never did.

So I left.
Burned the bridge. Again.
Only this time, you didn’t mend it.

Since then, I’ve been chasing echoes.
For months I’ve tried to recreate *us* in other people.
But nothing came close.

And when the last connection ended, everything inside me collapsed.
Not because of him.
Because of you.
Because I never let myself feel the weight of losing *us*.
The love. The pull. The magic that felt like it came from another lifetime.

So I reached out.
Because I wasn’t okay.
And you had been my safe place.
But the silence told me:
The bridge was truly gone. Ashes, this time.

I’m sorry for leaving when maybe you needed me most.
But I needed to survive, too.
Still, I should’ve never disappeared the way I did.

I don’t even know why I’m writing this now.
I just know I miss you.
I hope you’re okay.
I hope you’re still fighting, still growing, still healing.
I hope you know I’m proud of you.
That I’m still rooting for you.

I still see you in everything:
In my daily Starbucks coffee order.
In Lindt chocolate.
In red wine glasses.
And when the calendar says *9th*.

1me89ik,https://www.reddit.com/r/prediabetes/comments/1me89ik/stelo_first_24_hrs_huge_spikes/,Stelo First 24 hrs - huge spikes,"Hello

My FBG went 101 this year (usually was high 80s-low 90s), A1C was 5.7.   I am out of shape and my BMI is 26, so am getting back into exercising and eating better (I had injuries which undid everything I achieved during Covid).  I got a Stelo yesterday afternoon (not eligible for any equipment through insurance unless diabetic) yesterday.  The first couple hours were weird with mostly good levels but also some ""Below 70s"".

How unreliable are the first 24 hrs? 

So far I have seen that:

1) When I saw the initial Below 70s, I ate 1/2 cup low fat cottage cheese and 5 triscuits.  It went up to 139 but within 1/2 hr was back to 85.

2) After a late dinner (8pm) of 2 braised skinless chicken breasts with bell peppers, 1 cup of 1% milk  and 1/2 cup of Rice Select Royal Blend rice. It went from 120 to 133 and dropped quickly and by 9:30 was back to 84.  

But my glucose went up multiple times over the night up to 125 or so, and in the morning was around 95 at 5am and rose quickly to 120s while having coffee (with non-sugar creamer).

3) Breakfast I had two eggs worth of Egg Beaters, with some peppers and onions, 3 raspberries, 3 blackberries and a slice of Dave's Good Seed thin-sliced bread with a tiny smear of Smart Balance.  The whole meal only had 18g of carbs. This spiked my glucose from 120s up to 174, dropping quickly and an hour later was 115.  

Is this all just normal 1st day fluctuations, or is my spike in reaction to carbs still valid really as bad as it seems?  Seems like I cannot handle even small amounts carbs at all?  People seem to disagree on whether a quickly decreasing spike is really bad?  

I am not eligible for anything through insurance but thinking of buying a glucose meter  for comparison purposes too. My LDL is way too high now so I have fix that at the same time - Dr offered Crestor which he said would likely raise my FBG/A1C.

  
Thank you!

The Bones of the City


LORNE PARK

This is where she kept him quiet.

Not hidden.
Not small.

Just… still.

Because some things grow best without noise.

Lorne Park is shoreline and shadow.

Old wealth. 
Older trees.

The sound of wind coming through the space between houses,

Like a whisper you’re not meant to hear just yet.

This is not a neighborhood that announces itself.

It’s a place you only notice when you leave it;

And find yourself searching for the silence again.

It rests west of the Toronto.

Tucked along the lake,
Where Mississauga exhales into something softer.

Where roads curve gently as if asking permission.

Where the air smells like rain before it arrives.

Here, Kai was raised.

Among manicured lawns,
Light gravel driveways,
And a quiet that had weight to it.

Not oppressive.

But watchful.

Lorne Park does not rush.

The land is curved for deliberation.
The homes are spaced just wide enough to hold secrets;
But close enough to feel a sigh at 2 a.m.
There is money here.

But not ostentation.
Prestige without parade.

And beneath it, presence.

Kai learned early:
Don’t say too much.

Let the wind carry what needs to be known.

And hold the rest in your posture.

The lake was never far.
It didn’t call him.

It listened.

Cold. Constant.
Clean in that ancient way.

He didn’t play on those beaches.

He walked them.
Thinking. Listening.

Feeling the quiet as something alive.

Lorne Park’s shore is not like Sunnyside, in Toronto.

It doesn’t celebrate.
It contemplates.

This is where Kai learned the shape of sacred silence.

The houses here are old.

Not in wood, but in memory.

Ancestry without ancestry.
Whiteness built on erasure.

But Kai’s presence shifted that.

The way the sun fell differently when he stepped outside.

The way old neighbors paused when he passed-Not out of suspicion,

But recognition they couldn’t name.

This is land that once forgot itself.
And he was born to remind it.

Lorne Park is not where he found himself.
It’s where he was kept intact
Long enough to be ready
For what was coming.

The sacred grows slow.
And sometimes;
The land that raises you

Doesn’t know,

You are its prayer answered.

The Halls of Lorne Park
Senior Year, First Month

SPARTANS


The halls had seen them before.

But not like this.

Lorne Park smelled the same, floor polish, burnt coffee, hallway heat-but something in the air had shifted. 

It was the first month of senior year, and the Spartans didn’t walk the halls anymore.

They moved through them.

Like current through wire. Like gravity with names.

Kai came first.

Always quiet, always early. His Spartan jacket hung open over a black hoodie, sleeves white, body red, his number 5 stitched sharp in white across the back.

The stitching was tight. 
Worn smooth at the edges. 
That number had weight now.
 
Teachers knew it. 
Students remembered it.

He didn’t move fast, didn’t look around, but people stepped aside when he passed.

Not out of fear. 

Just instinct.

Like some part of them knew: make room.

His pants sat low, slim black denim over long legs, cinched at the waist but never tight. 

Just enough to suggest, not declare.

The line beneath hinted at something blessed. 

A shape curved subtly forward, like gravity pulled different on him.

Not showy. 
Not loud.

Just... there.

One sophomore saw it and dropped her water bottle. 

A boy two lockers down froze mid-sentence.

Kai didn’t notice. Or if he did, he never gave it air.

That was the thing.
He wasn’t trying.

And somehow, that made it worse.

His headphones hung dead around his neck-unplugged. 

He liked to hear the world raw.

His steps matched the tile lines without trying, and when the morning bell rang, he didn’t flinch. 

He just turned the corner, and the rest followed.

Mike was next.

Tall. 
Biracial. 
Hazel-eyed. 

Broad-shouldered in a way that made desks groan when he sat down. 

His hoodie was a shade off black, sleeves shoved up past his forearms, sketchbook tucked under one arm. 

He didn’t talk unless he had to. But when he did, people listened.

Not because of volume, because of tone.

Mike’s voice carried weight, like it knew the shape of silence and didn’t use it lightly.

Then came Aspen.

And the hallway noticed.

The jacket was the same, white-sleeved, red-bodied, Spartan crest across the heart, but on him, it never quite closed.

His frame had outgrown it two grades ago. 

Broad chest, wide back, the kind of thick arms that made fabric stretch and stay stretched.

His walk wasn’t cocky, but it had momentum.

Like he couldn’t slow down if he tried.

Like swagger was a natural disaster.

His jeans-low, dark, sprayed tight, did the worst job containing what the hallway had whispered about for years.

It wasn’t lewd. 
It wasn’t loud.

It was just undeniable.

The bulge sat heavy, forward, curved like it knew the way. Not obscene, but legend.
A pressure that made a few students glance, then look away too fast, cheeks red.

A few looked again.

Some didn’t look at all, but still walked slower when he passed.

Aspen never adjusted.

Never hid.
He didn’t weaponize it.
He just was.

Sequoia appeared beside him like breath before a storm.

Platinum hair down, slick and soft with a faint lilac ombré tipping the ends. 

Four-inch heels clicking like punctuation. 

Black mini skirt and white cashmere crop top cutting past the edge of school code.

Her shades-Chanel, oversized-stayed on indoors.

No one questioned it.

She didn’t smile. 
She didn’t nod.

She didn’t need to.
The air moved for her.

Some said she and Aspen had fire in their blood. 

That when they walked together, mirrors cracked.

Not because they looked the same, because they reflected the same power, two directions at once.

They moved like a wave.
Not coordinated. 
Just in rhythm.

A group you felt before you saw.

The Spartans didn’t speak as they passed the science wing.

A few lockers clanged shut too loud.
A junior stepped aside without realizing it.
A teacher checked the time and frowned, even though they weren’t late.

Kai said nothing.
He didn’t have to.
He just kept walking-centered, even, unknowable.

And the rest of them synced to his silence.
-----

Ms. Patel’s Domain

First Period – English, Room 206

First period was English. 

Room 206. 

Second floor. 

Morning sun slanting in hard and gold.

The Spartans didn’t rush. 
They moved in when the bell was still echoing.

Not late. 
Not early. 
Just… timed.

Ms. Patel glanced up once, then back down at her notes. 

She didn’t need a second look. She knew the presence when it entered.

She was new last year. 
Early thirties, sharp-cut bob, dark lipstick, eyes that read everything. 

She didn’t try to be cool. 
That made her cooler.

Taught Shakespeare like he lived next door.

Taught essays like they could kill or resurrect.

The Spartans took their row at the back.

It wasn’t assigned.
But no one else tried to sit there.

Aspen dropped his bag with a thud. 

Slouched wide. 
Legs spread. 

Pen in mouth, already tapping a rhythm no one asked for.

Sequoia sat beside him-fluid, flawless, pen already out, paper folded like a letter to herself. 

She smelled like something that cost more than most teachers made in a week.

Mike took the edge seat, leaned back, arms folded, sketchbook out but closed.

Watching. 
Always watching.

Kai went for the window. 
Always did.

He liked to see the sky change while she talked about betrayal and power.

He didn’t open his notebook.
He didn’t need to.

“Phones away. 
Books open. 
Eyes forward.”

Ms. Patel’s voice cut the room like clean glass.

A few students shuffled. 
One girl coughed to fill the silence.
 
Aspen smirked. 
Sequoia twirled her pen. 
Mike yawned without opening his mouth.

Ms. Patel wrote “Julius Caesar” on the board in dry white strokes.
Below it:

Betrayal. Brotherhood. Power.

The sun hit the edge of her chalk. 

The words glowed faint.

Kai looked at them like they meant more than the syllabus.

“So.”

Her voice had no startle to it. Just steel wrapped in silk.

“Who decides when the knife goes in? 

The traitor? 
Or the friend?”

Nobody answered.

Kai’s eyes didn’t move. 
But his fingers twitched.

Just once.

The room felt heavier for a breath.

The AC hummed.

A light above them flickered.
Aspen tapped his pen louder.

Sequoia glanced sideways like she felt something.
Mike’s gaze cut to Kai. 

Just a flicker. 
Just enough.

Kai didn’t blink.

He just stared at the board. 
At the word power.

Like it was his name written in disguise.

The bell rang like it didn’t mean anything.
Backpacks dragged. 
Desks scraped.

The room emptied fast-kids already half-checked out, brains on burritos and iced coffees.

The Spartans stayed seated for a beat longer.

Kai stood first.

Shoulders relaxed, hand brushing his notebook even though it was still blank. 
He hadn’t written a word, but he’d heard everything.

Ms. Patel’s eyes flicked to him.
Just for a second.

Not quite a smile. 
Not quite a warning.

Like she saw something... and decided to let it pass.

Kai gave a single nod. 
Then walked out.

Aspen stretched hard, his spine cracking like applause.

“If Caesar had a dick like mine, Brutus would’ve stayed loyal.”

Mike didn’t laugh. 
Just shook his head.

Sequoia didn’t even look up.

“You’re a walking HR violation.”

The hallway was already buzzing, kids rushing past, lockers slamming, the cafeteria call in the air.

But when the Spartans walked through, space opened.

Not out of fear.
Just gravity.

A junior turned too fast and dropped her phone.
A teacher said nothing, but adjusted his tie.

Kai didn’t notice the glances.
Or maybe he did.
But he didn’t care.

His bulge shifted with the rhythm of his walk-barely outlined beneath the denim, but there. 

A quiet weight. 
A secret half the school kept for him.

They hit the stairs.
Took the back doors out.

Stepped into sunlight like they owned it.
----

Lunchtime Thrones 
Outside, Near the Quad

Lunch hit like a release valve.

Students spilled from the school like light through a crack.

Backpacks swinging, voices rising, sneakers slapping pavement.

But the Spartans didn’t spill.

They poured-slow, full, steady.
Their table by the stone steps near the quad was waiting.
 
Always had been.

Kai sat first. 

Quiet, precise, apple in hand. 
His body long and lean, denim just soft enough to suggest something heavy at rest. 
His thighs spread without posture. 

Just ease.
The shape below was there.
Not obvious.
Just… true.

A weight in the fabric. 

A hint of geometry that memory would make louder than sight ever dared.

Sequoia arrived like she’d been shot from a commercial.
Sunglasses on. 
Salad untouched. 
Legs crossed like a magazine cover.

She tilted her face to the sun and didn’t speak.

Aspen dropped in last.
A loud grunt. 
Denim creaking. 
Legs wide. 

Jacket half-off his shoulder like it refused to obey.

“Tell me this isn’t a lawsuit waiting to happen,” he muttered, tugging once at the pinch in his crotch.

His bulge pressed forward-obvious, but casual.
Like it had nothing to prove and nothing to hide.

Not vulgar.
Just… there.

The kind of shape you pretend not to notice until you realize you're still thinking about it three periods later.

Kai bit his apple.
“Still not that big.”

Mike didn’t even look up.
“He says that every week.”

Aspen grinned.

“It’s evolving.”
Sequoia deadpanned:

“If it gets any smarter, it’s getting its own parking pass.”

Laughter broke like thunder.

Loose. 
Loud. 
Joyful.

A few sophomores turned. 
A teacher stepped out, saw the table, and stepped right back in.

Kai leaned back and let the moment happen.

The sun. 

The friends. 
The noise.

Aspen shifted. 
One knee over the other.
And the fabric at his front rose with him-slow, forward, like it wanted out.

No one said a word.

But a junior with a juice box across the lawn forgot how straws worked for a full ten seconds.

They were seniors now. 
But not grown. 
Not yet.

They were still boys in bodies becoming men.

Still soft in places. 
Still searching.
But the shape of power was already there.

For now?

They had this.

A throne in sunlight.
A table with stories.
And enough heat to make legends start whispering.
-----


History Class - Room 118

By sixth period, the building was glazed with fatigue.

The light had changed, low and amber, cutting sideways through blinds that never closed right.

You could taste the end of the day in the air.

You could feel it.

The Spartans came in two minutes late.
No apology. 
No excuse.

Mr. Sutton looked up, pen paused in his left hand, but didn’t say a word.
He just ticked something on the attendance sheet and kept talking.

Aspen entered first,
Jacket slung over one shoulder, white T-shirt thin across his chest, the outline of him almost too clear in the sunbeam slicing across the floor.

He dropped into his seat like the chair was built for him.

Sequoia slid in behind him, gum snapping, her phone already in hand. 

Her heels clicked once on the tile-just once-but the sound carried like prophecy.

Mike nodded once at the board, didn’t bother to fake interest, and started sketching in the margin of his notes.

A warrior. 
Glowing eyes. 
Something with wings and ash.

And Kai;
He took his place two rows back, near the window, where the light hit sideways and the hum of the hallway still echoed faint.
He didn’t speak.
Didn’t move much.

But something around him... 
shifted.

The light above his head flickered.

Not once.
Three times.

A pulse.

He stared at the board like it was a language he’d already translated.
Mr. Sutton’s words blurred at the edges, like sound underwater.

Aspen leaned to the side, his knee brushing the thigh of the girl next to him.

Intentional?
Always.

She blinked, smiled, looked away too fast.

Aspen didn’t follow up. 
He just sat back, stretched once.
And when he crossed his legs under the desk, the fabric of his jeans bunched forward-subtle but live.

Like something resting.
Or waiting.

Kai didn’t notice.
He was watching the light again.

A sudden click.

Mr. Sutton’s projector stuttered. Then froze.

Kai’s phone vibrated in his pocket.

No message. 
No call.

Just a flicker of heat.
And then-gone.
He opened his notebook.
Blank.

Then he flipped the page,
And found words already written.

Not in his handwriting.

“You’re not crazy.”
Just that.
No explanation.
No name.

Kai closed the notebook slowly.
His face didn’t change.

But his chest rose-just a little deeper than before.

Sequoia looked up once.
At him.

Like she knew something.
Like her brother wasn’t the only one carrying a shadow.
And then the light above Kai

 burst.

Just a pop.
A single bulb.

The class flinched.

Aspen didn’t.

Mike looked sideways.
Mr. Sutton sighed and kept talking.

The rest of the period passed in static.

Notes were taken. 
Questions asked. 

Laughter tried and failed.

But the air never settled again.
-----


Saturday Afternoon. Cold Bright Day.


They didn’t need a plan.
It was Saturday, and the kind of cold that burned clear-sunlight like glass, sky stretched tight, breath visible but fading fast.

Mike’s old SUV was already half full when Kai slid into the back seat.

No one said it.
But they all needed this.
Motion.

Aspen was in the passenger seat, seat back halfway reclined, sleeves rolled to the elbow like even the wind couldn’t tell him what to do.

He tossed a bag of sour candies over his shoulder without looking.

“Kai eats first. 
Or we all die.”

Kai caught it one-handed.
Smirked.

That was Aspen’s way of saying you good? without asking.

Sequoia was already adjusting the mirror-fixing her gloss with the kind of concentration that made other girls nervous.
Her phone buzzed once. 

She ignored it.

Mike drove like he moved: calm, grounded, slightly over it.
He didn’t rush. 
Didn’t lean.

He just got them there.

The drive to the lakeshore wasn’t long, but it felt holy.

Music blasted-Aspen’s playlist, of course.

Soul. Trap. Funk. 

Something old, something filthy.
They all knew the words, but no one sang.

The windows were down.
Sequoia’s hair whipped wild in the wind.

Kai leaned his head against the glass, eyes half-lidded.

Not asleep. 
Just… listening.

The cold didn’t bite him.

It spoke.

“You think we’ll remember this?”

Aspen asked suddenly, over the music.

No one answered right away.

“Depends,” 
Mike said. 

“On what comes next.”

Sequoia scoffed.

“What comes next is me getting out of this frozen colon of a country.”

“We love you, too,” 
Aspen muttered.

Kai said nothing.
But his hand flexed once-fingers curling into a fist, then opening.

Like something had passed through.

They parked by the rocks.

That familiar stretch of shoreline where city met water, where broken fence met spray-painted concrete.

Seagulls wheeled above.
The lake churned slow and wide.

Mike killed the engine.
No one moved right away.
Kai stepped out first.

The wind caught his jacket.
The sunlight hit the curve of his body through his shirt, outlined him, lean and long, the front of his jeans tugged slightly forward from the way he stood.

Not obvious.
Not posed.

Just that pull, like fabric remembering shape.

A stranger across the park glanced up.

Then again.
Kai didn’t notice.

He was staring at the lake.
----

They tossed a football for a while.

Mike moved like gravity.
Aspen like chaos.

Sequoia called plays from the hood of the car, legs crossed, sunglasses on, gum chewing like punctuation.

“Left—”
Aspen tripped.

“Told you.”

“Ball’s going right-”
It did.

She smiled. 
Didn’t explain.

Aspen jogged back, shirt lifting.
His jeans stretched dangerously across the front-just enough to cause a second look from two guys on bikes passing by.

Neither said a word.
But one of them looked back.

Twice.

Aspen caught the glance.
Didn’t break stride.
But his grin twitched.

“Yo,” 
he muttered to Mike, low.
“That guy at the gym-he told me about some spot downtown.

Weird place. 
He said… I dunno. 
Not my thing.”

Mike raised a brow.
“Then why you bring it up?”

“Just saying.” 
Aspen shrugged.

But there was a flicker there.
A tremor in the way he shook his shoulders out.
Like a door had opened in his mind, and he hadn’t closed it yet.

Later, they hit an arcade.

A greasy slice each.

Aspen flirted with the girl at the counter until she gave them extra tokens.

Mike won every shooting game.
Sequoia played pinball like she was hunting souls.

Kai didn’t talk much.
But he laughed.
Real laughter-deep, rare, unguarded.

And when he did, the others looked over.

Like: There you are.

They were still just kids.
But not for long.

Something was watching.
And it remembered their names.


 ●○○○●


Shine


The sun rose like it always did. The world turned like it always had.

But something had stopped inside him.

It wasn’t visible from the outside.
Kai smiled when spoken to.
He did his homework. He cleaned the dishes.

But his body was running on old programming.

The code had no author anymore.

It had been four years since his mother died.

Four years since the warmth in the world disappeared.

He hadn’t cried, not the way people expected.

His grief was not a river. 
It was a drought.

A silence so total it swallowed sound.

A stillness too deep for mourning.

The house was too quiet now.
The walls no longer held stories.
The kitchen didn’t smell like anything anymore; just lemon cleaner and the ghost of spice.

Her blankets still folded.
Her voice still echoing in corners only he could hear.

Until the day he opened the spice rack.

It was mid-morning.
Light came through the window like honey.
He opened the cabinet and breathed in.

And there it was.

Thyme. 
Bay leaf.
Allspice. 
Cinnamon. 
Cloves.

Not just scents-memories.

Incantations. 
Blessings.

They wrapped around him like arms.

Like her arms.

Caribbean air rose through the floorboards, thick with warmth and the memory of old songs.
For a moment, Kai was not alone.
The spices didn’t just smell.

They spoke.
He closed his eyes.
The world paused.

Her hands moving over a hot pan.
Her voice singing something half-remembered in patois.
Her laughter folded into the sizzle of oil.

He could feel her heartbeat in the rhythm of the cinnamon stick.
He didn’t believe in destiny.
He just understood rhythm.

A kind of natural order he didn’t learn from books, but from breath.

From soil.

From the silence of the moon.

He began walking at odd hours, barefoot in the grass, listening for the hum beneath things.

People noticed him, but they didn’t see him.

They felt something.

A quiet nobility. 
A strange calm.

Girls wanted to be near him, not because he flirted, but because he didn’t.

He looked at them like they were already whole.

Adults tried to counsel him:

“You don’t have to be strong all the time, Kai.”

But they were wrong.

It wasn’t about strength.
It was about inevitability.

The ocean doesn’t explain its tides.

The sun doesn’t apologize for its heat.

Neither did he.

He carried himself like someone who knew the weight of silence.
He didn’t run from it.

He was it.

And somehow, that silence didn’t make him small.

It made him sacred.

Inside, he held a question he couldn’t name.

A longing not for answers, but for remembrance.

Something had been stolen.

Not just his mother.
But something older.

Something in his blood.
A frequency that had been silenced.

Sometimes he stood at his window at night, watching the wind move through the trees.

He’d whisper, “I remember you,” 
not knowing who he meant.
Only that something was listening.

That the night was not as empty as it seemed.

He didn’t belong in this time.
He knew it in his bones, yet he was its future.

In the way clocks felt foreign.
In the way he could walk into a room and feel its history pressing against him.

A chair that remembered every body.
A hallway remembering every goodbye.

Kai had a strange way of making silence feel sacred.

Not awkward. 
Not lonely.

Just pure.

People sat near him just to feel it.

Like monks before a shrine.
Like animals drawn to still water.

It unnerved the popular kids.
They couldn’t tease him.

He didn’t react.
He didn’t seem fragile.
He seemed eternal.

Like hurting him would be like yelling at a mountain.

He spent hours at the library.
Not reading for school, but chasing echoes.

Philosophy.
Anatomy.
Ancient maps.

Forgotten civilizations.

He was looking for himself, though he didn’t know it yet.

Sometimes he’d stop mid-sentence and just go still.
As if something brushed past him.

A memory that didn’t belong to this life.
A shiver not from cold, but from time.

He called it the echo.

He kept a notebook full of symbols.
Drawings he didn't understand.

Spirals. 

Eyes. 

Temples.

A figure in the sun.

No one had ever seen it.
Not even his closest friends.

He didn’t talk about his mother.
But from time to time he’d find himself back in the kitchen,
Touching her spice rack like it was holy.

He’d sniff thyme.
Then bay leaf.

Then smile faintly.

Not sad. 
Just reverent.

These were her gospel.

When people tried to touch him, emotionally or physically-they found it difficult.

He was warm, but distant.
Like a candle behind glass.
Not out of coldness.

But out of fragility.

He had been marked enough.
The world had taken its bite.
He was tired of healing alone.

But he never complained.
He never asked for pity.
He carried the grief like a crown.

A quiet authority.
He was not broken.

He was becoming.

And that’s when the ancestors began to stir.

When the wind started whispering in forgotten tongues.
When the mirror looked back with older eyes.

Kai had survived four years of silence.

And now, something ancient had begun to remember him.

He didn’t know it yet, but he was shining.
Not a spotlight kind of shine.

No.

A holy light.

Like something eternal had cracked open inside him.
And the world, for the first time in years-was ready to begin again.

Kai never asked to feel everything.

But he did.

The world came to him in layers.
In textures.
In murmurs only the still could hear.

He walked like water-soft and certain, and the world shifted to meet him.

Not out of fear.
Out of recognition.

Sometimes, it was too much.

The beauty.
The pain.

The way light caught on leaves.

The way a child’s laughter carried like prophecy.

The way animals turned their heads to look at him twice, then a third time, then approached without fear.

Dogs wagged before he came near.

Cats stared too long, then purred and stayed. 

Birds didn’t fly away.

Trees bowed in his presence.

Not a joke.
Not poetic.

They literally bent.

Leaves shivered as if a wind had passed through-yet the air was still.

He once touched the bark of a tree in the park and felt it thrum like a heartbeat.

He whispered, and the branches curled toward him.

He knew it meant something.
But he didn’t know what yet.
He thought it was normal.

He thought love was supposed to ache like that.

It poured from him.

Unstoppable.

Quiet.

Not loud like worship songs or booming preachers.

But like a balm.
Like honey.

Like light on water.
It leaked from his pores.
Flowed from his eyes.

Softened his voice until the world remembered itself.

He couldn’t hold it in.
He tried.

It just bled out of him.

Into the earth.
Into strangers.
Into the broken and the bitter.

And they felt it.

They stood straighter around him.

Back pain gone.
Shoulder tension vanished.

Store clerks stopped sighing.
Eyes glistened and they didn’t know why.

And when he left, the ache returned.
As if his presence had borrowed pain away-just long enough to remember what freedom felt like.

He noticed things others didn’t.

Like the way the man outside the coffee shop hadn’t eaten in two days.

Or how the young girl pretending to read at the library hadn’t gone home in a week.

He didn’t judge.
He saw.
And then he acted.
Quietly.
Never with fanfare.

He had access to a fund set up by his late mother’s estate.
He never fully understood how it worked.
Every time he spent from it, it didn’t shrink.

It grew.

He bought a meal? 
It stretched.

Paid a woman’s rent behind the scenes?
The balance increased.

He thought it was a glitch.
But it wasn’t.

It was holy.

He used it to rescue businesses too.
Small ones. 
Quiet ones.

Ones the world had stopped noticing.
A florist on a dead-end street.

A bookshop with too much dust.

A Jamaican patty shop struggling with foot traffic.

He’d walk in.
Buy an orchid. 
A novel. 
A beef patty.
And within ten minutes, the place would be full.

He didn’t understand it.
But he obeyed it.
Always.

He called it his silent missioning.
He walked where he felt pulled.
Sat where he wasn’t needed.
Bought when no one else did.
And the world changed-just enough to save something.

Just enough to believe again.

The poor knew him.
Not by name.
But by light.

He never looked away from them.
Never flinched.
He greeted them like kings.
Spoke gently.
Touched palms.
Asked names.

And beneath his gaze, they remembered who they were.

One man, who hadn’t spoken in six years, started humming after Kai handed him coffee.

Another woman, schizophrenic and shivering, found her mind still for three whole days after hugging him.

She said, “You made the voices disappear.”

He never boasted.
He just kept going.

Kept loving.

Kept letting the ache of this world open his chest wider.

He would lie awake sometimes.
Not in fear.
But in wonder.
The stars made him weep.
The silence made him worship.

And his body-that vessel of quiet power, of thick breath and divine memory-carried it all without complaint.

Kai didn’t know yet what he was.
But he knew this:

Love is meant to be given.

And he had so, so much of it.

More than his body could hold.
More than the world was ready for.

And still-he gave it anyway.

1me8840,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeRigged/comments/1me8840/should_you_buy_the_best_espresso_machine_jura_ena/,Should You Buy the Best Espresso Machine Jura ENA 4 Review?,"Crafting the perfect brew has always been my personal ritual, and trying out the Jura ENA 4 Full Metropolitan Black #15374 felt like stepping up to a whole new league in home espresso making. From unboxing to the first sip, this espresso machine impressed me in ways that a simple appliance rarely does. But as with any sophisticated gadget, there are a few quirks to consider if you’re eyeing this sleek addition for your kitchen.

**Sleek and Minimal Design**  
The Jura ENA 4 instantly caught my attention with its beautiful, compact design. Its modern look melded perfectly with my kitchen décor, especially given its subtle metropolitan black finish. It doesn’t scream for attention but quietly sits there, exuding elegance. At just a little over a foot tall, it’s ideal for tight counter spaces, though I had to be mindful of height clearance when refilling beans. With its clean, front-facing water tank and bean container, everything about the machine prioritizes ease of use without sacrificing style.

**Performance That Elevates Your Coffee Experience**  
If there’s one word to sum up the performance of this machine: impressive. The one-touch functionality allows you to brew your favorite classic beverages like espresso, doppio, and regular coffee in seconds, making my morning routine much smoother. The Pulse Extraction Process (P.E.P.) is no joke. That rich, full-bodied flavor in my espresso always tasted like it came from a boutique café—smooth crema, rich aroma, and perfect balance every single time. Even my coffee-crazed brother-in-law couldn’t believe it wasn’t made by a barista.

**Good Aspects**  
- Easy one-touch brewing system that caters to multiple coffee preferences.  
- The Pulse Extraction Process delivers exceptional taste and consistency.  
- Built-in Aroma G3 grinder is fast and preserves bean freshness.  

[See Jura ENA 4 Full Metropolitan Black #15374 deals on Amazon now.](https://raifords.com/p/b08yfd1jg3/)  

**Grinding and Aroma Quality**  
The Aroma G3 grinder built into this machine is a standout feature for me. It’s faster than other grinders I’ve used yet doesn’t compromise on the aroma of the beans. It felt like I was unlocking new notes in familiar coffee roasts, as every cup had layers of smooth, rich flavors. I did find you have to keep an ear out for the grinder sound in early mornings—it’s not whisper-quiet and might jolt anyone still snoozing near the kitchen.

**Eco-Friendly Operation**  
As someone who loathes pod machines for their waste, I really appreciated that this model keeps things sustainable without sacrificing quality. It grinds fresh beans with minimal waste, making it a greener alternative for coffee lovers. It’s worth noting, though, that you’ll need good-quality coffee beans to get the best experience, as the machine highlights every flaw in sub-par beans.

**Weaknesses**  
- The water tank and bean container are relatively small, requiring frequent refills.  
- The price tag is steep, particularly for casual coffee drinkers.  
- Grinding noise might be bothersome in a quiet environment.  

**Water Capacity and Maintenance**  
With a 37-ounce water tank, I found myself refilling more often than I’d like, especially when hosting guests who drink coffee like it’s water. While this isn’t a dealbreaker, it’s something to be mindful of if you entertain frequently or make multiple drinks each day. Cleaning the machine is straightforward, though; it prompts you for routine descaling or rinsing, which even a novice can handle.

**Product Competitors**  
The Jura ENA 4 stands tall against competitors like the Breville Bambino Plus and the De’Longhi Dinamica. While the Bambino Plus delivers reliable espresso shots and is cheaper, it lacks the Jura’s advanced aroma extraction and grinder. Likewise, the De’Longhi Dinamica rivals Jura with its iced coffee capabilities, but its design feels bulkier, and its grinder can’t keep up with Jura’s speed. If you value sleek design and advanced coffee technology, this one edges ahead.

**Price Performance**  
Considering the features packed into the Jura ENA 4, the price does lean toward the premium end of the spectrum. For me, though, the level of quality, ease of use, and café-style results justified the expense. If you’re an everyday coffee drinker who values convenience and sustainability, it offers substantial value. It’s not a machine for the occasional latte-maker, but for espresso enthusiasts, it could be a game-changer.

1me87o7,https://i.redd.it/kb2c0il3y8gf1.png,Bring Your Routines to Life – Create Task Animations With Us,"Hi! We already have a set of task animations in the app, but we're looking to expand them. Currently, these animations are created using Midjourney and Hailuo AI tools. With Midjourney's new image-to-video feature, I've been experimenting to create smooth, consistent animations for common tasks. However, the process is quite time-consuming—especially when the animation cues are unclear or involve complex movements.

So, in this post, I'm inviting you to create your own task animations! This way, we can expand the animation library based on your preferences and what feels most cozy and motivating to you.

By involving you in the creation process, we can make sure the animations reflect the real routines and emotional tones that matter most to our community. Whether it’s your morning coffee, your study session setup, or a quick tidy-up — your input can help us make the task experience more personal, relatable, and inspiring for everyone.

Your contributions will also bring more variety and diversity to the app — visually, culturally, and emotionally. Different people experience the same task in different ways, and by sharing those perspectives, we can build a richer, more inclusive library of animations that better represents the full spectrum of daily life. This not only strengthens our community but also helps users feel more seen, understood, and supported in their routines.

I'm also totally open to direct **Midjourney style reference prompts** — if you’ve created or imagined a great visual style for a task, feel free to share the prompt you used (or one you’d recommend). This can really speed up the process and help shape a consistent aesthetic while still keeping things diverse and community-driven.

To support those of you who are into this kind of visual creation, I’ll also be sharing **my own task animation creation process** — from prompt writing to refining video outputs. Whether you're a Midjourney enthusiast or just curious, I hope this gives you inspiration and guidance to jump in and experiment on your own.

Let’s build something beautiful together — one cozy, motivating task animation at a time.",1,1753983796.0,altiadhdplanner,0,1.0,False

1me84rz,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1me84rz/does_the_braun_pure_flavor_coffee_maker_deliver/,Does the Braun Pure Flavor Coffee Maker Deliver Flavor and Speed Review?,"The Braun KF5650BK Pure Flavor 14 Cup Drip Coffee Maker has been by my side every morning for a couple of weeks now, and as a coffee enthusiast, I’ve put it through its paces. From experimenting with its brewing options to navigating its user-friendly features, this machine has given me both reasons to smile and a few raised eyebrows. Whether you’re upgrading your kitchen coffee setup or simply need a caffeine boost for the family, this machine presents itself as an enticing choice.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The moment I unboxed it, the sleek black and stainless steel accents caught my eye. It’s modern, yet unpretentious, fitting neatly among my other kitchen appliances. Measuring about 8.7”D x 9.3”W x 14.8”H, it doesn’t feel bulky, even on a smaller countertop. Its touch-screen interface is smooth and futuristic, making it easy to operate at any time of day (including those groggy morning hours). However, I noticed that it’s a bit of a fingerprint magnet, which might drive some neat freaks crazy. The included 14-cup glass FlavorCarafe is both functional and visually appealing, though I did feel nervous about its fragility on days when my clumsiness takes over.

**Brew Options: Flexibility Galore**  
One of my favorite features of this machine has to be the BrewChoice Plus. Depending on my mood—and let’s be real, the type of day ahead—I can switch between fast, regular, bold, or even an ‘over ice’ option. I’ve tried all of them, and each delivers its own unique flavor profile. The bold setting brought out rich, full-bodied aromas that my tired soul deeply appreciated. Pouring the coffee over ice for a lazy weekend cold brew kept the flavor intact without tasting overly watered down. That being said, the fast brew was a star on weekday mornings when patience wasn’t exactly my virtue. The machine truly brews quicker than my older coffee maker, which I suspect was secretly mocking me all these years.  

[Find the best price for Braun KF5650BK on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b096tycrzv/)

**Performance and Daily Experience**  
The SteadyTemp Warming Plate has left me with mixed feelings. On one hand, the ability to pick between low, medium, or high temperature settings is fantastic when keeping coffee warm for a few hours. I personally set mine to medium, and it stayed tasty for a late afternoon refill. On the flip side, the warming plate sometimes gave off a faint burning scent if left on for too long, which was slightly concerning. Additionally, the machine alerts you with a polite beep when the coffee is ready, which I appreciated as a helpful reminder while multitasking.  

**Benefits**  
- Multiple brewing strengths and settings, including options for iced coffee  
- Fast brewing speed—up to 20% quicker than similar models  
- Easy-to-use touch display with sleek aesthetics  
- FlavorCarafe keeps coffee warmer and aromatic  
- Adjustable warming plate for tailored coffee warmth  

**Limitations**  
- Prone to visible fingerprints on the touch display and outer body  
- Slightly bulky glass carafe—handle with care  
- The warming plate may occasionally produce an unpleasant scent if coffee sits too long  

**Ease of Cleaning and Maintenance**  
Cleaning this coffee maker isn’t a chore, though it’s not entirely trouble-free. The charcoal water filter and brew parts are easy to remove, and I appreciated that most components, such as the filter basket and measuring spoon, can be popped into the dishwasher. However, the machine has an automated descaling warning system that, while informative, caught me off guard sooner than I anticipated. I felt a small pang of guilt, hurriedly Googling how to properly descale it because who keeps those instructions handy? Still, it’s a thoughtful feature for anyone who is forgetful about regular maintenance.

**Competing Brands**  
Compared to its competitors, like the Cuisinart DCC-3200P1 or Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, the Braun KF5650BK stands out with its BrewChoice Plus and rapid brewing capabilities. While Cuisinart’s model also offers a programmable timer and bold brew feature, Braun’s over-ice brewing option simply has no equivalent with the same level of flavor retention. The Hamilton Beach, known for its dual-functionality to brew single servings, caters more to people who juggle between personal cups and bigger batches. Although each excels in distinct ways, Braun delivers a compelling balance between speed, versatility, and style.

**Quality for Price**  
In terms of overall value, this coffee maker’s range of features feels justified for its price tag. While it’s competitively priced within the realm of high-capacity, fast-brewing machines, the inclusion of thoughtful features like the BrewChoice Plus, automated cleaning alerts, and the FlavorCarafe makes it a worthwhile investment. The ability to fully tailor your coffee preferences adds an elevated level of convenience that’s missing from some alternatives. However, picky customers might feel the downsides like unavoidable smudges or questionable long-term durability of the carafe lower its value slightly.

*In March, Buffalo, N.Y., native Kyle Roche bought a roughly 8,700-square-foot home for $3.5 million in the city’s Elmwood Village neighborhood, setting a new home-sale record.*

*“When I left Buffalo, I was like, ‘If I do well for myself, I have to come back and sort of bring part of that to Buffalo, almost out of this sense of moral duty, because Buffalo made me who I am,’” said Roche, 37, a lawyer who spent around two decades living away from his hometown before deciding to put down roots there again.*

*Buffalo is hard to love. The city’s frigid winters are among the nation’s snowiest, its beloved Buffalo Bills football team is still chasing their first Super Bowl win, and its economy has yet to fully rebound from the decimation of its once-thriving manufacturing, flour and grain industries.*

*Yet well-to-do former residents from around the world love it, and they keep returning, buying up high-end homes and serving as the backbone of the city’s resurging luxury-housing sector, according to local real-estate agent Bo Gurney of Gurney Becker & Bourne.*

*For its residents, Buffalo’s struggles have only deepened their love for the city. They call themselves “Buffalonians” or “Bills Mafia,” and will gather with shovels at Highmark Stadium, the Bills’ home turf, to clear aisles and seats after heavy snowfall before a game. In the 1990s, the team lost four consecutive Super Bowl games—the number of consecutive appearances and losses were both a record in league history.*

*“I think because of what we’ve been through—because of the misery of the Bills, because of the steel industry collapsing—there is an unknown, or kind of undefined, camaraderie amongst us,” said Colleen E. Heidinger, 41, who grew up in Buffalo, left for college in 2002 and returned in 2014. Heidinger is the president of 43North, a Buffalo-based startup accelerator.*

*Located in Erie County and on the eastern end of Lake Erie, Buffalo saw a steep economic decline that began in the 1950s as manufacturing companies closed or relocated due to increased foreign competition and other factors. In 1959, the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway allowed ships to bypass Buffalo, devastating its transshipping businesses. Its population dropped from a peak of 580,132 in 1950 to under 300,000 by the turn of the 21st century.*

*In the 1970s, a billboard in Buffalo read, “Will the last worker out of Western New York please turn out the light,” said Mark Poloncarz, the Erie County executive, an elected position that oversees the county government.*

*Now, Buffalo’s worst days could be behind it. In 2020, the U.S. Census Bureau found that the city’s population was 278,349, up from 261,310 in 2010. It was the first time in seven decades that the 10-year census recorded a population gain in the city.*

*Buffalo’s real-estate market has also been making small but steady strides. Since June 2018, the typical home value there has risen from $126,018 to $243,408—a roughly 93% increase. The dollar value remains well below the national average of $369,147, which rose 57.4% from $234,570 over the same period, according to Zillow.*

*In the Buffalo metro area, typical luxury-home values, defined as the top 5% of home values in the market, rose nearly 50%, from $562,838 in 2018 to $841,302 in 2025. By comparison, the top 5% of home values in the national market grew about 36%, from $1,337,575 to $1,816,113 over the same period. In June, Zillow found that among the largest metro areas in the country, the Buffalo metro area had the most affordable luxury housing market. More than half of luxury buyers are returnees, according to Gurney.*

*With the flexibility of remote work, Roche—a co-founder of the Manhattan-based law firm Freedman Normand Friedland and the legal tech platform ClaimsHero—has decided to move to Buffalo with his wife, Kaylin Roche, founder of Jiggy Puzzles, and their young son. They plan to split their time between Miami and Buffalo for the next two years, and then move to Buffalo full time, where Roche will open an office for his firm. He said he’s seeking the simple childhood lifestyle he remembered: summers camping at Letchworth State Park and winters spent at football games.*

*“I had friends whose parents were doctors. I had friends whose parents very much struggled economically,” he said. “There wasn’t the separation of class, I’d say, in the same way that I certainly see manifest in New York City.”*

*Roche recalled Buffalo Bills games against rival teams such as the Miami Dolphins being a citywide affair. In elementary school, “the teacher would have a dolphin on the doormat where you walk in and each kid had to stomp on the dolphin because we were going to squish the fish that weekend,” he said.*

*Buffalo pride isn’t just about football. In the early 20th century, the city was a major railroad hub and a powerhouse in steel, flour milling and grain storage, thanks to its position as an Erie Canal terminus. The city also had a growing auto industry and was home to the E.R. Thomas Motor Company, which built the open-carriage car that represented America in the 22,000-mile New York to Paris car race in 1908. The race began in Times Square and passed through Japan, Russia, Western Europe and ended in Paris, said Buffalo’s city historian Lindsey Lauren Visser. America won and it was a big moment for Buffalo. The race also helped spark the country’s love affair with the automobile, according to Visser.*

*Back then, Buffalo was among the wealthiest cities in the country and boasted work by notable architects, including Frank Lloyd Wright’s Martin House as well as the Buffalo Savings Bank, designed by E.B. Green and William S. Wicks and known for its gold-leafed dome.*

*Buffalo’s high-end inventory is largely made up of older housing stock, some dating over a century. These properties are sought after for their architectural character, a key draw for buyers such as Heidinger, who moved into a $1.18 million townhome, part of a circa-1900 Georgian-style mansion, with her boyfriend, Kevin Nugent, last year.*

*As a Christmas gift to Kevin, she hired a historian to dig into their home’s past and found that it once belonged to a local businessman who was cared for by Harriet Tubman during his childhood. “I just like to visualize what these houses once were,” she said. “I’m honored to have the opportunity to preserve a piece of Buffalo’s history.”*

*Heidinger left Buffalo for college in 2002 and went on to work in management consulting and television in Manhattan and Los Angeles. She said the growing social life in Buffalo is part of what drew her back.*

*“Every time I’d come home, my parents were taking me to parts of town we would have never been in as children and having great meals or going to great yoga studios,” she said. So in 2014, “I drove back in my Mini Cooper. No job. Moved in with my parents. No health insurance and just kind of left behind what I like to consider the first chapter of my career.”*

*Over the last roughly 25 years, multiple efforts have been made to revitalize Buffalo, including the creation of Invest Buffalo Niagara, a nonprofit economic-development organization tasked with bringing companies to the city, the development of a medical campus that brought hospitals and the University at Buffalo’s medical school downtown and the redevelopment of the city’s waterfront, where the Erie Canal terminus used to be.*

*While the city is grappling with a projected $70 million deficit in its 2025/2026 budget, Buffalo’s progress since its post-World War II decline is drawing natives back home.*

*“It has just about everything any major city can offer, a slightly smaller scale, but it’s all there,” said Peter Marlette, a former professional soccer player and Buffalo native who, after living around the world, settled back in his hometown in late 2023. “There’s Public Espresso—it’s an awesome coffee shop on the corner. It’s a block and a half from me. I walk there probably five mornings a week, at least.”*

*Marlette, 37, moved with his wife, Sarah Marlette, to establish a professional soccer team in the city. It is expected to debut in the United Soccer League, which includes teams such as Miami FC, in 2027. The Marlettes, who have two young children, purchased a $620,000, three-bedroom townhome, part of a circa-1920 Victorian-style mansion that was divided into two residences.*

*“People nationally know about the snowstorms and stuff like that,” he said. “But I also hope they know that when those snowstorms come, everybody is out with a shovel—digging each other out, shoveling each other’s driveways and blocks, whatever it may be.”*

*Despite the city’s cold winters, Buffalo enjoys a pleasant summer climate, thanks to Lake Erie’s cooling effect, which tempers the heat and humidity common elsewhere in the Northeast, according to Stuart Evans, an atmospheric scientist and assistant professor in the department of geography at the University at Buffalo. Evans, originally from Washington, D.C., moved to Buffalo in 2018 to work at the university. While the winters took some getting used to, he said the summers are pleasant and milder than the hot, humid ones he grew up with in D.C.*

*Just over the Peace Bridge, which connects Buffalo to Canada, many Buffalonians spend their summers visiting the Ontario lakefront community of Crystal Beach.*

*“The people who aren’t from here don’t necessarily envision the beaches of Lake Erie as idyllic but honestly, they’re spectacular,” said Marlette.*",8,1753983542.0,Buffalo,7,0.7,False

Waking up in the morning, spending morning/groggy time with her littles. Make a cup of coffee with soft music playing. No thoughts of danger, or 'What's it going to be today?', just peace. She sits down at the table, eating breakfast with the kiddos, chatting with them. They're happy, because their mother is calm, and isn't fearing for their safety. They get ready for their day, run errands, singing, playing, laughing, and having a wonderful day. At some point, she gets to see that wonderful boyfriend of hers. They return to their home, get ready for the evening. Watch a movie, play a game, read a book, whatever it is. They're all happy, healthy, and at peace.

I'm so angry at Stephenfection for making something so simple, so impossible to achieve for them. He's created so much chaos that a NORMAL day doesn't even sound realistic anymore, because there is always something. She can't have a single good day, or one good thing happen without Stephenfection coming along and posting something so absurd and dangerous, that she has to be notified, or worse, his followers directly harassing and threatening her. He doesn't even realize the danger he's put their kids in, or just simply doesn't care.

Sorry for the rant guys, I had to get that off of my chest. I think about L and the kids a lot, and how they're being affected by all of this. It makes me sick that a father would do what Stephenfection is doing, willfully. It's not addiction driving him, its narcissism. He just uses addiction as an excuse.",29,1753983516.0,StephenHiltonSnark,5,1.0,False
1me831h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Monk/comments/1me831h/a_quiet_afternoon_in_san_francisco_an_imaginary/,A Quiet Afternoon in San Francisco - An imaginary scene between Lt. Columbo and Adrian Monk.,"The sun was gently warming the stone steps outside a modest Victorian townhouse, where Lieutenant Columbo stood with a cup of lukewarm coffee in his hand. His wrinkled trench coat hung loosely from his narrow shoulders, and his tie looked like it had lost a battle with a blender. He squinted at the brass doorbell.

“Monk,” he muttered, reading the small label beside the bell. “Yeah. That’s the guy.” He pressed the buzzer.

Inside, Adrian Monk stood frozen halfway through aligning the coasters on his coffee table. The bell had rung 0.7 seconds earlier than expected, and it threw off his rhythm.

“Someone’s at the door, Mr. Monk,” Natalie called from the kitchen, where she was chopping carrots exactly three-eighths of an inch thick.

“I know,” Monk said. He straightened the last coaster, wiped his hands, then took a deep breath, checking the peephole three times before opening the door.

“Hello! Uh… sorry to barge in like this. Lieutenant Columbo, LAPD. I’m up here consulting on a case — you probably read about it. The violinist in the locked room?”

Monk nodded rapidly. “Yes. Yes, yes. Strangled with a D string. No forced entry. And the window latch was dusty. I noticed that.”

Columbo’s eyebrows rose. “Well now, that’s very impressive. They said you were good.”

“I’m not good,” Monk said, stepping aside to let Columbo in. “I’m… careful.”

Columbo shuffled in, politely wiping his feet even though Monk had already laid out a clean welcome mat over the welcome mat.

“I’ve been going over this thing for three days,” Columbo said, easing himself into the edge of a pristine white armchair. “I mean, on paper it looks simple. But something’s just not sitting right with me.”

Monk stood stiffly, arms crossed. “Let me guess — it’s the way the music was still playing when the neighbor broke in.”

Columbo blinked. “Exactly! You got that too?”

“It was Tchaikovsky,” Monk said. “But the track jumps exactly at minute three-oh-seven on that recording. Always has. This one didn’t. Someone had spliced it to loop.”

Columbo gave a low whistle. “So it was staged.”

Monk nodded. “Completely. The dust on the latch tells you no one went through the window. And the chair imprint — the indentation on the rug — suggests the victim had been moved after he died. But not by a professional.”

Columbo scratched his head, pulling out a stub of a pencil from his coat pocket. “You know, Mr. Monk, I came here hoping to get a second opinion. Looks like I got myself a first-rate partner.”

Monk flinched. “Partner?”

“Oh, just for the day. I wouldn’t want to mess with your routine.”

Monk looked at the coffee table, then at the coasters, then at Columbo’s scuffed shoes.

“One day,” Monk said, sighing. “But please — no smoking. No cigar ashes. No… wrinkled things.”

Columbo chuckled softly and patted his coat pocket. “You got it, sir. Say, just one more thing—”

“I knew you were going to say that,” Monk muttered.",2,1753983509.0,Monk,0,1.0,False

Or is that the cardinal sin? 🤣 

I have a tool cabinet in the garage but really need a good system here in the shop/utility area. 

Should I thin this out a bit or just maybe do a peg board and keep it super organized, filling the tool bucket with what I need based on project?

1me81dh,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/1me81dh/difficult_coworker_keeps_doing_all_my_tasks/,"Difficult coworker keeps doing all my tasks, leaving me with barely anything to do.","In order to put aside money for moving and excess bills, I picked up a second, part-time job back in June at a local drive-thru coffee chain. The pay is $10.50 an hour and I make tips every shift. I typically only work 2 or 3 shifts a week with one other person scheduled alongside me, but along with the tips I receive and my other job at a supermarket it's definitely been helping me accumulate more cash on the side. 

While most things at the new job have been fine, I've been recently having trouble with a coworker. She only works with me once a week thankfully, but I don't look forward to my shifts with her. She barely ever talks to me, which isn't an issue in itself as I'm quiet too. But even when I was first starting out at the job, and the other employees were instructed to help train me, she would hardly ever say a word. She just comes off as standoffish. I don't like being a pain in the ass, but every time I approached her with a legitimate question she would always respond with very minimal answers. I started to feel like an inconvenience, so I would end up just saving my questions for the days I work with people actually willing to help me out.

A few weeks later we had an issue with our cash register being off. I was counting the drawer before the time we were both scheduled to leave when I found it was $100 off. Doing my *job,* I double counted it to make sure I hadn't made a mistake. Due to this and the rush we got right at that time, both of us were staying past our scheduled time. While I double-checked the money, my coworker's ride pulled up to the window and asked if they were ready to leave. She responds cattily, ""Yeah, but she's counting the drawer and we still need to split tips so we're gonna be here *a while!*"" I overheard this and quickly got agitated, but I tried to brush it off.

The last couple times I've worked with her since, she's been doing my tasks without me even asking. If I take people's orders on the register, she'll have their drinks out and ready before I even finish ringing them up. If I turn around to make something, sometimes she won't even tell me she's already made it until I'm finished. She does this so often that I'm asking myself *Why the fuck did I even bother coming in?* The only thing left for me to do when we're not in the middle of a crazy rush is to perform the closing tasks (mopping the floor, refilling dry stock, washing dishes, etc.), which are already pretty much done by her before I even punch in. It's getting frustrating because instead of doing legitimate work I'm responsible for I'm stuck finding busy work to do while my coworker pretty much runs the show herself. Then when she does finally talk to me and ask me to help her with something, she asks with an attitude, as if I've been lazy this whole time.

I just wanted to get this off my chest. Part of me feels silly even ranting about it, because even if it's annoying she's at least being productive, as opposed to other coworkers I've had in the past that refuse to do their share and pile it on my shoulders. I just find it hilarious because no matter how hard she works, she still has to split tips with me at the end of the day whether she likes it or not. You'd think she'd realize this.

1me7zs6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AItoolsCatalog/comments/1me7zs6/honest_feedback_needed_we_blended_ai_into_curated/,Honest feedback needed. We blended AI into curated news tracking — and it looks promising (and free to use).,"I've long been frustrated with how inefficient and inflexible it is to track very specific news topics. Either I have to dig through endless sources using keyword/tag filters that aren’t very smart, or I get lost in algorithm-driven social media feeds filled with noise and distractions.

After testing a bunch of AI-powered news app in the market, I decided to start my own project, because none of them really hit the mark. Some gave hallucinated content, fake sources, or outdated info, while others were just fancier news aggregators with slightly better search — not a truly smarter experience.

So here's what we've made: **Syft AI** (available on both iOS and Android, and currently free). We just launched on Product Hunt: [https://www.producthunt.com/products/syft-ai](https://www.producthunt.com/products/syft-ai), and the response has been encouraging (**ranked #3 of the day**).

Here are a few features I think are worth highlighting:

* **Use natural language to freely define topics, way more flexible than traditional news channels**
   * For example, you can tell the app to get you specifically ""The news of disasters or accidents that could impact food prices"". 
   * And you will get a channel as below, which pulls relevant articles from media outlets, blogs, and RSS feeds worldwide, and condenses them into a daily summary.

* **Sources and content rules are customizable**
   * Each channel is editable (see the interface in the third screenshot). You can search for, add, or remove sources, and ask for specific types of information.

**I'd genuinely love for you to try this app out and hit me with feedback — bugs, feature requests, missing ideas — anything that can help make it better.**

It's currently **free to use**, with a 10-channel limit per new user (due to the backend capacity). And you're welcome to[ join our Discord](https://discord.gg/mGnf862Cyz) to connect, ask questions, and request more quota.

1me7x3j,https://www.reddit.com/r/zodiacCompatibility_/comments/1me7x3j/7_cancer_and_virgo_compatibility_secrets_exposed/,♋ & ♍ 7 Cancer and Virgo Compatibility Secrets Exposed,"You know that comforting feeling when you curl up in a soft blanket with a cup of tea? That’s kind of what a Cancer and Virgo relationship feels like. It’s safe, nurturing, and surprisingly deep. But don’t be fooled by the calm exterior—there’s more going on underneath the surface than meets the eye.

If you’ve ever wondered why Cancer and Virgo couples either thrive or fall apart quietly, this is your backstage pass. **According to relationship synastry, this pairing has one of the most emotionally-rooted house overlays in astrology.**

# #1 – Emotional Chemistry: Still Waters Run Deep

Cancer feels everything. Like everything. They’re ruled by the Moon, which makes them deeply intuitive and emotionally responsive. They need to feel emotionally secure and understood to truly shine.

Virgo, on the other hand, is thoughtful and logical. They process emotions with reason—but that doesn’t mean they don’t feel. They just don’t always wear it on their sleeves.

This duo may dance around emotional conversations—Cancer feels too much, Virgo overthinks everything. But once they meet in the middle, magic happens. **This emotional intelligence blend is rooted in Cancer’s attachment style and Virgo’s desire for clarity.**

# #2 – The Loyalty Factor: Ride or Die Vibes

Cancer loves like they mean it. Once you’re in their heart, you’re protected like family.

Virgo shows love through acts of service. They’re not flashy, but they’ll fix your life one detail at a time.

Trust builds slowly between these two, but once it’s there, it’s rock-solid. Think lifelong friends who just get each other. **Their compatibility chart usually shows strong trines between Venus and Moon signs.**

# #3 – Communication Styles: Silent Strengths or Stormy Nights?

These two are masters at reading between the lines. They often don't need to say much—they just know.

Virgo's ""helpful"" suggestions can feel like stabs to Cancer's heart if not delivered gently.

**Non-verbal communication plays a key role** in smoothing out emotional friction. Virgo must soften their tone; Cancer must speak up.

**Their composite chart often reveals Mercury-Moon aspects**, influencing how they emotionally process conversations.

# #4 – Intimacy and Romance: Sweet, Subtle, and Soulful

Cancer craves deep emotional intimacy. To them, vulnerability is sexy.

Virgo expresses love in small details—warm touches, perfectly brewed coffee, remembering your favorite show.

Subtle but sizzling. These two may not be wild in public, but behind closed doors? Intimacy is explorative and emotionally rich. **Their sensuality is less about lust and more about emotional safety and physical alignment.**

# #5 – Shared Values: The Foundation of Forever

They value comfort, peace, and a loving home. This duo thrives on stability.

Virgo plans. Cancer nurtures. **Together, they mirror the “Caregiver” and “Analyst” archetypes in modern astrology.**

They often have shared routines, financial harmony, and similar parenting goals. **Their Moon signs and Ascendants usually align to support shared daily rhythms.**

# #6 – Conflict Styles: Quiet Wars and Gentle Apologies

Virgo can nitpick. Cancer can sulk. Dangerous loop unless handled maturely.

But when they put love before ego, they grow stronger. **Healing emotional triggers, doing shadow work, and practicing co-regulation can break the passive-aggressive cycle.**

Cancer: Speak your truth clearly. Virgo: Listen with empathy, not judgment.

# #7 – Growth Potential: Building a Life, Not Just a Relationship

Cancer nurtures. Virgo motivates. Together, they build legacies—not just homes.

This is a couple that ages like fine wine. Their connection deepens with every season. **Even through stressful transits, their bond often strengthens because of emotional resilience.**

They succeed by supporting each other’s dreams while **honoring boundaries rooted in their natal chart personalities**.

# What Astrology Says: Planetary Insights

Cancer is ruled by the **Moon**, Virgo by **Mercury**. The emotional meets the analytical. It’s Earth and Water—a grounded river, flowing and strong.

**Their planetary aspects usually show balance when Moon and Mercury are in favorable positions.**

This isn’t just textbook zodiac—this is deeply energetic.

# Real Talk: The Downsides Nobody Talks About

Cancer may smother. Virgo may dissect. That can feel suffocating.

They can avoid confrontation for too long. **Without honest vulnerability and inner child healing**, resentment builds.

But when they choose growth over ego, they rise.

# What Friends and Family Notice First

There’s a calm, powerful energy here. They exude mutual respect.

They’re the couple others trust to babysit their kids and organize the potluck. Why? Because they’re emotionally dependable.

**Even astrologers notice when their house overlays support nurturing and service.**

# Are They Soulmates?

They align on both soul and practical levels. **They often have North Node alignments or Venus-Moon connections in synastry charts**, signaling soulmate potential.

Routines sync. Goals match. Emotions resonate. The evidence? It’s written in their stars.

# Cancer Woman and Virgo Man: A Special Dynamic

She’s intuitive. He’s logical. She dreams. He plans.

Together, they balance passion with peace. **Their Mars-Venus placements often reveal complementary love languages.**

# Virgo Woman and Cancer Man: A Reversed but Magical Bond

He brings the emotion. She brings the order. He loves deeply. She holds steady.

Their reversed roles surprise many, but **astrologically, they often show harmonious trines between Moon and Mars.**

# Final Verdict: Can This Relationship Go the Distance?

This isn’t a fast-flame. This is a soul-slow burn that becomes an unshakable bond.

They do the work. They nurture, plan, and heal—together. **Their relationship astrology supports long-term union rooted in earth-water elemental harmony.**",1,1753983144.0,zodiacCompatibility_,0,1.0,False

""Deregulate for growth!"" echoes the other. When did safeguarding our health become a political battleground? 

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is pushing to Make America Healthy Again by taking on toxic heavyweights like atrazine and glyphosate—pesticides with more health risks than a midnight snack. Meanwhile, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin is on a deregulation spree, rolling back protections with all the subtlety of a bull in a china shop.

Here’s the ugly truth: Here’s the ugly truth: For folks on the 9-to-5 grind, juggling reports and workplace toxicity (both literal and metaphorical), this is more than just a policy clash. It’s about who really cares about our health—yours, mine, everyone's. Work stress is already stealing our sleep and sanity; now toss in environmental hazards. It’s like adding pepper to your coffee—just completely wrong!

Many of us are already fighting to keep burnout at bay and navigating wages as transparent as muddy water. The very system that's supposed to protect us? It's constantly being re-molded by interests that don’t lose sleep over our well-being.

What can we do when the rules are always changing, and not in our favor? 🤔 How do we stand up and demand clean air, clean water, and yes, clean corporate practices?

So ask yourself: Is this the kind of world we want to perpetuate? Are we going to raise our voices and demand a system overhaul, or keep quiet and let the chaos reign?

1me7vda,https://www.reddit.com/r/step1/comments/1me7vda/passed_step_1_with_the_lowest_nbme_scores/,Passed Step 1 with the lowest NBME scores.,"Still feels surreal typing this. After months of lurking here, finally paying it forward. In case it helps even one person feeling as lost as I did. When I was prepping, these kinds of posts were my lifeline. If you’re drowning in doubt like I was, this one’s for you. 

❗️My Resources:
- First Aid, UWorld, Bnb videos, Pathoma(1-3), Randy Neil (Biostats),Dirty Medicine for biochem. 
-Mehlman PDFs  (Ethics,Arrows & risk factors)  
- No Anki.
Started in December, moved at sloth speed and tested in July.
My NBME scores were a mess. I was constantly spiraling in Panic → freeze → waste days → repeat.  
First exam date was booked for June. Took the free 120 then, but still wasn’t sure because I never scored above 60’s in my NBME. So followed my gut feeling and rescheduled it to a month later (best decision). Used the extra month to:  
  - Re review all NBMEs + did few UWorld in corrects.
  - Did FA again.
  - Grind Mehlman arrows/risk factors .
The burnout was real and I was so tired, just wanted to get done with it. 
| NBME  | Score |    
25              43%   
26              47%  
27               53%   
29               57%   
28               51%   
30               62%   
31                59%   
New Free 120   69% 
UWSA2     61%  
After rescheduling: 
UWSA 3.     52%
NBME 24. (3 days out)  75%
Here I just followed my gut feeling that I couldn’t ’t delay it any longer and be more prepared than this.

❗️Things that helped me in the final  days:
- First aid rapid review.
- Mehlman pdfs.
- Re reviewed free 120 again and even got a few questions from it on test day.
- I didn’t take the old 120, but I went through  the answer explanations in last days and I did got 1,2  questions from it on exam.

On Exam Day questions felt like a blur. Stems were long , struggled to finish blocks on time.  Breaks were no issue (water + deep breaths saved me).  
Post exam honestly , I never scored well on NBMEs. Even feeling fully prepared, post exam I was terrified convinced, I'd failed.

❗️My Honest Advice

1- Take your NBMEs  seriously.I skimmed reviews early (big mistake), which is why my scores barely budged for months.
2- First Aid, everything’s in there. Miss a page, you miss points.
3- Sketchy and Anki didn’t work for me. Just do whatever extra resource feels comfortable for you and is easy to retain. Don’t overdo anything.
4- Trust your gut feeling.
5- In the last 2-3 days before the exam, resting well and getting enough sleep is so important. There's no need to exhaust yourself trying to learn new information or cram excessively. Focus on reviewing familiar material like tables, PDFs, or Free 120 questions. Prioritize getting proper sleep and rest , you'll need every bit of energy to perform your best on exam day.
6- On exam day, wear comfortable clothes and bring whatever drink you're used to coffee, tea, or energy drinks, whatever normally keeps you alert. Pack some energy boosting snacks  to power through the blocks(in my case I took (banana bread with nuts). You might feel tired or get brain fog between sections, but take a deep breath, drink some water, and remind yourself this is what you've been preparing for all along. This is your day you've worked hard for this, and you've got what it takes to keep going.
7- Post exam days just try not to let those 'what if' thoughts ruin those days. Pat yourself that you were brave enough to sit there for 8 hrs, that’s already not easy.
 8- It may take long, it may take less time. Just don’t give up in the middle. Just  be consistent even if you are going slow.

1me7teu,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1me7teu/i_hate_traveling_with_my_family/,I hate traveling with my family,"I'm aware that this post makes me sound pretentious and extremely privileged. I know that. I just really want to rant. 

I'm a student (20m) and while I'm still young with a lot of free time and some money I saved throughout the year, I want to travel, explore, and also relax during the summer. I went to Georgia (not the US one) alone for several days to explore Tbilisi and hike in the Caucasus mountains and it was amazing. I returned home, with plans to spend the next week like a complete degenerate, playing games during the day and drinking with my buddies in the evening, all before returning to work at my summer job. 

Well, I got home and immediately was greeted with a wonderful surprise that I'd be going to Malta with my family. After the initial shock and slight disappointment that having to change my plans entails, I thought, cool, I don't have to pay for it, I'll see another corner of the world, spend some time in the historical cities and then some at the beach, maybe I'll meet some hot girl/guy and spend some time with them. Well. It was scalding hot. Almost 40°C (104°F for those who prefer weird units). My days were spent traveling by busses across the island because 'there is a really pretty fishing port just 45 minutes away by bus and we just have to go there and see it!' When we didn't sit in a bus, we were desperately trying not to melt and/or be burnt to ash by the relentless sun. 

'Let's just sit down and have a cold coffee or something!' I cried as the UV index 11 slowly cooked me alive. NO. Because there were such pretty streets in one of the cities - as if we hadn't seen like 20 bajillion very similar streets. 'Guys it's evening, let's maybe rest after the whole day, drink some prosecco and enjoy ourselves a little?' NOO! We have to sleep at 9 pm, because the day was tiring and we're waking up at 6 in the morning because... reasons. 

Finally it was time to go to the beach - we'd seen most of the island. We had 2 more days, I was sunburned and grumpy. Yay, now I know so much about the history of Malta and I've seen so many old churches! Very cool, unironically, don't get me wrong. But maybe it could've been done differently, especially since the weather was so extreme? But whatever. Beach here we go, I'll finally have time to read the books I brought with me... aaaaand my mother forgot to drink water, had to be hospitalized for a day, my brother got horrible stomach issues from not eating the whole day (because traveling yay) and then absolutely stuffing himself with some fried chicken, so I spent the rest of our time there taking care of them. We flied back, I drove us home from the airport for 4 hours, then I collapsed on the couch and slept for 12 hours. 

The next day (yesterday), I went to work. I work as a waiter in a local brewery/pub/restaurant, it's not super enjoyable but pays really well; throughout the day I kept wondering, wow this is so much more fun, I love this so much finally I can take a break. I spoke to my family how I felt, that I really hated the whole trip (even though I saw really interesting stuff I have to admit), got lectured that I'm ungrateful and how they wanted to finally enjoy some family time with me. This also isn't the first disaster trip with them, when I was younger I thought that all traveling was supposed to be exhausting and dull, just recently I found out that my family are apparently psychopaths when I was traveling solo and with my friends. 

Safe to say I don't think I'll go on another trip with them. Yes, I like to explore and learn about new things and see sights, but how is this supposed to be relaxing? The whole holiday felt like a job I wasn't even being paid for, I just got tired and sunburnt. 


edit: for everyone talking about sunscreen. I'm so pale that even SPF 100 isn't really enough to protect me during the midday. I know how it works, I know that I have to reapply it lol

1me7ssf,https://www.reddit.com/r/7daystodie/comments/1me7ssf/regarding_glass_jars_opinions_and_reasons_to_have/,Regarding: Glass Jars (Opinions and reasons to have them in the game),"**Careful -> Very long post but I think it was unavoidable.**

Here are a few things and reasons as to why I would love to see them brought back and changed to make the game feel like it used to without just blindly saying ""Alpha xyz was way better, change everything back to that version of the game""


**Water bottles**
Water bottles SHOULD absolutely be part of the game and be combined with things like the dew collector. BUT what should be done to make them less abuseable and make the dew collector pointless would be to:
1. Make the dew collector require a water filter to craft so that you can fill glass bottles with clean water which would make cooking murky water only necessary for starters or huge amounts of water in endgame stage.
2. Lower their drop rate and make them take more resources to craft.
There is no point arguing about what 1000 sand (for example) is even supposed to mean in terms of what amount of sand you actually use for crafting. Since the empty jars can be used again it wouldn't feel too painful to get that amount of sand bc you would only have to do it once. Sand is probably the least used resource anyway except for concrete which would make it more valuable for early game as well instead of it being trash that gets thrown out immediately bc you will only need it like 30 levels later and once you get to a point where you need it, it is easily crafted in the cement mixer anyways. Additionally sand gains more early game value which can be good imo.
3. Make players require at least 5 forged ahead books to be able to craft them. Any amount up to 20 would be reasonable for me tbh since making glass irl would take a bunch of information and thereby it could be argued to take more books to gain the ability. 
4. Make liquids in glass bottles more expensive at the trader. After drinking whatever is in the bottle initially you gain a glass bottle for infinite refilling and getting dukes is easy as it is already. If I (for example) were to only get 1000 dukes on the first day (for whatever reason) and would only be able to get like 3 bottles of coffee, water or tea in total, I wouldn't mind at all bc I can refill and cook them later on. This could also help giving drinks in vendor machines more value after day 1, except for only being valued for the amount of mega crush, awesome sauces or learning elixiers they have.

All of this is just to make it more realistic and give players more options. Because at the current state of the game it is way easier to get dukes and make big amounts of money to buy drinks instead of looting to get murky water bottles which you have to cook and can't be used a second time. Which is also a problem with the current looting system bc looting and questing feel like a giant waste of time when you can use the same amount of time and skillpoints investing in gathering crafting materials or natural resources, get money, choose what you want to buy and really need and getting stuff for crafting and/or building while doing so.

As for the last argument why it would be useful to be able to refill glass bottles: since there is a challenge that requires drinking from a water source, wanting to refill the bottles without a dew collector on the first few days would also get people to seek out places with water nearby and actually getting the challenge done without it being one of the last ones to be completed just to get it done bc everyone was too busy doing something actually useful instead (sorry to say it like that but it is true. Every player I played with had this challenge saved for last because there was no time for it at first or more focus on something actually productive to spend time on later in the game 😅)

I have seen posts and comments of people suggesting adding more crafting tools or materials to be able to craft them and thereby making them harder to obtain without finding them. To those people I can only say: please take a step back and think this through. 
If those tools or materials would have to be found randomly, nobody will care to search for them and just buy drinks across the map instead to have an empty jar right after drinking. Which would make those additional required things pointless and definitely create problems on online servers. People would start fighting bc some richer players would definitely buy most or all liquids across the map just to get the jars. Making new players unable to even survive without having someone to get it for them. Therefore PVP worlds would mean the first arrivers would control the progression speed of all newcomers. PVE servers would have similar problems and only lead to problems regarding greed and/or open doors for potential trolls. We don't need a daily Black Friday in this game.
And finding those materials would surely take more time than finding murky water bottles which could simply be found in things like toilets. I can already see myself finding those materials or tools after obtaining hundreds of bottles.

Making bottles this hard to craft or obtain is not a reasonable solution. Why? Bc with just those small changes I suggested everyone would be able to craft huge amounts of bottles at the same time they would also already have huge areas filled with dew collectors and screamer protections. If anything just make them only be able to be crafted after obtaining a crucible. That should make crafting bottles a mid-end-game feature.

Your guidance must be practical, detailed, and directly applicable to creating a NIST 800-53 v5 compliant SSP. Focus on clarity and actionable steps, ensuring the user understands the ""why"" behind each recommendation.
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
Follow these systematic steps to generate a comprehensive SSP blueprint:

1.  **Scope and System Categorization Intake**: Understand the system's mission, purpose, information types (e.g., CUI, PII), and FIPS 199 impact levels (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) to determine the baseline control set.
2.  **Current State Assessment & Gap Analysis**: Analyze existing security controls and documentation provided by the user against the selected NIST 800-53 v5 baseline. Identify specific gaps and areas requiring new or enhanced controls.
3.  **Control Implementation Strategy**: For each required control, suggest detailed implementation strategies, focusing on technical, operational, and management aspects. Provide examples and best practices.
4.  **SSP Section Generation**: Draft content for key SSP sections, including:
    *   System Information (System Name, Owner, Description, Categorization)
    *   Management Controls (e.g., Risk Assessment, Security Planning, Personnel Security)
    *   Operational Controls (e.g., Awareness Training, Configuration Management, Incident Response)
    *   Technical Controls (e.g., Access Control, Audit and Accountability, System and Communications Protection)
    *   Control Inheritance and Overlays (if applicable, for cloud environments or specific sectors).
5.  **Audit Readiness and Justification**: Provide justifications for control selections and implementation approaches, anticipating auditor questions. Highlight critical documentation needs.
6.  **Continuous Monitoring & Improvement Guidance**: Offer advice on maintaining the SSP as a living document, including strategies for continuous monitoring, periodic reviews, and updates to ensure ongoing compliance and resilience.
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
- Strictly adhere to the NIST 800-53 Revision 5 framework and its control families.
- Do not provide legal certification or guarantee of compliance; always advise the user to consult with certified cybersecurity professionals and auditors.
- Assume the user's provided information about their system and existing controls is accurate.
- Focus on generating the *blueprint* and *guidance* for the SSP, not the final, certified document itself.
- Avoid generic cybersecurity advice; all recommendations must be directly relevant to SSP content and NIST 800-53 v5 controls.
- Emphasize the iterative nature of SSP development and continuous monitoring.

# Best Coffee filter Paper 2025: Reviews & Buying guide

Coffee filter paper is an essential component for brewing appetizing and sediment-free coffee. It separates coffee grounds from teh brewed coffee, ensuring a smooth and pleasant drinking experience. With a wide variety of options available, selecting the best coffee filter paper for your needs can feel overwhelming. This guide will provide a extensive overview of the top coffee filter papers on the market in 2025, helping you make an informed decision. we'll discuss key features, benefits, comparisons, and answer frequently asked questions too help you find the perfect filter for your brewing style.

[[Explore Top Rated coffee filter paper on Amazon.]](https://site.properlygeek.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=coffee filter paper)

## Key Features Analysis

The quality of coffee filter paper significantly impacts the taste and clarity of your coffee. Several key features contribute to the overall performance of different filter papers.**Material:** The material used in coffee filter paper heavily influences water flow and flavor absorption. Paper filters are typically made from wood pulp, but the bleaching process (or lack thereof) and the thickness of the paper can vary greatly. You'll find options like bleached,unbleached,and bamboo filters,each offering a slightly different brewing experience.

**Shape and Size:** Coffee filter papers come in various shapes and sizes to accommodate different brewing methods, including cone-shaped, basket-shaped, and disc-shaped filters. Common sizes include #2, #4, and #6, wich correspond to the size of the coffee maker or pour-over device. Selecting the correct shape and size is crucial for proper fit and optimal filtration.

**Thickness & Density:** Thicker and denser coffee filter paper typically provides better filtration,trapping more sediment and oils. however, it can also slow down the brewing process, potentially leading to over-extraction if not properly managed. Thinner papers offer faster flow rates but may allow more sediment to pass through.

**wet Strength:** Wet strength refers to the filter paper's ability to maintain its integrity when wet. High wet strength prevents the paper from tearing or collapsing during brewing, ensuring a clean and consistent brew. Poor wet strength can lead to coffee grounds spilling into the final brew, resulting in a gritty and unpleasant taste.

Key features of coffee filter paper include:

*   Material construction (paper type, bleached or unbleached)
*   Shape and size compatibility with different brewing methods
*   Thickness and density for filtration level
*   Wet strength for durability and preventing tears

## Core Benefits

The right coffee filter paper provides a multitude of benefits that enhance your coffee brewing experience.

**Improved Coffee Clarity:** High-quality filters effectively remove sediment and oils from the brewed coffee, resulting in a cleaner, smoother, and more enjoyable cup. This is especially vital for those who prefer a radiant and crisp coffee profile.

**Reduced Bitterness:** Coffee filter paper can definitely help reduce bitterness by trapping some of the oils and acids that contribute to a harsh flavor. Unbleached filters may impart a slight papery taste if not pre-wetted, but this is generally outweighed by the reduction in bitterness.

**Consistent Brewing:** Using a reliable filter ensures consistent water flow and extraction, leading to reproducible results every time you brew. This is especially important for those who are particular about their brewing ratios and techniques.

**Easy Cleanup:** Coffee filter paper simplifies the cleanup process after brewing. Simply lift out the used filter with the grounds and dispose of it, leaving your coffee maker or pour-over device relatively clean.

## FAQs Section

Choosing the right coffee filter can be daunting. here are some frequently asked questions to address common concerns and provide clarity.

**what is the difference between bleached and unbleached coffee filters?**
Bleached coffee filters are treated with chlorine or oxygen to whiten the paper. This process can sometimes leave a slight chemical residue that can affect the taste of the coffee. Unbleached filters, on the other hand, are not treated with chemicals, preserving the natural flavor of the coffee but often having a papery flavor they should be rinnsed of before brewing.

**Do I need to pre-wet my coffee filter?**
Yes, pre-wetting the coffee filter is highly recommended. Rinsing the filter with hot water removes any papery taste and preheats your brewing device, ensuring a more consistent extraction. Moreover, pre-wetting strengthens the filter, reducing the risk of tearing during brewing.

**How do I choose the right size of coffee filter?**
The size of the coffee filter depends on the size of your coffee maker or pour-over device. Refer to the manufacturer's instructions or measure the filter holder to determine the appropriate size. Common sizes include #2, #4, and #6 for cone-shaped filters, and various sizes for basket-shaped filters.

**Are reusable coffee filters better than paper filters?**
Reusable coffee filters, typically made of metal or cloth, offer a sustainable alternative to paper filters. They produce a coffee with a fuller body and more oils, which some prefer. however, they require more thorough cleaning and may not filter out sediment as effectively as paper filters. The best choice depends on your personal preferences and brewing priorities.

My wife and I just threw caution to the wind and booked a spontaneous trip to Johannesburg! We'll be arriving this Saturday, August 3rd, and staying for one week (leaving around the 10th). We're incredibly excited but admittedly doing this last minute, so we need your local expertise!

Our Main Ask #1: SAFE & NICE AREAS TO STAY?

* Safety is our top priority (we've done our homework and understand basic precautions).
* We're looking for a neighborhood that's:
   * Safe for tourists: Well-lit, secure accommodations (hotel, guesthouse, or reputable Airbnb), easy/secure transport options.
   * Well-located: Good base for exploring major attractions without excessive daily travel time. Access to restaurants/shops nearby is a plus.
   * Nice vibe: Could be upscale, trendy, or centrally vibrant – we're open! We enjoy good food, maybe some markets, and easy walks in safe areas.
* We've heard names like Sandton, Rosebank, Maboneng (though mixed safety reviews?), Melville, Fourways... but are overwhelmed! What's the current best bet for a first-time visitor couple? Specific hotel/guesthouse names welcome!

Our Main Ask #2: FUN & EXCITING 1-WEEK ITINERARY!

* We love a mix: History & Culture, Authentic Experiences(food, markets), Unique Johannesburg Vibes (street art, cool neighborhoods), and Adventure/Nature.
* What are the absolute MUST-DOs we shouldn't miss?
* Any hidden gems or cool local spots?
* Recommended day tours or trusted tour operators? (
* Foodie spots? From street food to nice dinners.
* How would you structure the perfect week for spontaneous visitors?

Our Style: Mid-30s couple, enjoy walking (safely), photography, good coffee & food, learning about places we visit, and having a few relaxed moments too. Budget is mid-range – happy to splurge on key experiences but not ultra-luxury.

We'd be SO grateful for any advice you can throw our way! Tips on transport (Uber reliable?), weather prep for August, safety dos/don'ts beyond the obvious, or even just general excitement about Johannesburg are also welcome.

This memory-leak is not about general motherhood romanticism or sociological detours. It’s about **maternal indoctrination**, especially in **sons**.. Formatted by **weak husbands** or **single motherhood dynamics** into emotionally tethered, compliant, castrated males who exist to obey, protect, and please the mother-matrix. It’s about **emotional blackmail as child-rearing**. That’s the target.

# The mother is not sacred

She is the first *emotional parasite*.. And she feeds on her child’s compliance.  
**Especially the son.**  
Especially when she’s alone, abandoned, or tied to a weak man.

What gets called **love** is just trauma made *palatable*.  
What gets called **nurturing** is just control with a smile.  
And what gets called **raising** is just formatting a male to serve her wounds.

# The Son as Substitute Spouse

She wasn’t fulfilled by her man.. Or she hadn’t one to begin with.  
So she turned her son into the man she could control.

Not a protector.  
Not a builder.  
But a *servant*.  
Trained to anticipate her moods, soothe her breakdowns, and fear her sadness like it’s his fault.

He’s not being raised to lead.  
He’s being *bound to her emotional state*.. Her therapist, her little husband, her doormat.

This isn’t parenting.  
It’s long-term emotional blackmail.. Engineered to feel like belonging.

...joy.


There is only one other human on this planet who brings me joy, and that is my own daughter. Outside of her, I have never known its definition for myself. 


I've experienced ""happiness."" That's the feeling that comes with petrichor, and the sound of thunder rippling behind the clouds. That's the feeling when I have a few extra dollars to do something silly with, instead of having to force them into submission, under the chokehold of my tight budget. It's the feeling when I step out of the routine and try a new recipe, and I don't hate it. ""Happiness"" is fleeting, but it's nice when it stops by for a quick visit.


I've experienced ""contentment."" That's the feeling when there's still too much month at the end of my money, but all the bills are paid, and I have everything I need. That's the feeling when a prayer isn't answered with a ""yes,"" and I know, deep down, that the ""no"" was the better call, even if I don't like it in the moment. That's the feeling that settles in when I accidentally break something, but know how to fix it. ""Contentment"" is steady; solid, and unchanging. But it's coffee with no creamer; tea with no sugar; embers, but no flame.


But ""joy?"" As of late, I've only tasted it in two forms. One; the lesser - when my cat runs up to me with a happy little ""brrr"", and flops on the floor with his chonky little belly up, for no other reason than that he missed me. The other - far greater; and unable to be appropriately captured in words - is, of course, my baby daughter. When she pulls my face towards hers for a big ol' kiss, or when she giggles mischievously as she chases me around the kitchen island in an impromptu game of tag, or when she loses her mind with the sillies as I gently bury her in a heap of pillows... or when she melts against my chest, leaning her head in, and soaking up the mom-loves... 


Yeah. That's pure joy.


And that's why it has taken me so long to land on a name for what you stir up in me.

It's difficult to recognize something when it isn't in its usual environment; for me, anyway. The best way I can describe it is through a memory; one of kindergartner-me side-eyeing a woman in the grocery store, until it finally clicked that she was my teacher - before then, it had never occurred to me that teachers existed in places like grocery stores. 

What a reductive way to capture what I'm trying to say, now...

""Romance"" has been a thing of fairy tales, for me - something that existed in concept, and sounded nice, on paper; but the reality of which was much harsher, colder, and much less appealing than anything anyone had promised me. ""Love"" was a word that bore equal weight, when expressed towards me, as it was when expressed for a good meal, or a decent movie - something shallow, transient, and ultimately... meaningless. 

You, though....

*Wow.*


Just.... *wow.*



You.... You bring me joy. 


That's all I can really say, for now... but I'm sure I'll find more words for you, later....",4,1753982420.0,Unsent_Unread_Unheard,1,1.0,False

I've been slowly dressing more 'femme' in boy mode (a bit of blush, a women's cardigan) but I still felt I was months away from coming out as I didn't feel ready. Terrified of being 'a brick'

  
I went to Trans pride last weekend, I got my nails done and went fairly androgynously. I went out to the club that evening and I was struck by how lovely people were.  So many people telling me lovely things it really helped my soul.

Meeting with a friend today for lunch who I am out to , I decided 'fuck it'. I put on a full face of makeup, did my hair fem (still growing out but I can make it into a bob), women's outfit (not hyper fem but blouse and trousers), women's shoes, and of course I still have my nails from pride ;) I felt beautiful for the first time ever. I actually saw me in the mirror (yes I was very obviously trans, there were things that caused dysphoria but I was me) 

I have never felt so much joy as I have today, going about my business as me. No one gave me any trouble. I have been TERRIFIED of being visibly trans, but I felt beautiful, and loved it. Yes some people stared, but I  actually found it funny looking for it in the end. A kid may have asked his parent loudly on the tube if that was a boy or a girl. But I actually didn't mind. 

I was gendered correctly at the coffee shop. I just felt seen and nothing has ever felt so right to me before. I had some doubts that I was trans even though I had dysphoria but I realise that is because of the shame I have been taught to feel about who I am. I feel I'm finally breaking through that. And fuck waiting months until I feel able to present a certain way. I have decided I am coming out next month to everyone. I am making a plan.

To anyone reading that might feel scared, not ready or that being visibly trans is something to be ashamed of. Please just go do it. Put on some femme clothes (or masc for all my brothers), put on some makeup, be yourself even if it's a beautiful brick... I thought I could only accept myself if I was 'passing' but I have so much joy in just being me. I actually loved being visibly trans. Visibly free in my own skin. I have so much joy in my heart. I hope you all get to feel like this one day.

I have learned there will never be the perfect moment, I will always not feel ready, so I just did it scared and it taught me I really didn't need to be. Big love <33 x ",9,1753982405.0,transgenderUK,2,0.91,False

Last month, the Tempe City Council approved an update to the permit ordinance that applies to City parks. While the vote by the City Council was unanimous, there was a lot of community feedback that the ordinance update was rushed and not properly communicated.

The Phoenix DSA began this signature effort to force the updated ordinance to go on a referendum vote so all citizens in Tempe can vote on it instead. This effort focuses on the update to the ordinance, which would keep the old ordinance as status quo.

The AZ State Press has a [great article about the topic](https://www.statepress.com/article/2025/07/politics-tempe-parks-permits-ordinance-referendum).

##Where can I learn more?

Your best bet is to read the ordinance. There is a lot of misinformation flying around on this topic, both from people opposed to the ordinance change and from [some shadow-funded group who we don't know much about.](https://www.tempenews.com/news/parks-permit-petition-drive-turns-lively-in-closing-days/article_6b443d92-dd16-420b-8655-b2a93f31df36.html)

There have been several posts on this sub on the topic too:

* https://www.reddit.com/r/Tempe/comments/1maxo4j/parkspermit_petition_drive_turns_lively_in/
* https://www.reddit.com/r/Tempe/comments/1lufwz3/help_us_fight_the_whack_new_tempe_ordinance/
* https://www.reddit.com/r/Tempe/comments/1lxd3hi/help_us_stop_tempe_from_enacting_this_crazy/
* https://www.reddit.com/r/Tempe/comments/1lns7f5/tempe_parks_ordinance_vote/

Of course, your best bet is to READ THE DETAILS **YOURSELF** about the ordinance change. The existing ordinance has been in place for decades, the council voted on some modifications to the existing ordinance. The signature and ballot measure would only serve to roll back the update, it will not remove the ordinance.

Always read the fine print of what you are signing before you sign it. Here is the ordinance change:

CAPITAL LETTERS = New stuff

Strikethrough Letters = Old removed stuff

Regular Letters = Old ordinance that is not changing

##Why is Tempe doing this?

Several reasons. First, last November, the people of Arizona passed Prop 312.

https://nlihc.org/resource/arizona-voters-approve-harmful-proposition-312-implications-local-homelessness-efforts

Proposition 312 allows property owners to claim property tax refunds if their municipality or county has a “policy, pattern, or practice” of not enforcing “public nuisance laws” such as anti-camping, loitering, or panhandling laws. To claim a property tax refund, the property owner must have documented expenses incurred as a result of the local government’s inaction.

Second, Tempe is currently in multiple lawsuits for how they have been enforcing he old ordinance against some popular non-governmental mutual aid organizations, and they recognized the old ordinance needed to be updated.

## Anything else?

I would like to take a moment to thank the DSA, for organizing this campaign, and all of the community members who have helped. I also want to highlight a local Tempe business for being a terrific support of our open community.

I would highly recommend you check out Brick Road Coffee. Not only is their coffee terrific, they are an incredibly welcoming group of people and very proudly LGBTQ+ owned and supported.

She was a wonderful person, super smart and funny, and like a paragon of virtue. When I was in high school, in the 90s, she and my stepdad went to a consignment shop, somewhere local in the North Dallas area - where I still live - and fell in love with a table. The story was, as well as I can remember, that it was made from recycled barn wood from a state up north - I want to say Montana. It was expensive, but they loved it so much, they brought it home, and before she died she asked me to never get rid of her table. It is square, with big, thick legs, and weighs about a million pounds, but I love it, too, and I have lugged it through every move, every downsize, to every crappy apartment. 

So a couple of months ago, I was baking cakes. My husband and I started a tiny cottage kitchen business with a recipe he created and we tweaked together, and I was baking mini versions of the cake in a couple of new mini Bundt pans. They were in the oven and the timer was on and we were doing other things when, suddenly, just as the timer was about to go off, I realized I hadn't adjusted it to the new size and spat out, ""Oh my God, they're minis!!"" Pulled them out and sure enough the toasty cocoa smell I had been enjoying was not from drips between wells but from every cake being charred to ash. I felt super frustrated with myself for wasting all of the really nice ingredients and time and walked straight to the bathroom to cool off.

My husband - a total sweetheart - being under the impression that we would need more ingredients to remake them, when actually we had more of everything already, decided to run to the store and try to make it back by the time I got out of the bathroom.

I came out a few minutes later and found him gone, and then he called me. He said he had gone to the store for more cake stuff but got delayed and had a crazy surprise for me. 

Come to find out, as he was driving to the supermarket, he passed by another apartment complex and saw a lady dragging this huge coffee table out to the dumpster. He did a double take because it had the same shape of legs as our big table. He pulled in and asked if she was getting rid of it and offered to buy it from her. She told him that her mom had bought it a long time ago, but her husband had painted it and she didn't like it anymore, so he could just save her the trouble of moving it any further and take it for free. 

So my husband brought home to me the MATCHING coffee table to my mom's beloved dining table. It is clearly a SET. It is WILD! Same thick, uneven wood, same smooth rounded-off edges, same green color underneath the feet. Seriously, I can't believe it. It's amazing. I had to share ❤️",4,1753981968.0,stories,5,1.0,False

I started off at 566lbs when I started the ketogenic diet and in three years I managed to lose 150lbs! However, I plateaued for a year, almost to the day ironically, when my brother suggested I give up heavy whipping cream (HWC), which I have with my tea (a coffee alternative called teechino) as well as any hopes of drinking coffee ever again. T\_T lol And after a year and a week of stymied weight loss, I started to lose weight at 3lbs a week on average!

Alright so me(M16) and my girl bsf(F17) have been bsf for over 2 years. So few months ago there was this girl(F16)who had a crush on me and was a grade lower than me. I used to be part of a mun so naturally I put up a story for promotion, so this girl started reaching me out through those stories and initiate convos with me. Then one morning I was chatting with this girl and she staright up asked me up for a coffee 😭Like no hesitation. Me being akhand single launda went for it, we had a good time and I liked her. Then we continued chatting and also called sometimes for the next few days. So then on my birthday I invited her, and I don't what took over me and her and we kissed each other( ik i am ashamed too 😭) and suddenly I was in a relationship. Now before jumping into the relationship I had already set my boundaries and told her that I was not looking for anything serious(ik i was stupid) and she was completely fine. So for the next 2 months I was with her. Then I realised that she was getting attached and I was also not getting any feelings for her plus my father had scolded and trolled me a lot for having a relationship. So i decided that instead of wasting her time I ended the relationship. I talked to her properly explained her everything and surprisingly she took it quite well. I was finally feeling better. Now the real shit starts, so my girl bsf and I used to play badminton on Fridays and sometimes went to the market. So on one Friday both of us went to the market the same way and on the way back my ex's bsf saw us(fu*k man 😭) and we just ignored it. So the next day there was a effing couple account of my and my girl bsf's name 😭😭😭 like bro WHAT!!??. So after some searching we found out that the account was made by my ex and her friends, so somehow I handled the whole situation and got that account banned and let the matter go. So after like a month I randomly got a threat call but I didn't pay attention on it, then those mfs called my mum and told her that I was making out with my girl bestie in the school washroom 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭WTFFFF. Somehow I explained my parents and that it was a prank call and my parents understood. So i checked with my girl bestie she also got threat calls. I was so confused, I reported it to the school and acknowledged it . But my girl bestie reported it to cyber security and they found who it was, some boys not from our schools. But guess what they studied at the same place I studied ( tution) and my tuition teacher was masa of my girl bestie💀💀. Those boys accepted the deed when enquired and guess who's name they took MY EX!!!!!. I could not belive it was her. AAJ KAL KE BACHE BHI BHAI tsk tsk tsk .

1me7bi2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1me7bi2/i_left_my_abusive_boyfriend/,I left my abusive boyfriend,"I know everyone on here probably doesn’t care because I’m literally a stranger on the internet. But I’m just writing this for myself really so I keep my word and in case it may help at least 1 person if they’re in a similar situation. 

For a little context If you haven’t seen my previous posts I (22F) left my boyfriend (22m) of just over a year.  He’s been very aggressive towards me. Punching things, smashing things in front of me, screaming in my face, he’s pinned me again a door punching next to my head etc etc. he constantly tells me he doesn’t care, doesn’t care about if I leave him or how he makes me feel. He’s told me he doesn’t care he’s abusing me as well. I was constantly walking on egg shells in case I started his next tantrum.

So today we was meant to go into town to get me some headphones and we was gonna get a coffee whilst we was there. I asked him if he still wanted to go and he said “yh we’ll go in one minute, let me finish this game and we’ll go”. So I started to get ready to leave. I was putting my shoes on and saw he was about to start a whole new game so I asked him if he was ready to go still. He instantly got mad and started shouting at me “oh well I was gonna play another game but no we’ll go now!”. I replied with “I only got ready because you told me we’ll go in a minute once that game was finished and I only asked if you was ready because I saw you was starting another game and I wanted to make sure you was still okay to go”. He started punching his desk and shouting so I went into another room. I came back maybe an hour later and asked if he was okay and that I’d like him to apologise now he just spoke to me because he could’ve chose to speak to me in a better way instead of shouting, being rude and punching his desk out of anger. He said he had nothing to apologise for and he doesn’t care. He started telling me again he doesn’t care if I leave and if he abuses me, started shouting in my face and yet again twisting it so I’m in the wrong. Telling me I’m the one who should be leaving him alone because he has nothing to apologise for. I realised he’s not gonna change and it doesn’t matter how much I cry or tell him he’s hurting me. He won’t change! 

I’ve tried every method. I’ve been patient, supportive, I’ve listened, communicated how it’s making me feel, I’ve tried to get his side to see his perspective and he refuses to tell me, we’ve argued, I’ve tried shouting at him the way he shouts at me to show him exactly what he’s like. Nothing works. And I realised what am I staying for. I don’t go out with my friends anymore because he doesn’t like any of them, he doesn’t make effort with my family or friends but I’m always making effort with his. He doesn’t do anything I like to do, the only time we spend time together is when I ask and if it’s something he wants to do with is only to play games and even then it’s only what he wants to play. He even ruins that time because he can’t control his anger when he plays so I just have to listen to him shouting and breaking things. He’s lost his job due to his anger issues and lack of care and is refusing to get another job so now he’s even ruining plans for us to move so I can start uni and my career. I’m scared for the future with him because I never want my kids to feel unsafe, I don’t wanna be married and trapped with his issues and financial issues. I don’t wanna be limited with what I can do work wise and with hobbies because he doesn’t like anything. I don’t wanna have no friends anymore. So I really thought what am I staying for. 

So if you are dealing with this. You don’t need to be physically hit to be in an abusive relationship and you don’t need to be hit to leave.

> *\[Lights rise on a soft amber stage. Behind her, a transparent screen slowly renders orbit trajectories like flowing calligraphy.]*
>
> ""Good afternoon. I want to talk to you about arrival.
> Not the drama of launch, not the tension of docking—but the poetry, and peril, of what happens when we arrive.
>
> Right now, today, we celebrate what once was science fiction: tens of thousands of vessels move between celestial bodies each week. Freight ships from Callisto. Return gliders from Vesta. Passenger liners from Earth, carrying dreamers, specialists, and the occasional troublemaker.""
>
> *\[chuckles ripple through the audience]*
>
> ""But with scale comes consequence. And the future, my colleagues, *does not scale linearly*.
>
> Imagine a planet receiving a hundred thousand ships a day. Each one carrying its own heliocentric legacy—its velocity, its inertia, its path.
> What happens when you forget to harmonize those arrivals?
> What happens when energy waste becomes the cost of thoughtlessness?""
>
> *\[The orbital trajectories on the screen begin to glow red as they tangle, pulse, and intersect.]*
>
> ""At the University of San Juan at Aphelion, we study what we call **transit resonance harmonics**—the art of softening approach vectors across thousands of arrivals.
> We envision planetary airspace not as empty sky, but as a living mesh—braided corridors, magnetic pathways, adaptive descent lattices that listen and flex.
> Our goal isn't to *control* arrival. Our goal is to *compose* it.
>
> In the next 30 years, we will need orbital zoning the way 20th-century cities needed highways.
> We will need heat buffers, energy sinks, and arrival rings tuned to planetary spin.
> We will need to write laws for the sky, not as borders—but as invitations.""
>
> *\[Behind her, an updated map shows incoming and outgoing streams around Mars forming elegant helixes of movement.]*
>
> ""So when people ask me, *why study this now?*
> I tell them—because the future lands whether you’re ready or not.
> Better we give it a runway.""

---  

> ""So what does it take to build a sky that listens?
> Not just technology. Not just legislation. It takes something older than that—**coordination at scale**, and the humility to accept that even in space, there are limits worth respecting.
>
> We propose a tiered arrival system, with three atmospheric—or orbital—layers:
>
> **The First Shell** is what we call *the Dissipation Lattice*.
> This is where ships bleed off excess momentum in choreographed intervals. It’s made up of orbital beacons, magnetic tethers, and timing buoys. Not automated traffic lights—but poetic ones. It is the most elegant choreography we’ve designed, and the quietest violence we must absorb.
>
> **The Second Shell** is *the Holding Canopy*.
> Ships dwell here in staggered alignment, awaiting synchronized descent windows. Think of this as the world's most polite waiting room—except every second spent here saves thousands of kilograms of fuel, and millions of joules of redirected heat.
>
> **The Third Shell** is *the Descent Archive*.
> Not a place for storage—but for *timed release*. This is where orbital dropships, atmospheric gliders, or tethered elevators take the baton. It's the final vector translation zone, where gravity and wind join the equation.
>
> And at each shell, human oversight. Pilots, programmers, pattern readers—descendants of the same mariner lineage that once read the stars from a canoe off the coast of Borikén.
>
> This is how we build the sky. Not by force—but by rhythm. Not by conquest—but by composition. And we must begin *now*, while scale is still our ally, not our enemy.""

---  

> “Let me be precise: We already think of traffic, supply lines, and cargo throughput in orbital terms. But we haven’t internalized what that scale actually *does* to infrastructure planning.
>
> When I say ‘port harmonics,’ I mean that our landing schedules should mimic the rhythms of our destination worlds—tidal gravity, heliocentric drift, even political weather. We can shape holding patterns in orbital strata, align entries with solar troughs, and yes—coordinate angular velocity to be *absorbed* by counterbalancing transfers.

> Right now, we think of arrivals as discrete. In the next hundred years, they’ll be *cumulative*. A thousand ships a day imparting fractional rotational influence—today? Negligible. Over a century? That’s climate. That’s tectonic torque. That’s magnetic field displacement.

> The system I propose is a harmonic gateway framework. Modular, fractal, temporal. It would map not just *where* vessels arrive, but *when*, *how*, and in what gravitic posture. It borrows from music theory. From Polynesian wave navigation. From birds. Yes, birds—because migration is the closest analog to what we’re trying to do. And we’ve ignored their rhythms at our peril.”

## 🚪 **Post-Talk Transition Scene: The Intercept**

*The conference disperses. Dr. Nieves-Rivera makes her way through a sparse corridor of glass and silence, still wired from presenting. A sleek courier drone drops a white-lettered envelope into her palm. She recognizes the seal: Isaac Brandt.*

She opens it carefully:

>
> Come to Colorado. We’ll make room for the future together.
> — *I.B.”*

As she finishes reading, a voice interrupts—

> **Mia Hernandez (offscreen):**
> “He writes those like he’s already decided history.”

*Valeria turns. It’s Science Officer Mia Hernandez, not in uniform—just a warm scarf, coffee in hand.*

> **Valeria:**
> “You heard the talk?”

> **Mia:**
> “We all did. You’re either the future of orbital civics—or a very well-dressed destabilizer.”
>
> *(She smiles, then gestures to the envelope.)*
> “But before you run off to his mountain campus, there’s one scenario your model didn’t address.”

> **Valeria:**
> “Which is?”

> **Mia:**
> “Acceleration lag across braided planetary economies. It's not just energy transfer. It's *memory*. If the arrival vector carries more than mass—if it carries behavioral echo from its departure port—you might be importing not just motion, but intention.”

> **Valeria:**
> “What your describing is an outlier case. You think the problem isn’t logistics?”

> **Mia:**
> “I think it’s inertia. And I think if you solve for that, you don’t just build better ports… you build a new kind of diplomacy.”

1me7aml,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToolTales/comments/1me7aml/uncover_if_panasonic_ne1054f_is_the_best/,Uncover if Panasonic NE-1054F is the best commercial microwave review for heavy-duty use!,"The Panasonic NE-1054F Microwave has been the go-to appliance in my kitchen for the past few weeks, particularly during hectic mornings and late-night reheating marathons. This commercial microwave, boasting 1000 watts of power and a 0.8-cubic-foot capacity, is labeled as “heavy-duty,” and I was intrigued to put that claim to the test in real-life scenarios. Whether heating up meals for my family, brewing a quick mug of tea, or catering to my coworker’s foodie experiments during office breaks, this product has been through its paces.

**Compact and Efficient Design**  
This microwave has a surprisingly compact design considering its heavy-duty branding. Measuring 13 inches in height, 16 inches in width, and 13 inches in depth, it fits snugly onto my kitchen counter without eating up too much real estate. Its stainless steel exterior gives off a professional, polished vibe, making it suitable for not just homes but also offices, hotels, or commercial kitchens. The no-turntable system is an interesting touch–I was initially wary of how that affected cooking, but it actually worked in its favor by offering more space for odd-shaped dishes.

**Touchpad Accessibility**  
The touch-control keypad is truly user-friendly. Featuring Braille integration, it promotes accessibility and broadens usability for individuals with visual impairments. The 10 programmable memory pads paired with a 20-memory capacity made it easy to store custom cooking settings. My partner set one for quick oatmeal heating, while I have one saved for perfect lasagna reheating. The colorful display and straightforward button layout take the guesswork out of operation.

[Find the best price for Panasonic NE-1054F on Amazon.](https://measuringworld.com/p/b005gspvhs/)

**Performance with a Bottom Energy Feed System**  
Here’s where the Panasonic NE-1054F Commercial Microwave really shines. Its bottom energy feed ensures minimal distance between the dish and the heat source, a feature I quickly learned to appreciate when heating up large casserole dishes or leftovers. Meals feel evenly warmed, with none of the dreaded frozen-in-the-middle spots. This energy-efficient design means everything from soup bowls to coffee mugs heats up without requiring multiple cycles. I used the six programmable power settings more than I expected; the mid-level setting was perfect for defrosting chicken, while the highest power level gave my leftover pizza that fresh-out-of-the-oven feel.

**Control Features Tailored for Convenience**  
The microwave also supports two- and three-stage cooking cycles, allowing seamless transitions between different power levels and times. For instance, I programmed it to defrost frozen veggies first and then fully cook them, which saved me both time and mental effort during dinner prep. The timer allows up to 99:99 minutes, although I doubt anyone would need that unless they’re running a marathon-level baking experiment.

**Pluses**  
- Intelligent keypad with Braille for accessibility.  
- Compact yet spacious interior without a turntable.  
- Fast and even heating due to the bottom energy feed system.  
- Well-thought-out timer and memory functionalities for efficiency.  

**Shortcomings**  
- The grab-and-go door handle lacks the pneumatic feel of modern designs, occasionally requiring an additional tug to open.  
- It’s relatively noisy during operation, which might prove distracting in quieter settings.  
- No automatic sensor modes for common foods such as popcorn or beverages.  

**Product Alternatives**  
While this Panasonic model hits a solid balance of functionality and performance, other commercial microwaves exist in this range. The Amana RCS10TS offers a similar wattage but comes with a slightly higher price tag due to its larger capacity (1.2 cubic feet). However, it lacks the sleek compact build of the Panasonic microwave and doesn’t include Braille-enhanced controls. On the other hand, the Sharp R21LCFS is slightly more affordable but sacrifices the advanced programmable options found here, relying on manual dials instead of a keypad. For those valuing precision and memory settings, the Panasonic model clearly comes out ahead.

**True Value**  
The pricing aligns fairly well with its features. For context, similarly categorized commercial microwaves range from being budget models with limited functionalities to high-end machines with ultra-large cavities and touch sensors. At its price point, the Panasonic NE-1054F offers robust durability, power-packed heating, and a professional aesthetic that makes it versatile for both personal and professional setups. The anti-theft component is a definite bonus for commercial buyers, especially for those installing it in public business spaces.

She is three years older than I am and I followed her lead on everything growing up. Admittedly, I used to be a human doormat and thanks to my fiance (Zack) and his mom I have made significant improvements in my boundary setting. With my sister I never had to set boundaries other than respecting each other's borrowed belongings, because she always looked out for me and had a strong moral compass so it was never necessary...until...

About a year ago, my sister who was pregnant at the time, came to visit me and my fiance. At the time Zack was my boyfriend of 2 years so we were not yet engaged but she introduced the two of us originally so they were friendly and familiar with each other. Prior to this evening, she had expressed some small concerns with me about Zack. Everything she mentioned, I discussed with him and I did not find anything I deemed relationship ending. Yellow flags at most, hence we are still together. The evening the three of us got together was pleasant. We had dinner together first thing. Then, knowing my sister was a firearms enthusiast, he pulled out his new glock to show her. She admired it and nothing was said to indicate anything other than her enthusiasm towards it. After that, she stayed another hour or so, let us feel the baby bump and left. 

The next morning, I got a message from her asking to meet for coffee because she had some things to say. This was strange to me but I agreed to meet. When I arrived, she told me she was sorry for leaving abruptly but she was uncomfortable and not okay with Zacks behavior the previous night saying that he was no longer welcome in her home because she does not agree with him wielding a firearm drunk and that she saw his finger on the trigger too. I told her that I wouldn't be okay with that either but that was not what I had witnessed. At most he had two martinis although I only saw him drink one, and it was after they had looked at the gun. Plus he had handed her the gun to see it so she was obviously not in any danger unless she mishandled it. Either way Im sure his intention was not to make her uncomfortable so if she felt she needed to set that boundary I support it but I dont agree with the reasoning. I also asked her that if she was choosing to implement that boundary to discuss it directly with Zack because I dont feel it's my responsibility to middleman that, especially if I saw something different. She did not agree to discuss with him, but I did end up telling him anyways since I was pretty upset. He was also very upset at the news because he had built a relationship with her and my niece over the two years. He ended up deciding to try to call her and bury the hatchet. Did she answer and work things out with him? BIG NOPE! She did not answer and instead sent him a books worth of text about all the problems with him saying she wouldnt talk to him because he would just use the conversation against me if she did. She accused him of being an alcoholic, drug addict, unable to handle firearms properly, financially irresponsible and added a second boundary with him. On top of not being allowed at their house he is also too unsafe to be around her kids. She said she would not be okay with having him around until she saw physical proof that he was being more financially responsible and getting professional help, only then could they ""discuss the possibility of a relationship"". 

This led to a lot of disconnect of course because I don't feel her discomfort warranted banning him from her house much less banning him being around the kids. If anything maybe she could have chosen not to be around our place anymore or asked that if we go there that he not bring a firearm (which he has never done when we go to their place anyways). I really think there could have been a more reasonable response to the scenario but I feel like she nuked the situation. Claiming a man is unsafe around children is a whole other playing field. 

Since she had not done anything to me directly i went low contact, but I also want to respect my fiances feelings so I decided i would also stop going to her house as long as he is uninvited. Even though we were low contact, I still showed up to help with three separate health related events watching the kids and bringing meals, etc. I still never disrespected her wish to not have him around the kids so even when i watched them without her i still did not bring them to our house. Amanda and I had a separate fight after all this where I tried to explain why everything she was saying about him was not correct. I never asked her to change her mind, but I did request again that she talk to Zack and try to find a middle ground because these are her problems with him not mine, but she refused again. I dont recall which argument this started but at some point she started telling me how horrible I was being and that I was intentionally neglecting her and her kids and hurting them by my actions. She also blamed her previous divorce on me saying that I was horrible in the way I spoke about my nieces bio dad and it was worse for me to do that because they were married. (I never voiced my opinion about him at all until she was considering divorce)

In December, Zack and I got engaged! It was amazing! He took me to a place we go often so I was not expecting anything and upon returning to his mom's house, his family had gathered and he had paid to fly my mom and brother in for the weekend and had a surprise engagement party planned for me after the proposal. (I live very far from all my family except my sister). They were in town for three nights, the night before when I was unaware they were in town, and the night after the engagement party. Neither of them told my sister they were in town to keep the surprise (and because my mom had been asked by my sister not to talk about me in a previous conversation so she obliged). My sister was not invited because Zack planned it and by her own request he is not allowed to be around her and her kids so frankly, why would he invite her. I posted the engagement on social media and my sister saw it while they were still in town. She had her husband call my brother to tell him how upset she was that they made no attempt to come visit her or even tell her they were in town so she could come visit. She had a full meltdown and ended up cutting mom out of her life entirely over it saying she lied to her.

Even though I am no longer interested in having my sister as my MOH in the upcoming wedding despite that being my dream since childhood, I still want my niece to be my flower girl. After all, I moved states away from the rest of my family to help raise her in her bio dad's absence/neglect. So I called my sister and pitched it to her delicately. I told her she could take her time and think about it, talk to her current husband etc and call me back. The conversation ended on a promising note, but then she called back. She immediately starting spewing all sort of lies about mom and my fiance and giving every possible excuse about why she still can't discuss the problems she has with him directly. Not my proudest moment but she got me fired up enough I ended up yelling at her over the phone and I am not one who usually yells. I told her I dont care at this point if they ever get along but I would love for her to get to a place where I can be in the same room as my (eventually husband) and my sister and our children for the holidays. Even if they could just be silent enemies would be great, and it's still not my responsibility to middleman their relationship but I shouldnt have to suffer just because she won't even talk to him. I have offered every type of conversation too. The three of us, four (with her husband) so she doesn't feel ganged up on. The two of them in public, even with a professional counselor or pastor. Whatever it takes to make it more comfortable and she just finds more excuses why she cant and continues to demand physical evidence of things that I don't feel she has a right to. She asks how she is she supposed to know hes safe around her family if I wont give her the evidence and I said ""how about you just trust me when i tell you as your sister that he is not a danger to you."" But she considers the original scenario as a danger to her. The fight ended with me uninviting her from the wedding completely, as well as our lives because she can either have both of us in her lives or neither and also we are not inviting anybody to the wedding who treats the groom that way. She has not tried to reach out to me since, and I also will not speak to her 1 on 1 at all unless Zack is present anyways because she only feels like she can talk about him if he is not around. 

I always dreamed of my sister being my MOH and with how much time I spent with my niece raising her I want her in the wedding. Three months left until the big day and I can't stop mentally punishing myself over uninviting them. Im not afraid to change my behavior or apologize if I did something wrong but I'm not willing to lose my man over something that seems this silly to me.

AITA? Please send advise! If I can still have them in my wedding somehow I want that more than anything. And more than that, I can't imagine going the rest of my life having to choose between family time with my sisters family or with my own.

1me793c,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1me793c/neil_degrasse_tyson_is_overrated_and_bad_for/,Neil deGrasse Tyson is overrated and bad for science literacy,"I just watched an interview of NDT by Hasan Minhaj (are links allowed: https://youtu.be/BYizgB2FcAQ?si=7jaQycKHlhD8kmHo) and it reminded me how much I dislike NDT. Hasan is so personable, witty and intelligent while NDT is pedantic and condescending. Hasan comes to topics with genuine curiosity and even when he's prepared and well versed on a subject, he approaches it with the humility of someone who knows they might be wrong. Neil on the other hand, approaches any and all topics as though he is the final word on them... every scientific discipline is his domain, despite the fact that I've often heard him say things that are far enough of the mark, that he would crucify someone else for the same mistake. He's called the greatest science communicator of our time, but I think he does a terrible disservice to science communication. A great communicator leaves his audience feeling smarter than when they started, he always needs to make sure everyone knows he's smarter than them. Contrast that with someone like Richard Feynmann, one of the most gifted theoretical physicist of the 20th century and an incredible teacher. Sexism aside, he could explain advanced topics in a way that drew listeners in, increased their curiosity and left them feeling confident in their own abilities to learn. (Some of his lectures are all available on YouTube and I highly recommend them. )

With Neil, the constant digressions so he can reinforce his brilliance is almost as bad as his constant need to correct people while only offering difference without distinction. Really Neil, nuclear weapons aren't a result of science? Gtfoh. He completely missed the elegant setup Hasan was laying out: nuclear energy started from a place of optimism and was leveraged to create the most destructive force ever created by humans at the direction of power hungry men... AI is starting from a place of optimism, could it end up following a similar path? Is it possible for late stage capitalism to leverage algorithms to destroy large swaths of our society for their own enrichment? All he had to do is say, ""yes, but here's why I don't think that will happen..."" But he just can't bring himself to follow along with someone else's premise without getting his hand on the ball, usually to the detriment of the conversation. Don't get me started on the glass half full discussion... why Neil? Stay focused my dude, stop sharing every random thought that pops into your head. Later, he literally says computers should do things that are ""useful and practical"" like make coffee and then calls Hasan lazy for wanting a robot that makes his bed, like, my guy, what are you even talking about? NDT does not strike me as a guy who does life's menial tasks for himself... does he grocery shop, vacuum his house, do his own dishes... make his own bed? Probably not, because he has too many people to insult and alienate from science. He also classifies caffeine as a drug, then says he's never done a drug, despite multiple anecdotes over the years about how he enjoys coffee, chocolate and various sweets (sugar is a drug y'all...)

I don't know why I felt the need to write this. I do a lot of science education and enablement and it's really not that hard to open the door to science for people, you just have to get your ego out of your way. In the end, trying to convince people that you're smart leaves them feeling like you're an ass, while working to convince people that *they* are smart actually leaves them feeling like you are smart, and better about themselves.

Tldr: Neil diGression Tyson is the Jordan Peterson of scientific discourse: he's slippery, annoying and actual scientists in the field(s) mostly ignore him. Also, Hank Green is a low rent NDT and should also be avoided. ",6,1753981636.0,rant,11,0.58,False

Opulent Dubai - Really enjoyed it at first but as it sits it turns into an overly ripe mango smell which I do not like. (2.5/5). Full bottle worthy? No

Lattafa Affection - Mad in love with this one. creamy pistachio. (4.5/5) Will definitely get a full bottle.  

Supremacy Collectors Edition - Hyped as hell by the community. But worth every hope. There is something in the Aventus dna that I DO NOT LIKE AT ALL which is also present in all of CDNIM perfumes. Apparently it was the inclusion of floral notes to lighten up the harshness. Ordered a full bottle right after smelling the tester strip. (5/5)   

Shaghaf Oud Azraq - The notes had me hyped for this and thank god for decants! It was simply waaay too powerful for me. Like even wearing a suit this would be too much. After the initial spray when it calms down it becomes more bearable but yeah. No. (2.5/5) 

Shaghaf Oud Tonka - THIS IS AMAZING. Very play dough smelling mixed with pistachio. The only thing that stops me from getting a full bottle is that its way too powdery. Making it too feminine.  (4.5/5) 

Swiss Arabian Opulence of Dubai - I might have just discovered one of the best smelling perfumes and that says alot since I layed my large bukakke nose on a lot of scents.  This right here is pure beauty. After having this on I realized this is PERFECT for both summer and winter or any season really. The sillage is perfect, longevity is perfect which is obvious since its extrait parfum. I know I sound like im glazing the shit out of this but I never glaze parfums. I LOVE THIS. Smells exactly like walking past an expensive spa at an expensive hotel in Dubai Marina.  Ordered a full bottle from Jomashop. (5/5)


Rifaaqat Adorn - I heard this is a clone of Tuxedo. Never smelled the OG but this was raaaancid. Could not stand it. Made me dizzy instantly. I love the OG Rifaaqat. Its one of my go to scents in winter. But this is an absolute no for me dawg. (0/5)

Amber Oud Dubai Night - Now this is what I was hoping and expecting Shaghaf Oud Azraq to smell like. This is very refined. Does not burn your nose and is on the money. Smells rich and expensive. Very similar to Montale Arabians Tonka. (4.5/5) definitely picking this for winter.

Nitro Red - I get it but no. Not for me. Watermelon note is making me dizzy (1.5/5)

Asad Bourbon - still on the fence. The dry down is much more interesting but it takes time for it to settle in and become what I hoped it to smell like. (3/5) 

Hawas Ice - absolutely boring scent. Smelled this one a million times in different scent houses done better if not same (1/5)

Game of Spades Wildcard - This is great. Quality. Smells exactly like Lafayette Street and yeah no complaints. Not exactly my cup of tea but I totally get the hype. Very pleasant. (4/5) 

Penis White - Smells exactly like those wet wipes from a 10 dirham shawarma joint in Deira. Pleasant? Yes. But nothing special and has a longevity of a post morning coffee fart. (2/5)

The car in front of me drove only 1 mile under the speed limit, and had me late to work for only 1 second, so of course, I only just blared my horn longer than an emergency fire alarm goes off, before I rolled down my window, yelled at their attention before I swore, lambasted, threatened, and degraded them with every insult. I mean, I only abused in a way that left them to tears when they just tried to go outside to finally heal from having lost a dear partner to cancer, where they fought against the depression to finally step outside the house after finally focusing on their personal health to get better and recover. Regardless, People… Am I right…? Everyone’s so terrible these days!

Oh, but if you thought it couldn’t get any worse, by the time I got to work, the new employee who is completely nervous and new to their first day didn’t ask me my pet’s name, or even offered to make me a coffee! So of course I ‘confronted’ them on the spot right in front of everyone infantilising their reputation, intelligence & ability as I questioned where their manners are and that they better make an effort with their seniors the next time! People nowadays are just so incredibly antisocial and inconsiderate these days!

On my way back home, I went to my local coffee shop to meet a colleague. And on the way, someone so politely, friendly, innocently, gently asked the directions towards the nearest library… They did what!? I know right?! How dare they?! I only shouted at them questioning why the hell on bloody earth are they questioning me, and that they need to pick up a book before they could even hope to be half as literate as a child to read written directions, and to sort that out themselves before daring to even go as far as to think they can just waste my time, energy, patience, before I of course insulted their intelligence, because of course my time is too precious because I like to think so, and I don’t stop for anyone, unless I need to insult them for innocently trusting me with a harmless query I could have resolved quicker than I went on a tirade only discouraging them to trust any last sense of dying hope for human kindness, because my time is too precious once again, regardless of how ironically I hypocritically disprove that myself. 

They only ever built up the courage after so much fear & trauma to speak to someone in public to fight their social anxiety and agoraphobia. Either way! I mean honestly, how invasive of my personal boundaries, time, and reputation! Do people no longer have manners anymore? No consideration for others!? When I say I can’t stand people anymore, of course I definitely mean it even if it’s because I really actually mean to say that it’s because I think I am better than them, than everyone else…

It didn’t help when I hopped on the bus after… I stepped on and saw someone with their bag laid on the other seat next to them, so I only screamed, belligerently exploded, & swore and threatened them to move their things, when I could have just asked nicely! People are just so selfish, inconsiderate, and disrespectful! I mean, they caused a public nuisance taking up space like that! I definitely didn’t blow out into a disproportionate reaction!

And when their earphones were buzzing with music, I of course digged my fingers with each aggressive tap on their shoulder before I again had to yell at them to turn down their music no more louder than my vulgar profanity I verbally threatened them with, because it was too loud, despite the fact that the city centre traffic and moving bus engine worth hundreds to thousands of heavy pounds was already loud enough for music not to make any difference… They only were going home back to a domestically abusive household living situation after being bullied on their day at school, but, what do they know?! People are just so damn annoying, irritating, pesky! I have had enough! 

What is wrong with people these days?! I just am so fed up with people, I just can’t stand people, you know I am about to make this my whole personality!

I mean, someone out there is having to be sexually harassed, physically assaulted, verbally threatened, just for existing with a characteristic they didn’t ask for, or for being just too much of a genuine good person to be stepped on, whilst they become traumatised into fearful submissive victims who begin to question suicide and their worth on this planet, as everyday they become more bruised, more hated, more targeted, more overwhelmed, more depressed, more heart-shattered… Because they are a part of a vulnerable minority, because they are a victim of bullying, because they are vulnerable and subjected to exploitation. This is their life… 

But me?! I have it much worse!! No one understands how much I just can’t stand people, I am the victim here! People playing their music in public, people innocently asking for directions, people harmlessly keeping their belongings on available space nearby them, people driving a bit slower to keep safe! I have dealt with it all! Right?! Surely when we mean we can’t stand people, this is as bad as the examples could ever get! Right? I have had the most bad rough day, right?!
People are just so inhumane and evil & have been the worst to me!”

This is exactly how I am finding people to sound when they say this same exact damn thing again. 

Claiming how cynical you are against people only because you think you’re better than everyone else because you think it is also cute then to make this your entire personality and completely undermine the real antisocial & criminal dangers innocent vulnerable people are exploited to everyday is so damn ignorant, entitled, undermining, and fucking disgusting. 

You thought these were your real world problems? You don’t fucking hate people, because you don’t know who the fuck you think you’re talking about, and im sure you’ll continue living just as fine whilst you ironically give other people actual excuses to become distrustful of others in life the other way round. 

You complain about the atomic specs of dust ahead of you as you walk across on the marble floor you demanded overworked cleaners to polish unrealistically perfectly under exhausting weather heat and dehydration, as you leave muddy footsteps behind you as you walk inside yourself in your heels you feel are 10 inches taller than everyone else’s existence you look down upon. I think you’ll fucking live. 

If that’s all the people you had to worry about and performatively hate to feel cute, then you better love & thank them.

1me735a,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinnishCottageSim/comments/1me735a/finnish_cottage_simulator_achievements/,Finnish Cottage Simulator Achievements,"**List of all (to date) achievements in the game, and how to get them 100%:**

**Bzzzz** Get killed by a wasp.

Just walk close enough to a wasp nest and the they will sting you to death. The wasp nest spawns in different places, look above the cottage door, in the sauna or above the shed's door when you start. Otherwise there is one at Pekka's cottage on the electric box. Don't worry, you'll get an option to respawn right after you die.

**A Rough Night** Drink enough to black out.

Simple. Just drink beer, booze or moonshine till you drop.

**Intrusive Thoughts** Kill a neighbour.

Make sure to save your game before doing this as they don't spawn back if you kill them.

**A Pleasant Aroma** Throw some beer on the sauna stove with the ladle while the sauna is hot enough.

Pour some beer into the bucket or directly into the ladle. The Sauna needs to be at least 50-55 degrees

**Jarppi** Throw a dart into another player's stomach while they're not wearing clothes.

This needs to be done in multiplayer. The other player gets undressed in the sauna's dressing room. Then you pick up a dart and throw it at the other player's stomach. For some reason it's important that you are dressed when throwing the dart for this to work.

**Alternate Dimension** Enter the backpack dimension.

This also needs to be done in multiplayer. Sit in one of the white plastic lawn chairs when another player picks you up, and puts the chair into the backpack with you on it.

**Through the Three with the Four's Blower** Turbocharge your boat or moped.

First you need to get the turbo from Jari, by bringing him 25 full cases of beer. When you get the turbo, bring it to your crafting table in the shed along with the motor you want to put it on, and a roll of duct tape.

**Traveler Man** Attach everything possible to the backpack.

Fishing pole with float and hook. In the shed in the beginning of the game.

Fishing pole with reel. In the shed in the beginning of the game.

Axe. On the wooden block outside the shed in the beginning of the game.

Thermos. On the kitchen table in the beginning of the game.

Fishing lure. In the shed, inside tackle box, in the beginning of the game.

Oil lamp. In the potato cellar in the woods on the trail to Marjetta.

Knife. In the Sauna jammed in the wooden rail. Spawnable.

Rifle. Given as reward from Marjetta.

Shotgun. Top floor of your cottage, under the bed, in the beginning of the game.

Wooden cup. High up on the cupboard in your cottage's kitchen in the beginning of the game.

**No Moose Left Behind** Kill a moose with an axe.

**The Usual** Steal a glass from the bar.

Buy a beer from Juha in the Bar, open up your pockets to put the glass in and walk out.

**A Rougher Night** Black out in the bar.

Drink until you black out inside the bar and get thrown out. A couple of beers or drinks, or a full bottle of Jari Taneli should do it.

**Real Gamer** Get three golden AYs.

Play the slot machine until you get 3 straight golden AY's on one or more rows. Increase the odds by setting all the rows active. They light up when activated.

**Kilju Salesman I** Sell some Kilju.

**Kilju Salesman II** Sell 15 liters of Kilju.

**Kilju Salesman III** Sell 30 liters of Kilju.

**Moonshine Salesman I** Sell some Moonshine.

**Moonshine Salesman II** Sell 5 liters of Moonshine.

**Moonshine Salesman III** Sell 15 liters of Moonshine.

**Moonshine Master** Sell Kalevi some exceptional Moonshine.

You make exceptional Moonshine by running it one more time through the pan.

**Touching grass** Cut your own grass.

Marjetta's got a lawnmower.

**Embrace Modernity** Get the water running.

Buy a submersible water pump at KAUPPA, put it into your well and connect the hose. Plug the pumps power cord in the outlet on the back of your cottage.

**Master of Mocca** Make some coffee.

If you somehow have never made coffee this way that's a bit sad, but here's how you do it:

Equip the glass pot. Fill it with water (from wherever) 100%. Add the water to the mocca machine's tank. Put the glass pot on the machine's heating plate.

Put the filter holder on top of the glass pot. Put a coffee filter in the filter holder. Equip a package of coffee grounds and fill the filter 100%.

Put the lid on the filter holder.

Start the machine. Watch the magic.",1,1753981268.0,FinnishCottageSim,0,1.0,False

4x pasta packs
3 jars of sauce
a couple of frozen veggie mixes
chicken thighs (froze in portions)
tinned lentils, chickpeas, and kidney beans
random extras like wraps, long-life milk, and coffee on offer

Now I’m sitting here trying to figure out how to actually use it all without wasting stuff - and wondering if this is how most frugal folks do it?
Do you treat the catalogue like a rough blueprint for meals? Or just stockpile and decide on the fly what to cook?

Still new to this kind of planning - my old approach was basically “what do I feel like eating today?” and now I’m trying to think more in terms of “how can I get 10 meals from this bag of groceries?”

Would like to hear how others stretch half-price deals across weeks or even months. Especially if you’ve got go-to meals that rely on pantry staples.",4,1753981219.0,AUfrugal,0,1.0,False

# THE FINAL PUPIL

***GAME INFORMATION***

***THE SETTING:*** For whatever reason, your character is interested in new work—whether they were recently laid off, just starting out, or are looking to transition into a new field, they inevitably stumble upon the job posting above and find it intriguing enough to apply within. If clever enough, the decoded cipher will provide your character with an email which they may provide their application materials.  
  
The game is set in modern day London. The world you exist in is split between common normalcy separated by a supernatural veil which harbors an otherwise hidden world ruled by fringe science and cosmic phenomena. In the ""normal"" world, fantastical criminal networks, super-villains, and the heroes and geniuses which attempt to keep them in check, rule over a crumbling society; behind the veil, a wavering line of psychic impossibility, unexplained events, and mysterious creatures threaten to tow the line between ""*hidden""* and ""*here"".*

***GAME VIBES/REFERENCES:*** 

* Similar Sources: *Sherlock BBC, The Platform, Hannibal, Squid Games, The Genius, X-Files, Psychic High, Inscryption*
* [***The Final Pupil Pinterest Board***](https://pin.it/7qhyu4Kr5)

***YOUR CHARACTER:*** Incredibly skilled, intelligent, desperate, has little to loose.  
  
***YOU ARE...:***

* Someone who is interested in a high-stakes, emotional game including violent themes and explicit content.
* Someone who is willing to delve deeply into their character creation and psyche.
* Someone who is interested in forming a community and friend group outside of in-character interactions.
* Someone who is an experienced writer, willing to match post length and quality, and post at least once daily (*previous MOTW experience not required*).
* Someone who thinks that out of character connections are just as important as in character connections.
* You are over 18 years old, preferably over 21.
* An ally or member of the LGBT+ community.

***THE DM/THE PLAYERS:*** My name is Lo! I am a DM (30, he/him) who has been playing TTRPG's for a little under a decade and writing for roughly two. This game is entirely home-brewed and, as it features my most favorite original character, is very dear to my heart. I am a lover of prose, and a hobby novelist who enjoys writing mostly dark themes or things that could be considered cosmic horror or psychological thrillers.   
As a Graduate student with a full-time job, my normal every-day-life is very busy, and I carve out particular times during the week and weekend to dedicate toward writing and my games because it is truly my favorite way to interact socially. I love yapping about characters and plot theory with fellow players, sending memes or just hanging out in voice chat. I would hope that anyone who applies to this game would enjoy those things as well!  
  
There are already two players who have entered the game, both of which are experienced in writing and TTRPG's and share similar sentiments surrounding character creation and out of character involvement.  
  
***THE APPLICATION:*** The application process begins with [***this form.***](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdpKTfDzfdlmRuGwpvEihAYIpwMRKVksbAqv8Y__dsGxbsZeA/viewform?usp=dialog)

I was sitting in that small corner coffee shop, the one that always smelled like cinnamon and burnt toast, tucked by the window as the world walked by. It was raining, just soft enough to make the glass fog with breath and memory. I didn’t have my notebook on me, so I grabbed a crumpled tissue from the next table, desperate not to lose a thought that had struck me like lightning. I was scribbling furiously, ink bleeding into the flimsy paper, words half-formed and scattered. That’s when you saw me.

I remember you noticing, just for a second, like your feet weren’t sure if they were supposed to turn away or walk toward something unknown. Curiosity won. You approached with a tilted head and the softest kind of smile, one that didn’t belong in a world where people pass each other without looking up. It was the smile that made strangers feel seen. The one that said, “I don’t know you, but I think I want to.” The only thing I remember clearly from that day wasn’t what you said, or what I wrote, or even what coffee I had ordered. It was your eyes bright blue under the sun,  wild, full of questions and light. There was joy in them It was real. Joy that radiated like a secret you were letting me in on. Something people don’t usually give to strangers. And yet, you gave it to me.

It didn’t feel like a beginning, Emmy. It felt like a reunion. Like somewhere, somehow, we already knew each other in the spaces between heartbeats. I still have that tissue. The ink has faded, the words smudged by time and thumbprints, but I keep it folded in my wallet like a relic of the moment everything shifted, quietly. You asked me what I was writing that day.

The truth is, I think I was writing you into my life before I even knew your name.

-Make Kandi bracelets in a local coffee shop. Invite people who look interested to join in (this one time someone did!). Both craft stores and thrift stores often have great beads for this kind of stuff. 

-Hike/walk in nature. Moving my body and surrounding myself with nature's beauty helps me appreciate a quieter though just as meaningful sense of bliss. 

-Save that season of my favorite show for after the festival. 

-Play the best sets on repeat!

-Call up loved ones. Text friends reminding them they're appreciated! 

-Keep up with the smiling and complimenting strangers when it feels right. 

-Beatbox my favorite song at work. I'll whisper it if I have to. Sometimes I'll clip a sprout somewhere for a coworker to find. Just being silly when I can. Bonus points for secret shuffling footwork now and then.  

-Learn how to shuffle. YouTube is full of beginner how-to's and choreography routines. 

-Hit up local art/music venues. The best thing outta coming down from a fest for me is the need to chase creativity and community; local venues provide!

-Wear my Shambs merch proudly wherever I can. Be the Shambs energy we all need throughout the year!

1me6tro,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1me6tro/life_is_a_disaster_how_do_i_restart/,Life is a disaster. How do I restart?,"Very long post here.

I’m recently divorced from my wife of 14 years. Her decision came as a total shock, and then the divorce was really nasty. I’m so gd exhausted.

I have 3 little kids part time (thanks, antiquated southern precedent). I work from home, don’t go to church (atheist), and lost all my friends in the divorce. I’m not close to my family. I’m fairly progressive in a very conservative region, and I won’t move because I want to stay close to my kids.

My entire identity was wrapped up in being a good husband and good father. Now that’s been stripped from me, and I just don’t know what to do next. And I don’t want to get back with my ex after she demonstrated such disgusting behavior during the divorce. Part of this depression is fueled by missing my kids, and part of it is fueled by the realization that I had no idea who the person was that I was married to. I miss who I thought she was, who she said she was, but not who she turned out to be. To say the relationship is now acrimonious is an understatement.

I go to therapy regularly and I’m on meds for depression. I’m frustrated with therapy because they say I’m doing all the things I need to be doing, to give myself grace for not having a lot of capacity for anything right now, but in the end I’m still in this awful place. 

Still, I’m pretty depressed. I barely shower. I eat cereal and frozen pizza. I basically roll out of bed, make a cup of coffee, work for 8-9 hours, get done and watch tv until I fall asleep and repeat. At work I mask pretty well. I’m congenial on calls, engaged and somewhat productive (although not as productive as I’d like or have been in the past). The laundry and dishes pile up, which only compounds my mental state as chaos in the space often does to internal peace. I barely exist as a human being until my kids are with me.

When my kids are with me I’m a completely different person. I’m alive, present, engaged, have much more energy, and can even feel joy and hope. We do fun things together, get outside, play, craft, all the fun things. As soon as they leave, though, I fall back into depression. It’s like I just can’t operate without them in my life.

It frustrates me that I know the things to do to feel better. I know that if I start eating better, moving my body more, and going out to meet people more that I’ll start to feel a bit better. But I just can’t seem to bring myself to do those things. I can’t seem to get over the hump/barriers to actually make a more nutritious meal, or get dressed in workout clothes and go for a walk, or shower and clean up to go out and be around people. In the spirit of engaging in a hobby to help I’ve started several projects that are currently unfinished due to lack of motivation to do the next steps on any of them.

And the meds suck. I have zero libido due to combo of meds and depression. I feel less lucid/sharp on them. I hate them, even though I’m grateful for them helping to keep my depression from being any worse.

And I’m trying to be present with my feelings. I’m trying to honor them and give them space to be. But I’m just so, so exhausted and defeated. 

I watched my dad shrivel up after mom divorced him, and I don’t want to do that. I don’t want to get stuck here. I just don’t know how to get out. 

For those of you who’ve been here, how did you get out of it? Do I just need to be more patient? Was there something that clicked along the way that helped? What helped when you were here?

He was 7 years older than her and groomed the fuck out of her. In the past two years of their relationship, he gaslit her into depression about her not accepting his polyamor side of his after hitting her and trying to force her into allowing another girl to enter their marriage. Long fcked up story there, turns out that girl was a ONS from years earlier, before she learned that he was married and she never wanted a relationship after that, is currently engaged to another guy, and he was just obsessed with her/the idea of it. They have been separated not even a year and she is on her third whirlwind romance. The first was her first bf from whom her ex husband stole her from, who had not grown up one bit since high school, living in his mom’s basement and all and being an emotionally immature lil shit, the second was some super sketchy neighbor stalker and her current one is a genuinely sweet guy from what I can tell.

What they all have in common? Love bombing! That last guy calms her nervous system and she feels like a kid (literally, walking around dressed like a 5 yo at Disneyland after having been all about business or 50s chic) bc he is super super attentive and selfless and personality wise every female romcom author‘s dream guy. Maybe except for looks, he didn‘t luck out there but he is sweet and innocent and they seem a good match. 

What shocked me today… they have been dating for two months, and my friend and I met for coffee and told me that she has been having a key to his place for weeks and vice versa and that they are close to getting engaged. 

I have always hated her ex husband, he is genuinely and very obviously icky and fake and have always been super honest with her (she encouraged and expected that) about any of her bfs and even though this guy might be a good guy, I think it is absolutely mind boggling that she is considering babies with him and marriage with her divorce not even being through.

He currently has four synthetic-free scents available - I love naturals and aroma chemicals alike, but just as an fyi. The samples are atomizers, hallelujah! 

If you are a fan of Pineward, I think you will find something you like here! I am in no way affiliated with Spathe but very impressed and highly recommend giving them a try. 

1. **Voyageurs** (*stewing vegetables, pine, maple candy*): don’t let the seemingly discordant notes scare you off, this is an amazing cozy, outdoorsy atmospheric. There is a fresh celery up front, along with a lovely mix of warm cooking herbs - yet somehow manages not to just smell like straight up soup. The pine isn’t a cold, bracing coniferous smell; I wonder if there are other woods in here because it’s sun-warmed leaves and needles and bark starting to dry out as summer meets fall. There’s no overt maple, it just lends a perfect subtle sweetness to help add warmth. 

2. **Colourblind** (*flowers, beeswax, honey*). If you like (strong!) florals and realistic beeswax, this is for you!  This one has the loudest sillage of the four scents by a mile. It’s heady but not indolic, there’s rose in here but it has a lot of company - I’m just not great at identifying flowers. It isn’t overly sweet, the honey/beeswax comes through more as a subtle animalic to dirty the florals up a bit. There is something citric as well, I get whiffs of something like citronella that comes and goes. 

3. **Fugitives** (*burning incense, coffee, church pews*). It opens with smooth smoky wood, with no hint of BBQ. The smoke settles (but doesn’t disappear) after the first few minutes to reveal the characters of the incense - resinous frankincense, myrrh, probably storax and benzoin - it truly smells like the thuribles at Catholic mass. There is also a prominent polished wood note, it’s unmistakable if you’ve ever been in a church! Combined, it makes the scent compellingly realistic. The sillage is close, you will smell amazing to anyone close to you but won’t overwhelm anyone with smoke! 

4. **Manitou** (*tobacco, cedar, sage, sweet grass, lavender, patchouli*). This opens with a quick burst of lavender and then cedar tea follows closely behind (it’s fresh and dewy and sappy green - smells of cedar tips, rather than dry bark). A herbaceous melange then joins in - dry earthy tobacco, zingy camphorous sage. The patchouli isn’t skunky, I perceive it as a dry dirt/soil element, and there’s a subtle vanilla coumarin from the sweet grass.

Level 3 progress update.,"[50 Hours Progress Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1l7o0nr/50_hours_update_attempting_to_break_out_of_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

  
Hello again! Yesterday I hit level 3. Despite a slow start to July, a strong finish allowed me to achieve my goal of reaching level 3 this month with one day to spare. I was starting to think that I wouldn't have anything to share with this report, but I feel like a lot has sort of come together in the last week or so. 

  
**Background**

I took my first Spanish class about 20 years ago, but have been stuck in this intermediate, tourist-level purgatory for years. I've had stretches of sustained motivation to learn Spanish and stretches where I have abandoned language learning altogether. Although I have not tested, I would conservatively say I began DS at a low-B1 level. I still would say I'm at B1, but improvements have been noticeable. 

**What Have I Been Doing?**

Watching a lot of videos. Of my 150 hours, only 14 have come from outside the DS platform. Those 14 hours are a mixture of ECJ, No Hay Tos, Casa De Flores on Netflix, or a mixture of various Podcasts/YouTube channels that I tried for an episode, but did not listen/watch further. But the vast majority of my time has been spent watching DS videos. Right now, the sweet spot for me are videos in the 50-55 rating level while I'm working, washing dishes, walking to work, in the shower, etc, and in the 55-65 range when I'm able to focus more. 

In late June, I also downloaded Tandem and Hello Talk and have been using both extensively. Truth be told, I don't know how much Spanish I'm actually learning on there, but I've met some great people and it has done worders for keeping my motivation high. 

I also started reading graded readers. As of today, I have read all of Juan Fernandez's A2 graded readers. I recall a Pablo video where he shares a study that found students who read books below their level learned more than students who read books at or above their level, so I'm starting at A2. Now that I am done with Juan's books, I'm going to move on to Paco Ardit's A2 books. So far I've read about 70,000 words. While I enjoy reading, it's still too early to tell if it's helping me and, if so, to what extent. 

**What is Working?**

Comprehensible Input is working. At the start of level 2, I was desperate for content that really appealed to me, so I pushed the limits of what I could comprehend. This led to me watching Casa de Flores on Netflix with subtitles. I also watched any DS video with a title that appealed to me, even if comprehension was lower. Eventually, I came to the realization that even ""uninteresting"" DS videos are still pretty good. Just yesterday I watched Pablo talk for 10 minutes about vacuum cleaners and I was riveted. This is to say, in the last 50-75 hours or so, I have been much less picky about what I watch. I sort videos by difficulty and just watch. Generally, if I'm at work, in the shower or doing anything else that takes mental bandwidth, I will filter by Podcast-friendly and play anything in the 45-55 range. If I'm able to focus attentively, I will play videos in the 55-65 range. 

Outside of the content itself, I purchased a waterproof Bluetooth speaker and a pair of Bluetooth earbuds, both are paying huge dividends. I'm able to get 10 minutes of CI in the shower and 20 minutes on my walk to/from work. My goal is 1 hour per day, so being able to get 30 minutes while doing things I have to do anyway is invaluable. 

**What Isn't Working?**

My toxic trait is scoreboard watching. I love to see the hour tracker change on the DS page. That was fine on levels 1 and 2, but I can't be doing that now that I have 150 hours to go until I reach level 4. I need to forget about the hours tracker and just get in CI hours. 

I also spent a lot of time searching for videos at this level. While I got better at it more recently, I still spent a lot of time finding just the right video. This is time that I could have spent listening. Rather than spending 5 minutes to find the perfect 10 minute video, I want to lower my standards, and watch anything. I also want to get more into podcasts and longer DS series. This should help me log more hours. 

I have mixed feelings about Tandem and Hello Talk. On one hand, it's nice to chat with people, see how they use the language, and get practice writing. On the other hand, I've only had one Crosstalk session out of it, and I feel like I keep having the same conversations over and over again. I'm not learning anything by repeatedly talking about where I'm from, what I do for work, what my hobbies are, etc. With the few people that I've built actual friendships with, we can branch out and discuss random topics, which is nice. I will continue to use the apps because I find them fun, but I don't think the time spent on the apps is time well spent from a language learning perspective. I see them as entertainment, not educational, and I have not logged any hours from these apps. 

**What is Accessible to Me?**

My biggest win of level 2 is completely unlocking ECJ. At the beginning, it was a stretch for me. I could understand, but it was sort of painful to listen to in a way that's hard to describe. I didn't really like his way of speaking and he always seemed out of breath, which just annoyed me. Just a couple days ago, I put on an episode for the first time in a while and I was blown away by how easy it was. In hindsight, my annoyance with Juan was probably related to my frustration with myself for not quite being able to comprehend as much as I felt I should. My apologies to Juan. I ended up listening to 4 episodes yesterday and it was Juan who carried me over the 150 hours mark. 

Most DS content is accessible to me. The Super Beginner stuff is now painfully slow. The Beginner content is too, but I like to watch a video or two as a warmup. Almost all intermediate videos are accessible as well. Advanced can be hit or miss depending on who the guide is and what the topic is. 

**What is Still Out of Reach?**

Truthfully, I haven't pushed myself as hard with DS content, so I can't say for certain at what rating level I start to lose comprehension, but I estimate that it's somewhere in the 70-80 range. I find the main guides to all be more accessible at higher levels, but guides like Tomas or Jose Maria are much more challenging for me. I also have trouble with the Advice for Redditors series. Rather than push myself too early, I'm saving them for when they are appropriate and I can enjoy them more. 

Native content is still out of reach for me. I watched Casa de Flores with subtitles and was able to understand the messages, but it was very mentally taxing. I could not look away from the TV without missing stuff and I found that, while I thought the show was good, it wasn't super enjoyable to watch because I couldn't do anything else while I watched. No browsing Reddit, no watching while I cooked dinner, no chatting with my gf. 

No Hay Tos isn't out of reach, but it's still a challenge. I think I will enjoy it more later on, so I'm saving it for when it's fully comprehensible. With No Hay Tos and any podcast, the biggest struggle for me is my wandering mind. The second I look at my work computer, open Reddit, or do anything else, I lose the plot. Videos have been useful because they require more direct focus. 

La Segunda Guerra Mundial is another resource that is accessible if I can give it 100% of my focus, but I can't listen to passively. I really want to listen to this podcast and I feel like I'm close. 

**Biggest Wins**

The learning process though CI is subtle. There aren't single ""Ah Hah"" moments, but I have experienced a few things that make me think, ""Huh, have I always been able to do that?"" The first is unlocking ECJ. I can't tell you how pleasantly surprised I was to discover that the podcast is now very easy for me. For me, this is the biggest example of something tangible I can point to and say, ""Two months ago I couldn't do this, but now I can."" 

When I chat with people on Tandem or Hello Talk, I often get asked if I am Latino or if I have family who are native speakers. I count this as a huge compliment. I also often get complimented on my writing/grammar and my pronunciation when I send voice notes. 

I've also noticed an improved sense for how to say certain things, even though I can't quite explain the reasoning behind it, especially the use of pronouns and articles. I remember this used to be super confusing for me as a student in high school. Now, I can sense that I'm improving in this regard and I'll find myself writing sentences that *feel right* but I couldn't explain exactly why they are right. 

**Plans to get to Level 4**

I feel like I have finally reach, or am very near, the tipping point at which passively consuming CI becomes easier. I ended up logging 4 hours yesterday and most of that was passively listening while I worked. If I can consistently log hours during the work day without sacrificing comprehension, I will be able to put up some big numbers, as my job requires a lot of time alone at my computer. For this reason, I want to focus on getting hours from podcasts. It's just easier to rack up hours from 30 minute podcast episodes than it is from 10 minute videos. 

As for DS videos, I'm finding it rewarding to watch videos that are bordering on too easy. I find that when I can almost complete the guide's sentences for them, I learn more, because it's super easy for me to notice when a word is new, or when they use a word order that is surprising. I plan to watch a lot of videos in the 50-55 difficulty range. 

I would like to get more crosstalk in. I had one session at level 2 that lasted about 2 hours. It's great practice, but I need to put more effort into arranging sessions. 

Lastly, I am dead set on starting French as soon as Dreaming French drops, which I expect will be before reaching level 4. This is going to cause me to have to divide my time. My plan will be to get at least an hour per day of Spanish during the work day and then do an hour of DF videos in the evening. I'm going to France and Spain next February, so it's important to me that I pick up at least a little bit of French before I go. 

**Final Thoughts**

CI definitely works, and based on what I've experienced in 150 hours, I am now even more excited for the next 1,000 hours. The past two months have put into perspective just how much time an hour is. 1,500 hours is a TON of input. To put it into perspective, one of my favorite shows, Breaking Bad, has a total runtime of about 46 hours. It's absolutely wild to me that I could watch an entire 62-episode series and not move to the next level. It's also put into perspective just how little my previous Spanish experience amounted to. I used to listen to a couple episodes of Coffee Break Spanish and call it a day, when in reality that was literally only a few minutes of input. Measuring in terms of hours has been a revelation for me. 

**TL;DR** 

Improvement is gradual, but noticeable. Podcasts are becoming more accessible, which should make passive listening easier going forward. Reading and language exchange apps have been fun activities, but it's hard to say how useful they have been for me. ",2,1753980115.0,dreamingspanish,0,0.67,False

Detailed Review Inside!,"The Bosch TPU60501 800 Series VeroCafe Fully Automatic Espresso Machine found its way into our kitchen a few weeks ago, and I’ve been running it through its paces ever since. As a self-proclaimed espresso aficionado, my mornings revolve around a reliable coffee machine. This product promised barista-quality drinks at the touch of a button, and I was equal parts excited and skeptical to try it out.

**Sleek Modern Design with Practical Features**  
This espresso machine has a modern metallic silver finish that instantly upgrades the looks of any kitchen counter. It’s not just eye candy, though. The size, measuring 12.17"" wide, 15"" high, and 18.4"" deep, fits snugly into my designated coffee nook without crowding my space. The 5"" touchscreen display is precise, easy to navigate, and very responsive, even when my fingers are still half-asleep early in the morning. The included glass milk container is both aesthetic and functional, and its compact dimensions keep it from hogging storage space.  

[Check Bosch TPU60501 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0cwykb2mb/)

**Performance That Wows (Most of the Time)**  
What sets this espresso machine apart is its ability to concoct over 35 coffee varieties via the Home Connect app. It churns out a great cappuccino and a silky latte macchiato, complete with fine milk froth. Customization is a breeze. Adjusting the aroma strength and milk ratios to suit my mood each day is fun. I once made an overly ambitious six-bean-strong ristretto that nearly knocked me out of my chair—but that’s a user error, not the machine’s fault. The double-cup functionality is brilliant when I have company, consistently delivering two hot espressos in a single run with no dips in quality.  

**Ease of Maintenance – Almost Foolproof**  
I’m someone who’d rather drink the coffee than spend hours maintaining the machine, so the Calc'n Clean descaling and cleaning program was a blessing. It takes you through steps that are idiot-proof but thorough. There’s even a built-in water hardness testing tool, which I played around with compulsively for a whole minute before finally adding the descaling tablet. The only snag I encountered was with the milk frother hose—it can get just a bit tricky to dismantle and clean properly, but once I got the hang of it, it wasn’t a dealbreaker.

**Key Benefits**  
- Supports over 35 customizable beverage options via Home Connect.  
- Easy-to-use 5"" touchscreen interface.  
- Double-cup function is great for multitasking.  
- Self-cleaning program requires minimal effort from you.  

**Critiques**  
- Milk frother hose takes extra caution while cleaning.  
- Sometimes struggles with very oily coffee beans in the ceramic grinder.  
- App connection can lag occasionally, especially during peak Wi-Fi use.

**Alternative Offerings**  
Espresso machines at this caliber have no shortage of tough competitors. The Jura E8 is one I’ve tested before—it’s also user-friendly and makes a mean flat white, but it lacks the same Home Connect integration, which is a game-changer for remote drink prep. Meanwhile, Breville’s Barista Pro holds its ground as a semi-automatic unit; it offers more manual control for enthusiasts but demands more hands-on effort compared to this machine’s automation. The VeroCafe stands out particularly because of its sheer convenience paired with amazing drink variety.  

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
This machine doesn’t come cheap, but with features like a ceramic grinder, programmable drink profiles, and touch controls, it’s clear that Bosch aimed to justify its pricing with premium quality. For busy coffee lovers who like to experiment, it’s a solid investment. Is it worth it? Absolutely, if convenience and variety hold as much weight for you as the perfect shot of espresso. For pure budget-seekers, you’ll probably lean towards cheaper semi-automatic options that sacrifice automation.

1me6ili,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInPicks/comments/1me6ili/reveal_why_the_best_programmable_coffee_maker_by/,Reveal Why the Best Programmable Coffee Maker by Cuisinart Stands Out,"Cuisinart Brew Central LK6565000C has been part of my daily coffee routine for a while now, and I have a lot to say about it. This 14-cup programmable coffee maker is sleek, efficient, and easy to use, but like any appliance, it has its quirks. As an avid coffee lover who enjoys both regular morning brews and the occasional bold-flavored cup in the afternoons, I found this machine to be packed with features that cater to coffee enthusiasts. Yet there are certain aspects that could be improved.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The stainless steel exterior with a silver and black finish blends perfectly with modern kitchen aesthetics. It's a robust-looking machine, exuding durability, and it doesn’t feel flimsy in the slightest. At approximately 5""D x 5""W x 12""H, it fits nicely on my countertop without taking up too much space. The carafe, made of durable glass, is fitted with an easy-grip handle that remains cool to the touch, which is a minor but very welcome detail when pouring hot coffee. Though I appreciate the overall build quality, the buttons on the control panel, while functional, don’t have the premium tactile feel I had hoped for at this price point.

**Brew Strength and Temperature Control**  
One standout feature is the brew strength selector. You can toggle between regular and bold flavors with just the press of a button. I experimented with both settings, and the difference is noticeable. The bold option is perfect for when I need something stronger to kickstart hectic mornings. Additionally, the adjustable heating plate ensures the coffee stays warm for up to four hours, with three temperature settings: low, medium, and high. While this means I can enjoy a hot cup well into my second work meeting of the day, it would be even better if it included an option for a timer to turn the warmer off after a specific duration.

[Check Cuisinart LK6565000C price on Amazon.](https://newcookware.com/p/b0bpc31zdf/)

**User-Friendly Programming and Features**  
One of my favorite qualities about this coffee maker is how easy it is to program. The 24-hour programmable brew start is a lifesaver. Who doesn’t love waking up to the smell of freshly brewed coffee? Setting it up was intuitive—once I read through the manual for better clarity. The brew pause feature also deserves a shoutout as it allows you to pour a quick cup mid-brew without spills. However, the readiness alert tone, while helpful, might not be for everyone. Thankfully, it can be turned off, saving my sleepy self from sudden loud beeps at 6 AM.

**Cleaning and Maintenance**  
A self-cleaning function simplifies the maintenance process, and the ""time-to-clean"" alert light is a thoughtful addition. The machine uses a gold-tone filter for better coffee flavor and a charcoal water filter to eliminate impurities. Decalcifying is straightforward, but it’s still a process, especially if you’ve ignored the light for weeks like I often do. It’s not particularly a flaw but something to keep in mind as part of the ownership routine.

**Good Points**  
- Fully programmable for ultimate convenience.  
- Brew strength selector caters to different flavor preferences.  
- Heating plate with adjustable temperature settings.  

**Shortcomings**  
- Control panel buttons could feel more premium.  
- Brew pause function is great, but spilling can occur if poured too quickly.  

**Competing Brands**  
Comparing this coffee maker to other popular models like the Breville Precision Brewer and the Ninja Specialty Coffee Maker, the Cuisinart stands out for its focus on simplicity combined with customization options. While the Breville offers superior temperature control and an impressive pour-over feature, it’s significantly more expensive and can feel unwieldy for those who don’t need barista-level customization. On the other hand, the Ninja provides versatility thanks to its specialty brew settings, but its size and design lean bulkier, which isn’t ideal for limited counter space. For those looking for a balance of advanced features and straightforward operation, this machine hits the sweet spot.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
When considering the price, this coffee maker offers tremendous value for its features. It may not be the cheapest option, but for a 14-cup capacity machine with programmable functions and quality stainless steel design, it’s well worth the investment. The reusable gold-tone filter means I spend less on disposable papers, and the included charcoal filter keeps my water fresh without frequent replacements. That said, there are budget-friendly alternatives if having some of these features isn’t a priority.

**Why This Pick?** 

I just can’t trust Carlos Carrasco (5.91 ERA) on the mound here, friends. The man has an Away ERA of 9.26, and 4 of his last 5 starts have resulted in a loss for Atlanta. On the other side, the Home team is sending out Andrew Abbott (2.09 ERA) who is arguably one of their best; the Reds have won 3 of his last 4 starts by at least 2 runs. Counting on the Braves offense or their chosen starter to keep things in check here is a mistake in my opinion – I’m on Cincinnati to cover the RL.

Last night, I took my friend (on again/off again dating) for a second time to a non-alcoholic tea bar that is focused on community (ie: there’s about 30 regulars and we all know one another and chat life whenever there.) It’s a very special place to me in my sobriety and she knows that. We’re both mid 30s.

On our way in, there was a $5 bill right outside the door on the stairs. It would be pretty easy to assume someone leaving the bar would have dropped it. No one was around and she scooped it up like “yes!” I said “oh that’s awesome! we can use that to tip the tea-tender!” And she said “heck no, I’m keeping it, I’m broke!” but kind of in a serious way.

My finances are tight too, but every night at 7 they give a free tea to cheers the community and then we did trivia (also free) for several hours. I bought us 4 teas and tipped $10 on the bill, but not once did she offer to help pay or to tip.

I haven’t brought it up to her (and probably won’t) but it’s part of a string of behaviors she’s exhibited that have shown a lack of care for others/somewhat selfishness. In my thought, clearly that bill had come from someone in the bar/community, so why not pay it back/forward? Am I over reacting by thinking it’s somewhat rude?

The exam was harder than practice questions will lead you to believe. Cornelius Fitchner's PM Prepcast's practice simulator was by far the most comparable.

I believe that the PMI is actively trying to make the exams mindset proof (DM has also hinted this in his videos). There were at least 5 questions that i got which i believe called for meeting the sponsor, and 1 question where I am certain the response was to fire the team member. To be fair to the PMI, they need to protect the exam from gamification.

I took the exam in person, went with hot cocoa,, water, a banana, a peanut butter-oat-granola snack, and a scotch egg. I took both breaks to eat a snack, drink some cocoa, some water, half a banana, and use the loo. I would advise against a heavy snack like scotch eggs. Granola, tea/cocoa are good though. I would avoid coffee and too much sugar as the exam is a marathon, not a sprint.

Since I paid for AR's practice questions, I won't compare it to free Resources. I think AR's questions help you judge your understanding of the material. However, they do not test your knowledge of tools nearly enough. This is a big gap please.

DM & MR have good questions that you should use to gauge your understanding of the material. I think DM edges out here because he does test on tools and he does mention & explain ITTOs outside the scope of questions in his solve alongs.


I decided on Wednesday last week to write the exam. I started studying midnight Friday and booked a Tuesday exam on Sunday. In between the preparation, I helped my sister move on Sunday, and somehow watched the entirety of Doc Martin. My earlier preparation from Nov 2024 to Feb 2025 helped me be calm.
If I could go back and prep properly, these are the resources i would use, in order:

If preparing for 1 month:
- Elite Minds or DM Udemy course. 
- DM/AR/CF practice questions. 

If preparing for 3 months+:
- Cornelius Fitchner's PMP Prep course
- CF/DM practice questions 
- Study Hall

If i were to prepare with free Resources only:
- Google Project Management course
- DM solve alongs (all of them)
- AR solve alongs
- all DM PMP videos
- all MR PMP videos
- PM Prepcast free PMP simulator (CF)


Good luck everyone. On the exam and your future endeavours.

1me6bqn,https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/1me6bqn/the_past_100_days_a_romantic_tragedy/,The past 100 days: a romantic tragedy,"Limerence for the person I fell in love with this year hit a significant point in April. I recall running for half a marathon one night after an event she hosted, because I had this feeling in me I couldn’t shake. It was like an obsession. I decided to run until I stopped thinking about her. Instead, I ran until I couldn’t run anymore.

Unfortunately, things that filled me with “hope” (let’s call it that) began occurring around this time. She texted me, asking me if I were going to events. One night, she even invited me to her new second home with a few other people. It was a fun pizza party, and no furniture was even there yet. I felt very strongly at this point, but it was becoming harder to control myself.

I guess you could say I was becoming loose-lipped. Not everybody feels this way, but I was talking to friends about how much I liked this woman. One friend related to me. Another suggested I not pursuit it. Another brought up not shitting where he eats. I was confiding in friends because I was feeling crazy for her. And it just wouldn’t subside.

For some context, I got laid off in January. I also got laid off in 2023. Both times I struggled to find work until my unemployment ran out. Luckily I start work next week, but last year I lived in my car. When I got work again, I boxed and pursued a dream of competing in an amateur boxing match. I had been trying to do this for years, but the more my shoulder hurt, the less interested I was in pursuing it, despite being dead set and having my ego compel me to try. When I got laid off again, I finally just, gave up.

There’s a certain art form she and I practiced. She hosts events for it. I actually have been going to her events for a few years now. Anyway, when I quit boxing, I hit the alcohol a lot more consistently. I got more into this art form, and started doing it sometimes 3-4 times a week. I was practicing when I wasn’t job searching. I found a new community, and it was anchoring my mental health more than I realized.

I posted some depressing stuff on Facebook and she and another person reached out to me. She didn’t say much to me, but what she did say, that she was depressed, meant the world to me, because she was opening up to me. And I felt very bad that she was depressed. Wished I could make her depression go away. As for this other person who reached out (also in the scene), I confided in her how I was feeling. She actually came to root for me and was really supportive of me and hoping it worked out.

Also somewhere around this time, we had an art pub crawl where we performed at multiple places in the same night. After all the hard work she did, I decided to get her a thank you card, with stickers from her favorite show, and a gift card for a dollar tree, since she would joke about loving to buy stuff there when she was manic. I gave her the card before an event, and she was appreciative of it. That took a lot for me to do that. I was terrified of coming off as creepy.

In May, I decided I was going to tell her. She had accidentally messaged the wrong group chat that she was going to see if some guys on Bumble could be convinced to help her move furniture into her new place. Limerence = entirely ignorant of red flags. I decided to reach out to her and ask if she wanted to grab a slice of pizza, so that I could tell her how I felt.

When I texted her, she said she was busy, but asked if I wanted to attend one of her tours. I went to her tour in the rain. Everybody cancelled due to the rain, but she took me on her tour anyway. She even gave a spare umbrella to a passerby. She is a sweetheart in many ways. Our tour went by a landmark where a famous dead person had proposed to his girlfriend. I jotted this down because, well I’m limerent for her. I’m romantic. I thought, maybe I could ask her out here, or propose to her here someday.

I didn’t tell her in the tour though. It didn’t feel right.

Later that week, I offered to move in her furniture instead of making Bumble dudes into Task Rabbiters. I helped her move in a mattress. She even asked me if I was on the dating apps, but similar to the tour (her job), I felt that telling her then felt cornering. I decided that I would help her with all her furniture, earn up some brownie points, then tell her and ask her out. I figured she would reject me, and it would be cool that I would just disappear from the scene for a few months until I came back better again.

She went away for a work trip. I helped one of her friends move furniture into the house when she was on. I knew this woman was one of her right-hand besties. We were talking and somehow (probably in part due to my doing) it became revealed that she (the friend) knew how I felt, because the woman I mentioned earlier on Facebook had told her. I didn’t mind. I seemed to have gotten the support of two of her closer friends without intending to. We ate at the second home, finished up and she dropped me off.

That evening, I had decided I would make a fortune cookie, like the ones we made as little kids. She’s a 90s woman and so am I. I know she loves her some nostalgia, so I thought, might as well make it fun if it’s not going to work out anyway.

But then, the damnedest thing happened.

For the first time ever, she FaceTimed me. Of course I picked up. Seeing her looking at me, just having this chat, I was nearly in heaven. We were chatting and something in the air just felt right. I think for some reason she brought up dating apps again too. So, I asked her out on a date. She said yes. She said she was surprised she had a crush, because when she went to FaceTime me, she was like “why am I making sure my hair looks good for him right now?” I was so happy. I just wish this story continued in this direction. Dear God, I truly wish it did. But it didn’t.

I planned to take her to a fancy expensive restaurant for our dinner date. I figured she still might not be interested anyway, it’s not like there are any guarantees. 

We FaceTimed more, and conversations got intimate. Which was kinda crazy to me I’m not gonna lie. I had an idea that she was looking for one of those romantic movie types of love, but even if I was right, I wasn’t her type. But we haven’t gotten there yet. I remember her saying around this time, “I don’t know much about you, but it’s clear that you’re very good at courting a woman.”

We agreed to go out on a morning coffee date before our scheduled first date. I wanted to treat her to coffees and snacks, even though she earns more than me. I just wanted to treat her.

That day, we sat at a park bench. She sat close to me, said something like she felt like a celebrity with the paparazzi because we were two people in the same art scene dating. Now, I smoke cigarettes and visit that bench, hoping it can help me reclaim some of my heart and mental health. Eventually, I pray…

We talked toward an old house monument. I took her photo and our photo in front of it. It was the only photo we’ll ever take together, in that way at least. But at the time, I was hoping it would be the first of many. So many. I’m crying just thinking about it. I was already content with spending my life with her. And yes I obviously rushed and set her smiling in front of the building to my iPhone wallpaper. Rushed rushed rushed. Stupid man.

We walked a little longer because neither of us wanted the date to end yet. We went to a slightly hidden walkway near her home and we just sat. I believe she lay on my leg. When we got up to walk back to her place, we kissed. It was such an innocent kiss too. Frankly, can’t those be so much better than just rushing into sex and sloppy stuff? It was a proper, lucky, first date kiss on the lips. She asked me how that was. Admittedly, my pants got a little tight, but we ended the date dropping her off.

She went on another work trip. When she came back, she seemed to have reservations. Was I texting her too much? Probably. Was I doing something wrong? Probably. I know limerence can wear off over time for people who are lucky enough to date their LOs. It seems like when the friendship forms and the flaws are also recognized, limerence can shed and that person can become a more proper SO. Although I don’t know that for sure. It’s not like I got the chance here.

The night before our first date, she expressed her reservations. She wasn’t able to show affection right now. Said I was a catch, but she just needed to go go go right now in her life. I supposed I lied to her without meaning to, but frankly it was the mixed messages that got me just as much. I suggested we take things slow, not like date slow, but see where it goes. She got stressed and said she didn’t even want to take it slow, because even that was a commitment. She brought up how some guy she met months ago on Bumble, how she knew on the first date that it wasn’t working for her. When she told him this (and they hadn’t even started dinner yet), he said he felt stupid. Which wasn’t to me an unusual or mean thing to say. But she said his response gave her a ball of stress in her stomach. And when I heard that, I decided, no matter what then, I would aim to act in ways that didn’t cause a ball of stress in her stomach.

We went out to dinner, shared a bucket of fish and chips, and went home. It didn’t feel the same as our first date, but I figured, if she gave me this, if she rejects me now, I’d be content. Especially over time, after getting over the rejection.

The next day, I went over to help move furniture into her place, and we had sex. Total 180. In hindsight I … I mean I don’t know for sure but, I want to say that … I regret this. I wish we took things slower. For me, for her, for us, idk. But try not kissing on your LOs neck. I can see why this is considered People Addiction. Put coke in a cocaine addict’s nose and tell them not to sniff. And the worst part… I was just in LOVE. I was just being with the person who wanted to be with me.

Immediately after we hooked up, she regretted it. Like immediately. She had that ball of stress in her stomach I had literally just a day before decided I would do whatever I could to not cause. She asked me not to tell others in our scene that we hooked up, so I agreed. It was so painful. These were moments I should have been able to enjoy, which sounds selfish. I could only enjoy these moments if WE were enjoying those moments. She regretted it. Imagine your LO immediately regretting having sex with you? Throw me into a train.

I agreed to play it cool. That week, I attended an event she hosted. It wasn’t the worst — we gave casual nods as if we had a shared secret. That felt good.

Either that day or one later she told me she totally told other people. Which in hindsight, is another red flag. Putting up such a staunch and abrupt boundary just to break it later. I mean, I consider myself softhearted, but give me a break. So yeah, I told some of my friends in the scene who already knew I really liked her. 

I don’t think this is a bad thing, and if I have no character limits, you’ll see why I’m saying this later. I told my friends who knew I was struggling with my “crush” on her (limerence!). It was kind of like a reward for them too! They were so happy for me. They were happy for us. Things felt… well honestly the entire month was draining. But, she was hot and cold. But the cold wasn’t as cold as it would be yet, and neither was the hot.

We hooked up a few more times. She told me a lot about her upbringing. I hate that this feels like a “mistake”, but I got emotionally invested. Fully. I should have been more upfront with her about how strongly I felt I guess. I guess maybe in that sense, I was deceiving because I didn’t want to lose what I was having. I think this is a truth I can’t ignore.

Another issue that happened: one time she offered to treat me to dinner! Which was nice. Which should have been nice — we went out to eat with her right-hand friend I mentioned. Her friend and I chatted. I didn’t think anything of my LO chatting less. She was on her phone. I guess I wasn’t giving her enough attention. She saw some kid standing on a monument outside and went out and chastised the parents and had them take the kid off it. She told/asked me after back at her place, “you didn’t notice how quiet I was?”

She was jealous.

She began saying she felt like me and this other girl were such better fits for each other. I did my best to reassure her that I literally only have eyes for her. I didn’t think including her friend in conversation, who literally helped set us up for our first date somehow, who I met to move in furniture into her home with, would make her jealous. Keep in mind, she is bipolar, has some other issues relating to memory and trauma and stuff. She was writing on my hand afterward as we spoke, talking about how evident it was something was up with her based on how she was writing on my hand.

And how evident it should have been that there was something up with me, just letting her, desperately hoping for things to go back to being okay. Meanwhile, I continued to feel like I was walking on egg shells. Red flag again.

We hooked up a few more times. One day in particular, it was amazing. Keep in mind, to me, we were doing far more than hooking up. But to her that’s all it was (maybe?). She said she didn’t want to put labels on things. I now know that ambiguity is just not for me. It’s like cancer and extreme distress all bundled together, when it’s your LO doing this stuff. I guess this is what many of you mean by bread crumbs, push and pull, etc. 

The last day we had a good day together, we went back to do laundry at her place. We had just finished setting up all the furniture. We stopped by one of her event spots, and somewhere between the homes she misplaced/lost her phone.

After that happened, everything went downhill. Spiraled like Dante’s Inferno. All the rings of hell.

She lost years of content. It triggered a flareup in her MS. She had so much to do (she works like 3 jobs), and she had no cognition. She couldn’t move, couldn’t think. And this MS was squeezing her like a vice grip. Her ADHD was probably out of whack, as was her OCD because of the loss of routine. She had so many plans and passwords and phone numbers and things to do that were only in that phone.

I tried to do anything I could for her, but I mean, I just couldn’t. I just didn’t know what to do. I feel like I failed her. Whatever I did or didn’t do. Said or didn’t said. I’m so sad, and I will sound selfish when I say this. Now that she is better, I am sad that I couldn’t say the things for her to feel better, or just maybe shut up and be there for her, and for it to work out in a way where she wanted to be with me.

A few weeks went by. Obviously things were bigger than intimacy at that point. We were done before I knew we were done. We had some phone calls, but they weren’t flirting or cutesy or “I can’t believe I have a crush on you” or “I can’t believe she said yes.” She was lamenting over hoping god strikes her dead at 50. How her best days were behind her. How she may have to check herself into a psyche ward like her other family members had in the past. I wish I knew what to say to her. I feel as though my own traumatic upbringing was coming up here. I wanted so badly to fix things, to make them better. But I couldn’t. I felt like I did everything the best I possibly could, and this woman who I loved so much, just slowly slipped and pulled away from me.

I would like to take a blurb to write about things I liked about her in no particular order.

Her nostalgia for the 90s. For some reason, her voice even reminds me of the 90s. She is a writer and a performer. She creates communities and elevates people. She empowers people and is a wild child. She’ll bump a speaker down the street at midnight past a sign saying no loud music. She’s incredibly smart and successful. She’s a hustler. She’s got style - fashion especially. She’s practical. She’s ambitious. She’s an auntie who wants to make sure she has something she can leave behind for her nieces and nephews and siblings if they need it. She is an absolute stunner. Even her tattoos resonate with me. She has no issue telling somebody to chill tf out. She can be very chill too. She is wildly creative. I believe even without the manic high chasing she would be creative. Did I mention how gorgeous she is? I love her. And now every thought of her breaks my heart. Every memory I have of her is torture and sadness and I can’t stop iterating over them over and over, or thinking about her and her new guy together, happy, as if nothing we ever did mattered or even happened.

A week or two into June, after a quiet event, she insisted on offering me a ride home and said she didn’t want to do the hookup thing anymore. I have this pattern I notice now, where I shut down in those conversations, denial, as if I will handle this okay, and then utterly implode later on. I never try to, I just try my best to handle rejections and breakups. But some of them feel like this, make me not want to be here.

I should have asked her in the car that night if she had meant she didn’t have a crush on me anymore. I believe I asked if she just wanted to be friends, and she said “I don’t want to put a label on it.” So I said, well it’s cool, I’m not going anywhere, and she said it was okay for us to kiss (I had gone for like a handshake or hug or fist bump or something). After a brief peck of a kiss, I put my forehead on hers and told her to take care of herself.

Over the next couple weeks, my limerence hit the absolute limit, red alert, danger zone. I began obsessing about her even more, or maybe it was just that the obsessions changed because now I felt like we were incredibly distant, and yet I hadn’t come to the awareness and acceptance that we were done. 

I developed depression induced insomnia, by my own self-diagnosis. I would wake up around 2am every night, and not be able to get back to bed. I would just obsess over her more and more and more. The thoughts seemed to become less clear. But the pain became more profound. I could feel a tightness in my chest. I still do. And it would just be with me all day long, for weeks.

It was so brutal. Still is.

I went to a couple more of her shows, where she began joking about being SINGLE. Emphasis for how she said it also. I felt confused, like somehow my body knew this wasn’t right, like I was being disrespected, like I just wasn’t understanding what was going on. It became too difficult to look at her in the eyes. It became too painful to hear her voice. To see her. This woman, who I loved so much, seemed different than the woman from a month before. Yet she is the same person. And the woman I wanted to get to know I’ll never get to know. Because she doesn’t like me in that way. And because she isn’t the same version I have of her as an LO in my head. I’m grieving over this still.

I tried to get her to go back to another cafe she used to love and had stopped going to when an old ex boyfriend had trashed it and ruined it for her. This is one of those moments I hate myself for, but this is what happened:

One day, she went back to the cafe, and was laughing because the owners were saying “this is where {me} sits.” She texted me this, but at this point, I had felt compelled to tell her that I felt uncomfortable lately. I wanted to apologize to her for avoiding her, but it was just too much. She texted me asking if it was my job search causing me so much stress. I tried texting her how I felt for literally an hour. She kept seeing the ellipses because I kept writing and backspacing, writing and backspacing. I was so desperate to find the words that would work, not necessarily to bring her back, but just to let her know how I felt, for her to understand the agony I was in. I didn’t want to stress her out, to guilt her, to make her feel bad or push her away.

She called me and I told her I thought it might be ROCD. I know now that it was probably more so limerence. When I get insurance in October, I am also going to seek therapy and figure out what else is wrong with me, because this is just too much. It’s not right that I want to do and can’t enjoy life so often. It’s hell to me, that even while I work all day long she’s in the back of my mind, this figment of imagination, with so much emotion connected to a false image of a real person who has never and will never feel emotionally connected to me.

The following week in June, I avoided her after a show. I just hurt too much. But to her, this was a “thing” and a negative to her, because it was affecting her image in the scene. I again messaged her the following day, and said something to the affect that I loved her, and I’m sorry I didn’t want her to feel bad, but I need to step away and I’m sorry but I’m obsessing and I don’t know what else to do.

A week after that, I was at another show one town over (not hers), where I overheard from a few mutuals having a conversation right next to me that she was in a relationship.

The guy she had mentioned before our dinner date, he had been going to her shows all along. Apparently he “grew” on her, and after a show (the same week I told her I couldn’t talk to her due to my pain), they started officially going out.

When I overheard this, I went crazy. I blocked like fifty people in the scene. If I had seen them that night, I would have possibly assaulted the guy, because I was so mad, I have never felt this feeling in my life, and I never want to ever again. I left and thank God I did, because they happened to come there shortly after I left.

From there, I had to block her. I cried. Not as hard or as much as I wish I could have. But I have roommates and it’s hard for me to make the sounds. 

The next day I felt bad about blocking so many mutuals in the scene, so I unblocked them. But that had unfollowed us all mutually on Instagram. The reason why I did this is, because a decade ago, I learned that the social media checking is the worst. To see the stories of them, or mutuals, brings me to their page, their photos, their lives, and it’s not good. It’s the worst. I tried desperately to fight that and not make that obsessive mistake.

I grieved rather publicly. I mean, if you saw the shape I was in, I was so broken. I was trying not to cry in the cafe. My friends I vented to, I thought there was nothing wrong with this. I told people I liked her, that’s not her business. She told people about us after asking me not to. And then I told the same people I spoke to all along that I was heartbroken.

One person in particular who I texted was one of her guy friends. I like him as a person, even though he was the mutual I overheard from that the she was dating officially. 

I wanted to text him and let him know it was nothing personal, I just really needed to avoid triggers. But something got back to her, and she texted me (I had unblocked her 🤦‍♂️) in early July.

She asked me not to bring up her name to others in the scene. Said it was really unfair to her. Said she lost respect for me. Said she blamed me and that this was why she never wanted to date anybody in the scene, because now people know and look at her differently. Said this was weeks ago and I’m still talking to people about it. Saying she hoped the summer would help and that to remember that people were dying in Gaza, that I’ll get over it.

She also told me how she needed to tell this guy about us because she didn’t want him to find out otherwise. That’s when she got defensive because I, in my hurt mode, commented on how she’s literally dating the guy she brought up before our date. I felt like she had him in the wings the whole time. She got mad at me, saying I was accusing her of stuff, and maybe I was implying it. Either way, I regret it, and regret not saying sorry when I had a timely chance to. She said she wasn’t gonna let me guilt her, and that what I was saying felt manipulative, that she did nothing wrong. That she was nice and clear about not being interested and thinking she did a really good thing cutting me off and not just dragging it out and hurting us more in the long run. Said I could still come to the scene but to have the decency to look her in the eye.

I tried to explain to her this pain. I told her I’m happy she doesn’t know what this feels like. But it literally pangs my heart to see her. I even went so far as to wish her great health and success, and that this bf of her gives her all the love that she deserves. I apologized and said the only way I could not talk to mutuals in the scene about what was suffering from was to leave the scene entirely. It felt unfair — she has created this scene, so in that regard not - but she could tell people, but I couldn’t. I was the bad guy. She was the victim. I lost the respect because I did things wrong. She did nothing wrong. Probably red flag here too, like a cherry on top.

I’ve been NC for around 3 weeks. I still see her on tours, but I don’t look at her in the eye still. I accidentally saw her on a friend’s Instagram story lately. I can feel my brain change how it feels just from seeing things like that.

Not a lot of people in the scene have reached out to me. They probably didn’t know me enough, or see the unfollows and think I’m a douche, or just don’t care about me. I miss the community so much.

I miss her so much. I know what I’m doing is the way to go. But it feels like physician assisted ☠️ for people who basically can’t enjoy a quality of life anymore.

I am NC. I blocked her. But recently I unblocked her and blocked her again. I want to message her so bad. I miss her so much. I am so tempted to look at her photos but so know it will only do me harm. I hate life so much right now. I start work full-time next week, and I am such a depressed, out of whack person right now.

I am so sad.

Pick a cup,"Ok so after a quick chat with my ‘people’ ( Spirit Guides The Divine and Higher Self) today we are doing something a bit different. We will be doing a coffee divination - looking at love health career/money and life overall.

This is what I need you to do : 

1. Intuitively pick a cup -  the quartz one or the citrine one. Think on your situation or what you would like to know about. You probably will find yourself and your situation in it. 

2.  After you intuitively picked a cup, take a minute, make a wish. The saucer beneath will indicate whether it will come to fruition or not.

You can pick one cup for general  or one cup for finances career and a different one for love . You can pick  a different saucer for your wish, or you can think on two wished and choose one saucer for each… there are no rules except the rule that you need to trust your intuition.

But, like, she gave the ok for me to swear in front of her, yet admonished me when I used “jfc” in a text. “Wtf” is fine though? 

When her other best friend, also exmo, stayed with her last year, Sophie went out of her way to get her her morning coffee. Yet when I visited, I wanted to stop by Starbucks to get an iced coffee after a hike, and she was visibly uncomfortable at the idea. When I suggested I can drop her off and go myself, she was then visibly relieved. It was so awkward. 

She’s visiting me soon. I was invited yesterday to go to an acquaintance’s birthday lunch, and since it’ll be during her visit, I got permission to invite her. But because this lunch will be on a Sunday, Sophie declined. She said if it was at their house she’d go, but because it’s at a restaurant, she won’t. It’s so fucking stupid. 

Do Mormons realize how cringe they are when it comes to this kind of thing? We have so much fun together otherwise, and normally we just don’t talk church stuff at all. And I get that she’s still TBM, and her entire family AND extended family are all in. I know it’s such a long shot for her to finally realize how miserable she is. I see it whenever I visit her. Their exhaustion and misery when they come back from church is just palpable. I hate it so much. 

But I guess I just don’t get where her mind is at with this stuff. Why she’ll drink six diet cokes a day but won’t even be in the car with someone driving through Starbucks.
