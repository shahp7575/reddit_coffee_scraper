It’s like Barnes and Noble; just not a large organization.

I have many marketing ideas already to start; things to get traction, attention, and ways to draw people in - buy so many coffees and you get a free book, local authors read first chapters of their book on Fridays, etc. 

I would maybe do both new and used books. Perhaps a few other items here and there - maybe collab with small shops in the area to provide small boutique-like items.

I’m fantastic with hospitality and have my bachelor’s in healthcare administration which included education in lots of maths like statistics and accounting. 

I just don’t know how feasible this is. I don’t necessarily have the money to start this myself, and I don’t know if it would be profitable. But I’m tired of working in an industry where I want to help, but my morals and ethics are challenged everyday. 

I want to enjoy work again - and maybe not work for evil people anymore. 


I’m 27, and parents say it’s a bad idea. But they’re not fully trustworthy people - just tired of waiting for recruiters to get back to me, of job searching and not knowing if I’ll get into another situation with a corporation who just wants to line their pockets.

1l92m57,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrincessCruises/comments/1l92m57/princess_coral_review_june_4_june_11/,Princess Coral Review June 4- June 11,"Just got off the Princess Coral from Whittier to Vancouver. Overall we were way happier with Princess this cruise than we were on our last Princess cruise in March 22 on the Ruby. 

Pros:
Food was great in both the dining room and the buffet. I almost want to say it was the best food we’ve had in a cruise. This is our second Princess, we’ve done 3 Royal Caribbean and 3 Carnivals in the past. We ate breakfast in the buffet and dinner we’d switch between the buffet and MDR. We didn’t eat at any specialty restaurants although the menu for the salty dog gastropub pop up looked great. 

Not one bad meal in the MDR and most of the buffet food was great as well. Buffet was clean and had sinks before entering. When we took the ruby in 22 there were no sinks near the buffet, not even a close restroom and it grossed me out. 

We didn’t have a set time for the MDR and I didn’t really see any reservations open on the app so we just walked into dinner every night. We never waited more than 5 minutes and ate at different times. 

International cafe I only had a chicken pot pie there the first day but it was fine. I did grab most of my coffees from there. 

Embarking the boat was quick and easy. We took the train to Whittier from Anchorage. Bags went on the train and straight to our rooms on the boat, they had the cruise luggage tags if you needed them. We got to the port about 12:30 and there were no lines. Rooms were ready at 2. Train from Whittier was nice but I’m not sure id do it again. Uber was showing $121 at the same time our train was leaving anchorage but I’m 
not sure if anyone would’ve taken the ride. 

We only booked 1 excursion through the cruise line which was the white pass rail in Skagway. No issues and it was a really nice, scenic ride. 

Size of the ship was great. I loved the small size of the boat. We could make it to our room in 3 minutes from anywhere on the ship. Our last cruise was on the Allure of the seas and this was just night and day. 

Coral has an enclosed pool area which was great in Alaska. We could use the hot tubs even when it was raining. 

Entertainment was hit or miss. The activity staff did a great job with their trivia and game shows. The shows were ok. Not as high caliber as I’ve had on other ships but for what we paid I didn’t have high expectations. 

Port stops were all really easy to get on and off. No tenders needed in Skagway. 

Viewing room: I had relatives who took other cruise lines to Alaska tell us to get seats early for glacier bay because everyone is trying to vie for a spot. We had zero issues with that. Plenty of room on the pool deck, the deck above, and the promenade that goes around the ship for viewing the glacier. 

Cons: 

No regular brewed coffee anywhere except the buffet or MDR. We had the plus package but my father did not and it was silly for him to have to go all the way to the buffet just to grab coffee. Have a few of those big coffee pots set up at the international cafe and let ppl grab some regular brewed coffee. Not everyone wants espresso. 

Casino was small. Blackjack was paying 2-1 which is ridiculous. Normally I’ll gamble every night on ships, they had zero interesting slots I played $20 the whole trip. It just wasn’t fun. 

Ice in the buffet. They had them in the machines which was fine but they also set out big containers of ice with a scoop. That grosses me out so much. People touch that scoop with their hands and then put it back in the ice. They did have a separate spot for the scoop  but ppl are dumb and don’t use it. I just didn’t grab ice from there but I still can’t believe they use that system for ice. 

Not a con of the ship but we did that tramway thing in Juneau and I just don’t think it’s worth $60. 

We paid $1385 for 2 ppl in an obstructed view outside cabin. We booked late so there were no balconies. If anyone has any questions let me know.

1l92jyh,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l92jyh/i_found_a_language_that_programs_reality_i_think/,I found a language that programs reality. I think I said something wrong.,"I'm a linguistics undergrad, the kind of person who spends more time decoding dead languages than speaking live ones. I’ve always had a thing for obscure manuscripts and forgotten scripts. Stuff like Linear A, Rongorongo, the Voynich Manuscript; the kinds that resist translation no matter how many times you run them through a parser.

A few weeks ago, I was poking around this cluttered little antique bookstore I visit when I need a break from academic texts. Most of the time I walk out with crumbling novels or fake tomes, things I like to daydream about decoding. But this time, something actually caught my eye.

It was a thin, leather-bound notebook wedged between a 1930s Italian phrasebook and a box of postcards. No publisher, no date, just the word ""Noyar"" stamped faintly across the cover in what looked like heated iron. And inside? Page after page of symbols. Not quite cuneiform, not quite runes. Sharp, geometric, almost algorithmic.

I bought it on impulse. When I got home, I started cataloging it — breaking the symbols down, looking for repetition, syntax, anything.

Out of curiosity, I brought it to two of my friends. One specializes in proto-writing systems, the other’s knee-deep in computational linguistics. Neither recognized the script, but both said the same thing:

""whatever this is, it's definitely showing the patterns of a language""

A few days after I started cataloging it, I noticed something. Something scrawled in the margins that I don't think was there before. I thought maybe I hadn't noticed it, until I realized the ink was different, darker, fresher. Almost too precise compared to the rest of the notebook. I flipped through the other pages, searching carefully for anything else I might have missed. That note was the only one of it's kind. Not only that, but it seemed like someone had written it recently, maybe one of my friends trolling me. 

Later that night I couldn't get to sleep, so I checked the notebook again, and the note was gone. No smudges, no sign of ever being there.

I started checking the notebook compulsively after that. Every morning, every night. I took pictures, compared scans, even left a piece of tape across the cover to see if it moved. Nothing did. Not at first.

Then something did.

One morning, during finals week, I woke up and my bedside lamp was on the wrong side. I keep it on the left; I always have, because the outlet on the right has a faulty switch. But now it was on the right, working perfectly. No flicker, no problem.

I figured maybe I moved it and forgot. Stress does weird things to your sleep. I kept using this rationalization for the other things happening. But then the scar on my leg disappeared.

It was from when I was seven. A bike spoke tore a perfect crescent into my shin. I used to trace it when I was nervous. Muscle memory. And now it was just skin. Like nothing had ever happened. Like I’d never fallen at all. The next day I realized something about the phonetics, the pronunciations were implied on one of the pages. I tried to create a simple sentence based on what I had figured out so far. While writing it down, I muttered it in the pronunciation of the script. Seconds later, my desk chair (the spinny variety) rotated so quickly that the force threw me off. I still tried to pretend it was a glitch.

But I couldn’t pretend anymore. Not after that. Not after the chair. Not after the page.

I panicked.

I did something stupid.

I burned the notebook.

Or tried to.

It looked like it burned, paper blackening, curling, turning to ash. But after that night, I started hearing it. The language. Everywhere.

Not like a voice in my head. I’m not crazy. It was ambient. Like the room itself was whispering.

Sometimes it described what was happening, “a door creaks open,” “a hand clutches a cup.” Other times it predicted things. Things I didn’t understand until they happened.

I couldn’t take it anymore. I stopped sleeping. My skin buzzed with every syllable I didn’t recognize. One night, out with some friends at this Italian place near campus, I broke. I muttered something under my breath just trying to drown it out.

That was a mistake.

I don’t even remember the phrase. But I remember what it did.

I got a sudden, violent nosebleed. Couldn’t stand. I fainted. My friends thought it was stress. I told them I was fine. I wasn’t.

The next morning, that restaurant exploded.

It was all over the news. Gas leak, they said. Dozens injured. Several dead. But I know. I know it was me. I know it was that word.

I should have stopped. I should have told someone. But I was terrified. Not just of the language. Of myself.

A few days later, I whispered something not in the script. Just a sentence. English. I think I said something like ""you have to be careful in linguistics not to slip through the cracks.""

A few days later, I whispered something. Not in the script. Just a sentence. English. I think I said something like “I feel like I’m slipping through the cracks.”

And then it felt like I did.

It didn’t happen all at once. At first it was small things, a barista calling the name after mine, even though I stood right there. A group of classmates squeezing past me in the lecture hall like I wasn’t even in the aisle. No “excuse me,” no eye contact. Nothing.

I joked to myself that I was just being ignored. That people were wrapped up in their own lives.

But it kept happening. Professors stopped responding to my emails. My roommate stopped replying to texts. One morning, I passed her in the kitchen and she screamed. Dropped her coffee like she'd seen a ghost. And when I said her name, she just stood there, eyes unfocused, like she couldn’t track my voice.

Like I wasn’t there.

I left campus that day and nobody turned to look. Not a single person made eye contact. No one held the door. Even the sensors on the automatic doors at the library didn’t open until someone else walked up behind me.

I tried calling my mom.

The line rang once.

Then silence.

When I checked the call history, it said I’d never made it.

I tried a mirror. I was still there kind of. Just dimmer. Less contrast. Like I was underexposed in real time.

I wasn’t invisible.

I was being forgotten.  
In real time. By everyone.  
By the world.

So here I am, writing this from inside my bedroom, I'm scared to leave because then it might disappear too. I hope you guys can see this, and maybe give me advice.",2,1749671990.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Make sure to tell me ur interests, your gender & age and where abouts you’re from. 

Don’t just say hi please. Tell me about you so I can see if we’ll get on. 

I’m looking for genuine friendship, I had a child young and lost school friends and have been in a relationship that has ended up pretty much completely isolating me and would love to start living again and making good memories with good company and being more adventurous and experiencing things. 

I don’t mind if you’re male or female, from my experience in the past I’ve got along with guys easier as it’s been more chilled, no drama, they’ve been my type of funny and it just clicks better but I would really love to have a female friend aswell to get on with because it can be refreshing to have that girl time and girl perspective / advice on things (hopefully without too much judgment) and doing girl stuff, we understand each other on a different level etc. 

I think most importantly, I just want a friendship with someone where it’s 50/50, nobodies being bossy and trying to control the other, just chilled fun vibes. I don’t want to be around narcissistic people. 

My interests/hobbies: all animals (I have two chihuahuas), films/series, documentaries like true crime etc, beach days, picnics, music, singing, colouring (them adult colouring books), swimming, spa days, cinema, zoo, shopping, 420 friendly, cooking, just having a laugh and good time. I like drinking wine sometimes, going out for breakfast/lunch, dinner dates, coffee dates, walks, just chilling together, going to the pub for a drink, play darts/pool, I like to occasionally watch boxing.  

I’m more of an introvert so I’m better as a 1 on 1 person , rather than being in a crowd of people or with a handful of people. 

You have to be over 21, I normally get along with people older than me but if you’re around same age as me then that’s cool too. I’m thinking age range 21-35

I will NOT talk about politics or the news and depressive stuff like that. I purposely don’t watch the news because It’s draining. 

Can’t wait to hear from you ☺️

(Heads up my first few replies may be a little bit kinda short I guess just because I’m trying to work you out, need to get comfortable and actually find out first if this is something that’s worth giving my proper effort to because there’s so many people that waste your time on here and it’s annoying)

We are hoping to move out some time in August but are flexible. Hoping to get out of our lease by finding someone to takeover. ([Home - The Pearl](https://thepearlatx.com/))

Rent is $1830 a month, usually another $120 in utilities. Lease expires 03/01/26 so you get a 7ish month lease at the 15 month rate, in addition to getting our damage deposit. Depending on interest, we are open to a one time cash payment to sweeten the deal. Second floor balcony, walk-in closet, in-unit washer/dryer, everything works.

I know I'm ""the seller"", but I do honestly think the pearl is great. The rooftop pool is awesome, and there are grills and a clubhouse with a bar and pool table up there too. the three courtyards are great, there's a coffee machine in the lobby, and a solid business center to work in. Rooftop terrace has a sauna.

Also our room feels like it's one of the best in the complex. The pics below are mostly with all the lights turned off just to show off how much natural light we get. A Tree is perfectly positioned over bedroom window to let in light but not spying eyes. We look down on the prettiest courtyard and with the door open you can hear the waterfall from the ""river table"". We are second floor right near the main entrance and leasing office, and we are right next to the business center.

I'm sorry about the excessive posts but I'm getting ready to book and would love feedback. I've read through a lot of itineraries already, but want to make sure I've got it semi right. Things about us: We're going in November not over Thanksgiving, 2 adults and 1 teen, we are not sit at the beach and rot people but we do have time built in for that I think. We are active and like to be out exploring.  We love hiking for scenery. 

If I'm missing something obvious, have us under scheduled, over scheduled, have something lame on the list, please let me know!

Day 1- Arrive HNL 4:30 HST. It'll feel 6 hours later for us so the plan is to go to the hotel and crash.

Day 2-North Shore Drive. I know we won't see all of it but wanting to hit Kualoa Beach, Laie Point, Food Trucks, Sunset Beach, Pipeline Beach, Sharks Cove, and Laniakea Beach. Whatever we miss, we miss. I was thinking of using the Shaka North Shore guide but it seems like it hits a lot of tourist spots and I'm not sure it's worth it.

Day 3-Kailua Beach. Kayaking. If we're up to it the Blowhole and Makapu'u Point

Day 4- Pearl Harbor. If there's time, a hike tbd.

Day 5- Hanauma Bay (It's a Wednesday). We've never snorkled before and I read this is good for beginners, but am open to suggestions. We plan on practicing in a pool beforehand at the very least. That evening we'll switch from our basic Waikiki hotel to Aulani. 

Day 6- Relax at Aulani at the teen's request

Day 7- Fly to Kona and arrive at KOA by 1:15 p.m. Get to Mauna Kea by 4:45 p.m. Is this doable? I'm factoring in the Google 65 minute drive time and adding 30 minutes, and factoring in a 90 minute ordeal from landing to being at the rental car, and stopping for snacks. Sunset at Mauna Kea, stargazing, leave around 8 p.m.ish We'd drive to VNP which is another 90 minutes away in the dark and hope to see the glow. Stay the night at Volcano House or somewhere nearby.

Day 8- Volcanoes National Park. I've set aside an entire day for this becuase I genuinely have no idea how long we'd stay, and if we're tired we may get a late start. Stay the night again near the park.

Day 9- Check out at VNP, drive to Hapuna Beach with stops at 'Akaka Falls, Rainbow Falls, Hawai'i Tropical Botanical Garden, and any other suggestions. If we miss something, we miss something.

Day 10- I imagine we'll be very tired and we'll relax at the resort beach in the morning, and do a manta ray snorkel in the evening

Day 11- I've left days 11 and 12 blank for now. We're interested in visiting a coffee farm, a chocolate farm, a black sand beach, possibly snorkeling again, and hiking.

Day 12-

Day 13- Fly home from KOA. We can either leave at 2:30 p.m. or 9:00 p.m. I'm going to research more what it takes to get late checkout at our hotel, or even just book another night before we decide what to do with the day.

I'd love to see Iolani Palace and the Bishop Museum but after an extensive trip to D.C. where we spent 5 days marching through museums, both my spouse and teen are less than enthused as the idea of more museums. I might get them to change their minds by then though! Thank you all so much for the extensive help!",2,1749671715.0,VisitingHawaii,1,1.0,False

1l92fkw,https://i.redd.it/60n7fy49sc6f1.jpeg,How to kind of counter Yumiko (Warning: Long Read),"You know after some recent attention given to hammer, and by extension Yumiko I was chosen by the gods of assholery- as their deciples granting me a headache with pictures, some will say a Idea I'm not entirely sure they're actually right though.


But I guess until proven otherwise they are, and I guess that's because fighting Yumiko is jarring for a lot of people, since her sigs, make room for her to be frustrating in a wholly unique way. The answer obvious to me is just don't get hit but some of you still are getting bungle fucked by the fox lady.


And I guess it's some part of me is thankful I was chosen, because somehow I was worried there'd actually be better and smarter Yumiko mains here but only one of you exists and you don't feel self righteous as I do about it, so you Yumiko mains can fight over which one of you I'm referring to in the comments.

The worst part of that revelation, that this post will be completely ignored because outside of a few of you, people seem to only agree with me on the damn hat post which simultaneously proves my point that some of you are idiots doomed to forever be platinum Orion mains, while also making me consider denying my destiny by eyeing up the razor, the antidepressants and champagne, the double barrel, or that river hoping I get swept under the wake of a boat, and still I was trying to choose which of my favorite musical artists to go out like, before I wait too long and inevitably end up like Elvis where despite everything else that happened or lead up to that point people remember will only the fact it happened on the toilet.


But I can take solace in the fact that some of you agree with me about my actually meaningful posts after you're all done crucifying me for saying too many big words or just too many words in general, because I guess we're in Kampuchea, where being perceived as too smart is a crime, and for those of you who think Kampuchea is the name of a new Legend or a type of coffee, it's the name Cambodia had when Pol-Pot was around.


Now before this becomes a solo circle jerk about how the Brawlhalla reddit is dumb, here's a guide that's designed to help you beat my main. 

#The actual guide part

##Part 1: Yumiko is a Zoner*


The first thing to understand is that Yumiko is indeed special and I do mean actually special I'm not talking about the people who play Rayman ""Special"" where they needed another teacher there to make sure they didn't spaz out, I'm saying Yumiko's unique within Brawlhalla because she's what's called a ""Zoner"".

Technically she's a hybrid between a zoner, setplay, and rushdown, but that doesn't matter as you probably know what a rushdown is even if you don't by name since YOU do it, and setplay is fringe, and since I've lost my virginity, that means that term is just a little too fringe for me to elaborate on, and it seems like it's kind of absorbed under the Zoner title anyways, at least to me in Yumiko's case.


Now for those of you who can't drive a car, and outside of Brawlhalla have only seen Ryu in Fortnite, a zoner is a fighting game character uses their tools to play keep away from enemies or rather keep enemies away from them, and in the case of Yumiko, she uses her traps to dissuade people from getting close,
Because while the traps themselves aren't the most lethal, they can be followed up with a few dangerous attacks, including Bow Recovery, and hammer Nair and Sair, there's others but the idea is that you don't want to get hit by the glowing blue balls of fire.

A common trend is once they're closed in on Zoners struggle to respond and get someone off of them, at least traditionally, and while Yumiko doesn't do well when at disadvantage, she can do aggressive shit, which brings the other part of her identity.


The rushdown part, which for those of you who play other fighting games and thus, haven't opened that box of condoms that you got 3 years ago, first you should throw throw those out, because take it from someone who learned it the hard way with a trip to a clinic where they put a swab somewhere you really don't want them to; **they do expire!**.

Now that you're back from cleaning your top drawer **You** might still be confused by me calling Yumiko also a rushdown, since it seems antithetical to The Zoner archatype from before, but I'm not enough of a nerd explain it beyond Yumiko is really good at getting in and laying solid hits in with her weapons, but she has no infinite strings so she ends up throwing her enemies back to neutral, she is able to take advantage of *advantage state* as much as she can play keep away at Neutral, and she can follow up with a few light mixups or using other tools that otherwise require set play as option coverage for dodges and wake-ups, when she has advantage, and if that's confusing you take a deep breath because I feel you're the type to forget, and just think of it like she's good at winning more when she's already winning.


     And for those of you getting confused by the Jargon advantage is one of three states a fight can take place in: Advantage: where you're on the offensive, Neutral: where no one is on the offensive, Disadvantage: where your enemy is on the offensive.

 
       *Only one player can be on the offense and so whoever is wailing on the other is on the offensive or advantage. This is separate from who's attacking who because certain situations can force fights back to neutral, or some attacks considered ""poke"" aren't used to engage in the advantage and simply act as pressure to make entering it possible/easier.



 This basically means that Yumiko is great at playing neutral, and great at being in advantage where the worst case scenario for her if she fucks up is, she defaults back to neutral where she's great at playing.
And if this seems overpowered to you, I should take a second to remind you Blasters, Scythe, and Spear do this too, without Yumiko's other attributes speaking of.


##Part 2: Yumiko is fast/Stats


Yumiko is the fastest hammer and bow Legend* she's tied for the fastest foot speed at 7 for hammer with Gnash, and a 4 way tie for bow with Munin/Hugin, Vector, Ember, Kaya, and her dex is second highest for hammer behind Cassidy, and highest for Bow not that it matters.

And normally I believe dexterity doesn't really matter save for select weapons and odd end combos on Gnash because ugna bunga needs to be a bit more refined into ""if I shall Unga then I shall Bunga"" which good for him, I still find him and the people who play him genuinely fucking weird.

Yumiko, however, not only starts with 7 Dex which gives both bow and hammer great combos and other string options, she can actually sacrifice it to get 5 Damage while retaining those combos. (That and you don't reach any meaningful milestones until you're at 9 dex for hammer anyways.)

And while Cassidy's dex is higher, blasters gain nothing from it and, she has a slow footspeed, and by a decent margin, and while 6 dex is already found naturally with Bodvar, and Scarlet and Kor can reach it, the latter two lose their already lackluster speed and Bodvar is still significantly slower than Yumiko, meaning that by all accounts Yumiko's hammer is the fastest, technically bow too but that doesn't really have the same impact you'd hope it did.

However Yumiko is locked in at 4 defense since running defense stance makes her lose her already meh attack stat down to 3 and thus the opportunity to get it to 5, and I guess if you're really into hammer it doesn't matter but I am also assuming you want to play something other than Teros thus axe, or are weird actually like bow, in which case I don't know what to tell you.

Because you chose Yumiko over Teros thinking being vaguely furry is better than being outright a furry, not really but if it helps you feel better go nuts, and while 4 defense is serviceable it still means she's somewhat squishier making fighting someone who's stopped fucking around with the pretenses and admits they want to know what Teros has got under that loincloth, a pain in more ways than one.

But fortunately for Yumiko at least, unlike Jiro, Asuri, and maybe Lucien if he can't get his sigs to connect (knowing the people who play him that's probably the case), her weapons kill fairly consistently from on stage even without sigs, and are brutal offstage, which as far as segways into talking about her weapons, it's at least as not as stupid as wearing a helmet on a actual segway, we're going at a breakneck speed of 6 miles per hour, it cannot handle inclines beyond that of a wheelchair ramps, no one is doing tricks on one, I promise you the helmet isn't needed.


##Weapons

While I'm hesitant to say that weapons are what defines a characters unique traits but rather are what's influenced by how the character weilds them because Zuva doesn't do boots good but hammer his is MEATY.

But I guess it's fair to mention that with her Dexterity and Sigs Yumiko can easily just use her weapons side lights to keep enemies away and otherwise buffer attacks to suppress them further with her sigs, even slowly pushing them to the corner, even without landing longer strings or combos sometimes with just threat alone, but considering her speed and dex, Yumiko can use her hammer a little closer to a light weapon buffering heavier hits in more unique spots other hammer legends (except Bodvar and Cassidy) can't.

##Sigs

Obviously Yumiko's big draw is the fact she's a anime catgirl and a gilf, but a close second would be her down sigs as they change her from having weird hitboxes and a few mean slugs aka, into what she is, a zoner with brutal tools to catch people who work to avoid her area denial tools. The down sigs themselves have a few combos and strings you can do into and out of them but really they're immaculate for denying space on a stage, or even the stage itself.

##How to actually counter Yumiko

Yumiko as a zoner/rush down does really well in both neutral and advantage in a fight but she struggles when she's at disadvantage which might seem like a dumb statement since almost anyone at disadvantage is already struggling as per the nature of disadvantage, but Yumiko **really** struggles, it's best that once you have advantage you hold onto it for what it's worth, since most of her attacks and sigs aren't good at getting people off of her and are fairly punishable, the best she can blitz past with a odd movement or signand try to get to neutral, but you want to deny that because getting back to neutral is already in her favor by the nature of her tools.

So just just rush her, right? No idiot,  at least not always, a lot of characters simply can't get in through traditional means since her fireballs deny space, and she can still buffer attacks for the gaps the leave, and often those who are just too slow to keep up with her to get in her face just get locked out, those who don't do damage fast enough start ending up back in her neutral game more often, which means she's probably in advantage again soon after, and those who are glass cannons are able to do what's needed but often die  before.


Because while her attack stat isn't lethal on its own it's still solid enough especially since her dexterity allows her to spam fast attacks, and her traps do decent damage too, making her threat a rather innocuous one, and while her defense isn't strong it's enough that you're not killing her in 3 hits like say Ember, which probably goes to explain Arcadia's stats, sigs and weapons and how limited they are compared to the free form nature of hammer and bow.

You'll need to make sure that you get your kill because if the Yumiko learns how you engage and plugs those defensive gaps making a very annoying Tumblr safe space.

The best characters to fight Yumiko often are the best characters in general, or the very least are used often, Mordex, and Teros namely do the best, with Sentinel, and Ulgrim following up as they're durable enough to take some abuse before they're sent back to neutral, and once they get advantage they'll able to either keep advantage, or kill relatively quickly once in, because I guess being a slave to the **META** will never go out of style.


However, you can't exactly predict when you'll run into a Yumiko, and for those of you who can't brute force your way in, one thing I could suggest is, using weapon throws, I'm not kidding, weapon throws actually forcefully make the fireballs despawn if you hit the bitch throwing them because let's be honest fighting a Yumiko who knows how to use the D-Sigs feel like -sorry this joke actually got censored-

As they're not a detached attack like a thrown weapon or gadget, just a disjointed hitbox with janky frame data, and all attacks are stopped if the user is damaged, which if you haven't realized also means you can follow up very easily and start beating the bitch down.

There's other stuff you can do like trying to slide dodge through the bow dsig fireballs but as I found out that might not be safe and taking a 35 damage combo might have been the better call because Yumiko can still combo off of the back side of the fucking things for unneeded but stoll dangerous true combo that does 44 damage and a potential Neutral Air kill.
But if you can follow up you can still catch a Yumiko by surprise by doing a slide dodge, but I'd say watch out and take a less risky choice since you still risk just dodging into the fireballs and getting combo'd anyways.

The idea obviously is to avoid her fireballs in neutral and getting past her defenses and try to keep her under pressure, if you have her offstage try to keep her off, as offstage her DSigs don't work well unless she's in advantage, however she still has a lot of tools to get back that you should respect.


##Extra quirks and behaviors to watch out for:


Yumikos often try to use their hammer side sigs to recover and it's got a back swing too so often it's best to punish from above rather than banking on them overshooting because that can quickly turn into YOU getting sent off stage in her stead.


Gravity canceling DSig namely on bow is done for a multitude of reasons: so she can follow up more easily with Recovery or other moves since the platform snapping changes, So she can stuff certain attacks that go over the grounded D-sigs, or stop certain aerials. But it does mean she's sacrificing a dodge for this, which means if you can get in she's probably going to end up quickly in disadvantage if you play your cards right


Like every non-unnarmed attack her Sigs have a cooldown but The DSig doesn't start cool down until all the fireballs are gone, which means if you can avoid them, and start pressuring her they won't come back too quickly.


The DSigs explode, while not common you can still be hit by a stray dsig fireball that explodes and be sent off in a weird direction.


Yumiko's bow DSig puts her in the air which can allow her to avoid certain attacks including weapon throws if thrown on the ground. But also makes certain air attacks more capable of hitting her.",4,1749671693.0,Brawlhalla,2,1.0,False

However, I have always assumed I have prostatitis. My symptoms are frequent urination that comes and goes (but is persistent during the evening) and occasional urethral or prostate discomfort.   
  
Recently, these symptoms got a bit worse--I started seeing a pelvic floor therapist, doubled down on breathing exercises, and quit coffee. All of this has helped, although the symptoms can still come and go. 

I ordered the MicroGen test on a panicked impulse when my symptoms were worse (before I enacted the other interventions). I ordered it assuming I might have a UTI. My urine tests showed ""low"" bacterial load, but my semen tests showed a ""high bacterial load"" (as noted below). I didn't know what to think, so I turned to Reddit. 

I understand this sub discourages MicroGen testing for prostatitis. But does this sub uniformly discourage MicroGen testing across the board for all other potential problems--including a potential male UTI?

1l92dt5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1l92dt5/convince_me_not_to_move/,Convince me NOT to move.,"Hi. I’m not very good at posting, so please be kind. Also, this is really long, if you read all the way through I thank you. 

Here’s my full situation.

I bought my townhouse/condo 9 years ago when I could barely afford it. Rent was going up, and I just needed somewhere to live. I drained my savings and put 3% down. At the time, a mortgage was cheaper than rent. It's a 2 bedrooms, 2.5 bathroom and honestly, I lucked out. It was listed as 1700 sq ft because the basement is finished, but technically basements can’t count in my area—so it’s considered 1200 sq ft.

I met my husband 7 years ago, and he moved in pretty quickly. He’s been here about 6.5 years. It’s been a great starter place, and while there are cons, we’ve definitely made the most of it. We’re now at a point where we technically CAN afford to upgrade (if we change our lifestyle a bit and take out a mortgage loan)… but do we want to? Should we wait longer to save up more? Should we just jump into a mortgage now even tho it will feel tight (like I did 8 years ago) )but this time on a house that checks all my boxes.  

Although we are NOT rich, we are not scraping pennies. We are middle class but probably on the lower end of middle class. We’ve enjoyed having the disposable income to travel (4–6 times a year) and not stress about bills. I save regularly, max out my 401k match, and have about $45k in a emergency savings account I can tap if needed. Our finances are separate, and while my husband isn’t as strong with money, he’s on board with trying to save more. I recently suggested we start “pretending” we have a bigger mortgage and put that difference into a high-yield savings account. We’d have to travel less, but we could ease into the idea of higher payments and see how it feels. 

That said, I’m the one who wants to upgrade. My husband is comfortable here and has said he’d be okay living here forever. But he’s willing to moving for me. 

So here’s where I’m stuck. This post is really about convincing myself that I don’t need a new house. I’ll only move if it checks all my boxes, and I’m not in a rush oer say. I just feel like I’m in this weird limbo where I want to upgrade to a bigger house, but I don't want the higher payments so I'm stalled. I’m alao hesitating to make upgrades to my current place because in my mind they will not bring up the overall value of the house. Something in my brain keeps saying: there will never be a perfect time to move—and a bigger house will always cost more so we should just do it. But then the other side is like our situation financially is so good here I should just learn how to be happy where I am.


PROS & CONS (plus how we’ve adapted):

1. No storage space.
We have 2 bedrooms, both with closets, but there are no other closets in the entire house. We’ve upgraded both with walk-in-style inserts, double racks, and use every inch for towels, clothes, coats, shoes, files, vacuum, ironing board—you name it. We’ve installed wall hooks for hats, organizers behind doors, and even a mirror/jewelry cabinet. Our furniture is all multi-purpose: the second bedroom is my home office with a Murphy bed and added drawers (though mostly filled with office stuff now). Our bed has storage drawers, and under-bed bins from IKEA. Coffee and end tables have drawers, as does the TV stand. I added pull-out inserts under the sink, and cleaning supplies live in the garage. We also use the space under the basement stairs and the attic, though the attic is a pain and not temperature-controlled—our holiday décor has taken a hit. I’ve looked into overhead garage storage but haven’t pulled the trigger since I don’t want to keep upgrading a house I may leave. The silver lining? It’s made us really intentional about what we bring into the home.

2. No real yard.
I love being outdoors, so the lack of a private outdoor space is a big drawback. We’ve converted the garage into a bit of a patio/bar setup, but when the door’s open, we’re staring at an alley and rows of garages. Our ""yard"" faces a main road, with no trees or privacy between units. We’ve still planted flowers because they bring me joy, even though technically we don’t own the yard space. We even reseeded the patch directly in front of our unit. The HOA pays for landscaping and handles snow removal and roof maintenance, which is nice in theory—but they don’t remove dead plants, fix yard holes, or maintain the bushes well. They trim my lilac before it blooms and have trampled the lilies I planted. And while they cover the roof, we’re responsible for windows. Pros: low maintenance. Cons: not much beauty or function.

3. No good space for guests.
My family lives out of state, and we have a big friend group. We’ve made it work with a Murphy bed and a basement pull-out couch. Sometimes friends crash on the couch or an air mattress. It’s not ideal, but we make it work.

4. HOA requires owner occupancy.
This means we can’t rent out the place if we decide to buy something else—we’d have to sell and buy at the same time. That’s stressful and limiting. BUT, the plus side is that all our neighbors are owners, and most have been here just as long as us. We don’t deal with people constantly moving in and out or treating the property poorly. (No shade to renters—I know great renters! But my dad’s experience as a landlord has shown the other side.) So it’s stable and cared-for here, which we do appreciate.

5. Location.
We’re about an hour from most of our friends and the city, and we don’t know many people in our area. It can get lonely, and we end up staying home more than we’d like. But it’s a familiar place now. It’s close to two major highways and only 20 minutes from my husband’s job. I’ve found a potential area that would cut our distance to friends in half and be closer to his job but it’s significantly more expensive. If I stayed in our current town, I could get a bigger house for a better price. . .  but what I really want is a better location.


Other pros:

Bills are low. I know everything—mortgage, utilities, maintenance—will be more expensive in a bigger house.


What I’d need in a new house:

Everything I already have: 2 bedrooms, 2.5 bathrooms, finished basement, 2+ car garage, At least 1700 sq ft, max 2200 sq ft, and A basement.(it can be an unfinished basement)


What would make me actually move:

- A backyard that backs up to trees or a lake (ideally trees)

- Manageable yard space + space for a hot tub I don't want a large yard. 

- At least one more bedroom (guest room and a possible craft/sewing space)

- A  dedicated dining room

-Location that is 30 min or less to both downtown and husbands work. 

-Not a ton of renovation needed. 


Lately I’ve been wondering will a nicer house actually make me happier? Why am I so fixated on upgrading to a bigger placr? Why can’t I just be content in a home that has done so much for us?

If you made it this far, thank you. ",1,1749671576.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

1l92cy4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce_Men/comments/1l92cy4/social_anxiety_after_divorce/,Social anxiety after divorce.,"Background: 
It’s going to be about a year in a few months since I separated. I haven’t been dating or meeting new people and to be honesty I don’t think I am ready to date.

Context: 
Anytime I think I should go out meet people I am just overwhelmed with the thought of it , and can’t think of what will I talk if I meet a stranger or even if it turns into a date (casual fun conversation). 

I used to be very confident and this overthinking and lack of self confidence-  makes me think I might be having social anxiety. 

Problem:
How do I get out of my head and just go out and meet people for the fun of it. 

My objective: 
I don’t want to have sex, I don’t want commitment, I just want to be able to talk to women and have fun (coffee date, walk in park, maybe go watch a movie). 

A bit about me 
Living in Canada , Decent looking, 38M, 5’11, Not obese. Well educated, working in marketing & tech. I am also South Asian so skin tone is cinnamon at best. 

My Ask:
1. Pls tell me if anyone faced similar issue 
2. Any tangible solution that worked for anyone?

1l929pv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNPD/comments/1l929pv/dissociation_bizarre/,Dissociation - bizarre,"I left an abusive relationship with a pwNPD a while ago, and taught him a little lesson, nowhere near what he did to me, just enough to signal ""go away I'm not a good victim now"". 

But the price I paid was, I splitted myself in half. It wasn't the person who had loved him who left him, it was... something-like-him who left him. 

Let me explain.

I wanted to love this guy because I had the personality of an idealistic traumatized puppy, and when you love people you make an effort to understand them. So I poured a lof of energy into seeing things from his perspective, for years. I tried to ""wear his mind"" to perceive, interpret, and act on the world, from morning coffee to the people around us.

And it worked more that I would have ever imagined, even if this ""person"" I created wasn't completely identical to him. But he wouldn't have tolerated his abuse, and now that I had created this introjection of him in my self I couldn't either, so I said bye. 

A feeling of victory, competence, and freedom washed over me. That allowed me, in due time, to attract a healthy partner among other things (which will be relevant).

Now I'm stuck with this internalization of my abuser as a part of me, and I developed some amnesia between the parts, meaning that the puppygirl part of myself doesn't always remember what happens while I ""wear his mind"" (which is not a sort-of-choice anymore, it just happens whenever I sense danger or frustration or care deeply about a goal) and the same is true for ""him"", although it's not a complete blackout either.

The situations where this is most evident are
-my romantic relationship, because the puppygirl loves my bf, while the introjection thinks the time together would be better spent working out, and finds love aggravating because he feels it's an obstacle to his ability to take the wheel
-their different relationship with food, which complicates things

While I'm not trauma-bonded to my abuser anymore, I love the protection the introjection grants me, but I find it difficult and confusing to navigate being... kind-of-two (I call them personality states even if people at r/DID don't like this expression, but I find it fits my situation although not perfectly since they have names and such. It's hard to explain)

So, I know little about the theory of narcissism except for what I could gather from the experience of interacting with this guy in the external world and in this slightly different version inside. The introject isn't abusive (I don't think he would qualify for a NPD diagnosis if he was a person, he is highly self-protective and has a refined understanding of power dynamics, but he isn't very social, he has stronger schizoid traits than the original ""model"", and is kinda passive and limited in his self-aggrandizement, taking opportunites rather than looking for them, focused on controlling himself more than controlling others -besides what's necessary to avoid victimization-) but he sabotages my relationship repeatedly and seemingly out of the blue, so much so that my bf at some point suggested I could be split and that's when I discovered that's actually a thing in real life not just movies. The puppygirl sustains the relationship (honestly, my bf is a great ally and makes life richer and deeper), but has a tendency to feel sad and numb and in general be a bitch that I would gladly do without.

My question to people with NPD is: how do I manage the introject? What's the goal with him? Not his goal, I know his goals, but I don't understand for example whether his cynism is wisdom or pathology sometimes. I guess this is a common problem for you all. Where do you people draw the line? Do you get a feeling of suffocation from (non-abusive) relationships?",1,1749671308.0,AskNPD,0,1.0,False

The date is Tuesday  September 15th. I just finished meeting with Emma’s parents Mr. Edward and Mrs. Julia Brown. I met up with them at their home around 1 o’clock and we all sat down in the living room of their home. Edward did most of the talking during the meeting. I noticed Julia was busying herself in the kitchen mostly and when she finally did sit down, she fidgeted with her hands a lot, but the coffee and cookies she brought out were delicious. Edward told me that Emma and Alice had been friends since they were kids and Alice was the one who got Emma the job at the store. They had plans to get a car and start saving up to get an apartment together when they went to college next year, figuring that it would be cheaper than paying for a dorm. It really gave them peace of mind knowing neither girl would be there alone, Emma and Alice were so close. Julia Brown says those girls were the Ying to each other’s yang and helped balance each other out. Emma helped to keep Alice grounded and out of trouble and Alice taught Emma that it’s ok to let loose and have fun sometimes. As I learned from Julia that Alice only had her father, her mother ran out on them when she was very young and was out of the picture before the girls met. Julia said she considers Alice apart of the family and Jacob Scott {Alice’s father} is practically an uncle to Emma, the funeral is in four days and at this Mrs. Brown had to leave the room and compose herself all she said before leaving was that she felt like she was losing a daughter too and she couldn’t bear the thought of Emma not being there or never coming home. She then excused herself and went upstairs to her daughter’s room and wept. Mr. Brown said she has been doing that every day since they left the hospital, we just want our girl back he says, and I could tell it took everything this man had to keep himself together in saying that. I thanked him for their help and continued patience and left the family to their grief. I have tried to reach Jacob Scott before but as I understand the man works a lot as a construction foreman and as of, yet I haven’t had a chance to speak with him. I do know that at the time of the incident he was a few towns over doing some structure work on a building and it was not unusual for Alice to be home alone a few days at a time.


Update: case#27934-B
5 days later Sunday September 20th 2019
Yesterday was the funeral. Emma was allowed to be there but only for the service. She stuck out like a sore thumb, a small streak of white in a sea of black. She was with a nurse and a tall bulky man all in white and light gray, she herself in a small wheelchair her skin looked waxy and pale, her hair looked thin and dull and there were deep bags under her eyes. But she was still very nice and polite if a bit tired, her mother stood next to her daughter and barely left the girl’s side. It was a group service and very respectful for the tragedy it was, even the owners were there. I learned a day before the funeral,  that the Shaw family had been away on a trip to Europe to see family who lived abroad at the time of the incident. They had chosen to cut their trip short to make it back in time for the funeral after hearing what happened during their absence. During the service I noticed Emma was staring intently at the Shaw family, mostly the youngest member of the family Lisa Shaw.  I am aware that they worked together at the store and her father James Shaw is the owner.  I watched Emma through out the service if she wasn’t Veminously staring down the Shaw’s, she would look over sadly at the 4 caskets that were thankfully closed. Just before the end of the service Emma was handed 4 white roses and slowly placed one on each of the caskets. At Alice’s casket, she touched her fingers to her lips then gently back to the soft polished wood. Her mother walked up behind her and gently rubbed her shoulder and carefully guided her daughter back to her chair where she sobbed quietly into her hands. After it was over I, as well as Emma parents got caught up talking to people, nobody even noticed Emma snaking her way through the crowd until the shouting started. I will do my best not to paraphrase, but it started with Emma shouting at the Shaw’s.  “How dare you!, how dare you show your faces here.!” “Here, of all places.  you don’t get to pretend, you’re sorry!” “You don’t get that!” “This, all of this is your fault.”  Emma’s mother tried to take her arm and pull her on to a bench, but she shook her off and kept going Stepping forward. There was a fire in that voice, and it would not be denied. The Shaw’s looked around nervously and slowly started making their way to the door as Emma advanced “you knew! Didn’t you!?” “About those, those things!” “What they were, what they wanted.” “No. no wonder why you left, no wonder why you didn’t want to be anywhere around when the time came.” They were outside now Emma almost broke into a laughing fit but managed to stop herself. Her mother, the nurse and even I wanted to stop her but she somehow managed to have everyone wedged into the opening of the doorway and nearby windows, everyone wanting to see the drama. Wanting to know. Emma started in again, her body practically vibrating with this pent-up adrenaline. “How many? Huh?” “Just how many others did u feed to those god dammed things huh?” “what it’s ok as long as it isn’t you right!” “They told me everything. Did you know that?” At this point James Shaw started herding his family to the car “Dad?” Lisa chirped up slowly “what is she talking about?” “Nothing sweetie, she’s crazy” James said clearly agitated “Martha let’s go we paid our respects and showed our support, now let’s go.” “They gave it to you!” Emma shouted she was practically screaming now and intermittently giggling taking wobbly steps “Is that why you won’t stop them?” “is that why my friends had to die!? You’re a coward! All of you are!” the Shaw’s were climbing into the car now. “You’re running for mayor next year, right? If I died that night like I was supposed to, you probably would have won too!” the crowd was like I hive of buzzing bees, with all the hushed whispers filling the air. James Shaw flung his car door open and something akin to lightning flashed between him and Emma before James got in his car and sped away down the drive. With a small smirk on her lips Emma triumphantly turned around and sat on the stairs to the small church and waited for the nurse and orderly to whisk her away, which they quickly did. I think I have 3 new people to add to my list now.

He is a good kid and I want to love him like my own kid but it isn’t happening. We are like fighting for my SOs love or something. I don’t understand the invisible beef we have with each other. Everything he does annoys me and I don’t hide it. His dad has been getting mad at me lately because he feels like I’m harder on him than my own son. Which is true because by nature I’m going to have more patients for my own kid. His dad works 4-3 days a week. And on his days off he sleeps in till 11-12 in the afternoon and I have usually been up since 6 with the kids. He then spends his time with his air buds in while sipping his coffee. And then he used to spend two hours at the gym when he decided to get up and go. The last two weeks he changed it up to an hour. He does help with the kids during the day. So what am I so miserable for???! I feel like I’m always home doing nothing but being with kids. I feel like when I moved in with him I got rid of all the stuff I earned and got and worked hard for to move in so he can keep his stuff. He didn’t ask me to but how can I ask him to get rid of his stuff??! Plus I had two cats and he doesn’t like animals. So I gave them to a friend who would keep them together. The only thing I brought over was my bed set and my washer and dryer. That’s all I have to my name…. I don’t have anything else. People stopped coming around me and I don’t work so I don’t talk to anyone. I am depressed with my body. I was 143 before I got pregnant and now I’m 172. I have no clothes that fit me. I am going through a custody battle with my oldest dad and everytime my so says something that bothers him I jump his throat by instantly getting defensive. I hate it. But he says things that make me upset and I’ll get a little hateful. then he will say well instead of saying blah blah you could say blah blah blah. That bothers me for some reason. For some reason every little thing bothers me and I’m feeling so defeated as a partner and mother. It makes me feel like giving up…. I appreciate my partner but I feel like I’m so freaking selfish and I don’t deserve him, his son, my two kids, I don’t deserve my good life. I have everything but yet it isn’t enough. What’s wrong with me???!! ",1,1749670710.0,Mommit,5,0.67,False

1l920hd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1l920hd/19f_im_in_a_longdistance_relationship_and_i_think/,"[19F] I’m in a long-distance relationship, and I think I accidentally messed up a new friendship.","hi everyone this is my first reddit post ever and i rlly never thought i would do this but i kinda just need to vent/need help and advice. my story requires decent context and is a doosey but any thoughts are appreciated. i had originally written it all out but it was very long so i did use chat gbt to shorten it and make more concise. if anyone wants the og version which includes more detail or have questions please let me know.

I’ve been in a committed LDR since I was 17. My boyfriend [20M] left for a two-year LDS mission just 6 months into our relationship. We almost broke up, but after a lot of talks, we decided to stay together—with clear boundaries. We’ve had ups and downs (even a short break), but we’ve stayed strong. We only talk once a week via email, but he’s still my favorite person. I love him deeply, and we plan to stay together after his return in 7 months. I know we are young and it’s crazy but I wouldn’t wanna be with anyone else.

This year I moved to a different state for college (online) and work. It’s been a quiet year socially—I haven’t made many new friends, but I occasionally visit friends elsewhere. I’m naturally touchy and affectionate with everyone, which my boyfriend knows, and I’ve had light flirting here and there, but nothing serious or ever crossing the line—until recently.

Over the weekend, I visited my best friend “Bella” in her city and met two of her guy friends, “Oliver” and “Jack.” I instantly clicked with Oliver—he’s funny, deep, and we had really great banter. He’s not really my type physically, and I didn’t initially sense any flirting. We just vibed in a way I haven’t with someone in a while (as friends).

By the next night, it was clear there was some light flirting on his end. At one point, we were alone, and I told him about my boyfriend. He was respectful, asked a lot of questions, and nothing felt weird. The next day we all hung out again and had more deep talks. I could tell we were building a real connection, even if short-term. Bella later told me she’s never seen Oliver act that way before, and that Jack noticed it too.

That night, during a movie, Oliver and I ended up cuddling. I didn’t stop it. It didn’t go further than that, but I shouldn’t have let it happen. We had a weird convo where I asked what he thought about “us” (I meant it platonically), and he replied, “Well, you do have a boyfriend…” Things shifted after that. He got quiet and distant, and the vibe completely changed. I felt awful and told Bella everything. We ended up leaving soon after.

The next day, Oliver backed out of plans to get coffee and “clear the air.” Jack met up with us instead and gave me some insight—basically, Oliver didn’t want to be the guy who came between a relationship. Later, when I went to get my hoodie from Oliver’s dorm, I pulled him aside to apologize and express that I valued our friendship. He accepted it, but I could tell he was still hurt and not being fully real.

Now I’m home, and I just feel… sad. I miss the connection, even just as a friend. I know I messed up by letting things go too far physically—even if it was minor, it crossed a boundary I had set. I feel like I ruined something that could’ve been a great friendship. I won’t reach out again, but I wish I could. I don’t think he would want to hear from me even if it would be just to send a meme or have a casual conversation.I also just feel guilty for even having confused feelings.

To be clear—I’m 100% committed to my boyfriend. I love him and would never leave him for anyone. I think I just haven’t had close emotional/intellectual chemistry like that with someone new in a long time, especially being apart from my boyfriend for so long. I know Oliver and I would never work romantically, even if I were single, for many reasons. But it still sucks.

I’m not really sure what I’m asking for—just advice, perspective, or reassurance would mean a lot. Thank you for reading.

added in: there is potential of me seeing him again in the future since he is one of bella’s closest friends. he’s not an awkward guy so he wouldn’t be weird. but again i really wish i could reach out to him, i don’t think the friendship is entirely ruined but idk. he has a lot going on and as i learned so much about him so i can’t help but i guess worry about him? i have plenty of long distance friendships as well so it wouldn’t be strange for me but ik boys are different plus idk if he like hates me now or something.

1l91x7k,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1l91x7k/injured/,Injured,"I lost my father on a Wednesday. We’d shared our last coffee that morning near the mountains, where I used to live. Where Fog hung heavy. The silence stayed after he was gone.

Time turned him into memory. I couldn't work or pray. Grief consumed me. My faith in God wavered daily. The void he left behind became unbearable.

I remembered Adrian, an old friend from Brazil who often posted about spiritual healing. He once wrote, “A healer found me after I lost my wife. My pain disappeared. A month later, the 2004 tsunami hit.”
Adrian didn’t choose this path; suffering pushed him into it. 

I meant to contact him for months, but time numbed even that urgency. Until an accident broke my neck and left me temporarily paralyzed. The pain, both physical and emotional, became too much.
When I recovered, I finally reached out. I had also been diagnosed with a terminal illness. 

Adrian invited me to Brazil.

He lived near the Amazon. When I arrived, he looked older.

“You’re late,” he said, puffing a black cigar.
“I need help.”

“You don’t need me,” he replied. **""You need Zimazari.”**

“Who is that?”

“The one who healed me. He doesn’t speak; but you’ll hear him. He doesn’t see; but you’ll feel watched. Walk into the forest. Call his name. He’ll come; naked. He’s shed the world.”

And so I went, The forest listened as I walked a mile deep and called, **“Zimazari!”**
Footsteps answered. 

A tall, thin man emerged. His beard reached his navel, eyes gray and glowing. His long hair fell past his waist, fingernails curled and yellow.
He said nothing, but in my head I heard: Follow me.
We stopped at a black pit, a crater so deep it looked endless.

Zimazari lit a torch, shut his eyes. Mine closed too in unison. He chanted inside my mind in a language I couldn’t recognize. For an hour, the weight in my chest dissolved, like steam rising from old wounds.

Then he threw the torch into the pit and It sealed shut.

Leave this place, I heard.

When I opened my eyes, he was gone. I ran until I saw the sky again.

I returned home feeling reborn.
But a month later, news about a volcanic eruption that killed thousands hit me.

I called Adrian.

“You knew?” I asked.

“Yes,” he said. **“Zimazari sends agony to the Earth’s core. It absorbs the pain. But it always reacts.”**

“You didn’t warn me.”

“You were too far gone. Like I was. The tsunami was my agony's doing.”

“You became a healer to atone.”

“I did what I could. This secret stays with us.”

I felt crushed.

“I can’t live with this.”

“That’s how new agony is born,” he said. “Worse than before.”

That day, I realized time hadn’t betrayed me. I had. Some scars fade. Some dig deeper. And despite the healing, I still remain **injured**.",2,1749670488.0,shortscarystories,0,0.75,False
1l91wxn,https://www.reddit.com/r/VeteransBenefits/comments/1l91wxn/weight_loss/,Weight loss,"Over the last couple of months I’ve lost about 20 pounds. That was OK with me because I’ve been wanting to lose the weight anyway. When I told my psychiatrist this she became quite concerned. She asked me about my appetite and I said well most days I just don’t feel like eating anything and I might have a few cups of coffee. She said you have to be careful because a lot of your weight loss might be coming from loss of muscle mass. Your body is eating your muscles because you’re not eating enough protein. As you can imagine, that was not good news as I have been noticing a loss of strength. 

The background to this is that I’m being treated for depression. The meds have as one of the side effects, a reduction of appetite. That, coupled with the fact that depression often kills your appetite anyway, led me to not eating very much. My psychiatrist added a second antidepressant (which I needed anyway) that has a side effect of increased appetite. So my appetite has come back somewhat, but I still have to consciously make myself eat more. She also put in a consult for a dietitian, and I have a much better idea now how much I have to eat so that I don’t lose any more muscle mass.

So if you’re like me, struggling with depression, and not eating, you need to fix that. My VA team: psychologist, psychiatrist, and dietitian have got me back on the right path. If you’re having the same problems, there is a solution. God bless.",2,1749670473.0,VeteransBenefits,1,1.0,False

Here's a quick rug sizing guide for living rooms to help you get it right, whether you're styling a small space or a spacious setup.

**Large Space Layout (Furniture Floating in the Center)**  
**Recommended rug sizes: 9'x12', 10'x14'**  
If your seating arrangement is in the middle of the room, your rug should be large enough to fit **all furniture pieces fully on top**. This keeps the layout feeling grounded and luxurious, not cramped.

**Along the Wall Layout (Sofa Flush Against a Wall)**  
**Recommended rug sizes: 6'x9', 8'x10'**  
When your furniture lines the walls, make sure **the front legs** of all major pieces sit on the rug. This connects your layout without needing a massive size.

**Small Space or Apartment Layout**  
**Recommended rug sizes: 4'x6', 5'x7'**  
Use a smaller rug just under the coffee table or to **define a seating nook**. It’s a smart way to add structure and warmth without overwhelming the room.

✨ **Pro Tip:** Always measure your space first. Tape off rug dimensions with painter’s tape if you’re unsure, it's the easiest way to visualize your layout before buying. ✨ ",1,1749670172.0,zgallerie,0,1.0,False

Normally its doable, but when I've tried since starting this work (16 months), Ill feel the need to break and have a granola bar or eggs or something because I need fuel to stay awake. Coffee is also tough because unfortunately, I can only tolerate sugary coffee lol typically dirty chai.

Does anyone have tips on best practices for this or whether I should find an alternative to fasting? Im a total novice here, so any advice is appreciated

It's been a few months since going NC with my mother (I'm her only daughter but have two brothers). I'm still in shock it happened, because although I always wanted the distance, I was never brave enough and thought my issues weren't significant enough to stop speaking to her. 

There was a lot of stuff in my childhood - enmeshment, treating me like her therapist, constant verbal abuse, neglect (to the extent I was removed from her care for going to elementary school in the same clothes for days on end with no lunch), manipulation, as well as alcoholism and drug use. After her and my dad divorced (which I don't remember, I was about 2), she tried everything in her power to turn me against him, taught me what STDs were at a young age and told me he had them and slept with prostitutes, she allowed her new husband to treat me as his personal cleaner and snack / coffee maker from aged 8 onwards. She also did this thing where you could never, ever tell her she'd done something wrong because she'd either explode, deny it, become hysterical and cry - and you'd have to make her feel better. I used to visit at weekend from 10 onwards after I was moved to my Dad's home, and her new dog used to urinate all over my bed. Whenever I told her my sheets were covered in dried dog p*ss, she would cry and say how terrible a mum she must be. Eventually I stopped saying anything because I couldn't take the guilt. 

Despite all this, it took me until nearly 40 to stand up for myself. The issue that broke me was fairly trivial in the end, which still causes me to doubt myself. She was upset with me about something minor, and told my husband about it. She asked him not to repeat their conversation to me but to drop hints to me so I would get the picture. Of course he told me everything. I internally exploded and something broke within me. It took a few weeks but I eventually sent a measured, calm text explaining that the attempt to involve my husband felt like manipulation and that it undermined and disrespected me. I was not cruel or aggressive. She sent one reply, making an excuse that she only did it because she didn't want to upset me and saying I should have spoken to her sooner rather than bottling things up. Her message said ""I don't know what else you've decided to keep from me and have bottled up and not resolved, but it seems some things have been taken the wrong way"". 

I sent another calm, measured text saying my feelings were valid and I refused to have the narrative twisted - and that was that. I never heard again. I still doubt myself, all the time. I half wish I'd raised all the childhood stuff so that I had more ""valid"" reasons to have justified finally standing up for myself.

I’m 23, just moved to a new city a couple weeks ago, trying to get my routine together. I’ve been going to this coffee place every morning at like 7:30 because their cold brew basically resuscitates me and also because the barista is kinda hot in a way that makes me feel like he writes angry poems and has a band that only plays in basements.

One morning he goes, “Hey, you’re here a lot. You work nearby?”  
I said, “Nah, not yet. Still looking.”

And then he says, “Wait, you’re not the new hire?”

I don’t know what happened in my brain but I just said, “Oh yeah! Thought you meant somewhere else.”  
It was not a good lie. It didn’t even make sense. But he smiled and was like, “Cool, we’re short today. Mind jumping in?”

And for some reason I just said “Yeah totally,” and started wiping tables. Like I knew what I was doing.  
Like a psychopath.

The worst part is I just... kept going. Every morning. I started wearing better shoes. I learned where the cups are. Someone showed me how to refill the syrups. At one point I handed a customer their drink and she said, “Thanks,” and I said, “You too,” and she hadn’t said anything that made that response make sense but I was already too far in to care.

Then today one of the managers goes, “Hey I added you to payroll, you should see it hit by Friday.”

I have never filled out a form. I never even told them my last name. They just... guessed? I don’t know.

I texted my roommate and she said “you broke into capitalism”

I (33) met a girl (23) this January through salsa dancing. We first connected on social dancing, and like I usually do, I invited her to dance (I didn't have any interest in her at that time). Later, we took salsa classes together and got to know each other better. I felt a strong chemistry when we danced, and eventually, I started to like her.

We began practicing on our own every Friday. On the third Friday, I decided to kiss her. I was nervous because I didn’t know what her intentions were—but fortunately, she liked me too. It turned out that we didn’t just have chemistry on the dance floor; we also connected in terms of our lifestyles and interests.

Everything seemed great at first. She had mentioned that she takes time to open up emotionally, and I was okay with that. We had long conversations, we kissed, and eventually, during a trip, we had sex. This was between February and March. I was falling in love with her.

But after that, things started to change. She began setting boundaries that I didn’t always understand. For example, on one date, I asked if I could have a sip of her drink. She said no, but I took one anyway. She got upset, and I apologized. She eventually let it go. Later, when I brought her home, I tried to kiss her again. She pulled back and told me she doesn't give her love freely, that it takes time for her, and that if I needed affection like that, I should look elsewhere. I told her I respected her decision and would be okay either way.

After that, our ""relationship"" continued—but without kissing or hugging, just sex. Even trying to schedule time together became difficult. I started noticing her pulling away, and I did the same. We went from talking daily to barely speaking at all. First, there was a six-day silence. Then she messaged me about a dance choreography. Ten days later, she asked if I wanted to go for coffee on Monday. We agreed to meet on Wednesday.

But on the day of the meeting, she sent a message:  
**""Hey, I won’t be able to meet you. I’m going to spend my time on other things. I’m sorry.""**  
I never replied. Since then, I’ve only seen her at a social event, and we just danced—no conversations.

1l91aal,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritersOfHorror/comments/1l91aal/cant_look_away/,Can't Look Away,"It started slowly. I didn't realize it had begun until I was already in the middle of it. Like that old wives' tale about the frog and boiling water.

I have a mentally and emotionally draining job. When I get home from work, I usually make myself a quick dinner and settle down in front of the TV to eat and veg out before bed. It may not be the most productive way to spend my evenings, but that was okay with me. I'd never had great aspirations and only a few hobbies which I mostly did on the weekend.

The first time I noticed something had changed, the night started off the same as any other. I sat on the couch, a cold beer in hand, and turned on the TV. Normally, I'm not much of a drinker. I tend to reserve things like that to evenings after a particularly hard day at work, or when I'm out with friends. This evening, the lone beer was much-deserved.

The programs on the TV were easy to follow; the dialogue was accessible and the plotlines comforting in their predictability. I couldn't tell you the names of the shows I watched, who was in them, or what they were about. They all melded together into a sort of white noise. The details brushed against my awareness before sliding off and fading away, only to be immediately forgotten.

The next thing I knew, I was waking up on my couch, fingers wrapped loosely around the neck of my empty beer bottle.

Disoriented, I sat up.

The sounds of my popping and aching joints accompanied the faint sounds of the television still running on the other side of the room. Slowly, I came to realize what had happened. Like I said, I'm not much of a drinker. The combination of the rare beer and the exhaustion from last night's workday must have led me to fall asleep on the couch. I counted myself lucky that I still had time to shower before I had to be back at the office.

I slogged through my shift that day, attributing my low energy to a bad night's sleep. Even after two cups of a coffee and an energy drink, I still felt like I was dragging my feet.

By the time I got home, I was utterly spent. All I wanted to do was eat a quick dinner and hit the sack early.

When I opened the front door, the first thing I noticed was the TV was on.

Okay, weird. But I figured I must have forgotten to turn it off before I left this morning.

Before I could think better of it, I sunk into the couch, my whole body slumping into the plush upholstery. I toed off my shoes and pulled out my phone to order delivery. I was too tired to cook, anyway. While I waited, for my meal to arrive, I decided to watch some TV. It was already on, after all, so why not?

I must have been more tired than I realized, though, because the next morning I found myself waking up on the couch. Again. Take out boxes littered the coffee table, and the TV was still playing in the background.

Frantic, I checked the time and saw that I was almost late for work. I jumped up, swearing. My whole body ached from a second night on the couch. I could tell the only thing propelling me forward was adrenaline.

There was no time to clean up the take out boxes or change my clothes. There was nothing left in the boxes that might attract bugs, so I didn't worry. I could clean them up when I got home later tonight. I made a point to turn off the TV before I left, not wanting to let it run all day again.

During my commute, I was forced to slow down. I take public transit, and didn't have to focus on traffic, only listen for my stop. I fished around in my backpack for some gum. I didn't want to go into the office with my breath smelling like yesterday's take out.

In those moments, I realized that I couldn't remember when my dinner had arrived, or what I'd eaten. I couldn't remember how it tasted, and I definitely didn't remember falling asleep on the couch for the second night in a row. It seemed impossible that I could be so tired from one bad night's sleep that I would forget all that. I wracked my brain, trying to think of an explanation, but I couldn't come up with anything more plausible.

I told myself that after today, I'd at least have the weekend to clean and catch up on sleep. I'd be back on track in no time.

I drudged through the work day, my limbs feeling heavy. My head, by contrast, felt like balloon-like, as if it were floating above my leaden body. I was in such a fog, that I almost didn't clock out with enough time to catch my train home.

When I got there, everything was exactly how I left it. I made myself clear the empty take out boxes, relieved not to find any ant or flies, and sat down on the couch. What I needed was a little TV to wind down and relax before bed.

I turned the TV on.

The comforting blue light of the television was the only light in the room. I hadn't noticed it get do dark. What time was it anyway?

Suddenly, the sound of birds singing outside caught my attention. I looked away from the screen to see dawn's light streaming through the blinds.

I'd been awake, watching TV, the whole night? How was that possible? It was pitch dark outside only seconds ago and it felt as if I had barely sat down...

I choked the whole thing up to fatigue. Maybe what I actually needed was a vacation.

I got up, turned off the TV, and changed out of my work clothes (which I only then realized I was still wearing). Despite the daylight, I needed to sleep. I had to close the blinds so my room would be dark enough for me to do so comfortably. I went into the kitchen to get a drink of water, and had to pass through the living room to get there. Immediately, I noticed the TV was on. I distinctly remembered turning it off, though. I wondered if there was a short in a wire somewhere causing it to turn back on. I decided to call a professional after I got some much-needed sleep.

The remote sat amongst empty take out containers that I could have sworn I'd thrown away. Were they new? Had I ordered another meal I'd forgotten eating?

I reached for the remote, determined to shut the TV off and get some damn rest. I pointed it at the TV, but something about the program that was running piqued my interest.

For the life of me, I couldn't tell you what it was. Not the name of the show, it's content, who was in it, or even what channel it was on. Yet, I felt hypnotized. In that moment, and all the moments to follow, the TV had captured my full attention.

I stood there, remote in hand, and watched.

I ordered more food so I wouldn't have to look away long enough to cook. More take out boxes joined the ones already littering my coffee table and floor. I remember the food being satiating, but nothing else.

I sat and watched and ate and watched and slept and watched and watched and WATCHED.

On Monday, my boss called. I answered the phone without looking away from the TV screen, my fingers fumbling with the touchscreen of my cell. I informed my boss I wouldn't be in that day. I was sick. My voice hardly sounded like my own; it was raspy from thirst and disuse. I can't remember the details of the conversation I had with my boss. I only realized the call had ended when I heard the dial tone after my boss had hung up.

All my focus was in the TV.

The longer I watched, the harder it was to look away. The harder it was to look away, the longer I watched. My eyes burned with the need to blink, but when I tried, I couldn't. I felt the muscles around my eyes constrict as I fought to close my eyes, but they remained wide open.

I. Couldn't. Blink.

Panic thundered through my veins. The indistinct speech on the TV was drowned out by the blood now rushing in my ears. What that fuck was going on?

My vision blurred as my body forced tears into my eyes in an attempt to lubricate them. Despite my indistinct vision, the TV held my gaze like a vice. Even as my eyes pulsed and burned, I continued to stare, unblinking, on the blurry rectangle of light.

I told myself that it would be okay. Eventually, someone would come looking for me. They'd find me here, turn off the TV, and whatever weirdness I'd suddenly found myself in would be over.

I tracked the passage of time by the shifting light in my peripheral vision. Day turned into night then day again. Tuesday!

Around what I thought was midday, someone knocked on my door. I couldn't look away to answer it, but I tried to call out for help. Barely a sound made it past my lips. It was as though all the muscles in my throat had seized up, leaving me unable to do little more than breathe. My phone rang and rang but I couldn't move to answer it. I had hoped that I could feel around for it, and do *something* to break me out of this hell I'd fallen into. But my limbs wouldn't obey me. They sat there, useless, lifeless, and unmoving. Eventually, my voicemail filled up and shortly after, the battery died.

I couldn't look away even to eat, or move to go to the bathroom. All I could do was watch, watch, WATCH.

Another day passed. Maybe two. As little black dots filled my vision, it became harder to tell. Sometimes, it felt like I slept. Or, what passed for sleep now. It was more like...disassociating. Nothing had changed from one moment to the next, yet I had the distinct impression that some time had passed. How much time, I could never tell. Was it hours? Days? Weeks?

Was that someone knocking on my door again? Or was it the TV? Every time I thought I heard something going on outside, the TV grew louder, yet no more distinct. I'm not ashamed to say that, if I could have, I would have cried. By this point, though, it seemed like my body had stopped producing tears. My eyes were like two burning coals, radiating pain through my head and face. And yet, I continued watching the damn TV like nothing was wrong—like I was enjoying another relaxing evening after work. How long had I been like this? Why wasn't anyone coming for me? I had friends, didn't I? Where were they when I needed them most?

I tried to recollect their names and faces, ready to give them an earful when I finally broke free, and couldn't. I couldn't remember a single person who I would consider a real friend. They were co-workers or acquaintances at best. I didn't have any family in town, either, but surely they'd call someone to check on me if they didn't hear from me, right?

They didn't.

What finally saved me was a neighbor. They complained to the superintendent of my TV being too loud for days on end, and a foul smell coming from my apartment. They thought I'd died.

When the police and EMTs found me, I was all but blind. My own refuse had fused me to my couch. All around me was a sea of take-out boxes and half-eaten, rotting food. Despite this, I was severely malnourished. My skin had become paper thin, and my hair and teeth had begun falling out. I only know most of this because of what I heard the doctors say during my ""treatment."" They said I’d suffered a mental break and diagnosed me with extreme burn-out and depression. They placed me in a ward where I could ""recover,"" with the help of a lot of medication and treatments to my eyes. They told me I’d all but lost them from extreme ocular dehydration.

Ultimately, the ward isn’t so bad.

I have a mentally and emotionally draining job. When I get home from work, I usually make myself a quick dinner and settle down in front of the TV to eat and veg out before bed. It may not be the most productive way to spend my evenings, but that was okay with me. I'd never had great aspirations and only a few hobbies which I mostly did on the weekend.

The first time I noticed something had changed, the night started off the same as any other. I sat on the couch, a cold beer in hand, and turned on the TV. Normally, I'm not much of a drinker. I tend to reserve things like that to evenings after a particularly hard day at work, or when I'm out with friends. This evening, the lone beer was much-deserved.

The programs on the TV were easy to follow; the dialogue was accessible and the plotlines comforting in their predictability. I couldn't tell you the names of the shows I watched, who was in them, or what they were about. They all melded together into a sort of white noise. The details brushed against my awareness before sliding off and fading away, only to be immediately forgotten.

The next thing I knew, I was waking up on my couch, fingers wrapped loosely around the neck of my empty beer bottle.

Disoriented, I sat up.

The sounds of my popping and aching joints accompanied the faint sounds of the television still running on the other side of the room. Slowly, I came to realize what had happened. Like I said, I'm not much of a drinker. The combination of the rare beer and the exhaustion from last night's workday must have led me to fall asleep on the couch. I counted myself lucky that I still had time to shower before I had to be back at the office.

Ultimately, the ward isn’t so bad.

While I wasn't able to incorporate every suggestion, I got a lot of useful advice. I'm still in France, but the Paris part of my trip is over and I'm relaxing here in Amboise, so I thought it would be a good time to reflect. 

Day 1:

**The original plan**: Orangerie / Seine river boat /Museum of Paleontology and Comparative Anatomy

**What actually happened**: went to a shop in Le Marais / Orangerie / Seine river boat / strolling through the Jardin des Plantes / Museum of Paleontology and Comparative Anatomy / Quartier Latin and Shakespeare and Company

Landed in Paris on schedule, 7am. Got through security and baggage in a little over an hour. We took the taxi instead of the RER into the city, because we had bags and there were five of us and it seemed worth it.

We stowed our bags at luggage storage and had our first meal of the day at a café nearby. Then we realized one of the stores we wanted to visit was within a walkable distance, so we diverted from the schedule to pay it a quick visit. Then we took the metro to the Orangerie for our 12pm visit. We spent nearly two hours in there. 

We got on the Seine river boat and sailed past Notre Dame and the Eiffel Tower, among other things.

The boat took us to the Jardin des Plantes at around 3:30, which gave us a little bit of time to explore the garden before our scheduled entry into the Museum of Paleontology and Comparative Anatomy, which was the highlight of the day for my cousin the biology major.

After the museum it was about 5:00 so I took a look at the map and saw one store we had planned to visit on another day, so we hopped on the metro and rode it three stops to get there. While the person who wanted to visit the store had a look around, the rest of us waited at a café nearby and had some coffee. 

We walked a few more blocks because we noticed we were near Shakespeare and Company and decided we might as well go. Honestly the most overrated destination. It's a cute indie bookstore with English-language books, but you probably have one of those in every Anglophone city, you don't have to go to Paris to get this selection of books. I got a book that looked interesting, but nothing I couldn't buy online. 

After that, we got our bags back and took an Uber to our accommodations.

Day 2:

**The plan**: The Louvre / The Eiffel Tower

**What actually happened**: showing up late to the Louvre, The Louvre, The Phoenician Scheme/ La Grande Épicerie de Paris, ~~Eiffel Tower~~

This is where our detached style of traveling bites us in the ass because three of us arrived at the Louvre with over an hour to spare and sat in the Tuileries drinking coffee and watching pigeons, but the other two left the apartment earlier but somehow still missed our 9:30 skip-the-line entrance lmaaaao. They ended up waiting for a long time to get in. The three of us who were ON TIME were there for five hours before our stomachs got the better of us and we had to exit and get a late lunch.

The Louvre really *is* too big to explore in a single day. I think we covered most of the painting wing, and a little bit of the sculpture wing. But if you like museums it's honestly worth every second you spend in there. My cousin was talking about how, in smaller museums, you get one or two works of art that hit you like a hydrogen bomb, but the Louvre 
is like a dozen hydrogen bombs per room. 

Then the three of us went to a Pathé cinema to watch Wes Anderson's The Phoenician Scheme. As of time of writing, the movie doesn't have a release date in our country, so it was worth it for us. (Also, sitting in a cinema for two hours is a great way to rest tired feet!) 

After that, we went back to our apartment. Meanwhile, the two who were late to the Louvre got in late and left after two hours and went to La Grande Épicerie de Paris.

We had planned to meet up at the Eiffel Tower, but it rained, so we just went back to the apartment and cooked dinner with some of the stuff the others had bought at the Épicerie. 

Day 3:

**The plan**: Château de Versailles, Le Marais, Sainte-Chapelle

**What actually happened**: Versailles visit, Le Marais, Sainte-Chapelle

I had planned to cut the Versailles visit short to do some shopping in Le Marais, but since we had already gone to two of the shops on Day 1, we took our time with the Versailles gardens and had a late lunch afterwards. My husband and I got back to Paris at around 5pm and the rest of our traveling party stayed behind to go to Marie Antoinette's cottage. 

I had enough time to check out the other shop in the Quartier Latin that I had left on my list. We met up outside the Sainte-Chappelle and lined up to attend the concert, then had dinner. We also postponed the plan to watch the Eiffel Tower light up because it rained again.

Day 4: 

**The plan**: D'Orsay, Giverny 

**What actually happened**: D'Orsay, Giverny, Foire de Vernon

This was the worst-scheduled day of our itinerary because we only had three hours to explore the Orsay, basically from opening time to about 12:30, to give us time to get to the train station. Way too little time. I didn't make it to Gauguin because the signs confused me lol. If I could do it again, I would have allotted more time to the Orsay. 

At around 1pm we caught our train to Vernon-Giverny, then took the shuttle, and arrived about 45 minutes before our timed entry. We got in at 4:30 and Monet's house closed at 6pm. 

honestly 1h30m was enough time for just the house and gardens, but we didn't have time for the impressionists museum or the town of Giverny itself. If I had enough time I would split these two things into different days, but on the other hand it was also pretty cool seeing Monet's work in the Orsay and then a few hours later seeing the beautiful garden that had inspired it. 

After Monet's house closed we took the shuttle back to Vernon, where completely by chance we discovered that there was a local fair going on, so we bought some beer and food from the vendors before getting on our train back to Paris. 

Day 5:

**The plan**: Notre Dame, Dior Museum

**What actually happened**: Notre Dame, Eugene Delacroix Museum, Quartier Latin, Dior Museum / Père Lachaise Cemetery, Eiffel Tower/sick day

My cousin and I got up early to attend mass at Notre Dame. My family is culturally Catholic but we're not very observant, so we were debating whether or not to go to mass or just wait in the visitor line, but the mass line was shorter than the visitor line so we decided to just attend. Honestly a pretty incredible experience. We don't understand French but we know the tempo of a typical Catholic mass pretty well. 

After mass, my cousin and I walked into the Quartier Latin and ate breakfast at a kebab shop. I was wondering what else to do or whether to just return to the apartment to rest, but I realized that the Eugene Delacroix Museum was

 (1) nearby-ish and

 (2) miraculously, open on a Monday,

 so we decided to go. While walking to the metro we we were distracted by a bookstore dedicated to books about cinema called Le Macguffin (what a great name) and spent an hour there. 

Then we made it to the Eugene Delacroix Museum, which is small, but also free if you have been to the Louvre the same day or the previous day. Unfortunately, our trip to the Louvre was more than a day ago so we had to pay full price. I think it was still worth the price of entry, though. 

My cousin and I parted ways; she went to the Dior museum with her sister and I went to Père Lachaise Cemetery. 

Meanwhile, my husband wasn't feeling well so he decided to stay in the apartment instead of catching up with me at Père Lachaise. We had already paid for tickets for a tour of Père Lachaise Cemetery that were non-refundable, but no big deal — I went alone. 

The only other people on the tour were an American woman and her son. Halfway through the tour the woman, who had recently had knee surgery, decided she could not continue with the tour, so she and her son left and I basically got a private tour for the rest of the time. I had an incredible guide, I got to see all the graves I wanted to see and I learned a lot about the cemetery's other inhabitants. 

My favorite moment of the trip happened here: we ran into a man who was leaving flowers at the grave of Miguel Ángel de Asturias, Guatemalan winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature. The day we visited was the day of his death anniversary and the man leaving flowers very kindly told us all about the grave, including info even the tour guide didn't know.

After this tour, I stayed a while to look at some more graves and then took the metro back to the apartment, where my poor husband had been all day. The two of us just got food and had a early night in, meanwhile the other three went to the Champs-Élysées and (finally) to the Eiffel Tower to see it light up.


Day 6: we took an Uber from the apartment to Paris-Montparnasse then took the TGV and TER to Amboise. 


We are now still in Amboise, Day 7, gorging ourselves on wine and cheese.

What I would have done differently:

**Not enough time in the Orsay**

Explained above! 

**Metro-related things**

Okay the Metro was kind of stressful. I tried to load tickets on my phone but it wouldn't work. So we got Navigo passes but the Navigo Easy pass is nothing but easy. I would put the card to the back of the phone and it would try to read it like five times in a row before it finally realized it was a Navigo card. 

In hindsight, it probably would have been better, in terms of convenience, to buy the Navigo pass that allowed unlimited travel for [X] days, but I was thinking too much about the cost of buying metro tickets individually versus using the unlimited pass. I didn't factor in the convenience of the unlimited pass, which, in hindsight, is totally worth the extra cost. 

What I would have done the same despite advice to the contrary:

**Staying in the outskirts**

I didn't mention this in the other post but technically our apartment wasn't in Paris. It was in Clamart which is a southwest suburb of Paris, and it saved us money. 

Getting to the major tourist destinations took a little more time, but I feel the same way about like, Seoul or Tokyo or Singapore: when you go to a city with a robust and functional metro system it doesn't *really* matter that much where you stay as long as it's near a station. 

**planning/overplanning**

There were so many times when

*  I was glad that I had looked something up online before I tried it

*  I was glad that I booked tickets well in advance instead of lining up for ages

*  I was glad that I measured how long the train/metro/bus ride from Point A to Point B would take and budgeted my time accordingly, so I never had to hurry to make a connection

Conclusion: 

Beautiful city, wonderful trip! I'm bone tired after Paris, but that's what the four days in Amboise is for lol. Merci beaucoup!! ",7,1749668788.0,ParisTravelGuide,0,0.89,False

1l91717,https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/1l91717/cant_look_away/,Can't Look Away,"It started slowly. I didn't realize it had begun until I was already in the middle of it. Like that old wives' tale about the frog and boiling water.

I have a mentally and emotionally draining job. When I get home from work, I usually make myself a quick dinner and settle down in front of the TV to eat and veg out before bed. It may not be the most productive way to spend my evenings, but that was okay with me. I'd never had great aspirations and only a few hobbies which I mostly did on the weekend.

The first time I noticed something had changed, the night started off the same as any other. I sat on the couch, a cold beer in hand, and turned on the TV. Normally, I'm not much of a drinker. I tend to reserve things like that to evenings after a particularly hard day at work, or when I'm out with friends. This evening, the lone beer was much-deserved.

The programs on the TV were easy to follow; the dialogue was accessible and the plotlines comforting in their predictability. I couldn't tell you the names of the shows I watched, who was in them, or what they were about. They all melded together into a sort of white noise. The details brushed against my awareness before sliding off and fading away, only to be immediately forgotten.

The next thing I knew, I was waking up on my couch, fingers wrapped loosely around the neck of my empty beer bottle.

Disoriented, I sat up.

The sounds of my popping and aching joints accompanied the faint sounds of the television still running on the other side of the room. Slowly, I came to realize what had happened. Like I said, I'm not much of a drinker. The combination of the rare beer and the exhaustion from last night's workday must have led me to fall asleep on the couch. I counted myself lucky that I still had time to shower before I had to be back at the office.

I slogged through my shift that day, attributing my low energy to a bad night's sleep. Even after two cups of a coffee and an energy drink, I still felt like I was dragging my feet.

By the time I got home, I was utterly spent. All I wanted to do was eat a quick dinner and hit the sack early.

When I opened the front door, the first thing I noticed was the TV was on.

Okay, weird. But I figured I must have forgotten to turn it off before I left this morning.

Before I could think better of it, I sunk into the couch, my whole body slumping into the plush upholstery. I toed off my shoes and pulled out my phone to order delivery. I was too tired to cook, anyway. While I waited, for my meal to arrive, I decided to watch some TV. It was already on, after all, so why not?

I must have been more tired than I realized, though, because the next morning I found myself waking up on the couch. Again. Take out boxes littered the coffee table, and the TV was still playing in the background.

Frantic, I checked the time and saw that I was almost late for work. I jumped up, swearing. My whole body ached from a second night on the couch. I could tell the only thing propelling me forward was adrenaline.

There was no time to clean up the take out boxes or change my clothes. There was nothing left in the boxes that might attract bugs, so I didn't worry. I could clean them up when I got home later tonight. I made a point to turn off the TV before I left, not wanting to let it run all day again.

During my commute, I was forced to slow down. I take public transit, and didn't have to focus on traffic, only listen for my stop. I fished around in my backpack for some gum. I didn't want to go into the office with my breath smelling like yesterday's take out.

In those moments, I realized that I couldn't remember when my dinner had arrived, or what I'd eaten. I couldn't remember how it tasted, and I definitely didn't remember falling asleep on the couch for the second night in a row. It seemed impossible that I could be so tired from one bad night's sleep that I would forget all that. I wracked my brain, trying to think of an explanation, but I couldn't come up with anything more plausible.

I told myself that after today, I'd at least have the weekend to clean and catch up on sleep. I'd be back on track in no time.

I drudged through the work day, my limbs feeling heavy. My head, by contrast, felt like balloon-like, as if it were floating above my leaden body. I was in such a fog, that I almost didn't clock out with enough time to catch my train home.

When I got there, everything was exactly how I left it. I made myself clear the empty take out boxes, relieved not to find any ant or flies, and sat down on the couch. What I needed was a little TV to wind down and relax before bed.

I turned the TV on.

The comforting blue light of the television was the only light in the room. I hadn't noticed it get do dark. What time was it anyway?

Suddenly, the sound of birds singing outside caught my attention. I looked away from the screen to see dawn's light streaming through the blinds.

I'd been awake, watching TV, the whole night? How was that possible? It was pitch dark outside only seconds ago and it felt as if I had barely sat down...

I choked the whole thing up to fatigue. Maybe what I actually needed was a vacation.

I got up, turned off the TV, and changed out of my work clothes (which I only then realized I was still wearing). Despite the daylight, I needed to sleep. I had to close the blinds so my room would be dark enough for me to do so comfortably. I went into the kitchen to get a drink of water, and had to pass through the living room to get there. Immediately, I noticed the TV was on. I distinctly remembered turning it off, though. I wondered if there was a short in a wire somewhere causing it to turn back on. I decided to call a professional after I got some much-needed sleep.

The remote sat amongst empty take out containers that I could have sworn I'd thrown away. Were they new? Had I ordered another meal I'd forgotten eating?

I reached for the remote, determined to shut the TV off and get some damn rest. I pointed it at the TV, but something about the program that was running piqued my interest.

For the life of me, I couldn't tell you what it was. Not the name of the show, it's content, who was in it, or even what channel it was on. Yet, I felt hypnotized. In that moment, and all the moments to follow, the TV had captured my full attention.

I stood there, remote in hand, and watched.

I ordered more food so I wouldn't have to look away long enough to cook. More take out boxes joined the ones already littering my coffee table and floor. I remember the food being satiating, but nothing else.

I sat and watched and ate and watched and slept and watched and watched and WATCHED.

On Monday, my boss called. I answered the phone without looking away from the TV screen, my fingers fumbling with the touchscreen of my cell. I informed my boss I wouldn't be in that day. I was sick. My voice hardly sounded like my own; it was raspy from thirst and disuse. I can't remember the details of the conversation I had with my boss. I only realized the call had ended when I heard the dial tone after my boss had hung up.

All my focus was in the TV.

The longer I watched, the harder it was to look away. The harder it was to look away, the longer I watched. My eyes burned with the need to blink, but when I tried, I couldn't. I felt the muscles around my eyes constrict as I fought to close my eyes, but they remained wide open.

I. Couldn't. Blink.

Panic thundered through my veins. The indistinct speech on the TV was drowned out by the blood now rushing in my ears. What that fuck was going on?

My vision blurred as my body forced tears into my eyes in an attempt to lubricate them. Despite my indistinct vision, the TV held my gaze like a vice. Even as my eyes pulsed and burned, I continued to stare, unblinking, on the blurry rectangle of light.

I told myself that it would be okay. Eventually, someone would come looking for me. They'd find me here, turn off the TV, and whatever weirdness I'd suddenly found myself in would be over.

I tracked the passage of time by the shifting light in my peripheral vision. Day turned into night then day again. Tuesday!

Around what I thought was midday, someone knocked on my door. I couldn't look away to answer it, but I tried to call out for help. Barely a sound made it past my lips. It was as though all the muscles in my throat had seized up, leaving me unable to do little more than breathe. My phone rang and rang but I couldn't move to answer it. I had hoped that I could feel around for it, and do *something* to break me out of this hell I'd fallen into. But my limbs wouldn't obey me. They sat there, useless, lifeless, and unmoving. Eventually, my voicemail filled up and shortly after, the battery died.

I couldn't look away even to eat, or move to go to the bathroom. All I could do was watch, watch, WATCH.

Another day passed. Maybe two. As little black dots filled my vision, it became harder to tell. Sometimes, it felt like I slept. Or, what passed for sleep now. It was more like...disassociating. Nothing had changed from one moment to the next, yet I had the distinct impression that some time had passed. How much time, I could never tell. Was it hours? Days? Weeks?

Was that someone knocking on my door again? Or was it the TV? Every time I thought I heard something going on outside, the TV grew louder, yet no more distinct. I'm not ashamed to say that, if I could have, I would have cried. By this point, though, it seemed like my body had stopped producing tears. My eyes were like two burning coals, radiating pain through my head and face. And yet, I continued watching the damn TV like nothing was wrong—like I was enjoying another relaxing evening after work. How long had I been like this? Why wasn't anyone coming for me? I had friends, didn't I? Where were they when I needed them most?

I tried to recollect their names and faces, ready to give them an earful when I finally broke free, and couldn't. I couldn't remember a single person who I would consider a real friend. They were co-workers or acquaintances at best. I didn't have any family in town, either, but surely they'd call someone to check on me if they didn't hear from me, right?

They didn't.

What finally saved me was a neighbor. They complained to the superintendent of my TV being too loud for days on end, and a foul smell coming from my apartment. They thought I'd died.

When the police and EMTs found me, I was all but blind. My own refuse had fused me to my couch. All around me was a sea of take-out boxes and half-eaten, rotting food. Despite this, I was severely malnourished. My skin had become paper thin, and my hair and teeth had begun falling out.

Ultimately, the ward isn’t so bad.

Undoubtedly a fragrance i'd wear on my wedding day. However for reasons more to do with the Indian weather, i haven't yet committed to a full bottle. This is my second purchase of a 10ml decant in a second consecutive year. Sub 15 degree days are few and far between where i live but on those rare ocassions, this heady concoction of toffee, caramel and coffee liqueur leaves a heavenly trail in its wake.

As someone that spent a not insignificant length of time in the Middle East, i can confidently tell you what Lattafa had on their mood board the day they conceived Raghba Wood Intense: A classy older man, wearing a Patek on his wrist & the poorly concealed outline of his Bentley Flying Spur keys peeping out of his starched white Kandura. Raghba is acrid, balsamic & warm. Allegedly there's vanilla too but it is overwhelmed by a nuclear fallout of dry incense and woods. The quality offered here is at complete odds with the price. Fill up the same juice in a minimalist glass decant like the one pictured here and it very well may warrant 5x the price. In typical Lattafa fashion though, the actual bottle is hideously tacky. My 30 ml decant looks orders of magnitude more desirable and for that i have to thank....

(TR: DV, SA, trauma)","So I have been dating my partner for 2 years, just recently gotten engaged. Since the beginning of our relationship, his parents and oldest sister have hated me. Accused me of being abusive, devil worshipper etc. (I teased him and I am a pagan.) This is my first healthy relationship since I was able to leave a DV situation 2.5 years ago. 
He has been such a sweet, open minded person ever since I met him. He brought me to meet this mom (they work a coffee shop) but I didn't get the opportunity to change my clothes so I was wearing a cropped hoodie with a bat on it and shorts (like hoochie shorts). She told my partner to dump me, that I will be terrible to him etc. Then after a dinner with two of his 3 sisters, the eldest accused me of being abusive. 

Every now and again, he will bring me around but it feels so fake and disingenuous. We are currently planning an engagement party and he wants his parents and eldest sister to come. With the previous history and some other things that have happened, I don't want them there. I have nightmares, panic attacks etc thinking about them being there. I have been spiraling so bad that I am afraid to argue with him because I continue to think that I am an abusive monster because I am arguing with him. I just don't know what to do to not be this anxious. I have tried all my coping mechanisms. I've reached binge cleaning my entire apartment and myself because I can't stop feeling dirty (I do have history of SA trauma).

1l914p1,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_zellfan/comments/1l914p1/cant_look_away/,Can't Look Away,"It started slowly. I didn't realize it had begun until I was already in the middle of it. Like that old wives' tale about the frog and boiling water.

I have a mentally and emotionally draining job. When I get home from work, I usually make myself a quick dinner and settle down in front of the TV to eat and veg out before bed. It may not be the most productive way to spend my evenings, but that was okay with me. I'd never had great aspirations and only a few hobbies which I mostly did on the weekend.

The first time I noticed something had changed, the night started off the same as any other. I sat on the couch, a cold beer in hand, and turned on the TV. Normally, I'm not much of a drinker. I tend to reserve things like that to evenings after a particularly hard day at work, or when I'm out with friends. This evening, the lone beer was much-deserved.

The programs on the TV were easy to follow; the dialogue was accessible and the plotlines comforting in their predictability. I couldn't tell you the names of the shows I watched, who was in them, or what they were about. They all melded together into a sort of white noise. The details brushed against my awareness before sliding off and fading away, only to be immediately forgotten.

The next thing I knew, I was waking up on my couch, fingers wrapped loosely around the neck of my empty beer bottle.

Disoriented, I sat up.

The sounds of my popping and aching joints accompanied the faint sounds of the television still running on the other side of the room. Slowly, I came to realize what had happened. Like I said, I'm not much of a drinker. The combination of the rare beer and the exhaustion from last night's workday must have led me to fall asleep on the couch. I counted myself lucky that I still had time to shower before I had to be back at the office.

I slogged through my shift that day, attributing my low energy to a bad night's sleep. Even after two cups of a coffee and an energy drink, I still felt like I was dragging my feet.

By the time I got home, I was utterly spent. All I wanted to do was eat a quick dinner and hit the sack early.

When I opened the front door, the first thing I noticed was the TV was on.

Okay, weird. But I figured I must have forgotten to turn it off before I left this morning.

Before I could think better of it, I sunk into the couch, my whole body slumping into the plush upholstery. I toed off my shoes and pulled out my phone to order delivery. I was too tired to cook, anyway. While I waited, for my meal to arrive, I decided to watch some TV. It was already on, after all, so why not?

I must have been more tired than I realized, though, because the next morning I found myself waking up on the couch. Again. Take out boxes littered the coffee table, and the TV was still playing in the background.

Frantic, I checked the time and saw that I was almost late for work. I jumped up, swearing. My whole body ached from a second night on the couch. I could tell the only thing propelling me forward was adrenaline.

There was no time to clean up the take out boxes or change my clothes. There was nothing left in the boxes that might attract bugs, so I didn't worry. I could clean them up when I got home later tonight. I made a point to turn off the TV before I left, not wanting to let it run all day again.

During my commute, I was forced to slow down. I take public transit, and didn't have to focus on traffic, only listen for my stop. I fished around in my backpack for some gum. I didn't want to go into the office with my breath smelling like yesterday's take out.

In those moments, I realized that I couldn't remember when my dinner had arrived, or what I'd eaten. I couldn't remember how it tasted, and I definitely didn't remember falling asleep on the couch for the second night in a row. It seemed impossible that I could be so tired from one bad night's sleep that I would forget all that. I wracked my brain, trying to think of an explanation, but I couldn't come up with anything more plausible.

I told myself that after today, I'd at least have the weekend to clean and catch up on sleep. I'd be back on track in no time.

I drudged through the work day, my limbs feeling heavy. My head, by contrast, felt like balloon-like, as if it were floating above my leaden body. I was in such a fog, that I almost didn't clock out with enough time to catch my train home.

When I got there, everything was exactly how I left it. I made myself clear the empty take out boxes, relieved not to find any ant or flies, and sat down on the couch. What I needed was a little TV to wind down and relax before bed.

I turned the TV on.

The comforting blue light of the television was the only light in the room. I hadn't noticed it get do dark. What time was it anyway?

Suddenly, the sound of birds singing outside caught my attention. I looked away from the screen to see dawn's light streaming through the blinds.

I'd been awake, watching TV, the whole night? How was that possible? It was pitch dark outside only seconds ago and it felt as if I had barely sat down...

I choked the whole thing up to fatigue. Maybe what I actually needed was a vacation.

I got up, turned off the TV, and changed out of my work clothes (which I only then realized I was still wearing). Despite the daylight, I needed to sleep. I had to close the blinds so my room would be dark enough for me to do so comfortably. I went into the kitchen to get a drink of water, and had to pass through the living room to get there. Immediately, I noticed the TV was on. I distinctly remembered turning it off, though. I wondered if there was a short in a wire somewhere causing it to turn back on. I decided to call a professional after I got some much-needed sleep.

The remote sat amongst empty take out containers that I could have sworn I'd thrown away. Were they new? Had I ordered another meal I'd forgotten eating?

I reached for the remote, determined to shut the TV off and get some damn rest. I pointed it at the TV, but something about the program that was running piqued my interest.

For the life of me, I couldn't tell you what it was. Not the name of the show, it's content, who was in it, or even what channel it was on. Yet, I felt hypnotized. In that moment, and all the moments to follow, the TV had captured my full attention.

I stood there, remote in hand, and watched.

I ordered more food so I wouldn't have to look away long enough to cook. More take out boxes joined the ones already littering my coffee table and floor. I remember the food being satiating, but nothing else.

I sat and watched and ate and watched and slept and watched and watched and WATCHED.

On Monday, my boss called. I answered the phone without looking away from the TV screen, my fingers fumbling with the touchscreen of my cell. I informed my boss I wouldn't be in that day. I was sick. My voice hardly sounded like my own; it was raspy from thirst and disuse. I can't remember the details of the conversation I had with my boss. I only realized the call had ended when I heard the dial tone after my boss had hung up.

All my focus was in the TV.

The longer I watched, the harder it was to look away. The harder it was to look away, the longer I watched. My eyes burned with the need to blink, but when I tried, I couldn't. I felt the muscles around my eyes constrict as I fought to close my eyes, but they remained wide open.

I. Couldn't. Blink.

Panic thundered through my veins. The indistinct speech on the TV was drowned out by the blood now rushing in my ears. What that fuck was going on?

My vision blurred as my body forced tears into my eyes in an attempt to lubricate them. Despite my indistinct vision, the TV held my gaze like a vice. Even as my eyes pulsed and burned, I continued to stare, unblinking, on the blurry rectangle of light.

I told myself that it would be okay. Eventually, someone would come looking for me. They'd find me here, turn off the TV, and whatever weirdness I'd suddenly found myself in would be over.

I tracked the passage of time by the shifting light in my peripheral vision. Day turned into night then day again. Tuesday!

Around what I thought was midday, someone knocked on my door. I couldn't look away to answer it, but I tried to call out for help. Barely a sound made it past my lips. It was as though all the muscles in my throat had seized up, leaving me unable to do little more than breathe. My phone rang and rang but I couldn't move to answer it. I had hoped that I could feel around for it, and do *something* to break me out of this hell I'd fallen into. But my limbs wouldn't obey me. They sat there, useless, lifeless, and unmoving. Eventually, my voicemail filled up and shortly after, the battery died.

I couldn't look away even to eat, or move to go to the bathroom. All I could do was watch, watch, WATCH.

Another day passed. Maybe two. As little black dots filled my vision, it became harder to tell. Sometimes, it felt like I slept. Or, what passed for sleep now. It was more like...disassociating. Nothing had changed from one moment to the next, yet I had the distinct impression that some time had passed. How much time, I could never tell. Was it hours? Days? Weeks?

Was that someone knocking on my door again? Or was it the TV? Every time I thought I heard something going on outside, the TV grew louder, yet no more distinct. I'm not ashamed to say that, if I could have, I would have cried. By this point, though, it seemed like my body had stopped producing tears. My eyes were like two burning coals, radiating pain through my head and face. And yet, I continued watching the damn TV like nothing was wrong—like I was enjoying another relaxing evening after work. How long had I been like this? Why wasn't anyone coming for me? I had friends, didn't I? Where were they when I needed them most?

I tried to recollect their names and faces, ready to give them an earful when I finally broke free, and couldn't. I couldn't remember a single person who I would consider a real friend. They were co-workers or acquaintances at best. I didn't have any family in town, either, but surely they'd call someone to check on me if they didn't hear from me, right?

They didn't.

What finally saved me was a neighbor. They complained to the superintendent of my TV being too loud for days on end, and a foul smell coming from my apartment. They thought I'd died.

When the police and EMTs found me, I was all but blind. My own refuse had fused me to my couch. All around me was a sea of take-out boxes and half-eaten, rotting food. Despite this, I was severely malnourished. My skin had become paper thin, and my hair and teeth had begun falling out. I only know most of this because of what I heard the doctors say during my ""treatment."" They said I’d suffered a mental break and diagnosed me with extreme burn-out and depression. They placed me in a ward where I could ""recover,"" with the help of a lot of medication and treatments to my eyes. They told me I’d all but lost them from extreme ocular dehydration.

Ultimately, the ward isn’t so bad.

I get to eat, sleep, and at least I'm not alone.

This is driving me absolutely insane

I've been working with B2B companies for 8+ years and I see this pattern everywhere. Doesn't matter if it's software, consulting, manufacturing, whatever

Great companies with better products and better prices losing deals to inferior competitors

Last month I'm talking to this founder and he goes ""I don't get it. We had the best proposal, best price, perfect fit. Customer went with competitor and their solution is garbage

So I ask ""When's the last time you talked to them before the RFP?""

""Uh maybe 6 months ago? When we finished their last project""

There's your problem.

While he was radio silent for 6 months, the competitor was having coffee with the customer every month. Sending industry reports, making introductions and staying top of mind

When buying time came, guess who felt like the trusted partner?I see this constantly that companies think good work sells itself it doesn't.

The pattern is always to deliver great project,send final invoice and wonder why customer doesn't call them first

Meanwhile competitors are doing monthly check-ins not selling anything, just staying in touch,sharing relevant industry insights, making valuable introductions and being present when new needs emerge.  
Whenever i implement this approach with clients they see that increase in sales instantly.

The math is brutal it costs 5-10x more to acquire new customers than keep existing ones engaged. Yet everyone spends 90% of their time chasing new prospects.

Your best customers are also your competitors' best prospects. If you're not staying in their world, someone else will be.

I've watched companies lose $50K deals because a competitor sent better holiday cards not joking.

B2B buying is emotional, people buy from who they trust and remember. If you vanish after delivery, you become a vendor but if you stay engaged, you become a partner.

1l90xnp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenRelationships/comments/1l90xnp/is_he_uninterested_or_going_through_things/,Is he uninterested or going through things?,"I was dating a guy for a month before he found out he was moving states. Ironically I already had a trip planned to the city he was moving to a month later (which was this past week).

To give some back story me and this guy are not in a relationship but we've only ever had an amazing time together. We get along so well and have never argued or had any major disagreements. Our bedroom life has been nothing short of amazing thus far and he would get turned on just from hugging me. We are very affectionate, cuddly etc. all the things and we've both always stuck to our words which is something I deeply appreciate about him.

Before I went on the trip we hadn't talked a ton, and he did tell me he was having financial difficulties from the move and that he had been going through a rough patch. Neither of us are big texters and we've had extensive conversations about our disdain for texting so this didn't really raise any alarms for me.

Anyways, I visit him this last weekend and he's not acting super excited to see me like he usually does which wasn't a big deal. But then we were hanging out and having a great time from my perspective, we went to the riverwalk at night and I met his sisters and we hung out for hours. In the morning he took me to get coffee & breakfast and we sat He ate it by the beach it was so cute. He was still cuddly and kissing me like usual but he couldn't get it up when we tried to do the do which is the first time that's happened. Even when I went down on him, which he usually loves, he couldn't.

It's not a problem because I'm not there for only the physical, but the flags were raised for me when he said he'd definitely make time to see me again before I left the state and then I didn't hear from him. I expressed that it upset me that I'd gotten my hopes up that I would see him again before I left, and he replied that I had every right to be upset and that he was waiting on a piece of info that affected his financial situation and had lost track of time and then basically he was too exhausted to make plans. Then he said he could've communicated better but avoided it out of feeling guilty.

So I guess my question is, do you think it's reasonable to assume all this is arising out of his current life stressors and that he is still interested? Or is he just trying to be nice to spare my feelings of him losing interest? We both have ADHD so I can be somewhat sensitive to rejection/perceived rejection. And I don't want to stress him out more with this if it is just coming from my overthinking.

I just miss him and care about him deeply so I want the best for him! But I've also had the tendency to overcompensate stemming from my own anxieties in the past so I don't want to do that here if he isn't really interested anymore.

… Let's start this one differently; let me give it another shot. After all, these are supposed to be cathartic entries for me and entertaining for you. 

Setu's rendition of the symbol had me scouring the web like a maniac for at least two days, and what I found didn't instill confidence either. The most I could gather was that it was the symbol of a fallen God, a forgotten God barely mentioned in the dark corners of forums, belonging to threads I posted that would either get archived or deleted within hours. But for those few hours, while the thread was up, I would get comments that would tell me —

*Looks bad*

*Nice try Edgelord*

*What, are we letting anyone post random things now?*

*That's sacrilege, you know how offensive that is? Istg, people will twist and turn holy symbols just to get a reaction. You want me to turn the cross sideways and then turn it into a crude Swastika?*

*The last we entertained such a thread, it turned out to be a 13-year-old who had just found his dad's old Victorian horror stories*.

But then, one comment offered me hope.

*Idk dude but if you're serious about this, everything looks wrong, it looks upside down, looks mirrored, the serpent encircling it is moving in the opposite direction….This doesn't represent eternity…it represents eternal torment…and the symbol…Idk who it is…but whoever it is, has either fallen, is doomed, or once betrayed wherever it came from*

\- 

I remember the first two comments because they would always show up, I remember the third one clearly because that's what told me that this was symbolic and holy to someone at the least. The fourth one I remember because it had sent me down a rabbit hole of someone who was suffering the same fate as me a few months ago, albeit fictionally. The kid had ended the 6-month long thread with a photo of the monster that stalked him at night…the link to the photo Rick Rolled everyone invested. 

I still chuckle about it as I write this…the last one…the last one stuck with me, sticks with me because I would soon come to find out that some random stranger on the internet had tried to warn me of what I was getting into, but every protest against my desire to visit the island, every obstacle, every statistical or logistical problem only brought out the worst in me. 

I had ignored this comment thinking that someone was simply trolling me, trying to scare me even more than I was. I had also decided to lie to Setu, falsely promising his identity would be protected. Because after the interviews, after the symbol, after its potential meaning being unveiled, the pit in my stomach had grown to a gargantuan size. It had swallowed my morals, had twisted my intents and had put out a shoddy copy of my identity that I stupidly took as my own. I know people often say that if they could go back in time, they would stop their former selves….they would stop themselves before it was too late ….I wouldn't. I wouldn't dare even try…

I had lied to Setu, I had lied to Bala that the terms had changed after Carl and the rest had seen the footage, I had lied to Carl that there was even going to be a documentary to show in the first place…and I had lied to Mr. Sastry by handing over $15,000 and promising the rest once I had wrapped up the project. Faking a contract was easy; averting his gaze as his adopted son fell deeper into the web of my lies was even easier… 

I had become this vile chameleon that would instantly adapt to scenarios to get what it wanted. Back then, I had thought of myself as a hero …a hero saving Setu, a hero helping him find his origins, a hero doing what the world should've done long ago… a visionary on the frontier of the unexplored… but now I know, I was a fool barking and gnawing at the trust of my people and dragging them to the edge of the world and into the maw of something that would one day eventually change the meaning of ….creation. 

And so, assuming that nobody would understand me, nobody would understand my burden, I began to sow seeds of mistrust and curiosity that would eventually lead me where I had always wanted to go. Setu was, by all means, a stalwart man, but I had also gained his trust; I had become a confidant he never knew he needed. Years ago, he had tried to learn more about his past but was always shut down by his parents; he had always tried to look more into it, but they had always averted his curiosity. But now, as an outsider, I could exploit that, and before you knew it, he was itching to learn more about his past, just like I had planned. 

Bala however, was another story, he had grown to resent me, our friendly banter had ended the day the ""documentary"" was approved and funded. I had paid him in full, and maybe he found that disrespectful, but in hindsight, he was probably onto me. Bala had stuck around for a week as I prodded Setu and the Sastry family for minute details. But then out of the blue, he had come to my room one morning and had quit. 

""I need a change of pace, I need a taste of normality, I am going back to Chennai""

""Sure… Wait… is something wrong? I know we haven't exactly been talking lately but you know I think of you as a friend Bala….right?""

I still remember him staring into my eyes then… If I was me, I would've known what that stare meant, but I wasn't and so I didn't. 

""Goodbye Phillip. Maybe we'll see each other again soon…""

I nodded, handed Bala some extra cash, and watched him drive away. By then I had learned my way around the culture better, I had bought myself a used car, had learned how to deal with swindlers, and most importantly, had found my preference when it came to food. And then one fateful night, while I was exhaling clouds of cancer, lost in the thoughts of how to take my machinations a step further, there was a knock on my room's door… It was Setu. I had welcomed him in, and when Setu spoke… I knew the seeds I had planted had finally sprouted…

""Do you really think there are more out there Phillip?""

""I don't know man… you're a miracle to be honest, finding another miracle in this lifetime seems like a heavy dose of optimism even for me…""

""I am starting to believe that you might be right…""

Part of me wanted to jump and probe Setu further, but by then I had become this evil chef of spiced lies and so I waited with bated breath as I let Setu cook… He took his sweet time, but eventually continued much to my sadistic pleasure…

""I …remember what I told you what I thought about my parents?""

I nodded and sighed, playing my part of a trusted confidant and friend to perfection. Setu always had strong feelings about his biological parents. He didn't hate them, but to him, there was an unknown fear and trepidation associated with them. He had hinted at this when I had initially started to peel his layers, but over the past two weeks, he had revealed how he truly felt. As far as I had gathered, Setu had repressed memories and buried feelings. Whenever he thought about them, he felt fear, dread, he got uneasy and twitchy but as I would come to know through this conversation, he had finally managed to peel away a layer that I had failed to pierce despite my desperation. 

""I wonder if she would recognize me… I wonder if he would…would they regret or rejoice if they ever knew that I was still alive? They'd probably shun me though…considering how protective the tribe is when it comes to interactions with the mainland""

I simply nodded and continued my stoic impersonation of someone actively listening to a friend. In reality, I was struggling to ignore the itch under my skin to push Setu towards my ultimate goal. 

""Do you remember them? Their faces, the island, anything?""

He shook his head, ""No… no, just my gut screaming at me, my mind searching for memories that should be there but aren't…""

I knew I had to stall this, and so I allowed silence to sink its teeth into our conversation and after a minute or so, Setu spoke up

""So… if there are no more survivors, no one to interview… how are you going to make the documentary…""

""I mean your interview and existence alone might be enough…"" I sighed pretending and acting like I had been defeated…

""But you can't be sure that it will prove to be worth it right?""

""No, …Maybe… but certainly not after I've paid you in full… I'd be swimming in debt by then…""

I put on a brave face while hoping my chest would endure the loud thumps, the huge hits my ribs were taking from my heart with each beat, knowing too well that the moment was coming…

""Ever thought about going to the island?""

""No…hah that'd be crazy and illegal. Why? Are you thinking of going back?""

Setu looked out of the window and into the distance, his eyes desperately trying to find an Island that I now know was stuck in his head, just like it was stuck in mine…

""I tried denying myself that freedom, but a part of me feels like its my right to go back if that's where I belong. Find out what happened back then, why did my family lose me…are they still alive?""

""I.. understand…""

I wanted to say so much more but that would've blown it. It took all my strength to hold myself back until Setu proposed the idea himself, which was crucial. 

""Do you think we can make it there? I mean it would be pretty sweet… you'll get footage and information that could complete your documentary….""

""Yeah…yeah it would be nice… but you're better off dreaming, getting there would be a nightmare and getting past your parents, your father especially… would be hell…""

Again, after a long pause…

""What if I was able to convince them? What if somehow they weren't part of this equation… Could you make it happen?""

""Wait… you're actually serious about this? SETU IF we get caught we'd be sent to prison for god knows how long! And I am not risking that or your life especially after knowing what your parents fear ever since I showed up to interview you…""

""You sound like them…but this is my life… my past. I have a right to know…""

*Silence*

""You should think this over man… give it a good week or so at least""

""I have… I have been thinking about this ever since you told me that I could be from the island… Can you do it? Do you think you can pull this off?"" 

I sighed, and acted my part and after some deliberate performance of contemplating my options, I said…

""Let me look into it""

Setu nodded, we shook hands, and he then left my room. I'll confess I spied on him from my window and after he had passed the hotel gate, I screamed at the top of my lungs. It was done, and my dream was coming true. All I had to do was pretend and waste a few days, preferably a week in the name of research. In actuality, all of that was already done. My key and safe passage to the island was through a man named Abbas. 

Now, before I tell you about Abbas, let me confess something: I had assumed that my manipulation was what had pushed Setu to go back to the island, but in reality, the reason was something that he would confess on our way to the island. A confession I still hope he had made that night, or even before we left, because the dream Setu had, which prompted him to take this step, was a warning in disguise, a warning that he misinterpreted as a calling. 

Now, about Abbas, Carl and I had met the guy at a late-night party in Pondicherry, he dealt with rather illicit and provocative substances, and so I had naturally exchanged numbers with him in case I was back in India and wanted to experience the high life again. I had contacted him a few days ago, and under the guise of getting to know him better, I had learned that his people smuggled in various substances from Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines through illegal sea routes. And so I was supposed to meet him in Chennai a few days later. Coincidentally, the doctor who treated Setu was also in the same city. Abbas had helped me track him down, which gave me hope that he would be able to help me reach the island. 

However, upon reaching Chennai, things weren't off to a great start. Dr. Kumar wasn't exactly cooperative, and that was because I hadn't told Mr. Sastry that I had tracked him down. The man didn't know I was in contact with the family, and I didn't want the Sastrys to know that I was stalking their son's old doctor. Eventually, I was forced to show him their interviews, and it was then that he decided to calm down and meet with me officially at his home. When I reached there the next day, I was greeted by a quaint two-story house that was a rather pleasant contrast to the bustling life in the heart of the city. Dr. Sai Kumar was already waiting for me in the yard. 

He had two chairs set up for both of us, and when I took a seat, he promptly ordered tea for us. Though this setup appeared welcoming, this was clearly his way of testing me, making sure I didn't get to interact with his family, and ordering tea for me without knowing my preference seemed like another power move. I liked that everyone in the South of India preferred coffee, and so I had grown used to it being the staple drink, but now, here I was on a hot and humid Chennai mornin,g surrounded under the shade of palm trees, having some hot tea. I didn't want to start the conversation on a bad note, and thus I begrudgingly sipped the tea and said…

""Thanks for meeting me Mr. Kumar… you have a lovely place""

He simply nodded, clearly wanting to get over the pleasantries as soon as possible…

""Thanks Phillip. Let's get one thing straight before we talk… I don't want to be on tape, I don't want to be a part of your documentary because frankly talking about my patients without their consent, is breaking the law and my oath..""

""I know Doctor, and that can be fixed""

I took out my phone, dialed Setu and handed it over to the Doctor. His face was like an ocean of expression, each consecutive wave bringing along a new one, it started with curious, then familiarity and happiness upon talking to Setu which was then followed by confusion when I assume Setu granted him permission to talk about his medical history, and then eventually defeat when he realized that he would now have to talk to me. Of course the entire conversation was in the native language so I didn't know what they talked about, but when Doctor Kumar handed the phone back to me, he said…

""Fine Philip. You seem to know your way, and Setu seems to trust you. What do you want to know?""

""Everything, but before we start, do I have permission to record your audio? You don't have to be on camera if you don't want but your audio will be of tremendous help.""

He nodded, ordered his servant to get him some documents and then started. I quickly pressed the record button on my audio recorder and placed it between us. 

""Setu's case was unique but not untreatable. Yes, he was malnourished, dehydrated, sunburnt but nothing that was untreatable. That is until the wound on his back began to act up…""

By this time his servant had brought him the necessary files and after flipping through a few pages, he handed me two photographs. It was the wound on Setu's back and it was gnarly. There was a huge gash between his shoulder blades and the skin around it was purple and black. There were tiny holes, missing flesh, as though cookie cutter fishes had had a field day while he was in water. The tea almost jumped from my stomach back into the cup but I managed to control my reflexes. The wound was horrid, and imagining that on the back of someone who was only 7 or 8 years old still gives me nightmares. But this was only the beginning…

""Yeah…and these photos were taken 5 days after Setu was recovered. I had him on IV from the first day and even attempted a debridement surgery in the confines of the home. We were able to remove the highly affected tissue but there was no positive response from his body. The wound culture didn’t raise any alarms but this made Setu’s case all the more puzzling from a medical perspective. I was administering every antibiotic ideal for his condition considering his weight and the results of the culture, yet it seemed to have no effect. The fever would suppress with every dose but the would showed no signs of healing. ”

He then pointed to the photos,

“These holes you see, we assumed this was done by sea life at first, but then…look at this…""

Dr. Kumar handed me another paper, this time an MRI. I didn't know what I was looking at, and so Dr. Kumar explained it to me and once I realized what he was trying to say, chills ran down my spine. The holes led all the way to Setu's spine…

""Now we tried stitching them up the first day he was brought in. The stitches held for a day, but then dissolved all on their own after 24 hours. Reluctantly and after consultation with some of my other colleagues in Chennai, we decided to use Staples…but 24 hours later, the skin had lesioned and separated on its own…the tissue seemed to be rejecting treatment""

""So….. you're telling me that somehow, the holes were forced open?""

Dr. Kumar didn't want to answer that question and his following words made that clear. 

""You see the holes weren't that big, only 2 to 3 cm in diameter, but the bigger wound, that was my biggest concern. At first I thought sepsis had begun its course, but then that MRI showed something else, a foreign mass.""

He then pointed to a very dark area that at first seemed to be a part of the surrounding back muscles around the spine.

""Unfortunately for Setu, I spotted that anomaly after 3 weeks. During those three weeks, we tried everything, from simple bandages to speculation of skin grafts. Despite Mr. Sastry's unwavering stance on not involving any other doctor, I consulted with many and even brought my daughter with me to observe Setu behind his back. She was in the last year of her medical college and she was the one who spotted the anomaly when I showed her the MRI scan.""

""What was it, Doctor?""

""As I said, a foreign organic mass. It seemed to resemble the muscle tissue from which it was extracted at first, but once separated, we preserved the sample in formalin, but within hours, its cellular structure collapsed. By the time I had finished  patching up Setu after the procedure, the mass had lost its original structure, and by the time I was able to analyze it hours later at the hospital, I realized it had suffered from acute cellular degradation.""

""Did you do any other tests?""

""There wasn't much to learn after that happened. We debated sending it for advanced testing, but Mr. Sastry was adamant. Any formal lab would generate records that could expose Setu. ""

""So that was it then…""

He nods. ""After that, the boy recovered miraculously; the stitches held their ground, With the mass removed, systemic antibiotics and wound management finally began to show rapid improvement. Setu was saved from the verge of sepsis. He was kept on nutritional fluids and Vitamins for a few months but that's the extent of that. 

""Did his parents ever take him to a psychologist?""

Dr. Kumar gave me a cold hard stare after that one. I knew he knew something but his words implied otherwise…

""Not that I know of Philip no""

To avoid overstaying my welcome, I made copies of the photos and the MRI scan and left his residence. Dr. Kumar had given me more than enough information needed but right now I needed to focus on my meeting with Abbas, and how I was going to help me arrange my excursion to North Sentinel Island. 

— 

I am exhausted after that one, having confessed what I have and facing what I've done and how it started has taken its toll on me. As I mentioned at the start, I can't use this to prolong my control either. Not after experiencing the consequences firsthand… as for the image Setu had drawn, I couldn't find it, but I have attached my own rendition of it below. I have tried to be accurate rather than artistic, neither of us were artists to begin with…

The stairwell structure featured on the cover appears in many photos and I can’t think of what it might have been? I’m pretty sure the view here is looking across SW Morrison from the SW corner to the NW corner of the SW Morrison and Broadway intersection where the Capitol One Cafe is now. This location is estimated from the street signs and perceived orientation of the photo so I could be off on the precise location.

I have used nespresso and like the coffee good enough and appreciate the flavor, however I feel like a regular machine like the breville or casabrews would pull a better shot, allow me to have hot lattes, and be more economical using coffee versus buying pods. I would also consider buying a grinder, but not sure if this is necessary. 

As a student this is a big purchase for me either way so wondering if the difference in cost between the Breville and Casabrews is worth it, and if the loss of convenience from nespresso is worth purchasing a regular machine. Any advice appreciated!! ",2,1749667812.0,espresso,4,1.0,False

1l90lqs,https://www.reddit.com/r/VAIIYAMedia/comments/1l90lqs/people_are_asking_chatgpt_for_relationship_advice/,People Are Asking ChatGPT for Relationship Advice and It’s Ending in Disaster,"Despite ChatGPT's [well-documented issues](https://futurism.com/chatgpt-mental-health-crises), people are using it to advise them on relationship issues — and it's going about as well as you'd expect.

https://preview.redd.it/h6bcks0dfc6f1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fad64b021f0a7b0d708c3e3acc72fba4c57b93cc

In a new editorial, [*Vice* advice columnist Sammi Caramela](https://www.vice.com/en/article/chatgpt-dating-advice-is-feeding-delusions-and-causing-unnecessary-breakups/) said she had been blissfully unaware of the [ChatGPT-as-therapist](https://futurism.com/body-image-chatgpt-advice) trend until someone wrote into her work email about it earlier this year.

Back in February, an unnamed man told the writer that his girlfriend [refused to stop using the chatbot](https://www.vice.com/en/article/my-girlfriend-wont-stop-using-chatgpt-for-relationship-advice/) for dating advice and would even bring up things it had told her in arguments. Though Caramela was so shocked that she ""nearly choked"" on her coffee, the advice-seeker wasn't all that perturbed — and claimed that he found his girlfriend's ChatGPT use fascinating.

""I was a bit floored by this confession. I had no idea people were actually turning to AI for advice, much less input on their relationships,"" the columnist wrote in her more recent piece. ""However, the more I explored the topic, the more I realized how common it was to seek help from AI — especially in an era where therapy is an expensive luxury.""

Intrigued, Caramela found a friend who used the OpenAI chatbot for similar purposes, running relationship issues by it as a ""non-biased"" sounding board. Eventually, that person realized that ChatGPT wasn't unbiased at all, but rather ""seemed to heavily validate her experience, perhaps dangerously so.""

Similar questions have been posed on the [r/ChatGPT subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1k6nn0x/is_chatgpt_feeding_your_delusions/), and as Caramela explained, the consensus over there suggested not only that the chatbot is something of a ""yes-man,"" but also that its propensity to agree with users can be dangerous for people who have mental health issues.

""I often and openly write about my struggles with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD),"" the writer divulged. ""If I went to ChatGPT for dating advice and failed to mention how my OCD tends to attack my relationships, I might receive unhelpful, even harmful, input about my relationship.""

Digger deeper into the world of ChatGPT therapy, Caramela found multiple threads on OCD-related subreddits about the chatbot — and on the forum dedicated to ROCD, or relationship-focused OCD, someone even admitted that the [chatbot told them to break up](https://www.reddit.com/r/ROCD/comments/1ksnv0f/chatgpt_told_me_to_break_up_with_my_partner/) with their partner.

""Programs like ChatGPT only speed the OCD cycle up because you can ask question after question for hours trying to gain some sense of certainty,"" another user responded in the r/ROCD thread. ""There's always another 'what if' question with OCD.""

Like so many [poorly-trained human professionals](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/well/mind/bad-therapists.html), chatbots aren't equipped to handle the nuance and sensitivity needed in any therapeutic context. Regardless of what OpenAI claims in its marketing, ChatGPT can't be truly empathetic — and if your ""therapist"" will never be able to have a human-to-human connection, why would you want it to give you dating advice in the first place?",1,1749667361.0,VAIIYAMedia,0,1.0,False

1l90k10,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l90k10/something_visits_the_sentinelese_from_the_sea_i/,Something Visits The Sentinelese From the Sea? I Wish I Didn't Know That (Part 4),"I know it has been some time since the last update, but things have transpired rather superfluously. I had hoped this deal I made, the longer I took to write down these experiences, the longer I stretched them out…. I had hoped it would grant me some time, but this has cost me. Cynthia has now been roped into this, and so has Rose. 



I tried to fight, move my muscles, go against the ebb and flow of the macabre, gooey dark molasses that has been stripping away my being only to lose a few more layers of my psyche to expose the already rotting insides that I always knew had existed long before I had been a part of any of this. 



… Let's start this one differently; let me give it another shot. After all, these are supposed to be cathartic entries for me and entertaining for you. 



Setu's rendition of the symbol had me scouring the web like a maniac for at least two days, and what I found didn't instill confidence either. The most I could gather was that it was the symbol of a fallen God, a forgotten God barely mentioned in the dark corners of forums, belonging to threads I posted that would either get archived or deleted within hours. But for those few hours, while the thread was up, I would get comments that would tell me —



*Looks bad*



*Nice try Edgelord*



*What, are we letting anyone post random things now?*



*That's sacrilege, you know how offensive that is? Istg, people will twist and turn holy symbols just to get a reaction. You want me to turn the cross sideways and then turn it into a crude Swastika?*



*The last we entertained such a thread, it turned out to be a 13-year-old who had just found his dad's old Victorian horror stories*.



But then, one comment offered me hope.



*Idk dude but if you're serious about this, everything looks wrong, it looks upside down, looks mirrored, the serpent encircling it is moving in the opposite direction….This doesn't represent eternity…it represents eternal torment…and the symbol…Idk who it is…but whoever it is, has either fallen, is doomed, or once betrayed wherever it came from*

\- 

I remember the first two comments because they would always show up, I remember the third one clearly because that's what told me that this was symbolic and holy to someone at the least. The fourth one I remember because it had sent me down a rabbit hole of someone who was suffering the same fate as me a few months ago, albeit fictionally. The kid had ended the 6-month long thread with a photo of the monster that stalked him at night…the link to the photo Rick Rolled everyone invested. 



I still chuckle about it as I write this…the last one…the last one stuck with me, sticks with me because I would soon come to find out that some random stranger on the internet had tried to warn me of what I was getting into, but every protest against my desire to visit the island, every obstacle, every statistical or logistical problem only brought out the worst in me. 



I had ignored this comment thinking that someone was simply trolling me, trying to scare me even more than I was. I had also decided to lie to Setu, falsely promising his identity would be protected. Because after the interviews, after the symbol, after its potential meaning being unveiled, the pit in my stomach had grown to a gargantuan size. It had swallowed my morals, had twisted my intents and had put out a shoddy copy of my identity that I stupidly took as my own. I know people often say that if they could go back in time, they would stop their former selves….they would stop themselves before it was too late ….I wouldn't. I wouldn't dare even try…



I had lied to Setu, I had lied to Bala that the terms had changed after Carl and the rest had seen the footage, I had lied to Carl that there was even going to be a documentary to show in the first place…and I had lied to Mr. Sastry by handing over $15,000 and promising the rest once I had wrapped up the project. Faking a contract was easy; averting his gaze as his adopted son fell deeper into the web of my lies was even easier… 



I had become this vile chameleon that would instantly adapt to scenarios to get what it wanted. Back then, I had thought of myself as a hero …a hero saving Setu, a hero helping him find his origins, a hero doing what the world should've done long ago… a visionary on the frontier of the unexplored… but now I know, I was a fool barking and gnawing at the trust of my people and dragging them to the edge of the world and into the maw of something that would one day eventually change the meaning of ….creation. 



And so, assuming that nobody would understand me, nobody would understand my burden, I began to sow seeds of mistrust and curiosity that would eventually lead me where I had always wanted to go. Setu was, by all means, a stalwart man, but I had also gained his trust; I had become a confidant he never knew he needed. Years ago, he had tried to learn more about his past but was always shut down by his parents; he had always tried to look more into it, but they had always averted his curiosity. But now, as an outsider, I could exploit that, and before you knew it, he was itching to learn more about his past, just like I had planned. 



Bala however, was another story, he had grown to resent me, our friendly banter had ended the day the ""documentary"" was approved and funded. I had paid him in full, and maybe he found that disrespectful, but in hindsight, he was probably onto me. Bala had stuck around for a week as I prodded Setu and the Sastry family for minute details. But then out of the blue, he had come to my room one morning and had quit. 



""I need a change of pace, I need a taste of normality, I am going back to Chennai""



""Sure… Wait… is something wrong? I know we haven't exactly been talking lately but you know I think of you as a friend Bala….right?""



I still remember him staring into my eyes then… If I was me, I would've known what that stare meant, but I wasn't and so I didn't. 



""Goodbye Phillip. Maybe we'll see each other again soon…""



I nodded, handed Bala some extra cash, and watched him drive away. By then I had learned my way around the culture better, I had bought myself a used car, had learned how to deal with swindlers, and most importantly, had found my preference when it came to food. And then one fateful night, while I was exhaling clouds of cancer, lost in the thoughts of how to take my machinations a step further, there was a knock on my room's door… It was Setu. I had welcomed him in, and when Setu spoke… I knew the seeds I had planted had finally sprouted…



""Do you really think there are more out there Phillip?""



""I don't know man… you're a miracle to be honest, finding another miracle in this lifetime seems like a heavy dose of optimism even for me…""



""I am starting to believe that you might be right…""



Part of me wanted to jump and probe Setu further, but by then I had become this evil chef of spiced lies and so I waited with bated breath as I let Setu cook… He took his sweet time, but eventually continued much to my sadistic pleasure…



""I …remember what I told you what I thought about my parents?""



I nodded and sighed, playing my part of a trusted confidant and friend to perfection. Setu always had strong feelings about his biological parents. He didn't hate them, but to him, there was an unknown fear and trepidation associated with them. He had hinted at this when I had initially started to peel his layers, but over the past two weeks, he had revealed how he truly felt. As far as I had gathered, Setu had repressed memories and buried feelings. Whenever he thought about them, he felt fear, dread, he got uneasy and twitchy but as I would come to know through this conversation, he had finally managed to peel away a layer that I had failed to pierce despite my desperation. 



""I wonder if she would recognize me… I wonder if he would…would they regret or rejoice if they ever knew that I was still alive? They'd probably shun me though…considering how protective the tribe is when it comes to interactions with the mainland""



I simply nodded and continued my stoic impersonation of someone actively listening to a friend. In reality, I was struggling to ignore the itch under my skin to push Setu towards my ultimate goal. 



""Do you remember them? Their faces, the island, anything?""



He shook his head, ""No… no, just my gut screaming at me, my mind searching for memories that should be there but aren't…""



I knew I had to stall this, and so I allowed silence to sink its teeth into our conversation and after a minute or so, Setu spoke up



""So… if there are no more survivors, no one to interview… how are you going to make the documentary…""



""I mean your interview and existence alone might be enough…"" I sighed pretending and acting like I had been defeated…



""But you can't be sure that it will prove to be worth it right?""



""No, …Maybe… but certainly not after I've paid you in full… I'd be swimming in debt by then…""



I put on a brave face while hoping my chest would endure the loud thumps, the huge hits my ribs were taking from my heart with each beat, knowing too well that the moment was coming…



""Ever thought about going to the island?""



""No…hah that'd be crazy and illegal. Why? Are you thinking of going back?""



Setu looked out of the window and into the distance, his eyes desperately trying to find an Island that I now know was stuck in his head, just like it was stuck in mine…



""I tried denying myself that freedom, but a part of me feels like its my right to go back if that's where I belong. Find out what happened back then, why did my family lose me…are they still alive?""



""I.. understand…""



I wanted to say so much more but that would've blown it. It took all my strength to hold myself back until Setu proposed the idea himself, which was crucial. 



""Do you think we can make it there? I mean it would be pretty sweet… you'll get footage and information that could complete your documentary….""



""Yeah…yeah it would be nice… but you're better off dreaming, getting there would be a nightmare and getting past your parents, your father especially… would be hell…""



Again, after a long pause…



""What if I was able to convince them? What if somehow they weren't part of this equation… Could you make it happen?""



""Wait… you're actually serious about this? SETU IF we get caught we'd be sent to prison for god knows how long! And I am not risking that or your life especially after knowing what your parents fear ever since I showed up to interview you…""



""You sound like them…but this is my life… my past. I have a right to know…""



*Silence*



""You should think this over man… give it a good week or so at least""



""I have… I have been thinking about this ever since you told me that I could be from the island… Can you do it? Do you think you can pull this off?"" 



I sighed, and acted my part and after some deliberate performance of contemplating my options, I said…



""Let me look into it""



Setu nodded, we shook hands, and he then left my room. I'll confess I spied on him from my window and after he had passed the hotel gate, I screamed at the top of my lungs. It was done, and my dream was coming true. All I had to do was pretend and waste a few days, preferably a week in the name of research. In actuality, all of that was already done. My key and safe passage to the island was through a man named Abbas. 



Now, before I tell you about Abbas, let me confess something: I had assumed that my manipulation was what had pushed Setu to go back to the island, but in reality, the reason was something that he would confess on our way to the island. A confession I still hope he had made that night, or even before we left, because the dream Setu had, which prompted him to take this step, was a warning in disguise, a warning that he misinterpreted as a calling. 



Now, about Abbas, Carl and I had met the guy at a late-night party in Pondicherry, he dealt with rather illicit and provocative substances, and so I had naturally exchanged numbers with him in case I was back in India and wanted to experience the high life again. I had contacted him a few days ago, and under the guise of getting to know him better, I had learned that his people smuggled in various substances from Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines through illegal sea routes. And so I was supposed to meet him in Chennai a few days later. Coincidentally, the doctor who treated Setu was also in the same city. Abbas had helped me track him down, which gave me hope that he would be able to help me reach the island. 



However, upon reaching Chennai, things weren't off to a great start. Dr. Kumar wasn't exactly cooperative, and that was because I hadn't told Mr. Sastry that I had tracked him down. The man didn't know I was in contact with the family, and I didn't want the Sastrys to know that I was stalking their son's old doctor. Eventually, I was forced to show him their interviews, and it was then that he decided to calm down and meet with me officially at his home. When I reached there the next day, I was greeted by a quaint two-story house that was a rather pleasant contrast to the bustling life in the heart of the city. Dr. Sai Kumar was already waiting for me in the yard. 



He had two chairs set up for both of us, and when I took a seat, he promptly ordered tea for us. Though this setup appeared welcoming, this was clearly his way of testing me, making sure I didn't get to interact with his family, and ordering tea for me without knowing my preference seemed like another power move. I liked that everyone in the South of India preferred coffee, and so I had grown used to it being the staple drink, but now, here I was on a hot and humid Chennai mornin,g surrounded under the shade of palm trees, having some hot tea. I didn't want to start the conversation on a bad note, and thus I begrudgingly sipped the tea and said…



""Thanks for meeting me Mr. Kumar… you have a lovely place""



He simply nodded, clearly wanting to get over the pleasantries as soon as possible…



""Thanks Phillip. Let's get one thing straight before we talk… I don't want to be on tape, I don't want to be a part of your documentary because frankly talking about my patients without their consent, is breaking the law and my oath..""



""I know Doctor, and that can be fixed""



I took out my phone, dialed Setu and handed it over to the Doctor. His face was like an ocean of expression, each consecutive wave bringing along a new one, it started with curious, then familiarity and happiness upon talking to Setu which was then followed by confusion when I assume Setu granted him permission to talk about his medical history, and then eventually defeat when he realized that he would now have to talk to me. Of course the entire conversation was in the native language so I didn't know what they talked about, but when Doctor Kumar handed the phone back to me, he said…



""Fine Philip. You seem to know your way, and Setu seems to trust you. What do you want to know?""



""Everything, but before we start, do I have permission to record your audio? You don't have to be on camera if you don't want but your audio will be of tremendous help.""



He nodded, ordered his servant to get him some documents and then started. I quickly pressed the record button on my audio recorder and placed it between us. 



""Setu's case was unique but not untreatable. Yes, he was malnourished, dehydrated, sunburnt but nothing that was untreatable. That is until the wound on his back began to act up…""



By this time his servant had brought him the necessary files and after flipping through a few pages, he handed me two photographs. It was the wound on Setu's back and it was gnarly. There was a huge gash between his shoulder blades and the skin around it was purple and black. There were tiny holes, missing flesh, as though cookie cutter fishes had had a field day while he was in water. The tea almost jumped from my stomach back into the cup but I managed to control my reflexes. The wound was horrid, and imagining that on the back of someone who was only 7 or 8 years old still gives me nightmares. But this was only the beginning…



""Yeah…and these photos were taken 5 days after Setu was recovered. I had him on IV from the first day and even attempted a debridement surgery in the confines of the home. We were able to remove the highly affected tissue but there was no positive response from his body. The wound culture didn’t raise any alarms but this made Setu’s case all the more puzzling from a medical perspective. I was administering every antibiotic ideal for his condition considering his weight and the results of the culture, yet it seemed to have no effect. The fever would suppress with every dose but the would showed no signs of healing. ”



He then pointed to the photos,



“These holes you see, we assumed this was done by sea life at first, but then…look at this…""



Dr. Kumar handed me another paper, this time an MRI. I didn't know what I was looking at, and so Dr. Kumar explained it to me and once I realized what he was trying to say, chills ran down my spine. The holes led all the way to Setu's spine…



""Now we tried stitching them up the first day he was brought in. The stitches held for a day, but then dissolved all on their own after 24 hours. Reluctantly and after consultation with some of my other colleagues in Chennai, we decided to use Staples…but 24 hours later, the skin had lesioned and separated on its own…the tissue seemed to be rejecting treatment""



""So….. you're telling me that somehow, the holes were forced open?""



Dr. Kumar didn't want to answer that question and his following words made that clear. 



""You see the holes weren't that big, only 2 to 3 cm in diameter, but the bigger wound, that was my biggest concern. At first I thought sepsis had begun its course, but then that MRI showed something else, a foreign mass.""



He then pointed to a very dark area that at first seemed to be a part of the surrounding back muscles around the spine.



""Unfortunately for Setu, I spotted that anomaly after 3 weeks. During those three weeks, we tried everything, from simple bandages to speculation of skin grafts. Despite Mr. Sastry's unwavering stance on not involving any other doctor, I consulted with many and even brought my daughter with me to observe Setu behind his back. She was in the last year of her medical college and she was the one who spotted the anomaly when I showed her the MRI scan.""



""What was it, Doctor?""



""As I said, a foreign organic mass. It seemed to resemble the muscle tissue from which it was extracted at first, but once separated, we preserved the sample in formalin, but within hours, its cellular structure collapsed. By the time I had finished  patching up Setu after the procedure, the mass had lost its original structure, and by the time I was able to analyze it hours later at the hospital, I realized it had suffered from acute cellular degradation.""



""Did you do any other tests?""



""There wasn't much to learn after that happened. We debated sending it for advanced testing, but Mr. Sastry was adamant. Any formal lab would generate records that could expose Setu. ""



""So that was it then…""



He nods. ""After that, the boy recovered miraculously; the stitches held their ground, With the mass removed, systemic antibiotics and wound management finally began to show rapid improvement. Setu was saved from the verge of sepsis. He was kept on nutritional fluids and Vitamins for a few months but that's the extent of that. 



""Did his parents ever take him to a psychologist?""



Dr. Kumar gave me a cold hard stare after that one. I knew he knew something but his words implied otherwise…



""Not that I know of Philip no""



To avoid overstaying my welcome, I made copies of the photos and the MRI scan and left his residence. Dr. Kumar had given me more than enough information needed but right now I needed to focus on my meeting with Abbas, and how I was going to help me arrange my excursion to North Sentinel Island.

I am exhausted after that one, having confessed what I have and facing what I've done and how it started has taken its toll on me. As I mentioned at the start, I can't use this to prolong my control either. Not after experiencing the consequences firsthand… as for the image Setu had drawn, I couldn't find it, but I have attached my own rendition of it below. I have tried to be accurate rather than artistic, neither of us were artists to begin with…

1l90jxa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1l90jxa/getting_heart_palpitations_often/,Getting heart palpitations often,"40 yo male, 6ft 195lbs, non-smoker, semi active.

So... I've been getting heart palpitations. I'm not sure what to do next. Bit of backstory:

Typically it's after eating while relaxing. They seem to go away if I hold my breath but resume soon after I stop. It's not every beat but for a while it's one every 20-100 beats (random). These episodes last for maybe an hour. No other symptoms.

It's the feeling of a missed beat, then an extra powerful thump to catch up.

I had similar episodes about three? Years ago. Went to my doc and had an ekg, all normal. Palps weren't occurring at this moment.

Eventually they went away.

About 6 months ago I was having chest pains, I was 99% sure it was nothing but also I don't wanna be the guy who keels over at 45. It was a Sunday morning so I went to the ED to get checked. EKG, chest xray, blood work, all normal (and out $2250, awesome).

I drink a cup of coffee in the mornings, and usually 1 in the afternoon and one at night. I've cut back on that to no avail. I don't smoke, I'm not overweight, I'm not stressed, no history of anxiety, and not a heavy drinker (3-4 per week).

I find my self waking up leaving for work and getting home and having to get ready for the next day and then bed.

I would like to stay in the cities area during the week and sleep in my car at night.I plan to bring my gaming labtop and spend time in coffee shops in the evening, more time in the gym, and possibly some time doing some uber/doordash delivering to make better use of my time, plus ill save a bunch on gas from the commute.

1. I see lots of people recommending rotating locations over night, can I please get some suggestions of places to rotate? Location is city/suburban central america.  
2. I plan to use duct tape and sheets to cover my windows, any better ideas?  
3. I plan to buy a twin memory foam bed topper to lay down in my trunk and my seat folds down, unfortunately I am a bigger guy and drive a sedan but luckily my back seat fully folds down.  
4. I plan to bulk meal prep Sunday night for the week and maybe 2-3 nights will be chipolte or subway/jimmy johns. I have access to a break room hot/cold water for breakfast with microwave/fridges for lunch too.  
5. I have a YMCA membership and plan to workout and use this for changing and showering, will bring a shower bag with toothbrush amenities etc....then just have a dirty laundry bag to bring home for the weekend.

I'm kind of excited, I could see my self living outside the cities like this long term to save on housing in the future but for now im just trying to finish school and commute to my internship from my college town. I'm a bit worried about safety too so a little nervous, any other tips/tricks/advice is greatly appreciated!

to sit through a Tuesday?

She wasn’t made to undo me,

fumbling for words that feel too big
for the small things she does.

She walks like she doesn’t know
the room watches her breathe.
Not music.
More like silence I can’t stop listening to.

Her body?
Yes, it’s beautiful. I’m not blind.
But it’s the way she hugs with her whole weight,
like she’s handing over a part of herself
and trusting you won’t drop it.

I wish I could unfeel her laugh…
the kind that cracked open something
I didn’t know I’d sealed.

And her eyes,
they don’t just intoxicate.
They see me.
And I don’t always like what’s seen.

I write this like a fool,
like someone who lost the plot.
But I’d rather be lost
than go back to feeling nothing.

it’s not wine and roses.

We partake in 'cheech and chong meetings' in our garage, we usually invite a few of our friends over. Lately my sister-in-law Kailey 21F has mentioned how much one of our new friends, 'Nathan' 37M hangs out with me a lot and texts me all day (not continously just throughout the day). Now he hangs out with my husband too and they game it up but, Nathan does talk and text me a lot more than him. Nathan comes over almost every day or has us (both, just me or just Martin) come over to his house. He texts me and lets me know when he is getting off work and things like that. He buys my husband and I our favorite drinks from the store when he comes over sometimes and always follows me around (my husband does this too) at the cheech and Chong festivals we have legally here in our state. He did something recently that really threw me off though. We all happened to be going out of town to the same place one weekend. Him and his brother were visiting his mom and my husband and i were there for a weekend away and an event. Nathan ended up texting me and inviting us to his moms house to hang even though he knew we had a hotel, long story short my husband says yes and then later he asks my husband at 1 am if we wanted to just stay over even though it was our first time there and meetng their mom, it wasnt really his house to offer. I could have drove my husband and i to the hotel bc they were all under the influence and I was good. Then texts me the next morning that theres coffee and breakfast if I am awake at 7am. We all went to bed at 4am, I don't need much sleep but my husband and Zander 35M (Nathans brother) were still asleep. I didn't want to wake him bc he was snoring, so I got up to grab some food and coffee and Nathan is there waiting. I've never had this kind of friendship with a guy other than my husband. I love my husband and his is my best friend but is this normal guy friend begavior?? We have this awesome Cheech/chong Gang that I don't want to affect. We have a group of 4 girls and 8 guys, and all but Nathan and Zander 35M are in relationships. Nathan never mentions women except that he has an ex from a long long time ago but hes also only hanging with me and our little gang, he doesn't want to go to bars or anything. One of the girls brought it to my attention about how im the only girl Nathan talks/texts or invites to his house out of our group. I just thought that we are just real cool with each other and nothing much more. Does she have a point? Does my guy friend want more even though I'm married and he's good friends with my husband? I just don't need someone putting things out in our group if they aren't true and then ruining our fun.

I’m having an issue with my Smeg DCF02 drip coffee maker and I’m hoping someone here has experienced the same thing.

I bought it brand new just 4–5 days ago (from a private seller, so I don’t have warranty access). It worked fine for two brews, but now it’s completely stuck.

Here’s what happens:
•When I press ON, the button blinks slowly
•Then it makes two beeps
•A thermometer icon shows up to the right of the clock
•Then nothing else happens, the machine doesn’t start

What I’ve tried:
•Unplugging and replugging
•Letting it cool down for hours
•Trying a brew cycle with no water/coffee
•Checking the carafe, filter basket, water tank all in place

Still the same issue. I couldn’t find any info about the thermometer icon in the manual or online. I’m wondering if it’s a stuck thermal sensor or factory defect, but it’s weird for it to happen after just two uses.

Has anyone here experienced something similar or knows how to reset/fix this?

1l90e3b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1l90e3b/ive_been_doing_a_lot_of_thinking_and_i_have_a/,I’ve been doing a lot of thinking and I have a question for the christain,"1. We have to come to the realization that the only way humanity will survive or be good in the eyes of god is through Jesus Christ and the christain god in his omniscience knew it all along and created humans with the sole purpose to come and die (Jesus)

Meaning : he knew Adam and Eve will eat the fruit even before he created them so he was like “ the only possibility for humans to be good is if I come and die for them in human flesh” and I think this is correct from the Christians perspective 

So we all agree that humanity was created for Jesus Christ meaning Jesus Christ is the whole reason why god created humanity assuming god wants us to be good and not evil. But wait does that mean the nature of humans is evil? . Anyways one of the questions I have is this 

IF GOD CREATED HUMANS FOR JESUS CHRIST(since it’s the only way for humans to be good and sin free) then I see no reason why god should not take everyone to heaven. Hear me out,  I am not ignoring the concept of free will and I think it makes sense in the concept of Christianity but still the Christian god knew every single decision we will use our free will to make. He knew every single action that will take place in the world before he created it from the beginning till the end. Right?

So why did he create some humans knowing humans are bad. Oh, he created them for Jesus Christ so why are some humans going to miss out on what he was created for ???? 

He created that random guy that does bad things knowing fully well that he will do those bad things but created him anyways. 

So isn’t it unfair to send anyone to hell??

You created humanity for one purpose which is Jesus Christ

The same reason why you’re sending people to hell is the same reason why you sent Jesus Christ in the first place :disobedience 

So why create 


Or why did he not only create the people that he knew will accept Christ 


Even if In my free will i deny Christ why did god still create me knowing fully well every free will decision I will make 

Why did god give me life 


I think it’s unfair to send anyone to hell or what do you think. 


2.My second question is how does existence and creation benefit anyone??
What’s the purpose ??

Why will god give us life knowing some people will have cancer and disgusting diseases 

And I mean all this in a sense of respect and curiosity 

But why does life seem like a lottery 

I mean let’s take human appearance for example 

What are some people born blind ???

Or why are there diseases and sicknesses 

And disasters 

The world actually looks like a mistake 

I mean christain a say the world can’t be created or happen by mistake 

But the world looks like a mistake 

The world looks like as if God is telling himself “ I wish I could do more”

It’s easy for you to argue if you’re in a comfy home  with coffee and a car and nice house 

But let’s be realistic 

The world appears to be an abomination 

And you could argue that it’s a curse that caused all the bad things because of Adam and eve when they fell 

But wait god knew what Adam and Eve will do yet he created them anyway 


So he created them to show he has the ability to curse???",0,1749666871.0,Christianity,10,0.5,False

The last three times I've gone this month, including this morning, there was one cashier who was also the lone barista making coffees for takeout and dine in, while FOUR waitresses or baristas? managers? couldn't tell what their roles were bc they weren't doing anything other than talking to each other and ignoring the line while this one poor girl was clearly frazzled as the only one doing anything and everything at the front as the line kept growing. like I know the slowness is part of their french/european IDGAF approach/schtick, but honestly it's just gotten ridiculous now with the staff straight up ignoring customers and then when they do decide to wait on us, they're not all that friendly, they just stare at you blankly for even being there as if they're doing you a favor instead of doing their job. The girl in front of me asked me if they were always this slow and inattentive and the guy behind me overhead her and jumped in to say it wasn't always THIS bad. Guy behind me ended up leaving 5 mins later bc the one barista was still fussing with her coffee order and baguettes, hadn't even gotten to me yet and didn't for another 5 mins after already waiting for 10. 

Also there are often bugs flying around in the pastries--it's gotten so bad they had to put those plastic apples around the container to attract/kill the flies.

Most people know that the Norris is already skewed towards offense, looking over the past 25 winners and you can see how heavily the Norris is weighted towards offensive defensemen. Since 2000, the Norris winner has placed 1st or 2nd in scoring among defensemen 19 out of 25 years. Including a 3rd and three 5ths, you are looking at all but two seasons having the winner be a Top 5 scorer.

Hedman, 2018, 5th  
Doughty, 2016, 10th  
Chara, 2009, 12th  
Lidstrom, 2007, 5th  
Niedermayer, 2004, 5th  
Lidstrom, 2003, 3rd

Bobby Orr changed the way defesemen played the game, Makar, Hughes, Karlsson, Doughty, Lidstrom, Coffee, etc refined and perfected that specific style of play. Now the Norris is given to these players rather than the stalwart defensive defensemen.

I get that the Art Ross and Rocket are available to everyone, although Bobby Orr is the only defensemen to do it (twice each). I would love to see a separate award for offensive and defensive. Breaking the defensive awards into two awards wouldn't be too different from the forwards with the Art & Rocket getting two.

Norris for Defensive, Orr for offensive, other names?

\*Edited to add: The Rocket was first awarded in the 1998-99 season. I should have clarified that Orr didn't win the ""Rocket"" perse, just led the league in goals scored\*",30,1749666635.0,nhl,37,0.84,False

* They earn great returns on their invested capital. When they spend money, it tends to generate a lot more.
* Strong margins, loyal customers, and global reach. It checks a lot of boxes.

What I don’t like:

* It’s expensive. Around 35 times free cash flow and 30 times earnings.
* Buying now means you’re banking on strong future growth and no slip-ups.

I continue to ‘pay in app’ to see if the final price changes, it does not. then I go back to the ‘Rewards’ tab to see if that resets or refreshes the applied award, but when you return to ‘Order’ from there, YOU HAVE TO START THE ENTIRE MOBILE PROCESS OVER AGAIN. and the reward would appear on the checkout screen, but not actually apply to the final price. 

is the app just garbage by design & I got suckered into downloading it by their advertising? 

what’s the easiest way to order a coffee, have it ready when I arrive, and successfully apply the $2 handcrafted coffee reward discount? is it better to mobile order via app but select pay in store? 

I just want a mediocre 32oz iced coffee for $2 🫠",2,1749666375.0,Wawa,2,1.0,False

I was grabbing my usual soy latte from my favorite coffee shop this morning, kinda in a rush. My barista, let's call him 'Bean Genius,' was whipping up my drink with his usual flair. As he handed it over, he asked, 'Having a soy-perb day?'... which, tbh, caught me off guard and cracked me up. 

We both chuckled, and before I knew it, we were trading these dumb coffee puns back and forth like two caffeine junkies on a roll (my ability to come up with clever comebacks under pressure was actualy impressive for once!). 

But here's the kicker—before I left, he winked and said, 'You coffee my attention more often.' Just a flirty little pun, but I felt this... buzz that was honestly more than just the caffeine. 😁

Am I reading too much into this, or do those little moments have a chemistry all their own? Anyone else had a similar startlingly pleasant encounter? 😊",3,1749666352.0,chemistryClicks,0,1.0,False

I still smoke pot more than I should but I don't end up in jail from it's use and it's legal in my state. My coffee habit is more of an issue I feel. I wish for never needing to start my days with it and only enjoying it again. Like I did with alcohol oddly.

I was hired as a cashier and I thought it was a good experience to get to know people and brush up on my social skills. But, over time it's kinda wore me down and I'm thinking about quitting and looking for a job at a nearby grocery store or somewhere else. 

While my main role is being a cashier, I have to clean tables, soda machine + lemonade machine, bake soufflé and bakery items sometimes, mop the floor, change bathroom toilet paper, brew coffees, put furniture back into place after people come in and tear the place apart, change trash, and also be expected to stay up front to take orders. No one will cover for me most times. 

I've gotten told to stay up front while doing these tasks and I can't be in two places at once. I'm exhausted. 

I'm constantly irritated by customers who don't know what they want, customers who demand things from me, and customers who say inappropriate things to me.

I get extremely wound up and I've come home angry and emotional. (I'm dealing with depression and possible bipolar on top of this) Should I quit?

1l901wf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l901wf,"Kalita 185 Mino Ceramic. Same Model, Different Performance.","I have two Mino models, Sand Black and Sand Brown. Upon testing, I've seen some differences between them which I wanted to share:

1. Different quality of processing. The brown one looks much nicer in general. On black one fingerprints will be visible and there are some glaze smudges visible under certain lighting - different for everyone due to manufacturing I guess, but Sand Brown version glaze is almost flawless in my case. The edges of the holes are a little rough on the inside in the Black one, while they are nicely rounded on a Brown one, but here comes the next point:

2. The holes in my Sand Brown model turned out to be SMALLER than in the Black version. The draw down time for the black one without a filter (!) is 8 seconds, while for the brown one it is \~12 seconds. So naturally, the brewing time with a filter and coffee in the Brown version is longer than for the black one. Won't tell you exact time comparison, since I only start to test both of them recently but difference in time is apparent when using same brew conditions: grinder is Comandante C40 MK4, 18 grams of beans at 24 clicks (without RedClix) and 300 ml of water.

I cannot say that the second point is an clear disadvantage, but this makes me think that the Kalita Mino Series are not only unique visually due to manufacturing, but also have a unique draw down times from dripper to dripper.

There's no clogging issue on them under same conditions, only difference is in draw down time. Surprisingly, result/drink from Brown one also taste nicer, more balanced.",4,1749666081.0,pourover,2,0.83,False

cute. maybe it’s a dog-friendly cafe or something. I walk in. it smells like lavender and wet fur.

lady at the front desk smiles and goes, “Hey! You must be here for the shadow shift, right?”

twenty minutes in, a woman walks in with a clipboard and says, “Oh yay, you *are* Katie. You’re a natural.”

I nod. because apparently, today I’m Katie.

she goes, “Thanks for jumping in — we’ve been short-staffed all week. You can fill out the onboarding stuff later.” and hands me a shirt.
