Coming from Johannesburg, where we have maybe 3 proper specialty cafés, London felt overwhelming in the best way.

**The standout:** [Calico](https://brewatlas.co/cafe/calico) **in Waterloo**

Went back three times. They're celebrating their first anniversary this month with a special on Geisha pourovers. But honestly it wasn't just the coffee. The staff genuinely knew their stuff and were so welcoming. One of those places where you walk in as a tourist and leave feeling like a regular.

[Nowhere, Dark Arts](https://brewatlas.co/cafe/dark-arts-soho) was the most adventurous - had an espresso from China which I'd never had before. Lovely tea and floral notes. The whole vibe there is different.

Also hit:

* [Rosslyn (21 Royal Exchange)](https://brewatlas.co/cafe/rosslyn-21-royal-exchange): liked it. A great spot if you work newarby
* [Nostos (St James's)](https://brewatlas.co/cafe/nostos-st-jamess): A coffee nerds dream spot

1pqdv2i,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1pqdv2i/those_crucial_opening_lines/,Those crucial opening lines...,"I’d love some thoughts on that oh-so-crucial first page.

I’m writing a science-fiction novel set on Mars, but it’s not an action thriller. No laser battles, no explosions in chapter one. The story opens quietly, with a communications engineer doing his job—routing messages, maintaining systems, and enjoying a brief moment of calm before the day begins.

Here are the opening lines:

\~\~\~\~

Another day on Mars, thought Earnest Whitlow as he sipped his coffee.

He loved the way it brewed. The coffee pot siphoned excess heat from the rows of communications equipment under his care, turning raw energy into something warm and useful. This was his favorite part of the day — before alarms, before complaints, before people needed something from him.

Nothing had gone wrong yet.

\~\~\~\~

My question isn’t whether this is “exciting,” but whether it’s *engaging enough* for readers who don’t expect immediate action.

Is this kind of quiet foreshadowing sufficient to create tension and curiosity? Or does page one need a clearer sense that something is coming—even if it arrives slowly?

More broadly: what are effective ways to hook readers in stories where the danger or conflict is subtle, systemic, or psychological rather than explosive?

I’m trying to avoid both extremes—bonking the reader over the head *or* boring them into setting the book down.

Curious to hear how others approach this.

1pqdqe9,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrthodoxChristianity/comments/1pqdqe9/i_have_some_silly_questions_but_i_really_need/,"I have some silly questions, but I really need advice","I am a college student who's a bit socially awkward and introverted, which is why I have to ask this. I’ve been interested in Orthodoxy for about eight months, but I’ve only been able to visit my closest parish five times.

I’m disabled and currently live with my parents, and my only transportation is our wheelchair van, which my parents need on Sundays to go to their own church. The times I've gone have been when my mom is kind enough to miss her church and drive me. The closest Orthodox parish is about 45 minutes away, so I can't easily set up a ride with someone who has an accessible vehicle. It's a pretty tricky situation, but I should be moving out in 2-3 years once I have a full-time job, so at that point I'll be able to regularly attend liturgy. My parents have been very respectful and accommodating of my beliefs and desire to attend, and I’m very grateful for that.

For several months I’ve tried to live the Orthodox Christian life as best I can. I read beginner books, pray, and watch my parish’s livestreams online most weeks. However, I’ve never spoken to the priest, not even once. I’ve reached the point where I really need to make contact with him for spiritual guidance and to begin establishing that relationship. 

I have visited multiple times but have just not had the time to stay after for coffee hour or anything. One time I was going to approach him after liturgy, but my church is fairly large (about 300-400 people attend weekly) and it became immediately clear that he was flooded with people then and it's not a good time to introduce myself. 

1. When is the best time to talk to a likely very busy priest? Should I email the church office and set up a meeting or is this too small of a thing for a whole appointment? Should I try to catch him during coffee hour or is that usually just as busy? What should I say when I finally get the chance to meet him?
2. I fully believe in the truthfulness of this church and the peace it has brought me, and I want to start my process toward baptism. But I've read that catechesis requires things like consistent attendance which I cannot do right now (trust me, I've tried everything and everyone to work it out but this is just my situation right now). Does that mean I’m ineligible to become a catechumen until my situation changes, or can accommodations be made in cases like this? If I am, it's alright and I can wait but I'd just love the opportunity to be baptized and receive the Eucharist as soon as I am able so I want to make absolutely sure I can't start the process yet before I give up. Is this a cut-and-dry thing or is it parish dependent? Should I ask the priest when I talk to him?

I totally acknowledge that I have made some mistakes in this process and should have made contact with the priest much earlier. It has just been so difficult for me trying to find a way for me to even make it to church and I've been so busy with school but I am at the point now where I need to take action and make something happen.

Even if I can't make any progress towards baptism I need to make contact with the priest so I have him as a contact and resource, and be able to have peace knowing I've done what I can right now and just need to wait until I reach the next phase of my life. I just honestly don’t know how to approach this or what the expectations are, and I’d really appreciate any advice. Sorry this is so long, I just wanted to explain the entire situation for context.

Hi, everyone. 

I'll soon have a 29 hour stop over in doha starting on a Friday evening. 

I wanted to ask, what are some good hotels to book that would not take me too far from the airport and also let me explore the city?

Is crowne plaza a good hotel?

Also, what should I explore in the city during my stop? Please give me some nice places. 
What would be good on a Friday evening and Saturday day time?

Also, what are some nice places to eat at? I'm looking for restaurants that are 100% halal and hand slaughtered. 
Is everything 100% halal in Qatar?
If there's Mandi or camel meat somewhere, that would be great too. 

Also, please give me some good coffee places known in the city and also for breakfast. 

Also, anything else you'd like to add, please share. 

I've always loved Qatar and have always wanted to visit. Want to make the most of my time there. 

Please help, it'll be deeply appreciated.

**Parsing the Odds: Why Oregon’s Spread Feels Like a Math Test**  
Let’s start with the numbers. Oregon is a **-21.5-point favorite**, a spread so steep it makes a rollercoaster look tame. On DraftKings, the Ducks are priced at **+1.05** on the moneyline, implying a **\~50.2% chance to win**—a number that screams “safe bet” louder than a parent at a sleepover. James Madison, meanwhile, is a **+10.5 underdog**, with implied odds of **\~8.7%**. To put that in perspective, JMU’s chances of pulling off the upset are about the same as me correctly spelling “Eugene” without checking my phone.

The total is set at **47.5 points**, and with Oregon’s offense averaging 42.3 PPG and JMU’s defense allowing just 17.8 PPG (per ESPN FPI), this game could either be a laugher or a defensive clinic. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves—this is Oregon we’re talking about. Their November sweep of Iowa, USC, and Washington was so dominant, it made a Power Five coach mutter, “Why are we even here?” into his coffee.

**Digesting the News: Injuries, Schedules, and the “David vs. Goliath” Myth**  
Oregon’s return to full strength is a **medical miracle**. Dakorien Moore, Gary Bryant Jr., and company are back from injuries, transforming the Ducks from “meh” to “marauding war machine.” Their lone loss? A valiant defeat to the nation’s only undefeated team—like losing a chess match to a grandmaster who’s also your boss.

James Madison, meanwhile, is the college football version of a viral TikTok: impressive, but built on a shaky foundation. The Dukes’ schedule was so soft, it’s ranked **121st in FBS toughness**—which is like training for a marathon by sprinting to the fridge. Their only Power Five win? A 23-20 nail-biter over Louisville, a team that still lost to a group of high schoolers in a scrimmage.

QB Alonza Barnett III is a dual-threat dynamo (21 TD passes,

**""scene""**  
Camille and Isla sit close together on a small couch in a Parisian living room, knees angled toward a low coffee table where a chessboard is set up correctly between them. The camera is positioned low and centered, slightly back from the table, so the chessboard occupies the foreground with the two women framed naturally beyond it. Camille is mid-reach toward a piece, leaning slightly forward, while Isla sits back against the couch, watching the board and glancing playfully toward the camera. The moment feels candid and intimate, like a pause during a long evening rather than a posed setup. Warm interior lighting and muted city glow from tall windows create soft highlights and gentle shadows across skin, hair, fabric, wood, and glass.

A lived-in Parisian apartment living room with tall French windows, pale plaster walls, and subtle decorative molding. A carved marble fireplace sits off to one side with framed artwork casually leaning on the mantel. A narrow bookshelf holds worn French paperbacks, vinyl records, and art books. A café-style bistro chair is pushed back near the wall, and a muted vintage rug grounds the seating area. The space feels unmistakably Parisian through proportion, age, and restraint rather than overt symbolism.

**""props""**  
A classic wooden chessboard placed squarely on the low coffee table between the couch and camera, pieces mid-game and correctly oriented to the players; scattered drink glasses and bottles including wine glasses and a half-finished bottle on the table and nearby surfaces; a folded newspaper and slim art magazine partially visible.

1pqd8lj,https://i.redd.it/flzm3a8hl38g1.jpeg,CreepCast Cryptid: The Can Man,"It all started with my dad asking me if I wanted to go on a week long ""father/son adventure"" which I happily agreed to. I obviously wanted to go to spend time with my dad without my siblings being involved but my ulterior motive was to have time away from my classmates, due to my Jacobi incident at a sleepover I went to a week prior. At the time he kept it a secret as to where we were headed but now I'm thinking if I knew at the time I would've chicken out. We packed our things for the week, said our goodbyes and headed off to somewhere that I later found out to be my grandfather's woods, who had passed away years ago. That week out of my summer was the most frightening experience I've had and I'm glad we are never going back.



  We drive down a gravel road with miniature rocks striking the car, as the towering trees appear around us covering any sunlight coming through we turn down a familiar dirt road and past thoughts start flooding my mind. Memories of my grandpa swarm my head but one memory in particular sticks out, three years ago on my birthday grandpa gave me a deer skull and told me an old tale relating to an experience he's had. Long ago tribes believed that a person who performs the taboo of consuming the flesh of another human turns into a beast who can steal the voice and possibly the likeliness of their victims, many imitating traits of different animals. According to grandpa he saw one of these beasts biting into the intestine of a deer he shot while hunting and the deer skull was a trophy of him surviving to tell the experience. Now I love my grandpa, he is my hero and the reason I love horror to the point that's all I talk about but at a point I grew to take his stories as fiction but recently I'm starting to believe them to be true. That was the last birthday I spent with him and the first time coming back to his home, which now was overgrown and withering away like an ancient ruin.



  Pulling up the driveway I nervously asked dad, ""Are we going to be staying in grandpa's house?"" With a laugh he responds, ""No don't worry there's a double wide down the hill that we are staying at until we are done cleaning the home."" He then noticed my disappointment when I realized I'd be spending the week doing chores and tried to motivate me with a ""it will help you build character"" speech that did not work. After he believes that he inspired me we head down to the spare home to unpack our things, learning that I'd have my own room I go to quickly decorate it with my books, little knick knacks and the deer skull. For the first night dad wanted to relax so I got SpaghettiOs and headed to my room to sleep for the night. Laying down on the cusp of slumber I suddenly jolted up hearing a rhythmic tapping on my window next to me, terrified I glanced at the window only to discover a lone twig from a bush grazing the bottom of the window, satisfied I went back to sleep.



  Waking up the next day with regret of agreeing to go on this trip suddenly faded as the smell of bacon and eggs allured me out of my room. I discover my dad in the kitchen whistling a song I do not know while cooking, noticing me he greets with an enthusiastic ""RAISE AND SHINE SPORT"" and hands me a plate of an attempt at a smiley face. Scarfing down the food, barely listening to dad telling me about the plan for the house, fear sets in as the only things I could understand are the dangers the house brings as part of the second floor is starting to collapse. He grabs cleaning gear as he orders me to grab some boxes and we head up to the house, looking back at the window to my room I discern that there is no shrubbery of any kind under it. Catching up to dad quickly I attempted to tell him about last night but ended up coming out as gibberish from panic and slight fatigue. With what he made out his response of ""Must've been a nightmare bud"" did not reassure me but neither was the thing we found once we opened the door.



  Opening to darkness my dad grabs the flashlight and turns it on to illuminate the living room now covered in dust and mildew, comparing to what I knew then to now I gasp as I recognize a key item missing, the couch but now replaced with a cot. Dad, not saying a word, steps into the home and with each creak of wood made as he stepped slowly turned into metal clanging together. Aiming the flashlight at the ground it exposed the massive sea of tin cans littered all over the floor then slowly lifting the flashlight back up showed the state of the cot, corn, pasta sauce, soups of various kinds and a chilis worth of beans stained all over it. With a sigh dad proclaims, ""It's just someone who doesn't have a home, I'll move this you clean the cans up,"" and grabs the cot and places it outside while I began picking up cans and discover unusual ways they've been opened. With dads help we cleaned the cans up quickly and moved on to working on cleaning the rest of the first floor, the entire time I could hear faint sounds of metals tapping on the ground above us. Unsure if it was my imagination or the panic already formed but walking past the stairs and looking up I could vaguely make out a face looking right back at me with hunger.



  We decided to take a break and I insisted we go outside which dad thankfully agreed to. As we did we could hear sirens coming closer to us with a police vehicle down the road. Arriving and getting out a police officer approaches us and questions my father with our reasoning for being here, with some explanation the officer tone switches as he pulls my dad off to the side so I couldn't hear their conversation. They then head down to the spare house with dad forcing me to stay in my room, even with my ear up to the door I couldn't understand anything they were saying. After some time dad comes into my room and asks me a question where I knew I couldn't say no, ""You want to go on that adventure and explore?""



  Showing up at an unfamiliar part of the woods all dad told me was we were searching for something that I could smell before witnessing it, which he informed me the smell was of rotting fruits and vegetables. Begging him to let me go on my own he gave me a walkie talkie to let him know if I run into any danger or get too scared. Not wanting to disappoint him I headed off in the opposite direction he went to investigate more of the area and began searching everywhere, even lifting rocks as at the time I didn't know what I was looking for. Time passes and I quickly get bored when I look up and see a herd of deer off in the distance, from a distance I follow the herd. Not knowing how long I've been tailing the deer I realize the sky starts to turn darker and determine that I am lost in the middle of the woods. Looking down to grab the walkie talkie my nose gets bombarded with the scent of decay and as I look back up I see hiding behind a tree a strange looking man staring right into my eyes.



  As our eyes lock on to each other we both stay motionless, me out of the fear coursing through my veins but for him my only thought is out of morbid curiosity. The motion of clicking the button on the walkie causes the man to screech as he begins to run towards me, I drop the device as I begin to sprint away from the lunatic. After a while I glance back to see the man on all fours still pursuing me, turning my head forward I suddenly start falling as I trip on something. Not wasting any time I pick myself back up at the same time getting a whiff of the same rotting fruit and vegetable smell dad was talking about. Terror overtaking my curiosity I continue to run with all the energy I can muster not looking back even if the thought of him catching up overtakes my thoughts. A miracle happened as I can see the opening appear with a road full of cars, my dad standing at the end with a look of confusion and I scream for him tears flowing down my cheeks.



  I tackle him with a hug, tears staining his shirt I don't let go, he embraces me back and asks me about what happened so I tell him everything. My eyes start to clear as I notice a group of officers had begun to surround us, one with a notepad who had finished writing as soon as I was done with my story then put a hand on my dads shoulder to pull him to the side. Tears form again but another officer kneels down and starts to chat with me, I end up telling him a story about these spelunkers drilling a hole in a cave and he seemed interested. Dad returns and informs me, ""That man shouldn't be around anymore, you're safe with me,"" I foolishly believed him. We head back to the spare home, in my room I hang up extra blankets over the window and as my eyes begin to grow heavy my heart spikes as I hear the tapping once more.



  In the morning I tear down the blankets to reveal yet again nothing under the window. Leaving the room I find dad sitting at the dinner room table his eyes off elsewhere with a barely touched coffee next to him. He looks over and quickly puts on his best fake smile and clearing his throat asks, ""You fine with cereal for today champ,"" ""Yeah that's okay with me,"" I respond with concern. ""Sorry about not having an extravagant meal today, trying to save energy to finish the house,"" he said, adding a forced wink. Finishing breakfast we gather the equipment and head up to the house, before we reach the home I ask, ""Do you hear any tapping noises at night?"" He thinks for a moment then shakes his head asking me the same question. Before I can answer dad opens the door and instantly drops the flashlight. I looked up to see what the light was revealing, the stained cot with a walkie talkie laying on top.



  We both throw out the cot with the walkie, dad then checks every room and closet in the house to find no one hiding around. After searching dad tasked me to clean the main floor as he goes and tackles the second, heading to the kitchen I start to check through the cabinets. Finding nothing I reach the last cabinet when I hear muffled noises from inside, I stare at it not wanting to know what is inside. My hand gradually goes towards the handle with every noise disappearing as my heart is beating out of my chest, opening it slowly the only thing I notice is the same lifeless eyes I'd seen in the forest looking directly into mine. A scream starts to brew inside but a long, dark sharp finger goes over the man's mouth commanding my silence, the only noise that can be heard is my dad scavenging upstairs. After observing each other for what felt like hours the man finally spoke in a whisper, ""Do you h-have any f-food?""



  I don't answer as I'm too mesmerized by how he managed to stay in the cabinet for as long as he did. With no response from me he whispers again, ""Do you h-have any f-food, I'm s-starving?"" this time tilting his head slightly copying the same way a pet begs for a meal. Sounding like him I quietly stuttered my answer, ""W-we have s-some canned b-beans at the o-other place."" His eyes glow with excitement as he lunges out of the cabinet, thinking he was about to attack me I flinch but realize he landed next to me with a clank of his tin can shoes. He gets up and as he stands up straight but his back is crooked like a hook and his stomach bulging out not fitting his slender frame, the noises of his stomach acid settling like gurgles of mouthwash. Beginning to shake, I hesitantly lead the man towards the door and muster my words to not sound fearful I yell to dad that I'm using the restroom and head outside with the stranger.



  Arriving at the spare home I head into the kitchen to grab a can of red beans and a can opener then head into my room to catch the man observing the space, mainly focused on the deer skull hanging up. ""Y-your n-name is I-Isaiah r-right?"" he suddenly asked me and a shiver came over me causing the can and can opener to drop on the floor. Slowly I began to back up as the man's head instantly turned but not looking at me, eyes turning primal locked directly at the can like a predator finally catching their prey. He then pounces on the can like a feral cat and grips the can in his deformed hand, with his sharp index finger he pierces the top of the can and like a mechanical can opener uses his other fingers to rotate the cylinder until the lid pops off. Then he tilts his head back and turns the can 180 degrees making all the liquid inside flow out drenching his already ruined clothes. Slowly but surely the contents from inside slide out maintaining it's cylinder form and with a loud plop sound enters his mouth perfectly. With a loud gulp the red beans vanish, the room in almost silence as the noises of the slop traveling through his esophagus and stomach acid dissolving linger throughout my room.



  The animalistic instincts leave him as his eyes transform back and realizes the mess he made and attempts to clean it up but is struggling like an infant learning to walk. I end up helping him clean up and once we finish I hurry us out of the home but he stops me to apologize for his actions. Suddenly all of my fear began to turn into pity so I made a deal with him, ""I will bring you food until I leave but you have to promise to keep himself away from my dad, he's been stressed and don't want to add more."" He smiles a toothless grin and agrees to the terms as he jumps up and down in joy, making metal clanking sounds every time he lands. We head to the house and part ways as I finish packing and cleaning for the day. Walking back with dad I can tell he still seems distracted by something but ruffles my hair when he notices my attention drawn to him, heading in dad tells me to make a can of something as he goes into his room and shuts the door, I do as I'm told. Reading about a ranger who found random stairs in the woods I get interrupted by a familiar tapping sound at the window. Finally putting two and two together I look down the window to find the strange man there with his toothless smile.



  The rest of the week ended up becoming a routine for me, waking up and eating breakfast, packing and cleaning the house, eating while sneaking food to Can Man which is the nickname I decided to give him, continuing to pack and clean and finish the night with dinner and reading stories to Can Man. Throughout the week dad started to act like his normal self even though I would catch him reading a folder repeatedly. Can Man every night would crawl through my window, crawl like a 4 legged spider, then I would hand him a can of whatever as he sat there ingesting his food and I would tell him stories, both myself and others made to entertain him. Also every night Can Man would ask me to join him in the woods which I would kindly decline every time, the last night I was there after finishing one of my grandfathers stories I caught Can Man staring at the deer skull again and without breaking his gazed asked me again, ""I-Isaiah w-would you p-please j-join me in the w-woods, I am l-lonely h-here and y-you've b-been a g-good f-friend?"" When I go to say my answer Can Man's eyes lock with mine and I could tell if I said no it would not end up good for me. My quick thinking saved me as I counter offered that instead I could give him the deer skull as he seemed interested in it, after a long pause Can Man agreed and sat down as he stuck his long tongue out to clean the can the was eating. At the end of his stay he grabbed the deer skull and before lunging out the window he turned his head like an owl and said without any stuttering, ""You're too much like your grandfather you know,"" and left. Thinking back now the tone in his voice was filled with malice rather than sincerity.



   In the morning dad and I pack up his car with more things than we brought. I look up at the attic window to find Can Man wearing the deer skull waving slowly at me, he looks more stretched out with his skin as pale as snow. Finishing up we drive away from the house and with one last glance at the window I find no one there anymore. After we turn back to the gravel road dad sighs as he looks at me and asks, ""Son, we were there for a week and all of our canned food has ended up disappearing, you wouldn't happen to know anything about this?"" I nervously responded, ""I was sneaking them to a friend,"" as soon as I finished the sentence my dad jerked, making the car swerve as he almost slammed on the brakes out of shock, ""WHAT? YOU BETTER EXPLAIN YOURSELF BOY!"" ""T-the Can M-man, he has a c-can opener for a h-hand,"" was all I could stutter keeping my eyes away from him. For a second his face was covered with confusion then in relief he started laughing thinking I fabricated another monster. We banter back and forth for awhile trying to pry more information and after some convincing and a promise to never tell mom about it he told me everything he thought I could handle. Our ""exploring adventure"" was actually a search party for a corpse, which was also the thing I tripped over while running away from their main suspect. I'm glad my curiosity didn't overtake me that day, the smell alone already haunts me knowing Can Man's shirt wasn't just stained with rotten food. Dad stopped to use the restroom and my interest in this led me to regretting my search as I found the folder he was reading. The cover had the name of the county's police station on it and inside was a lot of documents that I tried skimming through but didn't understand any of it, the only thing I did understand was the polaroid photos of the crime scene in the woods. Any remorse I had for Can Man vanished as I saw the picture of the body with their head carved out to have the scalp flopped to the side revealing a cracked pink stained skull, brain matter vaguely present inside. I don't know what Can Man is but it was far from human.

I'm 18 now, very inexperienced in relationships and rather socially inept in general. I finished sixth form in June this year, and I dealt with two very predatory guys back then. I didn't even realize just how obsessive and sadistic their fixations on me were. One was this guy I always silently thought was a horrible person for the many years he had been my classmate. He realized I looked down on him one day and spent countless months prolonging revenge on me to ''even the score''. The other was my long-term crush of 2 years who was an external to our sixth form.

The funny thing about my crush is he seemed so sweet, kind, polite, reserved. It was all a mask. He was a self-conscious, insecure and reserved guy yes, but he wasn't a shy one. Him and I had long-term sexual tension that I mistook for ''deeper'' feelings. I was the one who wanted deeper connection, he just wanted to fuck me and maintain ownership and control over my body, warmth, attention and energy. Our dynamic was so messy, I never let him in despite desperately wanting him (because of my own insecurities + awareness of his girlfriends + confusion about his intensity despite girlfriends and him never initiating). He'd open doors for me and nervous laugh if his hand slipped, he'd eavesdrop on me and watch all my interactions in class, he'd go crazy checking me out (obvious stuttering, zoning out while his mates were staring at him, leg bouncing, having to look away from me to regain composure... I used to think it was cute), he noticed all my mood shifts and I'd notice his. I used to hate myself for it, I'd see how it ate him up, how ''hurt'' he was about how everyone got my warmth but his was sporadic, but looking back I am so fortunate I didn't.

The long-term resentment and sexual frustration exploded when we were ending the final year. He went on a whole sadistic revenge campaign against me with predatory guy no.1 (who was his friend) all because he realized I still cared about him and he wanted to make me hurt for not giving him what he wanted, when he wanted it. He even had a whole girlfriend when they did this (so did guy no.1).

He persisted frequently. He and guy no.1 spread horrible rumours calling me an unstable, manipulative tease who plays games and within certain male-dominated circles they were properly dehumanizing me. I was treated horribly, like the ''unstable, obsessed girl who throws herself at taken guys and flaunts with her body/clothes/looks'' by a significant amount of our year group.

He knew vulnerabilities and mental health issues of mine just from observing/secretly stalking me, so whenever I was clearly scared or anxious and avoidant towards him, he'd just spread more whispers about my self-harm, or my suicidal ideation, or the emo playlist on my spotify profile (I should've privated that lol).

In class he'd constantly glance back and give me provocative glances and sexualized looks. He genuinely terrified me, but the whole thing blindsided me so bad that I tried to convince myself that maybe we were both hurt and that he just wanted me and that if I just submitted I'd be ''safe'' and he'd be sweet again because we'd be bonded by pain. I blamed myself for his cruelty because I told myself I ''hurt him'' back then (even though he had girlfriends out of school the whole time...). We studied at the same coffee shop during the A-Level exam period and he'd still be doing weird attention-seeking shit to get my attention. At one point he even moved from where he was studying to sit behind my seat for 2 minutes. It was so stressful and was triggering my paranoia.

I even wanted to talk to him in private and hope he'd confess he ''cared'' still and that he was sorry. Thank God I trusted my subconscious gut feeling despite the self-doubt. I don't remember the last time I had felt that much pain. He HATED me being happy too. It was as if he either wanted my warmth/attention all to himself, or to completely annihilate it. They even doubled down mid-exam period because I kept openly showing disdain towards predator no.1 and kept ignoring/avoiding him.

I maintained composure, had to cut off all my year group but my 3 real friends to survive and maintain my sanity. I didn't even do as well in my A-Levels as I should have because I was so dysregulated. I was fortunate I got into uni. Unfortunately he knew my patterns, that I was hurt underneath it all  and sometimes I yielded and I think he got the sense of victory he wanted. I last saw him almost 4 months ago, but the whole thing still sits in the back of my mind. I felt so humiliated, giving him what he wanted after everything while he loves up his new girlfriend.

I don't think I've ever dealt with healthy, consistent interest from a guy. In the past I'd either mess it up, not let things grow, or I'd fall for volatile guys like predator no.2. He was the worst of them all though. I'm tired. I'm so naive in general and this is just an additional aspect that could really get me messed up in the future.

It took me so long to accept that this even happened to me. I tried to cope by telling myself that he was ''in love'' with me but just handled it badly, or filling myself with pride and rage, or suppressing my feelings entirely. It scarred me for months and even though I've moved on in life I don't think I'll forget (atleast not with the mindset I have now). How do I protect myself better in the future? I don't want to go through this again if I can manage it :(.",1,1766122394.0,women,0,1.0,False

I’m a 32 year old guy in San Diego looking for a female chat buddy who enjoys easy conversation, friendly banter, and getting to know someone beyond small talk. I have been in SD for about a year now and I love it here. It would be awesome to meet fellow San Diegans, but if you are from somewhere else that is totally fine too.

A few things about me:

I am the kind of person who loves learning how things work and I enjoy talking to people who are curious about the world.

Outside of work, I am usually gaming, taking photos, or hanging out with my two cats. I go fishing when I can, I catch shows around the city, and I am always searching for a new coffee spot to try. I drink my coffee black most days, but once fall hits I am absolutely ordering something pumpkin flavored.

I am a big movie person. I am into anything from Pixar, Nolan, Spielberg, Anderson, Hitchcock, Kubrick, or Tarantino (and of course I love Finding Nemo). When it comes to TV, I bounce between sci fi, dumb reality shows, classic cartoons, and adult cartoons. Think Firefly, Westworld, The Expanse, Looney Tunes, Rick and Morty, South Park, Smiling Friends.

I like plants, I drive a stick shift, and I enjoy a good steak dinner. Thanksgiving is my favorite holiday and there is no chance of convincing me otherwise.

If you are thinking about messaging me, here are a few easy ways to start the conversation:

• Tell me about your favorite band or show

• Tell me your go-to coffee order

• Tell me something small that made your day better

• Or just introduce me to your pets.

1pqcxbr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1pqcxbr/am_i_wrong/,Am I wrong?,"So let me give you a back story as to how my relationship has been and how I am so that you can decide whether I’m just overly sensitive or right in feeling the way I do.

My husband and I have very different personalities and were raised very different. He was raised to think about himself over others while I was raised to help others. For example, he will never volunteer because he gets nothing out of it, he has said this himself. He also doesn’t really have empathy towards others. He only understands what he is going through and feels that he deserves more than he actually works for. His parent give him everything. To this day they continue to do huge things for him. This includes me as well but I would rather struggle and work for our things because I know that we tried and got something through our own strength and effort. His parents just gave us a car because we needed a safer car for winter driving. This is a very new and expensive car that belonged to his mom and she loved. She just signed it over to him. About 3 years ago they had given us an old car of theirs as well so that we could have two vehicles. 

I am benefiting from these things but I would rather go without because it makes him feel entitled. He didn’t go to college but thinks he should get paid more at his job and is smarter than everyone there. 

He also thinks I am at fault every time we have a fight. One example is when I was severely depressed from moving across the country away from my family and I was left to take care of our two young girls and everything at home. I had no friends, no car and no help. I also had to make very complicated meals for his lunch, have dinner ready and served for when he got home at 3 am and keep my girls quiet until he got up at 1 in the afternoon. Keep in mind my girls were 3 and almost 2, we lived in a 1,000 sq ft apartment that we didn’t get to leave unless I walked and pushed them in their stroller after he left to work with our only car. (I had a car but he made me sell it before we moved away). 
Anyway, most days I had a lot to deal with and after taking care of everything, making him lunch from scratch and getting my girls to bed I still had to make sure I made a dinner that he would like. He wouldn’t just eat what I made for us girls. So I’d stay up till midnight cooking and be up through the night taking care of our youngest type 1 diabetic daughter  then get up and take care of them both alone again. 

At times I wouldn’t make exactly what he wanted or there would be leftovers and not plated food but there was always an option to eat something substantial. He would get mad at me and make me feel worthless. He did it so much I got more and more depressed. He told me i needed to talk to someone and he blamed my depression on our kids. When I wanted to visit my family he got mad because I wouldn’t  ask my family to just drive us around everywhere even if we had our own car because he was afraid that with our license plates being from another state we would get robbed. He yelled at me and told me to leave back to California but I couldn’t take the kids. 

I have become very forgetful and I make a lot of mistakes. To him they’re big mistakes that call for him to make me feel like I need to change who I am. 
I lost a credit card and he still reminds me to this day. He laughs when I say I’m capable of doing things and he has always put down the work that I want to do. I wanted to do bookkeeping and he said it wasn’t worth it. I wanted to do transcribing and he said I wouldn’t be able to do enough to make enough money. I wanted to work and he said I had to take care of our girls and I could only work if his mom stayed with us to help. 

He never felt bad missing his family because he only cares about his mom and she basically lives with us half the year. 

We bought a house (again with his parent’s help and our savings) and we have a guest room that is half his mom’s room and half guest room. It’s supposed to be a guest room but his mom has her things in there and has even put up her grandkids pictures and things she’s been given. She has basically taken it over. This is fine as she really does deserve it. My only problem is that when my family has come to visit it has been an issue with having them sleep in that room. I specifically told him before we took his parent’s help that the room would be for his mom but also a guest room. 

Now my dad is visiting for the first time in 6 years (his mom is here 3 months at a time and done about twice a year). I had told my husband that my dad would take the guest room while his mom is at his sister’s house. This way I’m not just kicking her out. I felt this was a fair way to do it and he didn’t say no. In fact I remember him agreeing but now I’m not so sure. To get to the point finally, he decided that he would sleep in that room while his mom is gone. He put out girls in our room and said my dad could sleep in one of their rooms while our girls sleep with me in the master bedroom. Oh yeah he also doesn’t sleep next to me because he says our bed is too hard, I toss and turn too much and wake him and our girls come in when they’re scared and wake him and he needs his sleep. 

He also got mad at me for giving my dad our toothpaste (in hindsight I guess I should have looked for a new one for sanitary reasons) but I didn’t. He told me he didn’t think it was right that my dad had to share our germs and he didn’t want my dad’s germs. He said he wouldn’t share toothpaste with his mom either but get this, I see his toothbrush in the bathroom next to the guest room and her toothpaste is there. He hasn’t come to our room to use our bow brand new toothpaste and so I tell him oh do you need to get the toothpaste from our room and he says no why. I tell him well your mom’s toothpaste is the one that’s there so have you already brushed your teeth. He says sometimes I just don’t use toothpaste at night when I brush. Then I said but you said you do that in the morning sometimes so do you just not use toothpaste? He said it just happens that way sometimes.

Recently he also made me feel horrible about wanting to go on a trip to see my friends. I mean this is a big trip and it would be costly. He hasn’t expressed his dislike for Britain because I used to live there with an ex. I have very bad memories there but also very good ones and I have grown to just focus on the good. He got mad that I wanted to go on my own and when on and on about how he never wants to do anything without me but I’m always trying to do things without him. I didn’t want to go without my family but I really want to see my friends again and it would be too costly for all of us to go. I figured if I went for under a week I could work a second job to save up and finally see my friends again. He told my girls I wanted to leave them which made them cry. I mean I have seen moms go on trips, it doesn’t mean they hate their family. I don’t do anything for myself aside from buy a coffee here and there and color my own hair with boxed dye. 

He tells me that I stress him out and I’m the cause of his stress outside of work. I just don’t see how but I wish I could record our lives so that people could tell me if I’m doing things wrong.  

Am I really actually selfish? Am I such a screw up that I cause stress in our family because i volunteer and don’t cook a meal one day at home? 

Honestly I feel like if I sound like I’m just saying bad things about him and not enough about me I can add more but I felt this was a good place to start.

Last week we posted about the new coffee shop we’ve opened in the area. A few of you asked if we’d be doing any small events or activities, so we wanted to run some ideas by you before planning anything.

These are a few low-key options we’re considering,during or after cafe hours:
1. Book reading hour – Bring your own book or pick one from our small collection.
2. Vision board for 2026 – We provide art supplies and printouts to cut and create your own vision board.
3. Vinyl night – Playing music on vinyl, relaxed listening and conversations.
4. Board game / card game night – Either casual play or a small friendly competition.
5. Coffee tasting evening – A small group tasting a few brews, slow and informal.

Would you be interested in any of these?
Which one excites you the most, or is there something else you’d like to see?

They’re both clearly older women who claim to be mature and educated, but are not. I hear them every morning. It’s always something bad about me, my twin sister, or sometimes—not often—my older sister (20f). 

My mom was upset no one made coffee for her this morning. She was also upset no one made her breakfast or dinner last night. Even though she makes my older sister make all the meals while me and my twin do 90% of the chores, alongside all three of us being full time students. My mom recently started a part time job at a retail store after being jobless for five years and a year before that, had been kicked out of university for failing. For some reason, I think she thinks she deserves the meals. But never in my years of school had I come home to her making a meal. It was always my older sister doing it. 

Recently, one of my two dogs got sick. We’d taken him to the vet, the second time this year for blockage. If my sisters and I aren’t watching him, which is usually only when we’re in class (online), but we try our best, my mom sits and doesn’t pay attention to them. Nor does she contribute to chores. 

Just a couple days ago, I’d hung out with my grandma. I told her everything about my mom. And I wouldn’t have cared about them speaking badly about me if it was my mom’s mom. But it’s not. It’s my dad’s mom. My dad is in jail, he’s been in and out since he was 14, and was rarely ever in my life. 

I’m not sure what my mom told my grandma this morning, but during my second period, I got a call from my grandma. I messaged with a good morning and apologized for not answering, and saying I was in class. I got a voicemail saying I was using school as an excuse, and I wasn’t taking care of my dogs?? Id woken up late and was in pain. I’d missed my hormonal pill one day, but took it as scheduled the next. I’m getting cramps and all that stuff, on top of coming down with a flu. 

My mom told my grandma about how she didn’t get food or coffee. My grandma proceeded to say, over the voicemail, that I’m acting like a nine year old and being immature and disrespectful. Then, I got a series of messages about how my sisters and I are abusers. I tried to explain I was in pain, but she said it was an excuse. More messages, and I never responded. 

I just don’t see why I should do something for my mom that she has never done for me. 

The messages made me break down in the middle of my teacher speaking to me. The hormonal pills mess with my hormones, of course. I cried for almost an hour because I didn’t understand what I did wrong. I love my dogs, and would never harm them in any way. They’re my soulmates. 

I haven’t spoken to my mom since this morning, and I want to block my grandma. I can’t do the calls, the messages, the lies. She’s always taken my mom’s side and believed anything she told her.

I spent $340 ish and got the following gifts :

\- ninja dual coffee maker pro (he uses pods and mentions he wants coffee pot but is also recently into tea)

\- coffee grounds

\- apron (he mentioned he wanted one)

\- scrabble dictionary (we look up words and debate through multiple links)

\- blank cards (he writes cards to people for milestones or celebrations)

\- a light up gamer tag to put over his PC (games almost everyday)

\- stocking stuffers of snacks, travel necessities, candle

\- a few toys for his cat

Is this normal or too little? He is a very generous gift giver for no reason and covers a lot of things up to $160 value. As an example : digital film camera, purse, massage gun, home robe jacket. He also paid for decorations so we could make his place  christmassy for me!

I’m pretty sure he’s spending more on me and I don’t mind spending a bit more but this is still the most I’ve spent on anyone for Christmas. His birthday is in January and we are also going on a trip in January where he is paying 60-70% of the costs approximately. I’m super grateful and want him to feel appreciated!

Also for his family we are gifting gifts from both of us but our agreement was I just pay $25 per gift (both parents, 2 siblings) and some are upwards $100-$300 value. Is this ok? I feel kinda bad having my name on it when I paid only $25 and I don’t want his family to think I went crazy when I havent know them a year but it was his idea. I know the got me a few gifts and a stocking.

First of all: nothing cliché about those goals. 🙂

I’m a habit & lifestyle coach (15 years in fitness, Pilates & nutrition), and my biggest advice is simple: **start small. Like, ridiculously small.** Pick **one goal** and make it **specific**.

Instead of “I’m cutting sugar,” try one sugar-free day per week or upgrading just one meal, e.g. swapping one habit (sweet coffee to sugar-free, Coke to soda water with lime)

**Trying to do too much and everything perfectly from day one is usually why people quit. Progress beats extremes.**

Seeing posts like this made me realise I want to create more *free, genuinely helpful* resources for people who want to build better habits. Not another “do everything” plan.  
  
I have a lot of experience and genuinely want to give back, but I want to build something people truly need.

So I’m curious:  
👉 What would *actually* help you right now?  
👉 What do you struggle with most when trying to change habits?  
👉 What would make a free program worth your time?

**RECAP**

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/Kfb49vV7UZ): **August 27, 2024**

Throwaway account because I don’t want my boyfriend to find this. I posted this elsewhere but thought this subreddit could help too.

I (28f) and my bf (30m) who we’ll call “Steve” have been together for 2 years and have been living together for 8 months. I was cleaning our apartment when I found a note in the back of a cabinet. For context sake, I’ll copy it below:

“Dear Steve’s Future Girlfriend,

I know it’s you reading this because he’d never clean back here. I’m putting this here because I’m leaving him soon and want to warn you about him:

1) He will not clean
2) He will not listen
3) He will make everything feel like it’s your fault

It’s not your fault, he’s just an incompetent man. I’m leaving him, I suggest you do the same.

Best wishes, Natalia” (name changed)

I read the note and brought it to show to him and hear his response. He immediately ripped it up and said not to listen to it, that she was crazy and untrustworthy. I told him that the fact that he hasn’t found it in the 5 years since they broke up is a red flag to me because it does mean he’s never cleaned back there and that he has been cleaning less and less since I moved in. He told me that it wasn’t a problem before the note, this is just his ex continuing to manipulate and ruin his life and I was letting it work. We continued to argue along the same lines and I eventually left to spend the night at a friend’s place.

Steve has been a great boyfriend so far. He gets along with my family. He has given me gifts and flowers and always tells me how much he loves me. He’s not wrong that the cleaning hasn’t really been brought up before, the note made me realize it had been less and less and that we needed to have a full conversation. He texted me afterwards saying he’s sorry that I felt like I had to leave but that it’s an asshole move for me to take a note over our 2 year relationship and to leave him and our pets alone.

I don’t know what to do or what to believe right now. I’m contemplating trying to find and reach out to Natalia, her name in real life is pretty unique so I think I could find her. Steve thinks I should come back home and let it go, that his past should affect our future. I feel like I could be the asshole because everything Steve has said about Natalia does make it sound like she was manipulative and petty throughout their relationship, but I don’t know what to trust.

Edit: I realized I didn’t clarify enough about the points, especially the cleaning. thought I’d add it here:

When we moved in together 8 months ago, the cleaning was 50/50. Since then, he’s been doing things less and less and I’d say it’s at like 70/30, maybe 60/40 if he listens to me right away (it depends on the week). I have to remind him to do things like bring his plates to the sink or take out the trash and I didn’t have to before. The dishes will pile up unless I do them, to the point he’s had leftover food mold on the plates. 

I’m not a confrontational person so I was just asking him to fix it when it came up. The note made me reflect on it more and try to have an actual full conversation, and I will say I didn’t feel listened to when I talked to him about it. I tried to use the note to start a conversation about cleaning and he got so stuck on that I was listening to his ex instead of him, that he wouldn’t listen to what I think are valid concerns. He thinks I’m letting the note have “confirmation bias” so no matter what he says I’ll think he’s in the wrong.

Also, I didn’t leave him permanently, this all happened yesterday and I only spent one night at a friends because I didn’t feel like our conversation was going anywhere last night and he wouldn’t let me sleep until I let it go. I’m going back today and wanted to get advice and feedback before I do.

Edit 2: I appreciate all these comments with advice. I’m heading back to our place now. My plan is to first apologize for immediately bringing him the note without thinking of his feelings and validate
that it’s hard to have an ex’s message found.

That being said, you’re all right that I’ve been letting the cleaning stuff get away. I don’t want to be in a relationship where I have to ask him repeatedly to clean. It was pointed out to me that he should’ve cleaned the shelves during his move from his ex’s place, the fact that it hasn’t been touched in 5 years is forcing me to take the not seriously. 

I don’t want to throw away 2 years so I am going to ask him to come up with some clear cleaning expectations with me and designated chores. I will make it clear that cleaning is absolutely a deal breaker for me. It’s his decision on how he wants to respond.

I’ll try to update you all. Again, thank you so much for the advice.

**UPDATE:** I followed your advice from the last post and tried to have a calm discussion with Steve. When I apologized for confronting him with the note, he seemed to take that as an admission of guilt and refused to listen to anything else. I had come up with a list of specific instances of not cleaning like many of you suggested, and he said I was using lists just like his manipulative ex did. So yeah, the crazy ex thing you all said was a red flag was definitely true.

When I realized the conversation wasn’t going anywhere, he even tried to block me from leaving. That’s when I knew it was done and left immediately. 2 years down the drain, but I’m glad I had the wake up call before it was too late.

I will let him cool off and then will ask my brother to come with me to grab my things while he’s not there, he has a strict work schedule, so I think it’ll work out. I am planning on leaving a note there, but probably a little longer with the advice to not show it to him. I’m leaving it in the exact same place, so if he doesn’t learn his lesson about cleaning, it’ll come to haunt him. All he has to do is clean.

The biggest surprise out of all of this is that I didn’t reach out to Natalia, she reached out to me. Apparently he borrowed his friend’s phone to call her screaming that she’s ruining his life still. The fact that she blocked him and he still had her number memorized just further confirms he was the crazy ex not her.

Natalia found me on social media and wanted to make sure I was okay and was especially concerned that he’d gaslight me like he tried with her. I thanked her for leaving me the note and saving me time. We scheduled coffee for Thursday afternoon.

I wanted to thank you all again for the advice, especially the person who posted the love is respect website. I took the healthy relationship quiz after our conversation and it wasn’t great. You called out how he was weaning me into an unhealthy relationship so well.

For now, my friend said I can stay until I find a new place. I have emergency savings and a decent job, so I’m in a privileged place when it comes to this messy break up and am just trying to feel grateful for that

Just posted my final update separately, thank you all for everything

**Relevant Comments** 

**Commenter:** So, what is your experience with #2 and #3 of Natalia's note? Did you see some truth in her words there with your own past experiences with Steve?

> **OOP:** He does listen to me I think, like when he gets me flowers, he knows my favorite. We have some hobbies in common and love to talk about them. I feel like the most he’s not listened is in this situation because he refused to get past the fact that I’m “listening to his ex over him”. That being said, since we moved in together I do feel like he’s putting in less effort when it comes to starting conversations or initiating quality time
> 
> To #3, this is hard for me to answer. I think I can be a people pleaser and tend to think things are my fault anyway, but he’s never directly said “that’s your fault” when it comes to conflict.

**OOP responds to the issues she has with her boyfriend’s cleaning after showing him the note**

> **OOP:** Thank you for your feedback, I’m looking for a balanced perspective so I appreciate this comment.
> 
> I did have an issue with his lack of cleaning and have asked him repeatedly to clean up after himself and it hasn’t really improved. I agree that I should have sat down to have this full conversation about it earlier instead of using this note to do so. I’m questioning our relationship based on his response to the note, not the note itself, as he raised his voice a bit. Also other people commented about the letting me go to sleep thing and I’m now also realizing that’s not okay.
>

[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/dGtTy0EM6C): **August 28, 2024 (next day)**

As you can tell by my original post, I like to do things right away. It was definitely a mistake to bring him the note right away, but doing the things I did this morning right away was not a mistake as it allowed me to save my pets.

First, I want to respond to the comments saying I broke up a 2 year relationship over a note and chores. No, I broke up a 2 year relationship because when I tried to come up with solutions to an unequal situation, his response was to yell and try to convince me there was no problem except me. The final straw was when he physically blocked me from leaving the house after he was screaming at me. That is not okay and no one should stay with a man who responds to conflict like that.

The actual update: I wound up texting the post to Natalia last night and she thought it was great. She, like some of you, asked me about the pets. For context, one of the things Steve and I connected on was our love for little creatures. It's why I thought he was such a great guy, because if he could take such intricate care of his lizard, he could do the same with me. I was very wrong. He has one lizard he bought before me and then we bought 2 frogs together. I have a snake I brought with me when I moved in. I was planning on waiting until he cooled down to go grab my things and the frogs and snake, thinking he would never hurt them, but Natalia changed my mind. She said he could get destructive when he's mad and was concerned about the safety of my little guys. I immediately knew I couldn't wait until later this week and reached out for a meeting with the landlord for early this morning.

I wound up facetiming with Natalia last night and we had a long discussion. Natalia is a lawyer and told me that in our state, landlords are required to let me get out of the lease I signed in cases of domestic violence. She also told me that his yelling, gaslighting, and refusing to let me leave are all types of abuse. It's definitely hard for me to sit with that, but the love is respect relationship quiz helped me also realize that a bit more last night. Apparently his constant messaging and control over what I wore and when were signs of abuse too.

Anyway, this morning Natalia volunteered to come talk to the landlord with me alongside my brother. As soon as he heard the word lawyer, he was on top of it and said I could break the lease, but would still have to pay for all of August even though I'm leaving 3 days early. I felt like that was fair. He also messaged Steve to say the apartment needed to be empty for emergency maintenance all day today so I could pack my things. Steve messaged back that he was at work all day and wouldn't be home until 6pm.

When I got into the apartment, it was a mess. He had broken my dishes that I had brought with me on the ground and left the shards laying about. My clothes were ripped up and scattered around our room. It was disgusting and heartbreaking. He left his lizard alone, but opened the tank doors for our frogs and my snake. Luckily the frogs were still chilling in their enclosure, but my snake had gotten loose. This made me the most mad, as she could have gotten cut on the broken plates. I feel so fortunate that she was just hiding in the closet corner and I was able to pack her up safely in her enclosure again. All my things are packed and I'm writing this as my brother drives me back to my friend's house right now.

Natalia told me that she actually left 3 notes, one in the cabinet, one on the underside of the vacuum, and one in the crumb catcher of the toaster. While we were there, we checked to see if the notes were still there. The one on the vacuum was but it looks like Steve did clean out the crumb catcher at least once in the past 5 years. He never told me he had already found a note in our conversations, so it caught me by surprise.

Natalia and I left the vacuum note as is and replaced the cabinet one. I wasn't comfortable leaving my name on a new note, so my addition was a handout on healthy vs unhealthy relationships and a qr code to the quiz that woke me up. (I'll put it in the comments, I'm not sure if I can have an outside link)

Natalia said if he didn't find the notes in those 5 years, especially after the move, he probably won't find them again. I'm inclined to agree, especially given he did find one but then didn't even clean the rest of the house to see if there was anymore. Steve doesn't make sense to me and seeing the state of the apartment really woke me up to the fact that I have no idea who he is. The Steve I knew would never put animals in danger, but I don't think I really ever knew Steve.

To the people saying it's pathetic that I broke up my relationship because of chores and reddit, I encourage you to reflect on the subtle ways that abuse starts. This reddit thread woke me up to it and gave me the resources to get out safely before it got any worse.

I also made an appointment for a therapist. I'm very lucky that my job has good insurance so I should be able to work through this relationship and am hoping to focus on boundaries and my people pleasing habits so I never find myself in this situation again.

To the people wishing that Natalia and I would get together, we had a good laugh about it. Natalia is engaged to a wonderful man who cleans, listens, and reflects. She said there's a phenomenon that when people break up with their awful ex, their soulmate can quickly follow. I'm hoping that's true. Regardless, I do think I got a good friend out of this, especially since Natalia is a snake mom too.

This is my final update. I hope if you learn anything from my experience, it's that abuse doesn't start right away. First there's love bombing, gifts, and pretty words. And then slowly, they test how much you'll put up with. You should never have to put up with anything, especially moldy freaking plates.

TLDR: After ending things due to his behavior, Steve destroyed our apartment and let my snake loose, but I was able to get off the lease and get my things with Natalia's help. Now I am safe and am looking for a new place to live.

**Relevant Comments** 

**Commenter:** Natalia received the assignment ""Demonstrate sisterhood"" and aced the test.

I am so sorry that Steve proved all of us, including Natalia, right on how crappy he is.

Can you go after him for the destruction of property?

> **OOP:** Honestly, I just want to put this behind me. Most of the clothes were ones he bought me. I thought they were sweet gifts, but looking back on it, I’m realizing he pushed my style out for the one he prefers. He liked to dress me exactly the way he wanted so I’m okay leaving the clothes behind. I can get new dishes and new clothes that fit me. I have my pets and that’s all that matters to me

[One last update](https://www.reddit.com/user/ThrowRA-ex-note/comments/1fhroez/one_last_update/): **September 20, 2024 (nearly one month later)**

One last update: I read this quote that said “many survivors have been motivated to heal by the courage of other survivors. Every time a survivor reveals her history to a friend, stands up in front of a group to tell her story, writes a book, or brings a lawsuit against abusers (or the institutions that allow abuse to occur), she inspires other survivors to break the silence.”

This stuck with me so much, especially after seeing the comments of people sharing their experiences or realizing that they needed to evaluate their relationship. So I wanted to post this here, just in case my story can help another person the way that Natalia and you all helped me.

I haven’t posted in a while. I don’t know if anyone will see this, but I wanted to get it off my chest. I’m hoping this isn’t too rambling, I’ll go in chronological order.

When we went to his apartment, I took pictures of all the damage. Natalia told me I could press charges is I wanted. She couldn’t represent me due to conflict of interest, but that she’d find me someone good. I didn’t want to at first.

Then I saw a comment saying making a report can create a record that would help a potential future girlfriend be believed if something happened. Natalia saved me. I wanted to do the same. So a couple days later I pressed charges.

The police went to interview steve and the landlord. The destroyed apartment combined with police was enough for the landlord to evict him. So basically, by destroying my things, he destroyed his life.

I work as a physical therapist and my boss was nice enough to give me a week off after it all went down. I was able to find a new place, although it’s a bit more expensive. When I went back to work, Steve was parked in the parking lot.

I got out my phone and started recording just in case. My lawyer said to document everything. I wanted to walk into my building where I knew there were a bunch of people, and he was farther away, so in my adrenaline I thought I could make it without him catching up. I was wrong and he grabbed my hand when I was about 5 feet from the door.

At first he was soft spoken, he said he wanted to apologize but I hadn’t been responding to his calls. I said we’re done and to leave me alone and tried to get my hand free. That pissed him off and he pulled me tighter and started yelling that I ruined his life and that I owed him.

One of my coworkers came out at the commotion. He’s a big guy and a lot taller than Steve, who immediately backed up. I told him to leave and not bother me again and he left.

The video of that incident plus the security cameras from the past several days of him waiting in the parking lot when he knows my shift starts was enough for my lawyer to get a restraining order. He’s left me alone since then, took a plea deal, and he doesn’t know where my new place is so I think I’m finally in the clear.

I didn’t want to post until all of it was settled. I’m doing better now. I’ve had multiple therapy sessions. Natalia have hung out 3 times, and the last time Steve didn’t even come up. My workplace has rallied behind me and now I get walked by my co worker from my car to the door. I am so grateful for the support system that has rallied behind me. I wouldn’t have gotten through this without it. That includes all of the advice and support I got here.

**Comments:**

**Commenter 1:** You did good, but please stay aware of your surroundings at all times, but especially at night. Your coworker won’t be close by when you go grocery shopping or to a mall.

You got Steve evicted. You pressed charges. People like Steve may do ok short term but the restraining order will expire in 90 days or so. People like Steve can be very patient.

If you aren’t inclined to go full martial arts, but please learn some basic self defense.

Stay safe.

#----NEW UPDATE----

[Final Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/s/SRDxeLowXn): **December 12, 2025 (nearly 15 months later)**

**UPDATE a year later: My (28f) boyfriend’s (30M) ex hid a note about his cleaning/dating habits right before they broke up that I just found. How do I talk to him about cleaning habits without him feeling like I'm using his ex's words against him?**

I doubt anyone still cares, but I remembered this account and wanted to give you all a final update. This whole situation changed my life, it was hard to go through but the advice I got helped me get safe and build what I have now. It gave me a newfound appreciation for community and a lowkey addiction to this podcast lol

After my ex confronted me in the parking lot of my work, I didn’t feel safe and wound up moving after getting a job in another state around a month later. Everyone who said the worst man predates your soulmate was right.

I moved a block from a library and the librarian wound up asking me out. I was nervous at first but he seemed so sweet so we met up in a public location. We’ve been together since and I didn’t know it could be like this. He does the dishes anytime he’s over. The other day, I noticed I was almost out of granola, I internally added it to my list, only to find a new bag the next day. He noticed and just bought it unprompted. He cooks for me and still does the dishes after. He’s raised my standards and still insists he’s doing the bare minimum.

Raspberry *(editor's note: OOP's pet snake)* is doing good. The move was stressful but she settled in and I got her an even bigger enclosure as a reward for surviving. My new man and her boop noses. I love it

Natalia and I will occasionally send TikTok’s to each other, that’s really the extent of it. I know a bunch of people wanted us to be besties (or even date lol) but unfortunately, we just remind each other of what we want to let go too much for that to happen 

As for Steve, besides the temporary restraining order, not much more with me happened. I did contact the police about the destruction of my stuff, but the interactions with them and potentially having to see him in court made me drop it. It was probably only 500 in damages as that didn’t feel worth my mental health. 

I did learn the landlord evicted him and was talking about suing for the property damage, as he had smashed some shelves and the sink (left his PC alone tho). He asked me for the pictures Natalia took directly after arriving and said he would try to use them. Last I heard, it was still ongoing. 

I hate to say it, but the cops probably care more about the male landlord and his property damage than me and my clothes, plates, and snake. I wish him luck and hope he holds Steve accountable. 

I have no idea if the notes are still there. I hope so, so that any future girlfriend finds them. Either way, I feel I did my part. Now it’s my time to heal and move on.

My last thing to say is that if anyone feels like their relationship is a slide, where you’re giving more than you get, slipping more and more into imbalance, talk about it. How they react will tell you everything.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Damn, u've been thru the ringer, huh? Glad to hear you're safe now, and livin' that library lover's dream, lol. You're hella right abt balancing in relationships. If it's all give and no take, it ain't worth it.

> **OOP:** I started reading romance books on his suggestion and he said anything I read that I like, tell him. Literally library lovers dream.

**Commenter 2:** Wait, if he's been evicted then it'll be some random person finding the notes right?

Unless you mean the one on the hoover?

> **OOP:** There is one taped to the bottom of his vacuum and one in the back of the cabinet of this big shelf he owns. He could have gotten rid of them when he was evicted, but I like to think they’re still there.

1. Get yourself in good shape if you can before the op - strength and cardio as this will accelerate your recovery and help you repair more quickly - especially if you follow a plan both before and post op. 

2. Mindset, positive attitude, a rehab plan help hugely 

3. Giving yourself time and space 

4.  Not rushing your recovery & being kind to yourself 

I cycled - indoor bike at 3.5 weeks post op - easy now resistance pedalling 5 mins and allowed to increase a min each time until I reached 20 & then no more until I reached 6 weeks - reach out for full plan I followed 

I cycled outdoors on road bike at 10 weeks

I went downhill skiing in alpine resort in France at 16 weeks (for 5 days of ski ing) 

I completed a tough 2 weeks of cycling in Mallorca at 20 weeks. 

I continued to get fitter and stronger and yesterday, following an integrated programme to strengthen everything, I completed my Level 1 ski instructor PSIC qualification as part of a 7 week ski improver instructor course I’m doing in Whistler. 

Small steps, milestones & diligence will get you where you want to be. 

Oh and im 55 (54 at time of op), had open surgery Vs keyhole incl endo excision, ovaries removed as well as fibroid uterus …it was the size of a 14-16 week pregnant woman…pre op I was suffering from terrible sciatic & back pain so the last few weeks pre op were tough in terms of making sure I stayed in peak fitness but the pain of pushing through was defo worth it for all that I’ve achieved post op.

1pqchjm,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1pqchjm/hard_problems_in_coffee_part_1_reproducibility/,Hard problems in coffee (part 1) - Reproducibility,"It's surprisingly difficult to get two identical batches of brewed coffee. Even when you control for water composition, water temperature, grind setting, brewing device,  filter type, and recipe, there's a high amount of variation from batch to batch. 

That absolutely perfect, blow-your-mind cup comes once, then you try to recreate it and get something that's a bit flatter, or a bit less balanced. 

Sidenote: This inconsistency creates what psychologists call a **variable reward schedule**. Our brains actually release more dopamine when a reward is unpredictable than when it is guaranteed. Because we never know if *this* morning's brew will be the one that blows our mind, we stay locked into the hobby, forever tweaking variables to chase that peak experience.

Some brewing devices have a lot more consistency. For example, drip assist brewers like the Gabi, or immersion brewers like the french press or Hario Switch. But consistency ≠ brilliance, and these consistent recipes don't often deliver ""peak"" cups.

Certain recipes can also lend consistency to otherwise inconsistent brewers. Lance Hedrick's [2-pour recipe ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LanceHedrick/comments/1hwabbz/ultimate_pourover_recipe/)is reliable, but (in my opinion) yields a somewhat boring result that lacks dynamic depth.

**My solution:** I find the Melodrip Colum brewer strikes a really nice balance. I find it's more consistent than conical brewers, and yields a more dynamic cup than most zero bypass brewers. I don't roll with the default recipe. I like using a more complex recipe that takes 4-6 minutes, but is consistent and very good with anywhere from 13-25 gram doses. 

**Recipe 1: The ""Slow & Steady"" (High Consistency)** *Ideal for 13-25g doses. Total time: 4-6 min.*

1. **0:00:** Pour 75g bloom. Rest until 1:00.
2. **1:00:** Pour up to 225g total. Wait until water is \~0.5 inche above the bed.
3. **Next:** Pour 65g (290g total) through the Melodrip. Wait until water is almost to the bed.
4. **Next:** Pour 75g (355g total).
5. **Final:** Pour to final ratio (usually 425g–435g).

The problem with this is that it takes kind of a while (4-6 min) and requires a lot of babysitting.

**Recipe 2: The ""Brian Quan Adaptation"" (Faster & Brighter)** Recently, I've been using an adaptation of a [Brian Quan recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpfFHv0KTrs). It's fun because it breaks a cardinal rule of pour-over (letting the water drain out of the coffee bed), but with the Melodrip you actually get away with it.

Example with a 25g dose and 1:16ish ratio

1. **Bloom:** Pour 75g. Agitate with a chopstick to break up clumps.
2. **@ 1:00:** Pour fast to 225g (kettle close to the bed).
3. **Drop:** Let the water level drop *below* the top of the coffee bed.
4. **Finish:** Pour fast to 425g *through* the Melodrip.

This gives a really nice dynamic cup with bright acidity and lots of sweetness. The body isn't quite as thick or juicy as the Melodrip recipe, but it also doesn't require 5+ minutes of my time.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **San Antonio Spurs vs. Atlanta Hawks: A Parlay Packed with Puns and Precision**

The San Antonio Spurs, fresh off a 119-94 drubbing of the Washington Wizards, are heading to Atlanta for a back-to-back clash with the 4-21 Atlanta Hawks. But here’s the twist: Spurs star Victor “Wemby” Wembanyama is being benched—yes, *benched*—as a precaution. Imagine a generational talent so valuable, he’s treated like a fragile heirloom vase in a game of dodgeball. The Spurs are prioritizing his long-term health over short-term glory, which is like saving the last slice of pizza for tomorrow instead of eating it now.

### Parsing the Odds: A Tale of Two Teams

Let’s crunch the numbers. The **Spurs are favored at -2.0 to -2.5 points**, with implied probabilities of **55-57%** to win outright. The **Hawks**, meanwhile, sit at +2.0 to +2.5 points, with a **32-35%** implied win chance. The total is locked at **240.5 to 242.5 points**, with even money on Over/Under.

Key stats to note:

* **Spurs’ Depth**: Despite resting Wemby, San Antonio’s bench includes a 4-game winning streak and a 11-14 record in their last 25 games. Dylan Harper (24 points vs. Wizards) and Devin Vassell (18 points) are proving they can carry the load.
* **Hawks’ Woes**: Atlanta’s 15-13 record is a mirage. Their latest loss to the Hornets saw Trae Young (8 points, 10 assists in 20 minutes) return from injury but underperform. The Hawks’ offense? A leaky faucet compared to the Spurs’ firehose.

### News Digest: Injuries, Comebacks, and Coffee Breaks

* **Wemby’s Absence**: The Spurs are playing it safe, limiting Wembanyama to 17 minutes in their last game. It’s like telling a superhero to take a coffee break—*literally*. Without him, the Spurs’ defense loses its “human eraser” (blocks = 99-game streak, anyone?), but their offense still has enough firepower to win ugly.
* **Hawks’ Hiccups**: Trae Young’s return is a silver lining, but 20 minutes of play is barely enough to w

So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

The focus of this post is a deep dive on some of Rachel Markle's shoes - specifically the shoes shared by Rachel Meghan Markle in June 2016. This was apparently shared to the media as part of the general smoke and mirrors about her (alleged) wealth as a cable actress in a supporting role with 2% screen time. Despite many minor, supporting actors in mid-range cable television series actually making much less than is popularly known, to the point that many quite well known TV stars have to work other jobs in order to support themselves. As part of introducing herself to the world, while dating Harold, Rachel used her 'shoe closet' to imply wealth. In this post we are going to do a deep dive into the origin of these shoes... so please, make a coffee, tea, or other beverage of your choosing and enjoy (it's quite a detailed post)...

[June 2016 - Rachel's 'Tig' post](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/lifestyle/article-5700865/Prince-Harrys-fianc-e-owns-20-000-sexy-shoe-collection-including-Dianas-nude-Choos.html) (later reported by a number of media outlets). D-lister Meghan Markle, delighted to be dating Harold, proudly shared her shoe closet in her blog... Interestingly, in an interview a lead Suits actress Sarah Rafferty remarked on how expensive the clothes that the stars were permitted to wear were, joking that their fictional boss must pay well, and implying that this was out of range for the actors themselves. Designers frequently lend clothes to costume departments as product placement, but these are expected to be returned...

Helpfully, the shoes on these shelves have been identified. I did a deep dive on these. Interestingly, many of these have been seen before, identical pairs seen on Reitman's and Suits, but also other smaller fashion shoots and small movies such as 'Remember me'...

If you’re tired of lumps and messy kitchen counters while making protein shakes, investing in a quality immersion blender can make a significant difference. Explore your options wisely, and you’ll soon be enjoying smooth, creamy shakes just the way you like them!

# Essential Features to Look for in an Immersion Blender

When selecting the perfect immersion blender, especially for creating smooth protein shakes, it’s important to understand the essential features that can greatly enhance your blending experience. In this guide, you’ll discover what to look for to ensure you choose the right tool for your kitchen.

# Power and Motor Speed

The power of an immersion blender is a vital feature to consider. A motor with at least 200 watts is ideal for making protein shakes. A more powerful motor can handle tougher ingredients like frozen fruits, vegetables, and ice, ensuring smooth and lump-free results. Look for models that offer variable speed settings, which allow you to adjust blending speed according to the consistency you desire.

# Blade Quality

The blades on an immersion blender significantly impact how well it performs. Stainless steel blades are the best choice as they are durable and resistant to rust. Additionally, some immersion blenders come with extra attachments or specialized blades designed for different tasks, such as chopping or frothing. A blending head with a bell-shaped design can help prevent splatter and ensure all ingredients are mixed evenly.

# Ease of Use

Comfort and convenience are key when using an immersion blender. Look for ergonomic designs that provide a comfortable grip, which will make the blending process easier, especially during prolonged use. An immersion blender with a simple one-button operation can make it easier to handle, letting you focus on mixing your protein shake rather than fiddling with buttons.

# Length of the Shaft

The length of the immersion blender shaft should match your needs. A longer shaft allows you to blend directly in tall containers or large pots without making a mess. Conversely, a shorter shaft may be more practical for quick tasks in smaller vessels. Consider your typical dishware when choosing the shaft length to ensure it fits comfortably.

# Attachments and Accessories

Some immersion blenders come with a variety of attachments that can enhance their functionality. Common accessories include:

* **Chopping bowl:** Ideal for preparing ingredients.
* **Whisk attachment:** Perfect for whipping cream or egg whites.
* **Beaker or measuring cup:** Useful for accurate blending.

These attachments can save time and make the device far more versatile, allowing you to perform multiple kitchen tasks with a single tool.

# Corded or Cordless

Choosing between corded and cordless immersion blenders can affect your blending experience. Corded models typically provide consistent power and unlimited blending time, making them great for larger tasks. On the other hand, cordless varieties offer flexibility and ease of movement, perfect for those who want to blend in various kitchen locations or avoid searching for an outlet.

# Cleaning and Maintenance

The ease of cleaning should not be overlooked. Many immersion blenders come with detachable blending shafts that can be easily washed by hand or are dishwasher safe. Look for models where the blending head can be detached quickly to simplify the cleaning process, ensuring that you can keep your device clean and hygienic without hassle.

# Noise Level

Noise level can be an important factor, especially in quiet kitchens. While most immersion blenders will generate some noise, some models operate more quietly than others. If you have kids or prefer a more serene environment while blending, opting for a quieter model can enhance your overall kitchen experience.

# Brand and Warranty

Brand reputation and warranty can provide additional peace of mind when making a purchase. Established brands often stand behind their products and offer good customer service. A warranty can protect your investment, particularly if you’re purchasing a higher-end model. Look for at least a one-year warranty to ensure that you’re covered against defects.

By focusing on these essential features, you can choose an immersion blender that not only fits your protein shake-making needs but also stands the test of time in your kitchen. A suitable model will provide you with delicious, smooth protein shakes without lumps or mess, enhancing both your cooking experience and meal enjoyment.

# Tips for Making Protein Shakes Without Lumps

Whether you enjoy protein shakes as a post-workout replenishment or a meal replacement, achieving a smooth and lump-free blend is crucial. Here are some pivotal tips to ensure your protein shakes are creamy and delightful without any unwanted lumps.

# Choose the Right Protein Powder

Not all protein powders are created equal. When selecting your protein powder, consider the following:

* **Quality:** Look for reputable brands that use high-quality ingredients. Organic or natural protein powders often blend smoother.
* **Base:** Consider the type of protein: whey, casein, plant-based, or blends. Whey protein typically mixes well, while some plant-based proteins may require more effort to achieve a smooth consistency.
* **Flavor and Additives:** Avoid powders with excessive flavorings or fillers, as these can affect the texture and mixing.

# Use the Right Equipment

Your choice of blender can drastically affect the outcome of your protein shake. Here are a few options:

* **Immersion Blender:** This is a great choice for single servings. It's easy to use and clean, ensuring less mess.
* **High-Speed Blender:** These blenders offer powerful blades that break down the ingredients more efficiently, yielding a smoother shake.
* **Shaker Bottle:** If you’re on-the-go, a shaker bottle with a built-in whisk ball can help mix the powder with liquid thoroughly.

# Follow the Right Mixing Technique

Using the correct technique can make a world of difference in the smoothness of your shake:

1. **Add Liquids First:** Always pour your liquid (water, milk, or a milk alternative) into the blender before adding the protein powder. This helps the powder dissolve quicker.
2. **Gradually Introduce Ingredients:** If you’re adding fruits, vegetables, or nut butters, put them in after the liquids and powder. This allows for better blending.
3. **Blend in Stages:** Start your blender on a low setting to mix the ingredients, then gradually increase the speed to fully blend without lumps.

# Experiment with Techniques to Dissolve the Powder

If your protein powder tends to clump, try some of these additional techniques:

* **Sift the Powder:** Before adding it to your shake, sift the protein powder to break up any clumps.
* **Use Warm Liquids:** Mixing protein powder with slightly warm liquids can help it dissolve well. Just ensure your shake isn’t too hot.
* **Let It Sit:** After blending, let the shake sit for a minute. If you notice lumps, give it another quick blend or stir.

# Pick the Right Liquid

The liquid you choose can impact the blend quality of your protein shake. Here are some suggestions:

* **Milk or Milk Alternatives:** These tend to yield creamier shakes than water, improving texture dramatically.
* **Cold Ingredients:** Using cold liquids can keep the shake refreshing and prevent clumping.
* **Fruit Juices:** If you're adding fruit, blending with juice instead of water can enhance flavor and aid in mixing.

# Consider Adding Emulsifiers

Emulsifiers can be a game changer when it comes to protein shakes. Here are a few options:

* **Nut Butters:** These not only add flavor but help prevent lumps and improve creaminess.
* **Greek Yogurt:** This can thicken your shake while also providing protein, creating a velvety texture.
* **Smoothies:** Rather than a protein shake, consider making a smoothie with fruits and leafy greens for a more even blend.

Remember, finding the right combination that suits your taste preference can take a bit of experimentation. With these tips, you'll be well on your way to enjoying delicious, lump-free protein shakes every time. Enjoy the blend, savor the flavor, and just drink it down with joy!

# Cleaning and Maintenance for Your Immersion Blender

Cleaning and maintaining your immersion blender is essential for its longevity and ensuring that it continues to deliver smooth, lump-free results. With regular use, your blender will accumulate food particles, grease, and residue. If you want to keep it in peak condition, there are straightforward steps you can follow.

# Immediate After-Use Cleaning

One of the best practices is to clean your immersion blender right after you use it. This prevents any dried-on food particles and grease from becoming harder to remove later. Here’s a simple cleaning method:

* **Turn Off and Unplug:** Always make sure to turn off and unplug your immersion blender before cleaning it.
* **Rinse Immediately:** Rinse the blending shaft under warm water to remove any leftover food particles.
* **Use Soap:** Fill a tall container or a bowl with warm soapy water. Dip the blending shaft into the soapy water and run the motor for a few seconds to clean it effectively.
* **Rinse Again:** Rinse the blending shaft under running water to remove excess soap.

# Deep Cleaning for Stubborn Residues

Sometimes, especially when thicker mixtures like protein shakes or soups are blended, you might find residues stuck to the blades or the shaft. For those instances, deep cleaning is necessary:

* **Soaking:** If food particles are stuck, soak the blending shaft in warm soapy water for about 10-15 minutes.
* **Use a Brush:** Use a soft-bristled brush (like a toothbrush) to gently scrub the blades. Be careful not to damage the blades, as they are often sharp.
* **Wipe Down:** Use a damp cloth to wipe down the motor unit; avoid getting any water into the electrical parts.

# Cleaning the Motor Unit

Cleaning the motor section of your immersion blender requires extra caution. Here’s how to do this safely:

* **Use a Dry Cloth:** Wipe the entire motor unit with a damp cloth, making sure to avoid any water from entering it.
* **Check for Debris:** Look for any food debris around the buttons or base where they can accumulate. Gently clean this area with a dry cloth or a soft brush.

# Maintenance Tips

To keep your immersion blender in optimal condition, it’s important to carry out regular maintenance. Here are some helpful tips:

* **Inspect the Blades:** Regularly check the blades for any signs of dullness or damage. If they become damaged, you may need to consider replacement or repair.
* **Avoid Overheating:** Don’t run the blender for too long without breaks, especially while making thicker mixtures, as it can overheat.
* **Store Properly:** When not in use, store the immersion blender in a dry place and avoid letting it come into contact with other utensils or hard surfaces that may damage it.

# Package and Parts Cleaning

Along with cleaning the main components, pay attention to any attachments that come with your immersion blender:

* **Attachable Blades and Containers:** Wash any attachable blades or containers by hand or according to the manufacturer's instructions. Most of these are safe to clean in a dishwasher, but check the guidelines first.
* **Seals and Gaskets:** Look for any seals or gaskets that may require regular inspection for wear and tear. Replace any that show signs of damage.

Keeping your immersion blender clean and well-maintained not only improves performance but also extends its lifespan. With these cleaning and maintenance tips, you can ensure your device stays in great shape, allowing you to enjoy perfectly blended protein shakes and other culinary delights for years to come.

I keep having the bitter aftertaste in my cups. I dont' mind the astringent/dryness but my cups don't have that kind of dryness either - only bitterness that lingers. 

Water temp. 93 C, filtered tap water. 1:17 ratio. V60; I’m Kingrinder K6, has been trying to  grind from 100 clicks to 70 clicks, the coarser one (100) have less bitterness but not much of acidity.


Is this a case of uneven extraction - technique issue? Should I lower the ratio? I’m tempted to taste the coffee at different timing to know which steps are causing that bitterness

I’m relatively new to Mumbai and haven’t really explored the dating or social scene here, especially when it comes to mature women, so I thought I’d put this out honestly.

In Pune, I had a thing with a couple of women in their early to mid 40s and damn, that energy stays with you. Not just dates, but real chemistry. Coffee that turned into long conversations, slow burns, heavy eye contact & then intense, confident sex with zero awkwardness. They knew their bodies, knew what they wanted, and weren’t shy about taking control or letting go.

Personal opinion: sex with a mature woman is different. Slower, deeper, hotter. Long make out sessions, teasing that drives you crazy, and a pleasure-first mindset that younger scenes just don’t hit the same way. Once you’ve experienced that, it’s hard to unfeel it.

Not assuming anything or being disrespectful just curious and trying to understand the ground reality before I explore further.

Would appreciate honest inputs or experiences from people familiar with the scene..",1,1766119306.0,Mumbai_Relationships,1,0.67,False

I write exclusively in 3rd person, and I tend to write A LOT haha. I also  can reply several times a week. I also enjoy a decent amount of OOC chat and bonding with my writing partner.

Onto my idea! The other day I was at a 7Brew coffee (one of the drive up coffee places), and they always have a chatty college aged gal there that talks with you for a few minutes as they make your coffee. I’m a sucker for roleplay where strangers fall for each other so I wanted to combine these two ideas. Maybe it just so happens that I come the days that you work and we really start to hit it off. We can throw in days where we don’t match up too (I don’t get coffee or you arnt working). Maybe it progresses to getting your number. I just like the idea that the connection forms over a series of these smaller interactions. Maybe the conversations get more personal despite other coworkers and patrons in their car being around. Maybe there’s drama in one of our lives. There are a lot of ways we could play this out but the main elements are strangers to lovers and also focusing on building that connection in those short bursts rather than hours longs talks or dates.

Trying to forget who I am, again, returning to putting nature to the test I guess. Rolling down the hill, pretend, pebbles and branches falling in tow. One's self and their situational selves, one here and there lost in some kind of routine, I guess. Failure to proceed, what was the test?

Living life in mediocrity, a kind of slow-mo quick screen, shopsnots and snap shots of places I would like to be, fleeting pictures of piss-smelling streets, littered with dirty needles and beautiful graffiti -  

that's where I want to be, 

away from these walls and screens, in a room full of junk from hobbies I tried and forgot about. The grass is greener wherever I am not. Fear turns to longing at times, and that's almost a welcome compromise - I think about the past, and I hear wails and screams. Someone's always yelling about something. Truth is, it was all of our faults.

Moving onwards, Burts bees and Pokémon cards - Old spice and a massager. I had to buy some present for Christmas, can't really live with myself to not participate. I wish I could have made, or given, some art instead, but I'm a weirdoooo, and nothing about what I make seems easy to share with everyone all at once, where I don't have an easy way out.  
  
Truth, life is weird. Reality is neurosis and avoidance, I paint with Bob Ross's art advice in my mind and still end up vomiting up the early chaos of my life onto the canvas. I've really overanalyzed that, aspired to become a psychologist just having had to deal with the irrationality of things around me, I had to figure out if I was crazy or if the world was. I dropped out, either way, but found out in the end. World's crazy, basically - and I'm not exempt from that.  

Doesn't matter. These never have an end, just a beginning - this kind of hungry sensation. I have an urge to, vomit forth, a great descriptor of the process I've indulged. Get it out, this clawing sensation threatens, gotta let it out. Write the horror of existence, release some of the pressure of knowing and knowing no one else knows. Learn you are not special, get over it, repeat. 

Process, watson. It's all cycles, maaan... is your process viable? 

  
Doesn't matter. I'm not even resentful, kind of annoyed though, I spent my money on art prints that I can't find it in myself to give as presents, and got some stuff from Walmart instead. What gives? 

Life. I've kind of accepted my taste in, things in general, differ from my family - I feel for the most part, it'd be resented in some way. Walmart is cleaner, more focused, more immediately useful. It's more normal, I guess, too. I am certainly not, exactly myself, around them. But I'm not exactly around anyone else. I'm not exactly myself here, either, I guess. I'm more myself here than anywhere else, though, I think. 

Just a little more thoughtful, if anything. I'm more honest here, than anywhere else, certainly. 

I feel off, honestly. I'm stocked up enough not to worry, but need to go 12 days without anymore money. I'm quitting weed, again, I guess, here - it's easier than it seems. I just have to deal with the boredom, which might be why I'm here now - feeling a little more eager to let loose some complicated kinds of tension, that games, videos, and whatever else can't. 

The worst of the feeling is probably a lack of caffeine - energy drinks are expensive, but I love getting them when I can. Instant coffee and tea are easy to stock up on, at least, it's just all the good stuff goes first.

I feel like a man drowning in an inch of water, that kind of thing. 

this is nothing other than me letting out some steam, i think, I guess?

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

1pqc4nx,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Ronin_Kumori/comments/1pqc4nx/the_nicest_man_on_holly_street/,The Nicest Man on Holly Street,"Christmas in the city looks better from a distance.

If you’re high enough up, staring out of an office window, it’s simple: soft orange streetlights, blinking colored bulbs in apartment windows, a thin sheet of snow covering the trash on the sidewalks. The sounds blur together into something that almost feels peaceful—carols from a radio, a bus sighing to a stop, laughter from a bar where people are pretending they still like each other.

But the closer you get to the ground, the more that magic frays.

You start to notice the arguments echoing through thin walls. The way the snow turns gray around the edges, chewing up footprints and tire tracks. The smell of old beer and exhaust and desperation.

And, if you walk far enough past the nice neighborhoods and the tasteful wreaths and the little plastic reindeer on lawns, you hit the streets where the lights don’t quite reach. Where the decorations are whatever people could scavenge or steal. Where the cold doesn’t mean “cozy night in,” it just means your fingers hurt more while you’re trying to make rent.

Victor Callahan saw all of it. He just chose which parts counted.

By day he was exactly what people said he was: the nicest man on Holly Street. He’d earned that title. Held doors. Carried groceries. Cleared the snow from the sidewalk in front of the old woman’s duplex before she even woke up to see it. Wore good suits that made people assume “professional” instead of “dangerous.” Smiled with just the right amount of teeth.

He had a firm handshake, remembered names, and sent out Christmas cards with neat handwriting and generic well-wishes. The kind of man you asked for directions. The kind of man who’d walk behind you at night and you’d feel relieved instead of tense.

The mask worked because he wore it all the time, even when he was alone. That’s the part people don’t get. If you lie about who you are long enough, eventually the lie sits down right next to you on the couch and starts helping you pick out your tie.

December was his favorite month. The city did half his work for him. Snow covered evidence. Storms kept decent people inside. Everyone who was out that late in that cold had a reason, and usually it wasn’t a good one.

He also liked the way Christmas made people generous with their trust. They were so eager to believe in “kind strangers” and “holiday miracles” that they never stopped to ask why the nice man in the perfect coat was out here with them, in the dark, instead of safely tucked away somewhere warm.

On paper, Victor’s life looked clean. Respectable job. Upper middle-class address. A track record of showing up on time and never causing trouble. He took polite women on polite dates to nice restaurants—teachers, office assistants, aspiring nurses. Women with futures. Women who posted their dinners on social media and called their mothers on Sundays.

He treated them well. Didn’t even have to fake it. Paid the bill, walked them to cabs, let them think he was simply “busy” when he didn’t call back. Those women weren’t for him. Not the real him. They were props on a stage he’d built, proof for the world that he was exactly what he seemed.

The other side of his life lived under flickering streetlights and neon signs that buzzed louder than they shone.

He found the girl with the green coat on a Wednesday.

It wasn’t much of a coat. The kind of wool that pills up after one winter and never quite keeps the wind out. The hem was starting to fray, and the sleeves were coming loose at the lining. She kept tugging them back into place like they’d magically fix themselves if she did it enough times.

She stood near the mouth of an alley, hands jammed into her pockets, shifting from one foot to the other to keep the blood moving. Too new to the life to pretend she wasn’t freezing. Too proud to admit the cold was winning.

He watched her from across the street first. People like him could stand anywhere and not be questioned. A man in a good coat, holding a to-go cup, glancing at his watch—no one wondered why he was there. They just moved around him.

Someone called her name once. “Lena! Your coat’s falling apart again!” A rough voice, another woman a little older, a little more worn down, with makeup fighting a losing battle against the snow.

Lena laughed it off. That sound carried across the street to where Victor stood. A sound that didn’t belong on that corner, at that hour.

That was how he chose her. Not the coat. Not the face. The laugh. The stubborn, stupid little piece of hope still clinging to her like the snow on her hair.

He took three nights to be sure.

He never rushed the selection. He watched her pattern. Learned which corner she drifted to when the traffic slowed. Noted who she talked to, who she avoided, whether anyone seemed protective of her. Watched the way she held herself when cops drove by, when cars slowed down, when doors opened and shut.

She was cautious, but not careful enough. Still believed that danger looked like a guy with wild eyes and dirty clothes, not someone like him. That was another thing he relied on: people think monsters crawl out of shadows. They never consider that some of them are perfectly comfortable under bright lights.

On the fourth night he brought the Cadillac.

It wasn’t the car he drove to work. That one was more sensible, boring on purpose. The Cadillac was for nights like this: long body, smooth engine, leather seats that still held the faint smell of someone else’s cigarettes from long ago. Old enough not to stand out in a bad neighborhood. Nice enough to feel like a small upgrade to anyone who climbed in.

The snow had started again, the sky thick with it. Holiday lights blinked on a building across the way, making the falling flakes flash red, green, red, green. The air tasted like exhaust and cold metal.

He pulled up to the curb and waited. Engine idling. Heat on low. Radio turned down to a soft murmur—some crooner singing about chestnuts and open fires for people who could afford both.

Lena saw the car. She pretended she hadn’t. She let it sit there for a full minute while she finished her cigarette, stubbed it out with a boot that had lost its shine, and glanced up and down the street.

Then she approached the window.

There wasn’t much to the conversation. There didn’t need to be. Her voice up close was sanded down by exhaustion, but that laugh still lived under the words. A little nervous, a little hopeful. He gave her the usual lines, the ones that said “I respect you” without actually meaning anything. He kept his tone warm, his eyes steady, his hands visible on the steering wheel.

She got in the car.

If she hesitated, it was only for half a heartbeat. Her body made the decision faster than her brain did. Warm car, clean man, decent coat, kind eyes. Everything inside her that still wanted to believe in, “Maybe this won’t be terrible,” won.

Once the door shut, the city felt farther away. Just the sound of the heater, the faint hum of the tires, the occasional hiss of slush under the wheels as he pulled away from the curb.

They drove.

Conversation skimmed the surface. Names that may or may not have been real. Lies so practiced they sounded like truth even to the person telling them. She asked what he did, he gave the job title he always used. Respectable. Vague. Impossible to disprove without a full background check no one would ever run.

The important part wasn’t what they said. It was what she didn’t notice: the direction.

Every turn he took peeled away another layer of safety. Farther from the main road. Farther from late-night diners and all-night gas stations. Past the point where any reasonable person would say, “This is too far.”

Reasonable people weren’t usually in her position.

Out the window, the world grew emptier. Fewer lights. More boarded-up windows. A lot of “For Lease” signs nobody was ever going to call. The Christmas spirit got thin out here. Decorations hung crooked or not at all. A single sad string of bulbs draped over a chain-link fence, blinking like a dying heartbeat.

Eventually, even that fell away.

He turned down a side street the plows hadn’t bothered with yet. Snow lay in thick, untouched sheets. The car’s headlights carved tunnels through the falling white, the beams catching individual flakes for a second before they vanished against the windshield.

He eased the car to a stop near the edge of a lot that used to be something—a warehouse, maybe, or a small factory—before the city forgot about it.

The engine went quiet.

Silence in winter hits different. There’s a weight to it. The kind of stillness that makes a person feel suddenly, painfully aware of their own breathing.

In that quiet, realization finally caught up with her.

Everyone gets a moment. That split second where their body understands something their mind doesn’t want to accept. Some feel it when a hand goes where it shouldn’t. Some feel it when they notice a locked door, a blocked exit, a road they don’t recognize.

Lena’s moment was here, with the engine ticking as it cooled, snow patting softly against the roof, and the ugly truth rising in the back of her throat.

She reached for the door handle.

He watched without moving. Every part of him was calm. Heart rate steady. Hands relaxed. He’d done this before. Fear was familiar to him, just never his own.

The handle didn’t save her. The snow outside was deep and unforgiving, the night wide and empty, the nearest help a long, cold run away. But reaching for it was still human. Maybe the most human thing she did in her last hour.

The city moved on.

Storms came through. Another layer of snow fell, then another. Plows carved lines through the main streets, piling gray slush into walls at the corners. People cursed the ice, complained about the cold, kept living their lives.

It was two days before anyone found the impression in the snow at the edge of that forgotten lot.

A group of kids had dragged sleds farther than they were supposed to. They always do. One of them spotted it first—a shape half-covered, like someone had made a snow angel and left before finishing. Arms out. Legs together. Not exactly right, but close enough to look like play at a distance.

Up close, it didn’t look like play.

The stain in the middle was faint but wrong, seeping up through the thin, wind-scraped layer of white.

The screaming brought the adults. The adults brought the police. The police brought tape and cameras and standard-issue language about “a tragic incident under investigation.”

The news covered it for a day. A young woman. No ID on her. Possibly a sex worker. Probably. The word slid into the reports like a shrug. People clucked their tongues and shook their heads and changed the channel back to Christmas specials and cooking shows.

Holly Street talked about it, too. Briefly. The widow at the end of the block mentioned how terrible it all was while accepting a bag of groceries from Victor Callahan. The parents across the street told their kids to stay where they could see them. Lights still went up. Trees still got decorated. Life, for everyone who wasn’t Lena, went on.

When the detectives knocked on Victor’s door, he was ready.

Of course he’d heard the news. Awful thing, really. He invited them in out of the cold. Offered coffee. Apologized that he only had the cheap stuff; he really should’ve picked up something nicer for guests.

They asked where he’d been that night. He had an answer. He always did. A receipt. A neighbor who’d seen him. A detail about the storm that made him sound attentive and responsible.

He made eye contact. Not too much, not too little. Let concern show on his face. Let it crack once, just a little, as if the thought of such cruelty hurt him personally.

By the time they left, they were thanking him for his time. One even apologized for bothering him so close to the holidays.

He watched them go, then quietly closed the door.

The house was warm. The tree in the corner glowed with white lights he’d wrapped just so, no gaps, no overlaps. Ornaments hung evenly spaced. Nothing sentimental, nothing homemade. All curated. All controlled.

He walked over to the tree and bent down to place another present beneath it. Small box. Neat wrapping. Green ribbon.

He straightened, looked at the tree for a long moment, and smiled to himself. Not the big neighborly one. The smaller one. The honest one nobody ever saw.

Outside, someone’s radio played carols loud enough to carry down the street. Kids’ laughter bounced off the snow. Somewhere, a dog barked at nothing and was told to hush.

On Holly Street, people slept soundly, comforted by the idea that bad things happened somewhere else, to other people, for reasons they’d never have to understand.

And in the nicest house on the block, the nicest man they knew leaned back in his chair, closed his eyes, and rested.

Men like Victor didn’t need miracles to keep them safe. They just needed everyone to believe that monsters didn’t wear good suits and shovel their neighbor’s sidewalk.

The snow would fall again. The streets would clear. The city would forget.

He wouldn’t.

I'm using an Encore ESP as a grinder and have practiced with various beans from some local shops: Stumptown, Devocion and most recently Equator coffee.

I've ground to the point where it's too fine -- working my way courser until I hit the acceptable time range for a double and they all taste terrible. After grinding, I hit the puck with WDT, then tamp with a tamper that has an auto-leveler. I even started to play around with manual pre-infusion which seemed to make it taste a tad better.

Cover art by: u/Acrobatic_Age_4478 (reddit) u/Ktardmf (instagram)

Light swells, colours shift endlessly. Towering cancerous growths appear and stretch way beyond the coils of sight. Distant black stars blink without reason in the maddening white sky. Shapes without forms or meaning rise and fall all at once, dotting the landscape with ribs and maws.



Truly, life is booming inside the petri dish. It’s a simple one, a McConkey culture with some *Streptococcus pneumoniae* growing, and different growth altering chemicals added to test the new batch. I’ve never been much of a fan of the boring repeating concept of inoculating cultures, but it gets the job done and being able to marvel at the colonies of microorganisms is something I’ll never tire of.



Life outside the lab is empty as always. Put my keycard back inside my empty locker. Walk out to an empty parking lot save for my own car. Drive empty highways back. To my empty home. It wasn’t always this way, but going back is always harder than going forwards.

Setting my keys down in the little vestibule of my apartment, I barely take notice of the state of the place.



Dust covers everything that’s not strictly necessary to my survival. Counters and picture frames are so dirty they’re almost covered in grime. The low light and rancid air of my abode have given chance to mold to form around various holes in the drywall. As a biologist this doesn’t shock me, and I’m far too apathetic to do anything about it.



The only thing that seems to be in mint condition is the singular heavyset oak desk, sitting almost religiously at the back of the living room. Sat upon it are dozens upon dozens of research papers. They all look as though they’ve been leafed through so many times their edges have started crinkling. If an onlooker, not that any would pass here, were to look closely, they would discover these papers seem to be all from different universities, different researchers, different eras. No pattern to it, at least not to the naked eye of the beholden.



In a less pristine kept part of the desk, slightly dusty, is relics of an old self. Books on druidism and hexes, research on ancient Beasts and monsters. And a paper full of circles and iconograms, with one name, Gevaudan. This is a part of myself, of a young man full of hopes and dreams of a magic that had long left our world, that I try to forget, lest I let despair overtake me.



I sigh heavily, perhaps even dramatically, as I throw myself on the couch. Thoughts swirl through my head like a cup of tea gone wrong, like a malevolent storm of unknowable realities. Keys, keys, keys. Always and forever. These thoughts unnerve me. I turn on the TV, maybe some static will tune out the hum of my own mind.



I jolt awake in dim darkness, only the greenish hue of the TV, now showing some sort of late night discount promotion show, providing any light around me. How long have I slept ? Did I eat when I got home ? I frown. I can’t let my own wallow in misery affect my work.



The hum of the microwave provides a comforting warmth to my soul, helped by the cozy orange glow of the machine’s inner lightbulb. After a short while and an electronic “beep!”, I find myself with a couple hot pockets ready to be eaten, though for now quite too hot to be so.



As I get ready to take my first bite, something sharp and unexpected happens. I feel a throbbing sensation somewhere. It takes me a moment to adjust to it and understand. It’s vibrating, in my leg, in my pocket. I hastily take out my phone.



Flipping the cranky old hinge of my analog device, a name appears. The small, smudged over, black pixels read “Dr. Montauk, PHD”. I freeze. That is a name I recognize but do not know. 



I am stood there for a while, the monotone strident ringtone rhythmically matching the thrumming of my own stress. How to interact with new people? How to not sound insane ?

In my stupor I decide to press “answer” and let fate do the talking.  
  


“Dr. Montauk of the Northwest Institute of Sciences, am I talking with ████ █████ ?”



Hearing my name puts me in ever more of a panic, but I try to steel myself.



“I…um. Yes, yes that’s me…Can I ask what this is about ?”



“You will be debriefed later, researcher. Please head to your working facility at 5:33 AM sharp, don’t be late” Her tone is stern and almost motherly.



With that, a deafening beep roars, ending the connection.



The rest of my night is spent in a blur. Making coffee here, putting on socks the wrong way there. I end up ready to leave two hours earlier than I should. 

So I spend my time sitting in my living room, in the dark. Wearing my best suit, crumpled and dirty. My only company the red light of the television’s power button, and the soothing glow of the moon from the bay window.



Before leaving, I make a good decision. A decidedly rare occurrence in my life. I spend a bit reviewing my own papers and research. I may have no idea why a big name from the fucking NWIS wants to see me, but if it has anything to do with my ideas, I’ll at least try not to ridicule myself to the community any further.



My finger traces the edge of a sketch. A forgotten scheme of a bacteria, one I’ve not looked at in so long I forgot even its name. My broken, not cut in too long nail feels rough on the smooth, silky nature of the paper. Once more I feel rotten, diseased, unworthy. 



The lines which I’ve written and read and rewritten countless times have started to feel like an alien language. “...and through this process we can surmise that a significant impact on evolution has…”. I doubt myself ever more. Why does anyone care what I think. Why do I care. Nothing I make ever has value, life has proven that much. 



I take one last look at my collection of petri dishes, sitting next to my unholy mountain of papers. They look as they always do, beautiful colours of life mixing in, a promise of a dream never to be achieved. They glisten as I close my front door. Almost blinking at me. As I get into my car and put the keys in, I can only think of how despicable today is going to be.

I drive. I keep my dome light turned on despite it not being quite necessary, it just makes me feel more at home. The radio hums a breathy tune sung by a female chord. The words don’t quite register in my unfocused mind, but their presence help soothe me.



My car possesses many quirks, somethings from age, others not quite as easily explained. When I honk the horn, the hood opens for exemple. Or when I accelerate, the radio gets louder. It’s the kind of things that, when you explain to a stranger they’ll look in disbelief, but building up a routine is what keeps us sane after all.



That is to say, when my wipers suddenly start to frantically wave over the windshield, I know to simply turn on the left blinkers to get them to settle down. I do this without even thinking about it, my thoughts focused in a singularity of dread and wonder.



Change. Change is good. But change can also be bad. Why does it matter? It’s not like my life has been “good” so far anyways. The faded teal of my rust wagon’s paint glistens in the faint morning light, reminding me that there may still be good things to happen to me after all.



As I pull up the driveway of the facility, I have steeled myself. I will face whatever comes, probably very ungracefully, but face it nonetheless.



I adjust my badge, trying to seem as professional as possible, as I exit my car. I take a small note of the two huge black SUVs that are also in the parking lot, seemingly Dr Montauk came with friends.



The old, dusty halls greet me with just as much stillness as usual, but not silence today. In the distance, small bits of chatter and bickering can be heard. Just my luck, it sounds like arguing over goddamn legislation.



“Look who finally showed up!” A tall, burly man in a neat black suit exclaims.



“Ah, Professor █████ !We were expecting you.” The neatly dressed, silver haired woman who I can only assume is Dr Montauk greets me.



“I,.. uhm,...are you guys here for the performance of the site..? If that’s the case I can get the.. uh.. reports?”



I twitch, the unpleasant surprise of the amount of people like needles under my skin, there’s at least ten at the present.



“Let’s cut to the chase” she interrupts “you wrote the thesis on how through lateral translation viruses could have drastically affected evolution over history, and that a possible ‘genesis virus’ could be at the root of this phenomenon, correct ?”



“Well,...” I begin, unsure of how to react to the sudden bluntness “that is a grossly summarized version of it, but I suppose that is correct, doctor”

  


“Semantics, researcher” she cuts me “follow us, I believe we’ve made a discovery you can help us unravel.”



I follow the macabre retinue, draped in the funeral shade of somber processions. These corridors, rocking in the gentle wind of the air regulators, mandatory for this level of experiments. They, who once were so familiar, so comforting to me, now feel alien, with the presence of these strangers. The sound of footsteps echoes far and wide in the sterile silence of the white floorings.

  


We reach a door, a frame often seen but rarely looked at. A room that was used, once, long ago, but not anymore. Not for a long time. The paint on it is crusted and has started to flake off in large, uneven scales. With little effort, the head of our procession pushes it open, twisting the shiny metal knob. 



The inside reveals something I’d only ever seen in movies before. As each of us step in, an almost religious sort of silence settles between us. There were hushed whispers and half looks before, now we all stand in utter admiration of the sight before us. Though whether it is of awe or horror, I could not tell.



Large monitors flood the place with the muted light of basements who have not seen sunlight in long. Long strings of text, numbers and symbols cover each one. They scroll from one screen to the next in a slow staccato rhythm. 



Copper wires connect the whole place, from floor to ceiling. Like a steampunk spider’s web, they reflect the sickly light of the screens, and the hopeful glow of the hallway flooding in from the door behind us, quickly fading as Dr Montauk, the last to come in, closes the door behind her.



I wordlessly approach the one object I recognize, the one thing that is routine, the one point I have to anchor myself to my reality to try to forget this unnamed madness. 



The microscope looks almost inviting, its lens a black star in the blinding white of the space around us, blinking at me with the knowledge of ancient realms, of the nature of life itself. The debate of whether viruses are living or not has long fascinated me. The deniers claim it doesn’t follow any natural laws of life. It doesn’t feed, doesn’t sustain itself. It doesn’t reproduce, the process of duplication it has seeming more mechanical than biological.



And yet, these very laws are simply preconceived notions we humans have made. How many times have those very same manmade laws been challenged and eventually revoked. The Earth being round, the Sun being at the center of our system, goddamn even quantum physics. 



All of those are things that, if told to someone before proof was brought, would be laughed at, ridiculed, brought down. It’s for that reason and my personal convictions that despite it all, despite the debate, I was certain that viruses were in fact living. And more than that, they were not just surviving, they are living, and have an endgoal.



And so, as I press my eye on the microscope’s own, sight and insight kissing passionately in a loving union of knowledge, I take the first step in a leap that I would come to forever be thankful of.



It takes but a moment for my eyes to adjust to the lens’ flare of light pooling in front of me. The focus point appears to be a colony of bacteria, numbering in the hundreds in the observable field of view.



They float gently along the soft secretion of the feeding fluid, look almost as a herd of sheep slowly grazing on an emerald green hill. Judging from their shape, almost star like, I hazard the guess that these must be some kind of common Amoeba, probably *Amoeba proteus*.



There is, however, an outlier. The eyepiece pointer is pointing to a small shape, about a thousand times smaller than the nearby bacteria. I change the lens to make it more visible, lo and behold, it is a virus, and a decidedly huge one at that.



Estimating from the current lens type, and field of view, that thing must be at least six hundred nanometers wide. That’s gotta be the largest megavirus I’ve ever seen, sitting at around 200 times bigger than the polio virus. Now, I’m no stranger to giant viruses, girus for short.



These were discovered at the beginning of the 21st century. They caused quite the uproar in the community. For decades scientists over the globe had them right under their nose, but these titans were so huge compared to their smaller cousins that they were simply believed to be bacteria. It wasn’t until the advancement in microscopic technology that the sneaky buggers were revealed for what they truly were.



And what a discovery indeed. Not only are they larger than the average virus we’ve come to know and love or hate, and we’re speaking magnitudes of hundreds of times bigger, they are also much more complex. Their DNA material contains genes from hundreds of different species of eukaryotes and prokaryotes.



This led the already hotly debated topic of viruses being alive or not to become ever more of an inferno, and was the origin of my theory of their consequence on long term evolution, and the subsequent concept of “genesis virus”. A concept Dr Montauk severely butchered earlier, but I can probably find it in my heart to forgive her.



All of this to say, the sample my gaze was currently set upon was anormal, even for someone like me who’s seen a lot of record breaking stuff in the field. Its capsid was polyhedral shaped, much like the beloved Medusavirus, capsomeres were tangled in an almost thrumming notion, so much so I thought it to be a trick of the light at first.



I stand back up, briefly stunned by the shifting of worlds. From the small world of hidden truths to the muddy world of human lies. As I blink and rub my eyes absently, Dr Montauk motions to me.



“So,” she begins, seeming unsure of herself for the first time, “I gather you can see this is no run of the day virus we got here, researcher?”



“I,.. yeah. What am I looking at, doctor?” My mind is still foggy, the utter madness this whole day has been clinging like gum under my show.



“We.. don’t know for sure, as I’m sure you saw it presents several unique characteristics we haven’t seen before. That by itself would make for an interesting discovery and a fun article”



“There’s a ‘but’ I’m guessing”



“This thing, with its anatomy we still fail to understand, seems to be able to infect any species at random.”



I stare blankly for a moment, the words spoken not quite registering. 



“So, what, you haven’t figured out the range of species affected by this yet?” I say, trying to clarify.



“No, I mean this thing has simultaneously affected over a hundred species overnight across the entire globe, with no vector found.”



This doesn’t make sense.



“That can’t be right. Have we checked for carrier bird species? Tainted waters? Maybe something in the Arctic got heated up and spread through the air?”



“We have, and so far none of these have come with significant results.”



She pauses, ever so briefly. She turns around and eyes her followers, who were looking around with the glazed over eyes of teenagers not understanding a class in physics. One of them gives her a curt nod, she turns back around to face me.



“You don’t understand the scale of this. Infected have been found out to be the sole carrier in areas multiple miles wide, even for their whole species. This thing doesn’t make a shred of sense and we’re losing our minds up there trying to figure it out.”



“So you came to ask the guy who’s already lost his mind theorizing about it then, right ?”



Looks like I struck true. I may never have met the elderly Doctor, a titan in the field after all, but I definitely remember seeing her name in the list of names who rejected my thesis concept. She looks pained for a moment, then continues.



“People can be wrong. What matters is we think your research might help us understand this thing, and put a lid on it before things get any more out of control.”



“Out of control how exactly ?” I asked, puzzled.



“Look for yourself.”



Her time worn finger points to a spot behind me. At first I thought she meant to peer into the lidless eye of the microscope again, how wrong I was.



A closer inspection reveals a truth my inner mind had chosen to make me ignore up till now, a gross lie to protect my sanity. The large glass panes, sitting just out of reach behind the desks with which the microscope was sat upon, were in fact the faces of obscene cages, theatres of madness.



I cannot comprehend the utter villany, the sheer indescribable nature of what I am seeing. This is a vile mockery of life, a curious thing that must never exist outside the mind of a troubled youth.



These cages, these Pandora’s boxes, contain animals. Many of them. Of all shapes and sizes. But they’re all wrong, oh so wrong.



Their eyes are the first thing a passerby would get caught by. They are all wide open yet glazed over, looking almost like deers caught in a headlight. Make no mistake, however, these creatures are not the docile lambs you might believe them to be, for these eyes hold nothing but malice in them.



I have never looked upon such a thing in animals before. The lion eats to keep from hunger, the coyote kills the chicken because it cannot hunt as profitably in the wild. But looking into the eyes of those creatures, for I cannot refer to those things as any less than that, I can feel their intent, their cathartic need, to attack some living being and make it suffer.



This was almost bad enough that I did not notice what else was wrong with them, but again, my tricky mind hid the ugly reality from me. For there was something else, something terribly, horribly worse, that was anormal with these beings.



They were all utterly malformed, but these malformations appeared to be ever more of the malicious kinds these things seemed to seep into the very air around them. The first I noticed was a goat, its maleficent yellow eyes calling to me in the darkness. A seemingly extra hollowed out jaw was dangling from under its bearded chin. The raw, red flesh glinting in the dim light of the laboratory. The teeth on it were all misshapen, turning inwards and joining in impossible angles.



Following this discovery, I made several others. There, a wolf with an extra set of hindlegs, turned the wrong way and clearly underdeveloped. Here, a badger with dozens of prehensile probes growing from its back, looking like squirming worms burrowing in its flesh.



The wrongness of it all disgusts me. I don’t want to see more, I cannot see more. 



I turn around, facing Dr Montauk and her grim retinue, ready to finally understand what is going on. They seem to notice the look on my face, and probably how pale I’ve gotten, as they finally motion me outside the cursed room. 



Taking the most pure feeling breath in my whole life, I take a moment for my mind to settle on everything I’ve just seen, before finally asking my burning questions.

“So, this anormal virus, it can affect the fucking Hox genes of species ? Just like that ?” I ask, slightly shaking.



The Hox genes, or what’s more commonly known as the master regulators of development, are constantly working in the background, giving your body the specific structure it’s supposed to have, emphasis on supposed.



However, these genes are only really active during embryonic development, so as for the infant to develop properly, but become essentially useless afterwards. If they somehow get activated again, this could lead to body parts continuing to grow in unexpected ways, even turning into different limb types, wildly altering the nature of the tissue.



“That would be right, it’s using a very aggressive form of DNA methylation we haven’t encountered before.” Her grim tone tells me she was hoping to be proven wrong.



I start pacing, thoughts racing through my mind like stars showering a summer night.



This is huge, but in a bad way. A virus of a kind we’ve never seen before, who can potentially affect any species at completely random, and significantly affect not only their behaviour but also their morphology.



What’s the end goal. My thesis posits that viruses all exist with a goal, as opposed to what the deniers that they are alive say. Most viruses exist to reproduce, to make copies of themselves. That is life. 



Some, however, have some sort of other, secondary goal. Indeed, the unique ‘Braconid’ virus, a type of polydnavirus, possesses a completely unique relationship with the Braconid species of wasps. They cannot exist without one another. The virus exists completely peacefully within the wasp, not ever harming it, but whenever the wasp needs to reproduce, it will inject eggs into a living host, most often a caterpillar. The virus then springs into action, affecting the host’s behaviour to turn it into both incubator and living food bank for the would-be offspring.



This relationship, in my eyes at least, is proof enough that viruses are capable of having goals, to be more than mindless infectors who endlessly duplicate. And it’s why I’m terrified of the possible implications of what goals such a virus as the one I’m discovering today could have.



“Doctor,” I resolve myself to ask. “you’ve read my theories, and whether you believe them or not, you’re here today because of it.”



She goes to defend herself, but I cut in.



“What do you think the goal of this thing is ? What is it trying to do ? Why these drastic physiological and behavioral changes ?”



Before she can answer, her phone beeps. Three times to be exact, the three rings of the clock for a coming apocalypse. 

She picks up. I would try to get closer to listen in on what’s going on, but the burly looking agent from earlier gives me a stern look that says plainly “just try”.



The incomprehensible chatter from the phone buzzes uncomfortably for dozens of seconds, uninterrupted, permeating strangely in the echoing silence of the room.



A look of dread slowly grows on Dr Montauk’s face. At first it’s subtle, the slight dropping of her jaw, the angle of her brows moving almost imperceptibly. But it spreads more, her eyes give in to despair for a fleeting instant, gone so fast I almost think I imagined it.



She simply puts up the receiver to her face and declares “Understood”. The following static indicating the other line cut the connection.



She breaths a sigh, the literal weight of the world on her shoulders.



“Pack up, boys, we’re headed back to HQ”



In an instant all the agents are on it, grabbing monitors, crates, and those wretched cages and hauling them on shoulders, or grabbing at multiple ends for the larger objects.



Before I can even register the situation, the burly agent turns to me, seeing as Dr Montauk seems to be too busy to bother with me.



“You’ll be riding with me, four eyes”



“Where are we going, hm, sir…?”



“Teners. Special agent Ben Teners, but you can just call me Ben. We’re heading to homebase, in Blue Ridge Mountain, West Virginia.”



“But why, all of a sudden ?”



“From the looks of it, this thing’s spread a lot more, and a lot faster. We’re needed to try to damage control.”



With that, he simply turns around and starts walking. Though he makes no indication that I should follow, I do regardless as he announced I was coming too.



Once outside the building, I start towards my car, but Ben calls out my name. I cringe, only for a moment, and turn around.



“Buddy, you’re not gonna drive all those miles in that dusty old thing, get in here.” He motions to his overlarge slick black truck.



I’ve never been in those overly obvious federal vehicles, but at least I’m not driving.

**The Overfull Beginning**



Dry heels cracked between the same two floorboards each morning before breakfast woke up. A gentle path past not enough clutter to delay the morning always lead straight to coffee. Straight in the way that the steps haven’t been taken but the intent has, or the coffee is tasted before the first drop of water, itself, wakes up. Not a thing was different this morning. Not of her steps, not the floorboards, did she think. But this was a passage, her passage, through the doorway into another day. Another day that started the same, but may not be.



Countertop nudged her hip in the way bossy laminate must keep its waitresses in tempo. She opened to the cold air of her fridge knowing her craving wouldn’t be found in anything but the bottom of her blue mug. She sighed and looked at it all anyway. With a turn and a thump that might suggest air got the wind knocked out of it, she approached the altar to some Barista’s Finest. Finally, though right on time.



Sharpness bit somewhere below her knee and, watched by a device hosting water’s favorite way to be boiled, she gasped, winced, and looked down. There was nothing there but what she knew was attached, and what she knew was unclothed. It must be the bite of some muscle she hasn’t worked out enough.



The right sequence occurred and gentle aroma heralded coffee’s yawn. Perhaps there was enough time to get the paper, and her feet already knew they’d greet her welcome mat on the way through a door none made ice for. Outside, a cool air waved, the only neighbor finding warmth in what would be oversight to the others. The paper was sometimes here but today it was just there. Slightly damp, without need for answers, without interrupting whatever was Breaking yesterday.



She would’ve gathered a breath that mixed Some Barista’s Finest with the farm down the road if she had not turned back inside at the precise moment she did. She loved cows without the smell of cow, even without having truly met one. 



A shower would betray how busy she has been.



Sitting down now would do the same, but guiltier.



Back towards the fridge that was now ready, her hands offered her eyes a moment to glaze over while she gathered eggs or butter or pass by whatever label her fruit squeezings chose this year. The rest was simple, and there may be disruptions, but they were not bright. The newspaper sagged longingly towards the bin cradling its brethren. It sighed with her, quieter, sharing the feeling that the words would not feel good. 



All were happy when she cupped her mug closer to her face. No news, only aroma that is closer now. To predict how many secrets the paper would keep was almost play for most of the chairs, the sink’s pots, and every floor tile on the way. Nearly dropped off to the bin but-



The glass of her window shrieked in worry that it knows what touch feels like now. A tap, a scratch, but certainly that glass. She stopped and quickly looked towards the window. One hand was warm with condensation, the other damp with paper. And then there was a squirrel, not tapping but chewing. She locked with its gaze and for a moment wasn’t sure who was caught.



As if recognizing what challenge could be, the bushy tail of the squirrel rocketed its fluff upward to hide the creature’s escape. She immediately, as if pulled by some acorn-shaped gravity, hurried towards the window. She didn’t worry how much coffee leapt with the hope of tasting Floor or if the other papers were patient enough to wait. She needed this.



It was a window. Well, a window and a squirrel outside doing exceedingly normal things. Something there felt it, but it really wasn’t anything particular. Her at the window, squirrel outside the window, and the window. All of it was normal and something didn’t feel wrong, but it felt.



Maybe her eggs were ready, or the roads knew she was on the brink of being a few minutes late, but she turned away. Coffee relaxed into her cup while the newspaper sagged the whole way to the bin.



Forgetting her table was for dining, she sank into her couch. Her mug kissed its coaster, leaving a wet ring of its personally blended lipstick below. Steam pirouetted above, proud to be the smelliest of all vapor around. A modest TV screen winked its gaze at them all, seeing everything precisely without all the details. She didn’t. She looked back at the window but from a more comfortable space and without the squirrel.



Looking through the window at that angle could almost see ice. Not the kind made for doors and drinks, or that encourages a coat or light vest. The kind that builds sculptures and memories of skating. She distinctly felt her eyes and thanked them, comparing how wet they were to how that particular ice might feel the second after it decides to melt. It was, however, brief in the way talking to a customer too long while working your first day at an old job is.



It was time for coffee. It was also time for her lips to question why the liquid was no longer lukewarm, or her nostrils to query where the vapor had gone.



She must be late for work.



These things will all be here tomorrow, but a second later than six minutes early for her job will be noticed. Different in ways she doesn’t know and won’t think to perceive.

  
  
  


# Chapter 2: 

**Learning What Matters**



It is never the jingle of a bell, the hum of a crowd that can be drowned in, or the frantic hair stylings of the previous shift that forecast the workday. It could be, but they are all determined by the only set of follicles that matter but refuse to remain until the end of the workday. That is fine and predictable the same way you shouldn’t warm an old coin too much. Which can also be explained but doesn’t predict the day.



It is unusual, however, to see one particular booth or desk sit both empty and clean. It is an absence eyebrows raise to fill, but only to prove they are first. There is a flow to follow now and she was almost precisely on time, so there is none to waste.Words are captured by her initiative, or they’re already ahead. She doesn’t need them to begin anyway.



“Coffee?”



She would shake her head. She likes it just fine, but prefers it certainly and something different now. And the question was from someone else to a patron. Either way, the booth creaked warmly.



Before she ordered, a man entered and uncertainly placed himself. Her order was the usual and mostly a formality. His was disorder, but it became less permanent when his coat was off. Perhaps a hidden inside pocket kept too sharp a secret. The color on her nails loved to feel each lacquered chip on the table as a handshake to their impermanence. Speed wasn’t usually part of her order but it was today and a smile actually accompanied it.



So did coffee.



Her eyes were as confused as the grunt she must’ve made at seeing its heated, dental-ad white enamel begin to steam up her lacquer. The waitress shrugged while her hair tousled. Her nude or overworked nails pointed somehow longly towards the man who she only identified by the freshness of the snow in his hair. The rest of his face was shielded by a hand deliberately intervening yet somehow highlighting whatever this was. 



“Send a coffee that way, he said. I ain’t one to question.”



Maybe the three stared or laughed or obliterated from sheer embarrassment that something could be so out of place. But the moment passed and so did the waitress’ attention to someone who wouldn't give her the exact same, inflation adjusted tip.



She had to get up and she did and she went straight through the door that must’ve just welcomed her, bells in reverse this time. What left her then was something alongside a yoga breath, just completely bereft of actual release or relief. Her neck beckoned the rest to journey to her booth but only her head followed, and only then did she see nothing but the brick in between. That, and the overwhelming sense that her decision may have been the worst of the ones she would have imagined now. 



Jingle.



“John. Sorry.”



Those weren’t names, just icebreakers without manilla. Their eyes were magnets that were each too polite to choose the direction they’d both spin with proximity. His name did not live up to the emotion that crashed around him.



“I didn’t mean, well, I didn’t mean anything really. I actually was trying to tell her to get me a copy.”



He pointed at her food and she nearly barked in protection, but realized he wasn’t a threat.



“It looked like pancakes but better. And, yeah, I can see you’re not really into this.”



She wasn’t because she had absolutely no clue what he was talking about through nearly any of those words. She only knew those were her pancakes, ordered in a language between her and these specific walls. She offered to be friendly.



He offered a crisp twenty. The bill, not anything that would make sense here or now.



“Thanks. Take this for your special. Maybe you can teach me how to order it properly next-” condensation wanted to form, “Nevermind.”



Remarkable that a coat and mumbling created grenades, and even more that someone could ever forget. Of course the bill was soggy. Tailbones and fibrously-ripped cushions act like real magnets. A vortex of mis-mumbled and insincere byes warped her back to her exact spot.



She didn’t know where he sat afterwords. Whether or not it was his previous spot is entirely inconsequential. Her fork missed the mapled fluff a lot today, and the once-white plate screeched each time. The coffee was half there, and half appreciated, by the time she left exact change plus exactly more tip.



Jangle.

# Chapter 3: 

**Fragile Waking**



She sat there on the floor, lotioned heels pressing sole to the floor but beneath the table.



He entered, but not as a lover or an enigma, but a presence.



And within that presence is you.



Not you, the reader, or you the character.



But you.

1pqbziz,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1pqbziz/ending_engagement_over_mismatched_physical/,Ending engagement over mismatched physical intimacy wants/needs? M25 F25,"Hi all, my (F25) fiance (25M) recently got engaged. We've been together for 4 years. At the time, I was really excited about it, but I've recently been thinking about whether this is what I truly want for the rest of my life. 

Things are generally good. We have a house. We both have high paying jobs. But recently, I've felt like there's not much affection. And I think it's always been that way, I just never noticed because we were both so busy, and I also just tried to convince myself that I was being too needy. 

Now, I'm feeling a lot more desire. We have sex often enough, maybe three days a week. But it's very mechanical, no kissing or anything like that. We actually don't really kiss, at all. Little pecks here and there. I've tried initiating deeper/longer kisses, but usually he pulls away quickly. We've talked about this, and there's a very slight improvement, but not much. I know he's not big on kissing, but he's also not big on other forms of touch. He can tolerate a few minutes of cuddling. Hugs are fine. Some hand holding sometimes. I'm just not sure if I'm expecting too much, if this is normal over time? I'm not asking to have long make out sessions, not that we ever did, and I think about it often. We just don't have that kind of passion.

There's also a strong mismatch in the house labor. We've talked about it, and it has not gotten better. If I don't do all the tasks, they just don't get done. At one point while I was in grad school, nothing got cleaned for 5 months. I will give him credit in that he does cook on an almost daily basis. I know that is a lot of work, and I appreciate that he does do that. 

There's also little in the way of verbal affection or random ""thinking of you"" gifts. When we were earlier in our dating, I used to write him little love letters. They made him emotional and it meant a lot to him. I also brought him coffee pretty regularly. But he never, or extremely rarely, did anything like that for me, and eventually I stopped doing things like that. I stopped planning dates as well, and many months went by in a dry routine.

We nearly broke up as a result of these things. He begged me for another chance, said he just didn't know, said he would try harder and he sees how he should have put in effort. He admits he got comfortable. It's been about a month, and I can't say much has changed. I know he is trying more, but I'm not sure it's enough. He's also against couples counseling. And as with the physical intimacy, he can't change who he is on that front. 

I'd like any opinions here. Am I being unreasonable? Am I expecting too much? Is this normal in LTR? Would I be silly to end this? 

He does love me, I know he does. I know I bring him great comfort and we do talk well and enjoy each other's company. We talk and enjoy each other's humor. We do have intimacy and enjoy it, but I'm certainly craving way more than he feels comfortable providing. There's a lot of good here still, so I don't want to be irrational.

I visited the city early december this year and while it was freezing cold, the vibe around the city felt magical and warm. I haven’t had enough time for the full experience especially exploring the nightlife in the village.

I recently had a coffee chat with a professional who has lived in Vancouver her whole life and she spontaneously asked me this question of if I am interested in moving across the country for a better social life/dating experience (which also is beneficial for my career) and that the social scene in Vancouver sucks.

Middle easterners in Vancouver are very rare and the ones that I know of are not integrated/present especially in the gay community here. We are not perceived well here n especially in the gay community.

this is a summary of my observations from the last 5 yrs:

1.	⁠⁠Beauty standards are very much white n asian centric, and I am oftentimes not seen as attractive whereas during my last visits to montreal and Toronto I noticed a much bigger and better integrated middle eastern presence in the gay villages of both cities while in Vancouver I see none!!!
2.	⁠⁠Vancouver is very transient and 7 out of every 10 ppl I got to know in the last 5 yrs left the city already and the other 3 r strongly considering it,
3.	⁠⁠The city and the demographics of it suck big time to the extent that I dated a guy once and I realized after my 2nd date that I have dated his bf last month, so a very small pool of ppl,
4.	⁠⁠I know this is a universal issue across the country but affordability is also a major issue here where ppl are always running around to afford life n that leaves them with no time to date or socialize which is evident in the flakiness of the people here and them being very socially awkward all the time,
5.	⁠⁠While I had many crushes on Asian guys and I am not a person with racial preferences, I don’t find the mainstream attractive (mainly bc I am 6’1 and height is an important factor for me lol) and the city is packed with twinks,

Now aside from the French language barrier (which I know is essential and I assure you that I will do my best to master it if I move there) do u think as a gay man I will have a better life in Montreal and my dating options will open up better?",0,1766118672.0,montreal,8,0.35,False

1pqbxdt,https://www.reddit.com/r/robloxjailbreak/comments/1pqbxdt/how_to_fix_jailbreak/,How to Fix Jailbreak,"I know this won't be popular, but these are the changes I believe need to be made to fix Jailbreak and make it great again.

#1: No personal garage. While I agree it's fun, being able to spawn a 200 mph car anywhere you go is ridiculous. Removing this would ensure that instead of grinding for insane hypercars, the player is encouraged to buy fun, cheap cars all throughout the map, making escape easy anywhere.

#2: More small stores. I love small stores. I think they're a great way for new players to get the hang of robberies and get some cash without having to do a whole heist. Currently, stores are conveniently located at roads leading from the prison, where beginners might wander. But why is there no store in/close to either city? Add a coffee shop or something.

#3: More map, less cars. I don't know if you could tell, but I really don't care about new flashy cars being added. I think the hundreds we have are enough. Same goes for all the season pass junk. Instead, can we just have an update full of map stuff? The open world is what makes Jailbreak fun.

#4: Down criminals. Instead of having to use handcuffs for every person (hard for cops and infuriating for criminals), cops can just kill the criminal, putting them in a downed state. Then they can move in with handcuffs. This way, there's no longer a need to multitask between combat and arrest. They can still use handcuffs to end robberies or if a criminal is really close, but the time required to arrest is doubled. 

#5: Better bounties. Starts at $500. Goes up by $750 per day they're uncaught. $2000 every robbery, $3000 every kill. Make bounties high: no reason why 10 criminals should = 20 seconds on the cargo train.",0,1766118526.0,robloxjailbreak,9,0.17,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1pqbsct,https://www.reddit.com/r/pluribustv/comments/1pqbsct/episode_8_scene_about_ice_cream/,Episode 8 scene about ice cream,"Regarding the following Episode 8 Dialogue lifted from TV Transcripts website:

Carol: What is your favorite food?

Zosia: >!\[whisking stops\] Mango ice cream. I love mango ice cream. \[chuckles\]!<

>!There was an old man in my neighborhood who sold it out of a little cart. I would watch the ships leaving Gdańsk. Brand new. First voyage.!<

>!I was maybe… ten years old? And I was fascinated by these giant ships. Who built them? What for? Where were they going?!<

**And now I know.**

>!\[inhales sharply\] Sometimes, the man with the cart would hand out ice cream bars to us!<  
>!when he had too many to sell. He knew we didn't have two coins to rub together. It was just after the country had opened up, and suddenly he had new flavors. Mint, coffee, peach. But… \[chuckles\] …mango, that was my favorite. \[chuckles\] \[both chuckle softly\]!<

>!Carol: Thank you for sharing that. \[unsettling music playing\] Zosia?!<

>!Zosia: \[inhales sharply\] You're going to have a visitor.!<

Lots of people have remarked on the moment where we wonder if Carol is sparking the individuality of original Zosia: she’s noticeably better at the “I” pronoun, and we see Zosia>!freeze!<but right before she says >!someone’s coming,!<very much like in the earlier episode >!with Diabete about to get a visit from Carol.!<

But what I wonder about is the memory itself!  This was a good episode for frank explanation about the nature of the Pluribus/hive.  The part I find most interesting is when Zosia says “and now I know”:

Who is the “I” that knows?  The mind that remembers the child’s questions also has all the answers from the view of the ice cream seller, so what does that mean about this mind now?  Interestingly, Zosia continues to dwell on the personal individual memory, rather than go all Wikipedia on the political and economic history of Poland.  Is this genuine, manipulative, some combination of the two?

Now this scene also reminds me of Carol’s sharp point about Bri the waitress having her own life in Miami—in which Carol was completely unimportant—pulled out from under her feet by the Joining, so that now she’s airlifted back to Albuquerque to playact on a freshly made stage for Carol’s emotional appeasement (or distraction or both).  Just how tragic that is for Bri.  Therefore likewise for original Zosia.
