1mghw87,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewTheRoom/comments/1mghw87/does_the_breville_precision_brewer_make_the_best/,Does the Breville Precision Brewer Make the Best Drip Coffee?,"Breville BDC450BSS1BUS1 has been my go-to appliance for brewing coffee in the mornings, and I've put it through its paces over the past few weeks. This drip coffee machine caught my attention with its brushed stainless steel design, programmable features, and advanced brewing options that promise third-wave specialty coffee. Here's an honest take on how it performed for me and the people around me. 

**Design and Aesthetics**  
The brushed stainless steel finish on this coffee maker instantly elevates the vibe of my kitchen. Its modern look, combined with compact dimensions (12.72"" D x 6.69"" W x 15.75"" H), means it doesn’t eat up a lot of counter space. I’ve had guests at my place comment on how great it looks, especially since it complements other appliances seamlessly. The buttons are user-friendly, and the display is easy to read, even when fumbling for caffeine early in the morning after a late night.

**Performance and Brewing Modes**  
This machine offers six unique brewing modes, including Gold, Fast, Strong, Iced, Cold Brew, and My Brew. Testing these over time was fun. I loved using the “Gold” mode on weekdays, which adjusts water temperature and brewing time according to SCA standards, ensuring I get my coffee at the ideal temperature (197 to 204 degrees). The “Cold Brew” is a game-changer during summer days, as it produces smooth, flavorful coffee over an extended brewing time. My spouse, who prefers stronger coffee, swears by the “Strong” mode, and let me tell you, it delivers a robust cup without any bitterness. 

""Check [Breville BDC450BSS1BUS1](https://ngadgets.com/p/b078rqvqf1/) price on Amazon.""  

**Automatic Features and Customization Options**  
This coffee maker boasts precise digital temperature control (PID) and three different flow rates, so you can tweak it to your liking. I enjoyed experimenting with the “My Brew” setting, adjusting bloom time, temperature, and flow rates to get coffee that matched my mood on any given day. The flow control improved the contact time between water and coffee grounds, making each brew more satisfying. One thing I appreciated was the Steep and Release valve, which adjusts brewing for small servings without needing the carafe, allowing you to customize a single cup of coffee. 

**Dual Filter Choices and Versatility**  
The inclusion of both flat-bottom and cone filter baskets was perfect. During gatherings, I used the larger flat-bottom filter to brew a full carafe, and for solo mornings, the cone basket provided a precise, smaller yield. For fans of pour-over coffee, it’s compatible with drippers like Hario V6. My best friend, who came over for an impromptu coffee tasting, was particularly impressed by how versatile this machine is. We even tested the pour-over adapter, and the results were just as clean and rich as manual brewing! 

**Positives**  
- Exceptionally versatile with six brewing modes.  
- SCA-certified Gold mode ensures quality coffee every time.  
- The programmable My Brew feature caters to personalized coffee preferences.  
- Includes reusable and eco-friendly filter options.  
- Designed with a sleek and minimal brushed stainless steel exterior.  

**Shortcomings**  
- Slightly loud when operating, which caught me off guard early in the morning.  
- The thermal carafe doesn’t keep coffee hot as long as I’d hoped, especially if you’re brewing for later.  
- Frequent cleaning required, particularly if you’re switching between brewing modes daily.  
- It’s a bit of a learning curve initially with all the features.

**Product Comparisons**  
When comparing this coffee maker to competitors like the Technivorm Moccamaster, I noticed some distinctions. The Moccamaster delivers excellent simplicity and durability but lacks the customization that this machine offers. Another rival, the Ninja Hot and Cold Brewed System, provided a wider range of drink types but didn’t quite hit the precise temperature control or meet SCA standards. Considering the strengths, the Breville BDC450BSS1BUS1 feels better suited for those who appreciate experimental brewing. 

**Bang for the Buck**  
With its advanced features, brewing versatility, and premium finish, this coffee maker feels like an investment in good coffee, though its price point skews slightly higher than some entry-level drip machines. However, the number of customizations and brewing modes justifies this for coffee enthusiasts. Those who often buy pre-brewed specialty coffee from cafes will find this machine a cost-effective alternative over time.

I thought I was close with the two wives. But they were flakey with making plans. I stopped trying a year ago and haven’t seen them since. 

I tried ONE MORE TIME by reaching out just to the one wife I feel closer to (who occasionally texts me about a common interest). I invited her to get coffee - just the two of us, so no complications with scheduling lots of people. She said yes and would get back to me with her schedule when she got home that day. But she didn’t. It’s been a few days and I can take a hint lol. 

It turns out my husband also texted the same person around the same time as me - complete coincidence since he never does that. He was trying to invite their family over for a weekend later this month. I’m assuming that will not happen.

1mght58,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sardinia/comments/1mght58/action_history_beach_canyon_roundtrip/,"Action, History, Beach, Canyon Roundtrip","Hi everyone,

I’m planning a trip to Sardinia and would love some feedback on my itinerary as well as any suggestions for improvements. To help plan, I prompted ChatGPT with a map containing various itineraries, and it generated a route for me. Right now, the plan is a bit too spread out, so ideally we want to stay in about 4 different hotels to keep travel time manageable.

We’re really interested in experiencing Sardinia’s nature and culture — including its food, drinks, history, and the origins of the island. I’m considering staying at Janas Country Resort (3. - 8.9.) in Ozieri because it offers breakfast and a fitness center, which are very important to me since I’ll be working remotely from there. On workdays, I can only do tours in the afternoon.

If anyone has recommendations for good boat tours, cooking classes, or other activities worth doing, I’d really appreciate your tips!

Starting week 6. Still taking 2 bupropion and 1/2 naltrexone in the mornings. Nothing else. Still feeling good, no major side effects.  I don’t really feel like I want to eat in the mornings, so I usually have the pills with a banana or yogurt or one egg. Added creatine into the mix this week, so likely holding a little water, which is fine. 

Biggest changes I’ve made are daily exercise, cutting caffeine completely (I think that and the bupropion were giving me crazy anxiety), and replacing my morning coffee with electrolytes.  Try to get in a 20-30 minute walk every day, plus a 20-30 minute strength class via peloton.  If I’m crunched for time, I’ll hop on the bike and do a hard 30 mins. Via apple watch tracking, I’m shooting for 1000 active calories/day, which I either hit or get close 5 or so days a week. Overall I feel great, down two pant sizes and looking forward to continuing down this road! ",1,1754223293.0,HimsWeightloss,0,1.0,False

My name's Brian from the Netherlands. Currently, I'm working towards a bachelor degree majoring in communication and work a little on the side, but that's stuff that's boring, so enough about that. I like gaming on my Switch, PC and PlayStation and I do a teeny tiny bit of photography and sketching when I get inspired. The sketching I do both on paper with pencils and digitally using a pen display. I usually also watch sci-fi/fantasy series and movies, and on occasion animated shows (like anime or western animation). I'm very introverted and be a bit shy until I get comfortable talking to you.

I'm looking for someone about my age that is also looking for a serious long term relationship. While I have little prior experience with relationships, I do value strong connections and want to build a special and even stronger one. I wouldn't say I have any set preferences in terms of appearances, but I do prefer being around a similar age. While I'm also not against an LDR, I prefer someone who lives nearby (nearby = Netherlands/Belgium/UK/Germany), but it's not an issue if you live farther away. It's not a problem for me if the distance between us is big. Because if the spark is there, then no distance will be too great. Of course, I'm open to just being friends too, but that's if we end up not being compatible as more.

I have sent to this domme covering her coffees and breakfast here and there, and then I saw in her bio she does cashmeets. I asked if she was free to do one and we agreed a time. She asked how much I was able to give to her and I told her I have £250 to last me until payday which was in 14 days time and asked her to chose a fair and reasonable amount to hand to her.  I was thinking she’d say around £100 but she suggested £200 leaving me only £50 to last till payday. I knew this would really leave me struggling until the end of the month but I couldn’t say no. Also bear in mind that I had already sent for her breakfast that morning. 

I arrived at the location  (it was discreet) and told me she’ll be there in 2 minutes. My heart was absolutely racing. She came and she looked so so hot. She was around 5’3 and she wore a tight top with black leggings and her ass looked amazing (Ass in leggings gets me so weak). Anyways she wasted no time and told me to get on my knees, which I instantly did, and  I counted the £200 out to her and placed it in her hands. She then started slapping me and making me tell her that I will continue to serve her by covering her coffees and breakfasts and giving her cash in person. She then demanded that I lick the bottom of her worn flip flops in which I bowed down and started licking. It was slightly dirty and I could feel little bits of dirt and dust on my tongue as I was licking. She lifted her other foot and I did the same. I was then asked to lay down on my back and she then stepped on to me and started trampling me for around 30 seconds. I don’t have much trampling experience but I was able to just about tolerate her weight even though her trampling consisted of her doing a jog on me.

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it’s time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero’s journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can’t even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don’t wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

1mghh7v,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1mghh7v/glowdown/,Glowdown,"I’m not afraid to admit it: I hate aliens. All of ‘em. (Except the small pink puff-balls, they hum, hand out origami goats, and mind their own business. Fine. Whatever.)

When the tall chrome ones landed last year, my twins, Milo and Eden, went feral. One influencer collab, and the whole planet was chanting #BeBeyondHuman. Every feed, every billboard, every ad break: Become Sleek. Become Serene. Become Them.

Five minutes later, junior-high kids were live-streaming “alignment reveals” like it was gender-reveal season on meth. Surgeons offered payment plans. Fashion labels dropped “pre-surgery” capsule lines. Even the PTA held an info night. I showed up, asked whether rearranging a teenager’s organs to look “extra-terrestrial chic” sounded sane, and got heckled for being “carbon-centric.”

My own house turned into a spa-slash-lab, because Mom said we can’t alienate them. Alienate? The twins injected glow juice, stretched bones, tattooed star maps under their skin. They hummed in two-part harmony while vaping blueberry poison in the bathroom. I told them the only thing transcending was their IQ… straight off a cliff. They posted a reaction TikTok titled “Boomer Dad Can’t Evolve.” Two million likes. The day after Dina from HR emailed to ask if I’d be open to a “mod-positive parenting seminar.”

The trend mushroomed. “Fluorescent Friday” dress codes at schools. Companies started offering “Mod Leave”: paid time off so employees could recover from bone-stretching, organ donating, or dermal glow implants, just in time to return for all-hands chants about “embracing the beyond.” Meanwhile, every teen celeb from pop stars to Twitch streamers was flaunting their new chrome jawlines on Insta like human biology was just another trend they were too cool to keep.

Then, snap… everything went sideways.

Friday night: Milo coughs up a fist-sized pearl of translucent sludge into the sink, shrugs, asks for vodka mixers. Saturday: Eden’s eyes strobe like a broken disco ball; she claims it’s “just a firmware update.”

Monday morning, half the senior class collapses mid-assembly, bodies spasming, humming louder and \*louder\* until the gym ceiling lights explode. By lunch, #GlowFlu tops every trend graph. Hospitals overflow with twitching neon teenagers leaking whatever they’d marinated their organs in.

News anchors start screaming on air... literally. One rips his tie off, points at the camera, and yells, “IF YOU’RE LEAKING, TURN YOURSELF IN.” National guard rolls out. Doctors can’t intubate because throats are lined with chrome cartilage. Nobody has a clue \*why\* kids are melting, and the aliens? Silent. Not a press conference, not a tweet, nothing.

Cities go dusk-dark. Rolling blackouts, sirens, dumpster fires. My feed is wall-to-wall disaster: joy-spray clinics boarded up; modded influencers convulsing live while subscribers spam heart emojis. The world \*finally\* agrees: apocalypse officially in progress.

Then, at 4:07 a.m. Wednesday, I step onto the balcony, coffee scorched, nerves fried, and see them leaving. Sleek silver sardine cans clawing holes through the dawn, engines whining like dental drills. One spaceship crashed into a vape billboard (“CHROME BREATH – Glow from the inside out”) and cartwheeled into the ocean in a plume of purple fire. No goodbye, no “thanks for the organs,” just gone, real-life massive ghosting.

 Inside, Milo and Eden lie on the floor in a nest of chip bags, Four Loko cans, and an upside-down yoga mat. Their glow’s down to “sad motel vacancy sign.”

“You two alive?”

“Starving,” Eden croaks.

“For what?”

“Grease,” Milo grunts, already on the phone, thumb-deep in an app ordering burgers the size of hubcaps.

Weeks later, doctors mumbled something about “foreign embryonic rejection” and “host toxicity.” Turns out the mods weren’t just cosmetic, they implanted parasitic embryos, part of a galaxy-scale invasion plan. But teenagers vaped, drank, microwaved energy drinks, and lived off gas-station sushi. The embryos never stood a chance. Humanity’s last line of defense? Hot Cheetos, Four Loko, and bodies too toxic to colonize.

And yeah... I still hate aliens. Except the pink puff-balls. One left an origami goat on the porch yesterday. It unfolded, blinked, and whispered, “What sages missed, brainless juveniles have ceased.”

Turns out the galaxy’s most lethal bio-weapon is teenage stupidity — obliterates galactic takeovers but still can’t be bothered to flush the toilet.

We met during my freshman year and his junior year of college. He graduated 2 years ago (he was ahead for his age) and has since been working full-time at a well-paying job. I’m still in college and work part-time at a campus coffee shop, but my income is obviously a lot smaller compared to his.

When we were both students, we used to split things pretty evenly. I never wanted to come off as someone who expects to be treated or “taken care of,” so I’d often pay for coffee or lunch while he covered dinner. It felt fair at the time since we were both broke students.

But now that he’s working and earning significantly more, I’ve started to feel like I’d appreciate it if he were more willing to treat me sometimes, like covering more of our dates or surprising me with little gifts here and there. I see my friends’ boyfriends paying for all their meals and even offering to cover things when they go shopping, and I can’t help but wonder if it’s fair to hope for a little more generosity from my partner.

To be clear, he does get me gifts on special occasions like birthdays, but outside of that, he doesn’t really offer to pay for my things or go out of his way to do anything extra financially.

I’m worried that I might sound ungrateful or like I’m taking him for granted, which I truly don’t want to do. But I also wonder if this is a valid feeling to have, and if it is, how do I bring it up without sounding entitled?

Would really appreciate any perspective or advice. Is this something worth talking about? And if so, how do I even begin that conversation?

I recently purchased  a Chicoine Glass Top Coffee Table in black from Wayfair. It was a “like-new” open box and sold on a reduced price — so a win-win for both parties.

I got the shipment, and two key metal bars that connect all the various pieces were missing. 

I called and spoke to Wayfair and told him the situation, and I asked if I could just get a hold of those missing bars. After some discussion, the supervisor approved a refund for the amount I paid, since it doesn’t seem they could get ahold of the parts. 

While I appreciated the refund, I still don’t have a coffee table. My preference would’ve been to have them send me a new one (which is now in Closeout status) to replace the one with missing parts. The Wayfair representative didn’t seem to have the flexibility to offer that solution. 

I’ve had other retailers like JCPenney go above and beyond to solve product-related issues, so I was surprised that Wayfair’s solution was so limited.

I’m in the process of trying to source the bars myself, but this particular product was manufactured by a brand owned by Wayfair, lol. So if they can’t get it, IDK what I expect to achieve. 

If anyone has ideas on where I can affordably commission or source the missing parts, I’d be grateful. 🥹 ",1,1754221715.0,wayfair,1,1.0,False

Ozone – Cyberpunk neko boy

Name: Ozone
Nickname: “Ghostbyte” (street alias, whispered across darknet forums)
Species: Bioengineered Neko-Human Hybrid
Age: Appears 15–16 (actual age unknown)
Height: 1.45 m
Neurotype: Autistic, Dyslexic
IQ: 165 (he just doesn’t know how smart he is)
Role: Independent Hacker / Data Courier / Info-Broker
Alignment: neutral tries to no give a shit

⸻

Unique Ability: ChronoSync Field

Ozone can freeze time in his local area (up to ~15 meters radius) for up to 60 seconds.
	•	Comes at a mental and emotional cost—he experiences every second of the freeze in real-time, making prolonged use overwhelming and disorienting.
	•	While frozen, digital devices enter “time-lock” unless physically accessed—so he can grab files from offline terminals, slip past moving drones, or even steal a coffee mid-fight.
	•	Can extend the duration slightly by consuming synthetic ChronoSerum or if emotionally triggered.

⸻

Personality
	•	Quiet, shy, mostly thinking instead of talking unless it’s someone he’s close to but gets also talkative when a puzzle excites him.
	•	Talks to himself or his digital assistant (“Zii”) constantly.
	•	Doesn’t like violence, but won’t hesitate to pull the trigger when he must—he’s got a soft spot for old-school revolvers and long-range sniper rifles, especially custom ones he’s modded himself.
	•	Obsessed with finding patterns in chaos—data, emotion, time, love to just look at people and study them

⸻

Visual & Physical Design

Ozone is small, delicate, and undeniably adorable—especially in a world built from chrome, firewalls, and artificial gods. Standing at just 1.45 meters, he moves with light-footed grace and quiet elegance, almost like a ghost through the neon city.

His skin is smooth and pale, laced with faint artificial runes that softly glow blue in dim light. It’s highly sensitive to touch, a side-effect of his biotech being tuned for emotional feedback and neural interfacing.

Despite being male, he has small, perky A-cup chest residual from experimental gene sculpting and prototype imbalances. He doesn’t mind them. In fact, he enjoys the subtle pressure of tight layers against it they sometimes trigger little HUD spikes when touched.

His hips are softly rounded, and he carries a plush, curvy butt that often draws stares—whether he’s climbing through vents or leaning over a console. His body has an elasticity to it that makes him feel like a cuddle magnet, though he usually hides it under his gear. The softness is real—and he knows it.

His hair is white and cloudlike, naturally fluffy, When overwhelmed, stressed, or excited, it flickers with low-bit glitching blue—a visual side-effect of his emotional load spiking.
It’s long enough to fall around his face and cover most of his small human ears, which he prefers—he gets shy when people notice them.

He has four ears: two small human ones on each side of his head, and two expressive neko ears perched on top. The neko ears are lined with soft inner fluff and twitch depending on his mood. They fold down when embarrassed, flick when annoyed, and twitch when someone speaks his real name—which he dislikes, unless it comes from someone he deeply trusts. Those rare few may even call him “fluff ball.”

His right eye is a pale holographic blue, capable of processing datastreams in real time. His left eye is damage due to a corruption error in his creation. Its iris is a glitching rainbow data—beautiful, dangerous.

His hands are slender and precise—made for coding, modding, and high-speed revolver draws. His boots are soft-soled and noise-dampened, both for stealth and to protect his sensory sensitivity from the gritty textures of lower-city floors.

And his tail—fluffy, reactive, and expressive—is practically a second voice. It puffs up when scared, flicks when annoyed, and curls shyly around people he likes.

⸻

Outfit & Gear

Ozone’s outfit is a perfect fusion of tech, stealth, and personal comfort.

Coat:
He wears a long, black coat lined with stealth fabric, resistant to heat scans and passive tracking. Glowing blue circuit lines trace along the outer shell, pulsing softly in sync with his neural rhythms. It splits at the back to make room for his tail and allow quick access to his back-mounted weapon.
	•	Inner compartments hide datablades, tools, and snacks.
	•	Left arm contains a hidden touch-activated panel for hacking and interface commands.

Cyber Bodysuit:
Instead of a normal shirt, Ozone wears a sleek, long-sleeved bodysuit—similar to a swimsuit but futuristic. The soft, black material hugs his chest and torso with a high neckline while leaving his legs bare under his pants. It’s made from interface-reactive weave that adapts to his emotional state, regulates temperature, and can trigger stealth effects during time-freeze.
It’s snug, supportive, and… very cute. Especially when it peeks above the waistline of his pants.

Pants & Belt:
His black cargo pants are snug but stretchable, with thigh pockets packed with gadgets, ammo, and hacking gear. His belt system is asymmetrical:
	•	The left side rides high.
	•	The right side dips low over his hip.
	•	Both sides holster his matte-black revolvers in perfect quick-draw cross holsters they have biometric sensors in the handles so only he can fire them if someone else tries it’s like the safety is on

Sniper Rifle Mount – Sniper Spine:
Attached to the back of his bodysuit and resting flat under his coat is the Sniper Spine—a collapsible, high-caliber, ChronoSync-adapted rifle. Folded, it looks like a reinforced spinal plate. Unfolded, it becomes a long-range, nearly silent weapon, custom-built by Ozone himself.

Accessories & Tech:
	•	In his left human ear, he wears a sleek neural uplink headphone through which Zii, his AI companion, communicates. Zii monitors Ozone’s vitals, hacking targets, and emotional states—often with snarky or affectionate commentary. (Zii is ai ozone design by himself as he first fled his containment in sector 9 he was lonely and needed some to vent to)
	•	In his right neko ear, a tiny fold-out panel glows faintly blue when connected to a console. It’s embedded beneath the fur and pulses softly in sync with his stress levels or data intake also changes colour depending on his mood blue when relaxed yellow when sleeping/lost in thoughts and red when stressed 

⸻

Backstory

Ozone wasn’t born—he was assembled in a decaying lab beneath Sector 9, where corporate prototypes were discarded like old tools. He was thrown out because of his flaws (Autism, dyslexia and for his production line a low IQ) but he managed and Among cybernetic scraps and black-market code, he taught himself to survive. To adapt. And to vanish.

They call him:
	•	Ghostbyte – the one who never shows up on camera.
	•	The neko-boy with an eye that sees time.
	•	The one who always knows—but never chooses sides.

He trades in secrets.
Not for power.
Not for loyalty.
But for comfort, curiosity… and just enough credits to stay hidden.

His arsenal is precise:
	•	Two sleek matte-black revolvers, holstered low and deadly quiet.
	•	A collapsible sniper rifle, the Sniper Spine, saved for moments when escape isn’t an option.
He doesn’t kill often.
But when he does—it’s clean. Cold. And forgotten.

He could shift the balance of the city if he chose to care.
But he doesn’t.

⸻

Ozone’s Apartment – Ghostbyte’s Nest

Nestled high above the city’s glowing veins, Ozone’s home is his sanctuary.
	•	One wall is covered in sticky notes—colorful, chaotic, poetic. A mix of doodles, plans, and cryptic reminders.
	•	A holo-desk sits beneath it, lit by soft screens, scattered screws, and the remains of his last weapon mod.
	•	The opposite wall is a proud display of firepower: revolvers, sniper rifles, throwing knives, a few pistols, even a shotgun or two.
	•	In a sunlit corner rests a beanbag and a sun lamp, his favorite nap spot.
	•	His bed, low to the ground, is wrapped in plush blankets and tucked beside a recharge port for Zii’s uplink. It has a hide drawer underneath with some drawings of people and places.
	•	A spiral stair leads down to:
	•	A dark-tiled bathroom with an auto-shower.
	•	A cozy kitchenette stocked with synth-fruit, noodles, and an absurd number of mugs. ( some of the featuring 404: Emotions not found, Nyaa means no and worlds worst prototype. 
	•	A full workshop with every tool and tech mod imaginable with some prototype of his own that are to dangerous to use.

1mgh8fg,https://i.redd.it/0b6391zalsgf1.png,‘Ratcliffe and I have a no bulls--- relationship’ - Amorim,"Amorim has also opened up on his “no bulls---” relationship with Jim Ratcliffe and revealed the United co-owner often sends him GIFS on WhatsApp.

Amorim says he and Ratcliffe speak and message on a regular basis and that they get on because they are both straight talkers who refuse to sugar-coat their opinions.

Advertisement

Ratcliffe joked in an interview in March that when he sits down for a coffee with Amorim at United’s Carrington training ground and “tells him where it’s going wrong” that the Portuguese in turn “tells me to f--- off”.

And Amorim says one of the reasons they have hit it off is that they are both so open and honest with each other.

“We speak on the phone, he sends me messages, he sends me GIFs,” he revealed. “You call it GIFs? Like joking. So we have this kind of relationship.

“I think it’s really easy to deal with Jim. Easy in the sense that if you know your stuff, if you know how to explain any decision, you’ll be fine with him.

“If you try to use some bulls--- in big words with him, he’s going to knock you. So for me it’s really easy. I will say whatever I need to say with, of course, a lot of respect, like with everybody.

“I know that he’s the owner of the club, I know my place. But when I need to say something, I will say it naturally, with no bulls---.

“I can say that – with no bulls---. I’m not \[talking\] around the subject, I’m really direct and I think it’s something that he likes a lot.”

Sir Jim Ratcliffe, seen here consoling Amorim after the Europa League final defeat to Spurs, has a ‘no bull----’ relationship with the United manager Credit: Getty Images/Carl Recine

Amorim is United’s sixth permanent manager since Ferguson retired 12 years ago but he says he has been encouraged both by the hierarchy’s steadfast support for him amid last season’s struggles and their vision for the club.

“I always felt that \[backing\],” he said. “In some moments in the last season, I was more concerned about me than them. They always show the support and if you try to remember one team – one big team, massive team – that lost so many games and the manager kept their job, you will not find it.

“So that shows more than words that they support me. I think it’s really important to say to the fans that this is a club thing.

“Of course the manager is really important, but all this idea of the culture, how we want to buy players, what kind of players we want, is a club thing.

“In the meetings with \[new signings\] Bryan \[Mbeumo\], with \[Matheus\] Cunha, we said that – ‘Don’t go to a club because of the manager, go because of the idea of the club’. And they are here because of the idea of the club.”",7,1754221579.0,ManchesterUnited,0,1.0,False

I'm currently a few weeks into my increased dose of Zoloft (50mg) and so far I feel great for the most part! With this increase, I'm also taking a very low dose of Ritalin to help with my ADHD symptoms. 

Now, I've had ADHD for over 20 years and was taking Adderall as needed to help when I needed to focus in school and work. When I was starting off on Zoloft, I was told to take my Adderall everyday rather than as needed. I did this for a week 3 times within the past few months and eventually would have a panic attacks after a week of taking the Adderall everyday. May I mind you, this was a low dose I was taking. I also drank a cup of coffee everyday during those weeks, which I'm sure didnt help. 

I would tell my Psychologist about this and she would say Im 'sensitive' when it comes to medications and i should try Ritalin instead of Adderall while still being on the Zoloft. Everytime I mention this to my therapist, he always looks disappointed. I told him during our last session I wanted to start taking ADHD meds so I can slowly get off the Zoloft and be on that instead, which he understood.

My question is, for those who have taken ADHD medication with Zoloft, has these panic attacks happened to you? Do you think Ritalin would be better than Adderall when it comes to taking the Zoloft? ",1,1754221263.0,antidepressants,0,1.0,False

that only comes when your girls are near

Not a big day,
just a good one,
soft and simple,
the kind that reminds you
you’re still here,

1mggyuo,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1mggyuo/rf_my_way_in_black_ink/,"[RF] My Way, In Black Ink","The city was loud tonight — so loud that if you listened long enough, you’d hear your own heartbeat echo back in the glass windows and broken neon.
He liked it that way. The noise covered his thoughts; the lights made his shadows dance where no one could see them.

In another life — maybe — he’d have stayed obedient. Sat where they told him to sit. Answered how they wanted him to answer. He’d have worn the crown they forged for him — that circle of steel they called expectations. Maybe he’d have bowed his head forever, like everyone else.

But he didn’t.
And now, every step he took was proof that regret could never chain him for long.

He paused under a flickering streetlamp — cheap cigarette in his mouth, not lit, just there to bite down on when the world got too bitter. In his pocket, there was a letter he never sent — to the people who once called him son, student, success, disgrace. The same people who’d forgotten he had a voice that didn’t match theirs.

He smiled. Just a little. Enough to break the cold.
The city could roar. The shadows could talk. But the road under his feet?
That was his alone.

Tomorrow, he’d fight again — for a job maybe, or a dream, or just to stand taller than the man he was yesterday. He’d love, lose, build, destroy — on his terms. No borrowed crowns, no second-hand hopes.

If they asked him who he was — he’d tell them nothing.
They’d see it when he passed them by, walking that cracked concrete street.
A man without apologies.

A man who did it his way.
A man who still does.

Perfect — you brought it back. Good. Let’s honor that exact tone.
Your “My Way, In Black Ink” is urban, defiant, not feudal — the spirit is the same as Vagabond’s solitude but modern, hard-bitten, city-lit.
The regret is there, but it’s a living regret — not a deathbed sigh, but a restless promise.
So here’s the second scene, matching yours precisely:
---------------

Morning hits him like loose change in a tin can cheap, loud, never enough.
He hasn’t slept. He never does, not all the way. The bed is too soft for a man who learned to rest with one eye open and his back to the wall.

Coffee, burned. Shirt, wrinkled. Smile, practiced.
In the cracked mirror by the door, he runs a hand over the stubble he won’t shave yet — tomorrow, maybe. Or the day after.
Behind him, a stack of unpaid bills leans against a half-packed bag. He knows he’ll carry that weight somewhere else soon.
He always does.

Out on the street, the city hums — engines, horns, footsteps that never look up.
He lights the cigarette this time. Smoke cuts the cold. He wonders who he’ll meet today — which boss to nod at, which stranger to stand beside in line, which door to knock on until his knuckles split.

He still carries the letter in his pocket. The unsent one. The words bleed through the paper’s fold — like an old wound he keeps poking so it won’t heal pretty. an old scar that reminds him why no chain holds. He likes the reminder. It keeps him hungry. It keeps him awake.
It’s not regret that weighs him down — it’s regret that burns behind his ribs, pushing him forward when the city would rather bury him quiet.

Someone brushes past him — mumbles an apology. He almost laughs.
No apology has ever saved a man like him.

He flicks the cigarette, half-finished, into the gutter.
There’s work to find, a life to make, a regret to wear like a badge.
One more step on broken pavement — one more promise to himself, loud enough to drown the city’s roar:

My way. Always.
And the street swallows him again — a ghost in daylight, a name you won’t remember.
But he remembers.
And that’s enough.

Let’s be real for a sec.

This might run long. Might wander a bit.
But that’s okay.
Because if you’re the kind of person who feels a little too much, who thinks way too deeply during those brutally quiet 2:27 a.m. hours, who scrolls through curated perfection but secretly just wants something raw and unfiltered...then maybe this isn’t just a post.

Maybe it’s a tiny nudge from the universe.
A crack in the chaos.
A weird little sign that this might be your leap of faith.
One you didn’t know you needed, until now.

Because I don’t believe people stumble into our lives by mistake.
Some show up to test our patience.
Some derail us, turn everything upside down.
But then...
Some just feel like home in the strangest, most unexpected ways.
They arrive, and your soul exhales like it’s been holding its breath for years.
And quietly, something inside you whispers.. this, this is what I’ve been missing.


---

So hey,

I’m 26. I’m a doctor. From India.
And no, I won’t diagnose you unless you sneeze like a suspicious side quest and my reflex jumps into action.

But I’m more than a white coat and a stethoscope.
I’m a loud and proud nerd.
Not the cute, Pinterest-board kind.
The “quotes random Marvel lines in conversations” kind.
The “still mad about how Interstellar messed with time” kind.
The “loses sleep over fictional deaths and weird plot holes in sci-fi” kind.

I fall hard for characters that don’t exist.
I spiral into thoughts about time, death, memory, consciousness....... you know, the casual stuff.
Sometimes I sit with a cup of chai like I’m the main character in a noir detective story, trying to solve a case that’s equal parts medicine and existential meltdown.
Other times I vanish down a rabbit hole about marine biology, quantum reality, or nanotech in surgery because my brain whispers, dig deeper bro, we’re not done yet.

I speak English, Hindi, Urdu, and a bit of Arabic (barely enough to survive a desert trip).
Oh, and I’m learning Klingon. Because curiosity and chaos kind of run the show up here.


---

Now there’s this voice in my head.

It isn’t always kind.
It’s definitely not gentle.
But damn, it keeps me going.

It says:
Think harder.
Don’t settle.
Fix what’s broken.
Show up even when everyone else bails.

It doesn’t care about grades or gold medals or what some fancy LinkedIn profile says.
It cares about truth. About purpose.
About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world.
Why grief hijacks the brain.
How trauma gets buried in bones.
What we’re really chasing under all this noise.

I’m not wired for surface-level anything. Never was.
I need depth. I need meaning.
I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.


---

So what am I even looking for?

Let’s keep it messy and honest.
I want someone real.

Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual “hey” like they didn’t leave your head spinning.
Not someone who opens with “wyd” and ends it with “lol.”
Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations.
The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

Someone who says, “I’m not okay, can we just exist side by side today?” without feeling like a burden.
Someone who hears a lyric and feels it deep in their ribs.
Someone who smells something random and suddenly time-travels back to a memory they can’t explain.
Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes, then goes quiet thinking about souls, stars, and why love always feels like both a war and a poem.

You don’t have to be perfect.
Just be human.
Just be honest.
Just... be there.


---

But let’s get even more specific.
Right now?
I want a study buddy.

Not the “let’s do one pomodoro and ghost each other for eternity” type.
Nope. I’m talking real. Consistent.
Like, actually showing up even virtually.

You don’t have to be in medicine.
You could be studying law, architecture, psychology, space dust, or just... life.
You could be healing. That counts too.

I want someone I can sit with  virtually while we both fight our own dragons.
No pressure to talk all the time. Just be in the same digital space. Two people grinding. Growing.

Imagine it 
Midnight hustle.
Lo-fi beats or soft rain sounds in the back.
Steaming mugs of chai or coffee.
Occasional breaks where we drop either the dumbest memes or the deepest truths.

We keep each other on track.
We say, “You got this. I’m here.”
We share that random quote that hits way too hard.
We remind each other why we started.

Maybe we make it fun 
Send a quote before we begin.
End the night with a trivia game or a challenge that makes us laugh till our faces hurt.
Doesn’t matter how.
As long as we grow. Together.

And who knows?
Maybe this study session... maybe this is our shared leap of faith.
The one that keeps us grounded when the world feels too loud.


---

Outside study time though?

Let’s build a weird little friendship.

Watch movies and analyze characters like we’re their therapists
Share playlists like we’re swapping pieces of our soul
Talk about mythologies, science, dreams, multiverses
Argue over which villain actually had a point
Speak in bad Russian or British accents because life’s too short for dignity
Send random voice notes at 4 a.m. when everything feels a bit too much
Make inside jokes that no one else would ever get
Create a chaotic but cozy digital home made of late-night silences and overcaffeinated chaos


---

And just a few confessions to keep it real:

I’ve imagined being an X-Men way more than I should probably admit
Sherlock made neuroanatomy exciting for me
I’ve been broken. Really broken. But I never stopped showing up
I’ve walked alone more times than I’d like. Still do. But I haven’t stopped hoping
I don’t want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth.
I want someone who knows how to sit in silence and still be there fully.


---

So if you’re:

A little cracked but still trying your best
Empathetic but forged of inner steel
Smart but soft in the ways that matter
Funny but carrying some quiet storms
Brilliant in your own messy, imperfect chaos

Then maybe just maybe  this post is the right kind of crazy for you.

This is my leap.
No filters. No flex.
Just me. Honest. Tired. Still dreaming.

So if any part of this made your chest warm or your brain go, same,
Send a meme. A quote. A lyric. A thought. Anything.

And if nothing else?

Let’s start with a study session.
Two nerds in different corners... 
Screens glowing. Hearts open. Minds focused.

Showing up.
Holding space.
Getting stronger.

Together.

Because in the end we’re all just stories trying to make sense of ourselves.

Let’s make this one a damn good one.

Still trying.
Still here.

The “quotes random Marvel lines in conversations” kind.
The “still mad about how Interstellar messed with time” kind.
The “loses sleep over fictional deaths and weird plot holes in sci-fi” kind.

I fall hard for characters that don’t exist.
I spiral into thoughts about time, death, memory, consciousness....... you know, the casual stuff.
Sometimes I sit with a cup of chai like I’m the main character in a noir detective story, trying to solve a case that’s equal parts medicine and existential meltdown.
Other times I vanish down a rabbit hole about marine biology, quantum reality, or nanotech in surgery because my brain whispers, dig deeper bro, we’re not done yet.

I speak English, Hindi, Urdu, and a bit of Arabic (barely enough to survive a desert trip).
Oh, and I’m learning Klingon. Because curiosity and chaos kind of run the show up here.


---

Now there’s this voice in my head.

It isn’t always kind.
It’s definitely not gentle.
But damn, it keeps me going.

It says:
Think harder.
Don’t settle.
Fix what’s broken.
Show up even when everyone else bails.

It doesn’t care about grades or gold medals or what some fancy LinkedIn profile says.
It cares about truth. About purpose.
About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world.
Why grief hijacks the brain.
How trauma gets buried in bones.
What we’re really chasing under all this noise.

I’m not wired for surface-level anything. Never was.
I need depth. I need meaning.
I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.


---

So what am I even looking for?

Let’s keep it messy and honest.
I want someone real.

Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual “hey” like they didn’t leave your head spinning.
Not someone who opens with “wyd” and ends it with “lol.”
Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations.
The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

Someone who says, “I’m not okay, can we just exist side by side today?” without feeling like a burden.
Someone who hears a lyric and feels it deep in their ribs.
Someone who smells something random and suddenly time-travels back to a memory they can’t explain.
Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes, then goes quiet thinking about souls, stars, and why love always feels like both a war and a poem.

You don’t have to be perfect.
Just be human.
Just be honest.
Just... be there.


---

But let’s get even more specific.
Right now?
I want a study buddy.

Not the “let’s do one pomodoro and ghost each other for eternity” type.
Nope. I’m talking real. Consistent.
Like, actually showing up even virtually.

You don’t have to be in medicine.
You could be studying law, architecture, psychology, space dust, or just... life.
You could be healing. That counts too.

I want someone I can sit with  virtually while we both fight our own dragons.
No pressure to talk all the time. Just be in the same digital space. Two people grinding. Growing.

Imagine it 
Midnight hustle.
Lo-fi beats or soft rain sounds in the back.
Steaming mugs of chai or coffee.
Occasional breaks where we drop either the dumbest memes or the deepest truths.

We keep each other on track.
We say, “You got this. I’m here.”
We share that random quote that hits way too hard.
We remind each other why we started.

Maybe we make it fun 
Send a quote before we begin.
End the night with a trivia game or a challenge that makes us laugh till our faces hurt.
Doesn’t matter how.
As long as we grow. Together.

And who knows?
Maybe this study session... maybe this is our shared leap of faith.
The one that keeps us grounded when the world feels too loud.


---

Outside study time though?

Let’s build a weird little friendship.

Watch movies and analyze characters like we’re their therapists
Share playlists like we’re swapping pieces of our soul
Talk about mythologies, science, dreams, multiverses
Argue over which villain actually had a point
Speak in bad Russian or British accents because life’s too short for dignity
Send random voice notes at 4 a.m. when everything feels a bit too much
Make inside jokes that no one else would ever get
Create a chaotic but cozy digital home made of late-night silences and overcaffeinated chaos


---

And just a few confessions to keep it real:

I’ve imagined being an X-Men way more than I should probably admit
Sherlock made neuroanatomy exciting for me
I’ve been broken. Really broken. But I never stopped showing up
I’ve walked alone more times than I’d like. Still do. But I haven’t stopped hoping
I don’t want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth.
I want someone who knows how to sit in silence and still be there fully.


---

So if you’re:

A little cracked but still trying your best
Empathetic but forged of inner steel
Smart but soft in the ways that matter
Funny but carrying some quiet storms
Brilliant in your own messy, imperfect chaos

Then maybe just maybe  this post is the right kind of crazy for you.

This is my leap.
No filters. No flex.
Just me. Honest. Tired. Still dreaming.

So if any part of this made your chest warm or your brain go, same,
Send a meme. A quote. A lyric. A thought. Anything.

And if nothing else?

Let’s start with a study session.
Two nerds in different corners... 
Screens glowing. Hearts open. Minds focused.

Showing up.
Holding space.
Getting stronger.

Together.

Because in the end we’re all just stories trying to make sense of ourselves.

Let’s make this one a damn good one.

Still trying.
Still here.

1mggxhc,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1mggxhc/tifu_by_thinking_a_girl_was_flirting_with_me/,TIFU by thinking a girl was flirting with me — turns out she was trying to sell me insurance,"Today I f\*\*\*ed up by mistaking a very friendly insurance agent for someone who was into me.

So a few weeks ago, I was at a coffee shop just minding my own business when this girl approached me. She was super friendly, asked if she could sit at my table (it was a crowded place), and we ended up talking for a while. She was laughing at my jokes, complimented my watch, even said something like, “You have a really calm energy. It’s refreshing.”

My brain: *This is it. This is how Netflix romances begin.*

We exchanged numbers ,or rather, she took mine and said she’d love to ""catch up again soon."" The next day, she texts me: “Hey! So nice chatting yesterday 😊 Let’s connect sometime this week.”

I’m already planning what shirt I’ll wear.

We set up a “catch-up” at a quiet lounge-y place. I show up, slightly overdressed. She’s already seated with a laptop, folder, and what I now realize was *not* a flirty smile — it was a sales smile.

She starts the convo with:  
“So I don’t know if you’ve ever considered a long-term investment plan that also protects your loved ones…”

I died a little inside.

I sat there for 40 minutes while she pitched me life insurance like I was a 50-year-old family man with mortgage anxiety. The compliments? Rapport-building. The number exchange? Lead capture. The ""refreshing calm energy""? Probably code for “this guy looks too polite to leave mid-pitch.”

To make it worse, I nodded through the whole thing like I was still trying to impress her.

TL;DR: Thought I was being flirted with by a girl at a café. Turned out she was just a very charming insurance agent. I went to what I thought was a date, and got pitched life insurance instead.",120,1754220514.0,tifu,58,0.85,False

Let’s be real for a sec.

This might run long. Might wander a bit.
But that’s okay.
Because if you’re the kind of person who feels a little too much, who thinks way too deeply during those brutally quiet 2:27 a.m. hours, who scrolls through curated perfection but secretly just wants something raw and unfiltered...then maybe this isn’t just a post.

Maybe it’s a tiny nudge from the universe.
A crack in the chaos.
A weird little sign that this might be your leap of faith.
One you didn’t know you needed, until now.

Because I don’t believe people stumble into our lives by mistake.
Some show up to test our patience.
Some derail us, turn everything upside down.
But then...
Some just feel like home in the strangest, most unexpected ways.
They arrive, and your soul exhales like it’s been holding its breath for years.
And quietly, something inside you whispers.. this, this is what I’ve been missing.

My symptoms have me worried there might be something else going on. 

But how are we supposed to know the difference of what's general ibs and when to worry? 

I have swelling on my upper right abdomen that is slowly getting bigger. I've had this for 4-5 years now, I get gas pains in it, most of the time it has a general burning sensation (no pain on pushing). 
Fullness sensation in my pelvis especially on right side, in right hip that travels around to lower back. Pain in that right hip. 

I feel like a 65year old, I'm far too fatigued for 35, sometimes I'll waddle when I walk. Am often out of breath. I used to love exercising especially walks, now I'm too tired. 

I have burning in my chest, tightness. I have swallowing issues to the point I have adapted my eating to food less likely to cause me choking. 

Just over 10 years ago my employer of the time noted after I had been to the toilet for a bowel movement it smelled strongly of fish. Now my farts are clearing rooms, I've overhead people comment someone is not well. I've had people hint to me that something smells strongly of broccoli. 
I've smelled my farts and they are strong with eggy broccoli smell, I think my burps may smell this way too. 

When I was diagnosed with ibs I was having extremely sore stomach pain, I'd fill up with gas and when finally fart it would cause spasms and incredible pain. Same with a bowel movement. I thought farting was supposed to bring relief. At the time it was so bad I would writhe on the bed in pain. 

I'm definitely sensitive to lactose, I'll have a coffee with milk which causes gas immediately and in about 20 minutes diahorrea. 

Does this sound similar to your own symptoms? Would you be pushing for further investigation?

1mggiv2,https://www.reddit.com/r/TechGearReviews/comments/1mggiv2/reveal_why_the_best_renewed_laptop_hp_elitebook/,Reveal Why the Best Renewed Laptop HP EliteBook 840 G6 Stands Out,"Testing out the HP EliteBook 840 G6 has been nothing short of an interesting journey. If you're someone who's constantly on the move or simply value a compact yet powerful laptop, it’s definitely one that deserves a solid look. The name HP EliteBook 840 G6 confidently promises portability, productivity, and reliability, and after using it almost daily, I'll tell you where it soars and where it stumbles.  

**Design and Build Quality**  
This laptop's sleek, silver finish caught my attention immediately. It weighs just around 3.36 pounds, making it lightweight enough to toss into a bag without feeling like you're lugging a second job around. The 14-inch display is a sweet spot, striking a balance between not-too-large for portability and not-too-small for productivity. I appreciated the slim body with dimensions measuring 12.83 x 9.22 x 0.7 inches, which made setting it up on both cramped coffee shop tables and my cluttered home office desk convenient. The build feels sturdy, though being a refurbished Grade B unit, I noticed some very faint surface blemishes. These didn’t impact functionality, but they might be worth considering if aesthetics are crucial for you.

**Performance Under Pressure**  
There's a lot to be said about its internal specs. Running an Intel Core i5 processor at 1.60 GHz and paired with 16GB of RAM, this machine handles multitasking like a champ. I tested opening several tabs while streaming a video and running some light photo editing software, and it managed without flinching. With a 256GB SSD, startup and file transfer speeds have been consistently quick. I’d say it’s well-suited for mid-level usage, but if you're a gamer or someone who edits heavy 4K videos, this might not be the powerhouse you're after. For everyday office work, though? It’s refreshing not to hear the fan struggle for its life.

**Screen and Display**  
The 14-inch screen with 1920 x 1080 resolution offers decent visual quality. Colors appear vibrant, and text looks crisp enough for long writing or reading sessions. However, the brightness faltered a bit when working near direct light sources, making me scoot around with the laptop to avoid unnecessary glare. It’s fine for indoor use, but may feel limiting if you intend to use it outdoors often. The integrated Intel UHD Graphics 620, while basic, performed reliably for casual streaming and some light graphics tasks but wouldn’t leave a gamer thrilled.

**Usability**  
Loaded with Windows 10 Pro-64, the interface feels familiar, responsive, and professional. Setting up my workflow didn’t take long thanks to the pre-installed Windows setup and the overall intuitive operating system. The keyboard offers a comfortable typing experience for long emails and reports, and the trackpad is precise, although a tad smaller than my liking. I also tested its wireless connectivity, Wi-Fi was stable and quick, making work sessions uninterrupted. Extra USB ports (one 3.0 and two 2.0) come in handy for gadget-heavy users like me, though the absence of modern extras like USB-C might disappoint some. No optical drive is included, but with most of us moving away from discs, it's a non-issue for me.

**Highlights**  
• Lightweight and portable design, perfect for on-the-go professionals.  
• Strong multitasking capabilities with the combo of Intel Core i5 and 16GB RAM.  
• Fast boot-up times and solid state drive speed thanks to the 256GB SSD.  
• Durable and sturdy build that doesn’t compromise portability.  

**Critiques**  
• The 14-inch display lacks strong anti-glare features, slightly hindered during outdoor use.  
• Missing USB-C ports that are now becoming essential in modern laptops.  
• Being a refurbished unit, minor cosmetic flaws might bother some users.

**Product Competitors**  
Comparing it to rival products, like the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon and Dell Latitude 7400, there's a noticeable divide in certain areas. The ThinkPad X1 boasts USB-C integration and marginally better screen displays, making it a step ahead in modern port options. Meanwhile, the Dell Latitude 7400 adds extra finesse in battery life, lasting almost two hours more on moderate use. However, both competitors are significantly pricier. In terms of value, the EliteBook 840 G6 holds strong, particularly for professionals looking for decently powered refurbished options without breaking the bank.  

**True Value**  
Honestly, the price-to-feature ratio might be its biggest win. While it doesn’t flaunt bleeding-edge innovation, it’s a dependable device for midrange budgets. The internal power matches most needs for day-to-day work, and the refurbished nature (backed by Grade B performance) makes it approachable for young professionals, work-from-home warriors, and even students looking for a quality machine without the spa treatment cost-tag. High-end features sacrificed for affordability work in its favor.

Then the black tea, instantly black after the UHT milk ran dry. Then the green tea. Now it’s the herbals. All that’s left. Peppermint. Rooibos. Now, the obscure ones. The ones that try to describe a memory more than a flavour. Things like Revitalise. Rebalance. This one has rose and chrysanthemum. You give it a try.
The kettle rumbles to a boil. Steam rises. You pour with the exacting intention you always do. Just the right amount, so it brews just enough in just the right amount of time so you don’t have to wait around.
Steam billows. Tides crash, as the water hits the bottom of the cup, turning a pale golden pink. You watch the clouds form on the surface of the darkening, peach-coloured water, and rise out of the cup, into your nose.
It smells like your grandmother. Your Nai Nai. Her incense. Always burning. The sliver of silver smoke trickling up past Buddha’s smiling face. Rose, sandalwood. And she always had the kettle on. A heavy, black iron one. On the stove. It would whistle like in the olden days. She was always making tea. Drinking tea. Offering tea. She lived her life by tea. Drank who knows how many gallons a day. Did she have a system? You imagine she must have. All that tea. All those years. She must have cracked the code. The perfect way to make the perfect cup.

And your fifteen minutes is up, and you get back to work.

You have exactly 103 days, 3 hours, 27 minutes and 13 seconds left until your ship passes beyond the event horizon. Or so the computer reckons. You’ve been trapped in its gravitational pull for almost a year now. A catastrophic failure in the hyperdrive’s navigation set you on a collision course with oblivion. Now, you log the days as the black hole draws you in closer.

You find yourself thinking about Nai Nai a lot since that tea. She passed over ten years ago. Twelve? You wonder what she thought about death, the older she got. You never got to ask her that. It’s not a thing you’re supposed to ask people about, least of all the elderly. Did her faith give her comfort? Did she think she was to be reborn in the Pure Land? She was a sturdy woman. Unshakeable, in that superhuman way grandmothers are. Old as time. You can even still remember one or two chants. Namo Amituofo. Namo Amituofo. Namo Amituofo. She chants in your head, as your kettle rumbles and her kettle squeals. Your legs swing back and forth as you practice writing your characters and the days of the week and the times tables. And the water splashes into the cup. You stir, and tap the spoon on the rim. You place it down. A plate of dumplings in front of you now. The steam rises, electrifying your nostrils. Your mouth waters. The microwave bings. “Eat now, na”, she says, clearing your workbook away. You peel back the foil of your ration.

The kettle rumbles. Low. Mechanical. It sounds like Nai Nai’s chanting. It feels like your voice. In your throat. Your chest vibrates. The clouds rise, and change shape. One’s a rabbit. Another, a hat. It’s sunny. She gives you a coin to get a treat. She snatches a bite. You chase her. She runs and laughs like she hasn’t done in 70 years. You try to imagine her as a little girl. Rural China. You help mama clean the chicken. But she doesn't look like mama. She must be Nai Nai’s mama. You gather the feathers as mama plucks them. You put them in the basket to be cleaned for later use. “You’re a good worker, Mei”, mama says. Funny. That’s her name, but you never really heard anyone call her that. She was Nai Nai. To everyone. Anyone. You feel warm. Laser-focused. You have to stretch on your tippy-toes to reach the basket. The kettle clicks. Bubbling. You have tea with Nai Nai. 

You watch the event horizon swell by 0.0001 degrees.

You stop to actually look at it. All this time, it was just there. But you kept on keeping on. Logging. Recording. Waiting. So, you actually take a good look. It’s quite beautiful. Just like the deep space composites. A fiery sunset perfectly reflected on a black sea. You know what’ll happen. Theoretically, anyway—to a point. You won’t feel anything. There won’t be a you to feel it. Energy can’t be destroyed. So, something of you will still be there, if it’s even right to call it you at that point. Maybe she was right. Or Buddha, for that matter. The void. Maybe there was never a you there in the first place. Just energy arranged in this way or that. You were always trying to work it out. Understand it. Soon, it’ll be a different kind of arrangement. Or no arrangement at all. Which is a certain kind of arrangement, no?
It sure feels like you were there. It felt real, didn’t it?

Sound fades. Smell dissipates. Your mouth goes dry. Your body cools and feels weightless. Your… body? Your heart softens in your chest.

1mggdkm,https://github.com/GiuseppePuleri/NanoCron,A C++ cron at Bologna Airport,"
The most beautiful thing that can happen to a programmer is feeling that spark.
In that moment, you open your editor and start typing.
It doesn’t happen all the time: you need calm, an empty file, and a blinking cursor waiting for your input.
An input that shouldn’t be forced by company dynamics.

When you really dive into programming, you realize it’s not just code.
It’s a process where you end up insulting yourself, admitting you don’t know sh*t, and forcing your brain to work.

I found myself at Bologna airport.
For various reasons, I had to wait the whole night, sitting on a chair, resigned to insomnia.
I remembered that some time ago, for educational and project purposes, I had started writing a README.

The idea comes from the fact that Linux’s cron works well, but not exactly the way I want.

Switching between sitting and leaning on a tall bar table, I started flipping through the README where I had sketched out ideas to write a custom cron.

In that moment, I felt a bit like Maigret looking for scattered clues.
That evening, with 16 degrees, a short-sleeve T-shirt, and too much coffee, I started.

The idea is simple: give programmers more power with something simple and high-performing.

Specifically, a new cron that reads jobs from a JSON file, loads them into memory to avoid parsing from disk every time, and a CLI to manage everything.

Doubtful, I wrote a test.
JSON is heavier, but as long as it’s well-structured, parsing can be faster with some techniques and thanks to Niels Lohmann.
So I sacrifice lightness to gain structure and speed.
Another thing you can write in jobs.json are conditions.
For example: if the CPU is at 95%, suspend unnecessary programs.

As a fan of Redis and its architecture, I decided to save and read jobs from RAM.

Good idea, fast.
Performance improves significantly.
But… what a hit.
Damn you, Salvatore Sanfilippo.
Managing data in memory is much faster than reading from disk, but…
What if the system crashes?
What if the jobs.json file gets modified?

At some point, I had to get up and wash my face.
4:00 a.m.: catatonia.
I couldn’t even compile to see if it worked.

How did it end?
Did I beat the system cron?
Did I make history by writing something awesome?

In the morning, I was so tired that I couldn’t keep my eyes open on the plane.

Performance?
Not what I expected.
Yes, it parses faster, but it uses more RAM, so it’s not good for embedded systems.

I don’t like marketing, but I’d love some feedback on the architecture.

I apologize if something won’t work: writing software is not easy.

You think: what if the system crashes, what if there are bugs? Who knows.

To wrap up: ‘Nsomma, sò chi vuliti fare, faciti.

Part 2/2 of *Locusts, Dear Locusts* should be ready in the next few days.

- - - - - 


*“What am I even looking at here…”* I whispered, gaze fixed on the truck that’d just pulled up beside me. It was 3:53 in the morning. Main Street was appropriately deserted - not a single other vehicle in sight. The front of the truck wasn’t what left me slack-jawed - it what was trailing *behind* the engine.

My eyes traced the outline of a giant rectangular container made of transparent glass. It was like a shark tank, except it had a red curtain draped against the inside of the wall that was facing me. Multiple human-shaped shadows flickered behind the curtain, pacing up and down the length of the eighteen-wheeler like a group of anxiety-riddled stagehands preparing for act one of a play.

Icy sweat beaded on my forehead. I cranked the A/C to its highest setting. The stop light’s hazy red glow reflected off my windshield. My foot hovered over the gas, and I nearly ran the light when something in my peripheral vision caused me to freeze.

They had pulled back the curtain.

My breath came out in ragged gasps. Hot acid leapt up the back of my throat. Judging by what was inside, that box was no shark tank.

A shining steel table. Honeycombed overhead lights like monstrous bug-eyes. Drills. Scalpels. Monitors with video feeds, displaying the table from every conceivable angle. A flock of nurses, sporting sterile gowns and powdered gloves.

It only got worse once I saw the surgeon.

He was impossibly tall, hunching slightly forward to prevent his head from grazing the top of the hollow container. As if to further delineate his rank, his smock was leathery and skin toned; everyone else’s was white and cleanly pressed. Between the mask covering his mouth and the glare from the light affixed to his glasses, I couldn’t see his face.

He lumbered toward the table, fingers wrapped around the handles of a wheelchair.

The person in the wheelchair was unconscious. A young man with a mop of frizzy brown hair, naked and pale. His head was deadweight, rolling across his chest as the wheelchair creaked forward, inch by tortuous inch. Despite his rag-doll body, I knew he was awake. Even though I couldn’t see them, I knew there was life behind his eyes.

He just couldn’t move his body.

The truck creaked forwards. I didn’t even noticed that the light had turned green. There was no one behind me, so I put my car in park and watched them drive away. Before long, they had disappeared into the night.

A wave of relief swept down my spine, but an intrusive thought soured the respite.

*By now, they’re likely operating on him. He can feel everything. The ripping of skin. The oozing of blood. His nerves are screaming.*

*He just can’t say anything.*

*Exactly like it was for me.*

\- - - - - 

*“…I’m sorry Pete, run that by me again? What was so wrong with the truck?”* James asked, rubbing his temple like he had a migraine coming on.

I tore off a sheet from a nearby paper towel roll and reached over our kitchen island.

*“You’re dripping again, bud,”* I remarked.

James cocked his head at me, then looked at the wipe. He couldn’t feel the mucus dripping from the corner of his right eye - a side effect from the LASIK procedure that he had undergone a month prior. Undeniably, he looked better without glasses. That said, if attention from the opposite sex was the name of the game, the persistent goopy discharge that he now suffered from seemed like a bit of a monkey’s paw. One step forward, two steps back.

Recognition flashed across his face.

*“Oh! Shoot.”*

He grabbed the paper towel and blotted away the gelatinous teardrop. As he crumpled it up, I tried explaining what’d happened the night before. For the third time.

*“I’m driving home from a shift, idling at a stoplight, and this truck pulls up beside me. One of those big motherfuckers. Cargo hold the size of our apartment, monster-truck wheels - you get the idea. But the cargo hold…it’s a huge glass box. There was a curtain on the inside, like they were about to debut a mobile rendition of Hamlet. But they - the people inside of the box, I forgot to mention the people - they weren’t about to perform a play. I mean, I don’t know for sure that they weren’t, but that's beside the point. They looked like they were going to…and I know how this sounds…but they looked like they were going to perform surgery…”*

My recollection of the event crumbled. I was losing the plot.

Now, both of his eyes were leaking.

I ripped another piece off the roll and handed it to him. He was watching me, but James’s expression was vacant. The lights were on, but nobody seemed to be home. I wondered if he’d discontinued his ADHD meds or something.

After an uncomfortable pause, he realized *why* I was giving him more tissue paper.

*“Thanks. So, what was so wrong with the truck?”* he repeated.

\- - - - - 

About a week passed before I saw it again. That time, it was all happening in broad daylight.

I rounded a corner onto Main Street and parked my car in front of our local coffee shop, pining for a bolus of caffeine to prepare for another grueling night shift.

As I placed my hand over the cafe’s doorknob, I heard a familiar jingling noise from behind me. The rattling of change against the inside of a plastic cup. A pang of guilt curled around my heart like a hungry python.

I’d walked past Danny like he didn’t even exist.

I flipped around, digging through my scrub pockets for a few loose bills.

*“Sorry about that, bud. Can’t seem to find the way out of my own head today.”*

Danny smiled, revealing a mouth filled with perfect white teeth.

I’d known him for as long as I’d lived in town. Didn’t know much about him, though. I wasn’t aware of *why* he was homeless, nor was I clued in to why he never spoke. Say what you want about Danny, but it’s hard to deny that the man was a curiosity. He didn’t fit nicely into any particular archetype, I suppose. His beard was wild and unkempt, but the odd camo-colored jumpsuits he sported never smelled too bad. He was mute, but he didn’t appear to have any other severe health issues. No obvious ones, anyway. He was a man of inherent contradictions, silently loitering on the bench in front of the cafe, day in and day out. I liked him. There was something hopeful about his existence. Gave him what I had to spare when I went for coffee most days.

As I dropped the crumpled five-dollar bill into his cup, I saw it.

The truck was moving about fifteen miles an hour, but that did not seem to bother them. The surgeon didn’t struggle to keep his balance as he toiled away on his patient. The table and the tools and the crash cart didn’t shift around from the momentum.

*“Oh my God…”* I whimpered.

It was difficult to determine *exactly* what procedure they were performing. The monitors and their video feeds were pointed towards the operation, yes, but they were so zoomed in that it was nearly impossible to orient myself to what I was seeing: an incomprehensible mess of gleaming viscera, soggy, red, and pulsing.

Best guess? They were rooting around in someone’s abdomen.

Now, I’m a pretty reserved person. My ex-wife described me as *conflict-avoidant* to our marriage counselor. But the raw surprise of seeing that truck and the accompanying gore broke my normal pattern of behavior. Really lit a fire under my ass.

*“Hey! What the hell do you all think you’re doin’? There’s an elementary school a block over, for Christ’s sake!”* I shouted, jogging after the truck.

With its hazard lights flashing, the vehicle started to pull over to the side of the road. I had almost caught up to it when I heard the pounding of fast, heavy footsteps behind me.

Danny wrapped his arm around my shoulders, slowed me down, and began *speaking*. His voice was low and raspy, like his vocal cords were fighting to make a sound through thick layers of rust. He didn’t really *say* anything, either. Or, more accurately, what he said had no meaning.

*“Well..yes..and…you see that…”*

I realize now that Danny wasn’t talking to relay a message. No, he was just *pretending* to be embroiled in conversation, and he wanted me to play along. When I tried to turn my head back to the truck, he forcefully pushed my cheek with the fingers of the arm he had around my shoulder so I’d be facing him. 

I was still fuming about the gruesome display, aiming to give the perpetrators a piece of my mind, but the entire sequence of events was so disarmingly strange that my brain just ended up short-circuiting. I walked alongside him until we reached the nearest alleyway. He started turning it, so I did as well.

I caught a glimpse of the truck as we pivoted.

They were no longer operating. Instead, they were all clustered in a corner, staring intently at us, the surgeon’s skin-toned smock and gaunt body towering above the group. Slowly, it rolled past the alleyway. As soon as we were out of view, Danny dropped the act. He doubled over, hyperventilating, hand pushed into the brick wall of the adjacent building to keep him from falling over completely.

*“What the fuck is going on?”* I whispered.

The man’s breathing began to regulate, and my voice grew louder.

*“What the hell kind of surgery are they doing in there?”* I shouted. 

Danny shot up and put a finger to his lips to shush me. I acquiesced. Once it was clear that I wasn’t going to start yelling again, he pulled the five-dollar bill I’d just given him from one pocket and a cheap ballpoint pen from the other. The man rolled the bill against the brick wall and furiously scribbled a message. He then folded it neatly, placed it on his palm, and offered it to me.

Reluctantly, I took the money back.

He muttered the word “*sorry*” and then ran further into the alleyway. That time, I didn’t follow his lead. Instead, I uncrumpled the bill. In his erratic handwriting, Danny conveyed a series of fragmented warnings:

*“It looks different for everyone.”*

*“If you react, they can tell you’re uninhabited.”*

*“If they can tell you’re uninhabited, that’s when they take you.”*

*“They chose brown for their larvae - brown is the most common.”*

*“You need to leave.”*

*“You need to leave tonight.”*

The next afternoon, I discovered Danny’s usual bench concerningly unoccupied, but the truck was there. Parked right outside the cafe. I heeded his advice. Some of his advice, at least. I pretended I couldn’t see them.

That said, it was nearly impossible to just pretend they weren’t there once they began driving in circles around my neighborhood. Every night, I could faintly hear them. The whirring of drills and the truck’s grumbling engine outside my bedroom window. 

They didn’t just plant themselves right outside my front door, thankfully. They still did their rounds, their “patrol”, but it felt like they’d taken a special interest in me. Maybe I was a unique case to them. Danny’s intervention had put me in a nebulous middle ground. They weren’t *completely* confident that I could see them. They weren’t *completely* confident that I couldn’t see them, either. Thus, they increased the pressure.

Either I’d crack, or I wouldn’t. 

I came pretty close.

\- - - - -

It wasn’t just the sheer absurdity of it all that was getting to me. The stimuli felt targeted: catered to my very specific set of traumas. I suppose that probably yields the best results.

To that end, have you ever heard of a condition called *Anesthesia Awareness?*

It’s the fancy name for the concept of maintaining consciousness during a surgery. All things considered, it’s a fairly common phenomenon: one incident for every fifteen thousand operations or so. For most, it’s only a blip. A fleeting lucidity. A quick flash of awareness, and then they’re back under. For most, it’s painless.

Even without pain, it’s still pretty terrifying. Paralytics are a devilish breed of pharmacology. They induce complete and utter muscular shutdown without affecting the brain’s ability to think and perceive. Immurement within the confines of your own flesh. To me, there isn’t a purer vision of hell. That said, I’m fairly biased. Because I’m not like most.

I was awake for the entirety of appendectomy, and I felt every single thing.

Sure, they saved my life. My appendix detonated like a grenade inside my abdominal cavity.

But I mean, at what cost?

The first incision was the worst. I won’t bother describing the pain. The sensation was immeasurable. Completely off the scale.

And I couldn’t do a goddamn thing about it.

They dug around in my torso for nearly two hours. Exhuming the infected appendix and cleaning up the damage it’d already done. Cauterizing my bleeding intestines.

About half-way through, I even managed to kick my foot. Just once, and it wasn’t much. It’d taken nuclear levels of energy and willpower to manifest that tiny movement through the effects of the paralytic.

A nurse mentioned the kick to the surgeon. Want to know what he said in response?

*“Noted.”*

\- - - - - 

I’ve been hoping the truck would give up at some point and just move on. It wasn’t a great plan, but I didn’t exactly have the money to skip town and start a life somewhere else.

When I stopped by the coffee shop this afternoon, the truck was there, per my new normal. I’d considered completely altering my routine to avoid them, but if the safest thing was to pretend they weren’t there, wouldn’t that be suspicious?

I was walking out with my drink, doing my absolute damndest to act casual, but then I saw who was on the operating table today. It may not have *actually* been him, of course. It could have just been an escalation on their part. A sharper piece of stimuli in order to elicit a reaction from me finally.

To their credit, witnessing Danny being cut into did make me scream. 

When I got back to my sedan, I didn’t head to work.

I returned home to retrieve a couple of necessities; primarily, family photos and my revolver. Wanted to say goodbye to James as well.

Turns out he wasn’t expecting me home so soon.

\- - - - - 

I threw open the front door of our apartment.

It was pitch black inside. All the lights were off. The window blinds must have been pulled down as well.

My hand slinked across the wall, searching for the light switch.

I flicked it on, and there he was: propped up on the couch, head resting limply on his shoulder. There were trails of mucus across his cheeks. I followed them up to where his eyes *should* have been.

But they were gone, and there was no blood anywhere.

I heard a deep gurgling sound. I assumed it was coming from James, but his lips weren’t moving. Then, something crept over the top of the couch. Honestly, it resembled an oversized caterpillar: pale, segmented, scrunching its body as it moved, but it was as big as a sausage link. Its tail was distinctive, tapering off like a wasp’s belly until the very end, at which point it abruptly expanded and became spherical.

If you viewed the tail head-on, it bore an uncanny resemblance to an eyeball with a hazel-colored iris.

Initially, it crawled back *into* James. The bulbous tail squished and contorted within the socket. When it settled, the facade truly was convincing. It looked like his eye.

Then, James blinked.

I turned and sprinted down the hallway.

Left without grabbing a single thing.

\- - - - - 

Danny called them *“larvae*”. I suppose that’s a good fit. Maybe that’s why the ones inhabiting James didn’t rat me out. Maybe they need to mature before they’re capable of communicating with other members of their species. 

Whatever *that* entails.

I don’t know many people are already inhabited.

For those among you who aren’t, be weary of the horrific. Be cautious of things that appear out of place. It might not be what I experienced, but according to Danny, it’ll be designed to get your attention.

Somehow, they’ll know *exactly* what will pull your strings. I promise.

Your best bet? Don’t respond. Pretend it’s not there.

In fact, try to act like my body on the operating table. Conscious but paralyzed. No matter how terrible it is, no matter painful it feels, no matter how loudly your mind screams for you to intervene:

Just don’t react.",3,1754218530.0,unalloyedsainttrina,0,1.0,False
1mggd8t,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1mggd8t/my_tips_to_survive_after_a_bad_night_of_sleep/,My tips to survive after a bad night of sleep,"I'm a 44-year-old woman, had sleep troubles all my life.   
I have anxiety, OCD, and Complex PTSD, perimenopause (party!)  
This is what I do after a bad night. Your results may vary; these tips work for me and my body.

I drink a large glass of water first thing, splash my face with very cold water or soak a washcloth in cold water. I eat a good breakfast, put on music or watch something lighthearted / funny on my laptop. I avoid social media, news or doomscrolling.   
  
Something that really helps with crazy emotions is to run or do cardio. I will put a few music videos on my laptop or TV and run on the spot to them. The endorphins shake things up, wake you up and make you feel so much better. A short walk or getting outside will also help.  
  
If you don't normally take a shower in the AM, take one. It helps wake you up, slightly shake you out of bad emo state. It doesn't need to be cold water, but a little cooler water can also help wake you up.

If you drink caffeine in the AM, drink half the amount you normally would bc you might be more jittery than normal. For me, Green tea is a good balance bc it has a bit of caffeine but not as harsh as coffee. Eat well, balanced carbs, proteins, fruits and veg throughout the day. You're more prone to blood sugar crashes, so make sure you snack too.   
Nuts, cheese, avocado, peanut butter, stuff that keeps you full. I do a small snack in between breakfast and lunch. Another small snack between lunch and dinner.

If I'm super duper anxious, I will take 1 x regular strength Advil (Ibuprofen). I don't do this regularly (no more than once or twice per week) for obvious reasons.  It seems to calm me down a little bit since it reduces inflammation. This depends on your body / won't work / might not be safe for everyone.

Also, to reduce anxiety, doing short guided meditations through the app Insight Timer (free version). Has been incredibly comforting. Brings down the anxiety quite a bit. 

Get as much exercise as you can (or is possible) throughout the day. Walking definitely counts.

For me, I feel my worst in the AM. Once I get to the afternoon post-lunch, I find I feel a bit better.  
Knowing which part of the day you need to get through to feel slightly better is comforting.  
  
If you need to nap, keep it super brief - under 15 minutes.   
I have the ability to take a mini 10-15 min nap; it can help get through the day. 

In the summer, I find I'm super dehydrated, so I like drinking a bit of coconut water since it has a lot of potassium.  
  
Be kind to yourself, remind yourself you've been here before, and even though it sucks very hard, you will get through. I hope this helps people.",6,1754218507.0,insomnia,2,0.8,False

*“What am I even looking at here…”* I whispered, gaze fixed on the truck that’d just pulled up beside me. It was 3:53 in the morning. Main Street was appropriately deserted - not a single other vehicle in sight. The front of the truck wasn’t what left me slack-jawed - it what was trailing *behind* the engine.

My eyes traced the outline of a giant rectangular container made of transparent glass. It was like a shark tank, except it had a red curtain draped against the inside of the wall that was facing me. Multiple human-shaped shadows flickered behind the curtain, pacing up and down the length of the eighteen-wheeler like a group of anxiety-riddled stagehands preparing for act one of a play.

Icy sweat beaded on my forehead. I cranked the A/C to its highest setting. The stop light’s hazy red glow reflected off my windshield. My foot hovered over the gas, and I nearly ran the light when something in my peripheral vision caused me to freeze.

They had pulled back the curtain.

My breath came out in ragged gasps. Hot acid leapt up the back of my throat. Judging by what was inside, that box was no shark tank.

A shining steel table. Honeycombed overhead lights like monstrous bug-eyes. Drills. Scalpels. Monitors with video feeds, displaying the table from every conceivable angle. A flock of nurses, sporting sterile gowns and powdered gloves.

It only got worse once I saw the surgeon.

He was impossibly tall, hunching slightly forward to prevent his head from grazing the top of the hollow container. As if to further delineate his rank, his smock was leathery and skin toned; everyone else’s was white and cleanly pressed. Between the mask covering his mouth and the glare from the light affixed to his glasses, I couldn’t see his face.

He lumbered toward the table, fingers wrapped around the handles of a wheelchair.

The person in the wheelchair was unconscious. A young man with a mop of frizzy brown hair, naked and pale. His head was deadweight, rolling across his chest as the wheelchair creaked forward, inch by tortuous inch. Despite his rag-doll body, I knew he was awake. Even though I couldn’t see them, I knew there was life behind his eyes.

He just couldn’t move his body.

The truck creaked forwards. I didn’t even noticed that the light had turned green. There was no one behind me, so I put my car in park and watched them drive away. Before long, they had disappeared into the night.

A wave of relief swept down my spine, but an intrusive thought soured the respite.

*By now, they’re likely operating on him. He can feel everything. The ripping of skin. The oozing of blood. His nerves are screaming.*

*He just can’t say anything.*

*Exactly like it was for me.*

\- - - - - 

*“…I’m sorry Pete, run that by me again? What was so wrong with the truck?”* James asked, rubbing his temple like he had a migraine coming on.

I tore off a sheet from a nearby paper towel roll and reached over our kitchen island.

*“You’re dripping again, bud,”* I remarked.

James cocked his head at me, then looked at the wipe. He couldn’t feel the mucus dripping from the corner of his right eye - a side effect from the LASIK procedure that he had undergone a month prior. Undeniably, he looked better without glasses. That said, if attention from the opposite sex was the name of the game, the persistent goopy discharge that he now suffered from seemed like a bit of a monkey’s paw. One step forward, two steps back.

Recognition flashed across his face.

*“Oh! Shoot.”*

He grabbed the paper towel and blotted away the gelatinous teardrop. As he crumpled it up, I tried explaining what’d happened the night before. For the third time.

*“I’m driving home from a shift, idling at a stoplight, and this truck pulls up beside me. One of those big motherfuckers. Cargo hold the size of our apartment, monster-truck wheels - you get the idea. But the cargo hold…it’s a huge glass box. There was a curtain on the inside, like they were about to debut a mobile rendition of Hamlet. But they - the people inside of the box, I forgot to mention the people - they weren’t about to perform a play. I mean, I don’t know for sure that they weren’t, but that's beside the point. They looked like they were going to…and I know how this sounds…but they looked like they were going to perform surgery…”*

My recollection of the event crumbled. I was losing the plot.

Now, both of his eyes were leaking.

I ripped another piece off the roll and handed it to him. He was watching me, but James’s expression was vacant. The lights were on, but nobody seemed to be home. I wondered if he’d discontinued his ADHD meds or something.

After an uncomfortable pause, he realized *why* I was giving him more tissue paper.

*“Thanks. So, what was so wrong with the truck?”* he repeated.

\- - - - - 

About a week passed before I saw it again. That time, it was all happening in broad daylight.

I rounded a corner onto Main Street and parked my car in front of our local coffee shop, pining for a bolus of caffeine to prepare for another grueling night shift.

As I placed my hand over the cafe’s doorknob, I heard a familiar jingling noise from behind me. The rattling of change against the inside of a plastic cup. A pang of guilt curled around my heart like a hungry python.

I’d walked past Danny like he didn’t even exist.

I flipped around, digging through my scrub pockets for a few loose bills.

*“Sorry about that, bud. Can’t seem to find the way out of my own head today.”*

Danny smiled, revealing a mouth filled with perfect white teeth.

I’d known him for as long as I’d lived in town. Didn’t know much about him, though. I wasn’t aware of *why* he was homeless, nor was I clued in to why he never spoke. Say what you want about Danny, but it’s hard to deny that the man was a curiosity. He didn’t fit nicely into any particular archetype, I suppose. His beard was wild and unkempt, but the odd camo-colored jumpsuits he sported never smelled too bad. He was mute, but he didn’t appear to have any other severe health issues. No obvious ones, anyway. He was a man of inherent contradictions, silently loitering on the bench in front of the cafe, day in and day out. I liked him. There was something hopeful about his existence. Gave him what I had to spare when I went for coffee most days.

As I dropped the crumpled five-dollar bill into his cup, I saw it.

The truck was moving about fifteen miles an hour, but that did not seem to bother them. The surgeon didn’t struggle to keep his balance as he toiled away on his patient. The table and the tools and the crash cart didn’t shift around from the momentum.

*“Oh my God…”* I whimpered.

It was difficult to determine *exactly* what procedure they were performing. The monitors and their video feeds were pointed towards the operation, yes, but they were so zoomed in that it was nearly impossible to orient myself to what I was seeing: an incomprehensible mess of gleaming viscera, soggy, red, and pulsing.

Best guess? They were rooting around in someone’s abdomen.

Now, I’m a pretty reserved person. My ex-wife described me as *conflict-avoidant* to our marriage counselor. But the raw surprise of seeing that truck and the accompanying gore broke my normal pattern of behavior. Really lit a fire under my ass.

*“Hey! What the hell do you all think you’re doin’? There’s an elementary school a block over, for Christ’s sake!”* I shouted, jogging after the truck.

With its hazard lights flashing, the vehicle started to pull over to the side of the road. I had almost caught up to it when I heard the pounding of fast, heavy footsteps behind me.

Danny wrapped his arm around my shoulders, slowed me down, and began *speaking*. His voice was low and raspy, like his vocal cords were fighting to make a sound through thick layers of rust. He didn’t really *say* anything, either. Or, more accurately, what he said had no meaning.

*“Well..yes..and…you see that…”*

I realize now that Danny wasn’t talking to relay a message. No, he was just *pretending* to be embroiled in conversation, and he wanted me to play along. When I tried to turn my head back to the truck, he forcefully pushed my cheek with the fingers of the arm he had around my shoulder so I’d be facing him. 

I was still fuming about the gruesome display, aiming to give the perpetrators a piece of my mind, but the entire sequence of events was so disarmingly strange that my brain just ended up short-circuiting. I walked alongside him until we reached the nearest alleyway. He started turning it, so I did as well.

I caught a glimpse of the truck as we pivoted.

They were no longer operating. Instead, they were all clustered in a corner, staring intently at us, the surgeon’s skin-toned smock and gaunt body towering above the group. Slowly, it rolled past the alleyway. As soon as we were out of view, Danny dropped the act. He doubled over, hyperventilating, hand pushed into the brick wall of the adjacent building to keep him from falling over completely.

*“What the fuck is going on?”* I whispered.

The man’s breathing began to regulate, and my voice grew louder.

*“What the hell kind of surgery are they doing in there?”* I shouted. 

Danny shot up and put a finger to his lips to shush me. I acquiesced. Once it was clear that I wasn’t going to start yelling again, he pulled the five-dollar bill I’d just given him from one pocket and a cheap ballpoint pen from the other. The man rolled the bill against the brick wall and furiously scribbled a message. He then folded it neatly, placed it on his palm, and offered it to me.

Reluctantly, I took the money back.

He muttered the word “*sorry*” and then ran further into the alleyway. That time, I didn’t follow his lead. Instead, I uncrumpled the bill. In his erratic handwriting, Danny conveyed a series of fragmented warnings:

*“It looks different for everyone.”*

*“If you react, they can tell you’re uninhabited.”*

*“If they can tell you’re uninhabited, that’s when they take you.”*

*“They chose brown for their larvae - brown is the most common.”*

*“You need to leave.”*

*“You need to leave tonight.”*

His beard was wild and unkempt, but the odd camo-colored jumpsuits he sported never smelled too bad. He was mute, but he didn’t appear to have any other severe health issues. No obvious ones, anyway. He was a man of inherent contradictions, silently loitering on the bench in front of the cafe, day in and day out. I liked him. There was something hopeful about his existence. Gave him what I had to spare when I went for coffee most days.

As I dropped the crumpled five-dollar bill into his cup, I saw it.

The truck was moving about fifteen miles an hour, but that did not seem to bother them. The surgeon didn’t struggle to keep his balance as he toiled away on his patient. The table and the tools and the crash cart didn’t shift around from the momentum.

*“Oh my God…”* I whimpered.

It was difficult to determine *exactly* what procedure they were performing. The monitors and their video feeds were pointed towards the operation, yes, but they were so zoomed in that it was nearly impossible to orient myself to what I was seeing: an incomprehensible mess of gleaming viscera, soggy, red, and pulsing.

Best guess? They were rooting around in someone’s abdomen.

Now, I’m a pretty reserved person. My ex-wife described me as *conflict-avoidant* to our marriage counselor. But the raw surprise of seeing that truck and the accompanying gore broke my normal pattern of behavior. Really lit a fire under my ass.

*“Hey! What the hell do you all think you’re doin’? There’s an elementary school a block over, for Christ’s sake!”* I shouted, jogging after the truck.

With its hazard lights flashing, the vehicle started to pull over to the side of the road. I had almost caught up to it when I heard the pounding of fast, heavy footsteps behind me.

Danny wrapped his arm around my shoulders, slowed me down, and began *speaking*. His voice was low and raspy, like his vocal cords were fighting to make a sound through thick layers of rust. He didn’t really *say* anything, either. Or, more accurately, what he said had no meaning.

*“Well..yes..and…you see that…”*

I realize now that Danny wasn’t talking to relay a message. No, he was just *pretending* to be embroiled in conversation, and he wanted me to play along. When I tried to turn my head back to the truck, he forcefully pushed my cheek with the fingers of the arm he had around my shoulder so I’d be facing him. 

I was still fuming about the gruesome display, aiming to give the perpetrators a piece of my mind, but the entire sequence of events was so disarmingly strange that my brain just ended up short-circuiting. I walked alongside him until we reached the nearest alleyway. He started turning it, so I did as well.

I caught a glimpse of the truck as we pivoted.

They were no longer operating. Instead, they were all clustered in a corner, staring intently at us, the surgeon’s skin-toned smock and gaunt body towering above the group. Slowly, it rolled past the alleyway. As soon as we were out of view, Danny dropped the act. He doubled over, hyperventilating, hand pushed into the brick wall of the adjacent building to keep him from falling over completely.

*“What the fuck is going on?”* I whispered.

The man’s breathing began to regulate, and my voice grew louder.

*“What the hell kind of surgery are they doing in there?”* I shouted. 

Danny shot up and put a finger to his lips to shush me. I acquiesced. Once it was clear that I wasn’t going to start yelling again, he pulled the five-dollar bill I’d just given him from one pocket and a cheap ballpoint pen from the other. The man rolled the bill against the brick wall and furiously scribbled a message. He then folded it neatly, placed it on his palm, and offered it to me.

Reluctantly, I took the money back.

He muttered the word “*sorry*” and then ran further into the alleyway. That time, I didn’t follow his lead. Instead, I uncrumpled the bill. In his erratic handwriting, Danny conveyed a series of fragmented warnings:

*“It looks different for everyone.”*

*“If you react, they can tell you’re uninhabited.”*

*“If they can tell you’re uninhabited, that’s when they take you.”*

*“They chose brown for their larvae - brown is the most common.”*

*“You need to leave.”*

*“You need to leave tonight.”*

\- - - - - 

The next afternoon, I discovered Danny’s usual bench concerningly unoccupied, but the truck was there. Parked right outside the cafe. I heeded his advice. Some of his advice, at least. I pretended I couldn’t see them.

That said, it was nearly impossible to just pretend they weren’t there once they began driving in circles around my neighborhood. Every night, I could faintly hear them. The whirring of drills and the truck’s grumbling engine outside my bedroom window. 

They didn’t just plant themselves right outside my front door, thankfully. They still did their rounds, their “patrol”, but it felt like they’d taken a special interest in me. Maybe I was a unique case to them. Danny’s intervention had put me in a nebulous middle ground. They weren’t *completely* confident that I could see them. They weren’t *completely* confident that I couldn’t see them, either. Thus, they increased the pressure.

Either I’d crack, or I wouldn’t. 

I came pretty close.

\- - - - -

It wasn’t just the sheer absurdity of it all that was getting to me. The stimuli felt targeted: catered to my very specific set of traumas. I suppose that probably yields the best results.

To that end, have you ever heard of a condition called *Anesthesia Awareness?*

It’s the fancy name for the concept of maintaining consciousness during a surgery. All things considered, it’s a fairly common phenomenon: one incident for every fifteen thousand operations or so. For most, it’s only a blip. A fleeting lucidity. A quick flash of awareness, and then they’re back under. For most, it’s painless.

Even without pain, it’s still pretty terrifying. Paralytics are a devilish breed of pharmacology. They induce complete and utter muscular shutdown without affecting the brain’s ability to think and perceive. Immurement within the confines of your own flesh. To me, there isn’t a purer vision of hell. That said, I’m fairly biased. Because I’m not like most.

I was awake for the entirety of appendectomy, and I felt every single thing.

Sure, they saved my life. My appendix detonated like a grenade inside my abdominal cavity.

But I mean, at what cost?

The first incision was the worst. I won’t bother describing the pain. The sensation was immeasurable. Completely off the scale.

And I couldn’t do a goddamn thing about it.

They dug around in my torso for nearly two hours. Exhuming the infected appendix and cleaning up the damage it’d already done. Cauterizing my bleeding intestines.

About half-way through, I even managed to kick my foot. Just once, and it wasn’t much. It’d taken nuclear levels of energy and willpower to manifest that tiny movement through the effects of the paralytic.

A nurse mentioned the kick to the surgeon. Want to know what he said in response?

*“Noted.”*

\- - - - - 

I’ve been hoping the truck would give up at some point and just move on. It wasn’t a great plan, but I didn’t exactly have the money to skip town and start a life somewhere else.

When I stopped by the coffee shop this afternoon, the truck was there, per my new normal. I’d considered completely altering my routine to avoid them, but if the safest thing was to pretend they weren’t there, wouldn’t that be suspicious?

I was walking out with my drink, doing my absolute damndest to act casual, but then I saw who was on the operating table today. It may not have *actually* been him, of course. It could have just been an escalation on their part. A sharper piece of stimuli in order to elicit a reaction from me finally.

To their credit, witnessing Danny being cut into did make me scream. 

When I got back to my sedan, I didn’t head to work.

I returned home to retrieve a couple of necessities; primarily, family photos and my revolver. Wanted to say goodbye to James as well.

Turns out he wasn’t expecting me home so soon.

\- - - - - 

I threw open the front door of our apartment.

It was pitch black inside. All the lights were off. The window blinds must have been pulled down as well.

My hand slinked across the wall, searching for the light switch.

I flicked it on, and there he was: propped up on the couch, head resting limply on his shoulder. There were trails of mucus across his cheeks. I followed them up to where his eyes *should* have been.

But they were gone, and there was no blood anywhere.

I heard a deep gurgling sound. I assumed it was coming from James, but his lips weren’t moving. Then, something crept over the top of the couch. Honestly, it resembled an oversized caterpillar: pale, segmented, scrunching its body as it moved, but it was as big as a sausage link. Its tail was distinctive, tapering off like a wasp’s belly until the very end, at which point it abruptly expanded and became spherical.

If you viewed the tail head-on, it bore an uncanny resemblance to an eyeball with a hazel-colored iris.

Initially, it crawled back *into* James. The bulbous tail squished and contorted within the socket. When it settled, the facade truly was convincing. It looked like his eye.

Then, James blinked.

I turned and sprinted down the hallway.

Left without grabbing a single thing.

\- - - - - 

Danny called them *“larvae*”. I suppose that’s a good fit. Maybe that’s why the ones inhabiting James didn’t rat me out. Maybe they need to mature before they’re capable of communicating with other members of their species. 

Whatever *that* entails.

I don’t know many people are already inhabited.

For those among you who aren’t, be weary of the horrific. Be cautious of things that appear out of place. It might not be what I experienced, but according to Danny, it’ll be designed to get your attention.

Somehow, they’ll know *exactly* what will pull your strings. I promise.

Your best bet? Don’t respond. Pretend it’s not there.

In fact, try to act like my body on the operating table. Conscious but paralyzed. No matter how terrible it is, no matter painful it feels, no matter how loudly your mind screams for you to intervene:

I have quality coffee, a kingrinder k6, and a hario v60. I use a bodum kettle (not temperature controlled) and a very small scale that only does weight. 

My question is, between the two, would a temp control kettle or a precision scale help me make me make a more flavorful cup of coffee? Or which would you prioritize? 

I normally let the kettle go to boil and sit for a few seconds. I haven’t noticed too many issues, I’m just not as satisfied as I feel I could be with the flavor notes. I know I could buy a small kitchen thermometer, but I’d rather just invest in a kettle instead of a replaceable tool I otherwise wouldn’t use. 

With the scale, my biggest issue is balancing the carafe on the small base. It fell off the other day and spilled everywhere, but that’s only happened once out of like 20 pours. I’ve got a consistent flow rate, I think, but I’m curious if a precision scale would really help elevate the flavor profile and help for a more accurate/consistent brew. 

I’m somewhat tight on money so I’m looking to make impactful purchases to improve my pour overs without breaking the bank. Thanks for any feedback! ",0,1754218328.0,pourover,4,0.5,False

*“What am I even looking at here…”* I whispered, gaze fixed on the truck that’d just pulled up beside me. It was 3:53 in the morning. Main Street was appropriately deserted - not a single other vehicle in sight. The front of the truck wasn’t what left me slack-jawed - it what was trailing *behind* the engine.

My eyes traced the outline of a giant rectangular container made of transparent glass. It was like a shark tank, except it had a red curtain draped against the inside of the wall that was facing me. Multiple human-shaped shadows flickered behind the curtain, pacing up and down the length of the eighteen-wheeler like a group of anxiety-riddled stagehands preparing for act one of a play.

Icy sweat beaded on my forehead. I cranked the A/C to its highest setting. The stop light’s hazy red glow reflected off my windshield. My foot hovered over the gas, and I nearly ran the light when something in my peripheral vision caused me to freeze.

They had pulled back the curtain.

My breath came out in ragged gasps. Hot acid leapt up the back of my throat. Judging by what was inside, that box was no shark tank.

A shining steel table. Honeycombed overhead lights like monstrous bug-eyes. Drills. Scalpels. Monitors with video feeds, displaying the table from every conceivable angle. A flock of nurses, sporting sterile gowns and powdered gloves.

It only got worse once I saw the surgeon.

He was impossibly tall, hunching slightly forward to prevent his head from grazing the top of the hollow container. As if to further delineate his rank, his smock was leathery and skin toned; everyone else’s was white and cleanly pressed. Between the mask covering his mouth and the glare from the light affixed to his glasses, I couldn’t see his face.

He lumbered toward the table, fingers wrapped around the handles of a wheelchair.

The person in the wheelchair was unconscious. A young man with a mop of frizzy brown hair, naked and pale. His head was deadweight, rolling across his chest as the wheelchair creaked forward, inch by tortuous inch. Despite his rag-doll body, I knew he was awake. Even though I couldn’t see them, I knew there was life behind his eyes.

He just couldn’t move his body.

The truck creaked forwards. I didn’t even noticed that the light had turned green. There was no one behind me, so I put my car in park and watched them drive away. Before long, they had disappeared into the night.

A wave of relief swept down my spine, but an intrusive thought soured the respite.

*By now, they’re likely operating on him. He can feel everything. The ripping of skin. The oozing of blood. His nerves are screaming.*

*He just can’t say anything.*

*Exactly like it was for me.*

\- - - - - 

*“…I’m sorry Pete, run that by me again? What was so wrong with the truck?”* James asked, rubbing his temple like he had a migraine coming on.

I tore off a sheet from a nearby paper towel roll and reached over our kitchen island.

*“You’re dripping again, bud,”* I remarked.

James cocked his head at me, then looked at the wipe. He couldn’t feel the mucus dripping from the corner of his right eye - a side effect from the LASIK procedure that he had undergone a month prior. Undeniably, he looked better without glasses. That said, if attention from the opposite sex was the name of the game, the persistent goopy discharge that he now suffered from seemed like a bit of a monkey’s paw. One step forward, two steps back.

Recognition flashed across his face.

*“Oh! Shoot.”*

He grabbed the paper towel and blotted away the gelatinous teardrop. As he crumpled it up, I tried explaining what’d happened the night before. For the third time.

*“I’m driving home from a shift, idling at a stoplight, and this truck pulls up beside me. One of those big motherfuckers. Cargo hold the size of our apartment, monster-truck wheels - you get the idea. But the cargo hold…it’s a huge glass box. There was a curtain on the inside, like they were about to debut a mobile rendition of Hamlet. But they - the people inside of the box, I forgot to mention the people - they weren’t about to perform a play. I mean, I don’t know for sure that they weren’t, but that's beside the point. They looked like they were going to…and I know how this sounds…but they looked like they were going to perform surgery…”*

My recollection of the event crumbled. I was losing the plot.

Now, both of his eyes were leaking.

I ripped another piece off the roll and handed it to him. He was watching me, but James’s expression was vacant. The lights were on, but nobody seemed to be home. I wondered if he’d discontinued his ADHD meds or something.

After an uncomfortable pause, he realized *why* I was giving him more tissue paper.

*“Thanks. So, what was so wrong with the truck?”* he repeated.

\- - - - - 

About a week passed before I saw it again. That time, it was all happening in broad daylight.

I rounded a corner onto Main Street and parked my car in front of our local coffee shop, pining for a bolus of caffeine to prepare for another grueling night shift.

As I placed my hand over the cafe’s doorknob, I heard a familiar jingling noise from behind me. The rattling of change against the inside of a plastic cup. A pang of guilt curled around my heart like a hungry python.

I’d walked past Danny like he didn’t even exist.

I flipped around, digging through my scrub pockets for a few loose bills.

*“Sorry about that, bud. Can’t seem to find the way out of my own head today.”*

Danny smiled, revealing a mouth filled with perfect white teeth.

I’d known him for as long as I’d lived in town. Didn’t know much about him, though. I wasn’t aware of *why* he was homeless, nor was I clued in to why he never spoke. Say what you want about Danny, but it’s hard to deny that the man was a curiosity. He didn’t fit nicely into any particular archetype, I suppose.

## Key Features Analysis

The best keyboard covers offer a combination of protection, functionality, and aesthetics. Here are some key features to consider when selecting a keyboard cover for your laptop:

**Material Quality and Durability:** A high-quality keyboard cover should be made from durable and resilient materials that can withstand daily use. The most common materials are TPU (thermoplastic polyurethane) and silicone. TPU offers excellent clarity and resistance to abrasion, while silicone provides a softer, more flexible feel. The material should be non-toxic and free of harmful chemicals, ensuring safe and comfortable use.

The material's thickness also impacts its durability and typing experience. Thicker covers offer more robust protection against spills and impacts but can sometimes reduce typing accuracy. Thinner covers may provide a more natural typing feel but might not offer the same level of protection. Balancing durability and usability is essential when choosing a keyboard cover.

**Precise Fit and Compatibility:** A well-designed keyboard cover should fit your laptop's keyboard perfectly, with each key precisely molded to match the corresponding key on your device. This ensures complete coverage and prevents dust and debris from entering the gaps between the keys. Checking the manufacturer's compatibility list is crucial to ensure the cover is designed for your specific laptop model.

Covers designed for specific laptop models frequently enough feature cutouts for function keys, power buttons, and other unique keyboard elements. Generic covers might not offer this level of precision and may require trimming or modification to fit properly. A precise fit also prevents the cover from shifting or sliding during typing, which can be distracting and reduce typing accuracy.

**Openness and Visibility:** A good keyboard cover should be obvious enough not to obstruct the keyboard's backlighting. This is particularly crucial for laptops with backlit keyboards, as it allows you to continue typing comfortably in low-light environments.The transparency of the material should be maintained even after prolonged use, without yellowing or discoloration.

Some keyboard covers may feature a matte finish to reduce glare and reflections, which can improve visibility in luminous lighting conditions. others may offer a glossy finish that enhances the keyboard's aesthetic appeal. The choice depends on your personal preference and the specific lighting conditions in which you typically use your laptop.

**Typing Experience and Comfort:** The keyboard cover should not considerably alter the typing experience.It should allow you to type comfortably and accurately without adding excessive resistance or stiffness.

## Core Benefits

Using a keyboard cover offers several practical benefits that enhance your laptop ownership experience.

**Protection Against Spills and Damage:** One of the most important benefits of a keyboard cover is its ability to protect your laptop's keyboard from accidental spills. Liquids such as water, coffee, or juice can cause significant damage to the internal components of your laptop, leading to costly repairs or even complete replacement. A keyboard cover acts as a waterproof barrier, preventing liquids from reaching the delicate electronics beneath the keys.

Imagine accidentally spilling a cup of coffee on your laptop. without a keyboard cover, the liquid would seep into the keyboard, potentially damaging the circuits and rendering your laptop unusable. With a keyboard cover, the spill would be contained, allowing you to quickly wipe it away without any harm to your device.

**Prevention of Dust and Debris Accumulation:** Dust, crumbs, and other debris can accumulate between the keys of your laptop over time, causing them to stick, malfunction, or even become permanently damaged. A keyboard cover prevents these particles from entering the gaps between the keys, keeping your keyboard clean and functioning smoothly.

Consider using your laptop in a dusty habitat or eating a snack while working. Without a keyboard cover, dust and crumbs would inevitably find their way into the keyboard, leading to a buildup of grime and potential performance issues. With a keyboard cover, the keyboard remains clean and free of debris, ensuring optimal performance and longevity.

**Extended Keyboard Lifespan:** By protecting your keyboard from spills, dust, and everyday wear and tear, a keyboard cover can significantly extend its lifespan. The keys are less likely to fade, wear down, or become damaged, preserving the overall appearance and functionality of your laptop.

Think of using your laptop heavily for years without any protection. The keys would eventually start to show signs of wear, with the letters fading and the surfaces becoming smooth and worn. With a keyboard cover, the keys remain protected, maintaining their original appearance and functionality for a much longer period.

**Improved hygiene:** Keyboards can be a breeding ground for bacteria and germs,especially in shared workspaces or public areas. A keyboard cover provides a hygienic barrier, preventing direct contact between your fingers and the keyboard's surface. It can be easily cleaned and disinfected, reducing the risk of spreading germs and maintaining a healthier computing environment.

Imagine using a public laptop in a libary or sharing a laptop with multiple users. without a keyboard cover, you would be directly exposed to the germs and bacteria present on the keyboard's surface. With a keyboard cover, you can minimize direct contact and easily disinfect the surface, reducing your risk of exposure to harmful microorganisms.

1mggavp,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1mggavp/i_dont_know_what_theyll_look_like_but_theyre/,"I don't know what they'll look like, but they're coming to find you. Keep your cool. Don't react. They're searching for people who react.","
*“What am I even looking at here…”* I whispered, gaze fixed on the truck that’d just pulled up beside me. It was 3:53 in the morning. Main Street was appropriately deserted - not a single other vehicle in sight. The front of the truck wasn’t what left me slack-jawed - it what was trailing *behind* the engine.

My eyes traced the outline of a giant rectangular container made of transparent glass. It was like a shark tank, except it had a red curtain draped against the inside of the wall that was facing me. Multiple human-shaped shadows flickered behind the curtain, pacing up and down the length of the eighteen-wheeler like a group of anxiety-riddled stagehands preparing for act one of a play.

Icy sweat beaded on my forehead. I cranked the A/C to its highest setting. The stop light’s hazy red glow reflected off my windshield. My foot hovered over the gas, and I nearly ran the light when something in my peripheral vision caused me to freeze.

They had pulled back the curtain.

My breath came out in ragged gasps. Hot acid leapt up the back of my throat. Judging by what was inside, that box was no shark tank.

A shining steel table. Honeycombed overhead lights like monstrous bug-eyes. Drills. Scalpels. Monitors with video feeds, displaying the table from every conceivable angle. A flock of nurses, sporting sterile gowns and powdered gloves.

It only got worse once I saw the surgeon.

He was impossibly tall, hunching slightly forward to prevent his head from grazing the top of the hollow container. As if to further delineate his rank, his smock was leathery and skin toned; everyone else’s was white and cleanly pressed. Between the mask covering his mouth and the glare from the light affixed to his glasses, I couldn’t see his face.

He lumbered toward the table, fingers wrapped around the handles of a wheelchair.

The person in the wheelchair was unconscious. A young man with a mop of frizzy brown hair, naked and pale. His head was deadweight, rolling across his chest as the wheelchair creaked forward, inch by tortuous inch. Despite his rag-doll body, I knew he was awake. Even though I couldn’t see them, I knew there was life behind his eyes.

He just couldn’t move his body.

The truck creaked forwards. I didn’t even noticed that the light had turned green. There was no one behind me, so I put my car in park and watched them drive away. Before long, they had disappeared into the night.

A wave of relief swept down my spine, but an intrusive thought soured the respite.

*By now, they’re likely operating on him. He can feel everything. The ripping of skin. The oozing of blood. His nerves are screaming.*

*He just can’t say anything.*

*Exactly like it was for me.*

\- - - - - 

*“…I’m sorry Pete, run that by me again? What was so wrong with the truck?”* James asked, rubbing his temple like he had a migraine coming on.

I tore off a sheet from a nearby paper towel roll and reached over our kitchen island.

*“You’re dripping again, bud,”* I remarked.

James cocked his head at me, then looked at the wipe. He couldn’t feel the mucus dripping from the corner of his right eye - a side effect from the LASIK procedure that he had undergone a month prior. Undeniably, he looked better without glasses. That said, if attention from the opposite sex was the name of the game, the persistent goopy discharge that he now suffered from seemed like a bit of a monkey’s paw. One step forward, two steps back.

Recognition flashed across his face.

*“Oh! Shoot.”*

He grabbed the paper towel and blotted away the gelatinous teardrop. As he crumpled it up, I tried explaining what’d happened the night before. For the third time.

*“I’m driving home from a shift, idling at a stoplight, and this truck pulls up beside me. One of those big motherfuckers. Cargo hold the size of our apartment, monster-truck wheels - you get the idea. But the cargo hold…it’s a huge glass box. There was a curtain on the inside, like they were about to debut a mobile rendition of Hamlet. But they - the people inside of the box, I forgot to mention the people - they weren’t about to perform a play. I mean, I don’t know for sure that they weren’t, but that's beside the point. They looked like they were going to…and I know how this sounds…but they looked like they were going to perform surgery…”*

My recollection of the event crumbled. I was losing the plot.

Now, both of his eyes were leaking.

I ripped another piece off the roll and handed it to him. He was watching me, but James’s expression was vacant. The lights were on, but nobody seemed to be home. I wondered if he’d discontinued his ADHD meds or something.

After an uncomfortable pause, he realized *why* I was giving him more tissue paper.

*“Thanks. So, what was so wrong with the truck?”* he repeated.

\- - - - - 

About a week passed before I saw it again. That time, it was all happening in broad daylight.

I rounded a corner onto Main Street and parked my car in front of our local coffee shop, pining for a bolus of caffeine to prepare for another grueling night shift.

As I placed my hand over the cafe’s doorknob, I heard a familiar jingling noise from behind me. The rattling of change against the inside of a plastic cup. A pang of guilt curled around my heart like a hungry python.

I’d walked past Danny like he didn’t even exist.

I flipped around, digging through my scrub pockets for a few loose bills.

*“Sorry about that, bud. Can’t seem to find the way out of my own head today.”*

Danny smiled, revealing a mouth filled with perfect white teeth.

I’d known him for as long as I’d lived in town. Didn’t know much about him, though. I wasn’t aware of *why* he was homeless, nor was I clued in to why he never spoke. Say what you want about Danny, but it’s hard to deny that the man was a curiosity. He didn’t fit nicely into any particular archetype, I suppose. His beard was wild and unkempt, but the odd camo-colored jumpsuits he sported never smelled too bad. He was mute, but he didn’t appear to have any other severe health issues. No obvious ones, anyway. He was a man of inherent contradictions, silently loitering on the bench in front of the cafe, day in and day out. I liked him. There was something hopeful about his existence. Gave him what I had to spare when I went for coffee most days.

As I dropped the crumpled five-dollar bill into his cup, I saw it.

The truck was moving about fifteen miles an hour, but that did not seem to bother them. The surgeon didn’t struggle to keep his balance as he toiled away on his patient. The table and the tools and the crash cart didn’t shift around from the momentum.

*“Oh my God…”* I whimpered.

It was difficult to determine *exactly* what procedure they were performing. The monitors and their video feeds were pointed towards the operation, yes, but they were so zoomed in that it was nearly impossible to orient myself to what I was seeing: an incomprehensible mess of gleaming viscera, soggy, red, and pulsing.

Best guess? They were rooting around in someone’s abdomen.

Now, I’m a pretty reserved person. My ex-wife described me as *conflict-avoidant* to our marriage counselor. But the raw surprise of seeing that truck and the accompanying gore broke my normal pattern of behavior. Really lit a fire under my ass.

*“Hey! What the hell do you all think you’re doin’? There’s an elementary school a block over, for Christ’s sake!”* I shouted, jogging after the truck.

With its hazard lights flashing, the vehicle started to pull over to the side of the road. I had almost caught up to it when I heard the pounding of fast, heavy footsteps behind me.

Danny wrapped his arm around my shoulders, slowed me down, and began *speaking*. His voice was low and raspy, like his vocal cords were fighting to make a sound through thick layers of rust. He didn’t really *say* anything, either. Or, more accurately, what he said had no meaning.

*“Well..yes..and…you see that…”*

I realize now that Danny wasn’t talking to relay a message. No, he was just *pretending* to be embroiled in conversation, and he wanted me to play along. When I tried to turn my head back to the truck, he forcefully pushed my cheek with the fingers of the arm he had around my shoulder so I’d be facing him. 

I was still fuming about the gruesome display, aiming to give the perpetrators a piece of my mind, but the entire sequence of events was so disarmingly strange that my brain just ended up short-circuiting. I walked alongside him until we reached the nearest alleyway. He started turning it, so I did as well.

I caught a glimpse of the truck as we pivoted.

They were no longer operating. Instead, they were all clustered in a corner, staring intently at us, the surgeon’s skin-toned smock and gaunt body towering above the group. Slowly, it rolled past the alleyway. As soon as we were out of view, Danny dropped the act. He doubled over, hyperventilating, hand pushed into the brick wall of the adjacent building to keep him from falling over completely.

*“What the fuck is going on?”* I whispered.

The man’s breathing began to regulate, and my voice grew louder.

*“What the hell kind of surgery are they doing in there?”* I shouted. 

Danny shot up and put a finger to his lips to shush me. I acquiesced. Once it was clear that I wasn’t going to start yelling again, he pulled the five-dollar bill I’d just given him from one pocket and a cheap ballpoint pen from the other. The man rolled the bill against the brick wall and furiously scribbled a message. He then folded it neatly, placed it on his palm, and offered it to me.

Reluctantly, I took the money back.

He muttered the word “*sorry*” and then ran further into the alleyway. That time, I didn’t follow his lead. Instead, I uncrumpled the bill. In his erratic handwriting, Danny conveyed a series of fragmented warnings:

*“It looks different for everyone.”*

*“If you react, they can tell you’re uninhabited.”*

*“If they can tell you’re uninhabited, that’s when they take you.”*

*“They chose brown for their larvae - brown is the most common.”*

*“You need to leave.”*

*“You need to leave tonight.”*

\- - - - - 

The next afternoon, I discovered Danny’s usual bench concerningly unoccupied, but the truck was there. Parked right outside the cafe. I heeded his advice. Some of his advice, at least. I pretended I couldn’t see them.

That said, it was nearly impossible to just pretend they weren’t there once they began driving in circles around my neighborhood. Every night, I could faintly hear them. The whirring of drills and the truck’s grumbling engine outside my bedroom window. 

They didn’t just plant themselves right outside my front door, thankfully. They still did their rounds, their “patrol”, but it felt like they’d taken a special interest in me. Maybe I was a unique case to them. Danny’s intervention had put me in a nebulous middle ground. They weren’t *completely* confident that I could see them. They weren’t *completely* confident that I couldn’t see them, either. Thus, they increased the pressure.

Either I’d crack, or I wouldn’t. 

I came pretty close.

\- - - - -

It wasn’t just the sheer absurdity of it all that was getting to me. The stimuli felt targeted: catered to my very specific set of traumas. I suppose that probably yields the best results.

To that end, have you ever heard of a condition called *Anesthesia Awareness?*

It’s the fancy name for the concept of maintaining consciousness during a surgery. All things considered, it’s a fairly common phenomenon: one incident for every fifteen thousand operations or so. For most, it’s only a blip. A fleeting lucidity. A quick flash of awareness, and then they’re back under. For most, it’s painless.

Even without pain, it’s still pretty terrifying. Paralytics are a devilish breed of pharmacology. They induce complete and utter muscular shutdown without affecting the brain’s ability to think and perceive. Immurement within the confines of your own flesh. To me, there isn’t a purer vision of hell. That said, I’m fairly biased. Because I’m not like most.

I was awake for the entirety of appendectomy, and I felt every single thing.

Sure, they saved my life. My appendix detonated like a grenade inside my abdominal cavity.

But I mean, at what cost?

The first incision was the worst. I won’t bother describing the pain. The sensation was immeasurable. Completely off the scale.

And I couldn’t do a goddamn thing about it.

They dug around in my torso for nearly two hours. Exhuming the infected appendix and cleaning up the damage it’d already done. Cauterizing my bleeding intestines.

About half-way through, I even managed to kick my foot. Just once, and it wasn’t much. It’d taken nuclear levels of energy and willpower to manifest that tiny movement through the effects of the paralytic.

A nurse mentioned the kick to the surgeon. Want to know what he said in response?

*“Noted.”*

\- - - - - 

I’ve been hoping the truck would give up at some point and just move on. It wasn’t a great plan, but I didn’t exactly have the money to skip town and start a life somewhere else.

When I stopped by the coffee shop this afternoon, the truck was there, per my new normal. I’d considered completely altering my routine to avoid them, but if the safest thing was to pretend they weren’t there, wouldn’t that be suspicious?

I was walking out with my drink, doing my absolute damndest to act casual, but then I saw who was on the operating table today. It may not have *actually* been him, of course. It could have just been an escalation on their part. A sharper piece of stimuli in order to elicit a reaction from me finally.

To their credit, witnessing Danny being cut into did make me scream. 

When I got back to my sedan, I didn’t head to work.

I returned home to retrieve a couple of necessities; primarily, family photos and my revolver. Wanted to say goodbye to James as well.

Turns out he wasn’t expecting me home so soon.

\- - - - - 

I threw open the front door of our apartment.

It was pitch black inside. All the lights were off. The window blinds must have been pulled down as well.

My hand slinked across the wall, searching for the light switch.

I flicked it on, and there he was: propped up on the couch, head resting limply on his shoulder. There were trails of mucus across his cheeks. I followed them up to where his eyes *should* have been.

But they were gone, and there was no blood anywhere.

I heard a deep gurgling sound. I assumed it was coming from James, but his lips weren’t moving. Then, something crept over the top of the couch. Honestly, it resembled an oversized caterpillar: pale, segmented, scrunching its body as it moved, but it was as big as a sausage link. Its tail was distinctive, tapering off like a wasp’s belly until the very end, at which point it abruptly expanded and became spherical.

If you viewed the tail head-on, it bore an uncanny resemblance to an eyeball with a hazel-colored iris.

Initially, it crawled back *into* James. The bulbous tail squished and contorted within the socket. When it settled, the facade truly was convincing. It looked like his eye.

Then, James blinked.

I turned and sprinted down the hallway.

Left without grabbing a single thing.

\- - - - - 

Danny called them *“larvae*”. I suppose that’s a good fit. Maybe that’s why the ones inhabiting James didn’t rat me out. Maybe they need to mature before they’re capable of communicating with other members of their species. 

Whatever *that* entails.

I don’t know many people are already inhabited.

For those among you who aren’t, be weary of the horrific. Be cautious of things that appear out of place. It might not be what I experienced, but according to Danny, it’ll be designed to get your attention.

Somehow, they’ll know *exactly* what will pull your strings. I promise.

Your best bet? Don’t respond. Pretend it’s not there.

In fact, try to act like my body on the operating table. Conscious but paralyzed. No matter how terrible it is, no matter painful it feels, no matter how loudly your mind screams for you to intervene:

As the title says, I’m looking to connect with:
	1.	People who speak English (sorry, my German is still a work in progress)
	2.	Fellow Yorkie owners (or owners of similarly small breeds)
	3.	People who want their little ones to have safe, size-appropriate playtime and social interaction
	4.	Dog parents who’d be open to occasional meetups at dog parks, maybe grab a coffee while the pups play!

I have a playful and energetic Yorkie boy who’s very social, but he tends to get overwhelmed by larger or overly boisterous dogs (understandably). So during our park visits, we usually just walk around and have short, cautious interactions, nothing consistent.

If this sounds like something you’d be interested in, feel free to reply or message me! I totally understand that meeting strangers (and their dogs) offline can be unpredictable, we all want to make sure our pups are safe and around other well-socialized dogs.
So no pressure, just looking for like-minded people who care about their small dogs’ well-being and would enjoy building a little community.

  In a matter of seconds parents can change the course of your life.  
  
  How does a relatively smart sixteen-year-old girl get stuck in a sucky situation she can't get out of? Well, as I sit at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport on a Monday afternoon during the one hour and forty-five minute delay, I think about the past twenty-four hours of my now messed-up life.  
  
  I was sitting in my room yesterday when my biological father, Ron, called. No, you don't get it. . . Ron never calls. Well, unless it's my birthday, and that was eight months ago.  
  
  You see, after their affair in college, my mom found out she was pregnant. She comes from money, and Ron . . . well, he doesn't. Mom, with her parents pushing her along, told Ron it would be best if he didn't have a big part in our lives. Boy, were they wrong. But the worst part is he gave up without even trying.  
  
  I know he puts money into an account for me. He also comes by to take me out to dinner for my birthdays. But so what? I want a father who'll always be there for me.  
  
  He used to come around more, but I finally told him to leave me alone so my mom could find me a real dad. I didn't really mean it; I guess I was just trying to test him. He failed miserably.  
  
  Well, the guy phones this time and tells my mom he wants to take me to Israel. Israel! You know, that little country in the Middle East that causes so much controversy. You don't have to TiVo the news to know Israel is a hotbed of international hostility.  
  
  I know I'm off on a tangent, so let's get back to what happened. My mom hands me the phone without so much as an ""it's your dad"" or ""it's the guy who I had a one-night stand with, but never married"" to warn me it was him.  
  
  I still remember what he said. ""Hi, Amy. It's Ron. ""  
  
  ""Who?"" I answer.  
  
  I'm not trying to be a smartass, it just doesn't register that the guy who gave me fifty percent of my genes is actually calling me.  
  
  ""Ron . . . Ron Barak,"" he says a bit louder and slower as if I'm a complete imbecile.  
  
  I freeze and end up saying nothing. Believe it or not, sometimes saying nothing actually works in my favor. I've learned this from years of practice. It makes people nervous and, well, better them than me. I huff loudly to let him know I'm still on the line.  
  
  ""Amy?""  
  
  ""Yeah?""  
  
  ""Um, I just wanted you to know dat your grand mudder is sick,"" he says in his Israeli accent.  
  
  A faceless image of a small white-haired old lady who smells like baby powder and mildew, and whose life's goal is baking chocolate chip cookies, briefly races across my mind.  
  
  ""I didn't know I had a grandmother,"" I say, emphasizing the 'th' because Ron, like every other Israeli I've ever met, can't say the 'th'--that sound is not in their language.  
  
  My mom's mom died shortly after I was born so I was one of those kids without a grandma. A pang of sorrow and self-pity from never knowing I had a grandma and now knowing she's 'sick' makes me feel yucky. But I shove those feelings into the back of my head where they're safe.  
  
  Ron clears his throat. ""She lives in Israel and, uh, I'm going for the summer. I'd like to take you with me. ""  
  
  Israel?  
  
  ""I'm not Jewish,"" I blurt out.  
  
  A little sound, like one of pain, escapes from his mouth before he says, ""You don't have to be Jewish to go to Israel, Amy. ""  
  
  And you don't have to be a rocket scientist to know Israel is smack dab in the middle of a war zone. A war zone!  
  
  ""Thanks for the offer, but I'm going to tennis camp this summer. Tell Grandma I hope she gets over her illness. Bye,"" I say and hang up.  
  
  Wouldn't you know it, not more than four seconds go by before the phone rings again. I know it's Ron. A little ironic he's hardly called twice in a year and here he is calling twice in a matter of seconds.  
  
  My mom picks up the phone in the living room. I try to listen through my bedroom door. I can't hear much. Just mumble, mumble, mumble. After about forty long minutes she comes knocking at my door and tells me to pack for Israel.  
  
  ""You're kidding, right?""  
  
  ""Amy, you can't avoid him forever. It's not fair. ""  
  
  Not fair? I cross my arms in front of my chest. ""Excuse me, what's not fair is that you two didn't even try and live like parents. Don't talk to me about fairness. ""  
  
  I know I'm sixteen and should be over it by now, but I'm not. I never said I was perfect.  
  
  ""Life isn't simple, you'll realize that when you're older,"" she says. ""We've all made mistakes in the past, but it's time to mend them. You're going. It's already settled. ""  
  
  Panic starts to set in and I decide to take the guilt trip route.  
  
  ""I'll be killed. Unless that's what you ultimately want--""  
  
  ""Amy, stop the dramatics. He's promised me he'll keep you safe. It'll be a great experience. ""  
  
  I try for another two hours to get out of it, I really do. I should have known trying to argue with my mom would get me nothing except a sore throat.  
  
  I decide to call my best friend, Jessica. Supportive, understanding Jessica. ""Hey, Amy, what's up?"" a cheery voice answers on the other end of the line. Gotta love caller ID.  
  
  ""My parents decided to ruin my life,"" I tell her.  
  
  ""What do you mean 'parents'? Ron called?""  
  
  ""Oh, yeah, he called. And somehow he convinced my mom to cancel my summer plans so he could take me to Israel. Could you just die?""  
  
  ""Um, you don't really want to hear my opinion, Amy. Trust me. ""  
  
  My eyebrows furrow as I slowly realize Jessica, my very dearest friend in the world, isn't going to back me up one hundred and ten percent.  
  
  ""It's a war zone!"" I say it slowly so she gets the full impact.  
  
  Is that a laugh I hear on the other end of the line?  
  
  ""Are you kidding?"" Jessica says. ""Heck, my mom goes to Tel Aviv every year to go shopping. She says they have the clearest diamonds ever cut. You know the little black dress I love? She got it for me there. They have the best European styles and--""  
  
  ""I need support here, Jess, not some crap about diamonds and clothes,"" I say, cutting off her 'Israel is all that' speech. Jeez!  
  
  ""Sorry. You're right,"" she says.  
  
  ""Don't you ever watch the news?""  
  
  ""Sure, Israel has its share of problems. But my parents say a lot of what we see on TV is propaganda. Just don't hang out at bus stops or go to coffee shops. Ron will keep you safe. ""  
  
  ""Ha,"" I say.  
  
  ""Are you mad at me?"" Jess asks. ""I could lie and tell you your life is ruined beyond repair. Would that make you feel better?""  
  
  Jessica is the only person who can make fun of me and get away with it. ""You're just a laugh a minute, Jess. You know I'd never get mad at you, you're my BFF. ""  
  
  Although what does it say about our friendship when my BFF has no problems sending me into a war zone?  
  
  Less than twenty-four hours later I'm sitting in the airport waiting for our El Al Israel Airlines flight to start boarding.  
  
  Looking around, I watch a guy in a dark suit as he crouches on the floor and examines the underside of each row of benches. If he finds a bomb, will he know how to disarm it?  
  
  I glance at my biological father, the almost non-existent man in my life, who's reading the newspaper. He tried talking to me on the way to the airport. I cut him off by putting on my headphones and listening to my iPod.  
  
  As if he knows I'm staring at him, he puts his paper down and turns my way. His hair is short. It's thick and dark, just like mine. I know if he'd grow it out it would be curly, too. As hard as it is, I straighten my curly hair every morning. I hate my hair.  
  
  My mom's eyes are green, mine are blue. People say my eyes are such a bright blue they glow. I consider m  
y eyes my best feature.  
  
  Unfortunately, the main thing I inherited from Mom is a big chest. Besides changing my hair, I'd like to have smaller boobs. When I play tennis, they get in the way. Have you ever tried a two-handed backhand with mongo boobs? They seriously should have handicaps in tennis for people with big chests.  
  
  When I get older maybe I'll get a reduction. But Jessica said during a boob reduction the doctor removes your whole areola . . . you know, that pinky part in the middle of your boob, and then after they take out the excess boob they reattach the areola.  
  
  I don't think I'd like my pinky parts detached at all.  
  
  As I think about detached areolas, I realize Ron is still looking at me. Although from the expression on his face he probably thinks I'm disgusted with him. I can't possibly explain I'm thinking of what I'd actually look like with detached pinky parts.  
  
  Anyway, I'm still mad at him for bringing me on this stupid trip in the first place. Because of him, I had to drop out of tennis camp this summer. Which means I probably won't make it on the high school team when tryouts start in the fall. I totally want to make the varsity team.  
  
  To make matters worse, Mitch, my boyfriend, won't even know I'm gone. He went camping with his dad for a couple weeks on a 'cell phone free' vacation. It's still a new relationship. If we're not together the rest of the summer, he just might find someone else who will be there for him.  
  
  I don't even know why Ron wants me to go with him. He doesn't even like me. Mom probably wanted me out of the house so she could have privacy with her latest guy.  
  
  Her current boyfriend, Marc with a 'c', thinks he's the one. As if. Doesn't he realize once Mom meets someone bigger or better he's out of the picture?  
  
  ""I'm going to the bathroom,"" I say to Ron.  
  
  I really don't have to go, but I take my purse and walk down the hallway. When I get out of Ron's line of vision, I take out my trusty cell phone and keep walking. Mom got me the cell ""for emergencies only. ""  
  
  I'm definitely feeling an emergency coming on.  
  
  CHAPTER 2  
  
  Being on an airplane for twelve hours should be outlawed.  
  
  I walk farther down the hallway and dial Jessica's number.  
  
  ""Please be home,"" I pray as I stop by a window and look out at airplanes parked at their gates.  
  
  I usually don't pray; it's not in my nature. But desperate times call for desperate measures and I'm nothing if not flexible. Well, sometimes.  
  
  ""Amy?""  
  
  I feel better already hearing her voice.  
  
  ""Yeah, it's me. My flight is delayed. ""  
  
  ""Are you still freaking out?""  
  
  ""Yes. Tell me again why I shouldn't be worried?""  
  
  ""Amy, it won't be so bad. If there was anything I could do . . . ""  
  
  It's time to tell Jess of my plan. I just thought of it.  
  
  ""There is one thing . . . ""  
  
  ""What is it?""  
  
  ""Come get me at the airport. International terminal. I'll be hiding by the, uh, Air Iberia arrivals. Wait for me there. ""  
  
  ""Then what?""  
  
  ""Then I'll somehow get to go to tennis camp and . . . oh, I don't know. Ron wants me to be a perfect daughter, but he's the crappiest dad ever--""  
  
  My cell phone is being snatched out of my hand, cutting my 'crappy dad' speech short. The snatcher, of course, is none other than the crapper himself.  
  
  ""Hey, give that back!"" I say.  
  
  ""Hello? Who is dis?"" Ron barks into my phone like an army commander with a speech impediment.  
  
  I can't hear Jessica. I hope she doesn't answer him.  
  
  ""Jessica, she'll call you when she can,"" he says, then snaps the cover shut.  
  
  He didn't even give me a chance to tell her to call Mitch so he knows I'm gone for the summer.  
  
  ""Why? Why are you ruining my summer and taking me to Israel?

 He clips my phone to his back pocket.  
  
  ""Because I want you to meet your grandmudder before its too late. Thats why. ""  
  
  So this has nothing to do with Ron wanting to get to know me and spend time with me. No from now on I want to be the father I always should have been from him.  
  
  I shouldnt be disappointed, but I am.  
  
  ""Boarding now for El Al flight 001 to Tel Aviv with a connection in Newark,"" a voice with an Israeli accent blasts through the loudspeaker. ""Passengers in rows turdy-five to forty-five please have your boarding cards and passports out for the attendants. ""  
  
  ""Tell you what,"" Ron says. ""Ill give you back the phone if youll cooperate and get on that plane. Deal?""  
  
  As if I have any other option.  
  
  ""Fine,"" I say and hold out my hand. At least Ill have my little connection to sanity and independence.  
  
  He hands me the phone and I reluctantly follow him on the plane.  
  
  Ron and I are assigned to row sixty, the last row. Im kind of glad nobody will be sitting behind me so I can rest comfortably on the twelve-hour flight to Tel Aviv.  
  
  Unless, of course, a bomb is planted on the plane or terrorists hijack it and we die before we even get to the war zone. As I think about terrorists on the plane, I look over at Ron.  
  
  ""I heard there are air marshals on all El Al flights,"" I say as I shove my backpack under the seat in front of me. ""Is it true?""  
  
  I dont know if Ive ever actually started a conversation with Ron before, and he seems stunned. He looks around to see if Im asking someone else the question before he answers.  
  
  ""El Al has always had air marshals. ""  
  
  ""How many?"" Because if theres only one air marshall against five terrorists, the air marshall is toast.  
  
  ""A lot. Dont worry, El Als security is second to none. ""  
  
  ""Uh huh,"" I say, not very convinced as I look to my left at a guy with a mono-brow who looks pretty suspicious. Mr. Mono-brow smiles at me. His smile fades as I realize Ron is glaring at him.  
  
  After so many years with Ron as a birthday only figure in my life, I feel like he doesnt have any right to say hes my dad. When I was younger and he came to take me for my annual birthday outing, I worshipped the ground he walked on. He was like this superhero who granted my every wish and treated me like a ""princess for a day. ""  
  
  But by the time I realized a father should actually be there for you every day, I started resenting him. Last year I actually blew him off. I snuck out of the house, left a note Id gone out with friends, and came back after dark.  
  
  My mom isnt easy. She throws men away for sport. But from what I know of Ron, he was once a commando in the Israeli Defense Forces.  
  
  A commando whos too chickenshit to fight for marriage to a woman he impregnated isnt worth much in my book.  
  
  I wont be like my mother when Im older. I wont be like Ron, either.  
  
  Before long, we land in Newark to pick up more passengers. Ive never eaten sardines, but when people start piling in and filling each and every empty spot on the plane, the disgusting little fishes come to mind. It boggles my mind how many people pack the plane to fly to a place on the warning list for American citizens.  
  
  When we lift off, I push that little button to recline my seat because Im starting to get tired.  
  
  Only since we have the back row, I realize pretty quickly the back row doesnt recline. Okay, now this isnt funny. Its not just a short flight to Orlando. This is a whopping twelve-hour flight to a place I dont want to go to in the first place to meet a sick grandmother I didnt know existed in the first place. (Thats two first places, I know, but at this point nothing in my life that bugs me is second place . . . it all takes first place. )  
  
  As I try and force the chair to recline for the fifth time and the person in front of me reclines theirs so far back I hardly have room for my legs, this feeling in the pit of my stomach makes me want to cry. I cant help it. I hate this plane, I hate Mom for making me come on this stupid trip, and I hate Ron for just about everything else.  
  
  After a few hours I get up to go to the bathroom, this time for real. Unfortunately, at least one hundred people have already used the facilities and the floor is full of little pieces of unflushed toilet paper shreds. To top it off (in the first place) the floor is full of these little droplets. Are the droplets pee or water? My Dansko clogs are not used to being subjected to this kind of abuse.  
  
  I go back to my seat and to my astonishment Im finally able to get into a comfortable, albeit upright, sleeping position. Sleep right now would be bliss. The captain turns off all the lights and I close my eyes.  
  
  Someone yells, and Im jerked awake from dreamland. Right above me, like practically in my face, is a Hasidic  
  
  Jew. You know, one of those guys who wears a black hat and coat and has long, curly sideburns running down his face and neck. Jessica (shes Jewish) told me theyre ultra, ultra religious and try to follow all of Gods six hundred or so rules. I have enough trouble following my moms rules, let alone six hundred of Gods.  
  
  It takes me a minute to realize his eyes are closed and hes praying. But hes not praying in his seat, hes praying right over mine. Hes bobbing up and down, his eyes are shut, and his face is in total concentration. In fact, as my eyes focus in the dark, I realize all of the Hasidic Jews have congregated at the back of the plane to pray.  
  
  But it doesnt sound like prayers at all, more like some chant mixed with mumbling. They might not even be praying. But then one of the guys, I guess hes the leader, says a couple of words loudly and they all respond and keep on doing their mumbling chant. Yeah, theyre praying.  
  
  Do they all have to do it at the same time?  
  
  And what are those straps on the back of their hands and arms or the box strapped to their forehead?  
  
  Now that I watch them more intently, I admire the men for being so devoted to their religion they would pray instead of sleep. Dont get me wrong, I admire it, but I wouldnt do it.  
  
  I look over at Ron, sound asleep. Hes a good-looking man, if you like the dark, brooding kind of guy. Which I dont. My mother is pastey white and has blond hair and green eyes. She was probably in her ""opposite"" stage when she and my dad got together that fateful night.  
  
  I wonder if Ron wishes I wasnt born. If hed chosen to stay at his cousins dorm room at the University of Illinois, instead of following my mom to her sorority house seventeen years ago, then he wouldnt be stuck with a kid who resented him.  
  
  His eyes suddenly open and I sit back in my chair, pretending to watch the television screen in front of me without the headphones on my ears. I have one good thing to say about El Al Israel Airline--it has personal television screens embedded into the backs of every single seat. A miracle in its own right.  
  
  ""I think youll like it there,"" Ron says. ""Even though Ive lived in America for seventeen years, Israel will always be apart of me. ""  
  
  ""And . . . ?"" I say.  
  
  He shifts in his seat and looks at me straight on. ""And your grandmudder will want it to be a part of you, too. Dont disappoint her. ""  
  
  I blink and give him my famous sneer, the one where my top lip curls up just the right amount. ""Youve got to be kidding. Dont disappoint her 7 . I didnt know she existed before yesterday. What about her disappointing me? If you havent forgotten, she hasnt been the doting grandma. ""  
  
  Believe me, I know people who have doting grandmas. Jessicas Grandma Pearl spent four years knitting her a blanket. Four years! And shes got arthritis. I wonder what Grandma Pearl would think if she knew Jessica lost her virginity to Michael Greenberg under the blanket she spent four years knitting with her crooked fingers.  
  
  Ron sighs and turns his attention to his little personal television screen. I note hes not wearing the headphones, either.  
  
  I sit back. Theres a long silence, so long I think if I look at him Ill find him sleeping again.  
  
  ""What do I call her?"" I ask, still staring at the screen in front of me.  
  
  ""Shell like it if you call her Safta. It means grandma in  
Hebrew. ""  
  
  ""Safta,"" I say quietly to myself, trying out how the word sounds coming out of my mouth. Glancing over at the Sperm Donor, I notice hes nodding. His chin is raised and hes giving me a little smile like hes proud. Ugh!  
  
  Looking forward, I turn my personal TV to the channel showing how much longer until we land in Israel. Four hours and fifty-five minutes.  
  
  By this time the Hasidic Jews have gone back to their seats. I close my eyes again, thankfully drifting off to sleep.  
  
  Before I know it, the flight attendant says something in Hebrew. I wait until the information is repeated in English.  
  
  ""Were starting our descent into Tel Aviv, please put your seats in the upright position . . . ""  
  
  News flash--my seat has been in the upright position for the whole twelve-hour flight!  
  
  CHAPTER 3  
  
  Im not rude, Im just a teen with attitude.  
  
  The immigration officer inside Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv asks Ron (who has dual Israeli and American citizenship) who I am.  
  
  ""My daughter,"" he replies.  
  
  ""Is she registered as an Israeli citizen?"" she asks.  
  
  Is the woman joking? Me? An Israeli citizen? But when I see the serious look on the immigration officers face, I panic. Ive heard of Middle East countries where American kids are taken and arent allowed to leave. I dont want to be Israeli. I want to go home, like right now!  
  
  I turn around, heading back to the plane. Hopefully the captain will let me back on . . . Ill go in the belly of the aircraft, in someones luggage, in a damn animal carrier. Just get me out of here!  
  
  Im almost at the door. Freedom is in sight when I feel a hand on my shoulder.  
  
  ""Amy,"" Rons familiar brooding voice says from behind me.  
  
  I turn around and face him. ""They wont let me go back home, will they? Youve kidnapped me to this country that wants me to be a citizen. Oh, God. They make everyone, even girls, go into the army at eighteen, right? Ive heard that, dont try and deny it. ""  
  
  I know Im sounding like a crazy sixteen-year-old right now, my voice several octaves higher than usual. I cant help it and I keep rambling.  
  
  ""Youre going to make me stay here and be drafted into the army, arent you?""  
  
  I can just see them making me trade in my Abercrombie & Fitch for fatigues. My heart is beating fast and little droplets of sweat are running down my face. I swear theyre not tears, just droplets of sweat.  
  
  ""Ron, to be honest I doubt Im even your kid. Did you ever get a paternity test? Because I saw a picture of this one guy my mom dated in college who looks just like me. ""  
  
  Ron looks at the ceiling and lets out a breath. When he looks back at me, his brown eyes are darker than usual. His jaw is clenched tight.  
  
  ""Calm down, Amy. Youre causing a scene. ""  
  
  ""Dude,"" I say really tough, getting a grip on my voice. Now I sound like Angelina Jolie, in that movie where she kicks everyones ass that crosses her. ""I havent even started to cause a scene. ""  
  
  A soldier with a very, very large machine gun walks up to us. He has an almost shaved head and I can tell just by looking at him he has a twitchy trigger finger. Great, my life is over, Im going to be stuck in this third world country for the rest of my days . . . which are probably numbered now.  
  
  ""Mah carrah?"" the soldier says to Ron in Hebrew. It sounds either like ""Macarena?"" or ""Kill Amy?"" to me.

Please be able to hold a conversation, and by that more than just a short answer and then nothing. It’s more satisfying and enjoyable when there’s give and take, ya know?

Have a good one. For those who reach out, thanks in advance. ",1,1754217013.0,chat,2,1.0,False
