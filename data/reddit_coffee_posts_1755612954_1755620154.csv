1mumvea,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAnon/comments/1mumvea/does_it_bother_anyone_else_when_people_minimize/,Does it bother anyone else when people minimize the struggle of the working class in years past?,"A really popular sentiment online among younger people is that if you were born in the 70s or before all you had to do was graduate high school and get some bullshit job and you’d have a house, two cars, and yearly vacation across the pond while your wife was able to stay home all day. I’m not saying that there aren’t multiple facets of life that have gotten worse and harder since then, but when people parrot these talking points it feels like the underlying sentiment is that if you just tried in life everything would fall into and place from there the implication of course is that most people that were poor deserved it because it was so easy to “make it” back then. People rot their brain so much with this shit some of them actually believe the median purchasing power of an income was $100k during the Great Depression. I assume they get most of these ideas from watching old media or something which is the equivalent of someone watching friends in the year 2050 and saying “oh wow all you had to do in 2000 was work 30 hours a week at a coffee shop and you could afford 1200 square feet with one roommate in New York”. Anyway I think what bothers me the most is that when this kind of stuff is talked about is that there’s an implication that we can somehow get back to that system through voting and zoning laws or whatever bullshit. All that’s happened is the deck has been shuffled, the working class was stepped on constantly back then and the world they perceive to have existed is just a mirage of a green light.

Need A Coach To Help Me Reignite Husband's Desire For Me","**(Please do not criticize me or my husband. Please do not ask me to divorce or move on too. I need help, not discouragement)**

I am from Singapore. I am 43 years old and my husband is 42 years old. I am in desperate need of help for my marriage.

I have been with my husband since 2011, we got married in 2014.

Things were great in the 1st year of relationship and he would often initiate sexual intimacy, but I rejected him from intercourse several times after making out because I was afraid of being taken for granted (initially when we just started dating we had also agreed to keep sex for marriage, but did not manage to strictly follow that agreement). In our 2nd year, I decided to let nature take its course n forgo that agreement.

Since end of 2012, I started having OCD with anxieties. I felt less passion from him (probably because I was hoping to still be in honeymoon period), and due to OCD I started to repeatedly ask him questions like ""Do you still love me?"", ""Are you still attracted to me?"", ""If I did that or that, did it make you less attracted to me?"", ""Really? Confirmed?"" over and over again like a broken record. He tried to answer my questions patiently. But according to him (during marriage counselling) recently, he started feeling stressed, tired, and helpless then, and also he started feeling like my caregiver, not his real self. In 2013, he stopped wanting sexual or emotional intimacy with me. He started becoming more and more emotionally shutdown and avoidant throughout the years till now.

We got married in 2014, I still often asked him repeated questions for a few more years but lesser than in 2013. But sex happened less than 5 times in 2014, then only 2-3 times per year in 2015-2016, and 1-2 times per year in 2017-2018. I have to note that in end of 2015, I had a one night stand out of pain of feeling unwanted by him, and I confessed it to him, to which he broke down and cried uncontrollably (I am not sure if he has forgiven me even after I apologized and begged him for forgiveness). I also happened to collapse in very bad anxiety and depression in 2017-2018, and I was contemplating suicide once, which traumatised him badly.

I had been seeing a psychiatrist since 2013 - 2025 (I stopped recently), my condition gradually got a lot better since having a dog in 2018. But sex also stopped existing since 2018 till now. He also did not initiate any affection or intimacy with me. He was also seeing my psychiatrist for a couple of years for lack of motivation issue, and probably anxiety or depression (from his work and me).

My anxieties and OCD improved a lot - I managed to start tapering off my medicine 2-3 years ago. I had persuaded him to see a doctor for hormones check, he began injecting testosterone for a few years due to low levels. I would ask him for affection once in a while but he would just hug me back in a robotic manner. I would also ask him repeated questions for assurance once in a while, but at the same time trying to control my urge to ask. He told me recently that I was just pushing him away whenever I asked him for reassurance.

I do not have a habit of checking his hp, but I checked his WhatsApp in June this year, and discovered that he had been visiting paid sex services either alone or with his buddies (They have a group chat). They normalize such activities without respect for marriage. I felt my world crashing down, and my anxiety disorder relapsed (But I tried not to show it to him). I confronted him after that, but instead of expressing guilt or remorse or apologizing, he became even more shutdown and withdrawn and has been playing more PC games and hp scrolling (he has been doing these the past several years to escape from reality and to destress) recently. He has also stopped his testosterone injections since the confrontation. I also don't know if he still has the intention to continue visiting paid sex services.

I do not want to leave him, and I still love him a lot. After the confrontation, I asked him if he wanted to rebuild our marriage together, he said yes. I initiated going for marriage counselling and we did, but he did not seem to have any urgency or eagerness. I also have not seen any obvious improvement between us. We are going for our 4th couple counselling session this week.

Just 1-2 weeks ago, he told me he was going for a haircut at our nearby mall. I was expecting him to return home in 1-2 hours. I video-called him when it was nearly 3 hours and he told me he just walked home from the mall.

I checked his hp while he was asleep and saw that right after his haircut he had booked n Grab (Similar to Uber) ride to another location and then another Grab ride back home after around an hour from that place.

That location has massage parlours with sex services which he and his 2 buddies had visited before. He also had met up with his buddies there in the past for meal. I believe he visited paid sex services again but I do not have evidence, or maybe he was just meeting his toxic buddies for coffee. But I know for sure he lied to me.

I really need help reviving our marriage, reigniting his desire for me (emotionally and sexually), and to keep him faithful to me and stop lying to me. 

(FYI, my husband is quite avoidant and tends to shutdown easily. He does not share his feelings or emotional thoughts with me, probably because he is afraid of triggering my anxieties, I don't know for sure)

I submitted online form for Laura Doyle's coaching since a week ago but nobody got back to me. Do I have to wait a long time to get a coach?

Is there any Laura Doyle certified coach elsewhere that can provide email coaching since I am located in Singapore? My husband is home with me all day so I am not sure if I can do Zoom meetings without him overhearing me speaking with the coach.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

the grandpa is a serious looking person and i was afraid of him at first. i tried not to confront him for literally anything. and then one day, he saw me making coffee. he saw me in the kitchen and asked me what i was doing. (honestly i was making that cup of coffee as if im doing something illegal). when he realized that im making coffee, he asked if i need anything else. as i stood confused, he asked whether i need sugar or tea leaves or anything, and in case i need, he can give me that. i said its all right since i had coffee powder and all with me. he nodded and went back to his room.

the next day i went to kitchen, i noticed a carton full of sugar and another one with tea powder. ever since my stock ran out, ive been using those cartons for making tea. 

as of yesterday, the sugar and tea powder was almost over and i was thinking what's gonna happen now.  this evening when i went to wash my plates for dinner, he came and said that he had refilled the tea powder and sugar and also bought coffee powder since he noticed that i drink coffee.

im the only person here who uses the kitchen. there is literally no need for him to buy all that stuff and restock it just for me, since its not a part of the contract. according to the contract, what they are offering is accommodation and food is not their responsibility. still he did it.

a month ago, he made pickle. he came to the dining room while me and the guys were having dinner and said ""there's pickle in the jar, if u want, u can have some.""

1mumnvi,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerOnReviews/comments/1mumnvi/evaluate_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker/,Evaluate the Best Single Serve Coffee Maker Keurig Worth It,"Testing the Keurig K-Express 062151516229 for my daily coffee needs was a surprisingly delightful experience. As someone who doesn’t function properly before that first cup of coffee, I knew this coffee maker had to prove itself worthy of its promises. After using it for a week, both on rushed mornings and during leisurely afternoons, I feel I’ve gotten a good handle on its features, quirks, and overall performance.

**Sleek and Modern Design**  
A coffee machine doesn’t have to just make great coffee; it also has to look good on the countertop. The compact yet stylish design of the Keurig K-Express impressed me right away. With its clean lines and modern metallic finish, it adds a nice aesthetic touch to my kitchen. It’s slim enough to not hog precious counter space, which is a big win for someone like me who lives in a modestly sized apartment. The buttons are intuitive, and nothing feels overly complicated—a major plus for those of us who are caffeine-deprived and groggy in the mornings.  

**Brewing Varieties and Flexibility**  
This machine can brew multiple sizes: 8, 10, or 12 ounces. I tested each option, and all three delivered consistent temperatures and flavor. The 1.24L removable reservoir makes it super convenient to brew up to four cups before needing a refill. I even tried using different K-Cup pod flavors, from dark roast coffee to herbal teas, all of which worked smoothly. You can tell that Keurig wants you to enjoy some variety—not just in size but in type. For personal flair, I purchased the My K-Cup reusable coffee filter so I could use my own ground coffee, and I loved the flexibility this option provided.

**Performance and the STRONG Button**  
The performance of this coffee maker aligns with Keurig’s reputation for quality. One feature I used far more than I expected is the STRONG button. For anyone who loves bold, punchy coffee, this is your ally. The taste of my morning cup became noticeably richer and fuller when I engaged the STRONG button for darker coffee pods. Need a quick pick-me-up in the afternoon? Just press STRONG, and in under two minutes, you’re sipping your way to rejuvenation.  

[Check Keurig 062151516229 price on Amazon.](https://mgplab.com/p/b098zqlkq5/)

**Good Points**  
- The slim, modern appearance complements various kitchen styles beautifully.  
- STRONG button intensifies the flavor for those who prefer bold coffee.  
- The removable 42-ounce reservoir minimizes frequent refills.  
- Compatibility with hundreds of K-Cup pod flavors and the option to use your own ground coffee with the reusable filter.  

**Negatives**  
- While brewing is generally rapid, it does make some noise, which could disturb quieter settings, such as an office.  
- The compact design sacrifices a bit on robustness—feels lighter and less durable compared to bulkier models.  

**Competing Products**  
Comparing the Keurig K-Express to other competitors like the Nespresso Essenza Mini, I noticed several strengths and a few limitations. The Essenza Mini specializes in espresso and provides a higher-end feel with its rich crema, but it lacks the versatility of brewing multiple cup sizes and the broader flavor options available with K-Cups. Similarly, other single-serve brewers such as the Hamilton Beach Scoop avoid using pods altogether but fall short in brewing options like tea or hot chocolate. The Keurig K-Express strikes a middle ground in terms of versatility, though coffee purists may lean toward other brands for espresso or specialty drinks.

**True Value**  
Balancing its features against its price point, I’d say this coffee maker leans into the “worth every penny” category. It’s not fancy or packed with tech-heavy extras, but it offers reliable brewing options, a good range of beverage compatibility, and a space-saving design—all at a cost that doesn’t feel prohibitive. One thing worth noting: While I’ve had absolutely no issues with it during my time, I would recommend registering your unit for warranty protection, just in case.

Designing an Effective 2700 Calorie Meal Plan for Optimal Nutrition
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Creating a balanced 2700 calorie meal plan can support a variety of lifestyles, whether you're an athlete, looking to gain weight, or simply trying to meet your caloric needs. By focusing on whole foods and nutrient-dense ingredients, you can ensure you get enough calories while also receiving essential vitamins and minerals. Here’s how to design an effective meal plan that not only hits your macro goals but also keeps your meals enjoyable and diverse.

### Understanding Your Dietary Needs

Before diving into the details, it’s crucial to understand how to allocate those 2700 calories throughout the day. One effective approach is to spread them over three main meals and two snacks. Consider this distribution:

- Breakfast: 600-700 calories
- Lunch: 600-700 calories
- Dinner: 600-700 calories
- Morning Snack: 300-400 calories
- Afternoon Snack: 300-400 calories

### Essential Nutrients for Your Meal Plan

Your meal plan should be rich in macronutrients: carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Each plays a vital role in keeping your body fueled and functioning optimally.

- **Carbohydrates:** Aim for 45-65% of your daily caloric intake. Opt for whole grains, fruits, and vegetables to provide energy and fiber.
- **Proteins:** Make sure 10-35% of your calories come from protein sources, such as lean meats, fish, legumes, and dairy products. These help in muscle repair and overall health.
- **Fats:** Around 20-35% of your meal plan should include healthy fats, like avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil, which support cellular health and hormone production.

### Sample Meal Plan

Here’s a well-rounded 2700 calorie meal plan that incorporates a variety of foods:

- **Breakfast (650 calories):**
    - 3 scrambled eggs (210 calories)
    - 2 slices of whole-grain toast (160 calories)
    - 1 tablespoon of almond butter (100 calories)
    - 1 banana (110 calories)
    - Coffee with cream (70 calories)
- **Morning Snack (350 calories):**
    - Greek yogurt (200 calories)
    - Handful of mixed berries (50 calories)
    - Granola (100 calories)
- **Lunch (700 calories):**
    - Grilled chicken breast (300 calories)
    - Quinoa salad with black beans and corn (300 calories)
    - Olive oil dressing (100 calories)
- **Afternoon Snack (400 calories):**
    - 1 apple (95 calories)
    - Peanut butter (2 tablespoons, 190 calories)
    - Cheese stick (115 calories)
- **Dinner (600 calories):**
    - Salmon fillet (400 calories)
    - Steamed broccoli (50 calories)
    - Brown rice (150 calories)

### Tips for Success

To effectively maintain a 2700 calorie meal plan, consider the following:

- **Meal Prep:** Preparing meals in advance can help you stay on track. Cook and portion out meals for the week to make healthy eating convenient.
- **Stay Hydrated:** Remember to drink plenty of water throughout the day. It aids digestion and helps you feel full.
- **Adjust as Needed:** Listen to your body. If you are not gaining weight or energy, consider adjusting your calorie intake by either increasing portion sizes or adding more calorie-dense snacks.
- **Choose Variety:** Incorporate a range of foods to avoid monotony and ensure a spectrum of nutrients.

By following these guidelines, you can create a sustainable and nutritious 2700 calorie meal plan tailored to your lifestyle. Pay attention to how your body reacts and be flexible to make the necessary adjustments for optimal health. With a little planning, reaching your nutritional goals can be enjoyable and fulfilling.

The Benefits of Tailoring Your Caloric Intake to Fit Your Lifestyle
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Understanding how to tailor your caloric intake can be a game-changer for your overall health and fitness. Properly adjusting your diet to match your lifestyle allows you to maintain energy levels, enhance physical performance, and promote well-being in daily life.

Everyone has different nutrition needs based on their activity levels, body size, age, and health goals. For instance, an athlete training multiple hours a day will require more calories than someone with a sedentary job. Personalizing your caloric intake aids in achieving and maintaining a healthy weight while supporting your lifestyle choices.

One key benefit of customizing your caloric intake is weight management. When you carefully track your calories, you can create the necessary deficit or surplus to meet your goals. Here are some effective strategies to consider:

- **Track Your Intake:** Use apps or journals to monitor what you eat and how many calories you're consuming. This awareness helps you make better food choices.
- **Understand Your BMR:** Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) is the number of calories your body needs at rest. Use this as a foundation for crafting your meal plan.
- **Adjust for Activity Levels:** Increase your caloric intake on active days and reduce it when you’re less active. This helps optimize energy and support recovery.

In addition to weight management, adjusting caloric intake can lead to improved energy levels. If you're eating only for survival, you might lack the energy to tackle your daily activities. When your caloric intake aligns with your lifestyle, you’re likely to feel more energized and focused throughout the day. To keep your energy levels stable, consider these practices:

- **Choose Nutrient-Dense Foods:** Fill your meals with whole foods like fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. These foods offer more than just calories; they provide essential nutrients for energy.
- **Stay Hydrated:** Dehydration can cause fatigue. Drinking plenty of water is crucial, especially if you’re adjusting your caloric intake.
- **Don’t Skip Meals:** Skipping meals can lead to overeating later on. Eating small, balanced meals throughout the day keeps energy levels consistent.

Another significant advantage of aligning your caloric intake is improved performance, whether in sports or day-to-day activities. When your body receives the right amount of fuel, performance enhances. This means better workouts, easier recovery, and overall physical improvements. Some tips for optimizing performance include:

- **Pre-Workout Fuels:** Eating a carbohydrate-rich snack before exercising can provide a quick energy source. Don't skip this step, especially for long workouts.
- **Post-Workout Recovery:** Consuming a balanced meal with protein and carbs after workouts helps in repairing muscle and replenishing energy stores.

Furthermore, tailoring your caloric intake promotes mental clarity and mood stability. The food you eat has a profound effect on your brain health and emotional well-being. By focusing on balanced meals that match your caloric needs, you can improve cognitive function and reduce anxiety. Here’s how to support your mental health through your diet:

- **Incorporate Omega-3 Fatty Acids:** Foods like fish, walnuts, and flaxseeds have been shown to boost brain health.
- **Limit Processed Foods:** High sugar and highly processed foods can lead to mood swings and energy crashes.

When your diet is tailored to your lifestyle, you can also experience enhanced longevity and better health overall. Engaging in a balanced eating plan that aligns with your energy needs can help prevent chronic diseases, such as obesity and diabetes, and reduce the risk for cardiovascular issues. This proactive approach not just fuels your body, but also safeguards your future health.

Ultimately, understanding your dietary needs and customizing your caloric intake to fit your lifestyle is key. By focusing on proper meal planning, hydration, and nutrition-rich foods, you can significantly improve your quality of life. The path to health is not one-size-fits-all; by tailoring your intake, you're taking charge of your health journey.

### Conclusion

Creating a 2700 calorie meal plan tailored to your unique lifestyle can unlock numerous health benefits. By focusing on optimal nutrition, you ensure that every meal fuels your body effectively. Whether you're training for a competition, aiming to build muscle, or simply wanting to maintain a healthy weight, a thoughtful meal plan makes a significant difference.

When you design your meal plan, consider incorporating a variety of nutrient-dense foods. Fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats should be the foundation of your diet. This variety not only enhances the flavor and satisfaction of your meals but also supports your overall health.

Tailoring your caloric intake allows you to align your eating habits with your daily activities, energy levels, and personal goals. It places you in control of your nutrition, helping you to feel energized and perform at your best. Emphasizing meals that meet your caloric needs can also improve your mood and sustain your energy throughout the day.

Remember, the best meal plans are those you can stick to long-term. They should be enjoyable and manageable, fitting seamlessly into your routine. By being mindful and making strategic food choices, you can achieve your health goals while savoring delicious meals.

Ultimately, a well-designed 2700 calorie meal plan is more than just numbers; it’s a blueprint for a healthier lifestyle. With careful planning and consideration, you can effectively nourish your body while enjoying the process. Embrace the journey, and make your meals work for you.

1mumja1,https://i.redd.it/6rxbozu310kf1.jpeg,Heterogeneous results / fines for coarser settings.,"Hello, I just purchased the DF54 as my first ever manual grinder to step up my coffee game. I was appealed by the marketing telling me about the great allround character of this device. I own a Melitta Epour machine and try to get good filter coffee out of the combination, but without luck so far. My coffees are almost always bitter/astringent. And if they are not, they do not contain much clarity/flavor. Summary of my experience, so far: on settings < 65 it gets more and more bitter. Between 65 and 80 the bitterness reduces, but never completely goes away. But there is also not much flavor / clarity / fullnees. And then above 80 I feel like it gets more bitter, again.
Tried now for a week or so and wasted quite a bit of coffee. 

My theory is that the grinder produces relatively many fines and an uneven grind. At least that is my feeling when I look at the resulting coffee grind.

Does this match with anyones experience? Do you have any suggestions / tips? Could this be the result of alignment issues or something? 

I used high quality, fresh, medium dark, 2-6 week old beans and Brita filtered tap water and always made batches of 500ml using 30g. I will attach a photo of my grinds at 3x zoom.

1mumh7o,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mumh7o,"Amiens to Tréguier (FR) - 615km, 4 days","615km in 4 days, in autonomy (bivouac, few credit card uses: only some food and drinks, no restaurants).

""Gravel-oriented"" route: only small roads and country and forest paths.

Last summer, I also did this trip, but with a more coastal route, so I already knew some parts of it (mostly the last leg).

## Leg 1: Amiens -> Saint-Pierre-du-Bosguérard

**""First day on the saddle"" - 159km - 8h49 - 1330m ↑**

From Amiens train station, getting out of the city and then ~40km of ""Coulée verte"" greenway bikepath, a rather nice and flowy bikepath (old train line) to Crèvecœur-le-Grand.

Then, a combination of country paths, country roads and small roads.

I crossed the Seine river, sun setting down and rode to Elbœuf. I didn't found any nice/isolated bivouac spot so I had to get out of the town. 

A rather long and hard climb and 10km later, I finally found a small wood to rig my hammock. Pheeeew.

### routing problems: 

- 2 non-existent (or outdated) paths. 
- had to walk the bike 2 times: ~1km through an open field and ~1km through a unmaintained country path (full of weeds and thorns)

## Leg 2: Saint-Pierre-du-Bosguérard -> Messei

**""Deep stunning Normandy"" - 165km - 9h42 - 1370m ↑**

Gorgeous landscapes, beautiful bocage and forests, very cute small villages, and... rather steep climbs and elevation !

I didn't knew this area, and it was so beautiful.

### routing problems

Oh my. No problems until the night. 

And then 2 unnerving problems:

- the route wanted me to cross the Orne river by foot (after an hard descent in a very rocky path). I had not much water left, so I was also a quest for a cemetery.  
  Had to improvise an alternative route, that sent me to a semi-private property. Had to pass the bike and bike under a closed fence, all of this to get to the other side of the Orne river.  
  And then... I went to a hike-a-bike session through a very steep MTB path. Finally got my way to an isolated nice cemetery, with water available.
- the final part of this leg ended in an humid meadow, where the paths on the maps were not paths but canals. I was starting to be exhausted, but had to make an u-turn, to catch the Flers-Domfront greenway. Finally rigged my hammock next to the greenway, YOLO style.

## Leg 3: Messei -> Tréguier

**""Unexpected ultra night-ride"" - 291km - 15h20 - 1920m ↑**

I initially planned to go as fast as possible along the greenway (rather flat) and on the Mont-Saint-Michel bay (rather flat too).

But the greenway crossed the Domfront city (amazingly perched on a rocky ridge), and I was low on fresh food (I wanted fruits, cheese and salty things). So I climbed the diabolical ascent to the city, visited its amazing church, got my food, ate an ice cream, etc. It took me ~2 hours.

Then, I bombed through the greenway until Pontaubault (Mont-St-Michel bay area), at sunset.

Ate another meal, washed my legs and the bike a bit (all full of the very fine dust of the greenways and paths).
I crossed the path of Laurent, a 70-years-old bikepacker and discussed bikepacking philosophy, nutrition, anecdotes and he gave me tricks and tips on the upcoming route. 
His 100€ bike and his DIY gear made me feel humble, and a bit ridiculous with all my modern gear and bike.

Night was mild, legs were good, food restored my energy and I had a tailwind... 

...so I made the rather extreme (?) decision to push through the night and the next day until the final destination.

I took off at 22pm and literally flew the Mont-St-Michel bay part, powered by hard techno music. 

The second part of the night (1am to 7am) was an interesting experiment in uncommon mental states: mystical, hilarious, delirious, exhausted, in repeating cycle. 
I told puns, jokes, delirious dialogues with myself and profanities along the road. I'm not sure the wildlife has seen such a weird human...

The dawn was a rather mystical experience, and few times I cried, overwhelmed by the beauty of the scenery.

Legs were still good, and I rode until Langueux (just before Saint-Brieuc) to get an hot chocolate & coffee. The café was full of teams of vocal road cyclists, all in assorted kit and nice bikes – drinking their post-ride beers. The contrast with my dirty bike and look was a bit funny. 

Legs and body were still good until I reached the Trégor area... then it was hell ! 

Most of the elevation was concentrated in this area, with countless break-legs short and hard climbs. The lack of sleep killed a bit my appetite, my butt was hurting a lot. I really should have made one or two power naps and eat more, instead of trying to push like a dumbman.

I finally arrived at the port of Tréguier at 4:30pm, and crumbled down on a picnic table and slept ~1h. Then, with more energy, I rode the last 5km to the final destination (small village near Tréguier). 

**I FUCKING DID IT !**

610km in 4 days, and almost 300km in 28h. 

I'm so proud of myself and grateful of the experiences!

*Every* **Wednesday**: [The best latin dance night in Colorado](https://ville.social/event/LGz3zmOQ5VVUBnBS)

First turn of Conspiro. The rules are simple if you missed the sign up period. You have 5 points to spend as you like each turn. Whether that is the economy, political reforms, military tech or something else. If you write something like 3 economy and 2 military you are giving me permission to develop your country as it did historically but it might be accelerated. 

Realistic tech and political developments. If you are playing Romania no you can’t have a tank equivalent to a T-72 the next turn. Eventually after enough investment (I’ll try to give a reasonable timetable as time passses) you’ll get the advanced tech.

If you require information about your countries population, economy and stability I encourage you to do your own research but if you can text me and I can provide some information.

Diplomacy is free! I strongly encourage you to join the discord if you can.

Private moves are allowed but due to the media, incompetent people in your governments and gossiping family members information can be leaked to the public so be wary.

Due to a popular vote Nukes are not going to be allowed.

Major Events in 1930
Discovery of Pluto
First ever World Cup in Uruguay (The first debate will be where it will be held in this game)
The Great Depression is active and no country has emerged unscathed. 
Civil Disobedience in India led by Gandhi (Britain you’re colonial income is reduced because of this) 
Major coups in Argentina and Brazil by the military. Supply chains around the world, especially regarding coffee and other goods, are increasing in price.

 The ride was 1700km total long ride goes in 2 day and nights on the second night I was pretty sleepy having slept in my car for around 5 hours running on coffee I was in Gobi desert really hot it was clear in the day I saw small white truck front and back bumper damaged probably crashed in the grass the wheel was in repair, there was a tent and a person sitting on a chair beside the car I thought he was pretty unlucky I got to hovd had a good time.

After 6 days i was going back to Ulaanbaatar still in Gobi desert I was curious about the crashed car after a while I got to it the car was still there broken the tent was still there I though 6 days here living in tent with above 30 Celsius strange, I parked my car outside the road went to the tent maybe someone sleeping in here probably help him maybe give him some water as I got to the small tent I called out no one answered I opened the zipper clothes scattered everywhere a power bank charger empty water bottles.

I wondered where the person was but I brushed it off maybe just got into a busy car with lot of people and got to the city i was kinda sleepy didn't think much of it I went to the city about 3 weeks pass like normal I ask my relative in hovd about his kid and talked a bit he suddenly brought up a topic that a person died of hotness in the path of Gobi desert his small white truck was broken trying to find water died because of drinking no water it hit me I hung up saying no no I went on internet searching up if a person died  nothing no news no anything I asked my relative about the guy looks like he was a person from hovd not from ulaanbaatar he didn't have kids or wife, old man with no family he was brought back to hovd and buried there.

1mum69k,https://v.redd.it/562ep1thyzjf1,Need help with large entry space.,"Moving into a new place soon and it's lovely in every way but I can't seem to figure out what to do with this large entrance, when I imagine a sectional, large rug, and coffee table facing the fireplace, with a TV likely mounted on top of the fireplace. 

This feels like dead space when you walk in, no? I can put a large bookcase against the left wall but this still feels like a big gap before you get to the living area around the fireplace? Maybe I put another rug (a runner) here? Any ideas? I don't want the space to feel so uneven. The dining area was going to go in that long, vertical space facing all the windows (that lead to a deck, so viewing is nice) but I also can make that a Carolina / Florida room instead. So I can instead put the dining room in this wide entry space? Behind the couch, essentially? It’s a vertical glass dining table that will disappear into a nice rug below it (separate from the sectional / fireplace zone rug). 

Any ideas??

Then threw up. I called every other store in our area to try and find key holder coverage as I was key holder from 4:30a-12:30p and I cannot work food service after throwing up and with a low grade fever (assumed and verified when I got home, we don’t have a thermometer at work). Unfortunately for managers I do take food safety seriously. 
Couldn’t find any coverage, had tried calling SM and ASM previous to finding coverage to inform them (also texted), then began calling after looking because I needed to leave and my baristas needed someone to be key holder, actually be of use on the floor, and not get themselves sick. 
I understand being agitated at repeated calls, but I couldn’t stay and I have always understood managers have to cover if no one else can be found, so yeah I call repeatedly to wake someone up (especially since SM has said before she’s often up at these hours). ASM only found coverage thanks to a favor she was owed, still ended up sitting at the store until 7-7:30. 

The next day I hadn’t thrown up and was able to reduce my fever so I came in, and was given a verbal coaching on “excessive communication” because if they weren’t answering “you can assume we can’t cover for you” and also was told by ASM “you should’ve called every store and been serious, tell them you HAVE to have someone” (like i could force someone to abandon their own store???) and that she “shouldn’t be finding coverage for you unless you are literally like on your death-bed”. 

I found this conversation honestly antagonistic especially the death-bed comment, and I’m confused about the policy here. I have been told since I started in 2017 that apart of the SM and ASM duties is being coverage when no one can be found. I have also understood that you are responsible for finding coverage BUT when you are sick and unable to work (in accordance with food safety) that duty does fall to the managers. 

I left the convo as they kept repeating “only communicate like that in an emergency” and basically brushed over my comments about how I felt it was an emergency that their shift supervisor is throwing up in the store. 

Can someone help me identify the correct policy so that I can understand this better or present it to them as I understood the rules to be? Again, I do recognize the annoyance of multiple calls attempting to wake you up at 5am, but I cannot serve coffee and food when I am throwing up!!!! ",1,1755618281.0,starbucks,4,1.0,False

1mum1s2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AfterOpening/comments/1mum1s2/reveal_if_valueguard_trash_bags_hold_up_to/,Reveal if ValueGuard Trash Bags Hold Up to Kitchen Chaos,"Testing out the ValueGuard 110 Count trash bags over the last few weeks has been an enlightening experience. At first glance, I didn’t think there’d be much to say about garbage bags, but these turned out to be a small surprise in my daily routine. They’re advertised as 13-gallon, scent-free, post-consumer recycled bags, which checks the boxes for environmentally-conscious shoppers like myself. I’ll admit, I’ve never spent this much time thinking about my trash bags until I started using these.

**Design and Usability**  
The first thing I noticed was how neatly the trash bags are packed in the dispenser box. It’s genuinely convenient. You pull one out at a time, so there’s no frustrating cling or ripping when you’re in a rush. The bags themselves are a pleasant green color, which gives them a distinctive touch compared to the usual black or white ones. At 25 inches wide and 28 inches tall, they fit my standard 13-gallon kitchen trash can with ease, and there’s just enough overhang for a snug fit without it looking messy.

**Strengths**  
- Convenient dispenser box eliminates hassle when pulling out a single bag.
- The drawstring closure is strong and reliable for tying up bags securely.
- Sturdy construction handles both wet and heavy waste without punctures or leaks.
- Made with eco-friendly recycled plastics, giving peace of mind for sustainability advocates.  
[Check ValueGuard 110 Count price on Amazon.](https://go.senaar.com/p/b0crz3g5sw/)

**Performance Under Pressure**  
One of my main concerns with trash bags has always been durability. When I stuffed one of these bags full of food waste, including wet coffee grounds and heavier leftover scraps, I was bracing myself for that dreaded moment of leakage. Thankfully, it never happened. The 0.6-mil thickness really does its job. I’ve even used them to clean out our storage closet, where they held large, oddly-shaped items without tearing. 

**Environmental Efforts**  
A significant selling point here is the use of 100% post-consumer recycled materials. Knowing that these bags meet global recycled standards sets them apart from competitors. It’s reassuring to make a purchase that aligns with my ongoing goal of reducing my carbon footprint. ValueGuard is clearly trying to combine functionality with environmental responsibility, which is a win in my books.

**Key Benefits**  
- Helps reduce environmental impact by using fully recycled materials.
- Reinforces focus on eco-friendly choices without sacrificing quality.
- Appeals to those who prioritize sustainable household products.

**Challenges in Certain Scenarios**  
Not everything is perfect, though. These bags work wonderfully for kitchen waste, but when I tried using them outside for sharper yard debris, they struggled. I could see some minor puncturing if you’re attempting to throw in pointy sticks or heavy, jagged items. It's not necessarily a dealbreaker, but it’s something worth noting.

**Caveats**  
- Not ideal for outdoor or yard tasks involving sharp objects.
- Slightly thinner than some heavy-duty alternatives on the market.
- These are unscented, which might be a drawback for those wanting odor-masking options.

**Market Rivals**  
Compared to some other brands I’ve tried, like Glad and Hefty, these bags hold up quite well. The traditional big names often have thicker options or scented variations, but they usually don’t prioritize environmental consciousness. On the other hand, bargain bags from dollar stores can lack the durability that ValueGuard offers. Where these trash bags excel is in being an eco-friendly alternative that doesn’t compromise significantly on strength or usability. However, for specific tasks, like yard work or heavy-duty cleaning, the competitors’ premium lines might outperform.

**Worth Every Penny**  
In terms of overall value, I’d say these garbage bags deliver a solid bang for the buck. They’re sturdy, functional, and come with a conscience. The added peace of mind that I’m using a product made from recycled materials feels worth the investment. If you’re someone who mainly needs a reliable kitchen trash solution rather than an all-purpose bag, this is a great choice.

I have constantly run into one major roadblock during sales negotiations. Most people that are buying a PC on marketplace have little to zero understanding about what makes a pc good/bad or fast/slow. To solve this problem, I used an analogy I read years ago on reddit and fleshed it out to explain what each one of the components in an x86 system does and how they work together. 

I was hoping to get some feedback from the community on this description to see if there is anything you would change or think is broken down poorly. Thanks in advance guys :)

**Ai Disclaimer**, This is all my original thoughts and 90% was typed by me. I used Chatgpt to help format it and also check for grammar issues. It may flag as AI spew, but I can confirm this was almost completely written by yours truly. 

  
I like to use this analogy for explaining how a PC works.

Imagine you're sitting at a table with some other people, reading documents and writing down information.

Each one of the ""people"" is a CPU core. Each one is capable of reading and writing some info at the same time. But there's one guy who has the dictionary. He’s the single core that's working the hardest. Most games use both multicore and single-core performance to run, but single-core speed is usually the most important for keeping things fast and responsive.

RAM is best explained like the amount of table space you have to lay your documents on. More RAM means more things you can quickly pick up and read at any time. But sometimes you run out of room on the desk and need to file some stuff away. That’s where storage comes in.

Fast SSD storage is like having a file organizer right on your desk. You can quickly find what you're looking for and grab it. An HDD, or hard drive, is like a filing cabinet in the corner of the room. You can store a lot, but it takes longer to walk over there and dig through it.

The GPU is like an artist sitting at the table whose only job is to draw pictures based on what the CPU tells them. When you’re playing games or working with visuals, this person takes a huge load off the CPU and is way faster at turning data into images on your screen.

The motherboard is like the table frame and all the chairs. It’s what holds everything together and decides how many people or parts can sit at the table, how they connect, and how fast they can talk to each other. It doesn’t really give you more table space, but it controls how much you’re allowed to set up and what kind of upgrades you can use.

The power supply is like the electrical system in the room. It sends power to everyone at the table. If it's not strong enough or starts acting up, people start slowing down or falling asleep.

And finally, cooling is like the air conditioning or maybe coffee, depending on how you want to picture it. That guy with the dictionary is sweating from all the work he’s doing, so you’ve gotta keep the air flowing or hand him an iced drink to keep him going.",0,1755617997.0,buildapc,3,0.4,False

I am so sad we had to end it again, this time for good. I came back just to write this. I wish we could’ve make it work. Just never meant to work out was it? You distanced yourself, forever doubt you ever loved me at all. Maybe it’s the gap. You’re in a different stage of life. 


I loved you so much. Maybe I still do. Not gonna move on easily with this one. I miss the days you were mine. Visualizing perfect connection. God how I wish it worked out. I’m in so much pain and having no room to work it out with someone else, there’s someone trying to get to me for a while and I can’t find it in me to love again. What’s the point, they all leave in the end, fate didn’t work. It won’t ever work for me.


Constantly wondering, does he want me or not. Mixed signals hurting me every time. I am so fucked up I know, a downer to all your progress. You don’t need me. My heart yearns for something like this again but it won’t ever be you. You made it so hard to even be friends, pushing me away when I wanted you most. I just wanted us to be together somehow. Even in friendship if that’s all I was gonna get.


I wish I could hate you, god I wish I could hate you. I almost did, yesterday. But I can’t. I wish I could. You don’t deserve to be hated for being yourself. I had so many feelings, trying so hard every single day to get to you. I reached out everyday, no day I didn’t go wondering if you had eaten, drinking coffee or water. Happy for your new job and new life. You’ve hurt me so bad.


I just really wish you had loved me back the way I loved you. I don’t even understand why I did. You barely made an effort. If anything, it was a clear message you lost interest. Why did you keep me around so long like that? Did you miss the attention? 


I wished and wished for that one wish I never knew I had. You don’t know what you want, or what you need. It must be hard to live like that. I can almost feel bad for you. But I don’t this time. Because maybe this is the reason why. Sabotaging things that are good for you. I get it. You didn’t want to ruin things for my life. But that’s just it. You could never. 


Shared so many creative things thinking of you. Felt like I never got anything back. All I got was monotone one sentence one word. Meh, maybe it’s just it is what it is. Finding someone like you, having you was something I never experienced before. I was intoxicated. Just knowing you gave me a little tiny bit of affection, that little trail of affection. Even if neutral I felt the weight of some words.


Someday you’ll find someone that fits you right, finally. It was just never going to be me, right? Just never. What would’ve all become anyways? Just passing time with no true hope of it working out. Maybe that’s what you’re scared of. Always so scared of things that make you happy.


Now that you’ll seek help, from someone who knows how to navigate this with you… I’m glad and proud of you for it. Please find out why you’re scared of love. Even if you deserve it, you run away from it. Wow this is the longest letter I’ve ever written.


Why do I love you? You’ve done nothing but give me false hope. Played me didn’t you? I thought there was a chance even if small. Is this what you always do? It was never lust. Which just makes it even worse. I wish it would’ve been just that. Could’ve just moved on so easily to the next. But you’re still holding space in my heart, no room for someone who is yearning for my entire heart and putting every single effort in everyday. And here I am…


Writing a letter for someone who will never care about me. Holding space for someone who never wanted or needed me. Nothing in common in the end, I suppose. Why why why? Why do I love you? Not fair. You were the calm space to my storm. Maybe that’s why. But in the end, you walked away quietly. Maybe that was a natural way for you to let it die out. You just wanted it to end naturally without cutting it out clean like you did before.


Just so many things left unsaid. You’re so quiet you never opened up. So closed off. I was talking to a wall the entire time. You express yourself better everywhere else than with me. I think this just proves how absolutely lonely I am. Yearning for someone who didn’t give a f*ck about me. 


I’m just sad. So sad. I hope I find it in me to let go of the thought of you, and how you were before you decided to drift and slowly torturing me until I took my metaphorical bags and left.


Such a long letter. For someone who probably doesn’t even deserve it. And I cried, again. Cried for someone who doesn’t care. Cried for my own low standards. You’ve caused me so much pain. And I can’t hate you, it sucks so bad. If I could hate you I’d be mad, and I would rather feel mad than sad. 


I don’t miss you, I miss what we were before you decided to push me away. Shoving me to a corner until I had no way out but to dissipate. Broke me a million pieces, again. Why do I do this to myself? Barely coming up for air when you were drowning me the entire time. Making me feel I had no self worth, sending you things that would’ve made other men so wild for me. And you? Just a simple response, nothing would’ve touched your heart or any part of you for that matter.


I’m pathetic. So pathetic for even trying. And I love you, and I’m sorry I was never enough.",1,1755617981.0,UnsentLettersRaw,7,0.67,False

A month ago I (M31) matched with this girl (F30) on Tinder. Since the first message, the conversation was smooth and fun for both of us. A few days later we had our first date and it went as good as you can imagine.

Since then we've seen each other every few days, like twice a week. Either going for a coffee date or just hanging out at my place. Hours fly by and we'd chat all day long.

From the beginning she told me about her past trauma. To be more specific, last year her at the time boyfriend was sadly killed by a drunk driver, they had been dating for 4 years. She sounded very mature on how she dealt with it at the time and how she was doing now. I of course listened to her and gave her as much support as I could.

Last week, she stopped replying to my messages, has been super down and according to her own words ""frustrated"". She said she was frustrated about meeting people/dating, work, family stuff, among other things. I asked if she was frustrated with me too and she said that she wasn't and to not overthink it (I'm clearly failing at that). That this is all about her, her ex and how overwhelming everything feels. That this wasn't a break up. She also said that right now she needs to be with friends (they were her ex's friends at first and now they are a extremely close group) because she doesn't have to explain them and she doesn't want to talk about things that will make me feel uncomfortable.

Since then I respect her space, sending a short, sweet message every couple of days like ""I miss you, hope you're doing better"" to which she reacts with a heart. Or silly IG reels to which she also has reacted.

It's been almost a week and I'm not sure what am I supposed to do? Keep it radio silence with a short message every couple of days like I been doing? Anxiety is killing me, tbh. Is there something I can be doing that would be better?",2,1755617852.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

**The backstory:** I'm a tech support specialist, and I got tired of seeing businesses struggle with the same repetitive customer questions over and over. You know the drill - customers asking stuff that's already in the documentation, but finding the right answer takes forever.

**What ResQ does:**
- Upload your docs/PDFs/knowledge base 
- AI answers customer questions automatically using YOUR content
- Embeddable widget for your website
- Tells you when it can't find answers (so you know what's missing from your docs)
- Different AI personalities (professional, friendly, technical, etc.)

The coolest feature? AI voice calls are included in the Pro plan. Customers can literally TALK to your knowledge base.

**The offer:** First 20 people who sign up get 1 month of Pro completely free (normally $49/month). I'm a solo dev just trying to get some real-world feedback and testimonials.

I'd love to hear what you think! Any reviews, suggestions, or even roasts are welcome - I'm here to make this thing actually useful for people.

Thanks for reading my wall of text! 

P.S. - Built this whole thing between family time with my 4 kids, so if there are any bugs, blame the sleep deprivation 😅",1,1755617711.0,SaaS,0,1.0,False

1multhj,https://www.reddit.com/r/startup_germany/comments/1multhj/whats_the_biggest_advantage_and_challenge_of/,Whats the biggest advantage and challenge of building a company in Germany?,"I am from India and have been living in Germany over 4 years now. Although I am working full time, I am building something on the side with the aim of moving to entrepreneurship full time. I have worked both in India and Germany roughly about the same time by now and have tried to be active in the founder / startup space in both places. Germany and India are in different boats w.r.t demographic, population, infrastructure etc and have unique characteristics that could be seen as a boon or bliss.

So here is my view of some challenges and advantages of starting something (or atleast the journey of doing so) in Germany vs India:

Advantages in Germany:

1. Good university and research prospects

Germany is well known to have really good education system, especially at the university level in the world. Universities like TUM, RWTH, Humboldt etc are really famous and have been at the epicenter of major technological and scientific innovations. This allows Germany to build innovative next generation solutions with high entry barrier.

2. Germany still rules manufacturing innovation

Well, yes, Germany's manufacturing industry has been suffering for some years now due to global shifts and competition. It is also true that price competitiveness of many germany manufacturing industries are also questionable at the moment. But that being said, manufacturing still drives the economy and high entry barrier innovations still belong in germany. Industries like machine tool builders, manufacturing software companies like Bosch and Siemens are still really successfull and form backbone of german ecosystem. While price competitiveness is questionable, innovation still is a core part of german manufacturing industry.

3. Outlook on life and work

People in Europe, so naturally Germany, approach work differently than many other parts of world like India and other asian countries. Work is seen as one part of life and not as the center point. The hustle and grind is there in startup space, but still always complemented with vacations, taking time off etc. In the startup world, people may see this as weakness, but I prefer to see this as setting priority for overall well being of a human in the long term

Problems in Germany:

1. General lack of entrepreneurial mindset

One of the most common things in Germany, surprisingly even among the young crowd is that people lack mindset of entrepreneurship even in startup hubs like Berlin. People prefer more laid back work life and seem to be quite happy with it. The attitude of 80% is ""why bother with all that effort"" whereas in places like Bangalore in India, every coffee table in a cafe at any point has atleast 10 startup ideas. I know this is a qualitative feeling- but the truth that urge for being at the tip and starting something is just ""not in the air"" here.

2. Failure is looked down upon

I think this is probably also the case in India but in contrast to US, failure in Germany as an entrepreneur is not something seen largely positive. Of course, I dont mean that people will ridicule or make fun of your failure but it doesn't carry any meaning or it is rather indifferent. But in US, I noticed, people have started something and have failed, are seen with a warrior who did their best. It is worn as a badge of honor.

3. Funding game is different

I would not necessarily say Europe (or Germany) should follow the US mindset of investment. But that being said, it is not obvious to state the risk apetite of investors is unfortunately quite low - to the point, anything that goes beyond conventional solid business model and path to profitability is scrutinized heavily. Yes, there are exceptions but that is the general sentiment. Cases like insolvency of Lilium are examples of this",2,1755617616.0,startup_germany,1,1.0,False

1mulqkl,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeRigged/comments/1mulqkl/should_you_buy_the_best_electric_kettle_dezin/,Should You Buy the Best Electric Kettle DEZIN 8856 for Tea Fans,"I’ve been testing the DEZIN 8856 electric kettle daily for a few weeks now, and it’s been an interesting experience getting to know this sleek, modern appliance. With a fancy LED display and multiple preset temperature settings, it’s hard not to feel like I’ve upgraded my tea and coffee game significantly. But not everything is perfect—there are a few quirks worth mentioning along with the good stuff.

**Design and Build Quality**

The kettle’s black-coated stainless steel body catches your eye immediately. It feels sturdy yet lightweight at just under three pounds, making it easy to handle and move around the kitchen. The dual-wall design is a nice touch—not only does it help keep the heat inside, but the exterior stays cool to the touch. No accidental burns while making your evening tea! The large opening at the top also makes it easy to clean, so I didn’t have to wrestle with any complex cleaning procedures.

**Performance and Heating**

This thing heats water fast. With its 1200W power, the kettle can boil a full 1.7 liters of water in about five to seven minutes. For someone like me with zero patience during a caffeine emergency, this is an absolute lifesaver. You can select your desired temperature from 115°F to 195°F in 10°F increments, which is displayed in real time on the LED screen. Whether it’s green tea, white tea, or just plain hot water, this kettle’s precision is unmatched. Tapping the ""SET TEMP"" button adjusts the temperature, while the ""BOIL STOP"" feature lets you boil water quickly and then keep it warm at the preset temperature.

**Good Points**

- The nine adjustable temperature presets cater to different drinks like tea, coffee, or milk.  
- It heats water quickly and efficiently, saving me a ton of time.  
- Features like automatic shut-off, boil-dry protection, and over-temperature protection ensure safety.  

[Ready to buy DEZIN 8856? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://raifords.com/p/b0d9gdx83l/)

**Keep Warm and Memory Function**

The option to keep water warm for up to 12 hours has been a game changer for my busy mornings. I don’t have to re-boil water multiple times throughout the day. Another nifty feature is the memory function—it picks up from your previous settings, so you’re not stuck reprogramming it every single time you use it. Both of these features make the kettle feel a lot smarter than your average kitchen appliance.

**Drawbacks**

- The LED display isn’t backlit, which can make it tricky to read in dim lighting.  
- The exterior paint feels like it might scratch easily with heavy use.  
- Some people might find the power cord a bit short depending on their kitchen layout.  

**Food-Grade Stainless Steel Interior**

Perhaps one of the most crucial factors for me is the material. All parts of the kettle that touch the water are made of BPA-free, food-grade stainless steel. I appreciate the lack of exposed plastic—it feels more hygienic and, frankly, just more appealing knowing my drinks won’t end up tasting funky. You can tell they really went the extra mile with this part of the design.

**Safety Features**

For someone as clumsy as me, the kettle’s built-in safety features are essential. Automatic shut-off, boil-dry protection, and over-temperature protection are all part of the package. I’m someone who has literally walked out of the room with a kettle going, so knowing that this one won’t either dry up or explode in my absence is a solid reassurance.

**Competitive Options**

When compared to other electric kettles, like the COSORI or the Cuisinart CPK-17, the DEZIN might not always lead in pure aesthetics, but it’s on par in functionality. For example, the COSORI offers similar temperature control, but it lacks the memory function this model delivers. The Cuisinart has a slightly better build in terms of premium finish, but it falls short in its keep-warm duration.

**Value Proposition**

While it’s not the cheapest option out there, the combination of convenience, safety, and durability makes this kettle a solid investment. Sure, you might pay a little more than a basic model, but the extra features make up for it. If you’re someone who’s particular about your hot drinks or needs an efficient tool for boiling water, it’s more than worth considering.

1mulpaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/fearofflying/comments/1mulpaw/tips_tricks_i_use_that_have_helped_me/,Tips & tricks I use that have helped me!,"Hello everybody! I am gearing up for a long haul flight and stumbled across this sub. I wanted to share my experience and provide some useful tips and tricks that have helped me tremendously over the last few years. 

First, as context. I grew up flying, I took my first flight at 6 weeks old! I flew solo cross-country twice before I turned 18. I never had any issues or fear or anxiety. That is, until I was 20. 

When I was 20, I was on a 3.5 hour flight. I fell asleep, but woke up about an hour in. No big deal, I'll just listen to music or look at my phone. Then I realized, I had gotten a new phone and it didn't have anything on it - no music, no movies, nothing! I was going to have to just sit there for another 2.5 hours, cue panic. I started having intense anxiety. I felt like I had to get off the plane, I needed off, but I couldn't get off. I went into the bathroom and started throwing up in the toilet. I was having a full blown anxiety attack. 

It was horrible. Ever since then, I've always been scared it was going to happen again. That I was going to feel trapped and helpless. But I haven't let it stop me from living my life. The first flight I took after that, I started having another anxiety attack and was literally breathing deeply into the barf bag. Every flight since then I have slowly conquered my fear. Since then, I've flown cross country two more times and I flew to Europe last summer. So, now for the advice. 

• I quit vaping/all nicotine. This was by far the biggest thing that helped me. This got rid of my anxiety in general but really, really helped me lose some flight anxiety. Considering I had started vaping heavily at the time of my first anxiety attack on a flight, I've always wondered if this was a the main culprit.

• I do not consume any caffeine at least 24 hours before my flight. I love my morning cup of coffee, but it makes me jittery, so I skip it. And I don't have any soda either. No caffeine for me. 

• I try to take a long walk or get some exercise in before I fly. Moving the body is proven to lessen anxiety and it has me feeling good before being seated on a flight. 

• I ALWAYS look up how long the flight will be and I listen to the captain's announcement at the beginning of the flight where they say the expected flight time. This is especially important for smaller flights where you don't have access to a flight tracker. Then, I use the stopwatch feature on my phone to track the flight time. I use stopwatch to count up, so I know exactly how long I've been on the flight and roughly how much longer we have to go. I start it as soon as the wheels lift up. I like doing this better than using a count down timer because I know how long it's been vs counting down and having to do math!

• I always look at the seat map of the plane before boarding, so I'm familiar with the layout and there are no surprises. 

• I look up my flight using the flighty app so I can see the expected route. Sometimes, you can even access flighty mid-flight and track the plane, which is nice. I like being able to look and see ""oh, I'm over Kansas now"" or whatever. 

• I always have something sour to suck on or chew gum as a distraction.  

• I always have at least 3 different movies or shows to watch, as well as plenty of music to listen to. 

• I always text my friends before I fly and ask them to send me good vibes. This is silly but it's become a ritual I won't depart from. 

• I dress in loose layers so I can be comfortable no matter the temperature on the plane. 

• I get to my gate at least 1 hour before boarding. I like being able to sit there before I have to get on the plane. Being rushed would make me feel stressed. If I had to go straight from security and walk straight on the plane it would make me already significantly stressed so I give myself plenty of time to dilly dally. 

• I always make sure to have plenty of sleep the night before I fly. When I'm tired, I get more anxious. It's important that I'm well rested to experience max success. 

Anyway, these are all things that have helped me. I know some of these things might be repetitive of what's on this sub, but maybe one of these things will resonate with someone and help them!

He uses advanced language correctly (narrating stories about trains “thundering” down lines and characters being “devastated” just to name a couple of words), he can count to 100, add and subtract between 1-20, he can complete 40 piece puzzles by himself, he can read basic cvc words and sound out new 3 letter words by himself. He can write his name (with poor handwriting). He does not excel in arts and crafts but he likes playing with paints. He can even speak to new people in coffee shops and order drinks/ bread etc happily

One problem is his confidence in a new situation and his defiance. I don’t want to discourage his “no” because I know it keeps him safe. I don’t want to teach him that he has to do something an adult tells him to do, but I do want him to show how intelligent and capable he is in a new situation. 

The biggest issue is his reluctance to give something new a go. He wants to watch me doing it multiple times sometimes for months on end before he tries. How can I encourage him to just try a new activity? He wouldn’t even go down a slide till he was 3. I never pushed him into it but I’m worried he will be misunderstood when he starts school (in a couple of weeks) and they will think that his reluctance/ lack of confidence = lack of ability ",1,1755617337.0,ECEProfessionals,7,1.0,False

How to move on??,"I started work at a new place and I meet this guy. At first, he seems super friendly and talkative and nice in general. Being at a new place where I don't know anyone and also being the shy person that I am, I really appreciate this. He somehow manages to get my number (I only gave him my number for work related stuff), and he starts messaging me everyday. I'm very timid and naive so I don't really get what he wants. I keep it formal, nothing flirty. He was always the one messaging first and trying to initiate small talk during coffee breaks at work. This continued until he confessed his attraction, I told him I'm not interested and would rather stay friends (I didn't want it to be awkward because I was still going to see him everyday). Sometime later, I find out he has a girlfriend and he didn't even try to hide it. I don't care (I never did in the first place), but the thing is he never stopped pursuing me. Everyday, he would try to initiate small talk or stares at me too long, it got to the point where he became too touchy with me. I told him again to leave me alone, so he apologises to me, and we stopped talking but he never stopped with his stares and comments. A few months go by, and I forget about all of this, and to me,  we were back to two normal coworkers interacting everyday. One day, he was about to get relocated to another branch, and so these were his final days in the same state. He messages me a few days before his departure, and asks to meet. He said that he wanted to meet to clear out any misunderstanding, and that he didn't want to leave things weird between us (especially since we will see eachother again in a business meeting in some time) he suggested to meet at his place to play games just as friends. 
I was very hesitant at first, but I thought to myself that if it is the last time that we talk ever, then maybe I should go and see what he has to say (just curiosity). So I go to meet him, and we chat and nothing happens between us. During my stay, he hints several times that he wants to kiss me and flirts with me, so I immediately reject him, he backs off and doesn't push it. At the end before leaving, he confessed to me (again) his feelings, so I tell him that he has a girlfriend and that I'm not this type of girl even if I had the slightest feelings for him. He said he just wanted to tell me about his feelings because he wants to be truthful and that he doesn't count this as cheating, so in his mind he didn't do anything wrong. I tell him that to me this is not right and that we can never be together, and I leave. 

Now, a few weeks later, his girlfriend sends me a friend request on FB. I'm so confused, and I don’t know what she wants. Maybe he told her about what happened. I feel so bad eventhough I constantly rejected his advances over several months and didn't do anything. I just don't want anything to do with these people, and just want to forget. 
I just need your thoughts on this and whether I did anything wrong (this matters to me as I mean no harm to anyone). Please be kind. 

Edit: just to make things clearer for everyone, that day I met with him at his place, he seemed to have other intentions (he bascially tried to make out with me). I just didn't go into details.

I was at least a bottle of wine person for the past 15 years. Coincidentally, I had been waking up with GERD and severe retching everyday. It would happen multiple times a day and in front of coworkers/kids. It was incredibly embarrassing. 

After a month of cutting out alcohol, all my retching has stopped. Something I used to hide and explain away as GERD seemingly was all due to alcohol. I used to blame it on coffee, soda, boba tea but I’ve been drinking all of that and more and absolute no retching. It’s insane. Anyone struggling with GERD needs to stop drinking. It’s helped me wean off of my 2x Pantoprozale to just Pepcid AC.

1mullm3,https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1mullm3/profiling_containerds_diff_path_why_on²_hurt_us/,Profiling containerd’s diff path: why O(n²) hurt us and how OverlayFS saved the day,"When container commits start taking coffee-break time, your platform’s core workflows quietly fall apart. I spent the last months digging into commit/export slowness in a large, multi-tenant dev environment that runs on Docker/containerd, and I thought the r/kubernetes crowd might appreciate the gory details and trade-offs.

Personal context: I work on a cloud dev environment product (Sealos DevBox). We hit a wall as usage scaled: committing a 10GB environment often took 10+ minutes, and even “add 1KB, then commit” took tens of seconds. I wrote a much longer internal write-up and wanted to bring the useful parts here without links or marketing. I’m sharing from an engineer’s perspective; no sales intent.

Key insights and what actually moved the needle

- The baseline pain: Generic double-walk diffs can go O(n²). Our profiling showed containerd’s diff path comparing full directory trees from the lowerdir (base image) and the merged view. That meant re-checking millions of unchanged inodes, metadata, and sometimes content. With 10GB images and many files, even tiny changes paid a huge constant cost.
- OverlayFS already has the diff, if you use it: In OverlayFS, upperdir contains exactly what changed (new files, modified files, and whiteouts for deletions). Instead of diffing “everything vs everything,” we shifted to reading upperdir as the ground truth for changes. Complexity goes from “walk the world” to “walk what actually changed,” i.e., O(m) where m is small in typical dev workflows.
- How we wired it: We implemented an OverlayFS-aware diff path that:
  - Mounts lowerdir read-only.
  - Streams changes by scanning upperdir (including whiteouts).
  - Assembles the tar/layer using only those entries.
  - This approach maps cleanly to continuity-style DiffDirChanges with an OverlayFS source, and we guarded it behind config so we can fall back when needed (non-OverlayFS filesystems, different snapshotters, etc.).
- Measured results (lab and prod): In controlled tests, “10GB commit” dropped from ~847s to ~267s, and “add 1KB then commit” dropped from ~39s to ~0.46s. In production, p99 commit latency fell from roughly 900s to ~180s, CPU during commit dropped significantly, and user complaints vanished. The small-change path is where the biggest wins show up; for large-change sets, compression begins to dominate.
- What didn’t work and why:
  - Tuning the generic walker (e.g., timestamp-only checks, larger buffers) gave marginal gains but didn’t fix the fundamental scaling problem.
  - Aggressive caching of previous walks risked correctness with whiteouts/renames and complicated invalidation.
  - Filesystem-agnostic tricks that avoid reading upperdir semantics missed OverlayFS features (like whiteout handling) and produced correctness issues on deletes.
  - Switching filesystems wasn’t feasible mid-flight at our scale; this had operational risk and unclear gains versus making OverlayFS work with us.

A tiny checklist if your commits/exports are slow

- Verify the snapshotter and mount layout:
  - Confirm you’re on OverlayFS and identify lowerdir, upperdir, and merged paths for a sample container.
  - Inspect upperdir to see whether it reflects your actual changes and whiteouts.
- Reproduce with two tests:
  - Large change set: generate many MB/GB across many files; measure commit time and CPU.
  - Tiny delta: add a single small file; if this is still slow, your diff path likely walks too much.
- Profile the hot path:
  - Capture CPU profiles during commit; look for directory tree walks and metadata comparisons vs compression.
- Separate diff vs compression:
  - If small changes are slow, it’s likely the diff. If big changes are slow but tiny changes are fast, compression/tar may dominate.
- Guardrails:
  - Keep a fallback to the generic walker for non-OverlayFS cases.
  - Validate whiteout semantics end-to-end to avoid delete correctness bugs.

Minimal example to pressure-test your path

- Create 100 files of 100MB each (or similar) inside a container, commit, record time.
- Then add a single 1KB file and re-commit.
- If both runs are similarly slow, you’re paying a fixed cost unrelated to the size of the delta, which suggests tree-walking rather than change-walking.

A lightweight decision guide

- Are you on OverlayFS?
  - Yes → Prefer an upperdir-driven diff. Validate whiteouts and permissions mapping.
  - No → Consider snapshotter-specific paths; if unavailable, the generic walker may be your only option.
- After switching to upperdir-based diffs, is compression now dominant?
  - Yes → Consider parallel compression or alternative codecs; measure on real payloads.
  - No → Re-check directory traversal, symlink handling, and any unexpected I/O in the diff path.
- Do you have many small files?
  - Yes → Focus on syscall counts, directory entry reads, and tar header overhead.

Questions:

- For those running large multi-tenant setups, how have you balanced correctness vs performance in diff generation, especially around whiteouts and renames?
- Anyone using alternative snapshotters or filesystems in production for faster commits? What trade-offs did you encounter operationally?

TL;DR
- We cut commit times by reading OverlayFS upperdir directly instead of double-walking entire trees. Small deltas dropped from tens of seconds to sub-second. When diffs stop dominating, compression typically becomes the next bottleneck.

1mulkc3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1mulkc3/my_journey_and_some_encouragement_and_questions/,My Journey and Some Encouragement and Questions,"So my journey with this started in late January of this year. I had never really had a ton of heartburn before, but I started having it more and more, along with discomfort in my stomach and chest. Also, burping, so much burping.  
I had previously had an endoscopy done for another reason, so I was able to see my GI pretty quickly. I had already started Nexium, but it really wasn't doing much. When I switched from the clear minis to the regular ones, it helped more, but I'm not sure if that was just due to improvements or a genuine difference.  
I had my endoscopy done, and they found that my stomach was red and irritated, and my esophagus had cell changes consistent with mild chronic reflux.  
I changed my diet, but not enough frankly, for a few months. During this time, I had terrible stomach pain when I woke up in the morning and often throughout the day. The burping and reflux started to get somewhat better, but it still wasn't a dramatic improvement. My doctor gave me a handout on what to eat and not eat, but really wasn't great about being serious about it. Just more so, ""just keep taking the meds and you should be healed,"" and was surprised when I wasn't in a month and change. Reading stuff here I decided to go all in on bland food. That started around June. All I have eaten since then has been:

* Boiled chicken
* ground turkey
* Rice/rice cakes
* roasted potatoes/sweet potatoes with a tiny amount of salt
* steamed carrots
* steamed snow peas
* banana
* unsweet applesauce
* a tiny bit of peanut butter or almond butter
* keifr

I had a road trip where I didn't have a chance to make my own food, so I ate a turkey sandwich with basically nothing on it from Jimmy Johns going there and back. I wasn't \*too\* affected by it, but I knew I had to keep being strict. I recently had a piece of naan bread, like a tiny piece, but that's it. I also, since reading things started to take

* DGL
* l glutamine
* zinc carnosine

This all has 1) really caused me to lose a lot of weight, over 30lbs since this all started, and  2) really been the thing that has helped me start to feel a heck of a lot better.

I have another few weeks of really bland food left, but I am getting through it. I really miss my cold brew coffee, and I have found myself literally licking my lips looking at even turkey sandwiches at a grocery store.

So, if you are here, starting to deal with this, its okay. You might see some of the folks here with really terrible symptoms and worry that might be you. And I thought so too. I feel terrible for folks who are dealing with this for years and years.  However, try to do what your doctor tells you, change your diet, and do the work.

At this point, I still have some burping, mostly at night, and occasional bits of reflux, like someone is spraying my throat with a mouthwash of slight acid. But I'm a lot better. I have to remind myself of that, I'm still healing, but I've come so very far. So my question for folks who have dealt with this is this: what did you do when you got past the 90-day period of bland food? How long did you still have symptoms like burping and some reflux?

1muljul,https://www.reddit.com/r/TechGearReviews/comments/1muljul/explore_the_best_usb_flash_drive_samsung_bar_plus/,Explore the Best USB Flash Drive Samsung BAR Plus Performance,"Testing out the Samsung MUF-128BE3 Bar Plus was definitely an interesting experience. As someone who uses flash drives daily, I never realized how much I could appreciate a USB drive until I laid hands on this sleek little beauty. It’s not just about transferring files; it’s about reliability, speed, and a design that doesn’t make you feel like you’re dealing with an outdated tech relic.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that struck me was the design. This flash drive is everything I didn’t know I needed in a portable storage device. Its champagne silver finish and unibody metal construction scream elegance. Not to mention, it feels incredibly solid in hand—no cheap plastic here. The built-in keyring design was an unexpected bonus for me. I’m notorious for misplacing small gadgets, so being able to attach this to my keys is a lifesaver. It’s compact enough to not weigh down my keychain while adding a bit of flair. For a 128GB drive, it doesn’t compromise on style or functionality.

**Speed and Performance**  
Moving large files has always been a bit of a hassle with older drives, but not with this one. Samsung’s tech claims a read speed of up to 400MB/s, and I tested it using a mix of 4K videos and massive backups. I managed to transfer a 3GB 4K UHD video to my laptop in approximately ten seconds. The speed is as advertised (as long as your system supports USB 3.1). Whether it’s for work videos, photos, or digital art projects, it refuses to slow me down. This makes it incredibly reliable and efficient, even when dealing with data-heavy tasks.

**Highlights**  
- Stunning metal unibody design with champagne silver finish  
- Impressive read speeds of up to 400MB/s for fast file transfers  
- Integrated keyring prevents misplacement  
  

[Check Samsung MUF-128BE3 price on Amazon.](https://batterydiscounter.com/p/b07bpk3xww/)

**Durability and Rugged Features**  
I’ve owned flash drives before that couldn’t survive a mild tumble or an accidental coffee spill, which is why I’m particularly impressed by its rugged refinement. Samsung packed durability features galore into this little gadget—waterproof for up to 72 hours, shock-proof, temperature-proof (whether you’re freezing or sweating it out), magnet-proof, and even X-ray-proof. I may or may not have tested the magnet-proof claim by casually placing it near a tiny speaker magnet—and it passed! There’s a peace of mind knowing that, as clumsy as I am, this flash drive can handle it all without compromising what’s stored within.

**Areas for Improvement**  
Of course, no product is without its quirks.  
- Lack of a protective cap for the USB port leaves it exposed to dust  
- Body can get scratched if left on a heavily-loaded keychain  
- Mac users might find it not optimized out of the box for Mac file systems  

**Target Users**  
While the Samsung Bar Plus has clear merits for professionals who handle heavy files, it’s honestly a great pick for anyone. Whether you’re a student transferring assignments, a photographer backing up RAW images, or just someone who needs reliable storage on the go—it caters to almost everyone. However, those primarily using older systems might not get the same blazing speeds since USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 ports can be a limiting factor.

**Direct Competitors**  
Having tested brands like SanDisk and Kingston in the past, I couldn’t help but draw comparisons. SanDisk’s flash drives often come with dual connectors, which can be handy for mobile users, but they don’t quite match the rugged build of the Bar Plus. On the other hand, the Kingston DataTraveler might come close in terms of durability, but its read and write speeds feel sluggish compared to Samsung’s offering. Ultimately, this flash drive stands out for combining aesthetics with incredible performance.

**Quality for Price**  
When it comes to the price-to-performance equation, this isn’t the cheapest option out there, but you get what you pay for and then some. Paying a little extra for something that’s so fast, durable, and downright classy feels like a smart choice. I’ve had cheaper drives in the past, only to replace them after minimal use. Here, I feel confident this flash drive will hold up for years, thanks to features like its solid build, resistant properties, and Samsung’s reputation in data storage.

1mulfdl,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mulfdl/i_work_nights_at_an_automated_steel_plant_its/,"I work nights at an automated steel plant. It’s usually dead quiet-last night, I found out I wasn’t alone. (Part 1)","It was 10 p.m. when I pulled onto the highway, music playing, no other cars around. The factory lights were already glowing ahead, the hum of machines almost in my head before I even got there.

At night, it’s just me. The day shift handles the hands-on work. My job is mostly panel checks—HMI/SCADA screens, making sure everything stays in spec.

When I parked, I noticed something odd: a crooked old sedan in the abandoned lot by the decommissioned wing. That part of the plant’s been dead for years, connected but sealed off. No one ever parks there.

Probably day shift, I told myself. Someone forgetting something. I snapped a quick photo of the car, just in case.

Inside, everything felt normal. I grabbed coffee in the break room—still warm from the day crew—and looked out through the tall glass windows. Below me, the aisles stretched on forever, conveyor belts moving like veins under the lights. The sound was strangely calming, a kind of mechanical breathing.

Then I saw someone moving at the far end of the hall.

Looked like a worker in standard gear.

I pushed open the heavy fire-rated door and headed down, coffee in hand. The place is huge—it takes me about four minutes to reach my booth. I checked a few corners along the way, but the figure was gone.

I told myself he’d probably already left.

In the control booth, I tossed my keys onto the console, logged into the HMI, and scrolled through process trends. Everything was nominal. I put on some music (not allowed, but who’s gonna know?) and leaned back.

Sometimes I close my eyes for a bit—“resting them,” as I call it. I must have drifted for half an hour before a deep clang jolted me awake. At the same time, a red banner flashed on the screen: **Line 4 fault.**

Of course. Line 4—right at the transfer to the old mill. The stretch I hate the most. Patchy lighting, shadows that look like they move.

I muttered, *“I hate this job,”* as I zipped up my coverall, clipped my helmet, and grabbed the high-lumen flashlight.

When I got there, the bridge crane had dropped a steel bar across the conveyor. I killed power at the E-stop, wrestled the bar aside, and reset the drive. Everything looked fine. Morning shift could deal with the rest.

On my way back, I froze.

One of the heavy sliders rumbled shut. I knew the sound immediately: the fire-rated shutter at the break-room landing.

I ducked into the booth, half-expecting alarms on the screens. Nothing. My flashlight clinked on the desk as I reached for my keys.

They weren’t there.

They were just… gone**.**

I forget things a lot, so I tried not to panic. Maybe I’d left them in the break room. I grabbed the light and walked to the shutter. It had slammed so hard it bounced back half-open.

I pushed it wider. The break room looked normal, but the air felt… thicker. Wrong.

The lights buzzed to life, and I headed down to the vestibule. That’s when I saw it: a long black trench coat hanging on the rack.

I swear it wasn’t there before.

A chill crawled down my spine.

For the first time, I thought about that old sedan outside.

I turned back toward the stairwell—and my beam caught him.

The worker. Standing at the top of the stairs.

The instant the light hit, he was gone. Not like he ran. Just… gone.

The door slammed again, hard enough I heard the lock throw.

I bolted up the steps, nearly tripping at the top, and yelled:

“HEY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?”

My voice echoed down the stairwell.

No answer.

I used 15 g of Onyx Eclipse with 115 g of water (1:7.5 ratio). Dark roast so water is at 90 celsius 

Setup & steps (inverted AeroPress):
•	Invert AeroPress with plunger about halfway depressed. 
•	Add coffee grounds
•	Start timer to avoid over-steeping (whole process takes about a 1.15m from start to finish 
•	Pour in water, stir well to fully wet grounds
•	Attach Fellow Prismo + paper filter on top
•	Retract plunger slightly to avoid coffee spillage when tipping
•	Flip AeroPress with cup upside down to avoid any projectiles. (Retracting plunger prior will usually help here, but don’t want an accidental coffee squirt gun)
•	Push pretty quickly through the Prismo and filter paper (through hiss)

Result: fills about ¾ of a basic espresso cup, super sweet, syrupy, and clear — almost like a super lungo with pour-over clarity.

Has anyone else tried this “filter shot” method? 
I’m basically using Allen’s recipe without adding water. I’m just curious if anyone else enjoys it the same way? I’m usually more into pour overs but this is a great way to pull out any interesting flavors in the coffee I’m trying. ",1,1755616757.0,AeroPress,3,0.67,False

1mulc6y,https://www.reddit.com/r/ActuallyReviewed/comments/1mulc6y/explore_if_cleancult_laundry_detergent_sheets_are/,Explore If Cleancult Laundry Detergent Sheets Are Worth the Hype,"The Cleancult Laundry Detergent Sheets stood out as a unique and eco-friendly alternative to traditional detergents. The promise of effective cleaning combined with sustainability had me curious, especially since I'm always on the lookout for laundry products that are both practical and environmentally responsible. Spoiler alert: these sheets tick several boxes, but there are definitely some aspects to consider before jumping on board.

**Compact and Mess-Free Design**

One of the best things about these laundry detergent sheets is their sheer convenience. Unlike the bulky liquid detergent bottles cluttering up laundry rooms, these sheets come in a compact and resealable box. That makes them easy to store and ensures no messy spills while doing laundry. Moreover, the minimalist approach is ideal for trips; I’ve taken these sheets on a couple of weekend getaways, and not dealing with leaks in my luggage was a relief. They're pre-measured too, which implies absolutely no guesswork involved, a nice touch for those of us who are prone to overusing liquid detergent.

**Performance in Cleaning Stains and Odors**

These aren't just about convenience; they’ve got cleaning power too. Containing three stain-fighting enzymes, the sheets handle most of the usual culprits like coffee, grass, and grease fairly well. I put these to the test one afternoon after a family barbecue, where ketchup-stained shirts and marinara-laden napkins were no strangers. The results? Surprisingly effective. Clothes came out smelling fresh and noticeably soft, thanks to the triple-action formula designed to fight stains, remove odors, and add a touch of softness to every load.  

[Check Cleancult Laundry Detergent Sheets price on Amazon.](https://info.senaar.com/p/b0crgrgmhh/)

**Eco-Friendly Packaging and Sustainability**

The packaging of these detergent sheets screams sustainability. Made from 100% recyclable paper, the brand emphasizes reducing plastic waste, which feels good, to be honest. Traditional detergent bottles are notorious for their environmental impact, and this liquidless alternative is a step forward in reducing single-use plastic. I also like that the lightweight design minimizes the carbon footprint when shipping. It's not just thoughtful branding; it feels like a tangible, meaningful commitment to being kinder to the planet.

**Target Users and Sensitive Skin Safety**

Anyone looking for a simpler way to tackle laundry without the mess or hassle of liquid detergents will appreciate this product. Families, frequent travelers, and those converting to an environmentally-conscious life will likely enjoy it. Another thing that caught my attention is their sensitive-skin-friendly formula, free from 1,4-dioxane, phosphates, parabens, phthalates, dyes, and SLS. A friend of mine, who struggles with skin issues triggered by regular laundry detergents, tried these and didn’t notice any irritation, which speaks volumes about how gentle they are.

**Scent Experience**

The fresh linen fragrance adds a subtle elegance to clothes after washing. It’s not overpowering like some detergents that scream “industrial-strength fragrance,” yet it’s strong enough to give that ""clean clothes"" smell. Each sheet has just the right balance of scent that doesn’t overpower but still feels like it’s doing its job effectively.

**Positives**

- Compact and resealable box; perfect for small spaces and travel  
- Effective at tackling common stains and odors with a triple-action formula  
- Gentle on the skin, free of harsh chemicals  
- Eco-friendly, with recyclable packaging and a smaller carbon footprint  
- Discreet, fresh linen scent

**Shortcomings**

- Struggles with extreme-heavy stains (think oil and ink) compared to strong liquid detergents  
- No fragrance options beyond fresh linen, limiting variety  
- Might not be cost-effective for larger households running frequent loads
- Sheets may dissolve slower in cold water machines

**Competitive Options**

Compared to traditional liquid detergents like Tide or Gain, these sheets have a clear edge in terms of being eco-friendly and space-saving. While leading brands often deliver more concentrated cleaning power, they also come at the expense of excessive plastic waste and bulkiness. As for pods like those from Arm & Hammer or Persil, the Cleancult sheets win for their simplicity—there’s no wrapping to dissolve, just the sheet itself. However, heavy-duty liquid options might still have the upper hand when it comes to deeply set stains or industrial-level cleaning. 

The sheets also face competition from newer brands offering similar concepts, like Tru Earth or Blueland, which offer the same sustainability promise but differ in price points and fragrance options. Tru Earth, for instance, comes with a mild eco-friendly vibe but feels pricier per load. Cleancult’s sheets strike a balance and feel easier to use on a daily basis.

**Cost Efficiency**

Regarding value, these sheets are certainly smarter for those looking to reduce environmental impact without sacrificing convenience. The price point is slightly higher than basic liquid detergents, but when you factor in the eco-friendly angle and the convenience of no mess or waste, it feels justified. Families that do several loads daily might need to calculate whether the cost per load fits their budget, though. Still, for an average household aiming to combine practicality with sustainability, they provide solid cost-effectiveness.

1mulbfz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mulbfz,Lofoten Long Crossing – most adventurous thru-hike of our life (Reviev and tips),"**Lofoten Long Crossing – most adventurous thru-hike of our life**

After the Corfu Trail and the GR221, it was about time to level up our long-distance hiking game.  
My wife and I both had company holidays during the first two weeks of August, which seemed to be the perfect period for the Lofoten Long Crossing. 11 Stages, 15-18km every day, 500-+1000m change in elevation per day, extreme landscape.  
To get there, a bit of planning needed to be done – we took the train to the next airport, flew to Oslo, caught another plane to Bodø, stayed there for one night, and took the first ferry to Moskenes on the Lofoten archipelago the next morning.  
At 11:00, the ferry docked and we were ready to hike from south to north.

Our first five days were self-supported, which added 3.5 kg of food to our backpacks. We tried to stay as light as possible and really only took what seemed necessary (I used every single item in my backpack except the gloves – detailed list will follow).  
Backpacks weighed around 13–15 kg at most, but got lighter day by day. Luckily, you don’t need to bring a lot of water since it’s available everywhere.

The first day already made pretty clear that we were not supposed to underestimate what was ahead of us. We hadn’t expected the terrain to be as steep as it was in some sections (even as Austrians, used to big mountains). The trails are not marked and not well maintained (or not maintained at all) – it’s the perfect adventure.

Nevertheless, we quickly adapted to the difficulties of the trail, developed our trail legs and found our pace. There are stunning views literally around every corner. At first you can’t even comprehend what’s going on… spiky steep peaks, crystal-clear lakes, hardly any vegetation or wildlife at all – just plain rock, grass, bushes and moss.

We were lucky with the weather for the first two days, but unfortunately a bad weather period with rain and strong winds was about to start. After the 4th day of hiking we were forced to take two days off and pitched our tent at a campsite (Ramberg) because the rain was crazy and winds reached up to 70 km/h, which made it unsafe to continue.

After the break, we skipped the sections we had lost, because one of them required a lot of road walking anyway, so it wasn’t too bad.  
Back on the trail it still rained for a couple of hours per day, but we got used to it and also had sunny periods. *Embrace the wet* became our mantra.  
The rain also turned the trail into a boggy mess. Sometimes we were ankle-deep in mud for kilometre after kilometre… but still, you get used to it because everything else is so stunning, and by this point we had developed a huge sense of adventure.

We hiked for another three days, camped at the most beautiful locations, but also had to seek shelter from a storm in a small forest – otherwise our tent would have been ripped apart.  
Day 9 on trail brought heavy rain and winds again. At some point the trail turned into a little creek. We looked at each other and we both knew it was over. We hiked 10 km out to the next road and cell phone reception, booked an apartment on the shore, and hitchhiked 25 km into the next town, where we stayed 3 nights until it was time to get home.

 

* Were we disappointed not to finish? – Yes.
* Did we discuss our decision several times? – Yes.
* Was it the most adventurous thing we’ve ever done together? – 100%
* Would I recommend doing it? To each and everyone!

 

There is one thing you can’t control – and that’s the weather. Weather is king!

We are not regretting a single minute on the trail and it did something to us, I can´t fully name yet but it´s good!

 

 

**Tips for the Long Crossing:**

* Due to rainy, boggy and wet conditions I would **NOT** recommend trail runners. Boots were the better choice.
* Bring a water filter – even tho the water is clear, there is sheep poo everywhere.
* Real Turmat freeze-dried meals are really good, we tried them all. Try Rendeer Stew
* Use a pack liner – rain covers will NOT keep the inside of your backpack dry after several hours or days of rain.
* Keep your camp clothes as dry as possible and bring warm enough layers. Putting on the puffy at the end of the day felt amazing every single time.
* Talk to other hikers about the trail – we got plenty of useful information.
* Eat stockfish.
* Bring all your tent stakes and pitch your tent well – high winds can occur anytime.
* Eat a lot and bring sweets for mental support.
* Your rain jacket will not stay dry – embrace it.
* Norwegian people are really, really friendly. Ask and they will help you (for example, we were allowed to dry our tent in the basement of a campsite).
* Most ferries are free if you’re a pedestrian… and I love boat rides.
* Besides the popular trails there are not many people. Solitude is beautiful.
* Hiking poles were essential for us, especially on boggy terrain and descents.
* Plan more days than there are stages… rest days or forced breaks need to be taken into account.
* Hitchhike roadsections – we hitchhiked 4 times and every single time someone picked us up in less than 5 minutes.
* Avoid walking on the E10 or on bridges – it’s busy and not pleasant without a pedestrian walk.
* Stop and turn around every once in a while – the views change so quickly.
* Don’t get intimidated by other hikers who may be faster or handle difficult terrain better. It’s your hike, it’s your pace.
* There is a ferry from Svolvær to Skutvik and a fast boat to Bodø if you need to return from the northern part to the airport in Bodo.
* Make sure to visit the little café in Vindstad run by volunteers… real trail angels.
* Be kind to each other / your hiking partner – we both had a bad days eventually! Support is everything!
* Wind is your friend when it comes to drying your shoes and tent
* Clif Bars are the best
* Be careful when cooking after a long demanding day on the trail. Your concentration is low, I spilled my boiling water and in a desperate attempt to catch it, I burned a hole in my puffy
* Bring patches to fix your cloths
* Don’t trust the internet, not even me because for you the hike could be different as well.
* No bugs – zero mosquitos. Even tho one hiker told us about one stage where it was terrible.
* Put all your camp cloths and sleeping stuff (earplugs etc.) in the foot box of your sleeping bag, so you don´t have to gather everything together
* Use drybags
* No need for a headlamp in summer. It will not get completely dark
* Bring rain pants not just a rain jacket
* Norway is expensive
* Eat cloudberries – never tested anything close to it and they all along the trail, as well as blueberries.
* Aeropress makes good coffee and is not too heavy for the trail
* Keep your eyes open for sea eagles, they are beautiful
* A straight section of 2km on the map with no change in altitude can take you 2.5h (Forsfjord – Vindstad)
* Merino does the trick
* The MT100 Puffy Jacket from Decathlon is the best bang for your buck
* Prepare your own breakfast to safe money, get enough calories and something tasty in the morning (oatmeal, milkpowder, dried fruit, nuts, chocolate…)
* Switch your phone to flightmode – safes you battery and does not distract you from the beauty and the people around you
* Resupply is easily possible in Ramberg, Leknes and Svolvaer
* Get the reis app for public transport
* Get multiple weather forecast apps just to realize none of the is correct
* Make a lighterpack list even if you are not ultralight in any way, it just helps to get an overview and will help you to sort out. Lighter packs make a safer hike.
* We carried an Garmin Inreach Mini 2…the SOS button provides kind of a safer feeling
* Get a cheap and light foam mat. They are great for breaks, to put under your inflatable mat to give it some protection from the ground or just to lay out stuff on it and have a dry place. There is one from Decathlon that is 5€ and 150g.
* Make friends
* Have fun

 

Thanks for you attention in this matter.

Distinguish yourself from the rest by putting yourself on display in the centre of the restaurant; the red velvet ropes and Versace coffee table will let others know you’ve got money to spend!


At Dessert Yard they’ve been very busy,  and are struggling to keep up with demand. That’s why they’ve employed a pragmatic and nifty vehicle to zip around Halifax’s narrow streets. If you’re lucky you can catch the 9,000 Lbs GMC Hummer EV doing daily runs on the peninsula, you’ll know it when you see it due to the large golden Dessert Yard decals on either side. They’ve opted for the pickup version of this 830 horsepower daily driver for practicality’s sake. It was between a 15 year old Japanese KEI truck, or a fresh off the lot HUMMER; due to environmental concerns they opted for the EV. MSRP on these bad boys starts at $130,000, but can you really put a price tag on environmental stewardship? 

It’s not pretentious if you’ve got the dough. There’s nothing tacky about any of this, it’s quite tasteful actually . It’s not gaudy, it’s godly. It’s not flashy, it’s refined. 

If you disagree with anything I’ve said you’re a low class slob who should be turned around at the door; unfortunately this is not opinion, it’s cut and dry facts.

And so far I have:

* **zero** interest
* **zero** users
* **zero** motivation to continue

So [this solution](https://roomcodes.com/) is an alternative to printing guest brochures or setting up your own website for guests.  
Such solutions already exist, but they are expensive and technical as they are tailored for larger hotels, where as my is not intended for hotels, but for owners of 5-30 units.

When you signup, you can create rooms, each room gets its own QR code which you can download and print at home.  
When you scan that QR code, a website opens with your content.  
You can prepare the content in a very simple Word-like editor, which means that you don't need to have any technical skills to use it.

That content can **automatically be translated** into any language, which means that it can be very useful if host and guest don't share a language. Host can show the guest to scan the QR code and then the guest can read all important info in his language.

Additionally it offers:

* **Room Service**: which means that hosts can offer room service and they receive an email if a request is made (meant to elevate guest experience or to put load off maids)
* **Chatbot**: hosts can provide common questions to the chatbot, and then guests can ask the chatbot instead of the host owner, for example ""how to use the coffee machine?""
* **Online Checkin**: guests can upload their IDs through the webapp and the host can see their IDs in the dashboard (this is literally just an alternative to sending an email with images of IDs)

I honestly think that my idea is not bad, as the reason why I decided to develop this, was based on some experiences which I had with some hosts.

1mul8wj,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewParents/comments/1mul8wj/looking_for_advice_with_feeding_schedule_when/,Looking for advice with feeding schedule when partner goes back to work,"My husband (36) and I (35) are new parents to a 3 week old. He's healthy and feeding/growing very well, but the first week he had jaundice because he wasn't latching well and my milk didn't come in until day 5. We supplemented with formula, and then I started pumping and now he exclusively drinks my breast milk. I don't really mind how he gets fed, but I did want to try breastfeeding because I thought it would be a lot easier than it has turned out to be. Also, I produce a lot of milk; 4 pumps a day at 15 minutes each  produce about 1100-1600 ml. He currently drinks about 700-800 ml a day, plus whatever he may get directly from nursing.

On that, we're still working on him latching more effectively. He's getting better, but it takes about an hour for him to feed at my breast, compared to bottle feeding - we can feed him more volume in less time that seems to satiate him for longer.  The most successful nursing sessions happen in the morning, when my breasts are fuller. However, I still need to pump afterwards because I still have clogs and discomfort.

So, our days look something like this - I take the early morning shift from my husband and feed him around 8 AM; he mostly just nurses from me then but it still takes about 2 hours to get him back down. After that, I'll pump while my husband makes breakfast, coffee, cleans up, and we tag-team getting him back down. The next couple feeds will probably be bottle fed breast milk because of efficiency.  I'll nurse him a couple more times during the day with various levels of success. I pump again once in the afternoon and then before bed around 9 PM (esp if I miss a nursing session). Then I'll wake up around 4 AM to pump because they're super engorged in the middle of the night, and I switch shifts with my husband at that time.

I'm burning out with this schedule even with my husband at home doing the chores and taking turns feeding him. He goes back to work next week, and I don't know how I'm going to keep this up. Like I said, I don't mind the idea of combo feeding and am not worried about supply decreasing, but if I don't pump, my boobs become super engorged and I worry about infection. I just want my baby happy and fed, and I need to be happy and more well rested as well. I am already at risk of PPA/PPD because I have diagnosed anxiety, and I fear that if I keep this schedule up, I'll fall deeper into this.

How would you all propose I adjust my schedule when my husband is back at work? How can I successfully feed him while not risking mastitis? Should I just start weaning for my sanity? Give up nursing and exclusively pump? Or just keep going for a while longer since he is getting better? What should I give up, especially in the morning, when my husband is not around to help?",1,1755616393.0,NewParents,3,1.0,False

1mul7v2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/1mul7v2/making_friends_in_your_20s30s_in_denver_is_not_so/,Making friends in your 20s/30s in Denver is not so easy,"**TL;DR** About three months ago, I posted about building an app for making friends in Denver based on shared interests. A lot of people liked the idea, I got a number of messages, and then the mods removed the post. I'm back here because I built a basic version and I'm looking for people interested in testing it out.

**Why interests?**

I spent a decade in Los Angeles where, the first thing people would ask me was: “What do you do?” Then I moved to Denver. Everyone here asks: “What do you like to do?”

When I think about my closest friendships they've all started from talking about a shared interest. They were never about jobs. They were about bands, soccer teams, coffee spots, and weird YouTube rabbit holes.

And that’s what this app is (hopefully, supposed to be). It’s the friend at the party who says, ""You two should talk, you both grew up in Chicago and like The Shins.""

**Why not just do a \[random\] meetup, friend supper club, etc.?**

If you want to find a friend at a meetup you need to find someone who (a) likes the same things as you and (b) likes going to meetup events to meet new people. I'm not particularly a type (b) person. I find that a lot of meetups end up being awkward until you find someone with a common interest. It's like showing up to Josie's birthday party where the only person you know is Josie and you have no idea who you’re supposed to talk to. Every conversation ends up being some version of ""Hey, how do you know Josie?"" ""Oh."" ""Cool. cool.""

My wife sent me a TikTok from u/artstinkscandleco and I think he sums it up better than I can: *""I see this stuff in the Denver subreddit or on like Denver* *TikTok* *and it's people being like it's so hard to make friends in this city.* *Let's do a meetup at the park or whatever, and I agree that it's tough to make friends in this city. Like I have friends. I moved here two years ago. I have a couple of friends through my work and like my girlfriend's friends, but my social circle is nowhere as robust as it is in the other cities I've lived in. But the problem I have with this type of meetup is that the type of person that I'm gonna realistically wanna be friends with is not the type of person to go to a meetup in the park. And I know that sounds like something that a dick would say. I made a friend at the bar recently. I don't drink, but I go to the bar every Thursday with my girlfriend and we met this man John. He was 61 years old, great guy. So funny. So talkative. And we end up spending like 7 or 8 Thursdays in a row with this dude and we became legitimately like good pals with him. John moved to Greece. John moved to Greece forever. You think I'm gonna find love like I had with John at the park?""*

**So, like, what does it actually do then?**

You take a five-minute quiz to select your interests. You can see people who liked the same things. It gives you a prompt based on your shared interest.

Let's say you and someone else both like the Denver Nuggets. Instead of saying ""Hey, you two both live in Denver"" or ""Hey, you two both like the Nuggets"" it would give you a prompt like ""It's great that MPJ('s contract?) is finally gone. All we need now is for Jamal Murray to take a step up from good to great and that second ring is ours.""

Another aspect is that you unlock profiles by having conversations. This isn't Tinder where you (MPJ) can read through someone's whole profile to decide whether you should meet up and listen to Andrew Tate audio clips (seriously, so glad he's in Brooklyn). When you first match with someone else, you’ll only see a name. But as you message back and forth, more details unlock. It’s like getting to know someone naturally.

**What do you need from me?**

Comment below or send me a message if you're interested. I'll send you the details to log-in and make sure the process works and iron out any errors (I selected that I like rock climbing and crochet, why am I in a conversation with someone about Justin Bieber?).

3. Don’t wait until sunset to visit Bass Harbor Head Lighthouse!- the parking lot is very small and once it’s full the Park ranger will only let you in when someone leaves. 
4. Go to Beal’s Lobster Pier: The views are incredible, the food was delicious, and the service was top notch. Great spot to watch the sunset!

This morning I went downstairs half-asleep to grab my parcel and make a coffee. My mum was already up and immediately asked what was in the box. I mentioned two items but couldn’t remember the rest (I’d literally just woken up), so I said I’d tell her later once I’d opened it properly.

She then started talking about jam and how to thicken it, saying she knew a natural preservative that could do both jobs at once. I tried to join the conversation by mentioning lemon juice, something I know is used in kitchens to preserve meat and other foods. I wasn’t claiming it thickens jam, just sharing knowledge. But she snapped at me, saying “How is lemon juice going to thicken jam?” and dismissed what I said entirely. I tried to explain I was just talking about preservatives, not thickeners, but she didn’t seem to care.

Then, when I put the milk back in the fridge, she accused me of slamming the door. Our fridge is packed and has a silicone seal — it closes heavy, but it doesn’t slam. I told her I was just putting the milk away, but she insisted, saying “I could feel it.” That turned into another argument.

I told her, “Can you just leave me alone and stop bullying me as soon as I’ve woken up? This is my first coffee.” She responded with “Wow,” and I said, “Yeah, that’s what my friends say when I tell them how you treat me.”

I admit I snapped a little, but I feel like I’m constantly treated with little to no respect. It’s like she purposely does things to make me feel uncomfortable or provoke me, and then denies any wrongdoing. If I react, she uses that to paint me as the only one in the wrong. Even when she slightly admits she might’ve been harsh, she still says I shouldn’t let anyone affect my mood — basically blaming me for being upset.

Today I was told I was rude and hurtful, but honestly, I found it rude how she dismissed my comment about lemon juice and hurtful that she never takes accountability. I always say sorry, even when I don’t think I’ve done anything wrong. I own my mistakes and try to learn from them. But she never does. It’s like she lives in this delusional world where she’s flawless and everyone else is beneath her.

I've got this video podcast (they call it ""vodcast"" our days?) called **The Paint Point** and I'm looking for NYC artists to have real conversations with – about the behind-the-scenes of being an artist nobody talks about.

I already have one episode up, and I'm genuinely excited to keep these conversations going.

Looking for artists who are actively making it work – exhibitions, regular sales, studio practices, projects you want to highlight, or just behind-the-scenes stories that helped you understand something about art world.

**What you get:** Full episode posted on YouTube + 3-5 short clips I'll create for your own content. (TikTok, ig reels, yt shorts)

He was my light group head back then. Fell for him because, for some reason, he just knows the right things to say. he became an image of god for me here on earth.

I started going to our youth gathering in January 2017. However, i was only active for around 3 months. our youth group had a camp back then that i cannot attend because we had no money for it. with that, i just felt shy going back to the group after since i thought i'd be left out. but afterwards, i was still attending maybe once a month or once every 2 months. pandemic happened, and i entered college already, so i wasnt able to attend at all for several years. but i'd still go to our church every week, but not the youth gathering.

i've been meaning to go, not because of him (okay maybe partly), but since i know that it is one of the reasons why i built a stronger connection with god.

fast forward to my 4th year in college (around november 2024), he suddenly started interacting with my ig stories and posts. he would reply or like them. there were several days he would message daily. he then invited me to a coffee pop up by his friend. i came, of course, but was there for only a few minutes because i had to meet my friends afterwards. and frankly because my body was shaking badly because hey that's my crush! and for some reason, after that day, the messages and interactions significantly lessened. i am honestly not sure what ive done, but it's fine for me. we would still interact with one another now and then but very limited.

fast forward to few months after (april 2025), there was another youth camp! this year, i really told myself that i should go already. i'm already 22 and is about to graduate college so i had to go to that camp. not because of him, but because i know i would get to know god deeper there. i'm scared that if i did not attend this year, i may not be eligible anymore in the coming years because im technically not a youth anymore lol. before signing up, i messaged him to ask if there were also first time camp attendees that are already in their 20s just like me. he validated me that yes there are, so that gave me the confidence to sign up. mind you, prior to this, we would still send each other random reels very seldom tho. he also invited me to go to the monthly coffee pop up by his friend too.

came camp, i had the best days of my life. on the last day, i came up to him to hug and tell him, ""thank you for not being a stranger all these years. let's push through with that coffee please"" he said sure. i also became more active in youth after this. i met new and wonderful friends! 

it has been months, and for some reason, he never sent any reel anymore and would often ignore mine. which btw was fine with me, i was never entitled to any response i know!! and i don't really want to be a burden.

almost end of july 2025, i saw in his ig note he wrote, ""should i ask her out?"" which may just confirm that he already has a special someone. don't get me wrong, i am very happy for him. i aspire nothing but his happiness. i just brushed it off. few days later, while casually scrolling through ig reels, i saw a post by a girl where she and him went out. hehe maybe she was the girl he was referring to in his ig note. upon further investigation, i learned that they were childhood friends. i also get why he may develop feelings for the girl— basing on her posts, she is very matured, intelligent, kind, god-fearing, and very pretty.

last sunday, i served in church taking pictures. he was there too. i greeted him happily and asked how he was. every thing should be normal. he is completely unaware of my feelings, and he is not responsible with me in any way. so i should really act casual. i was packing my things when he came to me, we had a short conversation. he even offered a ride to the cafe where the youth group would be hanging out after service, which i gladly agreed to. in the cafe, he sat next to me and we (along with other youth) had conversations and games. it was definitely fun. i accidentally glanced on his phone one time and saw that he was sending a photo to someone. i did not saw who it really was but saw that the icon was mostly white. when we got home, i saw that the icon kinda resembles the icon of the girl that posted the reel. this just confirmed to me more that they may be dating or talking already.

i know i do not have any right in this situation. i'm just a girl who has been secretly liking him lol. my friends told me several times already to confess my feelings for him. but i know for a fact that if that feelings are reciprocated, he would have told me already. but no, so i can confirm that this is all just me lol. and that's fine, i just have to find a way to move on already. god it has been more than 8 years ready. please don't get me wrong, i am truly happy for him if he ends up with the girl. they deserve each other, and actually they look like a perfect match.

i just need to ask for advice on how i should move on. i think this is harder that moving on from a relationship, because i know that there was nothing to begin with lol. at least when you end a relationship, you both know that you have to stay away from each other and that you tried yet things just doesn't work out. i just can't find a handbook that tells me ways on how i should move on from a guy in this situation lol. knowing for a fact that i would see him every week in church (non nego btw, i love my church and would not replace it just to move on from a guy haha)",1,1755615574.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

They all talk about how difficult it is to make friends. Agreed. It's harder. 

Somehow the effort starts within.

Not sure about you, but there are relationships in life that don't have proper closure. And the silence brings out the worst in a person. 

Not everything needs closure. Real closure comes from within. But at the same time, we need to be kind to ourselves for enduring all this shit. 

I am a social person who comes and shares my life on and around campus online. But I just want to congratulate and commend each person who has come forth with their struggles and honest opinions for enduring and seeing that the only way out is through all this. I firmly believe it will get better but we just need to brave the storms.

1mukr6k,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1mukr6k/explore_the_bodum_brazil_french_press_coffee/,Explore the Bodum Brazil French Press Coffee Maker Review Is It Worth It?,"The **Bodum 10948-01BUS Brazil French Press Coffee Maker** has become a staple on my kitchen counter. This compact, sleek French press is as much a conversation starter as it is an efficient coffee-making tool. After weeks of brewing, testing, and even a few mishaps (thanks to my clumsy mornings), I’m breaking down everything about this product.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The minute I unpacked the French press, its modern aesthetic caught my eye. It’s a fine balance of functionality and style. Made of heat-resistant borosilicate glass, the carafe feels sturdy yet lightweight, and it’s encased in a black BPA-free plastic body that not only looks elegant but also provides a good grip. The simplicity of the design is what stood out to me; there's a certain charm in its minimalism. However, I did notice that the plastic handle can feel a bit flimsy—fine for daily use but potentially questionable in durability over long-term use. 

**Ease of Use and Brewing Process**  
The step-by-step brewing couldn't be simpler. I dumped coarsely ground coffee in, added hot water, stirred a bit, waited patiently for four minutes, and plunged. Let me say this: the stainless steel plunger and mesh filter were absolute lifesavers in keeping all those sneaky coffee grounds at bay! Even my coffee-purist friend tried it and was impressed by how clean the brew came out. That said, it’s vital to use the correct coffee grind size; too fine, and you’ll find grounds in your coffee. I learned this lesson the hard way with my first brew.

**Check [Bodum 10948-01BUS Brazil French Press Coffee Maker] price on Amazon.**  

**Key Benefits**  
- The borosilicate glass carafe does not alter the coffee’s flavor, keeping it fresh and natural.  
- Environmentally friendly design—no need for paper filters or plastic pods.  
- The 12-ounce capacity makes brewing solo cups a breeze.  
- Dishwasher-safe components simplify cleanup after those groggy morning routines.

**Performance and Coffee Taste**  
It was impressive just how much flavor Bodum’s French press was able to pull out of my beans. I tested it with everything from single-origin grounds to generic grocery store blends, and the aroma and depth were consistent every time. There’s something inherently rewarding about the smooth, full-bodied result from a proper French press. Sure, the coffee cools faster than I’d like since there’s no insulation in the carafe, but I simply solved this by pre-heating my mug with some hot water.

**Limiting Factors**  
- The plastic lid and handle may not appeal to those seeking an all-metal or premium build.  
- Lack of carafe insulation means the coffee doesn’t stay hot for long.  
- Coffee grounds can sneak through if your grind isn’t adjusted correctly.  

**Cleaning and Maintenance**  
Cleaning the Bodum Brazil French press is probably the most convenient aspect of owning it. Everything disassembles easily for a quick rinse or a throw in the dishwasher. The stainless steel filter didn’t warp or lose its integrity even after frequent washes. However, cleaning finer coffee particles left behind required a bit more scrubbing than I anticipated.

**Alternative Products**  
If you’re considering this product, you might also look at options like the AeroPress or the Frieling French press. Compared to the AeroPress, which is better suited for portability and speedy brewing, the Bodum provides a more traditional full-flavored coffee experience. Meanwhile, the Frieling boasts a heavy-duty stainless steel build, but it’s double the cost, making the Bodum an attractive choice for budget-conscious coffee enthusiasts.

**Price Performance**  
For what it offers, this French press punches well above its price point. You might find fancier alternatives out there with higher-end finishes or additional features, but they also come at a steep cost. The affordability combined with its ability to deliver authentic coffee flavor makes it a great choice for both casual drinkers and more devoted aficionados. It feels like one of those rare finds where your expectations align perfectly with reality.

This new guy ( limited chatting beforehand again, but I had time this morning, so why not?) swore our first meet wouldn't just be a hi/bye. His exact words: ""It'll be more than that, enough for you to know if you'd want my lips on you in the future."" Spoiler: it wasn't.

So, morning comes, we meet at Dunkin. I walk in right after him. He's at the counter ordering donuts ""for his employees"" and a coffee for himself. In between talking to the cashier, he throws me a ""How are you?"" ""Long time no see"" ( to make it look like we are old acquaintances? ) Then asks if I'm drinking something. Not in a ""let me get it for you"" way, just flat. So I say ""not sure yet"" he pays and leaves me alone by the counter. With nothing better to do, I order latte and when I turn around, he's already by the door. When I join him, hoping we may sit down, he opens the door and while walking out, he asks ""So, do you want to talk more?"" I asked, ""Where? We're leaving the coffee place."" He goes, ""Well, I need to get to work but maybe we can meet later."" Later?"" | can't hide my annoyance ""Are you serious?
You're leaving?"" His response: ""I just wanted us to meet and get a feel for each other."" I told him:
""How can you 'get a feel for someone' while ordering donuts?"" He admitted ""fair,"" but doubled down on ""we can meet later."" I said no. If I'm taking the time to drive somewhere, l expect more than 30 seconds small talk.

And to be honest, the whole ""let's meet later"" thing felt more like a soft exit. So yeah, apparently the 4 minute date has a sequel.

So here’s the deal… I’m in Boulder, I want to be a pilot more than anything, and flight training isn’t exactly “wallet friendly.” Let’s be honest,flying a plane is expensive enough to make my credit card cry at night.

That said, I’m not here looking for handouts, I’m here looking for opportunities. If there’s anyone out there in the Boulder/Broomfield area or even further north Colorado who might be willing to mentor, trade, or let me help around in exchange for some flight hours (seriously, I’ll sweep hangar floors, wash planes, fetch coffee, chase geese off the runway—whatever it takes), I’m in.

I’m dead serious about aviation, it’s my passion, my future, and my dream career. I just need a little help breaking through that first financial wall to get more time in the sky.

So… if you’ve got a seat that needs a co-pilot, a plane that needs some TLC, or just need someone to clean bugs off the leading edge, hit me up. I’ll bring elbow grease, good energy, and maybe even snacks.

We ended up getting really close as we would hangout multiple times a week and we were super similar in many ways so I introduced her to my bsf who we will call Harmony (26f). We all got along great me and Kaylee would hangout all the time bc we lived pretty close to each other and harmony lives a little over an hour away so she would come hangout with us every now and then too! Everything was great! I was there when Kaylee got proposed to, when she found out she was pregnant and I officiated her wedding! Well things went south we learned that Kaylee was a hard core Christian republican who was heavily backing trump. Now for a little bit of context Harmony is a person of color and is also a part of the lgbtq community, Harmony and I are heavy liberals who often speak up about what we believe in and Kaylee is also about 7-8 months pregnant. Anyway this started to become a point of contention seeing as we all got close when the election was held. Kaylee was reposting things on tiktok in favor of trump and also making fun of democrats. I tried to ignore it for a while because other than our political differences we got along great and I really valued my friendship with both of them. Well then Kaylee starts reposting things along the lines of “homosexuality is a sin” and videos that are spreading that message. I messaged her and I just asked if that’s how she really feels , to which she tells me that yes she thinks being gay is a sin but she chooses not to be homophobic bc most things nowadays are a sin and technically she sins all the time too, which still left a weird taste in my mouth but I ended the conversation with letting her know that if she was homophobic/ against same sex marriage that I would not be okay with that. Well I then went to Harmony to talk to her about the conversation that me and Kaylee just had to get her perspective on things. And well I think that’s where I went wrong bc Harmony is someone who will very quickly act out of anger and not think twice about it, she’s a bit of a hothead and speaks very passionately which can sometimes also come off as aggressive. Welp after I got off the phone she then goes and sends Kaylee about 10 or more videos about how she thinks Kaylee is a racist for voting for trump and that she doesn’t really care about me because my mom and her family is from Vietnam and even though I look white I am not and this could affect my family and she’s a horrible person for voting this way, she also tells Kaylee that she must be homophobic and there’s a lot more but I never have seen this video so I really don’t know the rest of what was said. However Harmony was the one who told me that she did that so obviously I know she said all these things. Now I don’t necessarily disagree with everything she said but I don’t agree with the way she went about it and how she took our private conversation and then went and told the person we were talking about everything that was said. After she told me she said all of this I messaged Kaylee and let her know that I don’t agree with how Harmony went about things and we both agreed it would be better for us to step away from the friendship with everything that happened. Now this was all back in march, we didn’t talk for months after that. Well fast forward to June and she messages me saying how she really misses our friendship and she doesn’t want what happened with Harmony to get in the way of how close we were. I took a day or two to think about how I wanted to respond and I let her know that it really wasn’t about what happened with Harmony for me, I told her that I just couldn’t surround myself with people who support this current administration while I’m sat here worried about my family getting deported or sent to a detention center (my family is here legally but we all know that hasn’t stopped ice recently) on top of all of the other horrible things that this current administration has done like trying to limit women’s reproductive rights, defunding cancer research, etc. Kaylee says that she has really changed her views since having her daughter and although she still identifies as a republican she doesn’t stand with trump and everything he has done/ is doing. We met up for coffee, talked about things and we have been hanging out pretty regularly again. I really do feel like she has changed and become a better person. Well this whole time I did not tell Harmony about me reconnecting with Kaylee bc I knew she wouldn’t be happy about it. It’s been 2 months now and I have been terrified to tell her but I’m getting married next year and I want them both to be there for all of the things that come along with getting married so I figured it was time to tell Harmony. I started by telling her that Kaylee had texted me a few weeks ago and I read her the messages. Harmony immediately starts saying how I would be stupid to be her friend again bc she never cared about me other wise she would have never voted the way she did and that she’s a homophobic racist and i should never forgive her for that because having a baby doesn’t instantly change you, I told her I planned to meet up with Karli to talk about things to which she again says I am stupid for that and that it’s impossible for Kaylee to change. But I know people can change, I have watched myself grow into a better person and I have watch both Harmony and Kaylee grow into better people. I just want to be able to tell Harmony that me and Kaylee are friends again and not be attacked for it. They are both very important to me and I understand that they will not be friends again but I just want to be able to have them in the same room and things be civil and not affect my friendship with either of them. Any advice on the situation is greatly appreciated bc I really don’t know if I’m wrong for reconnecting with Kaylee and mending our friendship. ",2,1755614860.0,AITAH,10,0.67,False

I always liked the idea of home espresso and happened to find a good machine for cheap so I began my decent into the rabbit hole 

Machine is a thrifted Capresso Cafe Pro for $20. Just needed a couple rounds of descaling.

Grinder is a Shardor bd-cg018 that was thrifted for $6. It works well enough for medium roasts but it struggles with the lighter roast pictured so I may try shimming it. I initially bought a Timemore Chestnut C3 ESP but realized very quickly that 20g of hand grinding daily sucks.

Upgraded the basket to the 51mm Leverpresso 20g basket for $17.

The tamper, WDT, puck screens, dosing funnel, pitcher, and glasses are all Amazon finds and work well enough.

My SIL and I have a good relationship but aren’t close at all and couldn’t be more different in personality, lifestyle, interests, and aesthetics. We have never spent one on one time with each other as she has a very large group of friends, a lot of which she has known since childhood and sees all the time. I have maybe 3 close friends on a good day. She’s extremely social, outgoing, and active and I am so much more reserved and Introverted. Nevertheless we’ve always gotten along very well when we’re together with the family (my partner, their mom, and my SIL’s partner). SIL is now pregnant, due soon, and my partner is wildly excited about becoming an uncle even though they also don’t seem as close as maybe other siblings. Great relationship but she just seems to have her own life outside of her brother and myself. I’m also excited to become an aunt but feel extremely self conscious about this title and what it means. All her friends are already calling themselves aunts and uncles (which is fair because they’re so close) but I almost feel like I’m not even deserving of this title since we’re not close. I feel weird telling my own friends I’m becoming an aunt because what does that even mean if other people are going to be so much more involved in the child’s life? It feels weird to try and ask her to go for coffee after 5 years because a) she’s never made the effort to get to know me more and b) we are just such different people (which is totally fine). 
I’m honestly not even sure what I’m asking for here. Maybe perspective? Has anyone else experienced this? Family issues just hit very close to home for me because, even though I technically have 7 half siblings, I am not in contact with any of them for various reasons. I have a step father who I’ve gone no contact with 10 years ago due to abuse and a bio dad who lives across the Atlantic. My mother and I maybe talk a few times a year. My partner’s father passed away long before we met and he only has one sister. I feel like I just got the shit end of the stick when it comes to familial ties and I can’t help but feel sad about potentially not being as involved in my nephew’s life because I always wanted to have close family relationships.

I recently went on a ""Metahuman Biohacking"" reading kick, devouring any book I could find on the subject. I read it all - Dave Asprey, Tim Ferriss, Peter Attia, Daniel Amen, Wim Hof, even Kevin Trudeau. With all of the stories about metahumans in the news, especially around my 40th birthday, it made me feel really insecure about myself and my body. Seeing the Flash on Joe Rogan's podcast didn't help. 

I really thought, if they can do it so can I. Sure, some purport to be from another planet or descended from the gods or something like that, but we've seen all kinds of people doing extraordinary things lately. Luckily there were books, paid courses, and even in-person symposiums that told me, in no uncertain terms, that I could biohack my way to becoming a superhero.

I won't go into every detail, but I'd like to share my thoughts about everything I've wasted my money on, and help others from making the same mistake. 

First, the good: Obviously exercising, cutting carbs, increasing protein, and severely cutting back on alcohol have done wonders for my physical and mental health. I've found new hobbies in various brain games, and I can tell my mind is sharper for it. 

Then, there's the bad: The obvious complaint from most people is that this is information that can be found elsewhere for free, and it's not rocket science. This skips over the biggest issue - it doesn't work. At least, not in the way that it says on the tin. I did not gain superpowers. My strength is up, but not nearly coming close to top tier humans, let alone metahumans. ""Microdosing lightning"" whilst taking a cocktail of supplements didn't give me super speed. I'm at the very least proud of myself for never thinking that bulletproof coffee would actually make me bulletproof (I'm sure you heard about the Darwyn Award winner who wasn't as incredulous).

After reading all of the books I paid for a course, and then another. I then traveled to Coast City for a convention where multiple biohacking influencers were speaking. It was there that I had an epiphany - no one here is displaying superpowers. The guys on stage say it's possible, but they aren't floating down from the rafters to make a grand entrance. 

These guys are making bank, and yet aren't even using their wealth to create tech that would turn them into superheroes. That was never the goal. The goal was to play on the insecurities of middle aged men seeing Superman fly into action and save the world and thinking, ""why isn't that me?""

Today I threw it all away - the books, the supplements, even the bracelet that purported to turn my body elastic. I find it ironic that the confidence I gained from focusing on my health became what gave me the skills necessary to question what inspired me to get healthy in the first place.

Here is a short section from the opening chapter of a story I am working on. Any tips or advice would be great!

Thank you 

-

Jack Harris slid out a chewed up toothpick from between his rough gums and began scraping away the dirt from underneath his fingernails. Done scraping, he held the toothpick about an inch from his good eye and smiled. Happy with his work, he rolled the black end of the toothpick between his index finger and thumb, and wiped the stain on his trouser leg. He pushed the toothpick back between his gums, rocked back in his chair, and propped his feet on the shop counter. Jack interlocked his fingers and rested them on his soft, round belly. He was at peace.

After a while of doing nothing, Jack stretched his arms towards the grey ceiling tiles and inhaled the stale air of the petrol station through his nose. He reached his left arm around the top of his head, feeling his thinning, oily hair under the back of his elbow. Then, he hooked his fingers underneath his jawbone and cracked his neck into place. In the pit of his bad eye, Jack scratched away the tired orange grit that had formed, pushing his thin cheekbones towards his temples as he did.

“Time for a smoke,” he said, reaching between his legs, fishing out a yellow plastic packet of tobacco. He knew he wasn’t supposed to smoke inside the petrol station - the boss had told him twice before. But he didn’t care what the boss had to say. He pinched the packet between his fingers and thumbs, then snapped open the plastic thread that held it together. Next, he pushed his rough tanned hand into the warm mound of tobacco and felt around for the buried rolling paper and filter tips. After retrieving the papers and filters, he shaped an empty canoe for the tobacco, and sprinkled in a coarse pinch of straggly brown addiction. After discarding the toothpick with his free hand, Jack rolled his thin bottom lip under his top teeth and squeezed in his cheeks to wet his tongue. He pinched the filter tip carefully and brought the cigarette to his mouth, licking along the paper with his grey tongue, sealing it like a tight envelope. 

With the cigarette perfectly balanced between his lips, Jack reached into his trouser pocket and brought out a cheap, translucent green lighter along with a ball of lint. Flicking the flint wheel was almost as satisfying as the act of smoking itself. But only almost, for Jack loved the silent rush of pleasure that expanded in his lungs and crept through his red-skinned nostrils. He took a large drag of the cigarette, watching it glow with his good eye before removing it with his middle and index fingers. His right arm dropped gently to his side, the cigarette swinging in his hand like a lazy bell.

“Better pass me that newspaper,” Jack mumbled, lifting his right arm and pressing the cigarette back into his lips. He leaned forward and fingered the corner of the newspaper along the shop counter towards himself, the chair squeaking as he did. He smiled at his quiet success, gripping the newspaper’s delicate edges between his hands as he leaned back into the chair. “Shit,” he said, jolting as a thumb of ash fell from his cigarette onto the wrinkled pages, flecks of ash rolling down its inner spine. He picked up the newspaper and shook the ash onto his lap. “Now then,” he said, settling comfortably in his chair and shifting his feet on the counter, “let’s see what she’s got for us t’day”.
 
Jack held up the newspaper and spread its wings. He inspected the ads section closely. Used cars, used golf clubs, used drum kits, and used prams. Jack sighed through his teeth, shaking his head at the price of a used diesel car, a little more ash falling from his cigarette as he did. He coughed and turned the page. “Must be somet’ worth buyin’” he said to himself. More ash from the cigarette floated onto his lap as he continued to shake his head. He turned the page again, but it was no good. He or the newspaper simply could not come up with an agreement on the appropriate pricing of things. “Failed me today, Sarah” he muttered, turning to the deaths section. “Go on then, love. Let's ave a laugh,”. He made sure to pay close attention to each and every name. There’s something therapeutic when it comes to the deaths section, Jack’s subconscious murmured. After reading closely for a while, he looked up from the newspaper and out through the smeared petrol station window. For a moment, he looked solemn as he gazed at the yellow sun. For a moment, he looked deep in thought. “You’ll ave to try ‘arder next week if you want t’ see me in ere” he laughed to himself, mocking He who saved the Israelites from the Egyptians.

The filter of the cigarette tip had turned into a dark orange. Jack pulled it from his lips and flicked it toward the sand bin behind the shop counter. He missed, but didn’t care. Cleaner’ll get that, he thought. The cigarette butt lay lifeless next to its fallen comrades – some of them orange, some of them brown, some of them with their heads squashed down flat. Jack set down the newspaper on his lap and began to roll another. As he did, he felt the rumble of a passing truck glide past the petrol station. “Trucks on a Sunday” he mumbled, realising he had been using his bad eye to fill the paper bullet, and in the process, had spilled some tobacco onto the newspaper’s front cover. 

When he finished licking the cigarette paper’s edge, he held it in his lips and dropped the newspaper to the grey tiled floor. Better grab a coffee, he thought, and pushed his hands into the arms of the chair because his right leg had gone static and he knew getting up would take some effort. After his leg went from static to full definition, he swung the chair around and placed his hands on his knees. Standing, he let out a habitual sigh – the same sigh older people let out when he was young – and straightened up. Jack leaned over the counter and took a handful of change from the pay-it-forward tin. Then, he hobbled to the coffee machine on the other side of the counter and loaded it with second-hand coins. The machine buzzed and whirred, spluttered and steamed, and finally spat out an Americano. “Thanks, folks” Jack grinned, tilting the cardboard coffee cup to the pay-it-forward tin, knowing in his brain that he deserved the spare change more than anyone. Knowing in his heart that He who saved the Israelites was probably glaring at him through the clouds. Proudly smiling at the coffee cup, he brought it to his lips and took a sip, staining his grey tongue brown.

Leaning on an empty shelf, Jack looked across at the upright, hollow fridges along the far side of the petrol station. They used to be full, but the boss stopped refilling them to cut down costs. Once they held sandwiches, drinks, ready meals, eggs, butter, and milk. But the boss didn’t see much point anymore. He rested his hand on the empty metal shelf where crisps and chocolate bars used to shine, and looked out of the front door. Only money’s in petrol and diesel” the boss had said. Only money’s in your pocket, Jack thought. 

An hour later, Jack was back in his chair, flicking through magazines and listening to an FM radio he’d hidden under the counter, “we can’t have a radio because I aren’t paying for the licence” the boss had told him – three times. His good eye was busy focusing on a story about a woman whose cat had been kidnapped. His bad eye, mute, couldn’t get its words out and tell Jack that someone had pulled into the petrol station forecourt. You better tell him to put that cigarette out, else he’ll get in trouble, said the bad eye to the good eye – but the good eye was too busy to listen to its backward brother. 

Jack was singing along – loudly, as he always did – to Needles and Pins by The Searchers when the buzzer signalled that pump number three was trying to be used. “Shit, shit!” Jack exclaimed, throwing another fallen comrade to the sand bin and wafting his arms around in the air to dispel the smell. “Shit!” He grabbed a can of air freshener from the shelf and locked his finger on the trigger as he hit the button to activate pump number three. “We don’t need any air freshener; the cleaner brings her own” the boss had said three times this month. Not now! Jack thought.

1mukcqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mukcqv/aitah_for_going_non_contact_after_my_ex/,AITAH for going non contact after my ex threatened to harm himself over our breakup?,"AITAH for going no contact after my ex threatened to harm himself after our break up?

Let me give a bit of background here before you judge me.

My ex seemed to be the picture perfect boyfriend.  We initially met online through a mutual friend while I was still in a previous relationship. 

The ex in question, let's call him James, said he found talking to me incredibly easy and was surprised because he stated he had a lot of trouble speaking to women.

We would chat casually often about life, work, anime, cosplay etc. My bf at the time, Mike was rarely home as we worked opposite shifts and our relationship was on the rocks due to issues with his mother hating me for *stealing her only son*. James would tell me I deserved better and gave me the confidence to break out of the relationship which had grown toxic.

Really this should have been one of the first red flags.... he knew I as not single but would compliment,  flirt and tell me how much he wished I was single so he could show me a real loving relationship.... idiot I am i believed him. 

I packed my things and moved out after breaking it off with Mike, and that's when James made his move. There was a large local anime convention I would be attending in my town and James just so happened to be coming to it. 

We decided to meet up and have dinner with some of my friends. He was such a gentleman the entire time, opening doors for me, complimenting me, offering to pay for the meal....the works.

A few weeks later he asked me out officially and I said yes... and this was when everything went to hell in a handbasket.

He began love bombing constantly,  gas lighting me, trying to convince me I'd never known love like his, promising to marry me, stating that I was a true catch Mike was a fool for letting me go. He wanted me to meet his parents, to try and move in with him.... all this within 2 months of us dating.... it was overwhelming... but also a boost as my relationship with Mike had been hard, full of shouting matches, constantly feeling put down by his mum and uncertain that I was someone who deserved love.

I let James pamper me, his love bombing was exactly what I wanted to have after the years with Mike.  But then came the gas lighting.... he'd not call when he said he would or would leave me on read for days at a time and when I'd ask him if everything was OK hed say I was overreacting or being emotional.   When I was upset about Mike taking me off the adoption papers of the dog we got together, James said that was a stupid thing to be upset about as he was just a dumb dog.  In the bedroom... James would experience some... troubles, and would tell me it was my fault for not trying hard enough, doing enough, fluffing enough etc to get him going. He told me if I lost a few pounds I could get into some better positions for him...it was hurtful but I really thought we had something so I would starve myself trying to fit the standard he wanted. He did not like my friends, at all...period. and he would often tell me that they would message him saying I was too good for him, or cussing him out, and that he was being the bigger man telling me and not just breaking up with me due to *drama*.

Most of this is would find out later was untrue... but he was so charismatic and so charming I fell for every bit he would use. I only became weary when he told me my best friend since childhood had come on to him. She's married with a child and honestly she's not that kind of person at all. I told him he must have misunderstood and he flew into a rage telling me I was an idiot for not believing him and for trusting her blindly. 

I let it slide, didn't let it pull me away from her, let's call her Doreen. I was often at Doreens with her and her husband when James would call. Doreen began to tell me the way he would speak to me was passive aggressive and demeaning but I was too blind to see it at this stage.

A few more months came and went, and James was due to visit again. He was meant to pick me up from Doreen place before we would venture off. He was 6 hours late.... no explanation,  no apologies,  did not message me to let me know. I'd spent the night crying assuming he'd been in accident or worse.... when he did show up and Doreen asked why he'd been so late with no explanation he just told her to shut up and it wasn't her business. 

We left, headed out but Doreen demanded I keep her posted and her hubby would get me if needed.  I said it was fine and left... the explanation I got was simply that James lost track of tine and left his city a bit later then expected and he didn't feel he had to tell me.

This hurt, but again I stupidly let it slide.

As time wore on I got so numb to the abuse I could easily overlook things that should have raised alarm bells... like when James introduced me to his friend, Alina.  He told me she was in my city and needed a friend and asked if I could hang with her. I thought nothing of it and said sure... a few weeks after I met up with Alina and she seemed nice enough.... but very very young and very very eager for something. For context myself and James were both 32 at the time, Alina was 20 

James also thought himself to be a *photographer* he liked cosplay a lot and would offer newer cosplauers free photoshoots... which was how he had met Alina.  i thought it was super nice until I asked to see some of the photos and was told I *couldn't appreciate them* Despite b3ing a cosplayer and photographer myself. I was never allowed to be present for his photoshoots either, he said I'd be a distraction despite a couple of years of modeling myself and offering to help with poses.

A little bit of time passed with the 3 of us chatting and occasionally hanging out. Then in march of that year I was meeting with friends for a reunion trip. I'd asked James if he wanted to come but he reminded me he and those frirnds did not get on. Then he said rather cryptically that he might visit my city while I was away. When I asked why he'd do that he told me I was being incredibly nosey and to just go have fun 

He didn't speak to me or message me for the entirety of my trip.... no contact 3 days. I was so scared he'd been in an accident, or he was sick or dead i asked one of our mutual friends who was local to him to check in. I felt numb when he told me James waent home and his car was nowhere to be seen.

When I got back and was furious he said he decided to just go fishing and hadn't had signal.

A month later Alina asked me out for coffee...  and proceeded to destroy my entire world.

She told me the fishing trip had been a lie, James had come to visit her and take her virginity,  and he paid handsomely for it too apparently,  he'd just sold his house and id wondered where 29k had vanished so quickly. Here was my answer.

Not only that she showed me a document she had been sent by someone else he'd been in contact with someone even younger.... an 18 year old... they were messages of a very very sexual manner. Alina told me James was known for chasing young girls, he would purchase sexy cosplay photos of young girls, some even younger than 18 and he was using me as a scapegoat to show he was *a decent guy*. She apologized to me too, saying that he had said I was ok with them sleeping together but after I'd confided in her about his no contact fishing trip she realized it was not all on the up and up. 

I told her I was thankful she'd told me... but that this was not something I could forgive. Went home, burned everything James had ever given me and then called him to break up.

He began crying on the call when I confronted him, saying he was weak,that Alina came on to him,that he was so in love with me, we should get eloped and have a baby.... when I told him about the document from the other girl, the accusations of potential CP he threatened to kill himself if I didn't take him back and forget what I'd been told or seen. He said he was a weak man but I made him stronger and better.  I wasn't falling for it again.


From that day I have been no contact. I have him blocked everywhere. This all happened in 2019/2020.... i was thankful for lockdown as it meant he couldn't come to my house....which he threatened to do on socials numerous times. My friends kept tabs on him to warn me if he ever acted. He never did thankfully.

He did however, cyber stalk me. 
 He created different profiles on Instagram, Facebook and even on an online game we had played together to try and contact me, to plead his case... he even messaged me from his mom's phone telling me she was dieing of cancer how could I be so heartless not to speak with him or take him back.

Am I the ass hole for never giving him, or myself closure? I have felt somewhat guilty for this all these years.... is it merited or misplaced.",1,1755614452.0,AITAH,4,0.67,False

People like me were actually getting more shit done at home. No useless fake office culture, no waking up 3 hours early just to fight traffic, no manager breathing down my neck just to make sure my ass is in a chair. We were delivering results while being healthier and happier.

Then the influencer plague showed up. These braindead clout chasing parasites decided remote work was an “aesthetic.” They flooded TikTok and Instagram with their fake “work from anywhere” bullshit. Two emails in the morning then it’s six hours of posing with laptops by a pool in Bali or pretending they’re hustling from a coffee shop. None of them actually working. Just flexing for views. Pieces of shit.

And of course companies saw that shit. Instead of realizing most of us were doing our jobs better than ever, they swallowed the influencer image whole. Suddenly remote work is lazy assholes making content instead of working. So what did they do? They ripped it away from everyone. Now we’re stuck in traffic again, losing hours of our lives, just because some dopamine addicted TikTok zombie couldn’t stop filming themselves pretending to work.

So yeah I blame influencers. I hope their ring lights explode in their faces, I hope their follower counts crater. I hope every single one of them ends up trapped in an open office next to the loudest obnoxious coworker on Earth. They ruined one of the best things to ever happen to the workforce and I’ll never forgive them.

I will forever hate influencers. Fuck you

Booked the exam months ago, pretended it didn’t exist, and now reality has punched me in the face, my CFA Level 1 exam is on the 25th of August and I haven’t even touched the readings.

After a few hours of denial and existential crisis, I’ve decided that I’ve got no option but to attempt the last-minute marathon. No support system here (can’t tell anyone, or I’ll get 500 lectures), so I figured I’ll just dump my updates here and hope someone out there has been this dumb and still survived.

Background: Finance undergrad, so I’m not coming in 100% blind. Obviously, I don’t expect top percentile. Just aiming for that sweet, sweet “pass.”

Plan (aka damage control):

Aug 19–20: Ethics, Portfolio and FRA

Aug 21: Equity + Derivates

Aug 22: Fixed Income + Econ

Aug 23: CI + quants

Aug 24: remaining quants + Alt. Inv. 

Aug 25: Pray and exam


Study method:

12–14 hrs a day, coffee on drip, phone on airplane mode, sleep at least 6 hrs so my brain doesn’t melt mid-exam.

I know this is a stupid way to approach CFA. But hey, this is where I’m at. Any last-minute tips from people who pulled this off? Did anyone actually survive this kind of sprint? I'm still optimistic enough that I could be the trendsetter T_T

Wish me luck, I’ll need it. P.s. advices would be appreciated.

I thought I’d feel better, but waking up I still feel sick realizing he’s gone. My stomach and my whole body aches, I just miss him so much. And it’s only the fourth day. There’s just so much what ifs but I try to comfort myself that he’s no longer in pain and that I spent some time with him the day and night before he passed, he also passed peacefully with us at home. I was asleep when he passed but I honestly wish I was there right next to him, I was way too hopeful at night that he would still be here the next day, but I was wrong.

Oreo was such a sweet boy, even when he was lethargic he scooted closer to me when I laid beside him on the floor to cuddle with him, this was a day before his passing. Also the day before this, he was in the kitchen weak, later I came back and I saw he wasn’t in the kitchen anymore, he was laying on the coffee table in the living room, he literally hopped all the way there and then hopped onto the couch to get on the coffee table, but he was laying there tired. Oreo was also close with my mom, there were times even when he wasn’t sick yet he would hop on the couch near my mom and chill beside her, and even times when my mom was at work he would go near the couch and stand on his hind legs and kinda look over it, and then sometimes would hop on and stay on her spot. He also did this when he was sick. I feel so guilty that we went to the vet after his little body couldn’t handle it anymore, we did the best we can, even after two vet visits, the next morning I woke up to the news that he passed, so I went to the living room and saw his little body lifeless lying flat slightly on his side, he looked peaceful and I’m glad we spent some time with him the night before and that we were all at home during his last days. I will miss his little quirks, and miss seeing him in his usual spots. Oreo will be in my heart forever ❤️ And when the time comes that we get another rabbit, I will introduce him as Oreo’s brother. But I still hope Oreo’s presence is somewhat still in this house and that I will get to meet him again somehow. 🤍☁️",1,1755614318.0,u_Ok-Thought1052,0,1.0,False

I [22F] like this guy [25m] from our church since 2017. He was my light group head back then. Fell for him because, for some reason, he just knows the right things to say. he became an image of god for me here on earth.

I started going to our youth gathering in January 2017. However, i was only active for around 3 months. our youth group had a camp back then that i cannot attend because we had no money for it. with that, i just felt shy going back to the group after since i thought i'd be left out. but afterwards, i was still attending maybe once a month or once every 2 months. pandemic happened, and i entered college already, so i wasnt able to attend at all for several years. but i'd still go to our church every week, but not the youth gathering.

i've been meaning to go, not because of him (okay maybe partly), but since i know that it is one of the reasons why i built a stronger connection with god.

fast forward to my 4th year in college (around november 2024), he suddenly started interacting with my ig stories and posts. he would reply or like them. there were several days he would message daily. he then invited me to a coffee pop up by his friend. i came, of course, but was there for only a few minutes because i had to meet my friends afterwards. and frankly because my body was shaking badly because hey that's my crush! and for some reason, after that day, the messages and interactions significantly lessened. i am honestly not sure what ive done, but it's fine for me. we would still interact with one another now and then but very limited.

fast forward to few months after (april 2025), there was another youth camp! this year, i really told myself that i should go already. i'm already 22 and is about to graduate college so i had to go to that camp. not because of him, but because i know i would get to know god deeper there. i'm scared that if i did not attend this year, i may not be eligible anymore in the coming years because im technically not a youth anymore lol. before signing up, i messaged him to ask if there were also first time camp attendees that are already in their 20s just like me. he validated me that yes there are, so that gave me the confidence to sign up. mind you, prior to this, we would still send each other random reels very seldom tho. he also invited me to go to the monthly coffee pop up by his friend too.

came camp, i had the best days of my life. on the last day, i came up to him to hug and tell him, ""thank you for not being a stranger all these years. let's push through with that coffee please"" he said sure.

it has been months, and for some reason, he never sent any reel anymore and would often ignore mine. which btw was fine with me, i was never entitled to any response i know!! and i don't really want to be a burden.

almost end of july 2025, i saw in his ig note he wrote, ""should i ask her out?"" which may just confirm that he already has a special someone. don't get me wrong, i am very happy for him. i aspire nothing but his happiness. i just brushed it off. few days later, while casually scrolling through ig reels, i saw a post by a girl where she and him went out. hehe maybe she was the girl he was referring to in his ig note. upon further investigation, i learned that they were childhood friends. i also get why he may develop feelings for the girl— basing on her posts, she is very matured, intelligent, kind, god-fearing, and very pretty.

last sunday, i served in church taking pictures. he was there too. i greeted him happily and asked how he was. every thing should be normal. he is completely unaware of my feelings, and he is not responsible with me in any way. so i should really act casual. i was packing my things when he came to me, we had a short conversation. he even offered a ride to the cafe where the youth group would be hanging out after service, which i gladly agreed to. in the cafe, he sat next to me and we (along with other youth) had conversations and games. it was definitely fun. i accidentally glanced on his phone one time and saw that he was sending a photo to someone. i did not saw who it really was but saw that the icon was mostly white. when we got home, i saw that the icon kinda resembles the icon of the girl that posted the reel. this just confirmed to me more that they may be dating or talking already.

i know i do not have any right in this situation. i'm just a girl who has been secretly liking him lol. my friends told me several times already to confess my feelings for him. but i know for a fact that if that feelings are reciprocated, he would have told me already. but no, so i can confirm that this is all just me lol. and that's fine, i just have to find a way to move on already. god it has been more than 8 years ready. please don't get me wrong, i am truly happy for him if he ends up with the girl. they deserve each other, and actually they look like a perfect match.

I [22F] like this guy [25m] from our church since 2017. He was my light group head back then. Fell for him because, for some reason, he just knows the right things to say. he became an image of god for me here on earth.

I started going to our youth gathering in January 2017. However, i was only active for around 3 months. our youth group had a camp back then that i cannot attend because we had no money for it. with that, i just felt shy going back to the group after since i thought i'd be left out. but afterwards, i was still attending maybe once a month or once every 2 months. pandemic happened, and i entered college already, so i wasnt able to attend at all for several years. but i'd still go to our church every week, but not the youth gathering.

i've been meaning to go, not because of him (okay maybe partly), but since i know that it is one of the reasons why i built a stronger connection with god.

fast forward to my 4th year in college (around november 2024), he suddenly started interacting with my ig stories and posts. he would reply or like them. there were several days he would message daily. he then invited me to a coffee pop up by his friend. i came, of course, but was there for only a few minutes because i had to meet my friends afterwards. and frankly because my body was shaking badly because hey that's my crush! and for some reason, after that day, the messages and interactions significantly lessened. i am honestly not sure what ive done, but it's fine for me. we would still interact with one another now and then but very limited.

fast forward to few months after (april 2025), there was another youth camp! this year, i really told myself that i should go already. i'm already 22 and is about to graduate college so i had to go to that camp. not because of him, but because i know i would get to know god deeper there. i'm scared that if i did not attend this year, i may not be eligible anymore in the coming years because im technically not a youth anymore lol. before signing up, i messaged him to ask if there were also first time camp attendees that are already in their 20s just like me. he validated me that yes there are, so that gave me the confidence to sign up. mind you, prior to this, we would still send each other random reels very seldom tho. he also invited me to go to the monthly coffee pop up by his friend too.

came camp, i had the best days of my life. on the last day, i came up to him to hug and tell him, ""thank you for not being a stranger all these years. let's push through with that coffee please"" he said sure.

it has been months, and for some reason, he never sent any reel anymore and would often ignore mine. which btw was fine with me, i was never entitled to any response i know!! and i don't really want to be a burden.

almost end of july 2025, i saw in his ig note he wrote, ""should i ask her out?"" which may just confirm that he already has a special someone. don't get me wrong, i am very happy for him. i aspire nothing but his happiness. i just brushed it off. few days later, while casually scrolling through ig reels, i saw a post by a girl where she and him went out. hehe maybe she was the girl he was referring to in his ig note. upon further investigation, i learned that they were childhood friends. i also get why he may develop feelings for the girl— basing on her posts, she is very matured, intelligent, kind, god-fearing, and very pretty.

Despite all of my flaws, I still like to think of myself as a somewhat okay human being. 
Which is why I’ve taken up the torch and decided to help Kurt through his issues. 

Ever since we hid Hershel’s decayed corpse, he just hasn’t been the same. 

If I try, I can kind of understand why— it’s not every day you see a dead guy up and vibing— but I’d really thought that he’d be better after his time off. (He just sorta left for a bit, after we found Hershel in the lobby.) 

Maybe it’s not just the Hershel thing. Maybe it’s the long hours and the smells getting to him too. (Or maybe, it’s because we’re over worked and given shit pay.) Either way, the poor guy doesn’t seem to be getting enough sleep. 

He keeps zoning out, and at first it was kinda fun (I was able to get almost all of the pens from the pen cup, plus a few paper clips, into his fro without him so much as twitching!), but after a few too many complaints about charred food from the customers, I had to take him off of grill duty. 

So I’ve started a list of things that have and haven’t made him snap out of it. This is what I’ve tried:

1. A stick— didn’t work. It just sat in front of him on the table he was supposed to be wiping down, and honestly, I don’t think he even noticed it. 

2. Tea— also didn’t work. Same situation as the stick. It just sat on the table in front of him and got cold. 

3. A rock from the parking lot— worked! I tried handing it to him, and he did the thing that people do without realizing when you hand them things. He took it from me, and I think the presence of something in his hand is what snapped him out of it. 

4. A tea bag— I lost the rock, and this was the next best thing. It worked pretty well, and unlike the rock, he held onto it while he cleaned. And he didn’t zone out for a good few hours afterwards. 

And that’s the end of my list so far. I think I’m just gonna keep using the rocks and tea to keep him from zoinking out of reality, but I’m not so sure if it’s a fool proof plan. 

Mrs. Warmly came in and recommended that I give him a bottle of some of the “good stuff” and a cigar, as that was what she used to give her husband whenever he was upset. 

I just gave her what she ordered, and politely informed her that Kurt and I weren’t married, but I’d give it a try. She then payed for her drink and gave me a fist-full of candy , before going on her way. 

The candy tasted like steak, and I ate almost all of them during lunch today. I have no regrets. They were delicious. 

I’ve gotten off topic– other than helping Kurt, I’ve been trying to keep record of the interesting stuff that goes on here. Things can get a bit hectic, and with my squishy little brain, I forget a lot of the stuff that I’d like to tell y’all about. So I’ve been keeping records of it all– mostly on napkins, but  sometimes on receipt paper. 
And it’s been going pretty well, if I say so myself. Because, I’d almost completely forgotten about Skeeter and that group that came in at the ass crack of dawn. But I remembered it when I found my collection of napkins with the records of the events in my pocket!

Skeeter came in first, at around 5:00. 

He’s been doing this for the past few weeks— coming in before the sun comes up, ordering a single cup of black coffee, and badgering us about the local deer population. It’s like a weird little ritual. He does his whole thing, and in return, we tell him that we haven’t seen shit. And he finishes his coffee and leaves. 

That’s what the owners told us to do via letter too. (It’s their main way of communicating with us. They’re not very big fans of technology, but surprisingly, they’re not Amish.) “We’re not, under any circumstances, allowed to say that we’ve seen *any* deer at, near, or around the diner.” We weren’t really told why, but it didn’t seem like too much of an issue. So we just sorta accepted it as like, a general rule. 

Don’t say shit, and things will (probably) be okay.

But lucky for me, I got to see what happens when someone says shit. 

It was a group of four— one girl and three boys. They came in a few seconds after Skeeter and ordered thirteen sunny side specials and one black coffee. 

That’s when it began.

I thought they were fucking with me, but no. They actually wanted me to make them thirteen. Fucking sunny. Side. Specials. 

I feel I should tell y’all what all the “sunny side special” includes:

Four eggs, two waffles, four sausage patties, a side of grits or hash browns, and a drink of the customer’s choosing. 

Another thing I feel y’all should know: I was the only one there. (Kurt doesn’t usually work the late shifts, and Hershel wasn’t set to come till 10:30.) I had to make thirteen of those by myself and bring them to the table. 

As annoying as that was, though, I can’t say I blame them. Our shit’s cheap, and they looked to be fresh out of highscool. I know that when *I* was just starting out, cheap places were my vibe. (Hell, that’s part of the reason I got this job!)

I’d just finished placing the last plate down and was about to leave their booth, when one of the boys grabbed my wrist. 

He was the scrawnier one of the group and really gave off the whole “nerd” vibe. That’s not to say he wasn’t serving with it. Cause he definitely made it work— glasses and all. He just looked, and don’t judge me on this, weak. But his grip said otherwise. (Seriously, it could put a fucking python to shame!)

So I was mid way through calculating whether or not I could handle him without anything, when the guy next to him quickly pried his hand off of me. 

“Sorry about that. We hit a deer on the way here, and it upset him a bit. A sensitive guy, this one.” He said with a voice that was as smooth as molasses.

 Like, strait up, he’d’ve made a really good podcast host.  The only problem was that he said all of that with this huge fucked up smile. No one wants to see that many teeth in the media. I’m pretty sure you’d get made fun of for that type of shit. It was like looking at a pissed off chimp with the voice of Morgan Freeman. 

But the poor smooth-voiced bastard, unknowingly, fucked up. You see, at the mere mention of the word “deer,” Skeeter was already out of his seat and making his way over. And before I could give the group my condolences, he was there.

“What was that bout deer?” He asked as he pushed his way past me. 

“Oh, hello there. We were just discussing how we hit one on the way here. Did you also–“ The guy started, but was quickly cut off by Skeeter.

“Where.”

“What?”

He was laser focused on the group as he asked, “Where was the deer?”

I didn’t quite think it was possible, but as the smooth guy responded, his smile somehow got wider. “Just…up the road… Would you like to see?” And without an ounce of hesitation, Skeeter said, “Yes.”

He then proceeded to get up with the group and follow them out of the diner. 
Not too long afterward, I heard a gun go off. Several times. And five minutes later, Skeeter walked back into the diner, slapped a twenty onto the counter, informed me that he “Almost forgot to pay,” and left. 

Now, I know I probably should’ve called the cops, but I had things to do; tables to wipe and dishes to clean. Plus, they barely touched their food, and I had to deal with all that. And, I mean, we *were* told not to mention deer around Skeeter. So that was, like prophecy or something. It was bound to happen. Why waste time right? And hey, maybe it didn’t actually happen. *Maybe* the forty something hours without sleep are getting to me just a bit. Calling the cops would’ve been a waste of time. So it’s okay. It’s *all* okay.

Anyway!

After I got done cleaning their booth and doing the dishes. It got quiet and we didn’t have any customers for a bit. 
So I got to work on the seven AM temperature checks, counted the change in the register, swept a bit— the usual maintenance stuff. It’s boring work, but it’s kinda nice. Like, I get a chance to shut off my brain and turn on the jukebox and let myself go on autopilot. Just, no thoughts, only do. And when I come back to the drivers seat, everything’s done and I get to enjoy a nice, clean-ish space with some nice music! 

Sometimes I find things when I go on autopilot. Usually I have a little locker in the back that I put it in so that when I snap out of it I can go back and look at all of the little treasures I collected. 

This time, it looks like I wound up finding a crumpled up piece of paper and a lot of notes. Most of the notes were in my chicken scratch handwriting, but the paper wasn’t. It had the words “it’s wearing their skin” written almost perfectly in crayon.

 While I’m pretty sure I wrote the notes, I’m not quite sure where the paper came from, (it’s hard to hold onto memories when I’m like that, so I don’t always know where this shit comes from) but there was a little doodle of a stick person crying a dark liquid next to the message.

 It wasn’t half bad, so I used some tape and stuck it to the door of the mini fridge. Maybe it’ll make whoever did it a little bit happier.

As for the notes, a lot of them were just basic observations. Like:

7:12 – rain started

7:15 – fog getting thick

7:20 – Wiped down drink machine 

7:26 – Sprayed Tomila, need more Frbreeze

7:31 – Mopped floors and ceiling 

7:42 – Voices are back, don’t listen

And that was that. When I was done sorting through and throwing away my notes, I completed my little routine and made a fresh batch of coffee.

Then at 8:31, Kurt started his shift, and at 8:49, I went to take the trash out.

I was about three feet from the dumpster, when I got this prickling feeling that something was watching me. 

I took a quick glance at the tree line, expecting to see Lucky there, but he wasn’t. 

Instead, the thing watching me from amongst the fog, was something else: a four point buck. It was standing there, staring at me with its weird little eyes. Like a freak. 

I thought we got rid of the things for good, but apparently, they’re getting brave again. I’ll have to write the owners another letter and set some more traps, but for now, I’ll just put out some poison. 

At 10:20, Hershel showed up ten minutes early to his shift, absolutely zooted out of his ever loving mind, and out of uniform. His tattoo also wasn’t on his arm anymore. Instead, it was on his hand and the eagle looked more like it was holding two shitty glow sticks instead of cups. You couldn’t even read the words under it. 

Thankfully, he was still able to work the grill and all was okay on that part. 

What wasn’t okay, was that at 12:55, Brennan Stringer came in and sat at the booth next to the jukebox. He ordered some French toast and a cup coffee. 

It sounds tame, but let me tell ya’ll— that guy, is no bueno.

Growing up, there were a ton of rumors. And I know you can’t exactly “listen to rumors” and all that, but trust me, with *this* *guy*, you can. 

Here’s two fun facts about me: 

1. I don’t really know how to eat spaghetti, and

2. I can’t remember a whole lot of my childhood. But what I *can* remember is that at least a few of those “rumors” were true. 

Like the one about him killing Mrs. Larsnich’s pet parakeet. 

I remember sitting there during rest period, Mrs. Larsnich had stepped out for a bit, and Brennan had gotten the bird from its cage in the back of the class. I sat there and *watched* him slowly squeeze it until it stopped moving.

Then there was the one about him putting Corbin Fairwearher in the hospital. I saw that fight happen during recess. (We were only in the second grade, but *man*, he beat the shit out of that kid.)

So when I heard things about Brennan being the last one to leave the boys bathroom after all of the mirrors were “mysteriously” broken or that Brennan was the only one to make it out un-singed when Sheriff Stringer’s house trailer caught fire, I was inclined to believe some stuff. 

The last I’d heard about Brennan was that, after the whole incident with that small forest fire, his dad had sent him off to a boot camp for his senior year. And no one’s seen hide nor hair of the bastard since.

So I had, what I’ve dubbed, my whacking stick close to me the whole time he was in the diner. (I usually keep it under the counter, but it came from a broken chair that I found near the dumpster. I’m pretty sure it was one of the legs that broke off. But it’s easy for me to hold and helps me deal with rats. And, on occasion, some of the more… difficult customers.) 

At 1:00, Hershel’s shift ended, but he didn’t leave until 1:08. This is because he just hung up his apron and sat with Brennan until he finished his meal, then they left together. 

A family of five came it at 1:20, and informed us that there was a man doing “provocative dances” outside. I told her that we’d handle it, but we never did. They headed out shortly afterwards and left two quarters as a tip. 

I went to check the mail at 2:00, but quickly came back inside when I noticed that a person in a clown mask was standing next to the mailbox. I wasn’t in any hurry, so I opted to check it later.

At some point between the times of 2:30 and 3:00, Tomila went missing. I asked Kurt if he knew anything, but he just looked at me weird and said he didn’t know. I ended up finding her at the end of the hallway in the mop station. 

5:00 is when Kurt’s shift ends, so at 4:49 I went to get his old uniform so I could give it to him before he left. (I washed our uniforms from a few nights ago, and I kept forgetting to give his back to him.) But when I came back inside, he wasn’t there. 

I was about to just cram it into his locker and call it a day, but I gave a quick look at the parking lot and saw him out by his car. So I hurried out to him, only to find that he 
A. wasn’t alone and B. was *clearly* in the middle of some sort of…deal with Brennan Stringer.
Brennan noticed me first and ended the interaction. He gave Kurt a small pat on the shoulder as he walked away, and I was able to hear as he said, “Pleasure doin business with you.” 

In the meantime, I stood there with the clean uniform in my arms, unsure of what the Hell I just came up on, and waited for Kurt to take notice. Which, he eventually did. It just took him a minute. 

He looked surprised to see me but took the uniform when I offered it to him. Then he left. And I took a much needed smoke break. 

So, that’s about all I have for now. I’ve gone through all of the records I’ve kept. I’ll let ya’ll know if anything else happens or if I notice anything interesting. Having said that, take care!",2,1755613849.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False
1muk2sa,https://www.reddit.com/r/OdysseyBookClub/comments/1muk2sa/the_untethered_soul_by_michael_a_singer_summary/,"""The Untethered Soul"" by Michael A. Singer - Summary, Quotes, and Lessons on Inner Freedom You’ll Actually Use (Especially If You Overthink Everything)","So let’s get real: *The Untethered Soul* isn’t just another spiritual book you skim while journaling in a coffee shop. It’s one of Oprah’s top life-changing reads, sold over 3 million copies, and has somehow been passed around in both yoga retreats *and* high-powered tech circles. Michael A. Singer, the man behind it, went from meditating in the woods to running a billion-dollar software company - all while staying spiritually grounded. That alone should make you curious.

The book’s premise? You are *not* your thoughts, your job, your relationship, or your trauma. You’re the *awareness* behind it all. Mind. Blown. As someone who’s definitely been bossed around by my inner critic (I call her the “shady roommate”), this hit hard. If you’ve ever felt like your brain was on a chaotic group chat you never asked to join, this book is your exit plan.

## **Book club rating: 9.2/10**

## **Key takeaways**:

* Your thoughts are not *you*. They’re just chatter. The real you is the one *noticing* the chatter. Once you realize that, you stop taking every thought so seriously.
* Freedom = detachment, not denial. You don’t have to fix every emotion. Just witness it without clinging or resisting. Energy moves through you when you stop gripping it.
* The ""open heart"" isn't fluff. It’s an energetic flow state. When you close down after getting hurt, you’re actually blocking your own life force.
* Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional. Most of our pain comes not from the thing itself, but from our resistance to it. Try staying open *through* the discomfort instead of avoiding it.
* Consciousness has no limits. All the rules you live by (I can’t do this, I’m just like that, etc.)? Self-imposed.
* Happiness isn't something you *get*. It’s something you *choose*, right now, no matter what’s going on. Wild concept, I know.

## **Favorite quotes**:

""There is nothing more important to true growth than realizing that you are not the voice of the mind - you are the one who hears it.""

""If you truly love life, don’t waste time - because time is what life is made of.""

""The only thing you really want from life is to feel enthusiasm, joy, and love.""



This book didn’t teach me how to “fix myself” - it taught me that I didn’t need to. I just needed to *stop identifying* with the version of me that was constantly trying to be fixed. Game-changer. Also made me realize how much energy I waste trying to avoid pain instead of just… feeling it and letting it pass.

If you're an overthinker, recovering people-pleaser, or someone who just wants *less internal drama*, read this. Seriously.

If you’re a lifelong learner (or a burned-out student) who’s too busy to read full books, this app *gets* you. You pick your depth: 10 or 20 min takeaways, or full 40-min deep dives. Mine reads in a “Samantha from *Her*” voice - actually addictive.

BeFreed builds you a personalized learning roadmap based on your struggles, goals, and how your brain works. It even has this wild “generate for you” mode that builds a 20-min podcast summary using the best sources - from books, podcasts, YouTube, and research. Think *Naval + James Clear + TED + Harvard Psych*. I’ve been knocking out books on spirituality, trauma healing, productivity, and energy management while making coffee. It honestly gives the same dopamine hit as scrolling TikTok - except I walk away wiser.

1muk249,https://i.redd.it/zyz6pt26lzjf1.jpeg,Just started fasting last month. :),"Hi, I’m new to Fasting. :) Started at 16:8 but now I’m doing 20:4 fairly consistently with every Sunday being a non fast day.

I’m so happy with progress so far! I’m trying to get back to my original weight. Around 130lbs.

I usually have a matcha or coffee in the morning, with one meal in the evening. Water throughout the rest of the day. :D

I decided to do this after my last dr. Appointment where my blood test came back in the pre-diabetic zone. My doctors been really happy that I’m finally making an effort to get in better shape.

Before fasting, I did 0 exercise. Stayed indoors and ate whatever I wanted. Now I’m getting out with the goal of 5000 to 10000 steps a day.

It’s been so hype! I already feel a little better both in health and the way I’m starting to look.

I’m really happy I found this community! It inspired me to try fasting. ",30,1755613794.0,intermittentfasting,4,0.98,False

I [22F] like this guy [25m] from our church since 2017. He was my light group head back then. Fell for him because, for some reason, he just knows the right things to say. he became an image of god for me here on earth.

I started going to our youth gathering in January 2017. However, i was only active for around 3 months. our youth group had a camp back then that i cannot attend because we had no money for it. with that, i just felt shy going back to the group after since i thought i'd be left out. but afterwards, i was still attending maybe once a month or once every 2 months. pandemic happened, and i entered college already, so i wasnt able to attend at all for several years. but i'd still go to our church every week, but not the youth gathering.

i've been meaning to go, not because of him (okay maybe partly), but since i know that it is one of the reasons why i built a stronger connection with god.

fast forward to my 4th year in college (around november 2024), he suddenly started interacting with my ig stories and posts. he would reply or like them. there were several days he would message daily. he then invited me to a coffee pop up by his friend. i came, of course, but was there for only a few minutes because i had to meet my friends afterwards. and frankly because my body was shaking badly because hey that's my crush! and for some reason, after that day, the messages and interactions significantly lessened. i am honestly not sure what ive done, but it's fine for me. we would still interact with one another now and then but very limited.

fast forward to few months after (april 2025), there was another youth camp! this year, i really told myself that i should go already. i'm already 22 and is about to graduate college so i had to go to that camp. not because of him, but because i know i would get to know god deeper there. i'm scared that if i did not attend this year, i may not be eligible anymore in the coming years because im technically not a youth anymore lol. before signing up, i messaged him to ask if there were also first time camp attendees that are already in their 20s just like me. he validated me that yes there are, so that gave me the confidence to sign up. mind you, prior to this, we would still send each other random reels very seldom tho. he also invited me to go to the monthly coffee pop up by his friend too.

came camp, i had the best days of my life. on the last day, i came up to him to hug and tell him, ""thank you for not being a stranger all these years. let's push through with that coffee please"" he said sure.

it has been months, and for some reason, he never sent any reel anymore and would often ignore mine. which btw was fine with me, i was never entitled to any response i know!! and i don't really want to be a burden.

almost end of july 2025, i saw in his ig note he wrote, ""should i ask her out?"" which may just confirm that he already has a special someone. don't get me wrong, i am very happy for him. i aspire nothing but his happiness. i just brushed it off. few days later, while casually scrolling through ig reels, i saw a post by a girl where she and him went out. hehe maybe she was the girl he was referring to in his ig note. upon further investigation, i learned that they were childhood friends. i also get why he may develop feelings for the girl— basing on her posts, she is very matured, intelligent, kind, god-fearing, and very pretty.

last sunday, i served in church taking pictures. he was there too. i greeted him happily and asked how he was. every thing should be normal. he is completely unaware of my feelings, and he is not responsible with me in any way. so i should really act casual. i was packing my things when he came to me, we had a short conversation. he even offered a ride to the cafe where the youth group would be hanging out after service, which i gladly agreed to. in the cafe, he sat next to me and we (along with other youth) had conversations and games. it was definitely fun. i accidentally glanced on his phone one time and saw that he was sending a photo to someone. i did not saw who it really was but saw that the icon was mostly white. when we got home, i saw that the icon kinda resembles the icon of the girl that posted the reel. this just confirmed to me more that they may be dating or talking already.

i know i do not have any right in this situation. i'm just a girl who has been secretly liking him lol. my friends told me several times already to confess my feelings for him. but i know for a fact that if that feelings are reciprocated, he would have told me already. but no, so i can confirm that this is all just me lol. and that's fine, i just have to find a way to move on already. god it has been more than 8 years ready. please don't get me wrong, i am truly happy for him if he ends up with the girl. they deserve each other, and actually they look like a perfect match.

i just need to ask for advice on how i should move on. i think this is harder that moving on from a relationship, because i know that there was nothing to begin with lol. at least when you end a relationship, you both know that you have to stay away from each other and that you tried yet things just doesn't work out. i just can't find a handbook that tells me ways on how i should move on from a guy in this situation lol. knowing for a fact that i would see him every week in church (non nego btw, i love my church and would not replace it just to move on from a guy haha)",1,1755613781.0,heartbreak,1,1.0,False

Is this the new future?? 🤯

Here’s the wildest part: you barely need hardcore coding skills. Some of them basically want you to just *use* apps and give feedback. That’s… the dream job for everybody obsessed with their phone, right? If you’re feeling as bamboozled as I am, scroll down, because these 10 companies dropped my jaw...

- **Testlio** – The OG of crowdtesting. You actually get paid to break stuff—how is that fair?!
- **Applause** – Genuinely global, super-flexible, and they want feedback from any device, anywhere, any time. Am I tripping, or is that too convenient??
- **UserTesting** – These guys will literally send you money for talking about your feelings using their app. (Don’t make it weird.)
- **Beta Family** – If you like finding bugs AND creating fun bug names for them, this is your place.
- **uTest** – Work in pajamas, get paid, repeat. I am still not over the remote part.
- **Rainforest QA** – AI meets humans meets ultimate work-life balance. What parallel universe did I wake up in?
- ***https://goodnovel.org/testapp*** – They’re offering REMOTE spots for mobile testers and pay pretty well by the sound of it (yes, seriously). Check the deets here: ***https://goodnovel.org/testapp***
- **Mobisoft** – Offers both long-term and short-term gigs... my commitment issues shed a tear of relief.
- **Global App Testing** – They want testers from every corner of the earth. Your couch counts as your corner.
- ***https://goodnovel.org/testapp*** (posting again, because their spots vanish FAST)

Can we pause and ask—are companies competing to make employment... actually enjoyable? Is this loss of commute my reward for living through too many update cycles??

Honestly, it doesn’t make sense. Most people trained for *years* to land tech jobs, and now all you need is a phone and common sense??

Just look at ***https://goodnovel.org/testapp*** and tell me you’re not flabbergasted. Half of these listings have application links that look so simple it’s almost sus. Like—application, click, done. 

Are we seeing the end of the boring 9-to-5 here? Or is this just a glamorous phase until robots take over?

Before anyone jumps to conclusions, I checked out ***https://goodnovel.org/testapp*** myself, and it legit looks like a golden ticket. Does anyone have insider stories about these gigs? Technical tests scary? What’s the weirdest bug you were ever paid to find? 

Is all of this TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE or is 2025 just totally different? 😳

Bahrain Company Formation 2025 Expert Guide\
When I first walked into the soaring glass atrium of Bahrain Financial Harbour—a stone’s throw from the bustling Diplomatic Area—I had no idea just how streamlined company formation could be in this Gulf kingdom. The reception’s quiet efficiency, the blend of Bahraini coffee service with a flourish, and the business deals being sealed in hushed majlis-style meetings—all of it embodied a sense of promise that I’d rarely witnessed elsewhere in the region. Over dozens of journeys—ranging from registering a consultancy in the Seef District to sitting through a Ramadan business negotiation near Bahrain Bay—I’ve watched the country’s business environment transform, especially as Bahrain climbs the international rankings for business ease and regulatory transparency.\
\
Alt text: Business people professional meeting in Bahrain., Bahrain secured a spot in the top 30 globally for ease of doing business—climbing two places since 2024. Reuters (April 2025) echoed this momentum, citing Bahrain’s streamlined licensing, digital company formation tools, and transparent tax policies as core drivers.\
\
World Bank legacy indices (pre-2023): Bahrain consistently outranked many Gulf peers, particularly in starting a business and dealing with construction permits.\
2025 updates: The Bahrain Economic Development Board (EDB) rolled out enhanced e-government integration in January, directly reducing average registration times by 22%. Bahrain’s MOICT also slashed business name approval times to under 24 hours for most company types.\
\
\
Even during Ramadan, with altered business hours and customary majlis-style meetings, the Sijilat platform allowed me to secure approvals in under 72 hours—a feat that would take much longer anywhere else in the GCC.\
\
Curious about business types? Company formation in Bahrain is now more straightforward than ever.\
\
Bahrain’s 2025 Business Environment: Economic Data & Growth Projections\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting. inflows rose by 9% (Q1 2025), driven by tech, fintech, and logistics sectors.\
\
Inflation remains steady at 2.1%, and business registration in the Seef and Diplomatic Areas is surging.\
Free Zones (notably Bahrain Logistics Zone) now account for nearly 18% of new corporate registrations (see free zone benefits).\
\
Major regulatory shifts have created new incentives. As of Feb 2025, Tamkeen’s grant eligibility expanded to cover 100% foreign-owned SMEs, provided they base operations in Bahrain Bay or the Financial Harbour.\
Comparing with UAE and Saudi Arabia\
While Dubai boasts rapid infrastructure, Bahrain uniquely combines zero corporate tax for most sectors, 100% foreign ownership (see official update), and no currency restrictions. Saudi Arabia, in contrast, still mandates local sponsorship for many mainland activities.\
\
My consulting group saved almost BHD 2,000 per year in compliance costs versus a similar operation in Riyadh—all due to Bahrain’s simplified VAT and labor processing.\

\
The Step-by-Step Bahrain Company Formation Process (2025)\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration. for flexible SME setups\
- SPC (Single Person Company)—ideal for solo founders\
- Branch office**—for foreign firms expanding regionally\
Check the full business structure comparison for more details.\
Insider Tip:\
WLL and SPC are processed fastest at the MOICT’s Seef District counter between 9:00 and 11:00 am (I’ve avoided countless queues this way).\
2. Reserve Business Name (Sijilat Platform)\
\
Online via Sijilat (https://www.sijilat.bh/): usually 1–24 hours.\
Prepare three name choices—avoid common, generic, or religious terms.\
Fees: BHD 25–50.\
\
3. Draft and Notarize Memorandum of Association\
\
MOICT-approved templates are widely accepted.\
Notary offices in the Diplomatic Area process documents within 2 business days.\
Document shortcut: Pre-fill digital forms on Sijilat, then book an appointment online.\
\
4. Obtain Commercial Registration (CR)\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation.).\
- CR fees: BHD 50–150 up front.\
\
A personal challenge: During my first registration, I underestimated Ramadan’s shorter business hours. Solution? Always check official MOICT timings and consider submitting on Sunday mornings—queues are lighter post-weekend.\
\
\
Bahrain Company Formation Costs (2025)\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs.\
Full-service small company: BHD 900–1,600 (central office, more activities, legal extras)\
See the latest Bahrain company formation cost breakdown.\
Money-Saving Strategies\
\
Apply for all ministry permissions in one batch—this reduces approval lags.\
Use an authorized business center as your temporary address to avoid long-term lease costs until you’re established.\
\
Common mistake: Entrepreneurs miss Sijilat’s updated fee schedules, leading to surprise bills at the CR issuance.\
Prevention: Download the MOICT fee schedule before final submission.\
\
Foreign Ownership, Sponsorship, and Registration\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation.)\
- Local sponsorship: Required only for a few sensitive sectors (see local sponsorship rules)\
- Special activities: Some fields like banking/insurance need extra CBB approvals.\
- Free Zones: Full foreign investor rights, zero customs on re-export goods (free zone guide)\
Random tangent:\
When exporting date syrup, I discovered Bahrain’s Customs uses a streamlined e-clearance—unlike the UAE, where physical inspections delayed us for days. Speed matters.\
\
Compliance, Accounting, and Post-Creation Duties\
\
Alt text: Professional business support.).\
Resource tip: Keylink’s bundled accounting services saved my consultancy from missing a regulatory deadline last March—highly recommended for first-timers.\
Majlis business custom sidebar:\
Even during compliance meetings, expect Bahraini hosts to serve Arabic coffee and dates. Accepting (and discussing business over it) builds credibility.\
\
Regulatory Changes: What’s New for 2025?\
Importantly, Bahrain’s MOICT implemented a digital signature requirement for all commercial registration submissions, effective March 1st, 2025. This means even remote founders can complete company setup from abroad—no embassy visits required.\
\
Penalties for late annual report filing now increased to BHD 250 as of April 2025.\
Sijilat API integration with LMRA—enabling real-time labor registration, saving 1–2 days per application.\
\
Practical implication:\
If you’re abroad, use Bahrain’s e-key system for digital ID and signatures—much faster than couriering documents. Avoid last-minute rushes, especially near Eid when processing slows down.\
\
The Best Office Locations in Bahrain for Company Formation\
\
Seef District: Top for corporate services, quick ministry access.\
Bahrain Financial Harbour: For premium image and direct EDB support.\
Bahrain Bay: Tech startups, creative industries.\
Salamabad/Industrial Areas: Logistics, manufacturing, cost-saving.\
\
And, don’t forget to avoid Diplomatic Area traffic jams during peak ministry hours—this trick alone has saved my clients several hours weekly.\
\
Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them\
\
Misjudging Ramadan timings: Plan submissions early in the day.\
Incomplete documentation: Use a digital checklist (MOICT provides one—request it at the counter).\
Ignoring annual compliance: Set calendar reminders; outsource accounting if needed.\
Underestimating costs: Always factor in the BHD 50–100 reserve for unexpected ministry fees.\
\
\
FAQ: Bahrain Company Formation & Doing Business\
1. How long does it take to set up a company in Bahrain in 2025?\
Average time is 3–7 working days, assuming documents are correct and submitted via Sijilat. Fastest results are in the Seef District or via e-signature from abroad. See detailed process steps\

Yes, in almost all sectors as of 2025. Activities like banking may require additional steps. Read more: Foreign ownership guide\
3. What are the minimum costs for company formation?\
Expect BHD 250–350 for a simple WLL; higher with office/extra activities. Latest cost breakdown\
4. What business structure is best?\
WLL for flexibility and SME focus; SPC for solo founders; Branch for international firms. Compare business structures\
5. What post-setup accounting or compliance is required?\
Annual MOICT reports, electronic bookkeeping, and VAT (if applicable). Outsourcing these accounting and bookkeeping services in Bahrain will save you time and penalties.\
\
For a complete overview, always check official government resources for the latest rule changes, and keep an eye on Forbes Business or Reuters for real-time economic updates.\
And remember: Business in Bahrain isn’t just about forms and fees—it’s about relationships, timing, and a coffee-fueled determination to make things happen, faster and friendlier than almost anywhere else in the Gulf.",1,1755613506.0,companysetupbh,1,1.0,False

What risks do I need to be aware of when practicing findom? It doesn't seem so risky. There addiction and home wrecking and blackmail. But I'm not even addressing those risks bc I think most of us are aware of them at this point. 

I'm talking about an awareness that is much less frequently addressed, financial literacy. 

Let's say by years old you have sunk $10k into this hobby. That's not a bad assumption. I'm won't say what my number is but I spent way more than that in my first year. 

That's not an unreasonable amount. That's coffee sends right there. $10 a day for 3 years. So it's quite doable. 

What are the opportunity costs here? $10k in your retirement account at age 25 to age 65 is 40 years. Here's the breakdown: 

• 5% return is $70,400
• 8% return is $217,200
• 10% return is $452,600

So now that you're aware of the risks you're ready to play. Have fun out there. As for me I say, go ahead and buy your own coffee. ",7,1755613500.0,paypigsupportgroup,6,0.89,False
1mujx3z,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1mujx3z/how_to_deal_with_mentally_unstable_sister/,How to deal with mentally unstable sister,"Hey this might be a long story, i really need some answers im going to be completely transparent about my issue. I need some solutions. 
Me 20M and have 2 sisters 22F , 25F. And the middle one is the issue here (tell me if actually the middle one is always a menace or am i being stereotypical)
My elder sister since childhood she was a little dominant, she stands for herself, she even gets ready at the age of 5 for school without even asking mum for help after fighting with her, she had some serious skin alleric, havent told family for years until it turned insanely horrible. Thus told, she is someone who ""wont ask help even there is a need to ask help"". And me being a dumb guy, who don't even cry no more than 2 minutes, even as a child(my mum told). I brushoff things easily and keep things to myself, and deal stuffs after. Wont take little things more serious.
And here is the middle one:
1. She draws very well, exceptionally good as an artist
2. She caused more atrocities as a child (for both mum and dad)
3. As a child she cries a lot as we all do, yet she keeps acting like crying making sound and throwing tantrums with no tears running down from eyes[tell me if its called attention seeking or just normal as a child]
4. Doesnt do home chores or help mum [me and my elder sister does most of the work]
5. She acts like she doesnt know how to do chores laundry, though she know she could try and figure things and help with us. (All she does is scrolling and sleeping 10+ hours a day)
6. She likes the posts that shows depressive theme in instagram, doesnt post stories or posts at all. Just ""likes""
7. She wont cook, clean, do stuffs except if her business is interrupted.
8. She would go as far as she can to fulfill her needs and wants, and postpone or procrastinate things we demand her.
9. She doesnt ever had a boy friend, she got approached a lot yet she refuses, now she is in love with a guy who show mixed signals.
10. She doesnt have much friends 1 in school who is still in contact with her and she didnt go to college, around 3 to 4 friends at workplace, that too was not a quality one.
11. She have social anxiety, ask every needs to my elder sister who will talk and figure things out for her including money, talking to someone from the property owner, plumber, etc etc...
12. Thats told she doesnt go flexible, doesnt adjust for others need.
These are the outline of the personality of my sister. She had bought me airpods as my bday gift, gave me a nickname,  hugs me in pictures.
Yet.
She calls me ugly, dumb brother, if i miss out on one thing accidently she goes completely upset.

And me and my elder sister have things in common, we both have similar morals, decisions, thought processes. And while we talk it usually goes all the way up to me and my elder one (together) fighting with the middle one over a opinion.

Here where the problem arise:
1. Me and my elder sister call her narcissistic/selfish 
2. We call her not being worthy to cook or clean (as i told she doesnt)
3. We call her that she is not as much aware of things around us  (like news, english terms, random stuffs- which she actually doesn't know about.)

Here is the catch:
I acknowledge the actions we did, we should not degrade others in anything. But BETWEEN SIBLINGS?
1.Siblings call each other ugly and we know they look good
2.we call the food they cook was horrible and proceed to lick until the utensil erodes.
3. And still got each others back when parents go against us.
4. We support each other and even started a business together.

She landed a job at the age of 19, i got a job a few weeks back, so we decided to stay together renting a flat in apartment. We did. Even my elder one helped her financially to get things done, roamed all over the city to find leaving tenants to get a decent house to stay. Then finally we decided to go home together for a weekend, we did. Reached home and dad and mum were super happy to see us.

Turns out i had feverish, dizziness and headache. Suddenly after lunch my middle sister started complaining angrily to mum about my elder sister, i was too tired for that shit i ate and slept.
I know it was something about my elder sister acted like she threw her responsibilities she promised to keep regarding the rented apartment,in a minor arguement(i.e paying maintenance and gas bill and water bill. Though my elder sister is not going to stay there) after that arguement, my big sis still didnt take things serious and provided everything my middle sister asks for. Yet she yelled at her for acting like cutting off the responsibility after she promised. After that i wake up went for making a coffee to the kitchen and my big sis was working on a project in work from home. I talked and asked why you guys are fighting in the smallest time we got being at home, she laughed and my mum joined the convo and talked about the same stuffs and what my little sister yelled about my big sis to mum. And suddenly she showed up and tells ""lets talk right in front of me and see whats wrong""
And the arguement went between her, my big sis and my mum i sat there with absolute silence.
Suddenly all of a sudden she started mentioning 
""Them two"" (me and my 25F big sis)
""They are always degradinv me, mocking me, telling iam worthless, that iam toxic and narcissistic, they tell me that iam a trash""
""You guys even come in my dreams and abuse me verbally about how worthless iam""
""They are the reason i lose confidence, 
Im not bad i did lot of stuffs for both of them yet they call me narcissistic""
""I WOULD KILL BOTH OF YOU IF YOU GUYS EVER DO SUCH THING AGAIN"" [this single line made me decide that i should never talk to her ever again and abandon her from my life.]
And she left earlier saying  she cant stay here and that us both making her feel ever more bad (we just exist in the home havent talked to her since she last yelled)
And now i came back for work, i really feel horrible staying with her, and she cant cook and i have to cook the food for her and she pays the entire rent. Last night she cooked noodles and served me too, havent talked a single convo except me asking for a spare key to keep for myself, she answered arrogantly that she have no idea about it. It feels like iam staying with a toxic roommate.
I told my sister that i cant live with her she told me to adjust for a few months.
I really hate being with her, having to cook for her, i can afford a 1 Room and Kitchen alone, even my dad told me that he will pay the rent and separate us both ways thus avoiding further arguments and quarrels. But i know its not that easy, i cant suddenly move out as we just moved in a few weeks not even months.
I dont know what to do. She is actually mentall unstable, narcissistic  and selfish but if we mention so she gets excessively mad.
Should i move out after 6 months?
I dont want to try to or talk and resolve the solution with her, frankly i dont want her anymore.

This is classic Jio playbook: enter with aggressive pricing, build user base, then expand the ecosystem. Remember how they disrupted telecom?

A few thoughts on what this means:

The good: More accessible tax filing for millions. Digital-first approach could streamline the entire process. Competition always benefits consumers.

The concerning: At ₹24, the margins are razor-thin. Either they're betting heavily on volume and cross-selling, or the service quality might suffer. Also raises questions about data handling when costs are this low.

For the industry: Traditional CA firms and established tax platforms like ClearTax will need to rethink their value proposition. Can't compete on price alone anymore.Having worked in fintech, I've seen how loss-leader strategies can backfire if not executed well. The real test will be:

Service quality during peak filing season

Data security standards

Long-term sustainability

Later on, someone we both know mentioned she had asked about me, and then she added me on social media. I was excited and messaged her, she replied, I responded … and then she left me on read.

I figured that was that, but about a week later she actually messaged me again, apologised for the delay, and we had a nice chat where I realised we have a lot in common. But now she’s left me on read again.

We’ve still been liking each other’s posts in the meantime, but I’m confused. On one hand, she added me and restarted the chat, and was asking questions etc when we did chat, which makes me think she’s interested. On the other hand, she hasn’t initiated and she's the one that has ended the conversation which makes me worry I’m annoying her.

From what I know about her, I have a crush and I’d love to get to know her better. My friend says I should stop overthinking and just ask her out — that confidence is attractive and I’d come across way better in person than over DMs.

But part of me is scared she’s just being polite. So do I go for it and ask her out for coffee or leave it and see if she ever initiates again?

(We are both aware that we are both lesbians, so that part’s not an issue)

Ps I've purposely left some details vague as I have an irrational fear that she will see this, but if you want clarity on anything that you feel will change your answer feel free to DM me. ",7,1755613220.0,LesbianActually,4,0.9,False

We spoke on Grindr months ago, I assumed he we were both looking to hookup. Shared albums, then shared my face pic and got ghosted (happens a lot to me💀…), deleted the chat and moved on, it wasn’t that deep.

Then a couple months after this, I see him in the mall, we locked eyes but I turned away in embarrassment, under the assumption he didn’t find me attractive, but he smiled. He messages me a couple hours later asking if that was me, saying he thought I was really cute. Chatted a bit, then asked to meet me.

Met for coffee (it felt like an interview lol, I’m so awkward, and I’m not out so was panicking), then he invited me over to his. We made out, cuddled, but didn’t have sex. But he was overly romantic and affectionate, I was lowkey so nervous because usually it’s just “Hi” and straight to action with other guys, but I liked it. 
Since then we’ve been speaking for a couple months now, we’ve met maybe 3 times, talk almost everyday, and I’ve definitely fallen in love, I think about him 24/7. I’ve never been in a relationship before, nor have I ever been interested in being in one, but with him I just always want to be in his arms.
Before him I was pretty active on Grindr, but since we started talking I deleted it and have no interest in hooking up with someone else. Even watching porn doesn’t get me excited as much.

But I don’t know if this is mutual, I feel he’s very hot and cold; sometimes very flirty and invested in my personal life, but sometimes very dry. We’re very different people personality-wise, I would say I’m extroverted, but I’m still very shy, I’m scared to be the one reaching out to him or initiating interactions, I don’t flirt unless he does, otherwise I feel like I look desperate.

When I looked back at our Grindr messages, he did say ‘we can see where this goes’, but at the time I was assuming he meant in terms of sex/hooking up.
