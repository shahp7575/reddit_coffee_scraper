1miyxy9,https://v.redd.it/fux12cxdychf1,Creatista Plus - Coffee dispensing problem,"Hello everyone. About a year ago I was given a used Nespresso Creatista Plus as a gift. 

Since a few days ago, it started to give me a problem during brewing, as coffee is leaking from both the brewing hole and another internal hole. When I make coffee, I get half coffee in the cup and half coffee inside the used capsule container. 

I leave a video to try to make you understand the problem, highlighting the incorrect exit hole.

Has this ever happened to you? Do you have any suggestions?",1,1754468263.0,nespresso,0,1.0,False
1miyxau,https://www.reddit.com/r/letters/comments/1miyxau/tarot/,Tarot,"I was walking with a friend in Germany in 2023 when he asked me if I want my future to be read, so I asked the usual: career but be focused on Love. He shuffled the cards and he said that I will meet him far away… not from the place I knew half of my life.

At first I was puzzled… where? i did traveled a lot but where? my friend told me it could be in an airport, restaurant, coffee shop or club but again reiterated that my soon to be husband will not come from the place I am so familiar with.. the east.

So I asked when will I meet him? He said it will take long… Years… I must admit I got little disappointed because I want to be married soon but he said It will never happen until I accomplished the things in my career since I am skilled, talented and beautiful not only on superficially but skin deep.

My tarot reader friend then said: Don’t worry because it will happen. He is there waiting.

Gosh. It means at least for me, that there will be no games, second or hundredth guessing. He’s there waiting. Patiently.

We’re easing back into gear after the summer break and wanted to thank everyone who’s kept the discussions going while we were away. The subreddit has been full of solid feedback, stories, and thoughtful criticism. We really appreciate the time you take to share it all.

Next up: syncing up internally, ironing out console updates, and planning the path forward, also a Coffee Stain event to attend. No announcements just yet, but we’re back in dev mode and excited about what’s coming. We’ve got things planned, and some things have already happened during the summer. But we’ll share more once they’ve taken a more defined shape.

Our summer sale went smashing, and we can brag that we have more than double the standard Steam wishlist activation, and still, we have close to 500k wishlists still waiting!

""You've weathered countless storms over the years. Welcome home, Arabella.""  
  
At the celebratory dinner, a young man in a perfectly tailored suit found himself unwilling to look away from Arabella Stanley.   
  
She possessed an otherworldly beauty, her sharp features sculpted with precision and wrapped in an aura of cool detachment.   
  
Her piercing eyes revealed nothing of her inner thoughts, and when she spoke, her voice carried the same arctic chill. ""I'm leaving now.""  
  
Joshua Willis, the young man, seized the moment without hesitation. ""Allow me to drive you home.""  
  
Arabella offered no resistance.   
  
The car glided through the night. The city lights blurred past as Joshua stole glances at her profile.  
  
""When do you plan to return to the company? Our empire continues to flourish.""  
  
Their partnership had begun years ago through a chance project, and Joshua had witnessed Arabella's brilliance firsthand.   
  
He had persuaded her to join forces, and together they had forged a company that now dominated the entire industry.   
  
Arabella maintained her measured tone. ""I'll decide when the time feels right. For now, I simply want to reach home.""  
  
""Understood completely. You must be eager to reunite with Daisy. She's undoubtedly thriving. I've been directing all the premium projects to your aunt's husband throughout these years."" Joshua's grin widened as he angled for recognition.   
  
Arabella and her twin sister Daisy Stanley had lost their parents at the tender age of six, and their aunt Meagan Tucker had stepped in to care for them both.   
  
Arabella acknowledged him with a subtle nod. ""I appreciate that.""  
  
Her delicate fingers found the cherry blossom pendant resting against her throat, clicking it open to reveal a treasured photograph of herself and Daisy.   
  
Arabella's expression remained stoic in the image, but Daisy's smile blazed with pure joy.   
  
Studying her sister's radiant face, Arabella felt an unfamiliar warmth soften her features.   
  
After their parents' tragic death, Arabella and Daisy had become each other's entire world. Daisy had always been their family's ray of sunshine, illuminating every room she entered.   
  
At twelve, Arabella had been handpicked by the government for a classified operation that consumed seven years of her life. Now that the mission had concluded, she could finally return to Daisy.   
  
She had forwarded nearly every government paycheck to her sister, ensuring Daisy lived in comfort and security.   
  
Joshua's eyes widened in amazement as he witnessed Arabella's smile.   
  
The legendary ice queen was actually smiling?   
  
His curiosity about Arabella's sister intensified dramatically.   
  
The car approached an upscale residential community, where each house boasted its own meticulously maintained garden.   
  
The vehicle glided to a stop in front of a house.   
  
This was the home Arabella's parents had bequeathed to them, now shared between Meagan and Daisy.   
  
The estate glowed with warm light, alive with the sound of cheerful laughter.   
  
Daisy seemed to be flourishing beautifully.   
  
With that thought in mind, Arabella preserved her gentle smile as she crossed into the front yard.   
  
A weathered doghouse sat in the corner of the property.   
  
Someone knelt beside it in the shadows.   
  
Through the dim evening light, Arabella couldn't distinguish the person's features, but she watched them scooping food directly from the bowl placed on the ground.   
  
Why would someone be eating beside the doghouse?   
  
Concern creased her brow as Arabella approached cautiously.   
  
The figure appeared startled and scrambled quickly into the doghouse.   
  
Arabella's bewilderment deepened. Then a soft, trembling voice drifted from within the shelter.  
  
""Please don't strike me again. I won't make any mistakes. I'll be so much more careful...""  
  
That voice belonged to Daisy.   
  
Arabella's heart shattered instantly. She lunged forward, pulling the figure from the doghouse. Even in the pale moonlight, she recognized her beloved sister immediately.   
  
Daisy stared back, her eyes swimming with disbelief. ""You..."" she breathed, as though she feared her mind was playing cruel tricks on her.   
  
""Daisy, is that truly you?"" Arabella's voice trembled with disbelief.   
  
When Daisy nodded weakly, a glacial fury erupted within Arabella, her eyes igniting with volcanic rage.   
  
""Bella..."" Daisy whispered, still trapped in shock. ""You've actually come back?""  
  
The moment felt impossibly surreal to Daisy, like a vision conjured from desperate longing.   
  
Arabella, sensing something terribly wrong, reached out to touch Daisy's forehead. Her skin burned with fever.   
  
Before Arabella could process this discovery, Daisy crumpled into her arms like a broken doll.   
  
Arabella cradled her sister, whose body felt heartbreakingly frail and ice-cold despite the raging fever consuming her.   
  
Arabella's heart crystallized into something harder than diamond.   
  
The front door of the house suddenly burst open with violent force.   
  
""Daisy, you worthless creature! It's been several minutes, and you're still not finished eating? Get inside immediately and wash those dishes!"" Meagan's voice sliced through the night air like a bl\*\*e.   
  
Arabella pivoted slowly, her predatory gaze locking onto her target.   
  
Meagan had transformed dramatically over the years.   
  
Once haggard and perpetually exhausted, she now radiated wealth and privilege, adorned in an expensive designer coat and gleaming jewelry that caught the porch light, presenting herself as the very embodiment of refined elegance.   
  
Meagan's bl\*\*d turned to ice under Arabella's lethal stare. ""You... Arabella? When did you arrive?""  
  
""What have you done to her?"" Arabella advanced with calculated steps, her voice dropping to a menacing whisper.   
  
Meagan instinctively retreated, unsettled by the predatory intensity burning in Arabella's eyes. But she quickly rallied her confidence, reminding herself that Arabella was still just a young woman.   
  
She twisted her lips into a cruel sneer. ""Daisy shattered a dish, so I administered appropriate punishment. You've been absent for years. Do you possess any understanding of how challenging life has been here? I never allowed her to starve or sleep without shelter. If you weren't my brother's daughters, I wouldn't have wasted my time with either of you.""  
  
In one fluid motion, Arabella's hand shot out and seized Meagan by the throat, her expression transforming into something carved from arctic stone.   
  
Meagan ga\*\*ed desperately, clawing at Arabella's iron grip. ""Let... me... go...""  
  
""This is my house,"" Arabella declared, her voice carrying the finality of a death sentence, her eyes radiating lethal intent.  
  
""You forced Daisy to perform menial labor. You made her sleep in that doghouse like an animal. You possess remarkable audacity, Meagan.""  
  
In the warm light streaming from the house, Arabella finally saw what Daisy had been consuming. It was the leftover food.   
  
Holding her sister, who felt as weightless as a dying bird and appeared ghostly pale and utterly drained, Arabella felt her heart shatter into countless pieces.   
  
Her precious sister had endured this nightmare!   
  
""Meagan,"" Arabella said, her voice saturated with deadly promise, ""when you moved into our home, you swore a sacred oath that you would care for Daisy.""  
  
Meagan bristled at Arabella's bold use of her first name, the disrespect cutting deep.   
  
But she shrank backward when she witnessed the murderous gleam dancing in Arabella's eyes.   
  
Arabella had always been fundamentally different from other children. She was cold and fearlessly bold.   
  
When Arabella had lived here, Meagan had performed the role of a dutiful aunt, though barely meeting even the lowest standards.   
  
But the moment Arabella departed, Meagan had seized absolute control, systematically crushing the gentle-spirited Daisy beneath her cruel authority.   
  
She had never imagined Arabella would return to witness her crimes.   
  
""I did take care of Daisy! She made a mistake, so I disciplined her accordingly. What's so terrible about that?""   
  
Meagan's words died in her throat as Arabella's grip tightened mercilessly, making her feel as though death itself was reaching for her soul.   
  
""Arabella?"" The violent commotion finally drew the attention of the people inside. Meagan's husband and daughter noticed the deadly confrontation unfolding at their door.   
  
Through the wide open front door, Arabella observed them living luxuriously in a spacious and magnificently decorated villa, with a table overflowing with exquisite delicacies.  
  
The people inside wore expensive clothing that spoke of comfort and abundance.   
  
Meanwhile, Daisy had been sleeping in a doghouse, consuming leftovers. Arabella's eyes burned with unshed tears as the devastating truth crashed over her with overwhelming force.   
  
  
Chapter 2 Can You Check Who Made The Payment  
Khloe Tucker was fuming.   
  
""Let go of my mom, Arabella! Back then, she offered to take care of you and Daisy out of kindness. Is that how you repay her? You show up after disappearing for years, acting like you're some kind of hero? What, did you run off, get pr\*\*nant, and have a kid or something? What a joke!""  
  
Khloe threw Arabella a nasty glare, but deep down, she actually hoped Arabella might stay. Having her back would mean more help around the house.   
  
But Arabella's eyes had already gone cold. Without saying a word, she entered the house and kicked the dining table hard.   
  
Dishes flew everywhere, crashing onto the floor and shattering into pieces.   
  
Before anyone could react, Arabella grabbed two vases and hurled them straight at Khloe and her father.   
  
They hit them squarely, and bl\*\*d started trickling down their faces as they screamed in shock.   
  
Her voice was ice. ""You've got one day. Get out of my house."" Without waiting for a reply, she stormed out with Daisy in her arms.   
  
She flagged down the first taxi she saw and rushed her sister straight to a hospital.   
  
Back at the villa, chaos broke out.   
  
""Mom! That psycho actually attacked me!"" Khloe sobbed, staring at the scratches on her face in the mirror. ""What if I'm left with scars?""  
  
Meagan's fury boiled over. ""She's gotten way too bold after all these years! If she shows her face again, she won't be so lucky. We're not nobodies anymore. We've joined hands with Norman Group. There's no way she can stand against us!""  
  
She gave Khloe a comforting pat. ""Don't worry, honey. I'm taking you to a hospital right now.""  
  
\*\*\*  
  
At the hospital, the doctor examined Daisy and frowned. ""Her leg's been broken for a while, and she's covered in bruises. Some of her teeth are missing too. What kind of sister lets this happen?""  
  
Arabella's voice was low. ""It's my fault.""  
  
Her bangs fell over her eyes, hiding whatever she was feeling inside.   
  
The doctor, noticing how quiet she was, spoke gently. ""I've done what I could for now. But if someone's been hurting you two, you need to report it. Keeping quiet won't fix anything.""  
  
Arabella gave a small nod and moved to stand beside Daisy's hospital bed.   
  
Daisy, now nineteen, looked heartbreakingly fragile. Her thin frame looked like it couldn't support itself, and her wrists seemed more like twigs than limbs.   
  
Her short hair was uneven, dry, and choppy, like someone had taken scissors to it without a second thought.   
  
Arabella gently lifted the blanket, and her heart dropped.   
  
Daisy's skin told a horrifying story. Old whip marks crisscrossed her legs, and dark burn spots marred her arms.  
  
Each scar screamed of cruelty. Arabella's breath caught, and before she could stop them, tears rolled down her cheeks.   
  
""Bella..."" Daisy's voice was barely a whisper.   
  
Arabella immediately reached for her hand. ""I'm here,"" she said softly.   
  
""I... missed you,"" Daisy murmured, her voice hoarse.   
  
Arabella clutched her hand like a lifeline. ""I missed you too. I thought if I worked hard, I could give you a better life. But I was wrong. I never should've left you alone. I swear, I'm not going anywhere again.""  
  
The warmth in Arabella's voice seemed to melt Daisy's tension. Slowly, her expression softened.   
  
After making sure Daisy was settled, Arabella went to sort out the payment.   
  
""The charges have already been covered,"" the nurse said with a kind smile.   
  
Arabella blinked. ""What? Who paid?""  
  
Joshua crossed her mind, but she quickly dismissed the thought. There was no way he knew about this yet.   
  
""Can you check who made the payment?"" she asked.   
  
The nurse gave an apologetic shake of the head. ""Sorry, that information's private. Maybe a family member helped out?""  
  
At the word family, Arabella's face turned to stone. She gave a short nod and walked off without another word. If someone had helped, she was going to find out who.   
  
Meanwhile, down the corridor, Meagan strolled beside her daughter, Khloe, who was fresh out of the emergency room with her face patched up.   
  
""I'm not letting Arabella walk away from this,"" Khloe snarled, bitterness burning in her voice.   
  
""Calm down,"" Meagan said sharply. ""You'll reopen your stitches if you keep flaring up like this. Be more like your sister--grace under pressure.""  
  
That seemed to cheer Khloe up. A smug smile tugged at her lips.  
  
""As long as my sister keeps shining, that's all that matters. She's the youngest dancer in the Griridge Troupe now. Daisy really thought she could outshine her? She was delusional. That broken leg was karma, if you ask me. And if my sister finds out how Arabella treated me--oh, she'll tear her apart.""  
  
""She's got a big show coming up,"" Meagan reminded her. ""Let's not distract her. One step at a time.""  
  
She tapped Khloe's nose lightly, but then her expression stiffened as she spotted Arabella ahead.   
  
Khloe saw Arabella too, and just the sight of her brought back the sting of humiliation. Her rage boiled over.   
  
Without thinking, she grabbed her studded handbag and swung it with all her strength toward Arabella's back.   
  
Arabella's instincts kicked in. Just as she turned around, a tall man came into view. With quick reflexes and strong arms, he grabbed the bag mid-air by its strap, stopping it like it was nothing.   
  
The sudden pull made Khloe lose her balance, and with a startled scream, she fell to the floor.   
  
  
Chapter 3 Grab Your Things And Come With Me  
""Khloe!"" Meagan hurried to her daughter's side, helping her up while shooting a vicious glare at the man who had shown up out of nowhere.   
  
""Who the h\*\*l are you? Arabella's new guy or what?""  
  
The man didn't bother responding. His sharp eyes gave nothing away, cold and unreadable, like the still, deep sea that hid its danger.   
  
Then he began walking toward Meagan, each step loud and heavy on the hospital floor.   
  
Meagan instinctively took a step back. Her ch\*\*t tightened, making it hard to breathe.   
  
Deep down, something told her this man wasn't just any stranger--he was trouble.   
  
Trying to mask her unease, she snapped, ""Arabella, you'd better think twice before crossing us again. You and your sister were lucky we let you stay at all! If you ever want back in, come crawling, and maybe we'll consider it.""  
  
Yanking Khloe's arm, Meagan stormed off.   
  
Arabella stood silently, watching them go. Let them stay? That house was legally Daisy's and hers.   
  
She glanced at the man and caught sight of a pi\*\*ol, just for a second, before it disappeared beneath his jacket. Her eyes narrowed slightly.   
  
Who was this guy?   
  
He turned and looked directly at her. Arabella finally saw his face--handsome as h\*\*l, rough around the edges, and those icy eyes didn't blink or soften for anyone.   
  
He gave off a vibe that screamed danger--Arabella had never felt anything like it.   
  
No surprise Meagan bolted--anyone with sense would have.   
  
""Arabella Stanley,"" he said. His tone was calm and low, but there was a chill in it that made her skin prickle.   
  
Arabella glanced him over. ""You're the one who paid for my sister, right?""  
  
He gave a faint nod. ""You're quick. Grab your things and come with me.""  
  
Arabella's brows drew together. ""Excuse me?""  
  
Who even was this guy, showing up with mystery and attitude?   
  
Before things got tenser, another man stepped in--less intimidating but equally serious.  
  
""Miss Stanley, allow me to explain. This is Mr. Asher Gordon. His father and your dad served together in the military. Before his father passed away, he asked Mr. Gordon to watch over your family. Mr. Gordon only recently returned from service and has been trying to track you down since.""  
  
That explained the military presence, the icy calm... the way he moved like someone trained for war.   
  
Arabella studied Asher again. He didn't seem threatening now, but just closed off, like someone with a wall too thick to climb over.   
  
She stayed calm. ""You got anything to back that up? Anyone can say that.""  
  
Asher reached into his pocket and pulled out a weathered photo.   
  
It showed two men in dusty uniforms--one was definitely her father. The other looked a lot like him.   
  
She stared at it for a long moment before replying, ""I'll think about it.""  
  
""Fair. Let's exchange numbers,"" Asher replied without any small talk.   
  
Arabella added his contact. His WhatsApp display was just a solid black box.   
  
Funny enough, hers was the same.   
  
A strange little coincidence, she thought.   
  
Then the assistant added her as well. ""Dominick Powell, Mr. Gordon's right hand. Reach out if you need help with anything, anytime.""  
  
Arabella gave a nod. ""Got it.""  
  
With that, the two men walked off, and Arabella made her way back to Daisy's room.   
  
Shortly after, two silent, suited bodyguards appeared at the door--they were clearly sent by Asher.   
  
Arabella didn't ask questions. She got to work helping Daisy clean up--changing her into fresh clothes and gently washing her hair, trying to fix its brittle, uneven mess.   
  
But when she saw the scars and ci\*\*rette burns covering Daisy's body, her eyes welled up again.   
  
Holding back her tears, she carefully rubbed her homemade cream onto the wounds. Then, without wasting a second, she opened her laptop.   
  
She had to find out what had happened to Daisy while she was gone, so she hacked into the villa's security system.   
  
Sadly, what she saw made her sick to her stomach.   
  
It wasn't long after Arabella left that Daisy was thrown out of her own bedroom and made to sleep in a doghouse.   
  
The cheerful, lively sister Arabella remembered didn't smile anymore.   
  
She saw footage of Daisy juggling multiple part-time jobs, only to get ha\*\*ssed and pushed around.   
  
Even so, she kept working hard and made it into one of the top universities. But during her very first semester, she ended up with a broken leg.   
  
She was studying dance, and just like that, the injury shattered everything she had dreamed of.   
  
The pieces fell into place too easily. Khloe's sister, Elissa Tucker, was in the same class. Arabella's gut told her that leg injury hadn't been some fluke.   
  
After that, Daisy barely left the house. She was treated like hired help, scrubbing floors, cooking meals, and still sleeping out in that d\*\*n doghouse.   
  
Yet every time Daisy texted her, it was the same lie. ""I'm doing fine. Don't worry about me. You just take care of yourself.""  
  
Arabella's vision blurred.   
  
While her sister was being broken piece by piece, their aunt's family was thriving. Their business had taken off, thanks to a lucrative deal with the Vanguard Group.   
  
Khloe, a middle school dropout, was suddenly a digital influencer. Elissa was famous and popular in the college.   
  
Meagan was rubbing shoulders with high-society ladies, and her husband had become some corporate hotshot.   
  
Arabella clenched her jaw and slammed her fist against the table. She didn't even feel the sting.   
  
Every bit of success she had worked for... had only served to feed that vile family's greed.   
  
And the one person she had sworn to protect had suffered in silence the entire time.   
  
  
Chapter 4 This Revenge Is Mine To Carry Out  
Arabella took a slow breath, wiped the tears from her cheeks, and her eyes turned cold, like a fire had been snuffed out and replaced with ice.  
  
Her fingers gripped her phone tightly as she made a call. ""That major project--it hasn't been handed over to the Tucker Group yet, right? Cancel it. Completely."" Her voice was calm but firm.  
  
""And get to the Griridge Hospital. Now.""  
  
On the other end, Joshua sounded startled. ""Arabella? What's going on?""  
  
""You'll see when you get here. Bring a few things with you.""  
  
True to form, Joshua didn't waste time. Less than half an hour later, he rushed into the hospital, and the moment his eyes landed on the girl in the hospital bed, he froze like a statue.  
  
She looked so much like Arabella--same face, but all color drained, bruised, battered, her body wrecked like it had been thrown away and forgotten.   
  
Joshua's fists clenched. ""Who did this? Tell me who it was. I'll make them pay, I swear it!""  
  
That was the sister of a preeminent figure... and they treated her like this?   
  
Arabella didn't flinch. ""I'll handle it myself. Slowly,"" she muttered, picking up a pair of sc\*\*sors from the table.   
  
Before Joshua could react, the sc\*\*sors had already cut through her long, silky hair. The strands dropped to the floor in silence.   
  
He stared, stunned. ""Arabella... you're not actually...""  
  
""I am,"" she said. ""This revenge is mine to carry out.""  
  
Joshua swallowed hard, goosebumps rising on his arms.   
  
The way she said it--it was clear. H\*\*l was coming for someone.   
  
Arabella glanced at him. ""Also, what do you know about the Gordons?""  
  
""The Gordon family?"" He immediately straightened.   
  
""They're legendary. Way beyond the top elite families. Super wealthy, but incredibly discreet. I've only ever worked with the right-hand man of their current CEO.""  
  
""You mean Dominick Powell?"" Arabella asked casually.   
  
Joshua's jaw dropped. ""Wait, you know Dominick? Don't tell me... are you saying the Gordons were involved in what happened to Daisy?""  
  
Arabella gave him a blank stare before calmly explaining Asher's connection and what he had said earlier. Joshua slapped his thigh, clearly overwhelmed.   
  
""Asher Gordon? If it's really him, then yeah, no one's faking that. He leads the family. Rumor has it he's ex-special forces, quiet as a ghost, but deadly. If someone crosses him, they don't get a second chance.""  
  
Arabella didn't react. She just stared at the floor, her thoughts turning in circles.   
  
Then she spoke, steady and cold. ""You should head out now. Also... sell my villa.""  
  
Joshua hesitated. ""That place... that's your parents' home. Are you sure?""  
  
Arabella looked over at Daisy's fragile frame. ""She was tortured in that house. There's no comfort left there. Just get rid of it.""  
  
Her voice cracked slightly. ""And if possible, find a buyer who's impossible to deal with.""  
  
Joshua gave her a long look, then nodded. ""Understood. I've got a bunch of properties lined up. If you ever need a place, it's yours.""  
  
""Thanks.""  
  
She didn't look up, and Joshua, sensing she needed space, quietly slipped out the door.   
  
Left alone, Arabella gently held Daisy's hand and murmured, ""I swear, everyone who hurt you... I'll make them pay for it tenfold.""  
  
That night felt endless, and sleep didn't come.   
  
The next morning, Arabella stood quietly outside a dance studio at Griridge University's dance department, listening through the open door.   
  
""Elissa, things have been so dull without that pathetic girl around,"" someone inside snickered.   
  
""I know, right? No one to fetch us coffee, no one to mess with. It's no fun without a punching bag,"" another chimed in.   
  
Peering through the glass window, Arabella spotted Elissa in the middle of the dance studio.   
  
Years ago, Elissa had been just a pale, skinny kid. Now she was dressed in a flowing white dance outfit, all elegance and grace, like something out of a dream.   
  
Surrounded by classmates, Elissa flashed a gentle, modest smile at the comments. ""Guys, don't say that. Let's not be mean.""  
  
""You're too kind, Elissa,"" Joyce Lambert, her good friend, scoffed. ""That girl sponged off your family for years. If it were me, I'd have thrown her out of your house on day one.""  
  
Arabella narrowed her eyes slightly.   
  
Calling it their house? Seriously?   
  
That place belonged to her and Daisy. Elissa and her family were the ones living off of them.   
  
Elissa tilted her head, her voice syrupy sweet. ""She's my cousin, after all. Her parents passed away. If we didn't take her in, she would've had nowhere to go.""  
  
Her fake compassion earned gasps of admiration from the crowd.   
  
What a generous soul, they all seemed to think.   
  
The loud chatter in the dance studio instantly stopped the moment Arabella walked in.   
  
""Daisy?"" Joyce blinked in surprise.   
  
She stared at Arabella, stunned. She looked the same, but... something about her felt different now.   
  
  
Chapter 5 Got Yourself A Su\*\*r Daddy  
The dance studio fell silent, as if someone had hit pause.   
  
Every single eye was locked on Arabella, but she acted like she didn't see a thing and confidently made her way to the back, where she began stretching like it was just another day.   
  
Joyce's jaw clenched. ""Daisy, you've got some nerve showing up out of nowhere like this!"" Joyce barked, marching over and swinging a sharp kick at her.  
  
""Just because we've gone easy on you doesn't mean you're not taking orders from us!""  
  
But Arabella moved with ease, dodging the kick without breaking a sweat. Joyce lost her balance and hit the floor face-first with a loud, painful thud.   
  
""You dodged me?"" Joyce screeched in disbelief. Her face turned red with fury as she raised her hand to s\*\*p Arabella.   
  
But just like before, Arabella slipped out of reach like a shadow. Joyce's swing caught nothing but air, and she stumbled forward, grabbing her lower back with a wince. ""D\*\*n it!""  
  
""My bad,"" Arabella said gently, her voice almost too soft to catch.   
  
Joyce wanted to explode, but something about Arabella's calmness made her hesitate.   
  
She didn't dare swing again. Instead, she snapped, ""What are you just standing there for? Get over here and help us stretch already!""  
  
""So, Daisy's really back,"" she thought smugly. ""Still the same pathetic errand girl.""  
  
Arabella's gaze briefly darkened, but she gave a polite nod like an obedient student.   
  
She knelt beside Joyce and began helping her with leg stretches. Joyce smirked. ""You look even sadder than before. Honestly, it's pathetic.""  
  
But then, a painful scream cut through the air.   
  
Joyce's leg jolted, and she broke into a cold sweat, grabbing her thigh. ""My leg... what the h\*\*l? Did you snap my leg?""  
  
The class crowded around her in a frenzy.   
  
""Is she alright? Someone call for help!""  
  
""Look, the teacher just walked in!""  
  
Their panic was cut short as the teacher entered the room.   
  
Arabella still had Joyce's leg in her hands. Calmly, almost casually, she gave it a subtle twist.   
  
""Ah!"" Joyce screamed even louder, nearly in tears from the pain.   
  
""What's going on in here?"" The teacher frowned, scanning the chaos.   
  
""My leg! It feels broken... I can't--"" Joyce wailed, then blinked in confusion. Just seconds later, she could move it again. ""Wait... what?""  
  
""You look fine to me."" The teacher shot a look at Joyce--one that wasn't exactly sympathetic. She had seen enough of these girls' antics over the years.  
  
""I don't care what drama you're cooking up on your own time, but today's important. The Griridge Troupe selection is happening. The dean and senior faculty will be here shortly, so I expect everyone to act like professionals.""  
  
""I swear, I..."" Joyce began, trying to protest.   
  
""That's enough."" Elissa cut her off, stepping forward with an easy smile. ""Let's not waste more time. Joyce, calm down.""  
  
Elissa's tone made it clear--this wasn't the time to pick fights.   
  
Joyce had no choice but to bite her tongue and swallow her anger, though her glare at Arabella could have burned through steel.   
  
The teacher clapped her hands, and class began.   
  
During the last twenty minutes, a few other teachers showed up to observe.   
  
By the time class ended, the room was filled with a mix of nervous energy and excited chatter.   
  
""God, I really hope I get picked. Dancing alongside Elissa would be a dream come true.""  
  
""Elissa, don't forget us when you're famous!"" someone teased.   
  
Elissa gave her signature angelic smile. ""Of course not. You're all my people.""  
  
Then someone dropped a name that made the entire class go silent. ""They say Isabella might be watching today.""  
  
Gasps rippled through the room.   
  
Even Elissa blinked in shock, her breath catching. Isabella Wallace was the icon of modern dance.   
  
Her performances were legendary, her choreography unrivaled. Just being seen by her could open doors.   
  
""If Isabella notices me, that's it. That's my breakthrough,"" Elissa thought, her gaze sharpening with quiet ambition.  
  
But then someone spoke up, disrupting the mood. ""I saw Daisy dancing earlier. Honestly, she wasn't bad at all.""  
  
Joyce scoffed loud enough for the room to hear. ""Daisy? Please. She's pathetic. No way she'd get picked.""  
  
Turning her attention to Daisy, she said, ""Hey, what are you still doing here, anyway? Go get our lunch. You remember our order, right?""  
  
Without a word, Arabella nodded and walked off, her tall frame moving with a silent elegance despite the slump in her shoulders.   
  
""Ugh. Even the way she walks is irritating. Does she actually think she's all graceful or something? What a complete eyesore!"" Joyce sneered.   
  
By the time Joyce, Elissa, and the rest of their group showed up at the cafeteria, laughing and cracking jokes, Arabella already had their meals prepared.  
  
Her eyes quietly scanned each of them--calm, blank, giving nothing away. But in her mind, she was taking note of everything.   
  
Joyce, whose father ran the Lambert Group, was spoiled beyond belief and filthy rich.   
  
Next to her was Kenzie Marsh--the meek, glasses-wearing music student who practically worshipped the ground Elissa walked on.   
  
And behind them, the two guys were followers, plain and simple. They were all muscle without a mind.   
  
Joyce looked at the food Arabella had bought and narrowed her eyes. ""Well, well. Where'd you get the cash, huh? Got yourself a su\*\*r daddy? I thought you were broke, freeloader.""  
  
Joyce kept running her mouth but still dove into the food--everyone was starving after dancing all morning.   
  
However, midway through eating, something went terribly wrong. Joyce coughed violently, bl\*\*d trickling from her lips as she clutched her throat, her eyes wide in panic.   
  
The others followed suit, gasping, hands around their necks, as if something sharp was tearing through their throats.   
  
""It burns--what's happening?"" they wh\*\*zed, struggling to speak as pain ripped through them.   
  
Elissa stared at her in disbelief, still holding her throat. ""Daisy... what did you do?""  
  
""That little bi\*\*h's getting revenge!"" Joyce screamed, losing it completely. ""You think Elissa letting you tag along means we'll go easy on you? You're dead!""  
  
Furious, she flung her food tray at Arabella, while the two boys beside her instinctively lunged forward, ready to grab her without hesitation.

1miytse,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1miytse/aita_for_breaking_up_with_my_boyfriend_27m_on_a/,AITA for breaking up with my boyfriend 27M (on a student visa from Europe) of 1 year who brought up marriage after receiving news that his work permit application was denied?,"Hi guys. I was dating my boyfriend for about a year until recently and I'm still torn about the decision I made to break up with him. I was confused about his intentions and level of commitment.

There had been other problems in the relationship as I felt he was giving me minimal effort. Physical chemistry and relationship satisfaction overall was great and we spent nearly every day together. He did not plan dates or take me out to dinner, though I was fine with that because I love staying in and enjoying one another's company too. I paid for at least half of nights out/dinners and Ubers including our first technical date. He did take me to the movies once.

Within the first few months he acted nonchalant about commitment and said he didn't know what he wanted and that he didn't want to hurt me but that he really liked me and wanted to ""go with the flow and see where things go."" He was persistent every day and always reached out to me first asking when I am next free and from the beginning we had great chemistry and mutual interest in each other.

I had told him that I'm looking for a long lasting monogamous relationship that leads to marriage. I've learned to vet the men I'm with more thoroughly to avoid wasting years of my life as in the past. I asked a lot of questions. It seemed like he hadn't thought much about his future. When I asked him his life goals, purpose, he gave one or two word answers, or seemed stumped as if he hadn't considered it much before.

Like when I asked what do you think is your idea of the roles and responsibilities of each person in a relationship, he said ""to love each other."" I thought that was sweet but it left me wondering and I asked what else but he had nothing else to share. When I asked about his goals, dreams hopes for life, he just said ""to gain life experience I can teach my kids."" It was never detailed and he didnt seem interested in going deeper. This is someone who usually talks a lot, usually.

Nearing the 10th month mark, whenever I asked him what he sees for himself in the future he would give one word answers like, motorcycle, and other material things, but at no point did he mention me or a vision of our future together in any way so I felt insecure about his genuine commitment, from what I have been researching about relationships and behaviour. Sadly despite my age, I have trouble deciphering people's true intentions and give them the benefit of the doubt, especially if I love someone.

He was in trade school and he said he attended school just to stay in the country, but that he wasn't really interested in pursuing the trade itself. He was at the same time working the desk at a motorcycle repair shop part time. I'm a nurse and have my own full time job and am highly independent. He told me he loved to cook and cooked for his family back home all the time and that he wanted to spoil me and make me food. He cooked for me twice in the year we were together. I don't cook much but would have the beverages and snacks he likes in the fridge often when he came over to my place, and would bring him snacks to work. One time, after I brought him coffee and two egg sandwiches, he said he was happy about it but that it made him even hungrier so he's going to order more food for himself. I was working on my charts a block down the road.

About a year into our relationship he told me he was distressed that the immigration lawyer assigned to him gave him bad news, that the motorcycle shop-initiated work permit application wouldn't be approved. I felt for him and said I wanted to help him. I'm career flexible so I was excited to suggest we could work together or open a business or find a way to sponsor him another way. He said ""nah I don't want to go the work route anymore."" A few days later, during one of our walks, he casually says ""I want more with you"" briefly and then went into detail talking about his immigration status and asking me how I felt about marriage or going common law.

He knows because of my neurodivergence I struggle with vetting peoples intentions and I asked, ""I'm not accusing you of anything I just need logical proof, how do I know you're doing this for me and not just for the status?"" He didn't say anything, like he was stumped. He did get upset and I felt he mocked me for ""needing more proof."" I said I was uncomfortable with the level of investment he had put in the relationship previously, and I said that I would need to meet his family and more of his close friends, perhaps from back home, before making such a big commitment. He got upset and said he doesn't have the money to buy a ring but that even if he did ""you're the type of woman who needs a ring on each finger and even then wouldn't be convinced."" I felt this was disrespectful and said I needed some time to think.

The morning after, he woke up earlier than me and was restless. I asked what was wrong and he said he needs to ""show me something."" He took me to my living room where I had prepared a large white board and markers for him the night before, since he had been talking about needing to sit down and plan things out for himself. He briskly drew out Monday through Sunday and made a table showing me his schedule, in black ink. This is something I was intimately familiar with down to the hour, as we had been spending most days together. He was irritable, writing down his work and school schedule and then started writing down my name in multiple slots throughout the week, over and over, in the slots between work and school, in red ink.

For the two weeks before the breakup, during that time, I had vacation and we were spending most of our days together. Initiated by him. He briefly complained about not being able to go to this expo he was looking forward to, he really wanted to go get free stuff but also to meet up with his ""girl friends"". I had found out a few days before that he went to see one of his girl friends, and lied to me about it three times, after he gave me the silent treatment for 5 days after one of our previous arguments. He made the decision to stay with me on expo day to talk about our problems and make up. Now, he was writing out the days of the week and my name with a red marker, pointing out how much time he spends with me, and that he doesn't have time to himself. He raised his voice, and I told him I'm uncomfortable with the intensity and that maybe we should take a break and cool off. He kept pointing at the weekly schedule as if I owed him something, looking back maybe he was mad I didn't automatically agree to his casual ""proposal"" the night before and somehow felt it was not justified considering the time he had invested in the relationship.

Instead of calling me later or reaching out, like I had always done first during our prior disagreements, I did not hear from him for a week. I told him previously that I need a partner who will actively engage in repair and resolution, and that the silent treatment for me is a dealbreaker. I have an anxious attachment and it is literally physically painful being in the dark or being ignored by my partner. I gave it 1 week and decided that if I didn't hear from him, I would shut off my feelings and consider it the end of the relationship.

After 2 weeks, I realized he had written in the notes app, rather than texting or calling Me. He wrote a long text that did not address any of our issues or concerns, just shared how he felt in a way that was so vague, it could have applied to any relationship or circumstance. He took no accountability for his actions, including the silence, showed no empathy for me or self awareness of the time it took for him to reach out. I did not respond.

I bumped into him a week after that, and told him I need a partner who I can trust to be by my side, who invests in the relationship by actively repairing and acknowledging my feelings and boundaries. I told him that I had grown tired of his empty words, offering to cook, to take me out, to do this and that and be this and that yet he never followed through. For example once I needed help with a financial issue, and he was enthusiastic and said he will bring his laptop to my place after work and we would sit down together and find a solution together. When he came by later that night, the brought his guitar and made no mention of our previous plabs. I told him I also need a man whose word I can trust, and found it difficult to trust him when he lied about seeing his girl friend when we had an argument instead of discussing it with me. Both of us were cheated on in the past and we discussed how transparency was important. I said I wanted real partnership, and loyalty, because that's what I have to offer.

A week later I reached out to see if he was interested in repairing things. He did not respond for a whole day. At this point I had enough, and sent him a long message telling him I will be moving on. He never responded. 2 weeks later he posted some of our private memories on social media (only him and I could know because they were all inside jokes or special moments), with the title ""best memories for now"" though he never called, texted, or contacted me again. I loved him and despite acting in what I thought was a rational way, I miss him so much and genuinely loved him. I didn't want to be used. 

Summary: Am I the asshole for telling my boyfriend I would need to meet his family and more of his friends first, and see more effort in repairing and investment in the relationship before marrying him  while he was in a vulnerable position at risk of being deported? I genuinely loved him, I am heartbroken but want to respect myself. Thanks.",2,1754467813.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

Ai cũng biết Financial Times là một trong những tờ báo chuyên về kinh tế nổi tiếng nhất thế giới với những bình luận và suy đoán kinh tế hay nhất, ngày 18-11-2024 tờ Financial Times đã có môt bài với tựa đề : ""**Why Vietnam risks ending up a big loser from Donald Trump’s tariffs""**

**""Tại sao Việt Nam sẽ trở thành kẻ thua cuộc lớn** **nhất từ chính sách thuế của Donald Trump""**

Bài báo nói sau khi Lão Trump đắc cử TT Mẽo thì Lão sẽ thực hiện các chính sách thuế quan trừng phạt nhắm vào những nước có thâm hụt thương mại và gian lận hàng hóa giúp đở cho chính sách Trung quốc +1 của Tàu cộng , các đòn thuế quan của Trump ko chỉ là những thỏa thuận thương mai bình thường mà nó còn là các đòn trừng phạt kinh tế vào những quốc gia phụ thuộc vào Mẽo nhưng không công bằng với Mẽo: 

""**Việt Nam từng là một trong những quốc gia hưởng lợi nhiều nhất từ cuộc chiến thương mại của Donald Trump với Trung Quốc trong nhiệm kỳ đầu tiên của ông. Tuy nhiên, theo cảnh báo của các nhóm doanh nghiệp và các nhà phân tích, Hà Nội có thể trở thành “nạn nhân của chính sự may mắn đó” nếu tổng thống đắc cử hiện tại thực hiện những lời đe dọa áp thuế tràn lan khi ông quay trở lại Nhà Trắng.**

Trong những năm gần đây, Việt Nam đã ghi nhận thặng dư thương mại lớn thứ tư với Mỹ — chỉ sau Trung Quốc, Mexico và Liên minh châu Âu — khi các nhà sản xuất toàn cầu chuyển nhà máy ra khỏi Trung Quốc để tránh ảnh hưởng từ các mức thuế mà Trump áp đặt.

Tuy nhiên, thành công nhờ chiến lược “Trung Quốc cộng một” lại đặt Việt Nam vào vị thế dễ tổn thương. Nền kinh tế của Việt Nam hiện phụ thuộc nặng nề vào Mỹ, thị trường chiếm gần 30% tổng kim ngạch xuất khẩu của cả nước.

“Việt Nam hiện có khả năng sẽ bị giám sát chặt chẽ hơn, đặc biệt là đối với những mặt hàng quá cảnh qua Việt Nam nhằm né tránh thuế áp lên hàng hóa Trung Quốc,” ông Marco Förster, Giám đốc khu vực ASEAN của công ty Dezan Shira & Associates tại TP. Hồ Chí Minh cho biết.

Ông Trump đã cam kết sẽ áp thuế 60% đối với hàng nhập khẩu từ Trung Quốc và lên tới 20% đối với hàng hóa từ tất cả các quốc gia khác. Các nhà kinh tế của ngân hàng OCBC (Singapore) đã cảnh báo rằng tăng trưởng kinh tế của Việt Nam — vốn ở mức 5% vào năm ngoái — có thể giảm tới 4 điểm phần trăm nếu những biện pháp này được thực thi.

“**Nếu Việt Nam bị áp thuế, tác động có thể sẽ là thảm khốc đến nền kinh tế của họ khi phụ thuộc quá nhiều vào thị trường Mỹ**,” ông Förster nhận định.

**Các doanh nghiệp đang lo lắng.** “Một số doanh nghiệp Hàn Quốc tại Việt Nam đang quan ngại về khả năng chính quyền Trump mới sẽ áp thuế,” ông Hong Sun, Chủ tịch Hiệp hội Doanh nghiệp Hàn Quốc tại Việt Nam, cho biết. Hàn Quốc từ lâu đã là một trong những nguồn đầu tư trực tiếp nước ngoài lớn nhất tại Việt Nam, và tập đoàn điện tử Samsung là nhà đầu tư lớn nhất tại quốc gia này.

Ông Hong cho biết nếu Washington áp thuế lên hàng hóa Việt Nam, các doanh nghiệp Hàn Quốc có thể sẽ trì hoãn hoặc cắt giảm đầu tư và sản xuất tại đây.

Các quan chức Việt Nam hiểu rõ những rủi ro tiềm ẩn từ chính sách thương mại thù địch của ông Trump. Tổng thống Việt Nam, ông Lương Cường, đã đưa ra một lời cảnh báo ngầm tại Hội nghị thượng đỉnh Diễn đàn Hợp tác Kinh tế châu Á - Thái Bình Dương (APEC) ở Peru vào tuần trước rằng “chủ nghĩa cô lập, chính sách bảo hộ và các cuộc chiến thương mại chỉ dẫn đến suy thoái kinh tế, xung đột và đói nghèo”.

“Hiện nay, hơn bao giờ hết, điều quan trọng là phải vượt qua tư duy 'trò chơi có tổng bằng không' và cảnh giác với việc chủ nghĩa dân tộc làm lệch hướng các quyết định chính sách,” ông nói.

**Dù cả khu vực Đông Nam Á đều hưởng lợi từ cuộc chiến thương mại Mỹ - Trung, nhưng không quốc gia nào thành công trong việc thu hút đầu tư như Việt Nam, nhờ vị trí địa lý gần Trung Quốc, chính sách thân thiện với doanh nghiệp và các ưu đãi hấp dẫn.**

Lượng vốn đầu tư nước ngoài vào Việt Nam đạt 36,6 tỷ USD trong năm ngoái, trong khi thặng dư thương mại của Việt Nam với Mỹ tăng vọt lên hơn 104 tỷ USD — gần gấp ba lần so với mức 38 tỷ USD vào năm 2017, khi ông Trump bắt đầu nhiệm kỳ. Thái Lan đứng thứ hai trong khu vực nhưng còn cách khá xa, với thặng dư gần 41 tỷ USD.

Quan hệ Mỹ - Việt đã được củng cố kể từ sau khi ông Trump rời nhiệm sở. Năm ngoái, hai nước đã nâng cấp mối quan hệ lên mức “đối tác chiến lược toàn diện” — cấp độ ngoại giao cao nhất mà Hà Nội dành cho một quốc gia. Tổng thống Joe Biden gọi Việt Nam là “một cường quốc quan trọng trên thế giới và là quốc gia dẫn dắt trong khu vực thiết yếu này”, đồng thời dỡ bỏ nhãn “thao túng tiền tệ” mà Trump từng áp đặt.

Washington cũng đã ủng hộ các nỗ lực tăng cường sản xuất chất bán dẫn tại Việt Nam, như một phần trong chiến lược hạn chế khả năng tiếp cận công nghệ chip tiên tiến của Trung Quốc.

Các chuyên gia cho rằng Việt Nam có thể tăng cường giám sát các khoản đầu tư từ Trung Quốc hoặc tiến hành điều tra chống bán phá giá để làm dịu lập trường của Trump, hoặc thực hiện các bước nhằm thu hẹp thặng dư thương mại, chẳng hạn bằng cách mua thiết bị quân sự, máy bay dân dụng hoặc khí tự nhiên hóa lỏng (LNG) từ các công ty Mỹ.

“Thách thức lớn hơn là nền kinh tế tương đối nhỏ của Việt Nam chỉ có giới hạn trong việc tăng mạnh nhập khẩu từ Mỹ,” ông Peter Mumford, Giám đốc khu vực Đông Nam Á của Eurasia Group, nhận định.

“Về mặt đầu tư trực tiếp nước ngoài (FDI), Hà Nội có thể tăng đầu tư vào Mỹ ở mức khiêm tốn, nhưng điều này khó có thể làm Washington bớt lo ngại về vấn đề thương mại,” ông nói thêm.

**Hà Nội đã duy trì quan hệ thân thiện với cả Washington và Bắc Kinh thông qua chính sách đối ngoại không liên kết, được gọi là “ngoại giao cây tre”.** Tuy nhiên, nếu gia tăng mua hàng từ Mỹ, Việt Nam sẽ phải thận trọng để tránh làm phật lòng Trung Quốc — đối tác thương mại lớn nhất và là nước láng giềng của mình.

Đầu tư từ Trung Quốc cũng đã tăng mạnh — cùng với dòng vốn FDI nói chung — tăng 80% trong năm 2023. Trung Quốc hiện là quốc gia có số lượng dự án mới lớn nhất tại Việt Nam trong năm nay.

Ông Förster lưu ý rằng nhiều hàng hóa Trung Quốc đang được trung chuyển qua Việt Nam “để né thuế, đôi khi thông qua các quy tắc xuất xứ mơ hồ hoặc thậm chí là gắn nhãn ‘Sản xuất tại Việt Nam’ giả”.

**Và kết quả đã đúng như Financial Times nói thừ tháng 11-2024, thuế quan sẽ ảnh hưởng nghiêm trong thế nào đến kinh tế xứ vịt**

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Yomiuri Giants vs. Tokyo Yakult Swallows: A Tale of Saves, Strikes, and Yakult’s Embarrassing Midfield Tantrum**

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for a clash of NPB titans: the Yomiuri Giants, fresh off their 5-2 win over the Swallows, vs. the Tokyo Yakult Swallows, who are probably still reeling from that loss… and wondering if their mascot needs therapy. Let’s break this down with the precision of a forkball and the humor of a postgame interview with a pitcher who just gave up a walk-off homer.

---

### 1. Parse the Odds: Giants Have the Edge, But Don’t Bet Your Bat on It

The Giants (-1.5 runline) are the clear favorites across the board, with decimal odds hovering around **1.72** (5.7% vigorish adjusted). That translates to an implied probability of **\~58.3%** to win, while the Swallows sit at **\~42.5%**. The total is set at **6.5 runs**, with slightly better value on the **Under** (odds \~1.85-1.91). Why? The Giants’ bullpen, led by Cuban fireman **Raidel Martínez** (1.56 ERA, 31 saves), is as reliable as a vending machine in a Tokyo subway. Opposing batters might as well bring a resignation letter to face him.

But here’s the twist: The Swallows have a **1.5-run advantage** on the spread, meaning they need to outscore the Giants by *two runs* just to cover. Given the Giants’ recent **6-5** comeback win (thanks to Richard’s heroics and a walk-off by Yuki Kawada), this isn’t a team that folds quietly. They’re like a stubborn umbrella in a monsoon—useless, but unyielding.

---

### 2. Digest the News: Cubans Shine, Swallows Stumble

Let’s start with the **Giants’ Cuban connection**. Raidel Martínez is on a **Rolling Stone-level** hot streak, with 31 saves this season and a personal best of 43 last year. His closest rival, Shinya Matsuyama, has 28 saves—so even if Martínez had a off night, he’s basically already won the title. Meanwhile, **Yuki Ogawa** (6-4 record) is proving he’s more than just a “filler” reliever. His 155 km/h fastballs have become as reliable as your morning coffee—except this brew gives you strikeouts instead of jitters.

Now, the **Swallows**… well, their only Cuban link is a **pinch-hitter named Ariel Martínez**, w

“Coffee is not rushed — it’s patient, like the farmers who wait for each cherry to ripen under the sun.” 🌿

In Yemen’s high mountains, coffee farming is an art passed down for generations. Farmers tend terraced plantations, hand-pick cherries at peak ripeness, and sun-dry them using ancient techniques that preserve the beans’ unique flavors.

Every sip of Beanquisite’s Yemeni coffee tells this story — a taste shaped by altitude, heritage, and patience.

It thirsts for blood, biting at any skin exposed to air, pinching apple red into unscarved faces, heightening every minor inconvenience each time it grows a new layer of ice. 

In Cape Breton, my family used to live in an old barn house- one that during the winters, became a meat locker, in which we would light a fire in the old wood stove and feed it every scrap of paper we had, all to avoid stepping out into the wasteland. My mother and I always wore multiple layers of sweaters and socks, even as the fire strung up beads of sweat over our eyebrows. We dared not step away, into the empty parts of our house that hummed without a pulse, and stayed still, freezing and corpse-like, as we waited in limbo, for spring to awake, with the promise of tall sweetgrass and the harmonized song of cicadas and the croaking peepers.  

Waiting for me at the end of January was my birthday. We celebrated in the living room by the stove. My cake sat on the coffee table, the tiny flames being put to shame compared to the inferno that beamed behind the tempered glass, ready to swallow us whole. We all sat on our knees as our faces were set hauntingly aglow like jack o lanterns, as the dreadful song was sung to me. My father had announced three days earlier that he was not happy being in this family anymore and was leaving to go stay in our summer cottage, far across from the other side of the island. Behind my blue and pink gift bag was an old dirt-stained suitcase, standing alone in tandem, as though it had been rotting since its last trip to Disneyland, waiting, just to be brought out for this final purpose. When it came time to blow out my candles, I held my breath for a long time, fitting in as many selfish wishes as I could before putting the flames out of their misery. After being plucked from the icing, we placed them on paper towels where they looked like bodies laid out for investigation after a crime scene, oozing pink and green blood. 

The forecast called for no more snow for the rest of the night. I forced myself to shed tears, hugged my father goodbye, and decided to run away for a little while, into the woods with my friends Caitlyn and Ray. I managed to get my car down the steep driveway and away from the misery. After a cautioned drive, I parked along the side of the highway where they waited for me, shivering in their thick puffer jackets and winter boots. We pushed our way through the brush until we reached the railway tracks, rusted and slick with ice. We followed them forward, deeper into the forest. We stepped between the sleepers, careful not to lose our footing. My lungs burned and my legs ached, and my pants got stuck on thorn bushes, as silent conversation evaded our lips, filling the empty air as the sun dipped down to touch the remains of trees, setting the branches on fire, like autumn, a little too late. 

We had finally come to a clearing, behind an old barn with Bras D’or lake painted behind it. Caitlyn and I sat down on a frozen hay bale and leaned against each other for support as Ray stepped a ways away to light a cigarette. We watched as the smoke drifted towards the old barn. During the summer, Ray took us here to count the horse skulls that were hidden in the fields and collect empty beer cans to have rock throwing competitions. We each held each other up, becoming each other's life rafts on the island, that at times felt too small to harbor the dreams we had, that anchored us down when life threatened to push us away. Sometimes it felt like it was just a matter of time before my head was fully submerged in the ocean.  

Caitlyn and I had met through mutual friends at various social outings. We connected over sickening amounts of Tim Hortons’s French vanillas as she told me stories of Munich, Germany. I was slowly falling in love with a place where I had only stepped foot in my imagination and in glimpses through her stories, and I was not nearly satisfied. Caitlyn told me how she was gay and had come to admit it to herself after dating many boys and kissing a few girls, but her parents did not know. And for this reason, she was not ready to go back home. The night I met Ray was the night Caitlyn invited me to a party happening at the house where she was temporarily staying, which just so happened to be Ray’s home. People were taking turns getting high behind the shed and making out, while others were in the living room doing shots and playing Mario kart, surrounded by empty vodka bottles. When the music ached in our ears and we could no longer make out what each other were saying, we ran upstairs. Caitlyn knocked on Ray’s bedroom door asking if we could come in. Ray was lying on the floor with a bong next to her and a bottle of pink whitney. She was soulfully singing ‘Rehab’ by Amy Winehouse and staring at the ceiling. We sat on the floor with her and passed around the bottle until it was dry. Ray was blunt and had no filter, but she made us burst out laughing and snorting. Soon after, we all became a trio. It was just us against the world. 

The sky began to bleed a deep bruise color and stars began to litter the sky. Each moment that passed us by created a transcendent energy. Ray tossed her cigarette onto the ground and kicked some snow over it before joining us on the hay bale. We drank in the stars, watched our breaths escape, invisible in this pocket deep in the woods that was hidden away from the world. For each star I cared to count; I promised repeatedly: that soon we would see the summer again and that we would still be holding each other’s hands even as the world fell apart around us. That we would be okay. ""I want to stay.” I whispered to no one, but Ray heard. “I don’t want to freeze to death” she said back. At some point, the time came for us to retrace our footsteps, hopelessly with phone flashlights on. I would return to my lifeless house while Caitlyn and Ray returned to theirs. I would dream of that night, recall the promises I made, and how alive I felt, as I now breathe out, with grass stains on my heels and cicadas calling me from the brush with their siren sound. And no less, I still thirst for the stars and the rusted railway tracks that are rumored to soon carry trains once again. Our transcendent place, resting eternally in our minds, echoing in my heart. 

And now I miss the winter. ",1,1754466779.0,DestructiveReaders,0,1.0,False
1miykdk,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1miykdk/terrible_decision_thoughts/,Terrible Decision. THOUGHTS?,"I (25M) was broken up with my (24F) 7 weeks ago. I made a terrible decision that cost us a lifetime. We had been together for 3 years full of love and dreams of a future together. We complimented each other so well and had no doubts of wanting to grow old together. I could go on about how happy we both were but that would be unfair as I ruined it all.

We were going on a trip overseas to celebrate my graduation and the end of our long distance. I was at school the last year and while she would visit often the majority of the time of the year we were apart. But it was always worth it and our spark remained strong as we enjoyed supporting and communicating all throughout the day. About a week before we left I got a call from a number I didn’t recognize, turned out to be my old ex who I thought was blocked we broke up in 2020 it was a terrible relationship I was an awful version of myself because of her. I had immense anxiety and would throw up when I’d see her knowing I didn’t want to be with her but was stuck. Anyways she starts saying how she is so happy to hear I pursued my dreams and that she is happy I am doing well (I don’t know how she knew anything about me it had been 5 years and I don’t have social media and she lives far away thankfully). She says I know you have a girlfriend and I have a boyfriend but I’m driving by and would like to get coffee and hear about your experience at university and your sports. Something in me impulsively wanted her to see me doing well and looking healthy and I agreed. It was a decision of who and insecurity, I had no desire or lust for this person but rather wanted to say “look at me now”. The stupid thing is the biggest reason I was doing so well is because I found true love in my partner. But like an idiot I go for coffee, get there, talk for about 10 mins then when I mention how my girlfriend and I are going on this trip, my mind clicks and (WTF AM I DOING). I get up in a slight panic and tell her I’m leaving, I wish you well, please don’t contact me because this was a mistake. I could tell that left a spiteful taste in her mouth even though this was painted as two mature people who have no feelings towards each other anymore. 

I panic and don’t tell my girlfriend before we leave on the trip soon after. I thought I could try and pretend I never saw this person because it was 15 mins I wish I could take back so badly. I knew that what I did was wrong but was too selfish to tell my partner. We are about 5 weeks into our trip and my partner wakes up to a DM from this ex saying she saw me and I cheated. My partner is a beautifully sensitive girl with some anxiety and this led her to believe I hooked up with this person and she booked a flight home immediately. I tried to tell her how sorry I was and that we went for coffee and it was nothing to do with any feelings or lack of love for her but she was so frantic and I knew I just needed to be there for her and not shove this truth in her face and act defensive. She left and while we cried at the airport and said we loved each other once last time, she was gone. She started no contact after telling me we can’t be together anymore and I haven’t heard from her other than one call when I was coming home that was about 3 hours long.

So I called this ex and asked her why did she feel the need to do this or use wording to make it seem like something it wasn’t. She started crying saying she has had feelings for me the last 5 years, writing me letters, and thought maybe one day we could be together. So she wanted this to happen. I can’t believe I gave her the power to be believed over me. So yeah I really fucked my and her life up we were supposed to be together forever. This was never a moment I pondered but it came to me and I was selfish and let my ego tell me it was fine to do this because of my intentions. Not okay at all. So the only way I show her love now is by not bothering her and building myself into the stable man I should have been. She’s been on trips this whole summer being celebrated and getting all the attention she wants and deserves. I’m sorry B, I still love you just as much every day and would love for you to know the remorse I feel for hurting you and making such a dumb decision that has cost us a lifetime. I think she still believes that I slept with her and is telling everyone that. I live my truth everyday. I’ve become a student of love I educate myself everyday, training my body and mind excessively so I have a chance to sleep at night.

In the midst of university life, between late-night convenience store runs and quiet work sessions, they learn that building something together means slowly taking down the walls around themselves.

—

While most of his classmates are focused on job offers and GPA rankings, a reserved Computer Science student spends his nights tucked away in a corner of campus, quietly building a game he’s been dreaming of. The code is clean, the mechanics polished, but the project feels empty. What it lacks is heart—the art.

After weeks of failed attempts to find an artist willing to collaborate, he’s pointed toward someone, an art major with a reputation for being talented, reckless, and impossible to work with. Their meeting isn’t ideal. The coder arrives early, files organized and ready; the artist shows up late, coffee in hand, unimpressed. Their first conversation feels more like an argument than a partnership.

But as the days pass, their awkward collaboration slowly settles into something quieter. They stay late in campus studios, side by side, bickering over designs but sharing convenience store snacks in between. Their dynamic shifts, not with grand gestures, but with small, domestic moments: a borrowed stylus, a shared playlist, a game that starts to reflect the best and worst of them both.

Without realizing it, the space between them softens. The project becomes a bridge between structured code and messy sketches, between two people who thought they were too different to work together. And somewhere in the quiet of unfinished projects and late-night walks home, something real begins to take shape.

""Beta Austin, I want to break the bond with Alpha Brown and reclaim my pack.""

Austin's frown deepened, the weight of old warnings heavy in his expression. He had cautioned me against merging our packs and allowing Brown to become alpha.

""You made a grave mistake, Luna,"" Austin murmured, his voice thick with regret. ""You shouldn't have trusted him or surrendered everything that rightfully belonged to you. Now we're nothing in this pack because of that decision. Alpha Brown will never release you easily.""

A month ago, I had suffered severe blood loss from a stomach ulcer. That day, the healer made countless desperate calls to my mate, pleading for a blood transfusion since we shared the same rare RH-negative blood type. Something we had discovered before we mated.

When Brown finally answered, his voice was dismissive. He claimed he was in a crucial council meeting and couldn't come.

But through our mind-link, agony tore through my wolf's consciousness. Brown wasn't at any council meeting. He was tangled in bed with Mia, my foster sister. It felt as though he was deliberately punishing me for bearing his mark.

The emotional pain was only the beginning. Every hour he pushed into her, visions of their intimacy flooded my mind, accompanied by Brown's whispered words of devotion to Mia. Words he had never spoken to me.

Blood soaked the sheets beneath me, spreading rapidly until half the blanket was stained crimson. I nearly died from blood loss, saved only by a good Samaritan who came to my rescue.

I had finally awakened from my fantasy, and this time, I was ready to walk away for good.

""Put your trust in me one last time, Austin,"" I whispered urgently. ""We have to find a way to make him reject me and get ourselves out of this nightmare.""

I had known for years that my mate never loved me.

That evening, I returned to the villa to find Brown arranging fresh flowers in the living room. White lilies and baby's breath in an elaborate bouquet.

He had never cared about flowers before. During our first anniversary, when I had filled our home with roses, he complained about the pollen making him sneeze and threw them all away.

But when Mia mentioned she loved floral arrangements, he suddenly developed a passion for floriculture.

Tonight, he stepped back to admire his handiwork. ""You're late. Did the pack council meeting drag on through another moon phase?""

Even in casual clothes, Brown's presence filled the room with an effortless elegance that had once made my heart flutter.

I kept my expression carefully neutral. ""The alliance negotiations with the Northern packs required more time than expected.""

He nodded absently. Work was always my excuse, and he never questioned it.

""Why don't you go shower and come down for our anniversary dinner? I've asked the omegas to prepare your favorite dishes.""

As I headed toward my chamber, my eyes caught sight of our mating ceremony photograph. It was now shattered on the floor.

""Oh, I forgot to mention,"" Brown said casually, ""Mia arrived earlier and insisted on spending time with us since it's our anniversary week. She'll be staying with us for now. She accidentally broke the photograph while the omegas were moving your things to the omega quarters.""

My blood chilled. ""Moving my things?""

""You know she's timid and can't sleep alone at night, so I told her to take your chambers."" His tone was matter-of-fact, as if displacing his own wife was perfectly reasonable.

A dull ache stirred in my chest as my wolf, Jayla, growled inside my head, demanding I let her rip him apart. But I pushed the rage back. I couldn't afford to ruin everything now.

""Sis, you're back!"" Mia's voice echoed sweetly as she emerged from what used to be my room.

Brown moved quickly to cover the fresh hickeys on Mia's shoulder, but I still caught a glimpse of them. His abrupt movement shoved me hard, and I fell backward into the broken photograph frame. Glass shards pierced my skin, drawing a sharp hiss of pain.

Brown didn't even notice my cry as he pushed Mia back inside, grabbing the door handle and locking it behind them.

Watching him shut me out, I let out a bitter laugh.

I wasn't even bothered by their fairytale romance anymore. All I wanted was to find a way to make Brown reject me and reclaim my pack.

If it were an outsider, I would have fought for my marriage long ago. But since my foster sister was the one destroying it, I refused to battle her over a man who had never chosen me. Not even once.

When my father was still alive, he always said I would marry into the Raymond family, as foreseen and sealed by the Moon Goddess. After he died, I was adopted by my foster parents who happened to be Brown's omegas and Mia's parents.

Brown Raymond and Mia had been childhood sweethearts. Just before their planned mating, I entered their lives, unaware of their relationship.

But out of greed for my inheritance, my foster parents devised an alliance with Brown to make me fall for him and become his Luna, so they could seize control of my pack through him.

""Two people can't be alpha of one territory,"" my adoptive mother had whispered in Brown's ear. ""I advise you marry her and subdue her powers.""

Their plan worked flawlessly. They were promoted to Betas, and he promised to make Mia his Luna eventually.

When he proposed to me, I was overjoyed, believing I was fulfilling my father's dying wish.

Unfortunately, I discovered their betrayal too late. After I had lost everything and everyone in my pack who once looked to me as their Alpha now despised me because of how Brown treated and demoted them all.

All those years of supposed love had been nothing but pretense to steal my inheritance. Marrying me was simply the fastest way to claim everything my bloodline held. Love was never part of their plan.

As these bitter thoughts intensified, a spark of realization flickered across my face. I pulled out my phone and rushed to the balcony to make a call.

""I think I've found the perfect way to make Alpha Brown reject me,"" I said, unable to hide the hope in my voice.



CHAPTER TWO

""Luna,"" Austin's voice came sharp and low through the phone. ""What plan is that? Remember, if we're caught with whatever scheme you're devising, we're doomed forever.""

""There's absolutely nothing to worry about. Just trust me. All I need right now is your cooperation.""

Austin Hudson. My father's former Beta, whom Brown had demoted to Omega the moment he promoted Mia's parents to Beta positions.

""The plan is for you to leave visible hickeys on me. That would drive Brown insane and force him to reject me. Don't you think it would work?""

""Luna, if anyone stands to lose from this plan, it would be you,"" Austin warned gravely. ""Remember, Alphas can manipulate their way out of scandals, but their Lunas cannot. You would indeed be rejected, but cast out with nothing like an outcast. He'll surely reject you, but you might never get another chance to rule us again.""

I dropped the phone from my ear at his words, clutching the balcony rail as doubt crept in. Suddenly, laughter erupted from my former room as the door opened slightly.

I turned to find Mia holding my husband's arm tightly, smiling at me with false sweetness.

""Browny, I think Olivia is still angry with me for breaking the photograph and taking her room. Maybe I should just leave tonight. I don't want her feeling uncomfortable on her anniversary,"" Mia said with practiced innocence.

Brown dotingly tapped her nose and replied gently, ""You worry too much, Mia. She can't still be angry over such trivial things. Am I right, Olivia?""

""It's just a photograph anyway. You don't need to disturb yourself. You might be the one in the next one,"" I replied coldly.

Brown didn't pursue the conversation further. It might have looked petty.

At our anniversary dinner table, I stared at the dishes prepared by the omegas. Every single item was Mia's favorite. Not one was meant for me. Most I was allergic to, and the rest I despised, which Brown knew perfectly well.

It felt as though I was merely a guest at my own anniversary celebration while Mia, my sister, was the one being honored.

Now it made sense why Brown would request mushroom soup whenever he left for long meetings, despite hating mushrooms himself.

I looked up at my husband, who was completely focused on Mia, giggling like a schoolboy. This man I had been married to for four years apparently didn't know I couldn't eat any of the food on the table.

The meal was half-finished before Brown noticed my empty plate.

""These are your favorites. Why aren't you eating?"" he asked with feigned concern.

I stared at the plates before me. Seafood pasta in cream sauce, mushroom soup. My throat began to constrict just looking at them.

I raised my eyebrows at my supposed mate. ""I'm allerg...""

Mia smoothly stole the remaining words from my mouth, throwing a pitiful look my way. ""I don't know if this is the right time to ask, but I've already discussed this with Alpha Brown,"" she said, rubbing his palm gently.

Mia expertly redirected his attention to herself, and his concern about why I hadn't eaten vanished instantly.

My anxiety spiked as I waited to hear what this was about.

Brown then informed me, ""My uncle, the Alpha King, is holding a council meeting among the Alphas of the Northern region.""

""You and Mia will be accompanying me. Unfortunately, Mia's luggage was lost at the airport. Everything she brought for the meeting is gone.""

I shifted uncomfortably in my seat, feeling as though I were sitting on fire. So this was the real reason he had brought Mia back. Not for our anniversary, but for this important meeting.

Who would have thought I'd been believing his lies until now?

I had been aware of this meeting all along and had even prepared for it, while I was deliberately kept in the dark about Mia's involvement.

With mucus forming in my throat, I asked, ""When is this meeting?""

""Tonight at nightfall. You have enough time to make arrangements. As I mentioned, she lost everything at the airport. She's the same size as you, and the family's traditional Luna dress is the only piece that would work right now. Let her wear it for the meeting.""

""I even had to persuade her to wear it, considering she doesn't usually share belongings with others. You've only worn the Luna dress once, so she should take it.""

I immediately shot Brown a look of mixed surprise and disappointment.



CHAPTER THREE

Not only had I been uninformed about the meeting she was attending, but now she wanted my Luna dress as well.

That dress was a sacred family tradition, worn only by the Luna of the pack. Knowing this, Brown still wanted her to wear it.

""You can have it,"" I said lightly, though my heart was breaking. ""I'll have the omegas prepare the dress for you.""

Besides, I had no intention of putting it on my body ever again.

""You don't need to do that. I already did,"" Brown announced, his words piercing my heart like a blade.

He had no right to do that. Since I headed the female omegas, they only took such significant orders from me. The dress could only be released with the Luna's approval.

""Thanks, Olivia,"" Mia cut in sweetly. ""I knew my stay here would be memorable because of you.""

I didn't utter another word as I stood to leave the table, but Mia stopped me.

""You don't mind taking some pictures of us, right? Since it's your anniversary, I want to preserve this memory,"" she said, extending her phone toward me.

Memory, indeed.

Mia hurriedly moved closer to Brown and clung to him like a parasite. In the past, when Brown and I went on dates, Mia was always the one taking pictures for us. Now the roles were reversed.

I took several photographs in various poses of my mate with his lover until they were finally satisfied and left the table, smiling at each other.

After watching their retreating figures, I turned to leave but accidentally knocked over a small ceramic coffee kettle on the table.

The kettle wobbled precariously, then toppled over completely. Scalding liquid cascaded down, splashing across my bare feet and ankles. I inhaled sharply, stumbling backward as I steadied myself against the table's edge. The burning sensation spread across my skin like wildfire.

Hot coffee seeped between my toes and pooled on the floor around me, but Brown had already turned away, his attention captured by Mia as they smiled and chattered over their photographs. They disappeared around the corner, leaving me alone with my agony.

How different things would be if this had happened to Mia. Brown would have swept her up immediately, called for ice, fussed over every possible burn mark. He would have insisted on a doctor and the finest care money could buy.

But I remembered a time when I would have received such care. When my father ruled as Alpha, omegas rushed to tend to my every need. A single scratch would have summoned healers and worried attendants. Everything changed the day my parents died. Now, despite my mating to Brown, I remained invisible. I had been forgotten for far too long.

I quietly left the dining area and returned to the omega quarters where I now belonged.

The afternoon stretched endlessly as I tended to my wounds, unsure if I even wanted to attend the meeting. I vowed to myself that I would find a way to break free from Brown and reclaim my pack as soon as possible.

An omega interrupted my brooding thoughts, touching my shoulder gently.

""Luna, I have something important to tell you. Alpha Brown ordered us to prepare the family's traditional Luna dress for your sister. Are you just going to sit there and watch her wear it?""

""It's fine, Julia. It's just a dress. She can wear it...""

Julia cut me off, her surprise evident. ""No, Luna, it's not just a dress! Can't you see what they're planning? This council meeting held by the Alpha King is strictly attended by the five allied Alphas of the Northern region and their Lunas, where the Lunas are supposed to formally greet the Alpha King.""

""It's a tremendous honor to meet with him because nobody except his family knows what he looks like. Rumors say he's the most powerful wolf alive, and no one dares challenge him.""

""From my perspective, this can only mean one thing: Alpha Brown is positioning Mia as his Luna, and he's trying to get the other Alphas to recognize her as well. At this point, Luna, if nothing is done, you'll be no different from us omegas.""

Julia stared at me desperately before tears pooled in her eyes and streamed down her cheeks uncontrollably.

I stood before the mirror, staring at my reflection as tears dropped onto the tiles below.

""I have to meet this Alpha King myself, but how?"" I thought desperately.

There was only one way out of this nightmare I had created by trusting Brown. I had to give him a taste of his own medicine.

I pulled out my phone and sent a message to Austin: ""Make arrangements for an expensive and breathtaking dress for me.""

The time had come to remind everyone exactly who I was.



CHAPTER FOUR

Nightfall descended upon the council hall as the meeting concluded far sooner than Olivia had anticipated. Having spent the entire day organizing the proceedings without stopping to eat, her stomach growled with fierce hunger. Desperate for sustenance, she forced herself to gulp down the shellfish soup that had been prepared for the guests.

Almost immediately, unease crept through her body as hives began spreading across her skin. Frantically searching her handbag, she thankfully found some antihistamines. Olivia rushed toward the nearest refuge, an empty storage room stocked with bottles of water, and grabbed one. But just as she was about to open the bottle, the sharp clang of the closing metallic door startled her. She stumbled, and both the water and tablet tumbled from her grasp, the medication dissolving completely on the floor.

""You really have the nerve to show up tonight,"" came a cold voice from behind her. ""I specifically took that dress from you to ensure you'd stay home, yet you still had the audacity to find something else to wear just to steal my spotlight.""

""First it was my man, now my rightful position. You have no shame, do you?""

Doubling over as the itching intensified, Olivia began scratching frantically at her inflamed skin while fever gradually overtook her weakened body. Her voice emerged weak but defiant: ""Mia, please, it's you Brown cherishes now. I'm nothing to him.""

Mia released a cold, bitter laugh. ""I'm not buying a word from you, you pathetic fool. Unlike you, I know when to retreat from loving a man who couldn't care less about me.""

""By tomorrow morning, the headlines will read 'Olivia the Thief.' You'd better prepare yourself for the consequences, because from what I know, the Alpha King would never spare an intruder on his property.""

""Please, Mia, don't lock me in here! Help... somebody help me!""

With a twisted smile, Mia hurried to the back door and informed one of the guards that she'd spotted an intruder entering the storage house.

The relentless itching prevented Olivia from calling for help as her body turned red and bumps formed from her desperate scratching.

When it was finally time for everyone to leave, Brown noticed Olivia's empty seat and grew concerned. Mia blinked at him with feigned innocence. ""Browny, do you think she got upset because I wore her Luna dress? I would have chosen something else if I'd known.""

Hearing this, Brown frowned. ""Don't worry about that. I should have made you my Luna long ago anyway. You're so much better; you know when to give me space and never make me feel annoyed. Let's go home. I need to settle this once and for all."" He interlaced his fingers with hers, and they departed together.

That night, Olivia remained locked in the prison cell until morning, deliriously mumbling about seeing the Alpha King. He hadn't attended the meeting. It was his Beta and the council elders who had presided, as the Alpha King had left to resolve an urgent matter.

The next morning at the prison, Olivia was barely recognizable due to the swollen bumps covering her face. The chief guard interrogated her about her identity.

""I'm Alpha Brown's Luna,"" she whispered, her voice barely audible.

The chief guard immediately alerted Elias, the Alpha King's Beta, who called Brown to explain the situation. As Brown's voice echoed through the phone, tears pooled in Olivia's eyes.

""I'm not married, and even if I were, it certainly wouldn't be to a lunatic,"" he said coolly before ending the call without hesitation.

He did this to avoid being associated with the theft allegations and to maintain favor with his uncle, harboring irrational fear of someone only a few years his senior.

""I reject you too, Brown,"" Olivia sobbed through her delirium.

Enraged by what he deemed a despicable lie, Beta Elias ordered them to confine her without food or water.

After days of dry fasting, her ears became blocked, her vision blurred, and her legs grew unsteady. She collapsed from exhaustion and high fever.

When she finally opened her eyes, a gray ceiling met her bewildered gaze.

""What happened to me?"" she whispered as fragmented memories flashed before her. Suddenly, a dominating aura enveloped the entire room, making her wolf Jayla whimper. The dark energy radiating from the newcomer turned everything gloomy and cold.

Through the stench of her own blood, her nose detected his alluring, masculine scent. Olivia's mouth watered as she tried to whisper the word her wolf was screaming in her head:

""Mate!""

I have found my mate...



CHAPTER FIVE

Her wolf Jayla's tail wagged enthusiastically, cooing inside her head. Olivia had thought her wolf had fallen into a deep slumber, but seeing her fated mate revived Jayla's broken heart, bringing her back to life.

""How long have I been here?"" Olivia asked the man who continued staring at her without blinking.

""Four days,"" he said raspily. ""I'm truly sorry for how my guards treated you. They will be severely punished for their actions.""

""No, it's fine. They acted that way because they weren't certain of my intentions.""

His voice was as alluring as his presence. Half his face remained hidden in shadows, yet he was undeniably good-looking.

Recognizing him as her only escape from Brown, Olivia decided not to waste this opportunity. Four days had passed without even a word from Brown.

Tears filled her eyes as she locked her gaze at Lucianus. He gently pulled her upright, allowing the tears to flow freely down her cheeks.

""Why are you crying?"" he asked, tucking her hair behind her ear. ""I can't bear to wait patiently all these years only to find you in such distress.""

Upon hearing this, Olivia raised her eyes to meet his, tears of joy streaming uncontrollably. She had thought her father was mistaken about what he'd said over the years, but looking at this man sitting beside her now, every wound in her heart began to heal.

They were interrupted when a woman in her early fifties entered with a feast, and to Olivia's surprise, every dish was among her favorites.

""How did you know I like all of these?"" Olivia asked in amazement, savoring every aroma.

""Your body was in terrible condition when I returned, and the healer said it was due to allergies. I had my men research everything about you, and the least they could gather was from your social media posts.""

After three hours with the Alpha King, Olivia requested her handbag before leaving. Checking her phone, she discovered there were no missed calls or even a text from Brown.

""Let my guards escort you,"" Lucianus declared.

""I still have matters to settle, and I don't wish to raise any suspicions about us.""

Immediately after she finished speaking, Lucianus opened his palm to reveal a large, visible scar.

He explained that he had always felt pain in his palm over the years, and when he sought answers, he was told his mate was suffering. The pain had been so intense during his week-long trip that he'd rushed home for treatment, but it had faded the moment he laid eyes on her, leaving only the permanent scar.

""I have found you, mate, and I won't let my palm bleed anymore. I'm giving you one week to finish whatever you need to do before you return to me. I will discipline my nephew myself.""

Olivia nodded eagerly as he pressed a kiss to her forehead, and then she departed.

As soon as Olivia entered the omega quarters, she saw Mia burning items in front of the building. Mia flashed her a look accompanied by a smirk.

Olivia ignored her and went inside to pack her belongings. To her shock, the room was empty except for her parents' keepsake, which lay broken on the floor.

Olivia dropped to her knees in tears, desperately trying to piece it back together. It was the only remaining memento of her parents. No pictures, no jewelry, just this.

As she struggled to repair the keepsake, Mia's voice interrupted her efforts.

""You made it back alive. I thought the Alpha King would have used you as dinner.""

Olivia ignored her, continuing to sob uncontrollably.

""Well, I thought you wouldn't be returning, and my puppy needed a place to stay. So I was instructed to remove every trace of you so my puppy wouldn't have difficulty settling in. Sorry, but that's how much Browny loves me. He's a man who proves his love through actions.""

Olivia, who had been suppressing her anger, finally spoke up: ""How does that make you feel? Because as far as I'm concerned, you're using a hand me down from me. I think you shouldn't push me too far, because if you do, you'll leave me no choice but to tell the whole pack how evil your parents are, and how you've been frolicking with my mate.""

""He loves me and will soon make me his Luna,"" Mia declared, beating her chest in assurance. ""You might be his Luna now, but I own his heart. Aren't you even curious why he denied you and left you to die?"" Her tone turned syrupy and cruel. ""Because we went out of town to get me a puppy. So you see, you're nothing compared to me.""

The realization that Brown had humiliated her and left her to die over a puppy hit Olivia like a physical blow.

Unable to endure any more, Olivia moved to leave, but Mia immediately pulled out pepper spray and doused her face with it.

Having just recovered from a severe allergic reaction, Olivia found it impossible to breathe as she collapsed to the ground.

Through her haze, she heard Brown's voice as Mia dramatically dropped to the floor, leaving the spray canister beside Olivia's body.

At that moment, the door burst open. ""What's happening here?"" Brown demanded.

Hi yall, I’m writing this on behalf of a close friend who is in a really tough situation right now. She was recently fired from a local cafe she worked at in Tennessee and by the looks of it is being targeted publicly by the owner after said termination. 

She’s worked there for a few months and was let go via text message with the owner citing vague issues like “emotional breakdowns,” “not aligning with the team culture,” and a misinterpreted safety issue. My friend also has severe anxiety and possible autism, which could have attributed to some of the behavior cited. No formal accommodations were offered, and she wasn’t given any official warnings or write ups prior to being fired. After she was fired, several people (some of whom had been customers or knew her personally) started leaving 1 star reviews about issues such as stale coffee, dirty furniture, and poor atmosphere. In response the cafe owner began posting replies to these reviews claiming they were part of a retaliatory campaign. She also posted on the cafe’s Facebook page, calling her “the opposite of kindness and love,” and asking people to report the reviews. In the comments she named my friend and allowed others to pile on with attacks. 

This has caused my friend a huge amount of distress. She is panicking, afraid of getting sued, and feels publicly humiliated. 

Our questions are:

-What legal options does she have at this point?
-Would a cease and desist help?
-Should she peruse an EEOC complaint or look into a civil harassment case?
-Is the cafe owner violating any laws by publicly naming her and accusing her like this?

Any advice, especially from a TN legal perspective, would be greatly appreciated. 

Thank you in advance.",1,1754466382.0,legaladvice,0,0.99,False

I’d like to benchmark their performance against similar cafés, but I’m having trouble finding financial benchmarks. 

In addition to coffee and drinks, they prepare and sell sandwiches and hot food, and resell bagels and muffins. And they have a wine and beer license.

Does anyone know of publicly available data or reports on café financials (especially on university campuses, and in VHCOL areas)?

Industry benchmarks for KPIs like COGS %, labor cost %?

Or are there communities where café or coffee shop owners/operators share insights?  (I'm relying on ChatGPT's suggestions so far.)

I could use some help with this. I have a text bundle that contains a list of products, all separated by commas, like this:

What I need is to convert this into an array where each item is a separate entry, like:

    Baking Paper - Armada 15m (x2)  
    Beer - 11 Days Pale Ale 4 x 4 pack (x2)  
    Coffee instant - Moccona 200g (x2)

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **KIA Tigers vs. Lotte Giants: A Tale of Two Comebacks (With a Side of Kuromi)**

The KBO’s latest showdown pits the resurgent KIA Tigers against the Lotte Giants, who just got shut out by these very Tigers three days ago. Let’s break this down with the precision of a catcher framing a pitch and the humor of a mascot trying to explain baseball to a toddler.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Statistical Tightrope

The moneyline odds are a chaotic dance of near-equality. Most books list the Tigers and Giants at **1.87-1.95**, implying implied probabilities hovering around **51-50%** (depending on the bookie’s vigorish). The spread? KIA is a **1.5-run favorite**, which feels like a dare given their recent dominance. The total runs line sits at **8.5-9.0**, suggesting bookmakers expect a low-scoring battle—perfect for pitchers, and terrible for anyone who bets on “home run derby” as a strategy.

Why the spread? KIA’s recent **3-game winning streak**, including a **2-0 shutout** of the Giants, has them playing like a team possessed by the spirits of every KBO legend. Their pitching staff? Finally tight as a drumhead, allowing **max 2 runs per game in their last three**. Meanwhile, Lotte’s offense has the punch of a soggy pillow—can you say “three days in a row with zero runs”?

---

### News Digest: Injuries, Merch, and a Cat Named Kuromi

The Tigers’ secret sauce? **Adam Oller**, their ace, is back from a 40-day shoulder injury. In the first half, Oller was a force of nature: **8 wins, 3.03 ERA in 16 games**. His return is like getting your favorite barista back after a month of lukewarm coffee—suddenly, everything tastes better.

But the real plot twist? KIA’s **Kuromi-themed uniforms**. Yes, the team’s collaborating with the black-and-purple cat character for their August 19-21 games. The merch is already selling faster than a disco

EU does not charge VAT to tourists if the purchase is made from a store participating in Global Blue, Planet Tax free or equivalent. In Italy they also have the Otello system in which there is no commission. So that’s a 22% saving on coffee machine / grinder.

This official YouTube video explains how this works in Italy:

[https://youtu.be/f\_W0d41Q9-Y?si=4LRAlTl6K7dJhSjH](https://youtu.be/f_W0d41Q9-Y?si=4LRAlTl6K7dJhSjH)

The way this works is you pay VAT upfront, the store gives you a tax free invoice with your passport details and a code. When you leave the country, you show the tax free  invoice & unopened item at customs, and then you get the refund back on your credit card.

So I am trying to find stores in EU (ideally in Italy) that sell coffee grinder or coffee machines and give tax free invoices to tourists that let you claim back the VAT. Has anyone tried this?

I want to buy a coffee grinder on my trip there. EU does not charge VAT to tourists if the purchase is made from a store participating in Global Blue, Planet Tax free or equivalent. In Italy they also have the Otello system in which there is no commission. So that’s a 22% saving on coffee machine / grinder.

This official YouTube video explains how this works in Italy:

[https://youtu.be/f\_W0d41Q9-Y?si=4LRAlTl6K7dJhSjH](https://youtu.be/f_W0d41Q9-Y?si=4LRAlTl6K7dJhSjH)

The way this works is you pay VAT upfront, the store gives you a tax free invoice with your passport details and a code. When you leave the country, you show the tax free invoice & unopened item at customs, and then you get the refund back on your credit card.

So I am trying to find stores in EU (ideally in Italy) that sell coffee grinder or coffee machines and give tax free invoices to tourists that let you claim back the VAT. Has anyone tried this? Are you aware of such stores that give these tax free invoices?",3,1754465454.0,espresso,4,1.0,False

I'd argue that you don't even need the 1zpresso hand grinder since the french press does well with coarser grinds. 

I think the beans do most of the work, but i am really surprised how this has turned out.

(A young airman walks through an empty town, devoid of humans but seemingly NOT devoid of human life)

1️⃣ Storyline: 

I love this episode, but not for its storyline. It’s not really a criticism, it’s just the reality of the type of episode this one is. And as my ratings show, the series opener is incredibly atmospheric and unsettling, but it doesn’t have much of a plot. A cynic could argue it deserves an even lower storyline rating, but there IS a defined narrative - it just doesn’t manifest until the final scene. 

Score: 5/10 

—————————

2️⃣ Atmosphere:

Ooh baby. I LOVE the deeply unsettling atmosphere of this one. From that first scene in the diner with the steaming cup of coffee, to the blinking theatre lights at the end, to the near-mishap in the telephone booth (EEEK!)… In my humble opinion, this episode drips with atmospheric tension. 

Score: 9/10

—————————

3️⃣ Existential Terror:

I have always felt that the deepest darkest fear of most humans, at least in my experience, is loneliness. I don’t mean, “man I miss my family” or “aw, I wish I had more friends”. I mean, the absolute soul-shredding deep pain that it would be, to be utterly alone in existence. 

Score: 8/10

—————————

4️⃣ Creepiness:

There is a great deal of unease here, and some bits of spookiness, but nothing that really sticks with me from a frightfulness perspective. The mannequin, sure. And again, that phone booth scene - yes. But most of the creepiness comes from the atmosphere itself which I’m not going to double count. 

Score: 5/10

—————————

5️⃣ Lesson:

At first I was set to give it a 1, as there is no real moral or ethical sermon. But there is a lesson to be learned here, and that is - human connection, imperfect and inconsistent and hurtful and downright destructive as it can be… human connection can also be one of the deepest sources of joy, comfort, and peace, that we experience in this life. So cast it aside, at your own risk. I still won’t give this episode a very high “Lesson” score, as this message on human connection largely comes from my own thoughts and less from Rod’s mouth, however. 

Score: 3/10

—————————

6️⃣ World-Building:

Not gonna lie, I chuckled at this category. And I’m torn! I mean, it DOES build out a world - a whole town gets explored! But… it’s of course, an empty world. A facade. Now, it’s for a very specific reason obviously, but I won’t give the episode credit for something that it doesn’t do, even when the lack of it is intentional. 

Score: 4/10

—————————

7️⃣ Acting:

I’ve given low ratings to a few categories, but this is the first score I’ll give where I actually do feel like the episode could I have been better. The categories that I’ve previously discussed with a 5 or lower score, got that rating for very specific reasons generally. But the acting in this is not great. It’s not terrible, I don’t even think it’s particularly bad. But it’s not good either. Does it hold me back from loving “Where is Everybody”? Not a chance. But it’s the weakest link of the show, in my eyes. And, as you’ll see in other write ups, I hold the Twilight Zone to a pretty high bar of its own making. In future episodes, we will experience acting that is PHENOMENAL. Not just for the 60s, but straight up great performances. 

Score: 3/10

—————————

✅ Weighted Total Score:
 37 Of a possible 70


Well, there you have it! My first write up. I’ll be honest, when I first tallied up the ratings, I felt a little bummed. The score seems to imply that I don’t think it’s a great episode, and I absolutely do think it’s either top-tier or second tier at worst, out of all the twilight zone episodes. So, maybe this is a scenario where even my favorites don’t crack 55-60. Who knows? I guess we shall soon find out 😉

What do you think? 🤷🏼‍♂️ Which category do you most agree with, and which category do you most hate my opinion? Let me know! I went your feedback. 🙌🏼

Aesthetic medicine, also known as ‘Cosmetic Medicine, ‘’ Appearance Medicine,’ or ’Anti-Aging Medicine,’ is a growing medical field focusing on minimally invasive procedures to improve patients' appearance. It differs from plastic surgery and involves treatments for healthy adults who choose to undergo these procedures.

“ The purpose of aesthetic medicine is to achieve patients’ satisfaction with their requirements related to appearance, elimination of complexes, and restoration of self-esteem. To preserve beauty, one must take care of it from the earliest to the old age. Some patients want to delay the external signs of the aging process or to improve their external appearance due to the work they carry, while others, as a result of internal stress and mental reluctance to contact people, complexes, psychosis, neuroses, and other mental disorders. Yet another group are patients after accidents, as a result of which have suffered permanent injuries, and those who came to the world with congenital defects” [(1)](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation?paperid=54282).

While aesthetic and cosmetic surgery aim to improve appearance, their focus and methods differ. Aesthetic surgery focuses on repairing body parts damaged by birth defects, injuries, burns, or illnesses. Aesthetic surgeons work with patients with physical abnormalities, focusing on function and appearance. Cosmetic surgery, on the other hand, is optional and is done solely to enhance appearance without any medical reason.

# Aesthetic Medicine Treatments

Aesthetic medicine treatment can be categorized into three primary categories: conditions and problems, aging concerns, and aesthetic enhancements.

**Conditions and Problems**

 Acne, a common skin issue, can be managed through treatments like chemical peels, laser therapy, or topical medications. Laser resurfacing, dermabrasion, or dermal fillers can minimize scarring from acne, injuries, or other causes.

Rosacea, a chronic skin condition characterized by redness and visible blood vessels, can be treated with pulsed-dye laser therapy or topical medications.

***laser resurfacing***

Laser resurfacing uses energy-based devices to improve skin texture and appearance, addressing fine lines, age spots, and uneven tone. However, it does not correct sagging skin. There are two main types of laser resurfacing: ablative and nonablative. Ablative laser resurfacing removes the outer skin layer and heats underlying tissue to stimulate collagen production, improving firmness and elasticity. Common types include CO2, erbium, and combination lasers. Nonablative laser resurfacing stimulates collagen with less invasiveness and shorter recovery but yields subtler results. Examples include Er and IPL.

***Dermabrasion***

Dermabrasion uses a rotating device to remove the outer skin layer, leading to smoother, younger-looking skin. Dermabrasion reduces fine lines, acne scars, surgical scars, age spots, and wrinkles and can be combined with other cosmetic procedures for more comprehensive results. Before dermabrasion, your doctor will numb your skin. You may also need a sedative or general anesthesia. After the procedure, your skin will be sensitive and blotchy for weeks, with full recovery taking about three months.

**Dermal filler**

Dermal filler injections are a nonsurgical cosmetic procedure that smooths wrinkles, restores facial volume, and enhances features. The treatment takes less than 30 minutes with minimal recovery time, and results last months to years, depending on the filler type and location.

**Aging concerns**

Several factors contribute to the body's internal and external aging, often called proper and improper aging. Telomeres are important in cellular aging; as the body ages, telomeres shorten, leading to cell aging and tissue deterioration.

The speed of aging and the onset of aging symptoms are largely determined by genetics, which is known as proper aging and is beyond our control. Factors such as the nature of one's work, climate conditions, and lifestyle choices play a significant role, with the most notable external influences being UV exposure (from sunbathing or tanning beds), smoking, poor nutrition, and substance use (e.g., alcohol, excessive coffee consumption).

Hormonal imbalances, whether in excess or deficiency, can also negatively impact appearance (skin, hair) and body weight. During menopause, the decrease in estrogen production, specifically 17-beta-estradiol, reduces collagen (resulting in thinner, less elastic skin).

Botox injections can temporarily relax facial muscles, reducing the appearance of wrinkles. Dermal fillers can plump facial features, fill in lines, and restore volume. Chemical peels can exfoliate the skin, promoting cell turnover and reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Intense pulsed light (IPL) therapy can address sun damage, pigmentation issues, and visible blood vessels.

Facial aesthetics includes treatments such as anti-wrinkle injections, dermal fillers, and lip fillers. It focuses on common facial concerns such as volume loss, fine lines, and wrinkles. Injectable Fillers are a popular choice for restoring facial volume and reducing wrinkles. Hyaluronic acid is a common filler to plump up cheeks, lips, and other face areas. Autologous fat, harvested from the patient's body, can also be used as a filler for a more natural-looking result.

Part 1.

”I’ve had a lot of “firsts” in my life. First car. First heartbreak. First apartment. First funeral. But I only ever had one first kiss.

And I still think about him. Almost every day.

⸻

I met Eli when I was nine. We lived two streets apart, and our moms worked at the same hospital. Some nights, when they had overlapping shifts, I’d go to his house and we’d play Nintendo 64 on this clunky old TV that had to be smacked on the side to work.

He was the weird, quiet boy with a cowlick and oversized glasses. I was the loud, overly emotional girl with scraped knees and paint-stained hands. We couldn’t have been more different. But it worked.

He was my best friend. The kind of friend who’d help you bury your dead goldfish because you were too sad to do it yourself. The kind of friend who’d walk home with you every day even though it meant missing his favorite cartoon.

He used to tell me I was brave. I used to tell him he smiled like a secret.

God, I used to write his name in the margins of my notebooks like some obsessed lunatic. ELI. ELI. ELI.

But like most childhood things, it didn’t last.

⸻

We drifted sometime in middle school. He stopped showing up to class as often. Started wearing a hoodie even in summer.

Rumors spread. People whispered about “stuff going on at home,” but I never asked. And honestly, I was too caught up in my own world to reach out.

When I finally did — sophomore year, I think — he barely looked me in the eye. Just said, “Hey,” and walked off.

That was the last time I saw him.

Or so I thought.

⸻

I walked out to the mall. But before i entered i noticed something kinda weird. I saw a guy standing in the parking lot taking pictures at me. I didn’t think much about it and went inside.

Fate, as it turns out, is weirdly theatrical. Last fall, I was walking through the mall after work. Just killing time. I stopped in front of the food court, scrolling through my phone, when I heard someone say my name.

Not “hey.” Not “excuse me.” But my actual name. Like a prayer someone forgot they still remembered.

“Melissa?”

I turned — and there he was.

Eli.

But not the skinny, shy boy I remembered. He looked… older, obviously. Taller. But also — cuter. So stupidly cute.

Like one of those boys on sad indie movie posters. Sharp jaw. Crooked smile. Eyes that looked tired but kind.

He had this lopsided haircut that didn’t quite suit him, but somehow made him more attractive. And when I smiled, he smiled back — wide and real, and I swear to god my heart skipped.

⸻

We talked for hours that night. Sat in the corner of the food court with two half-eaten slices of pizza and cups of flat soda.

We talked about school. Life. Childhood. He told me he was working part-time at a bookstore downtown.

“I like the quiet,” he said.

I told him I was finishing up college. That I was still painting. That I had thought I’d outgrow that phase, but hadn’t.

He asked if I remembered the time I climbed his garage roof and refused to come down until he swore on his Nintendo cartridge that we’d be friends forever.

I told him of course I remembered. He said he never broke the promise.

And just like that, everything that had felt dead and gone cracked open like sunlight through blinds. It was warm again. Easy again.

By the time the mall closed, I didn’t want to leave. And judging by the way he walked me to my car — neither did he.

We exchanged numbers. And he hugged me. Tight. Like he meant it.

That night, I laid in bed staring at the ceiling and smiling like a goddamn idiot. I hadn’t felt that happy in years.

⸻

Over the next few weeks, we talked constantly. Texts. Late-night calls. Spontaneous meet-ups.

We’d go for walks through the park, talk about books, music, stupid memories from middle school. He’d bring me coffee at work. I’d leave sticky notes on his bike with bad doodles and inside jokes.

It felt like falling. Not just in love — but backwards, into something soft and familiar.

And then, one night…

He kissed me.

It was after a movie. We were sitting in his car in the parking lot, wrapped in silence and shared glances. He leaned in — slow, hesitant. I met him halfway.

It wasn’t perfect. Our noses bumped. My lip gloss stuck to his mouth.

But I didn’t care.

Because it was him.

On my way home though, i noticed this black Sedan driving past me. For a moment i thought i saw someone in the driving seat holding a camera.

⸻

Anyways. The week after that was magic. I floated through days like I was dreaming.

I painted more. Ate more. Slept better. Everything felt lighter.

Until the texts stopped.

⸻

It was a Thursday. I remember because we’d planned to meet after his shift at the bookstore. I texted: “Still on for 8?” No reply.

Then I tried again. And again.

Nothing.

I assumed maybe his phone died. Maybe he got called into work. Maybe — maybe — he just forgot.

The next day, still nothing. No texts. No calls. His phone went straight to voicemail.

I drove to the bookstore. The guy behind the counter told me Eli hadn’t shown up in three days. Didn’t call. Didn’t answer when they knocked at his door.

My stomach sank.

Something was wrong.

⸻

The funeral was small. Closed casket. Lots of whispered voices. Too many tissues and not enough answers.

He had taken his own life. Hung himself in the apartment above the bookstore. No note.

Just… gone.

I sat in the back row, clutching a tissue I never used, staring at the framed photo of him at the front of the chapel. Smiling. Eyes too tired for someone so young.

His mom spoke. So did his old friend Julian. But I couldn’t get up. I couldn’t speak. I didn’t even cry.

I just kept thinking:

“Why now?” Why after we found each other again? Why after we finally kissed?

⸻

A week later, I received a package. No return address. Just my name in his handwriting.

Inside was a sketchbook.

The first few pages were blank. Then came small pencil sketches. Of me.

Smiling. Sleeping. Sitting on his couch.

Then, written across one page in the center:

“You made the dark feel far away. I wish I could’ve stayed longer.”

⸻

People always talk about their first kisses like fairy tales. Like some glittering milestone in a life full of bright moments.

Mine ended with a funeral. A sketchbook. And a silence that still hasn’t left.

⸻

Sometimes, I dream about him. We’re sitting in the food court again, eating cold pizza and laughing. He reaches out to touch my hand. And I whisper, “You promised you’d never leave.”

He smiles.

But this time, he doesn’t say anything.

And when I wake up… I’m always crying.

This text could have ended like that, but im afraid it didnt.

A few days ago, I found something else.

An old letter Eli wrote me. It had been tucked inside a book he loaned me years ago — one I never returned.

His handwriting was messy but soft. Loopy. Familiar. It made me cry just looking at it.

And that’s when I remembered the sketchbook.

I pulled it out again. Flipped to the page with the message — “You made the dark feel far away. I wish I could’ve stayed longer.”

I compared them.

And my blood went cold.

It wasn’t the same handwriting. Not even close.

The loops were too sharp. The pressure too heavy. The slant was reversed. Whoever wrote that note…

Eli hadn’t written this.

I don’t know who did. Or what did. Or why they’d pretend to be him.

But the more I think about it — the cameras in the parking lot, the car that followed me, the drawings of me sleeping — the less this feels like a goodbye…

And the more it feels like a warning.",2,1754464573.0,creepypasta,1,1.0,False

Recently, I sat down for coffee with a lesbian acquaintance of mine who’d been dumped a month earlier by a bi woman. “I just don’t feel comfortable dating bi women anymore, like I’d never be able to settle down and feel secure,” she told me, exasperated. “When they leave, they leave for men. I’m just sick of being burned by it…”
“Has anyone ever called you biphobic for feeling that way?” I asked.
Her eyes got wider than the saucer holding her cup of coffee. “Yes! Do you think I am?”

After thinking on it for a moment, I told her that I didn’t. And after having thought about it in the time since, I’m even more certain that it is harmful and reductive to instantly shout biphobia! when a gay woman declines to date a bi woman — in much the same way that I don’t believe it must be necessarily called transphobic for someone to decline a partner who doesn’t possess their anatomy of choice. No person or group of people is entitled to the affections or intimate spaces of another, and nobody should be expected or even asked to expand their own boundaries solely for the sake of inclusivity.""

The marriage remained unconsummated. Defeated, I picked up the phone and called my brother.



“I’m filing for divorce,” I said quietly.



He sighed. “Vivienne, I warned you. That man’s made of stone—no emotions, no passion. Just a lifeless suit with a pulse.”



I believed I could change him. I thought love would be enough. I was wrong.



After the call, I returned to my room—only to hear faint noises coming from Griffin’s private quarters. I followed the sound and froze at the sight.



Griffin, shirtless and on his knees, was moving in a slow, deliberate rhythm. For a second, I assumed he was with another woman. But no—it was a doll. A life-sized replica of his stepsister, Soraya.



In that instant, everything made sense. He didn’t turn away because he lacked desire. He turned away because his desire had never been meant for me.



What shattered me even more was what happened after: when Soraya struck me in the head with a wine bottle, leaving me with wounds that needed hundreds of stitches, Griffin showed no concern. All he did was ground her—for a day.



I’d had enough. Enough of being ignored, unloved, untouched.



So I made my choice. I would walk away—for good. And in doing so, he’d finally learn what it meant to lose the woman he so carelessly discarded.



\--



The key to the Maybach glinted in my hand as I closed the front door behind me.



""You're going out today?"" Griffin asked without looking up, already dressed immaculately in his usual charcoal suit, fingers adjusting the silver cufflinks with practiced ease.



I nodded, calm. “Yes.”



“What’s the plan?” he asked, brows twitching slightly. But before I could answer, he reached into his pocket and dropped the key into my palm.



“Never mind,” he muttered. “Just do something that makes you happy.”



I smiled, lips curving just slightly.



Yes. That’s exactly what I was going to do.







\---



But hours earlier, I hadn’t felt so composed.



It had started like the other failed nights. Another desperate attempt. Another wall I couldn’t break. I had tried everything—lingerie, whispered pleas, soft caresses, patience, and hope.



Hope was the cruelest of them all.



After he left me cold and untouched yet again, I stared at the unsigned divorce papers on the desk, heart pounding. Then, with a trembling hand, I reached for my phone and dialed.



Nathan answered on the second ring.



“I’m leaving him,” I said, my voice barely above a whisper.



There was a pause, long but unsurprised. “You finally see it, huh? I told you from the beginning—Griffin Martin is emotionally barren. He’s not cold; he’s void. Like someone wearing skin without a soul.”



A bitter laugh slipped out. “I really believed I could reach him. That if I just poured enough love in, something would overflow.”



“You’re not a charity case, Vivienne. You’re not supposed to fix broken people at the cost of yourself. Come to Texas. It’s warm, the water is clear, and the men there don’t treat intimacy like it’s a business transaction.”



“I’ll fly out once I’ve signed everything,” I told him.



He softened. “Good. You were meant for something better.”



When the call ended, I stayed seated in that silence. But it didn’t last. Something—curiosity, dread—pulled me to the end of the corridor.



Griffin’s sanctuary.



Always locked. Always off-limits.



But not tonight.



There was light under the door and a low, muffled noise. A sound that stopped me cold.



I pushed it open, breath caught in my throat—and froze.



Griffin knelt in the center of the room, shirtless, glistening with sweat. His body moved in a slow, deliberate rhythm. At first, I thought he wasn’t alone.



But there was no woman beneath him.



It was a doll.



Life-sized. Unsettlingly realistic. Her skin eerily smooth. Hazel eyes glassy, her long hair the same brown shade as—



No.



She looked exactly like Soraya. His stepsister.



A high-pitched noise escaped my throat, halfway between a burst and a sob, as I clapped a hand over my mouth. My legs nearly gave out.



This wasn’t the first time. I’d caught glimpses before—flashes of something I tried to unsee, moments I brushed off as hallucinations. The second time, I buried the memory.



But the third?



I felt nothing but silence. A dense, choking silence that filled every inch of my being.



I leaned against the wall and shut my eyes.







\---



The beginning was so different.



We’d met at a yacht party my brother threw—one of those events filled with people who wore money like perfume and loved hearing themselves talk. I spotted Griffin standing at the edge of the deck, sipping sparkling water as if making a statement. He was stunning. Untouchable. An enigma.



I begged Nathan to introduce us. I found ways to “accidentally” see him again. Eventually, he offered marriage—not love.



No grand gestures. No emotion. Just: “Marriage is acceptable. If you want it, I won’t protest.”



I should’ve run then.



Our wedding night was the first slap of truth. I wore red silk. Lit candles. Waited in anticipation.



He never came.



He spent the night in his study.



And it only worsened from there.



I tried everything—romantic getaways, slow dances in the kitchen, surprise touches. He pulled away each time.



One night, desperate, I slipped into his bed and curled against him.



He stood and left without a word.



Another time, I walked into his shower, soaking wet in nothing but longing.



He calmly handed me a towel and exited.



But the moment that shattered my heart entirely? The night I confessed I wanted a child.



He looked at me without blinking and said, “I am not built for emotional replication.”



What did that even mean?



For two years, I was a ghost in his house. Smiling at charity balls, preparing his meals, attending functions arm-in-arm… but going to bed cold and alone every single night.



Now I knew why.



He hadn’t rejected intimacy.



He had redirected it—toward someone else. Something else. A hollow version of a person he could never legally have.



As I stood outside that room, his voice haunted me.



“Soraya… Only you…”



The sound of my name never passed his lips like that.







\---



As I made my way to the garage, the Maybach key clenched in my fingers, his voice echoed faintly in my mind, heavy with the sting of everything left unspoken. He was already gone, off to his board meeting, his footsteps long faded into silence.



Yet his parting words lingered.



""Do whatever brings you joy.""



A quiet smile touched my lips.



Yes—leaving him for good would be exactly that.



Chapter 2



I didn’t offer another word. I simply turned away, stepped outside the house, and drove directly to the Texas consulate. Applying for permanent residency was a smooth process—especially with the influence carried by the Reid surname.



Over the past several years, our family had begun to transfer most of its holdings and investments overseas. My parents had already relocated, followed shortly after by Nathan and his wife. I had been the only one who stayed behind.



Stayed—for Griffin. But now, I was done with that too.



“It should be processed and finalized within a week,” the consulate representative informed me with a polite, practiced smile, handing over the official document.



I gave a small nod, accepted the paper, and stepped back into the warmth of daylight.



It was over. Griffin Martin—the man I had pursued for six years, the husband I had been legally bound to for two. The one I thought I could coax out of his fortress of detachment.



But he was never mine. Not truly. I had sacrificed so much for him, softened myself, toned down my fire, adapted to his minimalist, ‘clean’ way of living—even dropped red meat and wine, just to match his preferences. I shrank myself to fit the mold of his world. And yet…



No matter what I did, I couldn’t bridge the space between us. Not emotionally, not physically, not even in the places he kept most hidden.



I looked down at the stamped receipt in my hand. A thin, almost sardonic smile tugged at the corner of my mouth.



A bitter smile.



“You don’t want me, Griffin Martin,” I murmured under my breath. “But there are men out there who absolutely would.”



Later that night, I dialed a few old friends and told them I needed a wild night out. Since marrying Griffin, I had left that world behind—the vibrant noise, the music, the unrestrained laughter. I’d become someone else. Someone more muted.



But that evening, I wore a black dress with delicate straps, one that embraced every curve like a secret it didn’t want to share. Its hem swayed as I walked, teasing a glimpse of legs I hadn’t dared to show in a long time.



“Girl! What happened to you tonight?” My best friend Kayla shouted with a grin, pulling me toward the bar. “Ever since you got tangled up with that emotionally stunted mannequin, you’ve sworn off parties, liquor, everything!”



I laughed, tossing back a shot of tequila. The burn was sharp, invigorating.



“He’s not on my mind tonight,” I said, trailing my mouth across a line of salt on my wrist. “Tonight’s for me.”



Before she could comment, I slipped into the throng on the dance floor, letting the pulse of the music guide my body. I moved without restriction—hips swaying, arms in the air, head tilted back with abandon. Each movement was a rebellion against every night I lay in that penthouse bed alone, unloved.



A man brushed behind me—tall, chiseled, his shirt unbuttoned just enough to reveal a firm set of abs. I turned toward him, ran my hand across his abdomen, giggling when he smirked in response.



“Vivienne, are you out of your mind?” Kayla exclaimed, tugging me back. “That’s like, what? The fifth guy you’ve flirted with tonight! Aren’t you scared your husband’s gonna blow a fuse?”



“He’s not here,” I replied simply.



She looked uneasy.



“No, Vivienne... he is.”



I stopped.



“What do you mean?”



She leaned in close. “He’s been in the VIP section this whole time. Back corner. Watching you.”



I slowly turned my gaze—and there he was. Griffin. Eyes fixed on me. Cold. Unmoving.



Then the music stopped abruptly.



In the heavy silence, I caught the tail end of a conversation from his booth. A man sitting beside him snorted. “Griffin, your wife’s basically giving lap dances out here. If it were my girl, this place would be in flames.”



Griffin didn’t so much as blink.



He lifted his glass, took a slow sip, and responded evenly, “She knows where the boundary is. She won’t step over it.”



That hit harder than I expected. A single sentence, sharp as a blade. Was it trust? Or indifference? Did he believe I was still so hopelessly in love with him that no one else could ever touch me?



Maybe it was both.



“Wow,” the man beside him laughed. “You’re unshakable. Is there anything that can make you snap?”



But mid-laugh, the man stopped. “Hold on... where are you going?”



I turned in the same direction—and saw Griffin rise from his seat. Though his features remained calm, something in his eyes had shifted.



Something dark. Possessive.



I followed his line of sight.



That’s when I saw her.



Soraya. His stepsister.



She was near the dance floor’s edge, clad in a white dress, laughing lightly while exchanging numbers with a man I didn’t recognize.



Griffin crossed the room in three quick, fierce strides and grabbed her wrist.



“Who told you it was okay to come here? Who said you could give your number to some random guy?” he snapped.



Soraya’s eyes widened, then narrowed with resentment. “Why not? You pretend I don’t exist every day. Why do you care what I do now?”



“You really think I don’t care?” His voice dipped lower, almost guttural. “Who gave you that idea?”



“You did!” she cried, voice cracking. “You shut me out. You won’t look at me. You used to be everything to me. What happened?”



His jaw tightened. He swallowed hard, but no words came.



And I stood there, frozen, clutching my bag like it was the only thing tethering me to the earth.



Because I already understood.



He didn’t avoid her because he was repulsed—he avoided her because he was obsessed. Because being near her made him lose control.



Because this man—my husband—couldn’t make love to his own wife, but secretly owned a lifelike silicone doll crafted to resemble his stepsister in chilling detail.



Something inside me curled up and snapped. It wasn’t just heartbreak. It was finality.



I turned, ready to walk away.



But just as I reached for my purse, I heard Soraya’s trembling voice behind me.



“Griffin... can’t things go back to how they used to be? I miss the version of you that only saw me.”



His voice broke, low and raspy. “I’m married now. I can’t be with you the same way.”



And then I saw it.



The flash in Soraya’s eyes. A glint of something unstable. Dangerous.



“So if your wife disappeared... we could be together again?” she whispered.



Before I could react, she snatched a wine bottle from a nearby table and stormed toward me.



The glass shattered as it struck my head. A white-hot pain flared across my scalp. I stumbled back, barely registering that she was holding another bottle.



“You took him from me!” she screamed. “You ruined everything!”



The second blow landed even harder.



And then—darkness.



Screams fading into the distance. My heartbeat echoing louder than anything else.



Chapter 3



“You’re finally conscious,” the nurse said, her shoulders relaxing as she replaced the gauze on my forehead. “You gave us quite a scare. Two smashed wine bottles to the head—more than thirty stitches. Whoever did this didn’t just lose their temper—they meant business.”



My fingers moved reflexively to my scalp, brushing against the thick, padded layers of bandage wrapped around my head.



My voice came out raw. “Who brought me here?”



“Your best friend,” the nurse answered while checking my IV line. “She stayed by your side the whole night but had to rush out this morning for an urgent work matter. She even hired a private nurse to monitor you while she’s gone. You’ve been well looked after.”



My chest ached—not from the injury, but from the clarity.



So… Griffin hadn’t come.



I turned toward the tray table and picked up my phone with a trembling hand.



As the screen lit up, a notification from social media caught my eye.



Soraya Martin had just posted: He still treats me like a princess.



My thumb hesitated before tapping on the video.



Soraya appeared on-screen, dramatically holding out her finger like it had been maimed. “Look,” she said in a pouty voice, “I scratched myself when I broke that bottle.”



Then the camera shifted focus.



Griffin was kneeling before her, his fingers wrapping a bandage gently around the tiniest cut on her hand. He looked up with tender eyes, then leaned forward and kissed her fingertip.



“There. All better,” he murmured.



I stared at the screen, hollow. It felt as if someone had split my skull open a second time and poured something corrosive directly onto my brain.



But I didn’t cry. I didn’t scream. I just… breathed.



Then I picked up the phone and made the call.



“Hello,” I said to the dispatcher, my voice like dust. “I’d like to report an assault.”



That evening, my hospital room door creaked open. Griffin entered dressed head-to-toe in black, his face unreadable—calm on the surface, but with something dark moving just beneath.



“You contacted the authorities?” he asked, voice cool as frost. “Filed a report against Soraya?”



“I did,” I said, eyes locked on his. “She deliberately attacked me. That’s enough to press criminal charges.”



His jaw tightened. He spoke low. “She lost control. What she did wasn’t right, but I’ve handled it. It’s finished.”



“Handled it?” I gave a short, humorless laugh. “And how exactly did you ‘handle’ a near-fatal assault?”



“I told her she’s not allowed to leave the house today,” he said, as though that settled the matter.



I looked at him like he was a stranger. “You’re telling me I needed emergency surgery, and your version of punishment was putting her in time-out?”



His silence spoke louder than any excuse could.



“You’re not disciplining her,” I said, my voice rising. “You’re covering for her. You’re terrified I’ll pursue legal action, so you’re pretending to take control when in reality, you’re just shielding her from consequences.”



“You’re blowing this out of proportion.”



“I already pulled the complaint,” I interrupted. “There’s no point. You’ve got your hands in enough places to make sure she’s untouchable. No precinct in this city will lift a finger against her now.”



He didn’t deny it.



I clenched the sheets between my fists until my nails dug painfully into my palms.



I wanted to throw something. To scream. To ask why.



But the only thing I could manage to say was:



“Griffin… what was I to you all these years?”



He blinked, caught off guard.



“If I meant nothing,” I said, my voice trembling, “then why did you marry me?”



His brow furrowed. “Who said you meant nothing?”



“You did. Every single time you looked through me like I was invisible. Every time you walked away. Every night you slept in a room that wasn’t mine.” My throat tightened. “You chose me for a wife, but you couldn’t even show up when I was clinging to life?”



He didn’t answer right away. When he finally spoke, his voice was measured.



“This isn’t the moment to argue,” he said. “You’re still weak. I’ll stay here while you recover, make sure everything’s taken care of. Once you’re better, we’ll discuss a settlement. Just stop creating more drama.”



He said it like he was offering a gift. Like I was meant to be grateful for his presence.



I stared at him in stunned silence.



This man—the one I once chased endlessly. The one I thought I could teach to love. The one I gave my youth, my dignity, my body, and heart to—



Now acted like staying in the same building as me was a charitable act.



And in that moment, something in me shifted.



He never believed I’d leave. He thought I’d stay no matter how far he pushed me. That I’d be too weak, too loyal, too blind to walk away.



But he was wrong.



This time, I wouldn’t plead.



This time, I wouldn’t wait.



This time, I was done.



Chapter 4



Griffin remained at my side for several days after the incident, staying with me at the hospital. He arrived promptly each morning, bringing steaming broth in sleek, high-end flasks. He sat quietly during doctor rounds, offering his presence without needing to speak. When the pain spiked late at night, he reached for my hand and held it until the worst passed.



Had this been six months ago—or even six weeks—I might have mistaken all of it for love. I would’ve clung to it like a drowning woman to a lifeline.



But now? Now there was only a hollow stillness inside me. It’s unsettling, how you can spend six years chasing someone’s affection, only for it to all evaporate in a single heartbeat.



The morning I was released from the hospital, I walked slowly toward the parking garage, my head still tender and my chest strangely still—quiet, as if the storm had passed and left nothing behind.



That’s when I saw her.



Soraya was lounging in the front passenger seat of Griffin’s car, scrolling through her phone with a lazy flick of her thumb. Her glossy hair was tied into a loose ponytail, and she looked like she belonged there—effortless, comfortable, shameless.



The moment our eyes met, her expression soured, as if I was the intruder here.



Griffin caught the shift in her face and frowned. “Soraya, didn’t we already talk about this?”



Instantly, she changed her tune. Her shoulders drooped, her lashes fluttered, and she bit her bottom lip just enough to look remorseful. “Vivienne, I… I’m sorry. That night, I wasn’t thinking clearly. I didn’t mean for things to go that far. I just…”



Her voice cracked slightly as she turned toward Griffin. “You’ve been ignoring me for so long—ever since you got married. I thought… maybe if I acted out, you’d finally pay attention to me again.”



I said nothing. Just stood there with my hand wrapped tight around my bag strap.



Griffin turned to me, his voice steady and matter-of-fact. “Soraya’s going to be staying with us for a while. Let’s just… keep things peaceful.”



I gave a single nod, moved to the back seat, and climbed in without a sound.



During the ride home, I stayed silent as city lights painted fleeting patterns across the windshield. Griffin and Soraya sat up front, shadows shaped by the glow of passing traffic.



I rested my head against the cool window and watched the world blur. I didn’t need to look directly to notice it—the way Griffin kept stealing glances at her, like she was something delicate he didn’t know how to handle without breaking.



Out of nowhere, Soraya gave a girlish laugh and tilted her phone toward him. “Griffin, look at this guy who messaged me. Isn’t he kind of cute?”



Griffin’s grip on the steering wheel visibly tightened.



“Block him.”



“What?” she protested with a pout. “Seriously? I’m twenty-three—I’m not allowed to think someone’s hot?”



“Block him,” he repeated, his tone clipped and final.



Soraya rolled her eyes with exaggerated drama but followed the command, muttering under her breath, “You’re worse than a jealous boyfriend…”



Griffin didn’t reply, but I noticed the rigid set of his jaw. His silence spoke volumes. He wasn’t indifferent—he was possessive.



When we got to the house, I didn’t stay to chat. I walked straight to the bedroom, shut the door, and let the solitude pull me under like a tide.



From beyond the walls, I could hear the gentle clink of silverware, Soraya’s laughter spilling into the hallway, and the low murmur of a film playing on the living room TV. All of it added up to a warmth and intimacy that had never existed in my marriage.



In over two years, Griffin and I had never once shared dinner to the backdrop of music. We’d never had casual laughs. He had never looked at me the way he looked at her, like she was the center of his gravity.



I crawled beneath the blankets and let the bitterness inside me ferment, like something spoiled that refused to be swallowed. I didn’t know how long I stayed curled up like that, letting the darkness cocoon me.



Eventually, the quiet pulled me from bed—thirst nudging me toward the kitchen.



But when I pushed the door open, I froze.



Griffin was in the living room, kneeling beside the couch, completely still.



Soraya was curled up asleep, knees tucked to her chest, the blanket barely covering her. He was watching her, unmoving. His eyes weren’t filled with pity or obligation. They were full of something else—gentleness, reverence. Like she was light itself and he couldn’t look away.



In that moment, I saw him clearly. No facade. No pretense.



Just a man in awe of someone who wasn’t me.



Soraya stirred slightly, murmured in her sleep, and shifted. “Griffin… don’t let me go,” she whispered faintly. “I love you. Only you.”



Even in sleep, she reached for him, tugging him closer. Their faces met, lips brushing by accident at first.



But he didn’t flinch. Didn’t pull away.



His pupils widened. His breathing hitched.



And then he kissed her—deliberate, slow, and sure.



Chapter 5



I stood silently behind the door, my fingers trembling as I gripped the handle, holding my breath without even realizing it. Through the slight opening, I could see my husband, his head bent low, his mouth pressed against Soraya’s like she was something he couldn’t live without.



His palm rested on her hip, his fingers curling with possessive desperation, like he wanted to mold her into himself. Her breathing was unsteady, her arms fastened tightly around his neck, as if she'd been waiting her whole life for this moment to finally arrive.



“Griffin…” she murmured, his name leaving her lips again and again, delicate and needy. The way he answered—his voice raspy, quiet, almost reverent—was a tone I had never been worthy of.



That tenderness? That intimacy? He’d never given me even a fraction of it.



I don’t know how long I remained frozen in place, invisible behind the half-closed door, but eventually he pulled away, just slightly, and used the pad of his thumb to gently wipe the corner of her mouth. It was such a small gesture, yet so deliberate that it made my lungs forget how to function.



Then he reached into his pocket.



I watched as he pulled out a necklace—her necklace—the same one Soraya had gifted him years ago, the one he had once told me was misplaced during a move.



He hadn’t lost it. He’d just hidden it from me.



Now, he was wearing it again, slipping it over his head with no hesitation. And just like that, I understood.



He didn’t belong to me anymore.



He belonged to her.



I clenched my hands into fists, my nails digging into my skin so hard it hurt. The pain grounded me, gave me something to focus on besides the ache in my chest.



Without making a sound, I backed away, turned, and gently shut the bedroom door.



I crawled beneath the blankets and buried my face in the pillow, muffling the sound of his footsteps as he walked down the hallway. I squeezed my eyes shut. But the silence didn’t help. My mind betrayed me, dragging me back to every attempt I had made to get him to see me, to touch me, to choose me.



That time I walked into his study late one night, dressed in the silk robe he’d once praised. I faked needing a document just to be near him. He didn’t even lift his gaze from the paperwork.



That time I brought him a towel after his run, only for him to take it without a word, close the bathroom door, and leave me alone outside, holding nothing but rejection.



That night after the gala, when I came home tipsy, laughing, hopeful. I threw my arms around him like I used to, and he caught me, yes—but not to hold me. Just to set me upright, his hand cold and mechanical as he straightened his tie.



He was always composed. Always distant.



But now… all it took was one breathless “Griffin” from her, and suddenly, every rule he made me follow was shattered like it never existed.



Tears slid down my cheeks. I wiped them away quickly, pointlessly.



He didn’t love me.



He wanted her.



The next morning, they were already at the table by the time I came down. Soraya was seated comfortably, twirling her fingers over her lips and frowning slightly.



“Griffin, do you have bugs in this house or something?” she whined with a pout. “My lips feel all puffy today…”



Griffin didn’t even flinch. “I’ll have the staff bring you something for it,” he said evenly, like it meant nothing.



I stepped forward and noticed a package placed in front of my seat. I opened it.



Inside was a necklace. Rare. Lavish. The kind of piece that could pay someone’s rent for a year.



I let out a dry laugh. “Well, someone’s in a generous mood.”



Soraya leaned across the table for a better look. Her voice was sugarcoated, but jealousy laced every word. “Wow, Griffin… Didn’t know you spoiled your wife like this. I always thought you weren’t the romantic type. Guess I underestimated you.”



I lifted my eyes toward him, waiting for any sign—an explanation, even a lie—but all he did was sip his coffee in silence, his gaze distant.



He didn’t even try to say the gift was a consolation for what Soraya had done to me.



He didn’t have to.



He simply didn’t care anymore.



After finishing his coffee, he stood and buttoned his coat. “I’m off to work,” he announced, turning to Soraya next. “Don’t wander too much. Stay anywhere you want—just stay out of my study.”



Soraya gave him a playful pout. “Why not? What’s so secret in there?”



He tossed out some half-hearted excuse, something vague and dismissive. But I knew the truth. That room was his fortress—the place where he kept all the things he never wanted me to uncover.



After they left the table, I retreated to my room and locked the door. I didn’t want to hear Soraya’s voice echoing down the hall. Didn’t want to catch glimpses of her smiling like she owned the world. Didn’t want to be reminded that in her eyes, I was nothing but an extra in their private, twisted love story.



At some point, I drifted into sleep. But when I woke…



Something was off.



I sat up, stretched—and saw it. My hair.



Chopped.



Jagged strands of my long dark hair scattered on the floor like fallen leaves. My scalp felt lighter. Uneven. Violated.



I stumbled into the hallway, dizzy with disbelief, and made my way to the living room.



And there she was.



Soraya sat comfortably on the couch, humming a cheerful tune. In her hands, she held something delicate—a braid. My hair. She was weaving it, turning it into some grotesque little craft project.



My hair.



She looked up at me with a bright, innocent smile, like nothing was wrong. “Oh, hey. You’re up! Hope you don’t mind—I needed some materials for this school project. They asked us to make something meaningful. Thought I’d make a wig.”



She held up the braided piece like it was an award. “You really have gorgeous hair, you know? Super shiny and soft. Kinda jealous.”



My body moved before my mind caught up.



I stepped forward and slapped her across the face.

# Best Zebra Print Rugs 2025: Find Your Perfect Style

Zebra print rugs have roared back into popularity, offering a bold and stylish statement to any interior. In 2025, these striking rugs are more versatile than ever, appearing in a wide range of materials, sizes, and color variations. Whether you're looking to add a touch of exotic flair to your living room or a playful accent to your bedroom, a zebra print rug can transform your space.

Finding the optimal balance of quality, design, and price is key to creating a space that resonates with your personal style.

## Key Features Analysis

The crucial elements that make a great zebra print rug extend beyond simply mimicking the pattern.

**Material Composition:** High-quality zebra print rugs are crafted from a variety of materials, each offering different benefits. wool rugs provide superior durability and a luxurious feel underfoot, whereas synthetic fibers like nylon and polyester offer stain resistance and affordability. The pile height also plays a crucial role in comfort and maintenance, with lower piles being easier to clean and higher piles offering a plush, cozy texture. Careful attention to material blends can also provide the best from both worlds, as a notable example, an acrylic-wool blend.

**Pattern Accuracy and Color Fastness:** The authenticity and vibrancy of the zebra print are paramount. The best rugs exhibit sharp, well-defined stripes with consistent coloring throughout. Look for rugs that utilize high-quality dyes that resist fading,even with prolonged exposure to sunlight. A blurry or washed-out pattern can significantly detract from the rug's visual appeal. Moreover, the color palette should harmonize with your existing decor.

**Size and shape options:** Zebra print rugs are available in a range of sizes and shapes to suit diverse spatial requirements.From small accent rugs to large area rugs, you should be able to find the perfect dimensions to fit your room. Popular shapes include rectangular, round, and runner rugs, each lending a different aesthetic to the space. A well-chosen size can anchor your furniture arrangement and create a cohesive look.**Construction quality and Durability:** The durability of a zebra print rug is largely determined by its construction method. Hand-knotted rugs are renowned for their exceptional longevity, although they come at a premium price. Machine-made rugs offer a more affordable alternative without compromising on quality, especially when crafted with durable backing materials.Reinforced edges and a robust weave contribute to the rug's ability to withstand everyday wear and tear.

**GEN CON 2025 BRINGS RECORD-BREAKING NUMBER OF ATTENDEES TO INDY FOR THE BEST FOUR DAYS IN GAMING™**

* Gen Con Indy 2025 drew a record-breaking, sold-out crowd of nearly 72,000 attendees and more than 575 exhibiting companies.
* The annual four-day convention generated an estimated economic impact of more than $82 million for local businesses. 

**INDIANAPOLIS** (August 4, 2025) — Gen Con, the largest and longest-running tabletop gaming convention in North America, packed the halls of the Indiana Convention Center this week with nearly 72,000 gamers and fans, setting an all-time attendance record and generating an estimated economic impact of more than $82 million for Indianapolis hotels, restaurants, and other local businesses.

“With the entire Indiana Convention Center and Lucas Oil Stadium packed with global exhibitors and attendees, this year’s Gen Con generated more than $82 million in economic impact,” said Chris Gahl, Executive Vice President, and Chief Marketing Officer for Visit Indy. “This past week, we were proud to give Gen Con executives a hard-hat tour of the expanding convention center and new Signia hotel, projects giving the event continued future growth.”

Held each year since 1968, Gen Con gathers fans of board games, card games, roleplaying games, cosplay, and pop culture to play, shop, celebrate, and connect over a shared passion for gaming.

During the four days of the convention, attendees browsed and shopped an exhibit hall featuring over 575 game publishers and vendors and participated in nearly 30,000 events and activities, including a wide range of gaming sessions and tournaments, artist and author appearances, film screenings, musical performances, and the annual Gen Con Costume Contest. 

“Gen Con 2025 was another record-breaking year, and we are grateful for the incredible support of Indianapolis,” said Gen Con President David Hoppe. “The warm and welcoming atmosphere created when the tabletop gaming community meets Hoosier hospitality is essential to making The Best Four Days in Gaming**™** come to life each summer.”

Attendees also flocked to Gen Con’s outdoor Block Party activation on South Street. This outdoor, open-to-the-public festival featured dozens of local food trucks alongside Gen Con's local food and beverage partners Sun King Brewery, HotBox Pizza, Daniel’s Vineyard, Helm Coffee, Social Cantina, and Harry & Izzy's.

Gen Con partners with charities each year to raise funds and spotlight the work of the selected nonprofit organizations. This year, attendees helped raise nearly $40,000 for Women4Change Indiana and Brown Toy Box Foundation. Gen Con has raised almost $500,000 for charity since 2003.

Gen Con will return to Indianapolis from July 30 to August 2, 2026, and is contracted to take place there annually through 2030. Badges for next year’s convention will go on sale in early 2026 on the convention’s website ([gencon.com](https://www.gencon.com/)).

For some time, I’ve observed concerning behavioral changes in my mother, including secretive phone calls (often late at night), abrupt pauses in conversation when I’m nearby, and an unusual level of nervousness. Recently, I overheard a male voice during a call she claimed was with a female friend. To confirm my suspicions, I left a recording device unattended and captured a conversation where a man told her, *""I wish you were here, and we could grab coffee,""* to which she replied, *""Yeah, I wish too—I wouldn’t have slept.""* The tone was undeniably intimate. Additionally, she has begun closing the door on my sleeping father, which is out of character. While I recognize the ethical complexity of recording without consent, I felt compelled to seek clarity given the emotional toll of her secrecy. I am now grappling with whether to confront her, inform my father, or gather further evidence—all while navigating feelings of betrayal, guilt, and confusion. I would appreciate guidance on processing this situation and determining the healthiest next steps for myself and my family.

1mixljd,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1mixljd/is_my_ex_trying_to_be_friends_or/,Is my ex trying to be friends or?,"Just got out of 7 year relationship- we ended on pretty good terms even tho I didn’t want the breakup to happen. 

I tried communicating a few weeks after and he was dry and took forever to reply. I then went no contact for a month. 

I text him asking to meet for a coffee and brought up some nice memories too. He replied to part of the text but ignored the drink- this was an indication he either isn’t ready for that or doesn’t want to see me. 

However he followed by asking if he could send me some tiktoks he had saved for me or if that was weird- I said no because I obviously like having conversation/connection with him. He sent 60 videos all dated over past 2 months of us being broken up. 

I read into this as hes not moved on, not over me and is maybe open to reconciliation- which is what I want more than anything. 

We continue to have really nice conversation and hes engaging too by asking questions to keep convo going. He wished me happy birthday which was polite. 

I have tried to slip in subtle hints about meeting up but he doesn’t really take notice- or chooses to ignore. I even Said I was emotional the other night about being given 2 sets of something at a hotel & wish he could join me for breakfast. He responded saying something tells me you’ve been drinking haha- totally bypassing anything emotionally charged. 


This leads me to believe he just wants to be friends- but I obviously want more. We get on really well & think we needed a break just to put things into perspective. I’m worried asking outright might startle him, I worry going silent away gives him too much space and he chooses to move on & lastly I’m worried to keep the convo going incase I get freindzoned. 

I would love some advice

1mixh10,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mixh10/i_thought_angels_were_in_my_walls_part_2_final/,I thought angels were in my walls. (Part 2- Final),"Here's the link to part 1: [https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mh6dy2/i\_thought\_angels\_were\_in\_my\_walls\_part\_1/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mh6dy2/i_thought_angels_were_in_my_walls_part_1/)



There was a moment as I walked through the front door that I didn’t hear the scratching in the walls, that I thought my forgiveness had cured my haunting, but within a few moments it returned as they registered my arrival. I made my way around the flat and checked the bowls I had left out. *Full, full, full.* All of them were untouched. Clearly these angels didn’t have a taste for cereal. Deciding that there wasn’t much I could do about them, I went about my day. 

I began to pile up my textbooks onto the coffee table, gently pushing aside the bibles I had laid out the night before. Slipping on headphones, I started the assigned reading that I had missed for the last 3 lectures. Every paragraph seemed to drag on and on. I found myself glancing around the room, desperate to focus on anything even remotely more interesting. 

Within half an hour, I had given up, instead choosing to watch a long video on a film I had never watched. *Daniel would have studied. Daniel would have been on top of this*. I tried to shoo those thoughts, but the guilt of failure still sat heavy on my chest. That weight left me trapped watching video after video until my evening slipped away. 

When I finally got up to go make dinner, the stack of textbooks had only served as an eyesore. 

I decided on a simple dinner. I went through the motions blindly, following a pattern I had done many nights before. Heat up the pan, defrost some buns, slice the cheese and the tomato and the- My finger was bleeding onto the cutting board. 

“Ah! Goddammit!” Hissing as my finger began to throb, I shook out the bleeding hand and scurried to the bathroom. The cut wasn’t deep, just enough to bleed all over my sleeve. I rummaged around one-handedly trying to find the old box of plasters. After three different drawers and cupboards I managed to pull out the beaten box. By the time it was secured my finger was only distantly aching. I left the mess of open drawers in the bathroom and quickly hurried back to the kitchen to check the stove. 

Luckily, the patties were still sizzling happily. I went back to my, surprisingly clean,  cutting board and continued preparing dinner. 

“Goddammit.” *No. Please not again*. The voice came from the lounge. I went back to chopping the lettuce. 

“God-” From the hallway this time. I moved my fingers further from the trembling knife in my other hand. 

“Forgive me, for taking the Lord’s name in vain. Amen.” I whispered it to myself, too afraid to try and say it to the angels watching. I could hear murmurs further in the flat, but I couldn’t distinguish what they were saying. I didn’t move my eyes from the lettuce in my hand, studying every drop of water settled on the leaves. I didn’t move until I stopped hearing that murmuring. I went back to preparing dinner in silence. 

After dinner, lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling listening to the angels scurry through. *I wonder why they stay in the walls.* The noise kept me wired and awake for a long time. I slowly drifted off thinking about what they did while I slept. 

Rebbekah was already waiting for me as I walked in to my lecture the next morning. I slunk into the seat next to her, shedding my jacket to try and avoid dripping it over my damp clothes. 

“Hey drowned rat, you’re late! You usually get here before me.” She shifted slightly to avoid any contact with the dripping rain, softened with an easy smile. I tried to return it, but it came out more as a grimace. I looked away. 

I zoned out most of the class. Rebbekah would occasionally glance over at me throughout her stories, giving me a look that I hadn’t seen since I first began to attend class with her. A sturdy look, eyes soft and flittering over me. Trying to avoid her prying eyes, I focused further on the lecturer. However her words just flowed directly through my head like water, impossible to grasp. 

“Are you okay?” I hadn’t realised that Rebbekah had been silent for the last however long. Her voice almost startled me. 

“Yeah. Yeah why?” 

“You’re quiet. Which, I mean you’re always quiet, but like you haven’t even been listening which- I don’t know, you just seem off.” I stared for a hollow moment at the crease between her eyebrows. Her eyes drilled into my head the longer the silence went on. 

“Just- Haven’t been sleeping well. The uh- the rats in my apartment again.”

“The exterminator didn’t work? I thought your landlord fixed that ages ago? You should really do something about that. It’ll only get worse.”

“I’ve been trying.” I thought about the bowls of cereal; about my fervent prayers. 

“You need to say something to your landlord. That place has been infested since you moved in which I think means he is not up to code or something-”

“It’s fine. He tried to get rid of them.” I had told him the last exterminator worked. I didn’t want him in my apartment. 

“Well can I at least come over and have a look for you? I got a friend’s brother who works in some sort of pest control so, I mean, he could come help maybe.” The thought of Rebbekah in my apartment, with the angels watching her, sent shivers across my arms. I breathed slowly through my teeth. 

“ No, no, I don’t want to bother him. It’s fine.” Rebbekah didn’t look convinced, her foot tapping agitated against her seat. 

“Marnie, you can’t live in a rat overrun apartment. You’re gonna get, like, a flesh eating disease or something.” She twisted her bracelet between her fingers over and over. “It would make me feel better if I could at least see how bad it’s gotten.” Her voice turned soft. It was the same tone she used when she first met me. That sickly sweet pitying tone that lit my insides in shame and rage. 

“I don’t need your help, Rebbekah. Just cause you couldn’t save Daniel doesn’t mean you can hover over me.” The air between us froze. The lecturers droning voice sat in the space like static. Rebbekah turned away for a moment, lips pursed firmly, eyes downcast, glassy. My insides turned to lead gravel and churned. I tried to say something, anything, to patch up the rift that I had just torn through us, but I just gaped softly in an attempt to form an apology. 

“I didn’t realise I was-” She paused, her lip wobbling as she searched for the word. “Overstepping. Sorry for worrying about you. No, wait.” She pressed her nails against her lips, mocking chewing them like a kicked habit. “That was mean. I know I've been a bit protective or whatever. I didn’t realise it was affecting you. I just worry, with you being alone, after your brother.” She continued to fake her nail biting as her eyes flicked between me and the lecturer. 

“No, I'm sorry. That was- You were trying to help. Sorry” Guilt burned through my blood, pooling in my chest. *How could I yell at her? She was trying to help. She’s my only friend. God, it really is in my nature.* “Do you want to come over this week? We could study or something.” Rebbekah held my eyes a little longer before glancing away again. 

“Okay. Thank you. That sounds nice; We haven’t hung out in a while.” Rebbekah spent the rest of the class uncharacteristically quiet as she soaked in the charged air. I spent the rest of it picturing Rebbekah as a dark spot on my living room carpet. 

As soon as I rushed through my door, I quickly began hopping about in a fruitless attempt to avoid dripping rain all over the floor. My shoes thudded against the wall by the door where I flung them. Stumbling through to the living room, I dropped to my knees next to the couch. 

“Forgive me. Please forgive me. I-” My mind was racing too fast for me to pull my thoughts into a sentence. “I didn’t mean to yell at her. She was- She was only trying to help.” My eyes darted around at the walls, listening for any creak or groan that might sound like forgiveness. “I didn’t mean to say that. I never mean it.” I don’t know if they could hear me as my voice grew quieter and quieter. “I don’t know why I think these things, or why I say them.” It came out as a whisper, barely audible even to myself. I stayed there. I listened for any noise in response. 

My knees began to ache from where I sat but I stayed. Kept my hands clasped in my lap and waited. And waited. And waited. But nothing happened. For the first time in a long time my apartment was silent and still. I stayed there, trembling arms clasped together, and knees throbbing against the bald carpet, and when the feeling of being watched never came, I stumbled up to my feet. 

Hesitantly I walked away. My stomach turned from the uncertainty. I walked past the kitchen and straight to bed. Curled up in my nest of tangled blankets, I continued to pray in my head. 

The silence lulled me through into sleep. 

Blinking through the haze of sleep, I was surprised to find my face pressed against rough carpet. An odd ache was present in my ankle. An ache, like a cold hand curled around it. My foot brushed up against a cool solid surface. In fact my whole body was chilled without my blankets. 

Being tugged across the floor was what shot me into consciousness. 

In an instant, I registered my hair dragging through the washing on my floor; The sensation of being held upside down, blood pooling towards my head. My drowsy body struggled to flail, arms moving thickly through the air. Whatever was dragging me had its hands curled around my entire leg, reaching up my back slowly, stroking and reaching for the rest of my body. I darted my eyes around the room, but I couldn’t see a thing in the darkness. My hands reached to pull off whatever was holding me. 

“Agh! Ah! Wha-” I was gasping, short, sharp sounds leaving me involuntarily as I struggled. Whatever it was, I couldn’t reach it. 

I was tugged harshly, pain beginning to radiate up my leg, and I was fully upside down. Scrabbling at the wall didn’t help. Whatever it was, it was strong. Quickly trying to escape I dropped my body, my back hitting the wall hard. By touch I scrambled to find anything. Brushing up against something solid, I grabbed it and flung it hard into the wall. My metal drink bottle thudded loudly. Whatever had my leg seemed to, in a humanlike moment, flinch. 

It released. It felt like hundreds of bugs skittering over my skin. My head hit the floor hard, my neck cricking badly as I crumpled into the carpet. I stumbled, my body fighting against me as I forced it up, and managed to slam on the lightswitch. 

Every corner and nook was like an eye watching me. I tried all I could to stare back at each one. All of them were empty. Locating where I had been dragged, found by the dent in my drywall, I tracked up to where I was going. The hole in my ceiling, from the leak last year. Where I always felt angels staring at me. My lip wobbled, poised between emotion, before stretching out into a toothy grin. Tears pooled in my eyes.. Dropping to my still aching knees I stared up at that little hole and cried like I had never cried before. I was going to Heaven. 

I woke up atop my duvet. My head pounded and my eyes ached, as if I had spent the night blackout drunk instead of sobbing on my bedroom floor. The apartment was dead silent. *They’re gone. I passed.* Giddy joy raced up through my chest, pulling at my cheeks and eyes. I almost felt like crying again. My duvet pooled around my hips as I pulled myself up to start this clean new day. 

The sun was streaming in through the curtains as I dressed, bravely donning a yellow crewneck that had sat for a long time in the back of my wardrobe. It felt good to walk through my apartment without hiding. I stepped out into the sunny lounge and for the first time since I left my childhood home, I felt hopeful. The dark spot was still there on my couch, but I decided to just pull down the blanket over it. *I’ll have to clean that at some point.* The bright day still continued to shine through the windows. I ended up moving to my couch to decide how to spend the day. Before I could think too much about it, my phone began to ring in my hand. 

“Hello?”

“Hey sweetie!” My mum’s cherry voice crackled through the phone, sounding almost distant, as if she was standing away from the receiver. 

“Hi, Mum. How are you?”

“Good good. Very busy as usual! How about you? Working hard?”

“Yeah, been studying a lot.” I lied. 

“You work so hard! Just like your brother. Be sure to take a break every now and then.”

“Don’t worry, I take care of myself.” With my free hand I picked at a loose thread in my jeans. 

“Oh, you have class today don’t you, so I better leave you then. Just give me a ring if you have time, okay? I like to know how you’re doing.” 

“Okay. I’ll talk to you soon. Love you.”

“Love you too. Bye now.”

My phone beeped as I hung up. I felt a little guilty lying to her about my classes, but I was determined to not let it ruin my day. Deciding then, I went to put on my coat and walk out in the sun. 

Stepping out, it felt warmer than it had in weeks. The sun kissed over the only bare skin on my face. Although despite its warmth I could still feel the chilled wind nip at my nose and ears. I picked the same path as last time, hoping to rewrite the memories of that desperate escape to the church. 

It was a beautiful day. Rays of light cast dappled shadows over the concrete and I now saw the autumn colours scattered through yards like a mosaic. Ever since last night it was like I had stepped into a new world. Like I had stepped into Heaven now that I knew I wasn’t damned. 

The church rose into view the same as it had days prior. There were still a few lone fogged up cars sitting in the carpark, and still skeletal trees stretched up around it. I stopped for a moment to just look, but this time, I walked on past. Instead I walked on to a local corner store. It was quiet, the only other customers I saw as I approached was a father shepherding his kids out with fistfuls of packaged candy. I scooted past the excited kids and into the store. 

Down the back of the store, I wandered to the fridges of chilled drinks, taking my time to browse the rows of colourful aluminium cans and plastic bottles. *I think I deserve a little something. After all that shit*. Eventually, I picked out a soda with cute packaging and slowly made my way to the counter, glancing through the rows of sweets along the way. After paying, I found a spot to sit on a metal ledge against the wall and took a moment to sip my drink in the sun. 

Eventually, I made my way back home. As I crossed onto my street, I checked my phone and found a text from Rebbekah. 

*May come over today to study. Be home. Also what snacks you want*

*1 hr ago*

*Oops.* My pace sped up as I went to meet Rebbekah. However, as my apartment came into view, I thankfully couldn’t see her car outside. I dug through my coat pockets for my house key as I juggled my bottle of soda and focused on not tripping. Pulling out my keys, standing on my front door step, I unlocked the door and went to step in but noticed something had stuck to my shoe. I looked down to scrape whatever it was off but it wasn’t on my shoe. It was on my doorstep. A large pool of something dark red and half dried. My stomach lurched and I nearly found myself throwing up on my shoes. *God please. Not again. I thought I was good.* My vision began to blur. Before I could pass out I flung open the door. 

Racing through the hall, leaving a grisly trail of sparse, disgusting spots, I grabbed the first thing I could find. I pulled the mink blanket from the couch, stumbled through the hall, and flung it over the pool. Dropping to my knees, I scrubbed at the mark. Most of it had already dried. My fingers cramped around it, gripping the fabric until my knuckles were white. I could feel the glassiness of my eyes, drying and tearing in the cold wind. The blood wasn’t coming off. 

At some point I could no longer feel my fingers, and my knees were beginning to regain feeling; a scraping, aching pain. I left the blanket on the doorstep covering the puddle. Closing the door felt like pulling shut a coffin. 

I locked down my house. If the angels wanted to deal with me then no one else needed to be involved anymore. My phone went into the bottom drawer of my dresser, underneath the folded shirts. I didn’t want to know if it was Rebbekah that had been on my doorstep. The curtains were drawn and would stay drawn for as long as this would take. After my doors were locked, I didn’t know what to do with myself. I sat alone on my couch, next to the remains of Brandon, with a half drunk bottle of soda on the coffee table. I waited. Waited for anything to happen. Maybe I should be scared at the prospect of going to Hell, but at the time I wasn’t. I didn’t feel much of anything. I just stared and stared at the bottle sitting on the table and waited. 

As I sat there in silence, eventually something moved. A little shadow in the corner of my eye. Looking up, it had already skittered away. I would have dismissed it had I not heard the scratching of something on the floor as it went. My hands began to gently tremble where I had them folded in my lap. Another one flittered through my vision deep in the dim light of the kitchen. It was too far and too quick to identify. The skin of my lip broke under my teeth. 

“It’s okay. You can take me now. I know what I did wrong.” My voice was cracking under the weight of the words. There was almost a relief in them though. 

The angels, as always, said nothing. Another one peeked from around the doorway to the hall for a moment. 

They made me wait. I stayed still, still as I could. I didn't move from where I was sat, and I waited. And waited. More and more they would flitter through my house; I could hear them scratching over the floors, but they never came near me. The light was beginning to dim through the curtains when I became restless. Every moment I waited, the guilt and fear built up in my chest. My lip was bloody and the holes in my jeans picked through. *Is this part of the punishment?* My body ached from how taught I held my muscles, and the anxiety that was trembling through me. 

I thought about my Mum. I wish I could have said goodbye. I wish I could be there to comfort her through the loss of her last living child. At the thought of her I could feel my eyes becoming wet, at the thought of her soft hands, her smile lines and crows feet, and her lively voice crackling through the phone. 

*I should have called her more*. 

An angel skittered through the kitchen door, stopping for a moment, almost long enough for me to look at it, but it fled again before I could clear the blur of tears. I rose from the couch,  knees cracking loudly in the silent house. 

“Why aren’t you taking me?” It came out hushed. I cleared my throat and rose my voice to be heard. “I admitted that I’m damned. The judgement is over, why aren’t you taking me to Hell?” Angel’s clattered around the house, now whispering amongst each other. I could hear fragments of what I had said repeated back. Mindlessly I moved towards the kitchen. The angels I could see scattered away as I approached.

“Do I need to confess? What do I need to do?” 

They whispered back; *What do- I need- What do-* The guilt and fear was churning in my chest, slowly turning on itself again and again. It hurt. The angels peeked around corners like they were listening.

“Please just tell me. You don’t need to punish anyone else, just me.” Again all I heard was hushed voices amongst the tapping of small feet and peeking heads. That feeling in my chest began to burn. It burned through my chest, into my arms and behind my eyes. 

“What do I do?!” I snapped. The angels skittered at the loud noise, shuffling back into their dark corners. 

“Just tell me what to do!” My chest ached. If they came back, I wouldn’t know; I could barely make out those judgmental figures through the blur of tears. The frustration began to burn hotter.

“Ple-e-ea-se!” I could barely draw a breath to form the words, blocked in my chest and throat. All they did was watch. They didn’t care. At this point, after those bloodstains, I didn’t either. The thought of the people who had been punished in my place stuck like a tack in my chest.

The bar stool had cracked through the drywall before I knew I picked it up. Splinters sprayed across the linoleum. My fingers ached as they clenched what was left. All eyes were on me. It clattered on the floor as I threw it down. I had definitely got their attention. The angels seemed to be peeking from behind every corner, doorway, and open cupboard. 

“It was my envy, right?! Because I hated Daniel?! I know, okay! I hate myself for it!” My face was wet and I could barely breathe between the guilt and rage clogged in my chest and the pathetic snuffling of my crying. “Please, I know, and you can punish me for it! I know I’m a bad person, I’ve known for a long time, but I’m confessing it! I confess that I was relieved when he died so I wouldn’t have to live in his shadow! I confess that I wished he would die for years! I confess that I hated him! It’s my fault! Let me be punished!” My throat felt shredded, as if the words themselves were tearing out of me as much as it felt like they were. 

The angels whispered endlessly. They made no move to drag me to Hell. They just watched and watched and watched as they judged my sins. I trembled under the hot anger flushing my face. I grabbed whatever was in reach and smashed it. Something shattered across the wall. 

“Do something!” My voice was raw. Everything felt raw. A university branded mug shattered into a burst of ceramic shards. There was no satisfaction in its destruction. Just a growing feeling of exposure. 

“Fucking university. I only went to make Mum proud since her pride and joy couldn’t achieve anything ever again.” The shards crackled under scurrying feet. “ I bet she wishes I died instead.” I said the words, but under the rage, I didn’t believe them. But my rage didn’t care. My other barstool was shoved to the floor where it lay pathetically. 

“Just punish me already!” Something inside me bubbled over and my hand buried itself inside my drywall, dark creatures scuttling out like insects. The pain radiated up my arm, jumping through me. Hissing, I pulled my fist away, blood and crumbling drywall dropping to the floor. The small cut on my knuckle was enough to shock me out of the haze I had been in, and in a moment all my anger melted back. As if I had just woken up, I was suddenly aware of the mess of shards and glass that littered the floor. My face was wet and my throat hurt. Throbbing pain shot through my hand. Looking back to the jagged hole in my kitchen wall, there were no insects pouring out as I had imagined. 

Though no one was there to see it, I felt ashamed of the state. 

I curled up, crouched over the mess, and I sobbed. It was like I was floating, every sin I had carried was pulled out of me, and I could feel the weightlessness of that burden. It was nice. But it was also like a part of me had left, and left behind a hole. But for now I just hoped maybe I had been relieved of my judgement. 

I cried hard into my hands. Everything I had been holding back for the past few days, my endless grief over Daniel, my guilt, all of it bubbled up in that moment, and I could not stop crying. It spilled out and out and out; over my face and spilling into my hands. I crouched there, sobbing so hard it began to echo throughout the house. 

From down the hall, I heard each of my own sobs, off-beat and hushed. My crying began to trickle into hitches of breath as I registered it wasn’t me I was hearing. They were in the hall. They were still here. I wasn’t even angry at this point, I just felt so tired. The glass crunched under my heels as I stood, impaling into my dirty sneakers I still hadn’t removed from my walk. The doorway to the living room felt impossible. Everything fell silent. There was a moment, where my breath was held and the air was as tense as I was; then a horrific reflection of my own face appeared from that doorway. 

I registered it was meant to be my face, but everything about it was wrong. Its eyes seemed to be melting from its head. The body jerked around the corner like an amateur’s marionette, struggling to move through its impossible proportions. Despite the sniffling half sobs coming from somewhere inside it, it conveyed no expression and its mouth stayed glued shut. I was frozen as I tried to register what this horrific doppelgänger was. Shambling across the glass, it didn’t even seem to register any sort of pain as it slowly moved closer and closer. 

Finally, my senses caught up to me. I scrambled backwards, skittering over glass until my back hit the edge of the counter. It continued to amble closer, seemingly knowing it would get to me in its own time. I was pinned in the kitchen. I had to move. As it’s gnarled hands reached out towards me I dropped to the floor, clambering across the ground and stumbling out to the lounge, nicks cutting into my hands and knees. Glancing back, it turned, slowly, its uneven eyes struggling to follow me as they rolled around in its head. Scrambling for anything, my head whipped around looking for something, some way to save myself. As soon as it left my sight, it pounced. 

My head cracked against the floor as we thudded into the carpet, rolling around and scrabbling against each other like animals. My nails caught and bent against the strange folds of the creature, where its soft peach rind skin had tried to form clothes. I struggled to shove it off, hands slick with sweat. It wasn’t coordinated, more slapping and wriggling as it struggled to puppet its body, but it was strong, and dense. Grunting, I managed to catch my hips enough to throw it off, and fumble back away from it on my hands until I hit the coffee table.

It seemed to fight against itself for a moment. Its limbs, appearing devoid of muscle, floundered under it as it attempted to push itself from the floor. Its useless eyes stared out at me from the warped version of my face, a blank unreadable expression and it’s empty maw of a mouth gaping open and closed. 

Everything in me was trembling. Sweat and tears dripped into my eyes. The doppelgänger limply rose, its neck twisted and its head drooping over its chest. 

*Huff huff.* It was mimicking my panicked breaths. 

“Do some- Do something.” My own voice, in a desperate rasp, choked out from it, muffled from within its body. I couldn’t help but sob in horror. I clawed at the floor as I crawled back towards the kitchen, out of the corner I had been backed into. It caught my ankle. Kicking and gasping, I fought against its bruising grip. It did not let go. It tugged at my leg, attempting to drag me to it, but unable to devise using it’s other hand. 

“An okay- an ok-y host. Host. Okay host.” It blabbered on and on. The grip on my ankle was so strong, it felt as if I could feel my bones creaking. The sobs from my chest were uncontrollable now. It was so strong. 

*I don’t even know what this is. I can’t do this. I can’t, I can’t, I don’t want to. God, please just let it stop.* It was hopeless. 

The creature yanked me back, clambering up my body on its unsteady limbs. I let go of the handfuls of carpet I had been gripping and clutched at my face, smearing tears across my cheeks and into my hair. A jolt of searing pain raced up my leg as small mouths dug into my flesh. Through the blur of tears I could see my own face buried into my leg with blood smeared across the many pairs of strange protruding mandibles, like bugs tearing into an overripe fruit. 

It was painful. The most pain I had ever felt. Now that it had got me, it reveled, tearing out bloody chunks of my leg muscle. I lay pinned, writhing and hiccuping beneath it, the same way I had when I broke my ankle falling from a tree when I was 12. More than anything, more than I wanted the pain to stop, I wished Daniel was there like he was when we were 12. As my vision spotted, I tried to picture him crouched next to me, hoarsely calling for mum and patting my muddy hair. I tried to feel his bony hand clutching my fingers through the overwhelming waves of pain. The tearing sound was drowning out his cries for help. 

Daniel had always been better than me. Where I had been spiteful in my envy, he had always cared for me. He hadn’t let go of my hand the whole way to the hospital. I may be an evil person, but Daniel never was. He would have told me to keep going. He wouldn’t have wanted me to give up and follow him. He would have forgiven me. 

I could almost feel his gentle fingers clutching my hand as I reached back, grasping with shaking hands the bowl of cereal that was still on the living room floor. It shattered as it collided with the creature’s head, splintering apart in my hand. 

It’s head seemed to dissolve, bug sized *things* skittering in all directions over my mangled leg. I used my numb arms to scramble back, smearing blood over the carpet, and tried to pull my leg from under it. Agonising pain shot through me like fire from a simple movement, but I kept trying, eventually pulling it free as I slid through the pools of blood. The thing was now half formed, struggling to keep whatever was making it up from skittering away as well. It was somehow more grotesque than when I had first seen it, now just a jaw sitting atop the neck, and its skin shifting and crawling. 

My back hit the wall, but I kept shuffling back, trying in vain to phase through and away from that creature, but all I could do was pull my legs in tight, having to manually pull what remained of the bloodied one towards me with my hands. The feeling of my own muscle flexing uselessly under my fingers still aches through my hands from time to time. 

Those bug-like things dispersed faster and faster, and what was once my doppelganger seemed to almost dissolve with it, jerking and twitching. Some of them skittered towards me, trying to get at my open wound, but as I yelped, they would run off; a lot less brave on their own. 

As my nightmare collapsed into nothing, along with it went my strength. My writhing shuffle slowed into shaking. Afraid to close my eyes, I continued to watch lifelessly as the last creatures skittered back away into the walls, and for a long time after I stayed there with my eyes open. After seeing something like that, after spending the last few weeks in a paranoid daze only to be proved right in a way, it’s hard to know what to do next. *Alright. Just break it down.* 

I don’t remember much of the after. Now that I’m back in that flat I can piece it together. I don’t remember it, but there's a blood trail from where I had huddled up against the wall all the way through to my dresser of my room. The bottom drawer is still open and my clothes are pulled out all over the floor. I must have called for help because I remember flashes of a hospital bed and a paramedic leaning down through the ghostly, bright lights asking my name. I know I didn’t tell them anything because Rebbekah told me she had to describe me to the nurses at reception. She had shown up to my flat to study, only to see the ambulance leaving and several cops milling around dumbfounded at my door. I still wonder who that stain was. Every night I apologise to them but I wish I had a name to pray for at least. 

Rebbekah dropped me off here today. I know she still desperately wants to know what happened that night, but I don’t know if I could explain it to anyone. I guess that’s why I’m writing this down. I just need it to be out there, but it must stay in this house. I just came to get my things. From here, I’m going back to my Mum for a bit. I don’t know from there, but at least I’ll drop by Daniel. Now though, I need to call my mum",1,1754462526.0,nosleep,2,0.67,False

Here’s a little about me: I don’t have a lot of time for social stuff; I work all the time. I have friends, I do stuff, but I’m always working when my friends are free. They are married and have kids—thrilled for them, but so vastly different from my own life; hence why I am here.

I enjoy reading—fiction, autobiographies, but mainly fiction; sleeping in on weekends; watching Netflix; exploring cafes; drinking iced coffee; and singing loudly to my music.

I am a night owl, and that probably won’t change. It's normal for me to drink Coca-Cola with lots of ice and listen to audiobooks or watch a series or a movie.

I vote blue, so please only message me if you are similar in that sense. Also, if you spend a lot of time playing video games, don’t message me. 

I'm interested in chatting with individuals aged 25-46 who reside in the United States or Canada. Wishing everyone the best of luck in their search

Last week I overheard Jess venting to Lauren about someone messing with her at her desk. She seemed frustrated. Lauren was super supportive, saying it was messed up and whoever was doing it needed to stop.

Since then, I’ve noticed the stuff Jess was talking about. Sticky notes covering her monitor, someone flipping keys on her keyboard, fake IT messages that made her restart her computer multiple times. It’s harmless on the surface, but it’s clearly bothering her. Then a few days ago, I walked into the break room and saw Lauren pouring hot sauce into Jess’s coffee. She didn’t see me, and I didn’t say anything.

Now I know it’s Lauren who’s been doing all of it, and Jess still has no clue. I don’t know if it’s some weird joke or something more personal, but it feels wrong. I don’t want to be in the middle of their situation or get involved, but I also don’t feel great pretending I didn’t see anything.

I’m torn about whether to take over the bar. I’ve been praying about it (my favorite verse is Philippians 4:6), asking God to help me make the right decision. Today, I’m going to see the accountant to learn more about the bar’s finances. Of course, if the bookkeeping is shady or the business isn’t financially viable, I won’t go through with it.

The month before school ended I saw that this guy from my school would always be the first to like my tiktoks and would like my reposts, which was strange to me because he was on the football team and is very popular so I would've never expected him to like the same music as I do and play guitar. A couple days later I decided to add him on snap after my friend told me that he was talking to me about her in class saying I was really cool and liked the music I made. I added him at night because I was so nervous about it the whole day but my life was getting boring and It could never hurt it try (it did) We ended up talking the whole night and I remember being so tired for practice in the morning but it was so worth it. I got his number the same night and we shared music and he shared one of his stories he wrote. He was truly not what I expected but in the best way possible. later that day I was hiking with a friend and I got a text from him asking if I wanted to hangout and even though it was super quick I was so excited and agreed. Our plan was to go to the record shop but we ended up driving.around with the windows up on the freeway and we were singing loudly (and very badly) to songs. we walked around the city and we ran across the cross walks hopping on only the white stripes and omg we probably looked so stupid but I could care less. we laid on the beds at Macy's giggling and looking at each other until we got kicked out and I just remember laughing and running away following him behind. We went on the elevator and he was 6'0 ft and I'm 5'2 so he rested his arm on my head and I just remember looking at him and bursting laughing. He paid for my food and we got $20 milkshakes and drank them sitting on a bench people watching. I opened up to him about how I was scared that loving me is the worst thing that someone could do and it always ends badly he said ""anyone can love you, and they'd be the luckiest person in the world to have them be loved by you back"" I'll always remember that and I'll always remember feeling like we were the only two people alive when walking around the city. I'm a very self conscious person who often worries a lot about her looks but I didn't have a single thought pass through my mind about what I looked like because he made me feel so free he was like a magician and could let me forget about all bad. later that night we sat at a playground and we were playing guitar and I just remember me asking him to close his eyes because I was too embarrassed to sing in front of him and he texted me that night saying it was the cutest thing ever. we got close very fast. He would walk with me around the halls and drive me to school every morning. He even started driving his truck (which he hates) because I told him I liked it. We hung out so much and I would always end up falling asleep on him. I felt so safe. he would scratch my back until I fell asleep because it would make me so tired and comfortable and when I woke up he still was doing it because he said he wanted me to have the best sleep I could. I would wear his t shirts and he would make me coffee and food. I even slept over at his house once because I got kicked out and he got me as fast as he could. I remember that night I had woken up from a bad dream and started crying and he kissed me and held me until I fell asleep in his arms. And when I went to London for a week for an internship he would stay awake all night just so he could text me. he would call me pretty and we even showered together which Ive never done with someone. Everything about what we had was so intimate, all the sleepless nights of us talking and playing guitar or listening to music while just sitting in each others presence. I'd never had anything like it. It all got ruined though when my ex gf had texted me asking for me to come back to her. we broke up 3 months ago and the relationship was only about 2 months long but she said she loved me and missed me so much. I reassured her but I didn't say anything about getting back together I told her that I had moved on and what me and her had wasn't healthy. this upset her a lot and she had started a rumor that we had a makeout session in her car. It wasn't true but he had heard and he believed it because he's such an over thinker so it took a really big toll on him. He told me he wanted to stop talking and I was just so stunned like  I had just been pushed from the edge of the world. We saw each other one last time and we were in his car at a parking lot he cried in my arms and I cried in his. I'm so angry, I'm so lost. I want to fight for myself and I want to explain to him that it never happened and she didn't even have any proof. But I am deciding to give him space. giving him space in hopes that that's what it'll take for him to come back. I still go back to that parking lot and I sit there missing him and I wait, not knowing what for. He still shares his location with me and I still share mine and one of his instagram highlight cover is the photo he took of the city when we were together which probably means nothing at all and I'm just delusion but I'm so lost.

Ok—Manitoban, married with kids, currently experiencing what I can only describe as “adult puberty.” You know, the stage with weird weight gains, chronic mystery pains, and newfound obsessions with things you once mocked (slow cookers, weather apps, ergonomic footwear).

I mean, I’m not dead *yet*, but I *am* evolving—just not into anything cool or convenient. If I’m a Pokémon, I’ve skipped the middle stage and gone straight into my awkward final form: mildly lumpy, full of opinions (or shit), and weirdly into hour-long videos of Dutch men silently restoring antique coffee grinders.

What am I looking for? I honestly don’t know. Kind of like the “then” of my life’s trajectory—a vague fog of purpose, nostalgia, and second-hand smoke from the burning dreams of my twenties. But here I am, wandering into this penpal thing with open eyes, open mind, and some mild plantar fasciitis.

You should know I’ve got a very self-deprecating sense of humor. If you’re looking for spiritual enlightenment or a life coach, I am neither of those things. But if you enjoy sarcastic banter, mildly philosophical spirals, and conversations that bounce between trauma and botched fast food orders in under 60 seconds, we might just vibe.

Also—and I say this with all the love in the world—no vegans. Not because I hate you, but because *you don’t make friends with salad.* That’s science. 

Someone close in age would be nice. Someone younger, if they’ve got their shit figured out (I tend to think the next generation is smarter and better at lifing than we ever were). Or someone older who’s lived to tell the tale—I’m all for it.

If you’re down to talk about life, love, obscure 80s lyrics, body pain, or which Simpsons character would make the worst roommate, I’m all ears. Slightly hairy ears—though I *do* manscape and I’m positive I’ve done myself justice with my current regimen. Hit me with a gnarly “Would You Rather?” Points for absurdity and crassness. DM, and go from there. Cheers! ",1,1754462071.0,penpals,0,1.0,False

Okay, real talk — has anyone else been seeing [Lortopulix](https://tinyurl.com/2d33oduh) *everywhere* lately? I kept getting ads, random YouTube sponsorships, and even a few friends started name-dropping it. So naturally, I had to dive in and figure out what the hype is all about.

With crypto and online trading platforms getting more popular than ever — especially with people looking for new ways to make passive income — it’s no surprise that Lortopulix has started gaining traction. If you’re like me, you probably want a platform that’s easy to use, solid with features, and not sketchy.

In this **Lortopulix review**, I’m breaking it all down: what it is, who made it, how it works, what I liked (and what I didn’t), and whether you should give it a shot. This isn’t another sales pitch — it’s the information I wish I had before signing up.

## What is Lortopulix?

Lortopulix is an **automated trading platform** designed to help users trade assets like cryptocurrencies, stocks, and forex with minimal manual effort. It uses algorithms to analyze the market, identify trends, and supposedly execute trades at optimal moments.

Think of it like a **smart trading assistant** that works while you sleep. You set your parameters (risk level, asset types, trading volume), and the system does the heavy lifting. Platforms like this are often compared to Bitcoin Era or Immediate Edge in how they function.

It’s aimed at people who want to enter the trading space without needing to become full-on experts. So whether you’re new or just looking to automate part of your trading strategy, Lortopulix seems to be built with that in mind.

## Who Created Lortopulix?

Here’s the thing — the creators behind Lortopulix aren’t exactly public. Just like with other platforms like Bitcoin Code or Immediate Edge, you won’t find a “Meet the Team” page or any LinkedIn profiles. That might raise an eyebrow, and I get it.

But this isn’t super uncommon in the world of trading bots. Many platforms keep their development teams anonymous, partly to avoid direct liability and partly because it’s a crowded marketplace. Despite the mystery, the platform functions fairly well and seems to be maintained regularly.

Personally, I’d love more transparency here. But the functionality and support seem to make up for it.

## How Does Lortopulix Work?

Lortopulix uses **automated algorithms** to scan markets, analyze data, and execute trades based on patterns and trends. It’s like having a high-speed trader in your pocket, minus the emotional decision-making.

Here’s a simple breakdown:

- You sign up, deposit funds, and choose your trading preferences.
- Lortopulix’s software monitors real-time market data.
- When it spots a potentially profitable opportunity, it places a trade automatically.
- You can sit back, adjust settings as needed, and monitor performance.

The platform supports **both automated and manual trading**, so if you want more control, you can switch off the AI and trade yourself.

## Lortopulix Pros and Cons

Here’s what stood out after using Lortopulix for a few weeks:

### Pros

- Offers a **free demo account** to test before risking real money
- Works with **multiple asset types** (crypto, forex, stocks)

- **Mobile-friendly** and accessible on smartphones and tablets

### Cons
- **No transparency** around founders or regulatory status
- Requires a **minimum $250 deposit**
- No mobile app (just mobile-optimized website)
- May not suit advanced traders who want deep analytics

Overall, most of the drawbacks are typical of platforms in this category. Not deal-breakers, but things to be aware of.

### Multiple Asset Trading

This is a big one: you’re not just limited to crypto. You can also trade **forex, stocks, and CFDs**, which makes it feel more like a full-service trading platform than just a crypto bot.

## What is Estable Rentix?

Estable Rentix is a **web-based automated trading platform** that uses algorithms and real-time data analysis to help users buy and sell assets like cryptocurrencies, forex, and stocks. Think of it as your trading assistant that doesn’t sleep or take coffee breaks—it’s always scanning the markets for opportunities.

What makes Estable Rentix stand out is that it’s designed with accessibility in mind. You don’t need to be a Wall Street wizard to use it. Whether you’re a total beginner or someone who’s been trading for years, the platform tries to make complex market strategies simple and executable.

## Who Created Estable Rentix?

So far, there’s no single high-profile founder attached to Estable Rentix, which is pretty common in the automated trading space. What we do know is that the platform was reportedly built by a team of experienced financial analysts, software developers, and AI engineers. That checks out, considering the UI and backend logic feel pretty polished.

This is similar to platforms like **Bitcoin Era** or **Immediate Edge**, where the focus is more on delivering a functional tool rather than building a personality-driven brand. While some might see the lack of a public founder as a red flag, in the world of automated platforms, it’s more the norm than the exception.

### [🔥 Start Trading with Estable Rentix Today](https://tinyurl.com/24cxvnan)
## How Does Estable Rentix Work?

At its core, Estable Rentix operates using **algorithmic trading bots**. These bots analyze large sets of market data, identify patterns, and execute trades automatically based on pre-set parameters. You get to choose your risk level, asset preferences, and even set stop-losses or take-profit points.

The platform claims to use **AI-driven logic** to adapt to market shifts in real time. In simple terms: it tries to buy low and sell high, faster than any human could. You don’t need to sit and watch charts all day, which is a win for people with jobs, families, or just a desire to not go cross-eyed staring at candlesticks.

## Estable Rentix Pros and Cons

Like every platform, Estable Rentix has its strengths and a few weak spots.

**Pros:**
- ✅ **Automated trading** lets you trade 24/7 without constant attention.
- ✅ **Supports multiple asset types**, not just crypto.
- ✅ **Low entry barrier** with a $250 minimum deposit.
- ✅ **Demo mode** available for practice.
- ✅ **Beginner-friendly UI** that doesn’t feel overwhelming.
- ✅ **Customizable strategies** for more advanced users.
- ✅ **Fast withdrawals** (typically 1–2 days).

**Cons:**
- ❌ No mobile app (but mobile browser works well).
- ❌ Not available in all countries.
- ❌ Lack of transparency about the team behind it.
- ❌ Automated trading means you still need to monitor now and then—it's not a ""set it and forget it"" forever.

## What Devices Can be Used to Access Estable Rentix?

Estable Rentix is **web-based**, which means you don’t need to download anything. You can access it from:

- United States

Some countries might be restricted due to local financial regulations, so your best bet is to try signing up and see if you're eligible. They’ll let you know during the registration process.

## Estable Rentix – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

This is one of the standout features for me. Estable Rentix’s algorithm constantly scans market data and makes split-second decisions based on trends. You can literally see the platform evaluating conditions live, which feels like having a personal trading analyst on call 24/7.

### User-Friendly Interface

The dashboard is clean, intuitive, and doesn’t bombard you with confusing financial jargon. You’ve got real-time stats, quick access to your portfolio, and simple buttons for setting up trades or adjusting your strategy.

### Customizable Alerts

### Multiple Asset Trading

Estable Rentix isn’t just a crypto trading bot. You can trade **Bitcoin, Ethereum, Forex pairs, stocks, and even commodities**. That kind of variety is great for diversifying your portfolio.

## Is Estable Rentix a Scam?

The short answer: **Doesn’t look like it**.

I didn’t find any red flags like fake testimonials, impossible claims, or shady withdrawal practices. The platform is transparent about its features, offers a demo account, and links users to regulated brokers. That said, always remember: **No trading platform is risk-free**. If someone tells you you’re guaranteed to make money, run the other way.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Estable Rentix?

The minimum deposit is **$250**, which is pretty standard for platforms in this space. You can fund your account using:

- Credit/Debit Cards
- Bank transfers
- E-wallets (varies by region)

Personally, I’d recommend starting with the minimum until you’re familiar with the platform and confident in your strategy.

### Estable Rentix Customer Support

Customer support is available **24/7 via live chat and email**. I tested this out with a couple of common questions and got responses within minutes. The reps seem knowledgeable and not just reading from a script, which is rare these days.

## How do you start trading on Estable Rentix?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Go to the Estable Rentix homepage and fill out the basic form—name, email, phone number. No crazy paperwork or long verification processes.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

Once signed up, you’ll be connected with a broker who will help verify your identity. After that, deposit a minimum of $250 to get started.

### Step 3: Start Trading

Use the demo if you want to practice first. If you’re ready, set your parameters (risk level, asset types, etc.) and activate the bot. Sit back and monitor as the platform begins executing trades for you.

## How to Delete an Estable Rentix Account?

If you decide the platform’s not for you, just contact customer support and request account deletion. They’ll usually ask for verification and process your request within a few days. Just make sure to withdraw any funds first.

That said, it’s not magic. You’ll still need to monitor your trades, adjust your settings, and be smart about your investments. But if you’re looking for a **low-barrier entry point into algorithmic trading**, Estable Rentix is worth checking out.

  He saw the first tree shudder and fall, far off in the distance. Then he heard his mother call out the kitchen window: “Luke! Inside. Now.”  
  
  He had never disobeyed the order to hide. Even as a toddler, barely able to walk in the backyard’s tall grass, he had somehow understood the fear in his mother’s voice. But on this day, the day they began taking the woods away, he hesitated. He took one extra breath of the fresh air, scented with clover and honeysuckle and—coming from far away—pine smoke. He laid his hoe down gently, and savored one last moment of feeling warm soil beneath his bare feet. He reminded himself, “I will never be allowed outside again. Maybe never again as long as I live.”  
  
  He turned and walked into the house, as silently as a shadow.  
  
  “Why?” he asked at the supper table that night. It wasn’t a common question in the Garner house. There were plenty of “how’s”—How much rain’d the backfield get? How’s the planting going? Even “what’s”—What’d Matthew do with the five-sixteenth wrench? What’s Dad going to do about that busted tire? But “why” wasn’t considered much worth asking. Luke asked again. “Why’d you have to sell the woods?”  
  
  Luke’s dad harrumphed, and paused in the midst of shoveling forkfuls of boiled potatoes into his mouth.  
  
  “Told you before. We didn’t have a choice. Government wanted it. You can’t tell the Government no.”  
  
  Mother came over and gave Luke’s shoulder a reassuring squeeze before turning back to the stove. They had defied the Government once, with Luke. That had taken all the defiance they had in them. Maybe more.  
  
  “We wouldn’t have sold the woods if we hadn’t had to,” she said, ladling out thick tomatoey soup. “The Government didn’t ask us if we wanted houses there.”  
  
  She pursed her lips as she slid the bowls of soup onto the table.  
  
  “But the Government’s not going to live in the houses,” Luke protested. At twelve, he knew better, but sometimes still pictured the Government as a very big, mean, fat person, two or three times as tall as an ordinary man, who went around yelling at people, “Not allowed!” and “Stop that!” It was because of the way his parents and older brothers talked: “Government won’t let us plant corn there again.” “Government’s keeping the prices down.” “Government’s not going to like this crop.”  
  
  “Probably some of the people who live in those houses will be Government workers,” Mother said. “It’ll all be city people.”  
  
  If he’d been allowed, Luke would have gone over to the kitchen window and peered out at the woods, trying for the umpteenth time to picture rows and rows of houses where the firs and maples and oaks now stood. Or had stood—Luke knew from a sneaked peek right before supper that half the trees were now toppled. Some already lay on the ground. Some hung at weird angles from their former lofty positions in the sky. Their absence made everything look different, like a fresh haircut exposing a band of untanned skin on a forehead. Even from deep inside the kitchen, Luke could tell the trees were missing because everything was brighter, more open. Scarier.  
  
  “And then, when those people move in, I have to stay away from the windows?” Luke asked, though he knew the answer.  
  
  The question made Dad explode. He slammed his hand down on the table.  
  
  “Then? You gotta stay away now! Everybody and his brother’s going to be tramping around back there, to see what’s going on. They see you—” He waved his fork violently. Luke wasn’t sure what the gesture meant, but he knew it wasn’t good.  
  
  No one had ever told him exactly what would happen if anyone saw him. Death? Death was what happened to the runt pigs who got stepped on by their stronger brothers and sisters. Death was a fly that stopped buzzing when the swatter hit it. He had a hard time thinking about himself in connection with the smashed fly or the dead pig, gone stiff in the sun. It made his stomach feel funny even trying.  
  
  “I don’t think it’s fair we’ve got to do Luke’s chores now,” Luke’s other brother, Mark, grumbled. “Can’t he go outside some? Maybe at night?”  
  
  Luke waited hopefully for the answer. But Dad just said, “No,” without looking up.  
  
  “It’s not fair,” Mark said again. Mark was the second son—the lucky second, Luke thought when he was feeling sorry for himself. Mark was two years older than Luke and barely a year younger than Matthew, the oldest. Matthew and Mark were easily recognizable as brothers, with their dark hair and chiseled faces. Luke was fairer, smaller-boned, softer-looking. He often wondered if he’d ever look tougher, like them. Somehow he didn’t think so.  
  
  “Luke don’t do nothing nohow,” Matthew jeered. “We won’t miss his work at all.”  
  
  “It’s not my fault!” Luke protested. “I’d help more if—”  
  
  Mother laid her hands on his shoulders again. “Hush, all of you,” she said. “Luke will do what he can. He always has.”  
  
  The sound of tires on their gravel driveway came through the open window.  
  
  “Now, who—” Dad started. Luke knew the rest of the sentence. Who could that be? Why were they bothering him now, his first chance all day to sit down? It was a question Luke always heard the end of from the other side of a door. Today, skittish because of the woods coming down, he scrambled up faster than usual, dashing for the door to the back stairs. He knew without watching that Mother would take his plate from the table and hide it in a cupboard, would slide his chair back into the corner so it looked like an unneeded spare. In three seconds she would hide all evidence that Luke existed, just in time to step to the door and offer a weary smile to the fertilizer salesman or the Government inspector or whomever else had come to interrupt their supper.  
  
  CHAPTER TWO  
  
  There was a law against Luke.  
  
  Not him personally—everyone like him, kids who were born after their parents had already had two babies.  
  
  Actually, Luke didn’t know if there was anyone else like him. He wasn’t supposed to exist. Maybe he was the only one. They did things to women after they had their second baby, so they wouldn’t have any more. And if there was a mistake, and a woman got pregnant anyway, she was supposed to get rid of it.  
  
  That was how Mother had explained it, years ago, the first and only time Luke had asked why he had to hide.  
  
  He had been six years old.  
  
  Before that, he had thought only very little kids had to stay out of sight. He had thought, as soon as he was as old as Matthew and Mark, he would get to go around like they did, riding to the backfield and even into town with Dad, hanging their heads and arms out the pickup window. He had thought, as soon as he got as old as Matthew and Mark, he could play in the front yard and kick the ball out into the road if he wanted. He had thought, as soon as he got as old as Matthew and Mark, he could go to school. They complained about it, whining, “Jeez, we gotta do homework!” and, “Who cares about spelling?” But they also talked about games at recess, and friends who shared candy at lunchtime or loaned them pocketknives to carve with.  
  
  Somehow, Luke never got as old as Matthew and Mark.  
  
  The day of his sixth birthday, Mother baked a cake, a special one with raspberry jam dripping down the sides. At supper that night she put six candles on the top and placed it in front of Luke and said, “Make a wish.”  
  
  Staring into the ring of candles—proud that the number of his years finally made a ring, all around the cake—Luke suddenly remembered another cake, another ring of six candles. Mark’s. He remembered Mark’s sixth birthday. He remembered it because, even with the cake in front of him, Mark had been whining, “But I wanna have a party. Robert Joe had a party on his birthday. He got to have three friends over.” Mother had said, “Ssh,” and looked from Mark to Luke, saying something with her eyes  
that Luke didn’t understand.  
  
  Startled by the memory, Luke let out his breath. Two of his candles flickered, and one went out. Matthew and Mark laughed.  
  
  “You ain’t getting that wish,” Mark said. “Baby. Can’t even blow out candles.”  
  
  Luke wanted to cry. He’d forgotten even to make a wish, and if he hadn’t been surprised he would have been able to blow out all six candles. He knew he could have. And then he would have gotten—oh, he didn’t know. A chance to ride to town in the pickup truck. A chance to play in the front yard. A chance to go to school. Instead, all he had was a strange memory that couldn’t be right. Surely Luke was thinking about Mark’s seventh birthday, or maybe his eighth. Mark couldn’t have known Robert Joe when he was six, because he would have been hiding then, like Luke.  
  
  Luke thought about it for three days. He trailed along behind his mother as she hung wash out on the line, made strawberry preserves, scrubbed the bathroom floor. Several times he started to ask, “How old do I have to be before people can see me?” But something stopped him every time.  
  
  Finally, on the fourth day, after Dad, Matthew, and Mark scraped back their chairs from the breakfast table and headed out to the barn, Luke crouched by the kitchen’s side window—one he wasn’t supposed to look out because people driving by might catch a glimpse of his face. He tilted his head to the side and raised up just enough that his left eye was above the level of the windowsill. He watched Matthew and Mark running in the sunlight, the tops of their hog boots thumping against their knees. They were in full sight of the whole world, it seemed, and they didn’t care. They were racing to the front door of the barn, not the side one off the backyard that Luke always had to use because it was hidden from the road.  
  
  Luke turned around and slid to the floor, out of sight.  
  
  “Matthew and Mark never had to hide, did they?” he asked.  
  
  Mother was scrubbing the remains of scrambled eggs out of the skillet. She turned her head and looked at him carefully.  
  
  “No,” she said.  
  
  “Then why do I?”  
  
  She dried her hands and left the sink, something Luke had almost never seen her do if there were still dirty dishes left to be washed. She crouched beside him and smoothed his hair back from his forehead.  
  
  “Oh, Lukie, do you really need to know? Isn’t it enough to know—things are just different for you?”  
  
  He thought about that. Mother was always saying he was the only one who would ever sit on her lap and cuddle. She still read bedtime stories to him, and he knew Matthew and Mark thought that was sissified. Was that what she meant? But he was just younger. He’d grow up. Wouldn’t he be like them then?  
  
  With unusual stubbornness, Luke insisted, “I want to know why I’m different. I want to know why I have to hide.”  
  
  So Mother told him.  
  
  Later, he wished he’d asked more questions. But at the time it was all he could do to listen to what she told him. He felt like he was drowning in the flow of her words.  
  
  “It just happened,” she said. “You just happened. And we wanted you. I wouldn’t even let your dad talk about . . . getting rid of you.”  
  
  Luke pictured himself as a baby, left in a cardboard box by the side of a road somewhere, the way Dad said people used to do with kittens, back when people were allowed to have pets. But maybe that wasn’t what Mother meant.  
  
  “The Population Law hadn’t been around long, then, and I had always wanted lots of kids. Before, I mean. Getting pregnant with you was like—a miracle. I thought the Government would get over their foolishness, maybe even by the time you were born, and then I’d have a new baby to show everyone.”  
  
  “But you didn’t,” Luke managed to say. “You hid me.”  
  
  His voice sounded strangely hoarse, like it belonged to someone else.  
  
  Mother nodded. “Once I started showing, I didn’t go anywhere. That wasn’t hard to do—where do I go, anyway? I didn’t let Matthew and Mark leave the farm, for fear they’d say something. I didn’t even say anything about you in letters to my mother and sister. I wasn’t really scared then. It was just superstition. I didn’t want to brag. I thought I’d go to the hospital to give birth. I wasn’t going to keep you secret forever. But then . . .”  
  
  “Then what?” Luke asked.  
  
  Mother wouldn’t look at him.  
  
  “Then they started running all that on TV about the Population Police, how the Population Police had ways of finding out everything, how they’d do anything to enforce the law.”  
  
  Luke glanced toward the hulking television in the living room. He wasn’t allowed to watch it. Was that why?  
  
  “And your dad started hearing rumors in town, about other babies . . .”  
  
  Luke shivered. Mother was looking far off into the distance, to where the rows of new corn plants met the horizon.  
  
  “I always wanted a John, too,” she said. “ ‘Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, bless the bed that I lie on.’ But then I thank the Lord that I have you, at least. And it’s worked out, the hiding, hasn’t it?”  
  
  The smile she offered him was wobbly. He felt he had to help her.  
  
  “Yes,” he said.  
  
  And somehow, after that, he didn’t mind hiding so much anymore. Who wanted to meet strangers, anyway? Who wanted to go to school, where—if Matthew and Mark were to be believed—the teachers yelled, and the other boys would double-cross you if you didn’t watch out? He was special. He was secret. He belonged at home—home, where his mother always let him have the first piece of apple pie because he was there and the other boys were away. Home, where he could cradle the new baby pigs in the barn, climb the trees at the edge of the woods, throw snowballs at the posts of the clothesline. Home, where the backyard always beckoned, always safe and protected by the house and the barn and the woods.  
  
  Until they took the woods away.  
  
  CHAPTER THREE  
  
  Luke lay on his stomach on the floor and idly ran the toy train back and forth on the track. The train had belonged to Dad when he was a little boy, and his own father before him. Luke could remember a time when his greatest longing had been for Mark to outgrow the train so Luke could have it all to himself. But it wasn’t what he wanted to play with today. There was a beautiful day unfolding outside, with fleecy clouds in a blue, blue sky, and a mild breeze rustling the grass in the backyard. He hadn’t left the house in a week now, and he could almost hear the outdoors calling to him. But now he wasn’t even allowed in the same room as an uncovered window.  
  
  “Are you trying to be discovered?” Dad had bellowed at Luke just that morning, when he’d held the shade a few inches back from the kitchen window and peeked out longingly.  
  
  Luke jumped. He’d been so busy thinking about running barefoot through the grass that he’d half-forgotten there was anyone or anything behind him, in the house.  
  
  “No one’s out there,” he said, glancing again to be sure. He’d been trying not to look beyond the ragged edge of the backyard to the bulldozed mess of branches, trunks, leaves, and mud that had once been his beloved woods.  
  
  “Yeah?” Dad said. “Did it ever occur to you that if there is, they might see you before you see them?”  
  
  He grabbed Luke by the arm and jerked him back a good three feet. Freed from Luke’s grasp, the bottom of the shade banged against the windowsill.  
  
  “You can’t look out at all,” Dad said. “I mean it. From now on, just stay away from the windows. And don’t go into a room unless we’ve got the shades or curtains pulled.”  
  
  “But then I can’t see anything,” Luke protested.  
  
  “Better that than to get turned in,” Dad said.  
  
  Dad sounded like he might feel sorry for Luke, but that only made things worse. Luke turned around and left, scared he might cry in front of Dad.  
  
  Now he gave the toy train a shove, and it careened off the track. It landed upside down, wheels spinning.  
  
  “Who cares?” Luke muttered.  
  
  There was a harsh knock on his door.  
  
  “Population Police! Open up!” />  
  Luke didn’t move.  
  
  “That’s not funny, Mark!” he shouted.  
  
  Mark opened the door and bounded up the stairs that led to Luke’s room proper. Luke’s room was also the attic, a fact he had never minded. Mother long ago had shoved all the trunks and boxes as far as they could go under the eaves, leaving prime space for Luke’s brass bed and circular rag rug and books and toys. Luke had even heard Matthew and Mark grumble about Luke having the biggest room. But they had windows.  
  
  “Scared you this time, didn’t I?” Mark asked.  
  
  “No,” Luke said. Nothing would force him to admit that his heart had jumped. Mark had been playing the “Population Police” joke for years, always out of their parents’ earshot. Usually Luke just ignored Mark, but now, with Dad acting so skittish . . . What would Luke have done if it really had been the Population Police? What would they do to him?  
  
  “Matt and me, we’ve never told anyone about you,” Mark said, suddenly serious, which was strange for him. “And you know Mother and Dad don’t say anything. You’re good at hiding. So you’re safe, you know?”  
  
  “I know,” Luke muttered.  
  
  Mark kicked the toy train Luke had crashed. “Still playing with baby toys?” he asked, as if to make up for slipping and being nice.  
  
  Luke shrugged. Normally, he wouldn’t have wanted Mark to know he played with the train anymore. But today everything else was so bad that that didn’t matter.  
  
  “Did you come up here just to bug me?” Luke asked.  
  
  Mark put on an offended look.  
  
  “Thought you might want to play checkers,” he said.  
  
  Luke squinted.  
  
  “Mother told you to, right?” he asked.  
  
  “No.”  
  
  “You’re lying,” Luke said, not caring how nasty he sounded.  
  
  “Well, if you’re going to be that way—”  
  
  “Just leave me alone, okay?”  
  
  “Okay, okay.” Mark backed down the stairs. “Jeez!”  
  
  Alone again, Luke felt a little sorry he’d been so mean. Maybe Mark had told the truth. Luke should apologize. But he didn’t really feel like it.

Luke got up and started pacing his room. The squeak of the third board in from the stairs annoyed him. He hated having to duck under the rafters on the far side of his bed. Even his favorite model cars, lined up on the shelves in the corner, bothered him today. Why should he have model cars? He’d never even sat in a real one. He never would. He’d never get to do anything or go anywhere. He might as well just rot up here in the attic. He’d thought about that before, on the rare occasions when Mother, Dad, Matthew, and Mark all went somewhere and left him behind—what if something happened to them and they never came back? Would someone find him years from now, abandoned and dead? He’d read a story in one of the old books in the attic about a bunch of kids finding a deserted pirate ship, and then a skeleton in one of the rooms. He’d be like that skeleton. And now that he wasn’t allowed in rooms with uncovered windows, he’d be a skeleton in the dark.  
  
  Luke looked up automatically, as if to remind himself that nothing lit the rafters but the single bulb over his head. Except—there was light at either end of the ceiling, leaking in under the peak of the roof.  
  
  Luke stood up and went to investigate. Of course. He should have remembered. There were vents at each end of the roof. Dad grumbled occasionally about heating the attic for Luke—“It’s just like throwing money out those vents”—but Mother always fixed him with one of her stares, and nothing changed.  
  
  Now Luke climbed on top of one of the largest trunks and looked down through the vent. He could see out! He could see a strip of the road and the cornfield beyond, its leaves waving in the breeze. The vent slanted down and limited his view, but at least he was sure nobody would ever be able to see him.  
  
  For a moment, Luke was excited, but that quickly faded. He didn’t want to spend the rest of his life watching the corn grow. Without much hope, he stepped down from the trunk and went to the other end of the attic, the portion that faced the backyard. He had to slide boxes around and drag an old step stool from the opposite end of the attic, but finally his eyes were level with the back vent.  
  
  The view was not of the backyard—it was too close—but of the former woods. He’d never realized it before, but the land there sloped away from his family’s house, so he had a clear view of acres and acres that once had been covered with trees. The land was abuzz with activity now. Huge yellow bulldozers shoved brush back from a rough road that had been traced out with gravel. Other vehicles Luke couldn’t identify were digging holes for huge concrete pipes. Luke watched in fascination. He knew tractors and combines, of course, and had seen his dad’s bush hog and manure spreader and gravity wagons up close, in the barn. But these machines were different, designed for different jobs. And they were all operated by different people.  
  
  Once, when Luke was younger, a tramp had walked up to the house and Luke had only had time to hide under the sink in the mudroom before the man was in the house, begging for food. The door of the cabinet was cracked, so Luke had been able to peek out and see the man’s patched trousers and holey shoes. He’d heard his whiny voice: “I ain’t got no job, and I ain’t et in three days . . . . No, no, I can’t do no farmwork for my food. What do you think I am? I’m sick. I’m starving . . . .”  
  
  Other than that tramp and pictures in books, Luke had never seen another human being besides his parents and Matthew and Mark. He’d never dreamed there was such variety.  
  
  Many of the people running the bulldozers and shovel contraptions were stripped of their shirts, while others standing nearby even wore ties and coats. Some were fat and some were thin; some were browned by the sun and some were paler than Luke himself, who would never be tan again. They were all moving—shifting gears and lowering pipe, waving others into position or, at the very least, talking at full speed. All that activity made Luke dizzy. The pictures in books always showed people still. Overwhelmed, Luke closed his eyes, then opened them again for fear of missing something.  
  
  “Luke?”  
  
  Reluctantly, Luke slid down from his step stool perch and scrambled over to recline innocently on his bed.  
  
  “Come in,” he called to his mother.  
  
  She climbed the stairs heavily.  
  
  “You okay?”  
  
  Luke dangled his feet over the side of the bed.  
  
  “Sure. I’m fine.”  
  
  Mother sat on the bed beside him and patted his leg.  
  
  “It’s—” she swallowed hard. “It’s not easy, the life you’ve got to live. I know you’d like to look outside. You’d like to go outside—”  
  
  “That’s okay, Mother,” Luke said. He could have told her then about the vents—he didn’t see how anyone could object to him looking out there—but something stopped him. What if they took that away from him, too? What if Mother told Dad, and Dad said, “No, no, that’s too much of a risk. I forbid it”? Luke wouldn’t be able to stand it. He kept silent.  
  
  Mother ruffled his hair.  
  
  “You’re a trooper,” she said. “I knew you’d hold up all right.”  
  
  Luke leaned against his mother’s arm, and she moved her arm around his shoulders and hugged him tight to her side. He felt a little guilty for keeping a secret, but mostly reassured—loved and reassured.  
  
  Then, more to herself than to him, Mother added, “And things could be worse.”  
  
  Somehow, that wasn’t comforting. Luke didn’t know why, but he had a feeling what she really meant was that things were going to get worse. He snuggled tighter against Mother, hoping he was wrong.  
  
  CHAPTER FOUR  
  
  Luke found out what Mother meant a few days later when he came down for breakfast. As usual, he opened the door from the back stairs to the kitchen only a crack. He could remember barely a handful of times in his entire life when someone had dropped by before breakfast, and each time Mother had managed to send Matthew or Mark up to warn Luke to stay out of sight. But he always checked. Today he could see Dad and Matthew and Mark at the table, and knew from the sound of frying bacon that Mother must be at the stove.  
  
  “Are the shades closed?” he called softly.  
  
  Mother opened the door to the stairs. Luke started to step into the kitchen, but she put out her arm to keep him back. She handed him a plate full of scrambled eggs and bacon.  
  
  “Luke, honey? Can you eat sitting on the bottom step there?”  
  
  “What?” Luke asked.  
  
  Mother looked beseechingly over her shoulder.  
  
  “Dad thinks—I mean, it’s not safe anymore to have you in the kitchen. You can still eat with us, and talk to us and all, but you’ll be . . . over here.”  
  
  She waved her hand toward the stairs behind Luke.  
  
  “But with the shades pulled—” Luke started.  
  
  “One of those workers asked me yesterday, ‘Hey, farmer, you got air-conditioning in that house of yours?’ ” Dad said from the table. He didn’t turn around. He didn’t seem to want to look at Luke. “We keep the shades pulled, hot day like today, people get suspicious. This way is safer. I’m sorry.”  
  
  And then Dad did turn around and glance at Luke, once. Luke tried to keep from looking upset.  
  
  “So what’d you tell him?” Matthew asked, as if the worker’s question was only a matter of curiosity.  
  
  “Told him of course we don’t have air-conditioning. Farming don’t make nobody a millionaire.”  
  
  Dad took a long sip of coffee.  
  
  “Okay, Luke?” Mother asked.  
  
  “Yes,” he mumbled. He took the plate of eggs and bacon, but it didn’t look good to him now. He knew every bite he ate would stick in his throat. He sat down on the step, out of sight of both kitchen windows.  
  
  “We’ll leave the door open,” Mother said. She hovered over him, as if unwilling to return to the stove. “This isn’t too much different, is it?”  
  
  “Mother—” Dad said warningly.  
  
  Through the open windows, Luke could hear the rumble of several trucks and cars. The workers had arrived for the day. He knew from watching through the vent the past few days that the caravan of vehicles came up the road like a parade. The cars would  
peel off to the side and unload the nicer dressed men. The more rugged vehicles pulled on in to the muddiest sections, and the people inside would scatter to the bulldozers and backhoes that had been left outside overnight. But the vehicles barely had time to get cold, because the workers were there now from sunup to sundown. Someone was in a hurry for them to finish.  
  
  “Luke—I’m sorry,” Mother said, and scurried back to the stove. She loaded a plate for herself, then sat down at the table, beside Luke’s usual spot. His chair wasn’t even in the kitchen anymore.  
  
  For a while, Luke watched Dad, Mother, Matthew, and Mark eating in silence, a complete family of four. Once, he cleared his throat, ready to protest again. You can’t do this—it’s not fair— Then he choked back the words, unspoken. They were only trying to protect him. What could he do?  
  
  Resolutely, Luke stuck his fork in the pile of scrambled eggs on his plate and took a bite. He ate the whole plateful of food without tasting any of it.  
  
  CHAPTER FIVE  
  
  Luke ate every meal after that on the bottom step. It became a habit, but a hated one. He had never noticed before, but Mother often spoke too softly to be heard from any distance, and Matthew and Mark always made their nasty comments under their breath. So they would start laughing, often at Luke’s expense, and he couldn’t defend himself because he didn’t know what they had said. He couldn’t even hear Mother saying, “Now, be nice, boys.” After a week or two, a lot of the time, he didn’t even try to listen to the rest of the family’s conversation.  
  
  But even he was curious the hot July day when the letter arrived about the pigs.  
  
  Matthew brought the mail in that day from the mailbox at the crossroads a mile away. (Luke had never seen them, of course, but Matthew and Mark had told him there were three mailboxes there, one for each of the families that lived on their road.) Usually the Garners’ mail was just bills or thin envelopes carrying curt orders from the Government about how much corn to plant, which fertilizer to use, and where to take their crop when it was harvested. A letter from a relative was a cause to celebrate, and Mother always dropped whatever she was doing and sat down to open it with trembling hands, calling out at intervals, “Oh, Aunt Effie’s in the hospital again . . . .” or, “Tsk, Lisabeth’s going to marry that fellow after all . . . .” Luke almost felt he knew his relatives, though they lived hundreds of miles away. And, of course, they didn’t even know he existed. The letters Mother wrote back, painstakingly, late at night, when she’d saved up enough money for a stamp, contained plenty of news of Matthew and Mark, but never once had mentioned Luke’s name.  
  
  This letter was as thick as some from Luke’s grandmother, but it bore an official seal, and the return address was an embossed DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN HABITATION, ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS DIVISION. Matthew held the letter at arm’s length, the way Luke had seen him hold dead baby pigs when they had to be carried out of the barn.  
  
  Dad looked worried the minute he saw the letter in Matthew’s hand. Matthew put the letter down beside Dad’s silverware. Dad sighed.  
  
  “Can’t be anything but bad news,” Dad said. “No use ruining a good meal. It can wait.”  
  
  He went back to eating chicken and dumplings. Only after his last belch did he turn the envelope over and run a dirt-rimmed fingernail under the flap. He unfolded the letter.  
  
  “ ‘It has come to our attention . . . ,’ ” he read aloud. “Well, so far I understand it.” Then he read silently for a while, calling out at intervals, “Mother, what’s ‘offal’?” and, “Where’s that dictionary? Matthew, look up ‘reciprocity.’ ” Finally, he threw down the whole thick packet and proclaimed, “They’re going to make us get rid of our hogs.”  
  
  “What?” Matthew asked. More serious than Mark, he had talked for as long as anyone could remember about, “When I get my own farm, it’s going to be all hogs. I’ll make the Government let me do that, somehow . . . .” Now he looked over Dad’s shoulder. “You mean they’re just going to make us sell a lot at one time, right? But we can build the herd back up—”  
  
  “Nope,” Dad said. “Those people in them fancy new houses won’t be able to stand pig smell. So we can’t raise hogs no more.” He threw the letter out into the center of the table for all to see. “What’d they expect, building next to a farm?”  
  
  From his seat on the stairs, Luke had to hold himself back from going to fish the edge of the letter out of the chicken gravy and looking at it himself.  
  
  “They can’t do that, can they?” he asked.  
  
  Nobody answered. Nobody needed to. Luke felt like a fool for asking as soon as the words were out of his mouth. For once, he was glad of his hiding place.  
  
  Mother twisted a dishrag in her hand.  
  
  “Those hogs are our bread and butter,” she said. “With grain prices the way they are . . . what are we going to live on?”  
  
  Dad just looked at her. After a moment, so did Matthew and Mark. Luke didn’t know why.  
  
  CHAPTER SIX  
  
  The tax bill arrived two weeks later, the day that Dad, Matthew, and Mark loaded the hogs onto the livestock trailer and took them all away. Most were going to the slaughterhouse. The ones too young and too small to bring a decent price were going to an auction for feeder pigs. Luke watched through the vent at the front of the house as Dad drove by in the battered pickup with each load. Matthew and Mark sat in the back of the pickup, making sure the trailer stayed hitched right. Even three stories up, Luke could see Matthew’s hangdog expression.  
  
  Then when the three of them came into the house for dinner, after washing the last of the hog smell off their hands in the mudroom, Dad handed Mother the tax bill without comment. She put down the wooden spoon she’d been using to stir the stew and unfolded the letter. Then she dropped it.  
  
  “Why, that’s—” she seemed to be doing the math in her head as she bent to retrieve it. “That’s three times what it usually is. There must be a mistake.”  
  
  Dad shook his head grimly. “No mistake. I talked to Williker at the auction.”  
  
  The Willikers were their nearest neighbors, with a house three miles down the road. Luke always pictured them with monster scales and fierce claws because of the number of times he’d been cautioned, “You don’t want the Willikers to see you.”  
  
  Dad went on. “Williker says they raised everyone’s taxes because of them fancy houses. Makes our land worth more.”  
  
  “Isn’t that good?” Luke asked eagerly. It was strange—he should hate the new houses for replacing his woods and forcing him to stay indoors. But he’d half-fallen in love with them, having watched every foundation poured, every wooden skeleton of walls and roofs raised to the sky. They were his main entertainment, aside from talking to Mother when she came upstairs for what she called “my Luke breaks.” Sometimes she pretended his room needed cleaning as badly as the bread needed baking or the garden needed weeding. Sometimes she just sat and talked.  
  
  Dad was shaking his head in disgust over Luke’s question.  
  
  “No. It’s only good if we’re selling. And we ain’t. All it means for us is that the Government thinks they can get more money out of us.”  
  
  Matthew was slumped in his chair at the table. “How are we going to pay?” he asked. “That’s more than we got for all the hogs, and that was supposed to carry us through for a long time—”  
  
  Dad didn’t answer. Even Mark, who normally had a smart-alecky comeback for everything, was stupefied.  
  
  Mother had turned back to her stew.  
  
  “I got my work permit today,” she said softly. “The factory’s hiring. If I get on there, I can maybe get an advance on my paycheck.”  
  
  Luke’s jaw dropped.  
  
  “You can’t go to work,” he said. “Who will—” He wanted to say, Who will stay with me? Who will I talk to all day when everyone else is outside? But that seemed too selfish. Luke looked around. No one else looked surprised by Mother’s news. He shut his mouth.  
  
  CHAPTER SEVEN  
  
  By mid-September, Luke’s days had fallen into a familiar pattern. He got up  
at dawn just for the chance to sit on the stairs and watch the rest of his family eat breakfast. They all rushed now. Mother had to be at the factory by seven. Dad was trying to get all the machinery in working order before harvest. And Matthew and Mark were back in school. Only Luke had time to linger over his undercooked bacon and dry toast. He didn’t bother asking for butter because that meant someone would have to stand up and bring it over to him, all the while pretending for the sake of the open window that they’d just forgotten something upstairs.  
  
  As soon as the rest of his family had stomped out the door, Luke went back to his room and watched out the vents—first out the front, to see Matthew and Mark climb onto the school bus, then out the back, where the new houses were practically finished. They were mansions, as large as the Garners’ house and barn put together. They gleamed in the morning sunlight as though their walls were studded with precious jewels. For all Luke knew, maybe they were.  
  
  Hordes of workmen still arrived every morning, but almost all of them worked indoors now. They headed into the houses first thing, carrying rolls of carpet, stacks of drywall, cans of paint. Luke couldn’t see much of them after that. He spent more time now watching a new kind of traffic: expensive-looking cars driving slowly down the newly paved streets. Sometimes they pulled into a driveway and went into one of the houses, usually trailing a woman who appeared to be talking nonstop. It had taken Luke a while to figure it out—he certainly hadn’t dared ask anyone else in his family—but he thought maybe the people were thinking about buying the houses. Once he realized that, he studied each potential neighbor carefully. He’d overheard Mother and Dad marveling that the people moving into the new houses were not just going to be city people, but Barons. Barons were unbelievably rich, Luke knew. They had things ordinary people hadn’t had in years. Luke wasn’t sure how the Barons had gotten rich, when everybody else was poor. But Dad never said the word “Baron” without a curse word or two in front of it.

1mix8h5,https://www.reddit.com/r/interviews/comments/1mix8h5/how_my_brain_went_on_vacation_during_the_capital/,How my brain went on vacation during the Capital One Case interview!,"So, I walk into this Capital One case interview feeling like a data ninja. I had prepped for weeks. I’d done mock interviews, reviewed frameworks, even practiced explaining breakeven analysis to my houseplants. They didn’t get it, but I felt ready. I thought, *“This is it. I’m about to impress them so hard they’ll create a new position just for me — Chief Business Analyst of Awesomeness.”*

But the moment I joined the Zoom call?  
My brain packed its bags and went on safari.

First question:  
“How does a cable company generate revenue?**”**  
Now any normal day, I’d say, “Easy, subscriptions.” But in that moment? I confidently blurted out:

“Uhh…through movies… and like… other stuff?”

Yes. Other stuff.  
Even *I* didn’t know what “other stuff” meant. I think my soul left my body and hovered above like, “Really?”

Next, they hit me with a profit calculation. Easy, right? I had done a million of those. But my brain was like:

*“Nah bro, let’s just stare at the screen for dramatic effect.”*

Then came break-even analysis. I asked for a minute, not to think, just to silently panic. I stared at my paper like it was written in ancient Greek. The numbers didn’t add up because I couldn’t even start.

I asked for more time. Twice. By now, the interviewer probably thought I was doing long division on a sundial.

Eventually, I said something, a number I completely made up, like I was playing *Interview Jeopardy*.

“What is… 8,000 units?”  
(Wrong.)

Then came the final blow.  
**Interviewer:** “Do you have any questions for me?”  
**Me:** “Yes—no—I mean, I already asked all my questions.”  
I hadn’t asked *a* single thing. 

After the interview, I closed my laptop, ordered myself a good meal, laid on the floor, and whispered to the ceiling:

“Let’s never speak of this again.”

But here’s the thing, I knew the answers. If you gave me the same question over coffee or during a casual chat, I’d ace them. 

Turns out, interviews aren’t always a test of your knowledge, sometimes, they’re just a test of whether your brain wants to participate that day. Solving for X won’t help if your mind blanks under stress, prep your nerves like you prep your formulas.

 Good luck to everyone doing a case interview!",2,1754461635.0,interviews,0,1.0,False

It’s likely backed by a group of developers and traders who’ve worked on similar tools before.

Marrow Creek is a small town in the panhandle of Texas. Many outsiders consider it to be a place for truckers to stop or a place to come visit and hunt white tail deer. This town’s day-to-day life feels like home to me though: the summer carnival, the faded booths at our local diner, the one me and my friends frequent when we don't want to go back home.  
  
  
I wake to the hum of my alarm at 6:45 and slap it silent before my eyes even open. Through my window, Main Street yawns awake. The old storefronts lined up like old friends, and Lee’s Cinema flickering a faded sign; “Now Showing: The Final Hour.” Looking back at my room, I sigh out heavily. I’ve got a learner’s permit crumpled in my wallet and a stack of college applications glaring at me from my desk. I push off the covers, pull on faded jeans, then reach for the one shirt that still feels electric: a black tee crudely stamped with the logo band. The band’s name is barely legible but still pleasing to look at.



My braid still loose, I head downstairs where Mom is already at the counter, scooping sugar into her coffee. She glances at my shirt and her eyebrow arches. “Julie’s band shirt again? You know she’s—”



I catch the memory of Julie’s smile, the way her hair tumbled across my pillow after our last late-night tryst. “It’s just a shirt, Mom.” I tell her, my hand tugging on the fabric. “Besides, her music’s solid.”



Mom sets down the sugar jar with a little sigh. “Just promise me you’re not still… hooked on her like last summer. I know she means a lot to you, but all that rock stuff, the weird clothing, that ‘music’.. If you can even call it that” She offers a half-smile that doesn’t quite reach her eyes.



Dad mutes the TV and tilts his head at us, giving mom a wave of the controller. “Hey, it’s Mia’s life,” he says, voice low, slowing down every word with his southern drawl. “She’s eighteen. If she wants to be around Julie, that’s her call.” He nudges his glasses back into place and hits unmute. Dad settled back into the couch, the soft glow of the news reflecting off his dark skin while the local newspaper lies forgotten on the coffee table. I spot the crumpled pack of Lucky Strikes peeking out of his shirt pocket, the one I’ve half-joked about snagging later so I don’t have to buy my own.   
  
""That Andy boy still hanging around?” she asks, casual but pointed. “Has he figured out what he’s doing with that gap year of his?”



I grab a banana from the bowl and peel it slowly, buying time. “He’s… figuring it out,” I say. “He’s been filming stuff. Street interviews, weird little shorts. Says he might apply to that arts program in Austin.”



Mom hums, not quite approving, not quite dismissive. “He’s got a good eye. Just hope he doesn’t waste it waiting for inspiration to strike.”



Dad shifts on the couch, the remote resting on his stomach like a paperweight. He pushes his glasses up with a knuckle and glances over. “Andy’s got heart,” he says, voice slow and steady. “That counts for something. Hell, I didn’t know what I was doing at eighteen either.”



The news flickers across the screen, some story about visitors that went missing in the woods not too far from us.  



“He’s trying,” I say, more to myself than anyone. “He just needs time.”



Mom sips her coffee, watching me over the rim. “Just make sure he’s not dragging you down while he’s figuring it out.”



I nod, but my mind’s already drifting, thinking about Andy’s camera bag, the way he talks about lighting like it’s a living thing, and the way he always looks like he’s on the edge of discovering something no one else sees. I eventually wave goodbye to mom and dad, slide off the porch steps and hop onto my bike, the morning sun warming my dark skin through the gaps in my T-shirt.  
  
As I ride through town, the people I’ve seen everyday walk by. The emo kids who promised they would get out of this town when they graduated. My old rugby coach, now pushing a stroller with a baby inside. The abandoned liquor store no one cared to clean up after its owners' skipped town and moved to Louisiana.   
  
 I coast two blocks over to Park’s Corner Store. As I pull up, I see Mr. and Mrs. Park have a friendly argument in what sounds like rapid-fire Korean, then switch to English with a nod when they see me locking my bike on its rack.



“Good morning, Mia,” Mrs. Park says, handing me an apron, the same faded green as the store’s peeling sign. Behind her, Mr. Park is lining up bottles of coke by color, brown to clear, like he’s got an OCD rainbow going. I grab the price gun and a stack of price stickers. “A lot of restocking today,” I mutter, scanning the shelves for anything low.



Between customers, I sweep the front floor and wipe fingerprints off the glass cooler. The bell above the door jingles every two minutes; early risers grabbing coffee, joggers picking up Gatorade, old Mr. Thompson wrestling with lottery cards and crosswords in the hopes of winning billions. I’m halfway through counting cash behind the counter when the door chimes again.



Julie slips in first, leather jacket over her faded black tee, her red curls around each side of her neck, the same ones I remember twirling in drunken flirtation. Andy trails behind, camera bag slung over his shoulder. They both spot me and grin.



“Hey, there Mia,” Julie says, leaning on the counter. She flicks a half-smoked cigarette into the trash can. Thank god Mrs. Park doesn’t see.



“Morning,” I reply, brushing down my apron. Andy is already browsing the candy aisle. “You guys grabbing snacks for band practice?”



“Actually,” Andy says, holding up a bag of gummy bears like they’re Nobel Prize contenders, “we ran out of caffeine at my place.” He waves a half-empty can of energy drink.



Mrs. Park calls out from behind me, “Mia, could you help the next customer? Julie, thank you for choosing our store.” She smiles politely. Julie tenses—but thankfully, no lecture today about how she can’t get a discount on American spirits.



I ring up the gummy bears and Julie’s energy drink. When I hand the receipt over, Julie winks. “See you tonight?”



I tuck my hair behind my ear. “Wouldn’t miss it.”



As they head out, Andy still munching on gummies, I turn back to the shelves, ready to lose myself in price stickers and quiet hours, at least until my shift ends and the outside world calls again.   
  
The bell above the door jingles, and I glance up from restocking the gum rack. A couple walks in, mid-thirties maybe, both wearing matching denim jackets like they planned it. They move through the aisles with that easy rhythm people have when they’ve been together a while, laughing softly as they pass the snack section.



“I’ve been waiting to see this movie for months,” the woman says, clutching a bottle of soda like it’s part of her outfit. “The practical effects are supposed to be insane. Like, Rob Bottin-level insane.”



I pause, half-listening as I straighten a row of Tic Tacs.   
  
  
Rob Bottin? That’s a deep cut. Respect.



The man chuckles, pulling a pack of popcorn from the shelf. “You and your creepy creature features,” he says, then pats his jeans. “Wait, hold up. I think I left my ticket in the car.”



She groans playfully. “You promised you wouldn’t forget it this time.”



“I didn’t forget it,” he says, already heading toward the door. “I just… temporarily misplaced it. There’s a difference.”



She rolls her eyes and turns to me with a smile. “Men and their pockets, right?”



I grin, or at least try to give a customer service smile. “They’re like black holes. Things go in, never come out.”



She laughs, then leans on the counter. “You ever seen The Thing?”



“Only like five times,” I say. “That blood test scene? Iconic.”



Her eyes light up. “Yes! That’s what I’m saying.”



The door jingles again as the guy returns, ticket triumphantly in hand. “Crisis averted.”



They pay for their snacks, still bantering, and I watch them go, two people wrapped in movie magic and popcorn dreams. I turn back to the register, the quiet settling in again, but with a little warmth lingering.



After a few hours, I snap the register closed, tuck my apron into the shelf under the register, and push out the door into the golden haze of the late afternoon. Julie’s leaning against the lamppost across the street, arms crossed, red curls catching that light like embers.



 Andy’s already puffing on his vape, smoke bellowing out of his nose. .



“Movie tonight?” I call out, dusting a stray fleck of dust off my jeans. Julie’s lips curve into a half-smile as she nods toward Lee’s Cinema down the block. Its sign still advertises last month’s blockbuster.



“I’ve heard good things about it,” I say to the two of them, “Or at least, heard costumers today say it was supposed to be good.” 



Andy shrugs and grins. “Why pay ten bucks when we could pirate it? HD, pause whenever, no lines.” He holds up an imaginary remote like it’s a mic, pretending to be a street reporter. 



I shake my head before Julie can. “It doesn't give the same feeling, and it doesn’t support anyone who actually made the movie.” 



Julie bumps my shoulder. “Exactly. I miss that ritual. The hush when the lights go down, the projector hum. You can’t replicate that on your laptop.” 



Andy pretends to be convinced, then throws his arms up in surrender. “But if you have a personal home theatre, it would. Plus, horror movies that rely too much on the ambience of the movie theatre often suck. All enjoyment leaves when a spooky PNG lunges at the camera. But fine. Let’s do it old school.”



As we finally get to Mister Lee’s movie theatre, we don’t see his son, Jeremiah, in the ticket booth. We step to the door and see a small, chrome automatic gate. A small slit beneath a screen waiting for us to either put in our pre-paid tickets, or buy them here. 



“Huh, when did Mister Lee get this?” I ask, slightly puzzled.



Julie gives me a raised eyebrow, “I’m not sure, but it’s definitely an upgrade.” 



Andy steps up and presses his credit card to the screen. 



“Thanks man.” I tell him, “I’ll pay you back later.”



Andy shrugs. “It’s fine. Just don’t make me watch another one of those ‘Iceberg videos’ as payback.”



We push through the double doors into the theater corridor. The air inside is cooler, still, like the building’s holding its breath. Posters line the walls—some faded, some new—but there’s no movement. No chatter. No staff.



Julie slows, glancing around. “Where is everyone?”



I scan the concession stand. No one was behind the counter, but popcorn was still popping. soda machines humming. No “Hello, welcome in.” from Neil or Janice, just silence.



“Maybe they’re in the back?” I offer, ”Huh… weird.”.



Andy keeps walking, hands in his pockets, eyes fixed ahead. “They’re probably on break. Or hiding from the late shift.”



Julie and I exchange a look but follow. The carpet muffles our steps as we pass empty arcade machines and cardboard cutouts of smiling actors frozen mid-pose. but Andy’s already swaggering down the hall, hands in pockets, oblivious. The walls are papered with fading movie posters, their edges curling like old film reels. The air smells faintly of dust and stale popcorn.



Julie and I hang back a little, our steps slow, voices low.



“You doing anything Friday?” she asks, brushing her fingers against mine like it does nothing to me.



I smile. “Depends. Is this a trick question or are you gonna ask me out?”



She grins. “Underground show. My band’s playing. It’s in the basement of that old laundromat on 6th. You should come.”



“Sounds sketchy,” I whisper, leaning in. “I’m in.”



Julie laughs softly, the sound echoing just a little too much in the empty hallway. “Good. I’ll save you a spot near the amps. You’ll feel it in your ribs.” She tells me as she bumps into my shoulder, now fully intertwining our hands.



We reach the theater doors, and Andy pushes them open.. Inside, rows of empty red seats glow under the soft blue of the projector. A single reel whirs at the back, the hum filling the space like a heartbeat.



Julie pauses in the aisle. “Are you sure this is cool?”



Andy waves us forward. “They’re probably all outside, chain smoking, or stocking concessions.”



He tells us, walking down the isle., settling into a seat near the middle. I flop down beside him, Julie on my other side. We stretch out our legs, feet dangling over the edge of the riser.



Julie leans in again, her breath warm against my ear, voice barely audible. “You’ll like our closing song. It’s about a girl who gets lost in a dream because someone made it feel too real to leave.”



I turn to her, eyebrow raised. “Sounds familiar.”



She smirks, eyes dancing. “Maybe I wrote it about someone.”



Then she lets the silence linger just long enough before adding, “Or maybe I just didn’t want to say your name out loud.”



I’m about to reply when Julie stiffens slightly, her gaze flicking toward the front row.



“Hey… someone’s already here.”



I follow her eyes. Just visible above one of the seats is a strange tuft of hair, dark, oddly shaped, like it’s been sculpted rather than styled. They don't move. Don’t shift. Just sit there, perfectly still.



Andy squints. “Huh. Thought we had the place to ourselves.”



The figure doesn’t turn. From where we sit, we can only see the top of their head and the faint outline of their shoulders. The coat they wear is tattered, hanging stiffly around their frame. Something about their posture is too jagged, like they’re purposefully sitting in the most uncomfortable position, or have horrible spinal issues. 



Julie leans in. “Do you think it’s Mister Lee?”



Andy shrugs. “Maybe. Or someone who really wanted the best seat.”



It sounds like someone gasping for air, each word dragged out like it hurts to speak. Raspy, strained, yet deliberate. As if she’s forcing the sound through lungs that forgot how to breathe.



It’s the kind of voice you hear in a dream right before you wake up sweating. A whisper that shouldn’t be real, but somehow is. My stomach tightens, cold and sudden..



Julie tilts her head, then whispers: “Did she say something?”



Andy nods slowly. “Yeah. Said she’s been waiting.”



We glance toward the front row again. The figure hasn’t moved.



But now, we’re watching it. Before we know it, it turns its head with a sharp snap and a sickening creak, the sound unmistakably like bone grinding against bone.



The motion is unnatural, jerky, as if the neck were a hinge forced past its limit. It rotates like an owl’s, far beyond human range, until its face, sagging and drooping over itself, is pointed directly at the three of us.



Its mouth hangs open, slack and useless. No lips move. No jaw shifts from the unintentional frown plastered on its face.



But it speaks.



Now a man’s voice, calm and eerily familiar once again, echoes through the space of the nearly empty movie theatre. “Hey… I lost my… ticket. Have you seen it? Can you help me find it?”



The voice is wrong. Too clean. Too rehearsed. It doesn’t belong in this place, doesn’t belong to this thing. It’s as if someone pressed play on a recording buried inside its chest.



Where its eyes should be, there are only black holes. empty sockets—voids. Depthless, lightless, swallowing everything they touch. Looking into them feels like standing on the edge of a cliff and realizing the cliff is looking back.



Julie’s breath catches. Andy doesn’t blink. I slowly stand up from my chair, grabbing Julie's hand and slapping Andy in the chest to stand with me.   
  


The monster tilts its head further, the creaking intensifying, as if the bones are splintering under the strain. The voice repeats.



“Hey… I lost my ticket…”



Same tone. Same words. But this time, it sounds closer. Not louder, closer. Like it’s inside our ears. Or behind our eyes.



It doesn’t move. But something shifts.  
  


With a sudden burst of motion, the monster climbs.



It doesn’t walk. It doesn’t crawl. It scrambles—quick and insect-like—onto the row of movie seats in front of them. The sound is a chaotic mix of tearing fabric, creaking metal, and something wet slapping against vinyl.



Its posture defies anatomy.



The creature’s head hangs upside down, twisted backward at an impossible angle. Its belly faces the ceiling, spine arched grotesquely. Yet somehow, it balances—each limb planted on a separate seat, hands and feet splayed like a grotesque marionette.



The seats groan beneath its weight, but it remains perfectly still.



ts black-hole eyes scan us, though the head doesn’t move. It doesn’t need to. The voids seem to know where we are.



I don’t wait for it to speak again.



 I yank Julie’s hand and grab Andy toward the aisle. “Go,” I hiss, my voice shaking, barely louder than a breath. “Now.” 



The thing doesn’t move, but the air around it feels like it’s tightening, like the room itself is bracing for something. The voice echoes again—same words, same tone—but it’s louder now. 



“Can you…  help me find it?” 



We bolt. Julie stumbles over the armrest, nearly falling into the next row. I grab her, pulling her upright as we sprint down the aisle. My heart is hammering so hard I can’t hear anything else. Not the movie. Not the voice. Just the thud of our feet and the creak of the seats behind us. I glanced back once. It hasn’t chased us. It hasn’t moved. But it’s watching. Its limbs are still splayed across the seats, head upside down, mouth slack. But the black holes where its eyes should be, they’re locked on us.



And I swear, as we reach the exit, I hear it again. Not from the speakers. Not from the room. From inside my chest. 



“Don’t forget…  your ticket…” 



We burst through the theater doors into the lobby, gasping, shaking, blinking against the fluorescent lights. But the warmth of safety doesn’t come.



The lobby is silent, too silent, like sound itself has been sucked out of the air. No staff. No popcorn machines humming. No distant chatter from other screens. Just the flickering buzz of overhead lights and the echo of our footsteps.



We reach the front doors.



They’re glass. Wide. Clear. Locked.



Andy grabs the handle and yanks. Nothing. He slams his shoulder into it. Still nothing.



“No, no, no—” he mutters, voice cracking.



Julie tries the other side, rattling the metal bar like it might suddenly give. I press my face to the glass. Outside, the parking lot is still. The street beyond is dark. No cars. No lights. No movement.



Andy lets out a shout, half rage, half panic, and grabs a metal trash can from beside the concession stand. He hurls it at the door with a grunt. The glass shatters, a spiderweb of shards exploding outward. He doesn’t hesitate. He tries to climb through.



But the jagged edge catches him.



A long, deep gash tears across his forearm. Blood spills fast, dark and glistening. My head immediately spins at the destruction to his skin and the pool of blood that starts to form around the shattered window.  He doesn’t even flinch. Just keeps scrambling through, now his torso’s outside, driven by pure terror even as the smell of copper waffs through the air.



Julie screams and grabs him, pulling him back before he can destroy himself further. “You’re bleeding!” she cries, voice shrill.



Andy stares at his arm, dazed, like he’s seeing it from someone else’s body.



I grab both of them. “Back door.” My voice is low, firm. “We try the back. Now.”



They nod, breathless, eyes wide.



Behind us, the theater doors creak.



Not swing open like they should.



Just… shift, a tuft of hair spilling through the crack.



Like something is leaning against the door. Watching us like a child playing hide and seek.



We run again, deeper into the building. Past the concession stand. Past the empty arcade machines. Past the cardboard cutouts of smiling actors frozen in mid-laugh that feels like they're taunting us.



And somewhere behind us, faint and echoing, the voice returns and the sounds of creaking limbs tapping against carpet follows us.



“Hey… What time… are we meeting?”  
  
  
We skid through the employee lounge, Andy’s blood streaking the tile like a warning we’re too late to heed.   
  
Every scuttle, every low creak from the shadows behind us sends a jolt up my spine. I keep whipping around, heart pounding, expecting something—anything—to lunge from the dark. But all I see is the hallway stretching behind us, empty and still, save for the fading echo of our own frantic footsteps.



Julie yanks at the handle. Locked. She rattles it hard enough to bend the metal bar. No give.



Andy’s breath catches. He presses his palm to the cut on his forearm. Red beads slip between his fingers. His chin quivers. Then he breaks—tears spill, voice cracking. “I… I can’t do this.”



I drop beside him and grip his shoulders. “You can. We’re getting out. Look at me.” My hands are slick with his blood, but I force calm into my voice. “We’re getting the fuck outta here… just try and focus, okay?”



Back from where we came, the scuttling intensifies. sharp, erratic, like too many limbs scraping against tile. Then comes a low, splintering creak, the kind that sounds like bone grinding against rusted metal. Something presses against the frame from the other side of the wall. A tuft of matted, oily hair slips through the crack, dragging slowly across the wall like it’s tasting the grain. Slowly, it's face rounds the corner, its saggy skin still dropped in its insidious frown.



I push off the wall, pulse thundering in my ears. “There—window,” I shout, nodding toward the narrow service pane beside the exit. It’s the kind they use to keep eyes on coworkers during late-night trash runs, just enough visibility to make sure no one disappears.



Julie finds a discarded steel concession tray. She grips it like a battering ram. I step back and nod.



With one shoulder planted, she swings. Metal slams glass. The pane fractures in a web of white cracks, then explodes outward into the alleyway. Julie and I clean the glass shards from the window before quickly climbing out of it.



Andy stumbles. I catch him, press him through the gap. His back scrapes against the frame, thin ribbons of pain across his skin. He grits his teeth, but keeps moving.



We spilled out into the alley. Night air slaps our faces. The pungent smell of trash bins and damp concrete replaces the stale theater scent. Julie helps Andy to his feet; I check his arm, deep cut but not life-ending.



Behind us, the back door quivers on its hinges. No footsteps yet. Just that heavy breathing of the building settling.



We press against the brick wall, hearts hammering in the dark. Our breaths hang in white puffs. For a moment, it’s silent.

“Wanna go.. For… a jog?” A feminine voice echoes out of the window we just fell from. Its voice sounds like it's echoing from inside its own ribcage, spilling out of its fleshy mouth and overlapping itself. My pulse spikes again. We’re not safe. Not even out here.   
  
Andy barely gets a step before a hand erupts from the window—jagged, wet, and wrong. It clamps over his face with a sickening squelch, fingers like split muscle and bone wrapping around his skull. He screams, but it’s muffled, swallowed by the monster’s grip.



Then comes the sound. Not a crack. Not a pop. A slow, wet compression—like cartilage grinding under weight. His head is forced sideways against the brick wall, and the pressure builds. His legs kick, arms flail, but the hand doesn’t budge. Julie reaches for him, too late.



His skull begins to cave. Blood vessels burst in his eyes. His jaw dislocates with a sharp snap. The brick drinks in the mess as his head collapses inward, bone folding like paper, skin splitting in ribbons. A final twitch, and his body goes limp.



The hand retracts, dragging what’s left of him through the window with a slick, meaty sound. The frame shudders. Then silence. Just the faint drip of blood down the wall and the echo of our breathing, ragged and terrified. A strangled scream dies on my lips as Julie yanks me backward, her grip searing through my jacket. The window slams shut with a wet, sickening thud, and the alley plunges into absolute silence, so complete it feels like the world’s holding its breath, waiting for us to move.



Julie’s nails dig into my arm. “We have to go,” she whispers, voice trembling. Her eyes flick toward the brick wall where Andy’s last footprints smeared in blood. I blink twice, a shake twisting through my limbs, then I force my legs forward.



We stumble down the alley, hearts pounding so loud I’m sure the thing inside heard them. My boots splash in a puddle of muck—our only tracks now—while my mind replays Andy’s face, that final, hollow pop against the wall. Every step threatens to buckle me, but Julie’s steady pull keeps me upright.



At the alley’s mouth, a lone streetlamp buzzes to life, casting jaundiced light over garbage bags that look like twisted corpses in the gloom. We pause, gasping for air. I scan left and right—no cars, no people, nothing but shadows. My phone slips from my pocket; its cracked screen glows uselessly. No signal. No help.



Behind us, the brick gives a soft scrape. My pulse screeches. We whirl, nothing. Just the empty shaft of darkness. Yet I feel its gaze, pressing through the bricks, tracking us like prey. Julie presses her palm against my back, urging me forward.



Together we cross the street, sprinting toward a block of shuttered shops. Neon letters flicker, spelling nothing coherent, but promise light. We’re bleeding adrenaline, lungs burning, and every muscle screams to collapse.

When we bought this house, my favorite selling point was the large oak tree in the backyard. Not only did it offer shade, but it added the picturesque quality to the property that had me smiling at my husband and nodding my head.

When we walked the lot that day, I firmly placed a hand on my growing belly and the other on the tree.

“Perfect place for a swing, don’t you think?”, I asked, gazing up at the endless green leaves waving hello in the breeze.

“Yeah, I think so. They’ll love it.”, he responded, taking my hand from the tree and kissing it softly.

The second I saw the sunlight hit his golden hair, making it glow, I knew this was the place for us.

We bought the house that afternoon.

Jackson had the swing installed that weekend.

And 4 months later, I gave birth to my babies. My twins. 

A boy and a girl, just like I always wanted.

They were escorted to the NICU right away, as they were premature like most twins are.

And sadly, my beautiful Rosalie didn’t make it through the night.

Umbilical cord problems.

They told me she was so small and frail, that I wouldn’t be able to hold her even once.

I saw her for a moment, when she was taken from me during my C-section.

She had a birthmark in a shape resembling a heart on her right shoulder.

Then she was gone.

I cried as I held Reese in my arms. The grief of losing one and the love of holding the other was all-consuming.

“Don’t worry, my love. I have you.”, I had whispered against his skin.

And now, our life has a new normal.

We planted a rose bush in our backyard, next to the oak tree. So she would always be part of this place.

I wasn’t sure if the roses would bloom, but that spring, they did.

As they have every year since.

Reese is now 5, and he loves the swing more than anything.

Every morning, he waits for me by it. I trudge out in my robe, cup of coffee in hand, while he bounces with excitement.

“Mommy, it’s time! I was extra patience this time!”, he cheers.

“‘Patient’, my darling. You were very ‘patient’ this morning, you’re right!”, I tell him, placing my coffee down next to me on the garden table.

His brow furrows in confusion.

“That’s what I said, right?”, he wonders.

I laugh at his expression.

“Yes you did, now let’s climb on.”, I chuckle, helping him into the wooden seat.

His golden hair shines the same way Jackson’s does.

Same routine, every morning.

And I wouldn’t trade it for anything.

Except Reese is starting kindergarten next week.

I push him back and forth, while he squeals and shrieks. He has spent every day with me since he was born, and the thought of sending him somewhere else every day is shattering my heart. I had half a mind to keep him home with me, try homeschooling. But Jackson discouraged it.

“It will be good for him, you can’t be his only friend.”, he said, rubbing my back.

I sighed, and begrudgingly agreed.

“Are you excited to make some new friends?”, I asked between pushes.

“Yeah!”, he cheers.

Well, that settles that.

After our morning ritual, I tell Reese it’s time for his breakfast.

He jumps off the swing, and holds my hand as we cross the backyard.

“Morning, Rosie.”, he sings, waving his fingers at the rose bush.

We cross the backyard porch, and he bounces into the house at full speed.

I turn to close the sliding glass door, and kiss my fingertips before touching the glass.

“Morning, my darling girl.”

*

The next week goes by in a flash.

Jackson and I drop off Reese at kindergarten, with his new backpack that is bigger than he is.

I do admit, I cry when I hug him goodbye.

“Be such a good boy today, I will see you at 3.”, I say into his hair.

“Okay, Mommy. I’ll be good!”, he cheers, before turning to Jackson for a similar exchange.

After our (my) tearful goodbye, he takes his new teacher’s hand and heads into the school painted with primary colors.

We took him to a school the next town over because of their fantastic ratings, we want to give him every opportunity.

Jackson has taken the day off work, to help my transition. He would never say it, but I know he thinks I am a nervous wreck about Reese.

I am self aware enough to know he isn’t entirely wrong.

We spend the day doing my favorite things. Lunch, shopping, couples massage, and I’m feeling lighter every minute. So much so, that I don’t even realize it’s time to pick up Reese.

When Jackson and I wait outside the school, he looks at me out of the corner of his eye.

“How do you feel?”, he asks.

“I missed him.. But I feel okay, surprisingly.”, I respond, with a smile that comes naturally.

He takes my hand and squeezes it.

“I’m proud of you, you did great today.”, he beams at me.

Just then, I see the top of Reese’s head walking out the door, his eyes light up when he sees us.

“Mommy! Daddy!”, he yells, running to us like we’ve been reunited after a journey away.

Before we can even ask, he barrels into his whole day and his feelings about it.

“We had cupcakes for snack!”

“We sang Baby Shark!”

“I made this many friends,” he says, holding up 4 fingers.

“You made friends? On your very first day? That’s our rockstar!”, Jackson cheers, ruffling Reese’s hair.

“Yup. Two boys, and two girls. I think Taylor is my favorite friend, we like all the same things, but Blake is my second favorite friend. I told them they should come see our swing some day after school!”, he says excitedly.

I smile at his bright eyes, he really is a great kid.

Jackson wraps the 3 of us into a hug, and says we are going to order pizza tonight to celebrate. Reese jumps in excitement so much that his unzipped backpack falls off, spilling his take-home papers everywhere.

“Oops! I got it!”, he yells, bending his little legs to gather the papers.

Jackson puts his arm around my shoulders and chuckles, and I can’t help but think about how lucky I am.

What was I so scared of?

*

Several weeks later, I get a call from an unknown number on my phone.

“Hello? This is Claire.”, I say into the receiver.

“Claire? Hello, this is Emma Mason. Our kids are both in Ms. Kerwin’s class.”, a woman’s voice responds.

“Oh hello, Emma. I’m sorry, who is your child? I’m sure Reese has mentioned them.”, I say, putting down the pan I was just cleaning.

“Taylor,  I hear they are becoming fast friends.”, she responds.

“Yes! Taylor! Reese told me they liked to hunt for bugs at recess.”, I laugh.

Emma groans into the phone.

“Yes, yes that’s mine. The bug phase has been my least favorite.”, she sighs into the phone.

“Oh yes, I didn’t like the bug phase myself. Reese told me Taylor’s cousin is also in the class?”, I ask, sitting back on the couch.

“Yes! Blake, the 3 of them are so funny with the mischievous things they tell me about. I was hoping to set up a play date with you, if that was okay. We don’t normally do play dates a lot but the kids are begging to see Reese, is that alright?”, she asks, tentatively.

“Of course, I’m sure Reese would love that. When are you free?”, I respond.

I’ve never hosted a play date before, I make a mental note to run to Costco beforehand for snacks.

We plan a time for them to come this Saturday, and hang up.

Emma seemed lovely too, maybe her and I could be friends.

Jackson picks up Reese from school, and when they come in, Reese is practically bouncing off the walls.

“I take it that you’re excited?”, I ask between laughs.

“Yea! I want to show them my room! And my swing! And my toys! Mom, can we have the pizzas on the bagels?”, he pleads, holding his hands together.

“Sure my love, whatever you want.”, I say, kissing him on the forehead.

He cheers and runs up the stairs to his room.

“I met Emma today, and the kids, they seem nice.”, Jackson says, opening the fridge to grab a beer.

“I’m glad you will be here, 3 little boys will outnumber me and Emma.”, I laugh, picking up my teacup and putting it in the sink.

Jackson takes a swig of beer before looking at me with confusion.

“Blake and Taylor are girls.”, he corrects.

“Oh, oh I just thought.. Oh okay.”, I stammer.

“Yeah, cousins. Emma said she picks up Blake and helps with her because her parents work long hours, she said they are both total tomboys though.”, he explains.

“Well I’m sure the 3 of them will have a great time, thank you for the heads up though.”, I tell him, taking out my notebook and writing down my grocery list.

“Yeah of course, I’ve got your back.. I know you’re stressed with getting the right snacks and making this play date perfect. But I want to ask one thing, if that’s okay…”, he says, crossing to me.

“Hmm?”, I ask, putting the pen down.

He looks at me seriously, and for a moment my heart drops.

“What, Jackson?”, I ask.

“Can you get peanut butter pretzels from Costco?”, he asks with the serious expression.

I playfully swat him away.

“Oh you’re terrible, go on!”, I laugh.

He walks up the stairs, laughing every step.

*

Saturday afternoon arrives, and I have cleaned my house twice.

I have scrubbed every surface, laid out a pleasing assortment of snacks. From fruit, and veggies with peanut butter, all the way to Goldfish and pizza bagels.

What? Kids like options.

When the doorbell rings, Jackson goes to get it.

I hear voices coming from the foyer, and Reese runs down the stairs just as they are crossing into the living room.

“You’re here!”, Reese yells.

The 3 kids bounce and shriek in unison for several seconds before calming down.

They are all similar in height, I see Taylor has blonde hair and Blake has red. They are all dressed in T-shirts and sneakers.

Emma appears behind them, hair in a messy bun, leggings and a sweatshirt on.

“Hi Claire, so good to meet you in person! I’m Emma, and blondie over there is mine, Taylor. And the redhead is Blake, my niece.”, she says, smiling at me.

I smooth my floral print dress self-consciously.

Oh god, I am way overdressed.

Jackson is in jeans and a t shirt, and I look like I’m going to church.

I can feel the panic attack starting to rise.

Emma is standing there, waiting for me to respond.

I run my hands over my dress again and look around sheepishly.

Jackson notices, and begins to walk over, when Emma speaks.

“Your dress is so pretty, I think I saw it online. Nordstrom, right?”, she asks.

“Oh, yes. Yes, that’s right. I’m so sorry, I’ve never.. Had anyone over like this. I wasn’t sure what to..”, I look down at my nude heels.

I wish the floor would open and swallow me up.

“Well you look STUNNING!”, she says, “Seriously, so beautiful. But if you aren’t comfortable, you can always change! Or don’t, I’m easy, don’t you worry about me. Though I may try to steal that dress from you if I stare at it any longer.”, she laughs, winking.

My shoulders relax, and I can see Jackson relax over her shoulder.

“You know what, I think I will change. Would you excuse me a moment?”, I ask.

She waves me off, and tells me she will handle getting the kids some snacks.

I walk upstairs, and Jackson follows me.

“Are you okay?”, he asks, his eyes searching my face.

“I am, she seems nice. I’m just a little anxious, I’m sure it’s just the kids being loud. It’s like the second they all came in, I felt nauseous, and I think I was just trying too hard.”, I respond, taking a baggy pair of jeans and t-shirt out of my closet.

“Okay, I’ll see you down there.”, he says, kissing my hand like he always does, before leaving the room.

I change quickly, and I’m looking in my mirror, trying to place my hair in a ponytail, when I hear a small voice.

“Hi.”

I jump.

Blake is standing at my bedroom door.

She really is a tomboy.

She has her long red hair tied up in two braids. She has a baggy Superman shirt on, with jeans and red converse.

“Oh hi Blake, I’ll be down in just a minute. Did you need something?”, I ask, giving up on my hair and putting a claw clip in it.

“Taylor is in the bathroom downstairs, so Reese said I can use the one up here, I don’t know where it is though.”, she tells me.

“Oh of course, sweetie. Let me show you.”, I get up and lead her to the hallway bathroom, because it’s more kid friendly.

“Thank you.. Mrs. Reese’s Mom.”, she says, shyly.

“You can call me Claire.”, I tell her.

She smiles.

“I’ll wait right out here for you, okay?”, I tell her.

She nods, and closes the door.

What a polite girl.

When she comes out, I tell her that her hair is beautiful.

“Thank you..”, she says shyly, blushing.

“Do your parents have the same hair?”, I ask.

She shakes her head.

“It’s just my mom, and she has brown hair.”, she tells me.

“You know what, my great-great-grandma Jolie had red hair I’m told, but none of her kids had it. That’s funny, right?”, I ask her.

She giggles.

“Yeah that’s funny!”, she says.

We’ve rejoined the party by now, and the kids have torn through the snacks.

Taylor and Reese are whispering to each other and giggling when we return.

Blake skips to rejoin them.

Emma looks up and smiles.

“Love the jeans!”, she winks.

And I smile at her.

After the kids eat, Reese asks if we can go outside.

Jackson excuses himself to take a work call, but says he will be in his office if we are getting overrun by the kids.

I pour Emma and myself a glass of lemonade, and we head out to sit on the chairs sitting on the back patio.

We just sit down when I hear Reese’s voice.

“And that’s where my sister lives!”, he says, pointing at the rose bush.

“Your sister lives outside?”, Blake asks, with her mouth wide open.

“Was she bad?”, Taylor asks.

“No! She lives in heaven! But this is just her spot.”, he explains.

Taylor and Blake seem to accept that answer, and start playing with the baseball set on the grass.

I know Emma heard Reese, but she’s being polite.

“Reese was a twin..”, I explain.

She turns to me, and says nothing.

“He had a sister, Rosalie. They were born prematurely, and she didn’t make it. So we planted the roses so she has a place here with us.”, I tell her.

“Oh Claire.. I’m so sorry. That’s just awful, I’m sorry you had to go through that.”, she says, reaching out her hand to hold mine for a moment.

“Thank you.. We have our good and bad days. Reese handles it well, as well as you can, I guess. He talks to her a lot though, I catch him out here talking to the roses..”, I choke on the last word.

“We don’t have to talk about it, if you don’t want to.”, Emma says, reassuringly.

I nod, and give her a sad smile.

We watch the kids play for a few minutes, and it seems so natural. 

Makes me wonder why I waited to long to encourage Reese to make friends.

I turn to Emma, to ask her about herself, when we hear a shriek.

Our heads both jerk to the noise, and Taylor is sitting on the ground, holding her foot.

“Mom!!”, Reese cries.

Emma and I stand up, and go to the kids.

Taylor is in tears, and can’t even form a sentence.

“What happened?”, I ask.

“Taylor was running, and she slipped on the grass.”, Blake explains.

“Is that right?”, Emma asks Taylor.

She nods between sobs.

Emma raises her pants leg, and looks at the leg.

“It’s not broken, but let’s put some ice on it just in case.”, she says, wiping her tears.

“Are you sure? I can watch Blake if you want to take her to urgent care.”, I tell her.

She shakes her head.

“Oh no, she will be okay. I’m actually an ER nurse. Blake’s mom too, she’s my sister.”, she explains, picking up Taylor.

“Well I know who I’m calling for any weird rash.”, I say, trying to make a joke.

Emma laughs.

“I got you! Do you guys have ice packs?”, she asks.

“Yes, in the freezer. Help yourself.”, I tell her as she disappears into the house.

I turn to see Reese and Blake and they look traumatized.

“Hey guys, Taylor will be okay. Just a boo boo. Let’s keep playing and he will join us when he’s ready.”, I say, patting both of them on the shoulder.

“Reese, why don’t you show her your swing?”, I suggest.

“Okay!”, he says, taking Blake’s hand and running to the oak tree.

I sit on the steps of the patio, and lean back on my elbows.

I see them taking turns pushing each other, giggling and shrieking with joy. 

“Mommy! Come push us!”, Reese yells.

I smile, and walk over to them.

“Okay, get close together..”, I warn.

They scoot right next to each other and put an arm around each other.

“Ready!”, they cheer.

I pull the swing back, and let it go.

They squeal as they go higher and higher.

I laugh with them.

I watch them swing, the sun cresting through the leaves of the familiar oak.

The sun shines on Blake’s red hair, making it look like flames.

It’s mesmerizing.

Reese looks over his shoulder at me and smiles so wide, his brown eyes sparkling.

I smile back.

Blake looks over her shoulder at me and smiles, her brown eyes shine at me when they catch the sunlight.

And I stop pushing.

I look back and forth between the two of them, my heart racing.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

“Rosalie?”, I whisper as the swing comes to a stop.

Blake looks at me confused.

“Mommy, what’s wrong?”, Reese asks.

“Jackson.. Jackson!”, I scream.

He comes running out of the house with Emma and Taylor in tow.

“Claire? Claire! What’s wrong, what happened?”, he asks when he reaches us.

I point at Blake shakily.

“Check her shoulder..”,  I whisper.

“What?”, he asks.

“I’ve had this weird feeling all day. Check her shoulder.. for the birthmark..”, I whisper again.

Jackson’s face falls.

“Claire.. She isn’t Rosalie.. Rosalie died, remember?”, he says quietly.

“Did you get to see her? Hold her?”, I demand.

He’s quiet, because he knows he didn’t.

“You know they said we couldn’t.”, he reiterates.

“But I saw her, I saw her when they took her out during my C-section. She had a birthmark on the back of her right shoulder.”, Im screaming now.

Blake is looking at me with fear in her eyes.

Jackson is just staring at me.

“I think we should go.”, Emma says.

I turn to look at her, she avoids my gaze.

“Come on Blake, say bye to Reese.”, she says, her warm demeanor gone.

Reese starts to cry.

“Why are they going?”, he asks.

Emma takes Taylor and Blake’s hands and leads them through the house.

“Wait!”, I yell.

I run in after them.

“Stay away from us.”, Emma says coldly.

“Let me see her shoulder, if you have nothing to hide, then let me see!”, I yell.

Jackson and Reese are running in after us.

“Claire, stop!”, Jackson screams.

“You know what? Fine!”, Emma yells back.

She pushes Blake’s hair out of the way, and pulls open the neck of the shirt so I can see her right shoulder.

Nothing is there.

“No.. No I thought.. I was sure.. I just.. had a feeling since you got here..”, I stammer.

Jackson puts his face in his hands.

“You’re both crazy.”, Emma seethes.

Emma opens the door, and pushes Blake out first.

“Blakey doesn’t have the special spot.”, Taylor says quietly.

Emma stops.

“N-No, Taylor. Stop. Let’s go.”, she stammers.

“See??”, Taylor says, moving her tank top, “I have my special spot, Blakey doesn’t have one. Mommy says I can’t show it to anyone though, she said it’s secret.”, she says proudly.

I look at Taylor’s shoulder, and see the unmistakable birthmark.

In a misshapen heart.

My heart stops

Taylor’s small face is beaming at me, and that’s when I see she has the same grin as Reese.

His words from the first day he met her float in my head.

“Taylor is my favorite friend, we like all the same things..”

Oh my god.

I slowly look up at Emma.

She’s staring at me with pure panic in her eyes.

“You were my nurse at the hospital.”, I say quietly.

She is still frozen.

“You said she was.. You said.. She was dead…”, I whisper, feeling Jackson come up behind me.

“I’m calling the police.”, he says.

I stare at Emma.

“I’m sorry..”, she whispers, “It wasn’t personal, I would have done anything to become a mother.”

“Mommy?”, Taylor asks.

And me and Emma both turn to her.",4,1754461410.0,scarystories,0,0.84,False

“Yeah of course, I’ve got your back.. I know you’re stressed with getting the right snacks and making this play date perfect. But I want to ask one thing, if that’s okay…”, he says, crossing to me.

“Hmm?”, I ask, putting the pen down.

He looks at me seriously, and for a moment my heart drops.

“What, Jackson?”, I ask.

“Can you get peanut butter pretzels from Costco?”, he asks with the serious expression.

I playfully swat him away.

“Oh you’re terrible, go on!”, I laugh.

He walks up the stairs, laughing every step.

*

Saturday afternoon arrives, and I have cleaned my house twice.

I have scrubbed every surface, laid out a pleasing assortment of snacks. From fruit, and veggies with peanut butter, all the way to Goldfish and pizza bagels.

What? Kids like options.

When the doorbell rings, Jackson goes to get it.

I hear voices coming from the foyer, and Reese runs down the stairs just as they are crossing into the living room.

“You’re here!”, Reese yells.

The 3 kids bounce and shriek in unison for several seconds before calming down.

They are all similar in height, I see Taylor has blonde hair and Blake has red. They are all dressed in T-shirts and sneakers.

Emma appears behind them, hair in a messy bun, leggings and a sweatshirt on.

“Hi Claire, so good to meet you in person! I’m Emma, and blondie over there is mine, Taylor. And the redhead is Blake, my niece.”, she says, smiling at me.

I smooth my floral print dress self-consciously.

Oh god, I am way overdressed.

Jackson is in jeans and a t shirt, and I look like I’m going to church.

I can feel the panic attack starting to rise.

Emma is standing there, waiting for me to respond.

I run my hands over my dress again and look around sheepishly.

Jackson notices, and begins to walk over, when Emma speaks.

“Your dress is so pretty, I think I saw it online. Nordstrom, right?”, she asks.

“Oh, yes. Yes, that’s right. I’m so sorry, I’ve never.. Had anyone over like this. I wasn’t sure what to..”, I look down at my nude heels.

I wish the floor would open and swallow me up.

“Well you look STUNNING!”, she says, “Seriously, so beautiful. But if you aren’t comfortable, you can always change! Or don’t, I’m easy, don’t you worry about me. Though I may try to steal that dress from you if I stare at it any longer.”, she laughs, winking.

My shoulders relax, and I can see Jackson relax over her shoulder.

“You know what, I think I will change. Would you excuse me a moment?”, I ask.

She waves me off, and tells me she will handle getting the kids some snacks.

I walk upstairs, and Jackson follows me.

“Are you okay?”, he asks, his eyes searching my face.

“I am, she seems nice. I’m just a little anxious, I’m sure it’s just the kids being loud. It’s like the second they all came in, I felt nauseous, and I think I was just trying too hard.”, I respond, taking a baggy pair of jeans and t-shirt out of my closet.

“Okay, I’ll see you down there.”, he says, kissing my hand like he always does, before leaving the room.

I change quickly, and I’m looking in my mirror, trying to place my hair in a ponytail, when I hear a small voice.

“Hi.”

I jump.

Blake is standing at my bedroom door.

She really is a tomboy.

She has her long red hair tied up in two braids. She has a baggy Superman shirt on, with jeans and red converse.

“Oh hi Blake, I’ll be down in just a minute. Did you need something?”, I ask, giving up on my hair and putting a claw clip in it.

“Taylor is in the bathroom downstairs, so Reese said I can use the one up here, I don’t know where it is though.”, she tells me.

“Oh of course, sweetie. Let me show you.”, I get up and lead her to the hallway bathroom, because it’s more kid friendly.

“Thank you.. Mrs. Reese’s Mom.”, she says, shyly.

“You can call me Claire.”, I tell her.

She smiles.

“I’ll wait right out here for you, okay?”, I tell her.

She nods, and closes the door.

What a polite girl.

When she comes out, I tell her that her hair is beautiful.

“Thank you..”, she says shyly, blushing.

“Do your parents have the same hair?”, I ask.

She shakes her head.

“It’s just my mom, and she has brown hair.”, she tells me.

“You know what, my great-great-grandma Jolie had red hair I’m told, but none of her kids had it. That’s funny, right?”, I ask her.

She giggles.

“Yeah that’s funny!”, she says.

We’ve rejoined the party by now, and the kids have torn through the snacks.

Taylor and Reese are whispering to each other and giggling when we return.

Blake skips to rejoin them.

Emma looks up and smiles.

“Love the jeans!”, she winks.

And I smile at her.

After the kids eat, Reese asks if we can go outside.

Jackson excuses himself to take a work call, but says he will be in his office if we are getting overrun by the kids.

I pour Emma and myself a glass of lemonade, and we head out to sit on the chairs sitting on the back patio.

We just sit down when I hear Reese’s voice.

“And that’s where my sister lives!”, he says, pointing at the rose bush.

“Your sister lives outside?”, Blake asks, with her mouth wide open.

“Was she bad?”, Taylor asks.

“No! She lives in heaven! But this is just her spot.”, he explains.

Taylor and Blake seem to accept that answer, and start playing with the baseball set on the grass.

I know Emma heard Reese, but she’s being polite.

“Reese was a twin..”, I explain.

She turns to me, and says nothing.

“He had a sister, Rosalie. They were born prematurely, and she didn’t make it. So we planted the roses so she has a place here with us.”, I tell her.

“Oh Claire.. I’m so sorry. That’s just awful, I’m sorry you had to go through that.”, she says, reaching out her hand to hold mine for a moment.

“Thank you.. We have our good and bad days. Reese handles it well, as well as you can, I guess. He talks to her a lot though, I catch him out here talking to the roses..”, I choke on the last word.

“We don’t have to talk about it, if you don’t want to.”, Emma says, reassuringly.

I nod, and give her a sad smile.

We watch the kids play for a few minutes, and it seems so natural. 

Makes me wonder why I waited to long to encourage Reese to make friends.

I turn to Emma, to ask her about herself, when we hear a shriek.

Our heads both jerk to the noise, and Taylor is sitting on the ground, holding her foot.

“Mom!!”, Reese cries.

Emma and I stand up, and go to the kids.

Taylor is in tears, and can’t even form a sentence.

“What happened?”, I ask.

“Taylor was running, and she slipped on the grass.”, Blake explains.

“Is that right?”, Emma asks Taylor.

She nods between sobs.

Emma raises her pants leg, and looks at the leg.

“It’s not broken, but let’s put some ice on it just in case.”, she says, wiping her tears.

“Are you sure? I can watch Blake if you want to take her to urgent care.”, I tell her.

She shakes her head.

“Oh no, she will be okay. I’m actually an ER nurse. Blake’s mom too, she’s my sister.”, she explains, picking up Taylor.

“Well I know who I’m calling for any weird rash.”, I say, trying to make a joke.

Emma laughs.

“I got you! Do you guys have ice packs?”, she asks.

“Yes, in the freezer. Help yourself.”, I tell her as she disappears into the house.

I turn to see Reese and Blake and they look traumatized.

“Hey guys, Taylor will be okay. Just a boo boo. Let’s keep playing and he will join us when he’s ready.”, I say, patting both of them on the shoulder.

“Reese, why don’t you show her your swing?”, I suggest.

“Okay!”, he says, taking Blake’s hand and running to the oak tree.

I sit on the steps of the patio, and lean back on my elbows.

I see them taking turns pushing each other, giggling and shrieking with joy. 

“Mommy! Come push us!”, Reese yells.

I smile, and walk over to them.

“Okay, get close together..”, I warn.

They scoot right next to each other and put an arm around each other.

“Ready!”, they cheer.

I pull the swing back, and let it go.

They squeal as they go higher and higher.

I laugh with them.

I watch them swing, the sun cresting through the leaves of the familiar oak.

The sun shines on Blake’s red hair, making it look like flames.

It’s mesmerizing.

Reese looks over his shoulder at me and smiles so wide, his brown eyes sparkling.

I smile back.

Blake looks over her shoulder at me and smiles, her brown eyes shine at me when they catch the sunlight.

And I stop pushing.

I look back and forth between the two of them, my heart racing.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

“Rosalie?”, I whisper as the swing comes to a stop.

Blake looks at me confused.

“Mommy, what’s wrong?”, Reese asks.

“Jackson.. Jackson!”, I scream.

He comes running out of the house with Emma and Taylor in tow.

“Claire? Claire! What’s wrong, what happened?”, he asks when he reaches us.

I point at Blake shakily.

“Check her shoulder..”,  I whisper.

“What?”, he asks.

“I’ve had this weird feeling all day. Check her shoulder.. for the birthmark..”, I whisper again.

Jackson’s face falls.

“Claire.. She isn’t Rosalie.. Rosalie died, remember?”, he says quietly.

“Did you get to see her? Hold her?”, I demand.

He’s quiet, because he knows he didn’t.

“You know they said we couldn’t.”, he reiterates.

“But I saw her, I saw her when they took her out during my C-section. She had a birthmark on the back of her right shoulder.”, Im screaming now.

Blake is looking at me with fear in her eyes.

Jackson is just staring at me.

“I think we should go.”, Emma says.

I turn to look at her, she avoids my gaze.

“Come on Blake, say bye to Reese.”, she says, her warm demeanor gone.

Reese starts to cry.

“Why are they going?”, he asks.

Emma takes Taylor and Blake’s hands and leads them through the house.

“Wait!”, I yell.

I run in after them.

“Stay away from us.”, Emma says coldly.

“Let me see her shoulder, if you have nothing to hide, then let me see!”, I yell.

Jackson and Reese are running in after us.

“Claire, stop!”, Jackson screams.

“You know what? Fine!”, Emma yells back.

She pushes Blake’s hair out of the way, and pulls open the neck of the shirt so I can see her right shoulder.

Nothing is there.

“No.. No I thought.. I was sure.. I just.. had a feeling since you got here..”, I stammer.

Jackson puts his face in his hands.

“You’re both crazy.”, Emma seethes.

Emma opens the door, and pushes Blake out first.

“Blakey doesn’t have the special spot.”, Taylor says quietly.

Emma stops.

“N-No, Taylor. Stop. Let’s go.”, she stammers.

“See??”, Taylor says, moving her tank top, “I have my special spot, Blakey doesn’t have one. Mommy says I can’t show it to anyone though, she said it’s secret.”, she says proudly.

I look at Taylor’s shoulder, and see the unmistakable birthmark.

In a misshapen heart.

My heart stops

Taylor’s small face is beaming at me, and that’s when I see she has the same grin as Reese.

His words from the first day he met her float in my head.

“Taylor is my favorite friend, we like all the same things..”

Oh my god.

I slowly look up at Emma.

She’s staring at me with pure panic in her eyes.

“You were my nurse at the hospital.”, I say quietly.

She is still frozen.

“You said she was.. You said.. She was dead…”, I whisper, feeling Jackson come up behind me.

“I’m calling the police.”, he says.

I stare at Emma.

“I’m sorry..”, she whispers, “It wasn’t personal, I would have done anything to become a mother.”

“Mommy?”, Taylor asks.

And me and Emma both turn to her.",5,1754461378.0,nosleep,0,0.86,False
