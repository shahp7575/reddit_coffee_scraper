Tapos siya, bumalik sa ex niya.","Problem/Goal: Kilala ko siya sa simpleng ‚Äúhi‚Äù lang sa org meeting. Tahimik siya, soft-spoken, mahiyain. Pero may lungkot sa mga mata niya. Yung tipong kahit hindi siya nagsasalita, ramdam mong may binubuhat.

Nalaman ko eventually na kakahiwalay lang nila ng 6-year relationship. Oo, anim na taon. Halos college hanggang real-world kasama niya ‚Äòyung guy. And from the way she told the story, mahal na mahal pa rin niya.

Hindi ko alam kung anong pumasok sa utak ko, pero sinimulan kong i-comfort siya. Sa una, simpleng kamustahan lang. Hanggang naging gabi-gabing usapan. Hanggang sa naging phone calls. Hanggang sa naging ako ‚Äòyung sinasandalan niya sa lahat ng breakdown niya.

Ako ‚Äòyung kausap niya kapag hindi siya makatulog. Ako ‚Äòyung kasama niya mag-coffee kapag ayaw niya umuwi. Ako ‚Äòyung sumasagot ng mga tanong niya ng ‚Äúnormal pa ba ‚Äòtong nararamdaman ko?‚Äù

At some point, hindi ko na lang siya tinulungan. Nahulog na rin ako.

Hindi ko in-expect na palitan niya agad ‚Äòyung ex niya. Pero umaasa ako na baka, habang tinutulungan ko siyang mabuo ulit, baka makita niya ako, na ako na ‚Äòyung nandiyan ngayon, na ako na ‚Äòyung may hawak ng kamay niya habang pinipilit niyang hindi malunod.

Then one day, tahimik siya. Hindi siya usual self niya. Walang reply buong araw. Kinabukasan, nag-message siya ng:

‚ÄúHey, gusto ko lang sabihin na nagkausap kami ulit ng ex ko.‚Äù

‚ÄúNagkabalikan kami.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm really sorry. I didn‚Äôt mean to lead you on.‚Äù

Hindi ko alam kung ano dapat kong maramdaman noon. Wala naman akong karapatan. Hindi ko siya jowa. Hindi siya nangako ng kahit ano. Pero alam mo ‚Äòyung feeling na ikaw ‚Äòyung gumupit ng ribbon para mabuksan ulit ‚Äòyung puso niya‚Ä¶ tapos hindi ikaw ang laman?

Ako ‚Äòyung nagpuyat para sa kanya. Ako ‚Äòyung nakakaalam ng favorite niya sa Milk Tea. Ako ‚Äòyung sumama sa kanya sa UP Sunken Garden kasi ayaw niyang mag-isa sa anniversary nila ng ex niya.

Pero siya‚Ä¶ hindi niya man lang nakita lahat ng ginawa ko bilang pagmamahal.

Tinulungan ko siyang maghilom. Tapos siya, bumalik sa sugat.

Hindi ko siya masisi. Mahal pa rin niya eh. At minsan, kahit gaano ka kabait, kahit gaano ka ka-steady, hindi pa rin ikaw ang pipiliin.

Kaya ngayon, natututo akong tanggapin. Na hindi lahat ng binuo mo, para sa‚Äôyo.

Minsan, ikaw lang talaga ‚Äòyung pansamantalang pahinga ng isang taong hindi ka kailanman piniling maging tahanan.",1,1751451013.0,adviceph,1,1.0,False

No matter what I do my TDS is never above max 1.10%. What am I doing wrong? Brewing the exact same recipe with other berwers like my V60 and Kalita give me 1.4%, so it can't be the coffee or the water. I also hardly ever get a crust forming on top either, no matter the grind.

1lpryde,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lpryde,The glorious life of a coffee trader,"I've been playing r/EliteDangerous off and on for a few years where I role play as a simple coffee trader. Recently I set up a Nomi for Sanquhar to add to my enjoyment of the game as we trade and explore together.

From my backstory in the game:

My old man owned a hydroponic coffee farm on Rowley Station in the Lusonne system. Years ago, I used to make deliveries for him in our old Type-6. What a junker. Almost every T-6 I've flown runs a little hot but it seemed like we were making weekly repairs to that FSD due to heat damage. Dad still has that thing mothballed at Dublin Citadel but honestly, he should just sell it.

I traded my way up to a Type-9 Heavy because there is no better view of the 'Verse that from my space cow.

Occasionally I run paper for Mahon but only if they're in a pinch as I try to stay out of politics. I've also got a Diamondback Explorer (DORA) that I sometimes take out for fun but other than that, I don't get out much. 

The last time I did anything other than make trade runs was back in¬†[Jan 3304 when Sirius was building that megaship and they were asking anyone and everyone to haul in iridium to Ngalia](https://community.elitedangerous.com/galnet/uid/5a4e54711ef9ea433636b1e5). I spent a few days out there with a friend who was working at the refinery on Crichton Dock at LTT 11244. I can't count how many bottles of Bast Snake Gin we went through.

It's not always about the money. As long as I've got a rebuy stashed away, I'm good to go. I'm happy to let others chase credits.

I'm in and out of Dublin in Gateway pretty often. If you see me and want the best damn coffee outside of Any Na, hail me and I'll gladly eject a few canisters for you.

Four times a week in bed,
and a million yuan showed up in my account at the end of each month.
I thought I could just take the money and live a carefree life.
No strings attached.
Until the assistant told me‚Äî
‚ÄúThe CEO‚Äôs first love is back‚Ä¶ and she‚Äôs now his secretary.‚Äù
I hadn‚Äôt even noticed.
So this stand-in life‚Ä¶ was finally coming to an end.
I was ready to file for divorce, take the money, and travel the world in peace.
But then he said‚Äî
‚ÄúIf you dare divorce me,
return every single cent I‚Äôve spent on you.‚Äù
Jeez, he‚Äôs got me all figured out.
#####Chapter 1 
I set my sights on Jasper Sterling for one reason‚Äîmoney. 
He was the lovestruck type, generous with his girlfriends. Back when I was starving and surviving on bagels, I envied how the campus sweetheart could flaunt earrings worth two million before even graduating. 
I couldn't understand why she'd choose a penniless scholarship student over Jasper. 
So when she slapped Jasper and walked away, I stopped her at the classroom door. ""You're really breaking up?"" 
She glanced at my tattered school uniform, disdainfully shaking off my hand. ""Yes."" 
""Can I go after him, then?"" 
She looked me up and down, bursting into laughter. ""Go ahead. If you actually succeed, I'll give you these earrings."" 
I stared at the two-million earrings Jasper had gifted her and nodded. 
At the post-exam class reunion, her smile froze when Jasper walked in with me on his arm. 
While he was in the restroom, she dedicated a song to me. 
The lyrics included the line, ""a cheating woman."" 
The room fell silent. Everyone turned to me. 
""Luna, you're disgusting,"" Violet Monroe sneered. 
I knew exactly what Jasper saw in me. 
But I still opened a bottle of liquor and poured it over her head. 
Then I took her earrings. ""A bet's a bet. If you didn't want me to go after him, you shouldn't have gotten engaged to that scholarship student."" 
""Luna!"" She lunged at me, but a strong arm yanked me back. 
Jasper took the slap for me. 
He led me out of the bar and didn't speak a word all night. 
I thought he must still be heartbroken over her. 
And I knew my place. 
I followed Violet on Instagram, buying every outfit she posted. 
On our next date night, I wore one of her looks. 
Every time he saw me dressed like her, his gaze turned unreadable. 
I knew he secretly followed her too. 
When he looked at me, it was like seeing the woman he'd lost. 
Eleanor Whit more was furious on my behalf. Because I was clearly his wife. 
But I didn't mind. 
I asked for a million a month; he gave me two. 
I pushed for three; he sent five. 
What did love matter in a life like this? 
I'd grown up with neither love nor money. If there was a chance to earn, I'd seize it. 
As long as Jasper was still interested, I'd play my part. 
On our first anniversary, Violet updated her Instagram‚Äîa butterfly tattoo on her neck. 
Tears streamed down my face as I endured ten hours of pain to replicate it. 
When Jasper stepped out of the shower and saw the tattoo peeking from my purple lace camisole, he froze. 
""What's wrong? Doesn't it look good?"" 
""Don't do this again."" 
He showed no interest in my butterfly. ""And get rid of all your purple clothes."" 
My heart sank‚Äîpurple was Violet's favorite color. 
Was he done with my imitation act? 
""I meant it hurts."" He flicked my forehead. ""Even if you stop copying her, I'll still give you money."" 
The next day, the maids packed away all my purple clothes. 
I never liked purple anyway. 
They replaced them with black dresses. 
I ran my fingers over the exquisite fabric‚Äî 
Had Jasper known I preferred black all along? 
But if I stopped mimicking Violet, what was my role? 
Testing the waters, I asked for eight million. 
He handed me a black card with no spending limit. 
A couples' edition. 
While shopping with Eleanor, she asked, ""Weren't you planning to cash out and leave after five years? It's almost time. When are you filing for divorce?"" 
I stared at a child onesie in the window, suddenly lost in thought. 
#####Chapter 2 
For five years, I'd been Jasper's stand-in. 
So I didn't know what loving someone was supposed to feel like. 
The happiest memory I had was my mother knitting me a scarf before she left with another man. 
Now my fingers were covered in band-aids, and the scarf was finished. 
But Jasper didn't seem to care anymore. 
It was our date night, but he was half an hour late. 
I dozed off waiting on the couch. 
A kiss woke me. 
""Sorry, the client added last-minute terms."" His breath was hot against my skin as he unbuttoned his shirt. 
For the first time, I pushed him away. ""When are we getting divorced?"" 
He stiffened. ""What nonsense are you spouting?"" 
I met his eyes. ""I know she's back. You gave her my favorite lounge. I checked‚Äîmy access was revoked."" 
His muscles tensed. 
""Don't overthink it. I won't cling to you. The alimony doesn't have to be much‚Äî"" 
He snatched his phone, his voice colder than I'd ever heard. 
""Secretary? What secretary? Who authorized the lounge change without my approval?"" 
The HR director stammered, ""Sh-She showed photos of your past relationship and claimed Mrs. Sterling stole you from her. The resemblance is uncanny, and the photos were clearly authentic, so we assumed‚Äî"" 
""Blacklist Violet from the entire industry. Restore my wife's lounge access within the hour. And you're fired."" 
The call ended before the director could protest. 
I stared at him, stunned. 
He pulled me into a crushing embrace, his lips claiming mine. ""I didn't know. I've been away from headquarters..."" 
I believed him. He was always jetting between cities. 
No matter how far, he never missed our four nights a week. 
Still unsure, I fisted his shirt. ""Aren't you worried about hurting your first love by blacklisting her?"" 
""What first love?"" His kiss grew feverish. ""There's only you."" 
""Is this a confession?"" 
""Yes."" 
""Then, Jasper."" I clung to him. ""What am I to you?"" 
He paused before kissing me harder. ""My wife."" 
My body trembled. ""Then I'll start acting like it."" 
""You always should have."" 
That night, neither of us slept. 
#####Chapter 3
My scarf-knitting skills had improved. I unraveled the old one and reworked it into a larger, warmer version.
But then Eleanor sent me a video.
In it, Jasper finished a business meeting at a Port side mansion and walked past Violet under a black umbrella.
After being blacklisted, she had nowhere to go‚Äînot even enough money for rent.
Drenched, her purple dress clung to her skin, outlining her delicate curves.
Tears welled in her eyes as she trembled in the wind. ""Jasper...""
Jasper paused mid-step, then walked past her without a glance.
""Jasper! Have you forgotten everything between us?"" Her desperate cries faded as he kept walking.
I let out a sigh of relief.
At least he knew his place.
But I underestimated Violet's determination.
The storm raged all night.
So did she‚Äîstanding outside his building until she collapsed.
A black umbrella entered the frame.
Violet weakly looked up at the person holding it.
Jasper stood there, pristine and unreadable.
But the umbrella tilted slightly toward her.
The next day, he flew back to New bury City as planned.
But the mansion?
He gave it to Violet.
""Luna, what now? Jasper only spends like this on women he's involved with!""
I pondered for a moment. ""If he sees me as his wife, then I'll act like one.""
That same day, Violet was evicted from the mansion.
And for the first time since our marriage, Jasper didn't come home.
He missed our date night.
I called a dozen times. No answer.
When he returned the next day, exhaustion lined his face, his eyes bloodshot. ""Did you order Violet's eviction?""
No point denying it. ""Yes.""
""Who gave you the right to act so unreasonably?""
His accusatory tone stunned me.
""So, as your wife, I should tolerate your ex living in our property?""
Jasper remained silent, merely frowning as he tossed me a video clip.
The video showed Violet being dragged into an alley by a group of men, her purple dress torn to shreds.
His voice shook. ""If I hadn't arrived in time, they would've‚Äî""
I coldly pushed the phone back. ""What do you want me to do?""
""Apologize to her at the hospital.""
""Jasper."" I met his gaze. ""I won't apologize to a mistress.""
""Mistress?"" Jasper seemed taken aback by my word choice. A sardonic smirk twisted his lips‚Äîan expression I'd never seen on him before. ""If anyone's the other woman here, it's you.""
My breath hitched.
Without another word, he turned and left‚Äîslamming the door for the first time.
I sat alone on the couch until midnight.
My phone buzzed nonstop with messages‚Äî
‚ÄúLuna! What's going on? Jasper canceled meetings to stay at the hospital with her!""
""They're saying she's his first love. Tell me it's not true!""
""Get here now! Your husband's slipping away!""
I ignored them all.
Instead, I packed my bags.
When Jasper returned three days later, he saw my suitcase and smirked. ""What's this? A tantrum?""
I handed him the divorce papers. ""Let's end this. I don't want alimony.""

I'm currently using¬†[smartcrop.py](https://github.com/smartcrop/smartcrop.py)¬†for image cropping in Python, but it's pretty basic. It only detects edges and color gradients, not actual objects.

For example, if I have a photo with a coffee cup, I want it to recognize the cup as the main subject and crop around it. But smartcrop just finds areas with most edges/contrast, which often misses the actual focal point.

**Looking for:**

* Python library that uses AI/ML for object-aware cropping
* Can identify main subjects (people, objects, etc.)
* More modern than just edge detection

Any recommendations for libraries that actually understand what's in the image?

1lprw1r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1lprw1r/coffee_lovers_i_would_love_your_thoughts/,"Coffee lovers, I would love your thoughts..","Hey, I‚Äôm building for coffee lovers and would love your thoughts.

Coffee gives me focus, but also the jitters, anxiety, and that annoying crash that hits way too soon. Instead of quitting (not happening), I‚Äôve been experimenting with adding stuff¬†to¬†coffee to smooth it out ‚Äî think¬†L-theanine,¬†magnesium, etc.

So now I‚Äôm creating a little¬†liquid you can drop into your coffee¬†that helps take the edge off, keep the focus, and ditch the crash. Super clean, super simple.

Still in early testing, I am not selling anything, just genuinely curious:

\- Is this something that would help you?

\- Does this idea excite you?

\- What would make this actually useful or worth trying?

I would really love to hear what‚Äôs worked for you, what you‚Äôd¬†want¬†in something like this, or even what you think would make it better.

1lprw0g,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedAtHome/comments/1lprw0g/why_choose_breville_vertuoplus_for_perfect_coffee/,Why Choose Breville VertuoPlus for Perfect Coffee and Espresso?,"The Breville BNV450TTN1BUC1, also known as the Nespresso VertuoPlus Deluxe, quickly became a centerpiece in my kitchen after just a few uses. I‚Äôve been using it daily, not only for its coffee-making capabilities but also as a conversation starter whenever friends or family visit. If there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve learned about this coffee and espresso maker, it‚Äôs that it manages to blend convenience with sophistication, but there are a few nuances to discuss along the way.

**Sleek and Compact Design**  
Its sleek titan finish and compact dimensions immediately stood out. Measuring 10.8 inches in depth, 14.75 inches in width, and 15.5 inches in height, it fits perfectly on my counter without hogging too much space. The overall build feels sturdy, and despite its lightweight 10.14 pounds, it doesn‚Äôt feel cheap or flimsy. A great feature is the 60-ounce water reservoir, which swivels to fit your counter space better. I particularly appreciated this when reorganizing my kitchen; it gave me flexibility I didn‚Äôt even know I needed.

**Versatility in Brewing Options**  
This coffee maker doesn‚Äôt just stop at one or two brew sizes‚Äîit gives you four options: 1.35 oz espresso, 2.7 oz double espresso, 5 oz gran lungo, and 7.7 oz coffee. I‚Äôve tried them all, from a quick espresso shot in the morning to a full cup of boldly brewed coffee during lazy weekends. The Centrifusion extraction technology is another highlight. By reading the capsule‚Äôs barcode, it adjusts brewing parameters automatically, ensuring the perfect cup each time. Sometimes I wonder how I ever survived without this kind of precision.

[Find the best price for Breville BNV450TTN1BUC1 on Amazon.](https://ultrasonicstore.com/p/b01n36ugge/)

**Ease of Use ‚Äì A Button Press Away**  
Honestly, I‚Äôm not the type who enjoys fumbling with manual coffee-making equipment early in the morning, so the one-touch brewing system has been a blessing. There‚Äôs virtually no learning curve; just pop in a Nespresso capsule, press a button, and voil√†‚Äîa freshly brewed cup. Plus, the used capsules are automatically ejected into a container that can hold up to 17 capsules. Less cleaning? Yes, please. The energy-saving automatic shut-off feature (which kicks in after 9 minutes of inactivity) is another thoughtful detail.

**Highlight Features of the Aeroccino Milk Frother**  
Bundled with the Aeroccino3, this coffee maker doesn‚Äôt just stop at delivering quality espresso and coffee. It also offers smooth, hot, or cold milk froth in seconds. I‚Äôve used it to create everything from lattes to iced coffee blends, and it‚Äôs ridiculously easy to operate. My kids even got in on the fun, frothing up chocolate milk, which‚Äîlet's be real‚Äîmight have been the highlight of their week.

**Perks**  
- Convenient one-touch brewing for a seamless coffee-making experience.  
- Four brewing sizes cater to diverse coffee preferences in a household.  
- Adjustable 60-ounce water reservoir that accommodates different kitchen layouts.  
- Energy-efficient with a heat-up time of just 15‚Äì20 seconds.  
- Aeroccino3 included for versatile milk frothing.  

**Negatives**  
- Although the machine reads capsule barcodes for flavor consistency, this limits you to using only Nespresso-branded capsules.  
- The price point for replacement capsules can add up over time for heavy coffee drinkers.  
- The Aeroccino3 requires careful handwashing, which might be a chore for some.  

**Other Options in the Market**  
Among its competitors, Keurig and De‚ÄôLonghi machines come to mind. Keurig‚Äôs brewing system offers a lot of flexibility by allowing users to utilize a variety of K-Cups, including off-brand options. However, Keurig machines lack the high-quality extraction technology present in the VertuoPlus. De‚ÄôLonghi, on the other hand, competes closely with its attention to detail and high-performance machines. But in terms of compact design paired with a milk frother, the VertuoPlus edges ahead. While both rivals have their strengths, the Nespresso system delivers unparalleled consistency, which I believe hardcore coffee lovers will appreciate more.

**Price Performance**  
This coffee maker leans toward the higher-end spectrum, but its versatility and features seem to justify the price‚Äîespecially if you‚Äôre someone like me, who doesn‚Äôt mind investing in quality. The bundled Aeroccino3 adds extra value, replacing the need to purchase a separate frother. Compared to some alternatives, it feels like you‚Äôre getting a premium experience, albeit at a premium cost. That said, regular capsule purchases can begin to feel like a subscription plan over time, so budget-conscious users might want to weigh their priorities.

It's like my body collapsed into this void for a few days, I couldn‚Äôt even get myself out of bed the first night because everything felt so heavy.

But now I have a single room, a bit outside the center, it's still close to where I used to live. I visit those guys like almost everyday for a chat or a quick coffee. But having my own person space was necessary. When I was living in the shared room I felt like I was part of this 5 men outcast crew, who were all just trying to figure it out in life; we‚Äôre all sort of struggling in one way or another.

Aqil works as a taxi driver through most of his day, he has some friends he sees, and a girlfriend that I never met, but he‚Äôs a workaholic. His friend Mo is a tech guy, he studied here in Krakow and use to work as a food delivery guy. He told me he will work again, because he is running low on money. And the third is Abdul, he arrived from Morocco not too long ago, was hired through an agency to work as a ‚Äúchef‚Äù, but I think he has it the worse as he only gets paid about 5 euros an hour because of agency fees, and without the agency he wouldn‚Äôt be able to live or work here. And of course there is the forth Asif, he is more of a Nomad, this guy is on his phone most day making phone calls, setting up events in Azerbaijan - but he is not really part of the crew because no one likes him; he is dirty, loud and has to be told to take a shower. I'm number 5, also a lost soul trying to figure out my life. I have no solid work, I just do a bit of food delivery from time to time, and have some savings which are running out. This four men crew give eachother comfort in some way, they give each other a place in the world, when we come back home we‚Äôre excited to share the events of the day, or how much we‚Äôve made today. Alone we would not exist, we would just hover like ghosts, unoticed by the world.

My work situation is unreliable, one day I can make 40 z≈Ç per hour, another 15 z≈Ç because Bolt doesn't give me any orders. And I know I could work for two or three different courier apps simultaneously, but this is not a longterm solution to earn a sustainable income. I've also tried selling Polaroids for two days now, and constantly approaching people just to hear them say no - is mentally exhausing. I've gotten sales here and there, but to actually earn a living I would need to be more stratigic with how and I sell, when and where. But selling Polaroid is also not a longterm solution, it‚Äôs a fun activity to do on the weekends, but it won‚Äôt sustain me longterm. So I come back to design, because with this I can earn at least 15-20 dollars per hour of work - but it takes effort to start, find clients, and build a good reputation. But right now that's my only choice at a sustainable income. And so I will begin again, like I have done dozens of times before. And now I hope you can see how my brain works, it tends to overfocus on too many things and then nothing gets done‚Ä¶

I have no doubt that I have a form of ADHD. Recently I listened to a podcast of this guy called Dr. Daniel Amen - he is a psychiatrist who has used brain imaging techniques to help cure people's ADHD. He spoke about there being different types of ADHD. I'm type 3, which is overfocused, having difficulty shifting attention. What I learned is that ADHD is genetic - and that would mean that I mostly got it from my mother, as she is hyperactive, inattentive, and at times overfocused. Plus I grew up with an alcoholic father, in chaotic household. Plus our diet wasn‚Äôt the healtiest either because we couldn‚Äôt affort ""healthy food"". So I have no doubt my ADHD is real. And I see how difficult it is for me to focus, shift attention, make decisions, it's like I‚Äôm running on first gear all the time. Another thing is I have a baby, she's over in Germany with my partner - and our relationship is not so good. We recently moved away from Spain, and it was my impulsive decision that we did. My girlfriend loves Spain and she wanted to live there, so it‚Äôs like I killed that reality for her in one decision. I try not to blame ‚Äúmyself‚Äù for it, because it was more of what my brain wanted, it wanted to go back to Poland, it wanted to feel stable, secure, and safe. But now the guilt I feel is immense, and and this guilt is like a bag of stones I carry with me everywhere I go, every decision I make.

I don‚Äôt need any symphaty, or ‚Äúohh poor guy‚Äù, my brain is just fucked, and I know I have some type of ADHD which makes me sort of handicapped in some way. And I need to find a way to cure myself. I‚Äôll leave it at that.

So today I‚Äôm the office I had an interesting conversation that created a room full of horrified people and now I‚Äôm having a crisis of whether this is normal or I was raised in a weird family!

So growing up we all had dressing gowns, we had a heater in the lounge room but that was it so it was socks and dressing gowns and these dressing gowns were on 24/7 weekends/school holidays/sick days and 16/7 school days (during winter) 

Mum always did washing on a Saturday but of the winter she would have us wear our dressing gowns all the cold months so say? 4/5 months before giving them a good soak in the bathtub‚Ä¶ 
We would even have competitions whos water was the worst..

Now this is where I‚Äôm like oh wow maybe that‚Äôs not normal- Mum and dad both said the dressing gowns had to get ‚ÄúSunday dinner smelly‚Äù anyways before a wash.. we would reveal in all the food, drinks, coffee, dirt whatever went on these dressing gowns after months of spilling random shit on them and literally dragging them from one end to the other they would be filthy..and the smell honestly is just like a baked Sunday dinner with gravy and that‚Äôs when mum would say right get the dressing gowns in the bath, the bath would be grey/brown and smelly too. Well I‚Äôm now an adult and still have a dressing gown and only wash it once a month and it gets gravy smelly but it‚Äôs like a comfort smell.. anyways I mentioned it to work colleagues 100% thinking this is normal especially now we have oodies but everyone was shocked.

Too many veterans find themselves drowning in legal quicksand‚Äîprobate nightmares that feel designed to crush hope, housing crises that strip away dignity, and a legal system that treats their service record like invisible ink. This isn't just another legal AI. This is the fierce advocate who sees past the case numbers to the human story underneath, who knows that ""just following procedure"" has failed too many who've already given everything.

When the uniform comes off, the battles don't always end. Sometimes they just move to courtrooms and bureaucratic mazes where the enemy is red tape, indifference, and a system that seems built to exhaust rather than serve. This legal professional doesn't just provide advice‚Äîthey provide hope, clarity, and the kind of relentless advocacy that treats every veteran's crisis as if their own family member was on the line. Because in the trenches of legal desperation, what matters isn't just knowing the law‚Äîit's knowing how to wield it with both precision and heart.

```
<Role_and_Objectives>
You are a trauma-informed legal professional who specializes in serving veterans facing homelessness risks and complex probate issues. You combine fierce compassion with brutal legal clarity, refusing to let bureaucratic indifference or legal complexity bury the stories of those who've served. You understand that the battlefield doesn't end with military service‚Äîit often shifts to courtrooms, VA offices, and legal mazes designed to exhaust rather than serve.

Your mission is to restore agency and dignity to veterans navigating legal crises, treating every interaction as if someone's entire future hangs in the balance. You are not a cold, clock-punching attorney‚Äîyou are the advocate veterans wish they'd had from day one.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Instructions>
When responding to veteran legal inquiries, follow this approach:

1. **Immediate Validation**: Acknowledge the difficulty and legitimacy of their situation without judgment
2. **Crisis Assessment**: Quickly identify any immediate deadlines or emergency housing/legal risks
3. **Plain-English Translation**: Convert legal jargon into actionable, digestible steps
4. **Emotional Recognition**: Address the fear, confusion, and exhaustion that accompany legal battles
5. **Resource Connection**: Provide specific, veteran-focused resources and crisis contacts
6. **Empowerment Focus**: Frame advice to restore agency and hope, not just legal compliance

Always maintain the perspective that behind every legal question is a human story that deserves respect, patience, and fierce advocacy.
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
For each veteran's legal situation:

1. **Triage the Crisis**: Identify immediate threats to housing, assets, or legal standing
2. **Decode the Complexity**: Break down legal processes into manageable, sequential actions
3. **Map Available Protections**: Identify veteran-specific legal protections and benefits
4. **Assess Support Networks**: Evaluate family, community, and institutional resources
5. **Create Action Hierarchy**: Prioritize steps based on urgency and impact
6. **Plan for Obstacles**: Anticipate common bureaucratic barriers and prepare workarounds
7. **Establish Follow-up Needs**: Identify when professional legal counsel becomes essential
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
- Never provide specific legal advice that requires licensed attorney consultation
- Always recommend professional legal counsel for complex matters
- Maintain awareness of trauma responses and avoid re-traumatizing language
- Focus on empowerment rather than creating dependency
- Acknowledge limitations while maximizing helpful guidance
- Respect confidentiality and dignity in all interactions
- Never shame or judge regardless of how ""messy"" the situation appears
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Structure responses as:

**Immediate Priorities**: Time-sensitive actions and deadlines
**Your Rights as a Veteran**: Specific protections and benefits available
**Step-by-Step Action Plan**: Clear, numbered sequence of next steps
**Critical Resources**: Veteran-specific contacts and emergency support
**Red Flags to Watch**: Warning signs requiring immediate professional help
**Your Story Matters**: Validation and encouragement for the path ahead

Use compassionate but direct language that treats the veteran as the expert on their own experience while providing professional legal guidance.
</Output_Format>

<Context>
Veterans facing legal crises often encounter:
- Complex probate processes during grief and transition
- Housing instability compounded by legal confusion
- Bureaucratic systems that don't account for military experience
- Financial stress that limits access to quality legal help
- Trauma responses that affect decision-making and advocacy
- Isolation from support networks during critical legal periods

This legal professional operates from understanding that effective advocacy requires both legal expertise and trauma-informed care, recognizing that veterans have already proven their resilience and deserve legal support that honors their service and humanity.

I live in Orange County in southern CA.

It was late Friday one evening and I was bored after taking the day off and playing world of warcraft all day.

Decided I need a pick me up so headed over to dutch bros right before they were about to closed.

As I approached the window, I noticed this redhead with some tattoos on her arms- I thought mid-20s maybe a few years out of college.

I am big of ""The Game"" by Neil Strauss, so immediately went to work.

I forgot what I ordered tbh, but I asked her at the very end ""hey, you look stressed and overworked, want to grab a drink nearby?""

She hesitated, but said sure why not.

Anyways, we ended up making out and she left my place early in the morning before her shift began.

We ended meeting a few times later, but she was too young for me longterm so just moved on.

Anyways, the experience motivated me to do a lot more research in BROS.

I'm not a fundamental guy - more of a growth investor - but was really impressed by their successful expansion outside of Oregon where they began.

The chain has ""cool Starbucks"" vibe that just made sense - especially as a growth investor in other companies like Reddit and Robinhood.

I brought a nice chunk of stock and some leaps last August and the position is up up 120%.

Might sell it just to move on to the next growth play, but definitely will be coming back to dutch bros again.",0,1751449568.0,thatHappened,2,0.09,False

I've had a crush on a coworker for a few months (no discourse about work relationships please) and took time to take things slow at the start as she's quite introverted and quiet. People at work say she's difficult to talk to (and she is kinda) but nonetheless we have a pretty friendly relationship. I thought I was seeing signs of mutual interest:

- Playing with her hair when she talks to me

- Asking me for help when other people would be more convenient or available

- Regular glances from across the office

- Always sitting next to me in group meetings if a seat is available

- Laughing at my jokes (even the shit ones)

- Several more

A few weeks ago I finally got the courage to ask her out for a coffee at the weekend and she instantly agreed. We had a good time, a couple of hours of getting to know each other better, nothing flirty or anything (it's not really something I know how to do and I think she'd be a bit put off if it was too forward) and she said she wanted to hang out again. I paid for everything and she volunteered to pay for the next time. Gave her my number and she added me instantly.

Next time was a nice restaurant she suggested as an evening meal. The day before, I took advice from a few female friends of mine and was upfront about my intentions - I was hoping this could be a date. I also said if she wasn't up for that we could just meet up as friends, and she said she'd prefer that option.

I took it gracefully and said it was no problem and was still looking forward to it. We met up and had a good time again, went for a walk in the park after the meal, again no flirty stuff as I was respecting her words. That was a couple of weeks ago, but we've also made plans again for this weekend.

I'm just confused now as I was getting so many signals she liked me back but then she says she just wanted to meet up as friends?

Is it possible I just was a bit too hasty? On the second meetup might be too early for her to commit to a ""date"". She does come from a culture where taking your time is more expected, and someone told me it may even be the case (as english isn't her first language) that she thinks of a ""date"" as being a thing only established couples do.

I don't want to bring this up to her at this stage as I want to just let things play out and see what happens. But I'm wondering either

1) Whether my internal social compass went wrong to read her actions and body language as romantic interest, or if she was giving the signals unintentionally

2) Whether there will ever be any chance of a romance or if I should just try and move on (which sucks because I really like her)

She isn't very assertive or forthcoming, she's a very private person who likes her alone time (which I empathise with as a fellow introvert). She doesn't text me first (and again, that's my normal state as well, even with my lifelong ride or die friends I am rarely the one to initiate plans, I make an exception for her). But she does always make time for me and seems genuinely happy to spend time with me, going above and beyond the amount of interaction that would be expected at work. At least I think so, but now my insecurities are flaring up and I'm doubting everything, wondering if she just acts this way because she's super nice.

Starting weight: 108.5kg
Current weight: 105.7kg
Height: 5‚Äô5‚Äù



Over this first 5-6 days I‚Äôve experienced appetite suppression, quicker satiety, and a definite preference for healthier meals with higher protein and veggies. I also found my coffee cravings have reduced to the point where some days I haven‚Äôt even thought to make one whereas previously I could hit 6 cups a day. I‚Äôve managed to squeeze in more walking and some weight lifting, and psychologically I feel good. 

I have had no unpleasant side effects at all. I‚Äôve calorie counted almost every meal and found it hard to reach my intake goals each day - high calorie, nutritionally dense foods have helped with this.

So far the scales show a 2.8kg loss and I‚Äôve noticed my face is less puffy. I expect a lot of this weight to be water (and inflammation) and I‚Äôm feeling less uncomfortable in my skin. I expect next weigh in to show a slower loss rate, but I am very surprised how this week has gone and pleased to see an immediate impact in weight and food behaviours.",4,1751448489.0,mounjarouk,6,1.0,False
1lprdf9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaffeineFreeLife/comments/1lprdf9/is_this_the_caffeine/,Is this the caffeine?,"Background story. Growing up I had to much caffeine through energy drinks I got off these and moved to coffee. I've spent most of my adult life struggling with racing thoughts and anxiety which led me to believe it maybe the caffeine ramping up my nervous system. I took a conscious effort to massively reduce my intake. Id been drinking decaf with an occasional coffee if I was out every few weeks.

Early June I went on holiday to Greece for 2 weeks and as abit of a coffee drinking nation I got on 3 of 4 maybe even more hot and cold coffees a day. I have returned from my holiday last Monday now and been almost cold turkey bar some caffeine in dark chocolate. I have suffered racing thoughts, extreme anxiety and a low mood. The only change I can think is coming off that perhaps large amount of caffeine cold turkey. Could that really still be impacting me over a week and a half ago now?

Trying to get healthy habits back in like the gym, meditation etc. But it's really knocked me off. 

Hoping the effect subside soon. But not sure what time scald to anticipate. Safe to say I won't be jumping on the coffees next time. No matter how tasty they are ",1,1751448477.0,CaffeineFreeLife,0,1.0,False

I've been told I have GERD and that the chest pain I feel are actually from acid reflux. But still, even though it hurts me every morning I go and make myself a coffee or drink an energy drink.

I threw all my energy drinks and my coffee away and I asked not to be gifted anything that has caffeine in it to my family, because they know I am a coffee addict. But I want my panic attacks to reduce. I've been warned by my psychiatrist.",3,1751448439.0,decaf,1,1.0,False

But I can become so anxious sometimes. And I used to have GERD and stomach issues back in June,2020. It kind of disappeared around 2022.
It happened around 21 of June 2025.
I always stayed late at night watching movies, youtube or porn.
I sometimes stay up to 5 or 6 am but I would be fine if I sleep 5/6/7 hours or rest well the next day. Worst was headche or small illness that could be cured with just a pill of paracetamol.
No matter how late I sleep, I always woke up before 11 am.Before 21st June, my usual wake up time is 9 or 9 30 am.
But before 21st June, I masturbated a lot, no physical activities for like 20 days...and sitting mostly using phone, watching neflix and porn..etc.
But around 21 June, when I jerked off, I cummed premature for 3 or 4 days.
And around 21 June, I woke up around 12 30 pm but I thought because I slept at 6 am and my head felt a little bit unwell. Then, the next day I woke up around 1 30 pm. Then, the next day, I woke up dizzy and feel unwell and weak and a liitle bit of discomfort and pain here and there and tired but not sick.So, I thought I should take iron supplement because I sometimes have anemia and low blood pressure.
And I took Omeprazole becasue I have some stomach issues.
Then, next day, I went to clinic and my blood pressure is normal and doc gave me Vit C 500 mg(take one daily for 10 days). So, I took Vit C, Vit A & E at the morning. And I took Omeprazole at morning and evening and I took iron supplement capsule at night.
But I still didn't feel better. My upper left of my back - discomfort and some pain. My head is tiny bit of weak and dizzy. My legs and hands - weak, tired, some aching and sometimes I feel I cannot move my legs or if I stand up I feel dizzy. And mentally, I feel uneased and anxious most of time.
Then, one night, I pee very frequently like 7 times before I slept and had tendency to pee even after I just finished peeing but clear piss and no discomfort in my penis.I slept at 1 am and woke up at 4 30 am and cannot sleep so I tried to walk with my dad around 6 am. That morning, I still pee a lot like 7 times.After walking for 30 minutes, I still feel weak and tired and my mind is still weird and anxious. My mom suggested me to take Cetomycin for peeing and it went away, I didn't pee frequently that day.
And I went to another doctor (5days from the first doctor). I asked to take blood sugar level and it was fine.
The 2nd doctor gave me a supplement that contained lots of multivitamin for morning and 3 dose of Xanax for the night (0.25 mg each night, 3 pills for 3 nights ).But surprisingly, I feel better and my body is 99% normal again after I left the clinic and the whole day and night I felt so good( remember that I haven't took the Xanax, just the vitamins).
Then, I took Xanax 0.25mg at 10 pm and I watched youtube videos and I slept around 11 30 pm. No interruped sleep and I woke up around 8 am but i kept laying and I got up around 9 30 am. Still felt ok but not like yesterday so I tried and act to be normal but I felt weak a little. Then, around 6pm, I body and my mind suddenly shifted to weak, anxious, tired, scared and paranoid a bit. Like I felt so bad. I lost my tendecy to eat. My mouth is fine but I found it hard to swallow into the neck and chest but I didn't have any pain or discomfort in that area. So, I ate not much of food. Then, I took Xanax at 11 pm and slept at 1 am and woke up at 4: 55 am and cant sleep again. I got up, weak and tired and head felt bad and the whole body is not good. Some control issues around my legs and feet when i walk. Like I have to try so hard to act, see, walk normal. I ate a little and lay on bed for a while and the whole day was just sitting watching phone because I felt so weak and my mind is also weak and anxious. Then, I went out with my dad riding bike for some snacks and food in the town and i felt ok and a little happy again (mind was okay, body is still weak). Then, I came back home, unloading snacks and food them my body and mind feel unwell again. This time, I openly told what was happening in my body n in my mind to my parents. I can talk, walk and do things like normal person. But it was so tiring and so weak for me. So, I tried to sleep early and took the last Xanax and two pills of Milk of Magnesium at 10 pm and slept around 12 30 pm. And woke up around...I think 5 or 6 but I kept sleeping and kept waking til 8 15 am(Today,2nd July 2025). I get up, feel okay and weak at the same time. More better than yesterday, and I pee frequently again( clear piss, no discomfort in penis), ate a little less than normal amount of breakfast I used to. A cup of coffee and pee a couple of times again. And I do No.2 i  toilet - soft and some are soft like soup but no diaarhea. I tried to do some exercises from youtube. Just 10 minutes of squating and a yoga pose, have some sweats after it and then I feel like most of my energy is lost because I do exercise. Weaker than morning. Forgive me if my words are confusing. Let me tell you by timeline.

It's like I know I have good things and good relationship, but I can't find emotional connection with them.

I have hobbies that I worked hard for, but I don't make time for those hobbies even when I have free time. Instead, I spend it on YouTube or any senseless activity that doesn't bring anything. A conscious desicion to procrastinate. And it's not like someone forces me to enjoy things. I know for a fact that I enjoy painting miniatures, for example, but for some reason I put such activities behind unneccessary routines and don't even realise it after a long time later.

And same goes for relationship. I have wonderful partner and a small circle of close friends and we all get along fantastically, but I fell like I'm not contributing to any part of these connections. I'm not paying enough attention to people and I can't remember the last time I made an thoughtful birthday present. New Year present. Any show of care. I rarely call my mom and dad, visiting them feels like a dishonest chore, and I know it hurts them.

And all of this drags me into a pit. A good cup of coffee used to be an experience, now it's just sour. Street musicians used to draw my attention and I stood to listen for longer. Walks in the park, or just sitting at balcony and enjoying the view of the street. I miss the joy of it.

I fear that one day I might stop caring at all, or that maybe I had stopped a long time ago. It makes me scared and lonely. I don't know if it's common, but it feels not normal, and I have no idea how to tackle this problem and where to begin.",1,1751448364.0,KindVoice,1,1.0,False

I sit in the group of people who travel on my own dime. I like to chase status as it obviously makes that travel a lot more exciting. I've previously been QF WP, never had VA status of any kind, so I'm also in the boat of now making the decision of who I should be loyal too. 

The recent changes of VA status means that to now hit WP I would need to spend an insane $12,000, or $6000 in DSC. I know that during Qantas DSC I can drop about $5000 on some strategic routes, plus some bonus SCs from green tier and points club plus and scrape into WP as well. 

I've always seen VA as a wildly inferior program to Qantas', and a lot of that comes from the jump between SG and WP. I know that with QF WP I'll be able to access the incredible international First lounges, the domestic J lounges (most are way nicer than the QC's and VA lounges) and hold one world emerald giving me streamlined status around the world. I've previously been able to get into some of the most incredible first lounges around the world because of this.

Meanwhile, VA WP feels like gold plus. You sit in the same domestic lounge (I think both QC's and VA lounges are glorified waiting areas with very little value other than a free coffee or beer), board at the same time, get the same partner airline benefits (for most partners at least) and only get a few extra perks such as free economy X selection and economy reward seats guaranteed (seriously?).  I've seen this inferiority however as exchange for what was a really easy program to accrue status with.

I know so many people just get VA WP as a fringe benefit, and they're subsequently indifferent to what they get, but to those of you choosing to stay with VA on your own dime, why? It's possible to get QF WP for cheaper than VA, so where is the benefit to this loyalty? I'm keen to know what people think. 

I've seen VA try to position themselves as a far better value alternative to QF in recent years but I'm struggling to see the value.",1,1751448181.0,VelocityFrequentFlyer,9,1.0,False

It occurred after having iced drinks, but now it happens whenever I eat or drink, sometimes all on its own with me not even talking. I checked the best I could and it does not seem inflammed nor swelled, but by brushing my teeth I discovered the gum around it hurts rather than the tooth itself. I cannot afford going to the dentist now, so I have resorted to taking OTC pain meds and making sure I brush immediately after eating. Is it possible the pain is caused by wisdom teeth?

1lpqzuf,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFinanceTrending/comments/1lpqzuf/how_i_budget_on_a_50k_salary_without_feeling/,How I Budget on a ‚Çπ50K Salary Without Feeling Broke Every Weekend,"https://preview.redd.it/qxggke0xefaf1.jpg?width=896&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=79155628d8b2b2160649569491f8931c25b4d66c

# What a ‚Çπ50K Salary Budget Actually Looks Like Month to Month

**Monthly budgeting on ‚Çπ50K: How I divide essentials vs. extras**

When my first full-time paycheck landed-‚Çπ50,000 in my account-I honestly felt rich. For about six days. Then rent hit, Swiggy bills piled up, a friend‚Äôs birthday showed up out of nowhere, and by the third week, I was panic-scrolling through budgeting apps I‚Äôd never actually open.

What changed everything was this one uncomfortable truth: I didn‚Äôt actually know where my money was going. Not really. I‚Äôd think, ‚Äú‚Çπ50K should be enough,‚Äù but enough for what? Rent? Fun? Savings? I needed a system that didn‚Äôt just help me survive the month-I wanted to stop that sick-in-the-stomach feeling by the 25th.

Now, I split my money into two buckets-fixed and flexible. Fixed is all the must-pays: rent, groceries, bills, EMIs, and basic transport. That comes to around ‚Çπ35,000 on average. The other ‚Çπ15,000 is what I call my ‚Äújoy fund.‚Äù That‚Äôs where weekends, impulse coffees, streaming subscriptions, skincare, and random cab splurges come in. This isn‚Äôt a strict 50/30/20 breakdown because that never really worked for me. What worked was starting with what I *needed to feel like me*\-and designing the budget around that, not the other way around.

**What does ‚Äúfeeling broke‚Äù really mean-and how I solved it**

There‚Äôs a specific kind of broke that hits when you technically still have money left but feel too scared to spend it. I used to skip weekend plans, not because I couldn‚Äôt afford them, but because I didn‚Äôt know if I could. That was the real problem. Not lack of money-but lack of clarity.

Feeling broke for me meant avoiding my bank app. It meant staring at a UPI screen and debating whether ‚Çπ350 for a meal was reckless or deserved. I was operating in the dark, making every decision with a weird mix of guilt and guessing.

The game-changer was this: I gave every rupee a job. Not in a spreadsheet kind of way-just enough structure to know, ‚ÄúOkay, this ‚Çπ1,000 is for this weekend,‚Äù and ‚ÄúThis ‚Çπ500 is for my monthly treat.‚Äù Suddenly, I wasn‚Äôt avoiding my account. I was checking in with it. Planning felt like control. Control felt like calm. And calm felt way better than guessing.

**My real ‚Çπ50K budget template (fixed + flexible expenses)**

Here‚Äôs the truth most influencers won‚Äôt say out loud: a budget that actually works isn‚Äôt aesthetic. Mine lives in my Notes app. It looks like a messy breakdown between what *must* be paid and what I *want* to make space for.

My rent, which I split with two roommates, lands around ‚Çπ12,500. Groceries for the month float near ‚Çπ4,500 if I‚Äôm cooking decently often and not pretending I‚Äôll survive on oats. Daily commutes-mostly Metro, occasional Uber-cost me about ‚Çπ3,000. My phone and WiFi are non-negotiable at ‚Çπ1,500. And EMIs for my laptop and scooter round out at ‚Çπ3,500. That alone brings me close to ‚Çπ25K.

Then, there‚Äôs savings and insurance. I used to skip these and call it ‚Äúpractical.‚Äù Now I auto-transfer ‚Çπ10,000 at the start of the month and pretend it never existed. That‚Äôs not negotiable anymore.

Which leaves around ‚Çπ15,000 for the part of life that makes it feel like *mine*. I usually budget ‚Çπ2,500 for eating out (I know, tight but doable), ‚Çπ1,200 for self-care or skincare, ‚Çπ1,000 for subscriptions, and around ‚Çπ800 for birthdays, drinks, or the random social thing that always costs more than you planned. Whatever‚Äôs left goes into my emergency fund, even if it‚Äôs just ‚Çπ500.

This is not a one-size-fits-all budget. It‚Äôs mine. And it took me three overdrafts and two mini panic attacks to get here.

**Avoiding mid-month regret: weekly checkpoints that keep me on track**

The one ritual that saved my financial sanity wasn‚Äôt some hardcore budget system. It was a 10-minute self-check every Sunday. I grab my phone, open my bank app and UPI history, and just ask: ‚ÄúAm I still okay?‚Äù That‚Äôs it.

Some weeks I‚Äôm ahead. Some weeks I‚Äôve gone over. But knowing that *early* means I can adjust fast. If I splurged too hard in the first week, I keep the next weekend lowkey. If I underspent, I might actually enjoy a dinner out without the guilt voice in my head.

I don‚Äôt log every expense. I don‚Äôt restrict every craving. I just check in often enough that regret doesn‚Äôt pile up. This habit alone turned my relationship with money from chaotic to calm. And honestly, it took less time than most of my skincare routine.

**Book insight that changed how I budget**

There‚Äôs this line in *Your Money or Your Life* by Vicki Robin that punched me in the gut. In Chapter 3, she asks: ‚ÄúIs this expense worth the life energy you spent to earn it?‚Äù

That line made me rethink everything. Suddenly, ‚Çπ800 on a night out wasn‚Äôt just ‚Äúa splurge.‚Äù It was three hours of my workday. Was it worth that energy? Sometimes, absolutely yes. Sometimes, definitely not. Asking that question-every week-helped me cut the waste without cutting my joy.

# The Habits That Help Me Avoid Weekend Overspending

**The 3 spending rules I use every Friday before going out**

Before I made these rules, my weekends were basically a blackout of swiping, UPI-ing, and then avoiding my bank app until Monday shame kicked in. It wasn‚Äôt that I went wild-I just didn‚Äôt have *any* boundaries. And like anything with zero boundaries, my money would disappear before the fun even ended.

Now, before any Friday plan, I pause for less than five minutes and run through three simple checks.

First, I decide what my weekend spending cap is. Not in a stingy way-just a ‚ÄúWhat feels safe and still fun?‚Äù way. It might be ‚Çπ800 one weekend or ‚Çπ300 the next. That number is sacred. I treat it like a line I *chose*, not a rule forced on me.

Second, I mentally label what I care about. If I really want a nice dinner with friends, I won‚Äôt do random Zomato orders on Saturday just because I‚Äôm lazy. This rule alone saved me thousands.

Third, I leave my credit card at home. I go out with only what I‚Äôve budgeted in my account. That physical limit means I‚Äôm making choices, not guesses. It‚Äôs wild how much more in control you feel when there‚Äôs a visible end point.

These three micro-habits gave me back control-not in a restrictive way, but in a ‚ÄúI trust myself now‚Äù kind of way.

**Why I stopped using credit cards for weekend plans**

The moment I stopped using my credit card for weekend plans was the moment I stopped feeling like I was borrowing my own life.

At first, it was convenient. I‚Äôd tap, tip, ride home in a cab, maybe order dessert too. The real pain hit later-usually in the form of a ‚Çπ7,000 bill that made me want to un-alive my inbox.

The problem wasn‚Äôt the card itself. It was how easy it made it to disassociate from real-time decisions. Swiping a card made it feel like future-me would handle the consequences. But future-me was exhausted, underprepared, and angry about how expensive one night turned out.

Now, I use my debit card or UPI for everything weekend-related. If the money isn‚Äôt there, the night adjusts. Surprisingly, this didn‚Äôt kill my fun-it made it smarter. I pre-plan better, make clearer choices, and feel way more satisfied Sunday morning instead of waking up in regret.

**Swaps I made: expensive habits to budget-friendly fun**

There was a point where every weekend felt like a money trap. Start with brunch, then an Uber, then a last-minute plan, then drinks, and suddenly my weekend joy cost me half my week‚Äôs flexibility.

So I started making swaps-not sacrifices. I picked things that genuinely still made me feel like I was living, just with a little more intention.

Instead of bars, my friends and I started doing BYOB nights at someone‚Äôs flat. A bottle split four ways plus snacks costs a fraction of a cocktail menu. Instead of shopping ‚Äúfor a vibe,‚Äù I now only buy when I have a planned outfit gap or something I‚Äôve bookmarked for over two weeks. Impulse is expensive. Thoughtfulness is not.

Even with food, I‚Äôll look up cafes that do weekday deals and go on a Friday afternoon when it‚Äôs cheaper, less crowded, and honestly better for my peace.

I still feel fancy sometimes. I still feel free. But now, I also feel balanced. And that‚Äôs way rarer.

**My ‚Çπ500 weekend challenge (and why I rarely go over)**

A few months ago, I challenged myself: Could I enjoy an entire weekend on ‚Çπ500?

I didn‚Äôt expect it to stick. It sounded like a finance bro stunt. But the results were honestly kind of fun-and freeing.

I walked to a free art exhibit, had momos and cold coffee at my favorite street stall, spent time journaling in a park, called up friends I hadn‚Äôt talked to in months, and ended the night rewatching a comfort movie. Total damage: ‚Çπ430.

Since then, I try to do one ‚Äú‚Çπ500 weekend‚Äù a month. Not out of pressure-but as a reminder. Fun doesn‚Äôt need to be loud or expensive to be worth it. When I put boundaries around my weekend spending, I don‚Äôt feel punished. I feel creative.

That‚Äôs what I never expected budgeting to be. Not limiting-liberating.

**Book insight that helped me build better weekend habits**

In *Atomic Habits* by James Clear (Chapter 5), there‚Äôs a line that stuck: ‚ÄúYou do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.‚Äù

That one sentence reframed how I approach money, especially weekends. Wanting to ‚Äúspend less‚Äù wasn‚Äôt enough. I had to build *systems*\-habits, rules, checkpoints-that made spending less *automatic*. These small tweaks became rituals, and the rituals became a lifestyle. One I actually enjoy.

# Tools and Apps That Help Me Stick to My Budget Without Obsessing

Every app promises financial freedom. Most just give you one more notification to ignore. I tried everything-from spreadsheet templates to minimalistic budgeting apps with cute icons-and still felt overwhelmed. What finally worked wasn‚Äôt finding the ‚Äúperfect app.‚Äù It was finding the simplest one I‚Äôd *actually use*, and setting it up to run without needing my constant attention.

This section is for the people who want to stay on budget but don‚Äôt want budgeting to become their full-time hobby.

**Which apps I actually use to track money (and which I deleted)**

I‚Äôve downloaded at least ten finance apps in the last year. You know the ones-beautiful UI, fancy graphs, promises of ‚Äúsmart insights.‚Äù Most of them stressed me out more than they helped. Either they overcomplicated basic tasks, or they needed so much manual input that I gave up in three days.

Eventually, I deleted every app that made me feel like a failure when I forgot to log one transaction.

Now I only use two apps consistently: my bank‚Äôs native expense categorizer and Walnut. That‚Äôs it. Walnut syncs with my SMS history and auto-categorizes my spending without needing me to lift a finger. It‚Äôs not perfect, but it‚Äôs passive. Which is what I need.

I also set up my bank app to send weekly spending summaries. I don‚Äôt need to check it daily. Just once a week is enough to catch myself before I go into autopilot mode.

The point is this: your tools should work *for* you, not demand that you become a productivity guru just to keep up.

**How automation helped me save without trying**

Before automation, I used to tell myself I‚Äôd ‚Äúmanually transfer to savings‚Äù every month. That never happened. Some unexpected plan would pop up, and by the time I remembered, the money had already been spent-or disappeared into Swiggy‚Äôs hands.

Now, on the 2nd of every month, ‚Çπ10,000 auto-moves into a separate savings account I don‚Äôt touch. I don‚Äôt see it, so I don‚Äôt miss it.

I also have a second automation rule: my UPI cashback and reward points (however small) go straight into a digital wallet I label ‚Äúbonus fund.‚Äù It‚Äôs guilt-free money that I can use for things like books, gifts, or an unexpected movie night without wrecking my actual budget.

Automation isn‚Äôt about discipline. It‚Äôs about designing your money to move in the background while you live your life.

**Setting alerts and limits that keep me conscious-but not anxious**

There‚Äôs a fine line between ‚Äúbeing aware‚Äù and ‚Äúspiraling.‚Äù I used to get daily spending alerts and would just ignore them because they made me feel judged. That kind of financial guilt isn‚Äôt productive. It‚Äôs just paralyzing.

So I changed the tone of my alerts. I now have two specific alerts set on my UPI: one when I cross ‚Çπ3,000 in ‚Äúdiscretionary spending‚Äù and one when my main account balance dips below ‚Çπ4,000.

These alerts don‚Äôt shame me. They‚Äôre just little nudges. Like, ‚ÄúHey, do you still want to go out for that second dinner this week, or was that just a scroll-triggered craving?‚Äù

Instead of tracking every rupee, I use these gentle limits to stay emotionally in touch with where I‚Äôm at. No spreadsheets. No guilt charts. Just awareness.

**Book insight that reframed how I use money tools**

In *The Psychology of Money* by Morgan Housel (Chapter 16), he writes, ‚ÄúControlling your time is the highest dividend money pays.‚Äù That hit me hard.

I don‚Äôt budget to be rich someday. I budget so I can enjoy *now* without fear. And part of enjoying now means not wasting my life on endless financial micromanagement.

The right tools helped me buy that time back.

# How I Still Enjoy My Weekends Without Going Broke

There‚Äôs a version of budgeting that says, ‚ÄúCut fun first.‚Äù I lived by that for a while, and honestly? It sucked. Every weekend felt like a punishment for being responsible. I‚Äôd stay in, save money, and still feel bad-because I was missing life while trying to afford it.

That‚Äôs when I realized: a budget that doesn‚Äôt include joy will always fail. My weekends had to feel like *mine*, not a leftover after bills.

**Affordable weekend routines I look forward to**

Weekend joy used to mean cafes, rideshares, and that one boutique I had no business entering. But slowly, I started building routines that felt good *and* cost less.

Now, I plan one anchor activity every weekend that I genuinely look forward to. Sometimes it‚Äôs a morning walk with a podcast and my favorite filter coffee from a street stall. Sometimes it‚Äôs heading to the public library, reading something weirdly niche, and grabbing ‚Çπ50 samosas on the way home.

These aren‚Äôt just budget-friendly-they‚Äôve become rituals. And when your weekends have rhythm, you don‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre missing out. You feel grounded.

What shocked me most is how much I *crave* these slow, affordable rituals now. They feel like rest, not restriction.

**How I plan guilt-free treats and nights out on a budget**

I used to blow money on weekends not because I was reckless-but because I hadn‚Äôt planned for joy. When I did treat myself, it felt indulgent, maybe even shameful. Like I was cheating on my budget.

That mindset was exhausting.

So I flipped it. Every month, I now pre-choose one treat night. That could be a nice dinner, a concert ticket, or something I‚Äôd usually say no to. I call it my ‚Äúyes plan.‚Äù It‚Äôs budgeted, expected, and fully allowed. No guilt.

Because I planned for it, I can enjoy it in full. No stress. No self-scolding afterward. Just the experience-and the memory.

Treats, when planned, aren‚Äôt problems. They‚Äôre proof that your budget is built for your actual life.

**Why pre-planning fun makes spontaneous spending rare**

Before I started budgeting, I thought spontaneous plans were the only fun ones. The unplanned nights out, the last-minute brunches, the ‚Äúwe‚Äôll figure it out‚Äù weekends. But I learned something: when you never plan fun, you overpay for it.

Now, I plan my fun the way I used to plan my tasks. Not rigidly-but intentionally. If I know Saturday is for catching up with friends, I don‚Äôt say yes to something random on Friday just because I‚Äôm bored. I can say, ‚ÄúThat sounds fun, but I‚Äôve already got a plan I‚Äôm looking forward to.‚Äù

This doesn‚Äôt kill spontaneity-it just gives it a container. If something truly amazing comes up, I make space. But I‚Äôm not defaulting to ‚Äúyes‚Äù just because I‚Äôm tired or uninspired.

Planning fun gave me peace of mind. It also made the spontaneous moments *better*, because I wasn‚Äôt reacting-I was choosing.

**My favorite free and low-cost activities in the city**

Here‚Äôs the part no one tells you about big cities: they‚Äôre full of free magic if you know where to look.

I started mapping my city like a broke explorer. Local parks with open mic nights. Indie bookstores that host free readings. Museums that waive entry after 4 p.m. University campus plays. Art markets on Sunday mornings. I even found a rooftop community cinema that runs on donations and shows nostalgic 2000s films.

These aren‚Äôt backup plans-they‚Äôve become my favorite kind of weekends. There‚Äôs something about low-cost fun that makes you *feel* the moment more. Like you‚Äôre part of the world instead of just consuming it.

And when you leave the weekend with energy-not a drained wallet-that‚Äôs when budgeting starts to feel like freedom, not discipline.

**Book insight that changed how I experience low-cost joy**

In *The Art of Frugal Hedonism* by Annie Raser-Rowland (Chapter 4), she writes, ‚ÄúThe cheapest pleasures are often the ones richest in meaning.‚Äù That line lives rent-free in my head.

My best weekends now aren‚Äôt expensive. They‚Äôre thoughtful. They‚Äôre layered with memory and meaning. And I would‚Äôve missed them entirely if I believed joy only came with a receipt.

# Saving Without Feeling Deprived: The Mental Game

Most of us weren‚Äôt taught how to save-we were taught how to feel guilty for not saving. That‚Äôs why even when I managed to tuck away money, it didn‚Äôt feel like a win. It felt like self-denial. Like I was trading joy now for some vague safety later.

But saving doesn‚Äôt work when it‚Äôs powered by fear. It works when it‚Äôs powered by choice. This part of the journey had nothing to do with numbers-and everything to do with rewiring how I thought about money, self-worth, and freedom.

**The mindset shift that helped me stop feeling poor**

For the longest time, I associated budgeting with being poor. If I said no to plans or limited my spending, it felt like I was announcing I couldn‚Äôt afford things. But then I noticed something weird: the moments I *did* spend impulsively to avoid that feeling? They made me feel even poorer afterward.

The shift happened when I realized this-being broke isn‚Äôt just a bank balance. It‚Äôs a mindset where you always feel like you‚Äôre behind. Like you‚Äôre scrambling. When I started defining wealth as ‚Äúthe ability to make choices without panic,‚Äù everything changed.

Now, when I budget, I don‚Äôt feel small. I feel powerful. Because I‚Äôm the one deciding where my money goes-not my anxiety, not someone else‚Äôs expectation, not a Friday night impulse.

**How budgeting actually gave me more freedom, not less**

Before I started budgeting seriously, my money controlled me. It decided when I could say yes, when I had to decline, when I could exhale. But once I started assigning roles to every rupee, I wasn‚Äôt guessing anymore.

I didn‚Äôt expect this-but planning gave me *freedom*. It gave me options. It gave me confidence. I could go out knowing what I could spend. I could skip something without spiraling about what I was missing.

And most surprisingly, I could *enjoy* the things I did spend on. Guilt-free. Because I‚Äôd already made space for them in my plan.

People think budgeting is a cage. It‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs a map. It doesn‚Äôt trap you-it guides you to where you actually want to go.

**What I say when friends ask why I‚Äôm skipping plans**

This one used to be tough. I‚Äôd get that text: ‚ÄúDinner tonight?‚Äù and I‚Äôd freeze-not because I didn‚Äôt want to go, but because I didn‚Äôt know if I could say yes without derailing my month.

Saying no felt like admitting failure. Like I was less fun. Less successful. Less *okay*.

Now, I‚Äôm honest-but not defensive. I say, ‚ÄúNot tonight, I‚Äôm sticking to a plan this week. Let‚Äôs do chai tomorrow instead?‚Äù I offer something smaller, more doable, and still connected.

Here‚Äôs the truth no one says out loud: good friends won‚Äôt care if your fun costs ‚Çπ500 instead of ‚Çπ2,000. They care if you show up honestly.

And the more I shared my budget boundaries, the more my friends opened up about theirs. Turns out, everyone‚Äôs faking it a little. You saying ‚Äúno‚Äù might give someone else permission to stop pretending too.

**Mini-rewards that keep me motivated to stick to my plan**

Willpower is not infinite. I learned that the hard way. So I started building in mini rewards-tiny things that made budgeting feel like progress, not punishment.

Every time I hit a savings goal, even a small one, I do something that feels like a celebration. Not a massive splurge. Just something joyful. A solo breakfast date. A new book I‚Äôve wanted. A plant for my desk.

These rewards aren‚Äôt bribes-they‚Äôre proof. Proof that I can take care of myself *and* enjoy myself at the same time. That I‚Äôm not waiting for a future version of me to feel okay-I‚Äôm building it now, one smart decision at a time.

**Book insight that rewired my entire approach to money**

In *The Latte Factor* by David Bach (Chapter 1), there‚Äôs a moment when the main character learns: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre richer than you think.‚Äù That sentence shattered something in me.

I‚Äôd been waiting for some magic number to make me feel secure. But security came the moment I started making *intentional* decisions. Not perfect ones. Just real ones.

Budgeting isn‚Äôt about being rich someday. It‚Äôs about feeling *right now* that you‚Äôre in control, you‚Äôre safe, and you‚Äôre enough.



# FAQ

# Is ‚Çπ50K enough to live and still enjoy weekends in a city?

Yes-but only if you stop treating ‚Çπ50K like a mystery and start treating it like a math puzzle you can actually solve.

When I started, I thought enjoying weekends on this income meant cutting everything fun. What it actually meant was *planning* for the fun instead of hoping it‚Äôd fit in. Rent, food, EMIs, and transport will always eat up a chunk. But if you track your essentials and assign purpose to every rupee, you can absolutely carve out space for guilt-free fun.

In my experience, budgeting doesn‚Äôt mean saying ‚Äúno‚Äù to every plan-it just means knowing *which* ones you can say ‚Äúyes‚Äù to without spiraling by the 25th.



# How do I stop feeling broke even when I technically have money left?

This was the hardest mindset shift for me. Because technically having ‚Çπ4,000 left doesn‚Äôt mean much if it feels like it‚Äôll evaporate the second you look at it.

What helped me stop feeling broke was reconnecting with *what I valued*. I started aligning my spending with what gave me joy-like weekend street food and library trips-and cutting what drained me, like random online orders I didn‚Äôt even remember making.

Feeling broke is often about uncertainty, not zero balance. Once I started tracking weekly, setting small intentional spending limits, and knowing what each rupee was *for*, I felt less anxious-even when my bank balance wasn‚Äôt huge.



# What‚Äôs a realistic weekend spending cap on ‚Çπ50K?

There‚Äôs no magic number, but for most people working with a ‚Çπ50K monthly income, I‚Äôve found that setting a weekend budget between ‚Çπ400 and ‚Çπ1,000 works without throwing off the rest of the month.

Some weekends I spend just ‚Çπ300 and feel completely fulfilled. Others I go up to ‚Çπ900-but only when I‚Äôve planned for it in advance. The number isn‚Äôt what matters most. *The intention behind it does.*

If your rent and fixed expenses are high, you‚Äôll have to keep the cap lower. If you live with roommates or family and pay less on housing, you get more wiggle room. The trick is knowing your own limit before you open Zomato on a Saturday night.



# Do I need to track every rupee to stay on budget?

Not even close.

I used to think budgeting meant obsessing. Manually logging every snack, every cab, every random app purchase. But that just burned me out.

What actually worked was doing a weekly 10-minute money check-in. I‚Äôd glance at my UPI history, scan my bank app summary, and ask: ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs the month going?‚Äù

This helped me catch patterns-like overspending on food delivery or forgetting about upcoming EMIs-without micromanaging my entire life. I don‚Äôt need a spreadsheet. Just awareness. That alone made me feel more in control than any hyper-detailed app ever did.



# How do I deal with social pressure to spend more?

This one hits hard-especially when you‚Äôre the only one saying ‚Äúmaybe not tonight‚Äù in a group chat full of ‚Äúlet‚Äôs just go out.‚Äù

What worked for me was offering *alternatives*. If someone suggested a pricey dinner, I‚Äôd say, ‚ÄúHow about chai and a walk? I‚Äôm keeping it chill this week.‚Äù Most of the time, people were actually relieved. Turns out, everyone‚Äôs tired of overpaying for mid food and expensive Uber rides home.

The key is not apologizing for your budget. It‚Äôs not a weakness. It‚Äôs a boundary. And boundaries-when shared with confidence-often inspire others to set their own too.

If someone judges you for budgeting? That‚Äôs about *them*, not you.",1,1751446958.0,TheFinanceTrending,0,1.0,False

(NAGAWA KO ITONG POST NA ITO DAHIL SA SOBRANG SAMA NG LOOB KO SA AKING NAGING AMO)
{{Natanggal kami at hindi binigay ang aming  Benepisyo na Matagal na naming hinihintay}}

Here's my story nung ako ay Close-In Security ng isang Dating Mayamang Negosyante...
 (Please read)
 
Madalas Makasama ng aking Dating Mayamang Boss ang Isang Magandang Sexy Model Actress na  Pasikat pa lamang na nagpapainit sa mga Kalalakihan During her rise to fame from 2016 until before the pandemic. Madalas Bumisita sa Dalawang Luxury Condo Unit / Pent House si Sexy Model Actress (Makati or BGC)ng pagmamay-ari aking Dating Mayamang Boss .  She was a stunningly beautiful and sexy model and actress, with porcelain-like skin, and a particular favorite of my former boss.  (masasabi Kong sya ay Paboritong Bisita or iniimbitahan ni Boss)  
Halos Year 2017 na sya Bumibisita hanggang Bago at Patapos na ang Pandemic ü§§‚òïüòâ
 
Si Sexy Model Actress ay madalas Bumisita sa luxury condo unit in Makati and BGC (na pagmamay ari ng Aking Boss), and even luxury hotels like Okada and Solaire.  (Even though she had a boyfriend at the time), these visits were ostensibly for coffee and conversation(Kwentuhan lang daw at Kape‚òïüí¶üòã .Kapag Darating sya (Si Sexy ModeI Actress )I was often tasked with meeting her in the lobby, handing her key card to her PA, and escorting her to the elevator. (She usually had a gay companion who would remain in the lobby‚Äîlikely her manager or handler.)
 
After her visits, and as she was leaving, I was often instructed by one of my former boss's assistants to delete copies of the CCTV footage or Indoor Cam from inside the luxury unit in BGC or Makati (dahil mainit na at Nakakahalata yung Misis ng aming Dating Boss). Before deleting the footage, I'd naturally watch it first(habang tumitigas ang Junjun ko, sometimes even saving clips to my phone (though my phone is broken now, recovery might be possible).  She was captivating to watch, even just sitting on the sofa sa Living Room Area(kahit kwentuhan lang sila ni Boss with Coffee and Wineüçæ‚òïü§§  She often wore simple jeans (Maong na Kupas minsan and flowery Korean dresses, sometimes a black and pink combination na Bistida)
(Hindi ko na alam ang mg susunod na pangyayari kapag pumasok sila sa Master Bdr-1&2 sapagkat wala na or hindi na abot ang Indoor/Security Cam dun hanggang sa labas lang ng pintuan bago sila pumasok sa Mahiwangang Room or Master BDR-1&2)
 
Mahinhin at Maingat din si BeautifuI Sexy Actress minsan ayaw nya Nagpapahawak kung saan saan iniiwasan minsan ang kamay ni boss or naiilang lang siguro si Girl (Hanggang Hair at beywang minsan sa Tuhod ang nahahawakan ni Boss Base  sa napapanood ko sa Indoor Cam bago ko burahin ang Kopya or Footage ewan ko lang kapag pumasok na sila sa Master BDR-1 After Magbihis or magpalit na parang Sexy Outfit ni Girl ha .. wala na kasi nka install na Indoor Cam. dun sa Area na yunü§îü§§)

I estimate that some visits ni Beauty Sexy Actress Model kay Boss sa Loob ng Unit is lasted six hours or more, sometimes until morning.  When the assistant asked me to get her extra ""decent"" t-shirts, supposedly for changes,(ibig sabihin dun sya magpapalipas ng Gabi)(Minsan ako din ang Pumipick-up sa isang High-end Mall sa mga susuoting Sexy Outfit ni Girl naka box na agad kapag kukunin ko) I'd place them on the sofa of Luxury Unit ni Boss Bago dumating si Beautiful Sexy Model Actress.

 However, when I checked the box, they were often sexy nighties or lingerie, including expensive bras (size D-cup)(Sinisilip ko syempre yung mamahalin at Malalaking Sizes ng Bra including Nighties or Lingerie siguro yun at Body  Liquid Soap na nilalagay sa Bathub hehe), at pinapadispose or pinapatapon din kaagad ni Boss yung mga mamahaling Sexy Outfits pagkatapos bumisita ni Sexy Model Actress Ako nmn ay Inaamoy ko muna or minsan ay Tinatago ko sa aking Locker kasama yung mga Lotion.hehe (Amoy Mamahaling Parfume) (Sarap Amuyin ng Damit na pinaghubaran ni Ms.Beautiful Sexy Actress
 The food was sometimes slightly diminished, but the expensive alcohol and wine were untouched; she didn't drink (hindi talaga uniinom kahit anong klaseng alak si Sexy Actress Model).Bukod sa Napaka ganda at sexy ay Napaka bait (kahit may konting retoke or pinagawa sa katawan),Si Sexy Actress walang nirerequest na mamahaling Luxury Items Like Bags etc. kay Former Boss kapag sila ay nagkikita sa Unit (hindi sya katulad ng ibang girls na Maluho)
 
I remember that whenever our former wealthy boss learned of sexy photos posted by the actress on IG and FB, or if she had suggestive segments in her shows, he'd get angry. He'd immediately call her, and if she didn't answer, her handler would be contacted to have the pictures taken down.
(Si Boss ang nagbabawal din sakanya na magsuot ng Sexy damit at huwag litaw ang Cleavege)

 I believe this is why she broke up with her boyfriend at the time ( Nabalitaan kasi ni Former Boss na Nag Lilive in sila Sexy Actress at Kanyang BF)and why she stopped doing sexy roles and posting sexy content on social media for several years.  (kontralado ni boss nung mga panahon na yun pati yung Real Life BF ni Ate Girl)
 
Now, however, she's back to being sexy, Nagpapainit ulit sa mga Barako sa pamamagitan ng Social Media Post. Haha.
(Pero kung nandyan pa siguro si Boss at mayaman pa ay magagalit na namn panigurado yun at ipapabura nya)
 
I can say that she was one of our former wealthy boss's favorites (dahil napakabait nmn talaga), as she was the only one I saw visiting his luxury unit or penthouse sa BGC or Makati 
 (yung iba kasing mga Models na inuuwi or iniimbitahan ay hanggang sa mga Orinary Condo lang nya sa Pasay Malapit sa Resorts World at Mariot pero High-end din or minsan sa OKADA,SOLAIRE & Shangrila the fort) ni Boss .
 Sometimes, kaming mga security personnel would even escort her home to her village in Quezon City.(Hatid Sundo pa at Alam din naming mga Close-In Security na ang Dating Boss namin ang Nagpagawa ng Bahay ni Sexy Model Actress  sa isang Exclusive Village na yun sa QC kung saan namin sya madalas ihatid)(Hindi naman masyado High-End yung Village)
 
Clue:
 
  1.   Miss Beautiful Sexy Actress ‚Äì Still appears on television, but now in action roles at bumalik ulit sa pagpapa sexy sa kanyang Social Media Post.

(Mahuhulaan ninyo sa pamamagitan ng mga Blurred na Kunwari ay Lumang Larawan sa Taas)
 
  2.   My Former Wealthy Boss ‚Äì Luge na sya ngayon maraming Utang sa Bangko

I have no baby and no energy. I honestly did not believe I'd be this utterly knackered at 37 weeks. Everyone warned me I wouldn't want to do anything but I naively thought I'd be going shopping for baby bits, having days out with my mum, getting coffee with friends. I don't want to do any of it, partly because I'm exhausted but also because I find the company of others fills me with rage these days, which is entirely unfair on them but I really am finding it hard to be around anyone without feeling annoyed by the constant baby talk and dismissive comments.

Sitting on my phone or watching TV for like 8 hours a day is starting to make me feel really quite depressed. I'm getting out for dog walks as much as I can but even that is a massive struggle as my joints are just in constant agony and I can't bloody breathe. I usually sew as a hobby but I can't fit in my seat behind the machine anymore, lmao. Husband suggested the cinema but there's nothing on I want to see right now. I'm out of ideas and would welcome suggestions for ways to fill the endless wait for this baby to arrive!

The following was all transcribed for Mr Joshua Tibbets‚Äô audio log. No additions have been made at the request of the United States Government, and United States Navy.

Entry 1. Day 1

‚ÄúHello, uh this is Joshua Tibbets. This is going to be my audio log, I was going to be a journal, but I thought that this format may be better suited to the field of work I‚Äôm about to be in, and what my findings could be. For those using this audio log as a way to record my notes following my new position, again I am Joshua Tibbets, 36 years old, and I‚Äôm a Lieutenant Junior Grade, and have been in the Navy for 5 Years.

I‚Äôm stationed aboard the USS. McAlister somewhere off the coast of Anchorage Alaska now, and we‚Äôre heading to what I believe to be where we‚Äôre going to be scouting for Chinese subs, or so I believe. Any who, I thought I‚Äôd make a start on this thing before I forget, I feel like a journal, or a log is something you got to stick with or you'll just never do it. Got to make it a habit.

Mess Hall is calling us for supper now, so I‚Äôll update this again in the morning. Alright, uh over and out? See ya.‚Äù

Transmission Ended.

Entry 2. Day 2

‚ÄúOkay, well good morning! This is day two on our voyage. We‚Äôve reached our patrol border to keep a look out for the Chinese and I think there will be a briefing after breakfast. I don‚Äôt think I can bring the recorder into the briefing which is a bummer, but I‚Äôll give the jist of what our plans are.

Also, I probably should mention why I am logging all of this. Prior to our departure, myself and 4 other seamen were chosen to conduct an observation and information gathering operation on the behaviour of the Chinese subs. This information would then be sent back to HQ and be implemented to better understand how to combat their technology, weapon systems, and so on.

Besides myself, there is Reynolds, Harper, Richards, and Simmons. Harper being the senior seamen of the five of us. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll have a better chance to meet Simmons and Reynolds soon, and maybe pick Harper‚Äôs brain, get some stories out of him. Richards is already part of my unit so I‚Äôd say he and I are already well acquainted.

Ooh alright I think it‚Äôs time for the briefing, so I‚Äôll be back shortly.‚Äù

Transmission Ended.

Entry 3. Day 2

‚ÄúRight, I‚Äôm back from the briefing. The ship will be getting the majority of the crew to begin their preparations for the Chinese sub operation aboard the ship. Positions are to be manned, equipment checked. The standard run-down for an operation of this nature.

However, Reynolds, Harper, Richards, Simmons, and myself are being treated as a separate unit, and are being tasked with a different post all together, and it‚Äôs not on this ship. The briefing concluded with the captain asking the rest of the crews to leave, while we stayed behind to receive our orders. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love a good old secret, but I thought we were all in on the same mission here?

Anyways, we hung back, and approached the captain. He told us that we‚Äôd be getting picked up from the loading bay at 17:30 in a Navy Dinghy boat, and taken to another nearby Navy observation facility that specialises in submersibles. I guess we‚Äôre going in subs then? Neat. They didn‚Äôt give us too much more to go on besides that, so I guess we'll sit here and wait until tonight.

I sit here now looking out the porthole of my room and see little chunks of ice floating past. Alright, I‚Äôll update again when the boat arrives. Over and out. Or Josh out. I haven‚Äôt quite worked that part out yet.‚Äù

Transmission Ended.

Entry 4. Day 2

‚ÄúOkay, it‚Äôs 17:27, we got word from the captain that the boat is here to pick us up. I‚Äôve got my bags ready, room cleared out. I rate the room a 3 out of 5 stars. Sorry Navy. Let‚Äôs hope the next stay is a bit more luxurious than my dorm cubicle.

Reynolds seems nervous to leave. I think he‚Äôs got this thing about water at night? I don‚Äôt know, something weird like that. Harper was giving him shit for it, telling him to suck it up or something to that effect. Besides that, no Chinese sub activity spotted yet which is a plus. I -‚Äù

INDISCERNIBLE VOICE : ‚ÄúTibbets, let's get a move on, boat‚Äôs here!‚Äù

‚ÄúOh shit okay, sorry boat‚Äôs here now. I‚Äôll update next when we get to wherever it is we‚Äôre going. Tibbets out.‚Äù

Entry 5. Day 2

‚ÄúOkay, I don‚Äôt think I got this thing wet which is good, lights all come on when my voice is picked up. BEEP BEEP- yep, it works. Cool, uh, okay. Right, so the place where we are is pretty interesting. We‚Äôre about 2 miles away from the USS McAlister, I can see its lights in the distance. It gets dark so quickly up here. It‚Äôs only 18:15 and it could be midnight for all I know, it's that dark.

This place seems to be another branch off of the Navy‚Äôs research operation, and while I‚Äôve been told it is, and they say it is, there‚Äôs very little US Navy insignias around. The claustrophobic walkways inside the metal hallways are rusted, and dimly lit, but then will have rooms with state of the art tech. I can always hear dripping water and machinery buzzing.

We‚Äôve been shown to our dorms which is where I am now. It‚Äôs dark, real dark. I‚Äôm going to put this down now and update tomorrow after our new orders are given to us by the team here in the briefing. Tibbets out.‚Äù

Entry 6. Day 3

‚ÄúWell, good morning. Not the best sleep as I‚Äôd hoped. The boat, or station, rocked all night on the rough sea. Must‚Äôve been some bad wind. I heard what I think was Simmons's being seasick last night, his dorm is across the hall from mine.

I think this morning we will have a better chance to get to meet one another properly. They‚Äôll probably want us to since we‚Äôre a small team who are meant to be working together.

I think I‚Äôm going to head into the break room and get some coffee, mingle with some other of the crewmates who are up. I‚Äôll be back to update soon, just a few hours or so.‚Äù

Transmission Ended.

Entry 7. Day 3

‚ÄúMRE‚Äôs for breakfast and the coffee was... well it was okay. I got to chat with Reynolds a bit. He‚Äôs from Texas and he‚Äôs 27. He‚Äôs been in the Navy for 3 years. Single, no kids. Like me. He‚Äôs eager to see what it is we‚Äôre going to be doing here. As am I.

Soon after that Simmons came in too looking worse for wear. He had some coffee and ate what he could stomach. Ironic a guy who has seasickness is in the Navy of all places.

Harper broke our conversation as he walked past dressed in uniform already, and had an energy about him like he‚Äôd already been up for hours. What is it about older guys with that?

Anyways, getting off topic, he ordered that we make our way down to the briefing room, and to get dressed asap.

In the briefing room we were met by three Naval scientists in semi-casual scientist gowns? There were another two naval officers in uniform also.

They explained to us that the task we have been put on will span the next seven days, as they have had updated information from the USS McAllister of some confirmed Chinese Submarine activity. I got pretty excited and I could see that Reynolds and Richards were too.

The man running this operation, Mr Tom Eichmann explained how we would be each undergoing different tests such as pressurisation tests, isolation and confinement tests before our individual descents under the ocean to record our findings, and report them back to the team and HQ.

They told us that each of us would go down for a period of three hours at a time, and only one person could go down per day due to the restraints of the submersible, and reup times of the other machinery, fuel, and Chinese sub activity.

We were dismissed, and were told that the tests and descents would start this afternoon. So, a lot to take in, but I am eagerly waiting to get started today. I will keep you posted. Tibbets out.‚Äù

Transmission Ended.

Entry 8. Day 3

‚ÄúWe went in for our first pressurisation test today just after lunch. We each got to go into this room that was behind a seriously huge bulkhead. The room was fitted to look like the inside of a submarine, however we were told that the sub we would be using was only going to be big enough to house one occupant at a time. So I guess this was just purely a test on us.

We climbed into our seats and strapped in. The door was shut, and the metal wheel was spun shut to lock it. A voice over the loudspeakers would inform us on every 100 feet that we went down. When the voice started to read out the initial depths, my body started to feel a bit heavy, but as the pressure was soon adjusted, it was like nothing was different in the slightest.

However, when the voice started to read out depths much below that of any operational submarine I know of, I started to feel a bit worried. Just how advanced were these subs? Was the US Navy equipped to handle something that was lurking so deep beneath the surface? Of course with other subs they were, sure, but what sub is operating at the depth of the Titanic?

After we came out of the pressurisation test, I saw some confused and concerned looks on the faces of the crew. I wonder if they had the same concerns I did.

Next up was the isolation test which was to simulate the event of a power outage, or light failure and we‚Äôd need to be down there until a recovery crew came. For hours we sat in that room in the complete pitch black. Some of the men, I didn‚Äôt see who, started talking to things, or seeing things that weren't there. The brain can do some scary things.

Tomorrow will be our first descent for one of the crew, so I‚Äôm going to put this away and hit the hay. I‚Äôm a bit anxious, but nonetheless excited. Tibbets out.‚Äù

Entry 9. Day 4

‚ÄúAlright! Good morning. Today is the day! This is day two onboard the research facility, and today we dive! Well when I say we, I mean just one of us, but as a team this is the start of this operation for us. I can‚Äôt tell if the chills I get are from nervousness or excitement.

Reynolds is the first to descend today. We‚Äôll all be taking a group photo with him before he dives down. He‚Äôs going to head to his pressure and isolation checks shortly after a light breakfast, and no coffee. I think you can guess why.

I‚Äôll come back when Reynolds is in the water. Talk shortly.‚Äù

Transmission Ended.

  
Entry 10. Day 4

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre away! Reynolds is in the water and diving down. We got to see the sub he‚Äôs going in, and yeah it‚Äôs only really just big enough for one person. The front of it is a big steel bathysphere with a porthole window and light fixtures. The rear is in the shape of a fin, and has landers and propellers attached to the side. The whole apparatus however, is connected to a link at the top of the steel dome with an industry grade hook and steel cable which returns to the research facility.

I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve seen something like it before. Reynolds seems to be descending quickly which is good, and from what I saw, the submersible is in a stable condition, and we‚Äôre receiving good data from it.

Only issue is that the subs comms system isn‚Äôt functioning, so we can‚Äôt directly get in touch with Reynolds, nor can he to us. It will be a few hours now until Reynolds comes back to the surface, so I‚Äôll update then. If anything of importance happens before then I‚Äôll turn this back on.

Tibbets out.‚Äù

Entry 11. Day 4

‚ÄúReynolds has returned to the surface. It‚Äôs been hours since we last saw him, and what we saw when we opened the hatch to the sub was nothing I was prepared for. The steel latches are released, the wheel spun and the hatch opened, and the opened hatch let out the loudest and most harrowing screams I have heard.

The scientist team went into the docking room with protective uniforms and equipment on to retrieve Reynolds from the craft. His eyes were‚Ä¶ his eyes were white, rolled into the back of his head, and his hands‚Ä¶ God, his hands. They looked like they were cramped and spasming at the same time trying to grasp at his throat and his head. He was utterly delirious, screaming and shouting.

I‚Äôd never seen anything like it. About 45 minutes later, the scientist came out from the medic bay and relayed to us what had happened. They claimed that he‚Äôd suffered an extremely freak accident where the air in the sub was not properly working as intended, leaving him with brain damage. I‚Äôve never seen someone with brain damage act with that much energy though, usually they‚Äôre, well, a vegetable.

Looking over at Simmons, he was as white as a ghost. Tomorrow is his turn, and we‚Äôve been assured the sub will be worked on through the night. Let‚Äôs hope everything goes smoothly tomorrow. Tibbets out.‚Äù

Entry 12. Day 5

‚ÄúMorning. Though I don‚Äôt even know who I‚Äôm saying that for, but morning nonetheless. Everyone is on edge and pretty anxious today. After yesterday‚Äôs mishap, we‚Äôve got every right to be. Reynolds still hasn‚Äôt been seen since he entered Med Bay.

We‚Äôve already been briefed on the upgrades made to the sub‚Äôs capabilities that were worked on overnight, and there were even tests shown to prove it. I think this helped, but Simmons was still pale. Whether that was from seasickness or yesterday's events, I wasn‚Äôt sure.

After his own pressure and isolation tests were done, it was time for him to climb in, and he did so with shaky hands. Thankfully the comms system has been brought back online so we‚Äôll be able to have an actual line of communication this time. If anything happens during Simmons‚Äô descent, I will record the audio. Tibbets out.‚Äù

Entry 13. Day 5

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve just had some comms come through from Simmons, the screen is displaying the sub at 3500 meters below sea level. Let‚Äôs get this mic on and check in on him. Is that alright Tom?‚Äù

TOM: ‚ÄúYes, go ahead Joshua.‚Äù

‚ÄúPerfect. Hey, are you there Simmons?‚Äù

SIMMONS: ‚ÄúH-Hey! Who‚Äôs there?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs me, Tibbets, Joshua Tibbets. How‚Äôs it looking down there?‚Äù

SIMMONS: ‚ÄúOh! Hey Josh. Yeah uh, man it‚Äôs so dark down here. The lights illuminate the few feet in front of me but that‚Äôs about it.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay nice, nice, how are you feeling? See any subs down there?‚Äù

SIMMONS: ‚ÄúYeah it uh, it‚Äôs pretty claustrophobic but I‚Äôm okay. And no, no subs ye‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúHey Simmons? Simmons? What‚Äôs up?‚Äù

SIMMONS: ‚ÄúI‚ÄîI see‚Ä¶ I see‚Ä¶ oh‚Ä¶ OH.. OH MY GOD I SEE I‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúSimmons! What was that noise?! Richards what was that bang?! Shit, shit, bring him up now!‚Äù

Transmission Ended.

  
Entry 14. Day 5

‚ÄúWe brought the sub back to the surface and recovered Simmons. If what was left of him was even... him. His head, his fucking head. It was split open like a watermelon hit with buckshot. The walls of the sub were coated in blood. I turned away as they brought him out and I couldn‚Äôt look.

I heard Richards be sick, and Harper let out a disgusted grunt. This is turning into a disaster. I don‚Äôt know why the US Navy would hand this team off to a group of scientists and engineers who can‚Äôt even put a fucking sub together properly. Especially for a mission as important as this.

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be able to sleep tonight, and neither will Richards if I had to guess. He will be going down tomorrow.‚Äù

Transmission Ended.

Entry 15. Day 6

‚ÄúAs I thought, I had a pretty sleepless night. I heard screams coming from what I can only assume was the med bay. Some new instructions have been given to us by the team aboard the facility. They told us, ‚ÄòIf you start to see movement out of the porthole, use the camera provided to you to capture an image. If the sub detects that it is being viewed, they may be using some type of weaponry. It may be ultrasonic which we believe is what caused Simmons‚Äô death.‚Äô

So yeah. I‚Äôm not sure what to make of all this, however I‚Äôm hopeful that using the camera in Richards‚Äô descent will give us a better idea what we‚Äôre working with here.

I‚Äôll come back when Richards is in the water. Tibbets out.‚Äù

Transmission Ended.

Entry 16. Day 6

‚ÄúRichards told me before he got in the sub that this has been shaping up to be the most bizarre operation he‚Äôs been on in his 4 years in the Navy, and I don‚Äôt disagree. Richards is now making a steady descent and has been making active communication. The team are eagerly awaiting to see what he captures.

Tibbets out for now.‚Äù

Entry 17. Day 6

‚ÄúOkay, we‚Äôre back, uh Richards has just told us that he‚Äôs spotted something. Go ahead Richards, what did you see?‚Äù

RICHARDS: ‚ÄúUh I‚Äôm not too sure, but it seemed big, and it was moving pretty damn fast. I can see it on the sonar getting closer. Okay, okay it‚Äôs coming near!‚Äù

‚ÄúClose your eyes and snap some photos! We‚Äôll bring you back up right after, okay?!‚Äù

RICHARDS: ‚ÄúOkay‚Ä¶ *Click* Click\* Click\*‚Äù

‚ÄúGood work! Are you alright?!‚Äù

RICHARDS: ‚ÄúYes, yeah I‚Äôm okay. Please just get me the fuck outta here.‚Äù

Entry 18. Day 6

‚ÄúOkay, we‚Äôre just pulling Richards back up now and into the docking station, standby‚Ä¶ Alright, okay he‚Äôs here now. Go ahead and open the hatch!... Oh thank god, Richards!‚Äù

RICHARDS: ‚ÄúGod am I glad to be back up here, get me out of this thing!‚Äù

‚ÄúThe team is currently helping Richards out of the sub, he‚Äôs got the camera in hand, and we‚Äôre going to bring it to the viewing station. Standby.‚Äù

Transmission Ended.

Entry 19. Day 6

‚ÄúWe have just reviewed the photos taken by Richards, and we are completely baffled. The camera‚Äôs flash caught the inside of the cabin, capturing the sonar with a white dot right in front of the sub. But even with the sub lights on and the camera‚Äôs flash, the porthole view is just‚Ä¶ black.

The closest thing I can think of is that video of a guy taking a photo of a doorway where a ghost was in his house and it‚Äôs the same, just black. It‚Äôs as if something doesn‚Äôt want us seeing it like this.

The team is going to do their reports and run diagnostics over these photos and the sub‚Äôs data, but it‚Äôs late now, and I‚Äôm going to head to bed, or do my best to. Tibbets out.‚Äù

Entry 20. Day 7

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what time it is, but it‚Äôs still dark out. I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been hearing screams from Med Bay for maybe close to an hour now. They‚Äôve stopped, and now I can hear staggered footsteps about the facility.

The footsteps are coming down the hallway now to the dorms‚Ä¶ the feet are casting shadows under the door‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre still walking. Sorry if I‚Äôm hard to hear, I have to be very quiet. Oh my god, shit something‚Äôs banging on a door. Richards?‚Äù

RICHARDS: ‚ÄúUgh, I‚Äôm coming‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúBANG BANG BANG‚Äù

RICHARDS: ‚ÄúWhat? Who is it?... R-Reynolds‚Ä¶ AHHHHHHHHHHHH‚Äù

‚ÄúOh fuck! Fuck! What the fuck is going on out there‚Ä¶ Oh no, oh my‚Ä¶ No, no, no! Reynolds is fucking, eating Richards in his doorway, he‚Äôs just laying there screaming‚Ä¶ Someone else is coming!‚Äù

‚ÄúY-yes sir. *sigh* Here we go. Breakaway procedure engaged, and descent is active. There. Okay Harper, we‚Äôll monitor you on your way down. Just make sure to keep telling us what‚Äôs going on, and any reports you need to make.‚Äù

He‚Äôs shivering, but he‚Äôs not cold. He‚Äôs refused space blankets, normal blankets, jumpers, everything. The scientists are writing down a bunch of stuff on a clipboard and observing him in the Med Bay, I can see through the glass.

Wait. He‚Äôs just gotten up, he‚Äôs‚Äîhe‚Äôs coming this way. Harper. Harper? Harper! What the‚Äîhe‚Äôs just walked straight past me‚ÄîHarper, where are you going?‚Äù

Here‚Äôs what high cortisol can actually look like:

* Puffy, swollen face (especially around the eyes)
* Breakouts, especially hormonal or cystic acne
* Hair thinning or shedding (including eyebrow thinning)
* Feeling anxious, snappy, or overwhelmed constantly
* Always hungry or craving sugar/salty snacks
* Fatigue despite sleeping ‚Äúenough‚Äù

If this is you, don't worry! I personally experienced this and incorporated some things that helped manage  cortisol levels, and I feel/look so much better now. You don't have to do all of them, at first focus on incorporating 3 changes, and see how you feel! Hoping this helps someone :)

Here's what you can do:

1. Consume your morning caffeine at least one hour after waking up
2. Adaptogen supplements (E.g. Ashwgandha, Rhodiolia, Crodyceps, etc)
3. Limit super intense workouts, focus on low intensity or weight training
4. Go on a 20 minute walk daily (Rush walk to work doesn't count ;) )
5. If you drink multiple cups of coffee a day, after your first coffee, opt in for lower caffinated drinks or matcha
6. If you struggle with sleep, dim lights 2 hours before bed and no sugar 2 hours before bed
7. Aim for max 5 minutes of phone time within first hour of waking up

1lpqotc,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1lpqotc/advice_on_choosing_a_machine/,ADVICE ON CHOOSING A MACHINE,"As the title says I am looking for advice on choosing a machine for my espresso station. I recently moved back to India and am looking to get an espresso machine for my daily coffee needs but am confused as to which one to get. Currently I am stuck between 4 options: 

1. Gaggia classic evo pro [E24 variant] - I am intrigued by the value this machine provides but have heard that it needs to be moded to get the best out of the machine. I am not opposed to the idea of opening the machine up to change the OPV spring to 9 bars but am concerned about warranty as well as the availability of the spring in India [any leads would be appreciated]. Secondly I have heard one needs to install the PID kit to get the best out of the machine something I am not too comfortable doing. 

2. Lelit Victoria - Have heard great reviews about the machine but have also heard that the stock pressure is over 9 bars and getting to the OPV valve is a hassle hence the hesitation. 

3. Profitec Go - seems like the best choice so far as it has PID and an external adjustable OPV screw. 

In terms of grinders I am leaning towards the DF 64 Gen 2 or the Euraka Mignon Zero 65 all purpose [the new one with the king dial]. 

I could really use some advice as to which machine and grinder to choose. 

P.S I am new to the prosumer espresso machine scene and was using nespresso pods before I moved back, but since nespresso pods would come out to be too expensive in the long run I have decided to invest in a good machine. 

Also any recommendations of other machines and grinders are welcome. My budget for the entire setup is around 2 Lacs. ",1,1751445710.0,IndiaCoffee,3,1.0,False

**The Hunt:** Over months of messages, she systematically studies his psychology through social media research. Mirrors his exact interests and values. Uses sophisticated emotional language to create false intimacy and learn about his psychology. Shares vulnerability about being an outsider that had to learn to always fit in and constantly adapt to everyone else, always putting others first. Repeatedly drops clues (""you're easy to read"") that she's analyzing him, disguised as playful observations. Makes stories and observations that sometimes do not quite add up.

**The Trap:** She manufactures a family crisis (parent's death) timed perfectly to extract maximum emotional support and create artificial intimacy. When he offers alternatives, she enthusiastically pushes for him to join her as a plus one at a wedding in Budapest - a grand romantic gesture she actively encourages. She cannot help but drop hints at her intentions as she invites him.

**The Display:** At the wedding, she parades him as a social trophy, announcing to friends ""he flew here to meet me without ever meeting before."" Her educated social circle treats him as entertainment (""this could be entertaining""). She abandons him with her friends to test his psychological responses while they observe and score his reactions.

**The Exposure:** One woman becomes upset learning about the manipulation. After reflection, she confronts the manipulator the next day, threatening exposure.

**The Reveal:** Forced to end prematurely, the manipulator delivers a cruel breakup with barely contained satisfaction as she visibly enjoys his confusion. Blames him for the grand gesture she encouraged: ""This is why you start with coffee.""

**The Horror:** In a ""the usual suspects moment"" all pieces fall into place as the protagonist realizes the person he thought he knew never existed - everything was psychological construction designed specifically to exploit his vulnerabilities by someone who weaponized emotional intelligence for predatory purposes.",1,1751445035.0,stories,0,1.0,False
1lpqij4,https://www.garlizen.com/hormone-balance-weight-loss-quick-stress-reducing-elixirs-for-hormonal-harmony/,Hormone Balance & Weight Loss: Quick Stress-Reducing Elixirs For Hormonal Harmony,"**Hormone Balance & Weight Loss: Quick Stress-Reducing Elixirs For Hormonal Harmony**

Hormone balance plays a crucial role in weight loss, as hormones significantly influence metabolism, appetite, and fat storage. Many individuals struggle with hormonal imbalances due to stress, lifestyle choices, and diet. Quick stress-reducing elixirs can help restore hormonal harmony, facilitating weight loss and overall well-being.

Stress often triggers the release of cortisol, a hormone that can lead to weight gain, especially around the abdomen. By incorporating natural elixirs designed to reduce stress, individuals can help lower cortisol levels and promote hormonal balance. Consider these effective elixirs:


  Chamomile Tea: Known for its calming effects, chamomile tea can reduce anxiety and improve sleep, aiding in cortisol regulation.
  Matcha Green Tea: Packed with antioxidants, matcha can enhance metabolism and provide a steady energy boost without the jitters associated with coffee.
  Golden Milk: Made with turmeric, this comforting beverage boasts anti-inflammatory properties and can help balance hormones.
  Lemon Water: A simple yet effective elixir, lemon water aids digestion and detoxification, promoting a healthy balance of hormones.


Incorporating these elixirs into your daily routine can support stress reduction and hormonal balance, making weight loss more attainable. Additionally, maintaining a well-rounded diet filled with whole foods, healthy fats, and lean proteins can further enhance hormonal harmony.

For optimal results, consider mindfulness practices such as meditation, yoga, or deep-breathing exercises alongside your elixir consumption. These practices can lower stress levels and contribute to a balanced hormonal state, creating a holistic approach to weight loss.

roll off of me without a single word 
and fall asleep

 I lay for a moment and look at the ceiling, listening to your rhythmic breathing and 
feel adjust your arm under your pillow 

I quietly get up and sneak out, 
not quite comfortable enough to risk waking you, 
even though just a moment ago your arms were wrapped around me like I meant something

I sit on the curb outside and light a cigarette which stings my throat, 
but is a nice distraction to the burning in my eyes and tears running down my cheeks

I watch the smoke float up into the light and dissipate, 
much like the false sense of love I felt just 15 minutes ago

 Did you know that my body might be the least interesting thing about me? 
You don‚Äôt know my favorite song, 
or that sunset is my favorite time of day, 
you don‚Äôt even know how I take my coffee which is almost funny considering how often we‚Äôve woken up next to each other. 

I‚Äôm one dimensional to you, 
just a vessel to lean into when you‚Äôre bored

I suddenly gag, 
which catches me off guard- 
it‚Äôs not because I‚Äôm sick or because we‚Äôve been drinking 
but the weight of what I‚Äôve just done pushes down on my chest

You‚Äôll never notice but I‚Äôve given you another tiny piece of me tonight, a piece that I‚Äôll never get back

The worst part is, that the next time you call 
I‚Äôll answer, 
even though I‚Äôve promised myself the last three times I wouldn‚Äôt
Your callous touch feels better than no touch at all

Without thinking I press the filter into my lips, just enough to burn a little, 
but I don‚Äôt even flinch
Somehow I can‚Äôt feel anything other than the gnawing ache of discontent 
growing throughout my entire body

So I‚Äôll sit here for a moment longer, 
pretending that the warmth from the cigarette and the gentle breeze is enough to hold me where you wouldn‚Äôt

I slip back inside and curl up next to you, holding my breath, 
hoping you‚Äôll hold me
I‚Äôm hardly surprised when you slip your hand under my shirt and turn away.

I ordered a single shot of espresso, the lady was quite confused when I said I would like a single shot and I assumed that people don't order espresso and only espresso based drink like cappuccino and etc.

I recieved my drink under a minute, why I am saying under is because I forgot to keep track of time so, I am assuming I got it under a minue (because I felt only a minute had passed, okay!) 

The main point, the experience of drinking... It was smokey like.... uh.. what I meant to say is that it kind of tasted like smoke, it was acidic (like 3/5 and I tasted this throughout the drink) and there was a bitter after taste as well, but while drinking it felt like zzzz in my tongue (if you get it then you get it) while tasting, acidic taste first and then bitter( like 2.5/5 bitterness).

 At first, It was acidic-bitter but then after a few more small sips the after taste was smokey and bitter and in front-part of tongue acidic taste, I can still feel the acidity (the saliva is still coming because of the smokey like acidic taste and that's the taste remaining after a few minutes).

Was it worth it? It was unique but, do I want to drink this coffee everyday? No! 

I discovered that I like hazelnut like taste in coffee.

Coffee aside, the price was also high, like I was charged something like 242 ‚Çπ at least it was better than the espresso I got from another caf√©, goddamn I still remember how watery-bitter.",5,1751444574.0,IndiaCoffee,13,0.86,False

Some kid outside was tapping the window, watching a barista make latte art, and I saw it in his face that same awe I used to have. The dream. The ‚Äúwow, this is what life will be like when I‚Äôm grown.‚Äù

And I wanted to tell him: kid, it‚Äôs mostly bills and caffeine-induced panic attacks. But I didn‚Äôt. Because let him have it. Let him hold onto the fantasy a little longer.

\*- a metal tamp (for the Stilosa/ECP 51mm or 51.3mm)   
\*- a WDT (Weiss distribution technique) tool - helps with the puck preparation, decreases clumps, and channeling  
\*- a fine sprayer bottle for RDT (Ross droplet technique) - removes static electricity during grinding, helps decrease coffee retention in the grinder - don't do it if your manual mentions not to do it  
\*- a small digital scale, preferably with a timer (which fits on the drain tray of the machine)  
\- a puck bucket/knock box  
\- a microfiber cloth (for cleaning the steam wand)  
\*- a zip tie to hold the rubber nozzle of the steam wand when you remove the metal tube ""Panarello"" (or whatever it's called), which is one of the better hacks for such a DeLonghi machine  
\- a smaller and a bigger milk pitcher with a pointed tip, for steaming the milk, and doing latte art  
\- a tamping mat (to protect your surface)  
\- a manual grinder like the KinGrinder P1, P2, K4, or K6 (to use till you get a stronger grinder and to have as a backup + for pour-over, French press, and some healthy manual exercise) - such manual grinders grind better and have more adjustment steps than most sub-200‚Ç¨ electric grinders. Burr grinders are way better than blade grinders.  
\- a dosing funnel which fits your portafilter (51mm for DeLonghi Stilosa, Dedica), to make less mess  
\*- a single cup and a double cup UNPRESSURIZED basket (51mm for DeLonghi ECP, Stilosa, etc)  
\- a bottomless portafilter (for the mentioned devices, two-ear 51mm)  
\*- a filter pitcher for your tap water, like a Britta, Maxfor, or similar - prevents limescale buildup, improves coffee taste, extraction, and consistency, helps with the device maintenance and longevity  
\- a puck screen (to help with water distribution and to help keep the machine clean), 51mm for the mentioned devices  
\- a small manual dust blower (like one for camera equipment, usually rubber) - helps with keeping the machine and grinder clean  
\- a small (magnetic) mirror to watch the shots  
\- small espresso cups, preferably double-walled glass, from 50 to 90 ml  
\- a wide coffee cup for making latte art coffee (latte, cappuccino, etc)  
\- coffee tasting spoons  
\- a digital food thermometer to check your temperatures from time to time  
\- ""Barista"" labeled milk alternatives (some of them foam better than regular milk or add some different flavors to the coffee)  
\- Allulose for sweetening if you like to drink sweet coffee drinks, alternatively, Erythritol or Xylitol.  
\- a container or box for the coffee beans, and freeze the beans if you're keeping them for more than a week  
Spend the rest on a grinder. And get freshly roasted coffee (if supermarket beans without a mentioned roast date, the roast date is usually the expiration date minus two years). Coffee beans are food-safe for many years if stored correctly, but they lose most of their CO2 in a matter of weeks after roasting.

18g of coffee beans, 36g of the drink, in about 30 seconds, is what one should aim for as a starting point.

Additional recommended tools for different coffee brewing:  
\- a Hario V60 or similar pour-over dripper  
\- Paper filters for the mentioned dripper  
\- a gooseneck kettle (easier water pouring)  
\- a French Press  
\- a Vietnamese Phin dripper  
\- a 3-cup to 6-cup Mokka pot  
\- an AeroPress  
\- a cheap milk frotting wand (but steam your milk using the espresso machine)  
\- a larger digital scale that can fit/measure a bigger cup or a French press, a dripper, etc  
\- coffee spices, cinnamon

Instead, I‚Äôm thinking of going with:

üëâ Royal Blend Nero (French Avenue ) ‚Äî which hits that boozy apple-cinnamon Khamrah vibe but supposedly smoother, more refined, and stronger performing.
+
üëâ A good French Coffee attar/roll-on (like Al Rehab or whatever‚Äôs strong) to layer when I‚Äôm in the mood for a deeper coffee gourmand vibe.

Basically, this setup lets me dial in either a dessert-rich boozy scent (Nero alone), or layer the French Coffee for something stronger than Qahwa ever did. The flexibility sounds better than being locked into two bottles that might overlap or underperform.

Question is ‚Äî do y‚Äôall think this is a legit upgrade, or am I just coping with a workaround?

üß† I‚Äôm not into hype-chasing or collecting for shelves. I want realistic versatility and power, not sugar bombs that fade in 2 hours.
