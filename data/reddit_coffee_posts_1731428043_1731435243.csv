>*Some Redditors whom I warmly thank have recommended that I post my calculations here. I know that many aspects deserve to be discussed, but I still wanted to share these results. Perhaps they will help complement your own work, or maybe one of you will find a way to advance them... Thank you anyway for your attention and kindness.*

Hello everyone,

For several years, I have been facing a dilemma that gnaws at me internally. Nothing too serious; I am doing perfectly well, but sometimes my thoughts unwittingly unearth an indescribable feeling: a mix of incompleteness and resignation. I thought long and hard before deciding to make this post out of fear of exposing myself, being misunderstood, or mocked like many people who are too interested in UAPs (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena)...

Nevertheless, I feel the need to share a discovery that I believe could prove important. Among you, there will undoubtedly be more skilled and inspired individuals who will know better than I how to make good use of it. I don’t know how you will receive my story; in any case, I sincerely hope that it will capture your attention and kindness.

Here’s how it all began,

Passionate about science since always, I managed to obtain a position as an engineer in a reputable and prestigious company. I was proud of it, even though the scientific aspect was unfortunately drowned in regulations and administration. Years went by... tedious projects were followed by soporific reports to the point that I would swear I had lived the life of a goldfish trapped in its bowl...

Anyway, one day in the summer of 2019, I joined my colleagues at the coffee machine (I know it sounds cliché) to find a semblance of social interaction. That day, the discussion seemed particularly lively. Indeed, my colleagues were commenting on a New York Times article stating that the Pentagon had authenticated a video (FLIR1) of a UAP that had leaked a little earlier.

At that time, I didn’t pay attention to these musings. Being a staunch advocate of critical thinking, I presumed it was a case of misunderstandings, misinformation, or hoaxes, and the story ended there due to a lack of tangible elements. However, this video intrigued me; it showed an object shaped like a Tic Tac, without wings, without propellers, no air intakes, no gas emissions, and yet it managed to keep a distance from an F18 Hornet...

Without saying a word, I watched the video over and over again... questions and speculations were flying from all sides:  
  \- Is it real? A weather balloon?  
  \- Could it be an unknown natural phenomenon? Artificial? Is it a hoax?  
  \- A prototype? How can it fly?  
  \- What navigation instruments does it use? How does it propel itself?  
  \- How does it steer? What was its trajectory?  
  \- What could be its energy source?  
  \- Why does the pilot maintain course while the object is out of sight???

But very quickly, curiosity faded, and discussions returned to trivial matters... except for me... the more I became interested in this case, the more it fascinated me. For my colleagues, it was ultimately just a curious and insignificant anecdote. The fact that this object contradicted years of studies did not seem to affect them in the least. For my part, the feeling was diametrically opposed, and I kept questioning this mystery that had occurred 15 years earlier. Then, due to a lack of time, family obligations, and fatigue, I turned away from it, telling myself that, in any case, other people much more competent, better placed, and experienced had probably already studied the phenomenon from all angles.

Shortly after the lockdown in France, I remember stumbling upon the documentary ""UFOs: A State Affair"" by Dominique FILHOL. I was astonished to see the former director of the DGSE, Alain JUILLET, express his perplexity regarding these phenomena, on which absolutely no information had apparently leaked in nearly 15 years!

This story was becoming increasingly strange. That same night, I revisited the few drafts I had scribbled here and there. I then remembered an idea, a ""trick"" that had germinated in my mind, but at the time it seemed ""too naive"" to be taken seriously. To put it simply:

*^(Think of your aluminum soda can. Consider for a moment those who designed it and the very first question  they must have asked: ""What dimensions offer an optimal volume for minimal aluminum cost?"")*

*^(Without going into details, mathematics allows us to find the precise solution that optimizes both aspects. You just need to set up an equation for volume and surface area based on the same parameters (R radius and x height-to-length ratio). If all goes well, you obtain an equation that can be studied to find an optimum corresponding to the ideal pair R and x.)*

*^(Well... in practice, other parameters come into play (logistics, aesthetics, packaging, coating, varnish, etc.), which significantly distances us from the original solution.)*

*^(Now imagine a future archaeologist who finds the remains of your can. They will be able to measure its dimensions and will perform the reverse reasoning to finally ascertain with certainty the optimization effort. Because there are a vast number of possibilities, but only one is optimized! Logically, they will conclude that this object was designed and produced by ingenious people.)*

And you see where this reasoning leads us: If the object is artificial, it is certain that its designers would have used their knowledge to maximize advantages while minimizing constraints—in a word: optimize. I emphasize that this is about searching for ""the trace of an optimization"" to confirm or refute the artificiality of the phenomenon. This approach does not claim to explain its technique or even less its origin. Assuming it is a hoax or a misunderstanding, there is very little chance of finding the trace of a ""fortuitous optimization.""

So I start by formulating the volumes and surfaces of each part of the Tic Tac. I compare them all in the same table. Once my work is finished, I find that nothing particular stands out, just convoluted formulas containing x and R but nothing truly conclusive. The premises of my reasoning thus lead to a dead end and a manifest absence of optimization of the fuselage. ""What a waste of time... and to think I missed an episode of The IT Crowd for this!"" Science has spoken... this approach yields absolutely no results.

... unless...

What if we introduced a value for one of the two parameters? We cannot give an accurate estimate of the radius, but we can provide an approximate estimate of x by taking the height-to-length ratio from the video. I measure and find about 0.4. I then revisit the table, replacing x with this value.

... and there, everything changes...

I remember feeling dizzy; I was astonished! ... I went over and over all the calculations... no mistakes. There was indeed a particular relationship appearing for the precise value of x = 0,4. Until now, my approach was purely motivated by scientific curiosity and a critical approach... I didn’t genuinely expect a robust result... But suddenly, without even realizing it, I found myself facing a result I could not ignore: ""The phenomenon is undeniably the result of a judicious design."" If, like me, this result intrigues you, you may not be ready for what comes next...

Remember, to optimize, you need a starting equation; well, this starting equation of the Tic Tac can be found, and here it is:

https://preview.redd.it/hs9tgkj1gi0e1.png?width=343&format=png&auto=webp&s=0846c3d24699d51c37d5a6fa7e70f1a70c2142d9

In concrete terms, it highlights a relationship between spherical and cylindrical surfaces and their respective volumes. This relationship disappears for any value of x other than 0,4. All calculations and demonstrations are, of course, available in the last part of this message so that everyone can access them freely and revisit them at leisure.

Has anyone noticed this before? To my knowledge, no; I was the only one to have discovered this result or at least the only one willing to talk about it and make it known. Later, I would learn that an article discussing the shape of bacteria also revealed a relationship between volume and surface, but ultimately nothing comparable. Other than that, nothing!

Well... Okay, I found this... it's interesting or at least quite curious... and now? ... What do I do? ... Who do I talk to now, if possible without coming off as crazy?

I’ll spare you my tribulations, but fortunately, SIGMA2 in France offered me the chance to present my work, which I was more than delighted and relieved about. The presentation went wonderfully; very competent and qualified people made constructive observations and critiques with varying degrees of reservations about the conclusions. Everyone agreed that the approach had a certain interest, and my caution was particularly appreciated.

The commission took good notes on my work but raised a significant problem that I had not anticipated: No radar recording = no investigation; it’s as simple as that, and it’s perfectly understandable. The catch is that the SCU is trying to obtain these recordings without success so far.

Since then, what has become of my work?

Well... to be honest... not much 😅...

I continued to study the previous results and made some additional advances (much more delicate to explain). Nevertheless, in terms of communication, it’s a void... Unfortunately, I have not managed to make them known much more. Yet, I regularly see journalists and others discussing this case, making all sorts of hypotheses but never mentioning this relationship... thinking about it, I feel like I’m living a 2.0 version of the Cassandra myth. And now, I dread seeing it gradually sink into oblivion when it seems to me to be an essential piece of the puzzle.

There you go; now you know everything there is to know in broad strokes. At least if you had the courage (or the madness) to read this scandalously long post! 😅

I look forward to reading your feedback. Thank you.

As promised, the demonstrations, reasoning, and calculations are all available below:

Let’s start by schematizing our Tic Tac:

https://preview.redd.it/uyc585g8gi0e1.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=51071f5d971c16e0e8a59daebe73daa8c28cae2d

The first step is to establish the formulas for the surfaces and volumes of each ""spherical"" or curved ""part."" It quickly becomes clear that 2 parameters (x: height-to-width ratio and R: radius) are sufficient to define the shape.

https://preview.redd.it/zxgphzdcgi0e1.png?width=692&format=png&auto=webp&s=07485a381a289a851aac238ca35364b379c9ecb8

The second consists of comparing them in a first table (with x and R undetermined). Nothing conclusive appears for the moment.

https://preview.redd.it/vgiex0rdgi0e1.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8cfabb907d0d9214da9fdfd874cbcba67c85d00

If we refer to the video, we can see that x is around 0,4.

https://preview.redd.it/nuz691efgi0e1.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=05b438cfc8ce2a4e3960f39afe40633ebb28fadf

Let's take our previous table again with x = 0,4 ; this time, everything changes :

https://preview.redd.it/2ac5981hgi0e1.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf8c544ad81a2d0a241c892df8541d983d3f52a2

For the sake of verification, let’s revisit the problem as a hypothetical designer would have approached it. That is to say, starting from a constraint formulated in an equation to arrive at the most advantageous solution for x:

https://preview.redd.it/jxt43chkgi0e1.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4de010bd961dbd384d214104eef8aa9157e9d4b

The hypothesis of an optimization is greatly supported, but can it still be a coincidence?

Let us now express compactness:

**In retrospect, I have a reservation about the use of compactness (C=1); it indeed allows for an estimation of R that aligns with the pilots' observations, but at the cost of 'heavy' implications that I will not elaborate on here.**

https://preview.redd.it/jb3nd09mgi0e1.png?width=869&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c5b2add798c276922ad5b6f23d98d8e75bc2e21

We can now complete our diagram with the optimal solutions:

https://preview.redd.it/ehjpbmsygi0e1.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=51989d9844c00ae8f92e90fedbc56ec7c7801c7b

We arrive at a 'predictive' length of approximatelyb 11,5m. As a reminder, the witness pilots estimated the length of the TIC TAC to be about 12m (40 ft).

Our little trick thus leads us to an optimal solution that is extremely close to the witnesses' estimates, which supports a 'wise' design. The highlighted relationship has undoubtedly served as the basis for this design.

The following diagram summarizes the pathways:

The story doesn't stop there, but the continuation becomes much more mathematical. However, this post is probably already far too long! But at least I now feel the relief and satisfaction of having shared and given these calculations a chance to live their own life.

1gpr7sl,https://www.reddit.com/r/widowers/comments/1gpr7sl/some_of_my_favorite_signs_from_him_lately/,Some of my favorite signs from him lately,"I keep track of all the   signs  he sends me, I don’t know how to explain when I know it’s a sign but it just is. I hope we all get as many signs as possible, and I hope I don’t offend anyone - these are just my beliefs that our loved ones try to show us they still love us and are around - but in no way trying to push that. No pressure if your beliefs differ, if you like signs this is for you!

I was thinking about two of my favorite ones lately that happened.

1) Coffee shop music sign:

After he passed, I went back to our favorite coffee shop, and I heard a song playing and it sounded ridiculously like one he would like. He was a musician and loved ‘’math rock” a genre of music I’ve never heard of before I only knew it cus of him. It is like alternative instrumental obscure rock, not sure how to put it. His favorite band was Chon. I asked the barista what they were listening to, and they go “have you ever heard of math rock”, I laughed and said yeah, he said this band is similar to Chon if I’ve ever heard of them, but this is called Elephant Gym. It made me smile, when I went home I checked YouTube - the last band he put on our last weekend together was Elephant Gym, and I swear the song had almost no likes and was very unpopular, same song from the coffee shop.

So anyway, every single time I’m there things like that happen with music and I totally can feel it’s him. Last week I went to grab coffee, and the line has like 20 people which never happens and I normally am too impatient to wait for that. Something told me to go on line so I did. After fifteen minutes on the line - listening to a 90s rock queue today - suddenly a live version of the 1960s September in the Rain by Dinah Washington comes on. “The leaves are brown” opening line had become an inside joke in March of this year between me and him and we listened to that version a ton that month. I started crying cus it was so strange, the barista didn’t know how it came I’m queue even.

2) My last dream visit

I am grateful but have had dream visits with him since he passed. Sometimes my dreams are just processing dreams, but I swear some are vivid visits that feel more real than life.

Last month, someone told me someone had come to surprise me in a dream so I turned around and it was him. We both got so excited to see each other we both cried and hugged immediately and it was like not a minute has passed. I immediately kept telling him how much I love him and miss him like I always do when I see him in a dream. He looked so beautiful and was just elated to get to meet up. 
He kept telling me the time and I didn’t quite get why but he kept insisting I needed to know it was 419am he kept saying even though the dream feels longer, when I wake only a minute will have passed and it’ll be proof that he is really here and this isn’t simply a dream. I woke up after, checked my phone, and it was 420am, I had chills and smiled cus I knew I was just with him and I’m not  crazy.

Anyway; for those who believe in signs I hope these made you smile. Sending so much love to anyone in this group, even when it doesn’t feel like it many days…each of us are loved cus our people still love us, I truly feel that in my soul.

There is however an event that I want to have some beers at. Antabuse is great, and I'm not planning to quit using it, but being able to have one night off a few times a year would be the best of both worlds.

Alcohol just not being an option for more than a week after I take it has honestly cured me of any compulsion or obsessive thinking. I wish I could have a beer after a stressfull day at work with too many coffees, sure. But It's not an option, and so I move on. There are no real cravings. 

It's an insane and stupid thing for an alcoholic to do, but as long as I start up the medication again the next day I won't have an issue staying sober. I've also don't really have a problem controlling my intake at work events and the like. My issue was always drinking alone. 

The event is next thursday, and I took my last dose yesterday. I am playing with the idea of testing one beer the night before just to see if there's a reaction. Honestly the antabus/alcohol reaction scares me. Which is exactly why the medication works so well I guess.

I went through 10 therapists. Some made me very uncomfortable. Others I didn't feel comfortable talking to. One was okay but I didn't respond as good to their methods.

A month ago I started seeing my current therapist and found they were way better and easier to talk to. I opened up a little in the first two sessions but the last one is where I felt comfortable enough to open up. And I ended up breaking down and saying I didn't feel like I belonged anywhere.

I explained that I feel like an only child even though my mom has four other kids and my dad has two other kids. That being the half to them and from the second marriage that came after their other parents died meant I felt like they never wanted or accepted me. How being born into an already divided household where neither side truly wanted me left me feeling displaced. I talked about how being more ignored by extended families who chose the kids they loved (my moms older kids and dads older kids) over the kid who came later. That I knew they felt like they had to choose and they chose the grandkids they had already bonded with over the new baby who came along years later. I expressed that my half siblings not living with me for a big part of my life didn't change how it felt because knowing they stayed in touch with our shared parent but had no interest in contact with me was tough. And knowing they never ""came home"" because they didn't want to interact with me was difficult. And I know it was me because there were times I was home with just our shared parent and my other parent was away or gone for several hours and they wouldn't visit. So they weren't avoiding my other parent. But coffee days and stuff with the shared parent were common so it wasn't a lack of relationship there either. And they only visited extended family before or after my parents and I would leave. I said I picked up on this stuff and felt like there were so many sides none of them wanted me. And that I had loving parents but they also had families who didn't really want me. I also know they were in town around some of my birthdays but never came to see me or joined in for birthday dinners my parents would host.

My therapist was concerned about how low I felt and called my parents in for an emergency session the next day and shared a lot of this with them which... I didn't like, honestly. It made my parents angry at me because they feel like I'm talking nonsense and they say I don't engage enough to feel included. But the reason I don't engage is because I have years of experiences that make me see no point in it. They didn't want to hear it and they felt like I was ungrateful for the ""amazing family"" I have.

My dad is basically the only one who pays the bills working as a truck driver

Since he works a lot and that my stepmom doesnt show any respect for him, he doesnt sleep with her and she own the 2 buggest room in the house for her bedroom and deskroom so he sleeps in a small room that serves as a storage unit for all the stuff stepmom cannot put elsewhere, other exemple inclued being rude to him, insulting him etc

I am very gratefull for what my dad has done by letting me live here rent free so i try to take on his side of the chores whenever he is at home

Ill clean the table after him ask if he wants any dessert bring him and help him whenever he needs smt

Anyway the main problem was that Yesterday he was gonna go for work at 1am wich his the time i go sleep so i decided to prepare him breakfast 
I toasted some bread and made coffee

Anyway today stepmom was pissed and i can hear her talking shit behind my back as always this time she is really mad at me because i made breakfast

Father didnt eat anything i made and put it in the fridge and stepmom think im a psycho, that im taking the role of wife, that im ""fucking sick"" and that she is gonna explode at me at some point

Me, the one person who doesn't yell at you when you get confused and agitated. The one who has regularly talked you down when you're flinging wild accusations about others. The one who you trusted with your life once, to the point that you gave me POA/Rep 9 over my much older siblings. If I were even remotely interested in stealing from you, I'd start with the bank accounts and credit card that I am in full control of...not your fucking remote or nail clippers!!!

Look, Redditors...I know what this is. I work in Healthcare and specifically with dementia patients. I know that MY dad...the man who spent years bridging the divide between us....is horrified at the way he's been treating me. There are times he comes back to baseline and I get a tearful apology. We have a week or so of near normal interactions, then all of a sudden I go to pick him up for lunch and he's pissed off at me because I ""stole"" something utterly useless to me. 

Despite my education, it is wearing me down. It was a lot easier when it was my sister always in the hot seat, to be honest. That was the relationship they had before dementia, so it was par for the course that he would be contentious with her. I can let it roll off my back when it's my clients getting snarky with me because of whatever their brains are telling them. I can let it roll off my back when Dad is accusing others of nonsense....but now that his mistrust has landed on me, I'm distraught. We spent several years prior to the onset of his dementia putting the past behind us and developing a close relationship. I need to keep those memories firmly in the front seat, because this suspicious and delusional person is not the same one who made a point of coming to have coffee with me every Sunday morning, just 3 short years ago. Lately, the coffee and lunch dates leave me in tears more often than not..but never in front of him.

I just needed to blow off steam in a place where people get it. I know why it is happening and mostly I can take it in stride thanks to my job....but damn!

I decided I'd get some blood lancets to prick blood and give it to her, and I waited until nighttime until I talked to her since I felt she wanted that.


I had put on her enn chant, made her some coffee, and dripped my blood into the coffee.

I lay down, and I can actively feel her presence in the room.
It's terrifying. 

I accept that maybe I'm not ready to work with her, and essentially closed the ritual.


I go to sleep like any other day, and the next morning, my dad tells me about this icky dream he had. (He didn't know about me working with Lilith or anything)

For starters, me and my dad's relationship is pretty rocky, as he's shown as porn at a young age, and been very neglectful to the point my grandma called CPS on him. (That time it didn't happen, but it did happen later and I went to foster care)

So I can't say I really feel bad for him.

1gpqu4j,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucksbaristas/comments/1gpqu4j/actually_got_this_as_a_survey_response_from_a/,Actually got this as a survey response from a customer today,"Dear District Manager,

I recently had the *unique* experience of visiting one of your stores, and I am writing to express my... well, let's just call it “bewilderment.”

My visit started innocently enough. I ordered my usual coffee, sat down to enjoy it, and was just starting to unwind when the store manager suddenly whipped out the world’s loudest roll of packing tape and proceeded to go absolutely berserk. The entire cafe was filled with the deafening, screeching sound of tape being slapped onto every conceivable surface like she was trying to perform an exorcism on the espresso machine.

Just as I was processing this symphony of chaos, a barista decided to escalate the madness by pulling out a full-sized vacuum cleaner. She then proceeded to vacuum actual, *literal* espresso beans off the counter with the kind of intensity you’d expect from someone who’s trying to cleanse the carpet of a haunted house.

If that wasn’t enough, a random customer, for reasons beyond my comprehension, started asking one of the baristas probing questions about her personal life — specifically, how many kids she wanted. The barista, bless her heart, politely declined to answer, leaving the customer visibly annoyed. I can’t say I blame the barista. I mean, is “family planning advice” now on the Starbucks menu alongside Pumpkin Spice Lattes?

And then, as if on cue, a lady burst into the store like a character from a soap opera, screaming at the manager. The poor manager tried to deflect by wailing, “I’m just a girl!” before dissolving into tears. Honestly, I felt like I had front-row seats to a drama that even Netflix couldn’t script.

But the plot thickened. At one point, I noticed there was *peanut butter* smeared all over the floor, attracting flies like it was a buffet for insects. Apparently, this was a regular feature, because as I soon learned, the manager’s *personal drug dealer* makes daily appearances to keep things interesting. I didn’t know peanut butter, flies, and illegal substances were Starbucks’ new decor aesthetic, but hey, who am I to question corporate branding?

Things took a truly wild turn when I killed an actual fly with my bare hands, only to have the manager approach me and say, “Please don’t kill the other flies — the customers might start noticing them.” Excuse me? Was I not supposed to notice the flies? Or was this some advanced form of customer service where the bugs are treated like loyal patrons?

Despite my fly-killing heroics, I received no gratitude from the manager. She didn’t thank me for sparing other customers from the relentless buzzing, nor did she acknowledge the several other flies I discreetly eliminated on her behalf. Instead, she reprimanded me for being “aggressive,” which, considering I was only defending myself from an insect invasion, seemed uncalled for.

To add insult to injury, she had the audacity to ask if I’d brought any “weapons” into the store, implying that my trusty pocket knife, which I leave in the car due to Starbucks’ “liberal no-weapons policy,” was somehow responsible for the chaos. And yet, *she* was the one brandishing a massive garden hose out of nowhere, demanding to know if I “felt threatened.” District Manager, I ask you: who brings a hose to a coffee shop? And why does she just *have* a hose? These are questions that haunt me.

The whole ordeal ended with her making a baseless assumption about my affinity for Sriracha sauce — a fact she assumed as casually as she assumed my pronouns. I’m not sure what’s more unsettling: her wild presumptions or the bizarre belief that she can accurately judge condiment preferences by sight.

At this point, I’m not sure if I visited a Starbucks or if I accidentally wandered onto the set of a surreal indie film. All I know is that whatever is going on in that store needs a serious intervention — preferably one involving a vacuum specialist, a fly whisperer, and possibly a therapist.

Let me start by saying this is my last baby - my rainbow baby. Sometimes I really miss the activities I enjoyed pre baby like going to the gym, getting my nails & hair done and feeling good in my skin. I loved soaking in the bath for an hour + as a way to de stress! I miss working my 12 hour shifts at the hospital, everything from the shitty coffee to the interactions with patients/coworkers. When I miss all these things it makes me a bit sour and then feel guilty because those things don’t align with the kind of mom I want to be. Our baby is the most VELCRO baby in all the lands !! We baby wear, co sleep that has now turned into chest sleeping.. for naps & night time sleep. Baby is also EBF and has never taken a bottle. The kind of mom I want to be is this one right here, that I am… but that mom doesn’t align with the woman I was/ am and the things I miss. 

I don’t want daycare, I don’t want to pay for that either. There isn’t anything that I miss previously that trumps being present every day. 

I can’t imagine not seeing my baby for 12 hour shifts…

It’s important to me to breastfeed and there’s no “need” for a bottle.. it’s a special bond and something only we can do.

Bed feels lonely without baby in it! 

So as you can imagine it’s a rather conflicting emotion to experience, I don’t want anyone to offer solutions of bottles and daycare, I just want someone to recognize it’s possible and common to feel this way . Those things aren’t going anywhere but these precious moments are temporary! Sometimes I just miss ME things.",1,1731433915.0,AttachmentParenting,2,1.0,False

1gpqosv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gpqosv,Mìele G7310 Dishwasher - A spaceship... if only it also were a dishwasher!,"Hello everyone,
I recently bought a second hand Mìele G7310 dishwasher from Facebook Marketplace. With it being only 200€ and 4 years old I knew it had to be mine.
I already had experience with a Mìele G5500SC and a G5830SCU model which both worked brilliantly. My main dishwasher is a Serie 6 Bosch built in 2021
I also quite like dishwashers and have owned/resold at least 8 of them in the past year or so. The oldest one I own is a REX (ZANUSSI) IP760N from 1993

A couple of things to consider beforehand:
1. I NEVER rinse the dishes before loading the dishwasher. I'll typically use a spatula or a paper towel to remove solid residues and large amounts of sauce, then everything goes into the machine. It's called a dishWASHER, NOT a dishRINSER!
2. I tend to alternate different brands of detergent such as Somat (Pril in Italy), Svelto (P&G product), Fairy/Jar but all in tabs form. I do not like liquids as they can't remove tomato sauce/tea/coffee stains since their formulation does not contain any bleaching agents. I have also used Mìele's own PowerDisk in some tests
3. I will typically run long cycles, not short ones, as the machine usually runs overnight
4. I load the dishwasher quite a bit but making sure water can reach all the dishes

With this being said, I think this is the worst performing dishwasher I have ever used.

QuickPowerWash simply splashes tomato sauce and various residues on expresso cups
PowerWash does the same, albeit taking much longer (2h30) and using 23L of water + 1.4kWh of energy. For reference, this is how much water and energy my REX IP760N from 1993 uses, yet the latter washes perfectly
Auto washes decently, but runs for a long time (3 hours). Still, espresso cups on the shelf can't seem to come out clean
I have yet to try the ""Extra Clean"" option and Intensive, ECO, Glassware and Hygiene cycles

Thing is, the machine is VERY inconsistent with its wash results, so I have tried adding a 2nd interim rinse, with poor results. It can't remove stuck on pasta on a pot with a 2h+ cycle and it sometimes leaves residue on dishes
However, when it washes, it washes well
I think it's all down to poor programming and poor spray arms design: the upper spray arm can't reach the corners of the basket and the lower one runs for only 20 seconds at a time. Then, the machine switches to the center spray arm for 40 seconds, then upper for 20, and so on. Why? Dirtiest items are in the bottom basket, they require the most attention

Anyone with a G7XXX dishwasher having the same problems as me? Maybe I'm at fault, but all other machines I have used coped well with this type of soiling.

When entering programming mode I noticed I can set a country variant: mine is set to EU1, but EU2, JPN, CN, AUS and USA are other possible choices. Maybe I can set it to EU2 and it will wash better? Don't know, can someone explain to me what these settings do?

First, let's break down what we're actually working with here. Wood stain isn't just colored liquid - it's a carefully balanced formula:

**Basic Components:**

* *Solvent* (the liquid carrier that penetrates the wood)
* *Pigment* (the colorful stuff that makes the magic happen)
* *Binder* (the glue that keeps everything where it should be)

# The Chemistry Behind It All

*Here's something most people don't realize:* Wood stain is actually a colloidal suspension, meaning those tiny pigment particles are constantly fighting gravity, trying to settle at the bottom of the can. This is why we get that lovely ""shake well before use"" reminder that we all totally follow... right? 😏

# Common Reasons for Thicker Wood Stain: The Complete Breakdown 🔍

# 1. Environmental Factors

Let me share this handy reference table I've put together from my experiences:

|Environmental Condition|Effect on Stain|Solution|
|:-|:-|:-|
|High Humidity (>60%)|Increases thickness|Work in climate-controlled space|
|Low Temperature (<50°F)|Makes stain viscous|Warm stain to room temperature|
|Direct Sunlight|Causes premature thickening|Store in cool, dark place|
|Temperature Fluctuations|Creates inconsistent texture|Maintain stable storage conditions|

*Personal Disaster Story #1:* Last summer, I was working on a client's custom bookshelf during a week-long humidity spike (90%+ humidity). My normally reliable oil-based stain turned into something resembling maple syrup. The project took three days longer than quoted because I had to thin and reapply the stain multiple times. My biggest learning? Always check the weather forecast before scheduling staining work!

# 2. Types of Stain: Not All Stains Are Created Equal

**Gel Stains vs. Traditional Liquid Stains: A Detailed Comparison**

*Gel Stains:*

* Naturally thicker consistency
* Better for vertical surfaces
* More forgiving on blotch-prone woods
* Excellent for getting consistent color on pine
* Requires different application techniques

*Traditional Liquid Stains:*

* Should flow like water
* Better penetration
* Easier to apply evenly
* More affected by environmental conditions
* Requires careful surface preparation

*Personal Disaster Story #2:* Here's a fun one - I once grabbed what I thought was my regular liquid stain for a maple dining table project. Halfway through, I realized I'd accidentally used a gel stain. The thickness difference was dramatic, but surprisingly, it saved me from the blotching that maple is notorious for. Sometimes mistakes lead to discoveries!

# 3. Storage and Aging: The Silent Stain Killer

**Common Storage Mistakes and Their Effects:**

1. *Temperature Extremes:*
   * Hot temperatures can evaporate solvents
   * Cold can cause pigment separation
   * Fluctuations affect chemical stability
2. *Air Exposure:*
   * Oxidation changes composition
   * Evaporation concentrates pigments
   * Can create skin on surface
3. *Container Position:*
   * Horizontal storage causes uneven settling
   * Partial cans are more vulnerable to problems
   * Lid seal quality matters more than you think

*Personal Disaster Story #3:* Found an ""amazing deal"" on high-end stain at a garage sale. Thought I'd struck gold until I opened it - the previous owner had stored it in their unheated garage through multiple Minnesota winters. The stain had separated into distinct layers and had the consistency of cold peanut butter. Lesson learned: sometimes a deal isn't really a deal.

# Troubleshooting Thick Stain: The Complete Guide

When you find yourself with thick stain, here's my tested process:

**Step-by-Step Rescue Protocol:**

1. *Assessment Phase:*
   * Check stain age
   * Evaluate consistency
   * Test small amount on scrap wood
2. \*Thinning Process:\*Start with: - 1 cup original stain - 1/4 cup appropriate thinner - Stir thoroughly - Test - Repeat if needed
3. *Testing Protocol:*
   * Use similar wood species
   * Apply in same temperature
   * Wait full dry time
   * Compare color depth

*Pro Tip:* I keep a ""stain diary"" with dates, conditions, and results. Sounds nerdy, but it's saved me countless hours of troubleshooting!

# Impact on Final Results: The Truth About Thick Stain

# The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly

**Potential Issues:**

* Uneven absorption patterns
* Extended drying time
* Surface tackiness
* Color inconsistency
* Difficult brush cleanup

*Personal Disaster Story #4:* The cherry bookshelf incident of 2022 still haunts me. Used thick stain thinking it would give better coverage. Result? A tacky surface that attracted every dust particle in a 5-mile radius. Had to strip and refinish the entire piece. 40 hours of work down the drain! 😭

# Advanced Tips for Success

**My Secret Weapons:**

1. *Temperature Control:*
   * Keep stain at 70°F (21°C)
   * Use thermometer in workshop
   * Pre-warm cold stain in water bath
2. *Application Techniques:*
   * Use foam brushes for thick stain
   * Work in sections
   * Maintain wet edge
   * Wipe consistently
3. *Quality Control:*
   * Make sample boards
   * Document conditions
   * Take progress photos

# Conclusion: Lessons Learned

After 15 years of woodworking and countless projects, I've learned that understanding wood stain consistency is as much art as science. The key is prevention, preparation, and patience.

**Key Takeaways:**

* Store stain properly
* Check consistency before starting
* Document everything
* Always have thinner on hand
* Make test boards

*Final Personal Note:* That antique oak table? After properly thinning the stain and taking my time, it turned out beautifully. Grandmother cried when she saw it (happy tears!). Sometimes our biggest challenges lead to our proudest moments.

**Product Recommendations from Personal Experience:**

* Best Overall: Minwax Oil-Based Penetrating Stain
* Best Gel Stain: General Finishes Java Gel
* Best Water-Based: Varathane Premium
* Best for Beginners: Old Masters Wiping Stain

She wasn’t on the app very much so I’d only get a reply every few days. Last Thursday, asked her if she’d wanna go to coffee over the weekend, said she was busy but could go sometime after work this week or next (this weekend), and then gave me her phone number and said “I’m not on here much”.

So I’ve been texting her since Friday, and started setting up a date with her yesterday.

I asked if she was available tonight and she said yes. I found a coffee shop and said it appears to be open until 9 according to Google, but there website says until 5, so I’d have call and confirm, and then said if you’re cool with that does tomorrow (tonight) at 6 work for you?

She said “yeah I’m good w that!”

I replied with “Sweet! I called and they are open until 9 so I will plan on seeing you there at 6!” and then said “I look forward to meeting you in person :)”

That was last night at 5:10 and I haven’t heard anything since. Should I assume we are still on? Do I need to message anything today confirming?",1,1731433707.0,dating_advice,5,1.0,False

1gpqjcp,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1gpqjcp/my_kind_of_boss_passed_away_unexpectedly_last/,My (kind of) boss passed away unexpectedly last night,"I work in a bookshop cafe. She was the big boss for the bookstore. We knew each other for roughly ten years. Many people were close to her and thought of her like their mom or aunt. I never got to be close to her as we technically didn't work together. When I try to think back about what I know about her it was all food related: 

How she liked to have a daily oatmeal cookie, how she always had a coffee in hand, that she had her own special off menu grilled cheese...

I feel weirdly angry at myself for not knowing her better despite all the years. 

I'm also angry about the entire situation. It started around lunch time on Sunday. We in the cafe were busy so we didn't even know anything was wrong until a firetruck pulled up. A few of us would stop and chat a moment about what we think was happening. Of course we were concerned but we were busy and this kind of thing would happen every once and a while. My manager was working that day and decided to go check on the situation. I had two glasses in my hand when I found out it was Helen.

Helen is around my mom's age. My mom has been having some health problems herself and I'm always very much on edge. The moment I heard that Helen had a fall, every single anxiety what if flooded my mind. But I'm a server, it wasn't as if I could exactly stop working. Someone took the water out for me and I had to go compose myself. Had to pretend that everything was okay. We all decided to close down early, but with meals in different states of being prepared, we also couldnt exactly kick people out. So for roughly an hour I had to keep pretending like everything was okay and to help guide customers out of the building. Some figured out what was going on and were so sweet, trying to get out of there as fast as possible.

I also found out later that on the bookstore side of things, people were still demanding to pay for their items while all of those who were working were having a bit of a crisis. There were also the people outside, who would try wrenching open the doors we locked, realize it wouldn't open, stare  through the windows at us as they went to the other door and wrench on that one as well. None of them would bother to read the signs on the doors saying we had to close early. Towards the end of the hour, we started handing out free baked goods to people to try and get them to leave because a few just continued to sit and chat like everything was fine. One of my tables in particular didn't even realize there was anything wrong. This was after the firetruck and ambulance were in the parking lot, after the announcement over the intercom saying we had to close down early, after 3/4 of the cafe area was already emptied out. I know that these people weren't in crisis but I was so uncomfortable. 

It led me to think about death and how life just...keeps on happening. It's still something I need to talk about with someone but I don't know how to breach such a macabre topic.

Sunday evening, no one heard any news. Many of us joined a large group chat both to help one another from spiralling and to find out any news. We wouldn't hear anything until Monday Morning. 

That morning, someone decided to call the hospital. Helen was in the ICU but they wouldn't discuss anything else over the phone. Two people went to the hospital directly to see if we could find out anything. At the time, we were still hopeful. There were visiting hours for her room and as long as people went 2 at a time, we could go see her. Except that wasnt actually the case. Around noon we were all informed that she likely wouldnt make it, and were blocked off from saying goodbye. Seven pm we were informed she was officially gone. 

I keep going through these states of normalcy, then numbness, then crying, and then just back to normalcy again. I'm a university student and while I'm lucky enough that this was our reading week, I still have a lot of schoolwork I need to catch up on. I don't feel like I really have the time to grieve. But the moment I'm concentrating on something else, the fact that I will never see her again comes back into my mind. ",1,1731433446.0,GriefSupport,0,1.0,False

How is your morning going, and how are you today?  I hope your morning is going great and you're feeling amazing 😊🩵🥰 Did you enjoy your coffee?  I enjoyed ... Too much coffee this morning.  But I'm a week without a pop as of today!  

Currently, I'm sitting at where I, in theory, have an eye appointment...turns out the hour call I made to sooner care a few days ago didn't do what they said and restored my coverage, but I take blame for that, as I didn't follow up.  Slowly moving up the que list but somehow wait time keeps slowing increasing too...

Anyway, that aside, I got off work about 90 minutes ago. What are you doing with the rest of your day following work?  I've got volunteering at From the Ashes tonight, and still have music, Lovely Melody, evening devotional time...I'm not sure how long I'll be here at the optometrist (might be a minute) so my day may be fuller than I expected.  But that's a lesson in patience, and God said I needed that, so I hum my and semi-embarrassingly sit here...

And be as patient as I can (and it would really suck to be having a mild grade nicotine fit while I'm sitting here, and not have my vape...which I don't need because I AM quitting) but that's a humorous hypothetical that's something for us to laugh at because it's ... 'hypothetical' (laugh with me).

But I digress...more seriously and happily, we are 103 DAYS CLEAN today, My Love!  I'm forever thankful to God, our Family, and You for this and all I've accomplished!  🩵💛🩷

I promise to be clean today, I promise to be clean tomorrow, and I promise to be clean EVERY DAY; FOREVER 😊 and I promise this today, I promise this tomorrow, and I promise this EVERY DAY, FOREVER, too.  

Update...rescheduled my eye appointment for Thursday morning while I continue to be on hold with Sooner Care...

It was a tough place to visit regularly though — they charged a $1 ’convienence fee’ for the convenience of ordering online, but were pretty slow for in-person orders — so it was tough to count on them for the ‘quick break between meetings’ concept too.

1gpqi0y,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1gpqi0y/i_reversed_my_20_years_of_peid_ama/,I reversed my 20+ years of PEID (AMA),"I have been struggling with PEID for 20+ years (I am 50), and it has gotten terrible in the last 10 years. For the past 5 years, I have tried everything from medications and supplements, going to therapy, seeing a psychologist, Medicinal Mushrooms, and, of course, NoFap. NoFap slowly worked after about 3 months, and I would always relapse and then go back to ground zero. Even when NoFap worked, it was sporadic. Some days were perfect, and other days, nothing.

I'm no scientist, but I STRONGLY believe (through my testing) PEID is both psychological (due to excessive porn) and physical due to the lack of needed minerals in our food (USA) on top of using what little minerals we have by fapping consistently.

\------------------------------

**TTYL:** Taking Shilajit + NoFap solved my PEID fully in 3-4 weeks after 20 years of struggle.

(Note: I also take an all-natural multivitamin, Vitamin D (per my doctor), medicinal mushrooms, and Nitric Oxide Supplement. While these have helped my overall health, they did not solve my PEID).

\------------------------------

I learned about Shilajit on TikTok but had never heard of it before. I brought the Shilajit Resin (Black/Brown Tar) from the TikTok Shop and started mixing it in my coffee each morning to test it. After about a week, I saw positive results. I then placed the resin under my tongue thrice daily and mixed the leftover resin into my coffee or tea while the rest sat under my tongue.

They say there is no difference between mixing it in coffee or tea and taking it under your tongue. However, in my experience, taking it under my tongue instead of mixing it in coffee or tea supercharged the effects. I still mix the residue on the spoon into my coffee and tea.

# Daily Routine:

**Morning**: I place Shilajit under my tongue while I make my coffee. Once the coffee is done, I add the leftover resin from the spoon, swallow what is in my mouth, and drink my coffee.

**Afternoon**: I place Shilajit under my tongue while I make Medicinal Mushroom tea. Once the tea is done, I add the leftover resin from the spoon, swallow what is in my mouth, and drink my tea.

**Night**: I place Shilajit under my tongue while making nighttime tea. Once the tea is done, I add the leftover resin from the spoon, swallow what is in my mouth, and drink my tea.

I have relapsed since I started the process but found if I keep taking the Shilajit consistently, I bounce back in 48 - 72 hours, even if I relapsed for two weeks straight. I am still pushing forward with NoFap, but not having PEID makes the process much more manageable!

I haven't tried any Shilajit gummies or pills and don't plan to since the resin is working perfectly.

# Benefits of Shilajit:

1. **Boosts Energy and Stamina**: Shilajit may enhance mitochondrial function, leading to increased energy levels and reduced fatigue. \~Dr. Axe
2. **Enhances Testosterone Levels**: Regular consumption of shilajit has been associated with increased testosterone levels in men, potentially improving libido and overall vitality. \~Healthline
3. **Supports Cognitive Function**: The fulvic acid in shilajit possesses antioxidant properties that may protect brain cells and improve cognitive function. \~Medical News Today
4. **Promotes Heart Health**: Shilajit's antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties may support cardiovascular health by reducing cholesterol levels and improving blood circulation. \~PureJIT
5. **Strengthens Immunity**: Rich in minerals and fulvic acid, shilajit can boost the immune system, helping the body fight off infections and illnesses more effectively. \~PureJIT
6. **Supports Healthy Aging**: The antioxidant fulvic acid in shilajit may protect against cellular damage, potentially slowing the aging process and promoting longevity. \~Healthline
7. **Aids in Nutrient Absorption**: Shilajit may enhance the absorption of essential nutrients, improving overall health and vitality. \~PureJIT
8. **Enhances Athletic Performance**: By improving endurance and reducing recovery time, shilajit can be beneficial for athletes and those with active lifestyles. \~PureJIT

Am I now being too controlling?,"I (29F) was cheated on by my partner (34m) when we spent a year long-distance (we’ve been together for five years; I got a research grant to do graduate work abroad in 2022/2023 when this happened).  This isn’t really what the post is about. We made things work, sought out therapy, and decided to stay together- its been really healthy.  I know reddit can be conservative about making a relationship work after infidelity, but my partner and I have built back trust in each other. Happy to explain further in the comments if people want more info. I’m also happy to explain how my partner knows this woman (essentially an estranged friend from college going through a divorce).  
  
The person my boyfriend cheated on me with (let’s call her Morgan) didn’t handle the breakup well (they had been intimate for about 1 month and she was FULLY aware he was in a relationship with me). He broke off ties with her when he visited me abroad and he admitted his infidelity. He then met up with her to explain the situation and why he needed space from her for my sake. He apologized for putting her through this. She was pretty pissed- I think she expected that he’d break up with me and start dating her, which is fair. I’d be pissed if I was her too; break ups suck. But then she took it a bit further. 

One week, she told him she was going to slash his tires (she didn’t), then the next when his mom was in critical condition at a hospital, she texted him that she was going to visit his mom and asked if he and his brother wanted a ride (she didn’t end up visiting their mom), she started hitting up his twin brother a TON- inviting him to stuff etc, also texting his mom so much that his mom had to stop replying. my partner then started getting atypical spam (church of scientology, random religious groups, a bunch of listservs etc., TONS of phone calls) and he thought it could be Morgan’s doing as she had mentioned doing this to her ex once to him. I mean, at first, this felt like good revenge on her end. Whatever; its just annoying but you’re allowed to be messy if youre hurt. Then, it just kept going further. After a couple of months she started reaching out to his/our friends (she had met them at like 1 or 2 parties, so these are new friends for her and mostly graduate students in my specific program). My partner was getting invited to picnics where she was also invited, so he proactively went around to our friends explaining how messy this scenario was and that he messed up, but he also needed space from this woman. 

She then moved to our town (she originally lived in a city 1 hour away) to be closer to community. And I eventually returned from my research year. 

When I got back, I noticed that my group of friends started inviting Morgan to our typical low-key friend events: bonfires, house hangs, movie trios. I thought it was weird, and it made me sad. I also couldn’t predict when she was invited and I felt blind sided. Mostly, just one friend did this. Let’s call her Linda. Linda and Morgan shared a same temu-vintage fashion vibe. I realized that Linda was interested in inviting  Morgan to everything, even after my partner had explained he needed space the very first time she invited Morgan to an event.  
  
I got pretty emotional. I wanted a space where I could shit talk Morgan, and it not get back to her. And I sort of felt like she needed a space where she could shit talk me too and it wouldn’t get back to me.  At this point, I was seeing Morgan out a lot, which is fine. But she started making a point of always standing next to me at bars? Like I went out with some friends to a local bar to listen to live music, and she’d just come right up to me and dance/listen along next to me which struck me as a little odd/confrontational, but I’d just leave. Anyway, I had NO interest in building a friendship with her, because it would bring up bad memories for me. So I went around to Linda and my other friends and explained I needed space from her. (I grew up in an Irish catholic context  \[now an atheist\] and am NOT good at explaining how I feel so this felt really hard for me and I cried a lot). I also explained that it’s cool to be new friends with her, shes a human who needs love too, but that I’d appreciate it if they also realized how awkward it is for me and maybe not invite her to group stuff, but just grab occasional coffee with her or whatever. I guess I was asking for them to be closer friends with me, but maintain a looser friendship with her. Idk. It felt like it made sense because they only just met her and we’d been friends for years. I met up with people 1 on 1, texted a bunch of people explaining everything that went down, and felt needy as heck. 

 Eventually, Linda stopped extending invites to me. I chatted to her about how  upset I was when people were including Morgan, because it made it a really unhealthy environment for me. She listened and said empathetic things, but the next week she had a birthday party and invited all of our mutual friends and Morgan, and didn’t extend the invite to me or my partner. I felt like I had communicated my pain to Linda the week before, but also realized she can make her own choices, so I started distancing myself from this friend. I felt like I had set a boundary she agreed upon, but then violated it- so I irish exited. But it hurt, for sure.  
  
At the same time, some friends \*did\* listen to me and dropped super close ties with this woman. A close friend of mine (another graduate student in my program) explained that Morgan hit him up recently and he’d gone on a few dates with her, but didn’t realize how bad the situation was and did decide not to pursue things with her. He also noticed how toxic it would be to date my partner’s ex. 

Well, Morgan was obviously getting angry about the few friends who started not inviting to to hangs every week. She ended up somehow finding my work email online. I guess its not hard to do. I had blocked her from social media because I hated when she’d pop up on my friends feed, so this was the only way for her to chat with me. She also found my partner’s email which is ridiculously private and I have \*no\* idea how she’d get it, because they’d had no email exchanges.  
  
Her email is addressed to me and to my partner and consists of her complaining that I needed to stop hurting her and isolating her from our mutual friends. Mutual made me pissed off, but whatever. Just a lot of victim-narrative stuff (lol which felt wild because she didn’t even KNOW these people; they are VERY new friends for her and friends she only built after my partner cut ties with her; and also, idk how you can play victim to me when I was the one cheated on?). I didn’t respond. I also get how she was feeling hurt, but I just felt like pursuing friendships with your ex’s close friends would ultimately be wildly toxic for her, not just me. The irony of her being a therapist and pursuing such shitty relationships was also getting to me.  Ugh. I was just getting tired of it. But also whatever, she doesn’t owe me anything. She can send unhinged emails, its fine; it happens.   
  
I then noticed my number started getting the weird spam. A lot more than normal. Maybe I was reading into it, but idk. Then a few friends approached me casually and brought up how weird it was that this woman rehomed her cat and adopted a dog that looked \*just\* like the dog I had recently adopted (I’ve been wanting a dog forever but was waiting for my research year to be over to get one). Tons of photos of my new dog had been circling on Instagram, so maybe word got out to her? I started feeling sort of creeped out. And a little harassed.

Anyway, time eased some of this. I got news she’d been dating and was glad she was moving on. Other rumors of her not handling a breakup well circled (she’d been dating a man for a month, they broke up, and then all these posters circled around town protesting his new record store opening). She seemed toxic as shit, and I was glad I drew boundaries. I was also glad I cut ties with the few friends that now were \*best friends\* with her. Linda and Morgan now hung out \*all\* the time and posted so many photos of their hangs. I don’t post on Insta much if at all, so it was easy for me to just shrug them off as artificial and try not to get too much FOMO.

About six months into me creating these boundaries, getting sad about being excluded from my usual hangs, but then getting over it because, lol, it would mean I would have to hang out with Morgan, I got a text from Linda. I eventually unfriended her on social media after six or so months because seeing her posts with Morgan was just annoying. Anyway, we had just gone on a climbing trip and every year I usually invited the same folks, but I decided to not invite Linda and her boyfriend. Frankly, I also felt really betrayed by her and unloved. I had silently let go of her friendship, but it still hurt. I think she was pissed I didn’t invite her on the trip. She felt excluded. So, she asked how she could make amends with me while still maintaining her friendship with Morgan. I sort of said “too little too late”. If she genuinely wanted to apologize to me, id be willing to work things out. But it just felt like she wanted me to not be upset by her befriending Morgan. She wanted me to not be sad, but she also wanted to be best friends with Morgan. She ghosted me for months and it felt like she was only trying to make amends because she was jealous I was hanging out with friends without her.

 This closure to our friendship breakup sort of sucked. I just felt really unheard and painted as if I was being overcontrolling. I just wanted to let it go. I started removing myself from big group chats with this friend in it- I just needed space.



Now is where the messier part comes in… and the part where I’m not sure if I am overreacting. I have a very close friend- a  person in my 5 person covid circle kind of close- who is super bubbly and nice and VERY caring. Let’s call her Dory. She was able to draw pretty mature boundaries with this ex (she doesn’t invite her to parties and whatnot, but definitely still is social media friends with Morgan). But, I started complaining about the few mutual friends who I lost in this process. For example, I shared the long text messages with Linda  who wanted to “make amends,” but who also got mad when I said I was hurt by her becoming best friends with Morgan and subsequently doubled down/ told me that I was never even a good friend to her in the first place. I just was pissed at these friends, and sometimes needed to vent. Anyway, I could tell Dory was uncomfortable with me shit talking these other friends. Which was fair. So I stopped shit-talking them to Dory and started finding a different friend to vent to.

One week, I was having a particularly hard time because a relative of my partners had died and I invited some friends over for a movie. Earlier in the week, I reached out saying I was having a bad week. Dory said she couldn’t come, because she was hanging with Linda and all of our mutual friends at a party watching Over the Garden Wall (Morgan was invited too). I got annoyed and sent a text like “oh; I wasn’t invited to that lol.” The next day, Dory texted me. We had a long conversation about how these friends meant a lot to her, and she was not going to cut them out of her life. Which is fair. I also knew I was in the wrong and said that I wasn’t asking her to cut them out, but sometimes do get FOMO/upset about this still.  She asked if it hurt me when she hung out with them and I said yes. That’s sort of how the chat ended.

I felt myself retreating a bit in our friendship. I usually cook a meal every week and have people over to watch the Golden Bachelor, and I just didn’t feel up to it. I stopped really engaging in our close 5 person chat. I started hanging out with my partner’s brother and her girlfriend instead of having people over for games. I knew this friend didn’t have the energy for my drama, and I also knew that I needed to find a circle of friends who did have that energy. I needed support, and I was struggling pretty seriously with my mental health.  
  
Anyway, I was dumb and posted some stupid Instagram repost therapy thing. For context, Dory texted a group without Linda in it saying that she wanted to have a gift swap. Then, in a FB event, she invited the folks in this group chat and also Linda. I had also just hung out with Linda at a friend’s birthday party and just left early because that friendship breakup still stung and I sort of wanted to vomit when I saw her.  I checked off supporting my friends birthday, but also felt like they understood why I wasn’t hanging around too long. And that was fine with me I had one friend who helped me navigate that and metaphorically held. My hand through the party and I most certainly would never had told anyone that it sucked they invited Linda. I know that would be overstepping. I responded “maybe” to the gift swap event where Linda was invited. I’d probably only go if Linda said no.  
  
Anyway, I posted a therapists’ Instagram story that essentially said “you cant control people. You tell them your boundaries, but youre not their parent. They can listen to your needs or not. Friendships/relationships are always in flux and will eventually align. Communicate, but then let go”.  Idk. Some shit.  I posted it because I had been able to create some space with Linda, but now have been dealing with being invited to the same stuff with her again. Which I could do every once in a while, but not every week.

Well, Dory is very emotionally intelligent and texted me. She’s pretty pissed that I’m retreating in our friendship. She’s also pissed that I get hurt when she hangs out with Linda. But, from my perspective, I am not trying to control Dory’s friendship—nor have I confronted her about how sad it makes me besides this passive Instagram post. Also, whatever, I’m sad; I don’t need her to change her ways, I’m just realizing I need to make some shifts in my friend group. I kept affirming that I in no way would end our friendship—but I am definitely retreating because I need more folks who can see how hurt I was by this toxic friend group. In our conversation, she blamed my partner for causing all of this. But, from my perspective as the only one who got hurt by his cheating, he’s made so many amends and proactively explained this situation to minimize messimess at every turn. Obviously just my perspective, but I think  he was sort of harassed by Morgan who was enabled by Linda. So, I place the mess on them. And I guess also on me for not putting up with it.  
  
I don’t know if I’m overreacting. I don’t want to be controlling, but I also am at a pretty low point in my mental health and need some people who understand me and are on “my side” (even though I know sides aren’t a thing; I just want support for me). This drama has been going on for two years now, and I’m just tired of it. Even I’m getting annoyed at my own complaining about it. I just want it to stop, I guess. 

 I guess, I don’t know if I really want to keep Dory as a super close friend, or if I’m overreacting by not being as close with Dory as I used to be. I really have valued her friendship and again would never cut ties with her fully. I just also have noticed I need a smaller group of friends where I feel heard and not crazy (even if I am crazy lol idk at this point). I don’t care if she maintains friends with Linda or goes to Linda’s shit. I shouldn’t have sent that text saying “lol I wasn’t invited” but I also want her to respect that I don’t like Linda, and to stop inviting me to things with Linda, because then I just have to hear about Linda’s friendship with Morgan.  Ugh. I just want her to see that I’m hurt and to not have to prove it.  But, also, I’m not going to force her to do that. I am just trying to preserve my own peace, I guess by taking a step back.  
  
I feel like I’m spiraling of course, but am I also overreacting? Should I try to make amends with Dory, or just sort of let this friendship grow out a bit. We’re having an in-person conversation this week and I could use some advice.",2,1731433199.0,relationshipadvice,2,1.0,False

The concert is this Saturday on the 16th. I’m also surprising Allison with her best friend (Emma) who lives in another state. Emma was originally driving but is now flying instead. It was a little easier for me to surprise Allison since Emma was going to drive, I could just have Emma knock on the door or have her sneak in the house while my wife and I step away. Bottom line it was easier for me to plan the surprise. Now that Emma is flying, I have to think of surprising her a new way. I don’t want to drive my wife to the airport cause she would instantly know and I feel like that’s a little lame lol

So here are a few ideas I have already but I feel like they aren’t the best idk please help!!

-I could go by myself to the airport, but I would need a reason that to be gone for 30 minutes. I can say I’m getting coffee, but the line is long? We also have each other’s location on so I would have to tell her that my app isn’t working and turn it off? But she would know that I turned it off. I also can’t leave my phone on airplane mode cause I need to be in contact with Emma

I'm a nerdy mum, full-time professional, separated and going through a divorce, trying to put myself out there and have a social life again, except… I'm a massive introvert. Need a supportive friend or few that want to get to know each other and help get me out of my little shell. Maybe you're an introvert, too? Maybe we can help each other conquer fears and try some crazy new things? Maybe we become lifelong best friends. Who knows…

Prefer other females, but would consider males under certain conditions. My goal isn't to find a date, it's to find actual friends to do fun shit with. Concerts, trivia, paint and sip, bingo, craft fair browsing, snow tubing, join a fitness group, try a line dancing class, or whatever fun folks do these days. 

Some of my hobbies include: writing, making cheesy mom jokes, singing/recording, dancing, discovering new music, stargazing, doomscrolling (ha), baking, and building the perfect campfire. I enjoy an occasional social drink, and I don't care what your legal substance of choice is as long as you do it responsibly, even if it's just life that gets you high.

I don't have a ton of free time but I do have some. Ideally, I'd be looking to chat on here or discord for a bit, get to know each other and get comfortable, then voice and video chat to make sure we're not catfish or murderers, and then go out for coffee or lunch (again making sure we're not hiding anything sinister), and then do something fun!

Please be at least over 30, and if after this entire post, the amount of effort you put into your response is ""hey"" I probably won't answer. 

Also, I don't want to discuss religion or politics and I don't care who or what your political or religious views are, but if it's something you need to talk about on a daily basis, we probably won't get along.

What cooking methods will maximize the health benefits? 
 
These are guidelines that I've read in reddit comments. Please confirm or deny them if you know:

-Desireable compounds (polysaccharides) are generally much more bio available and concentrated in extractions than they are in raw or cooked mushrooms. The fact that your gut bacteria breaks down chitin isn't relevant....? 
-most mushrooms have water-soluble and alcohol-soluble compounds and it's best to use dual extraction to get both
-Beta glucans in lions mane are best extracted from chitin via a pressure cooker (and then what? Drink the broth?)
-Pan frying in oil will eliminate most of the health benefits
-Dehydrating -> blending -> steeping in hot tea, coffee, or soup is a good alternative to doing a full on extraction, but you will miss out of alcohol-soluble compounds? 
-freezing a raw mushroom isn't recommended for texture... but does it break down the chitin and make it more bioavailable?

Worth noting, my car was on the other end of the block, and not near her place, so this wasn’t done for convenience or anything, she just wanted to walk me back to my car, and said she wanted me to get home sooner.

Long story short, my middle sister is pregnant. I (the oldest of 3 girls) quit trying after fertility treatments wrecked my mental health. I mostly made peace with it, but the news was still a lot to digest.  

The good: I saw my sister and her very visible baby bump at my youngest sister's wedding a month ago. It was fine, easier than I expected, maybe because the wedding was the focus of the day and I could keep myself busy easily. My sister was obviously very very nervous with the pregnancy. I learned that she had a miscarriage 2 years ago and fertility treatments since. She was about to quit when she got pregnant. I got a lot more empathy for her now. Her favorite boy name is the same as mine, and she's having a boy. It's a family name, and I'm glad that someone is getting the chance to use it.

The bad: my mother kept mocking my sister for following her doctors recommendation for food (very basic stuff like no cold cuts) and telling her about how she (my mother) got 3 healthy babies eating whatever she wanted and drinking multiples coffees every day. I had to run interference a few times. My mother is socially inept and we usually dismiss her comments fairly easily, but it was clearly bothering my sister. 

The ugly: I since cut contact with my parents. I don't know if it's temporary or permanent but I had to protect myself. I expressed many times that I won't have conversations about my sister's pregnancy, partly because it's none of my business but mostly because I don't need to getting my emotions in shambles every time I talk to my parents, and yet my mother kept talking about it. I would stay absolutely silent on the phone and she would keep going. That was annoying but bearable. And this weekend, my mother expressed how glad she was for the American election (we are not Americans) and that leftists won't be able to ruin the world now. Apparently, she likes JD Vance and thinks that he is a great speaker. I told her twice that I strongly disagree and that we need to change the subject because there is now way that I will listen to her praise someone who publicly says that I'm useless, as a women with no children. She kept going for a solid five minutes so I just hung up. I'm a little bit hurt that she didn't take my warning seriously, but I'm mostly pissed. Really pissed  

The no contact is not unexpected. I had been on the verge of doing it a few times. Family is not a good thing when all they do is upset you and make you feel like a black sheep all the time. I don't talk to my sisters outside of family events anyways.

So I bought tickets to spend Christmas riding horses in Texas, planned 2 trips with my husband for next year, including one with my lovely and kind in-laws, and decided that from now on, as a 43 years old women with no kids, I'll do everything I want and absolutely nothing else.

1gpqakp,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1gpqakp/my_girlfriends_brother_is_amazing/,My Girlfriend’s brother is amazing,"So, I have been dating my girlfriend for about a 8 months and am crazy about her. Last week I met her family. Now I know a little bit about them all.

Mom is textbook example of can’t sit still. Has multiple business ventures going on at the same time while still finding time to manage her dogs. The amount of energy this woman has is awe inspiring.

Dad is quiet and loving, basically comes from a small village from a family that had little, moved to capital when in high school, first person from his family to finish college and today counts as the top 1-2% in our country.

Then we have the man, the myth, the legend. THE BROTHER. Bassically wicked smart, barely finished high school, which is a miracle in itself since he never brought books to school he just passed based on what he heard in class (during which he didn’t pay attention because he was the class clown). Started doing way too many party drugs and drink too much in high school, and developed a gambling problem. 
Then he enrolled into college but dropped out without anyone finding out due to forging emails and report cards, his parents only found out due to randomly meeting the dean of college somewhere and he happened to come up during conversation.
Went to work overseas, like hard physical labor. Then when he was 23 he decided he had been to enough casinos and parties so he dropped gambling, and drugs completely, alcohol maybe he drinks one glass a week. Met a woman while traveling due to work. Married said woman. And is now completely relaxed. One thing my girlfriend emphasized is that he is funny and street smart. 

Anyway while visiting her family my girlfriend and her mother had to go for a 2 day trip to coast to take care of some documents. Her brother offered instead of going with them and being alone there while they deal with lawyers and such I stay with him and his wife in the city. My girlfriend encouraged that as she knew it would be boring.

So they went Monday night and were coming back Wednesday morning. On Monday when I came to his place, he just started talking about his life, in more detail than I shared, and honestly it’s fascinating. The experiences that this man had.
Tuesday he wakes me up 8 a.m.

Now this might be a good time to mention my girlfriend is vegetarian (her family is not). So he wakes me up gives me coffee and tells me today is cooking day. He asks me a couple of questions about cooking (how comfortable I am with this or that, which admittedly I am an embarrassingly bad cook for my age 25). Then he says that won’t do. And proceeds to drill into me for the whole day dozens of vegetarian dishes that he knows my girlfriend loves (like ridiculously good dishes). Turns out he hosts dinners quite often and is the designated cook in their household. At the end of the day he tells me now when you guys (me and my girlfriend) go back invite her home and cook her any one of those. Couple of life stories and advices more and that’s it.

So me and my girlfriend go back to our city and one day I invite her home to cook for her which she finds suspicious due to being well aware of my lack of skill. But lo and behold I surprise her. She knows right away who gave me the recipe because it’s one of her brother’s original ones and she starts crying. Saying how she really misses him and how whenever they had family dinner at his place he would always makes separate dishes for her. 

I never made a girl cry with happiness. I didn’t know what to do, she was happy but she was crying, I was just panicking and asking is she okay. Anyways this might not be a noteworthy story but for me it’s something amazing.

I had girlfriends before and if they had brothers we would always be uncomfortable around each other, I also have difficulties connecting to people, but this larger then life man, took his time to teach me how to make his sister happy. I don’t know. I thought he deserved to be immortalized in some way and I didn’t know any other. That’s it.

I live in an apartment complex where my next-door neighbor and I share a wall. For the past few weeks, I’ve noticed little things in my apartment that feel... off. It started small, like my keys being in a different spot, or my coffee cup on the counter when I swear I left it in the sink.

But it’s escalated to strange things I can't easily explain. One day, I came home to find my bookshelf reorganized by color (which, trust me, I would never do). I even found my laundry folded up neatly on my couch—mind you, I hadn’t done my laundry that week. I told myself I must have just forgotten. Stress, right?

But then things got even stranger. A couple of nights ago, I came home late, and my place smelled strongly of my neighbor's very specific cologne. No one else wears that scent, and he’d mentioned it once before, proudly. I thought, okay, that’s weird, but maybe it was coming through the vents. But then yesterday I came home, and a framed picture of my family was on my neighbor’s porch table. I was sure it was mine, so I went over and asked, and he just looked at me calmly and said, “It must’ve blown over. Things happen.”

I would drink cups and cups of coffee and sleep very little (around 4 hrs a week) and wouldn't eat anything either. It's been 10 years now, and I've gotten a lot better. I'm on medication and go for therapy. 

I like drinking coffee because it makes me hyperfocus and work for hours without feeling tired. It literally give me the ability to turn all my ideas into reality. And I have a lot of ideas. I'm literally starting a new business now and I'm terrified I only did it because of coffee. 

Even though it helps a lot, it also completely fucks me up. I get horrible mood swings and uncontrollable rage and outbursts where I yell at people and hurt everyone around me and make everything so much worse. I stop eating and don't want to sleep which make the mood swings so much worse. I start questioning every good thing about my life. I feel like everyone around me is manipulating me. Even though I know how good my life is right now, I start feeling like I'm just pretending it's good and I'm actually miserable (which is not the case at all). 

I don't usually drink coffee because I know it does this to me but once in a while if I have a lot of work, I give in and then end up miserable as I crash.

TLDR; Coffee makes me super productive and helps with procrastination but makes my symptoms so much worse. Is this a thing or am I the only one who feels this? ",0,1731432536.0,BPD,3,0.5,False

The other is 39, is a professional that works downtown, is very convenient, as we walk to dinner, walk to a little boutique hotel to have fun. She dresses nice, works out, has her own car. 
When I look at the cons of either one, I keep thinking of their beautiful faces and things they daid to me and I still want to see either of them again! One is close to me and the chance of meeting on the street is good but Im trying to keep it discreet for my professional career. The other is the drive in the winter time and doesnt have her own car or place. Plus she dresses as a student but then again this is a college town.

it continued to help the anxiety but not the adhd symptoms. it also had me feeling super sedated (which pre clonidine i was already a sleepy gal in general) id either wake up feeling super groggy or wake up at like 5am unable to go back to sleep even if i only slept for a few hours then ultimately crash at like 4pm

im a bad pill taker and sometimes im so sleepy at night i fall asleep accidentally without taking the clonidine, but it is not something you’re really allowed to skip because it can cause rebound hypertension. 2 nights ago i missed my dose so the next morning, trying to avoid the shitty side effects, i just took my dose from the night before when i woke up at 9:30am and went about my day

can i say, i am like… feeling the effects again?? i literally cleaned out my closet, sorted everything into piles and then….. actually put the piles away? it was like, i thought about cleaning the closet and before i could even think about it, i was already doing it. this morning i did the same thing and i got up before my class, cooked breakfast and made a coffee, and decided to start tracking my meals again to encourage myself to eat better/focus on protein intake (something ive been meaning to do for so long) and have plans to go to the gym tonight for the first time in almost a year.

i have an appointment with my psychiatrist on thursday and wanna see what her thoughts are, i’ve seen people in this sub saying they take it in the morning and at night. i just feel like taking it at night, i can’t experience the peak effects because i’m sleeping during it.

For context, I live in a small gated community. Shortly after moving back, I noticed a cat hanging around my yard. She had a mangy coat, was quite dirty and really skinny so I assumed she was a stray - we have lots of strays in the area so this isn’t an unreasonable assumption (especially given her appearance). I slowly started spending more time with her, trying to get her used to me. And I would feed her. She started getting used to me and began coming inside the house. She would spend her days inside my room, and often leave at night. Around January, she started sleeping in my room too. 

Fast forward to March, my dad gets a message from one of our neighbours asking if we’ve seen their cat. He sends us a picture, lo and behold, it’s the cat that I ‘rescued’. I was incredibly confused because she had been living with me for about 2 months at this point. However, I was happy that she had a home because I was going away for a few months and wouldn’t be able to look after her. 

I got back home in June, and the day I got back she showed up at my door. I was so excited because I had missed her. I got a job working from home, so I’m at home almost every day. I stopped feeding her because I knew she had a family to go back to so she’d spend her day with me (while they were at work and school) and then typically go home in the evenings to get food. This carried on for a few more months. Eventually she stopped going home entirely - I tried to encourage her to go home by not feeding her and working in coffee shops so that she couldn’t see me. But it didn’t work, she’d wait around for me and stay with me even if I wasn’t feeding her. Eventually I had to start feeding her again because she wasn’t going home to eat, despite my best efforts to try to get her to go home. 

She now basically lives with me, except when I’m not here then she goes ‘home’. My neighbour is constantly asking if she’s here. He has 2 young children that miss her (which is understandable) and I will take her to their house whenever he asks. It’s almost been a year that she’s been visiting me and a couple months that she’s been living with me. There’s a lot of tension between my dad and neighbour, and even some of the other neighbours have started giving their input. It’s a terribly awkward situation and I understand that I’m in the wrong but I also can’t help that she chooses me over them. And it doesn’t seem fair to her for me to just stop caring for her.

I've got a date lined up, i asked her what her type of environment is whether she wants to drink or play pool or whatever and she says somewhere where there's food.

So i found a very big club style with many restaurants and bars inside, pool tables ect.

The thing is, I've checked their menu and just for a steak and chips is 35$ per person, which i think is tooooo much for a first date.

Don't get me wrong, paying for a date is fine in my opinion, but..... After at least one date, because here's the thing.... I don't know her, she's a complete stranger who I'm gonna be buying dinner + drinks for, and it's not my thing, because most dates never end up being second dates, so what's the point?

First dates aren't about spending your hard earned cash on a stranger from a dating app, rather getting to know this person.

[TRIGGER WARNING]","Ok, so we've heard stories of women assaulted and unalived at work in tech. Tech industry attracted the most evil horrible people because of how much money USED to be in it. But somehow the general image has been that only smart nerdy introverts get into tech. That isn't true. 

I want to share the story of how I lost $300k, but that was ok, because I also almost lost my life. 

Moved to NYC from Eastern Europe at 21, was hoping to build a career in advertising, but ended up waiting tables. As you do lol. As I'm trying to come up with something more sustainable, I'm trying to come up with some sort of business for myself, I'm good at advertising, I'm good at sales, there has to be something I can do with that and with my connections back home. Until I find something! 

This relative of mine reaches out, the one who lend me money to move to the US to begin with, and tells me him and his friend (both developers) just finished this product - it's an HR system, a rip off of SuccessFactors, but made on SharePoint. Same functionality for fraction of the cost. See, they both have just been fired from their job maintaining SuccessFactors at a large company, they didn't want to work for someone else anymore, so they locked themselves in the basement for 6 months, and finished the product, fueled by pizza and coffee. And check this out. They made a website, people are reaching out, they already have a few HUNDRED ""contact us"" requests, but because they're both nerdy nerds who don't know how to talk to humans they need someone to talk to humans for them. Oh, and all the requests are from the US. 

The year is 2010.

So I join. Since I need to pay my bills here and would need to quit my job for this, we agree on a salary of $4k/month (what I was making waiting tables) +30% of the sales as a commission. So we technically split profits 3 ways, but I kinda get a little more money than them, because of this ""salary"", but we all agree that I can't do this only based on commissions, since it is a full time job, and I do live in you know, the most expensive city in the world. This will become important later. 

I start reaching out to the people who filled out the ""contact us"" form, start showing them the product and what do you know! People start buying the system! The first client is $5k. The second is $27k. And we keep going. 1-2 clients per month, $30k-80k per month in sales. I'm starting to feel good. 

We register an LLC here in the states, but they refuse to put my name on it. I'm a young girl, a sucker, I don't insist, and I let it go. We open a bank account, everything is registered to my home address, checks come to my home. 

Things are going ok, I make around $80/year, I'm 24. They start hiring people back in Europe, more developers, product is growing, support packages are growing, it's a legit business. 

I come to visit my hometown one day, come to the office - and no one really knows who I am. So these guys make it seem like they're the ones handling sales this whole time, while in reality none of them spoke to any clients, like, ever. I let it go, it's ok. I'm just so grateful to have a job. 

I do get a little bitter, that while they all seem to have an office here, team, team outings, they're all friends with each other, I'm in Brooklyn all alone, working crazy hours from home. But I say, it's ok. It's fine. I go back.

These 2 partners of mine start coming to the US a lot, we go to conferences, they pay for very expensive hotels for us, luxurious dinners, and they even talk about moving their families to the US. We go to California a few times and even look at office spaces in Bay Area. 

They treat me like shit the whole time. 

But I keep working, no one else is really hiring me in the US (I do apply for jobs every now and then), so I decide to work a little harder on this business to make some more money. See, those $80k we all make allow for a VERY LUXURIOUS lifestyle in Eastern Europe, but in Brooklyn I sometimes treat myself to an expensive cheese lol. So I want more money. I'm thinking this will be good for everyone. 

I get 2 very large clients, I spend a whole year on just those two. We have a few smaller clients, but business has slowed down with smaller clients, there was now a lot of other HR tools, like Bamboo who were even cheaper and easier to use. 

So ok. I get 2 large clients. Total of almost $1M for both in the same year. And then things get weird. 

So we have 2 bank accounts - one in the US, one in Europe. I pay my income taxes, but don't get involved in corporate taxes, since you know, my name isn't on anything anyway. My partners insist these 2 clients pay to the European account. And then they start ignoring me. They stop answering my calls, everyone in the company now ignores me, and I have no idea what the hell is going on. 

After very weird 6 months, where I don't even receive the leads from the website anymore and start suspecting they hired someone else to do sales now, they eventually come to the US again for a conference. They're acting weirder than ever, and I'm just so oblivious about what the hell is going on, I can't wrap my mind around it. 

I keep pretending everything is ok, as I keep asking questions. Are we cool? Did the client pay? And if so, where is my portion? Are we still working together? Did I do something wrong? 

I keep pressing and they finally give me a story. Idk what to make of it, I'll just tell you what it is. They say they wanted to avoid paying taxes, so they open an offshore account somewhere though a 3rd party. And they were ""going to send me my money"" once those accounts settle and money is in. But that third party company just got arrested, because turned out they also opened accounts for people who trade illegal weapons, so now ALL accounts opened by that 3rd party all are arrested. So the money is frozen and there is ""nothing they can do right now"".

They leave the US. As I notice that back home they each bough a $250k new apartments with luxurious renovations, and both of them and their wives now all drive $80k cars. While the money is ""frozen"". 

I technically still work there, they send me my salary, but I no longer get any leads that come from the website. And I don't know if it's because there aren't any, or they're going to someone else. 

I can't find another job, no one would even give me an interview and I'm getting desperate. 

They come to the US again. They loved coming to the US for bullshit conferences, it was their break from families, and I was the one who'd organize everything. Like a freaking travel concierge. Conference, hotels, dinners, shopping, activities. As I realize I have been scared of them for a very long time now. I can't 'not go"" to the conference, they say they'll ""fire me"". I'm scared. I can't even explain the weird horror state I'm in. Confused. Tired. and Scared.

So I go. I decide to ""sort this out"" once and for all. We're drinking in their hotel room in Las Vegas. As we'd often do. I keep asking. They get angrier and angrier.

I live in an apartment complex where my next-door neighbor and I share a wall. For the past few weeks, I’ve noticed little things in my apartment that feel... off. It started small, like my keys being in a different spot, or my coffee cup on the counter when I swear I left it in the sink.

But it’s escalated to strange things I can't easily explain. One day, I came home to find my bookshelf reorganized by color (which, trust me, I would never do). I even found my laundry folded up neatly on my couch—mind you, I hadn’t done my laundry that week. I told myself I must have just forgotten. Stress, right?

But then things got even stranger. A couple of nights ago, I came home late, and my place smelled strongly of my neighbor's very specific cologne. No one else wears that scent, and he’d mentioned it once before, proudly. I thought, okay, that’s weird, but maybe it was coming through the vents. But then yesterday I came home, and a framed picture of my family was on my neighbor’s porch table. I was sure it was mine, so I went over and asked, and he just looked at me calmly and said, “It must’ve blown over. Things happen.”

Am I being paranoid, or is this getting as weird as it feels?",1,1731431311.0,NoStupidQuestions,11,0.67,False

At the same time I was feeling devastation and even stopped going to work for a period of time.



Fast forward to a few weeks later I saw he hadn't unmatched me, I reached out and he was very understanding of the situation, which I was so thankful for. He asked to meet up, I felt unsure because emotionally I was still dealing with the death. I ended up saying ok to maybe a coffee, but he insisted to treat me for dinner and again first time meeting him.



So we met and it's been a few months now, since then we treat each other to nice places and get each other gifts, he also got me a diamond necklace which I found meaningful. He is consistently caring and I feel like he cherishes me. He also asked me to commit/ be exclusive with him (as in not use the apps anymore and only him) and I was so happy to and asked him to do the same.



I think I love him and I'm interested in becoming intimate with him. He hasn't really initiated that stuff with me.

She is on donepezil but it doesn’t seem to do much for her. She’s also on mirabegron for bladder weakness. One of the saddest things is that Mums Mum my grandmother also had Alzheimer’s and Mum was so terrified of getting it she wouldn’t even mention the A word after Nan died. Mum also avoided red meat after the BSE/CJD scare in the UK in the 80’s. 
It breaks my heart that she then got Alzheimer’s herself. 

A few weeks ago she found a lump on her breast (who knows how longs it’s been there) which has since been confirmed as breast cancer. We’ve got a family meeting with the consultant regarding the 2-3 CM breast cancer tumour and what treatment to pursue. 

They’ve put her on anastrozol as it’s an Estrogen receptive tumour.
No idea from them at this point if they think it’s spread. 

My personal opinion is what is the point of any further treatment for the tumour. I will not agree to lumpectomy or mastectomy or any chaemo or radio therapy (I have power of attorney with my two brothers) 

Day to day Mum can get herself out for coffee on her own and to buy endless coats and handbags in every colour but her Memory is goldfish level. She also can’t understand that Dad is dead (3 years now) and keeps asking when he’s coming home and why he chose to be cremated as it’s “difficult to come back from that” 

It’s all just heartbreaking and as a responder who’s dealt with end stage dementia patients many times I don’t want to see her end up like that.

1gppngo,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1gppngo/my_mother_hasnt_been_the_same_since_i_found_an/,My mother hasn't been the same since I found an old recipe book,"When I got the call that my uncle had been arrested again, I wasn’t surprised. He was charming, reckless, and unpredictable—the kind of guy who knew his way around trouble and didn’t seem to mind it. But this time felt different. It wasn’t just a few months; he was facing ten years. A decade behind bars, for possession of over a pound of cocaine. They said it was hidden in the trunk of his car, packed away as casually as groceries. 

It stung. He’d promised us he was clean, that his wild years were behind him. Even at Thanksgiving, he’d go out of his way to remind us all that he was on the straight and narrow. We’d had our doubts—old habits don’t vanish overnight, after all. But a pound? None of us had seen that coming. My uncle swore up and down the drugs weren’t his, said he was framed, that someone wanted to see him gone for good. But when we pressed him on it, he’d just clam up, muttering that spending a decade locked away was better than what ""they"" would do to him.

After he was sentenced, my mom called, her voice tight, asking if I could go to his place and sort through his things. It was typical family duty—the kind of thing I couldn’t turn down. I wasn’t close with him, but family ties run deep enough to leave you feeling responsible, even when you know you shouldn’t.

So, with him locked away for the next ten years, I volunteered to clear out his apartment, move his things to storage. I didn’t know why I was so eager, but maybe I felt like it was the least I could do. The place was a disaster, exactly as I expected. His kitchen cupboards were filled with thrift-store pots and pans, each one more scratched and mismatched than the last. I could see him at the stove, cigarette dangling from his lips, stirring whatever random meal he’d thrown together in those beat-up pans.

The living room was its own kind of graveyard. Ashtrays covered nearly every surface, filled with weeks’ worth of cigarette butts, and the walls were a deep, sickly yellow from years of constant smoke. Even the light switches had turned the same shade, crusted over from the nasty habit that had stained every inch of the place. It was clear he hadn’t cracked a window in years. I found myself running my fingers along the walls, almost wondering if the yellow residue would come off. It didn’t.

In one corner of the room was his pride and joy: a collection of *Star Trek* figurines and posters, lined up on a crooked shelf he’d likely hammered up himself. He’d been a fan for as long as I could remember, always rambling about episodes I’d never seen and characters I couldn’t name. Dozens of plastic figures with blank, determined stares watched me pack up their home, my uncle’s treasures boxed up and ready to be hidden away for who knew how long.

It took a few days, but I finally got the majority of the place packed. Three trips in my truck, hauling boxes and crates to the storage facility across town, until the apartment was stripped bare. The only things left were the stained carpet, the nicotine-coated walls, and the broken blinds barely hanging in the windows. There was no way he was getting his security deposit back; the damage was practically baked into the place. But it didn’t matter anymore.

As I sorted through the last of the kitchen, my hand brushed against something tucked away in the shadows of the cabinet. I pulled it out and found myself holding a small, leather-bound book. The cover was cracked and worn, the leather soft from age, with a faint smell of cigarette smoke clinging to it. The pages inside were yellowed, brittle, and marked with years of kitchen chaos—stains, smudges, and scribbled notes everywhere.

The entries were scattered, written down in no particular order, almost as if whoever kept this book had jotted recipes down the moment they’d been created, without thought of organization. As I skimmed the pages, a feeling crept over me that this book might have belonged to my grandfather. He was the one who’d brought the family together, year after year, with his homemade dishes. Every holiday felt anchored by the meals he’d cooked, recipes no one had ever been able to quite replicate. This book could very well hold the secrets to those meals, a piece of him that had somehow made its way into my uncle’s hands after my grandfather passed. And yet…

I couldn’t shake a strange sense of dread as I held it. The leather was cold against my hands, almost damp, and a chill worked its way through me as I turned the pages. It felt *wrong*, somehow, as if there was more in this book than family recipes.

Curious about the book’s origins, I brought it to my mom. She took one look at the looping handwriting on the yellowed pages and nodded, her face softening with recognition. ""This was your grandfather's,"" she said, almost reverently, tracing her fingers along the ink. She hadn’t seen it in years, and when I told her where I'd found it, a look of surprise flickered across her face. She had been searching for the book for ages and had never realized her brother had kept it all this time.  

As she flipped through the pages, nostalgia mingled with something else—maybe a touch of sadness or reverence. I could tell this book meant a lot to her, which only strengthened my resolve to preserve it. “Could I hang onto it a little longer?” I asked. “I want to scan it, make a digital copy for myself, so we don’t lose any of his recipes.”

My mom agreed without hesitation, grateful that I was taking the time to safeguard something she hadn’t known was still around. So I got to work. Over the next few weeks, in the gaps of my day-to-day life, I carefully scanned each page. I wasn’t too focused on the content itself, more concerned with making sure each recipe was clear and legible, and didn’t pay close attention to the strange ingredients and odd notes scattered throughout. My only goal was to make the text accessible, giving life to a digital copy that would be preserved indefinitely.

Once I finished, I spent a few hours merging the scanned images, piecing them together to create a seamless digital version. When it was finally done, I returned the original to my mom, feeling a strange mix of relief and satisfaction. The family recipes were now safe, and I thought that was the end of it. But that sense of unease I’d felt in the kitchen, holding that worn leather cover, lingered longer than I expected.

In the months that followed, I didn’t think much about the recipe book. Scanning it had been a small side project, the kind I’d meant to follow up on by actually cooking a few of my grandfather’s old dishes. But like so many side projects, I got wrapped up in other things and the book’s contents drifted to the back of my mind, filed away and forgotten.

Then Thanksgiving rolled around. I made my way to my parents’ place, expecting the usual—turkey, stuffing, and the familiar spread that had become tradition. When I got there, though, I noticed something different right away. A large bird sat in the middle of the table, roasted to perfection, but something about it didn’t look right. It was too small for a turkey, and its skin looked darker, almost rougher than the golden-brown I was used to.  

“Nice chicken,” I said, figuring they’d switched things up for a change. My mom just shook her head.

“It’s not a chicken,” she said quietly. “It’s a hen.”

I gave her a confused look. “What’s the difference?” I asked, half-laughing, expecting her to shrug it off with a quick explanation. Instead, she just stared at me, her eyes unfocused as if she were lost in thought. 

For a moment, her face seemed distant, almost blank, as though I’d asked a question she couldn’t quite place. Then, suddenly, she blinked, her gaze snapping back to me. “It’s just… what the recipe called for,” she said, a strange edge to her voice.

Something about it made the hair on my arms prickle, but I pushed the feeling aside, figuring she’d just been caught up in the cooking chaos. Yet, as I looked at the bird again, a small flicker of unease crept in, settling in the back of my mind like an itch I couldn’t scratch.

After dinner, I pulled my dad aside in the kitchen while my mom finished clearing the table. ""What’s the deal with Mom tonight?"" I asked, keeping my voice low. He just shrugged, brushing it off with a wave of his hand.

“You know how your mother is,” he said with a small smile, as though her strange excitement was just one of those quirks. He didn’t give it a second thought, already moving on.

But I couldn’t shake the weirdness. The whole meal had been… off. The hen, unlike anything we’d had before, was coated in a sweet-smelling sauce that seemed to have a faint hint of walnut to it, almost masking its pale, ashen hue. The bird lay on a bed of unfamiliar greens—probably some sort of garnish—alongside perfectly sliced parsnips and radishes that seemed too neatly arranged, like it was all meant to look a certain way. The whole thing was far too elaborate for my mom’s usual Thanksgiving style.

When she finally sat, she led us in saying grace, her voice soft and reverent. As she began cutting into the hen, a strange glint of excitement lit up her face, one I wasn’t used to seeing. She served it up, watching each of us intently as we took our first bites. I wasn’t sure what I expected, but as I brought a piece to my mouth, I could tell right away this wasn’t the usual Thanksgiving fare. The meat was tough—almost stringy—and didn’t pull apart easily, a far cry from the tender turkey or even chicken I was used to.

Mom kept glancing between my dad and me with a kind of eager glee, as though she were waiting for us to say something. It was unsettling, her eyes wide, as if she were waiting for us to uncover some hidden secret.

When I finally asked, “What’s got you so excited, Mom?” she just smiled, her expression softening.

“Oh, it’s just… this cookbook you found from Grandpa’s things. It’s like having a part of him here with every meal I make.” She spoke with a reverence I hadn’t heard in her voice for a long time, as though she were talking about more than just food.

I gave her a nod, trying to humor her. “Tastes good,” I said, hoping she’d ease up. “I enjoyed it.” But in truth, I wished we’d had a more familiar Thanksgiving dinner. The meal wasn’t exactly bad, but something tasted a little off. I couldn’t put my finger on it, and maybe I didn’t want to.

After we finished, I said my goodbyes and headed home, trying to shake the lingering sense of unease. My mom’s face, her excitement, kept replaying in my mind. And then there was the hen itself. Why a hen? Why the pale, ashen sauce? There was something almost ritualistic in the way she’d prepared it, a strange precision I’d never seen from her before.

The night stretched on, the questions gnawing at me, taking root in a way that wouldn’t let me rest.

When I got home, I couldn’t shake the weird feeling from dinner. I sat down at my desk, opening the scanned file I’d saved to my desktop months ago. The folder had been sitting there, untouched, and now that I finally had it open, I could see why I’d put it off. The handwriting was dense and intricate, almost a kind of calligraphy, each letter curling into the next. The words seemed to dance across the pages in a strange, whimsical flow. I had to squint, leaning closer to make sense of each line.

As I scrolled through the recipes, a chill ran down my spine. They had unsettling names, the kind that felt more like old spells than recipes. *Mother’s Last Supper Porridge*, *Binding Broth of Bone and Leaf*, *Elders’ Emberbread*, *Hollow Heart Soup with Mourning Onion*. I wasn’t sure if it was my imagination, but I could almost feel a heaviness creeping into the room, the words themselves holding an eerie energy. 

Then, I found it—the recipe for the dish my mother had made tonight: *Ancestor’s Offering*. The recipe was titled in that same swirling calligraphy, and I felt a knot tighten in my stomach as I read the description. It was for a Maple-Braised Hen with Black Walnut and Root Purée, though it didn’t sound like any recipe I’d ever seen. The instructions were worded strangely, written in a style that made it feel centuries old. Each ingredient was listed with specific purpose and detail, as though it held some secret power.

My eyes skimmed down to the meat. It specified a hen, not just any chicken. “The body must be that of a mother,” it read. I felt a shiver go through me, remembering the strange way my mom had insisted on using a hen, correcting me when I’d casually referred to it as chicken. 

The instructions continued, noting that the hen had to be served on a bed of Lamb’s lettuce—a type of honeysuckle, according to a quick Google search. And then, as I read further, a chill seeped into my bones. The recipe stated it must be served “just before the end of twilight, as dusk yields to night.” I thought back to dinner, and the way we’d all sat down just as the last of the sun’s light faded beyond the horizon.

But the final instruction was the worst part, and as I read it, my stomach twisted in revulsion. The recipe called for something it referred to as *Ancestor’s Salt*. The note at the bottom explained that this “salt” was a sprinkle of the ashes of “those who have returned to the earth,” with a warning to use it sparingly, as “each grain remembers the one who offered it.”

I sat back, cold sweat breaking out across my skin as I recalled the pale, ashen sauce coating the hen, the faint, sweet scent it gave off. My mind raced, piecing together what it implied. Had my mom actually used… ashes in the meal? Had she… used my grandfather’s ashes?

I tried to shake it off, to tell myself it was just some old folklore nonsense. But the image of her smiling face as she served us that meal, the gleam in her eyes, crept back into my mind. I felt my stomach churn, bile rising in my throat as the horrifying thought sank deeper.

A few days later, the gnawing unease had become impossible to ignore. I told myself I was probably just overreacting, that the weird details in the recipe were nothing more than some strange family tradition I didn’t understand. Still, I couldn’t shake the dread that crept up every time I remembered that meal. So, I decided to call my mom. I planned it out, careful to come off as casual. The last thing I wanted was for her to think I was accusing her of something as insane as putting ashes in our food.

I asked about my dad, about her gardening, anything to warm her up a bit. Then I thanked her for the Thanksgiving dinner, even going so far as to say it was the best we’d had in years. When I finally brought up the recipe book, her voice brightened instantly.

“Oh, thank you again for finding it!” she said, sounding genuinely pleased. “I had no idea he’d cataloged so many wonderful recipes. I knew your grandfather’s cooking was special, but to have all these dishes recorded, like his own little legacy—it’s been such a joy.”

I chuckled, trying to keep my tone light. “I actually looked up that dish you made us, *Ancestor’s Offering*. Thought maybe I’d give it a try myself sometime.” 

“Oh, really?” she replied, sounding intrigued.

“Yeah, though I thought it was a little strange the recipe specifically calls for a hen and not just a regular chicken, since they’re so much tougher. And the part that says it should be ‘the body of a mother’…” I let the words hang, hoping she’d jump in with some explanation that would make it all seem less… sinister.

For a moment, there was just silence on her end. Then, quietly, she said, “Well, that’s just how your grandfather wrote it, I suppose.” Her voice was different now, lower, as if she were carefully choosing her words.

My heart thumped in my chest, and I decided to press a little further. “I also noticed it calls for something called *Ancestor’s Salt*,” I said, feigning confusion, pretending I hadn’t read the footnote that explicitly described it. “What’s that supposed to be?”

The silence was even longer this time, stretching out until it became a ringing hum in my ears. When she finally spoke, her voice was barely a whisper.

“I… I have to go,” she murmured, sounding almost dazed.

Before I could respond, the line clicked, leaving me in the heavy, stunned quiet. I tried calling her back immediately, but it went straight to voicemail. Her phone was off.

My stomach twisted as I stared at the blank screen. I couldn’t tell if I was more scared of what I might find out or of what I might already know.

I hesitated, but eventually called my dad’s phone, feeling a need to at least check in. When he picked up, I told him about my call with Mom and how strange she’d been acting.

“She went into her garden right after you two spoke,” he said, sounding unconcerned. “Started tending to her plants, hasn’t said a word since.”

I tried nudging him a bit, asking if he could maybe get her to talk to me, but he just brushed it off. “You’re overreacting. You know how your mother is—gets all sentimental over family things. It’ll just upset her if you keep nagging her about it. Give her some space.”

I nodded, trying to take his advice to heart. “Yeah… alright. You’re probably right.”

After we hung up, I resolved to let it go and went about my day, chalking it up to my mom’s usual habit of getting overly attached to anything with sentimental value. She’d always treated family heirlooms like they carried something sacred, almost magical. But this time, I couldn’t fully shake the nagging feeling in the back of my mind, something that made it impossible to forget about that recipe book.

Eventually, curiosity got the better of me. Sitting back down at my computer, I opened the digital copy and scrolled aimlessly through the pages. Part of me knew it was a bad idea, but I couldn’t resist. I let the file skip down to a random section, thinking I’d try making something small, something harmless. As I scrolled, I found myself staring at the very last page, which held a recipe titled *Elders’ Emberbread*.

The instructions were minimal, yet each word seemed heavy, steeped in purpose. Beneath the title, a note read: “Best served in small portions on cold, dark nights. The taste is best enjoyed alone—lest the voices of the past linger too long.” 

I shook my head, half-amused, half-unnerved. It was all nonsense, I told myself, probably just some old superstitions my grandfather had picked up along the way. But something about it had my heart pounding just a bit harder. Ignoring the rising chill, I printed the recipe and took it to the kitchen. I’d play along, I figured. It was just bread, after all.

I scanned the list of ingredients for *Elders’ Emberbread*, feeling time slip away as though I’d been pulled into some strange trance. My mind blurred over, details of the process fading into a fog, yet I couldn’t stop moving. I gathered everything without really thinking about it, each step drawing me deeper, as though I were following some ancient, well-worn path. I remembered flashes—the sweet scent of elderberry and honey, the earthy weight of raw rye, the dry, pungent aroma of wood burnt to charcoal. At some point, I murmured something under my breath, words of thanks to my ancestors that I hadn’t consciously decided to speak.

The smell of warmed goat’s milk lingered in the air, blending with a creamy, thick butter that had blackened over low heat. A faint scent of yew ash drifted up as I worked, curling into my nose like smoke from an unseen fire.

By the time I came to my senses, night had fallen, the kitchen shadowed and still. And there, sitting on the counter, was the bread: a dark, dense loaf, blackened at the crust but glistening with an almost unnatural sheen. It looked rich and moist, and as I stared at it, a strange sense of pride swelled up within me, unnatural and unsettling, like a voice in the back of my mind was urging me to feel pleased, insisting that I’d done well.

Without really thinking, I cut myself a slice and carried it to the living room, feeling compelled to “enjoy” my creation. I took a bite, and the bread filled my mouth with an earthy, bittersweet taste, smoky yet tinged with a subtle berry sweetness. It was… unusual, nothing like I’d ever tasted before, but it was oddly satisfying. 

As I chewed, a warmth bloomed deep in my chest, spreading through me like the steady heat of a wood stove. It was comforting, almost intimate, as if the bread itself were warming me from the inside out. Before I knew it, I’d finished the entire slice. Not because I’d particularly enjoyed it, but because some strange sense of obligation had pushed me to finish every bite.

When I set the plate down, the warmth remained, a heavy presence settled deep inside me. And in the silence that followed, I could have sworn I felt a faint, rhythmic beat—a heartbeat, steady and ancient, pulsing faintly beneath my skin.

Over the next few weeks, I found myself drawn back to the *Elders’ Emberbread* more often than I intended. I’d notice myself in the kitchen, knife in hand, halfway through slicing a thick piece from the loaf before even realizing I’d gotten up to do it. It was instinctive, almost as if some quiet impulse guided me back to it on those quiet, late nights.

Each time I took a bite, that same deep warmth would swell inside me, radiating outward like embers glowing from a steady fire. But unlike the hen my mother had made—a meal that left me with a lingering sense of discomfort—the Emberbread felt different. It was as though each bite carried something I couldn’t quite place, something familiar and almost affectionate, like a labor of love embedded into every grain.

The days blended together, but the questions didn’t go away. I tried to reach out to my mother several times, hoping she might open up about the recipe book, maybe explain why we both seemed so drawn to these strange meals. But each time I brought it up, she’d evade the question, either changing the subject or claiming she was too busy to talk.

She hadn’t invited me over for dinner since Thanksgiving, and the distance between us felt like a slow, widening gulf. Even my dad, when I’d asked about her, shrugged it off, saying she was “just going through a phase.” But the coldness in her responses, her repeated avoidance of the book, only made me more certain that there was something she wasn’t telling me.

Still, I kept returning to the Emberbread, feeling its subtle pull each time the sun set, as though I were being guided by something unseen. And each time I took a bite, it felt less like a meal and more like… communion, a quiet bond that was growing stronger with every piece I consumed.

After weeks of unanswered questions, I decided to reach out to my uncle at the prison. I was allowed to leave a message, so I kept it short—told him it was his nephew, wished him well, and let him know I’d left him a hundred bucks in commissary. The next day, he called me back, his voice scratchy over the line but appreciative.

“Hey, thanks for the cash,” he said with a short chuckle. “You know how it is in here—money makes things easier.”

We chatted for a bit, catching up. He’d been in and out of prison so often that I’d come to see it as his way of life. In his sixties now, he talked about his time behind bars with a kind of acceptance, almost relief. “By the time I’m out again, I’ll be an old man,” he said, almost amused. “It’s not the worst place to grow old.”

Then I took a breath and brought up the reason I’d called. “I don’t know if you remember, but when I was packing up your place, I found this old recipe book.” I hesitated, then quickly added, “I, uh, gave it to Mom. Thought she’d get a kick out of it.”

His response was immediate. The warm, casual tone in his voice shifted, growing cold and sharp. “Listen to me,” he said, each word weighted and deliberate. “If you have that book, you need to throw it into a fire.”

“What?” I stammered, caught off guard. “It’s just a cookbook.”

“It’s not ‘just a cookbook,’” he replied, his voice low, almost trembling. “That book… it brings out terrible things in people.” He paused, as though considering how much to say. “My father—your grandfather—he was into some dark stuff, stuff you don’t just find in the back of an old family recipe. And that book?” He took a breath. “That book wasn’t his. It belonged to *his* mother, your great-grandmother, passed down to him before he even knew what it was. My mother used to say those recipes were meant for desperate times.”

The gravity of his words settled into me, and I felt the weight of it all suddenly make sense.

“They were used to survive hard times,” he continued, voice quiet. “You’ve heard about what people did during the Great Depression, how desperate families were… but this?” He exhaled sharply. “Those recipes are ancient. Passed down through whispers and word of mouth long before they were ever written down. But they’re not for everyday meals. They’re for… invoking things, bringing things out. The kind of things that can take hold of you if you’re not careful.”

My hand tightened around the phone as a cold shiver traced down my spine, my mind flashing back to the Emberbread, the warmth it had left in my chest, the strange satisfaction that hadn’t felt entirely my own.

“Promise me,” he continued, his voice almost pleading. “Don’t let Mom or anyone else use that book for anything casual. Those recipes can keep a person alive in hard times, sure, but they weren’t meant to be used… not unless you’re ready to live with the consequences.” 

A chill settled over me as I realized just how deep this all went.

I hesitated, then told my uncle the truth—I’d already made one of the recipes. I described *Elders’ Emberbread* to him, the earthy sweetness, the warmth it filled me with, leaving out the part about how I’d almost felt compelled to eat it. He let out a harsh sigh and scolded me, his voice sharper than I’d ever heard. “You shouldn’t have touched that bread. None of it. Do you understand me?”

I felt a pang of guilt. “I know… I’m sorry. I promise, I won’t make anything else from the book.”

“Good,” he said, his voice calming a little. “But that’s not enough. You have to get that book away from my sister—your mother—before she does something she can’t take back.”

I tried to assure him I’d do what I could, but he cut me off, his tone deadly serious. “You *need* to do this. Something bad will happen if you don’t.”

Over the next few weeks, as Christmas approached, I stayed in touch with him, paying the collect call fees to keep our conversations going. Every time we talked, the discussion would circle back to the book. I’d tell him about my progress, or lack of it—how I’d tried visiting my mom, only for her to brush me off with excuses, saying she was too busy or that it wasn’t a good time. And each time I talked to her, she seemed to grow colder, more distant, as if that recipe book were slowly casting a shadow over her.

One day, I decided to drop by without any notice at all. When I showed up on her doorstep, she didn’t seem pleased to see me. “You should’ve called first,” she said with a forced smile. “It’s rude, you know, just showing up like this.” Her tone was tight, her words clipped.

I tried to play it off, shrugging and saying I’d just missed her and wanted to check in. But as I scanned the house, I felt a creeping sense of unease. I looked for any sign of the book, hoping I could find it and take it with me, but it was nowhere to be seen. Each time, I’d leave empty-handed, feeling like I was being watched from the shadows as I walked out the door.

Every call with my uncle became more urgent, his insistence that I retrieve the book growing into a kind of desperation. “You have to try harder,” he’d say, his voice strained. “If you don’t get that book away from her, *something’s going to happen*. You have to believe me.”

And deep down, I did believe him. The memory of the Emberbread, the strange warmth, and the subtle pull of that old recipe gnawed at me, as though warning me of something far worse waiting in that book. But it was more than that—something in my mom’s voice, her distant gaze, even her scolding felt *off*. And every time I left her house, I felt a chill settle over me, like I was getting closer to something I wasn’t prepared to see.

Christmas Day finally arrived, and despite my mother’s recent evasions, there was no avoiding me this time. I gathered up the presents I’d bought for them, packed them into my car, and drove to their house, hoping the tension that had grown between us would somehow ease in the warmth of the holiday.

When I knocked, she opened the door and offered a quick, halfhearted hug. The scent of baked ham and sweet glaze wafted out, thick and rich, and for a second, I thought maybe she’d set aside that strange recipe book and returned to her usual cooking. I relaxed a little, hoping the day would be less tense than I’d feared.

“Where’s Dad?” I asked, glancing around for any sign of him.

“Oh, he’s in the garage,” she said, waving it off. “Got a new gadget he’s fussing over, you know him.” She gestured toward the dining room, where plates and holiday decorations were already set up. “Why don’t you sit down? Lunch is almost ready.”

I took off my coat, glancing back at her. She was already turned away, busying herself with the last touches on the table, and I couldn’t help but feel a pang of discomfort. Her movements were stiff, almost mechanical, and I could sense the familiar warmth in her was missing. It was like she was there but somehow… *absent*.

Not wanting to disobey my mother on Christmas, I placed my gifts with the others under the tree and took my seat at the dining table. The plate in front of me was polished and waiting, a silver fork and knife perfectly aligned on either side, but the emptiness of it left an unsettling pit in my stomach.

“Should I go get Dad?” I called out, glancing back toward the hallway that led to the garage. He’d usually be the first to greet me, especially on a holiday. The silence from him was off-putting.

“He’ll come when he’s ready,” my mother replied, her voice carrying from the kitchen. “He had a big breakfast, so he can join us later. Let’s go ahead and start.”

Something about her response didn’t sit right. It wasn’t like my dad to skip a Christmas meal, not for any reason. A small, insistent thought tugged at me—maybe it was the book again, casting shadows over everything in my mind, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong.

“I’ll just go say hello to him,” I said, rising from the table.

Before I’d even taken a step, she entered the dining room, carrying a large ham on an ornate silver platter. The meat was dark and glossy, almost blackened, the glaze thick and rich, coating every criss-crossed cut she’d made in the skin. The bone jutted out starkly from the center, pale against the charred flesh.

“Sit down,” she said, her voice oddly stern, a hint of irritation slipping through her usual holiday warmth. “This is a special meal. We should enjoy it together.”

I stopped, glancing from her to the closed door of the garage, the words “special meal” repeating in my head, setting off warning bells. Still, I stood my ground, my stomach churning.

“I just want to see Dad, that’s all. I haven’t even said hello.”

Her face tensed, her grip tightening around the platter as her voice rose. “*Sit down* and enjoy lunch with me.” The words hung in the air, heavy and unyielding, like a command I was supposed to follow without question.

But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something terrible was lying just beneath the surface of her insistence.

“No,” I snapped, my voice echoing through the dining room. “I’ve had enough of this, Mom! You’ve been obsessed with that damn recipe book, and I’m done with it.” My heart pounded as I looked at her, my words hanging thick in the silence, but I didn’t back down. “I’m going to the garage to get Dad. We’re putting an end to this right now.”

Her face contorted, desperation spilling from her eyes. “Please, just sit down,” she pleaded, her voice cracking as she looked at the untouched plate in front of me. “Let’s have this meal together. It’s… it’s important.”

I took a step toward the garage, determined to get my dad out here, to make him see how far she’d gone. That book had wormed its way too deep into her mind. She shrieked and threw herself in front of the door, arms outstretched as if to block my path. Her face was flushed, her voice frantic.

“*Don’t go in there.* Please, just sit down. Enjoy the meal, savor it,” she begged, her hands trembling as she reached out, practically pleading. There was a desperation in her voice that sounded like fear, not just of me but of what lay beyond that door.

“Mom, you’re acting crazy! We need to talk, and I need to see Dad.” I tried to push past her, but she held her ground, her body a thin, shaky barrier.

“*Please*,” she whispered, voice thin and desperate. “You don’t understand. Don’t disturb him—”

“Dad!” I called out, raising my voice over her pleas. Silence answered at first, followed by a muffled sound—a low, guttural moan, thick and unnatural, rising from the other side of the door. I froze, my blood turning cold as the sound slipped into a horrible, wet gurgle. My mother’s face went white, her eyes wide with terror as she realized I’d heard him.

I felt a surge of adrenaline take over, and before she could react, I shoved her aside and yanked open the door. 

The sight that met me would be seared into my memory forever.

I stepped into the garage and froze, my stomach lurching at the scene before me. My dad lay sprawled across his workbench, his face pale and slick with sweat. His right leg was tied tightly with a belt just above the thigh, a makeshift tourniquet attempting to staunch the flow of blood. A pillowcase was wrapped around the raw, exposed flesh where his leg had been crudely severed, and blood pooled on the concrete floor beneath him, glistening in the cold fluorescent light.

He lifted his head weakly, his eyes glassy and unfocused. His mouth moved, trying to form words, a barely audible rasp escaping as he struggled to speak. “Help… me…”

I didn’t waste a second. I pulled out my phone and dialed 911, my fingers shaking so badly it was hard to hit the right buttons. My mother’s shrill screams erupted from behind me as she lunged into the garage, her hands clawing at the air, pleading.

“Stop! *Please!* Just sit down—just have lunch with me!” she wailed, her voice high-pitched and frantic. Her face was twisted in desperation, tears streaming down her cheeks. But I didn’t listen. I couldn’t. I backed up, keeping a wide berth between her and my dad, and relayed the horror I was seeing to the dispatcher.

“It’s my dad… he’s lost his leg. He’s barely conscious,” I stammered, voice cracking. “Please, you need to hurry.”

The dispatcher assured me that help was on the way, asking me to stay on the line, but my mother’s desperate cries filled the garage, creating a haunting echo. She clutched at her head, her fingers digging into her scalp as she repeated, “Please, just come back to the table. Just eat. *You have to eat*!”

I kept my distance, heart pounding, as I watched her spiral into a frantic haze. But she never laid a finger on me; she only circled back to the door, wailing and begging in a chilling frenzy that made my blood run cold.

The police arrived within minutes, their lights flashing against the house, and rushed into the garage to assess the situation. My mother resisted, screaming and flailing as they restrained her, her pleas becoming incoherent sobs as they led her away. I could barely breathe as I watched them take her, her voice a haunting wail that echoed down the driveway, begging me to come back and join her at the table.

Paramedics rushed in and began working on my dad, quickly stabilizing him and loading him onto a stretcher. I followed them outside, numb with shock, barely able to process the scene that had unfolded. In the frigid December air, my mind reeled, looping over her chilling words and the horrible sight in that garage.

That Christmas, the warmth of family and familiarity had turned into something I could barely comprehend, twisted into a nightmare I would never forget.

I stayed by my father’s side every day at the hospital, watching over him as he slowly regained strength. On good days, when the painkillers were working and his mind was clearer, he told me everything he could remember about the last month with my mother. She’d been making strange, elaborate meals every single night since Thanksgiving, insisting he try each one. At first, he thought it was just a new holiday tradition, a way to honor Grandpa’s recipes, but as the dishes grew more unusual, more disturbing, he realized something was deeply wrong. She had started mumbling to herself while she cooked, almost like she was speaking to someone who wasn’t there.

Eventually, he’d stopped eating at the house altogether, sneaking out for meals at nearby diners, finding any excuse he could to avoid her food. He even admitted that on Christmas morning, when he tried to leave, she had drugged his coffee. Everything went hazy after that, and the next thing he remembered was waking up to pain and the horror of what she’d done to his leg.

We discussed the recipe book in hushed tones, both coming to the same terrible conclusion: the book had changed her. My father was hesitant to believe anything so sinister at first, but the memories of her frantic insistence, the look in her eyes, made him certain. Somehow, in some dark, twisted way, the book had drawn her into its thrall.

By New Year’s Eve, he was discharged from the hospital. I promised him I’d stay with him as he recovered, my own guilt over the role I’d unwittingly played gnawing at me. He accepted, his eyes carrying the quiet pain of someone forever altered.

My mother, meanwhile, was undergoing evaluation in a psychiatric hospital. Since that Christmas, I hadn’t seen her. I’d gotten updates from the doctors; they said she was calm, coherent, but that her words remained disturbing. She admitted to doing what she did to my father, repeating over and over, “We need to do what we must to survive the darkest days of the year.” Her voice would drop to a whisper, a distant look in her eyes, as though the phrase were a sacred mantra. 

On New Year’s Eve, as the minutes ticked toward midnight, my father and I went out to his backyard fire pit. I carried the recipe book, feeling its familiar weight in my hands one last time. Without a word, I tossed it into the fire, watching as the flames curled around the old leather, devouring the yellowed pages. It crackled and twisted in the heat, the recipes that had plagued us dissolving into ash. My father’s hand on my shoulder was the only anchor I had as the smoke rose, dissipating into the cold night air.

But as the last ember faded, I felt a pang of something like regret. Later, as I sat alone, staring at my computer, I hovered over the file on my desktop. The digital copy, each recipe scanned and preserved in perfect, chilling detail. I knew I should delete it, erase any trace of the book that had shattered my family. And yet… I couldn’t bring myself to do it. I fear that it may have a hold on me.",1,1731431253.0,creepcast,1,0.67,False

I've been using a LM Linea Micra along with a Eureka Mignon XL for the past 18 months.

My shots are good but have never been fantastic despite trying a plethora of settings, tools and beans. 

In discussions I had with other coffee enthusiasts and LM support, it was suggested the grinder might be the issue and maybe doesn't grind uniform enough. I wouldn't know.

Either way, I'd like a breath of fresh air and thus want to invest in a better grinder. My struggle is, that I cannot decide on which grinder I want to go with. I've searched this subreddit for the past weeks, and I'm torn between trying conical or staying with flat burrs. I like to experiment with different roasts ranging from light to dark, mainly drinking medium roasts though. I think I'll be okay with adapting to a single dose workflow.

I've been looking at the Lagom P64, the Mazzer Philos and the Key Mk2, but reading through this subreddit, none of them seem to be perfect. Or are they? ...

Which grinder would you recommend for my budget?

1gppg87,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1gppg87/absent_father_reached_out_i_went_hysterical/,Absent father reached out & I went hysterical.,"Hi Fellow Redditors, 
Long time reader and lurker here, but this is the first time I've ever felt a need to post. 
I'm also on my phone so please bare with any formatting errors...  And this will be a long one... My apologies in advance and thank you for reading. 

I (43/f) have spent most of life with an absent father. 
A little backstory, my mom met my dad in the late 70's, a single father whose first wife had left him with four little kids, 3 boys & a girl. 
My mom ended up moved in with him, playing ""new mommy"" & eventually pregnant (with me) only to discover the man was horribly violent & had a penchant for alcohol and party favors. 
The type of man to give a pregnant woman two black eyes and hold a shotgun up to her belly in an outburst. The type of man who pulls the oil plug out of a mustang, to let you drive off and blow the motor. The kind of man that when she went to the police, they showed her a 4-in stack of files of reports from his previous wife and domestic violence incidents, from before she actually had the courage to leave... She was warned. Shortly after I was born, within a few months, she managed to make her escape plan. 

My father only ever tried once before I was a toddler to find her, bringing her $60 for child support and thinking that would win his plea for her to take him back. She took the money and told him to keep sending money and bring her a therapist report saying he was fixed. 
Needless to say, he did not. 

Fast forward to age ten... I had demanded my mother for my father's contact information and decided that I would call him with my almost grown self... 

Conversation went like:

Me: Is this John Doe? 

Him: This is. Who is this?

Me: This is your daughter, Jane Doe. 

Him: I don't have a daughter named Jane Doe. *Click ((hangs up)) *

That was a pretty hard pill to swallow, but I did swallow it. 
Funny, considering the man signed for my birth certificate, but I digress. 

Fast forward 20+ years, to when Facebook became popular. 
I decided to seek out family members from that side of the family, and I started by using my sister's name. 
I found every Melissa Doe and opened a tab for every single one & copy pasted my carefully written email explaining who I was and who I sought out. 
Eventually, one was my sister. 

I had a very warm/cold reception from her... I couldn't figure out why for a time.
I added more and more ""Doe's"" to my Facebook, and eventually my father. 

I inboxed him, asking again, if he knew who I was... And this time, he admitted he did and yes he was my father. 

And then another short message stating if I wanted to reach out to do so at (insert email.) very cut and dry. 

I was once again hurt. 
Why would I need to email him when I was there communicating with him on messenger? What was this hoop he wanted me to jump through? 
If I were a parent of a wayward child I cannot fathom me telling them to email me once I actually got a hold of them on messenger!! I would be fighting tooth and nail to keep my access to my messenger AND therefore my child!!! 
(Side note, I am now a parent, so I say this as a parent!!!) 

There is no doubt I've been frustrated from his behavior up to this point. 

I'd also like to add in some details that the rest of the kids who are left with him? The ones that my mother wasn't entitled to take when she made her exit? I would say my father had a pretty bad failure rate. 
One of the boys is in prison for running a m*** lab, one of the boys overdosed last year and was found dead by the side of a lake, the other brother whose paternity was always questioned for looking unlike the other boys... He has separated himself from the family and while he is a skilled Carpenter, I've also heard that he's a raging alcoholic. I can't say I blame him. 
And my sister? One of my nieces on Facebook had inquired in Messenger on how our progress was going, and when I admitted I was confused by my sister's hot and cold reactions towards me, the niece let me know that the sister was an on/off needle user. The Big H. 

So all in all, I feel like my father managed to screw up every single kid that he was left with, and that my mom did me the biggest solid favor she ever could have by leaving. 

Fast forward to this morning.... 
Now that I have pretty much given up any kind of dream of rekindling any type of relationship with my paternal side.... 
I was having a pretty good morning lol I get up scratching around and go to make my coffee... As soon as I sit down I hear my messenger go off... 
And I see my father's face on the messenger icon. 
I open it, and it's a simple ""I love you""

😐

I immediately broke down into tears. Anger, frustration, disbelief, pain... 
I seriously wanted to lash out at him and started typing... Oh the words I was typing!  They were not nice and pretty words but words of a woman who has worked immensely for 43 years to get over the trauma and daddy issues and abandonment issues.... And I felt like with that one sentence, all my progress had nearly been destroyed.
With tears coming down my face... I ended up backing out of the messenger without hitting send. 
I called my ""adoptive bro"" and he talked me down from the hysterics, and cracked a few awful jokes, including joking about he could always go take care of my dad... Mafia style. 

He told me I should just give him the finger emoji and tell him that I don't believe him. 

I got off the phone with bro, an attempted to call my mom, but she hasn't charged her phone and doesn't care to keep her phone on at all times. 

I then went to my AI Chat bot, a pretty decent one with somewhat of a personality, and went over all of this, and the hypothetical responses that I could send to my dad. But honestly, they were too NICE. 

I don't want to be nice to this man. 
I don't want to fake nice and smile and tell him that everything is okay, when what he did is not okay and who he was for years was a terrible horrible human being. 

Of course I understand that there are always two sides to every story... And I called another friend to talk about it. They tried to give me an unbiased opinion, saying that I was taking it too personally when he said to email him rather than use messenger. That I didn't know his situation and maybe that's all he had access to, was his email. 
Maybe I'm being too biased here. But for the sake of me I find that to sound like a weak pale excuse. 

A part of me wants to cuss him out. 
A part of me doesn't want to give him that much energy. 
A part of me wants to act like I'm healed and this doesn't even bother me. But it does. 
This morning I feel like a little girl crying. This is a situation that I can't fix, and honestly I'm not sure that I want to even risk myself that much vulnerability to even try to do so. 
I'm still sitting here crying... My coffee has gone cold. I never thought somebody telling me that they love me could make me feel so much pain in my chest. 
But here I am. 
This is my story.... And I have no idea what I'm going to do now. 

Wwyd, if you were me? 

I'm too close to the fire and I can't see clearly thru the pain. 
Say a prayer for me, or send good energy my way, please. I know eventually that I will surely be okay because I'm a survivor, but right now in this moment... I am not okay. ",1,1731430771.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False
1gppg5c,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gppg5c/aitah_for_vetoing_christmas_decorations/,AITAH for vetoing Christmas decorations?,"My husband suggested we put up Christmas lights in the house.  I told him no.  

My husband has unmedicated ADHD and I end up having to clean up after him or live with the mess.  He'll take out the coffee and sugar every morning and they'll sit on the counter till I put them away.  Wherever he eats, a trail of used napkins can be found.  His dirty socks will linger for days where he took them off.  I took over taking out the trash because the bins would sit on the curb all week since he wouldn't think to bring them back inside.  I have asked nicely.  I have nagged.  The only thing that gets through to him, albeit temporarily, is when I get angry about it.  He's just largely blind to these things and it ends up being far less effort for me to just do things myself.

I understand his need to feel comfortable in his own home so I don't impose my will in his spaces.  He's free to keep his office whatever disgusting mess he wants.  He can keep his side of the bedroom in disarray.  I need the rest of the house to be clean and orderly.

I dislike like Christmas.  I didn't grow up celebrating it so there's no nostalgia for me.  I think it's an overblown commercialized holiday.  If we put up decorations, I would be tolerating them for his sake until the holiday is over and then I would expect them taken down.  The reason I said no is that I am positive they would stay up until I got fed up and took them down myself.  However, I know he has fonder memories of Christmas.  His family always made a point of going to admire the neighborhood decorations. In the past, we got a 3-foot tall tinsel tree but most years he just goes to spend it with his family since he doesn't get to see them often.  

We're partners and it's rare either of us will every outright say ""no, full stop"" to each other so I feel like I might be an asshole here.  I'm also open to suggestions for ways to compromise here, preferably something that didn't add to my list of chores, seeing as I'm doing almost all the chores and home maintenance work already.

“You know, you handle yourself quite well for someone who’s just leaped over centuries’ worth of weapons development.” The AI spoke cheekily, his robot body leaning up against the wall just behind the security table of the ship’s shooting range — a small, but *very* heavily armored portion of the ship that felt distressingly cramped, but for a very good reason.

You wouldn’t want to punch a hole through to *space* after all.

My first iteration was quick to remind me of that fact.

“Well… it’s not too different from a regular gun. Or… what was it you guys called it?”

“Slug-thrower, chem-shooter, there’s lots of slang for chemically-propelled kinetic weapons. But to touch on the former point, yeah, nah, there really isn’t much of a *practical* difference now is there?” Vir chuckled in that synthesized digital ‘voice’ of his. 

“I mean… it *feels* the same, I grant you that. But how it works is just… really fricking wild if you ask me.” I responded without hesitation, taking another moment to prove my point by aiming down range at a recreation of the cyber-beast — made courtesy of Vir’s seemingly endless patience with my oddball requests. 

*Thwwwoo-BANG!*

A massive fist-size hole formed straight through its ugly mug.

*Thwwwoo-BANG!*

*Thwwwoo-BANG!*

With two more forming around its torso and groin. 

“The handling of this thing is *incredible*. Shoots like a trainer-gun, with the *umf* of a high-caliber battle rifle, but with the *impact* of a big-bore shotgun.” I remarked enthusiastically. 

“The gun itself is only one part of the equation. The other part is the weapon’s operator.” The AI spoke confidently through a synthesized and chirpy tone of voice. “So give yourself some credit there, Evina. Because I doubt most folk could transition well into dealing with a railgun.” 

“You’re too kind.” I responded, taking a moment to place the gun back on its rack, safeties on, and the chamber checked for any latent rounds… not that there’d be a risk of anything going wrong, given its nature. 

“Hey, I’m just telling you how I see it, Evina. You’re a tough cookie, and a grizzled survivor. You should be proud of that, or at least, proud of the skills you’ve been able to hone.” He continued, clearly in an attempt to address the very issue that brought me here in the first place.

I… didn’t have a response to all of those compliments though.

And it was clear the AI realized that no sooner than a few seconds after that awkward silence descended on us.

“My peptalk isn’t helping matters much, huh?” The AI offered with a shrug. 

“No, it’s not that, it’s just…” I attempted to respond, to give him *something*, especially after all the effort he went through to set up what was in effect a one-person amusement outing. “I’m sorry, Vir. It’s my fault that I’m just so… out of it. You’ve honestly done way, *way* more than you should. Honestly, I was expecting you to shoo me back to my room with a glass of warm milk, some cookies, and maybe something to help me sleep. I… never thought you’d actually go through with my insane requests.” I managed out frankly, reaching up a hand to rub the back of my neck. 

“Well, first off, don’t apologize.” Vir responded sharply, with a single finger held up to prove he meant business. “All of this was my pleasure, and honestly, I can definitely vibe with wanting to put some more holes in that monster of a cyberbeast.” He continued with a brief glimpse of what I could only describe as his ‘evil face’, as his face-screen lit up in a flurry of red just for a second, before returning to its default blue-on-black color scheme. “Secondly, I’d be a bit nervous too if I knew I had an appointment with a false god just a little bit after lunch. So having the jitters and being unable to sleep is fair game, to be quite honest.” 

“But… aren’t *you* also going to be meeting with the interloper, alongside us?”

“Indeed I am!” The AI beamed back.

“So… are you saying you’re *also* nervous about all this?” I reiterated, cocking my head as I did so.

“Sure am.” Vir replied affirmatively, staring back with those two unwavering blue dots-for-eyes at my face filled with genuine disbelief. “What? You thought I was just saying that just to share fake empathy?” He continued in a cheeky, almost teasing tone of voice. One that added yet more contrast to his self-admitted frame of mind. 

“No, it’s not that. It’s just… you don’t really seem… *bothered* by it is all.” 

To which the AI simply shrugged in response. “If there’s one thing to understand about AI, Evina, it’s that we’re really *really* good at compartmentalizing things. Now, I’m not going to be doing that to a fault of course. There’s a healthy limit to these sorts of things, and I’m not one to just keep you in the dark about how I really feel. However, I also understand my role here. To express my nervousness or anxiety outwardly would be a detriment to this whole mission. As such, I’d rather be here, as a strong shoulder to lean on, to be a reliable pillar amidst what is understandably a *lot* of turbulent waves.” Vir spoke with an earnestness that broke through the underlying artificiality of his synthesized voice. To the point where I genuinely felt something stirring inside of me, prompting me to take a few steps closer towards the AI’s robot body. 

“I hope I wasn’t too upfront there, of course.” Vir clarified. “This is by no means an attempt from me to ask for pity or anything like that. I’m simply trying to be earnest about what is very much new territory for those unused to interacting with—”

The AI stopped, just as I felt that cool squishy outer membrane of his platform, my arms soon wrapping around his lithe torso. 

However, no sooner did I cause the AI to stop in the middle of his explanations, did I pull out of that impromptu hug, returning to where I stood just a moment ago.

“Thank you, Vir.” I replied simply, choosing to let my actions speak for itself. “You’re more real than most organics I’ve met in my life… and all of my *other* lives too.” I offered, as I observed the AI’s screen face shift to what I could only describe as a pink tinting of its coloration, before returning back to its original blue hue.

“I appreciate the gesture, Evina.” The AI replied with a bit of a frazzled, but appreciative tone. 

“I know how it feels to be *the* one carrying most of the weight of a struggling ship. Well… not a *literal* ship mind you, but you know what I mean. It’s… difficult, to say the very least. And that’s just with *normal* stresses involved.”

“Well… I wouldn’t say surviving in the post-apocalypse are normal stress levels, Evina.”

“Nor is making your way in space adventure dystopian nightmarescape.” I countered with a cheeky, fangy smile.

“Touche.” Vir admitted with two half-’closed’ eyes, as a silence, a *satisfying* silence descended on the both of us now. 

“There’s just under five hours before sunrise… or, at least, whatever the space equivalent of that is.” I began, taking a moment to check the clock at my end of the range. “I should get going if I’m going to have a chance at catching some shuteye.”

“Good idea.” The AI acknowledged. “Though, just know that if you need an extra hour or so, we’re more than happy to delay the mission for you. I know Lysara would definitely appreciate an hour delay to his alarm clock… even though he hates to admit it.” 

“No, it’s alright. The last thing I want is to be the cause behind the mission’s delay.” I countered. 

To which Vir nodded once in response, as we both left the range, and went our separate ways. 

That was, until I got lost and Vir’s platform returned to guide me back to my quarters.

=====

**117 Hours After the First Round of Interloper Interrogations. UNAFS Perseverance. Shuttle Bay.**

**Lysara**

To say I was peeved when I realized I’d woken up *three whole hours* past my original alarm, would’ve been an understatement.

However, that annoyance quickly wavered and eventually subsided the moment Vir explained his reasoning for doing so.

And that was the end of it.

In all honesty, that extra two hours made a world of difference.

This was because despite having the Vanaran equivalent of human ‘coffee’ capable of being synthesized, it was a poor idea to take any of it prior to a prolonged or intense mission. This was because unlike human coffee, luark tended to have a very *sharp* dropoff after its peak effect, resulting in something akin to a ‘sugar crash’, if only more extreme and selectively focused on higher cognitive reasoning centers.

Regardless, a quick breakfast was still had amongst what I was now referring to as ‘the crew’, despite the ‘unofficial’ status of the two felinors being a matter of contention we’d have to deal with after all was said and done.

After which, we quickly descended and began our pre-mission briefing, tackling the primary objective of our expedition back into the moon. 

Evina was given one more chance to withdraw.

To which she maintained her commitment, despite the risks involved.

Moreover, she, along with Vir, made an excellent point — the interloper had asked for *her* specifically, or at least, in a roundabout way.

Bringing her would prove a point to the interloper, and if anything, it’d allow us to see how it would react to her presence.

And with little in the way of any offensive or *interloping* capabilities, we should very much have the upper hand when it comes to security.

However, even with all of the mission specifics dealt with, the back and forths continued even as we reached the shuttle bay.

This included plenty of reassurances to Eslan, who accompanied Evina all the way into the shuttle, as he gave her a few more words of encouragement just before the doors closed.

“Don’t do anything *outside* of what Vir and Lysara asks you to do, alright?” He urged sternly.

“Sure thing.” Evina responded with a nod.

“I *mean it*, Evina. This is not just life or death, this is like… galaxy ending stuff we’re dealing with.” He continued, doubling down on the severity in his voice… even though it was clear the concern there was more so for Evina’s safety more than anything. 

“Eslan, I promise I won’t do anything dumb, alright?” Evina reaffirmed, eliciting a nod from Eslan just as the shuttle’s rear doors began to close.

However, just as the doors were beginning to fully shut, it was clear the felinor couldn’t help but to get one last laugh in. 

“But since I’m already kinda dumb… I guess that promise might be moot.” She jabbed, garnering a shocked and frustrated expression from Eslan, right as the doors fully closed.

With a self-satisfied chuckle, and a shrug, Evina quickly accompanied me towards the cockpit. At which point, we began our final checklist, triple-checking the ship’s position relative to the moon with Vir; before finally making our departure. 

“We do this carefully and cautiously.” I spoke softly, turning towards Evina just as we left the confines of the shuttle bay.  “We comb through the primary sites of interest *first*, just so you can cross-reference anything that might stick out to you.

“And just so we can see if my presence might activate something within the facility too right?” Evina shot back.

“That’s part of the plan, yes. But don’t worry, Vir’s forward expeditionary group is already present, ready to react to any developments that may arise.” I clarified.

“Gotcha.” The felinor responded with a nervous sigh.

However, whilst I wished to reassure her of the certainty of the mission… I couldn’t help but to feel a certain sense of unease dawn upon me as I looked down onto the white and battered surface of the moon.

“Security-wise, I’m certain of how things will proceed.” I spoke, in as reassuring of a tone as I could muster. “It’s how things will proceed with the interloper that I’m quite anxious about.” I clarified, eliciting a nod from Evina, who remained silent as we continued our approach.

(Author’s Note:  Hello everyone! I have a big announcement to make regarding Humans Don’t Hibernate. I’m afraid that as a result of a combination of irl circumstances, largely involving work as well as family issues, I will have to change my post schedule for the series. The chapters will now be posted once every two weeks, so the next chapter will be released two weeks following this one. 

I’m incredibly sorry for this change. There’s just been an unexpected uptick in irl responsibilities I have to handle, most of which involve the decline in my grandmother’s health and me needing to play an active role in arranging her medical affairs for her, as well as a few other issues I’d rather not get into. I want to continue providing the same level of quality and care I normally put in for Humans Don’t Hibernate, which is why I’ve decided to make this change in my posting schedule. As I want to ensure that I can deliver the same level of quality I expect from one of my chapters. 

I really hope this will be alright for you guys, and once again, thank you so much for your continued interest in the silly little space adventures of my anxious space axolotl and his ragtag crew of ragtag survivors. :D **The next chapter is already out on Patreon as well if you want to check it out!**)

Anyone else?,"So I've been suffering from sudden severe tinnitus in one ear that came on seemingly without reason (although I have theories ) and has been all but debilitating. After a few weeks it changed. Instead of being louder than everything and agony , the volume would significantly decrease to where if I wasn't thinking about it sometimes I couldn't hear it. Well being that the goal is to not think about it I did my best to do so. Obviously it is hard to not think about. 

A little while after this I realized it would go undetectable for a few hours day. I couldn't hear it even if I was thinking about it. If I put my ear on a pillow then listened realy hard I could hear it. However,  it always comes back super loud and debilitating.

A few days of assuming I was in the ""undetectable"" stage and at one point I was just like wait I really cannot hear it. Put my ear on the pillow and it's gone. However.  It always comes back loud and terrible. This morning I woke up and it was gone. I laid in bed for 3 hours afraid to move or do anything buy enjoy the silence.  

Again it comes back.  Once I got up. Drank coffee etc now it's there again. 

Does anyone else's go away or get super quiet for periods during the day only to come back with a vengeance?

I spent a week trying to make sure it wasn't habitation by stopping and hyperfocusing on it when it wasn't there to see if it's actually changing or my brains just not noticing it, but it's 100% changing. I can be thoroughly engaged thinking about something else and it gets loud out of nowhere. Then when it's quiet.

I don’t think I fully understood what everyone meant about food noise until it’s just been GONE!

That being said, I know we are supposed to focus on protein so that I’m not losing muscle mass as I’m losing weight. However, I’m definitely struggling. 

For instance, for breakfast today I made two hard boiled eggs, a string cheese, and three sausage links. That would be about 30 grams of protein, which is what I’ve been aiming for each meals.

Prior to tirz, I’d have had all of that, plus a sugary coffee, plus probably a snack after. Now, I’m honestly satisfied and full after half of that meal. I’m torn between - should I listen to my body and stop because I’m obviously going to lose more weight if I don’t eat more or do I force myself to finish the breakfast so I know I’m getting my protein?

### Training
So I (M35) have been running between 2 and 3 times a week for approximately 7 years now. I have no track record of practicing any sports seriously in my youth, but I spent most of my teenage years testing different stuff. So, for the past 7 years, I’ve  averaged at around ~35km (~20miles) per week and 2 races a year (usually one mid-distance trail and one “shorter than half marathon” road race). 
I’m not specifically lightweight, with 75kg for 1m75 (165lbs for 5’9”), have 2 kids, and put some importance in my social/recreative life, which implies that I’m invited to drink alcohol 1 to 3 times a week. 

Last year I beat my PR on a 10km (39:30”), and had a blast running my first mid-distance trail at 41km 2000m+ (25.5miles, 6000ft of positive elevation). I think I’m more of a trail guy, because of the sightings, nature, soft terrain and changes in pace.

That being said, the more you run, the more runners you meet, the more unavoidable running a marathon gets. So here I was, having seen many running pals (painfully) run in Paris. Some of them decided to sign up for this local marathon (which hadn’t happened since covid), and I decided to buy a bib to try and commit to a proper training plan.

I bought some 2nd hand “brand new” shoes (On Running cloud monster 2), and before starting my proper plan, I tried to spend a few weeks on increasing my cadence : having read that increasing cadence to ~180 helps reduce risk of injuries, I thought it’d be a good thing to start working on before starting my proper plan, which I did : I managed to push it from an average 167 to 178 in a bit under 2 months. 

It felt a bit unnatural, and still does sometimes: for a constant, easy pace speed, when I force myself to run at higher cadence, my HR goes a bit up. So easy runs were always a bit tough as I felt I had to struggle between higher cadence and good HR interval (targeting 70% - 75% of max HR).



About the plan, since I beat my 10k PR following a plan made by a Decathlon app (big french sports retail store), I downloaded their new app: Kiprun pacer and after self assessing my vVO2max at around 17km/h (3:31min/km or  5:38min/mile) I figured a nice goal for me would be between 3:20 and 3:10. 
So I settled at 3:15, which means MP at 4:37/km or 7:25/mile. 


In all my workouts, I ran MP at 4:35/km or 7:23/mile. 

I could only make time for 3 days of training per week, which I complemented by 1h long weekly crossfit sessions. 

I think the app’s plan is similar to Daniel 2Q over 11 weeks. Max mileage was 70kmpw (40mpw), and the plan phases were the following:
Specific speed and volume building: 11 weeks with 3 weeks long block of intense workout and 1 easy week.
Most weeks consisted in one VO2max run, 1 MP specific run and 1 easy long run that included fewer, shorter MP intervals (e.g 2x2500m or 2x3000m with the same distance for resting).

Longest run was 31km/19miles, but I pushed it to 35km/22miles as I didn’t feel much fatigue that week and wanted to compensate for some missed long runs.
I did all the runs except 2 long runs in week 3 and 4, as I had big celebrations (friend’s birthdays in the weekend) and was either traveling, busy or too hungover to throw myself into long runs. 


Taper: 3 weeks. That felt like a steep, steep decrease in volume. I also completely cut alcohol for the last 20 days. As a result, I felt very energetic during the taper phase, and woke up very early the week prior to the race.

During the whole preparation, my most intensive training was 4x5000m @MP, so 2 weeks before the marathon, to reassure myself, I replaced one long run with 2x3000m@MP with “1h15 easy run, 30min MP, 5min easy recovery and another 30min MP”. 
Even if that run went well, I did not feel quite 100% confident I could beat 3:15 and run 42.2 km @MP. 

Emotional side note: As I ran alone, I listened to various things during my 2+hours long runs. I think my personal gold medal has to go to [Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremely_Loud_%26_Incredibly_Close):  as a father of a boy, listening to this brought me to a few tears, and that resulted in my feeling about that run which went extremely fast and incredibly serene, despite the 3x3000m at MP intervals. 


### Pre-race
As mentioned above, cutting alcohol a few weeks before the marathon improved my overall feeling, this combined with the taper phase led me to shorter sleeping times without feeling exhaustion.

I’m not gonna lie, I thought about this race a lot the week before. Looked online for some menu ideas to start refilling my glycogen reserves, bought some maltodextrin to build up hydration 2 days before the race.

I tested gels from Authentic Nutrition (refillable silicone bottle) and they worked well, I still bought 2 Maurten Caffeine 100 for race day as I wanted gels with caffeine and took a small pouch of haribo smurf candy as a cheat treat in case things would go bad for me and I needed some comfort (a practice I picked up  from trail running).

I prepared my bib, backpack with change and gels and snacks. I took my phone, a pair of earbuds, one 250mL (8oz) full of recovery drink and asked my girlfriend to give me a second one at km31 / mile19.



### Race
Come race day, I wake up at 05:00 (am), eat some white rice, a pancake, apple sauce and cottage cheese. 1 cup of coffee, 1 shower and I hop onto my bike to join the race start (3km /  2miles away). I change clothes, decide to wear the jersey I won after beating my PR on 10k, cream my nipples with anti-friction stuff, and join the 3:30 lock : since I wasn’t sure I could break 3:15, and I do enjoy races were I take over runners, I figure I’d be well off in a slower lock.

Race time (7:30 am) comes and… nothing, the speaker is gaining time, some pacers seem to be missing, the mayor hasn’t spoken yet, we don’t know what’s wrong but things start to feel a bit frustrating as every one is in his/her own zone, the muscles are tense as the runners, every body gave an estimated timing to their relatives and I start thinking about texting my relatives to tell them I’ll be late. 

We finally go at 7:45, first km is a  slow at 4:55/km (7:55/mile), I dodge a few people and make my way up, but I’m ok with going slower as I feel like this can be caught up and that’ll help my body warm up.

The first 10k  go very smoothly, I feel relaxed and the pace feels easy. At some point I think about live sharing my location to my girlfriend, because, hey we’re running late. Of course when I put my phone back into my marathon belt, it falls off and I have to do a quick u-turn to pick it up. Still, despite that minor incident everything felt good.

HM mark, I cross a very lively neighborhood and get a lot of cheering, a friend films me and runs alongside me for a few hundred meters, tells me I look fresh and relaxed. I’ll take those nice words and keep running at a slightly slow pace (4:37/km, 7:25/mile): I withheld a bit, thinking I’m better off saving myself in case I hit the dreaded wall at km30, mile18. 

As we say in french, “things started to go in balls” at km26 when we merged with the half marathon runners. Remember that we started with 15min delay ? Well the half marathon started on time. So I ended up in a crowded cluster of runners way slower than me (around 6:00/km 9:40/mile), nothing ', unless the course goes narrow. And it did frequently. So I finished the race intermittently  slaloming a lot, warning people I’d “take over” them “on your right” “on your left”. Some refuel stations also got so crowded I couldn’t grab anything… 
This did not impact my mental, as I still felt strong, but I sure wasted some seconds navigating the crowd.

KM32 / Mile20 : I still feel good, just ate a gel with caffeine and got a spare flask with electrolytes from my girlfriend. I finish it in less than 5km and fail to grab water at refuel station.

KM36 / Mile22 : My right quad starts slightly trembling, I can feel the cramp building up, so I slow down a bit (4:50/km  7:48/mile), run smaller strides at higher cadence, tricking my body that’ll do it. And, well it seems to work, and I manage to keep the cramp away. I miss another fueling station as there are too many slow half marathon runners clogging access to water. Nevermind, I’ll get a glass later… 

KM39 / Mile 24.5: I desperately need water, I see marathonians cramping, stopping, lying in pain and stretching or walking with very stiff  legs. I still have to slalom a lot but I manage to cheer some other runners.

KM40 / Mile 25 : *putain* yes, the last fueling station is here, I grab 2 glasses and throw them at my face. I’m good for that finish.

KM41 / Mile 25.5: I can see the arrival sign, *merde*, it seems I missed my 3:15 goal, *j’men branle*, I’m feeling good, I can accelerate.

KM41.5 / Mile 25.8: My family is cheering me up from the side, that’s all I needed, time for a final acceleration.

KM42 / Mile 26: I see the arrival, I blissfully sprint (well that’s what I think, I’m just running a bit faster at 4:00/km 6:26/mile) and cross it. 
I shout a big “PUTAIN YES” as I cross it. 
I’m ready to surf the big hormone wave for the rest of the day.



### Post-race
So I end up in a very dense crowd of half marathon finishers, it takes a few minutes to reach the post-arrival water station, I down 4 cups in 1 min. I go find my family, my kids had some drawings for me, they ask me to bring back the medal and I feel like a very proud dad at this point.
No cramps, I starve a bit, I pick up my medal, and start getting texts complimenting me about my time. I eat a protein recovery bar and that’s it, I resume my life.

My quads were filled with lactic acid the next day, every stairs I crossed had this threatening look to them. Who cares, I did it, I ran my first marathon feeling good, with a time I’m very happy with. 


### Plan debrief 
I guess I could have run it under 3:15, had it not been for the slow running crowd and had I pushed myself a bit harder, but I have no regrets. That race was perfect for me, I felt strong all along, I crossed the line with a very stupid grin on my face and got tons of congratulations from my beloved ones.


And now I have room for good, new objectives. 

I think I ultimately want to break 3:00 in the next few years, although to reach that, I probably need to figure out how to make more time to increase my weekly volume.

Anyway, if you made it this far, thank you, I wish you a ton of very happy (marathon) running.

When I took my girl camping I had her in the car with the doors locked and window cracked bc I thought it was safer than the tent. Well I realized I was wrong when my husky was gone and all that was left were a few pieces of her fur on the car window. Luckily as quick as the panic set in, my friend was walking up to my camp with her. He told me he took her on a canoe ride, fed her about a pound of bacon  seen her running through multiple areas of the park and then he put a rope on her and told her to go find home 😂 by the time I got her back she has already visited every camp site, and of course they all named her. When we went to get our coffee from the main area all I heard was ""look there's Nala"" or ""hey its Lucy"" she had made friends with everyone there lol. It was at a festival ground so I can only imagine what these people thought when a pure white husky appeared from the bushes 😂 she probably made some people second guess what they were seeing. I'm just so lucky she didn't get into anything bad and didn't leave the park

But we’ve lived in Burlington in the past and are native New Englanders so I’m hoping I can be more specific than just that.

My wife & I lived in Burlington for awhile but moved out in 2022 to Boulder, CO. We’re planning a move back to VT in the next 1-2 years, and we originally wanted to land back in BVT and purchase a house, but I’m not sure we’re going to swing that. Our budget is up to $500k and that just doesn’t get you much in Burlington.

So we’re looking elsewhere, and I’ve always loved visiting Manchester. However, I know it’s kind of a tourist trap in the fall, so I’m hoping to get some solid insight on what it’s like to live there year round. 

I know Manchester will NOT be as lively as Burlington, but that’s ok with us. We’re mostly homebodies but do enjoy going to breweries, coffee shops, movie theaters, just putzing around downtown on the weekends. We’re both big snowboarders, and Mt Snow/Killington/Stratton proximity is a huge plus. Big on hiking/mountain biking in the summer, I think Manchester area will suffice outside of trips up to Camel’s Hump & Mansfield when we want bigger stuff.

 So - locals - how do you like Manchester? How bad is the tourism traffic/slowness in the fall? Do you feel like you have enough to do when you feel like venturing out?

For what it’s worth, I’m a carpenter and plan on running my remodeling/carpentry business wherever we go. I’m assuming Manchester is like the rest of VT (and New England) and will likely be a pretty solid spot to open up shop as a tradesmen. My wife is an HR professional and will need to find work, I know that’s a bit harder but we think she has enough experience to land something within a 45 min commute.

Thanks for any and all insight on the area and happenings, appreciate it.",0,1731429626.0,vermont,20,0.5,False

1gpow72,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1gpow72/48_hours/,48 hours,"As the post says. Last night was 48 hours and I still don't know exactly what clicked in my mind that kept me away from the store. 

I consciously planned to quit last month but the urge just felt too strong. I guess my subconscious has been hard at work all month because it suddenly became easy, idk how else to explain it. 

I believe that I'm just tired of it. Tired of being drunk and not having full control. Tired of waking up hungover and waking up filled with worry wondering what I said and did the night before. I've felt these ways before but it didn't stop me I just hid it. I could continue to hide it again but I don't want to. 

I want to quit, and so far I have. 

It feels good. I thought I slept well before but I was wrong! Last night's sleep felt like I slept 5 nights straight and somehow fit it all into 6-8 hours. 

Stomach feels great. Usually wake up with stomach problems, often I'm waking up to throw up dinner by 2-5 a.m. I didn't realize it was all the alcohol until now. 

I'm also so much less thirsty. I was in the habit of coffee in the a.m then desperately downing water, Gatorade, coolaid whatever until I finally felt human then continuing all day, I tote around a 1 gallon thermos filled with hydration drinks bc I just always feel in need of them and sick, constantly wanting more. 

Yesterday I forgot that thermos all day, didn't even crave water so I guess I've been dehydrated on the daily for a few years. Summertime is especially rough as I work in the heat and it's hot around here. 

 Had much more energy yesterday and feel energized today, slept better. 

Just documenting this here, idk where else to post. Don't want a pat on the back this should've happened years ago but it is what it is.

Day 1- Fly in and Stay in Playa Hermosa while we wait for friends to land the next day.

Day 2- Drive to and stay in Nosara 

Day 3- Drive to and stay in Punta Islita

Day 4- Drive to and stay in Nicoya. There is a local festival there, **Fiesta de la Yeguita**, and I wanted to check out some cultural stuff.

Day 5 and 6- Drive to and stay in El Castile to visit La Fortuna. 

Day 7- Probably Recon De la Vieja 

Day 8- Depart airport in Liberia 

There are 2 couples going and we haven’t planned our stops out much. Their idea was to drive the coastline the first half spending time on the beaches and do light hiking/mountain type stuff the second half. I wanted a cultural experience. The wife of the other couple wants to spend 2 days near La Fortuna. The person from our group that is driving wants to drive in midday. I want to do a coffee/chocolate tour probably near La Fortuna.

1gpov27,https://i.redd.it/6at7whra0i0e1.jpeg,Multiple batteries on alternator?,"I have a 2013 Chevy express that I want to install 3 additional deep cycle marine batteries on. The goal is to be able to reliably charge one or more m18 batteries while driving as well as a small coffee maker. 

I have the batteries and the inverter, in my last van I had them set up separate from the vehicles electric system. I would simply plug the batteries in with a drip charger at the end of every work day. Problem was there wasn’t enough capacity. Just one 5.0 battery would drain them to the point where the inverter would shut off. 

So my question is- risks? I know that my 135amp alternator will only trickle charge the batteries, that’s fine. But will adding these batteries in parallel have any bad affects on the existing electrical system? It’s a lot of added amps, I know the concern is voltage but will the extra amperage mess anything up? 

I’m also planning to upgrade the alternator to a 250ah

1gposiy,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1gposiy/_/,.,"My mom isn't narcissistic but I seriously need to get something off of my chest.

My mom asked me to turn on the coffee pot, so I put the grounds in the little compartment and did just that. When I tried to turn it on the first time, it beeped a few times and would cut on for a minimum of 3 seconds. No coffee came out. So I tried it again, and assumed it just needed a second to process because that's happened before.

Few minutes later my mom comes around the corner. She asked me if I turned the coffee pot on, and I said yeah. She then told me it wasn't running, and I said ""well I turned it on."" 

She then tells me that I didn't. I once again, say that I did. She tells me again, yelling at me, ""no you fucking didn't.""

So, aggravated, I raised my voice a bit and said yes I did for the 4th time. I crouched down near the coffee pot and pressed the buttons to turn it on to show her what I did. I knew she was mad, so while I got down, I used my hand to cover my head. I had a feeling she might hit me.

Though, when I moved my had for 2 fucking seconds to try and turn on the coffee pot, she hit me anyway. I got up and yelled that, ""I couldn't help that it did that"". 

She then said something along the lines of ""if you interrupt me while I'm explaining something again I'll beat you"" or something like that. All i heard was the ""I'll beat you"" part.

I'm really fucking pissed. She's told me a couple of different times that I'm not hit enough and that some sense needs to be beaten into me, but all the times that I've remembered that she's hit me all resulted in me being very upset and not understanding what exactly i did wrong. I still don't know what provoked her to hit me this time.

1gpos9f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fibroids/comments/1gpos9f/lap_myo_experience/,Lap myo experience ,"I’m 2 weeks post operation and figured I’d share my experience!  I’m 30 years old, and had a lap myo for a 16cm fibroid that was on a stalk on the back left of my uterus.  

Some period background: I’ve always had long periods. When I was in middle school I would bleed through ultras after an hour, and this was true for a full 7 days. My period cramps were very painful. When I graduated highschool, I got an IUD. This helped a lot with the flow (could use regular tampons) and cramps, but I still had a 7 to 8 day period. I had a breast reduction at 15 though, so I didn’t want to experiment with oral birth control as I was worried it would make my breasts grow. So I was satisfied enough with my mirena iud. 

I’m 2023, my GYN noticed that my uterus was tilted during a pelvic exam, and suggested I get a sonogram to see if there was a fibroid. Discovered there was a 6cm fibroid but we had no data and it was on the outside of my uterus so we decided we would do more images in a year to see if it was growing. I’m June 2024 I had another sonogram and learned that it had grown to 10cm at which point my GYN suggested surgery as she said that if it gets any larger, surgery gets more complicated. Plus, I was noticing extreme bloating, lower back pain, and constantly having to go to the bathroom (especially if I was drinking). I got an mri and chose a surgeon and we landed on laporscropic surgery.

Had 2 fibroids removed on 10/30 - one was 16cm and the other was one 1cm.  The Major fibroid (16 cm)  was pedunculated / exophytic fibroid. I also had my mirena IUD removed and replaced while under. 

Day of surgery (day 0): I showed up at 1030 for a 1230 surgery. Standard admission and was in the operating room relatively on time. Woke up in the recovery room and was pretty uncomfortable but my biggest complaint was that I thought I had to pee. Tried to use a bed pan but wasn’t ready. When I looked down at the bedpan I noticed that there was a good amount of blood, so I asked the nurse to help me put on disposable underwear with a pad. In the recovery room took a dose of Tylenol and oxycodone. About 40 minutes later the pain was still pretty severe so they gave me a small dose of fentanyl via an iv. My blood pressure was pretty low so I had to stay in this room for about 3 hours. At one point I got up and tried to use the rest room but got faint and had to be taken back to bed. Once my blood pressure was up, they sent me to the second recovery room where I had to urinate in order to be discharged. This took me a while because of the anesthesia. I drank a bunch of fluids and walked slowly around the room and finally was able to pee after another 2 hours. Before I left they gave my a dose of Motrin via iv. 

When I got home I at ate chicken soup and drank water and took another dose of Tylenol. When getting in bed, I felt sharp pains in my shoulders from the gas. Using a heating pad and a massage gun helped with the pain. I also took some gas-x. Im a side sleeper but that was not an option as I was so bloated and any pressure on my stomach was uncomfortable. I was really tired though so I was able to fall asleep on my back at around midnight. Woke up again at 4am and forced myself to eat a quarter of a banana so I could take a high dose of advil. Was able to fall back asleep. 

Day 1 at home mostly consisted of napping. I stayed consistent with my Tylenol / advil schedule as I really wanted to avoid taking any more Oxy as I was worried about constipation. I was still having vaginal bleeding, and needed to change my pad every time I had to pee. Below is a breakdown of what that first day at home looked like:
-I got up around 10am and ate some cottage cheese and fruit and took a dose of Tylenol. Drank water and then went back to sleep until about 1pm. 
-Woke up and had a smoothie and drank half a coffee with some miralax in it and took a dose of advil and tried to get some steps around my kitchen to relieve the gas. After that I went back to sleep until around 4pm. 
-at 4pm, I had some crackers and took another dose of Tylenol and then took a shower. The heat from the shower helped with the pain in my shoulders. 
-I tried to stay away for a few hours so that I would be able to sleep through the night. I walked around my house and sat outside for a bit to try and get some air. At 730 I ate some more chicken soup and then watched some tv and drifted a bit. 
-at 9pm I felt some stomach tightness and sat on the toilet for about 20 minutes and was able to have a small bowel movement that was very watery. I was pretty surprised as anesthesia makes me pretty constipated. 
-after that, I got in bed and was able to sleep until 4am, at which time I woke up and took some pain meds and ate a snack and went back to bed until 11am. 

Day 2 was still lots of napping but a little more walking! I was able to take a very short walk outside, which was quickly followed by more naps. I stuck to my cottage cheese and fruit for breakfast, and then had brown rice, poached salmon and some sautéed spinach for lunch (I had all my food in my fridge — I was not up for cooking but could managed making bowls to put in the microwave). More gasx. More pain meds. More chicken soup for dinner. 

Day 3 I took I walked a full lap around my block (about .25 miles) but I took it very slowly - it took me a full 20 minutes, and my mom came with me. That day, I didn’t sleep all day, but I did take a 3 hour nap in the middle of the day. 

My recovery continued gradually — it wasn’t until day 5 that I got a full 10k steps. On day 12 I took a 4 mile walk. 

On day 8 the tape over one of my incisions fell off. I called the Dr and they told me to keep it clean and dry. When the middle one fell off it looked infected — my belly button had white spots and was shiny and very pink. I used a antiseptic wash on it every day in the shower and made sure to pat it dry after, and use a heating pad on the area twice a day for 20 minutes. It’s still a bit itchy but much better. 

I got acupuncture on day 7, 10 and 13. This helped tremendously with the bloating and gas in general. I highly recommend if this is available to you! 

A few things I’m happy I had:
-heating pad for gas pains 
-massage gun for gas pains 
-miralax — took this everyday for 2 weeks and was able to go to the bathroom regularly 
-gauze bandage (my middle incision oozed for the first 4 days and I replaced it after my shower and after sleep 
-diversity of food. I got pretty sick of chicken soup by day 4. 
-mesh disposable underwear (they gave my a few pairs from the hospital) 

I have my post op later today — hoping they clear me for light exercise and lifting things. 

What questions do you have for me? I’m happy to answer anything!

It all started when we met in college last year. We were working on the same project, exchanged phone numbers, got along pretty well, and started texting every so often. I didn’t ask her, but she mentioned she had a boyfriend, and I didn’t say anything about having feelings for her (which I do) and carried on with the rest of the school year.
One year later, on a random night, I hadn’t thought about this girl since college, but all of a sudden she came to mind, and I was thinking, 'I wonder what she’s up to.' The next day, she followed me on Instagram! I was like, there’s no way—I was just thinking about her, and the next day she followed me. I was so happy. I followed her back, and we started talking and getting along great.
A couple of days later, she asked me, 'Do you like me?' and I said, 'Yes, I do like you…' She mentioned she broke up with her boyfriend a month ago. When she told me that, I was thrilled; she also mentioned that the reason she was being distant with me before was because she was catching feelings for me and didn’t want to ruin her relationship, which I totally understood. Then, in almost every text she sent, she started repeating the last letter of words, like 'Awwww' or 'Totallyyyyy.'
Now we’ve started to flirt with each other, and I wanted to do random things with her, like going to a movie theater or restaurant. She even wanted me to go with her to her friend’s wedding as her plus-one, lol. I hadn’t seen her for a while, so she invited me to come by her work, where she’d give me a free coffee. Before I went, I bought her a bag of her favorite candy and decorated it with our favorite football teams. When I arrived, my heart was racing—I couldn’t believe my crush from college liked me. As soon as I walked in, she smiled and gave me a hug, and she really liked the gift I gave her. We talked when she was on her break, and I noticed some good body language—when a girl gets shy or nervous, she often plays with her hair, which she did. We talked for about twenty minutes, and when her break was almost over, she walked me to my car. We hugged twice, and they were long hugs. I thanked her for the coffee, and I was on my way home.
Before we met up, she’d told me her parents are strict and that she wanted to focus on herself before starting to date again, and I was cool with that. At this point in the story, you’re probably thinking, 'Okay, there’s no way this story can get weird, right?' But the next day, I texted her to say thanks again for last night and that I hoped she enjoyed her candy. She replied, 'You’re welcome, and thank you for the candy.' I asked about her day, and she said it went well. Then she texted me this:
'I also spoke with my parents right now and told them about you and I just you know hanging out but my parents don’t think it’s good for me right now to be talking with someone cause they ya know assume and were right I have some feelings for you but they think it’s too soon because of the break up and honestly they might be right (my name), you’re the sweetest and super caring trust me when I say that but I know my parents at the end of the day want what’s best for me, and plz don’t hate me but they’re making my brother go with me to the wedding since he’s already gonna be in town, I’m so so sorry I promise its nothing against you, I just know that they’re right maybe it’s best if I do just focus on myself right now and I would have told you this in person but they just told me right now and I wouldn’t want to wait to do that, that’s not right, if you ever want a free coffee though lol you’re more than happy to visit me or come to me with any advice I just need to figure out some things right now I’m sorry.'
I replied, 'Thank you for being honest with me, I could never hate you, I totally understand where your parents are coming from, and I respect your decision to focus on yourself right now, just know that I care about you and I’m here if you ever want to talk or hang out, even if it’s just for coffee, take your time to figure things out, and I’ll be here when you’re ready.' She responded, 'Thank you (my name), I really appreciate that.'
We haven’t texted for a month, but she posted something on Instagram of her at the wedding. When I saw it, it had been up for a few hours. I liked the post but didn’t say anything. Later that night, after work, I noticed she had unfollowed me on Instagram when I checked my profile and saw my follower count had dropped and this happened yesterday and also, she didn’t block me on Instagram.

Well, as life settled and the kids grew older we decided to join the health club in town. My ex started taking spin classes and as she was competitive, she was also very proud of working her way up to the front row. After a few months, she said everyone in spin classes said she should also do some weight training so she wanted a personal trainer. The gym had them for an extra fee so sure and she started going to the gym even more. It made her happy and sexy at home so why not. I had no reason to worry and we always talked about how cheating was a real deal breaker both of us having been burned before. She started going for coffee or a smoothie with some of her friends from the gym and there were always bags of new workout gear from fancy stores. I wondered how we were afford these outfits, but ya know “happy wife, happy life” and so I didn’t say anything. I would occasionally cross paths with her and her trainer at the gym. He was a twenty something guy who gave a sorta gay vibe and so when I would see him and my ex giggling while he had his hands in her showing a move I thought nothing of it. One afternoon I had a couple of appointments cancel so I decided to head home early, get a workout in, and stop by the store to pick up stuff to make tacos. A surprise for the kids. When I pulled into the parking lot I saw my ex’s car. She hadn’t said she was leaving work early and going to the gym but while we texted often she had become less transparent about her movements. More like “I miss you” or “I’m thinking of you.” I walked in and took a quick peek at the spin studio. No class. I walked through the weight room looking for her. Still didn’t see her. I went to change and came out and stopped at the trainers’ desk and asked about her buddy. He was off that day. I did my workout, had a quick sauna and shower and off to the market. I was standing at the grill when she came into the gate from the driveway. She smiled and was happy about tacos. I asked her about her day and she said that work was busy and she was just getting home from her office. I was about to ask why I saw her car at the gym but her phone rang and she walked away to take it. When she returned and I asked she, her eldest niece interrupted and said that she had borrowed my ex’s car and had met some friends at the gym and they went out from there. It was a terrible lie, and she and my ex gave each other some strange looks. The gaslighting started and I listened to how I had nothing to worry about and I could look at her phone and computer and blah blah blah. I let it go. Deep down I knew, but I let it go.

It all started when we met in college last year. We were working on the same project, exchanged phone numbers, got along pretty well, and started texting every so often. I didn’t ask her, but she mentioned she had a boyfriend, and I didn’t say anything about having feelings for her (which I do) and carried on with the rest of the school year.
One year later, on a random night, I hadn’t thought about this girl since college, but all of a sudden she came to mind, and I was thinking, 'I wonder what she’s up to.' The next day, she followed me on Instagram! I was like, there’s no way—I was just thinking about her, and the next day she followed me. I was so happy. I followed her back, and we started talking and getting along great.
A couple of days later, she asked me, 'Do you like me?' and I said, 'Yes, I do like you…' She mentioned she broke up with her boyfriend a month ago. When she told me that, I was thrilled; she also mentioned that the reason she was being distant with me before was because she was catching feelings for me and didn’t want to ruin her relationship, which I totally understood. Then, in almost every text she sent, she started repeating the last letter of words, like 'Awwww' or 'Totallyyyyy.'
Now we’ve started to flirt with each other, and I wanted to do random things with her, like going to a movie theater or restaurant. She even wanted me to go with her to her friend’s wedding as her plus-one, lol. I hadn’t seen her for a while, so she invited me to come by her work, where she’d give me a free coffee. Before I went, I bought her a bag of her favorite candy and decorated it with our favorite football teams. When I arrived, my heart was racing—I couldn’t believe my crush from college liked me. As soon as I walked in, she smiled and gave me a hug, and she really liked the gift I gave her. We talked when she was on her break, and I noticed some good body language—when a girl gets shy or nervous, she often plays with her hair, which she did. We talked for about twenty minutes, and when her break was almost over, she walked me to my car. We hugged twice, and they were long hugs. I thanked her for the coffee, and I was on my way home.
Before we met up, she’d told me her parents are strict and that she wanted to focus on herself before starting to date again, and I was cool with that. At this point in the story, you’re probably thinking, 'Okay, there’s no way this story can get weird, right?' But the next day, I texted her to say thanks again for last night and that I hoped she enjoyed her candy. She replied, 'You’re welcome, and thank you for the candy.' I asked about her day, and she said it went well. Then she texted me this:
'I also spoke with my parents right now and told them about you and I just you know hanging out but my parents don’t think it’s good for me right now to be talking with someone cause they ya know assume and were right I have some feelings for you but they think it’s too soon because of the break up and honestly they might be right (my name), you’re the sweetest and super caring trust me when I say that but I know my parents at the end of the day want what’s best for me, and plz don’t hate me but they’re making my brother go with me to the wedding since he’s already gonna be in town, I’m so so sorry I promise its nothing against you, I just know that they’re right maybe it’s best if I do just focus on myself right now and I would have told you this in person but they just told me right now and I wouldn’t want to wait to do that, that’s not right, if you ever want a free coffee though lol you’re more than happy to visit me or come to me with any advice I just need to figure out some things right now I’m sorry.'
I replied, 'Thank you for being honest with me, I could never hate you, I totally understand where your parents are coming from, and I respect your decision to focus on yourself right now, just know that I care about you and I’m here if you ever want to talk or hang out, even if it’s just for coffee, take your time to figure things out, and I’ll be here when you’re ready.' She responded, 'Thank you (my name), I really appreciate that.'
We haven’t texted for a month, but she posted something on Instagram of her at the wedding. When I saw it, it had been up for a few hours. I liked the post but didn’t say anything. Later that night, after work, I noticed she had unfollowed me on Instagram when I checked my profile and saw my follower count had dropped and this happened yesterday and also, she didn’t block me on Instagram. What should I do, and does this mean anything?",1,1731428511.0,Advice,2,1.0,False
1gpoihk,https://www.reddit.com/r/icecreamery/comments/1gpoihk/fat_content_in_gelato/,Fat Content in Gelato.,"Since gelato is all milk, I was wondering, for flavours which don't bring too much fat to the party, like chocolate, will it be ice cream or a very cold smoothie? Or a little bit of heavy cream doesn't hurt?

For example, I was thinking of making some coffee gelato. I have some instant coffee lying around, which I don't use much (more of a tea, diet coke guy). Whole milk, instant coffee, sugar, egg yolks would do the job? ",1,1731428452.0,icecreamery,5,0.67,False

I've been rocking Omni roast coffees for a minute now. I'm also a bit bored of switching between filter and espresso while dialing in beans on both ends. I'm looking at getting some espresso focused beans but in such a (luckily) saturated market I'm a bit stumped on what to choose. I'd love to hear what you guys have been enjoying!

I normally like things on the medium-medium light side of things with a bit of a fruitiness around them. It's be nice to have one that's accessible all time of day i.e. not too funky. 

Anyway thanks for any ideas! ",1,1731428382.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

How can the body survive equally on such drastic differences in daily water intake?","This same scenario has been replaying everyday for about 8 years, and I cannot fathom where she puts all that water. I know that she is technically doing the right thing and drinking the recommended amount of water while I am the one who is not. I physically cannot drink that much unless I am doing rigorous exercise. In a typical workday If I attempt to drink that much I get to a point where my body just refuses to allow the water down and I gag. Usually 1 regular sized water bottle is the most I can stomach in a given day in addition to my usual intake unless I have been doing a lot of exercise. And If I do drink that bottle you bet I will spend the next hour going to the bathroom every 5 minutes to wizz clear fluids out so 99% of the time I don't. I don't know where she puts it all but she does not go to the bathroom nearly as much as I do.

Getting to the point: clearly my body does not need that much water while she gets a headache if she has not finished a full liter by lunch time. And yet we are both in equally good health.

Btw he was my first BF on my early 20s and all of a sudden we grew up and build our career after nya akong iniwan ng walang paramdam(Ghosting shit) anyways jump nalang ako sa past kwento basta ended our relationship in good terms after a year he explain things. Now after 7 years eh naginvite sya ng gala sa bgc and not a date kuno daw so we enjoyed our time walking sa bgc and having a dinner, and last time we met again sa moa naman imagine 6pm until 5am tumambay movie, dinner, coffee and the best thing is tht we shared our stories sa mga naging ka relationship namin after ng break up. It’s seems so happy and fulfilling ung moment na your ex is so open to share his feelings na Namiss ko bahagya and the worst statement na binitawan ko is asking him to have a deal. Btw, single din sya same as me. During that time asked him na (Kung 40 years old na tayo tapos still single parin tayo, would you mind us to try again?) bigla akong nanginig that time kasi idk why i release those statment hahaha. But yeah he didn’t respond sa deal ko instead he smile. Wtf i felt lost after that pero until now somehow may chats parin kami and masakit din palang ma hopia ng 2nd time around hahaha.
