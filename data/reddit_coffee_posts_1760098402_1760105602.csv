She thought that I took advantage of her because I would ask for help regarding studies and notes.I thought that the other girls would still want to hang out with me without the first girl present. That didn't happen. I had texted another girl from the same group if she wanted to go out grab a coffee and she said I'll think about it and tell you. She never texted back. Then comes the third girl who i think did the most damage. She agreed to go out with me and told that the other two girls would talk behind my back in a very offensive way. She told me that she wanted to cut them off and that she will hang out only with me from now and then. I've trusted her and told her my side of the story. After all that she ghosted me and I saw her outside with the other two girls. I felt like a complete idiot for trusting her in the first place. As a result I spent the last year of my university without any company and inside my house feeling lonely. I wonder now what I could have done differently and if everything that happened was my fault. I tried to hang out with others but it didn't lead anywhere. Is is that hard to find new friends nowadays.,1,1760105431.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

by Preston Dennett

All UFO encounters are interesting, but perhaps the most fascinating is when UFOs land and humanoids come out! Here are ten cases of UFO landings from across the world including the United States, Brazil, Australia, Italy, Spain, Norway, Finland, Scotland, France and England. They span over a period of five decades. They involve a wide variety of humanoid figures. Many are multiple witness cases. Almost all of them involve some form hard evidence such as landing traces, animal reactions, electromagnetic disturbances, psychic effects and physiological reactions. Some include government involvement and even disturbing threats from apparent men in black.

JUL 23, 1947, PITANGA BRAZIL: Topographer Jose C. Higgins hears a high-pitched hum. Suddenly a metallic craft lands next to him and out come three beautiful ETs wearing weird spacesuits. Jose founds himself surrounded by them. To his relief, they appear to be friendly. Feeling fear, he retreats and watches them from a distance as they begin playing like small children.

AUG 1960, NEWCASTLE, NSW AUSTRALIA: Helen Aldridge is awakened by a buzzing noise coming from outside her home. Looking out the window, she sees a craft shaped like a toy top landing in her backyard. Out steps a humanoid dressed in an olive-green jumpsuit. To her shock, it climbs over her fence and approaches right up to her window.

JUL 31, 1966, PRESQUE ISLE STATE PARK, PA: When their car gets stuck in the sand, Gerald LaBelle goes for help, leaving behind Betty Klem, Doug Tibbets, Anita Haifley and her two children. Without warning, a UFO lands in the forest next to them. Police arrive and leave with Doug to investigate. At this point, a huge hairy humanoid emerges from the forest and attacks the car. Before long officers from Project Blue Book arrive to investigate.

AUG 29, 1967, CUSSAC, FRANCE: When 13-year-old Francois Delpeuch and his little sister Ann-Marie (age 9) go to retrieve the family cows, they come upon a huge glowing sphere and four small humanoids walking around beneath it. When they approach for a closer look, the strange beings notice the two children and begin floating one by one back into the craft.

FEB 5, 1971, KINNULA, FINLAND: Two forestry workers (Peter Aliranta and Esko Sneck) get the shock of their lives when a UFO lands next to them in the forest. A small 4-foot-tall being emerges and approaches Peter. When the being turns around to enter the craft, Peter rushes forward and grabs the ET by the foot. It’s a decision that he will regret for a long time.

NOV 14, 1976, WINCHESTER, ENGLAND: Joyce Bowles is driving home. Her friend Edwin Pratt is in the passenger seat. They are concerned to see a UFO dropping down from the sky ahead of them on the road. Suddenly their car steers itself off the road. When they finally get it to stop, they see a UFO blocking the roadway and humanoids looking out the windows at them. Then one emerges from the craft, walks right up to them and stares at them fixedly. Their strange adventure has only begun.

MAY 18, 1977, ELGIN, SCOTLAND: Karen McLennan and Fiona Morrison (both 10-years-old) are playing near their homes when they hear a soft humming noise in the woods. They go to investigate and come upon a landed craft. Standing next to it is a tall slender man dressed in a silvery jumpsuit. As the man walks towards them, the girls flee. When they turn around, they see the craft flying off. But when they get home, they learn there are more witnesses. And then the threats start coming in.

SEP 18, 1978, SAN GIORGIO DI NOGARO, ITALY: Railway employee Giorgio Filiputti only wants to enjoy a quiet day of fishing. But it’s not to be. He hears a strange noise and an odd breeze. Going to investigate, he comes upon a landed craft. A weird 4-foot-tall humanoid looks surprised to see Giorgio approach. He stares at Giorgio and begins to work on apparently repairing his craft.

NOV 24, 1978, GERENA, SPAIN: When four young men go hunting along the Guadiamar River, they get a lot more than they bargained for. Seeing strange lights in the forest, they come upon a landed UFO and a 7-foot-tall humanoid. The strange figure starts walking towards them. When it gets too close, the men run away in a panic. Later, strange land-traces are found.

JUL 25, 1981. STJORDAL, NORWAY: Hjordis Hokstad wants only to enjoy her morning coffee and watch the wild deer in the field behind her house. Instead she sees a landed UFO and a weird humanoid wearing a spacesuit walking around the craft. She grabs her binoculars and gets a nice close look. Little does she know, her neighbor is watching the whole thing from his house.

There is no more room for denial. The evidence for the reality of UFOs and extraterrestrials is here for those with the courage to examine it. We are not alone! We are only one of many different humanoids in a universe teeming with intelligent life.

1o31xt8,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1o31xt8/finding_inspiration_in_everyday_moments/,Finding Inspiration in Everyday Moments,"Lately, I’ve been reflecting on how inspiration can strike in the most unexpected places. It’s easy to think of inspiration as something grand or monumental like a perfect sunset or a powerful speech. But I’ve come to realize that it often hides in the mundane moments of daily life.

For instance, the other day, I was sitting in a café, sipping my coffee, when I overheard a conversation between two strangers. They were discussing their dreams and fears, and their honesty struck a chord with me. It reminded me that everyone has their own struggles and aspirations, and that connection can be incredibly inspiring.

I also find inspiration in nature. A simple walk through my neighborhood can reveal so much beauty a blooming flower, a child laughing, or even the sound of rain. These little moments remind me to appreciate the world around me and to find joy in simplicity.

Another source of inspiration for me is literature. Books have a unique way of transporting us to different worlds and offering new perspectives. I recently read a book that challenged my thinking and inspired me to take action toward a personal goal I had been putting off.

I believe that inspiration is all around us if we take the time to notice it. Whether it’s in a conversation, a walk in the park, or a good book, these moments can spark creativity and motivate us to pursue our passions.

What are some everyday moments that have inspired you? I’d love to hear your stories and how you find inspiration in your life!

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1o31mio,https://www.reddit.com/r/RTalk/comments/1o31mio/why_does_no_one_want_to_have_fun/,Why does no one want to have fun?,"Before I begin this rant of sorts, I have a few disclaimers.
- this is not in regards to politics. I think the state of everything right now warrants discussion that is inevitably not “fun” and it is an important thing to discuss seriously.
- I am going to mention going out on the town, drinking, etc and I know that a lot of the reason people aren’t doing that as much is the cost of everything and so that is not what I’m talking about exactly either.

Rant:
I (20,F) have been so bothered recently because I feel everything is taken so seriously and everyone takes themselves too seriously. I see that guy who does subway interviews talk to people that discussed how everyone is over-therapizing themselves and, as someone who wants to go into mental health psyc myself, I agree! I think spending every waking minute, as I often do, thinking about why I do the things I do and how my parents contribute to my behaviors + thoughts now, how I can seemingly never do anything right, and constantly trying to figure everything out is honestly not extremely helpful. I don’t think it’s something to NEVER think about, self reflection is vital, but I just am tired of myself and others being at a fun event and all of a sudden someone’s upset because there was a cat in the movie we were watching and they had a cat that died 14 years ago. 

I know I risk sounding super insensitive and rude but it’s not that you can’t be sad and that you can’t be randomly triggered or upset by old feelings, but at least in my life I feel like it’s getting to a point of being harmful to ourselves! I was at a mixer for a fun club I’m in and all of a sudden I wanted to go home and I FINALLY talked myself out of it and was able to stay! I kept thinking over and over again that everyone must think I’m weird, and I’ve “never” had true best friends that I can be myself around, and that this must be because my mom is socially anxious and I learned to monitor myself from her. For the first time in a long time, I went into the bathroom for two minutes and was like LOCK IN oh my god, you feel like you don’t have friends because you leave every party or hangout early, go home and watch a movie by yourself. I love alone time, don’t get me wrong. But this reminds me of that quote that’s like “to have a village you need to be a villager”, and frankly I’m not because I so often start analyzing every reason I’m “innately” not good enough and should just bail. 

I notice some of my friends doing this too. We will be having a great time, about to leave for a party or about to go to the movies, and someone starts mentioning how their parents being divorced is to blame for their bad grades (this is an example). I think that this level of analyzing our behaviors and connecting everything makes us completely unable to live in the moment and I notice I’m never really present because of this third person therapist view I hold. Additionally, nothing can ever just be not that deep! Everything has to have some meaning and sometimes it’s just like dude I didn’t buy a new top I didn’t need because I’m empty inside, I just wanted a new top. And even if it was because I was feeling empty inside, there is a time and place to analyze that. Therapy, which I love and am so privileged to have access to. Or talking at a coffee shop or on my porch at a random time. Not at a pregame with a party of people. Me and my friends have struggled with mental health so I TRULY get it and I do it myself! But I think we would all benefit from “being stupid” At some point or another. Sometimes I even seek out people different from me so I can have a night where i hear them talk about Sabrina carpenters new album and what new video game they are playing so I can separate myself from this constant analyzing me and my other friends do of ourselves! I wanna play a game and get drunk im 20! We can talk about our parents divorce tomorrow.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

1o31kt7,https://www.reddit.com/r/EverydayAppliance/comments/1o31kt7/explore_if_the_best_electric_kettle_cuisinart/,Explore if the best electric kettle Cuisinart PerfecTemp is worth it,"Cuisinart has built quite a reputation with its kitchen appliances, and their Cuisinart CPK-20 kettle definitely piqued my interest. As someone who relies on a steady stream of tea and coffee throughout the day, testing out an electric kettle with programmable features sounded too good to pass up. After all, having a device that promises precise steeping, customizable settings, and quick heating seemed like the perfect upgrade to my morning routine.

**Design and Build Quality**

Right off the bat, the first thing I noticed was its polished stainless-steel design. Not only does it look sleek sitting on my kitchen counter, but it also feels sturdy and well-made. The BPA-free material and stay-cool nonslip handle were a welcome touch, especially when handling hot water during busy mornings. At just 1 pound, it was surprisingly lightweight considering its polished finish and 1.7-liter capacity. The inclusion of a blue backlit LCD display added a modern vibe, and I quickly fell in love with how intuitive the controls are. 

[Check Cuisinart CPK-20 price on Amazon.](https://ikerz.com/p/b0cfvmd7r7/)

**Ease of Use**

Using this kettle is straightforward, and it's evident Cuisinart put thought into making it user-friendly. With six temperature presets for different types of teas or beverages, I found myself brewing green tea with a specific setting, while coffee required a different one. You can even adjust the temperature manually from 71°C to 100°C, which is a great option for people who prefer a bit more customization. I appreciated the audible ready tones that signaled when the water reached the selected temperature—no more guessing or waiting around unnecessarily. 

**Speed and Performance**

Brewing speed can often make or break your experience with an electric kettle, and in this case, it delivers. The 1500-watt power heats a full 1.7 liters of water surprisingly fast. It made getting my morning coffee or steeping an after-dinner herbal tea convenient and efficient, especially on days when time was scarce. The Keep Warm function stood out to me as it managed to maintain the desired temperature for 30 minutes. That came in handy when I got caught up with meetings and could still enjoy hot water when I returned. 

**Advantages**

- Sleek stainless-steel design with user-friendly controls
- Quickly heats up to 1.7 liters, great for busy households  
- Six precise temperature presets that cover tea, coffee, and more  
- Customizable temperature adjustments for specific preferences  
- Keep Warm feature maintains the desired temperature for 30 minutes  

**Negatives**

- The polished finish, while elegant, shows fingerprints easily  
- Audible tones could be louder for larger spaces  
- Lack of water level visibility inside the kettle without opening it  

**Other Options**

When comparing it to other popular electric kettles like the Breville IQ Kettle or the Fellow Stagg EKG, this one finds its middle ground. Breville’s model offers a larger capacity and faster heating times, but at a significantly higher price point, making it less approachable for casual users. On the other hand, the Fellow Stagg kettle focuses on pour-over precision, which might be overkill for someone just looking to make tea. The practicality of the Cuisinart kettle, combined with its balanced features, gives it a solid edge in usability without overcomplicating things.

**Smart Spending**

Without going into the exact pricing, I’d say this kettle offers solid value for its features and performance. Competing kettles that come close in functionality often have price points that might stretch the budget, which makes this a more practical investment. You’re getting design, precision features, and versatility without feeling like you’ve splurged unnecessarily. For anyone who drinks multiple types of beverages or simply enjoys customizing their brewing experience, it feels worth the expense.

1o31kew,https://www.reddit.com/r/microsaas/comments/1o31kew/building_a_micro_saas_still_in_dev/,Building a Micro SaaS (STILL IN DEV),"Ever stare at your phone pics of that killer coffee blend or those fresh salon vibes and think, ""Fuck, these need to pop on IG or TikTok without me dropping a grand on some agency""? Yeah, me too. That's why I built this nano banana-powered SaaS beast: turning your raw, unfiltered product shots into scroll-stopping UGC ads that feel real, not robotic.

**What I do:** Drop me 3 quick product photos (your latte art, haircut glow-up, gym gear flex – whatever), and in under 24 hours, I crank out 3-5 polished variants. We're talking background swaps to match your vibe, scene-matched edits that scream ""lifestyle,"" text overlays that don't look like ass, plus a couple short video clips to hook 'em. All exported at prime sizes: 1080x1350 for IG Stories/Reels, 1080x1920 for TikTok domination.

No cookie-cutter bullshit – it's all prompt-edited magic via nano banana, so it stays authentic to your brand without the Photoshop headache. Small brands like you (cafés slinging brews, salons turning heads, gyms building beasts) deserve ads that convert without the corporate gloss.

**Pricing?** Straight-up fair: AU$60-150 per set, depending on the tweaks. But heads up – no buy buttons here. This ain't Shopify; it's bespoke. Hit my DMs with a quick ""yo, quote me"" and your niche, and I'll shoot back a custom breakdown. Hell, to prove it, I'll even whip up **one free sample edit** from your pics – just to show you the glow-up.

Who's in? Local spot owners, drop a comment or slide into those DMs. Let's make your feed fire without the FOMO.

1o31iwd,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1o31iwd/someone_spoke_to_me_through_my_airbnb_intercom_in/,Someone spoke to me through my Airbnb intercom - in my own voice.,"I collapsed onto the couch, exhausted. My feet ached in the damn dress shoes—I’d been standing in them all day at that stupid conference. I’d only arrived in the city yesterday, but since getting off the train, it felt like the endless event had swallowed my entire life.

All I wanted was to eat something and finally get some sleep. At least the Airbnb I’d booked was comfortable—quiet, calm, a decent place. I headed to the kitchen, remembering I’d left a sandwich in the fridge that morning.



But as soon as I got up from the couch, the intercom buzzed.

The building I was staying in was five stories tall, and the only way inside was through the front gate downstairs.

I shuffled over and picked up the little white handset that played that familiar tinny melody.

  


“Finally!” said a familiar voice. “Listen to me, right now—”

  


“Who is this?” I snapped, irritated.

  


“Shut up and listen, Hank!” the voice cut me off, tense and urgent.

  


I froze.

It wasn’t just that the voice knew my name - it was my voice.

  


“What the hell is this?” I barked. “Who’s messing with me? Why do you sound like me?”

  


“Shut the fuck up, Hank!” my own voice screamed through the speaker. “We don’t have much time, so listen!”

  


My breath caught in my throat. My own voice was yelling at me—like a second version of myself was on the other end.

  


“Hank, listen carefully,” it continued. “Don’t let anyone in. Got it? No matter who knocks, no matter what they say—don’t open the door. Understand? This is important!”

  


“What are you talking about? Who are you?” I asked, my voice trembling.

  


“That doesn’t matter right now!” it snapped. “Just don’t let anyone in!”

  


And then the line went dead.

Silence.



I stood there, holding the receiver in my hand. The room was completely still.

It was my own voice that had spoken to me.

But… how?

  


I paced back and forth in the living room. Who the hell had that been on the intercom?



I looked out the window, but the street below was empty. Not a single soul in sight—just darkness and fog thickening in the late-night silence.

Should I call the police? I thought about it. But what would I even tell them—that someone had talked to me in my own voice? They’d think I’d lost my mind.

But that wasn’t what really scared me.

What scared me was that the voice had warned me—like it had genuinely tried to save me.



Then, suddenly, a loud knock rattled the door. I flinched, staring wide-eyed at the entrance.

I didn’t say a word. I didn’t even dare breathe.



Then again—knock, knock, knock!—louder this time.



I crept closer to the door, meaning to peek through the peephole. But before I could, a heavy pounding shook the apartment.

My heart slammed in my chest, and sweat started rolling down my forehead.

  


“Hank… please, open up,” said a voice from the other side of the door.

  


I froze. Sweat trickled down my back, my hands trembling. That voice—it was mine.

  


“Hank, I know you’re in there,” my voice said again. “Please, open the door. We have to fix this.”

  


I couldn’t speak. I just stood there, frozen in my dark-blue suit jacket, my throat bone-dry.

  


“Hank, don’t fuck with me,” the voice growled, angrier now, pounding again and rattling the handle. “Open the goddamn door! I know I told you not to—but this is different! This is the only way!”

  


“No!” I yelled back. “Get the hell away from here, whatever you are!”

  


“Jesus Christ, Hank, don’t be stupid!” my own voice shouted from the other side.

  


“Fuck you!” I screamed. “I’m not opening it!”

  


The next moment, the door shook violently— as if someone were kicking it full force, again and again, until I thought it would burst from the frame.



And then… silence.

One last thud—and then nothing.



I waited, hoping a neighbor might come check on the noise. But no one came.

  


I sat on the couch, nervously rubbing at the stubble on my chin. I’d already taken off my jacket—only my sweaty, wrinkled white shirt clung to me.

I had no idea what to do. What the hell was going on? What did those voices want from me?



Then it hit me: if not the police, maybe I could at least message the Airbnb host—tell them someone was screwing with me.

I jumped up from the couch—and in that exact moment, a cold, crawling feeling ran down my spine.



That’s when I realized all my stuff was gone.

No suitcase, no work laptop, not even my phone—the one I’d set down on the coffee table after getting back from the conference.

I tore the place apart in a panic. Checked the kitchen, the living room, the bathroom—nothing.

  


“Impossible,” I muttered. “It was all right here…”

  


I hurried back to the living room, hoping at least my briefcase—with the company documents—was still there.



But then something much worse happened.

A sharp click broke the silence—the sound of the front door’s deadbolt turning.

Then I heard it slowly creak open.



The blood drained from my face. Someone was out there—and now they were coming in.



Panicking, I slammed the living room door shut and dove beside the bed. My chest felt like it would burst, my heartbeat hammering in my ears.

From the outer room came the sound of footsteps—shoes tapping against the kitchen tile.

Then a dragging noise, like something heavy being pulled across the floor… toward the living room.

  


“Where the hell did I put my wallet…” a voice muttered.

  


I froze. That voice… was mine. My own voice was talking to itself out there.

My eyes darted around, searching for any way out. Then I saw it—the fire escape outside the window.

That would be my way out.



I lunged for the window, shoved it open, and climbed out into the cold night air. My shoes clanged against the metal as I raced down the fire escape, heart pounding, lungs burning.

I reached the last ladder leading down into the alley—and kicked it loose beneath me.

But before I started climbing down, I looked back—just once—toward the apartment window.



And I saw it.



Someone was standing there. Leaning out of the window. Watching me.

I couldn’t see the face—only the outline, staring down at me.

And then terror hit me so hard, I lost my balance, and fell.



Down into the dark alley below.

  


I came to, dizzy and disoriented.

I couldn’t have been out long—it was still pitch-black. Or maybe it was the adrenaline that yanked me back so fast.



I pushed myself up from the cold, wet ground of the alley and rubbed my forehead.

I didn’t wait—I started moving right away toward the exit that led out to the street beside the building I’d escaped from.



The night was cool, the air damp, the wind barely stirring. The city felt completely dead—only a few streetlights flickered in the distance.

I looked around desperately, hoping to see someone—anyone. But the street was empty.

No one there.



No one… except one figure.

Across the street, a man stood motionless. His clothes were torn and filthy, his hair long and greasy, his face half-hidden behind a rough beard.



I had no idea who he was. But when the light caught the blade in his hand, my stomach clenched tight.

He didn’t say a word. He just stepped off the curb, straight into the road—coming right toward me, not even looking around.



That was all I needed to see. I ran.



Back into the alley, toward the opposite end where a faint light glowed between the buildings.

I ran as hard as I could, lungs burning, heart pounding so loud I could barely hear my own footsteps.

But when I burst out of the alley… everything inside me froze.

I was back where I’d started.



Right in front of the Airbnb building I’d just escaped from. The same street. The same houses. The same empty silence.

Only now, a taxi was parked in front of the building, and a man was stepping through the front gate.

  


“Wait!” I shouted after him as the cab began to roll forward. “Wait—please! Help me! Someone attacked me!”

  


The driver didn’t hear—or didn’t want to. The car sped up and disappeared into the darkness within seconds, as if it had never been there at all.



The gate swung shut.

I turned back—and saw someone rushing out of the alley I’d just come from. I knew it had to be the man with the knife.

I didn’t hesitate.

I bolted down the nearest side street and threw myself behind the first trash bin I could find.



My whole body trembled. My teeth were chattering. Panic had completely taken hold of my mind. Then, on the ground right next to my foot, something glinted in the dim light.



A knife.

A large kitchen knife.

How the hell did that get here? flashed through my mind. Someone must’ve dropped it.

At least now I finally had something to defend myself with.

  


I sat there for minutes behind the dumpster.

But no one came. No knife-wielding maniac. No one at all.

The silence of the city pressed down on me. The nerves, the hopelessness—it was tearing me apart. I couldn’t sit there in the filth any longer. My pant legs were soaked through, and I was gripping the knife so tightly I thought the handle might snap.

I crawled out from behind the dumpster and carefully stepped back into the street.

My feet ached, but I couldn’t let the exhaustion take over.



The street was just as empty as before. No sign of the man with the knife.

But someone was there—standing in front of the Airbnb building, fiddling with the intercom.



I moved closer, cautiously. The man wore a gray shirt; his long hair was greasy and clung to his head.

  


“Shut up, Hank!” he yelled into the intercom. “We don’t have much time, so just shut up and listen!”

  


I froze. That voice… it was familiar. Too familiar.

  


“That doesn’t matter right now!” the man snapped into the device. “Just don’t let anyone in!”

  


“Who are you?” I asked, holding the knife out in front of me. “And why do you sound like me?”

  


The man ended the call, then spun around in one quick motion, and pointed a knife right back at me.

That’s when I saw it clearly.

He was me.

Except this version of me looked like he hadn’t slept, eaten, or even showered in weeks.

  


“Get the hell out of here, man!” he shouted. “This isn’t the way! This isn’t how you fix it!”

  


I just stared at him. My head was spinning; none of this made sense.

  


“Oh, God…” he muttered, lowering his knife. “You’re new.”

  


“New? What are you talking about? Why do we look the same?”

  


“I don’t know everything,” he said, his voice strained, almost frantic. “But there are two things you need to remember. First—if you see the one covered in cuts, don’t go near him. If you see him… run. Second—if you want to get out of here, you’ll have to do something.

I don’t know what yet. Not exactly. But there’s a way.”

  


“What the hell are you talking about?” I asked. “Get out of where? Who’s the one with the cuts?”

  


“Shut up and listen,” he growled. “Do you remember when you came here? Or how?”

  


His words hit me like a hammer.



I tried to remember. But nothing came. I didn’t know when I’d arrived. Or whether I’d driven or flown.

I couldn’t even remember if there’d been a conference at all.

The harder I tried to recall, the more my thoughts began to unravel.



How did I even get here?

As most of us would see it - Any discount is good discount, especially since you can double dip into it using credit card rewards.

Now here’s where the shady-ness comes in - my mom bought coffee using subscribe and save for 350 Rs since it had a 5% discount. Well and good. But when I went and looked at the standing instruction, it was set for **5000 Rs**. Wtf!!???

When it was time for the next installment, amazon raised the price by 50 rs. This happened only for my mom’s account. When I checked my account, the price was still 350 rs.

That’s some shady stuff they’re doing right there. 

How can you save yourself from these dark patterns?

Whenever you start a subscription, you create something called a “standing instruction” or “mandate”. Your bank will send you a link regarding it that redirects you to a website called “SIHub” or standing instructions hub.

Go to the website, sign up, and update the mandate that is set up there. If the thing you are subscribing to is worth 350 rs, then update the mandate to something like 360 rs to adjust for minor price fluctuations.

If you use lots of subscriptions, like ott, amazon, etc, you will save yourself from any nasty price hikes and shady practices that these companies use.",11,1760104232.0,Frugal_Ind,1,1.0,False

So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1o31ajg,https://i.redd.it/el1scdn8gauf1.jpeg,Modest Collection,"Tender Amber: 9.5/10. I have a love-hate relationship with this fragrance. I love it because it is so damn good, and I hate it because it just does not last. I often find myself overspraying (10-12, sometimes 15+), but not to much avail, as it still won’t last over 4-5 hours. It is a clone of Erba Pura but has an edge to it that just makes it smell better, which I am unable to express in words (erba pura however still trumps it as it is beast mode with insane projection). I will probably always own this beauty just to sniff the elixir that it contains, but if you want it for any other purpose than yourself and hope to be noticed, stay clear.

Afnan Rare Reef: 9.5/10. Have fallen in love with a perfume this much only after Tender Amber but this one is lasts 8-10h. So fresh and luxurious at an affordable price. Reminds me of the best beach vacation of my life!

Hawas Ice: 9/10. Beautiful minty and sweet bubblegum start, settling into ambroxan and musk. Just enough masculinity to be versatile, and not cloyingly sweet- rather just an interesting layer . I prefer it over the OG Hawas, as it is more masculine and less sweet, making it a long lasting freshie (4+ hours of projection upon maceration). Perfect dumb reach.

Lattafa honor & glory: 9/10. Nice sweet creme brulee & floral sandalwood with masculine notes (vetiver, moss, cashmere). Insane performance & projection even without maceration. Beastmode after maceration. Wonderful 🤩

Dylan Blue: 8.5/10. Aquatic-Earthy- Ambroxan. Another inoffensive dumb reach, best suiting the office in my opinion. Reminds me of a mature man with a purpose, but can be pulled off by smart teenagers as well. Nice aquatic blue start, but turns into just strong ambroxan soon, to my nose. However, it earns compliments so there’s that. It will never be a mind blower but is that reliable grandparent in your fragrance lineup. Very masculine 👍🏾 

French Avenue Vulcan Fue (God of Fire): 8.5/10. Mango drink over actual mango. Middle notes like Rare reef/Pacific Chill 😍. Dries down into tolerable and masculine fruity oud/musk. Very complex in a good way, great performance, with 3 hours+ of projection after maceration. 👍🏾 

Lattafa najdia intense (JPG Le beau PG): 8.33/10. Nice fresh balanced minty pineapple and coconut, versatile. Well caught JPG vibe. Longer lasting khadlaj island, musky drydown quite decent. 👍🏾 

Khadlaj Island: 8/10 First impressions- Man I love this fragrance, more for the versatility. I am obsessed with the coconut note. The floral, fruity and minor spicy notes complement the sweet coconut perfectly. Smells like a Pina colada at the start. It is a fragrance not bound by age group, fashion, or setting, and reminds me most of a tropical vacation spot by the beach, with a beer in my hand. My only gripe is, it barely lasts on my skin and does not project at all. However, i just got it so i will give it time to macerate before writing that feature off as well. 

Khamrah Qahwa: 8/10. Improvement on khamrah DNA with strong masculine coffee note addition. Nuclear projection & performance, but still not really my cup of (coffee).

Blue by Ahmed (Bleu de Chanel): 7/10. Not bad after maceration. Minty, Aquatic, peppery shower gel. However, not unique or much character. Musky, Arabic base notes.

Khadlaj Karus Blu spice (LV Imagination): 6.5/10. Soapy citrus burst & fruity opening. Basic overpowering linear citrus, with slight herbal tea (lemongrass) dry down. Low performance (before maceration). Wearable but not exciting. Room freshner/Detergent vibes 👎 

Kayaan classic (Dior homme intense): 6.5/10 Iris & lavender, old man vibes. Vanilla, Sandalwood, Patchouli dry down better. Makes me think of Chuck Mcgill. Not my type.

Lattafa Maahir Legacy (PDM Sedley): 5/10. Smells like a dried raincoat, earthy but fresh & aquatic. Might be Wearable but I dialike it. Performance mid even after maceration.

1o31a0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/cologne/comments/1o31a0m/erfahrungsbericht_impact_coffee_speed_dating/,Erfahrungsbericht: Impact Coffee Speed Dating,"Ich (m34) wurde (vom Impact Coffee) zu meinem ersten Speed Dating eingeladen und wollte hier mal meine Erfahrungen niederschreiben, ähnlich derer[ der Single Dating Nacht im Kölner Zoo](https://www.reddit.com/r/cologne/comments/1mfgjxf/wie_war_eure_erfahrung_auf_der_gestrigen/).



Zunächst kann ich positiv vermerken: Es kamen Gespräche mit wesentlich mehr Gespräche mit Frauen als im Zoo zustande! Aber der Reihe nach, zunächst einmal der...



# Idee



Wer weiß was Speeddating ist: Nächster Absatz. Wer Speeddating gar nicht kennt: Die Grundidee ist folgende: X Männer und Frauen treffen sich auf einem Speeddating Event. Ziel ist es, sich mit möglichst vielen Personen des anderen Geschlechts zu unterhalten. Dazu sitzen Frauen und Männer sich jeweils 1:1 gegenüber und haben einige (meist 5-10) Minuten Zeit mit dem jeweiligen Partner auf der anderen Seite des Tisches zu reden. Nach Ablauf der Zeit bewertet man (meist geheim), ob man die Person, die einem gegenüber sitzt, wiedersehen möchte und geht zur nächsten Person. Wenn beide Personen sich wiedersehen möchten, werden die Kontaktdaten (meist über einen Veranstalter) ausgetauscht und ein reguläres Dating kann beginnen.

  


# Ablauf



Das Speed Dating findet monatlichen jeden ersten (hetero) und letzten (lesbisch) Dienstag im Monat statt - letzteres war früher einmal queer Dating, nachdem es aber überlicherweise ohnehin fast nur Frauen als Teilnehmerinnen gab beschloss man sich, den Namen passender zu gestalten. Im Preis (\~23€) enthalten ist ein Cocktail (oder wahlweise Alkoholfreies Getränk)



Zwischen 19 und 19:30 ist Einlass (inklusive einer Schlange für die freien Cocktails). Man erhält einen kleinen Aufkleber mit dem Namen und kann bereits miteinander reden, wobei man hier schnell merkt: Mit dem gleichen Geschlecht zu reden ist für die meisten die kleinere Überwindung. Trotzdem haben sich hier bereits einige nette Gespräche ergeben.



Um 19:30 gibt es eine kurze, gut gelaunte Ansage, die den Ablauf erklärt: Es gibt eine Unterteilung in 2 Gruppen - 25-30 und 30-35 Jahre. Die Altersgruppen sind, wie auf der Website des Anbieters angegeben, nicht bindend. Gegen Ende habe ich einen Blick auf die Liste einer... \[Speed-Date-Partnerin?\] werfen dürfen, auf der das Alter der Männer, mit denen Sie bisher geredet hat, niedergeschrieben wurde - 29-40 Jahre. Leicht außerhalb der Alters""grenzen"", aber (aus meiner Sicht) nicht dramatisch. 



*Amüsanter Gedanke: Menschen, die jüngere Partner suchen und sich daher in der jüngeren Gruppe einschreiben, könnten Menschen die ältere Partner suchen und sich daher in der älteren Gruppe einschreiben ""verpassen"". Doch auch dafür gibt es eine Lösung, die offene Runde, in der sich nach dem Speed Dating die beiden Gruppen vermischen.*



Die Altersgruppen werden in 2 Räume aufgeteilt, Frauen auf den “inneren” Stühlen und Männer auf den Äußeren. Daraufhin kann man sich mit dem Gegenüber \~5 Minuten lang unterhalten, bis das Impact Team ansagt, dass es jetzt Zeit ist, die Speed Dating-Partner zu wechseln. Dann gehen die Frauen im Uhrzeigersinn weiter. Über eine App (später mehr) kann man dann bestimmen, ob man freundschaftlichen, Dating oder gar keinen Kontakt zu der Person halten möchte.



Das Ganze geht ungefähr 1,5-2 Stunden, woraufhin gegen 21:30 die offene Runde für freie Unterhaltung folgt, bei der sich die Altersgruppen mischen und man so auch Personen aus der anderen Gruppe kennenlernen kann - alternativ kann man sich mit einer Person mit der man sich gut verstanden hat in den ruhigeren hinteren Bereich zurückziehen.



*So zumindest der Plan, der heute von einem (sehr lieben und ruhigen) Hund gestört wurde, der nicht dauernd den Platz wechseln sollte. Deshalb wurde nach der ersten Runde etwas Chaos gestiftet, indem die innen-außen-Sitzverteilung und ""wer läuft"" getauscht wurde. Das Hauptproblem waren hier das mindestens eine Person nicht verstand was “gegen den Uhrzeigersinn” bedeutet - die Unordnung wurde jedoch relativ schnell (nach 2 Runden) und kompetent durch einen Mitarbeiter des Impact Teams korrigiert.* 



*Persönliche Anmerkung: Durch diese Korrektur kam es für mich zu einem weiteren Gespräch mit einer Frau, bei dem wir uns überraschenderweise wesentlich besser verstanden als beim ersten - ob daraus eine Freundschaft wird kann ich zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt noch nicht sagen denn das wird erst im Nachgang durch die App (siehe unten) gelöst.*



Ab hier werde ich detaillierter auf die einzelnen Punkte eingehen:



# 1) Speed-Dating



Was gibt es zum Speed Dating zu sagen? Man kommt auf jeden Fall ins Gespräch mit dem anderen Geschlecht, weil man zu diesem quasi gezwungen wird - was gerade für die schüchternen Menschen, die sonst niemanden ansprechen würden, ein absoluter Vorteil ist.



In der 30-35 Gruppe gab es 12 Frauen & Männer (sehr ausgeglichen, trotz aktueller Grippewelle), also 12 mehrminütige Gespräche. Von einigen Leuten habe ich gehört ""man will ja nicht 12 mal über das gleiche reden"", und auch meine 12 Gespräche haben sich teils leicht, teils stark voneinander unterschieden - vom klassischen ""Hobbies""? ""Job?"" zu ""Willst du eine Giraffe oder eine Nacktschnecke als Haustier?"". Häufig hatte ich jedoch das Gefühl, dass entweder nur ich oder nur meine Partnerin geredet haben, und die Zeit bereits vorbei war, bevor man richtig ins Gespräch kam - aber das liegt wohl in der Sache des Speeddatings. Letztendlich ist es ein kurzes ""Sind wir einander auf Anhieb sympathisch?""



Zusätzlich gab es pro Platz 3 kleine Karten mit Icebreaker Fragen, wenn einem partout nichts fürs Gespräch einfällt. Ich habe von diesen 3 mal Gebrauch gemacht (mehr aus Kuriosität als aus Notwendigkeit) - und die Fragen unterscheiden sich wirklich sehr voneinander. Während meine Karte ""Was sind deine Ziele?"" lautete, las die meiner Partnerin ""Was ist dein Lieblings-Kartoffelgericht?"". Ich als ""laufende Person"" fand immer andere Karten und Fragen vor, die Karten der ""sitzende Person"" bleiben immer gleich - mir drängt sich der Gedanke auf, dass ein Austausch der Karten (z.B. jede Laufende Person nimmt eine der 3 Karten mit) die Variation für die sitzende Person erhöhen könnten - vermutlich denke ich aber viel zu kompliziert und die Karten werden nur in den seltensten Fällen genutzt, weshalb eine Rotation wahrscheinlich mehr Probleme verursacht als zu lösen. Mehr als 3 Karten pro Platz würden es vermutlich auch tun.



# 2) Lautstärke



Es gab ein großes Manko, das von mehreren Frauen angesprochen wurde, und auch mir ein großer Dorn im ~~Auge~~ Ohr war: Die Lautstärke. 24 Leute die sich in einem Raum unterhalten ist verdammt laut, zuhören ist anstrengend, ich musste mehrmals um Wiederholung des Gesprochenen bitten und am Ende tat mir mein Hals weh. Aufgrund des Aufbaus des Cafés ist hier auch nicht viel zu machen. Ich weiß nicht ob Filz-Lärmschutzwände zwischen den Plätzen eine Wirkung hätten, aber gerade wenn links und rechts von einem laut-redende Menschen sitzen wird die Unterhaltung schnell zur Herausforderung. 



Ein anderer Teilnehmer merkte an, dass die Musik auch nicht geholfen hätte. Ich könnte schwören, dass die Musik während des Speed Datings aus war, oder zumindest so leise, dass sie von der Kakophonie sich-unterhaltender Singles übertönt wurde und nicht zu hören war.



Mein persönlicher Wunsch wäre es, die beiden Altersgruppen auf 2 Abende aufzuteilen und die Teilnehmerzahl auf 24 pro Altersgruppe zu limitieren, sodass jeweils das gesamte Café genutzt werden könnte - aber ob das dann noch wirtschaftlich für das Impact ist, kann ich nicht beurteilen.



Zuletzt gingen auch Mitarbeitende des Impacts beim Speed Dating herum, sodass man Getränke bestellen konnte, ohne die wertvolle, knappe Gesprächszeit zu verlieren.



# 3) Die offene Runde am Ende



Nach dem Dating vermischen sich die 2 Gruppen wie oben angegeben. Und während sich hier einige Paare intensiv unterhalten haben, merkt man auch hier schnell - die offene Unterhaltung samt Ansprechen ist für viele nichts. Hier bildeten sich wieder Grüppchen, gern auch zwischen gleichgeschlechtlichen Menschen - was in sich nichts schlimmes ist, aber dem Dating auch nicht zuträglich. Generell ist mein Eindruck: Gut, dass es die offene Runde gibt, für einige ist es sicherlich genau das richtige - aber man sollte sich auch nicht schlecht fühlen, wenn man sich in dieser nicht wohl fühlt und nach ein paar Minuten den Heimweg antritt.



# 4) Die Teilnehmenden



In einem veganen Café mit diversen (auch queeren) Dating Veranstaltungen in Köln habe ich ehrlich gesagt eine ""ausgefallenere"" Sorte Mensch erwartet - Punk/Metal/Alternativ. Zumindest am heutigen Abend war das nicht der Fall - abgesehen von einem Mann mit Lidschatten (falls du das lesen solltest - sieht gut aus!) waren alle Leute sehr, mangels eines besseren Wortes (und absolut nicht wertend gemeint) ""normal"", soweit man das in 5 Minuten Gespräch und vom Kleidungsstil herausfinden konnte). Die Männer waren (lt. einer Gesprächspartnerin) fast alle Fachinformatiker, die Frauen viel in sozialen Berufen aller Art vertreten - wobei der Beruf jetzt auch nicht bei jedem Gespräch das Thema war. Die meisten Frauen waren (laut eigener Aussage) das erste Mal auf einem Speed Dating Event, eine Teilnehmerin war aber auch ""Speed Dating Veteranin"". Ob das jetzt pro (man findet schnell einen Partner) oder contra (man will es kein zweites Mal machen) Speeddating spricht, lasse ich jede/n für sich entscheiden.



# 5) Die App



Im Allgemeinen bin ich sehr angetan von der App. Denkbar simpel: Ein QR Code verweist auf ein Google Forms (und wenn jetzt hier jemand ""Oh nein - Datenschutz Google"" sagt - dazu unten mehr), hier gibt es 2 Drop Down Menüs (Dein Name - Name deines Partners) sowie einen Radio Button (Date - Freundschaft - Nein). 

* Kreuzt eine Person “Nein” an kommt es zu keinem Kontaktaustausch
* Kreuzt eine Person “Freundschaft” an und die andere “Date” oder “Freundschaft” kommt es zu einem Kontaktaustausch für Freundschaft
* Kreuzen beide Personen “Date” an kommt es zu einem Kontaktaustausch zum Daten

Die Kontakte werden hierbei vom Impact Team per Mail verschickt.



Kritik an der App: Ich kann mir vorstellen, dass es hier zu Manipulationsversuchen kommen kann - speziell, da es mir fast versehentlich passiert wäre. Das ""Mein Name"" und ""Partner Name"" Feld sind nämlich beide mit allen Personen aus dem Cafe befüllt - und ich habe versehentlich den Namen einer Partnerin ins ""Mein Name"" Feld eingetragen. So könnte ich für andere Personen ein Date vereinbaren, oder, sollte eine bestimmte Person es mir besonders angetan haben, einfach ein ""Nein"" ihren Namen für alle anderen potentiellen Partner versenden. Die Daten werden von Google Forms in einem Google Sheet (Quasi Excel) abgelegt - das vom Personal auseinander klüngeln zu lassen dürfte zumindest nervig werden. Wenn ich mich nicht irre, dürften die eingegeben Daten nur aus einem Timestamp, 2 Namen, und ""Nein / Freundschaft / Date"" bestehen, also nichts, was den Nutzer authentifizieren könnte.



Mein Vorschlag: 2 Forms, eins für Frauen eins für Männer. QR Codes am Eingang. So ist einerseits die Liste zur Namenswahl kürzer und während man beim eigenen Geschlecht noch für andere Personen Antworten abgeben kann, nimmt man die Option zumindest für das andere. Noch besser ginge es eventuell wenn man den eigenen Namen durch ""E-Mail Adresse erfassen"" ersetzt, was Menschen mit Google Accounts (also quasi jedem) die Auswahl des eigenen Namens erspart - aber auch im Hintergrund zu Zuordnungsproblemen führen kann, wenn man nicht die korrekte E-Mail Adresse jedes Teilnehmenden erfragt.



Möglicherweise ist das aber auch nicht nötig, vermutlich gucken sich die wenigsten Menschen eine App an und denken zuerst ""wie kann ich die angedachte Funktion dieser App umgehen?"". Wie oft das vorkommt weiß letztendlich nur das Impact Team



# 6) Datenschutz & Google



Bei einigen gingen beim Wort ""Google"" sicherlich die Alarmglocken los - dazu möchte ich sagen: Es gibt quasi keine Cloud (und erst recht keine lokal gemanagte Lösung), die in Punkto Sicherheit an die Google Cloud herankommt. Was die Datenverarbeitung angeht: ich habe keine klare Antwort darauf bekommen, ob Impact einen bezahlten Account oder die Free Version nutzt - in der Free Version kann die Verarbeitung der Daten auf amerikanischen Servern erfolgen - ganz unkorrekt würde ich aber behaupten, dass die meisten von uns mit ihren persönlichen Daten (gerade den erhobenen) weeeeeit unsicherere Dinge tun und hier von einem Café mehr zu erwarten übertrieben wäre - wer aber die eigene E-Mail Adresse nicht auf Amerikanischen Servern sehen möchte… der sollte vermutlich nicht auf Reddit sein.



Ein Punkt ist mir jedoch aufgefallen: Die Google Sheets mit den Teilnehmerlisten werden am Eingang auf 2 Laptops angezeigt - hier wäre es theoretisch für andere Speed-Dating Teilnehmer möglich, ein schnelles Foto mit dem Handy zu schießen um so Nachname / Vorname / E-Mail Adresse zu erhalten. Macht das Sinn? Vermutlich nicht. Schön wäre trotzdem, wenn in zwei Laptop-Blickschutzfolien investiert würde, um die E-Mail Adressen und Nachnamen der Teilnehmenden vor so etwas zu schützen.



# Fazit

Ich bin in diesen 2 Stunden mit 12 Frauen ins Gespräch gekommen, habe alle ein bisschen kennengelernt und hatte Spaß. Auch wenn in diesen 2 Stunden kein Funke übergesprungen ist, kann ich mir vorstellen, dass das passieren kann, wenn es richtig gut passt. Das Team wirkt kompetent und bemüht, der einzige Wermutstropfen ist die Lautstärke, die die Unterhaltungen teilweise sehr schwer gestaltet hat. Die Atmosphäre in dem Café ist gut, und wenn sich aus dem Abend eine weitere Freundschaft ergibt war das gut investierte Zeit.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

1o315ln,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthMomentum/comments/1o315ln/why_choose_winoo_design_car_tissue_refills_300/,Why Choose Winoo Design Car Tissue Refills 300 Sheets Review for Your Vehicle?,"The Winoo Design CTT6R Car Tissue Refills caught my attention for its practicality and versatility. Diving into this product, I tested it extensively in my personal car, at home, and even in my office. Its claim to be a perfect companion for on-the-go tissue needs intrigued me, especially as someone who values convenience and cleanliness during commutes.

**Compact Design and Usability**  
The compact design of this product fitted seamlessly into my car’s visor tissue holder. As a person who often finds regular-sized tissue packs too bulky for car use, this refill pack genuinely surprised me with its convenience. The dimensions, measuring 7.6 x 6.22 x 3.66 inches, are ideal for compact spaces yet sufficient to hold 300 sheets. Each tissue measures 7.1” x 7.1”, which I initially thought might be small, but it turned out to be a size that catered perfectly for my face and hands. It’s an upgrade from the standard travel tissues, which often leave me frustrated due to their size.

**Durability and Performance**  
Testing the quality of each sheet became an exciting part of my routine. The tissues are unscented, which is great because I personally dislike heavily perfumed facial tissues. They felt soft on my skin, even for wiping my face, and were highly absorbent. Whether I spilled my coffee during a bumpy car ride or needed something to clean my hands quickly during outdoor munching, these performed exceptionally well. Unlike some tissues that quickly disintegrate, these stayed intact even with light scrubbing. If I had to nitpick, I did notice they’re not as ultra-durable as specialty wipes, but given their purpose, they certainly do the job well.

**Highlights**  
- Each pack contains 50 tissues, with six packs included, totaling 300 sheets.  
- Specifically designed to fit car sun visors, tissue tubes, or standard boxes in home and office settings.  
- Soft, unscented sheets that feel light yet absorbent—easy on the skin.  
- Excellent for personal use, parties, or stocking up for emergencies.

**Practicality for Different Environments**  
This product is not limited to just cars. One of my friends borrowed a pack for her office desk, and I even slipped one into my travel bag. She swore it was an excellent fit for her crowded workspace. The refill packs are incredibly versatile; they work equally well in a car tissue cylinder or a simple tabletop dispenser. At home, I used it during dinner when things got messy—another situation where regular-sized tissues often fail because they either rip or aren’t absorbent enough. The ease of stocking up for various scenarios is a huge win for busybodies like myself.

**Good Aspects**  
- Compact and travel-friendly.  
- Non-perfumed and gentle on the skin.  
- Versatile for multiple settings: car, office, or home.  

**Negatives to Consider**  
On the flip side, I did notice a few areas where this product could improve.  
- The quantity per pack, while detailed, might not meet the needs of larger families or workplaces with constant tissue use.  
- Refilling some car tissue holders required careful maneuvering, as the packaging sometimes snagged during the refill process.  
- It might not appeal to individuals who prefer ultra-luxury tissues with premium softness.  

**Competing Products**  
In comparison to other car tissue refills on the market, this one stands out for its simple and practical approach. For instance, some other brands offer tissues in aesthetically pleasing packages, but I’ve observed that quality often takes a backseat. A competitor product I tried was softer but tore easily under pressure. Another brand touted eco-friendliness with recycled paper but tagged on a hefty price. The Winoo Design product isn’t here to woo with flashy packaging or over-the-top luxurious features. Instead, its reliability as an everyday essential for cars and other tight spaces gives it a considerable edge.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Price-wise, I’d say this product is a balanced blend of affordability and functionality. It’s not the cheapest option out there, but based on cost-per-unit, it delivers more value compared to some pricier alternatives. For someone looking to stock up and avoid frequent purchases, it’s a wallet-friendly choice without compromising on usability or quality. I usually get picky about such things, especially if I feel like I’m overpaying for convenience. However, this product positions itself smartly as affordable quality, and honestly, that’s all anyone truly needs for car refills.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

Ryan Aglecard figures he’s no one special. He’s just studying business, hanging out with his friends, and working at his uncle’s coffee shop in a multispecies metropolis that never sleeps. But his normal life is overturned when a strange ruby found amid his father’s old things ignites his abilities as a Spirit Keeper.

With the surprise discovery that he’s one of the Awakened—a select few capable of wielding legendary magic—Ryan will have to work with his Knight Spirit, Maximus, to master a killer learning curve. He’s leveling up at incredible speeds and gaining extraordinary rewards, but the dangers around him are multiplying every second.

When corruption infiltrates their world, Ryan and Maximus embark on a quest to unite three pieces of the Garden Golem Spirit Gaia, a long-lost protective entity.

As the line between friends and foes begins to blur, Ryan and Maximus must confront a force devastating the city—and an even more insidious enemy starts to gather its strength . . .

- We have a dog and like to be outside but don’t hike very often so prefer proximity to local parks/walking trails rather than strenuous hikes
- We don’t go out at night very much so proximity to downtown is not a priority. We love neighborhoods that have their own “strip” or mini-downtown with some nice shops or restaurants

So my grandpa left me his ‘92 Camry – beige, obviously, with those classic blue velour seats and a single, stubborn crack across the entire dashboard. The kind of car you’d describe as “transportation appliance.” I almost sold it. I mean, come on, it’s not a Supra. But honestly? Driving that thing… it did something to me.

It wasn’t about power or looks. It was the smell of the 90s-era upholstery, a mix of old coffee and newspapers. The way the AM radio only picked up classic rock stations, like it was refusing to acknowledge this century. Every squeak from the rear suspension felt like the car was telling me stories my grandpa never did.

I started falling down this rabbit hole of why we’re all so emotionally attached to old cars, even the boring ones. Seriously, why does a slow, beige sedan from three decades ago hit different than my modern crossover with its soul-less touchscreen?

I found this wild article that put everything I was feeling into words – [see here](https://classiccarservice.net/the-cultural-revival-of-vintage-cars-in-modern-society/). It talks about how vintage cars are having this cultural moment right now, and it’s not just about collector Ferraris. It’s about regular cars becoming time capsules. Driving my grandpa’s Camry now feels like I’m preserving a slice of regular history, and honestly? That hits harder than any 0-60 time ever could.

So I have to ask you all: What's your ""regular"" beige Camry? What's that one unremarkable car that, for some weird reason, you have a deep, irrational connection to?

Chad Perreault – the owner of the popular Heart n Seoul Korean food truck at Earthen Ales – is preparing to launch a new brick-and-mortar Korean BBQ restaurant in downtown Traverse City, complete with karaoke rooms and a Korean-style photo booth. *The Ticker* has the details on the new business – called The Three Pigs – plus other restaurant and retail updates from across the region.

**The Three Pigs**  
Chad Perreault received city commission approval this week for a redevelopment liquor license application for his new restaurant **The Three Pigs**, planned for the soon-to-be-former Mammoth Distilling space next to The Workshop Brewing Company in the Warehouse District (pictured). Perreault will take over the space in November to begin renovations ahead of a targeted February soft opening.

Perreault – who spent years in Korea attending university, teaching, and cooking – aims to build on the success of his Heart n Seoul food truck with the new restaurant. “It’s always been the plan to get into a brick-and-mortar,” he says. “The food truck was the starting point, because it was cost-effective and helped me figure out working with people and suppliers. It was a great starting point.”

The Three Pigs – a nod to Perreault’s three brothers as well as samgyeopsal, the Korean word for pork belly that translates to ""three-layered meat” – will bring the chef’s favorite communal dining tradition to Traverse City. “I’ve been to more than 40 countries and have experienced Korean BBQ in every one,” he says. “It’s really what I love to do, and I want to share that experience with as many people as I can.”

While traditional Korean BBQ typically sees customers grill marinated meats at their own tables – accompanied by a range of sauces, garnishes, vegetables, and sides – Perreault says restaurant staff will grill the meat in the back of the house and then bring the grill arrangement out to customers. That’s to help acclimate diners to the tradition, he says, with the goal of eventually transitioning to customers cooking the meat themselves. Trios of sauces, sides, and soups – including kimchi, soybean, and fluffy egg soups – will round out the menu, along with Korean beers and spirits like soju.

The Three Pigs will feature karaoke rooms in the back – previously a private event space – and a photo booth in the entrance, both staples of Korean culture. The Heart n Seoul truck will wrap up its final season at Earthen Ales October 14. Perreault says he’s in talks to have Earthen Ales take over the truck as an incubator kitchen for future chefs; barring that, he’ll hold on to the truck for catering. Meanwhile, **Mammoth Distilling** is hosting its last few weeks of business in the Warehouse District – the company promises a “big, final blowout” to wrap up – before opening in a [relocated tasting room at 332 East Front Street next to Nolan’s](https://www.traverseticker.com/news/mammoth-distilling-moving-to-front-street/). “Best guess is the last weekend of October,” says founder Chad Munger of the launch date. “That is of course contingent on licensing, but I’m hopeful!”

**Other restaurant and retail news…**  
In addition to Perreault’s license, city commissioners Monday approved a banquet facility liquor license Monday for **NanBop Farm** – a biodiverse farm in Cadillac that hosts community programming and events – to operate in Traverse City. NanBop Farm is a related entity to 910 Media Group/Heritage Broadcasting, which owns property at 415 Cass Street. The license will allow NanBop to host private events on the deck of the Cass Street building, though the application notes that “the deck will not be generally open to the public.”

Several closures are underway in downtown Traverse City. Retail store **FatFace** has closed its doors at 204 East Front Street, while **Brilliant Books** is [preparing to wind down its brick-and-mortar operations](https://www.traverseticker.com/news/brilliant-books-set-to-close-retail-store/) at 118 East Front Street. Staff said the goal is to remain open through the end of October. In a letter to customers, Brilliant Books said “our devotion to doing things the very best way outpaced the revenues that were needed to sustain that. It is a bittersweet truth: the very qualities that made this place remarkable also made it hard to keep alive.” The company plans to keep its online store and subscription service going, however, and said Brilliant Books will appear at occasional pop-up events.

**Pangea’s Pizza** has temporarily closed at 135 East Front Street for renovations. Work will include a new basement floor and drains to support a new prep area, remodeled bathrooms, improved bar/host/expo areas, an upgraded kitchen line and seating, and a remodeled rooftop. Owner Chris Mohrhardt says Pangea’s will likely reopen in March or April and notes sister locations Incredible Mo’s and Loco Boys Brewing Company remain open during the reconstruction.

**Elysian Lash Company** has opened its doors at 525 South Union Street Suite E. Licensed esthetician Ellen Phillips runs the studio, which specializes in customized lash artistry and beauty care including lash extensions, fills, lifts, and brow services. On the other side of downtown, **Traverse Bay Café** is under new ownership at 810 East Front Street. New owner Ashley Flowers says that while the Cuban-style eatery is closed now for improvements and restructuring, she plans to share more details publicly soon on an upcoming reopening.

Further down East Front, ice cream stand **Super Cone** has closed for the season at The Coin Slot, while Mexican food truck **Sabores Y Colores** is now operating in the arcade parking lot. The truck will be open through October and possibly longer, weather permitting. **The Coin Slot** owner Scott Pierson also plans to begin renovations on the inside restaurant space – currently home to Two Sons Pizza, [which is departing at the end of the year](https://www.traverseticker.com/news/restaurant-and-retail-news-js-hamburg-kingsley-hammered-heifer-franks-231-umai-eats-and-more/) – starting January 1 for a to-be-announced project that will be operated by The Coin Slot. Down the block, **The Little Fleet** announced this will be the final weekend for food trucks operating outside for the year.

The **Foundry Craft Grillery** has closed its doors on River Street in Elk Rapids. “We are incredibly grateful to the community, our staff, and our guests for their support and loyalty since our three-year time in Elk Rapids,” co-owner Andre Bushell said in a statement to *The Ticker.* “This was a difficult decision, but one made with careful consideration. We look forward to focusing our energy on continuing to serve northern Michigan through our other restaurant concepts. We ask for privacy and respect for our team during this transition, and we sincerely thank everyone who has been part of the Foundry family.” The East Jordan Foundry location remains open.

**Mission Proper** has announced that its last day of operations at Seven Hills on Old Mission Peninsula will be October 26. Coffee shop owner Jennifer Kuhar posted that “there is exciting energy behind the scenes with a potential new candidate interested in carrying the torch forward under a refreshed vision. Knowing that this space may continue as a third place for our community makes my heart full.” Two other local businesses are exiting the scene: **GameStop** has closed its doors in the Grand Traverse Mall, while dog grooming shop **Petit Pooch Salon** announced it will close mid-April when its lease expires on Hastings Street.

Finally, a new hobby and collectibles shop is coming to Traverse City. **Treysian’s Treasures** is planning a soft opening November 10 on Garfield Avenue next to Sherwin-Williams. The shop will specialize in Pokémon cards and other trading cards games, plus support board games and tabletop role-playing games.",6,1760103206.0,traversecity,0,1.0,False

No mention of the cats and how they make her happy or what she does to keep them healthy (vet visits, physical and mental stimulation, etc.)

I see a dog not allowed to run and play, be trained, or go for meaningful walks due to her owner's laziness. 

I see a woman rapidly aging by decades and gaining weight who won't admit it.  Her marriage is a sham and her legacy will be what?  How to waste time and money?  How to cheat, lie, and grift? 

If her life is the definition of JOY, I'll pass. 🤣

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

Buckeye fan living here in Champaign for 30+ years so just wanted to send some tips and things to do to those of you traveling here for the game. Also if you have questions please feel free to ask and I'll try my best to help!


Parking:

Unfortunately there is absolutely no free parking on U of I campus, like anywhere. There will be metered spots but they are pricey. I recommend just spending the $15-$20 on a lot on campus. Lot E-14 is caddycorner (Southwest) from the stadium and probably the most convenient, I want to say that lot costs $20. There is parking off campus near Hessel park about a mile or so west of the stadium but that does fill up quickly. If you park on the street on campus and have to do a meter, download the Mobile Meter App as that is what all of the meters have switched to.

Restaurants:

Campus has a good amount of restaurants but the vast majority of them are international restaurants as we have a very large international student population. Take a stroll over to Green street as that is where most of the restaurants are. It is maybe a half mile north of the stadium.

Off campus there are quite a few more options that are reasonable close if you plan on staying after the game:

BREAKFAST:

-Maple and Yolk

-Original Pancake House

-Merry Anne's Diner (a classic spot just off campus)

-Le Peep

-Sam's Cafe

LUNCH/DINNER

-The Ribeye: nicer steakhouse with a salad bar

-Baxters: another nicer restaurant with steaks and American entrees 

-Dave's Hot Chicken: typical fast food chain with Nashville hot chicken 

-The Yard on Broadway: one of my favorite spots! Has 4 different restaurants inside along with a bar and a coffee shop

-Smith Burger: a staple of Champaign and some of the best burgers you'll have! There are multiple locations including one in The Yard on Broadway posted above 

-Black Dog Smoke and Ale: Champaigns most popular BBQ spot

-Seven Saints: a nicer restaurant located in the heart of downtown 

-There's a ton more in the business area of North Prospect Ave

Other fun things to do:

-Curtis Apple Orchard

-Elevate Trampoline Park (if you bring kiddos)

-Downtown Champaign

-U of I Ice Arena for ice skating (make sure to check hours)

-Busey Woods (fun wooded area for hiking, not huge or challenging)

-Meadowbrook Park

-Explore campus! So many great buildings to see!

B1G Noon Kickoff:

-Located right outside of the stadium in Grange Grove. If you want to participate I suggest getting there before 6:00AM. Last time they were here for the USC game people lined up even earlier than that.

Have fun! O-H!

-----------------------


The BEST -  These are the places that scored perfect 100s.  These places are really doing a good job at keeping their kitchens clean.  The places that score a perfect 100 are really going all out to do things right and they deserve your support.  


-----------------------











Richards Donuts And Pastries, Bend (9/25)

Kendall Toyota Of Bend, Bend (9/25)

Residence Inn - Bend (f), Bend (9/25)

SpringHill Suites by Marriott - Bend, Bend (9/25)

Cuportunity Coffee Kiosk (mob) (e), Redmond (9/24)

Fairfield Inn And Suites (f), Bend (9/22)

Pizza Hut #6008068 (Redmond), Redmond (9/22)

Jamba Juice (Hwy 20), Bend (9/22)





-----------------------


The WORST SCORERS:  Now comes everyone's favorite part of the report - the list of Rotten Restaurants who scored worse than 85.  I don't post any place that scores 85 or above even if they were the worst inspections for a particular week.  85 is a solid B and I don't want to shame them.  


-----------------------







Life & Time: Free Range Fast Food Restaurant (f), Bend Score: 80 (9/23)








-----------------------
 

I'm going to stick these identifiers here so that when you see stuff like (mob) and (wh) you'll have some idea of what they are talking about.  I'm not positive about all of these but they're probably pretty close.  If you see anything I've missed or I guessed wrong please let me know.


bb - bed and breakfast?

e - fee exempt

mob - mobile

wh - warehouse

rp - recreational park

f - fixed position (a normal restaurant)

com - commissary

tf - traveler's accommodation

L - Limited Service

V - vending machines?

It's a very nice community resource.  Kudos to the county for making it this easy to check up on things.

Well this report seems over before we really even began.  The weekend's coming up and it would be a good time to get outdoors and move around.  I'll see you all next week with the latest and hopefully greatest.  Until then enjoy the bonus video:

1o30sz1,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1o30sz1/looking_for_help_picking_a_new_machine/,Looking for Help Picking a New Machine,"Hello! My household is looking into purchasing a super automatic to replace our dying Spinn. We've really appreciated the Spinn for what it is, but the support we've received has been less than stellar and the machine is certainly on its last legs. I've done some research (which led to me to many posts here) and narrowed it down to a couple of options: 


* KitchenAid KF6
* Delonghi Rivelia
* JURA ENA 4


Goals are the following:

* A quick and easy coffee for people would still be using Pods if they were left on their own
* Decent enough espresso
* Ideally a milk frother for cappuccinos and lattes. 
* Easy maintenance. I'm not bothered by doing things on a schedule, we had to do it for the Spinn. I'd rather not have to open the machine up often. 


I would really appreciate this subreddit's thoughts. And of course if there are any other recommendations in roughly that price range (1 - 1.5k) I'd love to hear them. We're also in the US as automod has prompted me to add. ",1,1760102606.0,superautomatic,5,0.67,False
1o30sqj,https://www.reddit.com/r/caucasus/comments/1o30sqj/here_is_the_practical_explanation_about_next_life/,Here is the Practical explanation about next life - by Nigamasya,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

1o30s93,https://i.redd.it/2446yrfjcauf1.png,Who’s tried Promova’s AI Role Play for convo practice?,"Hey teachers!

I recently discovered this AI Role Play feature in the Promova app - it lets you chat with AI that actually listens, responds naturally, and gives tips on pronunciation and fluency.

As a fan of speaking practice, this is awesome when you can’t find busy partners. There are tons of scenarios from “ordering coffee” to “job interview.” You can replay your failed lines without hassle or awkwardness.

Downside: the AI doesn’t always catch context like a human and sometimes replies a bit oddly, but overall, it’s a solid substitute for live practice.

Has anyone else tested it? Any competitors working on the same “real convo” concept? What other features would make spoken practice even more chill?

1o30rzl,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1o30rzl/i_was_in_a_very_tormenting_relationship_and_i/,I was in a very tormenting relationship and I feel really bad the way it made me feel.," i mean he did very bad too me and now seeing the pattern and everything he's put me through he will make me look bad infront of others to make himself look innocent, that's a kind of a guy he is. 

He cheated on me, manipulated me to the point where I was asking for forgiveness just to ask the truth, cheated on me, while he was with me for about 8 months, made a post asking ""where to take her for a 2 year anniversary"" I knew about that girl and ig she also knew about me and she's gonna get married to someone else, they both were doing this while being aware of what they are doing either FWB, i contacted that girl with shaky hands to let her know but she told me we are just friends and please don't contact me after this. 

When i confronted him he didn't said anything, didn't responded, didn't explained himself, that showed how much off a scumbag he is. 

Before all this there were clear signs, he lied to me since the beginning - we started talking online, after talking for a month he asked me to go on a date with him, soon he told me he likes me and sees a potential in this relationship, I too liked him and we started dating but as time passes and I got more curious, the suspicious begans once I asked him to show me around his work place ( told me he's a doc, but he sent me pictures that was downloaded from google and explained what was happening in those pictures as it was clicked during the present time, days later my gut told me to go and search that hospital online I did and the exact same photos were there uploaded 2 or 3 years ago ).

Confronted upon he told me he did it because I was constantly asking and he was busy with the workload, lane excuse so I told him I need time to rethink about this, he said he can show his id proof - showed me one card which didn't indicate that he works where he says he does, later he photoshopped his picture to make it look like he was at hospital, i caught that too. 

He said he's shy and can't ask anyone to click his picture and he wanted one out of his department, i sympathized and decided to give him time to be upon up to me about his work. 

Later i found he's been hiding his instagram stories from me, ik the trust gets shattered from here still my dumb ass decided to go on just because of ""love"". 

When i confronted about that he says maybe a glitch but it wasn't it had already happened quite a few times, he never made me meet his friends, but told me his mum and brother knows about me as he uploaded a photo of us holding hands and within those hours his friends didn't saw it but his family did and he got into trouble so he decided to delete that. 

I was getting very mixed feelings about him and they way he does this things so i texted his brother as he himself said he knows, but he got furious accused me that i ruined the relationship between him and his brother and his brother warmed him to stay out of this ( the conversation I had with him was barely nothing just simply knowing eachother and how we met, he was way too cool about it ) he told me about the relationship getting tarnished bw him and his brother when i stared confronting him about that girl, to make me feel guilty. 

Now the table turned and I was the one who apologised constantly for texting his brother and he was doing his best to make me feel guilty for contacting his brother, he liked seeing me apologizing continuously. 

Now after this he said he is ready to move forward and let this all leave behind, I too was tired and said yeah maybe we can start afresh and told him well what bothers me, he said he will acknowledge, the mistake I made here was that I went to his place after I had texted his brother and he was furious and very angry and i showed up unannounced, he told me to go away while closing the main door of his room for 5 mins and I was still there standing for him to come back so I can apologise, he came back, saw how it's scaring me, i told me him to let me sit and give me water i can't see your anger more than this it's making me scared and it has opened some traumatic events that had happened in my childhood and it was triggering alot, he understood and let me sit at his bed, i asked please hug me i need that rn, my heart is beating loud he did that, and while he was hugging me at the corner of his bed i saw belongings of other women and he told me come I'll drop you home and when I stood up I look at the end of his bed there were 2 full bags of women clothes and on top of that there was a sanitary pad, my heart skipped a bit but I couldn't confront him back then, i couldn't handle another fight  ( i should've leave him after that )

I was still talking to him on text we only met once before this another incident took place, I saw him with another girl at coffee shop when at that day he told me he's out of town, and at the very same day he told me we can start afresh when I come back. 

I asked him what was that? He told me he came back to town with his father and found that girl in the parking so she was just tagging along with him and his father was waiting for him at the next shop so he couldn't came up and say hi. 

Then I was emotionally lost instead of thinking rationally i was easily getting manipulated by him, found alot of things about that girl that she's into ONS, she actually may have live with him ( I feel disgusted with the thought that maybe whenever he comes to pick me up he first might have made sure she wasn't around and hid her stuff ) and to be still with me, he showed me a video claiming that girl has a boyfriend and that video contained that her bf is teaching her how two drive a car and later kissed her on the cheeks, he told me they have been together for years and about to get married so there is nothing to worry about. 

My emotional dependency and attachment towards him grew at a certain level and still decided to be with him, the same he showed me that video he went out with that girl the very same night as she bought a new car, the same very I told him to spend some time with me as I missed him alot and needed some love but he said he has to go to his hometown, again he went out with her and uploaded the pictures she might have clicked off him, when i asked lied to me and said he went out with one of his colleague, later i found the colleague he claims to be with wasn't even his colleague in a first place. 

After this all happened i wasn't thinking straight and kept asking him to tell me truth, he was emotionally abusing me to the point where he put a blame on me that i harrassed him when I told him to kiss me like he used too and put the blame on me for ruining his mental health and his therapist had to increase his medications, this all deeply affected me. 

I was again being sorry for what I hadn't put him through and it was a made up story that he made to look him innocent so I don't bring up that girl ever again, he made me feel guilty, said mean things too me, blamed me for ruining his relationship with his friends and family, the relationship i ruined with his friends was that i told him about that girls ONS and he acted blindsided and doesn't ever support any of this, he told me i barely meet them and now I can't even because of you and i ruined his relationship with his brother because i talked to him. 

Now being with that all he was still gaslighting me and trying to make out his way, i confronted him about everything again he lost his temper at the very same day i found his reddit account where he made a post in the city sub to ask where to bring her to celebrate their 2 year anniversary and called her car as his and there were pretty absurd comments in his previous reddit account before meeting me he had made comments about having sex, having FWB and being cheated on his previous relationship. 

When i asked him about his sexual history he told me he's still a virgin and that FWB comment he made so that it would make him look cool. 

Now on this reddit account he again said the very same thing and admitted having sex at 28 and is active at dating apps. 

I confronted him about this all via text as he said he will be not in the city till dec and might come to meet me in bw, but when I told him ik it all he choose not to respond, not to clarify, didn't even explained himself. 

At last I got my eyes opened up with the way he treated me and told him I'll go to your place and ask your landlord for the cctv footage which might have recorded her entering and going out and that should be enough to prove for all the lies, and cheating you did and cut him out complete. 

I'm shattered, I feel so disgusted that I loved that kind of a person who was promising me a future, he knew I had a hard childhood where I was SAd by my own father and he choose to put that blame on me, he knew i get triggered when someone shouts at front of me and I go numb, I can't tolerate a lie being told to me cause that made me question my own worth, I feel like i don't deserve love and i never will and no one will love me. 

He put me there back in which took me years to come out off, within just months, my gut never agreed to sleep with him, i always told him I'm not ready to have sex, even though if I was my expression turned him off and he said you aren't. 

Should I let his brother know, ik he might be happy and living his life with that girl, but what did I do deserve this? I was loving him, i never cheated, never lied, was always true to him, was always there for him. 

And his brother is getting married to a girl he's been with 5 years that's what love is, he compared their relationship infront of me and told me you can't maintain a long term relationship only because I have the ability to raise questions and confront him all the damn time because of his own actions. 

Would i ruin his marriage if I let him know? Would that deeply affecte their relationship this time for sure? I want him to suffer the way he made me suffer. ",2,1760102539.0,TwoHotTakes,6,1.0,False

Apparently these substances are supposed to have noticeable physiological effects. That's what I've heard all my life, from personal accounts, memes, advice, news, warnings about addiction, etc.

But I've never noticed any effects whatsoever. Maybe they're there and I'm just failing to notice them because I have a poor sense of my own mental and physical state or something.

Alex thought he was clever. He thought he could quietly toast bread, spread peanut butter, and sip his coffee without incident.  
But Captain Mango was clever-er.

The parrot sat perched on top of the fridge, eyes narrowed like a feathered ninja, waiting for his moment.  
As soon as Alex turned to grab the milk *whoosh!* a green blur shot across the kitchen.

When Alex turned back, his toast was gone.

From somewhere in the house came a muffled voice:

>

Alex froze. Captain Mango had learned that phrase from **too much exposure to Saturday morning cartoons**.  
And he used it with disturbing accuracy.

Moments later, the parrot appeared in the doorway peanut butter smeared across his beak, feathers sticking up like he’d survived an explosion.

“Captain Mango,” Alex said sternly.  
The bird tilted his head, blinked once, and replied in his best human voice:

>

Later that day, Mango discovered the door to the living room mirror had been left open.  
For the next hour, Alex heard dramatic squawking and the occasional:

>

By evening, Mango had declared war on his reflection, won, and then danced a victory jig to the sound of Alex’s phone alarm which he’d also learned to imitate.

At bedtime, Alex finally sat down, exhausted, while Mango muttered from his cage:

And just as Alex drifted off to sleep, he heard one last faint whisper from the dark:

I left the pub around 10 PM when a friend of mine, who does ride sharing, was around and came to pick me up. When I got home I invited him to have a smoke and give him a coffee because he wanted to work all night. I told my girlfriend I’m home and that he will stay to have a coffee and then he will leave and she got mad because she said that she wanted to talk on the phone with me before bed. I told her that it will take 15-20 minutes and then we can talk because i wasn't really comfortable ignoring my friend after inviting him and after he got me home for free while he could've kept working. 

She said that she doesn't wanna 'wait in line' to talk to me and that she doesn't want to talk anymore and will just go to sleep. Today she messaged me and said that i should have thought about her wanting to talk to me and she said she didn't find it necessary for me to invite my friend to stay for coffee. 

This is not the first time she gets mad at me for spending time with my friends. Many times, i would end up having to explain to her why I want to go see some friends because, in her opinion, i want this way too often. And its happening like once in two weeks for me to want to hang out with my friends. I also invite her but many times she doesn't want to come with me. 

She is also hanging out with her friends once in every few months which for me is a bit strange but i never judged it because they are her friends. It seems to me like she is trying to control me and its come to the point where i feel like i am doing something wrong if i just want to hang out with my friends. 

I tried to explain to her many times but she just refuses to make efforts to accept this. I also reduced the times i am hanging out with my friends because of this, because i wanted to avoid this kind of situation. 

Also, this summer my friends went to Greece for holiday and also invited us but of course we didn't go because she was not feeling comfortable with them and with the destination and a lot of other details. So we ended up going on holiday by ourselves which I liked but i also would have liked going with my friends because that was something i discussed with them for more than a year. 

I am feeling like i have to give up a lot of things for her while she is not really doing any efforts to do better, she just comes up with even more requests. And somehow, its always my fault if she gets mad. I tried to explain to her that some of her requests are not healthy for a relationship and that i would like for her to try and reflect on them but she just refuses and says that this is the way she sees them and can't accept it any other way, which i find toxic. 

We are together for 10 months now but i am starting to feel like this is not the relationship I want for my life. I am 28 and she is 27.",1,1760102198.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

The first day felt amazing. The second day, I realized how quiet it really gets when there’s no background noise, no phone, no city hum. It was beautiful, but kind of unsettling. At night, every twig snap sounded like a bear. I barely slept, but when morning came, I just sat outside my tent with coffee and felt a kind of peace I haven’t felt in years.  
Now that I’m home, I catch myself missing that silence. Sometimes I’ll turn off everything, sit in the dark and try to recreate that calm. But nothing really matches it.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Didn't have time to shower to wash it off, and the thought of smelling this scent for 8 hours (its amouge, so the thing lasts) filled me with dread. So I grabbed my cheap Khamrah Qahwa and sprayed it on, hopping to mask the scent. 

The thing is that this combo was amazing. Feels really odd to be spraying a $40 perfume over a $400 one, but that sweetness and coffee really worked with Material.

1o30d8m,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1o30d8m/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

I've planned 20 stalls with things to buy, freebies, games, loyalty programmes, and some NPCs (mostly shopkeepers). These stalls will be shops the PC can go visit during their time at Strixhaven and each stall is catered to one of my PC real life or character interests so theres something for everyone. It's taken a long time to plan but I'm super proud of them and thought I'd share the Wyrms Book (coffee place) featuring sentient dragon pushies

The Wyrms Nook- coffee place
This stall is slightly smoky and smells faintly of spice and singed parchment. Themed heavily around Dragon law it features small statues holding cups of piping hot drinks. The stall is also covered in Dragon scale notebooks and Dragon breath scented candles. Plushies of wyrms in a range of colours are stacked in neat lines to one side each wearing a T-shirt advertising the wyrms nook.

What the stall is selling– tea and coffee
Tea of the wyrm– a spiced blend infused with a hint of cinnamon 4GP
Dragon fire roast coffee – bold, dark, and smoky with lingering warmth 4 GP
Hot chocolate Inferno – thick and sweet with a pinch of chilli 4 GP.
Add scaled syrups (ember caramel, molten vanilla, frostbite mint) for one GP

Freebie – a insulated travel mug with the wyrms nook logo on it and the phrase hatch your day right. Bring to the nook and get 20% off.
Loyalty scheme – tea and tome card– your 10th drink is free. Free scone with every hot drink purchased on a Sunday.

Freshers fair challenge – the Wyrmling latte art contest.
Participants try their hand at creating Dragon themed latte art using enchanted form
Rule a performance or slight of hand check to determine the quality of the design. The magical judges which are the Dragon pushes hold up score cards after each attempt and their score gets added to a magical leaderboard. The judges score is equal to your role.
Prizes,
First place – 20 GP store credit and a limited edition plushie wearing a branded apron.
Runner up – a set of collectible wyrm nook branded spoons and a voucher for one free drink

Rules, results, and descriptions to read out.
One to 5– disaster brew – your foam dragon looks more like a soggy worm. One judge dramatically faints
6 to 10 – scotch attempt – it vaguely resembles a lizard… If the lizard melted the judges politely clap
11 to 15 – respectable dragon doodle – your latte dragon is clearly a dragon and the tail even curls nicely. The judge is nod approvingly
16 to 19 – masterful mug art – your dragon looks alive! The form even breathes little puffs of steam. The judges cheer and toss confetti sprinkles
20 – legendary latte.– Your full dragon takes flight circling the cup before landing back inside neatly. The crowd roars and the judges bow in respect.

I’m pretty chill and can talk about almost anything — from gaming and history to music or random everyday stuff. I really enjoy the outdoors — hiking, exploring nature, or just being outside in the fresh air. When I’m not out there, I’m usually playing games or watching a good series or some manga/anime.

I love reading books, drinking coffee, and going to pubs with friends — I’m not picky, I can enjoy both quiet nights and fun nights out. I get along with everyone, and I’m always ready for a good chat, whether it’s deep talks or just jokes and random topics.

I’m also a big animal lover — I’ve got four dogs and more cats than I can count. They make life busy, but I wouldn’t trade it for anything.

When it comes to music, I listen to almost everything, but I’ve got a special love for rock, metal, and nu-metal. Basically, if it sounds good, I’ll enjoy it.

Overall, I’m just a curious guy who likes good company, good music, and good vibes — always down to meet new people and share stories.

I'm genuinely interested in getting to know people from different backgrounds, especially the wonderful women from Kerala (Mallu girls) who work in my area.

I've made a few attempts to start casual, friendly conversations—whether it's been in the canteen, near the coffee machine, or during project-related interactions. My approach has always been respectful and professional, keeping the initial talk about work or casual, common topics.

However, I've noticed a pattern that's left me a bit confused, and I'd love to get some insights from the community here. More often than not, the conversation is extremely brief. I sometimes get a vibe that they are reserved, guarded, or immediately shut down the interaction, and it leaves me feeling like I'm hitting a cultural or communication barrier I don't understand.

I'm not looking to complain, but I'm trying to understand the perspective better.

Is there a general hesitation toward North Indian boys? If so, what are the common reasons behind it? Is it a language barrier (I speak English/Hindi, but no Malayalam), cultural differences, or perhaps stereotypes I'm unaware of?

Am I approaching this incorrectly in a professional setting like an IT park? Should I avoid attempting to strike up conversations altogether?

For the Mallu girls here, what makes you open up to someone, and what kind of initial approach feels respectful and welcoming to you?

For the North Indian guys who have made friends or dated, what was your experience, and what worked for you?

Finally, since I'm new to Coimbatore, are there any local social norms or contexts I might be missing in how people interact socially here? Any general tips for meeting people in the city would be great!

I appreciate any genuine, respectful insights you can share. Thanks!",2,1760101225.0,coimbatoremalayalis,2,0.75,False

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

So picture day was last week. I wanted him to wear a ""handsome"" shirt which is just a button up and some jeans. He really faught me on this and we compromised with his regular t shirt being underneath since I think his main issue at the time was that he doesn't like how it feels. It was a cool short sleeve, black with skulls on it button up. He came home from school and it's not on. I guess we will have to wait till we get the pictures to see if he actually wore it or took it off. Today is feild trip to the pumpkin patch!! I volunteered because well its near a river and my son has been diagnosed with adhd and I just am really scared he'll wander so i volunteered to help the teachers. Im dressing autumny and I wanna take picture with him. He's not really a picture person. I put him in a long sleeve plad button up. And some carhart jumper. He was crying that everyone's gonna tell him that he looks like a scarecrow or a farmer.. I change the jumper to jeans and his red converse. He genuinely looks handsome. But hes sobbing. He already doesn't like jeans he likes ""comfy pants"" which are just sweatpanst or joggers. We were already in the car and he is sobbing and crying that he's going to get made fun of that he looks like an old man. I just got a call that he has not calmed down so now im bringing him another shirt. I know this whole meltdown and fight was completely avoidable but I just want some good pictures without a random design plastered in the front. Am I the asshole? I feel like a ruined his supposed to be fun day and now he'll remember this. EDIT: i see that I am the asshole in this situation. I did come to school and offer a few options of his favorite clothes. Yall are right. I shouldn't make it about me and I should've absolutely listened to his comfort. I feel terrible. And selfish. Not that it matters to a bunch of strangers but after the pumpkin patch im taking him to 7 brew coffee company. He's never been but it's new in our town and hes been asking about it since it opened. No idea why but it's just his hyperfixation at the moment even though he wants a ""pink drink"" from there. I am a parent who verbally apologizes aswell but I just want to offer him a treat.

I’m Marco, 29M from Italy, and I’ll be moving to Finland soon for work (Oulu, to be exact!). I thought it’d be nice to get to know a few people before the move, maybe someone who can give me some tips about life up north, or just chat about random stuff while I get ready for the big change.

By day I’m a chemistry postdoc, which mostly means long hours staring at structures and occasionally talking to Python scripts like they’re coworkers. Outside the lab, I’m into all the classic nerdy goodness: anime, manga, video games, and especially Magic: The Gathering (Commander players, where you at?). I’ve been spending a lot of time on Monster Hunter Wilds lately, so if you need a hunting partner, hit me up!

I also play bass (emo/core is my thing), love cooking (homemade pizza is serious business in this household), and recently realized I really enjoy going to the cinema, there’s something great about getting lost in a big screen story. Oh, and if politics ever come up: I’m solidly on the left.

If you’re into gaming, music, science tangents, food pics, movie recs, or just some casual conversation to pass the time, feel free to drop a message. Would be great to chat, and maybe even grab a coffee once I’m in Finland! ☕",1,1760101016.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Seats were a bit outdated but comfortable. IFE selection was surprisingly good but the moving map and interface was very outdated, and no real headphones were provided as per usual in PE. The catering was very impressive. The food was excellent, and also served in porcelain like in Business, which was surprising for Premium. The crew was friendly and attentive, and passed through the cabin several times offering tea, coffee, gummy bears, nuts, chips and other ""movie snacks"". I booked the ticket three weeks in advance for 300 USD OSL-BOS (AF/KL was 500)

Note: the first leg OSL-CPH was in Europe Business which was a pleasant surprise that no other airline offers to Premium Economy passengers. I earned 60 Flying Blue XP one way, which is excellent. Also, my Flying Blue Gold status gave me lounge access at OSL and CPH though I'm not sure whether regular PE passengers can expect this.

1o303za,https://www.reddit.com/r/waifuism/comments/1o303za/scheming_midna_and_riju/,Scheming (Midna and Riju),"Riju sat in the café that served as a rendezvous point when her father couldn’t get to the school right away to pick her up. She use to ride the bus but the rides home and occasional coffee stops and the absence of the din of the bus they offered helped her get homework done faster while retaining the lesson. If she didn’t have any homework, she used the time to just breathe and enjoy the pause in her busy schedule. That and who says no to free coffee as her father would get her something before leaving for home. Today was one of those days where she had no homework so she decided to read a book while she waited only to break focus on her book when the bell on the door rang, breaking the silence for a brief second to signal the coming and going of other patrons. She didn’t mind the bell as it wasn’t too obnoxious and it helped her keep track of time and check her phone on her father’s progress.

One ringing of the bell announced the arrival of a familiar face. A woman a half foot taller than Riju if she were to stand up. Her eyes were red and had an air of mischievousness about her though her facial expression was that of confidence. She too was a red head like Riju but hers was more orange like embers a dying campfire and practically glowed like it too. Riju knew this to be Midna. She helped in her school arts department when she found time and that was how they crossed paths from time to time. She also lives in her neighborhood and sometimes helps mentor checks up on Riju in the really rare instances where Mokoto is running super late since being a truck driver doesn’t merit a traditional nine to five shift. Because of this Riju looks up to Midna.

The two locked eyes and Midna winked with a warm smile. She grabbed her drink and walked over to Riju. “Hey, is this seat taken?”

“Hey, Midna.” Riju greeted her back. “Sorry, let me move my stuff out of the way.”

Riju cleared a spot for Midna who then sat down. “I hear congratulations are in order.” Midna started out of the gate.

“Yeah, it’s been four months now but I still am feeling like it hasn’t even happened yet.” Riju said bewildered.

“It’s no small thing to get adopted.” Midna said. “In time it’ll feel as natural as breathing. I’m just glad you don’t have to worry about finding a permanent home again and I couldn’t think of anyone more perfect to adopt you than Mokoto. Although speaking of him, is he running late again today?”

“Yeah.” Riju said nonchalantly since it didn’t bother her. “Got a text from dad just as school let out it’ll be a good hour or so with his usual apologies.”

“Hang on…” Midna said taken aback.

“Yes I said dad.” Riju said knowing what Midna was thinking. “Now that it’s official I say ‘dad’ publicly although it slipped from my tongue before I was adopted.”

“Really?” Midna asked. “How did Mokoto take it the first time?”

“He was stunned in silence for a good minute.” Riju said smiling as she reminisced, “I knew he was in agony as he had to correct me telling me I had to call him by name since he was only a foster parent at the time. Although he was touched and I suspect that was the moment he decided to apply to be my actual guardian.”

“That’s a sweet story.” Midna said genuinely moved “Does it bother you that his job isn’t as consistent as far as hours go? Or that it isn’t an office job?”

“No.”Riju said unsure where the question was coming from. “At first it did bother me a little when I first was placed into his custody, but I learned that he comes back and communicates when he’s delayed. But that was when I never had a place that felt home and it was still new sharing a house with three other people I didn’t know at all. As things became more consistent.”

“I’m glad.” Midna stated. “Also don’t get me wrong, I respect his choice of profession and I know it pays well. I was just seeing how you felt about it. And it seems you’re quite mature in that front. I hope I didn’t upset you.”

“It’s okay.” Riju assured her. “I know you two get along too well for you to ask something like that out of spite. I was just caught off guard because I wasn’t expecting it.”

“That’s good to hear. Did you want something?” Midna offered pointing behind her at the menu.

“I know better than not to refuse,” Riju smirked, “but you know dad’s going to try and pay you back.”

“You should know by now I won’t let him.” Midna said confidently.

“He won’t let it go so easily. He’s stubborn like that.”

“So am I.” Midna said rising from her seat. “Come on.”

The two went to the menu and ordered a drink for themselves and one for Makoto when he arrived. They received their orders and went back to their corner booth.

“My turn for questions.” Riju started.

“Go ahead.” Midna said as she took a sip.

“When are you and dad going to start dating?” Riju asked bluntly.

Midna almost did a spit take but managed to keep the coffee in her mouth contained. She swallowed and after a few coughs to clear her wind pipes, asked “Dating?!”

“I see the way you interact with each other.” Riju explained. “You two get along so well and would make an adorable couple. That and do you not feel the tension between you two?”

Midna blushed slightly, “You noticed that did you?” She said regaining her confident smile.

“I’d have to be my father not to.” Riju said. “Do you want to try?”

“I wouldn’t say no if he asked.” Midna admitted. “I’m surprised someone hasn’t taken him already.

“He’s too oblivious for that.” Riju said. “He may match you in alot of things personality wise, but when it comes to knowing if someone is trying to hit on him, he needs a neon sign and a megaphoned message.”

“I can definitely now see that.” Midna chuckled.

“I did ask him about dating in general and after I convinced him I was okay with it if he did and wasn’t trying to push him in hopes of getting a mother or something like that.”

“What did he say?”

“He appreciated my concern and if the right person comes along at the right time, he would be open to the idea. But for now taking care of me was enough for him.”

“I’m glad he has his priorities straight.” Midna said as she smiled at the answer. Clearly willing to let the subject drop.

But Riju was not quite yet. “Don’t you want to know what he said when I asked about you?”

At that point Mokoto entered the cafe undetected by Midna but Riju saw.

“You are a sinister young lady.” Midna stated admitting she was now curious but unsure if it was okay to hear it. But her curiosity won. “Go on then. You have me intrigued.”

“I would tell you.” Riju said as she wrote down her number on her napkin and slid it over to Midna. “But wouldn’t you want to hear it from him yourself?”

“Wait wha…” Was all Midna could get out before Mokoto found them.

“There you are.” He said with a smile. “Oh! Hey, Midna. What brings you here?”

Midna was too befuddled to answer right away which caused Riju to step in. “Hey, dad. I forgot to get a new book a the store next door.”

“Alright then.” Mokoto said as he started to pick up Riju’s things to leave. But Riju stopped him.

“No it’s fine. I’ll be in and out. We got you coffee. Why don’t you just sit and watch my stuff. You just got off work.”

Totally oblivious, Mokoto sat down, “If you say so.

Riju whispered in Midna’s ear, “Let me know how it goes.”

Midna still somewhat blushing gave her an accusing but grateful expression while whispering back, “You sneaky little…”

“You’re welcome.” Riju said cutting her off. She then walked hurriedly out the cafe to the book store and waited for a bit not knowing she successfully made the spark that would indeed lead to Mokoto and Midna dating and eventually getting married.",5,1760100887.0,waifuism,1,1.0,False

my ex and i were in a relationship before i went on a long trip abroad travelling. he knew i had a semester off and i wanted to travel and i also knew he was going overseas for at least 2 years for his phd, which he told me he was planning to go in december. he’s very logical in his decisions it took me 4 months to convince him to be a relationship with me bc he knew he was moving a way and doesn’t do long distance ( im still a student in my home town so i couldn’t move). he recently just texted me yesterday after 4 months of not talking, not wishing me happy birthday, and said although he doesn’t have expectations for me to respond he’d love to catch up when im back. He also wished my grandma a belated birthday the day before reaching out (kinda random). He said he would be leaving in late january for his PhD abroad and wants to catch up for coffee. Part of me thinks he wouldn’t do this unless he was wanting something out of it? he wouldn’t keep friendly or continue talking to an ex and i also don’t see him wanting long distance. I asked him what his goal out of the coffee meetup and he didn’t answer that question so now i’m confused. Id like to checkin and remain friendly but wouldnt have cut off contact in the first place either like he did.

It completely shakes them up. Suddenly their moral posturing is blown out of the water once a mirror is held up.

In fairness, I do sometimes get a respectable answer- a vegan admits that there is a lot of suffering no matter where you look in the food industry, and that they do genuinely advocate for more humane conditions and put effort into ensuring they avoid exploitive produce.

But most of them...

A vegan was bitching at some commenter about how them eating animal products contributed to an industry of suffering, so I asked the vegan how they ensure the veggies they eat haven't been picked by exploited or slave labor.

Multiple people answered, and those answers ranged from (I am paraphrasing) ""yeah humans suffer in poor working conditions, so?"" to ""no ethical consumption under capitalism"" or ""but, animal products bad!"" and then ""stop derailing the conversation."" That last line was especially funny as it came right after they tried to sidestep my question by pointing fingers back at animal agriculture, ignoring the question completely.

For the longest time I thought the hate against vegans was unwarranted. But the more I witness their hypocrisy and insufferable superiority complexes, the more I grow to deeply dislike them.

If they simply avoided meat/animal products and advocated for animal welfare, hell- even if they advocated for the vegan diet in a normal, unspiteful way, I'd think them noble. Everyone should be entitled to their own dietary choices. And even if I eat meat, I too believe livestock must be treated humanely. But instead vegans have demonstrated more interest in moral flexing than actual activism.

They accuse ""carnists"" of propping up an industry of abuse, yet when they do the exact same thing suddenly it's okay because ""animal products bad.""

And this isn't even getting into their general hatred towards human welfare. They do not care if a vegan diet causes health or economic hardship to vulnerable groups, just as they do not care if it was a five year old picking the beans for their morning coffee.

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

This new update has some changes that relied on submitting a new build to Apple so it took longer than expected. To get the latest change you will need to download **v1.0.5** from the app store.

While I was waiting I added... just a few features, enjoy 😂

**Features**

\- Added a new setting to autoplay gifs and videos (labeled ""beta"" and disabled by default) (requested by... lot's of people!)  
\- Added ability to double tap to zoom images (requested by u/Zrob24)  
\- Added ability to save comments (requests by... I didnt write your name down sorry)  
\- Added ability to save animated gifs as videos (requested by u/SmirG3l)  
\- Added ability to save individual gallery images, or download all, also I'll look at improving the UI for this in the future (long press on the desired image) (requested by u/ChairmanTariffman)  
\- Added ability to sort user posts and comments (requested by u/kilgara101)  
\- Added ability to sort Subreddit by ""best"", set ""best"" as the default instead of ""hot"" (requested by u/Yeeshak)  
\- Added ability to choose comment skip button position, left, right or none (requested by u/Glitch_Zero)  
\- Added ability to mark posts as seen on scroll (labeled ""beta"" as currently it is not possible to enable it the same time as ""hide read posts"") (requested by... lot's of people!)  
\- Updated image dismissal to be more smooth (can swipe up or down)  
\- Updated GIF's so they now load \*\*significantly\*\* faster  
\- Updated text posts so the text preview is also greyed out when viewed  
\- ...probably other things I am forgetting!

**Fixes**

\- Fix an issue where white flashes could sometimes by seen on the edge of the screen when swiping back and forth (reported by u/MisterMooth)

**Misc**

\- Custom swipe gestures are now implemented but are not live in the app yet, I'll enable this after I implement a few more swipe actions.

**Support**

If you like what I do and want to support the project, consider getting me a coffee ☕

**Screenshots**

A lot of the new functionality is a bit hard to show in screenshots, so instead I'll just show an image of the WIP swipe gesture screen

by Preston Dennett

Among the many fascinating UFO encounters reported over the last fifty years, those in which UFOs actually land and humanoid beings emerge are particularly compelling. These cases have been documented across the world. The cases presented in this video include the United States, Brazil, Australia, Italy, Spain, Norway, Finland, Scotland, France, and England. Spanning five decades, these incidents showcase a remarkable variety of humanoid figures and often involve multiple witnesses. Many of the cases include some form of tangible evidence, such as landing traces, unusual animal behavior, electromagnetic disturbances, psychic phenomena, and physiological reactions. In several instances, government involvement is noted, and some witnesses have even reported unsettling threats from mysterious ""men in black.""

July 23, 1947 – Pitanga, Brazil

Jose C. Higgins, a topographer, hears a high-pitched hum before a metallic craft lands nearby. Three beautiful extraterrestrials, dressed in unusual spacesuits, exit the craft and surround him. While initially fearful, Higgins finds the beings friendly and observes them from a distance as they begin to play like small children.

August 1960 – Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia

Helen Aldridge is awakened by a buzzing noise outside her home. Looking through her window, she sees a craft shaped like a toy top land in her backyard. A humanoid in an olive-green jumpsuit exits the craft, climbs over her fence, and approaches her window, leaving her shocked and alarmed.

July 31, 1966 – Presque Isle State Park, Pennsylvania, USA

After their car becomes stuck in the sand, Gerald LaBelle leaves for help, while Betty Klem, Doug Tibbets, Anita Haifley, and her two children remain behind. Suddenly, a UFO lands in the adjacent forest. Police arrive and, together with Doug, go to investigate. At that moment, a large, hairy humanoid emerges from the forest and attacks the car. Officers from Project Blue Book soon arrive on the scene to conduct an investigation.

August 29, 1967 – Cussac, France

Thirteen-year-old Francois Delpeuch and his nine-year-old sister Ann-Marie are searching for their family’s cows when they encounter a glowing sphere and four small humanoids beneath it. As the children approach for a closer look, the beings notice them and float, one by one, back into their craft.

February 5, 1971 – Kinnula, Finland

Forestry workers Peter Aliranta and Esko Sneck are shocked when a UFO lands near their position in the forest. A 4-foot-tall being emerges and approaches Peter. As the being turns to re-enter the craft, Peter impulsively grabs its foot—a decision he would later regret.

November 14, 1976 – Winchester, England

Joyce Bowles and her friend Edwin Pratt are driving home when they see a UFO descending onto the road ahead. Their car suddenly steers itself off the road. When they come to a stop, they find a UFO blocking their way, with humanoids visible through its windows. One being emerges, approaches them, and stares at them intently, marking the beginning of a bizarre experience.

May 18, 1977 – Elgin, Scotland

Ten-year-old friends Karen McLennan and Fiona Morrison hear a soft humming in the woods near their homes and go to investigate. They discover a landed craft and a tall, slender man in a silvery jumpsuit standing beside it. The girls flee as he approaches, seeing the craft take off as they look back. Later, they learn that other witnesses saw the event—and that threats soon followed.

September 18, 1978 – San Giorgio di Nogaro, Italy

Railway employee Giorgio Filiputti is enjoying a day of fishing when he hears a strange noise and notices an odd breeze. Investigating, he discovers a landed craft and a surprised humanoid around four feet tall. The being stares at Giorgio before resuming what appears to be repairs on the craft.

November 24, 1978 – Gerena, Spain

Four young men hunting along the Guadiamar River witness strange lights in the forest. They encounter a landed UFO and a 7-foot-tall humanoid figure. As the figure approaches, the men panic and flee the scene. Later, investigators find unusual traces at the landing site.

July 25, 1981 – Stjordal, Norway

Hjordis Hokstad, hoping to enjoy a morning coffee and watch deer behind her house, instead observes a landed UFO and a humanoid in a spacesuit walking near the craft. Using binoculars, she gets a clear view of the scene, while unbeknownst to her, her neighbor is also witnessing the event from his home.

The overwhelming evidence presented by these cases makes it increasingly difficult to deny the reality of UFOs and extraterrestrial encounters. For those willing to examine the evidence, it is apparent that we are not alone and that the universe may be filled with a diversity of intelligent life forms.

1o2zvx0,https://www.reddit.com/r/walmart/comments/1o2zvx0/help_i_cant_finish_my_work/,Help I cant finish my work,"I work overnight. I’m trying my hardest, or at least I used to exhaust myself trying to finish freight every night. I’ve been here six months now. I think the problem is my managers but I want other opinions for cognitive dissonance reasons. 

TLDR; not enough equipment or it’s broken, breaking down boxes and other useless tasks eating up time, manager won’t let me just stock efficiently. (Problems are labeled PROBLEM)


I was started in paper with 8-13 pallets to myself every night for around 4 months. This includes trash bags, plates, etc. At first I was stocking pretty fast until (PROBLEM A) I was told I can’t leave trash on the floor, ONLY in empty shopping cart, larger box, or pallet, and that I HAVE to break the boxes down. I almost never finished on time and had to stay over finishing pallets of heavy trash bags until I was told I had too much overtime. 

FINALLY I asked to try a different section a few times and I was allowed to move to grocery and do cans which was immediately easier. Recently I’ve been doing cereal and coffee. I still don’t finish my work in time. I was working relatively fast until told to deal with the trash in a specific way. (PROBLEM B) They’ve now also implemented zoning hour at 11:00 pm when the store closes, which only gets messed up and has to be fixed at the end of the night anyway. 

(PROBLEM C) There is never enough pallet jacks or top stock carts for everyone to have one, or either for that matter. Most of the jacks are broken and difficult to use, and people aren’t inclined to share top stock carts at my store. People are possessive lol like “hey that’s MY cart!”. There’s sort of a rush at the start of the night to nab a cart and if you don’t get one you just don’t get one. I used to spend almost an hour walking around looking for a jack or a cart at the start of my shift but I got told that I was wasting too much time so I just don’t bother looking anymore. I shouldn’t have to show up super early just to make sure I have the equipment needed for the job right? 


I have a non Walmart box cutter which has SIGNIFICANTLY sped up my work especially since I’m asked to break down all the boxes. I’ve tried doing a bit of organizing on the pallet before stocking which also helps, and pulling the pallet around on a jack instead of walking so much also definitely helps. I’m also tall enough that I can top stock immediately sometimes which is handy. I’ve tried to get along with my managers and team leads. I did best with the team lead that left me alone and let me work. The other managers gripe at me and I feel quite micromanaged, if I ignored everything they told me I’d get the work done with time to spare. I tried that and it made them watch me closer and gripe at me even more. ",1,1760100296.0,walmart,0,1.0,False
1o2zuis,https://www.reddit.com/r/redscarepod/comments/1o2zuis/my_profoundly_woke_apology_to_the_divine/,My Profoundly Woke Apology to the Divine Sisterhood,"Oh, radiant goddesses of the female collective, I prostrate myself before your sacred intersectional altar to atone for the egregious sins of my comrade-in-arms, Alex, who has tragically fumbled the feminist football.

This unenlightened soul dared to cast shade upon Marie’s voluptuous majesty and Chantal’s, ahem, unique oral aura, as if he were the arbiter of feminine perfection. And clutch your ethically sourced pearls : he proclaimed that women with petite bosoms and, dare I say, expansive cranial canvases should “stay away” from his dubious charm. 

Now, let me bare my soul and confess a sin so vile it haunts my woke nightmares: I laughed. Yes, sisters, when Alex spewed his patriarchal drivel, a chuckle escaped my lips—a fleeting, misguided giggle that I now recognize as a betrayal of the divine feminine. I was but a weak vessel, momentarily swayed by the toxic bro-code algorithm, and for this, I am scheduling my own cancellation at the earliest convenience.

Alex, my dude, did you time-travel from a patriarchy convention in 1952 hahaha (in deep voice) ?

To the plus-size queens, the Eastern European luminaries, and the radiant Gypsy sisterhood, I offer my deepest, most hashtag blessed apologies for Alex’s unmentionable verbal atrocities (spoilers: they’re too cringeworthy for this sacred space lmaooo).
Your nose size is total average.
His words were a violent affront to body positivity, cultural solidarity, and the sacred tenets of third-wave feminism.

And now, let me bare my soul: when the group chat demanded my stance on Alex’s patriarchal pandemonium, I, in a moment of weakness, lobbed a meme into the discourse. A meme! The horror! I confess I briefly succumbed to the toxic bro-code algorithm, and for that, I am canceling myself retroactively.

But oh sisters, the plot thickens. 

I must confess a final deeply problematic flaw in my journey toward enlightenment. In my heart of hearts, I, a flawed mortal, still harbor a primal yearning for, ahem, abundant physical affection and, shall we say, intimate oral appreciation. Yes, I dream of bosoms in my vicinity and acts of devotion that I shan’t detail further! I lay this bare not to objectify, but to expose my own messy humanity, still tangled in the vines of cishet desire. I’m working on it, I swear, probably via a 12-step program for recovering bro thoughts.

Rest assured, I’ve dragged Alex to the nearest feminist book club (metaphorically, of course) and read him the riot act from the pages of bell hooks herself. He’s on a journey of unlearning, and I’m right there with him, clutching my reusable coffee cup and my allyship checklist. To the divine sisterhood, I vow to center your truths, uplift your vibes, and keep my memes in the drafts. May we rise together in a kaleidoscope of empowerment!

I’m a mega-beginner and my grandma just gave me her old magimix 11419. It’s not a great machine but I can’t invest right now, and I feel like it’s good for practice.

BUT the steam wand seems impossible to use, it’s vertical and doesn’t really move except from back to front, and I’ve only been able to get foam from it. And mostly cold foam btw, unless I plunge it right at the bottom of my pitcher. 

Of course my technique is not great yet, but I’ve tried loads of tutorials and can’t seem to get to anything remotely close to microbubbles. So what I’m asking is, can I make anything other than foam with this wand, how, and also, can I customize it, change it or destroy it (lol) so it worksbetter?

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

Everyone I knew from high school either stayed in the burbs or moved to like denver or austin. My coworkers are cool but they're all in wicker park or pilsen and coordinate everything weeks in advance which is not really my vibe.

1o2zprg,https://www.reddit.com/r/HPylori/comments/1o2zprg/is_this_h_pylori/,Is this H. Pylori?,"For context I have had a diagnosis of IBS- main symptoms being bloating, irregular bowel movements and feeling gassy for 5 years. My entire later teens/early 20’s has been based around my bowel movements and it’s always been passed off as amusing and unserious but I’m starting to think this “IBS” was something else. E.g- not eating before an event due to fear of gas/ constipation/ needing to ‘go’. And despite family and friends joking about it it has been somewhat debilitating.  

1 month ago, I had a day of considerably bad diarrhoea, going 5 times a day. Didn’t think much of it as I had been having lots of coffee. The next day I am sat eating yogurt and all of a sudden my vision jolted up, I felt a bit dizzy, had a sudden fast heart, feeling short of breath and extreme anxiety. I started pacing and I was so scared, I genuinely thought I was having a heart attack so I called 999 (Stupid I know). While waiting in A&E this dizziness/strange “out of body” vision and nausea kept occurring in waves. The ECG was fine, they fobbed me off as being anxious. 

Following this, for the past month, I have been suffering with the worst health anxiety of my life. Dizziness, extreme tiredness, gas, 3 weeks of green acidic diarrhoea followed by now an inability to even push a stool out. Pins and needles in my face and legs, to the point where I convinced myself I had a blood clot. Thirstiness, absolute 0 hunger, a lightheaded feeling after standing up for too long. Pressure over my left eye. Cold and hot flushes. Shivering. Burping (which I NEVER do usually), having to do yoga to relieve a constant stream of silent gas (Sorry). A constant dry throat. 
In the first two weeks I cried to my partner in an absolute state of panic, convinced I was dying. I have never ever had such bad health anxiety. My arms have been tingling, my legs have been tingling. 

Following the A&E trip I went to the doctors who ordered another ECG, blood tests, and two stool samples: One for H. pylori. I had never heard of this. All blood tests are fine- Sod’s law I have now been waiting 12 days for the H. pylori result. 

I was called back to the doctors this week, by the receptionist, who told me that my H. pylori result was back. I was so excited to finally be prescribed the treatment I have been reading about- only to find out the receptionist somehow got it wrong and the results are still in process. I went to the doctors today and honestly I burst out crying- the receptionists gave me false hope and this has become so debilitating. 

I have now been prescribed Omeprazole while we wait for the results, to take when needed, to help with my gas- yet I’ve now read that H. pylori thrives in low acid environments?

I am almost certain at this point that I have H. pylori but while I wait for the result what can I do? I have peppermint oil, peppermint tea, paracetemol and propranolol. 

So my questions are 1. Does this sound like H. Pylori? And if so, any other self- help suggestions?

What a Trademark Can Protect

Trademarks safeguard brand elements that make your product or business unique. That might include:
🔸Business names (if distinct, like “Coca-Cola” — not “Best Pizza”)
🔸Logos or symbols (think Nike swoosh, McDonald’s arches)
🔸Slogans/taglines (“Just do it”)
🔸Product names (iPhone, Big Mac)
🔸Sounds & jingles (NBC’s chimes, MGM’s lion roar)
🔸Colors tied to branding (Tiffany blue, UPS brown)
🔸Packaging or trade dress (the Coca-Cola bottle shape)
🔸Mascots or characters (Geico Gecko, Pillsbury Doughboy)
🔸Domain names & hashtags (if distinct, not generic terms)
🔸Event or conference titles (TED Talks, Coachella)

What You Can’t Trademark
🔸Generic words or descriptive terms (like “shoes” or “best coffee”)
🔸Functional product features
🔸Anything misleading or offensive

Why this matters: Securing trademarks gives you exclusive rights to your brand identity, prevents copycats, and builds credibility. While common law gives you some rights just by using a mark in commerce, registering makes defending your brand much easier.",0,1760099752.0,ZenBusinessInc,0,0.5,False

1o2zldf,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1o2zldf/my_wife_is_convinced_that_ive_been_replaced/,"My wife is convinced that I've been replaced. Please help me, I don't know what to do.","Yes, it probably sounds insane... I should start with the backstory, but God, how hard it is to remember the simple, happy times before everything that happened...

I met my wife, Katherine, when she was twenty-four and I was twenty-eight. We lived in a small town in Kentucky, you’d have trouble finding it even with a map and the population was tiny, everyone knew each other. I’d worked as an electrician all my life, first at a factory, then I started my own small business: repairs, wiring, private jobs. My love life had never really worked out until I met her.

She worked as an elementary school teacher, smiled at every child, was kind and polite to everyone. My Katherine was the only ray of light in the darkness around me.

I loved her for her simplicity. She could find joy in the most ordinary things: morning coffee, the smell of wet grass, a cheap movie on the couch. We didn’t have much money, but we had peace, a home, a dog, and that feeling that everything was right, that everything would be fine.

I spent evenings fixing things while she wrote lesson plans or knitted. Sometimes we’d sit in silence, listening to crickets, or stay up all night talking about everything and nothing, thinking about children and what we’d name them.
Back then, it felt like life had finally found its meaning.

The problems began maybe two months ago. At first small things. She started having trouble sleeping, then began looking at me strangely, as if something in my face disturbed her.

I asked if everything was okay, and she laughed:

“Sorry, just tired. The kids at school are driving me crazy"".

Gradually though I can’t even say exactly when it got worse. She slept less. Not because she had insomnia, but because she was afraid to fall asleep.

I asked her what was wrong, but she said she was fine. Still, when we lay together, she’d suddenly get up and go into another room, returning only at dawn. She started having nightmares, but never told me what they were.

One day I lost my temper… You have to understand, I was just worried about my wife. From the lack of sleep she started to look worse—dark circles under her eyes, red eyes, pale skin. She lost weight, and every time I tried to help, she pushed me away. So I sat her down across from me and directly asked what she was dreaming about.

She was silent for a long time, trembling and glancing at me furtively, as if… She was afraid. And then, when tears began to roll down her cheeks, she whispered:

“There’s a man in my dreams… God, I… I’m scared, Tom…”.

I went to hug her, and when I reached for her, she flinched, as if I’d frightened her. After that, things seemed to get better or so I thought. How wrong I was.

She used to ask how my day went, but now she just stared out the window. With each passing day, she spoke to me less and less, her words short and dry, and then she’d go to the bathroom or kitchen for some “errands,” closing the door behind her. And it wasn’t just the silence her eyes had changed.

If before they were green, emerald-like, full of life and love, now her gaze made my spine go cold.

There wasn’t anger or hatred there, no… It was something closer to mistrust. Wariness, as if she was seeing me for the first time.

Over the next week I began to feel anxious, a strange burning under my skin. As if something was wrong, but I couldn’t tell where the crack was until I realized. She was studying me.

When I drank coffee, I could feel her eyes on me. I’d look up and she’d immediately turn away, pretending to slice fruit, but her fingers trembled and the knife froze halfway to the board. I’d step outside for a smoke, and when I turned around, I’d see her peeking through the curtain then she’d instantly close it. When I showered, I’d catch her watching me, studying my body, then she’d run away. She started doing it even while I slept.

She almost stopped talking to me, instead writing something in a notebook and hiding it as soon as I entered the room. Photos began to disappear from their frames, she’d talk on the phone with someone, but hang up the moment I came in. I made an appointment with a psychologist for us, but she refused said she was afraid to be near me.

It all happened so suddenly… It seemed just yesterday we were stargazing in each other’s arms, and now this. The strangeness grew every day. Sometimes she asked me to sleep on the couch. I agreed, hoping it would calm her, but it was useless her paranoia only worsened. It got to the point where, when I tried to hug her, she screamed, “Don’t come near me!” and flinched as if I’d hit her.

After one of those nights, I decided I had to find out what was really going on. Even if it meant taking her to a doctor afterward.

I pretended to be asleep when she stood in the hallway, then she slowly approached soft, careful steps. She stopped at the foot of the bed, and for several seconds there was a dead silence, broken only by her uneven breathing. I could feel her watching. Not just watching comparing. That’s when I became truly terrified, a cold dread twisting inside me as my wife became something I couldn’t recognize.

Then the bed shifted slightly she sat down on the edge. The air grew heavy. I could feel her stare physically, like pressure on my skin. Then her cold fingers gently touched my wrist, held it for a few seconds, then quickly let go, as if burned, and whispered:

“Pulse faster than Tom’s.”

My heart clenched so hard I nearly twitched. She leaned closer. I could hear her breathing against my face short, shaky. She smelled of lavender and something sour that made goosebumps crawl down my back. Her lips barely moved.

“I remember clearly… Tom had a small scar right here…”

She touched my cheek.

“But you don’t.”

I clenched my teeth to keep from gasping. Those few seconds of silence lasted an eternity. What scar? I never had a scar on my cheek I’d know if I did! I wanted to sink into the ground and scream all at once, but I kept lying still until I heard a choked sob and her fading footsteps.

The door slammed. I opened my eyes, my heart pounding furiously. I didn’t sleep for the rest of the night too afraid to close my eyes.

In the morning, I went to work early, dreading the hours until my shift ended. That evening, over dinner, I said:

“Kate, we need to talk. What’s going on?”

She gripped her fork so tightly her knuckles turned white, then looked me dead in the eye.

“Tom, you… you’ve been acting strange.”

“What do you mean?”

“I don’t know. Sometimes you look different. Sometimes your voice sounds wrong. You even smell different.”

I didn’t know what to say. My head was chaos, and somehow I just laughed.

“Kate, maybe you’re just imagining things?”

“I don’t know, Tom.”

My eyes fell on the knife rack. There was a clean strip of dust where the largest kitchen knife should’ve been the one we used for everything, bread, meat, anything. I distinctly remembered it being there before that night. My heart slammed into my throat with a primal panic. I looked at Kate, and she was staring right at me, I wanted to speak, but couldn’t. It hit me then my wife might be planning to kill me.

The next morning she left for work, and I like a caged animal started searching the house. I hadn’t slept in nearly forty-eight hours. I know I should’ve just left, or taken her to a hospital… But she’s my wife. I love her. She has to see that I am me.

I tore through the apartment, frantic, desperate to find something anything that would help me understand what was happening to her. And I did.
After about an hour, in the back of the closet behind a pile of sweaters, I found her wooden box. Old, slightly cracked. The lid was ajar, and when I opened it, a thick notebook fell into my hands. It smelled of coffee and sweat. Her initials on the cover, written in her neat cursive. My heart froze as I realized it was the diary she’d been hiding from me.


The paper bent under my fingers. Her handwriting familiar, but this time jagged, shaky, the page stained with what looked like tears.

“He’s sleeping. I stand by the bed and watch. He looks like Tom, but he’s not. Tom had a scar on his left hand, from that accident by the river. This one’s skin is smooth. He smiles, but the smile doesn’t reach his eyes. Something replaced him… I keep counting days, marking steps… If the real Tom, my husband, is alive, where is he?”.

A wave of nausea rose in my throat. With each page, her handwriting grew more erratic:

“I tested his speech. He says ‘I love you’ in the same tone, but without warmth, not like before. Tom smelled of vanilla, but this one smells of dust and cheap cologne"".

I couldn’t believe what I was reading. My knees trembled, the air around me tightened like a noose. I flipped to the last page.

“I can’t let this thing stay in our house. It wears his smile, his name. I tried talking to it, begging, but it just smiled and said all the right words. It didn’t defend itself. Maybe because it isn’t afraid? Its right hand twitches when it lies. I could have killed IT today, but for some reason I couldn’t… I know I have to. For Tom. I won’t let some monster wear his skin"".

My hands were slick with sweat. My whole body was sweating, even though the room was cold. I placed the diary on the bed and sat down, trying to process everything I’d just read.

An accident? God, she was exaggerating. All that came out of it was a concussion and some bruised ribs. I stayed in the hospital for about… a week. Yeah. Seven days.

Then my phone rang, making me jump. It was Sheriff Martin, a kind old man I’d known for years.

“Tom, everything alright over there? Katherine called. Said someone’s living in your house pretending to be her husband.”

I froze.

“What did you say?”

“Says you’re not you. I’ve known her for yeara always seemed stable. Domestic quarrel, huh?”

“No. Just… stress. She’s tired.”

Evening came slowly.

I sat on the couch, elbows on my knees, looking at an old photograph the one that used to sit on our mantel before all this. Katherine and I by the lake, smiling, her arms around me, the sun so bright that day we had to squint.

I stared at us, at the little details: her blonde hair catching the light, her hand around mine, the green shimmer in our eyes. It felt like a lifetime ago.

When the door creaked open, I nearly jumped. My wife’s if I can still call her that steps were slow and tired, her bag thudding softly to the floor. She looked exhausted, her eyes red, her hair a mess. I stood, holding the diary.

“Kate… we need to talk.”

She looked at me warily, like a trapped animal sensing a snare.

“What’s that in your hand?” Her voice was even, but something trembled in it.

“I… I found this. I need to understand what’s happening,” I said, showing her the diary.

Katherine froze.

For a moment, I thought she’d break down crying but instead, she slowly stepped closer, looking straight into my face, her cold breath brushing against my skin.

“So what did you figure out, Tom? That I’m crazy? You think I’ve lost my mind, don’t you?”

“No. You wrote that I’ve been replaced. That I don’t have a scar.”

She turned away, her lips pressed tight.

“Tom had one. We even joked it made him look tougher.”

“Listen, sweetheart,” I took a step closer, a strange knot tightening in my gut, “I’m the same man. I remember everything, how we met, the candles at our wedding, how you laugh when we watch comedies, what you said about that stupid show when we finished it. I remember everything, Katherine. It’s me.”

She stared at me, unblinking, her shoulders trembling as if she were freezing. I looked into her eyes, and there was something there pain and horror mixed together, as if I stood before her as someone both familiar and wrong.

“You say it like you’ve rehearsed it,” she whispered.

“Because it’s true!” I stepped closer, my voice cracking into a shout. “What do I have to do for you to believe me? What?!”

Katherine said nothing. Just breathed heavily, like she was fighting herself, staring into my eyes. Then she suddenly backed away, step by step, toward her bag. I didn’t realize what was happening at first.

She bent down, as if for a handkerchief… and in the next moment, I saw the glint of metal. A knife. The missing one.

“Kate…” I breathed, disbelieving. “Katherine, put it down…”

“Stop. Stop pretending, you monster.”

I managed half a step toward her—she raised her hand. At first, I thought she was only threatening me. Panic tightened my fists, I wanted to yell, to grab her shoulders, to make her listen but then
A strike. Burning pain slashed through my chest, everything went white. The last thing I saw was her face so familiar, twisted by terror and despair at once. She stood over me, her hand trembling, her lips whispering something like:

“Tom… where are you, my love?”.

And then everything went dark.

I woke up in a hospital.

At first nothing but fog. Then the smell of antiseptic, the faint beep of a monitor, unfamiliar voices. I tried to move my head pain shot through my body.

The doctor explained I’d lost a lot of blood but somehow survived: the knife missed my heart by an inch. Katherine… Katherine had run away. I listened, not believing any of it was real.

A couple of days later, Martin came by. I told him everything about the knife, the diary, her thinking I wasn’t me. He listened, frowning, taking notes. When he finished and was about to leave, he turned back:

“Didn’t expect this from Katherine… Don’t worry, we’ll find her. When you’re discharged, come by my place I got some Cuban cigars from a friend, we’ll relax a bit"".

Without thinking, I said:

“I don’t smoke"".

He frowned, about to say something but then just nodded and left, closing the door behind him.
For several minutes I lay there, staring at the ceiling, trying to come to terms with everything that had happened. Then I noticed a small mirror in the corner of the room. I looked at my reflection and froze. My face was pale, my lips dry. But that wasn’t what caught my attention.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).

Well as some of you wanted an update I’m here to proudly say I overcame my fear and told her what I was feeling and she said she feels the exact same way!!!! She said yes and we both kissed and I spoke about how long I wanted to tell her this and she said she was waiting for me to finally tell her!! 

I cannot believe what happened last night. Yes, it was another day of meeting at 4pm and going home 12 hours later. We went for a coffee first, then just sat around talking really, then we went for drinks and we kind of struck gold as the bar we went to last time didn’t have ice so we went to a close by cocktail bar which was fancyyyyyy asf, it definitely set the mood and it felt so much like a date! After a couple drinks each I proposed the idea of going to this nearby park with a view of the city, we went and sat on a bench there talking and talking, 2 people came and sat 2 benches away from us playing some jazz type music, it was the perfect volume and vibe. I thought to myself, “it’s now or never, this is perfect” and so I said to her “seeing as we’ve got some music playing…” and the rest.. well you know how it pretty much goes.

1o2zhzd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Discipline/comments/1o2zhzd/loving_boredom_turned_me_into_a_better_person/,Loving boredom turned me into a better person,"my life was boring because nothing exciting was happening to me. I'd scroll through social media watching other people live these amazing lives while I sat on my couch doing the same thing every day.

Then I realized something that changed my perspective. It was that **my life wasn't boring because nothing was happening it was boring because I was avoiding everything that made me uncomfortable.**

Here's what's actually making your life feel empty:

Watching other people live instead of living yourself. YouTube vlogs, Instagram stories, TikTok trends you're consuming everyone else's experiences instead of creating your own. Your brain knows the difference between watching and doing. Vicarious living gives you none of the satisfaction of actual experiences.

You've optimized all the friction out of your life

Same coffee, same commute, same lunch spot, same weekend routine. You've eliminated all uncertainty and novelty. Your brain stops encoding memories when nothing changes. That's why time feels like it's flying by you're not creating distinct experiences to remember.

You're waiting for permission to do what you want

""I'll travel when I have more money."" ""I'll start that hobby when I have more time."" ""I'll make friends when I'm in a better place."" You're postponing your life until conditions are perfect. They never will be.

You say no to everything that involves effort

Turning down invitations, avoiding plans that require driving somewhere, choosing Netflix over going out. Comfort is the opposite of interesting. Every time you choose easy over uncertain, you're choosing boring over memorable.

You're not learning anything new

Consuming the same type of content, talking to the same people, thinking the same thoughts on repeat. Growth feels like aliveness. Stagnation feels like death. When you stop learning, you stop living. The act of being bad at something new makes you feel alive.

You're addicted to low-effort dopamine

Scrolling, snacking, binging shows activities that require zero effort and give instant gratification. High-dopamine activities make everything else feel dull by comparison. Real life can't compete with algorithmically optimized content.

When you lower your baseline stimulation, regular life becomes interesting again.

You have no goals worth getting excited about

By far the most important lesson is this. Going through motions without working toward anything specific. No projects, no challenges, no ""I can't wait until..."" Anticipation is what makes life feel full. When you have nothing to look forward to, every day feels the same.

You're avoiding discomfort at all costs

Choosing familiar over unknown, safe over risky, comfortable over challenging. Stories are born from discomfort. ""Everything went according to plan"" has never been an interesting story.

My life didn't become perfect when I learned all of this stuff but at least it became something I'm proud of.

I hope this post motivates you to do the same as well.",10,1760099223.0,Discipline,0,1.0,False
