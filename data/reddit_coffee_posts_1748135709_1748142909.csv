1kusu4w,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1kusu4w/old_tuscan_blend_1988_tenuta_di_pomino/,Old Tuscan blend - 1988 Tenuta di Pomino,"Found in corner of cellar. Has been well stored for a long time but did not have a lot of expectations. A Frescobaldi family wine also known as Castello Pomino. Blend of Pinot Noir, Merlot and Cab. Castello Pomino is today known for its whites, notably Chardonnays. 

Anyway cork was a bit soft but came out intact with a Durant. Ruby red color, popped and poured- had quite a bit of sediment so decanted after running half the bottle through a sieve. 


Pleasantly surprised - wine was remarkably good. No distinctive bouquet to speak of, but good mouth feel and mid- palate. Finish was short. Got notes of coffee, leather, maybe toffee- fruit had faded and minerals were present but tertiary at this point. Although there was no mention on the bottle of the grape percentages in the blend, I suspect it was predominantly Pinot. 

Went very well with pasta and a crab cake. Enjoyed it. Keeping some overnight to try tomorrow.

I’m 18 F and 200 pounds (although some people say I look 180 instead of 200 idk if that’s relevant). Anyway, I’ve been going to the gym at least 3x a week for 3 months and have been watching what I’ve been eating. I’ve cut out fast food and sugary coffee as well as caffeine and most sodas. But for people my age I fear 7-10 pounds means I am hindering my progress somehow. I think it might be due to my eating but I REALLY don’t want to calorie count (I do sometimes) because I’m scared I’ll fall into an eating disorder. Any advice?

1kuss0n,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1kuss0n/help_navigating_my_26f_relationship_with_my/,Help navigating my (26F) relationship with my apparent soon-to-be stepmom (26F)?,"My father got divorced 5 years ago, I think it was mostly amicable as we still have family gatherings etc. 

I am not really sure how rich he is, because he tends to stay low-key, but I know as part of his midlife crash out he bought a brand new 911 Turbo S and a place at the St Regis. 

The 911 has been sold and so has the St Regis place (I think?) he now lives in a house that is valued at \~1 million in the mountains  (I only know because I googled after I found out about this other thing) and drives a 2022 (I think?) Toyota Four Runner. 

So I know we/he is not poor, forbes wrote a piece on him that valued him at several hundred million but he sort of brushed that off. 

Anyways. Two years ago, he told us he was dating someone. No one really thought to ask (I guess?) and I assumed that he would tell us all more when he was ready. 

This is all leading up to the fact that he sat us down a few days ago (we all still live in the same city) and explained he was ""very serious"" with a woman. I think both my brother and I were a little shocked, but mostly supportive. He then told us she wrote us a letter, which I found odd but mostly sweet. If you want to read the letter, I have uploaded it via imgbb: 

Letter code: 

Red == my mom 

Black == my dad 

Yellow== me

[https://ibb.co/yFyRyRRT](https://ibb.co/yFyRyRRT)

[https://ibb.co/Txk3MqJV](https://ibb.co/Txk3MqJV)

Anyways. If you read that semi-dramatic letter, you will have discovered (like me) that she is ""similar in age to me."" Me being me, I wanted to knock that stuff out ASAP so I asked her to meet and we got coffee the next day. 

Yes, I pressed her about her age and she is THE SAME AGE AS ME (but allegedly lied to my dad when she met him saying she was three years older???). 

TBH the lying thing is as offensive as the age thing and I do love my dad, so why would he pick someone who lied to him you know? 

That being said I am torn because she was actually really nice and tbh seemed very similar to my dad. My mom and my dad were always really different on religion and the way they saw the world and I think thats one of the ways they fell apart, but this new girl seemed more aligned there and yes I checked lol. 

Also I looked at her linkedin and she is pretty cool and did some cool stuff and has a cool/hard job etc. she also went to one of the best law schools in the country and her median salary on glassdoor for her job is like 300k or sum. 

IDK I guess from my perspective it seems really weird but at he same time maybe it's okay? I guess I am wondering what the hell to do or if the letter seems manipulative to anyone? Because I re-read that and the second time through I was thinking maybe it seemed like it but maybe I am just bugging. 

Apparently she is moving in on Friday, which is fine since we don't live with our dad anymore, but also, I asked about marriage and she was honest and said they are thinking about getting engaged???? 

At the same time, she is funny in the way my dad is and I see a lot of him in her and I can see how they could get along, even though I am sorta creeped out. 

Is it super messed up if I am friends with her? I feel like my world and universe and everything else has been changed overnight by this. I guess I am just looking for general advice and everything else. ",1,1748142617.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

1kusqsq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AusFinance/comments/1kusqsq/lets_talk_about_how_profitablefeasible_are_coffee/,Lets talk about how profitable/feasible are coffee shops in Australia,"Just to be clear, this is a post based on pure curiosity. I am not planning to open a coffee shop nor I do judge people who do so. 

So, essentially what I wonder is the following: running a business is HARD (my family runs a couple of business back in my country and it takes a lot of effort, hours, sacrifice and a bit of luck to run them successfully), specifically running hospitality business seems to be even harder (lots of hours, getting proper ingredients, ensuring you use all of them, etc). 

Coffee shops seem to be the kind of business whose complexities are underestimated (in general I suspect his happens in restaurants, but since a coffee shop seems simpler to run than a restaurant, the changes of people underestimating the day to day challenges is higher). And being more specific, I suspect that making a coffee shop a business that can really provide a good income is pretty hard... 

... and yet I observe two things:

  
1. People seem to think that opening a coffee shop and making it profitable is not that hard (well, at least some people seem to believe that)
2. There are A LOT of coffee shops around (I noticed this now even more after a two week holiday in the US). 

I am curious for anyone who has gone in the coffee shop business to comment on their experiences, I would like to hear from people that manage to successfully run such business as well from peopl that failed to do so, what where the key factors of success/fail? what did people learn? how come some people still think it is an ""easy"" business to run?

Have a great day folks and thanks for any answers!

1kusllp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1kusllp/my_dad_is_obsessed_with_trump_and_i_cant_get_him/,My dad is obsessed with Trump and I can’t get him to stop engaging in it,"TLDR at bottom.

My (nb 20s) dad (m 60’s) is obsessed with Trump and I am beginning to wonder if it’s healthy. We are Australian, we have no familial or social ties to any Americans, there’s no practical impact on day to day life that requires my dad to be so wired to US politics to the point that he is now. (I’m not saying there isn’t any benefit in staunch awareness, and I’m also not saying the US doesn’t impact our affairs here down under. I’m saying the extent to which my dad engages in it is not necessary for our personal livelihood on a daily basis)

He is a retired pensioner also so there isn’t work related reason for him staying this looped-in either. 

During Trump’s first term dad had a pretty casual interest/hatred for the administration, he always was concerned about the state of affairs in the US once Trump took office but not any more than when any other president was in charge I would say, at least in my recent memory. But I think the boredom of the pandemic and general increase in social media journalism pumping shit out 24/7 has inadvertently created the perfect storm for harbouring my dad’s obsession.

I would be less concerned about my dad’s partaking in the hours of hate watching trump news if it wasn’t bleeding into everything else. Almost once a day he brings it up to me and rants incessantly. I’m not a fan of US republicanism either, I generally consider myself quite switched on regarding politics, but the extent that he raves on and on to me is too much for even me. And it’s never anything productive or new, the daily rant goes something like:

“He is such a fucking dickhead. What a wanker. I can’t believe how brainwashed they are. Just jail the fucker. Lock the asshole up” and so on and so forth. Like bro I just walked past to grab a coffee 😭 I didn’t even mention him. He is so heated by the whole situation that even just mentioning “America” or “US” is like a sleeper agent phrase to get my dad to start raving.

Our day to day shopping habits are sometimes hampered by dad refusing to give his money to any US corporations here (example: him scowling and grumbling about me going to Costco to grab some stuff in bulk). 

When I wake up in the morning and walk past my dad’s office, there is ALWAYS a YouTube video of someone analysing the latest Trump fuck-up or whatever. And then during the day walking past him hanging out in front of the telly, He has his phone or tablet in front of him watching another YouTuber reporting on another Trump fuck up.

Dad will sometimes boast to me, unprompted, about all the republicans he’s gotten into fights with in comment sections on Facebook. He will similarly unprompted, go red in the face at the dinner table raging about Trump politics if he so much as hears the man’s name, or the country’s name on the news in passing.

I don’t mind my dad being engaged in world politics, he always has been and I attribute my own interest in politics to that sort of upbringing. But he has gone off the deep end and everyone is tired of it. I have tried to explain to him that exposing himself to the things that cause him anger isn’t good for his mind body and soul etc. I’ve told him that starting fights on Facebook under trump content is just going to keep bolstering Trump content to appear in his algorithm (As an aside, I 100% believe that his initial distaste for the administration has been exponentially made worse by the cyclical nature of Facebook’s algorithms. I wonder if things would be different if he just never engaged with the posts to begin with, but I digress). It doesn’t get through to him. It’s almost like he’s joined a cult or something, he doesn’t accept that his behaviour is negatively impacting his mood or the house’s mood, the rage against Trump is like a righteous cause for him and the discomfort of everyone around him is just a part of that.

If you’ve managed to break your boomer parent or whoever out of a similar scenario, be it someone who’s borderline conspiratorial or even someone who’s joined an MLM, I would love to hear your advice. I’m not saying our experiences are interchangeable but I wonder if there are overlapping techniques that can help break the echo chamber for him and get him to pump the breaks on his “crusade”. Cheers

TLDR: Boomer dad is obsessed with hating trump and it puts him in a sour mood, affecting everyone.",1,1748142018.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

Her hands played in his hair; her lips found the crook of his neck. Isaiah’s hands found her ass; Gabby ground her pussy on his knee.*  
*The lone moan that escaped her lips had been enough to warm him on many cold nights.*  
*It had been enough to break the spell.*

I'm a 30M, and about five months ago, I broke up with my first and only girlfriend. We'd been together for years, and the breakup hit me hard, especially when she quickly started dating someone new. I felt pretty low, but my friends encouraged me to try dating again, so I joined a dating app.

I ended up matching with a girl (27F), and we’ve been talking for two weeks now. She’s so sweet and smart, but I made a mistake early on. During one of our conversations, I referred to my ex as “the love of my life.” I didn’t mean it in a way that implied I wasn’t over her. I just meant she was my only relationship. But understandably, this made the girl I’m talking to feel uneasy. She told me she didn’t want to compete with a memory, and asked if I was really ready to date. I reassured her that I was, but I don’t think my explanation convinced her.

Despite that, we kept chatting. Little after that, she asked me out for coffee, joking that she had to do it since I hadn’t. Truth is, I wanted to, but hesitated because I didn’t want to come off too eager, especially knowing she had a tight schedule. I hinted at hanging out a few times with things like “we should do this,” but didn’t take the lead. 

She suggested we meet six days later (today, Saturday). I said that I couldn’t make it that day, and she sent me her schedule, asking me to pick another day. I replied, “Let’s see during the week,” since my schedule can be unpredictable. I didn’t follow up, honestly.

Today I was flirting with her a bit, telling her how cool it would be to sleep next to someone.

Me: “I’m the best (to sleep with).”
Her: “Oh, really?”
Me: “But I come with an expiration date, hahaha.”
Her: “Offers on this side expire, too.”

I knew what she meant. I told her, “let me know when you want to go out” and she reacted to the message with “👍.” So then I said, “when can you meet?” And she went, “I’ll let you know.” 

I don’t know, am I wrong for talking it this slow? I feel like she’s lost interest and thinks I’m am AH.

I’ve been making espresso at home for the past 5 years on a Breville Barista Express, and it’s been an amazing machine to learn on. I mostly make milk drinks and can pull a pretty solid shot—overall, I’m happy with it!

But lately, I’ve been diving deeper into the coffee rabbit hole. And while my setup is definitely good enough, I can’t stop wondering: could it be even better?

That tantalizing possibility has me thinking…
Would upgrading to a separate grinder and espresso machine really take my coffee to the next level? I know it opens up more control and potential for quality—but also more work, more steps, and a steeper learning curve.

On the flip side, something like the Breville Oracle line is super appealing too. It promises a better cup and automates a lot of the process. That’s a big plus when I’m making multiple drinks for friends or just want great coffee without the hassle.

So I’d love to hear from those of you who’ve been down this road:
	•	Is the leap to a dedicated grinder + machine setup really worth it, flavor-wise?
	•	What (if anything) do you lose in automation with something like the Oracle?
	•	Any tips for deciding between simplicity and full control?

Any advice, experience, or insight would be hugely appreciated—thanks in advance!",1,1748141285.0,espresso,1,0.67,False

I’m Maddi, and I’m just really grateful to be part of this space. I believe in the quiet magic of snail mail — how a card from a stranger can bring a little light into a heavy week. 💌

I’ll genuinely appreciate any card you feel called to send. That said, if you’re someone who likes knowing what makes someone’s heart smile, here’s a peek into mine:

🪴🌙✨

* I love tea (black tea, chai, peppermint, anything cozy with milk and sugar)

* Big fan of nature, bones & skulls, frogs, butterflies, and weird little trinkets

* I love poetry, books, and the color purple! 

* I’m sapphic-bisexual 💜💙🩷🧡 and this is my first year being out for pride! 🌈

* I could be described as dark academia meets alternative/grunge and New Age witchcraft

* My birthday is in August (summer birthday, yeah!)

* I collect random bits — pressed flowers, fortunes from cookies, bottle caps, that kind of thing, most of which are for my junk journal

* Pandas are my favorite animal, and I also love goats, dogs, cats, horses, and penguins

* I’m into bookstores, coffee shops, and thrift/antique stores

* Anything that feels a little witchy or vintage makes me happy

* I’m currently married and have a wonderful daughter

* My favorite kind of weather is the kind where you want to wrap up in a blanket with a cup of something warm

* I love plants, anything to do with space/stars/the moon, and just outdoors in general! 

🪴🌙✨

I keep every card for forever. If you write a long message, I’ll definitely read every word (twice). I love hearing about what makes people *them* — so feel free to ramble.

I also always try to send thank-you cards in return, so if you’d like one then make sure to send me your address! 

Thank you for even considering sending something! 💫 You’re amazing!

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the US (EST time zone, and with a rather sporadic schedule). My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, life is far more intricate than this. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are emphatically established and developed over time for a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**Also, no hesitations or doubts, please.** If you're at all interested then take the chance. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** My ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. I seek people who generally know themselves and what they desire and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost. The type of connection I want also understands, accepts, and embraces the reality that there's more than deliberate engagement and a handful of interests that make someone up, from mundane chatter to intense distress. The type of connection I want strives to embrace these more grueling aspects of existence in a considerate way.
* **Being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** I want people with a vibrant imagination that are high in cognitive sensations in which such interaction, of various sorts, creates an elated state of splendor. I peak with ideation and abstraction, and seek out others who do as well.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics, which is inscribed onto one of the plaques I've placed above my abode in the Epistemic Wilderness. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and have actively sought out the most peculiar and obscure bits of knowledge possible since I was young. I seek peers in this and related endeavors.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, in which I primarily write about my observations and thoughts. I also adore writing conversationally, and am not uncommonly poetic and intense when doing so. Photography is also something I dabble in, although not as much as I'd like. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, and coffee.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with. A person who understands that no one will ever be your clone and dares to take exuberant advantage of that fact seems required for the deepest sorts of bonds.**  I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably detailed chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention; anything dazzling will also do. I look forward to us chatting and connecting around meaningful and fervid passions.",1,1748140716.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

I was working overnights at a wildlife rehabilitation center on the edge of a national forest. I’m not going to say which one—some of you will try to find it, and trust me, **you don’t want to go looking**.

We mostly got raccoons, opossums, injured birds. Nothing dramatic. That night, the lights in the hallway flickered around 2:35 AM. I remember the exact time because I had just made a fresh cup of coffee, and the flickering made me spill some on my wrist. Slightly scalding the sensitive flesh. I was swearing and wiping it off when I heard the front buzzer go off.

Which was weird. Because we don’t get walk-ins; not this late at night anyways. We don’t even have a public-facing entrance. The park itself is tucked away so that the animals aren’t disturbed by the loud passing traffic.

I checked the monitor. Static. Just static.

I buzzed open the gate anyway. I don’t know why. Maybe I wanted it to be something different. I’d been bored for weeks, and loneliness warps the part of your brain that’s supposed to scream **“don’t do it, dumbass.”**

The man who came in wasn’t... right. He was awkwardly tall…  too tall for the doorway, even had to duck to get in. His coat looked like it was soaked in river mud, and he smelled like ozone and iron. Like a thunderstorm that got lost and found its way inside a dead thing. It was truly something awful.

“I have a delivery,” he said.

I blinked. “This is a wildlife rehab facility.”

“It was wounded,” he said. “You fix the wounded.”

He handed me a crate. I don’t remember saying yes, but I took it. His fingers were too long, and they lingered on the box when I pulled it away. Like he didn’t want to let go.

When I looked down, I swear the crate *shifted*. Something inside it *moved*. I heard a scraping noise, that sounded like claws dragging against wood.

He left without a word. I didn’t hear the door open, but he was gone anyway.

I should’ve left it alone. I should’ve called animal control or burned it or thrown it in the river. But I opened it.

Inside was a creature I can’t fully describe. It looked half-formed, like it had been stitched together from things that didn’t belong together. A deer’s face, but with long, mashing teeth. Human like hands where one would expect his paws to be. Empty, black eyes that **blinked sideways**.

It was whimpering. It sounded like a child.

I didn’t have a choice.

I fed it.

I kept it in the back room. It grew fast. Too fast. And it learned my face. It began to *smile* when it saw me.

But that wasn’t the worst part.

The worst part was the dreams. Dreams of places that weren’t places—of **trees that bled**, of **moons that whispered**, of **my own voice speaking languages I’ve never known**.

Last week, it spoke my name. Out loud. Clear as anything. It’s voice was something ethereal and haunting. A sound that most people would cringe or cower just out of instinct.

Then it said, “Now you’ll carry me.”

And I am.

It lives in me now. In my head, my bones, my breath. I don’t sleep. I don’t eat. It feeds on regret and **it’s always full.**

I didn’t have a choice. That’s what I tell myself every night before I shut off the lights and feel it stretch inside me.

But you do. If you ever see a man at your door with a box...

Had I been so consumed by work that I had missed out on the brief yet radiant moments that were happening around me? A fleeting sense of self-reflection passed through me. Looking back, there were certainly memories that made me smile.

The moments when we shared food brought from Korea, comforting our longing for home, and the times spent soothing each other's hearts. The taste of grilled meat and kimchi fried rice, savored at the Korean restaurant in camp after reaching a project milestone, still lingers vividly in my memory.

The dark Turkish coffee I drank during meetings at the vendor’s office—sweetened by a generous amount of sugar in a paper cup the size of a soju glass—was a small, unexpected comfort. Another time, a chai tea latte, thick with condensed milk, offered some solace to my weary soul.

I also recall the days we went out for meals with colleagues. The moments when we set aside the weight of work, talking freely, made me deeply appreciate that we were all comrades, moving forward with a shared goal.

There were weekends when I took short trips to Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, and neighboring countries like Bahrain and Qatar. Walking through unfamiliar cities and gazing at new landscapes, I felt my tense heart loosen, even if just for a moment.

And then there were the unexpected, small moments of emotional impact. I vividly remember a Thursday night at the Starbucks in Hofuf, a city near the site, when a young Saudi girl approached me with a shy smile and said, ""I've never met a Korean before."" Her innocent, bright smile brought me a joy I hadn’t anticipated, and it became an unforgettable memory.

Looking back now, all of these fragments of memories were the warm lights hiding between the hardships. At the time, I hadn’t fully realized it, but now I see that it was these precious moments that allowed me to endure without crumbling.

Even in the midst of struggle, these quietly shining fragments of happiness helped lift me back up. Through all the hard times, those warm glimmers remained steadfast within me.

That was all we had left. The mantra seared into our minds after the transit—those of us who survived it, anyway. It looped endlessly, a grim lullaby echoing in the hollows of our skulls for days, maybe weeks. Hard to tell. Time doesn't behave here.

I jolted awake, cold air biting at my skin. My fingers instinctively closed around the rifle beside me. Panic had become as common as hunger. Some mornings it felt like a heart attack just to wake up. Today, a few deep breaths were enough to keep it from spiraling.

As usual, my body felt like it weighed a ton. Every movement was a chore. The grass beneath me was damp, clinging to me with the chill of dew-soaked socks.
""Always bring two pairs of socks, kid."" Dad's old hunting wisdom. I missed those days—him, the porch, his stein of Heineken. Maybe he’d be reading Angeline a bedtime story right now. God, I missed those days.

""I’ve got a new theory,"" came a voice to my right—dry, brittle, like a man who hadn’t slept in years. Thomas, of course. He sat cross-legged, notebook in hand, pen pinched between two fingers like some mad scholar.

He’d been on watch. I was supposed to take over, though it wasn’t like I could sleep after waking like that.
""I’ll take the next shift, Tom,"" I muttered, hoping to avoid another descent into his conspiracy rabbit holes.

Naturally, I was wrong.
""What if we’re in a simulation?"" he said, thrusting the notebook toward me. Scribbled notes and half-sketched graphs cluttered the page—chaos disguised as science.

""Think about it. This could be a test. Government-run, maybe. See how well humans adapt to extreme environments—""
""What does it matter?"" I cut him off, pushing the notebook away with a finger. ""I told you, quit with that shit. We’re here. That’s all that matters.""

I saw the hurt in his eyes. Back in the old world, he’d been someone important. A scientist, maybe. Here, titles didn’t mean a damn thing. You were either alive, or dead.

""Try focusing on breaching Sector 8 instead of scribbling in your damn notebook.""
He let out a low whistle—the one he knew I hated.

""It’s not just about surviving, Cas,"" he said quietly. ""We have to go back. This place... it’s not real. It can’t be.""

I gave him a small nod. Not because I agreed, but because I understood. This was how he kept himself sane. Who was I to take that from him?

A sharp jab to my backside jolted me forward.
""Do you two ever shut up?"" Carmen growled, her voice thick with sleep. “A girl needs her beauty rest.”

I stood and gave her a light kick in return—just enough to earn a punch later. Worth it. I slung the rifle over my shoulder.
""I’m doing a sweep. Tom’s got a fresh theory for you,"" I said, grinning as I passed. He didn’t look up.

Despite everything, Tom was good company. In a place like this, that was as essential as food or water. He couldn’t fight worth a damn, though. Carmen and I had dragged his ass out of enough firefights to earn a medal.

The ground crunched under my boots—frost layering everything like powdered glass. The rhythm of it reminded me of Angeline’s violin.
God, what I’d give to hear her play again. I used to yell at her to keep it down. Now? I’d trade Carmen for a single note. Hell, maybe even for a Twix bar.

The thought made me chuckle. Then laugh. Then the laughter turned to sobs. I collapsed, hands and knees in the dirt, tears freezing as they hit the cold ground.

I missed everything. Dad’s cryptic sayings. Angeline’s music. Mom’s burnt coffee and humming on the porch. Bont’s barking in the yard. I missed home.
I would’ve given anything to go back. Anything.

A sound snapped me out of it—boots on frost, coming fast.

I almost called out for Carmen, thinking she’d come to join me. But something was wrong. Too many steps. Too heavy. I dropped to my stomach just in time as boots landed meters from my head.

Five figures, moving in silence. Civilian clothes, like ours—but wrong. Too clean. Too uniform. Each had a crude bronze star pinned to their shoulders, jagged and dull like they’d been carved from a beer can.

Had they tracked us through the maze? Or just ended up here too? Didn’t matter. If we didn’t avoid them, blood would be spilled.

They were close—six, maybe seven meters out. Just five of them. I could probably take the shot. Suppressed barrel, old Russian model. Carmen said it was Spetsnaz-issue. I didn’t care. It worked, and it was quiet. Ammo was rare, but I made do.

I was just about to raise my rifle when four more stepped out from the tree line. They spoke a language none of us knew—not even Tom, and he knew a bit of everything.

Then came eight more, from behind. One nearly stepped on my head.

If not for the darkness, they would’ve seen me. My heart pounded loud enough to be a beacon.

We weren’t alone. Not by a long shot.
I held my breath.

Every muscle in my body screamed to move—to run, to fight, to do something—but I stayed frozen. Still. Just another lump of dirt in the dark. The boot that nearly crushed my skull moved on, its owner none the wiser.

Fourteen. I counted fourteen of them now. Light footsteps, practiced and quiet. These weren’t just random survivors.

Their language rose and fell in sharp tones, clipped and efficient. Orders, maybe. Or names. It didn't matter. The bronze stars on their shoulders gleamed faintly in the moonlight, catching just enough glow to turn them into ghostly sigils. That damn insignia again.

They weren’t like us. Something about the way they moved. Precise. Calculated. As if they'd trained for this.

Sector patrols? Enforcers?

I didn’t want to find out.

My hands shifted, slow as sap in winter, curling around the rifle. I eased the barrel forward, stopping when a twig snapped behind me.

Shit.

Silence.

The conversation stopped. Then came footsteps—deliberate, closing in. I pressed my cheek to the cold ground and forced myself not to breathe.

A beam of light swept the trees to my left. Flashlight. Close.

Another snapped branch. This one directly behind me.

They knew. Or suspected. Either way, I was out of time.

I rolled silently into a prone firing position, angled the barrel just enough to cover the most direct approach. The suppressor would give me a few seconds, maybe, before the others figured out where I was.

I waited. Ten seconds. Twenty. Nothing.

Then a face appeared through the brush—pale, young, unshaven. He didn't see me yet. My finger touched the trigger.

Then—

""Cas!""

A whisper. Sharp. Urgent.

I flinched.

It was Carmen’s voice. Somewhere close. Too close.

The young soldier's head whipped toward the sound, eyes narrowing. His hand drifted toward his weapon.

I fired.

The crack was soft, but not silent. The bullet took him clean through the temple. He dropped like a stone.

The world paused.

Then the forest exploded.

Shouts in that guttural language. Boots pounding toward me. Lights cutting through the dark like knives. More of them than I could count now. At least twenty. Maybe thirty. A full unit.

I scrambled up and ran, bullets zipping past me, tearing through the underbrush. Bark and leaves exploded around me. I didn’t shoot back—I didn’t have time to aim. I just ran.

A shadow broke from the trees ahead—Carmen. She waved me down and yanked me behind a tree just as more rounds peppered the ground where I’d been a second before.

“You idiot,” she hissed. “You led ‘em straight to us!”

“I didn’t lead—they found me!”

Tom came sprinting through the trees behind her, clutching that damn notebook like it was a child. ""They’re everywhere!"" he yelled. “Whole damn perimeter is compromised!”

“No shit, Sherlock!” Carmen snapped. She raised her rifle, fired two clean shots into the darkness. Someone screamed. One less star on the shoulder.

“We fall back to the stream!” I barked. “Now!”

No one argued.

We ran—lungs burning, hearts pounding loud enough to drown out thought. Trees blurred past in streaks of black and gray, their skeletal limbs clawing at our clothes and skin. Every step was a gamble: a hidden root, a jagged stone, the uneven ground soaked in dew and blood from god-knows-what. The forest became a blur of motion, an obstacle course designed by some cruel higher power.

Gunfire cracked behind us, sharp and rapid, followed by the whip of bullets tearing through branches overhead. Bark exploded in splinters around us. One passed so close to my ear I felt the heat of its wake, like the hiss of a passing ghost.

Carmen, behind us, moved like a predator in retreat—graceful, fast, but deadly. She paused only to spin and fire short, controlled bursts into the shadows, each shot echoing a grim promise. Every time a pursuer got too bold, too close, she corrected their mistake with precision. One man dropped with a scream that choked halfway through. Another fell without a sound, his body thudding against the leaves like dropped meat.

Tom, for all his genius, wasn’t made for this. He stumbled over a low root and went sprawling face-first into the dirt, a breathless curse tumbling from his lips. I reached back, grabbed the strap of his coat, and yanked him to his feet without stopping. The notebook was still clutched in his hands, somehow untouched—his lifeline, his scripture. He held onto it tighter than he held onto his rifle, and that said a lot.

He tripped again—this time on loose gravel—and nearly took me down with him. But he didn’t let go of the damn notebook.

“Priorities, Tom!” Carmen shouted, ducking a low-hanging branch as she laid down another burst of fire.

“I’m fine!” he gasped, already scrambling upright, eyes wild, glasses askew. “It’s all in here—I need it!”

“Then maybe next time carry it in your damn bag!” she yelled, but didn’t slow down.

The woods thinned slightly, opening just enough to give the illusion of space. Moonlight painted streaks of silver across the floor, only making it easier for the men behind us to see. I could hear them gaining—boots pounding in synchrony, shouting to each other in clipped syllables that sounded like static and steel.

Then came the scream of a flare, bright red and hissing as it arced over the trees behind us, bathing everything in bloodlight. Our shadows stretched and danced beneath us like demons on puppet strings. Now we weren’t just fleeing—we were hunted.

Carmen turned on the run, knelt mid-stride, and fired three sharp shots into the darkness. One hit flesh. The resulting howl sent a chill down my spine.

“Move!” she barked, rising again. “They’re trying to box us in!”

I pushed harder, lungs drawing ragged air as pain bloomed in my ribs. My thighs burned. My arms ached. But I didn’t stop.

None of us did.
Because stopping meant dying.
And we weren’t ready for that.
Not yet.

Ahead, I saw the shimmer of water.

The stream.

We dove into it without hesitation, the freezing current dragging at our legs, soaking us to the bone. We pushed across, lungs burning, and ducked behind a rocky outcrop on the far side. It wasn’t perfect cover, but it would do.
For now.

Panting. Wet. Alive.
We sat in the dark, listening to the chaos fade behind us—distant shouts, the occasional gunshot, then silence.

Carmen spat into the dirt. “They weren’t just scouts,” she said. “That was a sweep. Full operation.”

“They’ve been tracking us,” I said. “Probably since we left the maze.”

Tom hugged his notebook to his chest. “That confirms it. This is all controlled. They’re watching. They want to see how we react.”

Carmen stared at him like she was considering throwing him back into the stream.

“You still think this is some kind of experiment?” she growled. “People are dying, Tom.”

“And that’s exactly what they want,” he whispered. “Reaction under stress. Breakdown of human psychology under continuous threat. We’re rats in a cage.”

“Rats don’t shoot back,” I muttered.

We sat in silence after that. The wind picked up, cold and sharp, carrying the scent of smoke and gunpowder.

I looked down at my hands. They were shaking.

Fight. Survive. Endure.

That mantra echoed again, dull and rhythmic.

Everything was fine at first I was newly 18, I flew to a middle eastern country to meet him (since he’s middle eastern) my first visit there, he got upset over a message in my phone to my best friend (a female) about lingerie, and pulled me by my hair from one side of the Airbnb I was in to the other, at which point when he left immediately after this, I broke down on the floor bawling my eyes out for hours, he came back apologized brought me my favorite coffee and donuts. I also want to mention weight in this because I was 280 pounds at this time and he was 160 so easily I could have fought back, but it’s never been in my nature to fight back or even have to handle this kind of situation. I’ve been cheated on multiple times by him weather it be online talking to women, or it be in person meeting her, which I don’t think he ever sexually did anything with them, but I’m not sure my gut tells me otherwise since the beginning. I’ve confronted the betrayals multiple times and even mentioned how I don’t trust him, and I don’t think I’ll ever be ready to trust him. Following up with this, there has been multiple cases of our fights becoming physical, I don’t want to call it abuse because never has he punched me, but has left several big bruises, never any blood. Even after I had a major surgery, and he seen me fighting for my life just a few weeks later the physical fights started again. I’ve gone to the hospital once over our fight, just a bone contusion nothing more, but it hurt really bad!! This is all taken place in his country. He doesn’t work and hasn’t for 2 years, he did work when I first met him but a few months later quit that job. I’ve been responsible for the bills, and the upkeep of the house, along with his parents. I’ve been responsible for gas in cars, food, clothes for us. You name it I’ve been paying for it for 2 years, the back in fourth between the U.S my country and his country as well. I’m now 21, 140 pounds I am pregnant, halfway there, well when I first found out, and shared it with him, he was shocked…but he took it well. Fast forward a month or two we got into a physical fight and I decided to leave because I wasn’t going to be put in a situation that could harm my child. We moved to an apartment just a week before I left back to the U.S, I pay the rent atleast 75% of it each month even now. However I don’t pay for the usual stuff I do when I’m there thankfully. However I came back here for the safety of my baby, and to give birth here. We agreed he was going to get a job, and save money for our child same as me. However, I’ve had a difficult pregnancy and haven’t been able to work I still have an income from attending college, so I am able to provide for myself. I’ve managed to buy everything I need for my baby, and even start a savings account for them, it may not be much but my child comes first. He has not bought the first thing for the child, or even gotten a job. I’m due in a few months. I’m supposed to fly back over once the babies here, and he wants our child to have his last name which is his right. However I am very hesitant on what to do, in my mind I am scared to take my child back, with the laws being different and have my child taken away. I am also hesitant to give the baby his last name because of the issues him and I have, and I don’t want my baby wrapped up in that if anything were to happen. I’m not sure what to do at this point. He said he would sue me if I took his child, or didn’t give the child his last name, which I’m only 21 and doing the best I can financially, barely getting by and providing for my baby. I don’t know how much grounds he has across the sees to sue me over the child. Or even where to begin on what I should do and how to handle this situation. I’m just scared, I know in my heart I would be better off a single mom, but I’m scared of him suing me, and his country being how it is, him winning custody and I’ll never see my child again. If anyone has been in a similar situation, please let me know how you handled it :/

1kurwrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kurwrp/aitah_sweet_revenge_on_my_cheating_girlfriends/,AITAH - Sweet revenge on my cheating girlfriend's boyfriend's Harley Davidson...,"So here’s how I turned betrayal into a glitter-fueled masterpiece.

I was with my girlfriend for three years. I genuinely thought we were solid. Then one day, completely out of the blue, a mutual friend dropped the bomb: she’d been cheating on me. For a while. With a guy who called himself “Wolf.” Yeah. That was his actual nickname. He rode a Harley, wore sunglasses indoors, and seemed to believe he was some kind of lone-wolf biker poet. You can’t make this stuff up.

At first, I didn’t even react. I just let it sit. Quiet rage, slow-brewing. They went public soon after, all couple selfies, captioned quotes about “freedom” and “finding your true ride.” It was laughable. But then I noticed she was still using me for little things, favors, stuff she’d left at my place, the occasional “can you help me move this?” message. And one day she casually mentioned that Wolf had left his Harley parked at her place, the place we used to share, while they went away for the weekend.

I didn’t say much. I just nodded. But that night,  I went to where he parked the bike. Under a tree. No cameras. Barely any streetlights. Perfect.

Armed with a rainbow spectrum of spray paint, industrial super glue, and a creative vengeance that had been simmering for weeks, I made my move. I gave that Harley the unicorn transformation it never knew it needed. I layered it in brilliant rainbow gradients, blending pink, gold, teal, and violet into a surreal wash of sparkle. I glued rainbow streamers to the seat and handlebars, cascading like a proud mane in the moonlight. Then, and this was the pièce de résistance, I superglued a massive pink dildo to the front headlight. His own unicorn horn, majestic and unignorable.

I wasn’t done. I attached tiny bells to every spoke so that even if he tried to ride it, it would jingle like a cursed ice cream truck. Then I painted over the license plate in big, bold white: I WAS MADE FOR LOVING YOU HARD.

When they got back the next morning and saw the bike, it was like watching a dream die in slow motion. He stood there, completely still. She just kept saying “Oh my God” over and over like a broken Roomba. I was parked just up the road, sipping coffee, enjoying the sunrise and the sweet, sweet sound of justice.

From what I hear, Wolf hasn’t touched the bike since. Apparently, every time he looks at it, he sees the horn.

And that, friends, is how you turn heartbreak into art.

1kurwnx,https://www.reddit.com/r/workout/comments/1kurwnx/the_only_musclebuilding_guide_youll_ever_need_no/,The Only Muscle-Building Guide You’ll Ever Need (No BS),"# DIET: How Many Calories Do You Need?

**Find your maintenance calories:**

**Bodyweight (lbs) × 14 - 18**

* ×14 → Sedentary  
* ×15-16 → Light activity / 3-4 training days per week  
* ×17-18 → High activity / 5-7 training days per week  

**If you’re bulking:** add 300-500 calories**If you’re cutting:** subtract 300-500 calories

⚠️ *These are estimates — track your weight and adjust every 1-2 weeks based on progress.*



# PROTEIN, FATS & CARBS (Simplified)

* **Protein:** 0.7-1g per lb (1.6-2.2g per kg) of bodyweight daily  
* **Fats:** 0.3-0.4g per lb  
* **Carbs:** Fill the rest of your calories with carbs  

Prioritize whole foods, but it's okay to be flexible.

# WATER INTAKE

**30-45 ml × kg of bodyweight per day**

 Increase on hot days or intense training sessions. A good rule: your pee should be light yellow.

# SLEEP (The Most Underrated Factor)

**7-9 hours of quality sleep per night**

**Tips for better sleep:**

* No screens 30-60 min before bed  
* Dark, cool room  
* Same sleep schedule every day

# TRAINING: How to Structure It

**Train 3-4 times per week.** More isn’t better — better is better. Pick a split you can stick to for months.



# Best Training Split for Beginners:

**Upper / Lower Split — 4 Days a Week**

**Upper 1:** Chest & Back **Lower 1:** Quads focus, 1 hamstring exercise

**Upper 2:** Arms, Shoulders & Forearms **Lower 2:** Hamstrings focus, 1 quad exercise

**Why an entire day for arms?** Arms recover fast and thrive on high volume + high intensity + short rest.

# TRAINING DETAILS (Volume, Rest, Frequency)

# ARMS:

* **Biceps:** 16 sets  
* **Triceps:** 16 sets  
* **Rest:** 30 sec between sets  
* **Reps:** 10-20  
* **Intensity:** All sets to failure  
* **Frequency:** 1-2× per week  
* Use dropsets, supersets, bi- and tri-sets.  

# FOREARMS:

* **10 sets wrist curls + 10 sets wrist extensions**  
* **Reps:** 15-20  
* **Frequency:** 4× per week or daily  

# SHOULDERS:

* **4 sets per head (front, lateral, rear)**  
* **Rest:** 45-70 sec  
* **Reps:** 10-15  
* Use dropsets: a dropset counts as 1 set, even if you lower the weight 5 times.  

**Frequency:** 2-4× per week Tip: Sneak shoulder exercises into chest, back, or leg sessions between sets.

# LEGS:

* **Quads:** 3 exercises, 2 sets each to failure  
* **Hamstrings:** Same  
* **Calves:** 10-30 sets to failure, 30 sec rest  
* **Anterior Tibialis:** Light weight, 15-20 reps, 5 sets, 1 min rest  

**Pro tip:** Use both bent-leg and straight-leg calf movements for full development.

# CHEST:

Notice where you feel sore after benching. If you only feel it in the upper/middle chest → you’re missing out on total development. Train incline, flat, and dips for complete growth.

# BACK:

* **Upper Back:** Elbows out and away  
* **Lats:** Elbows in, close to the torso  
* **Overall Back Thickness:** Deadlifts, hip hyperextensions  

**Always retract and depress your scapula on pulls and presses.**

# COMMON BEGINNER MISTAKES:

* Not training with enough intensity  
* Chasing novelty over consistency  
* Poor form (form > weight, always)  
* Not progressively overloading (increase weight, reps, or density over time)  
* No sustainable plan  
* Ignoring recovery (sleep, food, water)  

# KEEP IN MIND:

* **It takes time.** Nothing happens overnight.  
* **Track your progress.** Log your lifts and weight weekly.  
* **Be consistent.** Don’t skip weeks and expect results.  
* **The plan should fit YOU.** Not the other way around.

**TRACK YOUR PROGRESS:**

* Track weight, reps, and rest times  
* Optional: track body weight weekly (average across 3-7 days)  
* Optional: take pictures every 4-6 weeks  

If you’re progressing in the gym (adding weight, reps, or reducing rest while maintaining form) — you’re on the right track.

# SUPPLEMENTS (NEED-TO-KNOW)

**You don’t need supplements.** If your diet is on point, you’re good.

Optional:

* **Whey protein** (if hitting daily protein is hard)  
* **Creatine monohydrate** (5g daily, safe and effective)  
* **Preworkout** (or simply a strong coffee)  

That’s it. No magic pills.

# MYTHBUSTING

**Can I lose fat and build muscle at the same time?** Yes

**How long until I see results?** Noticeable changes: 8-12 weeks Big changes: 1-2 years A great physique: 3-5 years

**Is cardio bad for muscle?**No. It improves recovery and heart health. Just don’t overdo it.

**Should I bulk or cut first?** If you’re skinny-fat → lean bulk. If you’re overweight → cut. If you’re lean → bulk.

# 📌 FINAL WORD:

Everything here — calorie formulas, water intake, volume — is a starting point. **Experiment, track, and adjust.**

If you’re getting stronger over time and your physique is improving, you’re doing it right.

**This is the most complete, no-bullshit beginner guide you’ll find online. Save it, live it, and you’ll build a great physique.**

So six years ago, I worked with this guy back in my home country — not a close friend, just a colleague. I was actually his manager for like six months. Then life moved on, we never stayed in touch, and we haven’t spoken at all for the past eight years.

Fast forward to a few months ago: dude lands in the U.S., finds my number, and texts me out of nowhere. Says he’s visiting and wants to grab coffee and “catch up.” I think, sure, why not? I’m a nice person. Let’s be friendly.

We meet up. He tells me he wants to stay in the U.S., find a job, make it work here, etc. All good, I nod politely. He was living a decent life back home which he was the one telling me that.

Now here’s where it gets insane.

TWO DAYS LATER. 8 A.M. I get a text:
“Hello, I need you. It’s urgent.”
Me, half-asleep, panics. I think he’s in trouble, maybe at a hospital or something, because he doesn’t know anyone here. So I call him immediately.

And this man — this man — says:
“Yeah, remember when I said I want to stay in the U.S.? I need money to rent a place and hire an immigration lawyer. Can you give me some?”

Sir. WHAT.

We haven’t spoken in eight years. We worked together for six months. I was your boss, not your best friend. And you wake me up to emotionally hustle me out of cash?

I told him I’d think about it, then later messaged him a polite “Sorry, I don’t have the money, good luck.” But honestly I wanted to scream: WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT?!

I just started my summer job at a neighborhood coffee Cafe. It's pretty chill it's just your basic Barista, make drinks, clean sweep etc. Again just a summer gig while classes end to make some chump change. 

Today at work my coworker (Female) was changing the recycling, pulling it out to tie then replacing it with a other bag. 

The last job I had before this I was the only male and alot of times when the girls there would change the trash they would say it's heavy and need help. So I would of course do it for them to make it easier for them. I'm a bigger guy that goes to the gym so lifting/carrying heavy things are nothing to me. 

So by reflex I grabbed the bag from her to do it myself and as soon as I did it, she immediately said in a sarcastic and annoyed tone ""Oh that's cute, you don't think I can lift it up  and do it myself. It's fine I can do it"". I didn't take it personally I just said ""ok that's fine"" also again I just started, I don't want a problem with anyone.

Fast forward to later in the shift, she comes up to me and tells me she wants to talk to me before I clock out. I agree no issue and we go to the back. We start talking and she goes in on me

""Why did you try to help me with the garbage beforehand? Did you think I can't do it? Do you think it's right to treat women that way? To grab the bag away from them like they're not able to do it?"" I explained to her very calmly absolutely not I respect women and I didn't mean to offend her. Then she says ""All day and last time we were on shift that you were constantly telling me how to do my job and explaining to me how to do stuff and repeating things back to me when I've been working here longer then you have"". Again I told her I would never intentionally disrespect her and I apologized and she said don't do it again. Then we left and I clocked out for my shift.

I'm just very upset, I would never ever be misogynist in my life, I was raised by my single mom and grandma all my life. I have friends that are women that are my ride or die. Me and my boyfriend both support womens rights and we call out misogyny always. I don't  remember ever telling her how to do her job or repeating things back to her like demeaning her. Again I would never ever be hateful towards women. 

Again I just feel terrible, I don't want to be seen as ""The hateful new hire"" or assume I'm a bigot. I don't want any drama or bad blood. Should I have not have assumed she needed help with the trash? Again it was just a reflex from my old job. I just wanted to make it easier for her. ",6,1748139026.0,AmItheAsshole,19,0.8,False

Normally it’s pee at the back door on the tiles but last night it was a huge giant shit on the carpet in the theatre room. Totally out of character. 

Anyways, husband wakes up early and goes downstairs to watch the formula one, comes rushing back up while I’m half asleep and dozing, telling me the dog has had a shit in the theatre room. I’m a bit annoyed he woke me out of my doze but it’s fine I had to get up soon regardless. Whatever. Anyways nearly an hour and a half later I’m reading the news and he comes in to the bedroom and goes ‘can you come and help clean up the shit?’….. what the hell?? So he sat down there watching tv having a coffee leaving the shit in the theatre room waiting for me to come down and clean it up. 

I lost it asking why he couldn’t just pick it up and spray the carpet, why did he have to wait for me etc etc. Anyways I go down and watch him pathetically pick it up and then I wipe the carpet and stomp off. I’m furious he left it. Ten minutes later I’m getting ready to take kids out to work and tell him I’m really pissed off that he left it so I could help him. I called him a man child, said it was pathetic and weaponised incompetence and that I’m over his behaviour and I want to go to therapy because I’ve asked him so many times to be a partner and not another child that I have to look after. 

He works hard, provides a good wage, and will ‘help’ clean when I ask and direct him, but that’s it. No help with the kids, no engagement in our life other than what is directed by me and I’m so exhausted. 

His response to me bringing this up ‘again’ was that I needed to take responsibility for the shit because I left the theatre door open last night and didn’t tidy the room before coming to bed. 

I told him I didn’t want to live like this anymore and we needed help because I’ve told him this so many times and he doesn’t listen or understand so we needed help. He basically said that I can leave. I honestly would love to leave but I know my kids wouldn’t get fed properly, they’d not get to school or their activities on time, he literally has no idea about their or my lives so no way I’m leaving. He won’t even take medicine when he feels sick without me telling him what to take. 

I guess I’m asking firstly - am I the asshole for not getting out of bed and helping with the dog shit when he first woke me up? And secondly how the hell do I get through to him. I love him, but mothering this man child is really not sexy or fun anymore. Help! ",3,1748139025.0,AITAH,9,1.0,False

I was working overnights at a wildlife rehabilitation center on the edge of a national forest. I’m not going to say which one—some of you will try to find it, and trust me, **you don’t want to go looking**.

We mostly got raccoons, opossums, injured birds. Nothing dramatic. That night, the lights in the hallway flickered around 2:35 AM. I remember the exact time because I had just made a fresh cup of coffee, and the flickering made me spill some on my wrist. Slightly scalding the sensitive flesh. I was swearing and wiping it off when I heard the front buzzer go off.

Which was weird. Because we don’t get walk-ins; not this late at night anyways. We don’t even have a public-facing entrance. The park itself is tucked away so that the animals aren’t disturbed by the loud passing traffic.

I checked the monitor. Static. Just static.

I buzzed open the gate anyway. I don’t know why. Maybe I wanted it to be something different. I’d been bored for weeks, and loneliness warps the part of your brain that’s supposed to scream **“don’t do it, dumbass.”**

The man who came in wasn’t... right. He was awkwardly tall…  too tall for the doorway, even had to duck to get in. His coat looked like it was soaked in river mud, and he smelled like ozone and iron. Like a thunderstorm that got lost and found its way inside a dead thing. It was truly something awful.

“I have a delivery,” he said.

I blinked. “This is a wildlife rehab facility.”

“It was wounded,” he said. “You fix the wounded.”

He handed me a crate. I don’t remember saying yes, but I took it. His fingers were too long, and they lingered on the box when I pulled it away. Like he didn’t want to let go.

When I looked down, I swear the crate *shifted*. Something inside it *moved*. I heard a scraping noise, that sounded like claws dragging against wood.

He left without a word. I didn’t hear the door open, but he was gone anyway.

I should’ve left it alone. I should’ve called animal control or burned it or thrown it in the river. But I opened it.

Inside was a creature I can’t fully describe. It looked half-formed, like it had been stitched together from things that didn’t belong together. A deer’s face, but with long, mashing teeth. Human-like hands where one would expect his paws to be. Empty, black eyes that **blinked sideways**.

It was whimpering. It sounded like a child.

I didn’t have a choice.

I fed it.

I kept it in the back room. It grew fast. Too fast. And it learned my face. It began to *smile* when it saw me.

But that wasn’t the worst part.

The worst part was the dreams. Dreams of places that weren’t places—of **trees that bled**, of **moons that whispered**, of **my own voice speaking languages I’ve never known**.

Last week, it spoke my name out loud, clear as anything. Its voice was ethereal and haunting—a sound that most people would cringe or cower at just out of instinct.

Then it said, “Now you’ll carry me.”

And I am.

It lives in me now. In my head, my bones, my breath. I don’t sleep. I don’t eat. It feeds on regret and **it’s always full.**

I didn’t have a choice. That’s what I tell myself every night before I shut off the lights and feel it stretch inside me.

But you do. If you ever see a man at your door with a box...

1kurkxa,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1kurkxa/reviving_fried_laptop/,Reviving Fried Laptop,"Just prefacing by saying I am not at all tech savvy, the area I live doesn’t have alot to offer for in-person tech support, and phone support hasn’t been all that helpful.

So I have a Laptop that had an iced coffee spill a few months ago and it got fried, I was wondering if there was a way to revive it in some way? If replacing certain parts could fix it, or if it’s really dead for good. I’ve already had it looked at by a retail tech store, they said they couldn’t do anything about it. I did all the troubleshooting of force powering it down at the time of the spill and letting it dry (at least from what google told me), but it just never charged or turned back on after a few weeks.

I wanted to know before I called it quits and tried to find a way to download any data from it on a USB as it had a few important art pieces I was working on, it was a pretty special device to me, so if anything I might just keep it as a memento if I can’t fix it.
 I might be able to open it up and take photos of the damage as they never showed it to me.

It is one of thise Acer Nitro 5 gaming laptops, 9th gen I believe. Thank you. :)

We left town and followed the coastline through 17 Mile Drive instead. The stops were unplanned and worth it. Crabs spun around in tidepools at China Rock. Bird Rock was loud and full of life. The water at Spanish Bay didn’t look real.

Especially when they be getting nasty/sugary drinks with  many customizations. I understand thats the product we are selling but some places kind of encourage that entitlement that they can customize menu items to their liking to an exetreme extent

Im part time so i cant even really complain, but i guess its just very unfuffiling. I do get that dopamine hit from taking extra shifts and working hard/getting raises so i really cant complain😫 i just dont understand customers",1,1748137576.0,retail,1,0.57,False

Saw one woman and remembered her, she looks amazing (appearance and her creative work, I already like her mind and her face), we have a lot in common. I really want to message her to see if she’d be interested in talking.

She has a cute face and is so talented, I really want to see her happy and hope I’m the guy that could do that for her if she wants me. But I haven’t had a crush in years, I rarely develop feelings. I can socialise with friends just fine, gender doesn’t matter, but as soon as I’m attracted to someone my social skills get evaporated.

I’m going to message her to properly introduce myself, hope she remembers me lmao. Explain we have similar interests and careers, and ask if she’d like to grab a coffee sometime as I’d love to get to know her better.

Hopefully that’s not too weird? I asked some of my friends for advice (women mainly as I thought their perspective is more valuable here) and they said it’s fine - leaves it open ended so she knows I’m not just looking for friendship but I’m not being forceful either. I know some dudes expect a friends to lovers situation, but to me that feels dishonest. I like her, I think she looks amazing and so talented and I want to support her and her talents. I’ve always been drawn to creative ladies, she is very much my type. I want to see her succeed. My cringe dream is to make music with my partner one day.

If it’s a no it’s a no. I rarely get crushes but I deal with rejection mostly okay when they happen. My biggest worry is she finds the initial message weird or outright ignores it, I think I’d be a bit gutted in that case. But she seems friendly and not like the type to do that.

I’ve just never done this before so, advice is appreciated, I guess! Thanks!!",1,1748137496.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

Like what do people do to get better?,"I just had a 9 year relationship end, I had to leave the home and quit my job to move out of state with a family member. I lost the pets, I can't do my hobbies anymore, I can't really listen to music since I'm in an apartment now, I lost basically everything and need to start over.   

It's been like 3 months now and I've been trying to make various dental and eye doctor appointments, trying to take care of myself that way, but I'm losing it. I can barely sleep, I have nightmares most of the time when I do, and I feel myself getting closer to just giving up. I don't see any positive end to this.   

I'm really hurt, I have almost no money, no skills to get a decent job, all my friends have moved and are all over the country and we only text sometimes. I've stopped drinking so I don't even  know where I can  go to try and be social besides bars and that wasn't my thing anyway even when I would drink. I feel like the best outcome possible for me at this point is just finding a job and working to get my own little apartment and just working and sleeping and spending the rest of my life alone having to be quiet. Even that I have to wait to do to get these appointments wrapped up and it's gonna be a pain since I don't drive and you basically need a car in south jersey. I don't even want to take walks around here because the cops in this small town love harassing people, I've had to deal with that before when I lived here years ago, and I don't want to run into anyone I used to know from high school or that I partied with when I was younger. 

I have very basic state insurance because Im not working, and I don't know what to do, who to reach out to, if I should look into a place to go away for a while, but I worry about going to a mental institute, I don't wanna be stuck with people who are legitimately mental, I think about therapy but I don't know if my insurance would cover it, how I wpuld get there (I don't drive and have a little fear of it) I don't know that I could even be honest about my feelings to a therapist. Ive been trying to exercise here and there a d cook here and there but the depression keeps me away from doing those things most days. I wake up and all I do is drink coffee and try and kill time doomscrolling until bed. I can't get a job right now because I have these appointments like once a week right now while I'm getting situated and getting some health things taken care of, and I feel like all I have to look forward to is an eye do tor appointment or dental appointment that only comes once every week or two. 

I just have no idea how I can  start working on this and I know if I don't make some serious changes and start getting help soon I'm not gonna make it. Like I feel myself mentally de lining and thinking about ending it more and more.  Any recommendations or advice? I've gone through similar things before but this time feels very different. I've lost much more than just a person. ",1,1748137493.0,NoStupidQuestions,2,1.0,False

Building a strong romantic relationship isn't just about grand gestures; it's the daily habits and small moments that weave a lasting bond. Imagine your relationship as a garden—you plant seeds of trust, nurture with love, and watch it flourish over time. Let's explore 15 habits that cultivate this thriving connection.

**Open Communication: The Bedrock of Intimacy**

At the heart of every solid relationship lies open and honest communication. It's about sharing your inner thoughts, fears, and dreams without hesitation. When you listen actively, giving your partner your full attention and empathy, you create a safe space where both of you feel heard and valued.

**Gratitude: Nourishing Love with Appreciation**

Ever noticed how a simple thank you can brighten someone's day? In relationships, expressing gratitude for even the smallest efforts strengthens your emotional bond. Whether it's a morning coffee or a supportive gesture during a tough day, acknowledging these acts fosters appreciation and deepens connection.

**Quality Time: Building Memories Together**

Life gets busy, but prioritizing quality time is crucial. Regular date nights or shared hobbies create opportunities to laugh, learn, and rediscover each other. It's not just about being together physically but emotionally connecting through meaningful experiences.

**Physical Touch: The Power of Affection**

From holding hands to cuddling, physical touch plays a vital role in intimacy. It releases oxytocin, the love hormone, promoting bonding and reducing stress. A daily dose of affection strengthens the emotional and physical connection between partners.

**Support and Encouragement: Partners in Growth**

Behind every successful individual is a supportive partner cheering them on. Encouraging each other's goals and dreams builds a foundation of trust and mutual respect. Knowing you have someone in your corner fuels personal growth and strengthens your unity as a couple.

**Conflict Resolution: Turning Challenges into Growth**

Disagreements are inevitable, but how you handle them defines your relationship's strength. Approach conflicts with empathy, respect, and a willingness to compromise. It's not about winning but understanding each other's perspectives and finding solutions that benefit both.

**Romantic Gestures: Keeping the Spark Alive**

Surprises aren't just for special occasions—they're the little sparks that ignite romance daily. Whether it's a love note tucked in a lunchbox or a spontaneous weekend getaway, thoughtful gestures show you cherish your partner and value your connection.

**Shared Joy: Laughter as Glue**

Laughter truly is medicine for the soul, especially in relationships. Sharing moments of joy and humor strengthens your bond and eases tensions. It's about creating a lighthearted atmosphere where you can be yourselves and enjoy each other's company.

**Acceptance and Patience: Embracing Imperfections**

No one is perfect, and that's the beauty of love. Accepting each other's flaws and quirks with patience cultivates a nurturing environment where growth and self-improvement thrive. It's about loving the entirety of your partner, imperfections included.

**Trust and Honesty: The Cornerstones of Security**

Trust is the bedrock of any relationship. Honesty and transparency build a solid foundation where both partners feel secure and valued. It's about being truthful, even when it's difficult, and knowing your bond can weather any storm.

**Celebrating Together: Milestones and Memories**

Life's victories are sweeter when shared with your partner. Celebrate milestones, both big and small, as they reinforce your journey together. Whether it's a promotion at work or a personal achievement, honoring these moments strengthens your sense of partnership.

**Love Languages: Speaking from the Heart**

Understanding each other's love languages—whether it's words of affirmation, acts of service, gifts, quality time, or physical touch—enhances emotional intimacy. It's about expressing love in ways that resonate deeply with your partner's heart.

**Kindness in Action: Daily Gestures of Care**

Kindness isn't just a virtue; it's a fundamental aspect of nurturing a loving relationship. Small acts, like helping with chores or preparing a favorite meal, show thoughtfulness and consideration. These daily gestures reaffirm your commitment to each other's happiness.

**Daily Rituals: Anchors of Intimacy**

Simple rituals, like kissing goodbye in the morning or sharing bedtime stories, create pockets of intimacy amidst life's hustle. They serve as anchors, reminding you of your connection and fostering a sense of security and closeness.

These habits form the fabric of a strong and enduring romantic relationship, where love grows deeper with each passing day. By nurturing these practices, you cultivate not just a partnership but a journey of mutual growth, understanding, and unwavering love.

1kur72n,https://youtu.be/KwOfKLCOWKY,3 Very Scary TRUE Camping In Remote Islands Horror Stories,"**""Campfire and Claws: Our Florida Keys Horror Story"":**

My friend Jamie and I were craving a winter escape from the cold, so we decided to head to the Florida Keys for a camping trip. We’d heard about a free primitive campsite online, tucked away near an old rock quarry off the Overseas Highway. The idea of camping by clear, turquoise water sounded like paradise, especially since we were on a tight budget. The directions took us down a bumpy dirt road, past mangroves and scrubby bushes, until we reached the spot. The quarry was stunning—its water so clear you could see fish gliding below, framed by rocky edges and patches of wild grass. But just a short walk away was an old dump site, a mess of rusted appliances, broken furniture, and tangled metal. It looked abandoned, like it hadn’t been touched in decades, and it gave off an uneasy vibe. “That’s kind of creepy,” I said, eyeing a cracked fridge half-buried in the dirt. Jamie shrugged. “Yeah, but look at this view. We’ll just stay by the quarry.” I nodded, pushing the unease aside, excited to set up camp.We pitched our tent on a flat patch of ground overlooking the water, the quarry sparkling in the light. That first day was perfect. We swam, the water cool and refreshing, and explored the area, finding small shells and spotting a snake slithering into the bushes. “Did you see that?” Jamie asked, pointing. “Just a little one,” I said, trying to sound calm, though it made me wonder what else was out here. We cooked hot dogs over a small fire that evening, the smell of smoke mixing with the salty air. “This is the life,” Jamie said, kicking back in a folding chair, a soda in hand. “No work, no stress, just us and the wild.” I grinned, clinking my can against his. “Here’s to free camping.” We stayed up late, swapping stories, the crickets’ hum lulling us into a sense of peace. That night, we zipped up the tent and fell asleep, feeling like we’d stumbled onto a hidden gem.The next morning, we hiked around the quarry, noticing tire tracks leading toward the dump site. “Someone’s been out here,” I said, pointing at the fresh marks. Jamie squinted. “Maybe they’re cleaning it up or something.” Sure enough, by afternoon, we saw a few people—maybe locals or rangers—working at the dump. They were piling trash and burning it, the smoke curling into the sky. The smell was sharp, like burning plastic, and it drifted toward our camp. “That’s not great,” I said, wrinkling my nose. Jamie waved it off. “It’s far enough. Probably just getting rid of old junk.” But the sight of the fire and the dark pile of debris made my skin prickle. The dump felt like it was watching us, its rusted relics hiding who-knows-what. I tried to focus on the quarry, but I kept glancing over, wondering if we should’ve picked a different spot.That night, everything changed. I woke up in the dark, my heart racing, to a strange sound—scratching, like tiny claws skittering over our tent. At first, I thought it was branches or leaves, but it was too rhythmic, too alive. The noise grew, a frantic pattering, like a hundred little feet. I sat up, my sleeping bag rustling, and nudged Jamie. “Hey, you hear that?” I whispered, my voice tight. He groaned, still half-asleep. “Huh? What’s that noise?” Then he froze, his eyes snapping open as the sound hit him. “What is that?” he said, sitting up fast. We listened, the air thick with tension, as the scampering intensified, like something was crawling all over the tent. I grabbed my flashlight, my hands shaking, and unzipped the tent flap just enough to peek out. My breath caught in my throat. Dozens—maybe hundreds—of rats were swarming around us, their beady eyes glinting in the flashlight’s beam, their bodies darting over the tent and ground.“Rats!” I hissed, yanking the flap shut. Jamie’s face went pale. “Are you kidding me? Rats?” The sound of them scratching and squeaking was unbearable, like they were trying to claw their way inside. My skin crawled, imagining their sharp teeth and wiry tails. “We gotta get them off,” I said, trying to keep my voice steady. “Let’s shake the tent.” We stood, grabbing the tent poles, shaking the fabric as hard as we could. The rats scattered, their squeals piercing the night, but we could still hear them in the darkness, lurking just out of sight. “This is disgusting,” Jamie said, his voice trembling. “Where did they even come from?” I thought of the fire at the dump, the smoke we’d seen earlier. “The burning must’ve stirred them up,” I said. “They’re probably living in that junk pile.”“We need a fire,” I added, my heart still pounding. “Something to keep them away.” We stumbled out of the tent, careful not to step on any rats, and grabbed the firewood we’d stacked earlier. My hands fumbled with the lighter, the darkness pressing in around us. The rats stayed back as the flames grew, but their squeaks echoed from the bushes, and every rustle made me jump. “This is a nightmare,” Jamie said, tossing another stick into the fire. “I thought camping was supposed to be relaxing.” I forced a laugh, but it came out shaky. “Yeah, not like this.” We sat by the fire, taking turns keeping it going, too scared to go back inside the tent. I kept imagining their eyes watching us, waiting for the flames to die. At one point, I thought I saw a pair of glowing eyes in the bushes, but when I swung the flashlight, nothing was there. Maybe it was my mind playing tricks, but it didn’t help the fear gripping my chest.Morning came, and the rats were gone, leaving only their tracks in the dirt. We were exhausted, dark circles under our eyes, our nerves shot. “We can’t stay here,” Jamie said over coffee, his voice flat. I nodded, but part of me didn’t want to give up. “Maybe it was just one night,” I said, not even convincing myself. “The fire’s out now. They might not come back.” Jamie looked at me like I was crazy. “You really want to risk that again?” I sighed, knowing he was right, but we decided to stay one more night, hoping it was a fluke. We spent the day swimming, but the quarry felt different now, its beauty tainted. I kept glancing at the dump, its rusted hulks looming in the distance, wondering what else might be hiding there.That evening, as we cooked dinner, the rats returned. They were bolder this time, darting toward our cooler, climbing over our bags. One scurried across my foot, its whiskers brushing my skin, and I yelped, kicking it away. “No way!” Jamie shouted, grabbing a stick to swat at them. I banged pots together, the clanging echoing, but they kept coming, their tiny claws scratching at our stuff. “This is insane!” I yelled, my heart racing. “We’re leaving. Right now.” Jamie didn’t argue. “Pack it up. I’m done with this place.” We tore down the tent, throwing gear into the car as rats swarmed around us. I kept my flashlight sweeping the ground, terrified one would crawl into our bags or bite us. “Hurry!” Jamie said, tossing the cooler into the trunk. “I’m not getting rabies or whatever these things have.” We jumped into the car, slamming the doors, and sped down the dirt road, the tires kicking up [dust.As](http://dust.As) we hit the Overseas Highway, we saw something that made my blood run cold. A massive alligator—11 feet long, maybe more—lay dead on the side of the road, just a mile from our campsite. Its body was mangled, like it had been hit by a truck, its jaws open, teeth glinting. “Holy… look at that,” Jamie said, his voice barely a whisper. I stared, my stomach twisting. “That was near us,” I said. “I’m so glad we left.” Jamie nodded. “Yeah, I’m never camping in the Keys again.” We drove in silence, the beauty of the islands now overshadowed by the nightmare we’d lived through. The quarry, the dump, the rats, the alligator—it was all too much.After a while, Jamie broke the silence. “You know, that was awful, but it’s kind of a story, isn’t it?” I managed a weak laugh. “Yeah, one we’ll tell forever. But next time, we’re paying for a real campground.” He grinned. “No more sketchy free spots near creepy dumps.” We laughed, the tension easing just a bit, but the fear lingered. Back home, we told our friends, some cracking up, others horrified. “You guys are crazy,” one said, shaking her head. “I’d have left the first night.” Maybe she was right, but it’s a story we’ll never forget—a reminder that nature can be scarier than any ghost story. Next time, I’m checking the campsite reviews twice.





**“No Way Off”:**

I’ll never forget that camping trip to a remote island in the Pacific Northwest. My friends—Jake, Tom, and Ben—and I had been planning it for weeks, dreaming of a weekend away from the noise of the city. We wanted solitude, adventure, and a chance to unplug. We rented a small, weathered boat from a local dock, loaded it with our tents, coolers, and fishing gear, and set out across the choppy water. The island was a speck on the map, known for its untouched forests and empty beaches. When we arrived, it was even better than we’d imagined: towering pines, a crescent of soft sand, and the gentle sound of waves. It felt like we’d stumbled into a postcard.We spent the first day exploring. We hiked a narrow trail through the forest, the ground soft with moss and pine needles. We found a small cove where the water was so clear you could see fish darting below. Jake, always the joker, tried to cannonball into the shallows and ended up with a scraped knee, which we all laughed about. By evening, we set up our camp near the shore. Our tent was a sturdy four-person model, pitched on a flat spot with a view of the water. We built a fire, the logs snapping and popping, and cooked hot dogs on sticks while passing around a bag of marshmallows. Ben told a story about a disastrous fishing trip from last summer, and Tom teased him about his terrible knot-tying skills. It was perfect, like the island was ours alone.It was well past midnight when things changed. I was half-asleep, the fire down to embers, when a rustling in the bushes snapped me awake. At first, I thought it was a deer or maybe a raccoon scavenging for scraps. But then I heard footsteps—heavy, deliberate, not like any animal. They crunched on the dry leaves, slow and steady, circling our camp. My heart started pounding. I nudged Jake, who was snoring softly beside me. “Jake, wake up,” I whispered, my voice tight. “You hear that?”He blinked, groggy, then sat up, listening. The footsteps stopped, then started again, closer. “That’s no animal,” he said, his eyes wide. We unzipped the tent quietly and stepped outside, flashlights in hand. Tom and Ben stirred, mumbling. “What’s going on?” Tom asked, rubbing his face. “Shh,” I said, pointing my flashlight toward the trees. The beam caught something—a figure moving between the pines.A man stepped into the light. He looked like he’d been on the island for years. His hair was long and matted, his clothes torn and stained with dirt. His face was gaunt, with a scruffy beard, and his eyes—wide and unblinking—seemed to glow in the flashlight’s beam. He was muttering to himself, words tumbling out in a low, uneven rhythm. “The island knows… it sees you…” I couldn’t catch it all, but it sent a chill down my spine.“Hey, you okay?” I called, trying to keep my voice steady. He froze, his head jerking toward us. For a moment, he just stared, his mouth still moving silently. Ben stepped forward, hands raised. “We’re just camping. Do you need help? Are you lost?” The man’s eyes locked on Ben, and he said, “You don’t belong here. This is my place.” His voice was flat, almost hollow, like he was reciting something.We stood there, frozen. Jake whispered, “What the hell is this guy’s deal?” I shook my head, unsure. “We’re leaving tomorrow,” I said loudly, hoping to calm him. “We don’t want trouble.” He didn’t answer, just kept staring, his hands twitching at his sides. Then, without a word, he turned and melted back into the woods, his footsteps fading into the darkness.We didn’t sleep after that. “Who was that guy?” Ben asked, his voice shaky. “Some kind of hermit?” Tom suggested, but he didn’t sound convinced. Jake was pacing by the fire. “I don’t care who he is. He’s creeping me out. We should pack up now.” I glanced at the boat, bobbing gently by the shore. “It’s too dark to navigate,” I said. “We’ll leave at first light.” We agreed to take turns keeping watch, sitting by the fire with our camping knives close by. Every rustle, every snap of a branch made my heart race. A few times, I heard him out there—his footsteps circling, his muttering drifting through the trees like a faint, eerie hum.When dawn finally broke, we were exhausted, our eyes bloodshot from lack of sleep. We packed up the tent in a hurry, tossing sleeping bags and gear into messy piles. But when we got to the boat, Tom cursed under his breath. “The engine’s dead,” he said, kneeling by the motor. He lifted a panel and held up a severed wire, the ends frayed. “Someone cut this.” My stomach dropped. “You’re saying he did this?” Jake asked, his voice rising. Tom nodded grimly. “No way this was an accident.”We were trapped on the island with that man. My mind raced with worst-case scenarios. Was he just a loner, or was he dangerous? Had he been watching us all day? “We need to find him,” I said, gripping my knife. “Figure out what he wants.” Jake shook his head. “Are you nuts? He’s probably unhinged.” Ben was quiet, then said, “I’m with you. We can’t just wait here like sitting ducks.” Tom sighed. “Fine, but we stick together.”We armed ourselves—knives, a hatchet, and a heavy flashlight—and headed into the forest. The trees seemed taller now, their branches blocking out the light. The air smelled of damp earth and pine, and the silence was broken only by our footsteps and the occasional bird. After what felt like an hour, we found his camp, hidden in a clearing. It was a lean-to made of branches and a tattered tarp, surrounded by trash: rusted cans, animal bones, a pile of moldy clothes. A small fire pit, still warm, sat in the center. “He’s been here a while,” Tom whispered, picking up a cracked plastic bottle.Before we could look closer, he appeared, stepping out from behind a tree like he’d been waiting. He held a thick, gnarled stick, gripping it with both hands. His eyes were wilder now, darting between us. “This is my island,” he said, his voice low and sharp. “You’re trespassing.” My mouth went dry. “We’re trying to leave,” I said, keeping my hands visible. “Our boat’s broken. Did you mess with it?”He tilted his head, like a dog hearing a strange sound. “You shouldn’t have come,” he said, stepping closer. The stick in his hands looked heavier now, like he could swing it any second. Jake took a step back. “Look, man, we don’t want trouble,” he said. “Just let us go.” The man’s lips twitched, almost like a smile, but his eyes stayed cold. “The island decides who stays,” he said.My heart was pounding so hard I thought it might burst. “Let’s go,” I whispered to the others, backing away slowly. He didn’t move, just watched us, his stick still raised. We retreated through the trees, checking over our shoulders every few steps. His gaze felt like it was burning into my back.Back at camp, Tom dove into fixing the boat, his hands shaking as he worked on the wires. “This is bad,” he muttered. “If he cut this, what else might he do?” Ben kept watch, clutching the hatchet, his eyes scanning the tree line. “I keep thinking he’s out there,” he said. I nodded, feeling the same dread. Every shadow seemed to move, every sound felt like his footsteps.Hours dragged by. Tom spliced wires, tested connections, and swore under his breath. Jake paced, muttering about how we should’ve stayed home. Finally, the engine coughed to life, a weak sputter that felt like a miracle. “Got it!” Tom shouted. We didn’t waste a second, throwing our gear into the boat, not caring how it landed. We pushed off, the motor chugging as we pulled away from the shore.I couldn’t help but look back. There he was, standing on the beach, motionless. His tattered clothes fluttered, and his eyes—those wide, unblinking eyes—locked on us. He didn’t wave, didn’t move, just watched as we drifted farther out. The sight of him standing there, alone on that empty beach, burned into my mind.The ride back was silent. None of us wanted to talk about it, but I knew we were all thinking the same thing: how close had we come to something worse? Who was he—a drifter, a fugitive, or just a man who’d lost his mind to the island? We never found out. When we got back to the mainland, we reported it to the local police, but they didn’t seem surprised. “People go off-grid out there sometimes,” the officer said, shrugging. “Hard to track them down.”That trip changed us. We don’t talk about it much, but I see it in the way Jake flinches at sudden noises now, or how Tom avoids camping altogether. For me, it’s the nightmares—those eyes staring through me, his voice whispering about the island. I’ll never set foot on another remote island again. The memory of that man, his stick, and the feeling of being watched is enough to keep me awake, wondering what might’ve happened if we hadn’t gotten that boat running.





**""The Night the Ocean Vanished"":**

I’d always dreamed of escaping to a place where the world felt far away, where it was just me, my boyfriend, and the wild. We found that chance with a primitive camping trip to the 10,000 Islands in the Florida Everglades, a maze of tiny, uninhabited specks of land surrounded by the Gulf of Mexico. We chose Pavilion Key, a small, sandy island that promised solitude. With our kayaks loaded—tent, sleeping bags, a cooler with food and water, fishing gear, and a small stove—we paddled out from Chokoloskee, the blades slicing through the water, our excitement building with every stroke. The idea of having an entire island to ourselves felt like stepping into a storybook adventure.The paddle took a couple of hours, and when we finally reached Pavilion Key, it was everything we’d imagined. The beach was a soft, pale crescent, fringed with low scrub and mangroves. The Gulf stretched out to the west, endless and shimmering, while distant islands dotted the horizon to the east, too far to feel like neighbors. We dragged our kayaks onto the sand and set up camp near the tide line, hammering tent stakes into the soft ground. The rhythmic lapping of waves was soothing, and we spent the afternoon exploring, fishing, and collecting shells. We caught a couple of small fish, enough for dinner, and laughed as we planned to grill them over a fire.As evening settled in, we noticed the island’s residents: a pack of raccoons, their eyes catching the light of our headlamps. They were bold, scurrying closer than I expected, sniffing at our cooler and bags.“Look at these guys,” my boyfriend said, half-laughing as he waved a stick to shoo one away. “They’re not scared at all.”“They’re after our food,” I said, eyeing a raccoon that was pawing at the sand near our cooler. “We need to secure everything.”“Good call,” he agreed. “Let’s bury the food under the kayak. They can’t move that.”We dug a shallow pit in the sand, piling our food bags and cooler under one of the kayaks, then dragged it over to weigh it down. The raccoons weren’t pleased. They chattered and scratched, their small paws digging around the edges. One even grabbed a chunk of ice from the cooler—left out for drinking water—and tossed it like a toy, the clinking sound echoing in the quiet. It was funny at first, watching them play, but their persistence made my skin prickle. They didn’t act like normal animals, cautious and shy. They acted like they owned the island, and we were the intruders.“Let’s double-check the tent,” I said, trying to shake off the unease. “I don’t want them getting in while we sleep.”We made sure the zippers were tight and the food was buried deep, then crawled into the tent. The waves were close, just a few feet away, their steady rhythm like a lullaby. I felt safe, wrapped in our little cocoon, the vastness of the Gulf outside. We talked for a while, our voices soft, about how perfect this was, how we’d come back next year. Eventually, we drifted off, the sound of the water pulling us into sleep.At 2 a.m., I woke with a start. The tent was silent—too silent. The waves had stopped. No gentle lapping, no rustling of leaves, no hum of insects. Just a heavy, unnatural stillness that made my chest tighten. I lay there, eyes wide, trying to make sense of it. My heart started to pound, a quiet dread creeping in. Something was wrong, but I couldn’t place it. I reached for my flashlight, my fingers fumbling, and unzipped the tent as quietly as I could, not wanting to wake my boyfriend yet.Stepping outside, I was struck by the sky. It was breathtaking, a dome of stars so bright they seemed close enough to touch, the Milky Way a glowing ribbon across the darkness. For a moment, I was lost in it, almost forgetting why I’d come out. Then I turned my flashlight toward the shore, and my breath caught in my throat. The beach stretched out impossibly far, a wide, glistening expanse of sand and mud where the water should have been. I took a few steps, my bare feet sinking into the cool, damp ground, and shone the light farther. No waves, no tide, just an endless plain of exposed seabed, littered with shells and strands of seaweed.My stomach twisted. I’d seen news reports about tsunamis, how the ocean pulls back before a massive wave surges in, wiping out everything. Was that happening here? On this tiny, flat island, with no high ground, no escape? My hands shook as I swung the flashlight around, searching for any sign of water. Nothing. The ocean was gone, and we were alone in the middle of nowhere.I ran back to the tent, my heart hammering. “Hey, wake up,” I said, shaking my boyfriend’s shoulder, my voice trembling. “Something’s really wrong.”He stirred, blinking in the dark. “What? What’s going on?”“The ocean’s gone,” I said, the words spilling out. “The water—it’s not there. The beach is huge, and I can’t see the sea.”He sat up, rubbing his eyes. “What do you mean, gone? That’s not possible.”“Come look,” I urged, tugging at his arm. “I’m serious. It’s freaking me out.”He grabbed his own flashlight, and we stepped out together. He froze when he saw the beach, the beam of his light sweeping over the endless sand. “This… this isn’t right,” he muttered, his voice low. “The water was right there when we went to bed.”“Is it a tsunami?” I asked, my voice barely above a whisper. “You know, like in those videos? The water pulls back before it hits?”He didn’t answer right away, just kept shining his light, his face pale in the glow. “I don’t know,” he said finally, his voice tight. “Maybe. Or maybe it’s just a weird tide. But if it is a tsunami… we’re in trouble.”My stomach dropped. The island was nothing but a low strip of sand, barely above sea level. No trees to climb, no hills to run to. Just us, our tent, and the kayaks. “What do we do?” I asked, my hands clenching. “Should we get in the kayaks and paddle out?”“And go where?” he said, turning to me, his eyes wide. “If it’s a tsunami, we’d be caught in the middle of it. The kayaks won’t help.”I swallowed hard, my throat dry. “So we just… wait? Hope it’s not?”He nodded slowly, his jaw tight. “We listen. If a wave’s coming, we’ll hear it. We’ll have a few seconds, maybe.”A few seconds. The thought made my legs feel weak. We stood there, side by side, staring into the darkness. My flashlight beam trembled, catching glints of shells and small crabs scuttling across the exposed mud. The silence was oppressive, like the air itself was holding its breath. Every second stretched into forever, my mind racing with images of a wall of water rushing toward us, swallowing the island whole.“Do you hear anything?” I whispered, my voice shaking. “Anything at all?”He shook his head, his eyes fixed on the horizon. “Nothing. Just… keep listening.”We stood there for what felt like hours, though it was probably only minutes. My heart pounded so hard I could feel it in my ears. I kept imagining the roar of a wave, the kind that sweeps away entire towns. The raccoons were gone, their chatter silenced, as if they knew something we didn’t. The island felt alive, watching us, waiting.Then, faintly, I heard it—a soft, distant lapping. The water was coming back. It started as a trickle, a thin line of foam creeping up the sand, then grew steadier, the waves reclaiming the beach inch by inch. My knees nearly buckled with relief, but I couldn’t relax, not yet.“It’s the tide,” my boyfriend said, his voice low but steadier now. “Must’ve been a super low tide, or some kind of current pulling the water out. Not a tsunami.”I nodded, but my hands were still shaking. “That was the scariest thing I’ve ever seen,” I said, my voice cracking. “I thought we were going to die.”He put his arm around me, pulling me close. “Me too. Let’s just… stay out here for a bit, make sure it’s back to normal.”We didn’t go back to the tent. We sat on the sand, watching the water, listening to the waves grow stronger, their familiar rhythm slowly easing the knot in my chest. But the fear lingered, a cold weight in my stomach. We stayed up until dawn, too wired to sleep, our flashlights trained on the shoreline.When morning came, the beach looked like it had the day before, the water lapping gently at the tide line, the raccoons back to their mischief. We packed up in silence, moving quickly, eager to leave. As we loaded the kayaks, I kept glancing at the water, half-expecting it to vanish again.“That was too close,” I said as we pushed off, the island shrinking behind us.“Yeah,” my boyfriend said, his voice quiet. “I don’t think I’ll ever forget that.”As we paddled back to Chokoloskee, I couldn’t stop looking over my shoulder at Pavilion Key. It looked peaceful now, just a strip of sand in the vast Gulf. But I knew I’d never see it the same way. That night, the silence, the missing ocean—it showed me how small we are, how quickly nature can turn on you. We were lucky, but I’ll always wonder what would’ve happened if the water hadn’t come back. ",1,1748137173.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

1kur6bj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kur6bj,ADHD water cup solution!,"I have a dedicated 32 oz water cup but my partner doesn’t so there have been cups & coffee mugs everywhere for a while. 

I went to the thrift store and bought the following 
2 large mugs 
2 medium mugs 
And one tiny mug for my daughter 

After a week, I happy to report this worked! 
Instead of 7 cups, the large mugs are easier to grab, carry, and see. 

I tucked all the coffee mug handles away and placed the new glass mugs facing out thus making them easier to grab. 

One other note, our dining set is tragically not microwave save- the shelf above the cups is all microwave safe and on the stove top, I keep to glass pie pans for microwaving big stuff.

1kur57b,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1kur57b/aita_for_overreacting_about_my_manipulative_and/,AITA for overreacting about my manipulative and lying ex?,"So it’s going to be a long story sorry in advance. Also English isn’t my native language so also sorry about maybe some grammar mistakes. To make it easier I will call my ex Mick (M24) and myself (F24).

Okay so I’ve been in a relationship with a guy named mick for 5 months. And everything was great! But his family wasn’t happy with me. I did everything to make them like me , like bringing souvenirs from my vacation and bringing chocolate the first time we met. And first they liked me. But than back in February  his sister was using me to get to her brother to let him drive her to a party. And first she wasn’t aloud to go to the party from her parents but then they changed their mind. So his sister was shit talking there parents and I told her like yes something I don’t know what your mom means. And we asked her if we had to pick her up that night and she wasn’t sure about it. Than later that night Mick and I were waiting for her to respond to my text about how late we should pick her up and she didn’t replay. So we’ve waited until 2 am for her to respond and went to bed and 10 minutes later she walked in. So the next day I was kinda avoiding her because we ignored me last night.

And we had a birthday that night from Mick and his mom. So later that night I was helping the party to serve drinks and food and helping. And at one point I was doing it all by myself. And I velt like I was being used but I let it slide. And the next day his sister came home from work and asked me like why aren’t you home yet and I told her I was going tomorrow. Than so made a snorty comment and said okay in which I replayed with do you want me gone (in a sarcastic way) and she answered no. Than the next week I asked Mick to ask his sister about what was happing last weekend because she was very mean to me. And than the tables turned around because at one point even his parents were hating me because of my sarcasm comment.  And I wasn’t aloud in there home for weeks. And even Mick became mad at me but in the first place he said I was right.

Than on his birthday (15 march) he wanted me to be there and invited me over even when I wasn’t aloud to come he said like I want you to talk to my parents. And let me wait for almost one hour to pick me up and than brought me to his parents. And they were shit talking me in front of me. They said we’re not going to respect the things you said to our daughter.

And his mom told me like we’re family persons and you’re going to respect that and be a family person as well (in a commanding way). And after that they asked me if there was anything I wanted to said and I said yes. I’ve told you guys before about my illness (which is a chronic tiredness which makes me tired all the time and I need at least 9 hours sleep a day or I will be sick, like trowing up and passing out) and they responded every time I told them with only “Okay” not with how it happened or what it does or if there is any medicine. And I asked them why they only told me okay and his dad said yeah that’s because you talk to much. Which hurt me a lot ofcours.

And a week before his birthday we went to Switzerland together without his parents knowing. It was kinda random I went to therapy and we was coming with me and after that we wanted to do a drink in a city nearby and we saw a cafe with the name Paris is still far away and we were joking about going to Paris and than Berlin and than we were serious looking to go somewhere and went to Zurich Switzerland. And it was very beautiful. But on the first night we got freaky and he wanted to grab my neck while doing the deed. And he slapt me in my face really hard. And I was really scared for a while.

And everything went okay until Easter here is were it’s going downhill very fast. So before Easter and after the conversation  with his parents. His mom made comments about me coming late out of bed over and over again. And one evening after we had 2 long days (one going to the zoo and the other was shopping with my friends. And we had to at his parents place and after dinner I was very tired and his mom asked me if I wanted some coffee and I said no thank you I tired already and if I’m going to drink coffee than I will be more tired after. And his grandma replayed with you’re young and go around for a run it will help. And his dad was laughing to and didn’t say anything to his mom. And at that moment I felt body shamed and not taking seriously because his parents knew about my illness and didn’t tell there grandma or make her change what she was saying.

So yeah his family didn’t liked me that much. Also I forgot to mention that mick is on a atletic team and is a runner for the past 18 years (this is important for later). So 2 weeks before Easter I heard that I could get a house in a city nearby where I was living and it was easier for me to go places (near a train station instead of a small village with a busstation). Also I forgot to mention that 6 years ago I moved from the west side of the country to the east side for a boyfriend and still living in the east side, and my mom still in the west side and Mick was also living in the west side. So that weekend I was at his place and his mom made comments again and I was just done with the comments and I told mick I was going home and he could tell his parents I went home sick (I also became sick after). But he had a birthday from his uncle that evening and his grandma was shit talking about me again why I didn’t move closer to his side of the country. And I’m still in school and I’m going to be for the next 8 years.  And also it is very hard to get a house on his side of the country because it is more expensive because it is nearby the capital of the country and there a lot of big city’s there (I’m living in the Netherlands I know it’s not important but across country is 2,5 drive by car). And also I wasn’t ready to move because we were long together.

The week after this happend I starting moving from my old place to the new one. And it was the week of Easter and we were going out of diner with his family. And he went behind my back and told his grandma that I wasn’t coming because I had to paint. And he told me a few days before. And I got angry like why would you tell this? And I said go and fix this because it is your mess. And in the end it couldn’t be fixt because the whole restaurant was fully booked. So I spend Easter alone because my mom was gone and he dropped me af at my moms. And I told him don’t do something like this ever again. And not even 2 weeks later he did the same thing he went behind my back and told his dad that I was leaving a day earlier that I had planned and didn’t discuss it with me. And I told him if he did something again that we’re going to be done. And even 4 days later he did the same. So mick is also a trainer for kids around 14/15 years at his club. And while we were moving, his trainer of his team called and he put him out of his team. And it broke his heart. And ever since he is out of the team his trainer told is old teammates to not talk to him anymore and the trainer didn’t want to talk to him anymore of put him on races. So he wanted to talk to the big boss of the club and that planned a time and the boss cancelled last minut. So back to the story, after 4 days he did it again. Because the boss finally had time to speak at Saturday that week. And we had a appointment at the west side of the country at 4:30 pm and a birthday after. And he had to be a trainer at a race before but because his old teammates were there as trainers he didn’t had to be there. But because the boss could talk he said I will be there and told his old teammates as well as the kids he trains. Everyone accept me, and dropped the news 2 days before. And I was angry and told him that I didn’t want to sleep with him anymore because of his actions. And he didn’t accepted that and pushed his way forward and raped me. And I was so blind of love that I accepted it.

The next morning we had a fight, and he walked out of the house for a walk. And told me he wanted to go to the police and give himself up for what he did the night before. And he didn’t do it and it was bluff. After that he went to a Turkish shop for breakfast and picked up food for which most of it i didn’t like and he knew this and eat it himself. So before we left for the race I said should we go to the shop to get some food so I can eat it in the car. And he said no we’re going to have nuggets from McDonald’s on the way. So I said okay and got in the car. And halfway I asked him are we going to McDonald’s anytime soon because I’m very hungry because you ate all the food. And he said no I will drive to the race because we’re already late. Then when we came there he went to talk to the boss while I was waiting in the sun for 45 minutes. Than he came back and wanted to give me something else they had at the race which i also didn’t like. And I was like okay you also told you’re friends you be here go to them and I will wait in the car until you’re done. And after 15 minutes he came to the car and I asked him why he left already and he told me I told my friends I had a different appointment later so I got to go. And on the way to the race we saw a store which is a Asian store. So we went there and I told him that I was craving loempia’s and we went inside. At the bar we saw the also had sandwiches and he was ordering sandwiches for him self and asked if they had loempia’s and the lady behind the desk told him yes. And he went to pay. So again for the 5th time he made a choice for me without talking to me first. So now I got mad also because I hadn’t eating for 6 hours. At before that 1 loempia (which isn’t filling at all) and I told him we were done. But because we had a lot of things to day I didn’t mean it. And we went out for drinks with his collegeas and than the birthday than dropped me off at my moms again. And the next day it was mothersday and he had things to do with his family. And I wasn’t included. And he said you can come after. So my mom put me on the train and he said yeah go home I’m not done yet. And so I went home. And that next Wednesday I had therapy and it was a very hard session and mick knew this he also told me he would call me after. So a few hours when I was in the train (in our country we have different parts in the train, one voor silence and isn’t allowed to talk and one which is allowed) and I was sitting in the silence one and he called me. He wanted to talk about therapy and I told him that I was in the silence part of the train, he didn’t care. He kept talking and I said I didn’t had the energy to go cook at home because I was so tired. And he said do you want me to order you something. And I answered with hmm (in a positive way like yes, because everyone in the train was watching me and I couldn’t answer anymore). I also asked him to wait a few minutes because I was going off the train in 3 minutes and he said no I have to go to my friends because we’re going to a football game. So when I was home I told him I was home and fell a sleep. After 3 hours I woke up and I still haven’t had a reaction. And than after 2 hours after I woke up I had a reaction and it was already 10pm. And I asked him why he did promise to order food but never did. And he said it was because of my reaction. After that evening I told my friends all what happened because I didn’t know what to do and said I was going over on Friday to him to end things.

That Friday I went over and we had an amazing time, and even Saturday we had an amazing time. That evening he had to put garbage in the bin, and instead of putting it in the bin he put it next to it. (This is also important for the story) And that Sunday a friend from the west side was coming over for coffee and Mick was taking positive about me and after a hour the friend left. When the friend left mick came to me and told me we were over. He said it was because I deserve beter. He was also constantly comparing himself to my ex which I’m still friends with (only because our relationship was more a friendship than a relationship). And with mick I had a real relationship.

And we talked for a while about it but he was sure. And he left and went home. The next day I told him I wanted him back. Until the evernoon because he wanted me back and I was like now you realise that you’ve heard me and told him no. And he started crying, and even went yelling so I hung up. And he sended a voice message in which he was crying his heart out and was sorry. And after hearing that I realised I did wanna be with him. And called him and he said I was going to the gym and would call me after he cleared his mind. So after 1,5 hours he called me and said he was done with me. It felt like my heart broke a second time. And of the next thing I’m not proud, but I had a depressive episode and wanted to ended my life at that point, because he was the best boyfriend I had for a while before things happend. And he became worried and told me he would call his parents and then was coming over. He started driving to me and after 20 minutes he went to a gasstation. When he walked in he said my phone is almost empty and it is very busy here I’m going to hang and will call you back when I’m on the road. After 30 minutes I called him back and he told me there was an error at the gasstation and he would leave soon. So I got in the shower and than the doorbell ring, it was the cops. They had receive a call that someone was worried about me and I’ve been not responding for hours. Which is crazy because I’ve been calling my friends and Mick in the past hours. So I reassure them that I wasn’t going to do something than the cops left.

Than I called mick and after 5 times he picked up, and I asked him quess who was at the door? Him: I don’t know who? Me: the cops. Him: yeah I know. Me: Like how do you know? Him: I called them. Me: But why? Him: I was worried about not getting there on time. Me: you were on your way to me, we’re going to talk and everything is going to be fine. After this conversation we were going back and fort about him coming over. And he said no, at that point something snapped in me. And I said than I’m going to let your mom know the things you did to me like the slap and the rape and the lying (because he was lying to his parents for months) and he panicked and he ordered me to delete his moms and sisters number and then he would come. So I showed him by screenshots and he said he was shaking and going home. And he than ignored my texted for the night and morning. The next morning the cops were again at my door, now because of the rubbish he had dumped and now I had to pay a fine of €120.  So I called him, and he was saying okay I will pay the fine if I get all my stuff back (the night before I put all his pokemon cards he had at my place on Facebook marketplace and he went on me the next day). And I said okay you get your stuff and he was talking about that he’s collegeas were worried about him and he told them everything. Also he told me that he still loved me, and asked me that if I wanna fix things with his family how would I do it? At the same time he told me that he was done with me and didn’t wanna talk to me for months. And that what I’ve done to him the night before was unforgivable. After the call I let him because he didn’t want any contact. Later that day he texted me that I didn’t forget his razor. Which was crazy because he would pick up his stuff at Friday (this was 3 days before). The next day he told me that he would come around to pick up his stuff tomorrow , he demented and I was at therapy around that time at I sended him a text with my therapist and told him: we can make a appointment for next week because I’m not ready to see you yet. And also I’m worried of my cats. In which he responds with: why are you think I would hurt them, also he was your therapy and don’t you trust me? And I only responded to the therapy question with: I’m still at therapy. So he followed with the question why do you text than. In which I respond with because i made the text together with my therapist. And then he pushed again to come the next day to pick up his stuff and I said no because I wasn’t ready for it. And he asked me why and told me he had a car crash and damaged his car because he fel a sleep while driving.

Later that day I texted him and said we can call and make an appointment for next week. And he asked me how long do you need and I said 5 minutes. And he kept pushing for tomorrow and I asked is next week possible and he said no and then we were watching week by week until it was September because he said he had no time. And then it was 18 minutes later and he became mad and said I’m going to be there tomorrow to pick up my stuff and hung up. And I told him no after, he just didn’t want to listen. Later that night I told him if he wants someone in the morning to talk to because if he had te feeling he would fall a sleep than he could call. Because he had to drive for 3 hours in the morning. Luckily I bought a ring doorbell and inside camera last Monday. So Thursday morning I installed it, before he came. Also that morning I called him for the 3 hours and he was again talking about how bad I was for him. And how much I’ve hurt him Monday. He forgets that he promised to come to me than never came and also called the cops on me like that didn’t even hurt but okay. He also told me that there were a lot of girls who wanted to sleep with him but he never done something with. And also told me that he still loved me but also hates me. He told me if I didn’t trust him I should buy a ring doorbell. (Which I already did at that point without telling him). He asked me to think about him coming over that day to pick up his stuff and I said okay I will speak it over with a friend who is coming over any second. Than he said okay you can give my number to that friend and he could call me and he could explain his story (I think gaslighting him also). So I talked it over with a few friends and they said let him pick up his stuff the sooner he will be gone of your life. So I said okay come over. So he told me he would be there around 4:30pm and ended up showing up at 5:50pm. And the friends who were at my place left so I could talk to him. On his way I asked him if he needed anything like food or something because he still had to drive 2,5 hours back and was driving for 3 hours already. So I made dinner for him (yes I know I shouldn’t done it because he is very rude but I have a to good heart sometimes). So he drove in to my street and called me and yelled that I should turn of the camera. (Like what? He told me that morning to buy it and now it has to be gone?). So I shut off the camera and let him in. Than I give him his food and he was shit talking me again about I’m in pain but he is in more because of Monday. And he dared me to kiss him and was angry at the same time. And told me I had to change a lot of things about myself. The biggest plottwist was that I had to give my phone for him to delete the numbers of his friends and looking for the numbers of his mom and sister. And than he asked me if I asked my friend to unblock him and tell them that the story about him raping me is a kinda lie and I gave him signals in the car over there. After that he left and he asked me if I still want a kiss before he left. And he went on his way home. So I put him in the WhatsApp group again and he called me very happy and asked me if it is okay to send “I’m back bitches”. And I said that’s up to you do what you want. And since that he’s trying to get attention from anyone in the group. And reaction to almost everything and we’re excluding him in our conversations. And before anyone is asking why I don’t just block him and be done with it, is because I bought festival tickets for in 2 weeks. And it was a gift for him helping with the moving and they were very expensive. One is in his name so yes I still wanna go with him and after that be done with him. And if he decided to not come along I will charge him for it and more stuff I bought and the fine.

1kur44i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Interstitialcystitis/comments/1kur44i/how_can_i_differentiate_between_ic_oab_and/,"How can I differentiate between IC, OAB, and anxiety? Does the difference matter?","Long story short: I suffered from pelvic discomfort (CPPS, at least according to my urologist) last year that lasted about 3-4 months. Physical pain is gone now. I was left with some issues related to urination, and I don't know how to classify them. I don't know if the difference really matters, but providers seem flummoxed by me and I keep getting passed around, and I wonder if I'm not saying the right thing.

Fundamentally my quality of life is negatively impacted by the following: Occasionally - not always, but roughly every other day or so - I will unexpectedly feel some kind of sensation in my bladder as soon as 45 minutes after my last pee. I can always trivially hold it for several more hours, but I do feel it the whole time, like I'm aware of it filling drop-by-drop. I've never felt like it will leak, and never had to drop what I was doing and run to the bathroom. The OAB assessment tool (https://www.urologyhealth.org/documents/Product-Store/English/Overactive-Bladder-OAB-Assessment-Tool.pdf) mentions the following: ""Higher scores above may mean more severe OAB symptoms. But if your score for  
Urgency is 0, then you do not have the major symptom of Overactive Bladder."" The ""Urgency"" question is: ""How often do you have a strong, sudden urge to pass urine where you fear you may leak urine?"" I definitely don't have that. It starts as a weak urge that I feel surprisingly early, and builds slowly. So, I guess I don't have OAB?

On the other hand, I never have any pain, and the symptoms are wildly inconsistent (there are days where I drink >2L of water and don't feel anything for 6 hours, and days where I drink a cup of water with dinner and feel a slight urge to pee 45 minutes after peeing) - one of the stressful things is that it's 100% uncorrelated with my diet/lifestyle choices, and even the amount I drink. Absolutely no rhyme or reason to it. I have obsessively tried to catalog it (IC diet, elimination, etc.) and there is zero correlation, it's always just all over the place. So, I don't know if IC fits the bill either. 

Finally, when I describe these symptoms to my partner, she feels that what I describe is totally normal, and that me sometimes feeling an urge to pee 45 minutes later is just because I tend to drink a lot of coffee and water. She says the same thing happens to her and she doesn't worry about it - she just pees again if her body is telling her to, even if it's a little bit. I envy her ability to just do that and move on. I DO drink a lot of coffee and water, but 75% of the time I can go 4-6 hours without feeling a darn thing, so it's hard for me to accept a cause related to that. My partner feels that I'm likely suffering from somatic obsession and the negative impact on my quality of life is more related to anxiety than a physical problem.

I'm motivated to seek care and work on this, but my urologist thinks I'm nuts (and says nothing is wrong with me) and my pelvic floor PT says I have a totally normal pelvic floor and doesn't know what to do beyond recommending bladder training. I guess I'm technically already following bladder training guidelines by never peeing more often than every 2-3 hours, but it's been stable with no improvement for >3 months. I'm awaiting an appointment with a therapist but I'm not optimistic. I have been diagnosed with GAD in the past, so there is some precedent for anxiety issues.

I guess I wish I could just go back and count how many times I peed before this all happened. For all I know this is how I've always been, and the CPPS just caused me to be hyper aware of it. But I can never know that, and I'm trapped here.

I think the other thing I'm getting tripped up on is chasing a cause - does a cause even matter? Are the treatments different, or is CPPS/IC/OAB/Anxiety all just about getting the bladder to behave?",1,1748136902.0,Interstitialcystitis,4,1.0,False

I went to Poof Doof this weekend — had fun dancing, but didn’t really connect with anyone. A few guys stared, a couple grabbed, and when I tried talking to people, it kind of flopped. I got the vibe that they thought I was hitting on them, but honestly, I’m just trying to make some friends and not feel like I’m on gay exchange student mode 24/7.

So I’m throwing it out there:
	•	Where do gays in this city go when they’re not trying to hook up or lose their hearing in a club?
	•	Are there cafés, wine bars, or events where people actually talk to each other?
	•	Also, are Aussies just more reserved, or am I doing something super American and scaring people off?

A bit about me — I’m 27, from NYC, and working in clinical research. Outside of work, I’m into EDM, fitness (weight lifting, running, long walks with good coffee), design, and finding the best local spots wherever I go (very travel heavy job in US and International). I’m not here to date or hook up — just really hoping to meet a few kind, interesting people and not spend the next three months exploring Melbourne solo. Because wandering around solo with a negroni and a hopeful smile can only get me so far.

Entry: “It can happen to anyone… *or can it?*”

We didn’t sit down with grand thematic ambitions this morning. Just coffee, comfort, and *Annie* (1982) on the screen. That’s the thing about movies, though. You’re not always watching them so much as *being watched back* and somewhere around “I Think I’m Gonna Like It Here,” Zedd turned and said:

“*This is kind of like Willy Wonka, isn’t it?*”

This kind of dropped randomness is one of the great things about watching movies with Zedd… but it can also be disorienting. I start with “what?!?” move to denial “no.. hu-uh”, then see it, “…well, I’ll be damned!”

Once the idea was in the air, it refused to unstick. *You can’t unring a bell* and a pattern spotted is a pattern seen.

At a glance, *Annie* and *Willy Wonka* seem like opposites: a Depression-era orphan musical versus a psychedelic morality play set in a candy-coated factory. But dig a layer deeper and they reveal an uncanny alignment.

Both stories center a poor child who is virtuous, hopeful, and unspoiled. They are invited into the private world of a wildly wealthy and emotionally distant eccentric. Both children are “picked,” in a sense, by fate or design. Both come away from their experience not just with wealth, but with belonging. A home.

But how that transformation happens aaahhh, there’s the crux.

**Annie: The Luck of Being Seen**

Annie, like so many orphan tales, runs on the fuel of impossible hope. She smiles when the world tells her not to. She charms billionaires, befriends bodyguards, sings in the White House. She doesn’t cheat, steal, or beg. She endures. And when the lightning finally strikes, it’s her pluck and warmth that melt Daddy Warbucks’ iron heart.

We said aloud: *She got lucky*. Right place, right time, **right girl**.

There’s a beauty in that message: that someone out there might be watching, and that your goodness matters even when it doesn’t seem to. But it also hinges on *being seen* by the right person. For every Annie, a dozen kids stay behind in the orphanage. That’s not cynicism. That’s math.

**Wonka: The Test Beneath the Dream**

Charlie Bucket’s story feels similar at first. Humble boy. Golden ticket. One-in-a-million shot. But unlike Annie, Charlie doesn’t just stumble into his reward. Nope, he’s tested. Every corridor of that factory is a temptation, a trap dressed as delight. The other children fall, one by one, to their own worst impulses. Charlie comes close to it as well, as he drinks the Fizzy Lifting Drink, breaks a rule, almost fails.

But when the moment comes to sell out Wonka for personal gain, he just doesn’t. Not because he’s told not to. Not because he sees a reward waiting. Just because it’s the right thing to do.

And that’s when everything changes.

“*So shines a good deed in a weary world.*”

Wonka’s factory wasn’t a contest. It was a *filter*. Charlie’s “luck” wasn’t dumb chance. It was earned, not in the winning, but in the refusing.

So what do we take from this? Maybe that some stories teach us to wait for our moment, keep singing, and believe we’ll be noticed. Others teach us that the moment is *always now* and we’re being measured in silence.

Both Annie and Charlie end up chosen. But their routes there couldn’t be more different.

One wins with joy.
The other, with restraint.
One transforms the world.
The other, himself.

We’ll leave you with Wonka’s words, since they seem oddly suited to the space we occupy here, too:

“*In this room, all of my dreams become realities, and some of my realities become dreams.*”

That’s this project. That’s this post. That’s *you*, reading this.

I did receive quite a few messages that Reddit chat would not let me see/respond to so I’m super sorry if you took the time to introduce yourself and I did not respond.)

Howdy,

Prefacing this whole thing with the fact that I am looking for connection and conversation but open to more (hoping for more) if it develops. Just putting low expectations on everyone involved as this is Reddit and, well, you get where I’m going with that. I’m also happy to make new friends and totally welcome those conversations as well. 

Anywho, about me: I’m a musician. I’ve been playing music since I was in high school and writing my own songs all along the way. I play a couple instruments and sing. I’ve toured, released records, played some big shows and plenty of not so big shows… until recently when I’ve taken a step back to focus on other things in life. I still write my own stuff, however.

I love coffee, travel, and digging through crates for weird vinyl records. I also enjoy some sports - football, basketball, and hockey. Outside of that I’m a tech enthusiast and have a 3d printer that gets plenty of use. I have a projector that gets regular use for movie nights or lazy tv watching on my bedroom ceiling. I try to be a very kind and empathetic person in all aspects of my life but I’m also not afraid to stand up for myself and advocate for others. I’m told that I’m the nicest asshole you’ll ever meet. I’ve been through and continue to be in therapy to forge a better relationship with myself and those around me.

I’m currently back in school and working towards my degree while working full time. My dream once I finish school is spend a month exploring Europe if all things shake out accordingly.

Outside of that I’m on a fitness quest and so far have made a bit of progress but still have a long road ahead of me. The benefits on my mental health alone are worth every day leg day kicks my ass, haha.

And as I feel it is worth mentioning just in case:  I am child free (but look forward to being a rad aunt), and monogamous. Also a domme. Skew more chapstickish or soft masc, generally. I have many tattoos and a couple piercings.

Who I’m looking for… Well, first and foremost I am not looking to chat with anyone too much younger than myself. Let’s say 28–40 would be my ideal range, especially if it’s for more than just friendly chat. 

I tend to be attracted to those who skew more femme. Looking for someone who shares some interests or has curiosity in general about the things I’m passionate about. In return I can promise the same. I also value good energy, positivity (not to be confused with toxic positivity), and someone who has goals and things they’re pursuing. I’ve always been told I’m a good motivator and an even better cheerleader. 

Beyond that… anyone who shares some common interests. I value reciprocity in conversation so please be prepared to have some back and forth.

I am truly open to strictly new friends, anyone who wants to chat sports/hobbies, or perhaps someone who wants to be fitness buddies. I’m always trying to expand my world not shrink it. If you’re just looking for new friends please just give me a heads up!",2,1748136437.0,lesbianr4r,0,1.0,False

No, they’d vanish—gone without a trace by sunset, leaving me alone in the house. I’d search for them, call their names, but they were always gone, like they’d never existed. It wasn’t something we ever talked about. The next morning, they’d be back, acting as if nothing had happened, like it was just another night. But it wasn’t. I knew that. I learned that the hard way.

It all started when I was six years old. I remember that first Halloween like it was yesterday. I was dressed as a witch, excited to go trick-or-treating. But just as the sun dipped below the horizon, I noticed the house felt different—cold, quiet, too quiet. I ran through the halls, calling for my mom and dad, but no one answered. Panic set in. I thought maybe they were hiding, playing a prank, but after what felt like hours of searching, I realized they were gone. The front door was locked, the windows were shut, and I was completely alone.

That’s when I found the first note.

It was on the kitchen table, written in my mom’s familiar handwriting. It simply said:

Rule 1: ***“Stay in your room. Do not come out until sunrise. Whatever you hear, ignore it.”***

I didn’t understand then. I was scared, confused, and alone. I didn’t want to stay in my room; I wanted to find my parents. But something about the note made me follow the instructions. I took a flashlight and a pillow, locked myself in my room, and crawled under the covers. I thought maybe it was some kind of weird game. I wasn’t sure.

That night, I didn’t sleep much. The house creaked and groaned, more than usual. I heard strange noises—soft scratching at my door, footsteps in the hallway, whispers that I couldn’t quite make out. I told myself it was the wind or my imagination, but deep down, I knew it wasn’t. Something was in the house with me.

The next morning, when I opened my door, my parents were back. They were sitting at the kitchen table, sipping coffee like nothing had happened. I asked them where they’d gone, what had happened, but they just smiled and said I must have had a bad dream.

That was the beginning.

Every Halloween after that was the same. My parents would disappear just before nightfall, leaving me alone with a note. Each year, the instructions got a little more specific, a little more ominous. By the time I was eight, the notes included things like:

Rule 2: ***“Don’t look out the windows.”*** and Rule 3: ***“Don’t respond if someone calls your name.”***

And the noises—they got worse.

One year, when I was nine, the sounds outside my room became unbearable. There were knocks on the door, not gentle, but loud, insistent pounding. I pressed my hands over my ears, squeezing my eyes shut, but I couldn’t block it out. The voice on the other side was familiar—my mother’s voice, calling my name.

**“Ellie, it’s okay. You can come out now.”** She sounded so calm, so normal. For a second, I almost believed it was really her. But the rule had been clear: ***“Do not open the door, no matter what you hear.”***

So I didn’t. I stayed under the covers, trembling, until the knocking stopped. I never told my parents about the voice, and they never asked.

The years passed, and the game continued. It became a twisted Halloween tradition. While other kids dressed up and collected candy, I stayed locked in my room, listening to the house come alive with things I couldn’t see. I became used to the notes, the strange noises, and the feeling of being watched. It was all part of the game, my own haunted ritual.

But when I turned thirteen, everything changed.

That year, the note was different. I found it on my bed just as the sun was setting, but instead of the usual instructions, it said:

Rule 4: **“There’s something new in the house tonight. Be careful.”**

I didn’t know what that meant, but the moment I read it, I felt a chill run down my spine. Something new? What did that mean? I locked my door, as usual, and tried to settle in for the night, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was terribly wrong.

The noises started earlier than usual. At first, it was the familiar creaks and footsteps. I’d gotten used to those. But then, there was something else—breathing. I could hear it, low and heavy, just outside my door. It wasn’t human. It was too slow, too deep. I pressed myself against the headboard, clutching my flashlight like a weapon, even though I knew it wouldn’t help.

The breathing moved away after a while, but then came the scratching. It wasn’t at my door this time—it was coming from inside my room. I whipped the flashlight around, scanning the walls, the ceiling, but there was nothing. The scratching grew louder, closer, until it felt like it was coming from beneath my bed. My heart pounded in my chest, my throat dry with fear. I didn’t dare look under the bed. I was too scared of what I might find.

The scratching stopped abruptly, replaced by a soft, childlike giggle. The sound of it froze the blood in my veins. It wasn’t me. It wasn’t my parents. Something was in the room with me.

I backed up against the wall, holding the flashlight out in front of me like it could protect me from whatever was there. The giggling continued, soft and mocking. I whispered to myself, “It’s not real. It’s just a game.” But I didn’t believe it anymore.

Suddenly, there was a loud bang on the door. The whole room seemed to shake with the force of it. I dropped the flashlight, plunging myself into darkness. The breathing was back, but this time, it was right outside my door.

**Bang!**

Another hit. The door shuddered.

**Bang!**

The lock rattled. Whatever was out there was trying to get in.

I scrambled to pick up the flashlight, but my hands were shaking so badly I could barely hold it. The banging grew more violent, each hit sounding like the door was about to give in. And then, just as suddenly as it started, it stopped.

Silence. Pure, deafening silence.

I held my breath, waiting, listening for any sign of movement. Then, the voice returned, soft and sweet, like honey.

**“Ellie, it’s okay. You can come out now.”**

It was my mother’s voice again, but this time, I knew it wasn’t her. I didn’t answer. I didn’t move. I just sat there, frozen in fear, praying for the night to end.

The voice called out again, more insistent this time. **“Ellie, don’t be scared. It’s just a game.”**

My hands were trembling, and I could barely hold onto the flashlight. The voice kept calling, but I stayed silent. I knew the rules. I knew I couldn’t open the door. But then, something strange happened. The door... it began to unlock. I heard the soft click of the lock turning, and the handle slowly twisted.

“No,” I whispered, pressing myself further against the wall, willing the door to stay shut. But it was too late. The door creaked open, just a crack, but enough for me to see a shadow in the hallway, something tall and thin, its limbs too long, its fingers clawed.

It wasn’t my mother.

The creature stood in the doorway, unmoving, watching me. I could feel its eyes on me, even though I couldn’t see its face. My heart was pounding in my chest, and I felt like I might pass out.

And then, just as it stepped forward, the first rays of sunlight crept through the window. The creature recoiled, hissing like an animal, and within seconds, it was gone. The door slammed shut, and the house was quiet again.

I didn’t leave my room until the sun was fully up. When I finally opened the door, the house was just as it had been the night before—silent, empty, as if nothing had happened.

My parents were back, sitting at the kitchen table, drinking coffee like they always did. I stumbled in, shaken and pale, and told them everything—the creature, the scratching, the voice that wasn’t my mother’s. They just looked at me, exchanged glances, and then my dad laughed softly.

“You must have had a bad dream,” he said, shaking his head. “Nothing like that happened, Ellie. It was just your imagination.”

 My mom smiled that same strange smile and added, “You’re safe now. It’s over.”

 But I knew better. I knew it wasn’t just a dream. The fear, the things I’d heard and seen—they were real. They had to be. My parents didn’t believe me, they never did, and that was the most terrifying part.

 Now, as an adult with children of my own, I know the truth. Whatever haunted me in that house, whatever played that sick game, it’s still out there, waiting. And it’s hungry. I fear for the lives of my children. I’ll never let them go through what I went through. I’ll protect them at all costs, even if it means never celebrating Halloween, never letting the night touch them the way it touched me.

 Because I know, deep down, that it’s only a matter of time before the game starts again. *Halloween is coming*",9,1748136048.0,scarystories,0,0.92,False

It’s kind of like walking through a visual podcast meets museum meets outdoor installation. 15-foot portraits, short documentary films, and soundscapes featuring everyday Americans from all over the country telling their stories. Really moving, and surprisingly chill for Midtown.

It’s FREE and open all summer. I stumbled into it not knowing what to expect and left thinking about how diverse and messy and beautiful this country is and how we’re all more connected than we think.

Also, if you’re into photography, design, or public art in general, it’s definitely worth checking out. The scale alone is wild. Bring a friend, grab a coffee, take your time with it. They even encourage you to “add your voice” to the installation (more info on their site: [pathoflibertynyc.com](https://www.pathoflibertynyc.com/)).

Following this has been a helpful escape for me, I engage a lot in work that can be emotionally heavy. Publicly rich people who talk about their problems, esp when they relate to topics I care about: is a nice pause on real life. 

Its in my nature though, to try and find something good i can contribute to whatever I'm engaging with. 

Skeeves latest spiraling is getting attention to this sub: so me doing this is a cathartic exercise for how frustrating I find his actions. 

Say, youre not a rich person with a lot of support, but maybe Skeevens behavior is familiar to you? 


What are some things you can do? 

Documenting their behavior is important. Create an email or file: and just send all of your concerns there. Emails create helpful time stamps, you dont have to look at it all the time and everything you've emailed there will be present chronologically. 

Engage with what supports you can: 

Join a group like this one, but devoted to your specific concern. 
Domestic violence, blended family, addiction, digital spaces can still be incredibly helpful to you. They're a lot more common now than physical support groups.

Local to my area are services called Safe Path. They do work in rapid rehousing and protective support. Your local area may have a differently named program. If you aren't experiencing any DV, knowing the names of your local resources can be helpful to share to others. Its also helpful to know when or if those local services change or close. My community lost a lot of DV services in the last decade. 

If you've ever asked yourself with a partner: ""is this abuse?"" 

Consider talking to a trusted loved one about what you experienced and consider making a safety plan. The groups are helpful if you dont have a trusted loved one or safe friend. 

Consider looking at what are signs of DV escalation and if you've ever been strangled, please consider what that action can mean in escalation. 

There are helpful books like 
""Codependent no more"" and other works that may be best served under a therapists guide. Not everyone can access a therapist. Those dedicated online support groups can help with further recommendations.

If your phone gets checked by an abuser and you fear searching for things on your own devices: 
  Go out to grab coffee and make a pit stop at your local library! If you need to, use the excuse that you want to grab a book! Libraries offer great fiction reads as well as How To books you can check out. Pretend you want to take up knitting and want to see some knitting books before you buy them. Etc.


Most libraries offer guest passes for computer use without needing a card and many librarians are saints who will help you fill out applications for services or gain knowledge on what is offered to you locally. 

You can get a lot of better strategies online from specific support groups dedicated to your needs. But maybe youve never considered that before and ended up here. 

I've now noticed a lot of online groups even offer some kind of anonymous posting options too. I dont know much about it, but when you fear shame, knowing you dont have to tell your story with your name and face can help make you brave enough to reach out. 


Dont feel safe googling on your phone: the US national DV hotline is 
800-799-7233 
   If you can take a break at work or borrow a friends phone, that can be helpful to call. 


Temporary Protective Orders
Restraining Orders 
No-contact Orders

These are all different things, a support group or librarian can help you understand how these are different and the processes involved in recieving one. 

In my experience with No-Contact Orders, there is a 24 hr window where they annually expire. A friend of mine dealt with yearly abuse on that date before each annual hearing for it. My husband would attend court with her every year to help protect her from her abuser. 
  If you have a friend needing one of these orders, consider giving them that support. Consider asking trusted loved ones to support you for safety during that time. 

More support: 

Kait Grange on clock app lost her mom due to DV and trying to leave. She's been very open about her experiences with loss, grief, and abuse. She has some great content on moving forward with your life when a loved one is abusive. 

Know when your most at risk times are: include that in your safety plan. 

My husband and I dream of an entirely women lead service program so women escaping DV can have self-defense training that doesn't expose them to men. Our interim is that my husband specializes in self defense trainings and offers it locally to any woman who wants to have better personal safety. One thing our loved ones have expressed to us when escaping, is how any men in their vicinity were triggering and not safe. We built our own network of support. 

If youre passionate about DV or self defense in your area, consider starting up a group like ours. Ours is informal but we've helped women who want to learn safety measures beyond court orders. 

I work in animal rescue, tons of our dogs are familiar with abusers. If youre ever able, there might be a rescue dog who hates abusers as much as you do. I have adopted a dog who was previously abused horribly. She hates 95% of men on-sight. She adores my husband. She and I bond through our shared understanding of being traumatized. Seeing her heal and love, helped me a lot. If youre in a place where you can get a pet. A rescue dog may help rescue you too. 


I'm all for snark and I love to dunk on Skeeven. I just thought maybe with all of the eyes trained on him,  some of the folks behind them, might see their own partners or loved ones in his behavior and not know where to begin.

This is just a random collection of my thoughts, its not very well organized, and I'm super welcoming if anyone in the replies wants to add resources, tips, hotline numbers, or specific helps. 

If you want to share your story, I'll listen here too. 

My Moms first husband, before she got sober, nearly killed her by beating her almost to death. She got sober and finally left him after 10+yrs.
 [I was born after all of that to her 2nd husband.] She's been sober almost 38 yrs. Her drive to work in substance abuse and family counseling was in big part from her own trauma. 

Its because of her experience with DV and other sacred sisters who've come into my life, that I'm aware of what's available to me locally and got motivated to network in my area. 

There are more resources now than when my Mom left her ex in the early 80s. The internet has changed a lot, that said, plenty of folks experiencing a spiraling partner, may not know they're unsafe. 

If you were raised in an abusive environment, it can be easy to get into another one, because it feels like home. Things that feel like home, feel like they belong. This is what you deserve and this is what supposed to happen. 

If you've never had safety, how are you supposed to know what it looks like? 

This is why we need each other, need community, and these digital spaces are still really valuable. 

So I'm off my soapbox, sorry. 

Its okay with we dont do this here. This is somewhat-off-topic. 

But in case you never considered getting out, in case Stephens behavior feels familiar, in case you've ever wondered if you could get the strength to leave. 

On average it takes 7 tries to get out. It's okay if youre on try number 503,584,3595 

Its scary, its intense, but you are already doing something scary and intense. There can be hope. The other side can have safety and stability in it. 

With love, 
  -Hannah

I know it's simple to ask ""\*hey do you want to hang out sometime\*"" Or ""\* do you want to grab lunch sometime? \*"" or ""\* hey we should grab lunch sometime \*"", but I always feel like I'm asking someone out, when that is not my intention. I guess it's about tonality, but I just don't remember how to hang out with people. Normally I just let the people ask me, but this one time someone had said hey you should totally join us for karaoke, but I was awkward and said ""yyeeeahhhh maybeee"". I feel so bad. I feel like I sounded rude, and they were someone I wanted to hang out with, but I feel like I would be inviting myself to something that was mentioned more than half a year ago. I just feel so socially inept and am slightly beginning to sound desperate. 

Then once I do make a friend after a while, I'm not sure what to talk about. I don't keep up with the news or politics, I've asked already \* what have you been up to? How's your career? How's college? How's your love life? \* (Maybe I should leave off with )etc. I try not to complain or talk crap about people. During covid I was struggling with my mental health. I've gotten better since, but it's like when we go down memory lane I can't remember for the life of me what happened, even now I struggle a little. I mean I feel bad, but like what do people talk about?! How do I keep a conversation with people? I mainly overthink what to ask too. One of my friends will work on a project and I'll be ""oh cool! what's this for? How does it work?"" or even they'll talk about some job they got and I'll be like ""oh what do you do there?... oh interesting!"". If it's a grocery store job, I feel stupid asking that. One can figure, they stock shelves or are at the cash register. An internship, one can guess getting coffee or running errands. Or I feel stupid cause these are possible movie situations. I'm 20 years old, I should know that's not how it works, but I don't know what else to ask.

Even how often should I keep in contact with people? I mean we are all busy since most of my friends are in college, but also, I just know a lot of people and it gets tiring trying to contact everyone. 3 months I am in school, and I would like to work on school work, but once there is a moment where I can rest I'd like to just relax.
