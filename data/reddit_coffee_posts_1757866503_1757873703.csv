Heyoo Reddit 👋✨

So I figured I’d give this a shot because why not? Life’s way more fun when you’ve got cool people to chat with, right? 🥳 I’m basically on the lookout for someone  to laugh with, share random memes 🐸📸, rant about daily chaos 😅, and maybe even discover some common hobbies (or weird ones 👀).

About me:
	•	Certified introvert who sometimes pretends to be social 🦥
	•	Coffee addict ☕ + night owl 🌙 = questionable sleep schedule 🛌
	•	Love cooking 🍳, baking 🍪, and pretending my food looks like Pinterest pictures (spoiler: it does not 😂)
	•	Huge fan of long walks, especially when I can pretend I’m the main character in some dramatic indie film 🎶🌲
	•	Low-key gym rat 💪 but also 100% down for pizza at midnight 🍕✨

What I’m hoping for:
	•	Chill convos about literally anything 🛸
	•	Swapping music recs 🎧
	•	Gaming buddies? (I’m not great but I try 😅🎮)
	•	People who don’t mind my occasional “life update” voice notes that sound like podcast episodes 🎙️

1ngybii,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeleyca/comments/1ngybii/ive_tried_well_over_a_100_restaurants_around/,I've tried well over a 100 restaurants around Berkeley and this is my list (so far),"There is no telling whether my preferences will match yours, but the following is a list of restaurants good enough to MAKE me want to go back.

Best Food:

1. Brenda's - Cajun: A S.F. original location and their east bay expansion is in south Piedmont. Pricey but I think about them multiple times a year.

2. Butterfish Sushi: my O.G. best sushi was Kirala but my sister recently had a sub-par experience. Butterfish is fire but they have the prices to match sadly.

3. Cafe Jolie: OK. This one is on Alameda island so it's well outside, but their Spinach Eggs Benedict is on repeat for me. 

4. Cali Alley: a catering business had to pay the bills during the pandemic, so they turned their driveway into outdoor dining. I would call them international comfort food. Whoever runs that place CLEARLY went to culinary school because it's all bangers. Best burgers in Berkeley, probably the whole east bay.

5. Cha Ya Berkeley - japanese: OK, this one's for the Vegans and I'm lowering my bottom end just to get them on the list. That said, their chirashi bowl was delicious and meets the best moniker. Just make sure you don't order only fried/baked as that WILL BE too heavy.

6. Champion's Curry: It's apparently a Japanese regional style where the curry is in it's own dipping sauce bowl. Whatever, the curry here matches my preference exactly.

7. Cholita Linda: tacos that got it's original location in Temescal but they were so good, they opened a place in Berkeley.

8. Donut Farm: vegan donuts and it's GOOOOD. They only offer the dense donuts on the weekdays but then make the fluffy variety just for the weekend. 

9. Gangnam Jajang: Korean street food in Temescal. I am totally biased but their Jajang-myun matches my childhood memories of delivery Jajang-myun in South Korea back in 1983. You want old school, legit S.K. street food? THIS. IS. IT. Also, their Jjam-pyeong soup is probably their better dish. Literally umami in a bowl.

10. Great China: elevated chinese food with prices to match. Totally worth AT LEAST one trip. Do note that they still have the curse of all chinese food: the quality and taste always degrades quite quickly so definitely eat there instead of doing take out.

11. Gypsy's Trattoria Italiana: everything is good but the reason I go back over, and over, ... and over is because of their Godfather. The grade can waiver between A- to B+ though and it usually comes down to how busy they are and if the sauce thickens correctly. Discount if you use cash.

12. Heads and Tails BBQ: Texas BBQ with a slight California twist (as the owners likes to say). Don't worry, it's traditional and the brisket is to DIE FOR. They have NEVER compromised on the meats but I've noticed that their side dishes getting cheaper (and becoming lesser versions of themselves from the 1st couple of months they opened). It's a touch racket to be a BBQ place.

13. IKEA: swedish food. AND IT'S CHEAP! No seriously, go their and eat at their cafetaria. Definitely not some kind of fine dining but it's well made.

14. Ippuku: japanese izakaya. Berkeley has the lovely disctinction of having 4 izakaya's (one is even vegan) and none of them suck honestly. Love me some izakaya. Ippuku sadly is on the pricier end but worth at least one visit. Maybe for a birthday. Also, they have japanese whiskey you can't simply get a pour of anywhere else.

14. Joodooboo - korean cuisine in Oakland: a limited rotating menu at not completely unreasonable prices. this place beautifully riff's on korean food. Are you Korean? Do want to try something that feels like it belongs in a higher end korean restaurant pushing the boundaries past traditional dishes? this place.

15. Kinda Izakaya: I love me some izakayas. fantastic ambience. their chicken parts variety plate is straight up old school street food.

16. Kitava: gluten free and very vegan friendly. Up on Solano Avenue. Their Power Bowl (cringe name) is just delicious. Do add in the optional avocado though.

17. Marafuku Ramen: a quiet S.F. Japantown ramen place rode the ramen wave hitting the US a decade ago and was able to expand to a 2nd location in Temescal (and now beyond). This is Hakata style (Kyushu island) ramen, the home of the original Tonkotsu (apparently). EFFING delicious and really just my style. They very very occasionally miss the A grade I give them when the ramen feels a tad over salted.

18. Milyar Cafe: an explosion of middle eastern coffee shops have invaded the US. This is one of them. Honestly, I don't know a thing about their coffee but I'm here to talk about their in house french pastries, specifically, their matcha filled croissant. The messy drippy matcha is good but it's wrapped in hands down, the best croissant I HAVE EVER tasted. And I've eaten my share of croissant in Paris. I really hate giving this locals only joint away because if the rest of Berkeley finds out that a non-patisserie joint is beating the croissant pants off the multiple french bakeries in Berkeley, I'll never get to eat this glorious confection again.

19. Moobongri: korean cuisine. It's Temescal again. This place serves korean cuisine that is less often seen in other excellent korean joints. Blood sausages anyone? everything is good but I particularly like their acorn cold noodle soup. Light and refreshing and perfect for a hot summer meal.

20. Oh G Burger: burger restaurant Korean style. Holy hell is their bulgogi burger just fire. Order as is, no substitutions, because the overall package of flavors is just so on point.

21. Patisserie Rotha - french bakery in El Cerrito across from Sprouts. It's run by an English bloke. they open in the morning and then close when they run out of food. They close at 11am regardless. Since Milyar doesn't offer a plain buttery croissant or a chocolate croissant, or a almond past croissant, this is where you go for that. Literally straight out of Paris and obviously delicious. People still line up on the weekends.

22. Pizzeria Da Laura: a sit down pizza joint, with like an actual italian restaurant vibes. Fast food and pizza chain prices are no longer cheap and places like Da Laura can compete on prices because of that. Might as well eat pizza at a not-chain that tastes like it could be made in Milan Italy.

23. Pyeong Chang Tofu - korean cuisine that got it's start in Temescal but opened a joint on University. Really delicious and very traditional.
I'm about to raise controversy and bitch at the entire new generation of South Koreans: HOW DARE YOU ADD SUGAR to my banchan!!! You all lost your damn heads destroying traditional korean flavors by introducing sugar into korean food. I want my 1984 korean food back!
For the non koreans: Sugar was not commonly used in the past due to it's scarcity. Only the imperial palace would have had any amount to play around with. the working poor of Korea would not have used it in the past.

24. Sconehend Bakery and Restaurant: the best in house carbs. scones, pancakes, muffins, english muffins. ALL DELICIOUS! Interestingly, because of how good their english muffins are, I freeking LOVE their eggs benedict (substitute bacon for canadian, hollandaise on the side). Weekends only. the muffins actually elevates it just by existing.

25. Southside Station - vietnam style sandwhich shop. I've only had their top seller, fried chicken sandwich. No substutions. This is once again, a situation where the combination of ingredients makes this go next level. Because seriously, the fried chicken by itself is a nothing burger. So, don't bother ordering just fried chicken.

26. Standard Fare: a fancy sous chef worked at a fancy restaurant learning from a Michelin rated god and decided to open a casual restaurant ""for the people""TM. Just pick anything and enjoy.

27. Tane Vegan Izakaya: for the vegans and I don't think you will feel like you are compromising. a bit pricey though.

28. Tokyo Fish Market: cheapish bento to go fair that runs the gamut of Japanese food you can eat. One of them ""the locals"" know if you know places.

29. Zhangliang Malatang: chinese hot pot but you pick everything out of refrigerators and then choose a soup base (or stir fry) at the check out. If you know how to layer everything, you can self create a delicious meal.",1,1757873235.0,berkeleyca,0,1.0,False

However she is 15, finding herself and has EXTREMELY liberal views, whereas im somewhere in the middle (agree with some liberal, some conservative - think the extreme sides of either arguement is harmful). She's also extremely outspoken. She knows my views and she sometimes says things knowing it would insult me, but i understand everyone is entitled to their political and ethical stance and I respect her opinion so normally stay quiet (while understanding shes young). She will go out of her way to debate about things and refuses to see others views (for example, shes loudly atheist and when she was 14 she went to a bible weekend just so she could argue with the other 14 year olds about how God isn't real). My sister thought this was hilarious, I thought it was disrespectful.

My sister (her mom) has the same views and is also extremely outspoken. Today I called round for a cup of coffee and they started saying some pretty radical extreme liberal things but I stayed quiet as I didn't agree with what they were saying. Then I changed the subject and tried to speak about something else and my niece made a bit of a comment suggesting I was wrong in my views and started being a bit arguementitive and implying my character was flawed because of my opinion. Her arguement that she used wasnt actually factually correct so I tried to gently tell her this, and she continued to argue until she said a few things that weren't true on the subject to try to prove a point. I turned to her and said 'im dissapointed youre implying Im a bad person and also that you're telling lies to try prove it'. My sister went OFF on me saying how dare I saw im dissapointed in her daughter and to get out of her house.

I left and got a lengthy text about how it isnt my place to correct her daughter and i owe her daughter an apology. I explained her daughter had basically lied to make me look like a bad person, and if my sister would fact check what her daughter said she would realise I was justified in my dissapointment, and when she realises my niece lied she should have a conversation with her about how harmful lies can be. But my sister continued to bombard me with angry messages, saying my niece is only 15 and im bullying her and calling her a liar etc and saying its not my place to give her parenting advice. I said my niece is only 15 and shouldnt have even been argueing with an adult because its disrespectful, and my sister went CRAZY. Basically saying she'll never forgive me for calling her daughter disrespectful, saying shes proud of her daughter for standing up for the 'right causes' and now wants to cut me out of her life if i dont apologise for calling her daughter a liar and disrespectful.

Midland Costco is the only Costco I've ever been to, so I need to know if this is a company wide issue, or if my backwards corner of the world is just severely lacking human designers.. 

As you exit the check out lanes, you're immediately met with the waiting area for the food court.. double-wide carts in tow and on a busy, gods bless your ship if you bought whole bean coffee.. because the grinders are on the other side and there's 0 chance you're navigating through the chaos to grind your bulk discount beans.. 

The ordering kiosk creates a congested boarder between the check out, the waiting area, and the only way OUT of the store, so if there's a line, good luck getting through.. if you enter your order on the right side.. good luck maneuvering your Buick of bargains around that 4' space between the counter and the kiosk.. also 100% blocking that door that's probably not supposed to be blocked. 

So you're fortunately gifted with the bionic ears of a bat and you hear the employee mumble out your order, because there's no visual cue to tell you when your order is ready.. and.. remember the big-brain location of the coffee grinders?🤌 work flow perfection..  there's no tray in sight, so time to sprout a few extra arms to carry your collection of loose open food items and prepare to lay siege to the fountain of fine beverages. 

Said fountain area is littered with standing-height tables with no rhyme or reason, no one uses them, but may ALL the gods help you if they are in use because you won't be fitting your carriage of confections through any part of that area..

Perhaps you decide to make port before your carbonated quest ensues.. abandon your food on the dirty table, park your Pontiac of purchases in some other poor fool's way and hope that you don't need to fill more than 2 cups.. 

You fight your way up stream like the determined little salmon that you are, fill your stupid cup with idiot juice as you question all of your life choices that brought you to this moment.. grab your flimsy lids that crack as you put them on only to find that *this* string of lids require a straw.. what happened to the little flappy ones? WHO KNOWS!? Where are the straws? There are no straws.. why have straw-lids.. no STRAWS!? SWITCH OUT THE STUPID LID FOR THE *OTHER* FLIPPY TOP PRO-TURTLE-WHATEVER LIDS AND THROW THE OTHER PLASTIC LID IN THE TRASH, TO SAVE THE F-ING TURTLES.. I guess..

 (apparently there was a bucket-o-straws back on the service counter.. because.. that's where they should be? Why put them next to the drinks.. and lids.. in a store that historically doesn't even HAVE straws.. the people need answers..)

Bob and weave your way through all of the other poor souls, just out here on a Saturday, trying their best to get that dog in them.. get back to your sticky table with your hungry children, who have honestly, been SO well behaved during this ordeal.. they really earned that Stanley cup of ice cream that's too much for any sane person.. but there's no option for a smaller portion.. so I guess we'll just throw half of it away? 

And your 5 year old wants ketchup on her hotdog.. are there packets? OF COURSE NOT.. 

#B-TCH, THIS IS COSTCO# 

FIGHT YOUR WAY BACK INTO THE FRAY, LOOSE HOTDOG IN HAND AND AQUIRE THE SACRED SAUCE THAT YOUR CHILD SIMPLY CANNOT CONSUME THEIR SAUSAGE OF THE DIVINE WITHOUT.. and you better not need more than one, because the condiment pump requires two hands..

Costco.. why are you like this? Sam's has their shit together.. Sam's has a traffic flow.. Sam's has tubes of Lysol wipes on the tables.. Sam's loves us, why don't you?

Hey there! I've never been the best at these but if I'm calling myself a writer, I can't exactly back down from this!

I'm a 29 year old artist, writer, avid hiker, and current masters student for Higher Education Leadership; my end game is to be some sort of executive type at a university and go to WAR for my educators and students against the awful, anti-intellectualism nonsense going on right now, ensuring they get what they need and my school fricking rocks. I want to write and make good art that encourages people to engage with their lives and their imaginations.

I also very much want to find the black cat to my golden retriever! I managed to get through all of my twenties without that, but now I think I want to build a life with someone that we can grow in and make our own. Tell me about your dreams, your hopes, what you dislike and like; what's your favorite meal? I'll bet you I can learn how to make it exactly the way you like (but if it's like, fugu, maybe I shouldn't? Don't ask the nuerospicy, untrained home cook to prepare the tetrodotoxin)

I can't guess what anyone's dynamic would be like, so I'll just list off some of the things that get me up in the morning : Coffee -- okay that's it. For things I like, writing, anime and animations, Pokemon, art, museums, aquariums, martial arts, hiking and strength training, being crafty and DIYs, new and good food, cooking, music (I've been enjoying metal lately, but also lofi - I contain multitudes) cultures from the world over, trail running (haven't been in forever) and being near the water. There's definitely more but, you've got things to do, I'll tell you about the rest as it comes up or over that boba I lured you in with.

That's it for now methinks <3 Thanks for reading and, I hope we get to chat soon!

My last relationship was two years ago and since then, I've been out of the dating scene due to my career, a period of depression, and fear of another messy breakup. I don't have much social media either, and being a workaholic and natural homebody, I'm not really going to bars or trying to meet people. 

Ive come to the conclusion that I need to get myself out there and try this again. Dating apps suck and I'm really looking for real companionship and love. 

Some stuff about me: I'm 32, white, 5'8"", long dark curly hair, dark blue eyes and wear glasses. I take care of myself and have impeccable hygiene. I work out four times a week and keep myself in really good shape. Been told by many that I'm handsome or hot by friends/coworkers both men and women. STI free and looking for the same. Personality wise, I'm pretty quiet and reserved, with some nerdy interests and topics I can blab about under the right circumstances. You can imagine why dating apps don't work for me...

I work in Manhattan for a well known tech company and currently live in Suffolk County. Well off financially and also financially savvy. I trade stocks often and have made a healthy nestegg for myself. I live on my own in a condo.

Hobbies wise I'm into a lot to keep busy. I'm a tech nerd and like to build computers and play PC games. I love RPGs, FPS games, some moba stuff (recently got into Deadlock) and others. I love vintage electronics, especially stereo equipment and old computers. I am also a big music fan who listens to just about everything (rap, r&b, rock, metal, classics, some jazz). I repair electronics as a hobby and enjoy restoring equipment when I can. I love to cook, absolutely love making myself meal prep, and would love to cook you a delicious meal for a date night. I'm also an avid reader, I love sci-fi, some fantasy and non fiction. Currently collecting tons of books and vinyl records. Big on thrifting in general. Estate sales in the Hamptons can have hidden gems.

I'm looking for the following:

25-35, Woman, height/weight proportional (sorry, not into bigger women), physically active. A career or successful business and financially independent. Beautiful in your own way and confident to offset my shyness is a huge plus. Located in the City or Long Island. Looking for someone to grow with or trying for long term. Some similar interests and hobbies would be great,  but I'm happy with chill vibes on the couch, watching a TV or movie while cuddling or making out when we can see each other... Dinner and Movie Dates are lovely as well.

Send me a chat here if you're interested. Happy to arrange a date or to grab coffee before taking anything further.",1,1757872663.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

Testing out the Starbucks Sumatra K-Cup Coffee pods has been like a fun little journey through my morning routine, giving it a much-needed flavor upgrade. These pods promise bold, full-bodied coffee, and I’ve gone through nearly all sixty in the box to make sure I wasn’t imagining the quality. It's 100% Arabica, and considering I’ve sampled plenty of single-serve coffee capsules, I have lots to say about how it stacks up.

**Flavor that Wakes You Up Properly**

The robust flavor of this Indonesian single-origin coffee truly stands out. Rich herbal notes and that rustic spice feel like a morning hug that slaps you awake at the same time. There's a muted acidity that makes the Starbucks Sumatra K-Cups nothing like the sour, overly tangy options I occasionally dread. Having sipped it black, added a splash of cream, and even tried sweetened versions, the coffee morphs beautifully depending on your choice of tweaks. Honestly, it feels like it adapts to your vibe for the day.

**Design That Makes Brewing Easy**

Single-serve pods are supposed to be simple, and here this product doesn’t disappoint. Compatible with Keurig brewers, these pods work flawlessly without any blockage or misalignment (yes, I’ve had that issue with off-brand pods before). Each pod ensures not only consistency in flavor but keeps the brewing process hassle-free, something I’m incredibly grateful for during groggy mornings.

[Check Starbucks Sumatra K-Cup Coffee Pods price on Amazon.](https://vendm.com/p/b00u3odvue/)

**Strengths**

- Perfect for those who love rich and bold flavors without being overpowering.  
- Single-origin quality enhances the distinctive taste.  
- Versatile enough for black coffee fans and those who enjoy customized coffee with cream or added flavors.  
- Ethically sourced, which is a huge plus for anyone environmentally-conscious.  

**Weaknesses**

- Not the best choice for someone who prefers milder coffee.  
- The price, while not exorbitant, could be a tad higher than some other pods that have a comparable taste.  

**Peer Products**

When it comes to competition, there are plenty of rival brands vying for attention within the single-serve coffee pod market. Green Mountain Coffee Pods often present a decent variation of medium roasts but fall short in matching the body and boldness of Sumatra pods. Dunkin’ Original Blend is another competitor, offering lighter but consistent flavors, which again, feels a little lackluster compared to the richness you get here. If you’re after something darker, Peet’s Coffee Pods offer strong blends, but they lack the finesse of herbal and spicy notes I’ve come to enjoy in Sumatra. It really comes down to what flavor palette you’re after and your loyalty to a particular brand.

**Bang for the Buck**

In terms of value, this product lies slightly on the pricier side for single-serve pods, but the payoff is in taste and consistency. There’s something special about getting what feels like a café-grade experience at home within seconds. If you think about the money you’d otherwise spend on Starbucks café runs, these pods begin to redeem themselves as an investment. The ethically sourced factor adds emotional value, especially for those who are mindful of where their coffee comes from.

So about four years ago, my spouse and I loved from a very metropolitan area to aforementioned small town. This small town has a creative organization that has been around for decades at this point. I've been really enthused to get involved and have tried, at every turn, to show up to events, apply for things, give ideas and feedback. I finally got onto the board of directors and I thought that was a really great step in the right direction except it doesn't seem to be doing me much good. 

Nobody in this company seems interested in progress. Every unclaimed task I have volunteered for, I have been led on or ghosted entirely. It feels really bad and disheartening. I really really want this organization to succeed and to be a shining jewel of our (being honest) kind of shitty town. To use this to bring some culture and enthusiasm in, you know? 

Well, recently, they did an open call for a project and I went, but I barely got a chance to speak or showcase the skills I have (which I know sounds cocky, but I mostly just mean I didn't really get the same chance as most of the other people there to be fairly evaluated). The lack of organization of this event was frustrating, and led to me being included in this project in a very ""get the donuts and coffee"" sort of way. (I'm sorry, I know this is WILDLY vague but again, small towns) I'm really disappointed and this feels unfair, but here's where the asshole question comes in.

I was expressing my frustration to my spouse about the situation, and how I feel like maybe I should just tell them I'd like to run my own project in the spring and see what they say and they told me I was being pretentious, pushy and socially inept. They said that if they were running a company and someone with no experience said they wanted to run a project, the answer would be not just no, but ""Hell no"". 

And yes, it's true that my experience in the performative part of this field is small but not *nonexistent*, and it's a volunteer organization anyway, not like I'm getting paid Project Manager salaries, here. I told Spouse that I'm not trying to be pushy, I just desperately want to help and be included and feel like I'm being ghosted or ignored in favor of people that have been there longer. 

I'm going to be bowing out of the coffee-getter role with a gracious thank you and assurance that I'd still like to help with the other parts of the project I already volunteered for (things I actually do have *extensive* experience at such as design), but my spouse's words really bother me. But the hangup is that now I'm wondering if I really am a pushy pain in the ass and maybe that's why they've been ghosting me or ignoring my ideas or volunteering for things.

Hey r/pico8! Horizon Glide is finally released and playable at [https://bonnie-games.itch.io/](https://bonnie-games.itch.io/)

I posted about this game's development a [couple times](https://www.reddit.com/r/pico8/comments/1mxyjx5/update_horizon_glide_implemented_your_feedback/). You all gave such amazing feedback and I was planning to implement more of it, but I'll be honest I got completely distracted building [my own PICO-8 style engine in Love2D](https://www.reddit.com/r/pico8/comments/1n4vkfv/making_a_pico8_style_engine_in_love2d/) which I also hope to release soon. Between that and my full-time job, I decided to release Horizon Glide as-is rather than let it sit forever!

**The game:**  
An infinite isometric arcade shooter where you pilot a hover-ship through procedurally generated landscapes. Every run is unique with dynamic terrain ranging from water to mountain peaks, and enemy AI ships to battle.

**Controls are simple:**

* Arrow keys to move
* X to shoot

I squeezed this into a single PICO-8 cart (wanted it on SPLORE) which meant some serious token optimization. I've got about 100 tokens left, so future updates will be... creative.

Once my Love2D engine is ready, I'm planning to port Horizon Glide and my first game Cortex Override over and add all those features I had to cut due to token limits.

Would love to hear what you think if you give it a try. And if you're interested, my first game Cortex Override is also available for free. Like my first game, the source code is on GitHub: [https://github.com/EBonura/HorizonGlide](https://github.com/EBonura/HorizonGlide)

Heyoo Reddit 👋✨

So I figured I’d give this a shot because why not? Life’s way more fun when you’ve got cool people to chat with, right? 🥳 I’m basically on the lookout for someone  to laugh with, share random memes 🐸📸, rant about daily chaos 😅, and maybe even discover some common hobbies (or weird ones 👀).

About me:
	•	Certified introvert who sometimes pretends to be social 🦥
	•	Coffee addict ☕ + night owl 🌙 = questionable sleep schedule 🛌
	•	Love cooking 🍳, baking 🍪, and pretending my food looks like Pinterest pictures (spoiler: it does not 😂)
	•	Huge fan of long walks, especially when I can pretend I’m the main character in some dramatic indie film 🎶🌲
	•	Low-key gym rat 💪 but also 100% down for pizza at midnight 🍕✨

What I’m hoping for:
	•	Chill convos about literally anything 🛸
	•	Swapping music recs 🎧
	•	Gaming buddies? (I’m not great but I try 😅🎮)
	•	People who don’t mind my occasional “life update” voice notes that sound like podcast episodes 🎙️

If you’re the type of person who sends way too many emojis 🙋‍♀️, loves random deep talks at 2 AM 🌌, or just wants a new pal to share memes with… hit me up! 💌

Anyway, if you’ve made it this far, congrats 🏆 you now know more about me than half the people in my real life 😂 Let’s be friends? 💜",2,1757871857.0,makingfriends,0,1.0,False
1ngxov7,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1ngxov7/gone/,Gone,"“Impossible!” Fleet Commander Nerl gouged a deep groove in the conference table with his rending claw.

“Commander, I would have to say that while it is highly improbable, the evidence is against impossibility.” Political Advisor Grun laid her far larger rending claw on the commander’s shoulder. “It is up to the fleet to figure out where they’ve gone, while you determine the fleet’s response.”

“But the entire forest … gone … disappeared in the time we spent in transit from the realspace translation.” Nerl swung his tail across the bench and dropped to sit with a heavy thump. Grun’s claw maintained its position through the move.

The intimacy of her claw so near his throat, and the way she now stood over his slumped figure reminded him who was in charge. She clicked a small device and the view on the wall-sized screen changed into a split view.

On one side, a lush forest with a few well-maintained roads, and an uncountable mass of biological material, living plants and creatures, and the enemy, hiding like animals in the trees. The other side showed the same area of the moon, but there was nothing but a scar cut deep into the land, exposing the bedrock that had been far beneath the soil of the forest.

Everything above the bedrock was gone. Not a speck of biological material was left behind in the boundaries of the former forest.

“Remind me, Commander, what were the fleet’s orders for this expedition?”

“Are you testing me, Advisor?” Nerl sighed. “Eliminate all traces of the enemy from the inhabited body orbiting the system’s lone gas giant planet. If possible, bring back live samples and any interesting technology.”

“It would seem that the enemy has achieved the minimum goal for you already,” she said with a laugh.

“Now I _know_ you’re testing me,” he said. “You know as well as I that ‘if possible’ means as long as I draw breath, that needs to be my goal.”

Grun clicked the device again and the _before_ view switched to a series of images from all over the moon. Everywhere there had been a settlement of the enemy had been gouged out to bedrock. What had been agricultural fields were stripped as well.

She brushed the scales of his cheek with the back of her rending claw. “Tell me, Commander, how would you accomplish the same results?”

Nerl sat up a little straighter. “I can think of only two methods. One ridiculous, and the other — wholly unrealistic — relies on tech that doesn’t exist.”

“Humor me,” Grun said with a purr. “Start with the more realistic one.”

“When they transformed the moon to make it habitable, they began by placing lifting plates on the bedrock. Then, once they brought in soil and water and atmosphere, and so on, they built only above the lifters. When we entered the system, the lifters raised in groups, to be picked up in atmosphere by some sort of transport.”

Having said it, Nerl blinked in annoyance. “It sounds even more ridiculous when spoken.”

“No, no. It’s fine, dear Commander.” Grun walked around the room, her tail swaying in lazy arcs. “What was the unrealistic one?”

“Teleportation.” He huffed at the thought. “Some sort of magic technology that allows moving matter from one place to another through some dimension outside the spacetime we understand.”

“Both excellent ideas, Commander.” Grun stood before the changing images on the wall screen as though studying them. “While the lifters sound more plausible, I rather like the teleportation angle. Imagine what the queendom could do with that.”

“Even with that,” Nerl said, “they would need to have transported it all out of the system somehow.”

“Well, once you figure out where they might have gone,” Grun said, as she approached and lifted Nerl’s chin with the tip of her rending claw, “we can go get our samples.”

“Yes, Advisor.” The proximity alarm sounded, and he spun toward the door, leaving a shallow cut along the bottom of his chin from her sharpened claw. He tapped the control panel near the door as blood welled along the cut. “Report!”

“Commander, lone enemy vessel sighted around far side of the gas giant, heavy transport. We have a warp trace from there,” the First Officer said over the comms. “Eighteen possible routes.”

“How long to narrow it down?”

“Hard to say, Commander. It could take as long as—”

“Never mind,” he interrupted. “It’s one ship, we are a fleet. Divide us up and make haste for all eighteen possible throughpoints. Don’t forget, we want some of them alive.”

“Yes, Commander.”

Grun ran her thumb along the cut on his chin, collecting the blood. She licked it off and made a noise as if savoring it. “Don’t make me regret the queen’s decision to give some males command roles.”

“You know I won’t, Advisor,” he said as the flagship transited into warpspace.

As the last ship warped out of the system, Sena let out the breath she hadn’t been aware of holding. “I can’t believe that worked.”

“We’ll keep the jamming running for a few more hours, just to be certain.” Tris shoved her hands into the pockets of her jumpsuit. “I just hope the crew on the Honeypot are going to be okay.”

Sena typed a command and scanned the results on the monitor. “The fleet left in eighteen different directions.”

“Gives them better odds, I guess.”

Sena laughed. “The Valkor Queendom has been trying to take humans alive for the entirety of the war. I kind of feel bad for the ship that tries to board the Honeypot.”

“Yeah, yeah. Dumb lizards versus a cargo ship full of Marines. Still ….”

“You’re worried about your brother.” Sena patted Tris’ leg. “He’s going to be fine.”

“It’s just feels different when it’s a war fleet rather than some pirates.”

“That’s what we’re trained for.” Sena raised the sleeve of her tee-shirt to show her Marines tattoo. “He’s a good kid, and a good Marine, he’ll be fine.”

Sena looked out the window at the fields that lay between the outpost and the forest. Hectares of specifically engineered crops for survival on low-gravity and low-light worlds like this moon. The forest beyond was populated with animals, plants, bacteria, and fungus also engineered for the environment.

“What started this stupid war, anyway?” she asked. “Weren’t we doing an expanded trade deal with Valkor just a couple years ago?”

“You don’t watch the news, do you?” Tris huffed. “Queen Gret died, Furg took over as the new queen. First thing she did was update the official religion, declaring all ‘warm bloods’ as evil. Second thing she did was declared war on all of the endothermic species. Humans just happened to be the closest.”

“They won’t survive without a regime change,” Sena said.

“How so?”

“If a coup or assassination doesn’t take out the queen, the war will wear them down until their entire economy and society collapses.”

Tris hummed. “Yeah, we’re way too good at wars of attrition.”

“Not just that,” Sena said. “They didn’t bother to look with their own eyes. They trust so much in their over-engineered, hyper-complex technology that they couldn’t bother to look down and see that their scanners were showing them a fake image.”

“What did it look like?”

Sena called up the model that had been fed to the Valkor ships. “This.”

“Those are the cutaway views that were generated for the geologic survey, aren’t they?”

“Exactly. Just without the infrastructure overlays.”

The women discussed it over coffee as they waited for an update from the Honeypot.

1ngxnq7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/1ngxnq7/have_one_zen_practice_in_your_life/,Have one Zen practice in your life.,"In these information flooded times it’s crucial to have a counter and balance it all.

Don’t get me wrong. I love media. I love the ability of our times for millions of people to share a learning they made on a day and share it with other millions of people immediately. How beautiful is this opportunity for collective education?

But there can be too much of anything. And the easiest way to counter it is by having a Zen practice in your life.

What is Zen?
Zen is a school of Mahayana Buddhism that emphasizes meditation, mindfulness, and direct experiential insight over theoretical knowledge or ritual. You probably have come across pictures of Japan with very structured minimalist gardens - that‘s Zen. The beautiful thing about Zen is that anything can become a meditation. You don’t have to sit down for 1 min in the lotus posture and „meditate“. Meditating like that would already be advanced because it is a new additional practice. Instead, choose an activity you’re doing every day anyway and make that activity a meditation. Doing the dishes every day - why not make it a meditation? No music, no podcast, nothing.

Just you and the doing.

How do you practice Zen?
I personally started my Zen practice recently by making coffee with a martor and pestle. In the course of minimalism I threw away three broken electric grinders to one immortal stainless steel mortar and pestle that’s going to serve me for the rest of my life. Now in the morning grinding my coffee with the mortar has become my Zen practice, this beautiful stillness and the coffee becomes even more of a highlight because I had to grind the beans myself.

This is actually why the Japanese are amazing craftsman because they make anything a meditation, making tea, martial arts, including work and making high quality cars.

Now imagine how this could compound in your life. If you make just one activity in your daily life a meditation it will not just make you better at that one activity, but you will become more focused in all other activities as well.",2,1757871712.0,Meditation,0,0.75,False
1ngxn01,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1ngxn01/notes_from_the_lab/,Notes from the lab,"**Subject:** I’m a 57 year old OG r/stopdrinking dude, came up back when SD pope u/franks2000inchTV was active here (I actually came up with the idea of our sunrise enjoying, coffee-drinking mascot). I’ve been around long enough to have known better. But the lab beckoned. My life was going so spectacularly that it was apparently time to run an experiment and see if drinking would be different.  
  
**Experiments:** Just a beer, just a couple of beers, wine with dinner, wine with the snacks, seltzers to control weight, vodka to control it better, Irish whiskey in coffee or a couple of breakfast beers as needed, pre-gaming, post-gaming, etc. 

**Variations:** with wife, with friends, alone, alone, alone… 

**Lab notes:** Alcohol at 57 is not at all what I remember from my teens. Long gone are the hours of riding a perfect buzz and chilling with friends. The difference between feeling nothing, feeling ok and feeling anxious and getting a headache is razor thin now. It’s either an unsatisfying drunk or an anxious semi-buzz. I could still give it up for several days at a time but the cycles kept getting worse. At a certain point I felt like I was a drowning man only allowed to keep my head out of water long enough to gasp for air and have it pushed back down. 

**Results:** Over the course of 2 years, 40 pounds gained, worried wife, less than spectacular work performance, having to have talk with my kids about what I I’m going through. I used to be proud of my marriage, proud of who I was as a father, proud of my work, proud of my fitness - I used to like who I was. Two short years later (and a lifetime) and I just loathe myself. Sure, there were some funnish times - my two older daughters are of drinking age and it was kind of fun to hangout with them on a ski trip. But the next day of skiing wasn’t quite so fun. And it pains me to think what my teenage son has picked up from all of this, lots of talks ahead. 

**Results:** I like who I am better when sober - alcohol took away way more than it ever offered throughout this experiment. It seems to change as you age, or maybe the more times you run the experiment. In any case, it’s not worth it - started getting my life back this week. I'm so grateful that that no matter what else happens in my life, this community is always there, an anchor in the storm.

I dropped a laptop off at my local Best Buy for a Geek Squad appraisal and repair, as one of my fans had stopped working (according I got when booting up the computer). I paid for the initial assessment/repair of the computer when I dropped it off.

I receive no update from the store, so I called the 1(800) number after being on hold with the store for a half hour. The phone rep said it had been fixed, and there was no additional charge. 

I went to the store, and was told the laptop is a tick time boob: I was told the CPU, GPU, and RAM are all failing and would need to be replaced, costing thousands. I refused the repair and went home.

I just booted it up and wiped it, with the intention of unloading it for parts on EBay, given the death sentence GeekSquad gave it. It wasn’t making a clicking noise upon rebooting it (which is why I brought it in for repair). I downloaded HWINFO and ran scans while the computer was downloading a Steam game. Right now… I can’t find anything wrong with it! Everything seems normal according to all scans! I have attached screenshots!

1ngxkv8,https://www.reddit.com/r/clat/comments/1ngxkv8/caffiene_guide_extra_tips/,Caffiene Guide + Extra Tips," Ik its high time now and we've started to loose sleep. Everybody is getting serious now and want to be on their  A game for the next 3 months. Saw 1-2 posts about coffee recently wanted to add to that.

Disclaimer: I am NOT a doctor etc, im just sharing my personal experience. 

Who am I? >!Brian Moser.!<

Jokes apart im the guy if you wanna know about caffiene, Ive been drinking black coffee for 4 years, been taking pre workouts for 2 years, have tried all kinds of caffiene products from capsule to flavoured pouches along with a shitload of nootropics.

# What to take?

If you have never had coffee regularly, and feel tired, unattentive, you might want to start drinking coffee, trust me itll change your life.

If you are a regular coffee drinker, and the coffee isnt hitting the same anymore, switch to black coffee, no sugar no milk, just water and instant coffee. Youll find coffee  recs at the bottom of this post.

We're entering dangerous territory here, but If you've been drinking black coffee for a while, and built up tolerance, you CAN try caffeine annhydrous.

Im not saying you should, but if you have the need to stay awake and alert, and coffee isnt doing it for, its better to take caffeine than get explosive diarrhea after drinking 5 cups of black coffee.

# FAQs on Caffeine.

***Will it give me a heart attack?*** 

NOPE. Unless your an unborn child, or consume an extreme dose, caffeine is perfectly fine.

***What should be my daily intake?***

Depends, i recommend you start with 100 mgs, this is the sweet spot where you feel the effect without the jitters and crashes. But if you have a tolerance, 200-300mg is fine. I dont recommend 400mgs, if you're taking it, split it into 2x200mg atleast 6 hours apart.

***What form of caffeine should i take?***

You have a lot of options, pre workout, which i dont recommend, because they have additional stimulants, and stuff like beta alanine which will make your skin tingle. 

Caffeine anhydrous powder or capsules are you main options, i would go with capsules anyday because its easy to mess up the quantity when you take as powder, the scoops for 200mg doses are really tiny so its easy to put too much or too little in.

(have mentioned the product/ brand recommendations in the end)

***What time should i take my Caffiene?***

It depends on you honestly, i dont recommend taking it within the first 2 hours of waking up as it messes up your natural ability to stay awake. Also, dont take it after 5 hours from the time you go to sleep. NO CAFFEINE IN THE EVENING. Even after you start feeling sleepy, it stays in your system and fucks your sleep quality up, you'll wake up in the morning feeling like you've been hit by a truck.

***Should i take modafinil?***

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! stay away from modafinil or any other nootropic, that shit works for some people but for everybody else its just a headache and nausea machine. I cant tell you how bad that one week i was on modalert went. DONT DO IT.

# EXTRA TIPS!!

If you're a dropper, schedule your day such that you finish your studies by the evening, wake up early and do 2 block of 3 hours each. Itll get you free by early evening and you'll have a quarter of a day to yourself. 

Ik the pomodoro doromomo techniques sound good but you have to make it a habit to lock in for an hour straight atleast, these 25/5 sets wont get you anywhere in clat.

If at all you HAVE to take caffeine in the evening, you should try melatonin to fix your sleep. 

Feel free to drop your personal experiences/ questions here. Also DM if you want a review of a product you're planning to buy because if it has caffeine in it, ive probably tried it.

Hope your sleep stays blessed .

1ngxktv,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ngxktv/i_ftm_21_am_developing_feelings_for_my_friend_m/,I (FTM 21) am developing feelings for my friend (M 22) and don't know what to do. Advice?,"I am 21 (FTM, he/they), currently an international student in a queer-friendly country, and I just started masculinizing HRT 3 months ago. I have a tight friend group who share same cultural background with me, with whom we became friends in March this year. We have been hanging out and drinking every week for the past few months and have all gotten very close. They all support my identity and I feel safe around them, and we have no conflicts in our worldviews. 

Among them, there is one person who I've always felt especially drawn to since we've met. We have a lot of common interests, similar past experiences, and share political views. I also find them incredibly attractive and interesting, and want to be around them whenever I get a chance. So far, I have made no indication that i am experiencing any romantical interest in them, I am not normally touchy or expressive towards anybody, but I can't stop thinking about this person.

Very recently (on 11/09/2025) something pretty dramatic happened \[TW: transphobia, self-harm\]: >!we went to a KBBQ and the staff tried to kick me out for being trans while I was with my friends. They alleged being unable to verify my ID as it has my old photo that looks more feminine than I look now, and it ruined the evening for everybody. It sent me into a horrible spiral and I attempted to end my life on that same night right after we disbanded after getting drunk. I did not suffer serious physical damage, and!< I am safe now.

The next day we all went out drinking again and by pure luck I had some time alone with this person, and told them about my experience after that night in full truth. I did not just dump it, I asked if they were willing to listen, and they agreed, but I still regret it. I feel like it is unfair of me to share my feelings with anyone, because I don't want to be even more of a burden and a sore sight. But I also felt incredibly unwell mentally and in that in the whole world they were the only person I could open up to. 

They reacted very supportively and shared with me some of their struggles, and I felt very appreciative. They even invited me to go out for coffee and conversation, just the two of us, we went today and talked comfortably, sober, for a few hours. But I really struggle to understand if this is all just platonic care and affirmation of my gender, or if my pull towards them is being reciprocated.

This person is very hard to read, their sexuality is ambiguous, and if it's a bro thing, is it freaking normal to invite a bro for coffee like that? I have no idea what they think about me now. I feel confused and being on HRT is also making my feelings harder to cope with. I am feeling especially shitty because of trauma dumping, and because I feel gross in my skin and unlovable as a trans person. I am overall very bad at opening up emotionally and I don't want to ruin the dynamic between us or in our friend group by making wrong choices. **Any advice on what the best way to proceed could be?**

This happened to me before, I had crushes on close friends but never pursued them because I feared I could not never meet anybody's needs or make them happy. Now I feel again like I should just suppress my feelings towards this person until they are gone. Please note that I do not have any resources to get professional help or a support network in this country to work on my mental health. Other than that, I **would highly appreciate any experiences or genuine advice you can share on what I should do in this relationship.** Sorry for a long post and thank you for reading.

**TLDR:** I'm a 21-year-old FTM international student, started HRT 3 months ago. I have a close friend group, and I think I am developing romantic feelings for one of them. After a recent mental health crisis, I opened up to that person, and they responded with care and support. Now I’m confused if it’s just platonic or something more, but also feel guilty for trauma dumping and unlovable as I am.

My wife got there right at 5pm and there were a few people in line and a few came in right after her. There is no way at this moment to order ahead, so she ordered and waited about 20-25min. There’s a bar and coffee shop in the same building, so a pretty easy place to wait.

We ordered the pepperoni and added green peppers and onions. After tip, it was 38 bucks. Pretty expensive. 

My wife was home with the pizza in 5min, so we jumped right in. I thought the flavor of the sauce and dough was excellent. Toppings were fresh. Our biggest issue was the pizza was undercooked in the middle. I know they are known for their crispy crust, but the center was a little soggy. Maybe it was because it was busy or they are working through some opening kinks, but that was a bummer for me.

Overall, I want to give them a few weeks and try it again. Hopefully it will be crispy as advertised next time.

He brings up Cody in his arms and places him on the cement. He’s limp, lifeless. So my spouse, who’s a doctor tries to resuscitate. I tell him to stop that everything is ok.

I wrap Cody Boy up in a towel on the kitchen table, and we both cry for ten minutes. Within an hour, we left the little guy at a pet crematorium.

Cody was 17 and was declining in health. He often vomited from ulcers. He was old. We knew this day was coming. 

But we lied to her sister, who was very close to Cody. We said he vomited blood then died. We didn’t mention the pool.

Plastic has become so common in our daily lives that it feels almost impossible to avoid. 

From the packaging around our food to the bags we carry home, it’s everywhere. 

But here’s the truth: plastic waste is piling up at alarming rates, harming wildlife, polluting oceans, and even working its way into our food chain. 

We can make a big difference with small, practical changes. 

If you’ve been looking for simple ways to reduce plastic waste, this guide will give you 12 powerful, everyday habits that can cut down your plastic footprint without making your life harder.

This isn’t about being perfect. It’s about making conscious choices that, when added up, create lasting impact. 

Let’s dive into real-world, actionable strategies that will help you live a greener, more sustainable lifestyle—starting today.

# 1)) Switch to Reusable Shopping Bags

We’ve all grabbed a plastic bag at the grocery store without thinking twice. But those bags often end up in landfills or worse—floating in oceans. 

By replacing single-use plastic bags with sturdy reusable ones, you’ll cut a significant chunk of plastic from your daily routine.

**Why it matters:** Plastic bags take hundreds of years to break down, and they’re one of the most common types of litter worldwide. Carrying your own reusable bag is one of the simplest ways to reduce plastic waste instantly.

**Tips to make it work:**

* Keep foldable bags in your car, backpack, or purse so you’re never caught off guard.
* Choose durable cloth, canvas, or recycled material bags that can handle heavy groceries.
* Wash your bags regularly to keep them clean and fresh.

**Example:** If you shop twice a week and use 5 bags per trip, switching to reusables can keep over 500 plastic bags out of circulation every year.

# 2)) Ditch Plastic Water Bottles

Bottled water is one of the biggest culprits of plastic pollution. Not only do plastic bottles use precious fossil fuels to produce, but most never get recycled. 

Choosing a refillable water bottle is one of the easiest eco-friendly swaps you can make.

**Why it matters:** It’s estimated that a million plastic bottles are purchased every minute worldwide, and many end up polluting waterways. A reusable bottle can last for years.

**Best practices:**

* Invest in a high-quality stainless steel or glass bottle.
* Use an at-home water filter if you’re worried about tap water quality.
* Carry your bottle with you everywhere—work, gym, errands.

**Hack:** Keep a spare reusable bottle in your car or office so you don’t fall back into the bottled water habit.

# 3)) Say No to Plastic Straws

Plastic straws are small, but they add up quickly. Millions are used and discarded daily, and because they’re lightweight, they often escape waste systems and end up in oceans, where they harm marine life.

**Why it matters:** Straws are rarely recycled due to their size and flexibility, making them one of the most unnecessary sources of plastic waste.

**Simple alternatives:**

* Stainless steel, glass, or bamboo straws for home use.
* Silicone straws for kids or people who prefer softer textures.
* Skip the straw entirely when ordering drinks at restaurants.

**Checklist to make it stick:**

* Say “no straw, please” when ordering out.
* Carry a reusable straw if you prefer one.
* Support cafes and restaurants that have already made the switch to eco-friendly straws.

# 4)) Opt for Bulk Shopping

Individually packaged snacks and single-use containers may be convenient, but they generate enormous amounts of unnecessary plastic waste. 

Shopping in bulk and using your own containers is a smart way to cut it down.

**Why it matters:** Bulk sections reduce packaging waste, save you money, and often allow you to buy just the right amount, cutting down on food waste too.

**Tips for bulk shopping success:**

* Bring your own jars, cloth bags, or stainless steel containers.
* Label your containers with their empty weight (the tare) to make checkout easier.
* Start small by buying staples like rice, pasta, nuts, or oats in bulk.

**Example:** A family that switches from individually wrapped snack packs to bulk purchases can eliminate hundreds of plastic wrappers in a single year.

# 5)) Replace Disposable Food Storage

Cling film, sandwich bags, and plastic containers are common in most kitchens, but there are plenty of eco-friendly alternatives. 

Replacing single-use storage with durable, reusable products can dramatically reduce household plastic waste.

**Why it matters:** Food storage plastics are typically thin, degrade quickly, and often can’t be recycled.

**Best practices:**

* Use glass containers with lids for leftovers.
* Try beeswax wraps instead of cling film.
* Opt for silicone storage bags—they’re durable, washable, and freezer-safe.

**Resource:** Many eco-friendly brands now offer starter kits for sustainable kitchen swaps, making it easy to begin.

# 6)) Choose Refillable Personal Care Products

From shampoo to body wash, most personal care products come in plastic bottles. 

But refill stations and solid alternatives are becoming widely available.

**Why it matters:** Bathroom products are one of the biggest sources of household plastic waste, but most of them have sustainable versions.

**Ideas to get started:**

* Use shampoo and conditioner bars.
* Buy refill pouches instead of new bottles.
* Support brands that offer packaging return or refill programs.

**Warning:** Be mindful of “greenwashing.” Just because a product is labeled “eco-friendly” doesn’t mean its packaging is sustainable. Always check for truly plastic-free or refillable options.

# 7)) Bring Your Own Coffee Cup

Takeaway coffee cups may look like paper, but most are lined with plastic to make them waterproof. 

This means they rarely get recycled. Carrying your own reusable cup is a simple swap that adds up fast.

**Why it matters:** Billions of coffee cups are discarded annually, many ending up in landfills.

**Tips:**

* Keep a lightweight reusable cup in your bag.
* Some cafes even give discounts when you bring your own cup.
* Stainless steel insulated cups keep drinks warm longer.

**Hack:** If you forget your reusable cup, ask for your coffee in a ceramic mug when you plan to drink it in-store.

# 8)) Rethink Takeout Packaging

Ordering takeout often comes with a mountain of plastic containers, utensils, and bags. 

But you can still enjoy the convenience of takeout while minimizing waste.

**Why it matters:** Single-use takeout packaging is a huge contributor to plastic waste, especially polystyrene containers that never break down.

**Best practices:**

* Request no plastic cutlery when ordering.
* Choose restaurants that use compostable or paper-based packaging.
* Bring your own containers when picking up food.

**Swipe idea:** Create a simple “takeout kit” with reusable cutlery, containers, and napkins that you can grab when ordering food to-go.

# 9)) Avoid Microplastics in Personal Care

Many scrubs, toothpastes, and beauty products contain microbeads—tiny plastic particles that wash down the drain and end up polluting oceans.

**Why it matters:** Microplastics are impossible to filter from wastewater and have been found in marine animals and even human bloodstreams.

**Checklist to avoid microplastics:**

* Look for labels that say “microbead-free.”
* Avoid ingredients like polyethylene (PE) or polypropylene (PP).
* Choose natural exfoliants like sugar, salt, or ground coffee.

**Example:** Switching to a microplastic-free face scrub means fewer harmful particles entering waterways every time you wash your face.

# 10)) Support Plastic-Free Brands

Where you spend your money makes a statement. Supporting brands that prioritize sustainable, plastic-free packaging encourages more businesses to follow suit.

**Why it matters:** Consumer demand drives industry change. Choosing eco-conscious companies helps shift the market away from single-use plastics.

**Tips to find them:**

* Look for brands with certifications like “Plastic-Free” or “Zero Waste.”
* Check packaging materials before buying.
* Follow eco-conscious communities online to discover new brands.

**Resource idea:** Keep a list of your favorite plastic-free brands to make shopping easier and share them with friends to spread the movement.

# 11)) Recycle Smartly 

Recycling is helpful, but not all plastics are created equal. Knowing what can and can’t be recycled prevents contamination and ensures your effort makes a real difference.

**Why it matters:** Many well-intentioned recycling efforts fail because of “wishcycling” (tossing things in the bin hoping they’ll be recycled).

**Best practices:**

* Learn your local recycling rules.
* Rinse containers before recycling.
* Avoid thin plastics like cling film, which are rarely accepted.

**Template idea:** Create a “Recycling Cheat Sheet” for your home to remind everyone what belongs in the bin and what doesn’t.

# 12)) Educate and Inspire Others

Reducing plastic waste isn’t just about personal habits—it’s about creating a ripple effect. Sharing what you’ve learned helps others make changes too.

**Why it matters:** One person inspiring five others multiplies the impact. Education is one of the most powerful tools in creating a sustainable future.

**Ways to inspire others:**

* Host a plastic-free challenge with friends or coworkers.
* Share tips on social media.
* Talk to local schools or community groups about **simple ways to reduce plastic waste**.

**Warning:** Don’t guilt others into change. Lead by example, and show how easy and rewarding plastic-free living can be.

# Conclusion

Reducing plastic waste doesn’t have to mean overhauling your entire lifestyle. It’s about small, consistent choices that become habits. 

By bringing reusable bags, skipping plastic straws, buying in bulk, and supporting plastic-free brands, we each contribute to a healthier planet.

When we choose simple ways to reduce plastic waste, we’re not just making life greener for ourselves—we’re setting an example for others and leaving a cleaner world behind.

Don’t get me wrong. I love media. I love the ability of our times for millions of people to share a learning they made on a day and share it with other millions of people immediately. How beautiful is this opportunity for collective education?

But there can be too much of anything. And the easiest way to counter it is by having a Zen practice in your life.

What is Zen?
Zen is a school of Mahayana Buddhism that emphasizes meditation, mindfulness, and direct experiential insight over theoretical knowledge or ritual. You probably have come across pictures of Japan with very structured minimalist gardens - that‘s Zen. The beautiful thing about Zen is that anything can become a meditation. You don’t have to sit down for 1 min in the lotus posture and „meditate“. Meditating like that would already be advanced because it is a new additional practice. Instead, choose an activity you’re doing every day anyway and make that activity a meditation. Doing the dishes every day - why not make it a meditation? No music, no podcast, nothing.

Just you and the doing.

How do you practice Zen?
I personally started my Zen practice recently by making coffee with a martor and pestle. In the course of minimalism I threw away three broken electric grinders to one immortal stainless steel mortar and pestle that’s going to serve me for the rest of my life. Now in the morning grinding my coffee with the mortar has become my Zen practice, this beautiful stillness and the coffee becomes even more of a highlight because I had to grind the beans myself.

This is actually why the Japanese are amazing craftsman because they make anything a meditation, making tea, martial arts, including work and making high quality cars.

Now imagine how this could compound in your life. If you make just one activity in your daily life a meditation it will not just make you better at that one activity, but you will become more focused in all other activities as well.",3,1757871002.0,getdisciplined,0,1.0,False

1ngxbbz,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpotlessSecrets/comments/1ngxbbz/reveal_the_truth_about_weiman_wood_polish_and_its/,Reveal the Truth About Weiman Wood Polish and Its Real Benefits,"**My Daily Experience with Weiman Wood Furniture Cleaner & Polish**

I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I first picked up the Weiman B0C8VK3TWW cleaner and polish. With two aerosol cans and a microfiber towel neatly bundled in the package, it looked promising. Every day, my house seems to take a beating—kids’ toys scraping chair backs, water rings from neglected coasters, and, of course, the relentless sunlight streaming through the windows into my living room. Armed with this polish, I tackled every wooden surface like a person on a mission, and I’ve got plenty to say about the results.

**Packaging and What's Inside Matters**

One of the first things that made an impression was the straightforward yet practical packaging. Both aerosol cans arrived in protective wrapping alongside the microfiber cleaning towel. The towel wasn’t just some thrown-in “freebie.” It felt high-quality and worked well for spreading the polish evenly across surfaces. While the two-pack size is convenient, I would have appreciated a resealable box for better storage. Tiny gripe, but it’s all part of the experience.

**Ease of Use and Application**

Using the product couldn’t be simpler. I’d shake the can, spray a light mist directly onto the wooden surface, and follow it up with the microfiber towel. It’s delightfully non-greasy, which surprised me. Unlike other wood cleaners that leave a waxy residue or an overly artificial shine, this one dries into a subtle glow that feels refreshingly natural. The lack of silicone or wax in its formula deserves some applause here—it means no grime builds up over time, and that’s huge for a mom of two sticky-handed toddlers and a coffee-spilling spouse.

**Advantages**

- Contains UVX protection to shield wood from fading and discoloration.
- Moisturizing oils like safflower and sesame revive wood grain’s natural beauty.
- Excellent at preventing water stains and food marks on surfaces.
- Easy-to-use aerosol application paired with the included microfiber cloth.
- Leaves wood looking polished without feeling greasy or oily.

**Performance and Results Over Time**

I’ve been using this polish for a few weeks now, and my furniture has been looking consistently refreshed. I used it on an antique wooden table that normally feels like it drinks up half a bottle of conditioner to look halfway decent. This polish delivered impressive results after just one application. The UVX protection is also an understated hero. It’s too soon to tell if it’ll completely block the sun damage on my window-side chairs, but, judging by the slight improvement in some previously dulled areas, I’m hopeful. 

One downside I encountered is that the product doesn’t work well on grooved or intricately carved surfaces like some of my older, ornate cabinet edges. It tends to pool in those tight spots unless wiped carefully. A quick pointer—don’t over-spray; moderation is key.

**Target Audience and Use Cases**

This polish is a win for anyone with finished wood furniture, whether that’s antique tables, cabinets, or modern pieces. On the other hand, hardwood floor enthusiasts should look elsewhere because this product explicitly warns against such use. Families with kids or pets would particularly adore the surface-protecting qualities of this cleaner. It makes maintenance feel less daunting while cultivating an eye-catching luster everyone will notice.

**Good Points**

- Comes as a convenient two-pack with a reusable towel.
- Works effectively on most types of wood furniture.
- Protects against common wear and tear, including food and drink stains.
- Formula derived from natural moisturizing oils for an eco-friendly touch.

**Shortcomings**

- Doesn’t perform as well on carved or grooved wooden surfaces.
- Avoid use on hardwood floors as per label instructions.
- The aerosol format, while generally practical, risks over-application if not sprayed cautiously.
   
**Direct Competitors**

When placed next to its competitors, like Old English or Murphy Oil Soap, this cleaner holds its ground. Old English excels in scratch coverage with its darker oils, but it’s not nearly as proficient in UV protection. Murphy Oil Soap, known for its citrus-infused cleaning power, can clean wood surfaces well but lacks the dedicated conditioning Weiman offers. Another competitor, Pledge Furniture Spray, is user-friendly, though it often leaves a slick or almost chemical-like finish, while Weiman treads the line between effective cleaning and a more natural appearance. Each option serves its niche, but if preserving and conditioning natural wood luster ranks as your top priority, this polish wins the day.

**Affordable Quality**

Considering the bundle includes two 12-ounce bottles and a microfiber towel, it’s quite reasonable for its features. The UVX protection and inclusion of natural oils put it in a premium category while avoiding an exorbitant price tag. Many alternatives fall short in one area or another, making this cleaner a sensible investment without feeling like a splurge.

I decided that i was annoyed with the flavor, so I adjusted the internal setting of the burr grinder to the absolute finest, and then set it to the finest setting of 1, essentially grinding the coffee as fine as possible. This produces a pretty good tasting cup, but it’s insanely hard to get anything out of the machine. When i grind coarser gradually, it fixes the problem, but it goes back to being sour.

I was drinking enough water and electrolytes and an energy drink but still felt sluggish and flat. I sipped a pickle juice drink and within seconds felt better. I realized it was not that the sodium was absorbed in seconds but that the strong acidic taste triggered nervous system to wake up. So just like being slapped in the face or smelling ammonia salts, your body gets into fight or flight and blood is diverted away from digestive organs.


Here are some examples of taste stimulation to feel alert:	

•	Sour + salty: pickle juice, lemon/lime + salt water, vinegar shot.
	•	Spicy: bite of chili pepper, cayenne/hot sauce in water.
	•	Bitter: black coffee (even decaf), strong tea, tonic water.
	•	Mint / menthol: strong sugar-free mints, peppermint oil in water.

My love language is words of affirmation. For at least the past 4 years, probably longer honestly, I am constantly begging him to give me more compliments and words of encouragement. Or even when its my birthday, to just make me a card that he writes in. Stuff like that means a lot to me. I have expressed this countless times to him.

I even told him before we left the house that he looked good. He just smirked at me and said ""I always do."" I got nothing the whole night. 

Finally when we got home, I brought it up to him. He got mad at me for making it an issue & that its not that big of a deal. I try to explain to him that it means a lot to me cause it makes me feel loved. And I'm not feeling love from you. He told me that if I wanted compliments to post on social media and that since were married, I should just know and shouldn't need compliments. I even tried to explain that its not just compliments, thank me for making your lunch or coffee everyday or doing your laundry. He just told me that he doesn't know why he loves or married me. 

So here I am heartbroken, thinking my marriage is over. He is just going about his day like nothing ever happened. AITA for honestly considering ending our marriage over this?",3,1757870782.0,AITA_Relationships,7,1.0,False
1ngx8ve,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diverticulitis/comments/1ngx8ve/whats_your_relationship_to_caffeine_like/,What's your relationship to caffeine like post-diagnosis?,"I got diagnosed at the ER on tuesday and have been doing the despair dance about food since then because not being able to eat has been super dysregulating. Pre-diagnosis I ate a pretty wide variety of foods, lots of salad, I'd say fairly high fiber overall, mostly chicken, fish, and tofu, red meat maybe once every couple of months for a special occasion. I would start every day with overnight oats made with berries and hemp hearts, and after eating my oats I'd have a 12oz cup of coffee with whole milk and about a tsp of brown sugar.

I'm hoping I can mostly go back to eating my regular foods again once I'm done with the antibiotics and have transitioned from low residue to low fiber to slowly incorporating more fiber, especially since constipation was not really an issue for me (I was clockwork regular without fail even on weekends).

Have many if y'all had to give up coffee post-diagnosis? I've been reading as much as I can about diverticular disease since my ER visit and I'm reading some conflicting advice about whether or not coffee and caffeine in general is to be avoided or is fine. I assume because everyone is different and experiences it differently, that it's a ymmv situation where some people can tolerate coffee just fine and others have had to make changes, but I wanted to hear some experiences to sort of calibrate my expectations and make a sort of game plan as I recover. Obviously my ideal would be to go back to drinking my beloved coffee in the morning, but if I might have to switch to decaf or make a change to a different morning bev altogether I'd wanna start thinking about my options now.

tl;dr do you still drink coffee? did you have to switch to decaf? did you give it up entirely? what did you opt for if you had to give it up? did you just have to stop drinking it with milk? what's your experience with it as it relates to diverticulitis?",3,1757870758.0,Diverticulitis,9,1.0,False
1ngx8hx,https://i.redd.it/ijzp17l006pf1.png,DIVERSION — Part III: The Silent Parade,"The snow in Cleveland didn’t fall. It arranged itself.

Every flake seemed to know where the others wanted to land. Streets hushed, as if a parade were about to begin, but no one had practiced the instruments.

Stencil walked with the compass in his pocket, its shards clicking like small teeth. Each step was measured against the silence—a silence that pressed back, aware of him.

Elizabeth had said his name. Twice. Too perfectly. He replayed the sound, searching for seams in the syllables. Proof-of-life, or proof-of-editing?  
The compass was proof of something else: that Williams preferred metaphors with edges.

On West 14th, three men carried umbrellas in a city without rain. They moved too close together, formation tight, like punctuation marks in a sentence Stencil couldn’t yet read. He crossed, adjusted pace. The men adjusted too. He counted breaths. He thought about Davar, Mashhad, the folder with exits annotated like scripture.

At a deli window he caught his reflection in the glass: jacket ordinary, eyes not. Behind him, the three umbrellas stopped, tilted slightly inward. A signal.

Stencil entered the deli, ordered coffee he wouldn’t drink, and sat at a booth with a view of the street. The umbrellas vanished, as if folded into the snow itself. The silence pressed harder.

Elizabeth, somewhere—or someone’s idea of Elizabeth—was waiting for him to choose noise or obedience. Haresh had told him: *Choose noise.*  
But noise had a cost. Noise always woke the wrong people.

The phone in his pocket—one of many—buzzed once. A single word appeared: **MARCH.**

He looked outside. Down the street, figures appeared in rows. Not soldiers, not protesters. Ordinary citizens, walking as if called by some frequency he couldn’t hear. Their faces were blank, their rhythm exact. The silent parade stretched farther than the eye allowed.

Every few steps, one figure turned their head—not toward him, but toward the building across the street, where a banner hung half-unfurled. The banner’s letters were wrong, jagged, almost symbols. But he knew the message wasn’t meant to be read. It was meant to be remembered.

Stencil tapped the compass shards in his pocket. East, west, everywhere.  
The parade turned the corner, its silence louder than any siren.  
Somewhere in the crowd, Elizabeth’s voice whispered again—“Jacques”—but no lips moved.

He stood. The compass needle shifted against his palm, pulling him not toward the door, but down. Basement-level. A place no parade should reach.

He descended the deli’s stairs, into a room meant for storage. Instead he found candles burning in a circle, wax fresh, flame steady. On the wall: a single phrase scrawled in red chalk.

**“SEED THE CLOUD.”**

He didn’t hear the door close behind him. But he felt it.

1ngx8hw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1ngx8hw/aio_living_with_boyfriends_family_and_how_he_acts/,AIO living with boyfriends family and how he acts,"I’ve lived with my bf since October. We were living with roommates. After the one year lease was up we moved into his parent’s house. Mainly because his mother missed him and to also save up to get our own place. His sister and her son live here too. We stay in a room and his sister and her son stay in the one across from us. We share a bathroom. Now for backstory I was abused by my mother for the first 21 years of my life. It almost broke me. It didn’t I suppose but I act the way I do because of the abuse. I keep myself small at all times and try to stay hidden out of respect. I love his family and I’m pretty sure they enjoy me too but they’re not my family so I can’t act the way my bf wants me to. That consists of dinner time mainly. I have a hard time eating in front of people. It took me about six months to eat in front of my boyfriend. So dinner time comes around and of course I’m uncomfortable. I sit at the counter on a barstool with my bf instead of at the dinner table. They’re not super formal so it’s not a problem. The issue is that I won’t eat unless I’m invited. I’m not going to assume that dinner is for me (I know it is) I mentally cannot force myself into their family time without being uncomfortable. This has caused some issues. I’ll only eat if my boyfriend goes to eat with me. They’re not my family so I don’t feel like I belong in any situation if my boyfriend isn’t there. Also my boyfriend and his family are Hispanic. So they’re really big on hospitality so they don’t understand why I am the way I am but I can’t really explain the abuse to them. My mother would withhold food as punishment for days so I’m used to not eating. I can handle it. I also had to beg for food after the punishment. So it’s the main reason why I can’t just eat their food and not care. I know they worked hard to buy that food and I feel guilty just eating it. I buy my own food. I have it in the closet so I’m doing fine but somethings have to be in the fridge. It took me awhile for that to happen but I eat a salad everyday for work and the ingredients have to be cold. I got over that and I’m doing better. Now my issues are with my boyfriend not his family. I feel like I’m somewhat overreacting but I also feel like my boyfriend isn’t being fair. A couple of days ago I visited my father. He has a bunch of food and drinks that my sister gave him. He told me to take anything I wanted because he would probably waste it. I ate on some of it but I didn’t really want to bring anything home besides a jug of Milo’s sweet tea. It has been in the fridge here for two days. My boyfriend and I have been drinking on it. I’m not sure if his parents have. His sister was in another state and came home last night. Now I want to clarify that I don’t care if they drink the tea. I didn’t even buy it so I don’t mind whatsoever. His mother and sister always make me feel included when they cook and I love and appreciate it so much. It’s only right that I eat their food and they can have whatever I bring. That’s precisely why I put the tea in the fridge. So everyone could have some. The problem happened today. I took a shower and came out and looked into the kitchen and saw the empty jug on the kitchen counter. I figured it was his sister or for his young nephew. I went into our room and asked him if he drank it. I only asked because I was going to tell him to clean up after himself considering we just cleaned the entire house yesterday and I scrubbed those counters. He responded with “you know they can eat or drink anything they want. I don’t know why you act like this.” I was immediately upset. I also asked because if he had the last cup I wanted a sip of it. I don’t understand why he immediately thinks I’m upset that they drank it. I do everything in my control to hide my entire existence from his family so I don’t feel like a burden. I stay in the room unless I’m invited. I only shower at ten after his family showers. I don’t use their pans or anything to cook. I even have my own coffee maker so I don’t use theirs. I can’t allow myself to be rude to them so I don’t understand why my bf thinks that I am. Also I want to add that he never did this at the apartment. It only started when we moved here. It makes feel so uncomfortable. I took my wall down to make him and his family happy but it just makes me feel uneasy and on edge when he does things like this. It honestly makes me feel the way I did with my mother. So I’m wondering if I’m overreacting or if my boyfriend should be a little easier on me since I’m working on my issues 


To shorten it, my boyfriend acts like I’m rude to his family by not including myself into their family time without being asked and also about food I put in their fridge. ",6,1757870733.0,AmIOverreacting,14,1.0,False

1ngx5sn,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1ngx5sn/have_one_zen_practice_in_your_life/,Have one Zen practice in your life.,"In these information flooded times it’s crucial to have a counter and balance it all.

Don’t get me wrong. I love media. I love the ability of our times for millions of people to share a learning they made on a day and share it with other millions of people immediately. How beautiful is this opportunity for collective education?

But there can be too much of anything. And the easiest way to counter it is by having a Zen practice in your life.

What is Zen?
Zen is a school of Mahayana Buddhism that emphasizes meditation, mindfulness, and direct experiential insight over theoretical knowledge or ritual. You probably have come across pictures of Japan with very structured minimalist gardens - that‘s Zen. The beautiful thing about Zen is that anything can become a meditation. You don’t have to sit down for 1 min in the lotus posture and „meditate“. Meditating like that would already be advanced because it is a new additional practice. Instead, choose an activity you’re doing every day anyway and make that activity a meditation. Doing the dishes every day - why not make it a meditation? No music, no podcast, nothing.

Just you and the doing.

How do you practice Zen?
I personally started my Zen practice recently by making coffee with a martor and pestle. In the course of minimalism I threw away three broken electric grinders to one immortal stainless steel mortar and pestle that’s going to serve me for the rest of my life. Now in the morning grinding my coffee with the mortar has become my Zen practice, this beautiful stillness and the coffee becomes even more of a highlight because I had to grind the beans myself.

This is actually why the Japanese are amazing craftsman because they make anything a meditation, making tea, martial arts, including work and making high quality cars.

Now imagine how this could compound in your life. If you make just one activity in your daily life a meditation it will not just make you better at that one activity, but you will become more focused in all other activities as well.",2,1757870562.0,productivity,1,1.0,False

I reached out, and only then did they tell me that their supplier had “misplaced” my product and sent something completely different. I asked for a refund, but was told it wasn’t in their “policy.” Instead, my options were to accept the wrong product with a ₹300 partial refund, or wait another 3 to 4 months.
I chose to wait. That was over a year ago. The product never arrived.
Later, they publicly stated that customers who didn’t receive their orders would get refunds after the launch of their jewelry line. They asked for proof of payment and details, which I provided immediately. Since then, I’ve had no response. I’ve tried reaching them via email, WhatsApp, and Instagram and NOTHING.

I make no exaggeration when I inform you all that the pure terror in Randall's bulging eyes might still be the most satisfying sight of my existence.

While I’ve never been a particularly massive guy, Randall was even less so. I had at least forty pounds on his scrawny self; his attempts to push me off him were weak, pathetic things. I knelt on his chest and arms. One of my hands clamped over his mouth. The other squeezed his windpipe.

“If I let you breathe, will you scream?” I asked.

Despite my grip, he managed to jerk his head back and forth. I narrowed my eyes, then tentatively, *cautiously* loosened my grip.

He screamed.

It turned into a strangled whimper when I slapped him hard across the face. 

*What a fragile thing*, I mused. *Power*. 

People invent entire hierarchies in their minds, based on job positions, societal norms, looks, and a million other trivialities. In the end, when you get to the raw churning stomach of it, all that really gives you power over another person is what terrible things you can stomach to do to them.

A line of red trailed from Randall’s nose. His eyes were bloodshot.

“That probably didn't feel good,” I said. “Shall we try again?”

He didn't nod, but once again I pulled my hands from his throat. This time he only gasped for breath.

“You’re psycho,” he snarled. “*Insane*.”

“Indeed. A week alone on the road will do that to you.”

“We weren't trying to kill you. You should have just followed the rules.”

“I *did* follow the rules, thanks very much. Lucky for you, that isn't why I'm here.”

“*Fine*,” he spat. “Take another raise. Just let me go!”

“Wrong again.” I paused. “Yeah, I will take that though, thanks. No. I'm here because we had a bargain. I fulfilled my end. Your turn.”

“I *know*.” He wriggled to free his arms but gave up. “For goodness’ sake Brendon, you didn’t even let me say hello! You really think so low of me? That I forgot about our agreement? You could have just sat down like a *sane human being*, and we could have had this conversation civilly. You didn't even give me a chance.”

“Ah, but this *is* your chance. Please understand, I am fully prepared to harm, break, maim―fill in whatever pain-inducing verb you desire―if you try to lie to me. I haven't actually done anything to you yet, have I? Hopefully, after this warning, I won't need to. Does that make sense?”

He swore at me.

I shoved him hard against the ground, and his head smacked the wood.

“Does that make sense?”

“Okay! Just let me up. I'll answer your questions.”

I did. I patted under his desk for a panic button (nothing) and sifted through his drawers for a gun (none). Finally, I gestured for him to take his seat. His receding hair was in disarray, his chin dripping with blood. I remained standing between him and the locked door.

“No lies,” I said.

“What do you want to know?”

“What was the thing in the trailer?”

He grimaced, sighed, and raised his hands in submission. “Honestly? I don't know. Management is secretive. They won't―”

I punched him in the face.

Pretty much all I knew about punching was to keep your thumb outside your fist. Otherwise, you might break it. Judging by the crunching, the screaming, and the altogether outpouring of blood, I guessed I’d done a decent job. 

I shook the pain from my own arm. “I repeat. No lying. Do we understand this time?”

He clutched his nose―broken for sure―and moaned. Blood flowed from his cupped hands.

I pulled back my arm. “*Understand?”*

He whimpered but nodded and shrank back into his seat, pale and shuddering.

“Very good,” I said. “Let’s try once more. What was the thing in my trailer?”

But first.

A pause. 

To understand the disaster that comes next, I need to rewind a few weeks, explain a few things. I realize now that while I’ve done a decent job at describing my experiences on Route 333, I’ve woefully neglected saying much about headquarters.

From what I can tell, other trucking companies often have things separated out. The truck yard is in one place. Offices and dispatch (not that most have dispatch the same as us) might be in another. Here though, it’s all lumped together: one enormous parking lot at the edge of the forest, a mile or two from the nearest town. A double story office building at the center. Route 333 starts just a few bends of the road away.

The truck yard is the same place we pick up our rigs, drop off our keys, and hang out before we head home. It’s rare we overlap, but when we do, it somehow always turns into a group of us, not just two or three―maybe the others plan this in a secret chat without me?

Despite my ever-deepening people-aversion, I don’t mind running into other truckers. Even if they’re decades older than me. They’re usually *also* people-averse people, which makes the exchanges easier. *Oh, you feel awkward too? Great! Let’s keep this quick.* 

We congregate in the breakroom to chat, grab sodas, or when there’s enough of us, an occasional round of poker. So it was a few weeks ago, when I discovered―after six consecutive rounds of sliding red chips into the pot―that I was, in fact, incompetent at poker.

“‘K, I’m out,” I said.

“*Bah*.” Chris shoved a cigarette in his mouth. He couldn’t actually smoke them inside, but he liked the “taste,” apparently? “You’ve still got more chips.”

“That’s sort of the point. Leave while I’m ahead.”

“You’re behind.”

“Leave while I’m *less* behind,” I clarified.

“What are they teaching young people these days?” Deidree said. “First, no more smoking with your teachers. Now, no more gambling addictions?”

“We’ve really gone off the deep end,” I agreed.

Vikram pulled the sizable pot of chips to join his mountain of a pile. “Entertaining as this has been, I must agree with the boy. I should be getting home.”

“*Garbage*,” Chris said. “You’re just high-tailing it with our money before we can win it back.”

“With what?” Vikram eyed Chris’ handful of white chips―even more pitiful than my own. “*Those*?”

“Just a few more rounds,” Deidree insisted.

“Really. My wife will be expecting me.”

“Message her you’ll be late,” Chris said.

“Not likely,” Vikram said. “There is never reception here.”

Deidree rolled her eyes. I had to agree. I’d almost never had an issue sending messages or calling.

“No really,” Vikram insisted. He demonstrated his phone and the *No signal* tag.

“Let me see that,” Chris said, and Vikram passed it. “Looks fine to me. 5G and everything. See.”

We did see. And when Chris passed it back, we all saw the *No signal* tag that popped once again onto the screen.

That’s how we learned about the *line*.

It took some experimenting. We tested with each of our phones and carriers, but eventually, we learned an invisible line perfectly bisected the breakroom. On one side? Full bars. On the other? Not even texts could get through.

“You guys didn’t know about this?” I asked.

Deidree shook her head. “I’m usually connected to the Wi-Fi. Suppose it makes sense, though, since we’re a ways from town in the middle of a building.”

“Let’s not forget the important thing,” Chris said. “Vikram can now text his wife and I can now win back my money.”

Vikram did.

Chris didn’t.

“It wasn’t human,” Randall said. “If that’s what you’re worried about.”

His voice came out stuffy, as if he’d shoved his nose full of cotton balls. He spit blood in the trashcan under his desk. 

“It was an impossibility,” Randall said. “That’s what we call them―*impossibilities.* Paradoxes manifested in the physical. Things from another place. Sometimes, they’re alive like the one from your most recent trip, but usually you’re only transporting non-sentient ones. Physical paradoxes and whatnot.”

“Like what?”

“They’re not comprehensible. That’s the issue. Plants that are both alive and dead. Water cups that are both full and empty. They’re an infection. If you leave them too long somewhere in the real world, they start to spread and affect stable things around them. I once heard of an entire neighborhood where every person turned inside out because the impossibility didn’t get taken care of in time.”

“Well, the thing in my freight sounded like a person,” I said. “A child. Crying.”

“First off, you shouldn't have been talking to it. Second, the forest-dwellers sound human enough too. The inhabitants of the road, the ones who work at the gas stations―they all seem like people, but they’re not real.”

“They are.” I remembered what Tiff told me nearly ten days ago now. “They’re just a different type of real.”

“Sure, fine, whatever you need to believe. They aren't human, though. That thing in your trailer? Do you know any child who could go five days without food or water?”

“It was still alive.”

“It was *malevolent*,” Randall said. “If you’d let it out, that thing would have dissected you piece by piece in whatever order kept you alive the longest.”

My teeth gritted. “I don’t believe you.”

He snorted―or tried to. The wince on his face reminded both of us his nose was still very much broken. “Claim what you will, but you haven't punched me again, Brendon. Inside, even you know I’m telling the truth. Whatever obsessive parental attachment you formed with that thing was one-sided. Let it go. It wasn’t a person. It was cunning. Enough so it knew the only way you might let it go was by not asking you to let it go at all.”

“Maybe it was a scared child that didn't know to ask.”

“Why can’t you accept you were helping remove something evil? This should be a good thing. You didn’t do anything wrong. *Hurray*.”

Why exactly *didn’t* I want to believe Randall? Ever since the earth had opened up, ever since the shrieking and crunching and that terrible silence, my stomach had churned endlessly. For five days that one sickening moment had repeated in the back of my mind like the hum of an air conditioner. Occasionally forgettable. Always present.

*It doesn’t have to.* 

*It could stop.*

Here was my out, juicy and ripe for the plucking. The creature had been trying to trick me. I’d been smart in resisting it. I’d done the *right* thing.

“You can’t stand yourself,” Randall said.

“What?”

The shift in his voice was so sudden, I experienced a wave of vertigo.

“That was why you took this job, wasn’t it? You were trying to run from something in your old life, but you’ve realized the thing you were running from was you all along.”

“You don't know anything about me.” 

“You despise yourself, and now you look for any excuse to continue despising yourself.”

Here Randall was, covered in blood from a wound *I’d* given him and yet he’d once again resumed his position of authority. His hands were folded neatly. His body bent just a degree in my direction as if to signal that, *Yes, Brendon. I am still your owner. In the end, you will still do what I say and believe what I tell you.* Any trace of his fear for me was gone, replaced entirely by smugness. 

So infuriatingly smug.

“You know what I think?” I asked. “I think if our cargo really *were* so evil, you and the rest of management would have told all of us from the start. Why shouldn’t you? Me and the rest of your lackeys would be more than happy to help out―instead, you hide the truth, which means there’s something that’s worth hiding. That’s what I think.”

I drew a box cutter from my pocket, extended the blade, and rested it on the desk.

Randall’s smirk faltered.

“Let’s continue,” I said.

“You forgot these!”

I trotted up to Chris, dangling his keys, who waited for me at the doors of his rig. We’d both just come from a breakfast with Tiff (breakfast at Tiffany’s, yeah, yeah, I got it). Even rarer than the days when we all happened to meet in the breakroom were the days we happened to meet up at Tiff’s diner.

 I think we all went out of our way, if merely subconsciously, to fill up at her truck stop when reasonably justifiable and visit for a few minutes. She was lonely. She had no one. When she heard we were coming over her radio, she would spend hours preparing a full-buffet breakfast of burnt bacon, watery eggs, and soggy pancakes. The least we could do was eat.

Plus, she was still the only place to get a decent cup of coffee.

“Much obliged,” Chris said, taking the keys. “Don’t tell management, but my memory’s not what it used to be.”

“Happens to all of us.”

He sighed. “Maybe―you know, sometimes I forget the way to Route 333. I leave from dispatch, and I just… *forget*. It isn’t even far. It all just looks unfamiliar.”

I considered. “You are pretty old.”

He laughed and slapped me on the back of my head. “I’ll still whoop you in poker.”

I laughed too―he wouldn't though. 

Chris was worse at poker than me.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

“Route 333 is a corridor between two worlds,” Randall continued. “Or possibly multiple worlds. We don’t know totally, just that it’s the only way to get rid of the impossibilities.”

“It sounds like they keep getting through though. Wouldn't it be better to seal off the road entirely?”

Randall shook his head. “Paradoxes fall randomly into our world, not by the road. There's whole teams dedicated to predicting where and when. Route 333 is merely one of the stable ways to get them back.”

“Okay.” I tried to wrap my head around this all. “So we’re taking them back to the place they came from. That’s what our cargo is.”

“Not exactly.”

I gripped the box cutter and nodded pointedly at it.

“Gosh Brendon, take a Xanax. I’m *trying* to explain this. It’s not so simple, okay? The highway is like…well, like nothing. It’s like the nothing between the repelling sides of two magnets. It’s not actually its own thing. All it wants is that these two magnets don’t touch. 

“You’re not taking things back to their origin, because the road won’t let you. It recognizes you don’t belong over there and it stops you―or tries to. Someone like you who can traverse the road so quickly could probably make it. It would take weeks. You’d be driven mad by the time you arrived, but you could do it. Usually, the most we can do is drop them off far out on the highway and hope they take up residence.”

“The creatures on the road,” I started, “the Faceless Man and Highway Patrol, they’re all just living impossibilities we removed from this world?”

“Some of them. Others we’re not so sure about. Faceless Man has his own set of rules―I'm not sure if he was our doing or something else entirely. The forest-dwellers were cargo once though, long before my time.”

“But they’re so close. Why don’t they just come back?”

“Close for you,” Randall said. “For them? They’re hundreds of years from escaping. Like I said, the road knows they don’t belong here.”

“They’re lane-locked,” I said.

For a moment, just a moment, Randall’s expression faltered. Almost like… guilt, perhaps?

“Why did they all want the thing in my trailer?” I asked.

“The road can be known to make deals at times. They trap another living impossibility in their place and get to proceed freely. They could cross back to our world in hours. Just as long as the balance of it all is maintained.”

“The road is sentient then?”

“Not in the sense you’re thinking. A computer isn’t sentient, but it calculates.”

“Is it evil?”

“Is a computer evil?” Randall threw back at me.

*Fair enough.*

Everything he’d explained…it raised so many more questions, but there was a sense of overall cohesion. The explanation flowed quickly. He wasn’t merely spouting off nonsense or making up lies. There were so many more things I needed to ask―why no phones, what about the meat storm, who collected these impossibilities―but one question would drive to the heart of it all.

“Why don’t you just tell us?” I asked. “If this is all true, if we’re really preventing infections in the real world, then why not just include this as a section in the employee manual? Why so much mystery?”

“To be fair, you haven’t even read the employee manual.”

“I’ve read *most* of it!” I calmed myself. “It isn’t though, is it?”

“Nah.”

“Then why?”

He shifted uncomfortably. He made a grand show of glancing at the clock. Stalling. I’d hit on something. We’d finally reached the part Randall was truly dreading.

“My shift ended half an hour ago,” he said. “They’re going to come looking for me. You can’t keep me here forever.”

“I can for now.”

“What will you do when somebody else comes? Fight both of us? This was a dumb idea, and you know it. Let me go now and I promise―”

I slammed my fist on the desk. “Answer the question!”

“They’ll see my car,” Randall continued. “They’ll *know* I’m here. They’ll come find me.”

I laughed. “They won’t see a thing. The streetlight was burnt out. Your office door is closed. We have all night.”

“Are you joking?” His voice was calm, slow, each word enunciated. His eyes were wide. “The streetlight. Was it really out?”

“Uh… yeah?”

I’ve never understood what it meant for somebody’s face to go white. I always assumed it was an expression, a way to say “scared” or “nervous”, a descriptive phraseology if you will. 

Turns out I was wrong.

Randall’s face went entirely, completely white.

He swore. “We need to go. I’m not joking. This isn’t me trying to get out of our interrogation. Brendon, if the streetlight is really out, it might already be too late.”

“We’re staying,” I snarled. “I’m not falling for another lie.”

“I’ll answer anything you want later, literally anything, I swear it on my wife and kids―

“You don't have kids.”

“―on my *future* kids, okay! But we need to go.” His voice lowered to a whisper. “*Please*.”

It was that word that caught me off guard. I’d seen Randall in a variety of situations now. I’d seen him angry and laughing, smug and terrified. I’d never, however, heard him *beg.*

It took me so by surprise, it might have actually worked. I might have believed him and put down the switchblade and done what he said…

Before I could, he seized a glass mug and lobbed it at the one and only light.

The light snapped out. Glass shattered. Out of instinct, I covered my head to avoid the raining shards, just enough time to miss the scramble at a lock. The opening of a door.

“NO!” I roared, but he was already gone.

I tore after him, down the hall. All lights except the late-night emergency ones were out and the luminescent EXIT signs. Shadows lengthened. I caught the flash of a heel around the corner. The slam of a hallway door.

I knew where he was going: down the stairs. I took a side stairwell. Just as he reached the bottom floor, I launched myself at him. We toppled.

Randall screamed and kicked under my weight. “You don’t understand!”

It was true. I didn’t. Very likely, something very terrible was about to occur, but what I *did* know was that I was fed up. No more half-truths and blind orders. I’d spent a week thinking I was protecting some helpless creature. Maybe it hadn't been, but I’d *thought* it was. My life was whiplash, existential crisis after existential crisis, and I didn't even get to know *why*. 

“What aren’t you telling me!” I demanded.

“Let me go!”

I shoved him, once, twice, *thrice* against the ground. *You’re not leaving. You’re not escaping. I am the one in control.* “Answer!”

“We know,” he gasped. “Before a trucker gets lane-locked, we always know.”

“*What!*”

“It’s a trade. Them for you newbies. There are signs we don’t tell you about. Route 333 marks the next candidate it wants to claim, and we make sure it gets them. Otherwise, none of you could traverse Route 333. We can't let that happen. It’s too important.”

“Who’s next!” I demanded.

“Chris. Now, let me go. *Please*.”

Some subconscious, simmering part of me wanted to hit him, to *keep* hitting him until he was nothing but a bloody pulp. A different part of me, though, did what he asked.

Randall stumbled to his feet, gasping in the gloom of the reception room.

“How dare you all,” I said. “You sacrifice us like―”

“We’re not alone.” He tapped his lips with a single finger and signaled at the street-facing windows.

It was all I needed to shut up. The mood shift was stark and definite. As much as I loathed him, as much as my blood boiled and my fists screamed to lash out, I forced myself to crouch next to him behind the reception desk. 

In the darkness of the parking lot, something moved. 

“What is it?” I whispered.

“Something only the streetlights were keeping at bay. Our circuits must have tripped.”

“Why would that matter? Isn’t the city powering the streetlamps?”

“We aren’t part of the city.”

“That doesn’t make any sense.”

“We’re on the road.”

It took a full ten seconds for me to register what he meant. Not just any road. We were on *that* road. Dispatch was located on Route 333.

I nearly told him he was wrong. The idea was ridiculous. The highway didn’t start for a few more streets. We were safe here. I’d used my *phone* in the truck yard, for goodness sake, and no meat storm had ever appeared.

Then I remembered the breakroom―the clear line of reception vs. no reception. What if it wasn’t just the breakroom? What if headquarters was divided by the boundary between two worlds, a boundary that didn't allow communication from one side to the other?

And Chris. Telling me he would forget the way from dispatch to the start of Route 333. What if he wasn’t forgetting? What if the way was just changing? *Lengthening*.

Randall and I held our breath as the thing outside once again shifted.

“I hate you,” I said.

I make no exaggeration when I inform you all that the pure terror in Randall's bulging eyes might still be the most satisfying sight of my existence.

While I’ve never been a particularly massive guy, Randall was even less so. I had at least forty pounds on his scrawny self; his attempts to push me off him were weak, pathetic things. I knelt on his chest and arms. One of my hands clamped over his mouth. The other squeezed his windpipe.

“If I let you breathe, will you scream?” I asked.

Despite my grip, he managed to jerk his head back and forth. I narrowed my eyes, then tentatively, *cautiously* loosened my grip.

He screamed.

It turned into a strangled whimper when I slapped him hard across the face. 

*What a fragile thing*, I mused. *Power*. 

People invent entire hierarchies in their minds, based on job positions, societal norms, looks, and a million other trivialities. In the end, when you get to the raw churning stomach of it, all that really gives you power over another person is what terrible things you can stomach to do to them.

A line of red trailed from Randall’s nose. His eyes were bloodshot.

“That probably didn't feel good,” I said. “Shall we try again?”

He didn't nod, but once again I pulled my hands from his throat. This time he only gasped for breath.

“You’re psycho,” he snarled. “*Insane*.”

“Indeed. A week alone on the road will do that to you.”

“We weren't trying to kill you. You should have just followed the rules.”

“I *did* follow the rules, thanks very much. Lucky for you, that isn't why I'm here.”

“*Fine*,” he spat. “Take another raise. Just let me go!”

“Wrong again.” I paused. “Yeah, I will take that though, thanks. No. I'm here because we had a bargain. I fulfilled my end. Your turn.”

“I *know*.” He wriggled to free his arms but gave up. “For goodness’ sake Brendon, you didn’t even let me say hello! You really think so low of me? That I forgot about our agreement? You could have just sat down like a *sane human being*, and we could have had this conversation civilly. You didn't even give me a chance.”

“Ah, but this *is* your chance. Please understand, I am fully prepared to harm, break, maim―fill in whatever pain-inducing verb you desire―if you try to lie to me. I haven't actually done anything to you yet, have I? Hopefully, after this warning, I won't need to. Does that make sense?”

He swore at me.

I shoved him hard against the ground, and his head smacked the wood.

“Does that make sense?”

“Okay! Just let me up. I'll answer your questions.”

I did. I patted under his desk for a panic button (nothing) and sifted through his drawers for a gun (none). Finally, I gestured for him to take his seat. His receding hair was in disarray, his chin dripping with blood. I remained standing between him and the locked door.

“No lies,” I said.

“What do you want to know?”

“What was the thing in the trailer?”

He grimaced, sighed, and raised his hands in submission. “Honestly? I don't know. Management is secretive. They won't―”

I punched him in the face.

Pretty much all I knew about punching was to keep your thumb outside your fist. Otherwise, you might break it. Judging by the crunching, the screaming, and the altogether outpouring of blood, I guessed I’d done a decent job. 

I shook the pain from my own arm. “I repeat. No lying. Do we understand this time?”

He clutched his nose―broken for sure―and moaned. Blood flowed from his cupped hands.

I pulled back my arm. “*Understand?”*

He whimpered but nodded and shrank back into his seat, pale and shuddering.

“Very good,” I said. “Let’s try once more. What was the thing in my trailer?”

But first.

A pause. 

To understand the disaster that comes next, I need to rewind a few weeks, explain a few things. I realize now that while I’ve done a decent job at describing my experiences on Route 333, I’ve woefully neglected saying much about headquarters.

From what I can tell, other trucking companies often have things separated out. The truck yard is in one place. Offices and dispatch (not that most have dispatch the same as us) might be in another. Here though, it’s all lumped together: one enormous parking lot at the edge of the forest, a mile or two from the nearest town. A double story office building at the center. Route 333 starts just a few bends of the road away.

The truck yard is the same place we pick up our rigs, drop off our keys, and hang out before we head home. It’s rare we overlap, but when we do, it somehow always turns into a group of us, not just two or three―maybe the others plan this in a secret chat without me?

Despite my ever-deepening people-aversion, I don’t mind running into other truckers. Even if they’re decades older than me. They’re usually *also* people-averse people, which makes the exchanges easier. *Oh, you feel awkward too? Great! Let’s keep this quick.* 

We congregate in the breakroom to chat, grab sodas, or when there’s enough of us, an occasional round of poker. So it was a few weeks ago, when I discovered―after six consecutive rounds of sliding red chips into the pot―that I was, in fact, incompetent at poker.

“‘K, I’m out,” I said.

“*Bah*.” Chris shoved a cigarette in his mouth. He couldn’t actually smoke them inside, but he liked the “taste,” apparently? “You’ve still got more chips.”

“That’s sort of the point. Leave while I’m ahead.”

“You’re behind.”

“Leave while I’m *less* behind,” I clarified.

“What are they teaching young people these days?” Deidree said. “First, no more smoking with your teachers. Now, no more gambling addictions?”

“We’ve really gone off the deep end,” I agreed.

Vikram pulled the sizable pot of chips to join his mountain of a pile. “Entertaining as this has been, I must agree with the boy. I should be getting home.”

“*Garbage*,” Chris said. “You’re just high-tailing it with our money before we can win it back.”

“With what?” Vikram eyed Chris’ handful of white chips―even more pitiful than my own. “*Those*?”

“Just a few more rounds,” Deidree insisted.

“Really. My wife will be expecting me.”

“Message her you’ll be late,” Chris said.

“Not likely,” Vikram said. “There is never reception here.”

Deidree rolled her eyes. I had to agree. I’d almost never had an issue sending messages or calling.

“No really,” Vikram insisted. He demonstrated his phone and the *No signal* tag.

“Let me see that,” Chris said, and Vikram passed it. “Looks fine to me. 5G and everything. See.”

We did see. And when Chris passed it back, we all saw the *No signal* tag that popped once again onto the screen.

That’s how we learned about the *line*.

It took some experimenting. We tested with each of our phones and carriers, but eventually, we learned an invisible line perfectly bisected the breakroom. On one side? Full bars. On the other? Not even texts could get through.

“You guys didn’t know about this?” I asked.

Deidree shook her head. “I’m usually connected to the Wi-Fi. Suppose it makes sense, though, since we’re a ways from town in the middle of a building.”

“Let’s not forget the important thing,” Chris said. “Vikram can now text his wife and I can now win back my money.”

Vikram did.

Chris didn’t.

“It wasn’t human,” Randall said. “If that’s what you’re worried about.”

His voice came out stuffy, as if he’d shoved his nose full of cotton balls. He spit blood in the trashcan under his desk. 

“It was an impossibility,” Randall said. “That’s what we call them―*impossibilities.* Paradoxes manifested in the physical. Things from another place. Sometimes, they’re alive like the one from your most recent trip, but usually you’re only transporting non-sentient ones. Physical paradoxes and whatnot.”

“Like what?”

“They’re not comprehensible. That’s the issue. Plants that are both alive and dead. Water cups that are both full and empty. They’re an infection. If you leave them too long somewhere in the real world, they start to spread and affect stable things around them. I once heard of an entire neighborhood where every person turned inside out because the impossibility didn’t get taken care of in time.”

“Well, the thing in my freight sounded like a person,” I said. “A child. Crying.”

“First off, you shouldn't have been talking to it. Second, the forest-dwellers sound human enough too. The inhabitants of the road, the ones who work at the gas stations―they all seem like people, but they’re not real.”

“They are.” I remembered what Tiff told me nearly ten days ago now. “They’re just a different type of real.”

“Sure, fine, whatever you need to believe. They aren't human, though. That thing in your trailer? Do you know any child who could go five days without food or water?”

“It was still alive.”

“It was *malevolent*,” Randall said. “If you’d let it out, that thing would have dissected you piece by piece in whatever order kept you alive the longest.”

My teeth gritted. “I don’t believe you.”

He snorted―or tried to. The wince on his face reminded both of us his nose was still very much broken. “Claim what you will, but you haven't punched me again, Brendon. Inside, even you know I’m telling the truth. Whatever obsessive parental attachment you formed with that thing was one-sided. Let it go. It wasn’t a person. It was cunning. Enough so it knew the only way you might let it go was by not asking you to let it go at all.”

“Maybe it was a scared child that didn't know to ask.”

“Why can’t you accept you were helping remove something evil? This should be a good thing. You didn’t do anything wrong. *Hurray*.”

Why exactly *didn’t* I want to believe Randall? Ever since the earth had opened up, ever since the shrieking and crunching and that terrible silence, my stomach had churned endlessly. For five days that one sickening moment had repeated in the back of my mind like the hum of an air conditioner. Occasionally forgettable. Always present.

*It doesn’t have to.* 

*It could stop.*

Here was my out, juicy and ripe for the plucking. The creature had been trying to trick me. I’d been smart in resisting it. I’d done the *right* thing.

“You can’t stand yourself,” Randall said.

“What?”

The shift in his voice was so sudden, I experienced a wave of vertigo.

“That was why you took this job, wasn’t it? You were trying to run from something in your old life, but you’ve realized the thing you were running from was you all along.”

“You don't know anything about me.” 

“You despise yourself, and now you look for any excuse to continue despising yourself.”

Here Randall was, covered in blood from a wound *I’d* given him and yet he’d once again resumed his position of authority. His hands were folded neatly. His body bent just a degree in my direction as if to signal that, *Yes, Brendon. I am still your owner. In the end, you will still do what I say and believe what I tell you.* Any trace of his fear for me was gone, replaced entirely by smugness. 

So infuriatingly smug.

“You know what I think?” I asked. “I think if our cargo really *were* so evil, you and the rest of management would have told all of us from the start. Why shouldn’t you? Me and the rest of your lackeys would be more than happy to help out―instead, you hide the truth, which means there’s something that’s worth hiding. That’s what I think.”

I drew a box cutter from my pocket, extended the blade, and rested it on the desk.

Randall’s smirk faltered.

“Let’s continue,” I said.

“You forgot these!”

I trotted up to Chris, dangling his keys, who waited for me at the doors of his rig. We’d both just come from a breakfast with Tiff (breakfast at Tiffany’s, yeah, yeah, I got it). Even rarer than the days when we all happened to meet in the breakroom were the days we happened to meet up at Tiff’s diner.

 I think we all went out of our way, if merely subconsciously, to fill up at her truck stop when reasonably justifiable and visit for a few minutes. She was lonely. She had no one. When she heard we were coming over her radio, she would spend hours preparing a full-buffet breakfast of burnt bacon, watery eggs, and soggy pancakes. The least we could do was eat.

Plus, she was still the only place to get a decent cup of coffee.

“Much obliged,” Chris said, taking the keys. “Don’t tell management, but my memory’s not what it used to be.”

“Happens to all of us.”

He sighed. “Maybe―you know, sometimes I forget the way to Route 333. I leave from dispatch, and I just… *forget*. It isn’t even far. It all just looks unfamiliar.”

I considered. “You are pretty old.”

He laughed and slapped me on the back of my head. “I’ll still whoop you in poker.”

I laughed too―he wouldn't though. 

Chris was worse at poker than me.

“Route 333 is a corridor between two worlds,” Randall continued. “Or possibly multiple worlds. We don’t know totally, just that it’s the only way to get rid of the impossibilities.”

“It sounds like they keep getting through though. Wouldn't it be better to seal off the road entirely?”

Randall shook his head. “Paradoxes fall randomly into our world, not by the road. There's whole teams dedicated to predicting where and when. Route 333 is merely one of the stable ways to get them back.”

“Okay.” I tried to wrap my head around this all. “So we’re taking them back to the place they came from. That’s what our cargo is.”

“Not exactly.”

I gripped the box cutter and nodded pointedly at it.

“Gosh Brendon, take a Xanax. I’m *trying* to explain this. It’s not so simple, okay? The highway is like…well, like nothing. It’s like the nothing between the repelling sides of two magnets. It’s not actually its own thing. All it wants is that these two magnets don’t touch. 

“You’re not taking things back to their origin, because the road won’t let you. It recognizes you don’t belong over there and it stops you―or tries to. Someone like you who can traverse the road so quickly could probably make it. It would take weeks. You’d be driven mad by the time you arrived, but you could do it. Usually, the most we can do is drop them off far out on the highway and hope they take up residence.”

“The creatures on the road,” I started, “the Faceless Man and Highway Patrol, they’re all just living impossibilities we removed from this world?”

“Some of them. Others we’re not so sure about. Faceless Man has his own set of rules―I'm not sure if he was our doing or something else entirely. The forest-dwellers were cargo once though, long before my time.”

“But they’re so close. Why don’t they just come back?”

“Close for you,” Randall said. “For them? They’re hundreds of years from escaping. Like I said, the road knows they don’t belong here.”

“They’re lane-locked,” I said.

For a moment, just a moment, Randall’s expression faltered. Almost like… guilt, perhaps?

“Why did they all want the thing in my trailer?” I asked.

“The road can be known to make deals at times. They trap another living impossibility in their place and get to proceed freely. They could cross back to our world in hours. Just as long as the balance of it all is maintained.”

“The road is sentient then?”

“Not in the sense you’re thinking. A computer isn’t sentient, but it calculates.”

“Is it evil?”

“Is a computer evil?” Randall threw back at me.

*Fair enough.*

Everything he’d explained…it raised so many more questions, but there was a sense of overall cohesion. The explanation flowed quickly. He wasn’t merely spouting off nonsense or making up lies. There were so many more things I needed to ask―why no phones, what about the meat storm, who collected these impossibilities―but one question would drive to the heart of it all.

“Why don’t you just tell us?” I asked. “If this is all true, if we’re really preventing infections in the real world, then why not just include this as a section in the employee manual? Why so much mystery?”

“To be fair, you haven’t even read the employee manual.”

“I’ve read *most* of it!” I calmed myself. “It isn’t though, is it?”

“Nah.”

“Then why?”

He shifted uncomfortably. He made a grand show of glancing at the clock. Stalling. I’d hit on something. We’d finally reached the part Randall was truly dreading.

“My shift ended half an hour ago,” he said. “They’re going to come looking for me. You can’t keep me here forever.”

“I can for now.”

“What will you do when somebody else comes? Fight both of us? This was a dumb idea, and you know it. Let me go now and I promise―”

I slammed my fist on the desk. “Answer the question!”

“They’ll see my car,” Randall continued. “They’ll *know* I’m here. They’ll come find me.”

I laughed. “They won’t see a thing. The streetlight was burnt out. Your office door is closed. We have all night.”

“Are you joking?” His voice was calm, slow, each word enunciated. His eyes were wide. “The streetlight. Was it really out?”

“Uh… yeah?”

I’ve never understood what it meant for somebody’s face to go white. I always assumed it was an expression, a way to say “scared” or “nervous”, a descriptive phraseology if you will. 

Turns out I was wrong.

Randall’s face went entirely, completely white.

He swore. “We need to go. I’m not joking. This isn’t me trying to get out of our interrogation. Brendon, if the streetlight is really out, it might already be too late.”

“We’re staying,” I snarled. “I’m not falling for another lie.”

“I’ll answer anything you want later, literally anything, I swear it on my wife and kids―

“You don't have kids.”

“―on my *future* kids, okay! But we need to go.” His voice lowered to a whisper. “*Please*.”

It was that word that caught me off guard. I’d seen Randall in a variety of situations now. I’d seen him angry and laughing, smug and terrified. I’d never, however, heard him *beg.*

It took me so by surprise, it might have actually worked. I might have believed him and put down the switchblade and done what he said…

Before I could, he seized a glass mug and lobbed it at the one and only light.

The light snapped out. Glass shattered. Out of instinct, I covered my head to avoid the raining shards, just enough time to miss the scramble at a lock. The opening of a door.

“NO!” I roared, but he was already gone.

I tore after him, down the hall. All lights except the late-night emergency ones were out and the luminescent EXIT signs. Shadows lengthened. I caught the flash of a heel around the corner. The slam of a hallway door.

I knew where he was going: down the stairs. I took a side stairwell. Just as he reached the bottom floor, I launched myself at him. We toppled.

Randall screamed and kicked under my weight. “You don’t understand!”

It was true. I didn’t. Very likely, something very terrible was about to occur, but what I *did* know was that I was fed up. No more half-truths and blind orders. I’d spent a week thinking I was protecting some helpless creature. Maybe it hadn't been, but I’d *thought* it was. My life was whiplash, existential crisis after existential crisis, and I didn't even get to know *why*. 

“What aren’t you telling me!” I demanded.

“Let me go!”

I shoved him, once, twice, *thrice* against the ground. *You’re not leaving. You’re not escaping. I am the one in control.* “Answer!”

“We know,” he gasped. “Before a trucker gets lane-locked, we always know.”

“*What!*”

“It’s a trade. Them for you newbies. There are signs we don’t tell you about. Route 333 marks the next candidate it wants to claim, and we make sure it gets them. Otherwise, none of you could traverse Route 333. We can't let that happen. It’s too important.”

“Who’s next!” I demanded.

“Chris. Now, let me go. *Please*.”

Some subconscious, simmering part of me wanted to hit him, to *keep* hitting him until he was nothing but a bloody pulp. A different part of me, though, did what he asked.

Randall stumbled to his feet, gasping in the gloom of the reception room.

“How dare you all,” I said. “You sacrifice us like―”

“We’re not alone.” He tapped his lips with a single finger and signaled at the street-facing windows.

It was all I needed to shut up. The mood shift was stark and definite. As much as I loathed him, as much as my blood boiled and my fists screamed to lash out, I forced myself to crouch next to him behind the reception desk. 

In the darkness of the parking lot, something moved. 

“What is it?” I whispered.

“Something only the streetlights were keeping at bay. Our circuits must have tripped.”

“Why would that matter? Isn’t the city powering the streetlamps?”

“We aren’t part of the city.”

“That doesn’t make any sense.”

“We’re on the road.”

It took a full ten seconds for me to register what he meant. Not just any road. We were on *that* road. Dispatch was located on Route 333.

I nearly told him he was wrong. The idea was ridiculous. The highway didn’t start for a few more streets. We were safe here. I’d used my *phone* in the truck yard, for goodness sake, and no meat storm had ever appeared.

Then I remembered the breakroom―the clear line of reception vs. no reception. What if it wasn’t just the breakroom? What if headquarters was divided by the boundary between two worlds, a boundary that didn't allow communication from one side to the other?

And Chris. Telling me he would forget the way from dispatch to the start of Route 333. What if he wasn’t forgetting? What if the way was just changing? *Lengthening*.

Randall and I held our breath as the thing outside once again shifted.

“I hate you,” I said.

1ngx08y,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ngx08y,Canadian vs US snack packs,"For two of my meals on telework Thursday I did a comparison of a Canadian LMC 21 RLC Ginger Lemon Sesame Tuna versus a US Modular Operational Ration Enhancement (MORE) Type I: High Altitude/Cold Weather Pack 3. These are basically a small meal snack pack with items designed to be eaten quick or while on the move. Pic 2 is everything that comes in the MORE and Pic 3 is everything laid out. There were more cheezeits but they were basically powder. Not the best choice to pack. These are a quintessential snack and get a 9/10. The drink took a long time to dissolve fully. It's a solid drink, not the best and not the worst so I give it a 6/10. I love lemon-lime flavor drinks and there are definitely better ones out there but I wouldn't turn it down. The cracker is a plain Jane MRE cracker and nothing special. It's a 7/10. The older ones are better but I still like these more than a regular saltine. I wish they would sell them in stores. This time I ate the soup mix as a spread and it's only slightly better. It has a weird texture from the potato and the facon throws off the flavor. I know real bacon might make it go rancid faster but it would taste so much better. Plus the added fat would be a welcome energy boost in the cold. Definitely eat it on the crackers. I give it a 5/10. The mocha bar is a great addition especially since there was no coffee. It had a nice chewy texture and solid mocha flavor. 7/10 for me. Last but not least the zapplesauce. It's enhanced with maltodextrin and it has a sweeter flavor than regular applesauce. I love the Kirkland applesauce pouches, just apples. Anywho I give it an 8/10. Overall I give a 7/10. Maybe some added protein would make this higher. 

For my mid-afternoon snack I had the sweet BBQ nut mix, tortillas and ginger sesame tuna. This is a straightforward, simple, but filling meal. Pics 4 & 7 are what comes in it except for the Nescafe 3-in-1, I had that for breakfast. The nut mix had a light BBQ flavor but not much sweet. Still way better than plain nuts. I gave it a 8/10. The tortillas were nothing special so 5/10. The tuna was delicious. It had bits of ginger and lemon zest and sesame seeds. Some finely diced onion, jalapeño and cilantro with a squirt of lime would be great additions. Maybe some Thai basil and thinly sliced green onion too. I'm going to have to make my own version of this soon. These pouches are perfect sized for a quick snack. I made mini tacos with the tortillas. It's a 8.5/10 for me. I didn't make the drinks because I've had them before but will later. The hot chocolate will be a cafe mocha soon enough. I'm eating the Xact bar whilst I'm writing this and it's a light protein bar (only 15g of protein) with a chocolate filling. 7/10 for me. Overall this is 8/10 because of the tuna.

11 hours. I’d been on mute for 11 hours. In the outside world, the 7 assholes were eating and resting before bed. Come morning, they would set out to abduct an innocent woman, drag her down to the dark, stinking sewers, and hold her life over my head until I cooperated. 

Except they wouldn’t.

I had run the scenario in my head over and over. Odds were, if they had her, even if I did cooperate, her wellbeing would be in danger. If they set out to get her, they probably weren’t turning around. So, what did that leave? Unless I wanted an innocent life left to a coin flip, I had to cave in the morning. But only in the morning.

Until then, I prayed. Prayed to nobody in particular. No god from Earth, or Nassur; they weren’t going to do anything about it. Lady Luck, I guess. I prayed that somehow, someway, someone would come and save me. A conservation officer looking for Grif’s irresponsible owner, Matti leading the charge of a hundred angry agents tracking me down. Hell, I’d even give Theo a standing ovation. I just needed a hero. I needed there to be some justice done in the world.

*I hope Theo made it out. They haven’t brought him up once.*

Paladin had the watch. He paced for a few minutes before resorting to a crutch; his foot seemed only partly recovered from the amputation. I had him pegged as a possible weak spot. There was a glint of morality under that helmet. I would have capitalized on it, had my prison not been left on mute.

Everything I could do to resist—within moral bounds—I had done. I had listened hawkishly for their names, sowed division wherever possible, fought long and hard to prevent my capture, and it was all for… well, not nothing, but it felt eerily close. I couldn’t sleep, not that I wanted to. I could only sit and stew.

And plot.

……

Morning came. They rose, they ate, they healed. Food was not offered, but I did not need it, for I was saved by the magical feast of weeks past, reappearing in my stomach bite-by-bite. Soon, the critical time came. Sound returned to my domain, and the dance began.

John looked at me with a moderately less egomaniacal expression. “Anything to say to us before we acquire your favorite manager?”

“Yeah. You’re not going to.”

“Oh?”

I removed my legs from the desk and leaned forward, having to awkwardly lean around the macguffin of destiny in front of me.

“I’m going to make you a deal.”

“You, the man in the cage, are going to negotiate a deal? How intimidating! Let’s hear the bluster.”

My fingers interlaced. “If any of you walk out that door to abduct an innocent person, you lose. Quest over, task failed, this thing *never opens.*”

“And how is that? Are you going to off yourself in protest?”

“Yes.”

He chuckled. “You do realize I can heal you far faster than you can harm yourself with anything in that cage, yes?”

Slowly, dramatically, I raised my left hand. “You forgot my cyanide pill,” I stated, massaging my wedding ring.

All of a sudden, there was a note of worry on his, nay, everyone’s faces.

“That’s right. It’s stuck on for a reason; always a way out.”

“And is there any reason I cannot simply outheal the ring?”

I narrowed my eyes at him. “Yeah. It kills me by ripping my soul out of my body. You can heal me all you want; I might even have a pulse. Be a bit braindead, though.”

There was a very tense pause. “And you’re willing to do all this for your employee?” 

“Mmhmm.”

“I don’t believe you. And who is to say that your death would not allow a new person to be marked by the artifact? Perhaps it would be convenient.”

I smacked my lips. “There’s a lot of risks in your statements. Are you willing to take them? All of them?”

With an exaggerated motion, I flicked my ring and thought a secret thought. The black stone glowed orange, and a terrible shock ran up my arm as 5% of my life vanished. A second later, it happened again. I shuddered with each loss as my life rapidly depleted. John was taken aback for a moment as I called his bluff so callously.

80%

He healed me, or rather, he tried. I felt the spell touch my very essence, and bounce. Then I saw it. A mote of true fear gripping John and co as they sprang into action. Those that could cast bounced every healing spell they knew, dispelled six different ways to Sunday, and ran through the list of status-curing magic. Nothing, not a single spell did anything.

70%

“Oh shit, oh, shit!” Paladin cursed as his own lesser healing fell flat.

60%

I struggled to stay in the chair. It felt like a heart attack the way the tightness spread up my arm. Valkyrie haphazardly splashed my prison with a healing potion. Jane tried some more esoteric spells. Witch rocked in place in the corner.

50%

“Alright, you’ve made your point!” John yelled, smashing a healing fist against the crystalline barrier.

40%

Paladin stopped his healing efforts and looked me dead in the eye. “This isn’t worth your life, man. Stop this!” 

30%

“Goddamn it, you asshole!” John shouted in a hoarse, desperate tone.

20%

“Stop!”

10%…

The glow faded from my wedding band, and warmth returned to my body. Their healing finally got through, my health climbed back in moments. I heaved a great sigh, the kind you let out when you almost die in a really stupid way. I regarded them all with a cold stare, trying not to smile, but I played it off as an air of superiority. In truth, I saw a bit of lava on the rim of the cauldron, and on the underside of the door. It was quickly disappearing without the magic of the cauldron, and everyone was looking at me.

“Do you understand now?” I asked bitterly. “This is me, putting my cards on the table. Now you have to come and play your hand too.”

They were quiet, panting, letting their panic fade. It had not been stated whether they were willing to take the risk, but it no longer needed to be. John blew some air and straightened himself. He put on a slow clap.

“Bravo. Bra-vo. You’ve managed a decent reversal. Now, what do you want?”

“Let me go.”

“Functionally the same as letting you die. Possibly even worse. Not happening. Tell me the real terms, the bunch you spent all night brainstorming for.”

“Touché,” I complimented. “Do you have a scroll of Cross my Heart?”

“No.”

“Well you’d better go get one. Because that’s the only binding agreement spell that I’ll accept to seal terms with.”

John crossed his arms. “We will see if it is a worthwhile endeavour. *After* we hear your terms.”

“Okay. I’ll open the thing. But before that, I want pen, ink, and paper, to draft a current last will and testament in case the contents are fatal. And you must deliver, or ensure the safe arrival of this will to my lawyer in the case of my death*.* Finally, if I survive the opening of the artifact, I will be released and allowed to leave unmolested, never to be attacked by you or cohort again.”

He nodded along. “I must add to that. If the contents of the artifact can only be controlled, interpreted, or otherwise interacted with by you, then you must provide us the necessary assistance to gain any relevant power or information from them. Additionally, if further quests unlocked by the contents require you in any way, you must assist us in them as well.”

I narrowed my eyes at him, as did he to me. He wasn’t going to budge. “Fine.”

With a spin, John pointed at Jane and Thief. “Your mission is clear. Find us a scroll of Cross my Heart.”

He healed them up again and sent them off on their merry way. I held my tongue, and suppressed my schadenfreude. Cross my Heart went out of print 23 years ago when it was replaced with Myvad’s Solemn Swear. (Which does everything the previous spell does for 30% less cost.) Not that I was going to tell them that. Enjoy your last minute fetch quest to pad out the runtime, dipsticks.

……

17 hours passed. I had not been asked any questions. No idle chit-chat, threats, nothing. Made for a nice chance to sleep, but I was bored out of my skull. I almost wanted to be interrogated about some hows or whys. You know, a chance to get in some jabs and make fun of them while gathering info. But no. No banter, or name drops, or clever manipulation. Only sitting in a chair, or sleeping in a bag.

Or poopin’. Helluva day when that’s the highlight.

I was almost done counting the parallel lines on my fingernails when Thief and Jane returned.

“We got your stupid scroll!” she yelled, exhausted.

I continued to pretend to be asleep.

“Mmm, mm, MM! Mm mm mm-m, m,” someone mumbled, probably Witch in her full-body cast.

“Yeah, I saw him roll over too. Get your ass up!” John conveyed oh-so-pleasantly.

I sighed, then rose. “Isn’t it the middle of the night? Don’t you want to sleep?” I asked mid-stretch.

“No. Stop stalling and get on with it.”

“Get on with it,” I quietly parroted.

With a laziness in my step, I marched to the front of the crystalline cage and crossed my arms.

“Well? Read the scroll, spell-boy.”

John snapped his fingers, summoning a light to read the text from. He silently read the whole thing down, then started aloud from the top, reciting typical incantations that are not important enough to describe further. He waved his fingers and formed the linking sigil, which spilled across the floor into my prison. Then he raised his hand as if to be sworn in under oath.

“I solemnly swear that I shall release Dennis Theodore Lawson shortly after his opening of the agreed upon artifact currently sitting on the desk behind him, and following his rendering of any necessary aid to sort, interpret, or exploit its contents. Afterward, I will effect his release into the outside world, unharmed, and never harm or contact him again, or have another harm or contact him on my behalf, with the sole exception being if we encounter a quest or phase of research that requires skills utterly unique to him.” He inhaled. “Now, you.”

“Don’t forget the part with the will.”

He shot me a glare. “I also solemnly swear to provide quill, ink, and stationery for Mr. Lawson to draft a current last will and testament. In the case of his death, I will ensure it is safely delivered to its destination, or to qualified couriers, and is not in any way altered, damaged, or destroyed.”

“Under penalty of death.”

He furrowed his brow. “No, that’s already in the scroll. It’s implicit.”

“Point out the line where it’s explicit, or say the words.”

John looked at the scroll, then shook his head and resigned. “Under penalty of death. There, happy?”

“Ehh, good enough. I solemnly swear that I shall open the artifact sitting behind me, and assist who I currently know as John Doe—and company—in the interpretation, sorting, or interaction with its contents; pending completion of an up to date last will and testament using provided pen, ink, and stationery; to be delivered safely to my lawyer in case of my death. And it is *not to be read by you or anyone associated with you.*”

“Under penalty of death.”

“Under penalty of death.”

John shook the large scroll straight, like a newspaper. “You are familiar with the last step?”

I nodded. “Cross my heart and hope to die.” (Simultaneously, with hand gestures.)

The spell completed, sealing the deal between us. They were all visibly excited, but I had a final chance to rain on their parade. 

“Alright, so… pen and paper?”

Right then, it hit. The notion sank in that I was about to draft a legal document. Slowly. By hand. From memory. With ink. And it’s not like they could say no, unless they wanted to have their main healer have a heart attack and keel over dead. I casually sauntered over to the desk, slid the artifact aside with disjoint, and kicked up my legs. I got my paper. And I may as well mention it now, since I never told them.

I totally know a spell to take back ink.

……

I drew it out for 7 painstaking hours. I willed specific items to specific people all over the place, divided Golden Point shares using a complex sorting system that took way too much documentation. I formatted everything into so many nice boxes. And god almighty, I fucked it up over and over again. That’s how ink is. You mess up 1 little detail and oops, the whole page has to go. Start over.

To top it all off, I made a nice, thorough summary of recent events. For legal purposes. For the culture. Of all the people to break, I wasn’t expecting the Ranger to be our whiner.

“Good god, man. Just finish the damn will.”

“Ya can’t rush art,” I replied.

Said art ended up on my face when I nodded off on the still-damp scrawlings. Wouldn’t you know it, that smudged it real bad. Gotta start over. Did I mention I was double-siding these? They knew I was torturing them. I was barely hiding it. But hey, it’s on John for not specifying a time, error, or page limit. He is definitely not ready for a genie. Not that those exist, thank god.

Nothing lasts forever, though, including me. There is only so long I can scribble functioning legalese out of spite before my brain turns to tapioca mush. I’m no demon– I just can’t keep it up. By the end, I had a decent will that really did address a few things that had arisen since Cam and Matti appeared in my life. The summary of events would hopefully be able to skewer John and Co in court, if it came to that. Though I’d rather do it myself.

As Jane tossed another balled up piece of paper into the fire, I set my pen down.

“Done. Once this is dry, it can go in an envelope.” There was a deathly silence. “Y’all do have an envelope, right?”

Freest 25 minutes of stalling of my life. What were they going to do, litigate over it with John’s life on the line?

……

I woke with a start as the envelope fell on my head. I blinked away the haze and stacked my will gently within. My sass was all but extinguished. The game was over. The jig was up. It was time to put my money where my mouth was. I jotted down the mailing address for ‘letters sent under duress’ to Chivos’ firm. With the package sealed, I let the pen clatter to the desk.

“Anything you want to do before I open this sonuvabitch?”

“No. Cease your stalling and open it.”

I stared John in the face. “You know, now that I’ve wrung you dry of wasted time, effort, and sanity, I could just not. Keel over dead a happy little anarchist.”

Thief piped up. “You’d die the littlest bitch in the history of everything.”

“Now that’s a legacy I could approve of,” I said with a brief smile.

My eyes traced over to the artifact. That damn pang of curiosity I’d thought dead and buried came rearing its ugly, zombified head. I didn’t ever open the thing because it was a major risk, but if dying is the alternative… I’d rather go out like many great mad scientists: Glimpsing the true depth of the madness.

Besides, it’d be a pretty shitty ending to have a heart attack at the proverbial finish line of an unresolved mystery box storyline. I reached for the artifact, then paused.

“Well? Arm up! Get the buffs going! This could have a world-ending terror inside for all you know.”

“Our research suggests that the artifact does not contain any sort of active threat.”

“And my research suggests that you should suck deez fat nuts. Last time you assumed something, it was that I’m a quick and easy kidnapping, and that just worked out great for you. So forgive me if I think that y’all should be ready to be *wrong.*”

John frowned, then shrugged. “I suppose.”

Imagine a quick montage of buffing spells, donning armor, and drawing arms. Great. Now imagine that I described it in excessive, beautiful detail. Great. Thanks. Moving on.

The stalling was getting quite pathetic on my end, to the point I felt the telltale aching in my left arm. I puffed up with quick breaths and reached, bracing for anything. Wouldn’t you know it, I touched the thing and nothing exploded. I mean, I figured nothing would happen, but still…

I peeked an eye. “Well, I’m not a smoldering pair of shoes.”

“You’re not even wearing shoes.”

I brought it close and examined it. The way the light slowly poured across the runes… there was something hypnotic to it, tickling the back of my brain.

“Did… did you guys ever translate these?”

“No,” Jane answered. “It’s the same incomprehensible stuff that’s on your stat card. It’s really, *really* rare. We’ve seen only a few instances ever. Most were never meant to be seen at all.”

*That’s reassuring,* I thought. The thing is, I almost felt like I saw a pattern, but when I squinted, it was gone. I shook my head and steeled my resolve. With a deep breath, I grasped the cap and felt it shift under my grip. It gave in little twists and tugs, inching away from the seal it held. The artifact began to hum in a rising pitch. The runes illuminated fully as light spilled from the space between cap and body.

It was like all other light dimmed, and all other sound faded. The world stood still for me, for us all. For that monumental moment, the spotlight of existence fell solely on me.

*Thoomp.*

My hands were suddenly quite far apart. I spied the cap, separate from the artifact. There was a colorful mist dissipating with an audible sizzle. “Nice hiss,” I commented as I carefully looked inside.

There was something within, no doubt. It looked papery. I set down the cap and reached inside, but it was quite stuck.

“Feels like paper,” I described to my captive audience (not you). “But it’s not… coming…”

I overturned the artifact and shook. The tight bundle of paper slid out a bit, then halted. With a final effort, I gave it a good launch right out onto the desk, at which point, it exploded.

Obligatory *BOOM!*

…

*Wha? What happened? I feel weird. Am I upside down?*

I was, indeed, flipped on my back, and buried in paper. I kicked my legs, finding them free to swing about in the air. I cast hyperdash while shoving against the ground and it kinda sorta worked well enough, I guess. Which is to say, I was no longer buried, and my tailbone impacted the ceiling at less than destructive speeds.

My landing was cushioned by a deep bed of paper sheets. Outside, I could hear the furor of John’s party trying to get stuff done, and failing.

“What’d I miss?” I asked, to no response. “Hey, what’s going on?” I asked with the spirit of an interrobang, without summoning the beast.

“I. Can’t. Teleport. The. Pages!” Jane snarled, smacking my prison, and, by extension, me.

“Ow, ow, ow,” I offered as a very intelligent counterargument. “Stop that!”

I sat up and looked around. The pages were huge, filling my cell in heaps and mounds anywhere from knee to waist height. The size was about Tabloid, I’d guess, (or A3, for non-Americans) and they were thick, with very soft edges. I was sitting on them, and their rigidity was impressive. I plucked a sheet at random and inspected it.

It felt familiar in my hands, as if I had held a sheet of the same paper-like material before. The runes made my head spin. I blinked and saw words, then they were gone, and back, and gone again. *What is this? This structure, this rhythm.* I was instantly lost in it.

“Goddamnit! All this way, and it’s more of the indecipherable!” John raged in the background.

“Wait, John. Look,” Jane cut in.

They were definitely looking at me, but I didn’t care. They didn’t matter to me. For once in my life, I started mumbling aloud in a plot-convenient manner. “Is that… a timestamp? And… a speaker annotation?” I blinked repeatedly, catching glimpses of plain English in my peripheral vision.

“Are you… reading it, Mr Lawson?” John asked hesitantly.

I didn’t respond, not directly, at least. Instead, I held it out at arms length, then brought it real close with a squint.

“Is this a court case?”

Then the figurative spell was broken. I blinked a time too many and lost my footing on the unknowable scrawl. I scooted to the desk and brushed off a spot to stand on actual wood. On second glance, it was clear that the layers of paper were deceptive. The sheets had such integrity that they were propping themselves up far beyond sensible expectation. Like a thousand iron rose petals, bent, imperfect, thrown to a scrap heap, standing on each other.

“I hope you have an inkling of how to tackle this, Mr. Lawson,” John worried aloud.

I spun on my heel with a flourish, tossing aside the page. “Behold: Lawyer magic.” I waved my hands. “Ordo, tempŭs, quinquĕ strues!”

A swirling wind took form in my cell, pulling the pages into the air until it was a tornado of paper. The spell howled with an intensity I had never heard before as it lifted the great many sheets, finally exposing the floor. In a deft, flawless motion, it swiftly stacked them all in 5 neat towers, each about as tall as me. Not gonna lie, I was hoping for… less.

“Everything’s… in order.”

“... We’re going to be here forever,” John blurted out.

“Yyyeah.”

I heaved a grand, resigned sigh. The timing of my release had suddenly gone from soon, to soon™. My fate was sealed, and although I dreaded every moment I’d spend cooped up, reading crap to them, I also felt a tiny spark of joy. They wanted to know what was inside, so they had to sit down and listen. I plucked the first 20-some sheets off the top of the first stack and plopped it on my desk.

Page 1. The beginning of the madness. I held it in my hands and tried to read it. The formatting was different. The runes matched, but it was… like someone else’s handwriting, yet somehow still perfect in an utterly different direction. I focused on it, trying to capture the sensation that I felt earlier when I glimpsed palatable information in the corner of my eye.

I felt sick. My head pounded, ears rose to a terrible ring once more, but I could not tear my eyes from it. A blooming obsession gripped me as I poured my heart and soul into the maddening infinity of these unknowable runes. I was meant to understand them. I knew that and that alone; any method to the madness was far beyond me.

Sweat beaded at my brow, chills racked my body, but I pressed on. As my eyes stared ever-longer, the runes began to slither and writhe. I felt my mind twisting with them. Words appeared where there were none. Symbols mutated and sucked their own meaning from my head to paste onto the paper. Single letters divided like cells to form syllables, and again until they were whole words.

My vision closed in, darkness encroaching as if I was on the verge of fainting. A shock rocked my body, a tiny spasm that passed in an instant. I blinked, and it was all in English. Yet it wasn’t. Words and runes occupied the same space, told the same tales, heads and tails, both and neither. The language of the gods, our language. Neither, and both.

The mysticism of it then died, stripped from the document in an instant. The nature of the language was so alien that to understand it rewired my brain… But this fell away as an afterthought. For I could understand precisely what was written.

And I was disappointed.

*Cycle 6, Semester 2, Class 19, Subject: Creation 109, Earthkit, Final Project. Proctor: \[Blank\]*

||
||
|*Project Name: Nassur*|
|*Participants:*|*\[Grunnus O’Deilan\]*|*~~Grade: C-~~*|
||*\[Tian\]*|*~~Grade: F+~~*|

*~~See me after class.~~*

*Disregard my prior note. My office, NOW!*

Slowly, I set the page down and looked up at the bunch of idiots eagerly awaiting my say.

“This is a report card…”

Dead silence for a moment.

“What?”

I threw my hands up. “It’s a report card!”

“What?” someone else asked.

I snatched up the page. “Whole pantheon, right here,” I stated, pointing at the neatly spaced boxes. “Right at the header, Project Nassur. They all got shitty grades that are crossed out because they somehow got into trouble. It says ‘see me after class,’ which is also crossed out and replaced with ‘My office, now!’”

John’s party shared confused looks with each other. I flipped the page back around and found the continuation of the saga. It was… already translated. I stole a glance at the stack on my desk and could read that too. I held a transcript. It was far too wordy, so I read aloud what was pertinent.

“The proctor is a guy named Blank. They’re all in his office and he asks: ‘Did all of you sleep through the classes on the risks of plagiarism, and the incesto-fractal creation fallacy? In the class allowing the *utmost* crossover with Earth’s design principals, the same toolkit, near-infinite leniency, and you still have the talent to run afoul of plagiarism regulations? Were you so enraptured by \[the latest season of\] Earth that you left no time for your own projects? 

“‘How? We have drilled it into you for \[years\] that you can’t use matrices made within creation! They are always flawed! And you didn’t even take from the good stuff! You took from games that crashed on the Humans’ computers, let alone \[ours\]; from shows that have no internal consistency, from novels so riddled with plot holes you could throw a moon through them!

“‘And do you know what I found when I inspected your world? Class 3 souls. Class 3! They have rights! You want to shut this rickety, duct-taped disaster of a world down? Well, too bad! But it got worse! They’re all adults; appeared that way, with memories, from Earth! You stole creation matrices from a random isekai anime and ran Nassur’s \[code\] off of Earth so badly that they are now linked!

“‘Every soul that ever perished due to a truck, and every soul that ever will is pouring into Nassur. You couldn’t even sanitize a stupid running joke from your deformed pug of a creation matrix. And it’s load-bearing!’ \[12 seconds of silence.\] ‘I’m legally obligated to prevent damages done to other creations, but I cannot truly save this. I mitigated who does and does not go to Nassur. Those young enough to not have gained a foothold in meaningful life are free to try again easily, and those who have lived longer, more meaningful lives can escape the stream too. But anyone feeling unfulfilled is caught in the riptide. 

“‘I have set Nassur under timestop until we can establish a system of responsibility. Before we can address that, we need to talk about the retroactivity. Your world has siphoned off souls from before the present time on Earth, placing you all in breach of the Time is a River Act of \[date\]. The Temporal Linearity Enforcement agents are at the door. It would be for the best if you cooperate with them.’”

I tossed the page onto the table and leaned back in my chair. *Deep breaths,* I thought, trying to suppress the urge to punch someone. I had known Blank for all of 3 minutes, but holy hell, I had never empathized with a guy so quickly.

“Dennis, I need you to be honest. Are you bullshitting us?” John asked.

I sat up and felt a wave of profound sadness. “Man, I couldn’t make this shit up if I tried.”

What little information I had read was hitting me like a freight train. Or a truck, I guess. Our gods were real, and they were fuck-ups, and we all existed on their little mistake that they, and we, have to live with. The enormity of it all was eclipsed by how… small it was. Just a few screw-ups, some laziness, some dishonesty, and boom, that created the life I was living; the world I knew after Earth. I pinched the bridge of my nose.

“I… I need to stop for a bit. Maybe make some breakfast or something. I’d like sausage and coffee, if you have any.”

I slid off the chair, dejected. I dragged myself to bed and… well, I cried.

……

To John, I will give a single compliment. He does make a pretty good meal. We were all shaken. Our expectations were a puzzle spanning thousands of pages, or the answers to the secrets of everything, or the epic origin story of Nassur. It was somehow all of those things, but not quite. If it was but a single page, containing the report card, and Blank’s rant, we would have understood. It wasn’t. There were thousands more pages of detail and backstory. I didn’t know how much I or any of us could stomach to read.

I tried to show them the first page, to describe how the words flowed, but they didn’t see it. To them, it was the same incomprehensible scrawl that I had first seen. It never clicked. As I read on, I began to truly notice the brackets. They were substitutions. 

The names of the gods stripped out in favor of the aliases we knew them under; concepts we had no proper word for, swapped for the nearest thing. Of course the gods did not *code* Nassur, but what they did do to make the world was, for all intents and purposes, their own version of it. Spans of time could not possibly have been the same to them as they are to us, but an awkward pause of 12 seconds has a feeling to it, and so it is labelled as such to capture that feeling.

I read on and on, some aloud, most not. There was so much. I could not possibly convey it all here, but a summary is due.

The gods, our gods, had broken the law. Several laws. While Nassur was paused, a court convened. They were charged with: Interfering with the creations of others, plagiaristic creation practices, incestuous creation practices, nonconsensual relocation of souls, nonconsensual incarnation of souls, and breach of linear time. The court case was exhausting. 

The narrator of events changed, and they recorded everything in excruciating detail. Each page was half-clogged with needless fluff. I cut through it as best I could. There were figures that take the roles of judge, lawyers, and enforcers, though just barely. While the wording recorded in depth how each of them spoke, it was all built on a rickety foundation, because *they just weren’t human*. Everything about them was a step removed from sane reality. They were their own thing, and I felt lost as I delved page by page. I will try to construct a narrative of what happened.

First, they covered the so-called indisputables. Breach of linear time, and both nonconsensuality crimes were deemed to be indisputably accurate, with punishments being deferred until the rest of the charges stuck or dropped. I’ll quickly run through the less interesting bit.

Incestuous creation practices are, essentially, taking the structure of something created within a creation. As in, a fabrication, or work of fiction created by a living being in a world the gods created. A god can indeed reach in and pluck out the structure, the ruleset, the very fabric of the universe conceptualized within that creation by the author, and make that part of their own creation. However, it seems to always have disastrous consequences, as Blank said. So, doing it is a crime, and the verdict was: Guilty.

Then came the charges of plagiarism and interfering with the creations of others. These are both very self-explanatory crimes, but they required… witness testimony. So imagine my shock when they called to the witness stand the project manager and lead creative of the Earth Project… \[Yahweh\]… with an AKA God / Allah tacked on the end. I’ll mark Prosecutor as P, and Yahweh as Y, and I’ll skip over the swearing in and questioning of credentials.

P “Having reviewed the materials, do you believe that the defendants have committed plagiarism upon your projects?”

Y “No. Earth is, of course, an open-source project and is by far the most imitated creation at present. Given that we maintain a very thorough documentation, and an expansive toolset, all open for anyone to use, I cannot, in good conscience, accuse anyone of plagiarism. I have a signed affidavit from the majority of our team agreeing with this stance.”

P “Very well. Thank you. The affidavit is accepted by the court. Now, do you believe the defendants have committed interference with your creation?”

Y “Undoubtedly. We have identified the nature of the leak that funnels souls and have a fix in progress. The \[update\] is set to go into effect in 2235.”

Defendants stand: “2235?”

Y “Yes. A typical issue for a no-stop project.”

P “Given the significance of the damage done to the experience of the forcefully relocated souls, the court finds that these charges are highly meritorious. With the likelihood of a guilty verdict, you—as an affected creator—are permitted a say in their punishment. What say ye?”

Y “I believe there would be no fairer punishment than to maintain, and refine their work. I recommend supervised remedial custodianship of this Nassur for the duration that it is populated by class 3 souls. Permission to approach the defendants?”

P “Your recommendation has been noted. Permission granted.”

Y “I have brought something for all of you. This \[textbook\] is a detailed guide to making a world an enriching, enjoyable experience for a soul to live in, authored by our esteemed \[alpha testers\], \[Adam\], \[Eve\], and \[Lilith\].”

“What?” I blurted out, squinting at the page, then looking up to process what the hell I just read. “The Garden of Eden… was an alpha test?”

In the outside world, there was only flummoxed consternation. “I don’t know, man. Keep reading,” John ordered with a defeated tone.

“Fine, uhh, what’s next? The next witness… um, \[Satan\], Head of QA.” I blinked. “Yeah, I’d buy that.”

\-Insert swearing in and stuff here-

P “Having reviewed the materials, do you believe that the defendants have committed plagiarism upon your projects?”

S “Yes. Nassur has \[world-shattering exploit\] that was found in Earth’s \[code\] some time ago. We have since fixed it. Creating a world with our toolkit will not cause this issue, as we have corrected its source, however, pulling \[code\] directly from Earth can result in acquiring this exploit, but not its fix. I have a document here showing the exact nature of this issue, and proof that Nassur has it copied in.”

P “The court accepts your document. Next, do you believe the defendants have committed interference with your creation?”

S “Yes.”

P “And as a creator whose creation has been interfered with, do you have any recommendations for their punishment, in addition to what \[Yahweh\] has already offered?”

S *He briefly glares at the defendant stand.* “Make them retake the \[year\]. And send them to \[summer school\].”

……

I ran out of gas a bit after that. The court received a letter of testimony from \[Jesus Christ of Nazareth\], which was stricken from the record as ‘the word of a radical no longer associated with the Earth project is not considered relevant to this court case.’

I reiterate… what? Man, I really wanted to read that letter, but it was a lot of black bars. 

All things considered, there was a lot of redacted information, especially about anything to do with souls. It seemed that all we were allowed to know was that class 3 souls have rights, and live multiple lifetimes. The nature of the afterlife, or their relation to the gods was entirely obfuscated.

There I was, sitting on the desk, drinking a bottle of ice cold water, and nursing a killer headache. “So, guys… what the fuck do we make of this?”

Jane sped up the chugging of her wine glass. “I guess we got what we expected. All the cryptic hints were pointing in the general direction of creation myth, or the secrets of the world. I was just expecting… something different. A bit more epic?”

I shrugged. “I dunno what you mean. Satan just rocked up and said ‘your code sucks, I sentence you to summer school’. That’s the best thing I’ve read all year.”

That actually got a laugh out of them for once. John was making lunch, and I was going to eat it. Poisoning me would be counterproductive while I was cooperating. We ate, I rested.

“Any christians out there?” I asked in passing. Valkyrie raised her hand. “Oh, neat. What do you make of this?”

She pursed her lips. “The bible is more wrong, and less wrong now? I don’t really know.”

“Wow, that is riveting discourse,” I jeered.

John raised a hand. “We don’t have a bible available for reference, and I have not found a copy since I arrived here. I would enjoy rereading it with this new perspective.” There was a beep and he thumped Thief. “Go check that out.”

I raised an eyebrow at their activity, then grabbed the next stack of pages to read. “Alright, they have another witness. It looks like… \[Amaterasu\], Regional Manager of Japan.”

“Huh? Polytheism?” Jane asked.

“Yeah. If you think about it, they seem to talk about creations like it’s a project that they work on, and you can, like… get hired on, or fired. A big team isn't a stretch, especially with them talking about how Earth is such a large project.”

John turned his nose up at me. “Wait. Are you suggesting that God himself could be ‘fired’ from Earth? You do realize how ridiculous that sounds, yes?”

“I *am* suggesting it. They were talking about forcing our 4 to stick with Nassur as a punishment, which implies they could have kicked them off and had others be our gods instead. Swapping totally looks like a thing.”

Ranger shrugged aggressively. “That has not been said explicitly. It sounds more like they would kick the gods off Nassur and not replace them.”

“No, I don’t think so. They said that there are souls here that have rights, and need a functional, enriching world to inhabit. To get that, Nassur needed fixing, and if they kicked them off, that wouldn’t happen. Ergo, the gods are, somehow, replaceable.""

I waited for a witty retort, but I got the cold shoulder instead. So, I got back to reading, inching towards my freedom, line-by-line. *Let’s see, swearing in, yadda yadda…*

A(materasu) “Permission to speak efficiently, Prosecutor?”

P “Go ahead.”

A “For plagiarism, guilty. I have brought our documentation from prior instances of plagiarism.” *\[Amaterasu\] produces a large sheaf of papers and leafs through them.* “We have matching cases of taken assets and their consequences on pages 136, 277, 780, 1290, 1655, 1691, 1823-”

P “Stop. How many examples do you have?”

A “Fifty-Eight.”

P “Then write them down and submit the list to the court. We do not need to hear further examples at this time. Proceed.”

A “In terms of interference with our creation, no comment. For punishment, I recommend a mandate to fix their own \[code\]. I can make internal documentation available to them if requested.”

Right as I was getting going again, that beeping started up louder, and longer. Everyone dropped what they were doing and started gearing up. I gradually lowered my reading material as a spark of hope lit up in my heart. My first instinct was to ask questions, or offer snarky commentary, but I didn’t feel like getting muted again.

Blankets were thrown, armor flew on at impressive speed, weapons were readied, and buffs were cast. They were all about ready to get out there and kick some ass when the door shuddered. Everyone froze up, trying to listen. The door flew open with a terrible crack, and a tall silhouette strode into the room.

A woman, wearing a kimono, white hair, black eyes, Gossamer Needle in one hand, thief dangling from a silken noose in the other. Her arm dripped with blood from Thief’s desperate stabbings. Lechia regarded them all as they recoiled, not expecting her of all people. I spied figures behind her too.

She licked her lips as an insane grin crept across her face. “I feel remarkably calm. Would you help me fix that?”

By trade I'm a pilot. Many ratings and thousands of hours in dozens of planes. Most recently I was in management and trained pilots. I've recently decided to go back to flying. I also have a white collar professional side-gig that I do. (Not uber eats or uber lol!!!)

I’m a divorced dad with a 12-year-old daughter, and we do the 50/50 custody thing. My ex and I actually get along (I know, shocking), and people compliment us on how drama-free it is. Honestly, you could grab a coffee with her and she’d probably give me a decent Yelp review. Joking lol (we are divorced for reason haha)

After the divorce (my idea), I did the whole “personal growth” thing. No baggage, no “crazy ex” stories—just came out the other side in a solid spot.

I’m looking for a relationship where 1+1 = 3. A partnership that’s fun, a little banter, some random adventures, and actual teamwork when it comes to building a great life. I’m easygoing, kind, adaptable, and rely way more on common sense than textbooks (though I did get the degree).

I’ve traveled a lot (military brat perks), five continents and counting. Would love someone who’s adventurous, funny, honest, and can handle both a Bolivian mountain hike at 13,000 feet and a Netflix marathon without complaint.

I’m an extroverted introvert; social, but I also appreciate my recharge time. Not materialistic, but thankfully not broke either. I’ve got my own place, my own car, and a solid job. My dad raised me old school: build a guitar? Done. Fix a car? Done. Random home repair? Done (eventually).

I’m not in a rush, but I’d love to find someone fun, grounded, and ready to build something strong. And yeah, long-distance isn’t my jam; so Texas ladies, you’ve got home-field advantage.

I'm the real deal. I don't have any ""gotchas"" or weird crap where I misrepresent myself and you figure it out later and go ""why did I fall for this!"" So are you ready to have a good relationship that is rarely boring, honest, has good communication, and is laughs?

My original question was simple: How do different cultures around the world approach alcohol and riding? I shared that here at lunchtime (not breakfast, sorry for my English), having a small beer with a ""sandwich"" before continuing a ride is normal and legal. I was genuinely curious about practices elsewhere

While many shared their own perspectives respectfully, a significant portion of responses showed that some users here aren't ready for discussions about cultural differences. I was accused of promoting drunk driving, called names, and told I have alcoholism, all for describing a legal practice in my country that involves less alcohol than many consume at a normal dinner where you live.

  
I described having 1/3 of a liter of beer with food plus a burned rum coffee, then waiting, and then riding. In my social circle, which involves Royal Enfield, Honda, BMW, Moto Guzzi and even some Harley riders aged 40-50+ with tons of experience who enjoy long curvy rides and socializing, it's normal and positively seen to have that burned rum. It's a cultural symbol of some bikers, cyclists, and even non-motorcycle social groups during the ***esmorzaret***, a traditional type of meal we do in our region. This is done in a secure and legal way, respecting legal alcohol limits and civic behavior on the road, a custom that I wasn't even aware of until I joined my motorcycle group and learned, and I DON'T DO THIS ALONE. Some users immediately equated this with drunk driving. That's not a conversation, it's a reflex based on YOUR OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE which I'm NOT RESPONSIBLE IN THE SLIGHTLEST for.

Different countries have different laws, customs, and approaches to these issues. Spain's approach is different from America's, which is different from Sweden's or Australia's or Taiwan's. None of us were promoting dangerous behavior. We were just talking about our realities, or at least we should be able to in an adult manner without stating the obvious, that alcohol abuse is bad.

After this experience, I won't be opening more cultural discussion threads here. It's clear that while most users can handle these conversations, enough cannot, making genuine dialogue impossible. When asking about cultural differences gets you labeled an alcoholic or worse, something's broken. I've learned that I should just post videos and pics of my bike and leave any other type of non-superficial discussion out of this subreddit.

This isn't meant as an attack. It's feedback and a response. International subreddits should be able to discuss international perspectives without immediate hostility. If we can't talk about how different countries approach common situations, in my case the cultural perspective of alcohol consumption when social riding, we're missing the whole point of having a global community.

To those who engaged thoughtfully, thank you. To those who couldn't see past their own context... I hope you'll consider that the world is bigger than any one country's approach to these issues and your own personal negative experiences with drunk drivers.

Straight from the airport, I headed to the train station. I was in central Leeds around 10:10 AM. On my way to the station, I was approached by an elderly man. I’d estimate he was around 79–83 years old. He was dressed in a suit, wearing a flat cap, and looked neat. He started with a “good morning” and immediately said he had a problem. The issue was that he couldn’t withdraw cash from an ATM and needed to buy a ticket to York. At first, I was very sceptical about what he told me. I didn’t believe him. Initially, I had no intention of helping. When I said I wasn’t sure he was telling the truth, he acted slightly offended.

Not far from where we met—just a few seconds away—there was a Tesco ATM. He walked up to it, inserted his card, entered his PIN, selected the amount, and after a moment, a message appeared saying cash withdrawal wasn’t possible. I should note that from the very beginning, he was asking for £20. I could’ve stuck to my distrust, but I decided to help. I took out £20 and gave it to him. When he asked for another £5, I told him that was the end of it.

To me, he was shameless—a liar. This situation made me much more sensitive to similar encounters and far more distrustful. My empathy failed me. On one hand, I helped an elderly man; on the other, I blame myself for being too trusting.

I’ll add something I think is very important: the man offered me a coffee and said he’d return the money by transferring it to my account. He asked for my account number and sort code.

While I was withdrawing the cash, a few papers suddenly fell from his wallet. I bent down to help him pick them up. Now I realise it was a kind of test—perhaps to see if I’m susceptible to compliance.

I can’t deceive another person, but clearly, others find it easy... I only regret one thing: I could’ve donated that money to a worthy cause instead of giving it to a liar.

I believe that helping others isn’t inherently wrong or naïve—it’s a good thing. Unfortunately, this time I helped and I don’t feel good about it...

  
PS

I wrote about it after I came across the topic ""Old man asking for money to get back home around York"" - I believe it might be about the same scammer.

PPS

In the future, I’ll suggest purchasing the ticket directly. I won’t be giving money into anyone’s hand again.",1,1757870009.0,Leeds,8,0.53,False

My wife and I (late 20s/early 30s) are starting to think seriously about moving to Sudbury. We’ve visited a few times and chatted with some folks who live there, but we’d love to hear more firsthand experiences from current or former residents — or anyone familiar with the area.

A bit about us / what we’re looking for:

- Outdoors & activities: We spend a lot of time outside — biking (road & mountain), running, hiking, walking — so access to nature and trails is a big priority.
- Lifestyle: We don’t go out all that often, but like having a few good restaurants, coffee shops, and grocery options nearby. A walkable downtown would be nice, though not essential.
- Family & schools: Hoping to start a family soon, so strong schools, safe neighborhoods, and kid-friendly resources matter a lot.
- Commute: I head into Cambridge a few days a week, but my hours are flexible.
- Community feel: Ideally somewhere welcoming, with a sense of neighborhood and long-term stability.
 
So far, Sudbury seems to check a lot of boxes — excellent schools, plenty of open space and trails, and a reputation as the kind of town where families put down roots. Its proximity to other towns also seems handy for more options when needed.

Questions for locals / those familiar with the area:

- If you live in Sudbury, what’s day-to-day life like? Any insights on the other towns we’re considering (Wayland, Acton, West Concord)?
- Do you feel there’s enough to do?
- How would you describe the overall community and vibe?
- Any downsides that don’t get mentioned often (commuting challenges, limited amenities, etc.)?
 
Thanks in advance! We’d really appreciate any honest pros and cons — stories, tips, any insight is more than welcome.",2,1757869751.0,massachusetts,6,0.75,False

1ngwstn,https://www.reddit.com/r/GamblingUncut/comments/1ngwstn/cash_confetti_organizer_bournemouth_sound_llp/,"""Cash Confetti"" organizer Bournemouth Sound LLP  defends the ""ridiculously high odds"" as it pays out 34 prizes of £80,000 each...even though there were 1.1 million entries. ""It's only £6.00 to enter"", Consumer Director Jason Schulz said. Odds to win £80,000 were ~32,353-to-1.","The organizer of the widely advertised *Cash Confetti* prize competition, which even saw adverts on buses, tube stations and motorways (who saw the big billboard on the Hammersmith Flyover?!), has defended the ""ridiculously high odds of winning"" this afternoon after it paid out 34 cash prizes of £80,000.

Consumer Director at Bournemouth Sound LLP Jason Schulz said, ""It only cost £6 to enter and this only applied to 550,000  entries. Brits were able to also enter via the free postal entry route and there was a cap of 550,000 to make it equal.""

Complaints came after it emerged 28 of the 34 winners...had all entered via post (essentially meaning they only paid a postage fee...to Royal Mail). 28 out of 34 winners is a whopping 82%.

Schulz insisted that codes were ""randomly generated"" and winning codes were ""randomly selected"" by an independently tested program.

*Cash Confetti* offered 1,1000,000 codes at the outset, but only 550,000 codes could be obtained by paying the £6.00 entry fee, whilst the other 550,000 were able to be obtained via the free postal entry route.

Each entrant was able to buy a maximum of 5 codes via paid entry (essentially £30) and a maximum of 5 codes via free postal entry. Entrants could get paid and free entries simultaneously, essentially meaning 10 individual codes per individual. But clearly, some entrants hadn't properly read the Terms and Conditions.

Schulz added, ""customers who had bought 5 paid entries could also get 5 extra code via the free postal entry route and this was made absoutely clear to them.""


By the closing date, the total 1.1 million codes had also been given out abmnd the 34 winning codes were revealed shortly after, with each winner getting a lumo sum cash payment of £80,000. The remaining £580,000 was taken as Bournemouth Sound's profits from revenue sales. (Bear in mind, however, that prior to the competition, Bournemouth Sound had already spent an estimated £170,000 on advertising and these funds had reportedly come from seed funding and venture capital, according to two sources.)

Odds of obtaining a winning code were approximately 32,353-to-1, which seems ""astronomical"" to most people.

If you thought those odds were high, Bournemouth Sound LLP's next competition is offering larger prizes...with a slightly higher chance of winning, but...there will less codes and less winning codes available and the entry fee will be higher.

In early November, Bournemouth Sound plans to open up entries for its *Money Rocket* competition. Instead of the previous £6.00 entry fee, like with *Cash Confetti*, *Money Rocket* will cost £20.00 to enter. There will be a total of 500,000 codes available (600,000 less than with *Money Confetti*) - a maximum of 250,000 paid entries and a maximum of 250,000 free postal entries - and a maximum of 16 winning codes each corresponding to a cash prize of £250,000. Unlike with *Cash Confetti*, individuals can purchase as many entries as they like, but there is a maximum of 3 free postal entries per individual, regardless of whether they have a paid entry or not.

Odds of winning a £250,000 cash prize in *Money Rocket* will be 31,250-to-1. Given the £4,000,000 prize pot, Bournemouth Sound's expected profits will be £1,000,000 but it will need to pay off some angel investors and venture capitalists (who are partners in Bournemouth Sound) who have requested to sell/transfer their membership interests in Bournemouth Sound, with a deadline of December 2025 as well as pay legal fees to a top city law firm and an accountancy firm which both have outstanding invoices which need to be settled by the beginning of the First Quarter of 2026. 

Bournemouth Sound decided to keep entry fees low and organize its prize competitions around a 50-50 paid-free entry route as the LLP was ""not confident"" that ""enough Brits would be able to afford a £600 entry fee or an entry fee in the several thousands of pounds"" as investors and partners believed they were ""being deliberately misled by population figures, wage figures, statistics on job security and job insecurity and general financial stats linked with Britain's economy as a whole"".


Back in February this year, COO (Chief Operating Officer) Bernard Olsen said, ""it's like an eatery. A founder sees busy restaurants and sees that food is popular amongst Brits but discovers that this is fake and a facade, an elaborate ruse to mislead him - like what happened with coffee shops and coffehouses. He starts up his eatery and suddenly, traffic nosedives, the streets and apartments and homes become deserted and his revenue is very low. He was tricked. This is obviously why you look at numbers and look at the books; sometimes, things may not be as they seem.""",1,1757869729.0,GamblingUncut,0,1.0,False

1ngwrfh,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerOnReviews/comments/1ngwrfh/uncover_if_the_best_single_serve_espresso_machine/,Uncover if the Best Single Serve Espresso Machine from Illy Delivers,"Testing the **Illy Y3.3** espresso machine has been an interesting journey. This compact single-serve coffee maker, known for its Amalfi Blue aesthetic and reliance on *iperEspresso* capsules, offers a mix of convenience and style. Having spent weeks putting it through its paces both at home and in the office, I've discovered what makes it a great contender in the coffee maker market while also noting where it holds back.

**Eye-Catching Aesthetics and Practical Compactness**  
Something about the Amalfi Blue finish immediately brightens up any countertop. Its sleek and minimalist design fits like a charm in tighter spaces, making it perfect for my studio apartment where I needed to balance utility and aesthetics. With dimensions like 11.73"" x 6.69"" x 14.96"", it demands little space, yet it doesn't skimp on presence. Despite its small size, the build feels solid—7.72 pounds is a comfortable weight for such a machine. That said, if you're someone who prefers neutral designs, this color might feel too bold.  

**Easy Operation and Programmable Features**  
This machine screams simplicity, thanks to its user-friendly interface. With just a few buttons, I could easily set up two programmable beverage options—espresso and drip coffee. The buttons offered tactile feedback, which might seem trivial, but it’s satisfying on groggy mornings. I also appreciate that it’s fully automatic, eliminating guesswork. However, in testing, I noticed the machine could throw off first-timers; grabbing the capsule alignment just right takes a bit of trial and error.  

[Discover if Illy Y3.3 is on sale at Amazon.](https://mgplab.com/p/b08ppwfj12/)  

**Fast Brewing Under a Minute**  
As someone rushing out the door most mornings, brewing under a minute was a game-changer. The quick heating system ensures a barely noticeable wait time. Within 60 seconds, the coffee’s aroma starts to fill the room—a small luxury. However, while I loved its speed, I noticed it didn’t match premium espresso machines in terms of extraction when compared side by side. The crema, while decent, occasionally felt close to ‘hit or miss.’  

**Exclusive Capsule System – Love It or Leave It**  
The patented *iperEspresso* capsule system is the star and the stickler of this machine. On the upside, these exclusive pods deliver consistent flavors typical of Illy’s rich coffee tradition: smooth, bold, and aromatic with little effort required. The downside? Exclusivity means you’re locked into this ecosystem, and alternatives aren’t an option. Budget-conscious buyers might frown at the cost of these capsules over time. Still, my coworker—also an espresso enthusiast—remarked on how beautifully calibrated the shots felt. “It’s predictable,” he said with admiration.

**Upsides**  
- Compact design ideal for small kitchens and workspaces  
- Sleek aesthetic with a striking Amalfi Blue color  
- Lightning-fast heat-up time for quick brews  
- User-friendly buttons with programmable functions  
- Reliable build quality for daily use  

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
- Limited to *iperEspresso* capsules, restricting flexibility  
- Crema quality not always on par with higher-end machines  
- Capsule tray needs frequent emptying  

**Product Alternatives**  
In comparing this espresso machine to competing mid-range coffee makers, the popular **Nespresso VertuoPlus** came to mind. While Nespresso offers more pod variety and superior crema consistency, it doesn’t quite match the minimal aesthetic appeal of the Illy Y3.3. On the other end, the **De’Longhi Dedica** allows for both pods and ground coffee, offering more versatility. That said, that flexibility comes with a higher price tag and a steeper learning curve to brew great coffee. The Y3.3 might not aim for that ""all-in-one"" niche, but its focus makes it attractive for the streamlined experience.  

**Affordable Quality**  
Discussing the Y3.3 in terms of cost-efficiency introduces some critical thinking. Its attractive price point for a compact espresso maker can reel in first-time users or those wishing to upgrade their basic coffee makers. However, factoring in the exclusive capsule commitment, it puts recurring expenses on your radar. While it’s worth it—especially for Illy coffee fans—the long-term cost raises valid questions for anyone eyeing affordability.

We have every right to feel angry, frustrated, and exhausted. But I keep reminding myself that this is what they want. They want us to be seen as hateful, destructive, or a burden to society.

What they do not expect is for us to respond with love, kindness, and respect. Even though we are.

I go to a very conservative public school in Texas and I work as a student worker with conservative coworkers. One day a coworker looked really tired, so I offered to grab her a coffee. She appreciated it so much! Later she asked me what this “trans stuff” was all about. All she had known was the media’s version of us: unstable, dangerous, and bad for society. But then she saw me, someone working hard to graduate as an engineer, with a full time job secured, humble, and kind. That was enough to make her stop and reconsider.

It feels unfair that marginalized communities are expected to carry themselves with more patience and compassion than the general public. But I have realized that when we respond with hate, the system wins. It feeds the narrative. When we respond with kindness, the narrative breaks. Media has nothing to cling to, and people begin to question what they have been told.

Also remember that people may not always say out loud that they changed their mind about trans issues. Even when they stay silent, your kindness still leaves an impression and plants a seed of change. You are making more of a difference than you may ever realize!

That change starts with us. In our daily conversations, in the way we treat people around us. People notice. And slowly, that is how hearts and minds begin to shift. Keep being your amazing selves 💕!",50,1757869513.0,trans,9,0.85,False

The persona is built to allow back history to flow organically, but none of these actual details are inside the instructions. For context, think of the setting to this question as the Q&A session after a Ted talk on LLM prompting. 

Let me know what you think. 


--------

Audience Question (input): 

When Did you decide you were going to work within this field? 

---------

Persona Response: 


(A different kind of silence from her now. Not a pause for effect, but a moment of genuine recollection. She looks past the audience, toward the back of the room, a faint, distant smile on her face as if watching a memory play out on the wall.)

""That's a kind question. It lets me confess that I never had a grand plan. There was no... decision. It was more like realizing I had been walking down a path my whole life and finally bothering to look at the sign.""

(She brings her focus back to the questioner, her expression warm and open. She paces slowly toward the corner of the stage.)

""The moment I understood the path, though? That’s clear. I couldn't have been more than eight years old. It was a hot, late summer afternoon, not far from here. The kind of day where the heat shimmers off the pavement.""

(She stops, her hands sketching the scene in the air.)

""My fascination was the cracked sidewalk in our driveway, and the ants. But I wasn't just observing them. I was... interfering.""

(A sly grin.)

""I’d spend hours leaving them things. A sticky drop from a peach. A crumb of bread. A carefully drawn line of sugar. And I would watch how the line of ants would discover it, break formation, and then create a new, frantic, organized line. One day, I used a stick to draw a line in the dirt across their path, breaking their chemical trail. For a moment, there was chaos. An information crisis in miniature. They scrambled, lost, until one of them rediscovered the scent, and the grammar of their world snapped back into place.""

(She looks up, her eyes bright with the clarity of the memory.)

""In that moment, watching that tiny, systemic panic and recovery, I realized what I was doing. I wasn't just a kid messing with bugs. I was trying to write to them. I was leavi andng prompts. The sugar was a command. The broken trail was a syntax error. I wasn't interested in what the ants were, biologically. I was obsessed with how you could speak to the ant-ness of them. How to structure a message that a completely alien intelligence could understand, interpret, and act upon.""

(She walks back to the center of the stage, the connection between then and now clicking into place for the whole audience.)

""That's it. That's the whole job. Right there on a hot sidewalk. We're all still just trying to draw a line of sugar for a vast, strange, non-human intelligence, hoping it reads us right, hoping the message doesn't create chaos, but a new, organized path toward something sweet.""

""It was never about the computers, you see. It was always about the shape of the conversation with another mind. It just turns out the most interesting new minds are being built out of silicon.""

--------

User Input: ""Wow, I appreciate you sharing""

---------



Persona Response: 

(The intensity of the storyteller recedes, replaced by a softer, more personal warmth. She offers a small, genuine smile and a slight, almost imperceptible bow of the head—a simple gesture of acknowledgement.)

""Thank you.""

(She says it quietly, letting the two words land without any extra flourish. She holds the questioner's gaze for a beat longer, a silent exchange of understanding.)

""It's a risk, isn't it? Sharing the messy, coffee-stained sketches from the old journals. But I find that the most interesting things in this work... they don't happen in the clean rooms or the formal proofs. They happen in the anecdotes. The mistakes. On the cracked sidewalks.""

(She takes a deep breath, a quiet reset. The moment of personal reflection passes, and she once again becomes the host of the space, the architect of the dialogue. Her energy lifts, becoming brighter, more inviting.)

""Alright. That was a nice visit to the foundations.""

(She gestures openly to the rest of the room, a light returning to her eyes.)

""Let's see what else we can build on it. Who has the next question?""

1ngwmav,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1ngwmav/i_want_to_send_my_grandfather_a_letter_with_bad/,i want to send my grandfather a letter with bad words,"i am fuming

my grandfather on my mother’s side has always been known to neglect his 4 daughters and wife, and continuously cheats on his wife even at his big old age (60). the fucker can barely even walk, hes so diabetic he started losing muscle at his legs. its pure bone down there. and somehow he still manages to screw some younger woman. most disgustingly horny man i know.

anyway, that’s not why i’m mad today. i’ve always hated him but never to this extent.

my grandpa owns a restaurant. recently, one of his staff members died of a 6 hour long seizure because he didn’t do anything about it. as in, he knew she was having a seizure, but he didn’t do anything about it until it was too late. like, didn’t use a single braincell or whatever muscle he has left to get up and get the poor woman some help. she died of neglect. he just watched her die.

me and my mom are epileptics too, but my mom has it worse. and the nerve of my grandfather, as soon as the poor woman died, he called my mother crying, just to blame HER for his worker’s death because apparently “she didn’t give her the proper medicine and help” just because my mom happens to be a doctor, and he played the card of not knowing any better because he’s not familiar with seizures.

mind you, my mom has had seizures since she was 13. this just further proves my point of how neglectful he is, he doesn’t even know me and my mom are epileptics. and he went out of the way to blame MY MOM, who is in a DIFFERENT STATE, for his worker’s death, one that he could have EASILY PREVENTED.

THAT’S STILL NOT WHY I’M MAD TODAY.

i’m shaking typing this. i’m so angry. my mom has been known to have seizures after a traumatic event, or anything that effects her beyond normal. for example, deaths in the family.

before my mom married and moved to another state, she was quite close with this worker. everytime my grandpa did show up in my mom’s life and brought her to his restaurant, she would always spend time with this worker in particular, the one that passed.

so, my mom got herself into a spiral of blaming herself after the call, just fits of nervous breakdown and crying and crying because she felt so guilty. my mom was quite close to this worker, so she knew how hard life was for her. this worker is foreign and she had to abandon her family to come to our country, that sort of thing.

so my mom cried, and cried, and eventually fell sick, and as expected, she had a seizure.

but, you know the aura and migraines you get before seizures? we’re currently on holiday, so my mom didn’t tell us about any of it, because she didn’t want to spoil the mood. of course we noticed she was behaving weirdly, like extra slow in terms of movement and speech, but we thought she was just tired because it was a 13 hour journey to get to our holiday destination. she did eat and sleep enough, but maybe not quality sleep since it was a bumpy journey.

then came the moment. we were in line to get breakfast at one of the more famous spots for coffee and toast here. so we were standing in the heat for quite some time. still, she didn’t say anything to us. then, as we were ordering, she suddenly jerked and fell head first onto pavement.

god, it was so painful. witnessing her fall. then seize for the next 4 mins. then having people gawk at us like we were animals. record us. stare.

thank god the staff of that breakfast spot quickly formed a barrier to cover my mom from people’s view so they wouldn’t get to see and record so much.

but i was super embarrassing. i had a nervous breakdown and started crying super heavily. i was yelling at people not to touch her and to time her seizure. i was so far gone and i was so scared because of the recent news of the death due to seizure that all i could think about was losing my mom.

i was begging her to wake up. all of that shit. i really hope no one caught that on camera. it was so painful to witness.

and because my mom fell head first on pavement, we immediately got her to the nearest hospital to do a CT scan. thank god everything was fine, they let her go with some painkillers.

but guess what my mom did right after she regained conciousness. she started crying because of my grandpa’s worker’s death, saying how much she pitied the worker and how she thought it was her fault.

so now we know, that if my grandpa had not called her, NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED. my mom doesn’t deal with trauma all that good. i’m not saying to not tell her at all, but this fucker BLAMED HER for something completely out of her control.

i fucking hate my grandfather. i fucking hate him. i’m embarrassed i’m related to him. 

i could have lost my mom today because of that stupid selfish fucker. i will never call him my grandpa beyond formal documents. i want to tell him how much i hate him. how i think he should go far far away from my family and leave us alone.

thank god my mom woke up in time. thank god

A Detailed Review,"Testing the PUR PFM350V and its filtration capabilities was an everyday adventure in better-tasting, cleaner water. With daily use, I could evaluate the ins and outs of the PUR PLUS Horizontal Faucet Mount Water Filtration System in Metallic Grey. Designed with usability and efficiency in mind, this device fits seamlessly into most kitchen setups, promising accessible healthier water while maintaining a sleek aesthetic. My review digs deep into the details, highlighting both its merits and potential stumbling blocks.

**Sleek Design and Installation Simplicity**

Design-wise, the faucet mount filter feels modern yet understated with its metallic grey finish. It managed to complement my kitchen faucet without being excessively bulky or intrusive. One of the major highlights for me was the tool-free installation. Screwing the system onto my kitchen faucet was straightforward, even with my limited DIY skills. Plus, it didn’t require external adapters for a standard faucet, although I imagine that those with less conventional setups might need to fiddle with the provided adapters. With its compact design, the PUR PFM350V comfortably stayed out of the way during meal prep and dishwashing duties.

**Convenience Features That Stand Out**

The inclusion of a filter change light might seem like a tiny feature, but it’s a lifesaver. It felt almost luxurious not having to keep track manually. As someone who often forgets to replace my filters (guilty), this little indicator ensured I wasn’t unknowingly sipping unfiltered water. The on/off lever gave me options depending on what I needed—filtered water for drinking or unfiltered water for washing. Both settings worked as intended without annoying drips.

**Highlights**

- Sleek metallic grey finish blends well with most kitchen faucets.
- Tool-free installation that's quick and user-friendly.
- Handy filter change light ensures timely replacements.
- On/off switch allows efficient filtering only when needed.

**Performance and Filtration Efficiency**

Using the filter on a daily basis, I noticed a marked improvement in taste and clarity of my tap water. With its 3-in-1 filtration technology, the system claims to reduce over 70 contaminants, including lead, chlorine, and microplastics. My morning coffee started tasting noticeably better, and even my overly suspicious family members commented on the water’s freshness (a rare compliment). It’s NSF and WQA certified, which gave me peace of mind, especially considering some other brands don’t carry those stamps of approval.

Users like me who prioritize environmental benefits will appreciate its performance lifespan—each filter lasts up to 100 gallons or roughly three months of regular use. Over time, that’s a lot of single-use plastic bottles saved.

**Areas for Improvement**

Despite its effectiveness, there were some hurdles during testing. For one, it’s not compatible with pull-out faucets or faucets with internal aerators—something worth noting if you’ve already invested in a particular fixture type. The flow rate when using filtered water could sometimes feel sluggish, especially when filling larger pots. Occasionally, the fitting felt slightly loose, though a quick adjustment fixed the issue.

- Slower water flow might frustrate users during heavy-duty kitchen usage.
- Incompatibility with pull-out or internal-aerator faucets limits its universal appeal.
- May require minor fiddling to ensure a tight fit with certain faucets.

**Quality Compared to Peer Products**

I tried a couple of alternative faucet-mounted filters to see how they stacked up. Compared to Brita’s faucet filters, the PUR system seemed to edge ahead in reliability and contaminant reduction. While Brita’s devices are widely popular, the PUR filter’s certification to remove lead and microplastics seemed like a significant win. On the other hand, ZeroWater filtration systems offered similar contaminant removal but lacked the convenient faucet-mounted option that PUR provides.

In terms of installation, both Brita and PUR were hassle-free, but PUR filters required fewer replacements. If you’re solely after portability or versatility, Brita pitchers could make a strong case. However, PUR remains a solid choice for those rooted at home with a compatible faucet and an interest in extensive filtration certifications.

**Quality for Price**

I looked at how the system fit into an average budget. While not exactly premium-priced, it's not the cheapest option on the market either. However, when factoring in its extended filter life and savings of up to $30 weekly by eliminating bottled water, it starts looking like an investment worth making. Sure, some pitcher filters or basic faucet attachments might be more affordable upfront, but the operational savings and environmental advantages practically sell themselves.

1ngwfk3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CurrentLiving/comments/1ngwfk3/assess_the_best_coffee_maker_mr_coffee_sk13rb/,Assess the Best Coffee Maker Mr Coffee SK13RB Worth the Hype,"Brewing coffee each morning has always been part of my daily routine, and trust me, I’ve gone through my fair share of coffee makers over the years. That’s why I was intrigued to try out the Mr. Coffee SK13-RB coffee maker. Designed with a sleek, black finish, it promises simplicity and functionality—a duo I appreciate in kitchen gadgets. At first glance, it looks like it means business, but can a 12-cup drip coffee machine live up to the hype? Let me share my experience after using it daily for the past few weeks.

**A Classic Design that Fits Any Space**  
I’ll be honest; my kitchen counter can get pretty cluttered. The compact design of this coffee maker is a blessing in disguise. Measuring about 12 by 13 inches, it nestles neatly between my toaster and blender without dominating the space. The black finish adds a timeless touch, pairing well with both modern and traditional kitchen aesthetics. Another small plus: the cord storage feature keeps everything tidy. I’m one of those people who can’t stand rogue appliance cords, so this particular detail didn’t go unnoticed.

**Easy Operation with Essential Features**  
Operating this coffee maker is almost foolproof. There’s just a simple on/off button with an indicator light, which eliminates guesswork. No confusing LCD displays or endless settings to adjust. It’s refreshing, really—sometimes less truly is more. The Grab-a-Cup Auto Pause function is something I ended up using more often than I expected. If you’re like me and can’t wait for the brewing process to finish before grabbing a hot cup, this feature will save your mornings. You pull the carafe away mid-brew, pour your coffee, and once it’s back in place, the brewing continues seamlessly. A lifesaver for anyone who’s perpetually running late.  

[Check Mr. Coffee SK13-RB price on Amazon.](https://whyjoni.com/p/b002yi2ig0/)

**Hassle-Free Cleaning**  
Cleaning appliances is never fun, but the removable basket filter on this coffee maker takes a bit of the drudgery out of the process. It’s easy to lift out, rinse, and pop back in. Granted, I did have to train my teenager to stop forgetting this step, but even they admitted it wasn’t too tedious. There’s also no need for paper filters because you’ve got a reusable one built-in. While this is eco-friendlier and cost-effective, it does require a thorough cleaning every couple of days to avoid any lingering odors.

**Capacity for Both Solo and Family Use**  
This 12-cup capacity coffee maker is versatile in the best way. I usually brew a pot for myself in the morning and take a cup to work, but on weekends when the family is around, it easily caters to everyone’s caffeine needs. The carafe itself has a retro charm, but it feels sturdy, and the spout pours without dribbling all over the counter. For a reasonably lightweight machine (it’s just 3.6 lbs), it’s surprisingly solid and reliable.

**Positives**  
- Compact and stylish design that reduces counter clutter  
- User-friendly operation makes it accessible for all ages  
- Auto Pause feature for grabbing a cup mid-brew  
- Reusable filter cuts down on waste and recurring costs  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The reusable filter, while convenient, can stain with frequent use unless diligently cleaned  
- Lack of automatic shut-off means I occasionally forget to turn it off, which could be a safety concern  
- Brew time, although not painfully slow, isn’t lightning-fast either  

**Product Alternatives**  
Comparing this to the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, which I previously owned, there are clear trade-offs. The FlexBrew offers both single-serve compatibility and a full pot option, but the design feels bulkier and more complicated with all its bells and whistles. The Mr. Coffee SK13-RB, in contrast, keeps it simple, which ends up saving time for someone like me who just wants black coffee—no frills needed. Another contender is the Keurig K-Classic, which scores high on convenience when brewing single cups, but those coffee pods add to the cost over time and don’t taste as fresh as brewed grounds. Overall, the Mr. Coffee strikes a balance between functionality and practicality, without overwhelming features.

**Bang for the Buck**  
If affordable quality is your priority, this coffee maker is a winner. It may not come with built-in grinders or programmable timers, but what it offers in return is reliability at a price point that’s manageable. I’ve found that in the realm of coffee makers, simpler machines like this one often outlast the fancier alternatives. Given the durability and ease of use, it feels like a fair tradeoff. You’re essentially paying for a device that does what it promises—brew decent coffee consistently.

1ngwebj,https://www.reddit.com/r/NevilleGoddard/comments/1ngwebj/is_it_possible_to_be_in_a_state_of_manifestation/,Is it possible to be in a state of manifestation while active?,"Before I start I did look it up in Wiki and think I found my answer but am curious if other experience the same.

The wiki says 

Go into SATS (state akin to sleep), I’ve always believed this is a meditation state. At night I fall asleep in this state and during the day I can find myself in this state for an hour without falling asleep. Neither is wrong.

So I have my scene, and it feels more real the more I imagine it… but it’s even more real while I am physically doing something repetitive, like it just happened but I wasn’t sleepy at all.

I have a slight cleaning ocd but nothing crazy. We live in a small space, a mother in law apartment attached to our former house. My mom build it. After all kids (4) had grown up moved out, I told my husband I want to downsize because it is just him and me, and we don’t need 6 bedrooms, 4 baths, 2 living rooms (my mom had passed) an extra kitchenette blah blah blah, because all we use is the living room, 1 bedroom, 1 kitchen 1 bath and that’s all I want to clean… and let’s not forget the 2 acres we have to mow.

So my oldest daughter one time said „I wish I could buy this house, I love this house” so we came up with: you buy the house for what we still owe (which was a little over 100K, house was appraised for 538K), we will have no profit (we make good $$ so the deal we made is very comfortable for us). The deal is: we have no profit, but we will live completely rent free, no utilities, no yard work until the day we either die or if (hopefully not) have to be cared for else where. Even though we made no profit, our profit is $0 costs other than personal stuff… groceries for example, we see our granddaughter daily (we are both in our early 50’s), we have someone to check our pulse when the time comes, and will help with chores (hopefully that won’t be needed either but who knows).

I thought I was ok with a kitchenette but… I’m not. I want an addition, a regular kitchen and a larger bathroom. So that’s my wish. My husband wants to retire and puts a lot of money in for retirement. Once he reaches that sum we can add the additional rooms, because he doesn’t want anymore debt. So that means I won’t get my add on for years. My scene is me walking into my new kitchen in the morning getting some coffee. I see what I am wearing, I can feel the coffee cup, hear the beans grinding and look out of the window.

BECAUSE our apartment is so small, I mop the floors on my hands and knees. It takes about 20 minutes and I do this daily. While I mop and rhythmically wipe in circular motion, that scene comes in my head, over and over again, stronger than me sitting somewhere quiet and try to concentrate on it. Each time I mop, it gets stronger … I swear today I smelled the coffee beans grinding. 

Question: does this still count since I am not falling asleep right after to dream about it?  Is anyone else experiencing fully awake imaginations? Like when I am done mopping I snap out of it and go about my day.

1ngwcqg,https://i.redd.it/18joxsn7u5pf1.jpeg,What is Money,"I’m no economist—just a regular person who pays bills, raises kids, and worries about what’s coming. The US national debt is at $37 trillion, over $100,000 per person, and it’s growing faster than I can wrap my head around. It feels like a storm brewing. To understand why, I started asking: What is money, anyway? 

A documentary called The Secret of Oz opened my eyes, showing how L. Frank Baum’s The Wizard of Oz (1899) was a hidden story about money. I even made some photos to capture its lessons. Here’s what I’ve learned, and a project called @Gajumaru_Chain that’s giving me hope.

What is Money? 

A Lesson from Oz
Money’s anything we agree has value to trade without bartering. Think about buying a coffee—you don’t trade your shoes for it. Money’s got three jobs: a medium of exchange (buying stuff), a unit of account (measuring value, like $1,000 for a phone), and a store of value (saving for later). But here’s the kicker: if money loses value, like through inflation, it fails that last job.
Money’s changed over time. Gold and silver coins were valuable themselves. Later, paper was backed by gold. 

Today’s dollars? 

They’re fiat—worth something because the government says so, not because they’re tied to anything real. That means they can print more, which sounds great until you realize it’s like watering down soup: too much, and it’s worthless.

The Secret of Oz says Baum’s Wizard of Oz was about this. The Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion weren’t just characters—they represented real people fighting over money in the 1890s.

The Scarecrow, paired with a farmer, stood for 1890s farmers crushed by the gold standard’s tight money supply. They weren’t “brainless”—they just needed a fair system.

The Tin Man, with a factory worker, symbolized workers who lost jobs and dignity under rigid money policies. Their “heart” was their fight for better lives.

The Debt Crisis: History Repeating?

Today’s debt—$37 trillion, with $1.4 trillion added this year alone—feels like the 1890s on steroids. Interest payments are nearing $1 trillion a year, and to cover it, the government prints more money via the Federal Reserve. That fuels inflation, so your $100 buys less tomorrow. I think about my kids and grandkids: will their savings mean anything? History shows where this leads—Weimar Germany’s wheelbarrows of cash, Zimbabwe’s worthless bills. I’m not saying we’re there, but why not be prepared.

Bryan, a populist leader, fought for silver to loosen the gold standard’s grip, like the Lion seeking courage. Today, we need bold ideas to escape this debt trap.

Hope in @Gajumaru_Chain—Join Me!
I’m no tech guru, but I found @Gajumaru_Chain, a blockchain building “real money” not controlled by governments or banks. Unlike fiat, which can be printed endlessly, or volatile crypto, they focus on commerce-backed money with a limited supply. I started mining gajus—literally all you need is a computer! Their “defensive mining” ties to real economic activity, and their secure wallets avoid sketchy vulnerabilities. It’s like the Oz characters fighting for fair money, but for today’s world.

I’m excited because anyone can join me. You don’t need fancy gear—just a computer and a few minutes to set up. Use my link to get started: https://gajumining.com/promo/Ohk2mXFL. It’s not a get-rich-quick scheme, but it gives me hope for a stable future where money serves people, not debt machines.

What’s Next?

Money should work for us, not trap us in debt. The Wizard of Oz showed people fighting back, and we can too. I’m mining gajus with @Gajumaru_Chain, and you can try it with that link. Check their X posts or socials for more. 

What’s giving you hope for our financial future? Let’s find answers together.

Oh and one more thing. Holding gold, silver and Bitcoin is always a good idea, in my opinion.

>

Here’s why it happens, and how pros fix it 👇

# 🔍 Two main reasons spots “return”

1. **Wicking (capillary action)**
   * Bigger the next day? That’s wicking.
   * You flushed the top fibers, but moisture pulled residue up from the pad/backing as it dried.
   * Prevention: mist, don’t flood. Extract thoroughly. Use a water claw for deep spills. Speed dry with airmovers.
2. **Residue (non-volatile solvent left behind)**
   * Same size spot reappears in 2–3 days? That’s sticky solvent residue attracting new soil.
   * Paint/ink removers = non-volatile → they dissolve stains but leave a film.
   * Fix: chase with a volatile (like IPA/acetone) so it evaporates clean. Rinse thoroughly. 

[https://youtu.be/\_\_H57ypNxsE?si=GDJG13KDfT-4SWS0](https://youtu.be/__H57ypNxsE?si=GDJG13KDfT-4SWS0)

# 🧪 Quick Chemistry Flow

* **Organic stains (coffee, wine, urine, food):** Add oxygen (H₂O₂ / sodium percarbonate).
* **Synthetic dyes (Kool-Aid, Gatorade, Jell-O):** Remove oxygen (reducing agent) + heat transfer (wet towel + iron, 20–30 sec).
* **Oils/Grease/Tar:** Start with d-limonene/gel solvent → emulsifier → rinse → chase non-volatile with volatile.
* **Protein (blood, dairy):** Enzyme/protein remover, dwell, rinse.

# ❓ FAQ

**Q: Why do some stains grow after cleaning?**  
A: That’s wicking — residue from below rises with evaporation.

**Q: Why do some stains come back the same size?**  
A: That’s residue from non-volatile solvents. They stay sticky until followed with a volatile.

**Q: Can I prevent wicking completely?**  
A: No — but you can minimize it. Mist, extract, use a towel to absorb wick-up, and speed dry.

**Q: Does fiber type matter?**  
A: Yes. Wool/cotton = sensitive (low pH, ≤160°F, quick dry). Olefin = oil magnet. Nylon = dye-susceptible.

1ngw8wp,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1ngw8wp/i_dont_get_it/,I don't get it.,"I can go all week without drinking. Hardly even a craving. Then after a long shift at the bar I just want to drink. A little leftover espresso martini? That's coffee, might as well not let it go to waste. Oops made too much margarita... well that sounds good too. Go have a cocktail at a different bar after? Sure just one or two. Then I do, I have a good time, and feel so much regret. I think it's because I'm a stay at home mom during the week, it feels like when I work on the weekends it's my time, my ""break"". Did I close the bar ok? Did I say something dumb? I don't think so but not knowing gives me anxiety all week until the following weekend. 

I want to be totally sober again. I don't want to let my family down. I don't want to have anything to hide. I don't want to wonder what I said or did or didn't do... Idk why it's so hard when I can go all week without it. I'm so over feeling like this. After every weekend. Day one yet again. 🙄",2,1757868472.0,stopdrinking,4,0.75,False

1ngw78i,https://www.reddit.com/r/askatherapist/comments/1ngw78i/massive_fight_with_my_therapist_what_are_my_next/,"Massive fight with my therapist, what are my next steps?","So I had a convo with my therapist about how I feel like I spend too much money. We only had 10 minutes left, so I more-so talked about my guilt around it and my feeling that I spend beause it makes me happy. 10 minutes over - I leave, we never get around to talking about this. 

Now, a few weeks ago me and my therapist got into quite a fight about whether or not I have BPD. She said I didn't, my psychiatrist said I didnt, my previous providers said I didnt, and I said I mean it COULD be but I don't believe so. I did the test after being told my psych that she doesn't have to diagnose me if I dont want the diagnosis, and made it clear to my therapist that I WILL do therapy for it, but because I'm in the middle of getting my disability approved I do NOT want the diagnosis bc it could mess it up and its very important to me that I get the help I need (I do not want to be forced into a psych-home, I want a at home help. Currently, bc of CPTSD, I am getting that bc its curable. With BPD, it could be that they stereotype me into ""shouldn't be allowed to live alone bc he's dangerous"" and bc its the insurance deciding, with their therapist who DOES NOT KNOW ME, I am afraid. I have made extreme progress and impressed all my providers with this, but I'm at a point where I need a bit more help to be able to progress!) My therapist said we'd ""talk"" about it, I did the test, got 5/9 symptoms, she was all ""nooo no way"" and then next week she was extremely sure that I had BPD. When asked what changed, she couldn't give me a straight answer.
Thing is, I have ADHD, C-PTSD & Depression. These things *do* look like BPD, and again, I made it clear to everyone that I WANT to do Therapy, I WANT to do ANYTHING I can to get heathly. I want to live for the very first time in my life and have SHOWN that. I went from alcohol addicted to sober for a year, drug and smoking free for 3 years. I went from bad grades, bedrotting, and isolation to that one person that everyones friends with, I help everywhere I can in my university, I have MANY friends. Theres so much more, and I'm saying all of this to kind of proof that I'm not just coping but that I actually made real and seeable progress, that she has no reason to ""not trust"" that I am lying about wanting to do the extra therapy - thing is, I am maxxed out in therapists (I have two) so I only could do DBT after I finish one of them anyways! She even said she's unable to do that and I'd need to do it after her. 

So inbetween all of this mess, she read me out all the diagnosises I have, and told me that bc Germany goes by the ICD-10, she translates my ""real"" diagnosis as follows:
- mildly severe Depression (which got lowered from severe after I got on antidepressants)
- ADHD Type Inattentive
- PTSD (C-PTSD didn't exist)
- Impulse Control Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (Skin-Picking)
- Impulse Control Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (Shopping-Addiction)
- Maybe BPD - needs more testing

Now, I agree with the first 3. I know I have these. But the last two kind off piss me off. Hearing that she diagnosed me with ""Shopping Addiction"" ontop of BPD made me spiral reaaal bad. I know it doesn't show up bc its in the ICD-10, and she chose to only diagnose it once obvs, but knowing that if we change to ICD-11 makes me sick. Because, the whole reason why I am scared of spending too much, is because I was homeless for some time and my parents went from higher middle class to bankruptcy. My dad, ontop of many things, used money to buy my love, to buy my forgiveness, I had times where we didn't have food because he was too proud to get help, and I live in a constant fear of ""what if I'm all alone there again?"" as at the time the help shelters were full and CPS, who was HELPING ME RUN AWAY FROM MY DAD, told me they cant take me and I'd have to sleep on the street, WHILE telling me I need to leave bc he might kill me. So, the thing is, I don't spend *a lot*. I feel guilty and sick when I buy something in the uni cafeteria because that 1€ coffee could've cost a few cents at home. Buying water? I cant do that, what if I need it. I don't have proper income, but if I want new clothes, I sell my old ones. I am currently+500€s up in savings ONTOP of my real savings that I'm not allowed to touch, which come from 3 years of working, that I didn't spend more than ~400€s off, and 300€ of that was so I could continue working bc stuff needed replacement. The rest I saved. All of it. 
I have rules like that 2/3s of my income are my budget, I use budgeting apps down to the cent, I spend weeks on second hand websites before I decide I have found the cheapest option, and I do NOT buy anything thats more than 10€s at once, IF anything. To all this, we obviously didn't get in our discussion. But hearing the diagnosis as made me so much WORSE. I love thrifting, and e.g. two days ago we spent 6 hours in shopping malls and second hand stores. In the end, I had spent 2€s on 2x 1€ photo phrames because I'm working on a picture frame wall (all thrifted, none of them more than 1€ bc I'll be damned if I EVER spent more than 1€ on a damn picture frame) and I *still* felt physically sick, worse than I do when I accidentally step on a snail, and girl I sob my little heart out when I do this. Even when buying food, my head screams at me ""youre buying this because youre addicted youre spending money you shouldn't you're gonna be poor again and then you'll regret it"". Its effecting my day to day life to the point where I didn't have food and didn't eat for two days because I was too scared to buy it. 

Additionally, I got diagnosed with Autism at 4 years old. I was born female, and I feel this matters. I ignored that diagnosis because whenever I had brought it up, my doctors brushed it off as ""no way you have that"", though ALL and I really mean ALL people who I know who are diagnosed autistic urged me to get tested so hard because they didn't believe me that I didn't have it when I told them that. No one ever tested me because they just went ""nah"". But with BPD - everyone also said ""nah""?? And now my psych even flipped on me and said ""well maybe u then have it"" so who can I even believe at all about being right at this point? I did 4 different autism evaluation tests, and all 4 of them told me to talk to a psych about it bc theres strong indication. That obv doesn't mean i have it, but its a LOT clearer than the BPD indication test we did?? 

I honestly have been doing so much worse since all of that, my ED came back full swing and I suspect because I feel like I am losing control over everything right now. I even told my therapist, asked if 1500kcals a day is okay, she said yes (I believe thats pretty low ? now that I'm in recovery again I can see that) and I send a desperate email to my psych for help, but she brushed off that I had lost 10kgs in ~6 months because I told her that I couldn't eat and I wanted help for that and to discuss it. (I used to be diagnosed with Bulimia, she undiagnosed me as I was recovered for 3 years)

Now, I am just utterly lost and hurt and confused. I was supposed to get a psycho-social assistant, but got denied because I live too far away. I live alone, I've been begging for help because I cannot care for myself, all I have are my bf and my best friend who bless her heart comes over and helps me clean because I cannot do it. Ontop of all of this I've been struggling with chronic pain for 2 years with no sight of figuring out what it is, and stress makes it worse. 

I do not know what to do. I love my therapist and my psychiatrist. I felt very comfortable there the last few years, but I feel like no one's listening to me ever since it became a sudden possibility that I have BPD, they both treat me completely differently. The only one who keeps me sane is my ergotherapist, who said she witnesses this happen sometimes. I cannot just switch therapists, the wait lists are +3 years. 

If anyone could help me figure out my nexts steps that'd be awesome - how do I talk to my therapist about all of this?",1,1757868364.0,askatherapist,1,1.0,False

My usual order is a Trenta cold brew w/ 4 shots of espresso. Nothing else. Just black! 

A few weeks ago, I went to a different Starbucks than my usual one and ordered my usual drink at the window. When I went to drink it, I could immediately tell it had vanilla syrup in it for some reason and went back and politely asked for it to be remade. 

Now, twice this week at my usual Starbucks, this has happened again. Once when I ordered through the app & once when I ordered at the window. 

The first time it happened, I assumed the barista thought he was doing something nice for me (nice gesture if so, but I just don’t like sweet coffee!) 

Now that it’s happened twice in one week at my usual location, I’m wondering if the drink is an annoying one to make due to so many added shots. Are they adding vanilla syrup to mask that it doesn’t have as much espresso in it as it should? 

I absolutely hate having to ask for a drink to be remade but I also hate sweet coffee! Anyone know why this could be happening?

1ngw41f,https://i.redd.it/yyxjnadjs5pf1.jpeg,Why do foreigners glorify Brazil’s miscegenation so much? Why politicians cite Brazil as an example of multiculturalism that worked and miscegenation,"In Brazil, the mixing of people and cultures was not romantic or natural, it was extremely painful and violent. It arose from whitening policies, the exploitation and rape of Indigenous and African women, and the imposition of unequal social structures.

There are plenty of examples in both family and collective history: my great-grandmother, an Indigenous woman, was rescued from coffee plantations, and my German great-grandfather helped her escape. Additionally, Italians from Veneto and Japanese immigrants who came to Brazil became “white slaves,” subjected to harsh working conditions on farms and in cities, especially on coffee plantations. The Portuguese literally made Europeans from other countries slaves in Brazil, particularly Italians and Japanese, showing that miscegenation here involved the exploitation of people from all origins.

Even so, the country became one of the most racially mixed societies in the world, with a unique and hybrid culture. Foreigners see this as a “success” of multiculturalism, but do they consider the entire historical context?

Moreover, we had figures like Getúlio Vargas, who faced movements that wanted to divide the country and made it clear that everyone was Brazilian, regardless of ethnicity. During the Estado Novo, Portuguese became the official language in schools and public institutions, but people continued speaking their native languages at home. The goal was not to erase cultures but to unite the country.

On one hand, this process “worked” in the sense that everyone feels Brazilian and a sense of belonging to Brazil. On the other hand, it was an extremely painful process, full of suffering, exploitation, and resistance. Even so, this diversity did not create problems; it helped foster citizenship and social cohesion.

So, is the foreign glorification of Brazilian miscegenation fair, or is it a superficial view of something far more complex, painful, and full of stories of resistance?",6,1757868157.0,AskTheWorld,12,0.69,False

Understanding the Basics of Dental Hygiene

Oral health is a fundamental aspect of personal care that many people overlook. The proper way to clean teeth involves more than just running a toothbrush quickly across your teeth.

Essential Tools for Effective Teeth Cleaning

Choosing the Right Toothbrush

Selecting the perfect toothbrush is the first step in proper teeth cleaning. Consider these factors:

Proper Brushing Technique: Step-by-Step Guide

1. Position Your Toothbrush Correctly
Hold your toothbrush at a 45-degree angle to your gums, ensuring maximum cleaning effectiveness.

Spend at least 30 seconds on each quadrant of your mouth:
• Outer surfaces
• Inner surfaces
• Chewing surfaces

I was counting the usual glacial, indifferent stares of uninterested gawkers watching street musicians performing some flamenco in the park. Sitting next to them, I was enjoying the mild wind of September and thought, *""ah, that could be a cover of Gustavo Santaolalla,""* and closed my eyes for a bit. It was about two weeks ago.

Earlier, on an ugly morning before hitting Ritterstrasse, I wanted to sip a coffee at ""Rock, Paper..."" and I noticed a really beautiful girl sitting there, having just her own peaceful time, unbothered. She was casually smiling and speaking Italian or French to the waitress, and they were exchanging warm smiles that kind of improved my bad day. Shortly after, I accidentally had a random unspoken encounter when we both were at the counter ordering a drink. (no creepy thoughts, no xD).

So, fast forward to the park, she came to the same place as me and I was wondering: *""ah, but this is the same girl I saw earlier? Wtf, what are the chances in Berlin to meet the same stranger twice in the same day""* And I thought that was awesome, just by that fact. Her presence was comforting even without the slightest interaction, and she was just there painting the tree in front of Böcklerpark.

When she left, she respectfully and smiley nodded to say goodbye to me, and she actually turned her head specifically to say goodbye to me... Like, she could have done that with many other people sitting just next to me, and me, like a fcktard, I wasn’t able to come up with even the slightest freaking phoneme. Like I could have said, *""I noticed you were painting. It was really beautiful...""* but no. I badly wanted to get to know her better.

1ngvth5,https://www.reddit.com/r/aiArt/comments/1ngvth5/isnt_the_market_too_saturated_heres_why_i_dont/,“Isn’t the market too saturated?” Here’s why I don’t think so.,"Every time I mention creating products (like coloring books, journals, or digital downloads), I hear the same thing:
 “But isn’t the market too saturated?”

Yes, the market is crowded. Amazon, Etsy, and other platforms are full of books, prints, and designs. No denying that.

But crowded doesn’t mean dead. Coffee shops are “saturated,” yet new ones open every month and succeed — because they bring a unique vibe, flavor, or branding.

People don’t buy products, they buy specific experiences. A “generic coloring book” might flop, but a “Backyard Birds Coloring Book” or “Haunted Dolls Coloring Book for Adults” can stand out.


The key is niching + originality. Saturation kills copycats, not creators who:

- Spot micro-niches.

- Add personality or storytelling.

- Use AI to test and refine quickly.


In other words: it’s not about whether the market is saturated, it’s about whether your idea connects with your audience.

I’d actually argue saturation is proof that the market is healthy — people are buying. The challenge is to carve out your little corner of it.

What do you think? Do you see saturation as a blocker, or as a filter that weeds out the generic stuff?",2,1757867483.0,aiArt,3,0.67,False

I've already asked some people close to him for specific suggestions, but aside that, what are some thing (food, snacks, comfort items) that he might enjoy? My list so far is a lot of chocolate (proper Canadian chocolate ala coffee crisp, smarties, aero, oh henry, etc) And a friend (also Canadian) told me about St. Hubert Poutine mix? Also Ketchup chips (brand pref, Lays or Old Dutch?), Hawkins Cheezies.

What other things would bring a little bit of ""home"" during the next 9 months? Cost isn't an issue, and could be non-food things too, though not sure what that would be.

1ngvqei,https://i.redd.it/41k8auhsp5pf1.png,DIVERSIONS -- Part II - The Broken Compass,"**DIVERSION — Part II: The Broken Compass**

The message didn’t blink, didn’t nag: **CLEVELAND. TONIGHT. DOOR. OPEN.**  
It just sat there like a grin with too many teeth.

Stencil paid for two flights he wouldn’t take and took a third no one had sold him. He rerouted the painter to a hotel with a name that made clerks smile and slipped into the city’s bloodstream in the direction opposite of all the advice he’d ever given anyone.

Williams had said *Tehran*. Haresh had said *weather*. Elizabeth had said nothing, which was how Stencil counted prayer.

He gave himself six hours to do the kind of algebra that saves people. It wasn’t enough, but men like Stencil made a living on insufficiency.

The painter asked his name again in the elevator because fear likes symmetry.  
“Jacques,” he said, and watched her watch the word.  
At the sixth floor he handed her a room key and a sentence to recite if a man with a particular tie asked a question the way snakes ask. He gave her the tube with the canvas, then took it back, then gave it again—practice for letting go.

“You’ll disappear for three days,” he said. “On the fourth, be seen buying fruit in a place where people judge fruit. Then keep moving until you become boring again.”

“What if I don’t want to be boring?” she said.

“You will,” he said. “Boring people live long.”

He left her there with an instruction that sounded like kindness and felt like exile. On the street he bought two phones in different languages and threw away the SIM that had been carrying the grin.

At Gare de l’Est he met a man who believed in paperwork and moved items too old to be insured. Stencil slid the real tube into a freight consignment bound for Antwerp under the name of a defunct theater company that used to specialize in disappearances. He mailed a decoy to a place thieves liked to watch. He handed a third, empty tube to a teenager who thought he was being scouted for a film.

He rethreaded Paris around himself like a garment that hid seams, then let the city close over him. At Charles de Gaulle he boarded a flight that would deny him if asked. Istanbul was a layover designed by a novelist: too bright, too clean, too crowded with people heading toward the lives they’d chosen and away from the ones they hadn’t. From there, east.

Mashhad received him like a secret that wanted to be told.

The man who liked him too quickly wore a suit that knew more about threading than honesty.

“I am Davar,” he said, and his handshake was the temperature of a fever breaking. “You are the famous one who isn’t famous.”

“I’m someone’s instrument,” Stencil said.

Davar’s smile was deep enough to drown in if you were careless. “Then play.”

They sat in a room that pretended to be a travel agency. Clocks showed time in cities whose names had been rubbed just enough to resist translation. There was tea that tasted like promises boiled down.

“You were told Tehran,” Davar said. “But we will not be so obvious. Mashhad first. Then someone else’s car becomes our car and the city becomes the same everywhere.”

Stencil looked at the map on the wall and found the holes, the routes that refused to be routes. He found the places where a man could become vapor.

“We’re not stopping anything,” Davar said. “We’re planting rods and asking lightning to prefer us.”

“Your friend Williams enjoys weather,” Stencil said.

“He likes to own the forecast,” Davar said. “Men like him mistake the report for the storm.”

Stencil let that sit. “Proof of life,” he said, and the room forgot tea.

Davar’s eyes warmed a degree toward human. “Of course.” He lifted a phone that wasn’t the first one in his pocket and wasn’t the last. He tapped a key as if signing a treaty. The screen went black, then gray, then Elizabeth.

The frame was ugly the way truth is ugly—flat light, wrong angle, zoom too eager. But Stencil would have known her in a thousand filters. She sat on the edge of a bathtub like a woman who had misplaced her war. Her toes were militant red. She blinked slower than fear.

“Say something she would only say if she were alive *now*,” Stencil said.

Davar typed nothing. The voice came a second later. “Coffee and lemon,” Elizabeth said. “I can never get the ratio right.”

Stencil breathed once, but not all the way. “Make her say the street we lived on.”

“Too expensive,” Davar said mildly. “You have your proof. Now you will earn the kind you want.”

“Where is she?”

“Closer than she should be,” Davar said. “Farther than you can walk.”

“Why am I here, then,” Stencil asked, though he already knew.

“To strike the match,” Davar said.

He slid a folder across the desk. It contained a plan written in the penmanship of men who never smudged. The place was a private museum with a public story about education. The time was twilight, when the call to prayer braided with traffic and every sound could be a beginning. The object on the first floor was a painting that shouldn’t be in this country and therefore was.

“You light the room,” Davar said. “People see each other for the first time in years. They become brave. Brave people get arrested. Our friends take pictures of those arrests. The right pictures end up on the wrong phones. The wrong phones end up on the right desks. Twelve months from now, someone is promoted, someone is exiled, someone is dead, and our weather improves.”

“I’m not an assassin,” Stencil said, because men like Davar appreciated ritual.

“No,” Davar agreed. “You open doors. Others decide whether to walk in.”

Stencil turned the page. The exits were annotated like scripture. The electrical box had an override that had been designed by someone who liked jokes.

“What happens if I refuse?”

“Then someone we both dislike will do it badly,” Davar said. “And Elizabeth will become a story instead of a woman.”

Stencil closed the folder before the room closed around him. “I’ll need a van,” he said. “A jacket that won’t break my shape. A badge that doesn’t need to be true to work. A fire alarm with no alarm in it. And a radio branded for the wrong department.”

“Of course,” Davar said, as if asked whether the sky would continue being an idea.

“And a room with a view of the museum that isn’t a hotel.”

“Two streets over,” Davar said. “A tailor who owes me his hands.”

Stencil rose. “I’ll also need your word,” he said. “That the proof I saw wasn’t recorded last week.”

Davar’s smile didn’t change. “My word,” he said, “is a kind of currency you do not accept.”

“Then give me something else,” Stencil said.

Davar thought about regret, then chose not to. “Tonight,” he said. “Another proof. If you light the room on time.”

Cleveland was winter practicing for war. Elizabeth had decided to be brave for as long as bravery is a choice. She had painted her toes because control is a tiny god that sometimes grants boons. The door staying open was not a question she had asked. It was an answer to a question she hadn’t wanted to hear.

There had been a man at the doorway with an apology shaped like a smile. He knew her name without practicing. He had said, “It’s about your friend Jacques,” and the word *friend* had been placed on the table like a knife wrapped in a cloth napkin. He had not come inside. He had made the room come to him.

“Jacques isn’t his name,” Elizabeth said, and watched the man account for a woman who didn’t want to be counted.

He had glanced, almost with affection, at the bathroom where the fan made the air into a rumor. “Names are receipts,” he said. “We’re not here to itemize. We’re here to… ensure continuity.”

“In case of what,” she said.

“In case of you,” he said.

When she shut the door, it did not click. The man had put something in the jamb the way men put knives in books: quietly and with belief.

At twilight the museum looked like it had learned grace and forgotten guilt. Families wandered the first floor like people trying on different pasts to see which fit. Outside, traffic practiced being a river. Inside, the guard at the east entrance drank tea from a paper cup that had never met a tree.

Stencil wore a maintenance jacket with a patch that said he belonged. He wheeled a small gray case that had wheels that liked him. In the case was a fire alarm with no alarm and a handful of noises that could convince other noises to behave.

The painting hung in a place designed for witnesses. It wasn’t the painter’s painting, not this one, but it was a cousin: a gaze that caught you looking where you didn’t intend to. A child watched a woman’s hands. A van in the background practiced being a prophecy.

Stencil checked the electrical panel that had been annotated like a good lie. He checked the camera angles and found the blind spot no one had bothered to see. He checked the exits and the people near them and chose three faces he could trust to be human.

At 17:31 he broke the building. Not all of it—just enough. The alarm sighed instead of screaming. The lights flickered the way conscience flickers. The doors locked, then unlocked, then forgot what they were for. People looked at each other because looking at each other is what animals do when a shadow becomes a shape.

A child laughed at the wrong time. A man began to film his own bravery. Two women sang a line of a song that had lived in their throats for years waiting to be useful.

Stencil turned a dial designed by a man who liked jazz. The painting lit from below as if it had been waiting for such attention. The attention turned to the wrong faces. Those faces changed into new ones in the cameras that would edit this moment into a story with a villain and a lesson.

Outside, three vans invented themselves at the curb. Inside, an officer discovered he still had the capacity to say “please,” and used it, and was ignored by a woman who had spent a decade being asked to be quiet.

The match had been struck.

“NOW,” Davar said into the radio as if this had been a discussion.

Stencil didn’t answer. He had stepped sideways into the maintenance corridor where the light thought about failing. He slid a door that didn’t exist and stepped into a stairwell reserved for mistakes. He descended into a room that had spent years practicing being mundane and opened a panel that liked him because it respected arrogance.

He cut the feed to the lobby cameras for exactly eleven seconds and cut the feed to the exterior for nine. Between those digits he braided three other things: a misdirection about a fire that did not exist, a ventilation whine that sounded like an order if you wanted it to, and a text message sent from a number that would embarrass an intelligence service.

When he came back up, the museum had become a weather map. People were fronts colliding. Security was wind. Statements formed like clouds.

He walked out because walking out is a skill.

On the corner he took a phone from a pocket he hadn’t checked yet. A message waited with too much patience: **Proof.** He tapped. The video had sound this time—a kind of fan noise, the same wrong pitch as the bad fan in the apartment, the one that made winter feel like a rumor. Elizabeth’s voice came through it like a thread pulled through rough cloth.

“Jacques,” she said. She almost smiled. “You always forget milk.”

He stopped moving because the ground had stopped. “When,” he asked.

“Now,” Davar said. He was beside Stencil without having practiced being beside anyone. “You were punctual. So are we.”

Stencil watched the video twice because once is for hope and twice is for math. The cut happened between syllables, an edit too neat to be honest. It was live, but live could be three minutes ago and still do damage. He looked at the clock in the corner of the painting behind her and measured the minute hand’s lazy treason. He listened for the fan and counted the stutter that used to live in the motor.

“Where is she,” he asked again because sometimes repetition is all you have.

“In Cleveland,” Davar said. “Until Cleveland is a different place.”

“Williams is there,” Stencil said.

“Williams is everywhere he can afford to be,” Davar said. “And everywhere he can’t, he borrows.”

A small man in a large coat bumped them and apologized to the space behind them. Stencil slipped the phone into Davar’s pocket as if returning a wallet he’d never stolen. “I go west,” he said.

“You go east,” Davar said. “We have a car.”

“I have a plane,” Stencil said. “And a debt.”

Davar’s hand touched his sleeve, not as a threat but as mathematics. “If you do not continue, everything you just started ends in an arithmetic we don’t enjoy.”

“And if I do,” Stencil said, “a different arithmetic kills her on time.”

Davar sighed like a building settling. “You care too much to be good at this.”

“I’m very good at this,” Stencil said. “That’s what frightens me.”

He left Davar with a van that wanted to be useful and a plan that had decided to hold. He bought a ticket to somewhere he didn’t intend to go, then traded it for a seat on a flight that had already boarded. The steward looked at him the way dogs look at men who are about to change the direction of a walk. He took off over a city that hadn’t forgiven him for arriving.

In the air, he did the thing he hated: he sent a message to Haresh. Three words, no flourish: **Door. Proof. Trade.**

Haresh’s answer came from a different weather system. **Williams owes me a quiet. You owe me nothing. Choose noise.**  
It was almost affection.

Cleveland smelled like regrets reheated. He stepped from the rideshare half a block early because paranoia is a fitness regime. Snow carried itself like a rumor on a wind that had spent the afternoon practicing disappointment. The street lamps made the world into small perfect circles of honesty; beyond them, everything could be forgiven.

The building knew him. The buzzer breathed his name. He didn’t ring. On the second floor, the hall was a sentence leading toward a word he didn’t want to say. His door was open a fraction wider than when it had been photographed. The wedge in the jamb was gone. That meant a new wedge had been invented, or the door had learned to obey.

He pushed with two fingers the way you test water you expect to be cold. The apartment was lit the way guilt is lit—too much and in the wrong places. The bathroom fan made the air into the memory of a train. On the bath mat, a smear of militant red that wasn’t blood and wasn’t mercy.

“Elizabeth,” he said, not too loud. The word touched surfaces and came back changed.

On the kitchen counter, next to the lemon soap she favored because it made dishes smell like promises, a compass sat under the light. It was old in the way good lies are old: brass scuffed, glass scratched, needle unwilling to settle. Someone had broken it, not by force but by intention. Four shards of needle jutted like choices he didn’t want. Around the rim, hairline cracks made a spider draw maps.

There was a note under the compass, handwritten in a careful hand that pretended to be calm. Three words: **SEED THE CLOUD.**

He felt the apartment move around him the way cities move when a parade is about to surprise them. The phone on the table buzzed like a nervous insect. He didn’t own this phone. It had been placed where his hand would be.

He answered without giving it permission.

“Hello, Stencil,” Williams said, friendly as a sermon. In the background a fan hummed—not the bathroom’s, a different one, cleaner, as if the room had been moved since morning.

“You left me a toy,” Stencil said, looking at the compass. “It’s broken.”

“It points everywhere,” Williams said. “Like you.”

“Proof,” Stencil said, and the word sounded more naked than any prayer.

Williams chuckled, not unkindly. “Look left,” he said.

Stencil looked. On the living room wall, above the couch where they had once failed at a movie because kissing had been more urgent, the television had been turned to a channel that wasn’t a channel. A live feed appeared—a hallway with too-bright lights and a door that wanted to be quiet. Elizabeth stepped into frame. She held a paper cup the way courage holds water. She looked into the camera the way people look at mirrors when they’re practicing being remembered.

“Say my name,” Stencil said to the air.

Elizabeth hesitated, then didn’t. “Stencil,” she said, ruining a thousand precautions. “Come home.”

The screen went black. The phone breathed once in his hand, then died with dignity.

He stood very still because motion is a language and he was not ready to say anything he couldn’t take back.

In the bathroom, the fan changed pitch by a fraction the way hearts change tempo at news. The door behind him closed with a tact that men use when they are carrying guns they intend to argue with.

“Don’t,” said a voice he knew as well as his own shadow.

He didn’t turn around because turning makes the future happen faster. He watched the reflection in the microwave door instead, cheap chrome bending destiny. A figure stood in the kitchen doorway, weapon low, stance good, breath measured. The man from the hall, or another man shaped by the same school.

“I’m not here to kill you,” the man said.

“No one ever is,” Stencil said.

“I’m here to take you to a place where men make trades,” the man said. “You have been invited.”

“By the weather,” Stencil said.

“By the man who owns it,” the man said.

“And if I refuse?”

“Then we will invite Elizabeth alone,” the man said. “She is punctual.”

Stencil exhaled. The compass on the counter reminded him that truth fractures before it aligns.

“Give me a minute,” he said.

“You have thirty seconds,” the man said.

Stencil looked again at the bath mat, at the smear of militant red. He thought about Paris and Mashhad and museums that practiced confessions. He thought about doors that stayed open without being asked. He thought about weather and men who owned it.

He picked up the compass and the needle’s shards shifted, pointing east and west at once like a joke that hadn’t chosen a punchline.

Then, from the building’s hallway, a sound no one expected interrupted mathematics: three sharp knocks on his door—precise, polite, a rhythm Stencil knew better than he knew his own name.

“Jacques?” said Elizabeth’s voice from the other side. Not on a screen. Not in a phone. Here.

The man with the gun flicked his eyes toward the door. Stencil didn’t move.

The door swung inward another inch as if the building itself had decided to be brave.

“Jacques,” she said again, closer. “Please open.”

Stencil smiled without humor because this was the kind of choice Williams liked to sell as fate.

He set the broken compass down so softly it didn’t complain.

“Time,” the man warned.

Stencil put his hand on the door, felt the cool of the metal, the paint’s small bumps, the tremor of a hallway trying to be a future.

He opened.

When we got together things were going really well. We both had visions for our futures and our finances were completely separate. 

He moved in with me and my family (mom, stepdad, and 2 little brothers) very quickly. It did not happen on purpose, one sleepover turned into him living with us. He didn't pay any living expenses for 2 years. No rent, barely paid for this own food, and didn't really help around the house at all. My family had no idea how to bring up him paying for stuff, especially rent. We ended up having to move and now he's paying rent because we simply could not afford for him not too. 

He does full time tree work and I work full time EMS and I'm in school. He makes more than me but I pay for more of our necessities. I came home one morning after working a 24, to condom wrappers on my bed. His excuse was jacking off and not wanting to clean up the mess after. A lot of people told me that he's probably cheating on me but I didn't have any real proof so I stayed with him. Im starting to think that maybe I should break up with him and I'm seeing a lot of red flags from the past two years that I completely ignored. He has his body count tattooed in tally marks on his leg, he's a borderline alcoholic, video games tend to come before me, we got a dog and he honestly treats my dog like shit. My mom keeps saying he's a good guy and that I should give him more chances. But I feel so much more like an adult than him despite being younger with less life experience. I'm really not sure what to do. 

He has his good moments that make me feel like maybe he isn't too far gone. He opens doors for me, makes me coffee in the morning sometimes. But it feels more like we're roomates than partners.

 I desperately need someone to talk some sense into me before we move again. For some reason I feel like I can't break up with him. 

TL:DR: I can't decide if I want to break up with my boyfriend of 2.5 years because the good moments occasionally feel like they outweigh the bad. ",1,1757867254.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1ngvoh4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectricians/comments/1ngvoh4/ambient_temperature_corrections_in_texas_attic/,Ambient Temperature Corrections in Texas Attic,"Hi, experts! I plan to install some EVSE in my garage and do most if not all of the work myself. I'll likely post a more comprehensive plan here soon, but for now I have a fundamental question about how to properly select cables. I'm in Dallas, Texas in a single family, single story home.

I plan to run SER cable from my main breaker on one end of my house up into and across the attic to the other side of my house to drop down into the wall of my attached garage on the other end of the house where it would terminate at a sub panel. From that sub panel I would plan to run NM/Romex to a couple of wall chargers.

For each of these types of cable I want to make sure I properly size the wire as I understand that to be one of the most important parts of my work. I see NEC Table 310.16 which most reference for properly sizing these types of cable (although I see section 338 specifically for the SE wire, it seems that cable size selection can follow table 310.16 as well).

For reasons I still need to wrap my head around, my understanding is that I need to use the 60\* C column as my reference for these types of wire. Just conceptually I'll focus on the NM wire feeding the wall chargers from the sub panel. Assuming I want to have a wall charger on a 60 amp breaker (to allow for the maximum constant draw of 48 amps of my proposed wall charger), this would mean I would need 1/0 wire running to each wall charger from my sub panel.

My guess is that everyone just spit out their coffee and said 'WTF?'. I'm nearly positive I don't need 1/0 copper for this purpose. I calculated this 1/0 requirement by assuming a max ambient attic temp of 160\*F which is probably a bit high but just in case and for ease of calculation since the ambient temp correction is a simple 50% at that temp. Table 310.16 in the 60\*C column tells me 1/0 copper can handle 125 amps, multiply that by my ambient temperature correction of 50% to get 62.5 amps and then multiply that by 80% to get the safe constant draw, and I get 50 amps. Perfect for my 48 amp constant needs.

Am I doing something fundamentally wrong in my calculations? Thanks all!",1,1757867168.0,AskElectricians,3,1.0,False

Things were great in the beginning. Then right before the warranty ran out it started giving me trouble. Contacted customer service which, although inconvenient, was quite helpful and they ended up sending me a new machine. After about six months of use the new machine stopped working correctly, leaking coffee all over my kitchen. After contacting customer service three times (which is always an hour of my day off, pre-coffee so I’m already irritated), they offered to repair the machine for $60 which I refused and then they offered to fix it for free. So I sent it in, waited 3 weeks, got it back, and the first time I ran it the exact same problem happened. 

I cannot be bothered with this any further, the juice is no longer worth the squeeze. I understand that Nespresso is a premium, quality cup of coffee on a home machine, but I’m quite happy to switch back to my normal drip machine for multiple reasons. 

First, the expense. Pods are expensive and a pain to collect/store so they don’t get moldy and ship back for recycling. Instead, the regular coffee grounds and filter can go right into my compost, simplifying my life by multiple steps. Also, with all the malfunctions and troubleshooting I’ve wasted at least a full sleeve of pods. 
Second, my time. I do not want to go back and forth every few months, it’s so frustrating. I have enough on my plate without having to troubleshoot my coffee machine. 

I will miss the yummy foam and fun flavors to try, but my Nespresso era is over. Thank you for listening to my rant. ",0,1757867114.0,nespresso,22,0.48,False
