I paid for these on 1/27 and he sent it out literally the same day üôåüèΩ USPS wouldn‚Äôt update the tracking info for some days.. but as soon as I let him know it seemed delayed he was on it. Next thing I knew the tracking was updated and I got it the next day, 01/07. Honestly the best. Will be ordering many more!

I prefer sweeter scents so a lot of what Montagne has to offer didn‚Äôt seem like it‚Äôd be up my alley but I‚Äôm SO happy to learn how wrong I was.

Afternoon Dive - this was the freebie he threw in. I am obsessed. It smells like a bright juicy orange that you just grabbed off a tree. Not the flesh, I definitely get more of the peel, but whew it is REFRESHING ASF.

Moi? - I must be one of the people who can‚Äôt smell ambroxan because this smells like nothing to me. If anything it smells like paper..? 

Vanille Absolute - WHY IS IT SO SPICY?!? Feels like I snorted a line of allspice. Not a fan üíÄ

Another 14 - another one I can‚Äôt smell ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è either that or it‚Äôs so incredibly subtle that it smells like air. 

Maison du Soir - now this one, oh man. I‚Äôve been going to sleep wearing this and it is so incredibly comforting. I layer it with a heavier vanilla and it smell like actual roasted marshmallows. So nice for rainy days.

Lira - this one is verrrry sweet. It smells like a photorealistic slice of lemon cake. With hella buttercream. I can see it being cute to wear at a kids bday party or somewhere with baked goods. But not on me. I wasn‚Äôt expecting it to be this sweet. 

Cannoli - this smells like an almond pastry. I love almond scents but this one is also too sweet side for me. 

Cognac D‚Äôange - it smells like Christmas in the best ways. Cinnamony and warm and crisp and cheery all at the same time. My boyfriend adores this one. 

Apple Cognac - a perfect blend of the last one & bright crisp Apple juice. Smells soooooo so good. Kinda like those caramel apple lollipops but with rum on it. Also good for bedtime. 

Pink Rose Frozen - NOW BABAYYYY. THIS IS THE ONE. I‚Äôve had samples of Delina so I know and love her well but I‚Äôve never tried La Rosee‚Ä¶ when I say this shit smells like something a Disney Princess would wear. It has the same elegance as Delina but it‚Äôs juicier. It‚Äôs more delicate. This is going to be beautiful for spring/ summer. 

Phantom Noir - this smells very very good on a man. It‚Äôs a deep chocolate with some coffee and nuttiness. But not sweet at all. My boyfriend layered this with the Cognac D‚Äôange and it smelled like actual heaven. 

Eau Matcha - it‚Äôs pleasant but not my thing. Kinda smells like a spa. The kind where they play elevator music. 


I‚Äôve already purchased Strawberry Milk & Pink Rose Frozen. Will be ordering a few others today. RIP to my wallet ü•≤ü§ûüèΩ ",1,1739570528.0,MontagneParfums,1,1.0,False

What should I do to move the relationship forward?,"My boyfriend and I have been together for about 1.5 years. I have just over a year left of nursing school and I work two jobs/volunteer when I'm not doing school. However, I always find time to see him when I'm free, usually I'll see him 2-3 nights a week depending on how busy I am. 

For context, my boyfriend works about 30 hours a week. He graduated college 5 years ago but hasn't really put effort into entering the career he studied for (policing). So he doesn't really have money to do things with me. I don't expect him to pay for me at all, but if I want to travel or go out, he can't afford to pay to go with me so we don't really do anything together. I try to encourage him to take steps towards his goal career so we can start doing things together but he hasn't made any effort in the entire 1.5 years we've been together. It's obviously his decision but it makes me feel very stuck, and when I bring this up to him he makes excuses and nothing changes. 

I don't think I'm very high maintenance, I don't expect gifts unless we've agreed to buy Christmas gifts or something small for birthdays. He's never taken me out on a date other than our first date and our one year anniversary, although he really seemed annoyed when we were on our anniversary date, so I felt bad for asking if we could do something. When he does pay for something he usually holds it over my head a little bit so it's gotten to the point where I won't do things like ask him to grab me a coffee if he's coming to my house.

Another thing is that he doesn't make effort to show any physical or emotional affection to me. When I've brought this up he tells me he just doesn't like it and it isn't his thing so I just leave it be, but it does hurt me. (He is completely fine with intimacy though.)

Recently I've stopped asking if he would like to see me or if I can come over and I've noticed that we haven't been seeing each other at all because I'm not asking anymore. When I brought this up he got really angry at me and told me he's just not used to inviting people over and that I need to get over it. I'm pretty new to adult relationships so I don't know what to expect in one, although this does hurt me quite a lot.

My question is, what should I do in this situation to help the relationship move forward? 

TL;DR, I don't think my boyfriend puts effort into his life or our relationship, we never go out, he doesn't show me physical or emotional affection, and never initiates seeing me. I am wondering what I should do in this situation to fix the relationship.",0,1739570404.0,relationships,0,0.5,False

Hi Beautiful Souls, 

I have never seen this many of us online at once. I can only surmise that it has to do with it being Valentine‚Äôs. 

It‚Äôs Valentine‚Äôs Day‚Äîyeah, we know. The world is covered in hearts, couples are out in full force, and the pressure to be part of some grand romantic gesture can feel‚Ä¶ a lot. And for many of us, today can bring up feelings of loneliness, longing, or even just sheer annoyance at the spectacle of it all.

But here‚Äôs the truth: Love isn‚Äôt just about romance. Love is the way you care for yourself, the friendships that lift you up, the little moments that remind you how powerful and radiant you truly are. And if today is feeling a bit heavy, let‚Äôs shake it up:

üíñ Retail Therapy? Yes, Please. Treat yourself. A new outfit, a fancy coffee, or even just something small that makes you smile. You deserve it.

üéÆ Game Night or Movie Marathon? Hop into a game with friends, dive into a comfort show, or binge a series that has absolutely nothing to do with romance (unless it‚Äôs messy, dramatic, and fun).

üìû Call a Friend. Even if it‚Äôs just to chat about nothing. Sometimes, a little human connection is all you need to remind yourself you‚Äôre never truly alone.

üçΩÔ∏è Take Yourself Out. Get that meal you‚Äôve been craving. Light some candles. Romanticize your own company‚Äîyou are, after all, excellent company.

üíÜ Self-Care Like You Mean It. Whether it‚Äôs a long bath, a new skincare routine, or just lying in bed with your favorite music, take today to pour love back into yourself.

You are worthy, radiant, and enough exactly as you are, no matter what this day (or the world) tries to make you feel. Valentine‚Äôs Day may belong to the couples, but every day belongs to you.

Sending you all the love, strength, and joy today‚Äîbecause you deserve nothing less.

Now go be fabulous. üíï

1iplymy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1iplymy/my_grandpa_died_and_all_i_can_think_about_is_red/,My grandpa died and all I can think about is red Gatorade,"(Sorry this is really long, I could not sleep last night)

Fruit punch Gatorade.

My favorite flavor of Gatorade. It could be my favorite just because of my personal bias towards the color, but then again, it‚Äôs been my go-to since before I knew red was my favorite color. Anytime I have ever been sick I have laid in bed, my lips dry and my tongue sticking to the hard palate of my mouth. Only one consistent thought on my mind, daydreams of red Gatorade to quench my thirst. Sometimes I will even buy it when I am not sick, I know it is not as good for you as a lot of people believe but I like to think I am somehow fixing my dehydrated body with just one bottle. Could be worse, could be soda.

When I went back to my home state to be with my grandpa as he was getting increasingly sicker, I saw that he was drinking blue Gatorade. Not the light glacier blue one but the dark church jeans one. I do not know if this flavor is particularly bad, but he apparently was not taking too much to it, or at least that‚Äôs what I was told. I offered to get him my favorite type of Gatorade, laughed lightly about how it would put the night sky flavor to shame and took off later to go shopping. After an 80-dollar trip I returned to the hospital, we brought it in, and he tried it. As far as I could tell he liked it, drank it more often than not, at least while I was there.

Every time my grandma wanted him to drink it she would say ‚Äúhow about some of (my name)'s Gatorade‚Äù. Which I laughed and rolled my eyes at, I honestly do not think adding my name to the label made a difference. I am not confident he consistently knew who I was while I was there. Which did not upset me at the time, it felt selfish to worry and depress myself over this when what should have been my highest priority laid a few feet away in a hospital bed with tubes and wires trailing in every direction.

Of course, now he‚Äôs dead. So, I suppose I can depress myself about it as much as my heart desires.

Anyways, my grandma was always talking about how it was *MY* Gatorade. I did not even pay for it; she *reimbursed* me later for the whole trip. All I did was pick it up and have the idea. It felt like she was giving me way more credit than I deserved. But then again, maybe in my thinking this far about it I am giving myself more credit by assuming my grandma was trying to stroke my fragile ego rather than assist her husband in the only way that came to mind.

I think about it all now, and how chapped my grandfather‚Äôs lips were, and wonder a little, if he ever also fantasized about cold fruit punch Gatorade. He would stare at nothing a lot, and I wished I could know what he was thinking. Maybe he was too drugged up for any consistent, understandable thought. But the nostalgic in me imagines him thinking of better days.

Years ago, I saw an old video of him and my grandmother playing baseball. My family joked for a while about how his shorts were shorter than grandma‚Äôs and she was already wearing some pretty short shorts. Or maybe he was thinking about a time when his mother had dinner made after school, the whole family at the table. Maybe he thought about his army buddies, and friends he had been invited to the weddings of. Distant cousins who maybe he was close with at some point but now he never even thought about outside of sparse reminders here and there. His wedding, the births of his children, the births of his grandchildren, the raising of both. Maybe he was thinking about Sunday calls with my cousins who live in Minnesota and before that South Dakota. A few Christmases ago when I got him boxed wine, or his 50^(th) wedding anniversary that happened this last year in 2024.

Or maybe he thought just of simpler things. Things we take for granted, like the smell of cigarettes or the sizzle of fireworks before they go off. The beauty of early morning fog, the brush of gentle wind as you sit on the back porch and watch the sunset. Lush well-watered grass under bare feet, the lack of fear that comes with being a child and not knowing. Cool summer nights, beers in the backyard with your sons and the sound of kids laughing. The scratch of pen across paper when doing banking, and the clink of utensils against pans while grandma made dinner. The dogs running up and down the hall because a car was in the driveway. The shower running while lying in bed watching the news. Harsh rays contrasting against the burgundy blinds over the kitchen sink. Early morning breakfast before a long trip to Disneyland. Soft snow powdering the dry patch of grass over the septic tank. Grandkids laughing in the living room when they were supposed to go to bed hours ago. Rain hitting the roof in early summer, and showers dusting the sidewalk in mid-autumn. Getting the burn pile ready, leading the hose over incase the flames get too big. Earwigs in the grape vines and deer eating the blueberries. The comforting fit of freshly washed and tucked sheets. The discomfort of working-in new shoes. Bitter coffee. Sour milk. Chocolate ice-cream. Red Gatorade.

Honestly, I will never know what he is thinking, even once I die. I am not sure if I believe in an afterlife of some sort, but if there is one and I make it, I think that should be his to keep. My parents always talked about how after death ‚Äúall will be known‚Äù. And I remember being, to say the least, mildly disturbed by that. ‚ÄúAll will be known‚Äù how ominous is that? It always upset me and further upset me when I would have thoughts pop into my head out of my control and then I would panic about how once I die everyone I know, and love will know I thought that. In the grand scheme of things, I doubt anything I have thought or done will be really all that shocking. But I want it to be mine to chose to give. I am a mostly open person, honestly embarrassingly so sometimes. Given enough time, and deep enough conversations I would most likely tell you willingly.

One embarrassing thing I suppose is that I get jealous of people who talk about ‚Äúseeing signs‚Äù. ‚ÄúI saw a bird and I just *knew* it was a sign from my father‚Äù. *You just knew*? My friend tells me to my face with no hesitation that they love me and love to hear me talk about things I enjoy, and I do not even know with 100% certainty if that‚Äôs true. But you see one obscure thing and you *just know*. Why do they get to know, and I do not? And where is my sign? I can picture quite skeptically walking into a grocery store and seeing Gatorade, falling to my knees in aisle 2.

¬†I think I am far too negative of a person to ever think I could truly see a sign. But I know I will see him and my Grammy, on the other side who died this last summer, everywhere. It is not signs but memories, proof I *knew* them. I was rewatching a show I loved in high school with a close friend today, and a face a character made immediately made me think of my Grammy.

In his ghostly state, he can no longer jab his proboscis into anyone's fleshy bits, but he can still do his second most favorite thing: buzzing in people's ear.  He'd like to do that without the annoyance of being waved away constantly, so he offers you a deal:

  
For reasons he'd rather not get into right now, he learned to be a world class barrista to impress a certain fruit fly (seriously, would you stop bringing her up, I'm trying to offer you a deal here) and part of his magical ghostly power is to open a tiny portal and pour his excellent coffee/espresso based delicacies directly into your chosen beverage receptacle.  The only cost:  He gets to buzz in your ear the entire time you drink it.  No swatting or waving at him.  

  
There is no limit to how many coffee/espresso based beverages you may have in a day as far as Nate is concerned.  If you blow up your heart (like a certain..no, no, we're not doing that) that's on you.  \*HOWEVER\* the drinks are only for you.  You can't start a business, you can't fill all your buddy's mugs, Nate is a jealous little guy (ask a...no, damn it, just no).  If you try to gain commercially from his generosity he will magically super glue three of your orifices closed at random.

  
If you ever want to drive to the beach, he'll split the gas money with you but you have to drive.  He never got his license.  And he's a mosquito.  And a ghost.

I always had a sweet tooth, especially for certain things‚Ä¶ especially icecream. But even with that, all I can think about is numbers and the feeling it makes when it sits in my stomach after. Everything sweet just sorta tastes like sugar with slight discrepancies. I mostly drink sweet coffee because you can never get away from the coffee flavor lol, but even that I‚Äôm turned off of and I‚Äôve been a barista at 4 different spots. I love coffee. 

And just forget about savory food‚ÄîI‚Äôm never interested unless I‚Äôm genuinely hungry, probably because it doesn‚Äôt have the same dopamine effect as sugar. I used to enjoy certain dishes that were savory like mac and cheese and the occasional chicken dishes, but even chicken it‚Äôs disgusting me now. 

My mom bought me a lot of valentines chocolates which I‚Äôm so thankful for, but I had zero interest opening them AND THEY WERE MY FAVORITE. I still have snacks she bought me awhile back sitting in my room that I also loved. 

This is really upsetting, especially considering the fact it doesn‚Äôt even really come with the !mentally ill! beneficiary of losing weight. All I think about is numbers, and then that stresses me out, and then I end up binging like a lot of eating disordered people. Mostly on sweets ofc lmao. 

My stomach now easily gets irritated (bloated, cramps, nausea, IBS) and I had to get two teeth removed and I have cavities despite me always brushing regularly (the dentists are always shocked to see my front teeth perfectly fine and pearly white but my molars fucked üíÄ) I suspect it‚Äôs a nutrient deficiency because I mostly eat sweets and hardly get protein. I also am iron deficiency anemic. 

I have had an ED for almost 7 years now and I‚Äôm reaping the consequences. I‚Äôm only 20-21. It‚Äôs ruled my life no matter how much I weighed. And it‚Äôs all for nothing because it takes away happiness from everything. How can you feel good if your body is breaking down?

I had nothing for an appetite for at least a week after so I ended up eating very little if anything most days, but I also felt significantly depressed during that. That depression recovered when I first started drinking coffee again on monday and I felt significantly better but I dont know why or how that wouldve caused it. Maybe the sugar helped? At least thats my current theory 

I know my appetite significantly recovered after I started drinking coffee, I dont know if I can attribute that to the coffee or not though.

I then had to deal with the stomach flu on wednesday, which has meant I havent been able to eat still. 

I have barely been eating. I have still got no hunger cues, I havent dealt with those in ages, which Ive been blaming on my disordered eating behaviors when I was younger.

So why on earth do I feel better than usual? I feel happier and lighter, something feels better but I cant tell what or why. I have no clue why I feel like this, barely eating for nearly 2 weeks shouldnt feel good its supposed to make you feel weak, too dizzy to stand, sickly. Why do I somehow feel better than usual? In some way I feel tempted to keep starving myself just to stay in a state of feeling better. But I know I shouldnt because I need food to live.

I feel like I know something is wrong or that there is something not right with my body but I cant tell what and I dont have enough information to figure it out.",1,1739569550.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

Quick context: my wife is weighing residency options, and one that she would 
like to rank highly would involve a move across states. This would also be timed shortly after the birth of our first child.

I'm looking for perspective about my current job/benefits to understand how ""lucky"" my current situation is. My job is in microbial research and sometimes requires afterhours/weekend remote monitoring. Looking at job postings suggests to me that I could maybe find something with a slightly higher salary (+5-10k) but I highly value my current workplace culture. Listing the tangible/intangible benefits in no particular order:

- 4 weeks paid vacation - no need to wait for it to accrue and simply put it in a shared calendar (no approval process or pushback). We all act like adults and understand not scheduling bigger trips around project deadlines, etc.
- Unlimited sick days with an emphasis on not coming in if symptomatic (no doctors note is needed for typical short cold); the team comes together to cover that person's lab tasks.  Option for some remote work if feeling better but not quite recovered.
- Emphasis on not burning out/balancing time to 40h (taking into account after hours/weekend time)
- Flexible schedule - I typically work 7am-3:30pm to beat traffic but have the flexibility to come in later and work more standard hours. 
- PTO time can be used in small disrete chunks if you know you need to leave a little earlier or you can simply work a little longer one another day to balance things out
- Supervisor/team leader are compassionate people and understand when life takes priority (e.g., child is sick and needs to be picked up from daycare), accomodate to pick up in person tasks to allow for WFH times. This is at times with little forward notice.
-2 months of fully paid parental leave with the option for unpaid leave if needed.
- Nice, sunny office which people have made more cozy with plants/decorations (myself included)
- Friendly co-workers and supervisors across teams 
- Strong safety first oriented lab culture
- Snacks, drinks, fresh fruit, coffee/tea machine in the kitchenette/lunch room.

A shame it‚Äôs just puddled in a jar. A shame what they‚Äôll do with it.

Shelly is back with the next container, you ready? she asks and I nod. I‚Äôm always ready. She‚Äôs got the pole with the hook end and she dips it into the plastic tub and lifts out the snake, sleek and black, twisting in the air, six feet long. I use a blunt-ended pole to push it‚Äôs head to the ground then I grab it behind the jaw, cold scales, cold and muscular, black eyes wild and powerful, tongue tasting the air. I know he sees me, I know he knows me and his anger and fear are only because of Shelly. She has never known how to hold the snakes properly, with the proper reverence and calm. I see how they look at her, and how it is different from when they look at me.

You got him? I ask and she says yes but she is still using the hook, she is holding the back half of the snake up with the hook while I grip the head, her resistance to use her hands is embarrassing and unprofessional and disrespectful to the snake.

I grab new jar and I present it to the snake. The jar is covered with a thin plastic film to simulate skin for the snake to bite through. The film is required to push the snake's gums back from its fangs and allow the venom to squirt out.

I move the jar in front of the snake and I press on the sides of its mouth to force the jaw open. The whitepink, fleshy insides of the mouth are such a contrast to the scaled armor exterior, a sight rarely seen by anything still alive. I tap my forefinger on the plastic covering, tap tap tap, get his attention, then *snap!* the fangs plunge in and work back and forth like chewing, squirting jets of golden liquid into the jar.

Then, oh so carefully remove the jar from the fangs, set it down, carry the snake back to the container, lower it inside, Shelly takes away the hook and I‚Äôm still holding the head, push it down into the container then snatch my hand back and close the lid. Done. The seventh such snake milked in this way today.

Shelly carries the tub away, and I gather the seven jars. What I am holding, I think as I carry the jars, has the power to kill a hundred people or more. I think about this every time, and how disgusting it is to avert the natural course of things by inserting our science and technology and disrupting everything, the most venomous snakes with the deadliest venom on earth, perfected over millions of years to kill with precision like an assassin, and here we are interrupting the natural order, here *we* are with our *tools* and our *computers* breaking down and analyzing and completely tearing apart this phenomena that we ought to simply observe and admire, imagine, I think as I carry the jars, an ancient hunter with bow and arrow stalking a deer through the forest, carefully following the tracks with practiced stealth, with skills learned and honed over generations, thousands of years of practice and honing all leading to this pinacle of hunting prowess, and imagine the hunter spies the deer through a gap in the brush, and he raises his bow, which his family has perfected through trial and error over generations, and he notches the arrow and draws and holds his breath, waiting for the perfect moment to shoot, a moment learned through countless hours of hunting, and the moment comes, and he fires! and the arrow flies with deadly accuracy straight at the deer‚Äôs heart, but at the last possible moment a great hand descends from the sky and knocks the arrow away and a booming voice says *no you may not kill this deer, no matter how hard you worked for it or how skillful your attack you may not kill this thoughtless and vacant deer which is just standing here asking for it, I am protecting this deer and there is nothing you can do about it!* Imagine that, and you have imagined exactly what these antivenom production outfits are doing every day when they protect, at the snake‚Äôs expense, the countless blundering careless oafs who go stomping blindly into the desert, and blindly and carelessly into the forests and jungles, and who drag their mindlessly screaming children along and toss them into the forests and jungles and deserts to be bitten by these perfectly balanced pinnacles of evolution called snakes, and who then are allowed to *take it back* by shooting up with antivenom and *learning nothing.*

I put six of the jars into the cupboard and when Shelly turns her back I slip the seventh into my jacket pocket.

At home I sit on my couch and I look at the jar of golden liquid, which I‚Äôve set on my coffee table. It glimmers a passionate and excited glimmer, as if it knows it is destined to serve the purpose it was born for, as if it knows it has escaped the fate of the other jars. I uncap a fresh syringe and dip it into the jar, extracting 1.5 ml of the venom, the average amount dispensed from the fangs of this particular snake, a volume I measured myself when I first began this process many years ago. After years of steadily increasing the dose, finally I will fill the syringe to the full 1.5 ml, as if from a real snakebite, and I will need no hand of god to save me, no cheating, no help from anyone but myself, my own body‚Äôs defenses which I have built up will be what saves me. I choose a point on my arm and I inject the venom.

24 hours of pain and swelling and nausea and flushed skin and sweating, burning pain and heartpounding adrenaline and no sleep. But as always, it fades. As always, my body wins, my antibodies have been trained, my blood knows what to do, and it overcomes, and the next day the swelling recedes and the pain fades and I am flooded with endorphins and a glowing sense of wellbeing, and strength and energy like none other.

A week later we are milking the snakes again. Shelly is using the hook to lift out the snake and I grab it‚Äôs head as usual, and for some reason she is looking at me while I do it, looking hard with intent eyes like she is seeing something new. Then when I‚Äôm holding the head in my fingers she says Aren't you ever scared? Of what? I ask. Of getting bit, she says. No, I say, and she is silent, watching me as I prepare the jar and the snake. I guess you‚Äôre right, she says, I guess I shouldn‚Äôt be so afraid since we have antivenom right here.

I must have squeezed the snake then. I must have squeezed unconsciously when I thought of Shelly being unafraid, of *her* feeling safe and secure through no work of her own, feeling safe because of the *cheat code*, because of the *shortcut* that her and every stumbling moron and every clueless kid could take to escape the consequences of their thoughtless and careless actions, I must have squeezed because right then the snake squirmed out of my grip and snapped its head around and bit hard into the meat between my thumb and forefinger, and I felt the fangs working and pumping, and a burning coursed through me.

*Oh my god!* Shelly yelling, the snake on the ground and slithering away, me staring while Shelly is dialing for help. It‚Äôs fine, I‚Äôll be fine, I say, but I can already feel that it‚Äôs different, it is far different than the injection a week ago. I don‚Äôt need antivenom, I say, I won‚Äôt take it, I don‚Äôt need it.

It was not until much later, in the hospital, that I remembered the jar of venom on my coffee table, and how even after taking 1.5 ml into the syringe there was plenty left in the jar, how there had been steadily more left in the jar over the years, even as I increased my dose. The snakebite I received had delivered four times the 1.5ml volume I had become used to. A simple mistake, a simple thing to overlook, the constant milking and the selective breeding of captive snakes over many years would and did increase the volume of venom they produce, this is not something most people would know, and is of course a very easy mistake to make.

But I will never again use antivenom, never again, and once I am healed and better I will continue to increase my dose, and I will never, never again, and I will only depend on my own self, my own body and my own self sufficiency, just as nature intended.

1iplne0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClarenceCartoon/comments/1iplne0/creepypasta_ecneralc/,Creepypasta: ecneralC,"Clarence is a very important part of many childhoods across the globe. As someone that used to work at Cartoon Network studios, I know that this show was very popular during the time that it aired on television. In Cartoon Network studios, I was a part of a group of people who were tasked with watching episodes of cartoons that had just finished being animated and voice acted and we would watch them to find out if they were suitable to air on television. As one of the people in this group, I have seen some odd episodes of cartoons that never got aired, But none of them are as horrifying as what I have seen. One Thursday I was at work. And as I was about to finish my coffee, my manager walks up to me. He tells me that me and my group are about to watch an episode of Clarence to see if it would be okay to air. I walked to the viewing room and there were rows of chairs lined up behind a Tv screen. They then switched the Tv on and the intro started as normal. Already I noticed some differences. The music and animation played slightly slower than usual. Maybe my coworkers didn‚Äôt notice. But I did, and I found it very strange. After the intro had finished, a title card appeared. But all it was very unusual, it was just a greyish-black background with red text that read ‚ÄúecneralC‚Äù at first I though it was just indecipherable text. But when I looked closer, I realised that it was the word Clarence Spelled backwards. Then the episode started. It began with a shot of Clarence‚Äôs School, A common location where most episodes take place. The only strange thing being that it was at nighttime. If I can remember, the school is NEVER shown at night. Then it cut to the hallway with the detention room at the end of it. The hallway was very dark and I could feel my coworkers exchanging confused glances. It then cut to the detention room which was also very dark. The room was empty except for a single desk, which Belson was sitting at. Belson is normally in detention in the show, being the troublemaker that he is. But I thought ‚ÄúWhy is he there at night?‚Äù. It then zoomed into Belson‚Äôs face, and I then noticed that he had bloodshot eyes, not hyperrealistic just cartoony bloodshot eyes. It looked like he hadn‚Äôt slept in days. It then showed a POV of What Belson Was looking at, the open doorway. And I Swear to god, I saw a dark figure resembling Clarence peeking out of the doorway. It then showed Belson‚Äôs face with his bloodshot eyes open very wide for a split second. It then for some reason showed real life footage of someone tied to a chair in a dark room that looked something like a basement. The person in the chair had brown hair, A crimson shirt,and blue trousers on. It then dawned on me, this person was supposed to represent Belson. The person was wearing a blind fold on their eyes and their mouth had been gagged. My coworkers gasped at this sight. It then showed another person entering the room. The person had almost cartoonishly orange hair and was wearing a green shirt and purple shorts. And I knew that this person was supposed to represent Clarence. The person dressed as Clarence then took the tied up persons gag out. He then proceeded to do something that I cannot forget even years later. He Pulled out a megaphone and proceeded to try and jam it down the persons throat. I was horrified when I heard the tied up persons muffled screams and choking noises. After around 20 seconds of this. The person went limp. The person dressed as Clarence then started to speak. He said ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt this what you always wanted Belson? You can now gain everyone‚Äôs attention with this new attachment‚Ä¶‚Äù. It then cut back to the detention room,And this time. It was completely empty. And Belson was gone. The episode then ended. The Viewing room was silent for about 30 seconds. Then everyone started screaming. They were smashing their heads against desks,the Tv and even the window causing it to break and causing someone to slit their throat on the broken glass. After that. I left the building in a state of panic and terror. I went to bed that night, but I could not sleep. I couldn‚Äôt get the image of the persons corpse out of my head. Eventually I found a therapist and slightly recovered. One day I was watching Tv and found a news report about 3 Cartoon Network employees killing themselves over a disturbing episode. And then the memories flooded back. This is why Clarence doesn‚Äôt air anymore.",0,1739568913.0,ClarenceCartoon,0,0.5,False

I've been fortunate enough to spend a fair bit of time with some very successful traders over the years, and I figured this one was worth sharing.

This happened roughly 8 years ago now. Note that this is a story with lessons scattered throughout, not a bulletin of shit that I've thought was useful over the years. That's boring and that's not what I'm here to share today, because everyone has different things that work for themselves. This, though? This is some universally-applicable shit that stuck with me. Sorry kiddos, buckle up for the ride or scroll to the comments cause this is gonna be a long one.

I'd been trading with a fellow probably 30 years older than myself for about a year, developing a system with him. It had gotten to the point we were such hungry bastards for it, I was living in his basement trading full time. No you fucking degenerates, I was not topping the old man. I don't bottom. I'm here for the same reason you're here: **To make lots of fucking money.**

It was a really nice late-spring morning, around 11am. We were both individually trading on our personal accounts¬†and I'd already shut off my monitors for the day. I went upstairs to grab a coffee and go sit on the beanbag in the corner of his office to talk about life and the market for a while, just shooting the shit. We were both in a pretty good mood and performance had been good the last couple months; it's one of those odd days that sticks out in your memory as particularly nice.

About 15 minutes into my sinking into the beanbag, he JUMPS up with such force his legs tossed his chair back into the wall. He points at the screen, and yells ""FUCK YOU."" Reaches straight past the shutdown button to the back of the power supply, and *click*. Guy calmly walks out of the office and as he gets to the doorway he turns around and says, ""I'm done until August. I have a gut feeling.""¬†

I'm sure you can imagine my initial reaction was simply ""wat da fak"". You gotta keep in mind this guy is like 70, what I just saw was rarer than aurora borealis in Texas. He didn't even seem particularly angry about it in any *real* way, just oddly aggravated. I decided I'd leave him alone for a bit and go back down to my pc to look at the charts and see what got him upset. I looked through every timeframe of every product we were trading, and there was nothing out of the ordinary! No ridiculous fuck-you sized candles, no big news, no bullshit at all. They were literally regular low-volatility charts.¬†

My interest was piqued at this point so I went upstairs to talk to him about it and ask what the hell happened, walking up the stairs thinking 'Maybe there was a big position I didn't know he took and he closed it?'¬†¬†

When I finally got to the kitchen he was just sitting there with a coffee totally chill, like nothing happened. I asked him what the fuck and all he said was ""I'm serious, I have a gut feeling and I'm done trading until August. I'm going to fuck it up if I don't.""

""Fuck *what* up?""¬†

""I'll show you in a few months. Don't worry.""¬†

We talked for a bit after that. Turns out he was actually serious about walking away for a while. For the next few weeks he continued to develop the strategy with me but it sidelined the work pretty hard, given his lack of interest to engage with the *sole thing we're here to do at the moment.* At the time it was a tad upsetting but I couldn't complain either way. Not that I wasn't in a position to do so, but rather that it would be fucking stupid to ‚Äì it was working just fine and I understood what he was doing.

By this point it was late June/early July. He started getting more involved again, but he still wouldn't turn on that damn personal computer and explain what the hell all of this was about. I wasn't prying about it, but it stuck in the back of my mind. What in the hell does this guy know, or what happened that made him do that? An old man does not often spring up from his chair with such force that it topples across the room for shit's sake.¬†We traded for a couple more weeks into mid-late July until I finally broke and asked him what had happened. Sly bastard just says, ""You're a couple weeks out from finding out, Junior!""¬† Fuckin... alright whatever.¬†

August 1st rolls around. It felt like being a kid waking up on Christmas morning. I woke up, immediately remembered what day it was, and tossed on some shorts to *run* up the stairs. Old man is sitting in his office with a full suit on, smiling. He walks over and says ""look at this shit. Look at this shit. LOOK AT IT!""¬†

I walk over.

Holy fucking shit.¬†

$369,374. In one trade.¬†First thought: yolo level volume. My eyes shoot over to the lot size; Nope, pretty regular for that account size. Wtf?¬†We both start laughing so hard our stomachs were hurting.¬†I'll never forget that number so long as I live, we must have stared at it and broken back out in laughter half a dozen times.

When we could breath again, he explained that he'd been setting that trade up for a looong time, waiting for all of his signals to line up on all of his timeframes. Well, it finally lined up for him. When he jumped up and pointed at the screen, he'd just entered his order and take profit etc. That was his way of walking away.¬†

Now, HERE'S THE LESSON IN ALL OF THIS SHIT. I hope the story was entertaining, but there's a point to me writing this novel.¬†

That old man had been around the markets a *long* time at this point. He understood his own psychology well enough to understand that *he couldn't manage that trade,* even knowing as strongly as you can know in the market that *this shit is gonna make money.* It's not just about managing loss, or just managing psychology on the losing side. He understood that he did not have the ability to manage his flight response well enough to trudge through the drawdowns and keep that big bitch open. But, more importantly, he knew that he still had the foresight to catch the big one, and he knew how to execute that trade with as much effectiveness and as little mental strain as possible.

Obviously, I was not particularly upset with him for not sharing that position. He'd worked on it for a long time leading up to it and that was his baby for that year. I did tell him to fuck off with the dramatization though, as you should tell me for baiting you into reading this far down ;)

1. I already had a CAPM from 2023 where I used Joseph Phillips CAPM Udemy course so I had the foundational knowledge. Still took AR Udemy course (2x speed) to use as a refresher and because a lot of recs on his mindset portion. His Udemy mock was pretty easy, scored 87.
2. Started watching DM Agile questions on YouTube but felt it was too easy, was getting everything right. So I stopped after 20 questions.
3. Watched MR mindset video. Kind of redundant at this point with mindset but can‚Äôt hurt to further drill it in.
4. SH essentials. This humbled me a bit, most questions had 2 right answers so training to think of the best PMBOK answer was key. Also helped me train my brain for endurance. Took the two mocks, giving myself a 5min break at 33% and 66% marks. Got a 74% and a 76% on each mock.
5. Day before the exam I was feeling panicky, so I bought 3ThirdRock notes, only read the cheat sheet. I did find this helpful and would recommend it to bring everything together for a nice review.

Tried to sleep with my newborn waking me up every few hours, didn‚Äôt look at any notes before the exam, not something you can cram/memorize for anyway.

I took the exam online. No issues at all. Used both breaks for full 10min. I had a coffee on standby so a few quick sips and a visit to the restroom and back at it.
SH was def harder than the exam but still the exam had a lot of questions with multiple right answers, this is where mindset comes in. 
No strict formula questions but CPI/SPI does come up and so did PV/EV but more integrated into the question without using those terms. Just know each of them and +1 is good and -1 is bad. 
About 10 drag and drops, some were dicey, answer could belong to multiple categories.
Less than 24 hrs for pass notification.

My recommendation:
Take a video course for foundational knowledge. Get 3ThirdRock notes to review that knowledge. Learn the mindset. Practice SH. Take a day off before the exam, and get some rest the night before.",5,1739568806.0,pmp,1,1.0,False

New to the subreddit and first time post. I'm heading up the design/layout of a new coffee shop we're going to be adding to our somewhat large church (1.2K on Sunday mornings) in the next few months. We're starting from scratch but want to create a full-service shop. We'll be starting with a group of volunteers and a paid part time manager to run the shop on Sunday mornings and Wednesday evenings - so ease of use, training, and automation are very important. Budget is somewhat open, but don't want to overspend, but willing to spend the money on equipment, etc. that would make us faster, more efficient, and more consistent. Given these parameters, I have the following questions:

1. Which La Marzocco espresso machine would be best for our needs? Thinking a 3 group, but open to suggestions.

2. Are there any specific pieces of equipment that would be beneficial based on us doing a high volume of drinks in a relatively short amount of time?

3. I have a general idea of equipment layout, but any tips/tricks on maximizing workflow?

4. Any initial/ongoing training recommendations?

1ipljij,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1ipljij/advice_needed_for_inconsiderate_behaviorboundary/,Advice needed for inconsiderate behavior/boundary crashing from emotionally immature adult parents,"Hi all, this might be the wrong subreddit but I feel it‚Äôs relevant to my CPTSD journey because it ultimately has to do with emotional immaturity in an adult parent. A bit of context first.

I (28F) unfortunately still live with my mom (65F) and her 3rd husband (65M). I do the following:
-always clean up behind myself (and chronically clean up behind them, as they are both incredibly messy and don‚Äôt clean unless company is coming ‚Äî except to load/unload the dishes and take out the kitchen trash/recycling. No vacuuming, dusting, or mopping, and tidying is rare). 
-maintain ‚Äúmy area‚Äù of the house, including the guest bedroom & guest bathroom (my bathroom) as they are nearest to my room
-clean the house if they go out of town (my mom can‚Äôt handle me cleaning if they‚Äôre home and gets very anxious re: auditory input from vacuuming, doing dishes, etc ‚Äî this is a CPTSD trigger for her, though she probably doesn‚Äôt know it)
-handle all the pet care for our 2 cats
-pay all my own bills
-buy all my own groceries
-cook all my own meals
-do not use their groceries, and replace them promptly if I do
-largely leave them alone
-avoid making noise, esp. if I know they‚Äôre sleeping or watching a show. e.g. I never play music or have people over. If I‚Äôm watching something or listening to something, I wear my AirPods. Essentially, they have an all but silent roommate clear on the opposite end of the house from them
-have put myself through college
-have been working a job and going to school since 17

HOWEVER, I admittedly live here rent-free, which I know is a huge privilege. We moved out of my childhood home a year ago when they bought this bougie-ass $6k dream home. They are not well-off, but they pooled the profits from the sale of my late grandparents‚Äô 56 acre (very rural, very run down) property, my childhood home, her husband‚Äôs rental property, and their life savings in order to buy this waterfront property. They both come from poverty and have both been very frugal and responsible their entire lives, so they honestly deserve to have this very nice place. All that to say that I recognize this is their house and I have zero say in what they do here. (They chronically remind me of this via having very noisy sex that is obviously within my earshot). 

I‚Äôm not in a position to move out as I‚Äôm currently dealing with a career pivot and a minimum of one chronic illness, heaped on top of the overarching failure to launch that has resulted from CPTSD, SA trauma, and generally being financially and emotionally set up for failure from day one. I‚Äôm only just now starting to connect dots between my failure to thrive and my trauma, so I‚Äôm working to heal my triggers, develop better coping mechanisms, and gain financial and emotional stability. I‚Äôm job hunting like crazy right now and trying to move out of state to be with my LDR partner of 2 years by the end of this summer if at all financially possible.

The issue:

My mom and her husband do not extend basic courtesies as they would to a roommate. Specifically in this instance, they chronically schedule repairmen, contractors, and other company to come very early in the morning, and no matter when they‚Äôre scheduled, I‚Äôm never warned in advance.

I wouldn‚Äôt care except that this continually leads to situations like me coming out of my bathroom in a towel/robe (with the reasonable expectation that they‚Äôre rarely upstairs; I typically listen before coming out because I don‚Äôt feel very comfortable crossing the excessively long bathroom in a towel if my stepfather is nearby. This is out of courtesy, not because he‚Äôs creepy) and running smack into some random guy. This happened today, and last week I got trapped in my bedroom first thing in the morning when I really needed to pee because my mom decided to take a contractor on a tour of the house when he only needed to be in the kitchen, and then stood there in the hallway shooting the shit with him for like 15 minutes. I drink 2-3L of water a day due to my chronic illness, so this was pretty much torture. Also, it was like 8am and they were talking at full volume directly outside my door. 

On previous occasions, she has left me in the house alone with contractors I‚Äôve never met, once for 5+ hours before I even realized the man was there. I had been walking around the house in a towel getting ready for work because no one was supposed to be home, and I come out to see this dude I‚Äôve never met sitting at my dining room table. Obviously I freaked out.

Another time, one of her coworkers who had previous construction experience and would do odd jobs for us came by the house and saw me walking around in my pajamas, which were bike shorts and a tank top because I was in my own house and wasn‚Äôt expecting company, and literally wolf whistled me in front of my mother before saying, ‚ÄúCould you get those shorts any shorter?‚Äù She LAUGHED and didn‚Äôt even correct him, and this was after a long history of him making innuendos around both of us, so she knew how uncomfortable I already was around him. AFTER ALL OF THAT she gave him a key and had him working in our house when I was there asleep on multiple occasions. There were additionally several times she had him go into my bedroom to do odd jobs like repair a ceiling fan or mount black out shades, all without ever warning me, and I had personal things like undergarments out because I was at work and had no idea this creepy motherfucker would be there, let alone in my room.

On roughly 80% of these occasions, I‚Äôve kindly and calmly brought it up and asked for a heads up going forward, and for her to not leave me alone in the house with strange men. The other 20%, I‚Äôve just let it go and internally stewed over it. 

Every time, I‚Äôm met with ‚ÄúI forgot, give me a break,‚Äù or ‚Äúthis morning was really busy/x unexpected thing happened and distracted me,‚Äù or ‚Äúwell, you never come out of your room so how am I supposed to remember to tell you,‚Äù and countless other excuses for why she couldn‚Äôt have bothered to communicate. If I reiterate the request ‚Äî it‚Äôs very uncomfortable when this happens, here‚Äôs why, and I would appreciate if you could be considerate about giving me a heads up if someone will be in my space ‚Äî she just blows up and goes into ‚ÄúI forgot I was supposed to remember every single little thing‚Äù and basically ‚Äúget over it‚Äù sentiments. 

I realize I don‚Äôt have much of a leg to stand on here but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unreasonable to expect to be warned when they are going to be strangers in my space. Especially while dealing with a chronic illness that massively affects my energy levels, I frequently walk around the house in pajamas and it takes me several hours to wake up and be ‚Äúpresentable.‚Äù It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm in anything skimpy, but I think anyone would feel uncomfortable running into a stranger before they‚Äôve brushed their teeth/hair, washed their face, and put on real clothes (that is, a bra and not a vaguely revealing lounge set).

I‚Äôve made a couple of behavior modifications on my own, such as putting a coffee maker  and filtered water/grounds/mugs in my room, and keeping my robe on the back of my bathroom door in case I hear someone is outside and I need to cross the hall. I used to have a mini fridge with my breakfast stuff and snacks in there specifically because this happened so many times and I would wake up to find some guy working on our kitchen when I needed to eat breakfast right then so I could get to work/class on time. The mini fridge broke, so I don‚Äôt have that option right now.

I‚Äôm to the point I feel like I have to be constantly presentable in my own home. Or maybe I just need to get over myself and traipse past these randos looking like an absolute goblin. It just makes me feel uncomfortable and vaguely unsafe, and the bottom line is that I‚Äôm frustrated they don‚Äôt care to be considerate.

üìû Call a Friend. Even if it‚Äôs just to chat about nothing. Sometimes, a little human connection is all you need to remind yourself you‚Äôre never truly alone.

üçΩÔ∏è Take Yourself Out. Get that meal you‚Äôve been craving. Light some candles. Romanticize your own company‚Äîyou are, after all, excellent company.

üíÜ Self-Care Like You Mean It. Whether it‚Äôs a long bath, a new skincare routine, or just lying in bed with your favorite music, take today to pour love back into yourself.

You are worthy, radiant, and enough exactly as you are, no matter what this day (or the world) tries to make you feel. Valentine‚Äôs Day may belong to the couples, but every day belongs to you.

You're flawed. We all are. Even if we weren't looking for love on Reddit on Valentine's Day, we'd still have flaws. Great partners aren't great because they're flawless, but because their faults match up with our strengths and vice versa. We're not looking for our ""other half"", because that would infer we're not whole people and I don't know about you, but I'm pretty complete. I don't need someone to complete me, I want someone to share my life with and make all the good things better and the bad things easier, and for whom I do the same.

We can keep spending our time¬†*searching*¬†for perfect, when in a better course of actions is to¬†*make*¬†perfection. So, here's my proposal: I'll tell you a bunch about me, and if I sound ""good"", let's chat and see where things go.

**Me:**

38 years old with pics in profile, so please don't reach out and immediately ghost me after swapping a photo. I have 2 amazing girls (10 & 6) that I have a majority of the time. I know this is a dealbreaker for some so I'm putting it first to save some time. I'm a great Dad - I encourage them to try new activities and sign them up and always show up, which definitely impacts my ability to date so when I make plans with someone new I commit to them. While I'm happily open to being a bonus Dad if you already have kids, I've made the surgical decision not to have any more biological ones of my own - which I know is a dealbreaker for some other people, hence putting it out there.

I'm an ambivert - I love getting out with people, but typically only when I'm with someone/a group I'm comfortable with or I tend to feel out of my element. If I'm burnt out, I love a night in to relax - I mostly have no preference as long as I'm with someone I care about. I love to learn, so I take classes for random things when I can (took piano lessons for a while and some cooking classes last year). I love being outdoors and enjoy camping and nature walks, and I grill year round. I love to cook/bake, but really only do it when I have someone to do it for - I rarely make anything fancy just for myself. I love a mental challenge - trivia nights, escape rooms, puzzles, and board games are all right up my alley. I'm always open for trying something new because experiences are much more important to me than just ""stuff"".

I love being a good partner. I'm big on physical touch and will happily rub your shoulders/legs on the couch while we binge a show on Netflix. I'll remember your coffee order and surprise you with it at work, or remember your favorite candy or flower on my way home from work ""just because"". I'm a grown-ass man that is capable of cooking, cleaning, and all the other stuff it takes to make a household work; in short, I already have a mom and don't need you to fill that role. I'm a great communicator and tend to text a lot as I can be chatty, and I sometimes talk a lot about myself in situations not because I'm full of myself, but because I'm trying to empathize and feel the need to explain how I may understand how you're feeling (but I'm working on that!). I have a talent for making people feel heard, valued, and comfortable, and it's one of the things I like most about myself - in addition, I'm open-minded, honest, and always willing to compromise. Lastly, I'm GGG - which I add solely because sex is an important aspect to any relationship and to not mention it feels disingenuous.

**You:**

Very late 20's to early 40's. Self-aware and good at communicating. Interested in finding a partner to share life with, not to fill a void. Someone who has read this post and so far thinks I'm just what they're looking for, or really close to it. Physically - I'm not looking for a specific type of person as I find a lot of people beautiful, and for me a lot of that attraction is as mental as it is physical. Lastly - please be local, or already have plans to be local. I can't move with my children, so I'm locked into the area in which I live for at least a few years. I want to be able to give someone I'm dating a big hug good night, and sadly that's impossible to do via text or zoom.

My hope is that you see this: you meaning the person this post speaks to. You, as in the good person I'm looking for that with determination and luck, makes a perfect 'us'.

So please, reach out - I'd love to chat with you.",0,1739567818.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,0.5,False

1ipl6l0,https://www.reddit.com/r/prozac/comments/1ipl6l0/sleep_caffeine_my_journey_with_this_lil_pill/,"Sleep, caffeine & my journey with this lil pill","Hi! I am making this post for two reasons. **One** is to to encourage anyone who needs to hear it about and **two** is ask about sleep and caffeine.

**Background**: I have been on Prozac since November. I started at 10mg and lowered my previous SSRI (Paxil) to 10mg from 20mg which I had been on for over 10 years. Then, at the beginning of December I tapered fully off of Paxil and onto Prozac at 20mg. Mid-January I upped my dose of Prozac again to 30mg. For reference, I take a handful of other pills too lol - metformin, spiroloctane, and wellbutrin (150mg). I have sleep apnea so I sleep with a CPAP machine. 

  
**1.** I really started to experience symptoms when Paxil was fully out of my system. Light sensitivity, nausea, motion sickness, sensitivity to caffeine, heightened anxiety. I was prescribed propranerol to get me through the physical anxiety symptoms and Ativan to take as needed for my panic attacks. And *IT DID GET BETTER*! It is such a grueling journey to get to a place that feels good but I encourage you not to lose faith. I swear I could not function a month ago, had no hope in the medication, my ability to return to work or live without help and now I am so, so much more balanced. Sometimes, you just have to wait it out. 

**2**. Okay, to my Prozac veterans: I am suddenly unable to sleep through the night. Because of Prozac, I cut down my normal coffee intake by half about a week ago when I started getting more of a quicker heart beat/palpitation situation. That has more or less gone away but now I am having trouble falling and staying asleep. Has this happened to anyone? Specifically with caffeine withdrawal and prozac having this effect? Did it get better for you? And what kind of things have helped you sleep better? ",1,1739567671.0,prozac,0,1.0,False

1ipl63p,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ipl63p/me_38f_dealing_with_adhd_partner_41m_and/,Me (38F) dealing with ADHD partner (41M) and emotional reactiveness. How do I go about this?,"I am conflicted and I would like advice and support so I can see things that I may be missing out since I am too close to the issue. I have an ADHD (Dx, medicated) husband and we have a one-year-old child. Ever since our baby was born the issues have come to the forefront which I now feel like how did I not see this. My DH (M41) and me (F38) have been together for 3.5 years now and I am dealing with two major issues here:

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ADHD and incompetence (not weaponized)

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Emotional reactiveness

Let‚Äôs start with ADHD ‚Äì My partner suffers from ADHD which I had pointed out to him about two years ago. He saw a family doctor, got meds, gave up on them saying they don‚Äôt work within a month. Fast forward to our baby being born, his ADHD behaviour increased due to sleep deprivation and fatigue and caused major fights between us. He got himself evaluated and after confirmation got medicated. It‚Äôs been over a month that he has been taking his meds. Now, the issue here may seem like ADHD but it‚Äôs more than that. I believe people with ADHD who really want to better themselves and have a meaningful life make post it, lists, some mantra, etc. to keep them functional and on track. My husband does none. When we get into arguments, he will argue then come to an understanding and get hyped up about doing everything like ‚ÄúLet me print out a copy of the list of chores‚Äù, download audiobooks to understand the issue, but gets complacent as soon as I stop being mad at him. He basically works only on fear; keep him on a verge of ‚ÄúI am going to leave if you keep acting like this and then he will straighten up for a few days.‚Äù Once the threat is over, he is back to being his own self. This point also applies to his reactiveness. To give you examples, it‚Äôs small everyday things ‚Äì leaving the cat food dish on the coffee table (my toddler reaches the plate in the morning if I don‚Äôt get to it), leaving glass and ceramic accessible to the baby which she has dropped a few times, leaving a lighter on the coffee table, forgetting to wear his CPAP machine (It‚Äôs like I have to be responsible that he stays alive), forgetting to wear a watch at night for silent alarms, dirty baby bottles, leaving the bottle warmer on, forgetting to lock the doors at night, and everyday small things that you can think of. None of this is weaponized or intentional and I have tried to talk to him, show him ways, gone to therapy to a point where I feel therapy is not working anymore because he is not changing, explained how it feels to be me working with all of this and feeling like I take care of two kids instead of one. When I talked to him about leaving things accessible to a one-year-old, his comeback was as she grows, he will have to work on keeping everything higher and she will learn to get to it anyways. He actually forgot the part where she will be grown and we can teach her things and she won‚Äôt be acting like a one year old. I am frankly getting really tired of his incompetence. ADHD I may be able to work with but not working on his own ADHD is not something I can just let go.

The second thing is his emotional reactiveness. He is very sensitive to criticism. His mom is a covert narcissist and as a result he has very low self esteem. He gets triggered immediately and his anxiety levels are always high. This causes him to be emotionally reactive like yelling, becoming big with gestures, yelling, increased volumes, arguing endlessly and then realizing his mistake after a few hours to a day. An example of this ‚Äì My kiddo was very sick in the past month and I had not slept for two nights straight (Also, I am the only one who does night wake ups/feedings with her. He does not even realize that she is crying, so I haven‚Äôt slept full night from them time she was about a few days old.) So I asked him to stay home to take care of her with me so I could rest a bit. He got hyper-reactive at 5 am told me him going to work was the reason why we could afford Christmas gifts and he doesn‚Äôt understand why he should stay home when there is one able parent available to take care of her. This caused a major fight between us where I let him know that he would not be able to afford me if he had to pay me for childcare and taking care of the house. He eventually stayed home and later apologized for his outburst. But I have gone numb ever since that incident and I haven‚Äôt been able to be compassionate with him since. I love him but I do not like him most days. The worst part is that I am resenting him and myself too because since that day I feel like I am always angry, and I am not able to be patient with him and I get mad and stay mad at him. I tried therapy but even that doesn‚Äôt seem to help how I am feeling. He is saying that he is trying his best to work on himself but I don‚Äôt trust the change after seeing this feedback loop go over and over again. He gets worked up after a fight, starts a bunch of things, becomes the best husband; when I am nice and appreciative, he starts deteriorating, gets complacent, and back to square one again. (Usually a few months to complete the loop). Our therapist said my mind and my heart are not in sync; my mind is saying that I don‚Äôt feel safe and my heart tells me that I love him. So I am in constant fight with my own self either loving him and finding ways to work out or trying to run out of the door.

If it was just me, I would be out of the door months ago but being a stay at home mother with a toddler with no support, it is getting really difficult to deal with this. I want to be a stay at home parent atleast until my baby is three years old. Plus, if I separate now, I may have to find childcare for her and our finances will be strained even further. I am not sure how to go about this or how to even think about this. I start everyday thinking today will be better and I can only control myself. So I am going to work on my issues and my anxiety and let him do his thing. But I can barely get through half a day. Some days I make it through, but I feel ever so stressed. I know he loves me and I love him too but I know you can‚Äôt change a person‚Äôs personality, so it‚Äôs up to him. He needs guidance but is a good parent. But‚Äôs it‚Äôs like you have to teach him how to be an adult and how to feel too. He came a long way when we went no contact with my MIL and it makes me hopeful that he may change but I am not so sure. If he does, it‚Äôs going to be years and I don‚Äôt have the patience to be a parent to him and help him reprogram his childhood and his self esteem. I want to but I feel stretched thin. My main issue here is I don‚Äôt want to give up being a stay-at-home parent to my kiddo because I love being a part of her development. I am not sure how to proceed.",1,1739567632.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False
1ipl4rz,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1ipl4rz/500_am_hnd_arrival_plans_check/,5:00 AM HND Arrival Plans check?,"So I'll be arriving with my mother at 5:05 AM at HND. Do these plans sound generally sensible, and/or any suggestions?

Bear in mind that both of us would rather just stay awake once we land, rather than sleep right away. I don't want to jam pack day one's schedule, but I do think we'll both be awake for the day: 

* 5:05 - 6:30 approx: debarking, entry immigration. 
* Next: pick-up physical SIM card (my phone doesn't take E-SIMs) in arrivals. Unless the T3 BIC that opens at 7 is worth waiting for. 
* Next: drop off bigger luggage at luggage delivery counter for our hotel in Ginza. (Possibly move this after next step?). Keep only personal purses and possibly my small underseat wheeled suitcase. 
* T3 Onsen time! Clean, refresh, and soak. This is probably starting around 7:00-7:30 am? 

Now, I have questions from this point forwards: 

* There's a restaurant near the hotel's onsen but I couldn't find any hours or menu. Would it be open this early? It looks like a lot of the Haneda Garden area restaurants don't open until 11 AM otherwise, so breakfast options seem limited outside of airport conbini. I might not be hungry right away because they'll have fed us on the plane, but also, I'll definitely want coffee. 
* At this point, it's within rush hour to head straight to Ginza. Should we definitely skip the trains and get a bus? The trains would also take us right there, as we're near Higashi-Ginza station. 

Lastly: day one, I want to grab my mom a Traveler's Factory notebook, since she loves mine. Should I just head for the Tokyo station one when it opens at 10 am, or should we instead try to taxi to Nakameguro (which that store opens at noon)? If we head to Nakameguro first, we could maybe try to see the Starbucks Reserve Roastery (more TC options!). I know they tend to have waits too, but we could wander the area to admire cherry blossoms. Anything else interesting in that area? 

The alternative is just skipping Nakameguro altogether. I don't really have concrete plans for day one other than ""wander and enjoy"" 

days 2&3 in Tokyo are more planned and we'll be hitting Ueno/Asakusa, and then Kichijoji area around Ghibli Museum. Then the day before we leave, we'll be back in Tokyo, near Yotsuya station, so I figured if we still haven't been, that would be the right time for Shibuya or Shinjuku.

 The only other factor would be that we arrive March 29th, and the last full day we have is April 11th, so it's more likely we'd be getting to see cherry blossoms if we head off to Meiji Jingu/Yoyogi Park or Shinjuku Gyoen on day #1 rather than waiting. Would it possibly make sense to start over by like taking a taxibus to somewhere near Yoyogi park or Shinjuku Gyoen, then head towards Nakameguro or Tokyo station for the notebook, and end up in Ginza for check in? 

Any thoughts on if it makes sense to explore a different neighborhood in the morning and afternoon before heading to Ginza? Or should we go straight there?

PLEASE I need advice),"Ok this is the first time I'm able to tell the whole story, as it's been a few months and I've been able to better wrap my head around it.  
  
Please bear with me for how lengthy this will be.

I became friends with two girls in middle school, and those friendships blossomed into adulthood. I went to university abroad (in the USA; we live in a Caribbean country), and they went to university locally. We are from pretty different family backgrounds. I grew up with both parents married, with a HUGE close-knit family. One of them, Jennifer, never met her mother and grew up low-income with her dad only. Another, Nina, basically raised herself and grew up relatively low income. I grew up upper-middle class but connected with my friends over other similarities, and we did everything together. I brought them on vacations with my family, and they grew close. They met my college roommates, who came home with me for breaks, and we went out together. I moved back home after college, and our friendship blossomed now into adulthood‚Äî dinners, wine nights, games nights, parties.

However, there were a few fundamental things that we differed on. I'm 27 now, started my own business at 20, and earn significantly more than anyone else my age that I know. I out-earn my parents now. Jennifer freelances, and I'm not sure how much she earns‚Äî she does influencer-type content and hosting gigs. Nina chases men with money, and has always been open about that. She always wanted to be a stay at home wife/mom, and to be 'taking care of.' She does get men with money, so theoretically has more money than I do. I'm as supportive as I can be, but it was hard for me to empathize because I was raised to not rely on a man. She is extremely smart, has a medical degree, but gave her career up to stay at home.

Despite our differences, we remained close. When I met my boyfriend (now husband), he didn't quite understand my friendship with them. We were so fundamentally different. They were the type to post thirst-traps on social media for the male gaze, and he didn't like that I was associated with that. But he welcomed them, because they were my friends....but he sort of saw them as ""red flags.""

My boyfriend and I dated for 5 years before he planned to propose to me. I genuinely had no clue about the proposal, but he told my close friends, including Nina and Jennifer. Nina was dating her boyfriend for about a year at that point...who has a lot of money. 2 weeks before my proposal (which, mind you, at the time I didn't know I was getting proposed to...but my friends knew), Nina starts wearing an engagement ring. I asked her ""girl, are you engaged and didn't tell me?"". She says, ""Oh yeah but its not a big deal"" and I send her a congrats message and that I'm so happy for her etc etc. I thought it was weird that she didn't tell me, but alas, I'm happy for my friend! I asked her how it happened and she said her boyfriend gave her a ""promise ring"" and she said ""you know this is basically an engagement ring?"" and he said ""ok fine"". 

On the day of my proposal, my boyfriend invites my closest friends & family to come out after our private proposal to surprise me. He did it by the ocean at a place that has a lot of meaning to us and it was absolutely spectacular. I notice that Nina is not there. After the proposal she posts a pic of us on her instagram story saying congrats, and she messages me that she's not feeling well so couldn't be there. Jennifer is there and is celebrating us happily.

Now a few weeks after the proposal comes wedding planning. Jennifer and Nina, as two of my closest friends, are of course in my bridal party. Except Nina seems to keep casually dropping that she's migrating to the USA (out of the blue) and isn't sure when....because once she goes she can't come back due to permanent residency things. So I'm not sure if she will even be here for the wedding.

Anyway, I proceed with wedding planning. When it came time to choose my bridesmaids officially I asked Nina if her and I could have a talk. I told her I wanted to make her a bridesmaid but it seems like her life is up in the air with migrating countries, and I would totally understand if she can't commit to it. She said no no she can definitely commit and would work around my wedding. So I made her a bridesmaid.

To ask each girl to be my bridesmaid I painted a small portrait of a flower that reminds me of each of them, and wrote a card on the qualities I admired about them.

As a reminder, Nina is also engaged too, but she plans to elope and not have a wedding, and ball out on a trip to europe. Jennifer and I told her that we'd love to be there for her elopement, but she says she will probably do it with just her and her fiance. No problem if that's what she wants!

So my wedding planning continues; I didn't ask my bridesmaids for help with anything really (although I expect them to plan the bachelorette/ bridal shower). Jennifer reached out a few times to ask if I needed help with anything, but Nina never did. I rope in my maid of honor mostly for help (I had 2; my sister & college roommate).

One night, Nina calls me crying. Her fiance and her got into a huge fight due to him looking in her phone and seeing messages with men that she claims were from her past and had no overlap with him. He is shouting at her and it got very toxic. I stayed with her on the phone for close to an hour working through everything. She is questioning the relationship and they are supposed to elope next week. I tell her not to rush into marriage and to give it some more time and thought, especially after such a big blow-out fight. She tells me that she's pregnant...which now of course changes things. I still tell her don't rush to get married but to try to work it out with him, as now there's a child involved.

Nina elopes and casually tells us via text. We send her HUGE CONGRATS. Jennifer is in a long term relationship with a guy who Nina and I don't really like....he's weird and they go months without s\*x. But she pushes with the relationship anyway even though they have major issues. 

Jennifer breaks up with her weird boyfriend a few weeks before the wedding, which Nina and I are really happy about. I was SO proud of her for leaving that toxic relationship. She ends up making out with one of my fiance's best friends, who is a groomsman at the wedding. But it wasn't anything more than that.

The time of my wedding rolls around. I told my MOH what I wanted for the bachelorette and it's a very simple 1 night stay at a beach town an hour away, and going to a party. I drove the girls down to the airbnb, and we had a lot of fun that night. I kind of expected my bridal party to plan something special like even decor or something but nothing happened. 

About a week later my bridal shower happened which I later learned that Nina & Jennifer had little stake in, and my mom and maid of honor did most of it. They bought 2 bottles of alcohol and helped on the day with set-up. But the shower ended up being amazing and I was so happy.

During the week of my wedding, Nina says that she found out her baby's gender!! She found out on the Monday, the wedding is the Saturday. Jen & I ask what it is in our group chat, but she says she wants to do a gender reveal to reveal it to us. I thought it was strange because gender reveals are usually to reveal it to the parents of the baby, but she already found the gender out. She asks when we can do it and I tell her I'm so busy with wedding prep because it's the week-of but definitely open to do it when we get back to town after the wedding (the wedding is about 2 hours away from where we live). She says that can't work because she booked her honeymoon flight (to go to Europe) for the day after my wedding....the very next day. Her and Jen continue chatting in the group about the gender reveal but I was honestly so stressed, tired, anxious about my wedding that's now 6 days away that I didn't get to read most of it.

Now my wedding comes up. My husband and I rented out a villa for our bridal party and covered the majority of the cost. The bridal party just had to split food etc. We were staying for a week, and at villas like this you can either have the chefs buy everything and cook, or you buy all the ingredients and have the chefs cook it. The latter is way more affordable, so that's what I did. I asked for help with organizing to buy the things but I got no follow up so I did it pretty much by myself (probably my fault because I didn't ask again or insist and I do have an issue with just preferring to do things myself)....3 days before my wedding I'm running to multiple supermarkets to get all the food for our villa stay (we'd split costs up after).

The first night at the villa is the night of the rehearsal dinner, which my in-laws organize. Nina and Jennifer are driving together and end up coming late, but that's mostly fine. It's 2 days before my wedding day and I'm of course in pre-marital bliss. I'm so happy with all our family and friends together. That night, Nina and Jennifer are leaving the rehearsal dinner and told me that they're going to go ""set up"" at the villa. I'm like ""huh? set up for what?"" and Nina says ""the gender reveal of course"". Tears start forming in my eyes and I can't remember what I said but I just walked away and vented to my MOH. My MOH speaks to them and told them that the gender reveal can't happen right now. It's literally the night of my rehearsal dinner...I've planned this wedding for a year and a half. I know she didn't plan to get pregnant at that time and it just happened but surely the gender reveal could've been done before or after (???) Plus Nina already knows the gender. Nina and Jennifer leave and I stay for another hour or so, chit chatting with our family and other friends. When I get back to the villa, I go to Nina's room to talk with her about what happened. I told her my point of view, and she shared hers. She says something like ""Do you realize I didn't have a wedding?"" and I told her that she could've if she wanted to!!! They have money, there was nothing stopping it. She always said she wanted to just elope because she doesn't really have family. She tells me that it was just going to be a small private gender reveal in her room with the 3 of us; me, her & Jennifer. I tell her that I'm sorry but I don't want to do a gender reveal tonight. She says she doesn't want to talk about it more and I leave her room.

I run into Jen in the main house and she tells me that she didn't see the gender reveal as I big deal and I tell her that I'm disappointed that she just goes along with anything and didn't stick up for me (she is kind of ditzy and just goes along with whoever she is around at the moment).

The next day is awkward vibes at the villa but I try my hardest to have a good time. The girls aren't rallying around me, and Nina and Jen are chit chatting by themselves and practicing dance moves together. I feel sad, excluded and eventually cried at one point lol. Jen comes over to ask me why I'm upset.

My wedding day came, and the girls stayed with me in the house the night before. Nina and I didn't really speak at all. Jen and I are fine though. The day was beautiful and spectacular and the wedding was everything and MORE. My husband is just the best guy ever, and we have an amazing bond. Our wedding was by the sea at a beautiful house, and we had about 150 guests. When everyone was seated for the reception dinner, I notice Nina and Jennifer aren't there and end up coming into the reception dinner late because (I would later learn) they were in the bedrooms fixing their makeup. As the bride, my makeup was also peeling (the sun was extremely hot and kind of melted it) but I didn't stop to touch up.

We danced the night away and pretty early on Nina tells me she's leaving because she has an early flight to Europe the next day. I hug her goodbye and keep partying. It was the best night ever! Anywho, in the morning she sends me a text to say congrats ""Mrs X"" and that she loves me. I tell her I love her back and to have an amazing trip.  
  
That was the last time we spoke. It's almost like we both agreed without saying it that our lives are going in different directions and our friendship culminated at that point.

Now, Jennifer, because Nina was her ride to our wedding destination/villa and Nina left, has to return to our hometown with my husband and I. When the day comes to leave the villa, we drive her back and I hug her goodbye.

We have a groupchat with the bridal party where we all shared pictures etc and our bridal party all posted congrats etc on social media.

Nina and Jennifer are very active on social media, influencer types but not full blown influencers (maybe 15K followers), but they didn't post a single thing from my wedding day.

I didn't hear from Jennifer for about a month, and I message her and ask her if everything is OK, and she says that she's dealing with ""heavy feelings from the villa"". I told her I'm here to talk if she needs anything. A few more weeks go by and she reaches out and we meet up for coffee. She tells me that she was absolutely distraught that our ""trio"" broke up and she couldn't come to terms with it etc. I told her that I felt really sad about not hearing from one of my closest friends right after my wedding. We left the conversation mostly OK but I sort of felt....apathetic. Like I just didn't care anymore. I tried to put myself in Nina's shoes and Jennifer's shoes but I would NEVER in a million years do what they did to me, to them. I even told Nina that when we had our talk that night of the planned gender-reveal and she said ""of course you wouldn't because you're not that type of person"" whatever that means. If I were Nina, I would've planned a gender reveal totally separate from my best friend's wedding (I mean, I wouldn't do a gender reveal anyway because they're not ME but if I were, it definitely wouldn't be on the night of my closest friend's rehearsal dinner AT the wedding villa).  
  
I speak to my MOH who shared a room with Jennifer who told me that she felt really insecure at the villa because none of the boys were paying her attention (my husband's groomsmen also stayed there...including the one she made out with). He sadly just doesn't like her much and doesn't want to lead her on any further.

After the wedding, I grew closer to one of my other high school friends who I drifted from but remained friends with so she was at the wedding. Jennifer started inviting that friend to hang out too, even though they had no friendship really, even in high school. Then she invited the 3 of us to hang out together. I declined because I was extremely busy with work at the time. Jen asked if anything was going on and I told her with everything that happened I need a little space, which led into a LONG conversation which ended amicably‚Äî I told her my feelings about not posting a thing about the wedding when she posts EVERYTHING else (its not due to it not fitting into her ""aesthetic"" because she posted the brida shower, bachelorette and every event in her life).

Weeks later, I saw a ""dump-style"" post of herself only at our wedding villa (that I took), and I scrolled through all the photos she posted and saw that she also include Nina's gender reveal cake. I was so sad because it felt like a clear message to me.

We had our 10 year high school reunion recently and they posted a shoutout in the groupchat for everyone who is married, posting pics of each couple. Jennifer ""hearted/liked"" everyone's except for mine. She was literally a BRIDESMAID.

I keep trying to think what I did wrong, and I don't think I did anything dramatic except plan a wedding and not want to do the gender reveal on the night of my rehearsal dinner. My other friends have told me little things that they didn't like around the wedding including Nina & Jen always being together and excluding me. My other friends and husband think that they are far below my league lol but I know that's just them being nice friends and telling me what they think I want to hear (?). I know I have a lot going for me, a great relationship, great marriage, we bought a beautiful house recently, amazing family, good friends (minus the two close girlfriends I lost).

Nina had her baby too, a beautiful girl. It does make me sad that I was once ""aunty"" and now, nothing.

Please help. I think I need therapy for all of this haha.

1ipl0ya,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD_partners/comments/1ipl0ya/conflicted_about_the_stance_to_take_in_the/,Conflicted about the stance to take in the relationship.,"I am conflicted and I would like advice and support so I can see things that I may be missing out since I am too close to the issue. I have an ADHD (Dx, medicated) husband and we have a one-year-old child. Ever since our baby was born the issues have come to the forefront which I now feel like how did I not see this. My DH (41yrs) and me (38 yrs) have been together for 3.5 years now and I am dealing with two major issues here:

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ADHD and incompetence (not weaponized)

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Emotional reactiveness

Let‚Äôs start with ADHD ‚Äì My partner suffers from ADHD which I had pointed out to him about two years ago. He saw a family doctor, got meds, gave up on them saying they don‚Äôt work within a month. Fast forward to our baby being born, his ADHD behaviour increased due to sleep deprivation and fatigue and caused major fights between us. He got himself evaluated and after confirmation got medicated. It‚Äôs been over a month that he has been taking his meds. Now, the issue here may seem like ADHD but it‚Äôs more than that. I believe people with ADHD who really want to better themselves and have a meaningful life make post it, lists, some mantra, etc. to keep them functional and on track. My husband does none. When we get into arguments, he will argue then come to an understanding and get hyped up about doing everything like ‚ÄúLet me print out a copy of the list of chores‚Äù, download audiobooks to understand the issue, but gets complacent as soon as I stop being mad at him. He basically works only on fear; keep him on a verge of ‚ÄúI am going to leave if you keep acting like this and then he will straighten up for a few days.‚Äù Once the threat is over, he is back to being his own self. This point also applies to his reactiveness. To give you examples, it‚Äôs small everyday things ‚Äì leaving the cat food dish on the coffee table (my toddler reaches the plate in the morning if I don‚Äôt get to it), leaving glass and ceramic accessible to the baby which she has dropped a few times, leaving a lighter on the coffee table, forgetting to wear his CPAP machine (It‚Äôs like I have to be responsible that he stays alive), forgetting to wear a watch at night for silent alarms, dirty baby bottles, leaving the bottle warmer on, forgetting to lock the doors at night, and everyday small things that you can think of. None of this is weaponized or intentional and I have tried to talk to him, show him ways, gone to therapy to a point where I feel therapy is not working anymore because he is not changing, explained how it feels to be me working with all of this and feeling like I take care of two kids instead of one. When I talked to him about leaving things accessible to a one-year-old, his comeback was as she grows, he will have to work on keeping everything higher and she will learn to get to it anyways. He actually forgot the part where she will be grown and we can teach her things and she won‚Äôt be acting like a one year old. I am frankly getting really tired of his incompetence. ADHD I may be able to work with but not working on his own ADHD is not something I can just let go.

The second thing is his emotional reactiveness. He is very sensitive to criticism. His mom is a covert narcissist and as a result he has very low self esteem. He gets triggered immediately and his anxiety levels are always high. This causes him to be emotionally reactive like yelling, becoming big with gestures, yelling, increased volumes, arguing endlessly and then realizing his mistake after a few hours to a day. An example of this ‚Äì My kiddo was very sick in the past month and I had not slept for two nights straight (Also, I am the only one who does night wake ups/feedings with her. He does not even realize that she is crying, so I haven‚Äôt slept full night from them time she was about a few days old.) So I asked him to stay home to take care of her with me so I could rest a bit. He got hyper-reactive at 5 am told me him going to work was the reason why we could afford Christmas gifts and he doesn‚Äôt understand why he should stay home when there is one able parent available to take care of her. This caused a major fight between us where I let him know that he would not be able to afford me if he had to pay me for childcare and taking care of the house. He eventually stayed home and later apologized for his outburst. But I have gone numb ever since that incident and I haven‚Äôt been able to be compassionate with him since. I love him but I do not like him most days. The worst part is that I am resenting him and myself too because since that day I feel like I am always angry, and I am not able to be patient with him and I get mad and stay mad at him. I tried therapy but even that doesn‚Äôt seem to help how I am feeling. He is saying that he is trying his best to work on himself but I don‚Äôt trust the change after seeing this feedback loop go over and over again. He gets worked up after a fight, starts a bunch of things, becomes the best husband; when I am nice and appreciative, he starts deteriorating, gets complacent, and back to square one again. (Usually a few months to complete the loop). Our therapist said my mind and my heart are not in sync; my mind is saying that I don‚Äôt feel safe and my heart tells me that I love him. So I am in constant fight with my own self either loving him and finding ways to work out or trying to run out of the door.

If it was just me, I would be out of the door months ago but being a stay at home mother with a toddler with no support, it is getting really difficult to deal with this. I want to be a stay at home parent atleast until my baby is three years old. Plus, if I separate now, I may have to find childcare for her and our finances will be strained even further. I am not sure how to go about this or how to even think about this. I start everyday thinking today will be better and I can only control myself. So I am going to work on my issues and my anxiety and let him do his thing. But I can barely get through half a day. Some days I make it through, but I feel ever so stressed. I know he loves me and I love him too but I know you can‚Äôt change a person‚Äôs personality, so it‚Äôs up to him. He needs guidance but is a good parent. But it‚Äôs like you have to teach him how to be an adult and how to feel too. He came a long way when we went no contact with my MIL and it makes me hopeful that he may change but I am not so sure. If he does, it‚Äôs going to be years and I don‚Äôt have the patience to be a parent to him and help him reprogram his childhood and his self esteem. I want to but I feel stretched thin. My main issue here is I don‚Äôt want to give up being a stay-at-home parent to my kiddo because I love being a part of her development. I am not sure how to proceed.",8,1739567259.0,ADHD_partners,2,1.0,False

forgive me for any spelling mistakes that i may do, i am not native in a country that speaks english, i had to learn it on my own from youtube or other social media. these events may be scattered sa they are from poor memory so if you read this, bear with me a bit. i'm sorry, i am not much of a literature person to put my thoughts in order.

again, there will be a lot of it, so if you aren't interested in long messy thoughts, just scroll past.

before i begin, i want to give a disclaimer:¬†there are heavily suicidal tendincies, and overall very bad events, at least in my eyes they are



this swirl of emotions started in 2019. i (19 of age currently of this post) was 14 when this happened. i was in bed and the reality of my situation started to slowly settle in. i became aware of the things happening and in 2020 with the pandemic, since i couldn't go out even to buy bread or take out the trash, i was trapped in a small appartment with only my thoughts. heavy pulverizing thoughts. i was a mess, barely anything kept me going trough this time. drawing was my only stress release that i had. i actually like to draw, ever since i became conscious of my existence at 3 or 4? around there. i draw traditionally and digitally so this helped along with youtube entertainment.

now for the backstory and how i see it. i was born in a por family, i am the youngest actually. the youngest of all my siblings and even all my cousins. though the adults liked me because i was smaller, my siblings and cousins didn't like me. i was putting tantrums but at the end of the day, don't all kids until a ceratin age give tantrums and cry? i didn't know any better yet i felt they disliked me and only teased me or laughed at me instead. only when i was 14 i realized how touch starved i was, along with conversation wise. as a child i would talk a lot but they would tell me to shut up. i did like going outside but eventually that was taken away when i turned 12 or 13 for ""my own safety"" as the neighborhood isn't the safest. i was recommended to go outside in parks only with an adult or my brothers but each time i asked, they just said no.  
i know some of these phrases sound wrong but let me explain my family a bit. i live in a country where parents or other people leave it to work in other countries for a better life. my father (around his 50's at the time, he is around a decade older than my mother) he became an alc\*holic when i was in my mother's stomach. often i blame myself for that but i can't help it since it seems so obvious.. he never worked and i heard he hit mother (in her 40's at the time) but never us, his children. he loved us but just.. gave up to alc\*holism in the end. all people here do actually. i have some uncles and aunts that did too. with that in mind, my mother went to work in another country when i was 6 of age. my sister (she would be around her early 30's present time) was barely in her adolthood and had to take care of me and my 2 other brothers (29 and 24 present time). it was hard for all of us though i would of liked to see how my father was before being constantly intoxicated and to live longer with my mother. when she first left, i was devastated (i was a mother's child). to be 2 days on bus away from the parent you were so attached to broke me that summer. it was bad too. she took me with her over the summer, never told me a word about it and when we had to go.. we were in my uncle's car and i had my 2 aunts there, both my mother's sisters. i look back and the car door shut. i look around the car but my mother didn't hop on. i ask why she isn't coming with but they just drove off. that's what i remember at least and for 2 days, i constantly cried until i got home.



in general, we lived in constant filth and bad conditions, i heard the police was checking in since i was so young and no working parents were there in the house. they would of taken me to an orphenage if my sister didn't come up with excuses and such. i heard my best friends at the time were taken once but they were brought back. though that's not something that bothers me as much. though with my mother's income from the country she worked in, we slowly got better. better furniture, an actual floor (i heard it was cement before like on the streets or the sidewalks, though i don't remember that part) and started to have more food on the table. though slowly by slowly i was not a happy child anymore. there were only 2 people in my life that gave a penny about spending time with me. my mother that was now gone and my brother (29 at the moment, the second oldest). we will call him.. orlando. orlando was the one that spent time with me when he was home, though he liked to go out a lot when young, leaving me in the house, yet i never seem to mind it at the time. soon enough, he wanted a better life and went in another country too to work there, to earn his own money. ifelt alone that moment. i remember how he told me how he would go away in a couple of days in the bus going home on a dark night. i didn't know how to feel about it. when i was going outside, i was constantly in fear as my sister would put me to do homework, but by the time i finished, it was dark out. other times over a summer, she forced me to read and i wouldn't go out until i explained what i read to her. if i got something wrong, i would re-read every page. i remember distinctevly it was little mermaid too, the one where she jumps in the sea and becomes sea foam and ascends to the afterlife. yeah, the original one along with all the original tales. it's actually funny, i knew all the grim stories before i saw the disney ones and i remember looking at them and say ""they got the story wrong"". i remember failing geography and her response was giving me the notebook and telling me to learn it from head to toe, memorize it and have it in my head. i despised geography after that and the same thing, i had to tell her what i memorized. i started going to her boyfriend for that because he was more understanding and more easy going, not military style like she was. i was afraid to even go to her. i remember i even cried in the bathroom for something related to that subject. as that went on, eventually i was cut to not go outside at all anymore. i was locked in the house pretty much and the laptop that only opened cromebook would be what entertained me at the time. my sister.. let's call her ioana. on one hand, i disliked her for what she did but on another hand.. she was around the same age i am right now. she didn't know how to take care of us or what to do. then there was my brother (24 present). let's call him raul. raul, as children, he would play with me.. or against me. he liked to tease me but it was the only attention i got so i liked it. any type of attention, i wanted it. it was a mix of needing it and not having it? i can't explain but as a child i never realized anything. though he grew and started ignoring me. he went out with friends his age and i was left behind by everyone. eventually i was so deprived or starved of it that i just got used to it. anything like this felt awkward for me (back then and now as well, and i can't even do small talk, at all). it was to a point in life i started developing communication skill issues and not able to make friends, so i couldn't do what my brothers did. eventually, they started talking to me only if they needed something or just other things in general. never in my years when i came back from school did they ask how my day was, or barely a greeting. i closed up intensly, tried to bottle up anything and just go day by day. eventually days started blending in together. grades were above the minimum requirement. the minimum was 5/10 so i was able to get from 6 or 7 to 9. rarely some 5's or 10's. i liked math a bit. calculus just seemed better than literature. i MUCH rather preffered math than reading. that's how bad it was. i would cry at the sight of a book being handed to me and being told to read it. as those days blended in, eventually one of my cousins started spending time with me. she vented to me about every day stuff, about her boyfriends, her highschool and some lies but i didn't care. i just liked the company she gave me. i had my flaws as a person back, but she left me for something that was out of my control. it was something stupid but she found it so important that she cut all ties with me. i never cared or bothered to see how she was really. we are just aquantances now. though overall, those years made me.. bland. they made me not really understand things. i elt that i didn't feel emotions like others my age do. i never even wanted a relationship really. i never thought about it or anything of the sorts. it was just.. bland. at 14 i realized my family situation and that was my starting point of somewhat craving more interactions. yet.. i didn't know how to ask for that. my social skills were so deprived i couldn't say anything or ask for help. i didn't know how. i tried leaving some hints here and there, a facebook post was a clue but my sister was so mad about it that she told me to delete it, called me illiterate and threatened me that if i really feel that way, she would give me a reason to do so. yeah.. cinderella was her example honestly. so i never asked for help again. i started becoming.. well.. having tendencies to off myself at 14. i would look at cars, high places and even incoming trains and started imagining how it would be if i just took.. one extra step. ways to handle a knife against me, so many hurtful things, my mind became a dark place and just grim. things a 14 year old shouldn't even be thinking of. yet, i never said anything. why should i? and if i did, to who? well, 2019, my mother came back and wanted to settle in so she went trough a divorce with my father. all that was done and all we needed was to kick him out but.. he died. yes, he died. he had a heart attack, yet i didn't know what to do in that situation. it.. it was new.

i remember that day clearly though. i cam from school and i was laying in bed, looking on my phone. i heard some strange noises and came to check. my father was laying down. the wardrobe of clothes over him and covering him (we had a wardrobe made of plastic bars and a cloth with a zipper) and i just.. didn'y know what to do. my mother eventually came home, got him sitting up then laid him down and called the ambulance. apperently he had a heart attack and she knew somewhat of what to do since she experienced it before at a working place in the other country. he died in the hospital. ioana sat me down and told me he died. i didn't cry. she did. she hugged me but i just.. didn't cry. it felt surreal in a way. i didn't cry when i saw his body either. only when i saw orlando cry did i shed a few tears as well but that was it. they called him a friend, but i barely have moments with him rather than a few smiles and jokes he did for me. or when he did hold me because i was in pain over a scar in my foot, very deep and bad. but it was.. they were most likely talking about a man i never personally met. it made me think of so many things, emphasize on the thoughts how it was my fault. but i was just.. not crying. i was constantly too exhausted, burned out, tired. no ammount of coffee, energy drinks, sugar or green tea could give me energy. in 2020, the pandemic struck so my bad thoughts only amplified. no one in my family wanted to buy me netflix so i could watch some movies myself, yet they had access to it. i gave up on that idea, knowing i will never get it. it became the least of my concerns.

after that, the years just.. went by again. in 2022, i lost my only grandfather (mother's side) and my grandmother (father side). my grandfhater from my father's side left this world before raul could even be born himself. i had no chance really. he died of heart failure, just like my father and his brother that also died of it. then my grandmother's sister and brother died as well and she was the only one alive in her family now. very.. grim period of time but i didn't feel anything. my grandfather was more of a father to me really. we didn't exchange much but yet, he was a good man. i didn't cry at any funerals really. 2022 was.. a blur for me. but on 23rd of december, 2022, i remember it so clearly. i woke up and i felt a few symptoms of being sick. i brushed them off. eventually i go online and talk to my girlfriend (i have a long distance relationship ever since 2018. i never thought of dating, yet it just happened. we made it official in 2020 but we celebrate the anniversary of when we first hit it off). i also talked to.. 3 people mainly online, including my girlfriend. let's call her angela and the friend bob. he doesn't deserve a good fake name.



me and bob met in 2020 and became friends. crackhead level of fiends. eventually he developed a crush on me but i rejected him because i had a girlfriend, i am a guy, he liked a fake portret of exactly the things i hate about myself and he wasn't even my type anyway. usually i don't go with a specific gender or sexuality. i swing it because it is too complicated for me. too many sexualities and genders and too many people get offended so i don't engage much in it. though bob was not it for me. friends, yes i can see that. lovers? god no. it was like dating a brother. and he wasn't even joking, he actively tried to break me up with my girlfriend too and even said he did so he would have a chance with me. thing is, he says he is straight. i uh.. doubt it. we started getting in fights trough 2022 actually and then the cherry on top was on 23rd december, 2022.

i had been in a burnout state for months now. i didn't want to do anything, i was constantly thinking of offing myself and drawing was.. something i couldn't do at the time but slowly by slowly i had the motivation to draw again. i started to get sick slowly too. on that day, i woke up, went to my laptop and saw that they wanted to talk to me in a groupchat. (all of us live in different countries so discord it was). apperently, angela developed a crush on bob. it.. broke me to say the least. i shed a few tears but never made a sound. any man would of broke up with their partners if that happened but thing is.. she was the only thing at the time keeping me going. i couldn't leave her. what did i do? i pushed trough my sickness and burnout to play games with her and voice chat her. bob said he didn't like her so he wanted to make her not crush on him anymore. apperently it happened because i wasn't as active as before and he was. i was getting more sick by the day and i don't know how it went next but it got to a point that she just said i won her over again? i.. didn't exactly believe it. but this was just the start!



on 29th, bob recommended me an emulator for nintendo games and i downloaded it on my laptop. i thought i downloaded it wrong so i wanted to uninstall it to try again but lord and behold. it asked me ""would you like to delete all files with it?"" or something along the lines. when i installed this emulator, it gave me 6 other files on the laptop so i thought it reffered to those. no. i was wrong. so very wrong..it deleted everything. everything. all my memes, photos.. my drawings i spent hours to do. 3 years of my life, all the time i invested in those drawings.. gone right before my eyes. i couldn't recover them. 3 days, i spent 3 days with angela and bob to try anything to recover them.. nothing. i couldn't do anything anymore. i broke. it was so traumatic, i cried like i did when i left to go home and my mother was left behind. my news years were spent with me denying it. i was at my lowest. i was so sick i only ate pills. my sweat was so bad, it scratched my brain. i couldn't stand up as i was dizzy. i asked my mother to get me to a doctor but she told me i could sit it out (i could of been checked over for free too as i was a student in highschool still) and i was trully a mess. depressed, sick, and unmotivated for anything. then what did bob do in these trying times? he knew exactly what i was going trough so, as the great friend he was, he showed angela screenshots of a mistake i did in 2021. it never happened again and it was an accident too. yet he kept saying ""i couldn't hide this from her any longer. new year, new me. i want to treat my friend better"". she despised me. she didn't talk to me for about a month, january. i trully had no one. my family told me i didn't lose much, the 2 people that i hoped to help me went behind my back and broke me, bob still wanted to make it all about himself and i was seriously considering to off myself in that point. there was nothing for me. the 3rd friend was understanding enough. he was the only composed friend i had and tried to help me. and trough him and the other 2 friends he introduced me to, i met a girl. she is about 2 years younger than me. we talked and we became best friends. she helped me so much, she made me smile and laugh when i felt the whole world was against me. she was the greatest friend and gave me the comfort i needed really. i wish she would of met me when i was more composed because when she met me, there wasn't any voicechat that i wouldn't cry in. i'll call her iulia. iulia and i were the new crackheads, thinking of eachother's sentances and thoughts, sharing the same braincell. eventually, angela forgave me for this one mistake i did in 2021, she admited she didn't want to take it out on me like this but the damage was done already really. me and bob talked for a while but i was not having his shit anymore. he is blocked. permanently. angela saw his bullshit too and blocked him too. she is perfusely remorseful of what she did. though, after that i had to just.. get back on my feet and go to school, do p.e. when i barely had any strenght in me, learn for the batchelor exam, be stressed about driving school, then stuff went quiet. the most simplest of exams made me have breakdowns. i didn't do good under pressure anymore but i was able to pull it off. i finished and college stuff happened. i wanted to take 1 year break off college for my poor mental health but i either went to college or worked a job. i am currently in college and struggling to keep up. though.. that's mainly it.



all this had been bothering me for a few days now. one morning i had a huge battle in my head, thinking about all this and it made me pant so much, i felt like i was about to cry on the streets. i don't have money for therapy and i cannot afford telling my family any of this because one way or another, they won't believe me, won't give it too much mind or i won't even be able to tell them as i cannot speak my mind at all.

to whoever came this far in reading this mess, sorry for wasting your time. but at the same time, thank you. texting it was a bit more helpful but not by that much. though we will see if reddit even keeps this post up because my last posts were disabled for no apperent reason.

update: so my gf loved another man for a month now. i finally broke up with her over this and i unblocked the other guy. i actually scheduled an appointment with a therapist and i had a nice christmas honestly. i noticed i was so broken, the breakup barely bothered me. but i am relieved now.



  
My Response -->    Hello, as someone who was anonymously referenced in this post after reading through this, I've noticed its heavily one sided leaving much vital information out. I am ""Angela"" as mentioned in the post. This post was brought to my attention from a former friend who was also anonymously referenced. After giving much thought I've decided its best to just give my side, and the important information left out. Me and OP met online in 2018. At first we were just friends and towards 2019 we joked about being in a relationship. Keep in mind i was like 12 when OP first talked to me and they were around 15......

OP didn't officially ask me to be their gf until 2020 (I think?). It started off good, we were great friends before hand and spent time together. This was during COVID and so I wasn't really interested in the real commitment of an in person relationship, at the time I was content. OP later introduced me to ""Bob"" and another friend. Both friends had former crushes on OP. One of the friends (not ""bob"") eventually developed a crush on me and when I brought it to OP's attention, they rubbed it off and didnt do much despite me expressing how uncomfortable I was. At first I didn't think much of their behavior but this would leave me hurt slightly. Fast forward to Christmas/New Years 2022, OP stopped showing as much interest. It took longer for them to respond and asking to do things like call and play games were a rarity.

At this time ""Bob"" spent a great deal of time talking, calling, and making time for games. I grew fond of this attention since OP and my in person friends didn't talk or do much with me. I tried bringing it to OP's attention the lack of quality time but they were stressed with school and other things so I tried to not let it bother me, trying to understand their position. This would continue through November to December and around this time was when I grew really fond of ""Bobs"" time. It gave me something to look forward to and excited about. Lack of time and attention from OP I developed what i thought was an innocent crush on ""Bob"". 

I will say this now, I never had any intention of acting on this at all. I knew the only reason was due to deprivement of interaction and time from OP. I told ""Bob"" about it and I said I'd tell OP, a few weeks later i did. OP I think understood, at least to an extent, and we talked through it, all 3 of us. Towards the end of December when it all died down ""Bob"" asked me if I wanted to know something. He said it might destroy the relationship between me and OP, but I agreed to know. ""Bob"" told me that OP had been cheating and hiding it behind my back since October 2021, OP hid it. ""Bob"" showed me screenshots of inappropriate roleplays and conversations with multiple people, ""Bob"" included. He said OP hadn't told him they had a gf till sometime after they confessed. ""Bob"" also showed screenshots of messages between him and OP where he confronted OP about said roleplays and OP denied it. At first when OP introduced me to ""Bob"", he had asked a question ""Do you think someone having inappropriate roleplays is cheating? I now knew why he had asked this when we first met

I confronted OP about this, obviously very upset by the information. I will admit I may have responded harshly and argued a lot but I was highly hurt. All OP could say was ""I'm sorry"" and ""I promise it wont happen again"" and refused my wishes to cut contact with the people who they had the roleplays and conversations with. ""Bob"" was helping both sides in a neutral way when we would need a break from 1 on 1 contact. I was very upset about OP hiding that, I felt like it was something I could of fulfilled Instead of random people and friends. I was mad at myself and OP. I told them that I was going on a break from them till I had time to calm down and think about it, and also give OP time to think about what they did and the situation and if we wanted to continue going forward, OP agreed on this break. 

Things kind of mellowed out but we were distant. Trust was broken in a way it wouldn't ever heal again. All of 2023 I especially became emotionally distant and towards OP and October-December started spending a lot of time with a guy from school. Every day almost we would call and text and spend time together. Interaction with OP was still slow taking hours between 1-2 few worded messages and rarely played games. I did have feelings for 2 months and informed OP about it. And I wanted to try it out. Growing up I realized My love language was quality time, presence, food, and physical affection. Most of these were never achieved with an online relationship and alot with OP and the future was unclear. Due to me wanting to attend collage and living in the U.S, and OP attending collage and living in a different country, unwilling to move to the U.S. I would try to plan for possible future plans if we ever wanted to make it work and such but OP couldnt even guarantee we would ever meet or see each other in person.

   I weighed out the pros and cons and chose the other man. I never felt like it was a relationship after what went down with OP and I felt very attracted to the other persons personality and behavior, traits, and looks. I've felt more loved and cared for in 3 months then in 3 years. I still get the same level of energy and time and even more then when we first met compared to OP who left me with excuse after excuse after excuse. I can be more intimate with this other person then I could of possibly ever been with OP. I see a future with this person, OP was never really interested in marriage and future family and stuff but the other person is and I love that. 

I feel relieved. Even OP themselves told me they never felt like it was a relationship after the situation in Christmas/New Years 2022, and neither of us really broke up with the other because we were already basically broken up. I'm not saying what I did was entirely in the right but neither was OP's and I felt the need to speak out about it, and if a innocent crush is cheating, so is inappropriate roleplays and conversations. I have no intention in furthering indirect contact with OP so I'll leave it at this unless it gets deleted or something. Oh yeah OP, and giving some girl who helped you so much when YOU broke my heart a name HIGHLY similar to mine is a dick move. Thank you for reading both sides, hopefully the last interaction from me, ""Angela"".

1ipkype,https://www.reddit.com/r/Carolinepolachek/comments/1ipkype/carolyn_in_welcome_to_my_island/,'Carolyn' in Welcome to my Island,"In Welcome to my Island, Caroline is in a coffee shop and is handed her coffee which says 'Carolyn'. Besides it simply being a fun detail of a common occurrence (barista shouted out 'Flora' last week when my blueberry matcha was ready - it is a pretty name but quite off my real name!).... do you have any guesses on what might be the significance of that? 

I was watching Door before that and Door is a good 'origin story', about a girl who worked hard to prove herself through her music but had to experiment a lot and deal with imposter syndrome and the feeling of being 'just another girl in a sweater', but knowing she is destined for more. Makes you almost wonder if she wrote it in response to something big happening in her world, from a music perspective (e.g., meeting a big wig who told her he'd listen to one song)... but we know its deeper than that. It sounds like a spiritual door but also doubles as an ode to a lover who really saw her and gave her the confidence to go for it. Welcome to my Island is about introducing herself to the world through her music.... maybe opening the album with a scene where her name is written wrong is about reclaiming who she actually is (Caroline not Carolyn), while acknowledging that it was never personal that people didn't know who she was... that she was somehow musically misrepresented (after writing for other artists for so long)? But with Welcome to my Island, Carolyn can finally be herself. ",9,1739567095.0,Carolinepolachek,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm not 100% but I would say I‚Äôm about 80-90% recovered from this mental illness. Previously it was ruining my life. I wanted to share some things that helped in case anyone is still struggling. 

1. Anna Christie‚Äôs podcast ‚ÄúEmetophobia Help.‚Äù She‚Äôs also responsive to email! Which I find really kind of her. 

2. Ken Goodman‚Äôs book ‚ÄúThe Emetophobia Manual.‚Äù There are some criticisms I have about the book and Ken in general (for instance when he was a guest on Anna Christie‚Äôs podcast he kept interrupting her üòí) but in general his book helped me. I thought some of his exposure videos were a little unnecessarily graphic, and also some were also vulgar for no reason? But his overall content helped me. 

3. Meditation‚Äîthis helped me not believe my thoughts. I also joined r/meditation. It definitely helps to practice meditation when you are calm so it can help you when you are panicking. 

4. I personally stopped using THC and alcohol. These substances made my anxiety, OCD and phobia much much worse. 

5. I stoped drinking coffee on an empty stomach. 

6. I don‚Äôt read panic posts on Emetophobia groups like this one. 

7. I gained more trust in my body on a spiritual level. My body tells me when it‚Äôs time to sleep, to eat, to sneeze, to breathe‚Äîbeing sick is no different. Trust your body will tell you. 

8. This is somewhat vague, but I approach life with a recovered mindset. I try to embody what a nonemetophobe would do. I eat sushi, I go for long car rides, I sit in the middle aisle of a packed theater. I just do it. What will be will be. Most of the times I‚Äôve pushed myself the result has been good. 

9. I watched a lot of exposures and tried interoceptive exercises described in both the podcast and book mentioned above. 

10. I use anti-anxiety medication very carefully and sparingly, but when I really need it. One thing Anna Christie said that helped me a lot was if you really need it, use it. I still take 1/2 pill of my meds for airport travel, for example. While I feel it‚Äôs a bit of a crutch, I‚Äôve also made peace with the fact that it‚Äôs okay to make yourself feel better sometimes.

We were gearing for one more ER when I unexpectedly became pregnant between cycles. Were thrilled and ‚Äúgraduated‚Äù early to OB.

# üß†¬†[Gemini AI Can Now Recall Past Conversations](https://www.theverge.com/news/612638/google-gemini-ai-advanced-recall-conversations)

Google's Gemini AI has introduced a new memory feature that allows it to recall past interactions, providing users with a more context-aware and personalized chatbot experience.

Google‚Äôs Gemini AI assistant¬†[can now recall past conversations](https://blog.google/feed/gemini-referencing-past-chats/)¬†to provide more relevant responses if you have a subscription to Gemini Advanced via Google One AI Premium. With the update, you‚Äôll no longer have to recap previous chats or search for a thread to pick up a conversation, as Gemini will already have the context it needs.

You can also ask Gemini to summarize previous conversations and build upon existing projects. Google already widely rolled out the ability for¬†[Gemini to ‚Äúremember‚Äù your preferences](https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/19/24300709/google-gemini-chatbot-memory), but this latest update takes things a step further by letting the chatbot reference discussions from the past.

You can review, delete, and manage your Gemini chat history at any time by selecting your profile picture in the top right corner of the Gemini app and then selecting ‚ÄúGemini Apps Activity.‚Äù

Gemini‚Äôs recall feature is rolling out now to Google One AI Premium plan subscribers. You can try out the new recall feature in English on Gemini‚Äôs web or mobile app. Google says it plans on bringing the feature to more languages, as well as Google Workspace Business and Enterprise customers in the ‚Äúcoming weeks.‚Äù

ChatGPT¬†[can similarly recall details](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8590148-memory-faq)¬†and preferences from past conversations.

**What this means:**¬†This advancement brings Gemini AI closer to human-like memory, improving long-term assistance but raising privacy concerns about data retention. \[[More on Gemini AI](https://blog.google/technology/ai/gemini-ai-memory/)\] \[[Listen](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/ai-unraveled-latest-ai-news-trends-chatgpt-gemini-gen/id1684415169)\] \[[2025/02/15](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/master-ai-machine-learning-pro/id1610947211)\]

# Anthropic is reportedly on the verge of launching its next-generation Claude AI model, which could bring significant improvements in reasoning, accuracy, and multimodal capabilities.

* The hybrid approach will allow the new model to function as either a standard LLM or a deep reasoning engine, adapting to different use cases on demand.
* The model will also introduce a sliding scale system that lets developers precisely control how much reasoning power to allocate to each query.
* At maximum reasoning, the model reportedly shows particular strength in real-world programming tasks and can handle large-scale codebases.

YouTube has officially integrated Google‚Äôs Veo AI-powered video generation tools into Shorts, allowing creators to generate, edit, and enhance videos with AI directly within the platform.

* Creators can generate video clips or dynamic backgrounds for Shorts with text prompts and can specify styles, camera effects, and cinematic looks.
* The update enhances the existing Dream Screen feature with faster generation times and improved physics for more realistic movement and scenes.
* All AI-generated content will include Google‚Äôs SynthID watermarks and clear labeling to maintain transparency about artificial content.
* The feature is launching first in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand through the Shorts camera interface.

**What this means:** This update injects state-of-the-art AI video directly into the workflows of content creators across YouTube, taking a giant leap from just backgrounds to full clips and scenes. While this unlocks new creative possibilities, it will likely blur the already fuzzy lines between real and AI content even further. This marks a significant leap in AI-driven content creation, making video production more accessible and efficient while reshaping the landscape of short-form media. \[[More on AI in YouTube Shorts](https://blog.youtube/)\] \[[Listen](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/youtube-integrates-google-veo-ai-video-generation-tools/id1684415169?i=1000692277544)\] \[[2025/02/15](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/master-ai-machine-learning-pro/id1610947211)\]

Google's Gemini Flash 2.0 has claimed the top spot in the latest AI agent performance rankings, surpassing competitors in speed, accuracy, and efficiency.

* The leaderboard evaluated 17 top LLMs on 14 benchmarks, including tests on tool usage and selection, long context, complex interactions, and more.
* Flash 2.0 led with a 0.938 score, outperforming more expensive competitors while excelling across the board on benchmarks.
* Open-source models are closing the gap, with Mistral's latest Small release achieving scores comparable to some premium offerings at lower price points.
* DeepSeek‚Äôs V3 and R1 models were absent from the testing due to a lack of function calling support but will be included if the capabilities are added.

Work/area of study: I am a full time student studying ultrasound! I‚Äôll be graduating in four months! Until then I‚Äôm putting myself through school by working in a coffee shop and nannying on the weekends. 

Hobbies: I really love being active and adventurous. Exploring, hiking, snowboarding, the gym and even Brazilian jiu jitsu have become recent undertakings :). I sometimes play video games, and I also really love baking for my friends and crocheting. 

Christian journey: I am a reformed baptist. I grew up in a Christian family but didn‚Äôt take the faith seriously until my late teens when I realized my parents salvation wasn‚Äôt at all sufficient to save me, and only Christ is. Some of my favorites pastors are Voddie bauchaum, James white, and I really like the evangelist Ray comfort. 

I‚Äôm definitely looking for a husband on here. I believe dating should be intentional and so I‚Äôm only looking to date a man I see myself marrying:). More specifically, a man of the Lord. Someone who would be a spiritual leader for his family, be a provider and a protector. I have traditional views and would love to be a stay at home mom, so hoping to find someone that also appreciates that:). Something really important is that I‚Äôm looking for my best friend. I want someone that can laugh with me, have constant jokes and be there through the hard times. I want to support someone in the same way!

Age range: 23-32

Location: I‚Äôm currently finishing up classes in NY, but I‚Äôll be moving to Maine to be closer to my family and siblings. This is a total non negotiable for me that I don‚Äôt see changing. I just want to be honest. :).

Here's a recipe for Wacky Cake with no eggs, butter, or milk. This cake has been shared multiple times in this sub, but I thought it was a good one to start a new discussion about eggless recipes. 

I got this recipe from my Aunt Gloria years ago, but have modified it slightly based on other Wacky Cake recipes I've seen. I increased the cocoa from Gloria's 1/3 cup to 2/3 cup and use 2 TBL vinegar rather than Gloria's 2 tsp. I have also added espresso powder and chocolate chips.

Wacky Cake, also known as Depression Cake or War Cake

Servings: 9x13 pan or 18-24 regular-size cupcakes

Ingredients

3 cups (13.2 oz) all-purpose flour

1 1/2 cups (10.5 oz) granulated sugar

2/3 cup (1.6 oz) cocoa (I like Penzey's full-fat non-Dutched)

2 teaspoons baking soda

2 teaspoons instant espresso or coffee powder (optional)

1 teaspoon kosher salt (or 1/2 tsp fine table salt)

2 Tablespoons white vinegar

1 Tablespoon vanilla extract

2 cup cold water or cold coffee

3/4 cup (6 oz) mild flavored oil

3/4 cup (4.5 oz) chocolate chips (optional)

Directions

Preheat oven to 350F / 180C. Grease 9x13 pan or line 18-24 muffin cups.

Sift flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, and salt into a large bowl. Mix vinegar, vanilla, oil, and water in a separate bowl.

Shortly before baking, add the vinegar mixture to the flour mixture. Stir by hand until only a few small lumps remain. Pour batter into pan or muffin cups. Scatter chocolate chips evenly over the top of the batter.

Bake in preheated oven until a wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean and temperature in the center is 175-180F / 80-82C. Time: 35-40 minutes for 9x13 pan, 20-25 minutes for cupcakes. Remove from oven and cool to room temperature on a wire rack.

I‚Äôm a blend of creativity and curiosity, with a knack for finding beauty in the ordinary. I‚Äôm happiest when I‚Äôm exploring a new city, diving into an engrossing book, or losing track of time in a great conversation.

Travel is a huge part of my life‚ÄîI‚Äôve visited Canada, the USA, Colombia, the Bahamas, and Mexico, and my wanderlust isn‚Äôt slowing down. Bonus: I speak Spanish, so we can plan trips to some incredible destinations!

Seattle isnt that bad.,"I was at starbuks in downtown Edmonds today, getting my over roasted over priced coffee fix for the week when this lady and her kids come in. Kids looked probably like 10ish or so. She went up to the counter and asked for the restroom code (without buying anything). Lady behind the counter was very polite and asked if she needed the mens or the women's restroom code.

The lady looked at her point blank and said ""I dont care. We are all going in together, Im not leaving my kids unattended in Seattle. Ive seen on the news what kind of people live here and I cant wait to go back home in MO so I can finally feel safe again. I dont know how you people live like this.""

Lady behind the counter raised an eyebrow, gave her the code then asked if she would like anything to drink or eat. She said no.

The barista replied no problem and told her to have a great day, to which the leech said ""Ya whatever.""

I get that Seattle has a crime problem, but when compared to other large cities, its not like the news makes it out to be. Plus Edmonds is not Seattle. Yes, I know it has crime, everywhere does.

Hell, I was there at the fishing pier when that dude got shot. But thats probably going to be Edmonds one big crime event for the year. Its one of the safest places in the state (thats a biased opinion.) 

And Idk where she lives in MO, but last time I was in Joplin, almost the entire city had fent zombies everywhere (Jan 2024), more than ive seen in Everett and Seattle combined. Branson and St Louis were no better once you left the tourist area.

I have been telling myself I don't really deal with sleep inertia because I don't sleep through my morning alarms, but I'm analyzing my patterns and realizing sleep inertia is definitely an issue for me.

I wake up to my morning alarms pretty well. I do hit snooze twice which allows me to wake up kind of gradually with each alarm, which feels like it helps. I think working from home has been a gift and a curse for me when it comes to my sleep issues, but it's mostly a gift because I feel like I'm barely surviving even when all I'm doing is walking to a desk in the other room. I get out of bed, wash my face, sometimes make coffee, and sit down at my desk. At that point I'm feeling groggy but somewhat awake, and I'm always clocked in on time. But I do start getting gradually sleepier and sleepier once I'm sitting at my desk, and usually the microsleeps start an hour or so into my shift. I have been just muscling through (on bad days falling asleep 20 times over a couple of hours) because I don't know what to do to combat it. I've tried listening to energizing music and sometimes it helps because I can get really into the music and it can kind of wake me up, but then I'm focused on the music and not on my work, and I end up really overstimulated. I also feel like I need to be staying in my seat most of the time obviously, so I can't really walk around to keep myself awake, though maybe I could set an hourly alarm to walk around my apartment or something.

Currently I don't allow myself to take naps until my lunch break that I usually take around 11am. I'm considering allowing myself a brief nap earlier than 11am. It sounds like I'm different than many people here in the sense that short naps seem to help me a little bit, though it's a temporary help, and I feel so uncomfortable and guilty sleeping during my shift rather than on a break. 

I'm wondering if there are any suggestions from other people who have a desk job and have to fight the sleep inertia all day. I know none of it is going to fix the underlying sleepiness, but I welcome any suggestions that would help me to pre-empt the sleep attacks somewhat and feel a little more in control. My sleep inertia seems to kind of come in waves on my work days, and I'm looking for better ways to ride those waves.

I've needed this job for 2 years now to catch up on finances, I haven't lived with her for 4 years and she's been emotionally abusive and controlling all of my life. I've been in therapy for a year and a half now, received my cptsd diagnosis in December and I'm working on being able to leave this company in the next few months. 

But this makes every interaction with her so much more heartbreaking. The parentification, my experiences practically scream at me to be the perfect daughter. That when she's having a hard time at work and she expects me to comfort her- my instincts tell me to bring her lots of gifts, teas, coffees, even considering to bring her valentines day gifts after work today- because I'm afraid that her anger at the situation will turn on me, that if I make a mistake, she will treat me horribly. Act as though I betrayed her and that I never loved my own Mom. 

Being brutally aware of her manipulations moment by moment feels terrible, and even just talking about our relationship feels like a horrible betrayal. But if I don't talk, I will never heal. 

I'm writing this just as a vent. I heard her get mad on the phone with my step dad, it's been a stressful day for everyone at work. She screamed and slammed her phone on the desk, and I just froze and started hyperventilating. I ran to the bathroom and had a panic attack. I'm just desperate to have more separation between her and I.

Anytime my manager schedules me for a shift I‚Äôm just told to go to the register, the drive thru, and make food at the oven. I‚Äôm great at all these (Still a little overwhelmed by everything on the register sometimes) but she‚Äôs never put me on drinks. The other day she pulled me aside and complained I wasn‚Äôt learning as fast as the other new hires (‚ÄúX learned this in a day and it‚Äôs taking you two‚Äù or ‚ÄúHow come she can be independent and you can‚Äôt!‚Äù) but I‚Äôm not being trained like them or even given the same responsibilities. As I said, I noticed how I‚Äôm only being told to go to the oven, the drive thru, or the register but everyone else who trained with me is always assigned to drinks and other tasks I‚Äôve been given no practice with. The employee who was assigned to train me even acknowledges that we‚Äôre barely getting any time to practice drinks.

My manager also complains that I have ‚Äúno sense of urgency‚Äù. She said everyone else will be doing things while I‚Äôm just taking my time and standing around. I take out the trash, change the coffees, take orders, and replace milk if anyone needs it. I ask my coworkers if they need something replaced and get it done, no one complains about this ‚Äúlack of urgency‚Äù and even told me I was doing a great job but according to my manager I‚Äôm too slow. She even tried to tell me ‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt have to tell you to do XYZ, you should be doing it independently‚Äù, except I do. She never has to tell me what to do or where to go, I‚Äôll be in the middle of a task and she‚Äôll just start barking at me to do 8 other things like if I‚Äôm filling ice, she‚Äôll bark at me to brew more coffee, and if I‚Äôm brewing more coffee, she‚Äôll bark at me to get cups, and if I‚Äôm not racing around like a madman she thinks I‚Äôm doing it too slowly. 

I‚Äôve only been here for two weeks and I missed most of the first week of training because I had classes but the girl I trained with also goes to the same classes except even she got trained on everything while the manager just sends me on drive thru for hours then complains about me not being as good as the others.

1ipkcwi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1ipkcwi/aio_fighting_with_my_boyfriend_on_valentines/,AIO fighting with my boyfriend on valentines,"My BF (29M) and I (25F) are currently fighting on today of all days. Am I pushing my partner away? It feels shitty and I want outside perspective. I have to add some context, we have been dating for almost 9 months. When we started dating he had mentioned that he had been arrested for a dui back in 2019. He said he was embarrassed about it but wanted to be completely transparent with me and not hide it.  Flash forward to Super Bowl Sunday, he got arrested for a DUI again and called me at 5 am telling me to get in contact with his lawyer. It was a pretty bad situation, when I picked him up from jail he was an emotional wreck. While I do recognize what he did was completely irresponsible and not okay, I sympathized with him and his situation. While he was in jail I did everything I could to get him out as fast as possible. I went to the PD to drop him off a jacket and ask what were my options, I was on the phone with his lawyer all day, I paid 140$ to make sure his mugshot wouldn‚Äôt be posted on those hometown Facebook pages, I would periodically call PD to see if he has been processed so I can pay his bail to get him out, I even went on subreddits asking what I can do to help him etc. I skipped school this day and the next day because I had to have my phone with me at all times and since I‚Äôm a full time student I would not be able to do that. The next day he gets out, he has no family to pick him up (he has familial problems so I always tell him he‚Äôs my family) so I went at 4 am to get him, got him something to drink because he wasn‚Äôt given water there, consoled him while he was going through it, and then I took him to go see his lawyer since his car had been towed by PD, I went to take him to pick up his car, I took him out to eat at his fave place to just try and make him feel a bit better. I spent the next few days just being there for him bc I could tell he was in a really dark place. I always really do try and go out of my way for him because he is my boyfriend and I love him, that‚Äôs love. Love is patient, kind, selfless. So this is where I feel like I‚Äôm in the wrong. With the arrest happening so recently, I kinda accepted the fact that I might not have a valentines this year bc of what my bf was going through and I was okay with it. It wasn‚Äôt until my bf brought it up a couple days ago that he wanted to do something special for us, but that he works Friday so we would have to celebrate on his day off on Monday and have dinner. I said okay I‚Äôm fine with that, I didn‚Äôt want to bring it up at all but now since the topic of discussion was brought up by him I had mentioned that I wanted flowers and a coffee on valentines just to at least have a little something you know.. I told him he could buy me the smallest coffee and could even pick flowers from a bush. I had also asked him for a necklace from Swarovski that was 330$ before the arrest. (This is definitely where I‚Äôm feeling like I‚Äôm being awful to him) and he had bought it before the incident. He got it delivered last night and let me open it on midnight and it was absolutely beautiful.. I was very happy. I then woke up this morning to get ready for work and as I‚Äôm getting ready I notice he hasn‚Äôt gotten up yet. (He usually sleeps in during the day bc he works at night) so I‚Äôm not gonna lie I started to get a bit irritated when I saw he wasn‚Äôt getting up. So I finish getting ready, I wake him up to move his car bc he was behind me and I gave him a Reese‚Äôs heart box that I got him bc he loves them, he didn‚Äôt really acknowledge it but he was half asleep. He usually kisses me before I leave but didn‚Äôt this time and it kinda stung a bit so I get a bit upset and ask him for money so I can get my coffee myself. He gives me 20$ then gets in his car and moves it and I take off. He then calls me 10 mins later and said his friend saw his mugshot on the Facebook page. I am livid and I email the people to take it down as I had paid 140$ for them to block that post. They take it down and then I get more upset at my bf that he had the energy to call me and tell me that but not for coffee or a kiss goodbye. So this is where I feel like I‚Äôm irrational. I get upset and tell him how I feel and he gets upset as well and we just blow up at each other. Rn we aren‚Äôt speaking to each other because of the fight, so I want someone else‚Äôs perspective. He did get me a beautiful necklace and he was going to take me out to dinner Monday it‚Äôs not like the effort wasn‚Äôt there you know, I don‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôm nitpicking at the littlest things. I think I just feel some type of way about it because we had a blow up fight like this New Year‚Äôs Eve because he knew how much an NYE kiss meant to me as I had never had one before and I wanted him to be my first. He said he would so NYE I went to his job (he‚Äôs a bartender) bc he was working and sat with my friend at her reserved table, I couldn‚Äôt get one bc they were fully booked. When I go up to him to tell him hello he is irritated with me bc I got there at 10:30 even tho that was my friends reservation time, and now he was busy at the bar. I was also recovering from a bad eye infection that day, he knew that he took me to the eye dr only for them to be closed bc of the holiday so he knew there was a possibility I wouldn‚Äôt have even gone. (He also only took me bc I cried to him, I was almost gonna drive myself) So he‚Äôs upset, I get upset too, the clock strikes midnight he doesn‚Äôt leave the bar to kiss me or even embrace me while everyone else is around me. He came five mins after it was all over to the table to say happy new years, I was upset. We had since then talked about it and made up but I bring this up bc I think it played a portion in how I felt today. I just don‚Äôt feel appreciated but also like that‚Äôs so unfair of me to say because he‚Äôs going through a hard time right now and he did buy me a beautiful amazing gift. So what do I do?

1ipkcdz,https://www.reddit.com/r/MbtiTypeMe/comments/1ipkcdz/whats_my_type/,What's my type,"Selective extroversion/introversion - I have days when I just don't feel like being receptive or social, and I think to myself ""yeah I think I'm an introvert"" but I then catch myself starting random interactions with people, because I felt like it. I basically go with whatever I'm feeling like in the moment, and the context. I'm usually pretty chill and feel content with my own vibe.

Physical stimulation gets me going pretty hard, I don't give a shit about sports, but if you tell me there's some physical challenge that needs taking on, you got my attention. I like to get into those things, but I also don't risk my life and health when unnecessary. I'm ready though, and I like to trust my senses. I also like to go to the gym, my primary motivator is knowing my body is strong and capable for some situation, especially when it comes to defending loved ones. I like the visual progress too, but I don't care about fitness.

I've fixed a lot of things myself, like on my previous cars. I'm pretty good at troubleshooting and fixing things in general. If I don't know, I'll look it up and do it that way. Though sometimes, something is so tedious that I'd rather get someone to do it.

I make music but at the same time don't give a shit about arts. I am very invested in the music though, and also appreciate other artists I like. Lana Del Rey is probably my favorite artist, even though I listen to several different styles like electronic. There's something about her lyrics I really like, I can understand the concepts and feelings she's conveying and relate to them. The productions of her tracks are also unique and not cookie cutter bullshit.

I also like to take pictures, drive, be out in nature that looks good. I like getting coffee outside with others, eating out, going to places. In general I like to do things with others that require spending, big or small doesn't matter. Not at all for the sake of spending, it's just how things are set up if you want a nice experience. A picnic does not appeal to me, nor does camping, even if I really like nature.

Tbh I also spend a good amount of time on the PC doing whatever, I used to play a lot of games when I was younger, but these days I don't game much at all.

More psychological aspect:

If I sense someone making stupid assumptions about me, It's one of the easiest ways to piss me off. If someone tries to play it cool with me because of a wrong read, I won't play back. If I sense someone is intimidated from the get-go, I won't do some act to make them comfortable, it pisses me off and it's their problem. If someone tries to put me at ease or something, I also dislike that.

I don't like when people are not comfortable within their own existence in general.

1ipk2zd,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1ipk2zd/i_work_the_night_shift_at_arlingtons_hotel_theres/,I Work the Night Shift at Arlington‚Äôs Hotel... There‚Äôs Something Wrong with the 6th Floor,"Working the night shift at The Arlington had always suited me. The world was quieter after dark, the guests fewer, and the atmosphere in the grand old hotel felt almost peaceful, at least, it used to. I‚Äôve been here two years now, and if you asked me when things began to feel... off, I‚Äôd struggle to pinpoint the exact moment.

The Arlington itself was a relic of another time. Built decades ago, its design was a curious blend of grand old-world charm and modern amenities, a place where marble floors met polished brass railings, and faded chandeliers hung over antique furniture. There was something timeless about the place, like the past and present were always just a little tangled.

I stood behind the front desk, under the soft glow of the overhead lights. It was around 10 PM, and the hotel had settled into its typical night-time lull. A handful of late guests milled about, a businessman hurrying off to catch an elevator, a couple chatting quietly by the fireplace, but nothing out of the ordinary. My job was to keep things running smoothly through the night, a task that had become almost second nature.

I sipped my coffee and stared out at the lobby, my mind wandering. The night shift had a rhythm to it, a kind of predictable monotony that I‚Äôd grown accustomed to. Sure, there were always the usual eccentricities of guests, the drunken arguments, the requests for extra towels at 3 AM, the occasional broken room key, but those things didn‚Äôt bother me that much, but I usually preferred the quiet. It was during these hours that I could let my mind relax.

That night, as I stood at my post, my thoughts drifted back to the odd conversation I‚Äôd had with Sarah earlier. Sarah was the head of housekeeping, a sharp, no-nonsense woman who had been working at the hotel far longer than I had. She had a way of dismissing anything unusual, things that guests would report, strange noises or cold drafts that couldn‚Äôt be explained. Her favorite line was, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an old building, Mark. Of course, it has quirks.‚Äù

But what happened last week had been different.

‚ÄúHave you ever noticed anything... strange about the 6th floor?‚Äù I had asked her casually one night while she was making her rounds. She had paused, her brow furrowing ever so slightly before quickly shaking her head.

‚ÄúNot you too,‚Äù she‚Äôd said with a forced laugh. ‚ÄúMark, that floor‚Äôs been closed for renovations. No one‚Äôs staying there. If you‚Äôre hearing weird things, it‚Äôs probably the pipes.‚Äù

The 6th floor. I hadn‚Äôt mentioned it in a while, but I‚Äôd noticed something odd about it. It wasn‚Äôt just that it was closed off, floors closed for renovations weren‚Äôt exactly unheard of in a place like this. It was the fact that some nights, it wasn‚Äôt just closed, it was gone.

The first time it happened, I barely noticed. I had been going through the usual routine, checking in late arrivals, handing out keycards, and scheduling wake-up calls. When I glanced at the hotel‚Äôs system to check for any remaining guests on the 6th floor, it wasn‚Äôt listed. It was like it had been erased from the elevator panel and stairwell listings altogether. But the next night, it was back. And the night after that, gone again. The floor seemed to slip in and out of existence, without rhyme or reason.

‚ÄúClosed for renovations,‚Äù Sarah had insisted. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it.‚Äù But the renovations weren‚Äôt mentioned anywhere in our official schedule, and no one had spoken to me about moving guests or relocating them.

A sudden knock at the front desk pulled me from my thoughts. I blinked, glancing up to see Ben, the day shift manager, standing in front of me with his usual gruff expression. Ben wasn‚Äôt one for small talk, and though we got along fine, I always felt like he viewed the night shift as something beneath him.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù Ben said, eyeing the cup of coffee in my hand. ‚ÄúEverything running smoothly?‚Äù

‚ÄúSame as always,‚Äù I replied, forcing a smile. ‚ÄúNothing out of the ordinary.‚Äù

Ben grunted in acknowledgment. He leaned on the desk and cast a glance around the quiet lobby, before turning his gaze back to me. ‚ÄúLook, I‚Äôve been hearing some things from the staff about you asking questions, about the 6th floor.‚Äù He said it matter-of-factly, but I could sense a warning in his tone.

I hesitated. ‚ÄúI was just curious. I mean, one night it‚Äôs listed in the system, the next it‚Äôs not. I thought maybe there was a maintenance issue or something.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt overthink it, Mark,‚Äù Ben said, his voice firm. ‚ÄúThe 6th floor is off-limits for a reason. If you‚Äôre getting calls from there or noticing any strange listings, it‚Äôs just a glitch. This hotel‚Äôs old. Sometimes things don‚Äôt work the way they should.‚Äù

I nodded, though I wasn‚Äôt entirely convinced. Ben didn‚Äôt give me a chance to respond before straightening up and walking away. ‚ÄúJust stick to your duties,‚Äù he called over his shoulder as he disappeared through the staff-only door.

I couldn‚Äôt shake the nagging feeling that there was more going on than Ben or Sarah wanted to admit. This wasn‚Äôt just old pipes or outdated systems acting up. Something else was happening here.

It wasn‚Äôt until around 2 AM, when the lobby had emptied out completely, that the unease started to creep in again. I sat at the desk, staring at the computer screen, debating whether I should check the system one more time.

Curiosity got the better of me.

I clicked through the hotel listings, scrolling down to the floor directory.

The 6th floor was gone again.

Not marked as closed. Not offline. Gone. As if it had never existed. I stared at the screen for a long moment.

A shiver ran down my spine. I checked the elevator panel from my desk, and sure enough, the button for the 6th floor was gone too, replaced by a blank spot between 5 and 7. I leaned back in my chair, rubbing the back of my neck.

I stood, grabbed my keycard, and headed toward the elevator.

As I stepped into the elevator, my heart raced with a mixture of curiosity and fear. The soft hum of the elevator always had a comforting regularity to it, but tonight, it felt different. The usual calmness of my routine was replaced by an uneasy anticipation. The 6th floor had vanished before, and tonight, I needed to see if it would return.

The elevator panel blinked softly as I scanned the floor numbers. Sure enough, between the buttons for 5 and 7, there was only an empty space. No button for the 6th floor.

I pushed the button for the 5th floor instead, thinking I could check the stairwell from there. The elevator began its smooth ascent, and I watched the numbers light up, counting the floors one by one. The ride was unnervingly slow, each floor ticked by as if the elevator were hesitating. When the doors finally slid open with a soft chime, I stepped out into the 5th-floor hallway.

The air was cooler here, and the dim lights overhead flickered slightly. I turned toward the stairwell. I pushed open the door to the stairwell.

The stairwell was narrow and shadowy, lit only by emergency lights casting weak pools of yellow onto the steps. I made my way up the stairs, feeling the solid thud of each footstep as I climbed. When I reached the landing between the 5th and 6th floors, I hesitated. There was a sudden drop in temperature, so sharp that I could see my breath in the cold air.

The sign that should have read 6th Floor was blank.

I stared at it, my pulse quickening. It was as if the 6th floor had been erased from existence. I pushed open the stairwell door to the hallway, stepping into what should have been the 6th floor.

The lights in the hallway flickered. I stood still for a moment, letting my eyes adjust to the dim light. The hallway stretched out in front of me, eerily quiet. My footfalls were swallowed by the thick carpet, and I was unnerved by the complete absence of sound. No distant chatter from other guests, no hum of the air conditioning, just silence.

Then, from somewhere down the hall, I heard it.

A soft, almost imperceptible giggle. The sound of children laughing.

I instinctively glanced over my shoulder, but the hallway behind me was empty. I couldn‚Äôt explain the laughter, but the sound sent a cold chill through my body. I knew the floor was supposed to be empty, yet the faint sound of laughter drifted through the air, growing fainter as it moved further down the corridor.

I swallowed hard and took a few steps forward, drawn by the strange, unsettling sound. Room doors were slightly ajar as I passed them, revealing dark interiors that I couldn‚Äôt quite make out. The floor seemed... abandoned. Yet, it also felt occupied, as if the presence of something unseen lurked just out of sight.

I stopped in front of room 616. The door was cracked open, and a faint glow from within the room spilled into the hallway. My pulse quickened. This was the same room I‚Äôd received a call from earlier, despite the hotel system claiming the 6th floor was closed. I pushed the door open slowly, the hinges creaking ominously.

Inside, the room was in disarray. The bed was unmade, the lamps on the bedside tables were knocked over, and the curtains were half-drawn. It looked as though someone had left in a hurry, but there were no signs of struggle, just an eerie stillness. A strange, musty smell hung in the air, and as I stepped further into the room, my eyes landed on the bathroom mirror.

Written in red, smeared across the glass, were the words: ‚ÄúGet out while you can.‚Äù

I froze. The writing looked fresh, the red letters dripping slightly down the surface of the mirror. I reached out, my fingers trembling as I touched the glass. The substance was sticky and real.

A sharp noise behind me made me spin around, my heart pounding in my chest. The door had slammed shut, and the room was plunged into near darkness. Panic set in as I rushed to the door, yanking it open with trembling hands.

I stepped into the hallway, gasping for breath. The oppressive silence returned. I glanced back at room 616. The sense of being watched clung to me like a heavy cloak, and I could feel my skin prickling with the weight of unseen eyes.

I needed to leave.

Back at the front desk, I sat down heavily. I glanced at the security monitor, but nothing seemed out of place. The 6th floor, now missing from the directory, looked completely still on the cameras. I rubbed my temples, trying to process what had just happened. The laughter, the writing on the mirror, the door slamming shut on its own, it didn‚Äôt make sense.

I pulled up the hotel‚Äôs guest records, scrolling through the room assignments. As I feared, room 616 had been marked as unoccupied for days. No one was listed as staying there tonight, or any night, for that matter. The system showed it as closed, just like the rest of the 6th floor.

I leaned back in my chair, staring blankly at the screen. Something was very wrong here, and I was the only one who seemed to notice. Ben and Sarah could dismiss it as glitches or quirks of an old building, but I knew better.

The following nights at The Arlington were a blur of unease and growing paranoia. My mind kept drifting back to the 6th floor, to that room with the writing on the mirror. I tried to convince myself that I had imagined it, that maybe it was some twisted prank left by a guest before the floor was closed. But I couldn‚Äôt shake the sense that something was wrong, something deeper than what Ben or Sarah could explain away.

Every time I glanced at the hotel system during my shift, my eyes would automatically scroll down to the list of floors, half-expecting the 6th floor to appear again. Some nights it did. Others, it was gone, completely erased from the directory, as though it never existed. The inconsistency gnawed at me, and I started to notice something else. Every time the 6th floor returned, strange things happened in the hotel.

Guests began complaining more frequently, though not in the way you‚Äôd expect. It wasn‚Äôt about the usual things like the temperature of the room or the water pressure. No, it was much more unsettling than that.

One night, a middle-aged woman approached the front desk, her eyes wide with fear. I recognized her as someone who had checked in earlier that day, assigned to a room on the 5th floor.

‚ÄúIs everything alright, ma‚Äôam?‚Äù I asked, though the answer was already written on her pale face.

She shook her head, glancing nervously over her shoulder as if expecting someone to appear behind her. ‚ÄúI need to change rooms. There‚Äôs‚Ä¶ something wrong with mine.‚Äù

I raised an eyebrow, trying to maintain a calm demeanor. ‚ÄúCan you tell me what‚Äôs wrong? I‚Äôll send someone to fix it right away.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs not that,‚Äù she said quickly, her voice hushed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the room itself. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ the walls. I hear things, people moving inside the walls. And there was someone standing at the foot of my bed when I woke up. But when I turned on the light, they were gone.‚Äù

A chill ran down my spine, but I kept my expression neutral. ‚ÄúDid you see who it was?‚Äù

Her eyes darted around the lobby, as if she couldn‚Äôt bring herself to look directly at me. ‚ÄúNo. It was just a shadow‚Ä¶ but it felt like someone was there. Watching me.‚Äù

I pulled up the system on the computer, trying to distract myself from the knot of fear building in my stomach. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll move you to a different room,‚Äù I said, my fingers trembling slightly as I clicked through the options. ‚ÄúWould you prefer a room on a different floor?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she said firmly. ‚ÄúAs far from the 6th floor as possible.‚Äù

I froze, my hand hovering over the keyboard. ‚ÄúThe 6th floor?‚Äù I asked cautiously. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre on the 5th floor. Why do you mention the 6th?‚Äù

She blinked, seeming confused. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ it feels like something‚Äôs wrong with that floor. I can hear things coming from above me. It doesn‚Äôt feel right.‚Äù

I nodded. I gave her a new room key for a room on the 3rd floor and watched as she hurried away, glancing over her shoulder one last time before disappearing into the hallway. I stood there for a moment, gripping the edge of the desk. I wasn‚Äôt imagining things. There was something about the 6th floor, something that reached beyond the confines of its walls and affected the other floors. I could feel it in the way the air grew colder when the floor returned, the way the guests seemed unsettled without even knowing why.

The next night, another guest approached the desk. A businessman this time, staying on the 7th floor. His suit was wrinkled, and there were dark circles under his eyes, as though he hadn‚Äôt slept in days.

‚ÄúI need to check out,‚Äù he said bluntly, tossing his room key onto the desk. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something wrong with this place.‚Äù

I stared at him, trying to keep my voice steady. ‚ÄúWhat happened, sir?‚Äù

‚ÄúI lost hours,‚Äù he said, his voice flat, almost mechanical. ‚ÄúI went to bed around midnight. I woke up at 2 AM, a few moments later, when I checked my phone again, it was 8 AM. I don‚Äôt remember anything from those hours. It‚Äôs like they were erased.‚Äù

I frowned, I tried to hide my confusion as I spoke. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry for the inconvenience. I can-‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm leaving,‚Äù he interrupted, his voice tight with barely controlled fear. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to stay another night. There‚Äôs something wrong with this place.‚Äù

That night, after the last guest had left the lobby, I sat behind the front desk, staring at the empty computer screen. The complaints were piling up, people hearing strange noises, losing track of time, feeling watched in their own rooms. And all of them seemed to be tied to the nights when the 6th floor reappeared.

It didn‚Äôt make sense. How could a floor come and go like that?

I needed answers.

The next night, I couldn‚Äôt resist the pull of the 6th floor any longer. After the guests had gone to bed and the hotel was quiet, I found myself once again standing in front of the elevator. The button for the 6th floor had returned, glowing faintly as though inviting me back.

This time, I didn‚Äôt hesitate. I pressed the button, and the elevator doors slid shut, the familiar hum filling the air. As I ascended, my stomach twisted with dread. I didn‚Äôt know what I expected to find, but I couldn‚Äôt ignore the growing sense of urgency building inside me.

The elevator stopped, and the doors opened with a soft chime. The hallway was just as I remembered, dark, cold, and suffocatingly quiet.

I took a deep breath and stepped into the hallway. I walked slowly, passing the darkened rooms, their doors slightly ajar as though they were waiting for someone to enter.

And then I saw it.

Another message, scrawled in red across the mirror in one of the rooms.

""You‚Äôre next.""

Who could have written it? Was it a guest playing some kind of sick prank, or was it something more sinister? The thought gnawed at me, making it hard to think clearly. I felt like I had stumbled onto something that wasn‚Äôt meant for me to see, something dangerous.

I had to get out of there.

I turned and hurried down the hallway, the oppressive silence pressing in on me from all sides.

As I reached the end of the hallway, something caught my eye.

There, just ahead, was a group of hotel staff, three or four of them, standing at the far end of the corridor. For a moment, I felt a wave of relief. Maybe I wasn‚Äôt alone after all.

But as I took a few steps closer, I realized something was terribly wrong.

They were dressed in uniforms that were clearly from another era, bellhops in red jackets with brass buttons, maids in old-fashioned black-and-white attire, and a front desk clerk in a stiff, high-collared suit. They stood perfectly still, their backs to me, as if they were waiting for something.

I opened my mouth to call out, but the words died in my throat.

Their movements were strange, unnatural. The way they shifted their weight from one foot to the other, the slight tilts of their heads, it was stiff and robotic A chill ran down my spine.

Something wasn‚Äôt right. These weren‚Äôt regular staff members.

I watched in growing horror as one by one, they began to turn around, their movements jerky and mechanical. I took a step back. When they finally faced me, my blood ran cold.

Their faces were blank.

No eyes. No mouths. Just smooth, featureless skin where their faces should have been. They stood there, expressionless, if you could even call it that, staring at me with those empty, non-existent faces. The air around me grew colder, and the oppressive weight of the floor seemed to press down on my chest, making it hard to breathe.

I stumbled backward, my mind racing. I needed to get away from them, but my feet felt heavy, like I was wading through thick, invisible mud. The staff didn‚Äôt move, but I could feel their presence pulling at me, drawing me in like the 6th floor had been doing for days.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I croaked, my voice shaking.

No response. The blank-faced staff stood perfectly still, their heads slightly tilted, as if waiting for something. Then, without warning, they turned in unison and began to walk toward one of the rooms, room 616. The door swung open as they approached, and they filed inside, disappearing into the darkness.

Something inside me, a morbid curiosity or maybe a deep-seated fear, compelled me to follow them.

I stepped toward room 616, my legs trembling. When I reached the doorway, I hesitated. The room beyond was dark. I could hear a faint whispering sound coming from within, but I couldn‚Äôt make out the words.

Slowly, I pushed the door open.

Inside, the room was empty.

No staff. No furniture. Just an empty, silent room.

But there, lying on the bed, was a single note.

My hands shook as I picked it up. The paper was old, yellowed with age, and the handwriting was smudged and uneven. I held it up to the dim light coming through the window and read the words:

""We‚Äôre still working.""

I backed out of the room, I had seen enough. I didn‚Äôt care what Sarah or Ben said anymore. Something was horribly wrong with this hotel, and it centered around the 6th floor. The staff I had seen weren‚Äôt real, or at least, not anymore. They were like echoes of the past.

I needed to leave.

I bolted for the elevator, my footsteps echoing through the empty hallway. But when I reached the doors and pressed the button, nothing happened. The elevator stayed on another floor, unmoving. The button for the 6th floor was no longer illuminated.

A sense of panic began to rise in my chest as I turned toward the stairwell. I pushed open the door, expecting to find my way down to the lobby, but what I saw stopped me in my tracks.

The stairwell was gone.

In its place was another hallway, just like the one I had just come from. The same flickering lights, the same thick carpet, the same oppressive silence. My pulse quickened, and I backed away, turning to look behind me. But the hallway I had just come from had changed too. It stretched endlessly in both directions, as if I had been transported to some other part of the hotel that shouldn‚Äôt exist.

I was trapped.

I tried to stay calm, tried to reason with myself. This was just a trick of the mind, a hallucination brought on by stress and fatigue.

I started walking, hoping that if I kept moving, I would find a way out. But no matter how far I walked, the hallway stretched on endlessly. The exit signs at the far end of the corridor flickered in and out of sight, always just out of reach. It was as if the building itself was toying with me, keeping me trapped in this nightmarish loop.

Finally, after what felt like hours of walking, I saw it, a door marked STAFF ONLY.

I didn‚Äôt hesitate. I rushed toward it, and twisted the handle.

The door swung open, and I stumbled through it, expecting to find myself back in the stairwell or the lobby.

But instead, I found myself standing in front of the front desk.

I blinked, disoriented.

Had I imagined it all? The phantom staff, the endless hallways, the message on the mirror. It all seemed so distant now, like a half-remembered dream.

But as I glanced at the security monitors, I saw something.

The cameras for the 6th floor flickered briefly, and for a split second, I saw them, the staff, standing perfectly still in the hallway, their blank faces turned toward the camera, as if they were watching me.

I backed away from the monitor, my hands trembling.

This wasn‚Äôt over.

I couldn‚Äôt sleep after that night. Even when my shift was over, I couldn‚Äôt shake the images from my mind: the blank faces of the phantom staff, the endless hallway, the ominous message scrawled on the mirror. I found myself avoiding the mirrors in my own apartment, too. Whenever I glanced at one, I would catch a flicker of something, shadows that shouldn‚Äôt be there, movements that didn‚Äôt belong to me. It was as if the 6th floor was creeping into my life, even when I wasn‚Äôt at the hotel.

The nightmares didn‚Äôt help either. Every night, I dreamt of being trapped in the hotel, lost in that labyrinthine hallway that never seemed to end. In my dreams, I was always running from something I couldn‚Äôt see but could feel lurking just behind me, waiting for me to slow down, waiting to catch me. Each time, I would wake up in a cold sweat, the sense of dread lingering long after the dream faded.

A few nights later, I was back at the front desk. The hotel was quiet as usual, the guests long since retired to their rooms. I had been watching the security monitors closely, especially the ones for the 6th floor. Tonight, the floor was listed in the system again, but the cameras showed nothing out of the ordinary, just an empty hallway, the lights flickering occasionally.

Around 2 AM, the phone rang.

I stared at it for a moment, my stomach twisting with dread. Every time the phone rang now, I couldn‚Äôt help but feel a sense of foreboding, as if each call was pulling me deeper into whatever dark force was haunting the 6th floor.

I picked up the receiver, trying to keep my voice steady. ‚ÄúFront desk, this is Mark.‚Äù

There was a pause, followed by a low, crackling static. Then, through the static, I heard a voice, distorted, faint, but unmistakably human.

‚Äú...Room 621...‚Äù

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I said into the phone, my voice betraying the growing unease in my chest. ‚ÄúCan you repeat that?‚Äù

There was no response. Just static.

I hung up the phone, my mind racing. Was someone playing a sick joke on me? I knew I couldn‚Äôt just ignore it. I grabbed my keycard and headed toward the elevator, my hands trembling slightly as I pressed the button for the 6th floor.

When the doors slid open, I stepped out into the now-familiar hallway.

I walked down the hall, counting the numbers on the doors as I went. 619, 620, 621. I stopped in front of the door.

I swiped my keycard, the lock clicking softly as the door swung open.

The room was dark. I reached for the light switch, but nothing happened. The bulb must have burned out. I stepped inside, the door closing softly behind me. The room felt colder than the rest of the hotel.

As I moved further into the room, I noticed something strange. There were no mirrors. Not on the walls, not in the bathroom, nothing. Every reflective surface had been removed.

A sense of dread washed over me as I realized how unusual that was. I had worked at this hotel for two years, and every room had a standard set of mirrors: one above the sink in the bathroom, a full-length mirror by the closet, and sometimes even smaller ones on the dresser. But here, there was nothing.

I swallowed hard, backing toward the door, my eyes scanning the room for any sign of movement. That‚Äôs when I saw it, reflected in the glossy black surface of the television screen.

A shadow.

It stood behind me, tall and dark, its form barely distinguishable from the surrounding gloom. My heart pounded in my chest as I stared at the screen, unable to tear my gaze away. The figure didn‚Äôt move, didn‚Äôt make a sound, but I could feel its presence. It was watching me.

I spun around, but the room was empty. Nothing.

I backed toward the door, my hands shaking as I fumbled for the handle. I needed to get out of there.

I yanked on the handle, but it was as if the door had vanished into the wall. There was no escape. I was trapped.

Panic set in as I turned toward the window, hoping to find some other way out, but the windows were sealed shut. I couldn‚Äôt even see the city lights beyond, just an endless expanse of darkness pressing against the glass.

I tried my phone, but the screen was black, unresponsive. My radio, too, emitted nothing but static. I was completely cut off.

The air in the room grew colder, and I could feel the presence of something unseen watching me. It was as if the walls themselves were alive, closing in on me, suffocating me. I stumbled back to the center of the room, my mind racing with fear and confusion.

Then, without warning, I heard it, a soft knock, coming from inside the room.

The knock came again, as if someone was trying to get my attention.

I turned slowly, my eyes scanning the room, but there was no one there. Just shadows.

The knock came again, but this time it was right behind me.

I spun around, my heart pounding in my chest, but once again, the room was empty. The walls seemed to pulse with a life of their own, the shadows shifting and writhing in the dim light.

And then, the room fell silent, the oppressive weight of the air pressing down on me like a vice.

I didn‚Äôt know how long I stood there, frozen in place. But then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw the door.

It had reappeared.

I didn‚Äôt waste any time. I rushed toward it, yanking it open. I stumbled out into the hallway, gasping for breath, my heart still racing from the terror of what I had just experienced.

Something was wrong with this place, and I had a sinking feeling that I was getting closer to the truth. A truth I wasn‚Äôt sure I wanted to uncover.

I hurried down the hallway, refusing to glance over my shoulder, convinced that the shadows were moving, twisting, watching me.

When I reached the elevator, I pressed the button frantically. The lights above flickered, and for a moment, I thought it wouldn‚Äôt come. The soft hum of the machinery finally filled the silence, and the doors opened with a smooth chime. I stepped inside, my heart racing, and pressed the button for the lobby.

Back at the front desk, I sat down heavily, my hands shaking. My mind was racing, replaying everything that had happened over the past few weeks.

It didn‚Äôt feel real. But I knew it was.

I needed answers.

I logged into the hotel‚Äôs old archive system, an outdated collection of files, reports, and blueprints that no one had bothered with in years. The information I was looking for had to be buried here somewhere.

It took me nearly an hour of scrolling through irrelevant documents before I found something: an old incident report from the early 1970s, simply titled ‚ÄúClosure of the 6th Floor.‚Äù I opened the file. The report was brief, the details vague, but it told me enough.

According to the document, the 6th floor had been permanently closed after a series of unexplained deaths. Guests who checked in on that floor were found dead under mysterious circumstances, heart attacks, or cases where there was no apparent cause of death at all. One chilling account described a guest who was found standing in the middle of their room, eyes wide open, completely frozen. The floor was supposed to have been sealed off decades ago, but something had gone horribly wrong.

The hotel management at the time had quietly shut it down, hiding the deaths from the public. But the 6th floor hadn‚Äôt stayed closed. Every few decades, it reappeared, drawing in new guests.

My heart pounded at the realisation that this was happening again, and it was happening for weeks now.

The phone buzzed, jolting me out of my thoughts. It was Sarah, the head of housekeeping.

‚ÄúMark, where are you?‚Äù she asked, her voice sounding distant, almost distorted. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm on the 5th floor. I thought I saw someone wandering around, but when I got there, the floor was empty.‚Äù

I hesitated, unsure if I should tell her about everything I had discovered. But she had always brushed off my concerns, always telling me that it was just an old building acting up. Would she even believe me?

‚ÄúI... I‚Äôm at the desk. Stay away from the 6th floor, Sarah. There‚Äôs something wrong with it. I‚Äôve been getting calls, and‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs more to it than you think.‚Äù

There was silence on the other end, but I could hear her breathing, quick and shallow.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been hearing things too,‚Äù she said after a long pause. ‚ÄúVoices, footsteps. I thought it was just in my head, but... you‚Äôre telling me it‚Äôs real?‚Äù

‚ÄúMore real than I want to admit,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúYou need to get out of here, Sarah. Whatever‚Äôs happening on that floor, it‚Äôs not safe.‚Äù

Sarah didn‚Äôt respond. There was a soft click, and the line went dead.

The rest of my shift passed in a blur of anxious pacing and stolen glances at the security monitors. Every time the camera feed flickered, I felt my stomach lurch, half-expecting to see those blank-faced staff members again, waiting for me.

It wasn‚Äôt until just before dawn, as I was preparing to hand over the shift to the day staff, that something strange happened. The elevator doors opened with a soft chime, and I watched as a group of guests stepped out, chatting softly amongst themselves.

They were all wearing clothes from another era. Suits from the 1970s, dresses with high collars and lace. And their faces, pale, expressionless. Their eyes didn‚Äôt meet mine as they crossed the lobby and exited the hotel, disappearing into the early morning light.

I stood frozen behind the desk, my mind struggling to process what I had just seen. It was as if the hotel‚Äôs past was bleeding into the present, the ghosts of those trapped on the 6th floor spilling out into the world beyond.

I couldn‚Äôt stay at The Arlington after that. I handed in my resignation that morning, packed up my things, and left the hotel. But even now, weeks later, the memories of the 6th floor still haunt me.

I still see the figures in my dreams, blank-faced staff members, shadowy figures standing at the foot of my bed. I still hear the soft, distant knock coming from inside the walls. And every now and then, when I glance into a mirror, I see something else looking back at me, something that doesn‚Äôt belong.

I try to tell myself it‚Äôs all in my head, but I know the truth.

There‚Äôs Something Wrong with the 6th Floor,"Working the night shift at The Arlington had always suited me. The world was quieter after dark, the guests fewer, and the atmosphere in the grand old hotel felt almost peaceful, at least, it used to. I‚Äôve been here two years now, and if you asked me when things began to feel... off, I‚Äôd struggle to pinpoint the exact moment.

The Arlington itself was a relic of another time. Built decades ago, its design was a curious blend of grand old-world charm and modern amenities, a place where marble floors met polished brass railings, and faded chandeliers hung over antique furniture. There was something timeless about the place, like the past and present were always just a little tangled.

I stood behind the front desk, under the soft glow of the overhead lights. It was around 10 PM, and the hotel had settled into its typical night-time lull. A handful of late guests milled about, a businessman hurrying off to catch an elevator, a couple chatting quietly by the fireplace, but nothing out of the ordinary. My job was to keep things running smoothly through the night, a task that had become almost second nature.

I sipped my coffee and stared out at the lobby, my mind wandering. The night shift had a rhythm to it, a kind of predictable monotony that I‚Äôd grown accustomed to. Sure, there were always the usual eccentricities of guests, the drunken arguments, the requests for extra towels at 3 AM, the occasional broken room key, but those things didn‚Äôt bother me that much, but I usually preferred the quiet. It was during these hours that I could let my mind relax.

That night, as I stood at my post, my thoughts drifted back to the odd conversation I‚Äôd had with Sarah earlier. Sarah was the head of housekeeping, a sharp, no-nonsense woman who had been working at the hotel far longer than I had. She had a way of dismissing anything unusual, things that guests would report, strange noises or cold drafts that couldn‚Äôt be explained. Her favorite line was, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an old building, Mark. Of course, it has quirks.‚Äù

But what happened last week had been different.

‚ÄúHave you ever noticed anything... strange about the 6th floor?‚Äù I had asked her casually one night while she was making her rounds. She had paused, her brow furrowing ever so slightly before quickly shaking her head.

‚ÄúNot you too,‚Äù she‚Äôd said with a forced laugh. ‚ÄúMark, that floor‚Äôs been closed for renovations. No one‚Äôs staying there. If you‚Äôre hearing weird things, it‚Äôs probably the pipes.‚Äù

The 6th floor. I hadn‚Äôt mentioned it in a while, but I‚Äôd noticed something odd about it. It wasn‚Äôt just that it was closed off, floors closed for renovations weren‚Äôt exactly unheard of in a place like this. It was the fact that some nights, it wasn‚Äôt just closed, it was gone.

The first time it happened, I barely noticed. I had been going through the usual routine, checking in late arrivals, handing out keycards, and scheduling wake-up calls. When I glanced at the hotel‚Äôs system to check for any remaining guests on the 6th floor, it wasn‚Äôt listed. It was like it had been erased from the elevator panel and stairwell listings altogether. But the next night, it was back. And the night after that, gone again. The floor seemed to slip in and out of existence, without rhyme or reason.

‚ÄúClosed for renovations,‚Äù Sarah had insisted. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it.‚Äù But the renovations weren‚Äôt mentioned anywhere in our official schedule, and no one had spoken to me about moving guests or relocating them.

A sudden knock at the front desk pulled me from my thoughts. I blinked, glancing up to see Ben, the day shift manager, standing in front of me with his usual gruff expression. Ben wasn‚Äôt one for small talk, and though we got along fine, I always felt like he viewed the night shift as something beneath him.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù Ben said, eyeing the cup of coffee in my hand. ‚ÄúEverything running smoothly?‚Äù

‚ÄúSame as always,‚Äù I replied, forcing a smile. ‚ÄúNothing out of the ordinary.‚Äù

Ben grunted in acknowledgment. He leaned on the desk and cast a glance around the quiet lobby, before turning his gaze back to me. ‚ÄúLook, I‚Äôve been hearing some things from the staff about you asking questions, about the 6th floor.‚Äù He said it matter-of-factly, but I could sense a warning in his tone.

I hesitated. ‚ÄúI was just curious. I mean, one night it‚Äôs listed in the system, the next it‚Äôs not. I thought maybe there was a maintenance issue or something.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt overthink it, Mark,‚Äù Ben said, his voice firm. ‚ÄúThe 6th floor is off-limits for a reason. If you‚Äôre getting calls from there or noticing any strange listings, it‚Äôs just a glitch. This hotel‚Äôs old. Sometimes things don‚Äôt work the way they should.‚Äù

I nodded, though I wasn‚Äôt entirely convinced. Ben didn‚Äôt give me a chance to respond before straightening up and walking away. ‚ÄúJust stick to your duties,‚Äù he called over his shoulder as he disappeared through the staff-only door.

I couldn‚Äôt shake the nagging feeling that there was more going on than Ben or Sarah wanted to admit. This wasn‚Äôt just old pipes or outdated systems acting up. Something else was happening here.

It wasn‚Äôt until around 2 AM, when the lobby had emptied out completely, that the unease started to creep in again. I sat at the desk, staring at the computer screen, debating whether I should check the system one more time.

Curiosity got the better of me.

I clicked through the hotel listings, scrolling down to the floor directory.

The 6th floor was gone again.

Not marked as closed. Not offline. Gone. As if it had never existed. I stared at the screen for a long moment.

A shiver ran down my spine. I checked the elevator panel from my desk, and sure enough, the button for the 6th floor was gone too, replaced by a blank spot between 5 and 7. I leaned back in my chair, rubbing the back of my neck.

I stood, grabbed my keycard, and headed toward the elevator.

As I stepped into the elevator, my heart raced with a mixture of curiosity and fear. The soft hum of the elevator always had a comforting regularity to it, but tonight, it felt different. The usual calmness of my routine was replaced by an uneasy anticipation. The 6th floor had vanished before, and tonight, I needed to see if it would return.

The elevator panel blinked softly as I scanned the floor numbers. Sure enough, between the buttons for 5 and 7, there was only an empty space. No button for the 6th floor.

I pushed the button for the 5th floor instead, thinking I could check the stairwell from there. The elevator began its smooth ascent, and I watched the numbers light up, counting the floors one by one. The ride was unnervingly slow, each floor ticked by as if the elevator were hesitating. When the doors finally slid open with a soft chime, I stepped out into the 5th-floor hallway.

The air was cooler here, and the dim lights overhead flickered slightly. I turned toward the stairwell. I pushed open the door to the stairwell.

The stairwell was narrow and shadowy, lit only by emergency lights casting weak pools of yellow onto the steps. I made my way up the stairs, feeling the solid thud of each footstep as I climbed. When I reached the landing between the 5th and 6th floors, I hesitated. There was a sudden drop in temperature, so sharp that I could see my breath in the cold air.

The sign that should have read 6th Floor was blank.

I stared at it, my pulse quickening. It was as if the 6th floor had been erased from existence. I pushed open the stairwell door to the hallway, stepping into what should have been the 6th floor.

The lights in the hallway flickered. I stood still for a moment, letting my eyes adjust to the dim light. The hallway stretched out in front of me, eerily quiet. My footfalls were swallowed by the thick carpet, and I was unnerved by the complete absence of sound. No distant chatter from other guests, no hum of the air conditioning, just silence.

Then, from somewhere down the hall, I heard it.

A soft, almost imperceptible giggle. The sound of children laughing.

I instinctively glanced over my shoulder, but the hallway behind me was empty. I couldn‚Äôt explain the laughter, but the sound sent a cold chill through my body. I knew the floor was supposed to be empty, yet the faint sound of laughter drifted through the air, growing fainter as it moved further down the corridor.

I swallowed hard and took a few steps forward, drawn by the strange, unsettling sound. Room doors were slightly ajar as I passed them, revealing dark interiors that I couldn‚Äôt quite make out. The floor seemed... abandoned. Yet, it also felt occupied, as if the presence of something unseen lurked just out of sight.

I stopped in front of room 616. The door was cracked open, and a faint glow from within the room spilled into the hallway. My pulse quickened. This was the same room I‚Äôd received a call from earlier, despite the hotel system claiming the 6th floor was closed. I pushed the door open slowly, the hinges creaking ominously.

Inside, the room was in disarray. The bed was unmade, the lamps on the bedside tables were knocked over, and the curtains were half-drawn. It looked as though someone had left in a hurry, but there were no signs of struggle, just an eerie stillness. A strange, musty smell hung in the air, and as I stepped further into the room, my eyes landed on the bathroom mirror.

Written in red, smeared across the glass, were the words: ‚ÄúGet out while you can.‚Äù

I froze. The writing looked fresh, the red letters dripping slightly down the surface of the mirror. I reached out, my fingers trembling as I touched the glass. The substance was sticky and real.

A sharp noise behind me made me spin around, my heart pounding in my chest. The door had slammed shut, and the room was plunged into near darkness. Panic set in as I rushed to the door, yanking it open with trembling hands.

I stepped into the hallway, gasping for breath. The oppressive silence returned. I glanced back at room 616. The sense of being watched clung to me like a heavy cloak, and I could feel my skin prickling with the weight of unseen eyes.

I needed to leave.

Back at the front desk, I sat down heavily. I glanced at the security monitor, but nothing seemed out of place. The 6th floor, now missing from the directory, looked completely still on the cameras. I rubbed my temples, trying to process what had just happened. The laughter, the writing on the mirror, the door slamming shut on its own, it didn‚Äôt make sense.

I pulled up the hotel‚Äôs guest records, scrolling through the room assignments. As I feared, room 616 had been marked as unoccupied for days. No one was listed as staying there tonight, or any night, for that matter. The system showed it as closed, just like the rest of the 6th floor.

I leaned back in my chair, staring blankly at the screen. Something was very wrong here, and I was the only one who seemed to notice. Ben and Sarah could dismiss it as glitches or quirks of an old building, but I knew better.

The following nights at The Arlington were a blur of unease and growing paranoia. My mind kept drifting back to the 6th floor, to that room with the writing on the mirror. I tried to convince myself that I had imagined it, that maybe it was some twisted prank left by a guest before the floor was closed. But I couldn‚Äôt shake the sense that something was wrong, something deeper than what Ben or Sarah could explain away.

Every time I glanced at the hotel system during my shift, my eyes would automatically scroll down to the list of floors, half-expecting the 6th floor to appear again. Some nights it did. Others, it was gone, completely erased from the directory, as though it never existed. The inconsistency gnawed at me, and I started to notice something else. Every time the 6th floor returned, strange things happened in the hotel.

Guests began complaining more frequently, though not in the way you‚Äôd expect. It wasn‚Äôt about the usual things like the temperature of the room or the water pressure. No, it was much more unsettling than that.

One night, a middle-aged woman approached the front desk, her eyes wide with fear. I recognized her as someone who had checked in earlier that day, assigned to a room on the 5th floor.

‚ÄúIs everything alright, ma‚Äôam?‚Äù I asked, though the answer was already written on her pale face.

She shook her head, glancing nervously over her shoulder as if expecting someone to appear behind her. ‚ÄúI need to change rooms. There‚Äôs‚Ä¶ something wrong with mine.‚Äù

I raised an eyebrow, trying to maintain a calm demeanor. ‚ÄúCan you tell me what‚Äôs wrong? I‚Äôll send someone to fix it right away.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs not that,‚Äù she said quickly, her voice hushed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the room itself. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ the walls. I hear things, people moving inside the walls. And there was someone standing at the foot of my bed when I woke up. But when I turned on the light, they were gone.‚Äù

A chill ran down my spine, but I kept my expression neutral. ‚ÄúDid you see who it was?‚Äù

Her eyes darted around the lobby, as if she couldn‚Äôt bring herself to look directly at me. ‚ÄúNo. It was just a shadow‚Ä¶ but it felt like someone was there. Watching me.‚Äù

I pulled up the system on the computer, trying to distract myself from the knot of fear building in my stomach. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll move you to a different room,‚Äù I said, my fingers trembling slightly as I clicked through the options. ‚ÄúWould you prefer a room on a different floor?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she said firmly. ‚ÄúAs far from the 6th floor as possible.‚Äù

I froze, my hand hovering over the keyboard. ‚ÄúThe 6th floor?‚Äù I asked cautiously. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre on the 5th floor. Why do you mention the 6th?‚Äù

She blinked, seeming confused. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ it feels like something‚Äôs wrong with that floor. I can hear things coming from above me. It doesn‚Äôt feel right.‚Äù

I nodded. I gave her a new room key for a room on the 3rd floor and watched as she hurried away, glancing over her shoulder one last time before disappearing into the hallway. I stood there for a moment, gripping the edge of the desk. I wasn‚Äôt imagining things. There was something about the 6th floor, something that reached beyond the confines of its walls and affected the other floors. I could feel it in the way the air grew colder when the floor returned, the way the guests seemed unsettled without even knowing why.

The next night, another guest approached the desk. A businessman this time, staying on the 7th floor. His suit was wrinkled, and there were dark circles under his eyes, as though he hadn‚Äôt slept in days.

‚ÄúI need to check out,‚Äù he said bluntly, tossing his room key onto the desk. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something wrong with this place.‚Äù

I stared at him, trying to keep my voice steady. ‚ÄúWhat happened, sir?‚Äù

‚ÄúI lost hours,‚Äù he said, his voice flat, almost mechanical. ‚ÄúI went to bed around midnight. I woke up at 2 AM, a few moments later, when I checked my phone again, it was 8 AM. I don‚Äôt remember anything from those hours. It‚Äôs like they were erased.‚Äù

I frowned, I tried to hide my confusion as I spoke. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry for the inconvenience. I can-‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm leaving,‚Äù he interrupted, his voice tight with barely controlled fear. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to stay another night. There‚Äôs something wrong with this place.‚Äù

That night, after the last guest had left the lobby, I sat behind the front desk, staring at the empty computer screen. The complaints were piling up, people hearing strange noises, losing track of time, feeling watched in their own rooms. And all of them seemed to be tied to the nights when the 6th floor reappeared.

It didn‚Äôt make sense. How could a floor come and go like that?

I needed answers.

The next night, I couldn‚Äôt resist the pull of the 6th floor any longer. After the guests had gone to bed and the hotel was quiet, I found myself once again standing in front of the elevator. The button for the 6th floor had returned, glowing faintly as though inviting me back.

This time, I didn‚Äôt hesitate. I pressed the button, and the elevator doors slid shut, the familiar hum filling the air. As I ascended, my stomach twisted with dread. I didn‚Äôt know what I expected to find, but I couldn‚Äôt ignore the growing sense of urgency building inside me.

The elevator stopped, and the doors opened with a soft chime. The hallway was just as I remembered, dark, cold, and suffocatingly quiet.

I took a deep breath and stepped into the hallway. I walked slowly, passing the darkened rooms, their doors slightly ajar as though they were waiting for someone to enter.

And then I saw it.

Another message, scrawled in red across the mirror in one of the rooms.

""You‚Äôre next.""

Who could have written it? Was it a guest playing some kind of sick prank, or was it something more sinister? The thought gnawed at me, making it hard to think clearly. I felt like I had stumbled onto something that wasn‚Äôt meant for me to see, something dangerous.

I had to get out of there.

I turned and hurried down the hallway, the oppressive silence pressing in on me from all sides.

As I reached the end of the hallway, something caught my eye.

There, just ahead, was a group of hotel staff, three or four of them, standing at the far end of the corridor. For a moment, I felt a wave of relief. Maybe I wasn‚Äôt alone after all.

But as I took a few steps closer, I realized something was terribly wrong.

They were dressed in uniforms that were clearly from another era, bellhops in red jackets with brass buttons, maids in old-fashioned black-and-white attire, and a front desk clerk in a stiff, high-collared suit. They stood perfectly still, their backs to me, as if they were waiting for something.

I opened my mouth to call out, but the words died in my throat.

Their movements were strange, unnatural. The way they shifted their weight from one foot to the other, the slight tilts of their heads, it was stiff and robotic A chill ran down my spine.

Something wasn‚Äôt right. These weren‚Äôt regular staff members.

I watched in growing horror as one by one, they began to turn around, their movements jerky and mechanical. I took a step back. When they finally faced me, my blood ran cold.

Their faces were blank.

No eyes. No mouths. Just smooth, featureless skin where their faces should have been. They stood there, expressionless, if you could even call it that, staring at me with those empty, non-existent faces. The air around me grew colder, and the oppressive weight of the floor seemed to press down on my chest, making it hard to breathe.

I stumbled backward, my mind racing. I needed to get away from them, but my feet felt heavy, like I was wading through thick, invisible mud. The staff didn‚Äôt move, but I could feel their presence pulling at me, drawing me in like the 6th floor had been doing for days.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I croaked, my voice shaking.

No response. The blank-faced staff stood perfectly still, their heads slightly tilted, as if waiting for something. Then, without warning, they turned in unison and began to walk toward one of the rooms, room 616. The door swung open as they approached, and they filed inside, disappearing into the darkness.

Something inside me, a morbid curiosity or maybe a deep-seated fear, compelled me to follow them.

I stepped toward room 616, my legs trembling. When I reached the doorway, I hesitated. The room beyond was dark. I could hear a faint whispering sound coming from within, but I couldn‚Äôt make out the words.

Slowly, I pushed the door open.

Inside, the room was empty.

No staff. No furniture. Just an empty, silent room.

But there, lying on the bed, was a single note.

My hands shook as I picked it up. The paper was old, yellowed with age, and the handwriting was smudged and uneven. I held it up to the dim light coming through the window and read the words:

""We‚Äôre still working.""

I backed out of the room, I had seen enough. I didn‚Äôt care what Sarah or Ben said anymore. Something was horribly wrong with this hotel, and it centered around the 6th floor. The staff I had seen weren‚Äôt real, or at least, not anymore. They were like echoes of the past.

I needed to leave.

I bolted for the elevator, my footsteps echoing through the empty hallway. But when I reached the doors and pressed the button, nothing happened. The elevator stayed on another floor, unmoving. The button for the 6th floor was no longer illuminated.

A sense of panic began to rise in my chest as I turned toward the stairwell. I pushed open the door, expecting to find my way down to the lobby, but what I saw stopped me in my tracks.

The stairwell was gone.

In its place was another hallway, just like the one I had just come from. The same flickering lights, the same thick carpet, the same oppressive silence. My pulse quickened, and I backed away, turning to look behind me. But the hallway I had just come from had changed too. It stretched endlessly in both directions, as if I had been transported to some other part of the hotel that shouldn‚Äôt exist.

I was trapped.

I tried to stay calm, tried to reason with myself. This was just a trick of the mind, a hallucination brought on by stress and fatigue.

I started walking, hoping that if I kept moving, I would find a way out. But no matter how far I walked, the hallway stretched on endlessly. The exit signs at the far end of the corridor flickered in and out of sight, always just out of reach. It was as if the building itself was toying with me, keeping me trapped in this nightmarish loop.

Finally, after what felt like hours of walking, I saw it, a door marked STAFF ONLY.

I didn‚Äôt hesitate. I rushed toward it, and twisted the handle.

The door swung open, and I stumbled through it, expecting to find myself back in the stairwell or the lobby.

But instead, I found myself standing in front of the front desk.

I blinked, disoriented.

Had I imagined it all? The phantom staff, the endless hallways, the message on the mirror. It all seemed so distant now, like a half-remembered dream.

But as I glanced at the security monitors, I saw something.

The cameras for the 6th floor flickered briefly, and for a split second, I saw them, the staff, standing perfectly still in the hallway, their blank faces turned toward the camera, as if they were watching me.

I backed away from the monitor, my hands trembling.

This wasn‚Äôt over.

I couldn‚Äôt sleep after that night. Even when my shift was over, I couldn‚Äôt shake the images from my mind: the blank faces of the phantom staff, the endless hallway, the ominous message scrawled on the mirror. I found myself avoiding the mirrors in my own apartment, too. Whenever I glanced at one, I would catch a flicker of something, shadows that shouldn‚Äôt be there, movements that didn‚Äôt belong to me. It was as if the 6th floor was creeping into my life, even when I wasn‚Äôt at the hotel.

The nightmares didn‚Äôt help either. Every night, I dreamt of being trapped in the hotel, lost in that labyrinthine hallway that never seemed to end. In my dreams, I was always running from something I couldn‚Äôt see but could feel lurking just behind me, waiting for me to slow down, waiting to catch me. Each time, I would wake up in a cold sweat, the sense of dread lingering long after the dream faded.

A few nights later, I was back at the front desk. The hotel was quiet as usual, the guests long since retired to their rooms. I had been watching the security monitors closely, especially the ones for the 6th floor. Tonight, the floor was listed in the system again, but the cameras showed nothing out of the ordinary, just an empty hallway, the lights flickering occasionally.

Around 2 AM, the phone rang.

I stared at it for a moment, my stomach twisting with dread. Every time the phone rang now, I couldn‚Äôt help but feel a sense of foreboding, as if each call was pulling me deeper into whatever dark force was haunting the 6th floor.

I picked up the receiver, trying to keep my voice steady. ‚ÄúFront desk, this is Mark.‚Äù

There was a pause, followed by a low, crackling static. Then, through the static, I heard a voice, distorted, faint, but unmistakably human.

‚Äú...Room 621...‚Äù

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I said into the phone, my voice betraying the growing unease in my chest. ‚ÄúCan you repeat that?‚Äù

There was no response. Just static.

I hung up the phone, my mind racing. Was someone playing a sick joke on me? I knew I couldn‚Äôt just ignore it. I grabbed my keycard and headed toward the elevator, my hands trembling slightly as I pressed the button for the 6th floor.

When the doors slid open, I stepped out into the now-familiar hallway.

I walked down the hall, counting the numbers on the doors as I went. 619, 620, 621. I stopped in front of the door.

I swiped my keycard, the lock clicking softly as the door swung open.

The room was dark. I reached for the light switch, but nothing happened. The bulb must have burned out. I stepped inside, the door closing softly behind me. The room felt colder than the rest of the hotel.

As I moved further into the room, I noticed something strange. There were no mirrors. Not on the walls, not in the bathroom, nothing. Every reflective surface had been removed.

A sense of dread washed over me as I realized how unusual that was. I had worked at this hotel for two years, and every room had a standard set of mirrors: one above the sink in the bathroom, a full-length mirror by the closet, and sometimes even smaller ones on the dresser. But here, there was nothing.

I swallowed hard, backing toward the door, my eyes scanning the room for any sign of movement. That‚Äôs when I saw it, reflected in the glossy black surface of the television screen.

A shadow.

It stood behind me, tall and dark, its form barely distinguishable from the surrounding gloom. My heart pounded in my chest as I stared at the screen, unable to tear my gaze away. The figure didn‚Äôt move, didn‚Äôt make a sound, but I could feel its presence. It was watching me.

I spun around, but the room was empty. Nothing.

I backed toward the door, my hands shaking as I fumbled for the handle. I needed to get out of there.

I yanked on the handle, but it was as if the door had vanished into the wall. There was no escape. I was trapped.

Panic set in as I turned toward the window, hoping to find some other way out, but the windows were sealed shut. I couldn‚Äôt even see the city lights beyond, just an endless expanse of darkness pressing against the glass.

I tried my phone, but the screen was black, unresponsive. My radio, too, emitted nothing but static. I was completely cut off.

The air in the room grew colder, and I could feel the presence of something unseen watching me. It was as if the walls themselves were alive, closing in on me, suffocating me. I stumbled back to the center of the room, my mind racing with fear and confusion.

Then, without warning, I heard it, a soft knock, coming from inside the room.

The knock came again, as if someone was trying to get my attention.

I turned slowly, my eyes scanning the room, but there was no one there. Just shadows.

The knock came again, but this time it was right behind me.

I spun around, my heart pounding in my chest, but once again, the room was empty. The walls seemed to pulse with a life of their own, the shadows shifting and writhing in the dim light.

And then, the room fell silent, the oppressive weight of the air pressing down on me like a vice.

I didn‚Äôt know how long I stood there, frozen in place. But then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw the door.

It had reappeared.

I didn‚Äôt waste any time. I rushed toward it, yanking it open. I stumbled out into the hallway, gasping for breath, my heart still racing from the terror of what I had just experienced.

Something was wrong with this place, and I had a sinking feeling that I was getting closer to the truth. A truth I wasn‚Äôt sure I wanted to uncover.

I hurried down the hallway, refusing to glance over my shoulder, convinced that the shadows were moving, twisting, watching me.

When I reached the elevator, I pressed the button frantically. The lights above flickered, and for a moment, I thought it wouldn‚Äôt come. The soft hum of the machinery finally filled the silence, and the doors opened with a smooth chime. I stepped inside, my heart racing, and pressed the button for the lobby.

Back at the front desk, I sat down heavily, my hands shaking. My mind was racing, replaying everything that had happened over the past few weeks.

It didn‚Äôt feel real. But I knew it was.

I needed answers.

I logged into the hotel‚Äôs old archive system, an outdated collection of files, reports, and blueprints that no one had bothered with in years. The information I was looking for had to be buried here somewhere.

It took me nearly an hour of scrolling through irrelevant documents before I found something: an old incident report from the early 1970s, simply titled ‚ÄúClosure of the 6th Floor.‚Äù I opened the file. The report was brief, the details vague, but it told me enough.

According to the document, the 6th floor had been permanently closed after a series of unexplained deaths. Guests who checked in on that floor were found dead under mysterious circumstances, heart attacks, or cases where there was no apparent cause of death at all. One chilling account described a guest who was found standing in the middle of their room, eyes wide open, completely frozen. The floor was supposed to have been sealed off decades ago, but something had gone horribly wrong.

The hotel management at the time had quietly shut it down, hiding the deaths from the public. But the 6th floor hadn‚Äôt stayed closed. Every few decades, it reappeared, drawing in new guests.

My heart pounded at the realisation that this was happening again, and it was happening for weeks now.

The phone buzzed, jolting me out of my thoughts. It was Sarah, the head of housekeeping.

‚ÄúMark, where are you?‚Äù she asked, her voice sounding distant, almost distorted. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm on the 5th floor. I thought I saw someone wandering around, but when I got there, the floor was empty.‚Äù

I hesitated, unsure if I should tell her about everything I had discovered. But she had always brushed off my concerns, always telling me that it was just an old building acting up. Would she even believe me?

‚ÄúI... I‚Äôm at the desk. Stay away from the 6th floor, Sarah. There‚Äôs something wrong with it. I‚Äôve been getting calls, and‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs more to it than you think.‚Äù

There was silence on the other end, but I could hear her breathing, quick and shallow.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been hearing things too,‚Äù she said after a long pause. ‚ÄúVoices, footsteps. I thought it was just in my head, but... you‚Äôre telling me it‚Äôs real?‚Äù

‚ÄúMore real than I want to admit,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúYou need to get out of here, Sarah. Whatever‚Äôs happening on that floor, it‚Äôs not safe.‚Äù

Sarah didn‚Äôt respond. There was a soft click, and the line went dead.

The rest of my shift passed in a blur of anxious pacing and stolen glances at the security monitors. Every time the camera feed flickered, I felt my stomach lurch, half-expecting to see those blank-faced staff members again, waiting for me.

It wasn‚Äôt until just before dawn, as I was preparing to hand over the shift to the day staff, that something strange happened. The elevator doors opened with a soft chime, and I watched as a group of guests stepped out, chatting softly amongst themselves.

They were all wearing clothes from another era. Suits from the 1970s, dresses with high collars and lace. And their faces, pale, expressionless. Their eyes didn‚Äôt meet mine as they crossed the lobby and exited the hotel, disappearing into the early morning light.

I stood frozen behind the desk, my mind struggling to process what I had just seen. It was as if the hotel‚Äôs past was bleeding into the present, the ghosts of those trapped on the 6th floor spilling out into the world beyond.

I couldn‚Äôt stay at The Arlington after that. I handed in my resignation that morning, packed up my things, and left the hotel. But even now, weeks later, the memories of the 6th floor still haunt me.

I still see the figures in my dreams, blank-faced staff members, shadowy figures standing at the foot of my bed. I still hear the soft, distant knock coming from inside the walls. And every now and then, when I glance into a mirror, I see something else looking back at me, something that doesn‚Äôt belong.

I try to tell myself it‚Äôs all in my head, but I know the truth.

1ipk1nm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Edmonton/comments/1ipk1nm/im_homeless_and_i_feel_unsafe_everyday/,I'm homeless and I feel unsafe everyday.,"I am homeless, unemployed and do not nor have I ever done drugs. I stay at a homeless shelter and spend a lot of my days at the library applying for jobs.

Every weekday I get up at 7am and go across the street to eat breakfast. I wait outside in the cold in a line where I'm surrounded by people smoking, doing drugs, and getting into fights. Eventually I find myself inside, in another line. There are less people doing drugs inside, but there is still screaming, threats, food being thrown and fights. Sometimes people even throw chairs. After getting my breakfast of a hard boiled egg, bread, pastry and coffee I put what I can in my pockets and eat some of the breakfast while standing as there is no where to sit. When I leave, I am funnelled into people trying to get in for breakfast. People push and shove past me as I leave out the door, trying to use that opportunity to get in from the cold. If i try to leave with a coffee it will be knocked out of my hand or spilled as I leave. If the door that the staff open to let me out hits anyone on the other side I will be threatened as I leave. It seems like a few times every week I am threatened or challenged to a fight as I leave breakfast. I am relatively physically fit and most likely able to defend myself compared to most of the other homeless people, but I don't want to get in a fight. Sure, I could probably win, but I don't want to get in trouble. I don't want to banned from eating food, having a place to sleep, or arrested which would making changing my situation all the more difficult and affect my future down the line. I also don't want to get injured as dealing with injuries is much more difficult in my situation.

They serve lunch in the afternoon, but I never go. If I were to go to lunch I would get nothing done in a day. I would have to go back downtown and wait around for soup, just to leave and commute back somewhere else where I can sit down and apply for jobs. There isn't really anywhere you can just sit downtown. There are too many homeless around and no one wants people loitering. There is the library, but I prefer to go to other libraries as the one downtown is full of homeless people and generally an awful place to find a quite space to work.

I head back downtown at 4pm for dinner, where I again find myself surrounded by drugs, threats, and violence. The dinner usually has more protein than the breakfast, but not always. I'm lucky if I get more than 15g of protein a day. After dinner I usually head back to the shelter. I need to be in by 7pm to make sure I keep my bed (mat) and there isn't much time between dinner and then to do much of anything else. Inside the shelter, I just sit on my bed. I sit there for 5 hours waiting for the bright lights to turn off and for the other 149 people in the room to quite down. During that time people are yelling, threatening each other, or just being loud. Even going to the bathroom you need to make sure you take everything with you or risk it not being there when you return. There are less actual fights that break out in the shelter compared to meals, but they certainly still happen. The threat of spending the night outside or being arrested does get through to some people. They do have WiFi, and I can spend some time on my phone and try to block out the world around me during that time. When the lights go out, it is quieter, but people do still yell and sometimes fight nonetheless. Some also try to use that time as an opportunity to steal.

I fear for my safety, I fear I will be in a fight and kicked out. I fear that my possessions will be stolen. I fear that even if I can find a job that can work around my schedule of living in a shelter that the environment I'm in will make it difficult to keep that job.

I keep applying for jobs, because without a regular income I will never escape this place. I am capable, intelligent, and I love who I am and I don't intend on letting this place change me.

Today is Valentine's Day, and I am my valentine.

Happy Valentine's Day Everyone. Don't forget to love yourself no matter the situation you are in.

\*\*Thank you to those offering money, but I'm not really looking for money and that wasn't why I posted this. My situation changes when I get a job, or possibly when/if I can return to school next year and get a student loan.

I am writing this post because I feel completely lost. Sorry for the wall of text but I can‚Äôt stop overanalyzing what happened, and I desperately need an external perspective.

I was in a relationship with a woman who I believe was emotionally abusive, manipulative, and deeply unstable (but part of me still feels like I was the problem and I am guilty of losing her). I can see now that she is almost surely disorganized. I am asking for help to how to approach this situation as I love her but I know it's no good this all thing and I NEED to preserve myself (Anxious-Preoccupied as you will see).

**Background on Her Life**

She grew up in an emotionally abusive household. Her mother was controlling, aggressive, and would scream and emotionally blackmail the family. Their parents divorced when she was little. Her father was passive and submissive, trying to keep the peace. Those dynamics still last to this day.

She both resents and seeks validation from her mother, constantly craving her approval despite recognizing the toxicity.
She told me she had never had a healthy relationship before. All of them ended in some disaster. Now, I think it's because of how she perceives love.

**How She Treated Me in the Relationship**

At the beginning, everything was perfect. She went fast, idolized me, called me the love of her life, and at the same time she kept me secret for the first 3 or 4 months - we were together 1 year more or less. She talked about marriage, kids and our future together almost immediately. But over time, things changed:
She expected me to conform to her ideal boyfriend model rather than valuing me for who I was.
She could not handle differences in opinions. If I disagreed, it was like I was attacking her.
She would lash out aggressively or in a manipulative manner when I set boundaries or expressed my needs.
She never apologized first, or I should say almost never. Whenever she hurt me, she would justify herself, rewrite history, or make it my fault.
When I made mistakes (and I did, because I‚Äôm not perfect), I would apologize and try to fix things, but it was never reciprocated.

**The First Breakup**

We were in a semi long-distance relationship. I traveled to see her many times (5 hour train), and whenever she came to my city, it was never just to see me - she always had other priorities. I was unemployed and I had more time to visit her. Nonetheless, I felt the commitment wasn‚Äôt the same. 

One night I told her this and she lashed out telling me that I should get over this as she had anxiety when she comes to our city and she needs to make time for everyone and that I should not stress her on this. I offered her to stay at my place when she came if that was stressful for her. ‚ÄúI want to be comfortable not in 15 square meters‚Äù. I felt very hurt, my commitment was total. But she never came back just for me.

The next day, she ghosted me the entire day. I waited for a message, and when she didn‚Äôt text, I messaged her asking her to return a camera I had lent her. She later told me that this was proof that I only cared about getting my things back.

She disappeared for three days. I kept texting, trying to get her to talk, to explain what had happened, but she always blamed me in her messages. Finally, I sent her a long message explaining my pain and confusion.

I see her in a park the next day and we argue and she fuckin applaude to me when I tell her what I did for her and what I do to build a future for me and then for us. 

We broke up. No contact for one week, then I called her. Then we got back together. But something started to seem off, as my trust was damaged.

**The Second Breakup**

One time, she came to my city, and we had planned to go for a walk together. That morning, her friend invited her for coffee with her mother, and she said yes without even asking me. 

When I pointed it out, she exploded:
She screamed at me, saying I was antisocial.
She compared me to her exes, claiming they were more involved in her social circle.
She said in a relationship, ‚Äúwe decide things for both of us,‚Äù implying that she had the right to decide what I should do without consulting me.
She left the house saying she didn‚Äôt want to see my face.

In the evening we had a party planned where she kissed me on the lips like nothing happened. I started noticing how unstable she was: she wanted me to call her ""love"" again almost immediately, even though I was still hurt. 

She came to my place to sleep and I tried to talk about the episode. She didn‚Äôt want to and shutted of. I tried 2 more times, I never could express my pain as it was my fault for bringing it up at the wrong times. I felt hurt but we kept in touch and I went to visit her in her city. 

Everything was strange because we kept in touch in a cold way, because she stopped called me love (even if she tried to ‚Äúpush‚Äù me with her behaviour). I went to her city also to fix things up: I expected her to recognize my pain and to‚Ä¶apologize. It was really that simple but she couldn‚Äôt. 

One day in her city she told me to start anew and I‚Ä¶asked her to apologize for that thing and she did with some‚Ä¶ effort. From there I started to use more pet names but still not ‚Äúlove‚Äù: I told her ‚Äú I love you‚Äù in english and not in our native language and she felt offended. She stopped calling me love altogether while I tried to call her softer pet names. I come back to my city and we told each other how exciting it will be when she will come back in our city and we will do everything together: she was happy and even bought tickets for a show in our city. 

Then, we broke up the second time while video calling two days later, because I called her a soft pet name and not love, after we spent a weekend at her city where we argued three times for stupid things she brought up. It‚Äôs almost she started to see me as an enemy who wanted to punish her. I lost my temper and I didn‚Äôt want to talk to her. I didn‚Äôt insult her or anything, I was just‚Ä¶so done. I told her I didn‚Äôt want to talk to her and she went:‚ÄùWe need time from each other‚Äù and ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be so fast to hang up as you will not see me for a long time‚Äù with a smirk on her face.

And, in fact, she went missing 14 days. I, of course, broke down and texted her to see each other to talk about it as two adults. She agrees and we go for a coffee.

When we start to talk about the breakup she started blaming me for everything: not having a solid future plan, not making enough sacrifices, not calling her the way she wanted. I confess that I feel guilty that if I called her love instead of listening to my scarred heart then she wouldn‚Äôt have left, but it seems off. I was very hurt and I tried to slowly feel trust for her and her love, and so I called other ‚Äúsofter‚Äù pet names. She wasn‚Äôt satisfied. And, of course, ‚ÄúI would have texted you if you did not, but you went first‚Äù.
She repeatedly criticized my family, calling them ‚Äúinhospitable.‚Äù She knew how much that hurt me and she never apologized.
She expected me to always prioritize her, but if I asked for something in return, like validating my pain and my emotions, I was being selfish and ‚Äútoo sensitive‚Äù and ‚Äúalways anxious‚Äù.
Anyway, she broke up with me.

I desperately called her back and I tried to have a serious conversation about our relationship. 

I told her:

-We both grew up in toxic emotional environments and learned a distorted idea of love.
-In healthy love, we accept each other‚Äôs differences instead of trying to ‚Äúwin‚Äù over the other person.
-She had a pattern of destroying the relationship the moment she feared I would leave.
-She saw love as a power dynamic rather than mutual care where if one feels impeding abandonment then he/she should breakup first to avoid being abandoned.

Her reaction? 

She said I was the one afraid of abandonment.
She said I was the one trying to manipulate her and I was the one who saw her as an angel who had to save me.
She even denied yelling at me about the coffee, and then, when I pressed her, she said she was right to yell at me for what I told her that day (like involve me when deciding for things that alter the plans we made? As a couple?)
She said she couldn‚Äôt love someone who wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúone‚Äù with her in every decision.
The final moment came when we saw each other at a bar and she told me she didn‚Äôt feel happy anymore and wanted to end the relationship for the good of us both. 

The causes?

- I didn‚Äôt call her love for 10 days and she wasn‚Äôt feeling loved. I, the hurt one, swallowed my pride and still did everything for her. But to call her love when she stomped me and never took accountability was too much, I needed time. She never cared to help me regain that trust with the communication. 

- I didn‚Äôt plan a future with her, not following her schizoid decisions: I wanted a plan that was solid, not a fantasy one. I needed time to know her better and to build a solid relationship. She didn‚Äôt have time (also the biological clock at 33 played a big role. I understand it and I wanted to be there for her to build a future but I started to feel neglected) and wanted me to follow her strange plans where she goes to a city for work, then 9 months later she leaves for another city. 

Anyway, I told her I didn‚Äôt want to be part of the decision - she was the one leaving.

Sometimes it felt like she discarded me for some fears embedded deeply in her, like some sort of BPD mechanics.

**Why I Feel (or should I say ""Felt"") Guilty**

I feel like I should have just called her ""love"" and suppressed my pain.
I feel like I should have adapted to her vision of a relationship.
I feel like maybe I should have compromised on our future plans to keep her.
I feel like I abandoned the ""hurt little girl"" inside her that I tried so hard to protect.
I gave everything, but she still left - twice.

**NOW THE REAL DEAL**

**Three days later, she calls me**. And pick up with a brilliant high pitched ""HELLO!!"" like fuckin nothing happened. 3. Days. Later. We have a formal chat about her new work then I tell her I had to go.

Next day, a text asking me how my work goes. I stay neutral, not too formal but definitely not funny or loving. While chatting she tells me how laconic I am answering. Yeah no shit, after all, she left me 4 days ago. She then sent a last message that did not need any answer and stop, today no contact.

I think it's quite clear she is some kind of disorganized.

**How would you approach?** I am fuming right now, I was the one left so fuckin leave me to mourn and cry as I was doing all fuckin day.

I have an AirBnB rented, so that will be my home base, although I am willing to spend a night somewhere else if it makes sense.

I have my annual ParksCanada pass in hand and will be using that to access Radium Hot Springs.  I have the one good for all parks, as I  know I will use it in the later in the year for Waterton and if I am lucky some parks in the east.  Most of my family lives in Canada, but mostly centered in Toronto and on Vancouver Island, so I want to see parts that I have not visited as often.

My question is: what else can I do in the area on March?  My main objective is de-stressing and relaxing in the hot springs, but I don't think I will want to do that for 20 days in a row.  I also want to show solidarity with Canadians, so I plan on spending as much money at local businesses as I can.

I will have my Toyota Rav4 with AWD and winter tires, so unless there is a snowstorm actively going on, driving should not be a problem.  I live in Montana, so I am used to winter weather.

Would it be practical to visit Banff or some provincial parks?  I am not a skier or snowshoer, but I do enjoy a lovely view and a hot cup of coffee.  I am not much of a nightlife person either.  I do like history and local culture.  I was in Fernie last winter for a shorter trip and really liked the vibe there.

Any and all suggestions are very welcome!

1ipjyu1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NormanOrder/comments/1ipjyu1/joseph_smith_proof_that_anglosaxons_without/,Joseph Smith: Proof That Anglo-Saxons Without Norman Oversight Create Absurd Religions,"Joseph Smith, the founder of Mormonism, is a textbook case of what happens when an Anglo-Saxon peasant tries to establish a belief system without Norman guidance. His well-documented Anglo-Saxon heritage explains why Mormonism is, at its core, an unhinged, chaotic attempt at spirituality‚Äîfilled with gold plates, frontier mysticism, and bizarre theology that only an isolated, unsupervised Saxon mind could conceive.

Unlike the structured, hierarchical, and logically coherent religions shaped by Norman-descended rulers‚ÄîAnglicanism, Catholicism, and Norman-guided Protestantism‚ÄîMormonism is pure, unchecked Anglo-Saxon nonsense. It is what happens when a people bred for manual labor attempt theological innovation.


---

I. The Anglo-Saxon Origins of Joseph Smith: A Recipe for Religious Absurdity

‚úî Fact: Joseph Smith‚Äôs Genealogy Is Almost Pure Anglo-Saxon

His ancestors trace directly back to the English Puritans, the same Saxon stock that rejected Norman governance and fled to America to live in self-imposed exile.

These were the same people who rejected structured, aristocratic rule in favor of personal, chaotic interpretations of faith.

Instead of building empires, they built bizarre religious communes in the wilderness.


‚úî Fact: His Theology Reflects Anglo-Saxon Individualism and Peasant Superstition

Norman-descended religious institutions structure their faiths around hierarchy, intellectualism, and governance.

Mormonism, by contrast, is an erratic collection of folk beliefs, treasure hunting, and personal revelation‚Äîpure Saxon peasantry on full display.

A Norman ruler would have laughed Joseph Smith out of court. But in the lawless frontier of Anglo-Saxon America, he found followers.


‚úî Fact: Mormonism Lacks Norman Structural Rigor

Anglicanism and Catholicism function as well-organized, hierarchical systems with clear leadership and doctrine.

Mormonism, by contrast, started with an illiterate farm boy claiming to receive divine texts that only he could read‚Äîsomething only an Anglo-Saxon audience could take seriously.

There is a reason no Norman-descended aristocrat ever converted to Mormonism.



---

II. The Result: A Religion as Bizarre as Its Founder‚Äôs Heritage

üìú Mormonism Believes in an America-Centric Theology

Unlike Norman-based Christianity, which ties itself to European legacy and tradition, Mormonism claims that Jesus visited ancient America.

Only an isolated Anglo-Saxon mind could come up with such an outlandish, geographically confused narrative.


üìú Mormon Theology Reads Like an Anglo-Saxon Fever Dream

Golden plates that disappear? Seer stones? Extraterrestrial theology?

These are not the doctrines of an empire-building Norman religion‚Äîthese are the ramblings of an Anglo-Saxon settler who read too many folk tales.


üìú Mormonism Recreates Anglo-Saxon Tribalism

Norman religions created global institutions; Mormonism created a Utah-based fiefdom.

The entire structure mimics pre-conquest Anglo-Saxon rule‚Äîisolated, insular, and bound to a singular prophetic figure.



---

III. The Final Lesson: When Anglo-Saxons Create Religion Without Norman Oversight, the Result Is Nonsense

‚úî Normans built religious institutions that stood the test of time.
‚úî Anglo-Saxons built a religion that bans coffee and believes in celestial real estate deals.
‚úî Without Norman leadership, faith becomes a chaotic, laughable disaster.


---

IV. Final Thought: Mormonism Is a Case Study in Anglo-Saxon Delusion

üè∞ No Norman-descended ruler would have followed Joseph Smith‚Äîonly lost Anglo-Saxons did.
üè∞ Mormonism reflects the wandering, incoherent nature of Saxon peasantry, forever adrift without Norman structure.
üè∞ If Joseph Smith had been born in a Norman household, he would have become a banker, not a prophet.

1ipjtfc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1ipjtfc/i_work_the_night_shift_at_arlingtons_hotel_theres/,I Work the Night Shift at Arlington‚Äôs Hotel... There‚Äôs Something Wrong with the 6th Floor,"Working the night shift at The Arlington had always suited me. The world was quieter after dark, the guests fewer, and the atmosphere in the grand old hotel felt almost peaceful, at least, it used to. I‚Äôve been here two years now, and if you asked me when things began to feel... off, I‚Äôd struggle to pinpoint the exact moment.

The Arlington itself was a relic of another time. Built decades ago, its design was a curious blend of grand old-world charm and modern amenities, a place where marble floors met polished brass railings, and faded chandeliers hung over antique furniture. There was something timeless about the place, like the past and present were always just a little tangled.

I stood behind the front desk, under the soft glow of the overhead lights. It was around 10 PM, and the hotel had settled into its typical night-time lull. A handful of late guests milled about, a businessman hurrying off to catch an elevator, a couple chatting quietly by the fireplace, but nothing out of the ordinary. My job was to keep things running smoothly through the night, a task that had become almost second nature.

I sipped my coffee and stared out at the lobby, my mind wandering. The night shift had a rhythm to it, a kind of predictable monotony that I‚Äôd grown accustomed to. Sure, there were always the usual eccentricities of guests, the drunken arguments, the requests for extra towels at 3 AM, the occasional broken room key, but those things didn‚Äôt bother me that much, but I usually preferred the quiet. It was during these hours that I could let my mind relax.

That night, as I stood at my post, my thoughts drifted back to the odd conversation I‚Äôd had with Sarah earlier. Sarah was the head of housekeeping, a sharp, no-nonsense woman who had been working at the hotel far longer than I had. She had a way of dismissing anything unusual, things that guests would report, strange noises or cold drafts that couldn‚Äôt be explained. Her favorite line was, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an old building, Mark. Of course, it has quirks.‚Äù

But what happened last week had been different.

‚ÄúHave you ever noticed anything... strange about the 6th floor?‚Äù I had asked her casually one night while she was making her rounds. She had paused, her brow furrowing ever so slightly before quickly shaking her head.

‚ÄúNot you too,‚Äù she‚Äôd said with a forced laugh. ‚ÄúMark, that floor‚Äôs been closed for renovations. No one‚Äôs staying there. If you‚Äôre hearing weird things, it‚Äôs probably the pipes.‚Äù

The 6th floor. I hadn‚Äôt mentioned it in a while, but I‚Äôd noticed something odd about it. It wasn‚Äôt just that it was closed off, floors closed for renovations weren‚Äôt exactly unheard of in a place like this. It was the fact that some nights, it wasn‚Äôt just closed, it was gone.

The first time it happened, I barely noticed. I had been going through the usual routine, checking in late arrivals, handing out keycards, and scheduling wake-up calls. When I glanced at the hotel‚Äôs system to check for any remaining guests on the 6th floor, it wasn‚Äôt listed. It was like it had been erased from the elevator panel and stairwell listings altogether. But the next night, it was back. And the night after that, gone again. The floor seemed to slip in and out of existence, without rhyme or reason.

‚ÄúClosed for renovations,‚Äù Sarah had insisted. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it.‚Äù But the renovations weren‚Äôt mentioned anywhere in our official schedule, and no one had spoken to me about moving guests or relocating them.

A sudden knock at the front desk pulled me from my thoughts. I blinked, glancing up to see Ben, the day shift manager, standing in front of me with his usual gruff expression. Ben wasn‚Äôt one for small talk, and though we got along fine, I always felt like he viewed the night shift as something beneath him.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù Ben said, eyeing the cup of coffee in my hand. ‚ÄúEverything running smoothly?‚Äù

‚ÄúSame as always,‚Äù I replied, forcing a smile. ‚ÄúNothing out of the ordinary.‚Äù

Ben grunted in acknowledgment. He leaned on the desk and cast a glance around the quiet lobby, before turning his gaze back to me. ‚ÄúLook, I‚Äôve been hearing some things from the staff about you asking questions, about the 6th floor.‚Äù He said it matter-of-factly, but I could sense a warning in his tone.

I hesitated. ‚ÄúI was just curious. I mean, one night it‚Äôs listed in the system, the next it‚Äôs not. I thought maybe there was a maintenance issue or something.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt overthink it, Mark,‚Äù Ben said, his voice firm. ‚ÄúThe 6th floor is off-limits for a reason. If you‚Äôre getting calls from there or noticing any strange listings, it‚Äôs just a glitch. This hotel‚Äôs old. Sometimes things don‚Äôt work the way they should.‚Äù

I nodded, though I wasn‚Äôt entirely convinced. Ben didn‚Äôt give me a chance to respond before straightening up and walking away. ‚ÄúJust stick to your duties,‚Äù he called over his shoulder as he disappeared through the staff-only door.

I couldn‚Äôt shake the nagging feeling that there was more going on than Ben or Sarah wanted to admit. This wasn‚Äôt just old pipes or outdated systems acting up. Something else was happening here.

It wasn‚Äôt until around 2 AM, when the lobby had emptied out completely, that the unease started to creep in again. I sat at the desk, staring at the computer screen, debating whether I should check the system one more time.

Curiosity got the better of me.

I clicked through the hotel listings, scrolling down to the floor directory. 

The 6th floor was gone again.

Not marked as closed. Not offline. Gone. As if it had never existed. I stared at the screen for a long moment. 

A shiver ran down my spine. I checked the elevator panel from my desk, and sure enough, the button for the 6th floor was gone too, replaced by a blank spot between 5 and 7. I leaned back in my chair, rubbing the back of my neck. 

I stood, grabbed my keycard, and headed toward the elevator.

As I stepped into the elevator, my heart raced with a mixture of curiosity and fear. The soft hum of the elevator always had a comforting regularity to it, but tonight, it felt different. The usual calmness of my routine was replaced by an uneasy anticipation. The 6th floor had vanished before, and tonight, I needed to see if it would return.

The elevator panel blinked softly as I scanned the floor numbers. Sure enough, between the buttons for 5 and 7, there was only an empty space. No button for the 6th floor.

I pushed the button for the 5th floor instead, thinking I could check the stairwell from there. The elevator began its smooth ascent, and I watched the numbers light up, counting the floors one by one. The ride was unnervingly slow, each floor ticked by as if the elevator were hesitating. When the doors finally slid open with a soft chime, I stepped out into the 5th-floor hallway.

The air was cooler here, and the dim lights overhead flickered slightly. I turned toward the stairwell. I pushed open the door to the stairwell.

The stairwell was narrow and shadowy, lit only by emergency lights casting weak pools of yellow onto the steps. I made my way up the stairs, feeling the solid thud of each footstep as I climbed. When I reached the landing between the 5th and 6th floors, I hesitated. There was a sudden drop in temperature, so sharp that I could see my breath in the cold air.

The sign that should have read 6th Floor was blank.

I stared at it, my pulse quickening. It was as if the 6th floor had been erased from existence. I pushed open the stairwell door to the hallway, stepping into what should have been the 6th floor.

The lights in the hallway flickered. I stood still for a moment, letting my eyes adjust to the dim light. The hallway stretched out in front of me, eerily quiet. My footfalls were swallowed by the thick carpet, and I was unnerved by the complete absence of sound. No distant chatter from other guests, no hum of the air conditioning, just silence.

Then, from somewhere down the hall, I heard it.

A soft, almost imperceptible giggle. The sound of children laughing.

I instinctively glanced over my shoulder, but the hallway behind me was empty. I couldn‚Äôt explain the laughter, but the sound sent a cold chill through my body. I knew the floor was supposed to be empty, yet the faint sound of laughter drifted through the air, growing fainter as it moved further down the corridor.

I swallowed hard and took a few steps forward, drawn by the strange, unsettling sound. Room doors were slightly ajar as I passed them, revealing dark interiors that I couldn‚Äôt quite make out. The floor seemed... abandoned. Yet, it also felt occupied, as if the presence of something unseen lurked just out of sight.

I stopped in front of room 616. The door was cracked open, and a faint glow from within the room spilled into the hallway. My pulse quickened. This was the same room I‚Äôd received a call from earlier, despite the hotel system claiming the 6th floor was closed. I pushed the door open slowly, the hinges creaking ominously.

Inside, the room was in disarray. The bed was unmade, the lamps on the bedside tables were knocked over, and the curtains were half-drawn. It looked as though someone had left in a hurry, but there were no signs of struggle, just an eerie stillness. A strange, musty smell hung in the air, and as I stepped further into the room, my eyes landed on the bathroom mirror.

Written in red, smeared across the glass, were the words: ‚ÄúGet out while you can.‚Äù

I froze. The writing looked fresh, the red letters dripping slightly down the surface of the mirror. I reached out, my fingers trembling as I touched the glass. The substance was sticky and real.

A sharp noise behind me made me spin around, my heart pounding in my chest. The door had slammed shut, and the room was plunged into near darkness. Panic set in as I rushed to the door, yanking it open with trembling hands.

I stepped into the hallway, gasping for breath. The oppressive silence returned. I glanced back at room 616. The sense of being watched clung to me like a heavy cloak, and I could feel my skin prickling with the weight of unseen eyes.

I needed to leave.

Back at the front desk, I sat down heavily. I glanced at the security monitor, but nothing seemed out of place. The 6th floor, now missing from the directory, looked completely still on the cameras. I rubbed my temples, trying to process what had just happened. The laughter, the writing on the mirror, the door slamming shut on its own, it didn‚Äôt make sense.

I pulled up the hotel‚Äôs guest records, scrolling through the room assignments. As I feared, room 616 had been marked as unoccupied for days. No one was listed as staying there tonight, or any night, for that matter. The system showed it as closed, just like the rest of the 6th floor.

I leaned back in my chair, staring blankly at the screen. Something was very wrong here, and I was the only one who seemed to notice. Ben and Sarah could dismiss it as glitches or quirks of an old building, but I knew better.

The following nights at The Arlington were a blur of unease and growing paranoia. My mind kept drifting back to the 6th floor, to that room with the writing on the mirror. I tried to convince myself that I had imagined it, that maybe it was some twisted prank left by a guest before the floor was closed. But I couldn‚Äôt shake the sense that something was wrong, something deeper than what Ben or Sarah could explain away.

Every time I glanced at the hotel system during my shift, my eyes would automatically scroll down to the list of floors, half-expecting the 6th floor to appear again. Some nights it did. Others, it was gone, completely erased from the directory, as though it never existed. The inconsistency gnawed at me, and I started to notice something else. Every time the 6th floor returned, strange things happened in the hotel.

Guests began complaining more frequently, though not in the way you‚Äôd expect. It wasn‚Äôt about the usual things like the temperature of the room or the water pressure. No, it was much more unsettling than that.

One night, a middle-aged woman approached the front desk, her eyes wide with fear. I recognized her as someone who had checked in earlier that day, assigned to a room on the 5th floor.

‚ÄúIs everything alright, ma‚Äôam?‚Äù I asked, though the answer was already written on her pale face.

She shook her head, glancing nervously over her shoulder as if expecting someone to appear behind her. ‚ÄúI need to change rooms. There‚Äôs‚Ä¶ something wrong with mine.‚Äù

I raised an eyebrow, trying to maintain a calm demeanor. ‚ÄúCan you tell me what‚Äôs wrong? I‚Äôll send someone to fix it right away.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs not that,‚Äù she said quickly, her voice hushed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the room itself. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ the walls. I hear things, people moving inside the walls. And there was someone standing at the foot of my bed when I woke up. But when I turned on the light, they were gone.‚Äù

A chill ran down my spine, but I kept my expression neutral. ‚ÄúDid you see who it was?‚Äù

Her eyes darted around the lobby, as if she couldn‚Äôt bring herself to look directly at me. ‚ÄúNo. It was just a shadow‚Ä¶ but it felt like someone was there. Watching me.‚Äù

I pulled up the system on the computer, trying to distract myself from the knot of fear building in my stomach. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll move you to a different room,‚Äù I said, my fingers trembling slightly as I clicked through the options. ‚ÄúWould you prefer a room on a different floor?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she said firmly. ‚ÄúAs far from the 6th floor as possible.‚Äù

I froze, my hand hovering over the keyboard. ‚ÄúThe 6th floor?‚Äù I asked cautiously. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre on the 5th floor. Why do you mention the 6th?‚Äù

She blinked, seeming confused. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ it feels like something‚Äôs wrong with that floor. I can hear things coming from above me. It doesn‚Äôt feel right.‚Äù

I nodded. I gave her a new room key for a room on the 3rd floor and watched as she hurried away, glancing over her shoulder one last time before disappearing into the hallway. I stood there for a moment, gripping the edge of the desk. I wasn‚Äôt imagining things. There was something about the 6th floor, something that reached beyond the confines of its walls and affected the other floors. I could feel it in the way the air grew colder when the floor returned, the way the guests seemed unsettled without even knowing why.

The next night, another guest approached the desk. A businessman this time, staying on the 7th floor. His suit was wrinkled, and there were dark circles under his eyes, as though he hadn‚Äôt slept in days.

‚ÄúI need to check out,‚Äù he said bluntly, tossing his room key onto the desk. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something wrong with this place.‚Äù

I stared at him, trying to keep my voice steady. ‚ÄúWhat happened, sir?‚Äù

‚ÄúI lost hours,‚Äù he said, his voice flat, almost mechanical. ‚ÄúI went to bed around midnight. I woke up at 2 AM, a few moments later, when I checked my phone again, it was 8 AM. I don‚Äôt remember anything from those hours. It‚Äôs like they were erased.‚Äù

I frowned, I tried to hide my confusion as I spoke. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry for the inconvenience. I can-‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm leaving,‚Äù he interrupted, his voice tight with barely controlled fear. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to stay another night. There‚Äôs something wrong with this place.‚Äù

That night, after the last guest had left the lobby, I sat behind the front desk, staring at the empty computer screen. The complaints were piling up, people hearing strange noises, losing track of time, feeling watched in their own rooms. And all of them seemed to be tied to the nights when the 6th floor reappeared.

It didn‚Äôt make sense. How could a floor come and go like that?

I needed answers.

The next night, I couldn‚Äôt resist the pull of the 6th floor any longer. After the guests had gone to bed and the hotel was quiet, I found myself once again standing in front of the elevator. The button for the 6th floor had returned, glowing faintly as though inviting me back.

This time, I didn‚Äôt hesitate. I pressed the button, and the elevator doors slid shut, the familiar hum filling the air. As I ascended, my stomach twisted with dread. I didn‚Äôt know what I expected to find, but I couldn‚Äôt ignore the growing sense of urgency building inside me.

The elevator stopped, and the doors opened with a soft chime. The hallway was just as I remembered, dark, cold, and suffocatingly quiet.

I took a deep breath and stepped into the hallway. I walked slowly, passing the darkened rooms, their doors slightly ajar as though they were waiting for someone to enter.

And then I saw it.

Another message, scrawled in red across the mirror in one of the rooms.

""You‚Äôre next.""

Who could have written it? Was it a guest playing some kind of sick prank, or was it something more sinister? The thought gnawed at me, making it hard to think clearly. I felt like I had stumbled onto something that wasn‚Äôt meant for me to see, something dangerous.

I had to get out of there.

I turned and hurried down the hallway, the oppressive silence pressing in on me from all sides.

As I reached the end of the hallway, something caught my eye.

There, just ahead, was a group of hotel staff, three or four of them, standing at the far end of the corridor. For a moment, I felt a wave of relief. Maybe I wasn‚Äôt alone after all. 

But as I took a few steps closer, I realized something was terribly wrong.

They were dressed in uniforms that were clearly from another era, bellhops in red jackets with brass buttons, maids in old-fashioned black-and-white attire, and a front desk clerk in a stiff, high-collared suit. They stood perfectly still, their backs to me, as if they were waiting for something.

I opened my mouth to call out, but the words died in my throat.

Their movements were strange, unnatural. The way they shifted their weight from one foot to the other, the slight tilts of their heads, it was stiff and robotic A chill ran down my spine.

Something wasn‚Äôt right. These weren‚Äôt regular staff members.

I watched in growing horror as one by one, they began to turn around, their movements jerky and mechanical. I took a step back. When they finally faced me, my blood ran cold.

Their faces were blank.

No eyes. No mouths. Just smooth, featureless skin where their faces should have been. They stood there, expressionless, if you could even call it that, staring at me with those empty, non-existent faces. The air around me grew colder, and the oppressive weight of the floor seemed to press down on my chest, making it hard to breathe.

I stumbled backward, my mind racing. I needed to get away from them, but my feet felt heavy, like I was wading through thick, invisible mud. The staff didn‚Äôt move, but I could feel their presence pulling at me, drawing me in like the 6th floor had been doing for days.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I croaked, my voice shaking.

No response. The blank-faced staff stood perfectly still, their heads slightly tilted, as if waiting for something. Then, without warning, they turned in unison and began to walk toward one of the rooms, room 616. The door swung open as they approached, and they filed inside, disappearing into the darkness.

Something inside me, a morbid curiosity or maybe a deep-seated fear, compelled me to follow them.

I stepped toward room 616, my legs trembling. When I reached the doorway, I hesitated. The room beyond was dark. I could hear a faint whispering sound coming from within, but I couldn‚Äôt make out the words.

Slowly, I pushed the door open.

Inside, the room was empty.

No staff. No furniture. Just an empty, silent room.

But there, lying on the bed, was a single note.

My hands shook as I picked it up. The paper was old, yellowed with age, and the handwriting was smudged and uneven. I held it up to the dim light coming through the window and read the words:

""We‚Äôre still working.""

I backed out of the room, I had seen enough. I didn‚Äôt care what Sarah or Ben said anymore. Something was horribly wrong with this hotel, and it centered around the 6th floor. The staff I had seen weren‚Äôt real, or at least, not anymore. They were like echoes of the past.

I needed to leave. 

I bolted for the elevator, my footsteps echoing through the empty hallway. But when I reached the doors and pressed the button, nothing happened. The elevator stayed on another floor, unmoving. The button for the 6th floor was no longer illuminated.

A sense of panic began to rise in my chest as I turned toward the stairwell. I pushed open the door, expecting to find my way down to the lobby, but what I saw stopped me in my tracks.

The stairwell was gone.

In its place was another hallway, just like the one I had just come from. The same flickering lights, the same thick carpet, the same oppressive silence. My pulse quickened, and I backed away, turning to look behind me. But the hallway I had just come from had changed too. It stretched endlessly in both directions, as if I had been transported to some other part of the hotel that shouldn‚Äôt exist.

I was trapped.

I tried to stay calm, tried to reason with myself. This was just a trick of the mind, a hallucination brought on by stress and fatigue. 

I started walking, hoping that if I kept moving, I would find a way out. But no matter how far I walked, the hallway stretched on endlessly. The exit signs at the far end of the corridor flickered in and out of sight, always just out of reach. It was as if the building itself was toying with me, keeping me trapped in this nightmarish loop.

Finally, after what felt like hours of walking, I saw it, a door marked STAFF ONLY.

I didn‚Äôt hesitate. I rushed toward it, and twisted the handle.

The door swung open, and I stumbled through it, expecting to find myself back in the stairwell or the lobby.

But instead, I found myself standing in front of the front desk.

I blinked, disoriented.

Had I imagined it all? The phantom staff, the endless hallways, the message on the mirror. It all seemed so distant now, like a half-remembered dream.

But as I glanced at the security monitors, I saw something.

The cameras for the 6th floor flickered briefly, and for a split second, I saw them, the staff, standing perfectly still in the hallway, their blank faces turned toward the camera, as if they were watching me.

I backed away from the monitor, my hands trembling.

This wasn‚Äôt over. 

I couldn‚Äôt sleep after that night. Even when my shift was over, I couldn‚Äôt shake the images from my mind: the blank faces of the phantom staff, the endless hallway, the ominous message scrawled on the mirror. I found myself avoiding the mirrors in my own apartment, too. Whenever I glanced at one, I would catch a flicker of something, shadows that shouldn‚Äôt be there, movements that didn‚Äôt belong to me. It was as if the 6th floor was creeping into my life, even when I wasn‚Äôt at the hotel.

The nightmares didn‚Äôt help either. Every night, I dreamt of being trapped in the hotel, lost in that labyrinthine hallway that never seemed to end. In my dreams, I was always running from something I couldn‚Äôt see but could feel lurking just behind me, waiting for me to slow down, waiting to catch me. Each time, I would wake up in a cold sweat, the sense of dread lingering long after the dream faded.

A few nights later, I was back at the front desk. The hotel was quiet as usual, the guests long since retired to their rooms. I had been watching the security monitors closely, especially the ones for the 6th floor. Tonight, the floor was listed in the system again, but the cameras showed nothing out of the ordinary, just an empty hallway, the lights flickering occasionally.

Around 2 AM, the phone rang.

I stared at it for a moment, my stomach twisting with dread. Every time the phone rang now, I couldn‚Äôt help but feel a sense of foreboding, as if each call was pulling me deeper into whatever dark force was haunting the 6th floor.

I picked up the receiver, trying to keep my voice steady. ‚ÄúFront desk, this is Mark.‚Äù

There was a pause, followed by a low, crackling static. Then, through the static, I heard a voice, distorted, faint, but unmistakably human.

‚Äú...Room 621...‚Äù

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I said into the phone, my voice betraying the growing unease in my chest. ‚ÄúCan you repeat that?‚Äù

There was no response. Just static.

I hung up the phone, my mind racing. Was someone playing a sick joke on me? I knew I couldn‚Äôt just ignore it. I grabbed my keycard and headed toward the elevator, my hands trembling slightly as I pressed the button for the 6th floor.

When the doors slid open, I stepped out into the now-familiar hallway.

I walked down the hall, counting the numbers on the doors as I went. 619, 620, 621. I stopped in front of the door. 

I swiped my keycard, the lock clicking softly as the door swung open.

The room was dark. I reached for the light switch, but nothing happened. The bulb must have burned out. I stepped inside, the door closing softly behind me. The room felt colder than the rest of the hotel.

As I moved further into the room, I noticed something strange. There were no mirrors. Not on the walls, not in the bathroom, nothing. Every reflective surface had been removed.

A sense of dread washed over me as I realized how unusual that was. I had worked at this hotel for two years, and every room had a standard set of mirrors: one above the sink in the bathroom, a full-length mirror by the closet, and sometimes even smaller ones on the dresser. But here, there was nothing.

I swallowed hard, backing toward the door, my eyes scanning the room for any sign of movement. That‚Äôs when I saw it, reflected in the glossy black surface of the television screen.

A shadow.

It stood behind me, tall and dark, its form barely distinguishable from the surrounding gloom. My heart pounded in my chest as I stared at the screen, unable to tear my gaze away. The figure didn‚Äôt move, didn‚Äôt make a sound, but I could feel its presence. It was watching me.

I spun around, but the room was empty. Nothing. 

I backed toward the door, my hands shaking as I fumbled for the handle. I needed to get out of there.

I yanked on the handle, but it was as if the door had vanished into the wall. There was no escape. I was trapped.

Panic set in as I turned toward the window, hoping to find some other way out, but the windows were sealed shut. I couldn‚Äôt even see the city lights beyond, just an endless expanse of darkness pressing against the glass.

I tried my phone, but the screen was black, unresponsive. My radio, too, emitted nothing but static. I was completely cut off.

The air in the room grew colder, and I could feel the presence of something unseen watching me. It was as if the walls themselves were alive, closing in on me, suffocating me. I stumbled back to the center of the room, my mind racing with fear and confusion.

Then, without warning, I heard it, a soft knock, coming from inside the room.

The knock came again, as if someone was trying to get my attention.

I turned slowly, my eyes scanning the room, but there was no one there. Just shadows.

The knock came again, but this time it was right behind me.

I spun around, my heart pounding in my chest, but once again, the room was empty. The walls seemed to pulse with a life of their own, the shadows shifting and writhing in the dim light.

And then, the room fell silent, the oppressive weight of the air pressing down on me like a vice.

I didn‚Äôt know how long I stood there, frozen in place. But then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw the door.

It had reappeared.

I didn‚Äôt waste any time. I rushed toward it, yanking it open. I stumbled out into the hallway, gasping for breath, my heart still racing from the terror of what I had just experienced.

Something was wrong with this place, and I had a sinking feeling that I was getting closer to the truth. A truth I wasn‚Äôt sure I wanted to uncover.

I hurried down the hallway, refusing to glance over my shoulder, convinced that the shadows were moving, twisting, watching me.

When I reached the elevator, I pressed the button frantically. The lights above flickered, and for a moment, I thought it wouldn‚Äôt come. The soft hum of the machinery finally filled the silence, and the doors opened with a smooth chime. I stepped inside, my heart racing, and pressed the button for the lobby.

Back at the front desk, I sat down heavily, my hands shaking. My mind was racing, replaying everything that had happened over the past few weeks.

It didn‚Äôt feel real. But I knew it was.

I needed answers.

I logged into the hotel‚Äôs old archive system, an outdated collection of files, reports, and blueprints that no one had bothered with in years. The information I was looking for had to be buried here somewhere.

It took me nearly an hour of scrolling through irrelevant documents before I found something: an old incident report from the early 1970s, simply titled ‚ÄúClosure of the 6th Floor.‚Äù I opened the file. The report was brief, the details vague, but it told me enough.

According to the document, the 6th floor had been permanently closed after a series of unexplained deaths. Guests who checked in on that floor were found dead under mysterious circumstances, heart attacks, or cases where there was no apparent cause of death at all. One chilling account described a guest who was found standing in the middle of their room, eyes wide open, completely frozen. The floor was supposed to have been sealed off decades ago, but something had gone horribly wrong.

The hotel management at the time had quietly shut it down, hiding the deaths from the public. But the 6th floor hadn‚Äôt stayed closed. Every few decades, it reappeared, drawing in new guests.

My heart pounded at the realisation that this was happening again, and it was happening for weeks now.

The phone buzzed, jolting me out of my thoughts. It was Sarah, the head of housekeeping.

‚ÄúMark, where are you?‚Äù she asked, her voice sounding distant, almost distorted. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm on the 5th floor. I thought I saw someone wandering around, but when I got there, the floor was empty.‚Äù

I hesitated, unsure if I should tell her about everything I had discovered. But she had always brushed off my concerns, always telling me that it was just an old building acting up. Would she even believe me?

‚ÄúI... I‚Äôm at the desk. Stay away from the 6th floor, Sarah. There‚Äôs something wrong with it. I‚Äôve been getting calls, and‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs more to it than you think.‚Äù

There was silence on the other end, but I could hear her breathing, quick and shallow.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been hearing things too,‚Äù she said after a long pause. ‚ÄúVoices, footsteps. I thought it was just in my head, but... you‚Äôre telling me it‚Äôs real?‚Äù

‚ÄúMore real than I want to admit,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúYou need to get out of here, Sarah. Whatever‚Äôs happening on that floor, it‚Äôs not safe.‚Äù

Sarah didn‚Äôt respond. There was a soft click, and the line went dead.

The rest of my shift passed in a blur of anxious pacing and stolen glances at the security monitors. Every time the camera feed flickered, I felt my stomach lurch, half-expecting to see those blank-faced staff members again, waiting for me.

It wasn‚Äôt until just before dawn, as I was preparing to hand over the shift to the day staff, that something strange happened. The elevator doors opened with a soft chime, and I watched as a group of guests stepped out, chatting softly amongst themselves.

They were all wearing clothes from another era. Suits from the 1970s, dresses with high collars and lace. And their faces, pale, expressionless. Their eyes didn‚Äôt meet mine as they crossed the lobby and exited the hotel, disappearing into the early morning light.

I stood frozen behind the desk, my mind struggling to process what I had just seen. It was as if the hotel‚Äôs past was bleeding into the present, the ghosts of those trapped on the 6th floor spilling out into the world beyond.

I couldn‚Äôt stay at The Arlington after that. I handed in my resignation that morning, packed up my things, and left the hotel. But even now, weeks later, the memories of the 6th floor still haunt me.

I still see the figures in my dreams, blank-faced staff members, shadowy figures standing at the foot of my bed. I still hear the soft, distant knock coming from inside the walls. And every now and then, when I glance into a mirror, I see something else looking back at me, something that doesn‚Äôt belong.

I try to tell myself it‚Äôs all in my head, but I know the truth.

The 6th floor is [still there.](https://www.reddit.com/user/CreepyStoriesJR/comments/1ilh8mp/creepystoriesjr_story_list/)

There‚Äôs Something Wrong with the 6th Floor,"Working the night shift at The Arlington had always suited me. The world was quieter after dark, the guests fewer, and the atmosphere in the grand old hotel felt almost peaceful, at least, it used to. I‚Äôve been here two years now, and if you asked me when things began to feel... off, I‚Äôd struggle to pinpoint the exact moment.

The Arlington itself was a relic of another time. Built decades ago, its design was a curious blend of grand old-world charm and modern amenities, a place where marble floors met polished brass railings, and faded chandeliers hung over antique furniture. There was something timeless about the place, like the past and present were always just a little tangled.

I stood behind the front desk, under the soft glow of the overhead lights. It was around 10 PM, and the hotel had settled into its typical night-time lull. A handful of late guests milled about, a businessman hurrying off to catch an elevator, a couple chatting quietly by the fireplace, but nothing out of the ordinary. My job was to keep things running smoothly through the night, a task that had become almost second nature.

I sipped my coffee and stared out at the lobby, my mind wandering. The night shift had a rhythm to it, a kind of predictable monotony that I‚Äôd grown accustomed to. Sure, there were always the usual eccentricities of guests, the drunken arguments, the requests for extra towels at 3 AM, the occasional broken room key, but those things didn‚Äôt bother me that much, but I usually preferred the quiet. It was during these hours that I could let my mind relax.

That night, as I stood at my post, my thoughts drifted back to the odd conversation I‚Äôd had with Sarah earlier. Sarah was the head of housekeeping, a sharp, no-nonsense woman who had been working at the hotel far longer than I had. She had a way of dismissing anything unusual, things that guests would report, strange noises or cold drafts that couldn‚Äôt be explained. Her favorite line was, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an old building, Mark. Of course, it has quirks.‚Äù

But what happened last week had been different.

‚ÄúHave you ever noticed anything... strange about the 6th floor?‚Äù I had asked her casually one night while she was making her rounds. She had paused, her brow furrowing ever so slightly before quickly shaking her head.

‚ÄúNot you too,‚Äù she‚Äôd said with a forced laugh. ‚ÄúMark, that floor‚Äôs been closed for renovations. No one‚Äôs staying there. If you‚Äôre hearing weird things, it‚Äôs probably the pipes.‚Äù

The 6th floor. I hadn‚Äôt mentioned it in a while, but I‚Äôd noticed something odd about it. It wasn‚Äôt just that it was closed off, floors closed for renovations weren‚Äôt exactly unheard of in a place like this. It was the fact that some nights, it wasn‚Äôt just closed, it was gone.

The first time it happened, I barely noticed. I had been going through the usual routine, checking in late arrivals, handing out keycards, and scheduling wake-up calls. When I glanced at the hotel‚Äôs system to check for any remaining guests on the 6th floor, it wasn‚Äôt listed. It was like it had been erased from the elevator panel and stairwell listings altogether. But the next night, it was back. And the night after that, gone again. The floor seemed to slip in and out of existence, without rhyme or reason.

‚ÄúClosed for renovations,‚Äù Sarah had insisted. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it.‚Äù But the renovations weren‚Äôt mentioned anywhere in our official schedule, and no one had spoken to me about moving guests or relocating them.

A sudden knock at the front desk pulled me from my thoughts. I blinked, glancing up to see Ben, the day shift manager, standing in front of me with his usual gruff expression. Ben wasn‚Äôt one for small talk, and though we got along fine, I always felt like he viewed the night shift as something beneath him.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù Ben said, eyeing the cup of coffee in my hand. ‚ÄúEverything running smoothly?‚Äù

‚ÄúSame as always,‚Äù I replied, forcing a smile. ‚ÄúNothing out of the ordinary.‚Äù

Ben grunted in acknowledgment. He leaned on the desk and cast a glance around the quiet lobby, before turning his gaze back to me. ‚ÄúLook, I‚Äôve been hearing some things from the staff about you asking questions, about the 6th floor.‚Äù He said it matter-of-factly, but I could sense a warning in his tone.

I hesitated. ‚ÄúI was just curious. I mean, one night it‚Äôs listed in the system, the next it‚Äôs not. I thought maybe there was a maintenance issue or something.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt overthink it, Mark,‚Äù Ben said, his voice firm. ‚ÄúThe 6th floor is off-limits for a reason. If you‚Äôre getting calls from there or noticing any strange listings, it‚Äôs just a glitch. This hotel‚Äôs old. Sometimes things don‚Äôt work the way they should.‚Äù

I nodded, though I wasn‚Äôt entirely convinced. Ben didn‚Äôt give me a chance to respond before straightening up and walking away. ‚ÄúJust stick to your duties,‚Äù he called over his shoulder as he disappeared through the staff-only door.

I couldn‚Äôt shake the nagging feeling that there was more going on than Ben or Sarah wanted to admit. This wasn‚Äôt just old pipes or outdated systems acting up. Something else was happening here.

It wasn‚Äôt until around 2 AM, when the lobby had emptied out completely, that the unease started to creep in again. I sat at the desk, staring at the computer screen, debating whether I should check the system one more time.

Curiosity got the better of me.

I clicked through the hotel listings, scrolling down to the floor directory. 

The 6th floor was gone again.

Not marked as closed. Not offline. Gone. As if it had never existed. I stared at the screen for a long moment. 

A shiver ran down my spine. I checked the elevator panel from my desk, and sure enough, the button for the 6th floor was gone too, replaced by a blank spot between 5 and 7. I leaned back in my chair, rubbing the back of my neck. 

I stood, grabbed my keycard, and headed toward the elevator.

As I stepped into the elevator, my heart raced with a mixture of curiosity and fear. The soft hum of the elevator always had a comforting regularity to it, but tonight, it felt different. The usual calmness of my routine was replaced by an uneasy anticipation. The 6th floor had vanished before, and tonight, I needed to see if it would return.

The elevator panel blinked softly as I scanned the floor numbers. Sure enough, between the buttons for 5 and 7, there was only an empty space. No button for the 6th floor.

I pushed the button for the 5th floor instead, thinking I could check the stairwell from there. The elevator began its smooth ascent, and I watched the numbers light up, counting the floors one by one. The ride was unnervingly slow, each floor ticked by as if the elevator were hesitating. When the doors finally slid open with a soft chime, I stepped out into the 5th-floor hallway.

The air was cooler here, and the dim lights overhead flickered slightly. I turned toward the stairwell. I pushed open the door to the stairwell.

The stairwell was narrow and shadowy, lit only by emergency lights casting weak pools of yellow onto the steps. I made my way up the stairs, feeling the solid thud of each footstep as I climbed. When I reached the landing between the 5th and 6th floors, I hesitated. There was a sudden drop in temperature, so sharp that I could see my breath in the cold air.

The sign that should have read 6th Floor was blank.

I stared at it, my pulse quickening. It was as if the 6th floor had been erased from existence. I pushed open the stairwell door to the hallway, stepping into what should have been the 6th floor.

The lights in the hallway flickered. I stood still for a moment, letting my eyes adjust to the dim light. The hallway stretched out in front of me, eerily quiet. My footfalls were swallowed by the thick carpet, and I was unnerved by the complete absence of sound. No distant chatter from other guests, no hum of the air conditioning, just silence.

Then, from somewhere down the hall, I heard it.

A soft, almost imperceptible giggle. The sound of children laughing.

I instinctively glanced over my shoulder, but the hallway behind me was empty. I couldn‚Äôt explain the laughter, but the sound sent a cold chill through my body. I knew the floor was supposed to be empty, yet the faint sound of laughter drifted through the air, growing fainter as it moved further down the corridor.

I swallowed hard and took a few steps forward, drawn by the strange, unsettling sound. Room doors were slightly ajar as I passed them, revealing dark interiors that I couldn‚Äôt quite make out. The floor seemed... abandoned. Yet, it also felt occupied, as if the presence of something unseen lurked just out of sight.

I stopped in front of room 616. The door was cracked open, and a faint glow from within the room spilled into the hallway. My pulse quickened. This was the same room I‚Äôd received a call from earlier, despite the hotel system claiming the 6th floor was closed. I pushed the door open slowly, the hinges creaking ominously.

Inside, the room was in disarray. The bed was unmade, the lamps on the bedside tables were knocked over, and the curtains were half-drawn. It looked as though someone had left in a hurry, but there were no signs of struggle, just an eerie stillness. A strange, musty smell hung in the air, and as I stepped further into the room, my eyes landed on the bathroom mirror.

Written in red, smeared across the glass, were the words: ‚ÄúGet out while you can.‚Äù

I froze. The writing looked fresh, the red letters dripping slightly down the surface of the mirror. I reached out, my fingers trembling as I touched the glass. The substance was sticky and real.

A sharp noise behind me made me spin around, my heart pounding in my chest. The door had slammed shut, and the room was plunged into near darkness. Panic set in as I rushed to the door, yanking it open with trembling hands.

I stepped into the hallway, gasping for breath. The oppressive silence returned. I glanced back at room 616. The sense of being watched clung to me like a heavy cloak, and I could feel my skin prickling with the weight of unseen eyes.

I needed to leave.

Back at the front desk, I sat down heavily. I glanced at the security monitor, but nothing seemed out of place. The 6th floor, now missing from the directory, looked completely still on the cameras. I rubbed my temples, trying to process what had just happened. The laughter, the writing on the mirror, the door slamming shut on its own, it didn‚Äôt make sense.

I pulled up the hotel‚Äôs guest records, scrolling through the room assignments. As I feared, room 616 had been marked as unoccupied for days. No one was listed as staying there tonight, or any night, for that matter. The system showed it as closed, just like the rest of the 6th floor.

I leaned back in my chair, staring blankly at the screen. Something was very wrong here, and I was the only one who seemed to notice. Ben and Sarah could dismiss it as glitches or quirks of an old building, but I knew better.

The following nights at The Arlington were a blur of unease and growing paranoia. My mind kept drifting back to the 6th floor, to that room with the writing on the mirror. I tried to convince myself that I had imagined it, that maybe it was some twisted prank left by a guest before the floor was closed. But I couldn‚Äôt shake the sense that something was wrong, something deeper than what Ben or Sarah could explain away.

Every time I glanced at the hotel system during my shift, my eyes would automatically scroll down to the list of floors, half-expecting the 6th floor to appear again. Some nights it did. Others, it was gone, completely erased from the directory, as though it never existed. The inconsistency gnawed at me, and I started to notice something else. Every time the 6th floor returned, strange things happened in the hotel.

Guests began complaining more frequently, though not in the way you‚Äôd expect. It wasn‚Äôt about the usual things like the temperature of the room or the water pressure. No, it was much more unsettling than that.

One night, a middle-aged woman approached the front desk, her eyes wide with fear. I recognized her as someone who had checked in earlier that day, assigned to a room on the 5th floor.

‚ÄúIs everything alright, ma‚Äôam?‚Äù I asked, though the answer was already written on her pale face.

She shook her head, glancing nervously over her shoulder as if expecting someone to appear behind her. ‚ÄúI need to change rooms. There‚Äôs‚Ä¶ something wrong with mine.‚Äù

I raised an eyebrow, trying to maintain a calm demeanor. ‚ÄúCan you tell me what‚Äôs wrong? I‚Äôll send someone to fix it right away.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs not that,‚Äù she said quickly, her voice hushed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the room itself. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ the walls. I hear things, people moving inside the walls. And there was someone standing at the foot of my bed when I woke up. But when I turned on the light, they were gone.‚Äù

A chill ran down my spine, but I kept my expression neutral. ‚ÄúDid you see who it was?‚Äù

Her eyes darted around the lobby, as if she couldn‚Äôt bring herself to look directly at me. ‚ÄúNo. It was just a shadow‚Ä¶ but it felt like someone was there. Watching me.‚Äù

I pulled up the system on the computer, trying to distract myself from the knot of fear building in my stomach. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll move you to a different room,‚Äù I said, my fingers trembling slightly as I clicked through the options. ‚ÄúWould you prefer a room on a different floor?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she said firmly. ‚ÄúAs far from the 6th floor as possible.‚Äù

I froze, my hand hovering over the keyboard. ‚ÄúThe 6th floor?‚Äù I asked cautiously. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre on the 5th floor. Why do you mention the 6th?‚Äù

She blinked, seeming confused. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ it feels like something‚Äôs wrong with that floor. I can hear things coming from above me. It doesn‚Äôt feel right.‚Äù

I nodded. I gave her a new room key for a room on the 3rd floor and watched as she hurried away, glancing over her shoulder one last time before disappearing into the hallway. I stood there for a moment, gripping the edge of the desk. I wasn‚Äôt imagining things. There was something about the 6th floor, something that reached beyond the confines of its walls and affected the other floors. I could feel it in the way the air grew colder when the floor returned, the way the guests seemed unsettled without even knowing why.

The next night, another guest approached the desk. A businessman this time, staying on the 7th floor. His suit was wrinkled, and there were dark circles under his eyes, as though he hadn‚Äôt slept in days.

‚ÄúI need to check out,‚Äù he said bluntly, tossing his room key onto the desk. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something wrong with this place.‚Äù

I stared at him, trying to keep my voice steady. ‚ÄúWhat happened, sir?‚Äù

‚ÄúI lost hours,‚Äù he said, his voice flat, almost mechanical. ‚ÄúI went to bed around midnight. I woke up at 2 AM, a few moments later, when I checked my phone again, it was 8 AM. I don‚Äôt remember anything from those hours. It‚Äôs like they were erased.‚Äù

I frowned, I tried to hide my confusion as I spoke. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry for the inconvenience. I can-‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm leaving,‚Äù he interrupted, his voice tight with barely controlled fear. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to stay another night. There‚Äôs something wrong with this place.‚Äù

That night, after the last guest had left the lobby, I sat behind the front desk, staring at the empty computer screen. The complaints were piling up, people hearing strange noises, losing track of time, feeling watched in their own rooms. And all of them seemed to be tied to the nights when the 6th floor reappeared.

It didn‚Äôt make sense. How could a floor come and go like that?

I needed answers.

The next night, I couldn‚Äôt resist the pull of the 6th floor any longer. After the guests had gone to bed and the hotel was quiet, I found myself once again standing in front of the elevator. The button for the 6th floor had returned, glowing faintly as though inviting me back.

This time, I didn‚Äôt hesitate. I pressed the button, and the elevator doors slid shut, the familiar hum filling the air. As I ascended, my stomach twisted with dread. I didn‚Äôt know what I expected to find, but I couldn‚Äôt ignore the growing sense of urgency building inside me.

The elevator stopped, and the doors opened with a soft chime. The hallway was just as I remembered, dark, cold, and suffocatingly quiet.

I took a deep breath and stepped into the hallway. I walked slowly, passing the darkened rooms, their doors slightly ajar as though they were waiting for someone to enter.

And then I saw it.

Another message, scrawled in red across the mirror in one of the rooms.

""You‚Äôre next.""

Who could have written it? Was it a guest playing some kind of sick prank, or was it something more sinister? The thought gnawed at me, making it hard to think clearly. I felt like I had stumbled onto something that wasn‚Äôt meant for me to see, something dangerous.

I had to get out of there.

I turned and hurried down the hallway, the oppressive silence pressing in on me from all sides.

As I reached the end of the hallway, something caught my eye.

There, just ahead, was a group of hotel staff, three or four of them, standing at the far end of the corridor. For a moment, I felt a wave of relief. Maybe I wasn‚Äôt alone after all. 

But as I took a few steps closer, I realized something was terribly wrong.

They were dressed in uniforms that were clearly from another era, bellhops in red jackets with brass buttons, maids in old-fashioned black-and-white attire, and a front desk clerk in a stiff, high-collared suit. They stood perfectly still, their backs to me, as if they were waiting for something.

I opened my mouth to call out, but the words died in my throat.

Their movements were strange, unnatural. The way they shifted their weight from one foot to the other, the slight tilts of their heads, it was stiff and robotic A chill ran down my spine.

Something wasn‚Äôt right. These weren‚Äôt regular staff members.

I watched in growing horror as one by one, they began to turn around, their movements jerky and mechanical. I took a step back. When they finally faced me, my blood ran cold.

Their faces were blank.

No eyes. No mouths. Just smooth, featureless skin where their faces should have been. They stood there, expressionless, if you could even call it that, staring at me with those empty, non-existent faces. The air around me grew colder, and the oppressive weight of the floor seemed to press down on my chest, making it hard to breathe.

I stumbled backward, my mind racing. I needed to get away from them, but my feet felt heavy, like I was wading through thick, invisible mud. The staff didn‚Äôt move, but I could feel their presence pulling at me, drawing me in like the 6th floor had been doing for days.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I croaked, my voice shaking.

No response. The blank-faced staff stood perfectly still, their heads slightly tilted, as if waiting for something. Then, without warning, they turned in unison and began to walk toward one of the rooms, room 616. The door swung open as they approached, and they filed inside, disappearing into the darkness.

Something inside me, a morbid curiosity or maybe a deep-seated fear, compelled me to follow them.

I stepped toward room 616, my legs trembling. When I reached the doorway, I hesitated. The room beyond was dark. I could hear a faint whispering sound coming from within, but I couldn‚Äôt make out the words.

Slowly, I pushed the door open.

Inside, the room was empty.

No staff. No furniture. Just an empty, silent room.

But there, lying on the bed, was a single note.

My hands shook as I picked it up. The paper was old, yellowed with age, and the handwriting was smudged and uneven. I held it up to the dim light coming through the window and read the words:

""We‚Äôre still working.""

I backed out of the room, I had seen enough. I didn‚Äôt care what Sarah or Ben said anymore. Something was horribly wrong with this hotel, and it centered around the 6th floor. The staff I had seen weren‚Äôt real, or at least, not anymore. They were like echoes of the past.

I needed to leave. 

I bolted for the elevator, my footsteps echoing through the empty hallway. But when I reached the doors and pressed the button, nothing happened. The elevator stayed on another floor, unmoving. The button for the 6th floor was no longer illuminated.

A sense of panic began to rise in my chest as I turned toward the stairwell. I pushed open the door, expecting to find my way down to the lobby, but what I saw stopped me in my tracks.

The stairwell was gone.

In its place was another hallway, just like the one I had just come from. The same flickering lights, the same thick carpet, the same oppressive silence. My pulse quickened, and I backed away, turning to look behind me. But the hallway I had just come from had changed too. It stretched endlessly in both directions, as if I had been transported to some other part of the hotel that shouldn‚Äôt exist.

I was trapped.

I tried to stay calm, tried to reason with myself. This was just a trick of the mind, a hallucination brought on by stress and fatigue. 

I started walking, hoping that if I kept moving, I would find a way out. But no matter how far I walked, the hallway stretched on endlessly. The exit signs at the far end of the corridor flickered in and out of sight, always just out of reach. It was as if the building itself was toying with me, keeping me trapped in this nightmarish loop.

Finally, after what felt like hours of walking, I saw it, a door marked STAFF ONLY.

I didn‚Äôt hesitate. I rushed toward it, and twisted the handle.

The door swung open, and I stumbled through it, expecting to find myself back in the stairwell or the lobby.

But instead, I found myself standing in front of the front desk.

I blinked, disoriented.

Had I imagined it all? The phantom staff, the endless hallways, the message on the mirror. It all seemed so distant now, like a half-remembered dream.

But as I glanced at the security monitors, I saw something.

The cameras for the 6th floor flickered briefly, and for a split second, I saw them, the staff, standing perfectly still in the hallway, their blank faces turned toward the camera, as if they were watching me.

I backed away from the monitor, my hands trembling.

This wasn‚Äôt over. 

I couldn‚Äôt sleep after that night. Even when my shift was over, I couldn‚Äôt shake the images from my mind: the blank faces of the phantom staff, the endless hallway, the ominous message scrawled on the mirror. I found myself avoiding the mirrors in my own apartment, too. Whenever I glanced at one, I would catch a flicker of something, shadows that shouldn‚Äôt be there, movements that didn‚Äôt belong to me. It was as if the 6th floor was creeping into my life, even when I wasn‚Äôt at the hotel.

The nightmares didn‚Äôt help either. Every night, I dreamt of being trapped in the hotel, lost in that labyrinthine hallway that never seemed to end. In my dreams, I was always running from something I couldn‚Äôt see but could feel lurking just behind me, waiting for me to slow down, waiting to catch me. Each time, I would wake up in a cold sweat, the sense of dread lingering long after the dream faded.

A few nights later, I was back at the front desk. The hotel was quiet as usual, the guests long since retired to their rooms. I had been watching the security monitors closely, especially the ones for the 6th floor. Tonight, the floor was listed in the system again, but the cameras showed nothing out of the ordinary, just an empty hallway, the lights flickering occasionally.

Around 2 AM, the phone rang.

I stared at it for a moment, my stomach twisting with dread. Every time the phone rang now, I couldn‚Äôt help but feel a sense of foreboding, as if each call was pulling me deeper into whatever dark force was haunting the 6th floor.

I picked up the receiver, trying to keep my voice steady. ‚ÄúFront desk, this is Mark.‚Äù

There was a pause, followed by a low, crackling static. Then, through the static, I heard a voice, distorted, faint, but unmistakably human.

‚Äú...Room 621...‚Äù

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I said into the phone, my voice betraying the growing unease in my chest. ‚ÄúCan you repeat that?‚Äù

There was no response. Just static.

I hung up the phone, my mind racing. Was someone playing a sick joke on me? I knew I couldn‚Äôt just ignore it. I grabbed my keycard and headed toward the elevator, my hands trembling slightly as I pressed the button for the 6th floor.

When the doors slid open, I stepped out into the now-familiar hallway.

I walked down the hall, counting the numbers on the doors as I went. 619, 620, 621. I stopped in front of the door. 

I swiped my keycard, the lock clicking softly as the door swung open.

The room was dark. I reached for the light switch, but nothing happened. The bulb must have burned out. I stepped inside, the door closing softly behind me. The room felt colder than the rest of the hotel.

As I moved further into the room, I noticed something strange. There were no mirrors. Not on the walls, not in the bathroom, nothing. Every reflective surface had been removed.

A sense of dread washed over me as I realized how unusual that was. I had worked at this hotel for two years, and every room had a standard set of mirrors: one above the sink in the bathroom, a full-length mirror by the closet, and sometimes even smaller ones on the dresser. But here, there was nothing.

I swallowed hard, backing toward the door, my eyes scanning the room for any sign of movement. That‚Äôs when I saw it, reflected in the glossy black surface of the television screen.

A shadow.

It stood behind me, tall and dark, its form barely distinguishable from the surrounding gloom. My heart pounded in my chest as I stared at the screen, unable to tear my gaze away. The figure didn‚Äôt move, didn‚Äôt make a sound, but I could feel its presence. It was watching me.

I spun around, but the room was empty. Nothing. 

I backed toward the door, my hands shaking as I fumbled for the handle. I needed to get out of there.

I yanked on the handle, but it was as if the door had vanished into the wall. There was no escape. I was trapped.

Panic set in as I turned toward the window, hoping to find some other way out, but the windows were sealed shut. I couldn‚Äôt even see the city lights beyond, just an endless expanse of darkness pressing against the glass.

I tried my phone, but the screen was black, unresponsive. My radio, too, emitted nothing but static. I was completely cut off.

The air in the room grew colder, and I could feel the presence of something unseen watching me. It was as if the walls themselves were alive, closing in on me, suffocating me. I stumbled back to the center of the room, my mind racing with fear and confusion.

Then, without warning, I heard it, a soft knock, coming from inside the room.

The knock came again, as if someone was trying to get my attention.

I turned slowly, my eyes scanning the room, but there was no one there. Just shadows.

The knock came again, but this time it was right behind me.

I spun around, my heart pounding in my chest, but once again, the room was empty. The walls seemed to pulse with a life of their own, the shadows shifting and writhing in the dim light.

And then, the room fell silent, the oppressive weight of the air pressing down on me like a vice.

I didn‚Äôt know how long I stood there, frozen in place. But then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw the door.

It had reappeared.

I didn‚Äôt waste any time. I rushed toward it, yanking it open. I stumbled out into the hallway, gasping for breath, my heart still racing from the terror of what I had just experienced.

Something was wrong with this place, and I had a sinking feeling that I was getting closer to the truth. A truth I wasn‚Äôt sure I wanted to uncover.

I hurried down the hallway, refusing to glance over my shoulder, convinced that the shadows were moving, twisting, watching me.

When I reached the elevator, I pressed the button frantically. The lights above flickered, and for a moment, I thought it wouldn‚Äôt come. The soft hum of the machinery finally filled the silence, and the doors opened with a smooth chime. I stepped inside, my heart racing, and pressed the button for the lobby.

Back at the front desk, I sat down heavily, my hands shaking. My mind was racing, replaying everything that had happened over the past few weeks.

It didn‚Äôt feel real. But I knew it was.

I needed answers.

I logged into the hotel‚Äôs old archive system, an outdated collection of files, reports, and blueprints that no one had bothered with in years. The information I was looking for had to be buried here somewhere.

It took me nearly an hour of scrolling through irrelevant documents before I found something: an old incident report from the early 1970s, simply titled ‚ÄúClosure of the 6th Floor.‚Äù I opened the file. The report was brief, the details vague, but it told me enough.

According to the document, the 6th floor had been permanently closed after a series of unexplained deaths. Guests who checked in on that floor were found dead under mysterious circumstances, heart attacks, or cases where there was no apparent cause of death at all. One chilling account described a guest who was found standing in the middle of their room, eyes wide open, completely frozen. The floor was supposed to have been sealed off decades ago, but something had gone horribly wrong.

The hotel management at the time had quietly shut it down, hiding the deaths from the public. But the 6th floor hadn‚Äôt stayed closed. Every few decades, it reappeared, drawing in new guests.

My heart pounded at the realisation that this was happening again, and it was happening for weeks now.

The phone buzzed, jolting me out of my thoughts. It was Sarah, the head of housekeeping.

‚ÄúMark, where are you?‚Äù she asked, her voice sounding distant, almost distorted. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm on the 5th floor. I thought I saw someone wandering around, but when I got there, the floor was empty.‚Äù

I hesitated, unsure if I should tell her about everything I had discovered. But she had always brushed off my concerns, always telling me that it was just an old building acting up. Would she even believe me?

‚ÄúI... I‚Äôm at the desk. Stay away from the 6th floor, Sarah. There‚Äôs something wrong with it. I‚Äôve been getting calls, and‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs more to it than you think.‚Äù

There was silence on the other end, but I could hear her breathing, quick and shallow.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been hearing things too,‚Äù she said after a long pause. ‚ÄúVoices, footsteps. I thought it was just in my head, but... you‚Äôre telling me it‚Äôs real?‚Äù

‚ÄúMore real than I want to admit,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúYou need to get out of here, Sarah. Whatever‚Äôs happening on that floor, it‚Äôs not safe.‚Äù

Sarah didn‚Äôt respond. There was a soft click, and the line went dead.

The rest of my shift passed in a blur of anxious pacing and stolen glances at the security monitors. Every time the camera feed flickered, I felt my stomach lurch, half-expecting to see those blank-faced staff members again, waiting for me.

It wasn‚Äôt until just before dawn, as I was preparing to hand over the shift to the day staff, that something strange happened. The elevator doors opened with a soft chime, and I watched as a group of guests stepped out, chatting softly amongst themselves.

They were all wearing clothes from another era. Suits from the 1970s, dresses with high collars and lace. And their faces, pale, expressionless. Their eyes didn‚Äôt meet mine as they crossed the lobby and exited the hotel, disappearing into the early morning light.

I stood frozen behind the desk, my mind struggling to process what I had just seen. It was as if the hotel‚Äôs past was bleeding into the present, the ghosts of those trapped on the 6th floor spilling out into the world beyond.

I couldn‚Äôt stay at The Arlington after that. I handed in my resignation that morning, packed up my things, and left the hotel. But even now, weeks later, the memories of the 6th floor still haunt me.

I still see the figures in my dreams, blank-faced staff members, shadowy figures standing at the foot of my bed. I still hear the soft, distant knock coming from inside the walls. And every now and then, when I glance into a mirror, I see something else looking back at me, something that doesn‚Äôt belong.

I try to tell myself it‚Äôs all in my head, but I know the truth.

The 6th floor is [still there.](https://www.reddit.com/user/CreepyStoriesJR/comments/1ilh8mp/creepystoriesjr_story_list/)

1ipjqc8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ipjqc8/i_24f_used_to_lie_when_i_was_little_and_they/,I (24F) used to lie when I was little and they still hate me.,"When I was little, I used to lie about anything and everything. Now that I am older, I realized how much I went through and how certain things had a huge impact. In 4th grade to middle school, looking back now, I realized I craved attention and validation from boys. I was abused when I was 9yo by my ex-best friend's mom's boyfriend. Growing up, I remember having uncles' make comments about my legs and telling my mom ""I bet you $1,000 she will be pregnant by 14"". I was sexualized a lot. I was raised by my mom and my aunt, I don't remember my dad leaving, but I do remember he would promise to take me places and I would wait; he would never come.

In middle school, I felt the need to lie about stupid things like ""my dad could surf"", ""I know how to snowboard"", ""my grandma died and I can't hang out"". Anyway, middle school was horrible. I was jumped twice in one day for the sole reason that I happen to have a crush on a boy another girl did too and my best friend decided she wanted to as well. After that, this group of girls would taunt me all the time. After 7th grade forward, I kept to myself, I struggled with an E.D. and I would get calls or text messages threatening me or telling me I was ugly. High school came around and I never saw them again, but I would get mysterious messages sending me links to old videos of me or messages saying they were following me.

When I was 18yo, it was my first day of college and I saw them in a big group on campus and I panicked. I dropped out, had horrible anxiety, and I got a weird call from one of them. I knew it was one of them because I saved that number and on Whatsapp it showed their name and pfp.

I was 22yo and I happen to be on Bumble (I am bi), and I see one of those girls profile. She used to be my friend and we had a falling out. Honestly, I swear, I do not remember much of my childhood to tween years. Anyway, I had the subscription so I saw she swiped right on me so I decided to do the same. We had a very polite, short, formal conversation, but something felt off so I just immediately ghosted her. A year later, my best friend showed me that she posted on her SC a picture of me when I was 13 saying ""I hated this bitch, this is why I didn't give a f\*ck when she said her grandma died."" My heart was racing and I felt like that scared girl again. I was confused because why would she match with me then turns out she hated my guts.

My childhood best friend, she always calls me a liar and reminds me of things I used to do or say that I am so ashamed of. I went to a coffee shop with my boyfriend a few months ago and I recognized one of the girls who threaten to ""k\*ll"" me and beat me up. I tried my best to play it off like I was fine, but my boyfriend somehow picked up on it. He kept asking if I was okay, I just told him that she was one of the girls. She was making our coffee and I knew she knew who I was, but I decided to be brave and go up there to get our coffees. I smiled politely and thanked her, walking away. My boyfriend tried to be funny and say, ""well she's making your coffee."" I just said I felt bad thinking that way.

I am not sure why I get emotional writing this, but I feel like a bad person. I don't know why I lied or why a little over a decade later they hate me so much/still talk about me. I am not that 12-15yo; I am not sure why this still affects me.

  
Edit: sorry, i just want advice on how do I get over this? I am so tired of being that scared little girl. What do i do? I‚Äôm older now but they always creep back to bother. ",2,1739563866.0,Advice,4,0.75,False

It's not fun because I know my mind is just slipping and I just start panicking.

To clarify this stuff does happen sometimes w/o coffee but rarely and it's a lot less noticeable. With coffee it feels like the entire universe is spiraling around in circles whispering forbidden knowledge to me.

The problem is, I really need caffeine to be properly awake and productive. I do drink tea with a minimal amount of caffeine but it's not really enough. Does anyone have any safe alternatives to coffee that won't cause anything like that to happen?",4,1739563859.0,Psychosis,7,1.0,False
