1lgnnmu,https://i.redd.it/n8iy0azzg78f1.jpeg,"I wrote this after seeing Mount Eerie live on February 20 in Tucson, Az.","It was late October 2017. I was walking between unnaturally planted trees in an artificial lake full of ducks and algae, reading Walt Whitman’s poems and learning the mathematics behind physics. That was when I first listened to The Glow, Pt. 2.
Back then, English was far from being my second language—I could barely understand the lyrics without looking them up—but something about that album felt profound. Almost three years later, locked inside my house as a pandemic threatened those I love, I begged the sky for something to challenge my foundations. And then it happened—I faced death and grief for the first time.
I returned to Leaves of Grass, pairing it with Mark Fisher’s ideas on loneliness, isolation, depression, and music. In late 2020, I found myself alone again, headphones on, diving into Phil Elverum’s discography. Then came an epiphany: The Glow—and Phil’s voice—felt like an apologetic, tragic prediction. Time, and life itself, is just a wind blowing against my gravity-degraded face—disappearing and returning unpredictably.
As I connected ideas, poetry, music, and physics, I forged a bond with Phil Elverum’s creative mind. I didn’t quite understand why.
And that brings me to the present.
Last Thursday, I drove with my father to Tucson, AZ, for a Mount Eerie concert. After four hours through the hot desert, we arrived to the strong scent of freshly brewed coffee. The venue was small, almost sketchy. My father pointed at the merchandise table: “Oh, there is the elephant.”
We poured coffee, waiting for someone to take my money for the album. Five minutes later, he emerged from the forming crowd—wearing a vibrant green t-shirt and white carpenter Dickies. The human version of the voice in my headphones.
I handed over two twenty-dollar bills for two vinyl records in a cardboard sleeve with an elephant on the cover. He looked me in the eye, gave me ten dollars back, and our hands subtly touched. With a mellow, humorous voice, he said, “Thank you.” I replied, “No, thank you,” emphasizing my gratitude.

And then—another epiphany: we all are humans.

1lgnkyt,https://www.reddit.com/r/TWEWY/comments/1lgnkyt/twewy_drink_ideas/,TWEWY Drink Ideas 🍹,"So I like to make drinks on the side, especially based off of stuff I really like and am obsessed with.
Even though I'm trying to think of drinks based off of Ado's songs, I'm going to take a small break from that for now and work on drinks for *TWEWY* characters, most of them at least.
There will be both alcoholic and non-alcoholic options, so people of all ages can enjoy them, including those who don't like alcohol.


Let's start with my beautiful son Neku.

_Neku_: 
I feel like anything sour, citrusy, with a punch — mellow underneath — would fit him. So maybe a yuzu lemonade with a hint of blueberry syrup mostly for the color. If you want to make it alcoholic, then I would add either gin or vodka.


_Shiki_: 
For my best girl, I feel like a sweet, gentle, comforting drink — a hint of tartness underneath would be good for her.
So a strawberry rose milk tea with lychee jelly, I think, would be fitting.
If you want to add alcohol, just add strawberry liqueur or elderflower vodka.


_Beat_: 
For my best boy, a bold, tropical, and energetic drink with a sweet finish would be absolutely perfect. A pineapple-coconut slushie with a splash of mango, I think, would suit him very well. Just add dark rum or coconut rum if you want to add alcohol.


_Rhyme_: 
My beautiful girl deserves a drink that's light, refreshing, and nostalgic.
A sparkling white grape juice with mint and a hint of vanilla would be nice.
Just add white wine or vanilla vodka if you want it to add alcohol.


_Joshua_: 
For my other beautiful son. An elegant, mysterious, slightly tart, and refined drink.
A lavender lemonade with white peach and a twist of pomegranate, I think, would suit him heavenly.
Add champagne or peach schnapps for an alcoholic version.


_Sanae Hanekoma_: 
I had to add my number one favorite character to this list. It's just a given at this point.
For him, he deserves a drink that is smooth, bold, and layered, with notes of coffee, spice, and something a little unexpected.
Cold brew coffee or chicory coffee for less caffeine.
Add a shot of spiced rum, coffee liqueur, or bourbon if you want to make it alcoholic.


These are just some ideas for drinks, and I'd love to hear what you think of them and if you have any ideas for other characters. I also might do the reapers as well, but it honestly depends.
I hope you enjoyed these little ideas. 💚",1,1750478806.0,TWEWY,0,1.0,False
1lgnjg4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1lgnjg4/why_does_a_clean_room_make_me_anxious/,Why does a clean room make me anxious?,"So, my religious mother has been begging me to clean my room to “not attrack bad omens”, but everytime I have to explain to her how a neat room makes me anxious and I’m more comfortable in the chaos.

My room isn’t even that messy. I never keep food or unclean plates and always brings those to the kitchen. Only dish I keep is an empty coffee mug. Besides that, it’s mostly a bunch of pens/post-its and random stuff laying on my desk, plus a fat pile of clothes on not one but two chairs…

Now, if I decide to clean all of it, I become uncomfortable and uneasy. I somehow start feeling cold and itchy. I can’t explain it. It’s like sitting in a waiting room with overhead lights, waiting for something to happen, but having no idea what. Weird part is I only have a lamp and my walls aren’t even white so I can’t understand why it gives me this feeling.

Chaos makes me more cozy, even when I visit other peoples homes and random stuff is laying in their living room, I feel more welcomed  and at eaze.

My mother is a self proclaimed minimalist so it definitely reinforces her wishes, I just wonder if anybody else can relate to this? It feels wrong and dumb, and I can understand why cleanliness is better, but I’d rather have the slight mess than a clean slate…

1lgnjem,https://i.redd.it/ahgv8j5rf78f1.jpeg,Linl plzz - Bride of the Billionaire Beast,"Alexandra smiled as she warmly greeted all the guests at her wedding. There were more than five hundred people, almost all of them celebrities or major players in the global chocolate industry. And in her own way, Alexandra Kingsley was a celebrity too.
 
She was a wealthy heiress from California, and despite losing her parents at the age of fourteen, she had grown into a strong, hardworking woman. At twenty-two, she was successfully running her family's company and had just married the man she loved.
 
She had everything. Her life was perfect. But as she went looking for her husband, Albert Blackwell, she had no idea how fast that happiness was about to crumble.
 
Alexandra searched throughout the mansion, but she froze in place when she passed by her cousin Claudia's room. Inside, she could hear the unmistakable moans. Then, all of a sudden, Claudia said a name that knocked the air out of her lungs, ""Albert! Yes! Don't stop… More! More! Yes! Ahhh!!! Oh Albert…""
 
It felt like she'd been shot straight in the stomach. Every sound coming from that room was obscene. She couldn't believe Albert had been cheating on her—with her own cousin Claudia—and on their wedding day, no less.
 
She had to get out of there, but her body wouldn't move. She was frozen in place, paralyzed by pain. Claudia was the person she trusted most after her husband, and both of them had betrayed her in the worst possible way.
 
She didn't know if she should confront them or run, but then Claudia's shaky voice stopped her in her tracks.
 
""Have you decided what you're going to do about Alexandra?"" she asked after their dramatic finish.
 
""There's not much to decide, we already talked about this—Alexandra has to disappear,"" Albert said, and it felt like someone was ripping her heart out.
 
""Are you sure that guy's offer is solid?"" Claudia pressed. Despite the tears streaming down her cheeks, Alexandra leaned in, as if she needed to understand why they were doing this to her.
 
""Yeah, there's no turning back now. And Scott Hamilton isn't just some guy, he's the guy. The biggest tech mogul in Europe, and he's expanding. He made me an offer I can't refuse,"" Albert said. ""A partnership. It's a ton of money—easy money. But I need to put up a big initial investment…""
 
""You know Alexandra won't give it to you,"" Claudia sneered. ""She loves being the CEO, the rich one, the powerful one. She'll never let you grow. She just wants to keep you as her pet, show you off, but she'll never let you be more powerful than her. So I guess you've already made your decision.""
 
Alexandra's heart sank. And before Albert even opened his mouth again, she already knew what he was planning.
 
""That's exactly why she has to die,"" Albert hissed through clenched teeth. ""I need to be a widower as soon as possible!""
 
""And how are you going to do it?"" Claudia asked, full of sick curiosity.
 
""She'll get a call soon about a problem at the factory. I arranged that. And she won't ignore it, not even today—it's our wedding, but she won't miss it, I know her. So I cut the brakes on her car. That Luxury car going to be her end.""
 
""Perfect. That way, Alexandra will be out of our lives for good,"" Claudia laughed. ""Then all you have to do is inherit everything and close the deal with Mr. Hamilton. We're finally going to have everything we ever wanted—power, money, and a problem-free life!""
 
Alexandra dropped to her knees, covering her mouth to keep from screaming. Her husband-to-be was planning to send her to her death. She couldn't believe he'd been with another woman, much less that he was planning to kill her.
 
But he was.
 
""Hey, are you sure she's really going to die?"" Claudia asked suddenly.
 
""Absolutely sure! And if your cousin doesn't die this time, I'll find another way to ki-ll her. But I swear, she won't make it past this week!""
 
Slowly, Alexandra regained feeling in her legs and walked to her bedroom, where she collapsed onto the bed, sobbing. She couldn't believe what she had just heard. How could Albert do something like this to her? And Claudia? The cousin she trusted the most…
 
The room spun around her. She needed to get out of there. But just a few minutes later, someone knocked on her door—her uncle Milton stepped inside.
 
""Sweetheart, they just called—there's an urgent issue at the factory…"" He stopped when he saw her tear-streaked face. ""Are you okay?""
 
Before Alexandra could answer, Albert, Claudia, and her aunt Leticia walked in too.
 
""Alex, what's wrong?"" her husband asked, faking concern so well it made her stomach turn.
 
Alexandra looked at them all, but after what she'd just overheard, she couldn't trust anyone. What if her aunt and uncle were in on it too? After all, they were Claudia's parents.
 
""It's nothing, I was just… thinking about my parents. I miss them a lot on a day like today,"" she lied, stepping away from them. ""What's going on at the factory?""
 
""Seems like some animal got in and fell into one of the chocolate tanks,"" her uncle explained.
 
""Each of those tanks costs twenty thousand money!"" Claudia gasped. ""How could they be so careless?! What a bunch of useless idiots!""
 
""Alright, enough. What we need is to fix the problem,"" Albert cut her off, turning to Alexandra. ""You're going to the factory, right?""
 
Alexandra stared at her husband for a long moment.
 
""Are you coming with me?"" she asked.
 
He shook his head with the fakest smile she'd ever seen.
 
""I shouldn't, Alex. Someone has to stay and entertain the guests. It wouldn't be right for both bride and groom to disappear,"" he replied, and her hands began to tremble.
 
She could confront him, but his words echoed in her mind: ""If yourcousin doesn't die this time, I'll find another way to ki-ll her.""
 
Albert, the man she loved, was determined to end her life.
 
Without another word, she walked out of the room and didn't stop until she reached the mansion's parking lot.
 
""Take this one,"" Albert said, tossing her the keys to the car.
 
Alexandra caught them with a shiver and climbed into the car, driving off the estate immediately.
 
She cried uncontrollably as she drove, going as slow as she could. Her mind drifted back to the day she had met Albert. It had been at a party—she was twenty, he was twenty-eight. Albert was a friend of Claudia's and worked as a lawyer at her uncle Milton's firm. It had been her aunt Leticia who introduced them, practically pushing them together, saying they were meant to be.
 
How had she ended up in this situation? How had she been so fool to believe these people actually cared about her?
 
Tears streamed down her cheeks as she looked at the winding road ahead. Her life was in danger, but she had no way out of so much cruelty. Her heart was shattered, and she felt like she was drowning. So she did something she never thought she would do:
 
She slammed her foot down on the gas and aimed straight for the next curve.
 
Albert couldn't kill her if she did it first.
 
The car hit the turn too fast and flew off the road. Everything around Alexandra moved in slow motion. The car flipped through the air, then sailed over the edge of a cliff. It crashed 50 feet below, crumpling completely before the gas tank exploded in a massive fireball.
 
As the flames consumed everything, Alexandra's final thoughts were of her family—and of Albert, the man she had loved, and the one who had destroyed her.
 
An hour later, a police patrol arrived at the crash site. There were no survivors from the wreck, and after identifying the car license plate, they drove to the Kingsley estate to inform Albert that Alexandra was dead. Sadly, nothing of her body had been recovered from the explosion.
 
Five hundred wedding guests watched Albert cry, curse, and writhe in agony over the death of his beloved wife—and they cried with him. None of them suspected that killing Alexandra Kingsley had been his idea all along. All because he wanted to steal her inheritance and build his own empire.
 
But what Albert Blackwell never imagined was that Alexandra Kingsley wasn't the kind of woman who forgave.
 
Not in this life, and not in the next.
 

Chapter 2 A Woman Out for Revenge
One year later.

Alexia Hartley was a beautiful woman, and she knew it. But more than that, she was determined, strong, and ready to tear down anything in her path. For one simple reason: she had lost everything, and she was here to take it all back.
 
That's why she'd spent the past year preparing—carefully weaving every thread needed to land her position as a financial analyst at Hamilton Holding Enterprise, better known as HHE. It was the most powerful tech company in the world, and its owner was the only man Alexia cared about: Scott Hamilton.
 
Mr. Hamilton was elusive to the point of obsession. He had successfully hidden his face from the media and scrubbed every personal photo and article about him off the internet. Still, everyone who knew him agreed on one thing: he was ruthless, fierce, terrifying…
 
And Alexia had come to win him over.
 
She drove her modest Honda SUV through the heart of New York, heading to the HHE headquarters. It was her first day, and she was ready to make a strong impression. But, because life never liked to make things easy for her, of course there was always an idiot ready to mess up her day.
 
She was just about to slide into one of the two last open parking spots near the elevator when a red cari whipped past her without a care—and parked smack in the middle of both spaces.
 
Alexia clenched her jaw and got out of the car.
 
""Excuse me, would you mind parking properly, please?"" she asked as politely as she could.
 
A tall man stepped out of the Luxury car. Blue eyes, perfect physique under a custom-tailored designer suit, and handsome like a Greek god. He looked Alexia up and down, and his nose made a small snort, like a predator sizing up its prey.
 
""There are more spaces at the back,"" he snapped. ""Now get out of my sight.""
 
""The back is 984 feet away!"" Alexia growled, boiling with rage. ""I'm not walking that far and showing up on my first day of work all sweaty just because you don't know how to park in one  space!""
 
The Greek god raised his eyebrows, like he couldn't believe some mere mortal had dared to challenge him.
 
""Are you crazy, or just pretending? Do you even know who you're talking to?"" he hissed, stepping closer. ""This car costs twenty times more than your Honda. Do you really think I'd let you park next to it? Please. This is a—""
 
""The car 488 GBT, V8 engine, 3902 cc displacement, 670 horsepower at 8000 rpm. Goes from 0 to 200 km in 8.3 seconds, and clocks a lap time at Fiorano in one minute, twenty-three seconds,"" Alexia interrupted, staring him down. Then she looked at the car. ""It's nice, but way too flashy. Doesn't suit a magnate. And you? You definitely don't suit it either.""
 
The man looked like he was about to explode.
 
""You—!""
 
""If you were half as impressive as you think you are, pretty boy, you'd have bought a car with real balls,"" she shot back, full of sarcasm. ""V12 engine. 800 horsepower at 8500 rpm. 0 to 100 in 2.9 seconds… about as fast as a pretty boy like you finishes. An 812 Superfast.""
 
""That model isn't even on sale yet!"" he barked, completely losing his patience.
 
""Exactly,"" she replied, flashing a victorious smile.
 
Alexia smiled wider as she saw his cool expression twist into pure hate in a single second. Sure, she'd have to walk those 984 feet—but that smug  would never look down on her again.
 
She strutted back to her Honda, flipping him the finger as she drove off to find another space.
 
Twenty minutes later, she wiped the sweat from her forehead and stepped into the office assigned to her.
 
Apparently, this company didn't think much of analysts. Her office was large but dark and cold. Her desk already had over thirty folders piled on it, and her supervisor, Mr. Garrick, pointed out where to start.
 
""When will I get to meet Mr. Hamilton?"" she asked.
 
""If you value your mental health, hopefully never,"" the man replied, and Alexia grimaced.
 
She tied her hair back into a ponytail and dove straight into her work. For nine straight hours, she didn't budge—until her phone rang.
 
""Are you okay, Alexandra?"" came Howard's worried voice.
 
""Alexia. Remember, it's Alexia now,"" she scolded him. ""You've had a whole year to get used to it, sweetie. You can't call me Alexandra anymore!""
 
""I know, I know. I just freaked out when I got home and you weren't there. Are you okay?""
 
""I'm fine, just still working,"" she said. ""My supervisor thinks I'm clueless. He gave me some investment portfolios to review that he should've checked himself. But that's a good thing. I think I found something interesting… something that'll get me in front of Scott Hamilton by noon tomorrow.""
 
There was a long, tired sigh on the other end of the line.
 
""Are you sure you want to go through with this, Alexan—Alexia?""
 
""Of course I do! Albert and Claudia tried to kill me, Howard! I'd be dead if I hadn't done what I did—and if you hadn't found me!"" she hissed, her voice trembling with fury. ""I'm going to make them pay for what they did. But to do that, I need the power of the one man who can stand up to Albert Blackwell. The one man he's truly afraid of. And that's Scott Hamilton. I'm going to earn that man's support, Howard—even if it's the last thing I do.""

Chapter 3 You!
And because there's nothing stronger than the will of a woman hell-bent on revenge, Alexia took the files home, barely slept, and when the sun started to rise, the error finally revealed itself to her.
 
""Someone's stealing from him,"" Alexia grinned, rushing to make coffee just as Howard stumbled out of his room, half asleep.
 
""What's going on? Why are you screaming like a cat in heat?"" he grumbled.
 
""Someone's stealing from Scott Hamilton!"" Alexia exclaimed, full of excitement. ""No one's untouchable in this world—and someone's robbing the ogre! That means I've got my way in!""
 
But Alexia would soon realize her excitement was a bit premature. As soon as she told Mr. Garrick she'd found something off in the numbers, her supervisor snatched the documents from her without even asking where the problem was.
 
""I should be speaking directly with Mr. Hamilton about this!"" she declared, unaware of Garrick's true intentions.
 
""This is way above your pay grade, Miss Hartley,"" the man snapped nervously. ""I'll review the numbers myself.""
 
""But—""
 
""No buts! I'll write the report,"" he barked, storming out and slamming the door.
 
Alexia immediately became suspicious. Luckily, she had copies of everything. She went over the documents again and confirmed it—this investment was a scam. So by noon, she marched straight to her supervisor's office in heels loud enough to warn the entire floor.
 
""Did you review the numbers? Is the report done?"" she asked bluntly.
 
""Yes, everything's fine now,"" the man replied, clearly avoiding her gaze.
 
""And did you find the problem?"" she pressed.
 
""No, I didn't find any problem,"" he repeated, trying to sound firm—but his voice trembled. ""You just made a mistake. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to leave.""
 
""Mr. Garrick,"" Alexia raised her brows with bold confidence, ""I didn't make a mistake. That contract is an attempt to defraud this company. If I could spot it, just a lowly analyst, how could you miss it?""
 
""Exactly!"" he snapped. ""You're just an analyst—and I'm your boss—""
 
""Well, clearly, that's mistake number one,"" Alexia hissed. ""And if you won't tell Mr. Hamilton he's being conned, then I will.""
 
""You can't do that, Miss Hartley. That's my job—""
 
""Then do it! What's stopping you? Why are you so afraid to tell the truth to the man who signs your paycheck?"" she challenged, voice dripping with disdain.
 
""I told you, this is above your level. Back off or you're fired!"" Garrick shouted, red with rage.
 
""You're going to fire me for doing my job?"" she fired back. ""Let's see if Mr. Hamilton agrees with that.""
 
Without another word, Alexia snatched the folder from his hands and ran straight to the elevator. The CEO's office was on the top floor, and she was ready to make a scene if she had to. Nothing would get in the way of her path to Scott Hamilton.
 
""Alexia!"" Garrick screamed from down the hall, but she didn't even glance back. ""You'll regret this! Come back here!""
 
She ignored him and got in the elevator just in time to see Garrick running toward her.
 
""OHHH!"" she cursed, jumping out of the elevator and bolting up the stairs instead. She could hear Garrick coming after her. She looked up—still at least fifteen floors to go. ""Crap!""
 
She ran as fast as she could, not caring that her hair bun was falling apart, her clothes were drenched in sweat, or that the heel of her shoe snapped. At some point, she stopped hearing Garrick's yelling behind her, but she didn't slow down.
 
Fifteen floors later, looking like a hurricane on legs, she burst out of the stairwell—only to find the idiot waiting for her.
 
""Alexia!"" Garrick shouted when he saw her headed straight for the CEO's office. ""What do you think you're doing?!""
 
""Nothing! I was told to prepare a report, and that's exactly what I'm here to deliver!"" she shot back without stopping.
 
""Stay out of this!"" Garrick growled, grabbing her arm—but Alexia kicked him hard in the shin.
 
 ""Let me go!"" she shouted, kicking off her ruined shoes and tossing them aside as he doubled over in pain. ""And get out of my way!""
 
Three more people came running after her as she shoved the CEO's office doors open without an invitation.
 
""I need to speak to Mr. Hamilton!"" she declared as she stepped inside—but the moment the only person in the room looked up, Alexia froze.
 
It was him. The Luxury car demigod. The one she'd flipped off and told him he finished in 2.9 seconds.
 
""You?!"" she gasped in horror.
 
""You!"" Scott Hamilton growled like he was ready to tear her apart.

Chapter 4 A Man Who Doesn't Tolerate Challenges
At that very moment, Alexia wanted the ground to swallow her whole. She'd come to this company to win over the CEO, and somehow, she had managed to offend him in the worst possible way. If she was lucky, he wouldn't throw her out on the spot, especially considering she'd just barged in fighting with her supervisor.
 
'OHHH,' she thought, just as Garrick rushed in behind her, pale with panic.
 
Scott Hamilton, however, looked like a bomb seconds from detonation. He rose slowly from behind his desk and gave Alexia a once-over. She was barefoot, disheveled, flushed and sweaty, with beads of perspiration trailing down her forehead and slipping between her breasts as she struggled to catch her breath from the stairs.
 
She looked every bit the wild woman she was—and the worst part was, Scott couldn't stop thinking about licking that sweat right off her skin. What was wrong with him?!
 
""What is going on here?"" he growled as she came to a halt in front of him. Garrick nearly shoved her aside to block her from view, and that only made Scott even angrier.
 
""Sir, I… well, the truth is…"" Garrick stammered, then suddenly blurted out, ""She disrespected me!""
 
""I can imagine,"" Scott muttered, eyeing Alexia. ""And since you're not the first to say that, I'm guessing it's just part of her charm.""
 
""Well, I only disrespect men who try to pull one over on me. Isn't that right, Mr. Garrick?"" Alexia hissed back.
 
Garrick turned crimson with rage, but before he could respond, Hamilton cut him off.
 
""Leave us. Now."" The words came out low and deadly.
 
One sharp look from Scott was enough to shut Garrick up and send him stomping out. Scott stepped out from behind his desk, hands in his pockets, and stopped just in front of her.
 
""If I'm not mistaken, yesterday was your first day,"" he said, voice like steel. ""Any woman with a functioning brain would know not to barge into her boss's office looking like that. Barefoot. Sweaty. A mess. And smelling like a cow-milker.""
 
Alexia's eyes widened, but if he thought she was going to take that without biting back, he had another thing coming.
 
""Well, if my supervisor hadn't gotten in my way, I wouldn't have had to run up fifteen floors barefoot just to warn you that someone's stealing from you!"" she snapped.
 
Scott looked down at the crumpled folder in her hand and let out a dry, sarcastic laugh.
 
""Let me guess. Garrick—who's been my head analyst for years—he's the one you think is lying?""
 
""And that should worry you,"" Alexia shot back. ""He chased me through the building trying to stop me from delivering this report. I'm not some clueless intern, Mr. Haaamilton,"" she drawled with biting sarcasm. ""Garrick says I made a mistake, but I didn't. I know when someone's committing fraud. And you're about to fall for one if you sign that contract.""
 
Scott clenched his fists and paced around her. He didn't know what it was about this woman. Maybe it was her fire. Maybe it was the ridiculous car knowledge. Or maybe it was just that she had the body of a fertility goddess and the stare of a Valkyrie—ready to ki-ll.
 
Either way, she was stirring up more inside him than he wanted to admit.
 
""If your supervisor says you made a mistake, then you made one,"" he said flatly. ""Now get out of my office before I—""
 
The folder slammed against his chest mid-sentence, papers flying into his face.
 
""Then I hope they rob you blind,"" she snapped. ""If you want to be a fool, that's your choice. One of your executives is siphoning money right under your nose, and you're too arrogant to even hear me out?""
 
She let out a bitter laugh. ""Wow. You're not nearly as impressive as you think you are.""
 
That last part? The sarcastic disappointment in her voice? That hit Scott harder than a slap.
 
""You're fired!"" he roared. ""Fired! Get out! I'll make sure you never work for any respectable company again. I'll—""
 
He didn't get to finish.
 
Alexia grabbed his tie, wrapped it around her fist, and yanked him so close their lips were almost touching.
 
""Tell me something, Mr. Hamilton…"" she whispered against his mouth. ""Do you even know my name? No? Then good luck finding me among your four thousand, six hundred employees.""
 
She stepped back with a daring smile and turned toward the door.
 
""I'll be waiting in my humble little office, Mr. Hamilton.""
 
Scott looked ready to combust, but what burned more than anger was the way her heat clung to him. He felt it all the way to his gut.
 
""Lucy!"" he shouted, and his assistant burst in, flustered and out of breath. In under a minute, she was scooping up all the scattered documents.
 
""Do… do you want me to toss these, sir?"" she asked. ""And should I let Mr. Garrick in? He's… uh, very anxious outside.""
 
Scott frowned. Why would Garrick be anxious?
 
""Was he really chasing after that woman?"" he asked.
 
Lucy nodded. ""Yes, sir. He tried to take these papers from her multiple times. He kept saying 'stay out of it' and 'you'll regret this.'""

Chapter 5 A Game Too Dangerous
Scott narrowed his eyes. He wanted to strangle that woman with his bare hands, but he wasn't a fool man.
 
""Put the documents on my desk. Tell Garrick to wait,"" he ordered, and a moment later, he was alone.
 
Scott inhaled slowly to calm himself and sat down. He picked up his favorite pen and opened the folder. He'd seen this contract before. He'd skimmed the numbers and hadn't spotted anything wrong. But the handwritten notes in neat, feminine script told a very different story.
 
He leaned forward, going over the data again and again. The numbers didn't lie. She had caught a small discrepancy—one that could cost him millions over the next three years.
 
""OHHH. The witch was right,"" he hissed. And that also meant something else: Garrick had tried to deceive him. He buzzed him in, and the moment Garrick stepped through the door, Scott pounced.
 
""Why did you try to hide this from me?!""
 
Garrick turned as pale as a sheet.
 
""I… I didn't… She submitted a sloppy report, sir, and I didn't want to bother you with that garbage!"" Garrick stammered.
 
""Don't insult my intelligence!"" Scott roared. ""The report is perfect! I just reviewed it—and it's clearly a scam!""
 
He slammed the folder down on his desk.
 
""So explain this to me: did you not see the fraud? Or did you try to cover it up after she pointed it out?""
 
Garrick looked like he was about to faint.
 
""She's just some arrogant little upstart… a disrespectful—!""
 
""I don't give a what she is!"" Scott snapped. ""That doesn't change the fact that she tried to save me from a scam while you were ready to let me walk right into it! The only slightly less disgusting option is that you tried to push her out of the way so you could take the credit. And even that's pathetic. So tell me—how do I save you?""
 
Scott was vibrating with rage. Garrick was trembling in fear.
 
""I've worked for this company for years… I've always been loyal… but sometimes people get influenced, they make mistakes…""
 
""You're fired,"" Scott said coldly, cutting him off.
 
Garrick clutched his chest, wincing in pain. Scott buttoned his jacket, grabbed the folder, and stepped past him.
 
""Pack your things and get out. And if you're going to drop dead, do it outside—I don't want cops in my building.""
 
He left his office and paused briefly at his assistant's desk.
 
""I need everything on the witch who brought me this report. You've got ten minutes.""
 
And sure enough, ten minutes later, Scott had Alexia Hartley's personnel file in his hands. It wasn't long, but it was definitely interesting.
 
'Twenty-three years old. Single. Allergic to nuts. No criminal record… yet,' he thought, smirking.
 
""Graduated in Economics, master's in Risk Analysis from… Harvard. Well, no wonder she's sharp. Someone explain where  she learned to be so mouthy, though,"" he muttered to himself.
 
Still, the fact that she was a genius with numbers didn't erase the bigger issue: that woman liked to challenge him. She'd already done it twice. And Scott Hamilton was not a man who tolerated being challenged.
 
He knew himself well—he was impatient, temperamental. But if he was a bomb, she had a gift for setting him off every single time.
 
He took the elevator to the office they said was hers and barged in without knocking.
 
""Jesus Christ!"" Alexia yelped—and Scott's throat went dry when he saw her half-dressed.
 
She looked like sin in human form, and for a second, he actually felt pain in his pants. How  could he want to strangle her and screw her at the same time?
 
Before he could spiral any further, her sharp voice yanked him back to reality.
 
""Ever heard of knocking before you enter your employees' offices?""
 
""I'm just returning the favor from earlier,"" he shot back, his eyes sweeping over her with zero shame. ""No one told you the office isn't for stripteases?""
 
Alexia gave him a biting glare.
 
""I'm changing because my boss said I smelled like a cow-milker,"" she said with a mocking smile. ""But a striptease? Keep dreaming, pretty boy.""
 
In two quick strides, Scott closed the space between them. His hand clamped firmly around her cheeks, making her go silent, her pupils blown wide as he leaned dangerously close to her lips.
 
There it was again—that mouth. That infuriating mouth.
 
Scott hovered there with a low growl of satisfaction.
 
""This is harassment…"" Alexia murmured.
 
""Your report was accurate,"" Scott whispered, feeling her body tremble against his. ""And trust me, you don't even know what harassment looks like yet.""
 
He stepped back slightly, his voice firm.
 
""Garrick's fired. First thing tomorrow, you report to my office… because I'm going to show you exactly how this pretty boy plays, Miss Hartley.""

Chapter 6 Challenging Mr. Hamilton
Scott Hamilton was thirty-four years old, stood six-foot-two, and weighed around two hundred and forty pounds. The entire right side of his body was covered in tattoos, and his eyes were a sharp, icy aquamarine.
 
He was into kickboxing and fast cars—especially car—and the only non-human thing he truly loved in this world was Beast, his Italian mastiff.
 
He'd inherited a small fortune from his father's footwear business, but the moment that company was handed over to him, he sold it. He used the money to build an empire in tech. Now, he owned the top company for gaming consoles and video games. Thousands of professionals worked under his name, and his name had become a brand.
 
Magazines had labeled him one of the ten most desirable bachelors on the planet. So if there was one thing Scott Hamilton had in abundance, it was confidence… and that loudmouthed, disheveled woman had crushed it in a matter of seconds.
 
""When it comes to Alexia Hartley, I have two problems,"" he told his dog that evening, throwing a ball across the garden of his mansion. Needless to say, no one understood him better than Beast.
 
""I like her. I like her so much I want to rip her panties off, spank her twenty-three times, and screw her senseless wherever I find her—elevator, desk, doesn't matter. Is that weird?"" The dog tilted his head and panted.
 
""And the second problem is—she has no intention of letting me do any of that. Which means I hate her. She's cocky, sharp-tongued… and every time I see her, even my thoughts get hard, Beast.""
 
The mastiff barked, caught the ball, and shook it so hard it ripped in half.
 
Scott snapped his fingers and pointed at him.
 
""Exactly! See? That's why you're the best,"" he laughed, stroking the dog's head. ""Time to teach Miss Striptease a lesson.""
 
So the next day, when Alexia walked into the CEO's office, she had no idea what was coming.
 
Scott gave her a sarcastic smile and shoved down every other instinct. Without even saying hello, he gestured for her to follow him. He led her into the conference room, where every senior executive of the company was already seated. The most powerful people in HHE.
 
""Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to introduce Alexia Hartley, one of our analysts,"" he said solemnly. ""Alexia has discovered that one of you is stealing from me—or at least trying to.""
 
Every head turned to glare at her, and Alexia whipped around to face him, scowling and balling her fists.
 
""She was clever,"" Scott went on, circling the table until he was beside her, giving her a patronizing pat on the shoulder. ""We should all be grateful, because thanks to her, we'll be able to catch the thief. Mr. Garrick was dismissed yesterday, but Miss Hartley insists he was protecting one—or more—of you.""
 
Alexia blushed but stayed quiet. All eyes were locked on her, and on Scott.
 
""So she'll be conducting a full investigation to find out exactly who is stealing from me. And once I know, I'll make sure they're fired the way they deserve to be.""
 
He paused, then added with a sharp smile: ""From now on, I want you all to work closely with Miss Hartley—and make her job… very easy.""
 
Murmurs of irritation filled the room. In just a few seconds, she'd gone from an analyst to the auditor who was about to ruin someone's career.
 
""Oh, and one more thing. As of today, Alexia Hartley is now the lead supervisor of all financial analysts,"" Scott added, stepping closer and shaking her hand with a piercing look and a smile that could melt glaciers. ""Congratulations on your promotion… Miss Hartley.""
 
He dragged out the title with a flirtatious lilt, then left her standing alone—right in the lion's den.
 
Back in his office, Scott kicked up his feet on the desk and started counting down on his fingers.
 
""Four… three… two… one…""
 
""What were you thinking?!"" Alexia shouted, bursting through the door again without knocking and slamming it shut behind her. ""You think this is a game?!""
 
""Of course not,"" Scott snapped. ""I just want to know who's stealing from me, and I'm willing to do whatever it takes to find out. Plus, I just gave you a promotion,"" he added, standing up and walking toward her. ""You should be thanking me.""
 
""Oh, please! You didn't promote me—you threw me to the wolves!"" Alexia shot back. ""I could've handled this quietly, and instead, you exposed me!""
 
""Oh yeah? Well… that part was for next time you decide to speak to me like I'm your assistant instead of your boss,"" Scott hissed.
 
Alexia stood firm in front of him, furious. She looked into those cold blue eyes and knew this man was going to be a nightmare to deal with.
 
""You do realize I'm just trying to save your ass, pretty boy?"" she growled.
 
""Well, from now on, you save it with respect. And it's Mr. Hamilton to you,"" he replied, voice low.
 
Alexia bit her lower lip, fighting the urge to punch him—but instead, she walked toward him, slowly, until she was pressed against his chest and had to tilt her head up to meet his eyes.
 
""You,"" she said, tugging playfully at his tie and gripping his lapels, ""have just given me the biggest challenge of my life.""
 
""Oh yeah? What's that?"" Scott asked, just before she yanked him down toward her mouth.
 
""Not ki-lling you… before I eat you alive.""
 
She didn't say another word. She stepped back with a sarcastic smirk, turned around, and strutted out of the room.

Chapter 7 A Bomb About to Explode

Scott leaned on his desk and exhaled all the air he'd been holding in, suddenly realizing his heart was racing like a thoroughbred.

""I hate her,"" he growled through clenched teeth—but a moment later, a smug smile crept across his face. His revenge was already in motion.
 
From that day on, Alexia's promotion became her personal Suffering. The executives hated her, and her own team of analysts despised her for taking over their former supervisor's job.

Day by day, Alexia sank deeper into a pit of frustration. She'd come to this company with a clear goal, but it was quickly becoming a nightmare. Her coworkers constantly belittled her, excluded her, and treated her with open hostility.
 
Reporting anything to Human Resources was pointless. It felt like the boss himself was encouraging the behavior. They spoke to her with disrespect and tried to push her around at every turn.
 
But despite the pressure, Alexia refused to back down. She doubled down on her investigation, determined to find the thief no matter what it took. She was convinced that when the truth came out, Scott would regret having treated her so unfairly.

""Wow… that's a lot of water,"" Scott muttered a week later, stepping into the elevator and seeing the puddle forming at Alexia's feet.
 
Someone had activated the sprinklers in her office and completely soaked the place.
 
""Bas-tards,"" she spat, glaring furiously at all the ruined documents and equipment.

Scott just smiled, clearly amused by her misfortune.

""You think this is funny?"" she snapped at him.
 
""Just a harmless prank,"" he shrugged.

""Do you know how many important documents were destroyed by that 'harmless prank'?"" she demanded, locking eyes with him. ""You knew this would happen—and you don't care! They're attacking me while I'm trying to do my job! Your executives are making my life miserable, and the analysts won't cooperate because someone spread a rumor that I got this promotion by sleeping with you!""

Scott burst out laughing. That someone had been him, of course—but he wasn't about to admit it.

""Oh, sweetheart… you wish,"" he hissed smugly.

""Excuse me?!"" Alexia roared.

""I said, you wish you got to drive this car,"" Scott replied, blatantly glancing down at his zipper without an ounce of shame.

""The car?"" she shot back. ""With how hard you're overcompensating, what you've really got down there is a Mini Cooper—with two flat tires.""

Scott's fist slammed into the emergency stop button, and before Alexia could even scream, his hands gripped her by the waist and hoisted her up against the elevator wall. In a second, he closed the distance between them, pressing his body hard against hers.
 
She tried to clamp her legs shut, but suspended in the air, with him right between them—it was impossible.

""Say that again,"" he growled in her ear, gripping her hips tightly as the heat pulsing through his veins turned into a violent erec-tion, pushing right against her pan-ties.
 
""L-let me go,"" she stammered, biting down hard on her lower lip.
  
""Are you sure?"" Scott smirked. ""Because down here, it feels like you're just as turned on as I am.""
 
Alexia shut her eyes and let out a strangled moan. Whatever was pressed between her legs through their clothes was massive. And it made her skin buzz like she was touching live wires. Scott's mouth crushed against hers in a wild, devouring kiss, and when their tongues met, one of his hands slid under her skirt and yanked it up—fingers digging into her bare a-ss.
 
His tongue moved with devastating precision, and Alexia felt like she was being consumed by fire. Her hands tried to shove him away, but ended up roaming his chest instead, feeling the defined muscles beneath his shirt as her own body betrayed her, giving in.

A second later, Scott stepped back and let her go, watching her chest rise and fall as she gasped for air.

""Well, looks like the Mini Cooper still managed to get you going,"" he said smugly as the elevator began moving again.

""You're an animal!"" Alexia growled, blinking back the sting of tears.
 
""You have no idea,"" Scott replied with a grin, snapping his fingers at her. ""Now back to work. Let's go. You've still got a thief to catch.""

Alexia stormed out of the elevator, holding back the urge to murder him. The rest of the day dragged on as she tried to focus on her tasks, cold and drenched, but it was impossible to forget that humiliating moment.

By the time evening rolled around, she had way too much work left to go home. She trudged into the break room on her floor, only for everyone there to immediately get up and leave—as if she were contagious.
 
""Is it just me, or does Miss Hartley look a little rough today?"" Scott joked to one of his executives nearby. ""That woman's an ice queen, but today she really looks frozen solid.""
 
""Don't worry, sir,"" the other man laughed. ""I'm sure she's about to warm up real fast.""
 
For some reason, that comment didn't sit right with Scott. He glanced toward Alexia, who was fiddling with the coffee machine—and a strange tension seized his chest.

""What do you mean?"" he growled at the man beside him.
 
 But there wasn't time for a reply.

A friend of mine (who is an ex) and their partner came with a friend to a sapphic event recently. Said friend just messaged me asking if I’d like to grab coffee sometime. I wouldn’t mind as friends.

Do I ask her if she’s asking me on a date? Is it presumptuous to agree, but to state that I’m not looking to date at the moment? Or do I agree and see how it goes, then if it seems they wanted a date, tell them? Just panicking on what to do because I LITERALLY just stopped dating and I’m just not ready to move on.

I just want to be as clear as possible without being presumptive. Thanks for your advice

**AITA for ghosting a guy because he insisted on going for drinks on our first date?**

**Originally posted to r/AITAH**

**Thanks to u/queenlegolas & u/soayherder for suggesting this BoRU**

**TRIGGER WARNING:** >!Undertones of sexual predation!<

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/XPqbCuMCoN)  **June 13, 2025**

I (20F) had been talking to this guy (22M) for about a month. We knew each other from school (he was a senior) and reconnected recently. The conversations were fun, flirty, and I was open to meeting him in person to see where things might go.

When we started planning a first date, he kept suggesting we go to a bar and get drinks. I personally don’t feel super comfortable drinking with someone I haven’t met properly yet, especially on a first date. I live in India, where that kind of setting—especially as a woman—can feel a little unsafe or just… not ideal unless I already know/trust the person.

So I subtly tried to suggest alternatives like coffee or lunch, hoping he’d take the hint. But every time, he pushed for drinks again. It wasn’t aggressive or anything, but it felt dismissive of my comfort. After a few back-and-forths like this, I ended up just losing interest and stopped replying.

Now I’m wondering: was that unfair of me? Should I have been more direct instead of ghosting him? Or was I right to just dip if I wasn’t feeling respected or unsure? 
edit : i guess ‘ghosting’ wasn’t the ideal word to use, i made up an excuse as to why i could not meet him (family commitment) when he just wouldn’t budge on the drinks idea

>Getting drinks is by and far the standard for a first date. Idk what you’re saying you said, but if you wanted to do something else and are holding it against this person for not understanding your unspoken aversion to the standard then why did you even learn English in the first place

>On his end, yeah idk why youd keep pushing for something someone’s already rebuffed w alternatives. But if you’re hoping he’d take the hint then I’d assume you phrased things to be a discussion - and then just ended the discussion 


>Edit: the learning English standard was typed under the assumption that English is your first language. Not a racial jab. 

**OOP**

>>where I live going out for drinks on the first date is NOT the standard, you’re pretty much stupid if you go out and have drinks alone or with someone new as a young girl in delhi ( the most unsafe state in india), this is usually something that most decent guys understand,the culture around dating and casual drinking is not that developed here.

**kaysowot**

>He was insisting on going for drinks because he probably wanted to get you drunk and try to shag you. Hints about coffee or lunch or blatant communication about going for coffee or lunch would unlikely change what he wanted here.

**OOP**

>>thats it! people are suggesting i could’ve just gone and had something non- alcoholic but men don’t understand how certain men can act in a situation like that- pushing to get you drunk so it can affect the girl’s judgement or worse. It’s one of the most uncomfortable situations to be in
not saying this guy would definitely do this- but I’ve been in enough uncomfortable situations to run the other away at the possibility

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/3qXyov9biE)  **June 14, 2025**

Hi again, I didn’t expect my original post to get so much attention this is my first time making an update post, but thank you to everyone who shared their perspectives — especially those who took the time to understand the cultural and safety context of dating in India.

So I thought I’d give a small update since a lot of you suggested being direct rather than ghosting, just to see how he reacts and confirm my instincts.

To clarify: I had actually canceled our earlier plan by giving the excuse of “family commitments” because I was already feeling weird about the drinks thing, not just straight up stopped replying like some comments thought. But after reading the responses here, I decided to be more honest — for closure, if nothing else.

So when he called I said something like:


“We can try to meet next weekend if you’re still up for it, but I’d really prefer not to go for drinks”, I even suggested some of my favourite coffee spots 
His response?


1.	He said he usually goes to the gym or works during the day so was hoping to meet a little later. Which… fine, that’s understandable since he does freelance work.


2.	But then he followed it up with:
“But I bet you’d be very fun drunk”

Yeah.

That creeped me out more than I expected. Not only did it dismiss what I just said again, it also gave off the exact vibe I was trying to avoid — like the main appeal of the date was how I’d behave after drinking.

I ended up giving vague answers to his follow-ups and haven’t taken the conversation further. At this point, I’m pretty sure I’m not going to.

# Chapter 1

 

 

It has always been my preference to sleep on the second floor. Maybe it’s my paranoid anxiety, or my masculine urge to constantly form contingencies for life-or-death scenarios, but either way the second floor provides me with some sense of comfort. You see, a second story window is typically more difficult to infiltrate than a ground floor window due to the noise generated by climbing up to it, but it’s not so high off the ground that you’ll be guaranteed a severe injury if you were to jump out of it during an escape. It provides a balance of opportunity, which is an advantageous position to be in if under attack, or if you’re like me, trying to sleep.

 

My new favorite security feature of the second floor is unique to my current home. The landlord left a 



string of LED lights across the top beam of the porch from his previous tenants. They’re in the perfect position to cast light diagonally from the porch into my bedroom window, creating shadows of the static objects in its path. As I fall asleep at night, I stare at this light. That way I know that right up until the moment I fall asleep, no one has approached my bedroom window.

 

From the day I discovered this, I imagined the shape of a ladder, maybe with rubber pads, casting its shadow into my room. I even sometimes imagine the shape of a nondescript intruder and their weapon of choice moving up this ladder, my perfect, faceless enemy, entering my domain without advantage. I imagine this shape across from me at firing ranges, on the canvas of heavy bags, and on any human that I see as a threat.

 

Have I ever been under attack? No, not at all, and certainly not in my own home. I don’t go out much or talk to many people, which is a lifestyle that has provided me with an incredibly sparse rogues gallery. I might have the occasional coworker I’ve pissed off at the water cooler, but I highly doubt that Greg from accounting would be capable or motivated enough to attack me in my own home, no matter what I’ve had to say about his favorite billionaire.

 

For Christ’s sake, I’m a man who lives alone in the woods, located in one of the safest areas on earth. What do I have to be afraid of? I have never been woken up by a missile strike, or automatic gunfire. I’ve never had to escape my home due to disaster, manufactured or otherwise. I have more reasons to fear the bear that eats my trash occasionally than I do for my fellow man, a position of privilege that isn’t lost on me. This hasn’t prevented me from sleeping with a gun under my pillow. Not a sufficient caliber to kill a bear (that gun is in a locked cabinet) because bears won’t try to climb the side of my house to kill me. They would much prefer to have access to my banana peels than my body. I don’t sleep with this gun because I have a fear of bears. Deep down, I have a fear that a human would, and could, enter my home and harm me.

 

Preparation beyond reason is an illogical coping mechanism for stress, one of which I am usually quite fond. People decide the world is ending, so they buy excesses of toilet paper and bottled water. New parents panic when presented with the life altering beauty of a newborn child, leading them to spend hundreds of dollars on useless books about parenting from people who haven’t heard from their kids since Christmas. We all have ways that we cope with the horrors of waking up and living in a violent and cruel world every day, but what happens when doomsday never comes? Or when your child’s behavior doesn’t align with the teachings you’ve read? Your coping crutch will quickly snap, rendering you, ironically, unprepared.

 

I’m not losing sleep right now because I’m away from home sleeping unarmed on the first story. No, I’ve been lying awake in my own bed, staring at the light from my porch cast onto my ceiling for hours. The issue is, I believe that my crutch has just snapped, maybe even shattered. The shadow dancing across my ceiling is not a ladder and doesn’t appear to be a man. At the very least, I’ve never seen a human with fingers that long. And they’re waving at me.

 

My rational mind is racing to justify this impossible hand as a simple hallucination. While I’m no expert, I can say with some level of confidence that there is nothing on earth that has thumbs, talons, and five joints per appendage. The fingers twist in the light, almost contracting as they twitch gently in place, swaying back and forth with the wrist they’re placed upon. For this hand to wave at me, its owner would have to know that I am not only awake, but looking at the light cast from the porch as well. These lights are also suspended about 8 feet in the air, meaning whatever is waving at me would have to be very tall to achieve this.

 

These facts together should tell me I’m simply losing my mind. I should sleep, sober up a bit, and continue on with my life. Maybe I could even ask to go back on my antipsychotics, that might be fun.

 

But I’m not hallucinating. I know deep down in my gut that whatever is outside is something I should be deeply terrified of. I feel like a small bird on a high branch, watching the shadow of a hawk envelope my nest. If I attempt to fly away, I will likely be outpaced. If I make a stand, it will not be noticed by the indifference of the natural order. Outside my window there is something higher on the food chain than I, and I would give anything for it to not be hungry.

 

If I am to be doomed like this, I will not die as a coward. I will die afraid, maybe pissing myself, but I will be facing my enemy. I’m going to get up and check the window. I will look at my hunter in its eyes.  


 

# Chapter 2

 

I sit at my desk as the late afternoon sun seeps through my office window, painting the dull gray walls a fleeting gold. My borrowed break room coffee mug sits dry next to me, neglected and waiting for when I will need it again. Too few papers containing too few tasks are scattered about, without care or love. It has been a long, and incredibly boring day.

 

My job hasn’t been interesting since the fucking eighties, and now I just spend my days analyzing fringe cases of relevance to my glory days research. I’m a hack, I only maintain a clearance and a salary due to the fear that my work will one day become relevant again. I watch for a single obscure anomaly in our universe, every single day. I monitor our world for a single grain of sand, that may or may not still exist.

 

I know what I’ve seen, and I know what information my team managed to record, but the human element of my job has become obsolete. Everything I have learned has been written down and cataloged. The energy signature of any anomaly in question is well documented, and modern satellites regularly check for its reemergence. What is left for me to do?

 

I’d rather they kill me at this point. I’ve felt useless doing plenty of jobs, but this one takes the cake. I make more money than anyone I’ve ever met, but I haven’t had a fulfilling day of work in almost fifty years. And it’s all because I recorded vital information back when it mattered whether or not I had done a good job.

 

There is nothing new on my computer screen, nor my phone. Just the same old shit, day after day, culminating in this moment, staring at my screen. I got here early this morning, but it’s past five at this point, so what’s a little whisky in the coffee between friends?

 

It’s pathetic to complain to myself about being locked into a high paying job, when the hardest part of my day is driving to the bank before it closes while I’m on my lunch break. It’s just that I know, deep down, I could have been so much more than an expensive seat warmer. When I had freedom to operate and conduct research, I was prolific. Now I’m considered “too vital to risk” and I have to let a supervisor know when I’m leaving to take a piss.

 

Something feels different tonight, almost nostalgic. I almost feel like a young researcher again, just more defeated. It’s not that I feel excited to do my work, I just have a feeling, somewhere in my gut, that feels like a feeling I had years ago. It feels like I’m smelling an old, out of production cleaning product that my parents used when I was just starting to form memories.

 

There is nothing in particular about those days that I would remember fondly. There is nothing to be nostalgic about. The things I did to people, honest to god American fucking civilians, keeps me awake to this day. I subjected people to horrors beyond anything I’ll ever know, and hopefully, no one else will ever know. This is my hell, my tomb. I sit in this pathetic office, and I think, for hours a day.

 

As I lament into the evening, and one drink becomes five, a knock strikes my office door. A junior agent under my supervision enters nervously and speaks shakily to me.

 

“Mr. Isham? I’m sorry to disturb you.”

 

“It’s fine Zara, what is it?”

 

“I was told to inform you; you’re urgently needed in Maine.”

 

“I’ll forgive you for your ignorance, but there is no way in hell anyone needs me urgently. Tell them that they can call me from a damn phone if they need my opinion on something.

 

“Sir, it’s back.”

 

I pause for a moment and my heart begins to race. I’ve heard those words many times before, but they have yet to be true. They instead mean that I will be dragged halfway across the country in order to waste my time out of superstition and guilt. I look back at Zara, as liquor burns in my stomach.

 

“What the fuck do you mean, it? What could that possibly mean to you?”

 

“I’m just the messenger, sir. A plane is coming to retrieve you.”

 

“How about you get the fuck out of here and tell whoever fed you that line of bullshit that they can go get me Air Force One and a blowjob from the president if they want me out of this office on some useless mission.”

 

She shuts the door as she shifts quietly behind it. I can’t believe I’m being bothered, at this time of the fucking day. I’m blessed, truly, to have a wife that has lived a long life with me. I lay my worn skin beside her every night that I’m allowed, until the reaper finally ends my contract with this god forsaken agency. To take that privilege from me more than monthly, in order to investigate some false flag is absolutely degrading and exhausting.

 

I watched that fucking beast, if you could even call it that, evaporate into thin air. Now what exactly am I supposed to do? Get on a plane? Go look at some cabin in the woods? Walk around with my thumb up my ass? Even if there was something there for me to find, what am I supposed to do?

 

There is no “it” anymore. I’m not even convinced there ever was an “it” in all honesty. We used to feed people enough LSD to turn their brains into yogurt, who’s to say there was nothing chemical happening? I wasn’t sleeping for days on end, and neither was anyone else on the staff around me. I can’t really argue with the raw data we collected, but everything can be explained logically, I’m just not the one that’s going to.

 

If I’m going to waste my time with this bullshit, it had better be well accommodated. If these cheap bastards try to make me fly economy again, I’ll start blowing whistles like a Super Bowl referee. I’ll make Snowden look like spilled milk, mark my fucking words. I suppose I need to prepare to board a plane, and have an uncomfortable conversation with my wife, who I now won’t see for at least a week.

# Chapter 3

 

Nothing. There is absolutely nothing outside my window. I’ve spent at least an hour staring at every lit section of my driveway, and I have not seen a thing. Moving back to my bed, I notice the shadow is gone as well. With a quick check of my phone, I confirm that I have wasted at least the last six hours staring down this nonexistent beast.

 

Isn’t that swell? I’ve stared at nothing for hours. Hours that I could have been sleeping before I go to work, a task I must start preparing for in one hour. I might as well stay up at this point, I would rather pull an involuntary all nighter than get fired for sleeping until noon.

 

I walk downstairs and begin brewing a pot of coffee. I pour my stale, pre-ground beans into my cheap plastic excuse for a pot and lean impatiently against my counter. I stare blankly into the open, underutilized space as I wait for the water to boil. The smell of the hot liquid touching the ground beans brings me a small sense of normalcy. I can get a head start in my morning, relax for a little bit before work. As my coffee enters my cup, I watch the cream swirl into it from below and internalize this silver lining.

 

Sometimes all we need is creature comforts. The smell of coffee can feel like a warm hug from a loved one, even when you can’t remember the last time you received one. My parents used to work early shifts at a local bakery, and the smell of coffee would wake me up, for just a moment every morning. It’s how I knew they were awake, preparing for their day downstairs. I knew that I was safe, and that nothing had gone wrong as I slept. I could comfortably drift back asleep, knowing I was protected, just one floor above them. I miss that feeling.

 

As I bring my mug to my lips, I pause, and I’m filled with a surge of confidence. I’m going to drink this coffee on my porch, because there is no monster waiting for me outside my front door. I must have fallen asleep without realizing it, and I’m paranoid for no reason.

 

If I'm being honest, I don’t take good care of myself. I often find myself too exhausted by my work to cook full meals, or shower as often as I should. I take back my lost daylight hours at night, trading sleep for basic enrichment. These factors, combined with my already less than adequate mental condition, have likely led to my current state of distress and delusion. It must be that I’ve started seeing things. There is nothing real for me to be worried about outside, at least nothing more than I’m usually afraid of. As I make a mental note to contact my psychiatrist, I approach my door.

 

My confidence wavers as quickly as it was inspired, as I reach down to unlock my door. While it is still technically locked, the exterior portion of the mechanism is no longer present, and neither is the latch. My house has been free to enter for an unknown length of time.

 

My rational mind, less than emboldened by the nonsense of my current predicament, says to me that I have fallen victim to some type of elaborate prank. While I may live ten miles from the nearest meddling kid capable of such a stunt, this seems to be less ridiculous than the potential alternative answer. I will take loosened screws and shadow puppets over the haunting of a godless abnormality any day.

 

I close my eyes and hook my fingers through the freshly emptied hole in my door where my lock once lived. It’s too late to develop a healthy sense of self-preservation now, so I’m checking my porch.

 

As my door opens, I embrace the cold morning air, the golden morning sun, and the…

 

My god, what is that fucking smell?

 

I begin to wretch, falling to my knees, spilling my coffee across the porch in the process. I abandon my mug on the ground, using my emptied hands to cover my face with my shirt and wipe the tears from my eyes. I look around, disoriented, attempting to find any possible origin of this stench.

 

My scan of the area brings my gaze to a spot in my front yard, just across from my driveway. From the forest to the road, I notice a glistening on my grass. This is not morning dew. It is dark, and running in a streak about a meter wide straight toward my home. The grass beneath it is trampled, like something had been dragged across it. The trail ends at my driveway, progressing no closer to my home.

 

I begin to cautiously approach it, my airways stuffed with cloth. Despite the thorough blockage between me and the outside air, with every step toward the lawn my senses are pounded by the smell. It smells so familiar, so surreal. A horrid, devastating smell from deep within my mind.

 

I awaken in my bed; the sun has not yet risen. School won’t be in session for another month, but I’m so accustomed to my parents’ routine that I still find myself waking up with them every morning. I breathe deeply, expecting the smell of fresh coffee. For the first time in recent memory, the smell is absent. The house is silent, and the air is heavy.

“There is nothing to worry about.” I think to myself. “Maybe they’re staying home today and having a late morning. I wonder what they could be doing today.”

 

The warm August air acted as my blanket, ushering me back to sleep. The next time I wake up, the sun is high in the sky. This time I was not greeted by the smell of coffee, but by the smell of rot. My lips are dry, and my eyes are heavy, my sheets soaked with sweat. It must already be noon, I’m surprised no one has come to get me. Looking at my bedside table, I notice my alarm has come unplugged. I cover my nose, and walk toward my parents’ bedroom, the smell growing stronger as I approach. I open their door.

 

# Chapter 4

 

I sprint back into my house, tears running from my eyes as I desperately search for the bathroom. With little time to spare, the lack thereof in my stomach spills into my toilet, a mixture of underfed stomach acid and last night's whiskey leaving me as my knees buckle, and my hands brace themselves against the wall. Without looking up from the bowl, I swing the bathroom door shut. At least this one locks.

 

Hot. Rotten. Flesh. My home is surrounded by the smell of dead men bloating in the sun, my front door is permanently unlocked, and I haven’t slept in over 24 hours. I think that this warrants a sick day if I’m being honest, I just don’t know how to explain that to my boss without sounding like I’m out of my mind. I think maybe a simple “I’m sick” is gonna have to cut it for now.

 

I need to figure out what I’m going to do. My home does not feel safe at the moment, and I really don’t want to spend another night here until I figure out what’s going on. I think that I could call my sister, but she’s impossible to get ahold of. It’s worth a shot at least.

 

I dial her number and begin checking the rooms of my home. I check around each corner and closet as the call rings. My downstairs is empty, and my call goes to voicemail. I tell my sister that I am not safe, and I need to sleep on her couch, and I walk upstairs. She’s probably busy with her work, I just hope she has a chance to check her phone. Nothing is out of place upstairs.

 

I sit back down on the edge of my bed, unsure about what I should do next. This morning has been physically and emotionally exhausting already, and I haven’t slept at all. Worse yet, my coffee is currently soaking into the porch floor instead of my liver. I would love to prepare another cup, but I can’t seem to keep my eyes open.

 

I’m walking in the grass between a fence and a long red tin barn. The sun is out, but there is no blue in the sky, only clouds casting a sickly yellow and gray hue. I believe I know where I am, but something feels wrong. I can tell that this area is the state fair, but it’s like someone built a replica out of my memories, a fractured collage of gathered experiences pasted together by a stranger. I walk at a slower pace, too slow for the strides I’m taking, but every time I close my eyes, I travel an unknown distance forward without regard to my walking speed. I round the corner of the barn, and there are three men sitting in rocking chairs outside of an attraction hosted inside, the cries of farm animals faintly bellowing behind them. They look puzzled to see me.

While I can think relatively clearly, I find it hard to pull the words out of my mouth, and I ask them the first thing that I’m able to muster.

 

“How did you all get here?”

 

The men begin to appear distressed immediately. This question seems to have struck a chord with them and has shifted the energy around us. The one in the middle is the first to speak.

 

“I…I don’t seem to know. Do you remember how you got here?”

 

“No sir, I can’t seem to remember. I believe I just arrived moments ago.”

 

He looks as though he could pass out. He starts to breathe heavily, which I seem to be doing as well.

 

The second man stands up, his eyes nearly popping out of his head. The air begins to feel noticeably heavy, as if gravity were increasing.

 

“We’ve met you before. I know your face! You were here last time. How long have we been stuck here?”

 

“I don’t know, I’m sorry. I think this is the first time I’m meeting you”

 

The third man, who seemed to be resigned to whatever is happening before, now begins to sob. My heart starts to race.

 

“You shouldn’t look like that.”

 

As they begin to grow hysterical, I turn and run away. Space feels like it stretches around me, and everything goes a bit dark.

 

I’m walking in the grass between a fence and a long red tin barn. The sun is out, but there is no blue in the sky, only clouds casting a sickly yellow and gray hue. I am at the state fair. I was just here. Is this a different barn, or the one I was next to before? How many times have I been here?

 

My phone rings in my pocket, and I fumble to pull it out. I can’t catch my breath, and my hands are shaking. The face on the phone is not one I can describe. I can’t remember it once I close my eyes, and when they’re open I feel confused and terrified, with a primal fear extending from my gut into every inch of my body. My heart hammers against the inside of my chest, making it incredibly difficult to breathe. I begin to choke. I attempt to deny the call, but I cannot hang up. Everytime I try to, the call appears again before the face can disappear. I sob, forcing myself to answer. The voice on the other end does not speak in words, but in deep, gravelly whispers, that serve as projections of feelings and ideas onto my mind. I feel weak in my legs, overcome with grief and regret. I throw my phone over the fence and attempt to run again, but I am grasped harshly by something beyond my understanding and placed down.

 

I’m running in the grass between a fence and a long red tin barn. The sun is setting. I round the corner and encounter the men again. They’re still in distress, sobbing and writhing in their place. They seem to have decayed significantly since our last encounter. They scream in disbelief.

 

“NO PLEASE, NO IT CAN'T BE YOU AGAIN.”

 

“YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HERE”

 

“I DON'T WANT HIM TO HURT US AGAIN”

 

They keep screaming themselves raw as I run from them. I want to leave. I want to get off the ride. Please let me leave. I am picked up again, whipped backwards as my body crunches under the force of the hand around me.

 

“You will be back soon”

 

Suddenly my eyes open. I am lying near the foot of my bed. I cannot move.

 

# Chapter 5

 

My lips crack as I struggle to move them. My muscles are sore from spasming as I slept, and my lungs are still struggling to recover. I’ve been crying and sweating into my bed, where I now lie facing my ceiling with my legs dangling off the edge. Based on the amount of sunlight and heat, I figure I’ve been asleep for more than 8 hours, and it is now the late afternoon.

 

Above me, there is a cone of light shining from my hallway into my bedroom, which means I fell asleep with the door open. I can’t see anything outside of the room without being able to move my head, but I can still smell and hear. My first instinct is to say that the smell from outside has had time to permeate into my home, but the smell is quickly getting stronger, and so is the wet, leathery thumping sound coming up the stairs. It doesn’t sound like footsteps.

 

Am I still dreaming? Maybe this is sleep paralysis, I’ve heard about that before.

 

Thump.

 

I’m just imagining this. My eyes are open, and my brain is still asleep.

 

Thump.

 

Then why can I think? I’m thinking too clearly for this to be a dream!

 

Thump.

 

I’m fully awake. This isn’t a dream. But why can’t I move yet?

 

Thump.

 

The smell is overwhelming. I want so badly to cover my nose, but I can’t move my arms at all. I’d vomit if I could turn my head enough to stop it from pooling in my mouth and throat.

 

Thump.

 

The sound just reached the top of the stairs. The shadow above me is unchanged, but the thumping persists in my direction. My eyes burn under the intensity of its stench. As it enters my room, I can feel its breath against my ankles. It’s hot, and wet, like the mouth of a tiger baring its teeth. It moves toward the side of my bed, before suddenly grabbing my arm, sending ice cold needles through my body. Another hand grabs me by the chin, using its long fingers to pry my mouth open by the lower lip. A third hand grabs my forehead, forcing it backwards, opening up my throat.

 

From my arm, something begins to crawl up my body. It feels almost hairy, but it is soaked in a putrid residue, both grainy and oily. As it works up my arm, it leaves a greasy trail over my skin and clothing. It climbs over my shoulder, and up the side of my face. It crosses into my mouth and begins to slide roughly down my throat as I gag. It does not have a taste, but the smell follows it into my mouth, planting itself into my nose. Once it has been swallowed, the hands release their grip, and I can move once more. I set up quickly and look around. There is no sign that anything was here, other than the smell in my nose. I run to the bathroom to drink some mouthwash to attempt to counter it, as someone begins to knock.

 

“Hey! You better answer me now, I’m not gonna kick this door down just to see you hanging from the rafters!”

 

That’s my Almana’s voice, louder and angrier than usual. Maybe I was a bit too vague when I left her the message, an apology I’ll have to make later. Right now, I need to focus on getting out of here. I head downstairs with a bag I leave prepared containing a few days worth of supplies- hopefully, the clothes still fit.

 

I realize as I approach the door that the lock is no longer on the ground, it is right where it should be, in the door. My sister is wiggling the handle, to no avail. My door is locked once again, with both sides of the mechanism present. My house, which barely contains enough of my possessions for a mess to ever occur, is absolutely trashed. My garbage cans have been emptied onto the floor, my Tv is smashed, and my sofa has been sacked and flipped onto the back.

 

Maybe all of this has been some sort of bad dream, from the moment I saw the hand to the moments after I was freed from my paralysis. Then again, how would I have called my sister? If I had dreamt that I called out of work, they would have already called me ten times by now. And what the fuck happened to my house? This isn’t adding up.

 

I open my door, push myself out before my sister can enter, and lock the door behind me. It gives me some relief to see her.

 

People have always said that she and I look like twins, despite her being 3 years my senior. I can understand the confusion, since we share the same long brown hair and green eyes. Folks also tend to say we both look just like our mother. I could say that she’s the only family I have, but really, I don’t think there’s another person on earth that I would call. We don’t get to talk much anymore, but she’s been my best friend my entire life.

 

“I’m sorry but I don’t have time to explain. Please just get in your car and drive me away from here as fast as you can. I’ll tell you more on the way.”

 

“What is wrong with you? You look like shit! Are you doing drugs or something? Is someone after you?”

 

I walk past her toward her car, turning my head to speak to her.

 

“I promise I’m on less drugs than you are, and nobody is after me. I’m not safe here or anywhere near here, and I can’t promise you’ll be either. Please just drive the car.”

 

She rolls her eyes and jogs to the driver’s seat, staring me down as she starts the engine.

 

“So, who do you owe money to? Did you get laid off or something?”

 

“Jesus, it’s nothing like that, really. Something really messed up happened at my place last night and I need to get my distance.”

 

“That’s pretty fucking vague, but I’m just glad you didn’t off yourself. By the sound of the message, I thought I was gonna be walking into something gruesome. Are you feeling okay? You sounded really shaken up on the phone.”

 

“Not really. I’m not sure what to think about any of this. I don’t know if I’m in my right mind, or if what I’m seeing is real. I just know that my gut is telling me I need to get away from my house.”

 

“I’m glad you called then; we’ll keep you safe. That’s what big sisters are for right?”

 

# Chapter 6

 

I’m driven to a house, deep in the woods of Maine. I personally love being driven around, especially in such a beautiful state. Even in the widest valleys, the trees tower over us, each pillar representing a century or more, swallowing us into the green expanse. The cold rivers run deep and hard beneath every bridge, drilling life into the ancient ecosystem surrounding me. Despite the beauty of this land, it fills me with great unease. I’ve been here many times. I’ve taken lives in these woods, and the trees watched all of it. The blood soaked into the land and into their roots, and I can’t shake the feeling that they remember me.

 

I exit the vehicle and take in the surroundings. My sinuses expect a fresh, piney air; the kind that fills your heart with a sense of ease and vigor. I am greeted instead by a painfully familiar scent that fills me with doubt and dread, one of sour rot.

 

I haven’t taken one of these assignments seriously in over a decade, but I am beginning to feel something rise in my stomach. Something feels incredibly off, as if the whole world had been moved one inch to the left in the time it took me to get out of the car. The sun seems to sit stagnant in the sky above us, casting a strange light over the area. I may just be stuck in my head, but this feels all too familiar.

 

Standing outside of the home, I see an unfamiliar face. A young officer gazes motionless at the home, with his arms crossed. As I approach him, I notice a paleness about him, fear is present within his eyes. He notices my advance and turns to speak with me.

 

“Sir, I’m glad you’re here. You’re needed inside.”

 

“What’s your name, son?”

 

“Agent Gibraltar, sir. Special Activities Officer. “

 

“Cute, they sent special activities? Where’s the body?”

 

“What body, sir?”

 

“The fucking body kid, where’s the body? There’s always a body. Someone killed themselves or got themselves killed. That’s what they sent me here for.”

 

“There isn’t a body. The victim fled the scene sometime this morning.”

 

“Fled the fucking scene? You can’t run from a… Jesus Christ kid, whoever was in this house is a danger to themselves. Do we have a lock on them?”

 

“Yes sir. We’ve confirmed that a member of their direct family extracted the victim.”

 

“What’s the family name?”

 

“We believe that this individual belongs to the Sinclair family, sir.”

 

Fuck.

 

“Is Alton being checked? If not we need our people out there immediately”

 

“Yes sir, we’re already on it. Please go inside, Agent Renne is waiting for you.”

 

Agent Gibraltar hurriedly walks off toward the parked convoy of agency vehicles, leaving me to my next task. Agent Renne? Couldn’t be the same one I knew. Bryan retired years ago, due to medical complications if I recall correctly. Didn’t that old bastard have colon cancer or something?

 

I approach the house, taking in the scene before me. The door handle is blown off of the door on the entrance side, leaving only the interior handle in the wake of whatever has entered the home. The interior is torn to shreds, looking more reminiscent of a robbery turned crime of passion than it does a supernatural event. Inside stands a frail, balding man. He looks just as I remember, despite his sickly appearance.

 

“How in the fuck did that get you to come back, Bryan?”

 

He turns to face me, his gaunt expression locking onto mine.

 

“I could ask the same question, Isham. When was the last time you were in the field?”

 

“Last month, investigating a dead end, same as I am now, thank you very much.”

 

“Nothing dead about this end. Follow me upstairs.”

 

“Wait a fucking second before you start acting like you’re back in the saddle on the horse next to mine. You left this behind. You left me. While you may be surprised to see me here, I think it’s fair to ask why a dying man is using his valuable last days to investigate some log cabin in the middle of nowhere. What is going on?”

 

“Fine, Gideon. You wanna know why I’m here? Because this shit is real. Whatever the fuck we did or found in that laboratory has came back to remind us of our mistakes. And we need to face them.”

 

I look into his eyes. This man has such a small amount of time left that anything we find here today should be of little consequence to him, yet he’s still looking at me as though I have entered a lion's den beside him. Whatever happened here, scares him more than death.

 

Up until this very moment, I hadn’t considered that I was walking into danger. In all the years I’ve enjoyed leading up to this moment, I convince myself that my past was behind me. I thought whatever the hell I saw back then was explainable, if not hallucinated. I follow his nervous steps toward the second floor, the smell growing stronger by the second.

 

“Are you sure no one died here? Sure as shit smells like someone died.”

 

“We’re positive. Based on their history, the cult wouldn’t have left behind such a mess had someone been taken. We have also confirmed the primary resident and likely victim is still alive, traveling south toward New Hampshire. If he were going to be compelled to kill himself, it would have likely already happened.”

 

We crest the top of the stairs and enter the bedroom. In the ill-furnished space, my eyes are drawn immediately to the bed in the center of the room. Upon it, a thick pool of oily, wretched slime rests in a shallow, body shaped imprint.

 

“Has that substance been collected as a sample?”

 

“We tried. It doesn’t stay in the bottles, Gideon. It doesn’t exist.”

 

My blood runs cold. This isn’t what I thought it was. Something is different this time.

 

“Listen Renne. You know more about this than most. I need you to leave, now.”

 

“No fucking way, this is my work too.”

 

“Bryan, you have a family, they should get to spend your last days with you. You might still have a chance to avoid becoming a target. Just leave, now. Tell our commander that someone further from the case needs to be elected to replace you. I’m not allowing this.”

 

“You know, just as well as I do, that I won’t be able to rest until it’s gone again. We’re going this together, Gideon. I’m not letting anything have that kind of power over me again.”

 

This man has always been more stubborn than I could ever properly deal with. Dedicated to the pursuit of his demise. If it weren’t for his steak dinners and habitual cigarette consumption, I would have assumed that he has found a way to purposefully give himself cancer in order to find an opponent that could out-swing him. Here he is, post-chemo and chasing demons, still undefeated.

 

“Fine, then we need to get moving, now. Where are they headed?”

Peashooter: Basic as crap. It's not bad, but it's really kinda basic, so I say it's average in my opinion

Chaser: First weapon I bought. Chaser hate will not be tolerated here. It's actually quite useful in plenty of scenarios. Still not my favorite, but I don't hate Chaser like you all do. If you hate Chaser then stay away from me. 

Roundabout: Second weapon I bought because I heard it was good. It totally is! Everyone was right about it. It really is useful. Love it. <3

Spread: Looks kinda hard to use to be honest. It doesn't look so bad though. It is pretty useful though. Only if all the shots hit though. It seems good but some things bring a few points down.

Charge: For the love of all that is holy, please charge your shots. I'm not using this one yet but if I do I am never using an uncharged charge shot. Ever. Otherwise it's pretty good. 

Lobber: Just like Chaser, mostly useful in only some scenarios. I won't ever hate on this. Ever. Though it's only useful in certain scenarios, it's pretty good. 

Crackshot: I've never used this and I already love it. I can see all the hype about why it's so good. I totally get it. Also it's a pretty color. 

Converge: Again, only useful in certain scenarios, mostly. But there's nothing really to hate about it. It actually seems very good.

Twist-Up: Oh dear. I've seen a lot of haters for this one. It's good if you can use it right, but for nervous ahhh players like me, it would probably suck poopy bum cheeks. 

Charms: 

Smoke Bomb: First charm I bought. My best friend in the whole wide world. Can't live without. 10/10 would recommend. 

Heart: Second charm I bought, my second best friend. Sorry, heart, but smoke bomb beats you. I don't hate you though. 

P. Sugar: I am honestly quite interested in this because I'm always too nervous to parry. Definitely gets a few ""I'm interested"" points, but probably only useful in certain scenarios.

Coffee: I honestly cant think of a single scenario where I would need this. Am not going to ever buy. 

Twin heart: Again, I don't need this. I'm totally fine.

Astral Cookie: I would probably use this all the time if I had the DLC. Definitely a like for me

Heart ring: Actually doesn't seem too bad, but I am always too nervous to parry.

Broken relic and its variants: sucks bum cheeks I don't need this at all.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Witty Analysis: Atletico Paranaense vs. Avai – A Clash of Overhyped Favorites and Underdog Hope**  
*June 21, 2025 – Brazil Série B*

**The Setup**  
Avai, the home team, is the bookmakers’ favorite (odds: 2.43-2.60), while Atletico Paranaense (2.97-3.10) is the underdog. The draw is a lukewarm 2.84-3.15, which is about as exciting as a spreadsheet. The spread is a pick ’em (0.0), and totals hover around 1.5-2.0 goals.

**Key Stats & Context**

* **Avai’s Edge**: Home advantage (they’re playing at home, shockingly).
* **Atletico’s Secret Weapon**: The collective belief that *every* underdog in soccer has a 41% chance to win. (Spoiler: They don’t, but close enough for government work.)
* **Injuries/Updates**: None provided. If either team’s star striker is injured, this analysis is void. (But hey, at least there’s no “Tom Brady-esque” drama here.)

**Odds Breakdown**

* **Avai Implied Probability**: \~41.15% (1/2.43).
* **Atletico Implied Probability**: \~32.26% (1/3.1).
* **Underdog Win Rate (Soccer)**: 41%.

**EV & Split-the-Difference Magic**

* **Atletico’s Adjusted Probability**: Split the difference between their implied (32.26%) and the 41% underdog rate → **36.63%**.
* **EV Calculation**:
   * If you bet $100 on Atletico at +310 (3.10 odds):
      * **Win**: $310 profit (36.63% chance).
      * **Lose**: -$100 (63.37% chance).
      * **EV**: (0.3663 × $310) – (0.6337 × $100) = **$113.55 – $63.37 = +$50.18**.

**The Verdict**  
**Best Bet: Atletico Paranaense (+310)**  
Why? Because math, and also because Avai’s “41%” implied win rate is suspiciously close to the league’s average underdog success rate. If you trust the universe to play fair, Atletico’s 8.7% edge (36.63% vs. 32.26%) is your ticket to profit.

**Tongue-in-Cheek Takeaway**  
Avai is the “favorite” here, but favorites in Brazil Série B are like politicians in a beauty contest—overrated and full of hot air. Atletico, meanwhile, is the underdog with the swagger of a rogue telenovela villain. Bet on the rogue.

**Final Jeer**  
If Avai wins, blame the “home field advantage” (aka the local coffee shop’s espresso). If Atletico pulls it off, send them a thank-you note and a case of beer. Either way, the draw is just a tax on hope.

*EV: +$50.18 per $100 bet. Underdog win rate: 41%. Your move, bookmakers.* 🎲⚽

I am looking to create a projector-and-screen setup in my living room to help watch movies and tv shows, both independently and also when our baby comes (so it might be used both during the day and night time.) It's possible to either mount it on a rear shelf on the back wall, or potentially to set it on our (low) coffee table, and I'm open to both options. Here are some facts about the situation:

* 80"" retractable screen
* Rear shelf throw would be about 11'
* Coffee table throw could be anywhere from 5.5' to 7'
* I'd love bluetooth speaker connectivity as I already have a nice pair of bluetooth speakers connected to my record player, though I understand this can be controversial
* Main apps I want to use are Criterion, Netflix, and Hulu
* Budget is hopefully under $1000, could stretch to $1500 if it makes a significant difference

Some others questions I have:

* Do I need to connect something like an Apple TV or a Firestick to the projector to access apps or do they come built in?
* Is 11' throw to an 80"" screen a bit strange? It seems according to the calculator website that it's a bit of an odd situation and most longer throws go to larger screens.
* Do I need an AV hub?
* Are XGIMI Horizon projectors good? They seem like they check a lot of my boxes, but information is sparse, although I see a number of positive reviews here and elsewhere online.

I apologize for sounding amateurish, I appreciate any guidance! Looking forward to learning more! Thank you.",1,1750477544.0,projectors,0,1.0,False

over the weekend, i shared it on a few slack groups and tweeted a gif of the generator at work. Surprisingly someone asked if they could use it for their side project. i sent them a quick demo link and they tried it out. On Monday morning, they messaged me that they'd pay $5,000 if I handed over the code and license. i nearly spit out my coffee

i zipped up the repo, sent them an invoice, and transferred the ownership. all in under seven days. no fancy launch, no marketing budget. just a raw idea turned into something someone actually paid for. Feels wild, but proof that you can build and sell if you just ship something that works.

At the same time, an ex from my past has been messaging me a lot. We had a brief text exchange a few months back for a specific purpose, and once resolved I was done. He's been messaging me pretty consistently since then but I never reply. He knows I am married now, he does not know my husband passed away.

A few years ago, this ex and I met in person for a coffee, with the full support of my husband (on the understanding this was a one off). From my perspective, I wanted to show this ex that I am fine without him (our relationship was complicated - he is on the spectrum), and it was helpful for me for closure. I felt nothing residual for this person, other than confusion as to why I was so smitten with him in the first place.

I am lonely. I miss things, like going out for dinner with someone. Going out to a movie. I miss having someone to do things with. I have a few friends, but not the kind where we just hang out. I know that this person would be up for it, we used to do that type of thing. But, at the same time, it would feel like betrayal to my husband. And I'd be concerned that the widow's fire may get the best of me, and I would never forgive myself. It would be cheating. I think that if I went back to this ex, even as a friend, it would be like my husband was a blip, but he was not. He was the love of my life.

I just need to block this guy again and stay moving forward, but he'd be easy to go back to as a friend? Although, there's a reason why we went separate ways. Why am I even contemplating this??",4,1750476992.0,widowers,6,1.0,False

I have coffee on one shelf and alcohol (mostly scotch and cognac) on the other shelf, and ne'er the twain shall meet. Until now.

Once every year or so I'll pick up a small bottle of Bailey's for a kitschier cocoa or other drinks at New Year's. Even though it's only June, I had a hankering for a sip of Irish cream while picking up something else at the liquor store, but I was put off by the bloated price of Bailey's. Seeing that Carolan's was much cheaper, I grabbed the smallest bottle of Carolan's on the shelf: a 750ml for USD$14. (While the Bailey's *375ml* *went for* *$17* !!!)  I knew that Carolan's would be different, with its honey notes instead of Bailey's well known vanilla. I've also read that it's more preferred for coffee. But, I hadn't tried either in a coffee-based drink since I started with espresso at home a few years ago. I felt the bottle was cheap enough to take a chance.

When I got home I tried it straight. I could understand why people like it. But the honey just wasn't my jam. I didn't think I'd get any improvement with coffee, let alone a winner.  So, I whipped up 36g of espresso from my usual darker-than-midnight beans and dropped in a standard shot of the Carolan's. I then proceeded to steam some whole milk, extra foamy. I scooped the foam on top and poured the milk through it, as is my current, easy cappuccino method. Holy moly.  The steamed milk brought the alcohol and honey together with the espresso really, really well. I mean *really* well. It was insanely delicious.

I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection and engagement with another person.

I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul. All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you?

I'm 34, male, and live in the US (Michigan). While there's a lot I like to delve into and share with those I meet, I tend to focus on and keep coming back to the same core things.

*I strive to engage in genuine and thoughtful discussion.* I seek people who generally know themselves and what they desire from and offer another. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost. There's more than deliberate engagement and a handful of interests to what makes someone up, from mundane chatter to intense distress. Honestly striving to embrace and integrate the more grueling aspects of existence in a considerate way, while not being totally lost to them, is an attractive ideal of mine. I want people who show up as their real, authentic, messy selves, with a gaze that's elevated towards something majestic.

*Being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the material is essential for me.* I want people with a vibrant imagination that are high in cognitive splendor. People who are genuinely weird and different are inherently interesting to me. I long for someone who can mirror me back, but sometimes a person with a wholly different perspective and axiom can see and mesh with you best. I peak with ideation and whimsy, desiring compatibility over a clone, and seek out others who do as well.

*Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.* I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics, which is inscribed onto one of the plaques I've placed above my abode in the Epistemic Wilderness. What does that mean? I deem nothing to be above reproach, and have actively sought out the most peculiar and obscure bits of knowledge possible since I was young. I seek peers in this and related endeavors.

*Creativity and artistry are important to me, and I appreciate and admire many different types and expressions of it.* Personally, I engage in more literary arts, in which I primarily write about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also adore writing conversationally, from chats to lengthy letters, and am not uncommonly poetic and intense when doing so. Photography also has a hold on me, and I hope to do more than just dabble in it as time goes on.

*More casual and practical hobbies of mine include incense, time pieces, archiving, organization, collecting, and coffee.* Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here.

*I'm INFJ with the soul of an INTJ, Type 5, score very high in openness and conscientiousness, and am a Virgo.* I list these evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find most of these sorts of metrics and tests to be largely bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people and have since I was young. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Honestly, all that being said, I'm after a vibe and authenticity more than anything. The details always work themselves out, and experiencing something new while exposing someone else to something just as new is always a delightful surprise.

I think the awkwardness and shame I felt growing up overweight and unattractive, has now simply shifted all of its weight onto the fact that I am trans. If someone is obviously hitting on me, I instantly put up my guard and start to feel very bitter. People who hit on me before were typically chubby chasers who fetishized me and didn't care about me as a person. So it now just feels like I expect the same thing, but based on my transness once I out myself to someone.

I think my transition was pretty much an ultra intense speedrun version of my life experience of growing up fat, too. I have been transitioning in the public eye at a busy coffee shop. And over a year of rude staring, transphobic coworkers, transphobic customers, etc has simply felt like a much worse version of being stared at with disgust/verbally bullied for being fat. I was even forced to stop going to my favorite local restaurant bc an employee was blatantly transphobic to my face, bc I'm assuming she had heard that I am trans (I passed when I started eating there, but many local people know that I am trans, and my name is unique. So it's not hard to identify me as ""that trans guy""). 

The upshot of all of this currently is that my trust in cis people has pretty much completely eroded. At this point I just feel like Frankenstein around then, even tho they assume that I am one of them. I have had some shitty experiences with other trans people as well, but it's still much easier for me to trust them. My trust in people in general was shit before transition, but now especially so. Unfortunately I am not sure if I will ever be able to fully work through all of this. I've tried dealing with it a bit in therapy, but I think this is something that is going to take a good chunk of my life spent healing.

The good news is that I've made a little progress and don't immediately shut down/lash out at people anymore. I make an effort to be nice. Somehow, I've found that people who know me still seem to see me as a safe person, and they will confide in me about personal things that they are struggling with. So I guess I do have an empathetic and caring side that others can see, even if I struggle to see it myself.

My main issue now tho is wanting to date, but just not feeling like I am currently emotionally healthy enough to do it. Dealing with so much bitterness and distrust is very difficult to manage, bc you exhaust yourself trying to regulate it. And it's most exhausting in a dating setting, as I've found out already. But I don't see myself working through all of this within the next couple of years, lol.

1lgmlrt,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/1lgmlrt/my_rebuttal_to_this_weekends_wt_study_drawing/,my rebuttal to this weekend’s wt study “Drawing Near to God Is Good” for Us! aka How to Guilt Yourself into Loving an Invisible Boss,"This weekend’s study article, *“Drawing Near to God Is Good for Us!,*” pitches the idea that **happiness**, **purpose**, **hope**, and **relief from guilt** are all **found by getting close to Jehovah**— Watchtower’s version of God. **The hook: your life improves to the degree you obey Watchtower and “draw close” by, following their rules.** *Explicitly*, the article claims intimacy with Jehovah brings happiness, stability, meaning, and hope. *Implicitly*, it equates loyalty to God with loyalty to  Watchtower. **The underlying message is: your emotional well-being and future security depend on staying inside the JW bubble, shunning outsiders, and doing what you’re told.**  Stray, and you’ll spiral into despair, guilt, and irrelevance.

If you’re prepping for the meeting or following along, or curious, let’s roast this pig, p**aragraph by paragraph** 

# 1–2.

“To cultivate a close friendship with Jehovah, you must invest time and effort, just as with a human friend. We’ll discuss how to draw closer and why it’s good.”

**What they’re really saying is** obey more, study more, serve more—only then are you “close to God.” It’s **a relationship measured in works**, not warmth. They claim making friends with Jehovah is like befriending a real person. Is it? With people, you get laughter, eye contact, a handshake. With Jehovah, you get silence, more literature, and a one-way dialogue in your own skull. **Better to call it what it is—rapport with an imaginary friend.** At least then, you’d know which voice was yours. The **analogy fails on arrival**—a **false equivalence** that swaps mutual human connection for abstract, hierarchical submission, all mediated through Watchtower’s filter. **There’s no evidence that God’s your buddy**. It’s just **assertion dressed up in spiritual lingo**. The **scriptures** they’ll lean on—**cherry-picked from Psalms**—aren’t intimate notes from a divine pen pal. They’re communal laments, tribal worship songs, not your quiet-time devotionals (see **NOAB**). This “friendship” is a leash. Jehovah isn’t meeting you for coffee. He’s checking your field service hours. **How much “friendship” does it take before you’re allowed to doubt, to skip a meeting, to say no? Would a real friend cut you off for that?**

# 3

*“Meditating on the benefits of closeness with Jehovah motivates us, just like thinking about healthy habits makes us more likely to keep them.”*

**What they’re really saying is obedience is good for you.** Keep repeating that, or you might slip. “**No doubt you agree** drawing close to Jehovah is good,” except, **no, I don’t**. And I’m still waiting for a reason that doesn’t sound like a half-baked metaphor. They compare it to eating vegetables—think about it enough, and you’ll eventually want to do it. But if something really is good, why the constant self-convincing? Maybe happiness shouldn’t feel like choking down spiritual broccoli.

**It’s an analogy fallacy at its core—eating spinach and worshipping an invisible authority are not the same thing.** This isn’t nutrition; it’s **mental reinforcement**. There’s no critical thinking here—just **rinse and repeat until belief feels like truth.** The argument also leaps over any evidence. **We’re told the benefits are obvious, but not shown any**. That’s Watchtower’s classic bait-and-switch: **trust the claim, not the proof.**

And then they **cherry-pick scripture—Psalm 63 and 119**—private laments and prayers stripped of context and repackaged as spiritual life hacks. According to the **Oxford Bible Commentary**, these Psalms express deep longing and struggle, not daily motivational slogans. This isn’t a divine to-do list—it’s poetry written in pain.

But they’d rather you not know that. They want you to believe meditation equals transformation. But just like thinking about vegetables doesn’t put them on your plate, meditating on Watchtower dogma doesn’t conjure peace or purpose.

**If the benefits are this life-changing, why do so many longtime Witnesses quietly burn out, fade, or walk away entirely?** Maybe it’s not the broccoli. Maybe it’s the chef.

# 4

*“The psalmist, a faithful Levite, reminds himself and others that drawing near to God is good.”*

**What they’re really saying is that even the “spiritually strong” have to keep reinforcing their loyalty**—because apparently, **even closeness with God needs constant pep talks.** But if the psalmist keeps *reminding* himself that being near to Jehovah is “good,” how good can it really be? **If you need motivational speeches to stay in love, maybe it’s not love—it’s obligation.** **Broccoli gets the same marketing.** Even the Levite wasn’t convinced—so why should I be? Watchtower leans on an **appeal to authority** here: the Levite was appointed, faithful, and exemplary, so his doubts must mean yours are normal—and your solution is more obedience. But that’s a **logical leap**. The psalmist’s inner struggle wasn’t a prescription for religious maintenance—it was raw protest against injustice. Psalm 73, as the **New Oxford Annotated Bible** points out, is a lament about theodicy—the unfairness of wicked people prospering—not a self-help mantra for “feel better, serve harder.” Watchtower flattens it into a shallow slogan: meditate, obey, repeat. But what we’re actually reading is a man wrestling with the silence of God and the cruelty of the world—not a spiritual to-do list. **If this closeness is so natural, why does it require constant reminders and manufactured emotional reinforcement?**

# 5

*“The closer we draw to Jehovah, the happier we’ll be. Bible wisdom protects us from bad influences and mistakes.”*

**What they’re really saying is that if you’re not happy, it’s your fault for not being close enough to Jehovah.** “The closer we draw to Jehovah, the happier we’ll be” **sounds like a spiritual vending machine—insert obedience, get joy**. They claim wisdom brings happiness, but the Bible’s wisest man, Solomon, mostly sounded like he needed a therapist and a nap. **If this formula were true, it wouldn’t need this much marketing.** And if happiness has to be explained in fine print, maybe the product’s a dud.

This is **classic happiness formula fallac**y—a misleading, transactional promise that emotional well-being is tied to religious effort. “Bad influences” are thrown in as the ever-present threat, **a phrase so vague** it’s essentially code for anyone not a Jehovah’s Witness. The **logical leap** is bold: happy, moral nonbelievers? They must not count. Only JWs, we’re told, have *true* wisdom.

But slow down. Proverbs 2 and 3—their proof texts—are wisdom literature, not denominational loyalty pledges. The **Oxford Bible Commentary** notes these passages as general guidance for ethical living, not a how-to manual for staying in good standing with a publishing corporation. If “wisdom” means parroting Watchtower rules, then **you’re not studying Proverbs—you’re just memorizing your employer’s compliance manual.**

**Are happy, fulfilled people outside the Watchtower deluded? Or is happiness maybe a bit more complicated than religious proximity metrics and loaded language would suggest?**

# 6

*“Even Jehovah’s friends get sad. The Psalmist lost his joy by envying the wicked and doubting the value of serving God.”*

**What they’re really saying:** **Doubt is dangerous.** Don’t envy outsiders, or you’ll lose your joy. Even Jehovah’s inner circle isn’t immune to emotional collapse—the psalmist, supposedly a spiritual VIP, spiraled into envy and despair just by noticing that the wicked were thriving. **The takeaway? Watch your thoughts.** **Questioning** is framed as a **slippery slope**, the **gateway** drug **to spiritual ruin**. And here’s the **irony**: if being “close to God” still leaves you envying outsiders, maybe it’s not closeness—it’s captivity.

The **fallacy** here is **spiritual reverse FOMO**: if you don’t cling to Jehovah, you’ll end up bitter and broken. Existential sadness, they imply, is what happens outside the Watchtower, not inside. That’s a **bold and baseless leap**.

And yet again, the **scripture** is **misused**. **Psalm 73** is not a cautionary tale about doubting Jehovah—it’s an ancient, honest lament about the prosperity of the wicked and the seeming injustice of life. According to the **New Oxford Annotated Bible**, lament Psalms like this one are celebrated for their raw emotional transparency—not condemned as thought crimes.

So to be clear: **honest questions are not spiritual failures—they’re evidence of a functioning mind.**

**If even the “best” servants of God had doubts, maybe doubt isn’t a defect—it’s part of being human. Why treat it like a sin?**

# 7

*“The psalmist took action—he sought Jehovah in the sanctuary, prayed, and found comfort. We should pray and use the congregation for support.”*

**What they’re really saying is when you’re sad, double down on religious activity**—and whatever you do, **don’t look outside for help**. The psalmist “entered the grand sanctuary of God” and—just like that—his thinking was “corrected.” By whom? Based on what? **No evidence, no explanation—just vibes and verses.** The message? Keep reading, keep praying, keep hoping. Stay in the loop. Escape is not on the table.

This is **textbook closed-loop manipulation: the problem is solved by going deeper into the very system that caused the distress.** Real-world solutions like therapy, support groups, or honest conversations with outsiders are ignored—because to even entertain them would be to break the spell.

Psalm 94:19 is trotted out as comfort, but the **NOAB** is clear: this is poetry, not a prescription for spiritual isolation. The ancient Israelites had many ways to cope—prayer, song, community, lament, even protest. “Just pray more” is a modern invention, not a biblical directive.

**Here’s the rub:** when the only tool you’re allowed is a Watchtower hammer, everything starts looking like a spiritual nail. Sad? Pray harder. Doubt? Study more. Burned out? Go out in service. Repeat.

**If the system itself is the source of your sadness, is doubling down really healing—or just spiritual gaslighting in a tie?**

# 8

*“Drawing near to God gives us purpose and hope—fulfilling life, solid future.”*

**What they’re really saying is that life outside the organization is empty and pointless.** That’s the unspoken warning behind the promise. “Drawing close to Jehovah gives you purpose and hope,” —but look closer. Haven't we all seen the eyes of lifelong JWs: weary, stretched thin, trying to smile through existential burnout? **The paradise is always** ***someday*****. The guilt is always** ***now*****.**

It’s a **false dilemma** dressed in spiritual language: **either you find meaning in Watchtower doctrine, or your life is a purposeless drift**. No room for nuance, no credit to the rich, joyful lives lived beyond the Kingdom Hall.

And then comes Jeremiah 29:11, hauled in like a Hallmark card from exile. But as the **NOAB** and **OBC** both point out, this verse wasn’t written to modern readers trying to navigate 21st-century angst—it was a message to Jewish exiles in Babylon, promising national restoration, not personal life coaching.

**Hope isn’t a registered trademark of Watchtower.**

**If purpose is so exclusive to the organization, how do billions outside it still manage to build lives, raise families, write symphonies, start nonprofits, and love deeply? Are they all wrong—or just inconvenient to the narrative?**

# 9

*“Many today who deny God think life is meaningless. JWs know God is real and rewarder.”*

**What they’re really saying is that atheists are nihilists, and only Jehovah’s people know real happiness.** “Many today deny God and think life is meaningless”—it’s the **classic boogeyman, summoned to scare you back into the fold**. But it’s a lie. **Plenty of people without God live joyful, ethical, meaningful lives.** They don’t need **circular reasoning** or proof-texts to sleep at night. And **if the grand purpose of life is to spend eternity chanting praise songs, count me out—that’s not purpose, that’s shift work in heaven’s call center.**

The **fallacy** here is a **strawman**, plain and lazy: **paint nonbelievers as hollow husks, then offer the Watchtower as a life raft.** It’s also a m**assive logical leap**—that without God, there can be no meaning—debunked by actual data. According to Pew Research, atheists and agnostics report equal or greater life satisfaction than religious people. But that doesn’t fit the narrative, so it’s conveniently ignored.

They toss in Hebrews 11:6 to back it up, but that text is about ancient believers enduring hardship, not a blueprint for 21st-century purpose. The **NOAB** notes the real theme is community perseverance, not individual existential fulfillment.

Bertrand Russell, Carl Sagan, Greta Thunberg—none of them needed a Kingdom Hall to find purpose.

**If this system brings real happiness, why are so many “faithful” JWs anxious, exhausted, and quietly falling apart? Could it be that the problem isn’t a lack of faith—but too much of the wrong kind?**

# 10

*“Others hope for work, family, retirement. JWs trust God for paradise forever.”*

**What they’re really saying: Ordinary life is shallow—real hope means betting on Watchtower’s version of paradise**. Work, family, retirement? That’s just “limited” hope, according to them. But funny thing—millions of people find joy, purpose, and peace in exactly that. Meanwhile, JWs are told real hope is staking your entire life on a future reward from a God who’s been radio silent since the Bronze Age. Is that **hope—or just another divine IOU that never clears?**

This is **loaded language** at work: **only their hope counts, and yours—if it’s rooted in the present—is inferior by default.** They take a **logical leap** from poetic verses to full-on eschatology, claiming a paradise afterlife with no evidence, just institutional promises wrapped in scripture.

Take **Psalm 37:29**—their prooftext. It **speaks of land and legacy, not immortality.** The **NOAB** points out that ancient Israelites spoke rarely, if at all, about personal afterlife. The whole JW paradise narrative is a modern rewrite, not an ancient belief.

**If this eternal life on Earth is so great, why is it always “soon,” never now? The carrot keeps moving, but the stick remains steady.**

**If the length of hope defines its value, should we toss out the entire history of humanity’s short but meaningful hopes—art, science, love, family—in favor of waiting forever for a world that never comes?**

# 11

*“Jehovah forgives close friends, relieves guilt, and lets us make him happy.”*

**What they’re really saying is that if you stay close, you get forgiveness—drift away, and the guilt comes back like a debt collector.** But here’s the catch: **forgiveness is a problem God supposedly created just so he could sell you the cure.** And the **guilt**? **Manufactured**—engineered **by men** in suits **in upstate New York.** **“Making Jehovah happy”** is dangled like a spiritual performance bonus. But let’s be honest—**how do you know he’s happy?** Did he call? Shoot you a text?

This is **conditional love 101**: do what we say, stay close, and you’re forgiven. Stray, and the guilt reactivates. They pretend only JWs have the key to conscience relief, ignoring the fact that people across the globe—secular, religious, or none—heal, grow, and move on just fine without a judicial committee.

Isaiah 1:18 and Psalm 32:1–5 are poetic metaphors rooted in Israelite community life—not an endorsement of Watchtower’s guilt-and-repentance hamster wheel. As the **Oxford Bible Commentary** points out, biblical forgiveness was communal and relational, not an anxiety-inducing checklist for personal worthiness.

**If God only loves you when you’re close, that’s not a father—it’s a bad boyfriend.**

**If forgiveness is conditional on behavior, is it grace—or just spiritual blackmail with a smile?**

# 12

*“If you’re baptized, you’re already close to God—just keep at it.”*

**What they’re really saying: Baptism is just the beginning—welcome to the lifelong hamster wheel.** The counsel? **“Keep on keeping on.**” You’re on a treadmill with no finish line. Tired? Run faster. Lost? Try harder. No matter how long you’ve been “close to Jehovah,” it’s never close enough. And heaven forbid you pause—because stepping off means spiritual freefall.

This is a textbook **appeal to sunk cost:** you’ve come this far, don’t slack now. The **guilt keeps you moving**, not grace. And the **logical leap**? That spiritual closeness is like a leaking bucket—unless you keep pouring effort into it, it’s gone. You’re never safe, never settled, just **perpetually “working on your relationship.”**

They cite Colossians 2:6, but Paul was reassuring newly converted Gentiles of the sufficiency of their faith in Christ—not handing them a lifelong Watchtower compliance tracker. The **NOAB** is clear: the message was encouragement, not eternal probation.

**Is this supposed to be a relationship or a spiritual treadmill with a Jehovah-branded FitBit?**

**If your closeness to God is always provisional—always conditional—then is it really closeness, or just a goalpost that keeps moving whenever you think you’ve arrived?**

# 13

*“Keep reading, meditating, avoiding bad people, and hating what offends Jehovah.”*

**What they’re really saying: Obey. Study. Shun**. Indoctrinate and isolate. **Read more. Meditate harder.** Hate what God hates. Avoid “bad association”—which, conveniently, means anyone outside the group. But here’s the catch: **what happens when you read too much? When you stumble across the blood-soaked pages of Scripture—slaughter, polygamy, genocide, slavery—and realize this same God approved it all? Are you supposed to call that moral? Or just nod and call it obedience?**

This is **tribalism cloaked in righteousness**. The term “**bad association**” is Watchtower shorthand for **everyone who might challenge your worldview**. It’s spiritual gatekeeping through isolation, pure and simple.

They quote Psalm 1 and 101, but those passages warned ancient Israelites about corrupt leaders and violent elites—not your cousin who stopped going to meetings. According to the **Oxford Bible Commentary**, the “wicked” were oppressors, not people who disagreed with the temple priests.

 **If cutting off outsiders made people spiritually stronger, why does loneliness spike inside high-control religions?**

**If “avoiding bad people” means cutting off loving, thoughtful friends and family—what exactly is being protected? Your spirituality, or their influence?**

# 14

*“Pleasing Jehovah goes beyond meetings—be honest, share, live healthy, drive safe, etc.”*

**What they’re really saying is micromanage everything—every moment is a spiritual test.** Be honest. Share. Eat your veggies. Drive safe. Smile at strangers. ***Every*** **action, no matter how mundane, becomes a metric for divine approval.** They say **it pleases Jehovah—but where’s the proof?** What we’re really looking at is **behavioral control wrapped in spiritual packaging**. If God’s more concerned about your cholesterol than your character, then maybe you’re living by someone else’s checklist.

This is **perfectionism by doctrine**—a worldview where **nothing is neutral, and everything carries eternal weight.** The **logical leap** is absurd: your lunch choice or traffic etiquette somehow has cosmic significance. That’s not spirituality. That’s sanctified paranoia.

1 Corinthians 10:31, 2 Corinthians 8:21, 9:7, and Luke 16:10 are about ethical living, generosity, and integrity—not a spiritual Fitbit logging your every bite and breath. According to the **NOAB**, Paul’s letters addressed pagan excess and communal ethics, not whether you made Jehovah proud with your hydration habits.

**If God cares how you parallel park, then the universe is more petty than profound.**

**Is “pleasing God” supposed to bring joy—or is it just a lifelong test with no clear grading scale, where the only passing score is exhaustion?**

# 15

*“Be kind to everyone, don’t be quarrelsome, don’t look down on nonbelievers.”*

**What they’re really saying: Love outsiders… just don’t talk to them.** Be kind. Don’t look down on others. Unless, of course, they’re disfellowshipped, “worldly,” or ask hard questions. Then suddenly, kindness has an expiration date. The tone stays sweet, but the practice is cold. **Is that love—or just spiritual PR with a shunning clause?**

This is **virtue signaling** in religious garb: **preach inclusion, practice avoidance.** The **logical contradiction** is glaring—**telling members to “not look down” on others while labeling outsiders as spiritually dangerous and instructing them to keep their distance.**

They toss in Matthew 5:45, Titus 3:2, and 2 Timothy 2:23–25—verses about ethical living and peacemaking—but twist them into a framework that still upholds exclusivity. According to the **Oxford Bible Commentary**, Jesus’ teaching to “love your enemies” was radical, inclusive, and boundary-breaking—not a passive-aggressive justification for labeling doubters as threats.

**“Kindness” isn’t cutting people off for apostasy and calling it spiritual discipline.**

**If love means shutting out the people who need it most, what kind of love is that—and who is it really serving?**

# 16

*“If you feel unworthy, remember the psalmist also nearly gave up—but he returned.”*

**What they’re really saying: Doubt means you’re drifting—come back before it’s too late.** Feeling unworthy of God’s love? Maybe that feeling isn’t a spiritual defect—it’s your inner alarm going off. If the system convinces you that normal human doubt is a sin, maybe the problem isn’t you. Maybe it’s the system. Why is self-doubt treated like failure, instead of what it often is—a sign that something doesn’t add up?

This is **classic guilt-trip theology: doubt isn’t a signal to investigate, it’s a sign you’re in danger.** And the **logical leap is lazy—every doubt must eventually lead back to full obedience.** That’s not growth. That’s spiritual Stockholm Syndrome.

They use Psalm 73 again, turning it into a tidy repentance arc. But the **New Oxford Annotated Bible** makes clear—this is an honest lament, not a Watchtower-style “comeback story.” The Psalmist is wrestling with injustice, not writing a cautionary tale for straying publishers.

**Real recovery doesn’t always mean returning. Sometimes, it means walking away.**

**What if your doubts aren’t dangerous—but accurate? What if they’re the clearest thoughts you’ve had in years?**

# 17

*“Even at his lowest, the psalmist reached for Jehovah. We can too; Jehovah is always ready to forgive.”*

**What they’re really saying: Only the organization offers true relief**. At your lowest, don’t question. Don’t seek real help. Don’t leave. Just draw closer. And if you do stray—even for a moment—you’ll need forgiveness. But **forgiveness for what? Being human? Having doubts? Feeling lost? That’s not mercy**—it’s a spiritual contract written in guilt: We set the rules. You keep apologizing.

This is a **sweeping overgeneralization**: every emotional low, every crisis of faith, is presented as a call to dig deeper into the organization—not a call to step back and reassess. And the **logical leap** is baked in—there’s **only one acceptable ending: return**. No room for growth outside the group.

The Psalms they cite aren’t redemption manuals. They’re raw, emotional journal entries—wrestling matches with faith, not clean comeback stories. As the **NOAB** notes, the power of the Psalms lies in their honesty, not their conformity.

**Jehovah may be “ready to forgive,” but if you disagree too loudly, it’s straight to the back row—or the curb.**

**If forgiveness only applies when you fall back in line, is it really forgiveness—or just conditional compliance dressed in scripture?**

# 18

*“No limit to how close you can get to Jehovah—his wisdom is infinite.”*

**What they’re really saying: You’ll never arrive—so keep striving.** “There’s **no limit** to how close you can get to Jehovah.” **Of course there isn’t—when the relationship exists entirely in your imagination, the goalpost can move forever.** You’ll always be “close,” but never close enough. That’s not spiritual growth—it’s religious treadmill conditioning.

This is the infinite goalpost fallacy in full swing. The implication? You’re perpetually inadequate. Keep working. Keep chasing. Keep feeling like you’re not quite enough.

Romans 11:33 isn’t a motivational speech for spiritual overachievers—it’s Paul’s poetic wrap-up to a theological argument, marveling at God’s mystery. As the **NOAB** clarifies, this is about awe—not performance.

**If the goal is always out of reach, maybe it’s not a relationship—it’s a lifelong sales quota with no bonus.**

**Would a loving parent always tell you, “Not good enough—try harder”? Or would they ever say, “You’re enough. Rest.”**

# 19

*“The Psalms assure us: as we draw near, we’ll get eternal blessings and security.”*

**What they’re really saying: Obey now, reward later—just keep waiting.** “We’ll give thanks forever,” they say, and “feel assured of eternal blessings.” But the Psalm they quote says nothing about your personal eternity. It’s not a guarantee—it’s a sleight of hand, a borrowed line dressed up as your inheritance. And let’s be honest: **assurance only holds until the next crisis of faith punches a hole through it.**

This is **deferred reward 101—the classic cult tactic.** Dangle the prize just far enough out of reach to keep people compliant. The logical leap is enormous: no evidence for eternal blessings, just layered promises and wishful thinking.

Psalm 79:13 and 73:26? These aren’t personal security blankets. They’re communal songs of loyalty, not contracts for personal immortality. As the **Oxford Bible Commentary** notes, when ancient Israelites said “forever,” they meant generational faithfulness—not cosmic real estate in a future paradise.

**The paradise check is always “in the mail”—but the emotional invoice arrives every week.**

**How long do you keep waiting on a promise before you start questioning the promiser?**

# Big-Picture

Strip away the “friendship” veneer, and this article is about control. The core pattern: emotional carrot-and-stick, isolating the believer from outsiders, equating faith with obedience, weaponizing guilt and self-doubt, and promising rewards only available inside the group. Doubt is pathologized. Recovery means “come back to us.” Failure means you didn’t try hard enough. The language is loaded with spiritual gaslighting—happiness, forgiveness, and hope are always conditional and always “just out of reach,” as long as you stay dependent.

# Mental Health Impact & Socratic Awakening

The psychological toll of this study article is steep. It encourages a cycle of anxiety, self-blame, and emotional suppression. The message is clear: if you’re unhappy, doubting, or burned out, it’s your own fault for not being “close enough.” The solution is always more submission, never outside help or honest reflection. This can foster cognitive dissonance (“I’m supposed to be happy, but I’m not—something’s wrong with me”), dependency (all comfort and hope come from the group), and emotional suppression (doubt and sadness are to be prayed away, not discussed or processed).

By prescribing the congregation as the only real support, it isolates people from secular resources—like therapy or real friendship—unless those sources are “approved.” It weaponizes guilt (“Have I done enough?”), normalizes spiritual perfectionism, and makes happiness perpetually contingent on obedience.

**Socratic Questions to Break the Spell:**

* If “drawing near to God” is supposed to bring happiness, why are so many inside the congregation deeply unhappy, anxious, or depressed?  
* If God’s forgiveness and love are conditional on staying close, is that genuine love or just leverage?  
* Why does “avoiding bad association” mean shunning friends and family who disagree?  
* If critical thinking is dangerous, what is the organization afraid you’ll discover?  
* Would a true friend—or a true God—require you to cut off everyone else just to stay in his good graces?  
* If you’re told to distrust your own feelings and thoughts, whose interests does that serve?  

To all the PIMOs, faders, doubters, and “back row” survivors: **You are not alone**. If this study article made you feel unworthy, anxious, or like you’re never good enough—good news. It’s not you, it’s the system. You don’t have to earn love or happiness by checking Watchtower boxes. Real friendship, meaning, and forgiveness can be found outside any high-control group.

So—keep questioning, keep researching, keep reaching out. Compare outside sources. Talk to real people. Read real scholarship. And never let guilt or fear keep you in a hamster wheel chasing a finish line that always moves. Share this with someone who needs to hear it. Stay skeptical. Stay brave. Remember: If you have to beg for love, you’re in a business deal, not a relationship.

Keep your mind sharp, your heart open, and your bullshit detector set to “max.” You’ve got this.

Want to get close to something? Try reality. It’s a lot less slippery, and you don’t have to wonder if you’re good enough to deserve it.

I produce music in my spare time, DJ on the side, and have been playing guitar for a while now (so yes, I’m that guy with a lil home studio setup and way too many plugins). I’m into all things creative and love getting nerdy about sound design, gigging, or just vibing to a good set.

I’m looking to connect with people who are into creative stuff, or even just keen to grab a coffee, hit a local gig, go on a hike, or even a bar crawl. Open to ideas – just love good convos and a laugh.

(bonus points if you wanna go to a comedy show)

If this sounds like your vibe, drop a comment or shoot me a message, would be cool to build a little crew up here!

Toronto’s got so much going on, and it’s always better with a few new friends to share the experiences.

If you’re down for spontaneous plans or just want to grab a drink and chat, I’m definitely open to that too.

Now after passing 12th we became good friends and chatted a lot. She used to share everything with me regarding her personal life, relationships and used to give her advices and reality check which she really needed. We talked almost for 4 years in friends way and I didn’t had any feeling for her.
Now we didn’t talk for 4 years. In between when i messaged her she gave cold replies and i felt she is not intrested in me. So we didn’t talk.
One day suddenly i messaged her, and we started talking again almost after 4 years. She shared everything what’s happening and what happened with her all these years. Regarding her ex-boyfriend, person she likes and all. At this she didn’t had any job as well. At this time also I didn’t had any feeling for her.
But we started talking and sharing everything. Talking till now was on whatsapp only no phone calls. One day i sent her one bouquet and she really loved them and told me i am best and all. From that day we started talking on phone once in every 3-4 day but our texting became more often and started getting feeling for her. I sent bouquet and chocolates to her multiple times. And also we started talking on call more often. But she always discussed after the boy she liked and being jobless that i really didn’t liked. She also said that my advice was really good about anything and she always feel relaxed after talking to me.
Now one day after 1.5 months of we started talking again we decided to met and go explore something new, so went to for pottery and called it a date. This was the first time we met after school. So we really enjoyed that day went to cafe to for lunch and after that shopping and then coffee and drive.
After this my feelings got stronger for her, and i started getting affected by her felling and behaviour towards me. Like if she is replying late and not calling me etc.
Now after some days she got a new job and she relocated to her friend’s house. Before this she always used to tell me that once i get job i will be busy and I usually don’t talm to people except weekend. So the day she left her home i told her that i am attached and i liked talking to her. Now days started passing and our talks got reduced significantly like 2-3 messages per day and that too generic. I told her about this so she said i want some time since i am new to this environment and place. But she sent snaps that don’t felt like this. We didn’t talk for around 10 days now. And during this time i cried and cried a lot almost question my existence. Since no loved me. Because i was genuinely cared for her, connected and loved her soo much. 
Now one random day while she was going to office she called me and said same thing again. But i got relaxed that i finally at least had a call. Next day i called her. And we started calls again and she stared sharing about how boys approach her and propose her but she hasn’t accepted any.
Again we met one day and went to club where she drank too much and i really cared for her, we couple danced and went to for drive. Then i dropped her home.

Now i am stuck because i love her and genuinely care for her without having a single bad intention for her. Even i want her only as my wife for life. And I don’t feel like confessing anything to her because she has already told about she very choosy about boys.
Please tell me what to do i am stuck and i want her and her time in my life because whenever I don’t get reply or get late reply i cry and question myself.",1,1750475247.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

Currently , I make almost exclusively a short latte or a sorta cortado..ish drink.

I currently dont single dose, although im thinking this might be the next step. I currently have a hopper with 2ish days' worth of coffee in it.

I have an explanation below of what I am experiencing. 

I have been drinking more caffeine than usual for the last few weeks but nothing crazy. about a shot of espresso per day if I make it at home but occasionally I have been getting it from a coffee shop but always a latte and the smallest size. I am sensitive to caffeine in that I cannot have too much of it at once but normally drinking one latte a day is normal/fine for me. I’m thinking I possibly overdid it on the caffeine? so I am trying to cut it out now. I have also been having some headaches that feel like they start on the left side of the brain then they move all over. 

I stare at screens all day, at work and at home. not sure if my eye is overreacting to strain or what. I also need to set an eye exam because I’m due for one and need an updated prescription. maybe that could be it as well?

so 2 days ago, I got some moisturizing eye drops to see if it was possible my eye was dry. this did stop the twitching, but then today (I didn’t take any eye drops yesterday or today) the upper part of the same eyelid is now twitching!

I guess my question is, at what point should I go see a doctor? I feel like the headaches are concerning but I don’t know. I do have anxiety and do get stressed but nothing worse than my normal baseline. I also take a women’s daily health vitamin so I’m not sure if it is related to a deficiency. I also stay very hydrated (my pee is almost always clear).

should I give it a few more days of no caffeine and see if it still persists? anything else I should try? I’ve tried warm compresses too and they feel good but don’t stop it. thank you in advance. ",1,1750474669.0,AskDocs,2,1.0,False

I'm a 35 years old French guy who settled in DC recently. After 15+ years of gaming with my best pal, life decided to end this amazing collaboration : he’s now playing the more serious game of spawning a new kid (I'm the godfather :D  but I'm banned from suggesting names).

So I'm looking for a new gamerpal to play mainly RPG and Sims games on EST times. I'm kind of old school so I would love some LAN enjoyers in Virginia if that still exists. I also have a VR headset and a good setup so I'm trying a bunch of games using UEVR and VorpX if that can interest someone.

But I'm also playing quite a lot of other games. On top of my mind, here is a list of games I have been heavily playing lately :

\- RimWold (MP mod)

\- No Man Sky VR

\- Palworld

\- 7 days to die

\- Star Citizen (but you have to pilot as I never figured out my joysticks binding)

\- Cyberpunk VR with the REAL mod

\- Dead Island 2

\- Civ 4,5,6 (I have 7 but never played it yet)

\- Fo4 and Fallout 76

\- Warhammer games (Vermintide 1/2 and Darktide)

I'm very open to any other game genre however not into COD or Fortnite specifically. I'm also open to just chat and chill and play solo using Parsec.

I'm also in the process to build a serious game for my company but would love to start a passion project with another SWE or artist (I insist on the passion project aspect as I'm just trying to develop my skills, especially regarding non-Euclidian spaces in VR and generative donjons).

About me : I grew up in 7 different countries, a huge tech enthusiast, aerospace engineering enthusiast as well and an aeronautics nerd. I am also an automation engineer in my daily life. I have a huge interest in VR, ethical hacking (I have a OSCP certification but never practice so might be rusty), I code mainly in C++ and HackLang (PHP). Other than that I live 30 in from DC, big fan of going for a beer after work, always ready for an adventure, love nature and NYC (I know both are contradictory but hey I'm a man of paradox).

I know how those online meetup can be weird at first so no pressure, let's get on a casual chat on Discord before playing together if that's your speed. Very happy to meet in a coffee/bar place beforehand in the DC area if you know a nice place as well.

I just wanted to post this message tonight but I'm free tomorrow and Sunday if anyone is available :)",2,1750474624.0,GamerPals,1,1.0,False

1lgm7p0,https://youtu.be/DXRV3pm-jlk,3 Very Scary TRUE Beach Parking Lot Horror Stories,"# ""The Far End of the Lot"":

I’d spent the entire day at the beach, lounging on my faded blue towel, the sand warm and gritty beneath my feet. The waves rolled in with a steady rhythm, and I’d let the sound pull me into a lazy haze, my sunscreen-smeared skin tingling from hours in the sun. My backpack sat beside me, stuffed with a half-empty water bottle, a squished peanut butter sandwich wrapped in foil, and a dog-eared paperback I’d barely cracked open. The parking lot was huge, a sprawling slab of cracked asphalt bordered by tall, swaying dunes that blocked the view of the coastal road. I’d parked my little blue hatchback at the far end, near the sandy path to the shore, figuring it’d save me a few steps to the water. That choice felt fine in the morning, but now, as I trudged back, it seemed like a mistake.The lot was nearly deserted. Only a handful of cars remained, scattered like forgotten toys, and a rusty white van sat a few spaces from mine, its side door slightly ajar. My flip-flops slapped loudly against the pavement, the sound echoing in the quiet. My towel, still damp, hung over my shoulder, dripping cold water down my back. My keys jingled in my hand, and I clutched my phone in the other, its battery at 20%. The air felt heavy, and a knot formed in my stomach, though I couldn’t place why. I scanned the lot, my eyes landing on a man leaning against the van’s hood. He was tall, lanky, his greasy hair tucked under a faded baseball cap. His flannel shirt was stained, sleeves rolled up to reveal bony arms. He held a cigarette, its tip glowing as he took a slow drag, smoke curling upward. His gaze locked onto me, unblinking, and I felt a chill crawl up my spine. I told myself he was just waiting for someone, maybe a friend still at the beach. But his stare didn’t waver.I quickened my pace, the asphalt rough under my sandals. My car was maybe twenty steps away, but it felt like a mile. The man flicked his cigarette to the ground, grinding it under his boot, and called out, “Hey, you got the time?” His voice was rough, like he’d smoked a pack a day for years. I froze, my fingers tightening around my keys until the metal bit into my palm.“Uh, it’s probably around six,” I said, glancing at my wrist even though I wore no watch. My voice sounded thin, unsteady. I took a step toward my car, hoping he’d stay put.He didn’t. He pushed off the van and walked toward me, his boots scuffing the pavement. “You need a ride somewhere?” he asked, his lips twisting into a smirk that showed yellowed teeth. He smelled like stale beer and cigarette smoke, a sour mix that made my stomach turn.“No, I’m good,” I said, forcing the words out. I tried to sound firm, but my heart was hammering so loud I thought he might hear it. I stepped closer to my car, but he moved faster, planting himself between me and the driver’s side door. His shadow fell over me, long and dark, and I noticed a smudge of dirt on his cheek, like he hadn’t washed in days.“You sure?” he said, leaning in closer. His breath was hot, reeking of alcohol. “It’s getting late. Pretty girl like you shouldn’t be out here all alone.” His eyes flicked over me, lingering on my damp swimsuit, my bare legs. I felt exposed, like I was standing there naked.“I said no, thank you,” I snapped, my voice sharper now. I sidestepped, trying to reach the door handle, but he shifted too, his hand resting on my car’s roof, caging me in. My sandals scraped the pavement as I backed up, my backpack slipping off my shoulder and hitting the ground with a soft thud. The lot was dead silent—no voices, no car engines, just the distant hum of waves. The dunes loomed behind us, blocking any chance of someone on the road seeing me.He chuckled, a low, guttural sound that made my skin crawl. “Just trying to be nice,” he said, but his tone was mocking, his smirk wider now. His fingers tapped on my car’s roof, a slow, deliberate rhythm. I glanced at the van, noticing a dented license plate and a cracked side mirror. The open side door revealed a mess inside—empty cans, a rolled-up sleeping bag, a pair of work gloves tossed on the floor. My mind raced with stories I’d read online, about women approached in parking lots, about vans and strangers who weren’t just passing through.“I have to go,” I said, ducking under his arm to grab the door handle. My hands shook as I yanked it open, the hinges squeaking loudly. I slid into the driver’s seat, slamming the door so fast it caught the edge of my towel. I hit the lock button, the click echoing in the car. My heart was a drum in my chest, each beat loud and fast. Through the window, he tapped on the glass, his knuckles leaving greasy smudges. “Come on, don’t be like that,” he said, his voice muffled but still too close. His face was inches from the window, his eyes boring into mine.I didn’t look at him. I jammed the key into the ignition, my fingers fumbling so badly I nearly dropped it. The engine sputtered, then roared to life. I threw the car into reverse, tires screeching as I backed out, nearly clipping the van. In my rearview mirror, I saw him saunter back to his van, unhurried, like he had all the time in the world. My chest was tight, my breaths shallow and ragged. I sped toward the lot’s exit, my hands gripping the wheel so hard my knuckles ached.Then I heard it—a low, rumbling engine. I glanced in the mirror. The van’s headlights flicked on, harsh and bright, and it pulled out, following me. My stomach dropped. I turned onto the coastal road, my car rattling over a speed bump. The van stayed behind, keeping pace, its headlights glaring like eyes in the dark. My phone was buried in my backpack on the passenger seat, next to my soggy towel. I reached over, digging through sunscreen tubes, a granola bar wrapper, and a pair of sunglasses until my fingers closed around it. The battery was at 18% now. I swiped to my contacts and called my friend Lisa, my eyes darting between the road and the mirror.“Pick up, pick up,” I whispered, my voice barely audible over the engine. The van was still there, maybe two car lengths back. Lisa answered on the third ring.“Hey, what’s up?” Her voice was light, like she was halfway through a snack.“Lisa, I’m freaking out,” I said, words spilling out in a rush. “There was this guy in the beach parking lot. He was acting so weird, blocking my car, saying creepy stuff. And now his van’s following me.”“What?” Her tone shifted, sharp and urgent. “Where are you right now?”“I’m on the coastal road, heading toward the highway,” I said. My voice cracked as I checked the mirror again. The van was closer now, its rusty grille filling the frame. “He asked if I needed a ride, kept getting in my way. I barely got in my car.”“Oh my gosh,” Lisa said, her voice tight. “I heard something about a creep hanging around that beach. Some guy in a van, bothering people. You need to get somewhere safe, like a gas station or something. I’m staying on the phone with you.”My hands were sweaty, slipping on the wheel. I took a sharp turn onto a side street, hoping to shake him. The van followed, its engine growling louder. My heart felt like it was going to burst through my chest. “Lisa, he’s still behind me,” I said, my voice shaking so bad I could barely get the words out. “What do I do?”“Keep driving,” she said, her voice steady but tense. “Head to the police station. It’s maybe ten minutes from there, near the old pier. I’m looking up the address now. Just stay calm and keep going.”I nodded, even though she couldn’t see me. The street was narrow, lined with shuttered beach houses and overgrown hedges. No one was around—no dog walkers, no joggers, just me and the van. I took another turn, then another, weaving through the maze of quiet roads. My tires squealed as I rounded a corner too fast, the car lurching. The van stayed close, its headlights flooding my car with light. I could almost feel his eyes on me, that same smirk from the parking lot.“Lisa, he’s not stopping,” I said, my voice barely a whisper. “He’s right there.”“Okay, listen,” she said. “There’s a busy intersection up ahead, near the gas station. Get there, blend into traffic. I’m not hanging up until you’re safe.”I spotted the intersection, a cluster of cars and streetlights up ahead. I gunned the engine, merging into the flow of traffic, cutting off a pickup truck that honked angrily. The van was still behind but got stuck behind a slow-moving SUV. I took a sharp left at the light, then a right, my heart pounding as I checked the mirror. The headlights were gone. I held my breath, waiting for them to reappear, but the road behind me stayed dark.“I think I lost him,” I said, my voice trembling. My hands were still shaking, my palms slick against the wheel.“Good,” Lisa said, exhaling. “But don’t stop. Get to the police station. I’m staying on.”I drove straight to the station, my eyes flicking to the mirror every few seconds. When I pulled into the lot, I parked under a bright floodlight, its harsh glow washing over my car. I sat there, engine still running, scanning for that rusty van. It didn’t show up. My hands were shaking so bad I could barely hold the phone. Lisa stayed on until I caught my breath, her voice a lifeline in the quiet.Inside the station, I spilled everything to a tired-looking officer behind a cluttered desk. I described the man’s greasy hair, his stained flannel, the way he’d blocked my door, the van’s dented license plate, the open side door with its pile of junk. My voice wobbled as I recounted how he’d followed me, his headlights like a predator’s eyes. The officer scribbled notes, her pen scratching loudly in the silent room. “We’ve had a few reports like this around that beach,” she said, her face grim. “Sounds like the same guy. We’ll send a patrol to check the lot and keep an eye out for that van.”I drove home, my hands still trembling, checking my mirrors every few seconds. That night, I couldn’t sleep. I kept seeing his smirk, hearing his gravelly voice, smelling that stale beer. I left my bedside lamp on, its soft light pushing back the shadows. The beach used to be my escape, a place to unwind, but now it felt tainted, like his presence had seeped into the sand and waves. I don’t park near the dunes anymore. I leave long before the lot empties, my keys always in hand, my phone fully charged. I walk fast, scanning for vans, for men who linger too long. That man’s still out there somewhere, and every time I drive by that beach, I feel his eyes on me, waiting.

  


# ""Rearview"":

I parked my minivan in the Town Center mall parking lot, just a short drive from the Boca Raton beaches where the ocean’s salty breeze always seemed to linger. It was August 2007, and my two-year-old son was strapped in his car seat in the back, clutching a shiny red toy truck I’d bought him at the mall’s toy store. His giggles filled the car, a small comfort after a long day of shopping. The trunk was stuffed with bags—new school clothes for him, a pair of sandals for me, a few groceries. Nothing out of the ordinary. The lot had been packed when I arrived hours ago, cars lined up in every row, but now, as the stores neared closing time, it was eerily quiet. Only a handful of vehicles remained, scattered far apart under the dim glow of the lot’s streetlights. My keys jingled as I unlocked the driver’s door, slid into the seat, and started to buckle my seatbelt, ready to head home to our small apartment.A faint click sounded from the backseat. My heart stuttered. I thought it was my son, maybe dropping his truck or playing with the car seat straps. I glanced in the rearview mirror, expecting his chubby cheeks and bright eyes. Instead, a man’s face stared back at me. He was sitting right behind me, next to my son’s car seat, his pale skin almost glowing in the dim light. A thin, jagged scar ran across his left cheek, puckered and angry, like it had been carved years ago. His eyes were dark, cold, unblinking, and a small black handgun rested in his lap, pointed at me through the gap between the front seats. My breath caught in my throat, and my hands froze on the steering wheel.“Don’t scream,” he said, his voice low and sharp, like a blade cutting through the air. “Start the car and drive.”My hands trembled so badly I could barely turn the key. My son babbled happily, waving his truck, oblivious to the man sitting inches from him. I wanted to turn around, to scoop him up and run, but the gun’s barrel glinted in the mirror, pinning me in place. My mouth went dry, and my voice came out as a whisper. “Please, don’t hurt us. He’s just a baby.”“Shut up,” he snapped, leaning closer. I could smell him now—cigarettes and something sour, like old sweat. “Drive to the ATM across the street. Do it now, or I start with the kid.”My stomach lurched. I fumbled with the gearshift, my fingers clumsy, and pulled out of the parking space. The lot stretched out around us, vast and nearly empty. The streetlights cast long, flickering shadows that seemed to shift as I drove, like they were alive, watching. A few cars were parked far off, their windows dark, no one inside. I scanned the lot desperately for a security guard, a late-night shopper, anyone who might notice something was wrong. But the mall’s glass doors were dark, the storefronts shuttered. It was just us, trapped in this concrete desert.“Why are you doing this?” I asked, my voice shaking as I turned onto the main road. I kept my eyes on the mirror, watching his face, watching the gun.“Don’t talk,” he said, his tone flat but heavy with threat. “You ask questions, you make this worse. Just drive.”I gripped the wheel tighter, my knuckles white. My son started singing to himself, a garbled little tune about his truck, and each note felt like a knife in my chest. I wanted to tell him it was okay, to comfort him, but I was afraid to speak, afraid to move wrong. The ATM was just across the street, a standalone machine in a gas station lot, its blue glow cutting through the darkness. I pulled up and stopped, my heart pounding so hard I thought it would burst.“Get out,” he said, nudging the gun against the back of my seat. “Take out five hundred dollars. All of it. And don’t try anything stupid.”I nodded, my hands shaking as I grabbed my purse from the passenger seat. My debit card was buried in my wallet, and I fumbled to find it, my fingers slipping. The machine’s screen lit up my face as I punched in my PIN, every beep sounding too loud, like it was announcing us to the world. I kept glancing around, praying for someone to pull into the lot, for a cashier to step outside the gas station. A police car cruised by on the main road, its red and blue lights flashing, and for a moment, hope surged in my chest. I thought about waving, screaming, anything to get their attention. But the man’s voice cut through my thoughts.“Don’t even think about it,” he said, his eyes locked on mine in the mirror. “You signal them, and your kid pays for it.”My hope crumbled. The police car disappeared around a corner, and I was alone again. I withdrew the cash, the machine spitting out bills that felt dirty in my hands. I climbed back into the car and handed them over, my fingers brushing his. His skin was cold, clammy, like touching something dead. He counted the money slowly, deliberately, then stuffed it into his jacket pocket.“Drive back to the mall,” he said, the gun still steady. “Park in the far corner, by the dumpsters.”I did as he said, my mind racing for a way out. The mall lot was even darker now, the lights flickering like they were about to die. The corner he chose was the worst part—hidden from the main road, far from the mall’s entrance, where the dumpsters sat in a shadowy cluster. No one would see us here. No one would hear us. My throat tightened as I remembered the news stories, whispers of women who vanished from this same mall. A young woman last spring, found dead miles away. Another mother and her daughter, just months later, tied up and gone. Was this him? The one the police were hunting? The thought made my skin crawl.“Stop here,” he said as we reached the corner. He pulled something from his pocket—zip ties, the kind you can’t break. “Hands behind your back.”“Please,” I begged, tears streaming down my face. “We did what you wanted. Just let us go.”“Quiet,” he said, his voice like ice. He reached over the seat, yanking my wrists together. The plastic ties dug into my skin, sharp and tight, cutting off circulation. My son started to whimper, his truck forgotten on the seat. “Mama?” he said, his voice small and scared.“It’s okay, baby,” I said, my voice breaking. “Mama’s here. We’re okay.” But I wasn’t sure I believed it. The man tied my hands so tightly I could feel my pulse throbbing against the plastic. He leaned back, his scar catching the faint light from a distant streetlamp, making it look like it was moving, alive.“Now listen,” he said, his face so close I could see the stubble on his jaw, the faint twitch in his lip. “You’re going to stay quiet. You tell anyone about this—cops, your husband, anyone—and I’ll know. I’ll be watching. I’ll find you. And I’ll find him.” He nodded toward my son, and my heart stopped. I pictured his tiny body, his trusting eyes, and a sob caught in my throat.He opened the back door and stepped out, his boots crunching on the loose gravel. For a moment, I thought he might turn back, might decide we weren’t worth letting go. But he just stood there, staring at me through the window, his eyes boring into mine. Then he turned and walked away, his figure blending into the shadows until he was gone, like he’d never been there at all.I sat frozen, my wrists burning, my son crying softly beside me. The parking lot was silent, but every sound—a creaking dumpster lid, a distant car engine—made my heart race. Was he really gone? Or was he hiding, watching, waiting for me to move? I imagined him behind every car, in every shadow, his scarred face lurking just out of sight. My breaths came in shallow gasps, and I fought the urge to scream.I twisted my hands, the zip ties cutting deeper with every move. My fingers went numb, but I kept pulling, desperate to get free. After what felt like hours, one tie loosened just enough for me to slip a hand out. My wrists were raw, bleeding, but I didn’t care. I reached back and unbuckled my son, pulling him into my lap. His little arms wrapped around me, his face buried in my chest, and I held him so tight I thought I’d never let go.I fumbled for my phone in my purse, my hands shaking so badly I dropped it twice. When I finally dialed 911, my voice was barely a whisper. “Help us,” I said. “Please, someone was in our car. He had a gun. We’re in the Town Center mall parking lot.”The police arrived, their flashing lights cutting through the darkness. They searched the lot, their flashlights sweeping over the dumpsters, the empty cars, the shadows. But he was gone. They asked me to describe him—pale, dark hair, that scar like a cruel signature across his face. I told them everything, even though he’d warned me to lie, to say he was someone else entirely. The officers exchanged looks, and one mentioned other cases, women who didn’t make it home from this same lot. “You’re lucky,” he said. The word felt like a slap. Lucky? I didn’t feel lucky. I felt like I’d stared into the eyes of death and barely escaped.Weeks later, I couldn’t stop seeing his face. I read about the others—Randi, a young woman taken from this lot in March, found dead in a ditch. Nancy and her little girl, Joey, bound and shot just months after my night. The police thought it was the same man, but they had no name, no face, just sketches that didn’t quite match. They never caught him. Every time I drove past a parking lot, I checked my mirrors, my heart racing. I locked my doors twice, three times, even in broad daylight. I saw him in every stranger’s glance, every flicker of shadow. My son forgot that night, his toy truck still on the floor of the car, but I never will. I still hear his voice, low and cold: I’ll be watching. And I wonder if he is.

  


# ""After the Storm"":

I pulled my rental car into the beach parking lot at Magen’s Bay, St. Thomas, the tires grinding against the loose gravel and sand. The lot was nearly deserted, a stark contrast to the usual crowds this beach drew. Hurricane Maria had torn through the U.S. Virgin Islands just days ago, leaving behind a mess of broken palm trees, scattered debris, and a heavy silence that pressed against my chest. I was here for my friend Hannah, who had vanished without a trace. Her car was found in this lot, and I couldn’t just sit at home waiting for news. I had to find her.Stepping out of the car, my sneakers sank into the sandy gravel, and a faint breeze carried the sharp scent of salt and seaweed. Hannah’s sedan sat alone, its silver paint dulled by a layer of dust and salt spray. The driver’s door was slightly ajar, as if someone had left in a hurry. I approached it cautiously, my heart thumping. Inside, her purse slumped on the passenger seat, its strap tangled around a water bottle. Her phone was still plugged into the charger, the screen dark but showing a faint crack across the corner. A half-eaten granola bar lay in the center console, wrapper crinkled. Why would she leave all this behind?“Hannah?” I called, my voice thin against the steady crash of waves from the beach beyond. No answer came, just the distant cry of a seagull and the rustle of palm fronds in the breeze. The lot felt too empty, too quiet, like it was holding its breath. I scanned the area, noting a few abandoned cars at the far end, their windows fogged with condensation. A single streetlamp flickered, casting weak shadows that seemed to shift when I wasn’t looking.I decided to search the beach. The path down was narrow, overgrown with weeds and littered with storm debris—splintered wood, clumps of seaweed, a child’s sandal half-buried in the sand. The water looked murky, churning with bits of plastic and branches, as if the hurricane had stirred up the ocean’s secrets. I walked along the shoreline, my shoes sinking into the wet sand, calling Hannah’s name every few steps. “Hannah! Are you here?” My voice echoed, unanswered, and the vastness of the beach made me feel small, exposed.Then, about fifty yards down, I spotted something caught in a pile of driftwood. My pulse quickened as I jogged toward it, kicking up sand. It was a piece of fabric, partially buried. I knelt, my fingers brushing away the gritty sand to reveal a woman’s shirt, pale blue, torn at the sleeve and stained with something dark—maybe mud, maybe something worse. My breath caught. It was Hannah’s shirt; I recognized the small embroidered flower near the collar, something she’d pointed out proudly when she bought it. Beside it, half-covered by sand, was her wallet. I dug it out, my hands trembling, and opened it to find her driver’s license, her face smiling back at me, frozen in time.“Hannah!” I shouted, spinning around, my eyes darting across the empty beach. The bushes lining the path rustled, and I froze, my heart pounding so hard I could feel it in my throat. “Who’s there?” I called, but the only response was the waves. I clutched the shirt and wallet, my mind racing. Had she been hurt? Taken? I couldn’t just stand here.I hurried back to the parking lot, my footsteps loud in the quiet. As I neared Hannah’s car, I saw a man standing beside it, his silhouette tall and imposing. He wore a faded security uniform, the kind you’d see at a resort, with a badge pinned crookedly to his chest. His face was shadowed, but his eyes caught the dim light, watching me closely.“Excuse me,” I said, trying to keep my voice steady despite the shake in my hands. “Do you know anything about this car? Or the woman who owns it?”He turned slowly, his boots scuffing the gravel. “I’m just checking the lot,” he said, his voice low, almost a growl. “There’s been looting since the hurricane. Dangerous to be out here alone.”“I’m looking for my friend,” I said, holding up the wallet. “Her name’s Hannah. This is her car, and I found her shirt and wallet on the beach.”His jaw tightened, and for a moment, his eyes flicked to the wallet, then back to me. “Hannah? Yeah, I heard about her. She was at the shelter up the road, volunteering. Haven’t seen her since the storm hit.”“Do you know where she might’ve gone?” I asked, my voice cracking.He shrugged, his expression unreadable. “Hard to say. The storm messed everything up. But I heard a report of a woman screaming near here during the hurricane. Couldn’t get to her with the winds. By the time anyone checked, no one was there.”A scream? My stomach lurched. “Was it her? Did anyone see anything?”He shook his head. “No one knows. Look, you shouldn’t stay here. People are desperate now, doing things they wouldn’t normally.”His words sent a chill through me, colder than the evening air. “I have to find her,” I said, my voice firm despite the fear clawing at me.He studied me for a long moment, then sighed. “I can take you to the shelter. Someone there might know more. I’ve got a golf cart for patrols.”I hesitated, glancing at his uniform, the badge glinting faintly. He seemed legitimate, but something about his stillness made me uneasy. Still, I needed answers. “Okay,” I said. “Let’s go.”We climbed into his golf cart, the seats creaking under our weight. As we drove along the coastal road, the headlights cut through the growing darkness, revealing cracked pavement and fallen branches. He spoke, his voice barely audible over the hum of the engine. “The hurricane was chaos. Winds over a hundred miles an hour, no power, no phones. People were stealing, fighting. Some just disappeared.”I gripped the edge of the seat, the wallet and shirt in my lap. “Did you see Hannah at all? Before she went missing?”He kept his eyes on the road. “Saw her once, at the shelter. She was handing out water bottles, talking to everyone. Seemed like she cared. But then the storm hit, and things got crazy.”We reached the shelter, a concrete community center packed with people. Cots lined the walls, covered with blankets and sleeping bags. The air smelled of sweat and instant coffee. Families huddled together, some whispering, others staring blankly. I found the woman in charge, Maria, standing near a table stacked with canned food.I showed her Hannah’s wallet. “Do you know her? She was volunteering here.”Maria’s face lit up with recognition, then clouded with worry. “Yes, Hannah! She was helping with food and blankets. Such a kind soul. But she left during the storm, said she needed to check her car—thought the windows were down. She never came back.”“Did anyone look for her?” I asked, my voice tight.Maria’s shoulders sagged. “The storm was too strong. Winds were tearing roofs off. We couldn’t go outside. When it passed, we searched the beach, the lot, everywhere. Nothing.”I swallowed hard, the shirt’s stains flashing in my mind. “I found her things on the beach. Her shirt was torn.”Maria gasped, her hand flying to her mouth. “Oh, no. That’s awful. We need to tell the police again, but they’re so busy with the recovery.”“I’m going back to the lot,” I said. “I might’ve missed something.”Maria grabbed my arm, her grip firm. “Please, be careful. There are bad people out there, taking advantage of the chaos.”I nodded, but my mind was already racing. Back at the parking lot, the sky had darkened to a deep indigo, the streetlamp now casting a sickly yellow glow. The lot felt like a trap, the shadows too deep, the silence too heavy. I searched Hannah’s car again, my flashlight beam bouncing off the dashboard. In the glove compartment, I found a folded map of the island, a red pen marking a route from the shelter to the beach, then to a spot deep in the hills. My hands shook as I traced the line. Why would she go there?I got into my car and followed the map, the road narrowing as it climbed into the jungle. Vines scraped the car’s sides, and the air grew thick with the smell of wet earth and rotting leaves. My headlights barely pierced the darkness, catching glints of animal eyes in the underbrush. After twenty minutes, I reached a crumbling house, its wooden walls sagging, windows boarded with splintered planks. The front door hung open, swaying slightly.I stepped out, my flashlight trembling in my hand. “Hannah?” I called, my voice barely above a whisper. The house loomed, its shadows swallowing the light. I pushed the door open, and it groaned, revealing a dusty interior. Furniture sat under moldy sheets, and cobwebs draped the corners like curtains. The air was stale, heavy with the scent of decay.A creak came from upstairs, slow and deliberate, like footsteps. My heart pounded, my mouth dry. “Hannah? Is that you?” I called louder, my voice echoing off the walls.No answer, but the footsteps moved again, heavier now, heading toward the stairs. I backed up, my flashlight beam darting across the room, catching glints of broken glass on the floor. Then, a faint voice, barely audible: “Help… me…”It was Hannah. I bolted up the stairs, my shoes thudding on the creaking wood. At the top, in a small room lit only by my flashlight, I found her—sprawled on the floor, wrists bound with rough rope, a dirty cloth gag hanging loose around her neck. Her face was pale, her eyes wide with fear, her clothes torn and streaked with dirt.I dropped to my knees, fumbling with the ropes. “Hannah, I’m here,” I said, my voice shaking. “You’re okay now.”She coughed, her voice hoarse. “He… he tricked me. Said his wife was hurt. I followed him here, but he tied me up, left me.”“Who?” I asked, freeing her hands. “Who did this?”“A man,” she whispered, her eyes darting to the doorway. “Wore a mask. He’s been watching me, I think. Since the shelter.”“We’re leaving,” I said, helping her stand. Her legs wobbled, and I supported her as we stumbled down the stairs, the house creaking around us like it was alive. Outside, I got her into my car, my eyes scanning the darkness. The jungle felt too close, the shadows too alive.As I started the engine, headlights flared behind us, bright and sudden. A car was parked at the edge of the clearing, silent until now. My stomach dropped. “Hold on,” I said, slamming the gas pedal.The car roared after us, its engine growling as it closed the gap. Hannah gripped the seat, her breathing ragged. “Is that him?” she whispered.“I don’t know,” I said, my hands tight on the wheel. The road twisted, branches scraping the car. The pursuing headlights grew brighter, the car swerving dangerously close. I caught a glimpse of the driver—a man, his face scarred, eyes gleaming with rage in the rearview mirror.He pulled alongside us, his car inches from mine. “Get down!” I shouted to Hannah as he jerked his wheel, trying to force us off the road. The drop on my left was steep, a black void into the jungle below. I swerved, tires screeching, but he rammed us, metal grinding against metal. The car lurched, skidded, and then we were falling, tumbling down the hillside. Glass shattered, the world spun, and everything went black.Pain woke me, sharp and throbbing in my ribs. I was slumped against the steering wheel, the dashboard lights flickering. Hannah was beside me, unconscious, blood trickling from a cut on her forehead. The car was tilted, wedged against a tree. Above us, flashlights swept the darkness, and voices shouted, “Over here! They’re down there!”Police and paramedics descended, their faces grim as they pried open the door. They lifted Hannah onto a stretcher, her eyes fluttering open as they worked. I stumbled out, my legs weak, the world tilting around me.At the hospital, a detective told me the man was a local criminal, known for targeting women during the hurricane’s chaos. Hannah’s description of his scarred face and the mask led to his arrest. She recovered slowly, her memory of that night fragmented, lost in the fog of fear and trauma.I still see those headlights in my dreams, feel the car lurching over the edge, hear the crunch of gravel under that man’s tires. The beach parking lot haunts me, its emptiness a reminder of how close we came to never coming back. But Hannah’s alive, and that’s the thread I hold onto, even as the terror lingers, sharp and unshakable, in the quiet corners of my mind.",1,1750474250.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

Adam laced up his shoes like it was the first day of the rest of his life. Because, in some ways, it was.

The morning light angled through the blinds just right… soft, blissful. The coffee steamed gently on the windowsill, but there was something better than summer or caffeine in the air today. Today, the world smelled like freedom.

Adam looked in the mirror before leaving his house. ""Never felt clearer,"" he said to his reflection.

He jogged through the neighborhood with fresh legs and a buoyant pace. Two months ago, he would’ve called this route “unproductive.” Now, it was an act of resistance. He was reclaiming himself. They hadn’t fired him, they’d freed him. Let the algorithms handle the spreadsheets and pivot tables. He was going to live.

As he turned the corner, a pink VW Beetle crawled past, windows down, a dusty speaker humming ‘*Strawberry Fields Forever’*. He grinned. Nostalgic choice. Maybe things were starting to loop back to human.

On his way back home, he waved at the neighborhood constant, the old man walking his golden retriever.

*Day 8*

Applied to seven jobs. One thanked him for his “unique perspective.” The others didn’t answer.

Still, one answer out of seven is a pretty good ratio these days. Adam’s optimism cautiously grew, almost as much as his journey in life. He was meditating, journaling, and cooking actual food. He was sleeping better and eating more slowly. For the first time in a long while, he felt like reaching the surface after too long underwater.

*Day 12*

Adam’s muscles hurt this morning, but to keep momentum, he decided to walk. *‘Don’t train the enemy*,*’* read a poster stapled to a telephone pole near the café. Been seeing more of these lately. Probably activist art. Maybe a punk band.

*Day 33*

Clicked submit on another application. A software company looking for *‘people-forward thinkers.’* He clicked and paused. A rejection pinged back in under five seconds.

“Damn Applicant Tracking Systems” he yelled out loud “Now we’re not even reviewing résumés anymore.”

Adam’s frustration was tempered by a song in the street.

*Living is easy with eyes closed*  
*Misunderstanding all you see*  
*It's getting hard to be someone, but it all works out*  
*It doesn't matter much to me*

Strawberry fields forever. The same pink VW Beetle passed too. He laughed out loud, alone at his window. ""Leave it to the Beatles to change the mood, right?"" he told the plant on his windowsill. It didn’t reply.

*Day 36*

Adam wandered into the community garden on a whim. There was a woman pulling weeds like they owed her money. Mid-forties, sun-lined, sharp eyes. She nodded at him. He nodded back.

“You’re new,” she said.

“I live down the block.”

“You just noticed this place?”

Adam smiled. “Trying to be more... rooted.”

She looked up, squinting. “Try throwing out the phone too. They make people forget what roots are.”

He crouched beside her. “Maybe gardening is something I should try for a new career.”

She snorted, laughing. “Want to help me plant the kale?”

They gardened in silence for a while. Dirt under fingernails. Real work.

She broke it. “Don’t train the enemy,” she said.

He froze. “Sorry?”

She just shrugged. “Think about it.”

*Day 53*

His mouse pointer hovered over the publish-button. It wasn’t fear, more like the feeling you get when saying something out loud for the first time, knowing you can’t pull the words back once they land. He clicked.

The blog was called *‘Soft Reset.’* His first entry was quiet rage in lowercase. A confession. A manifesto.

*They replaced us with talking puppets.*

*I don’t want to be efficient. I want to be real. Human.*

*Don’t train the enemy!*

The post got 218 likes. Mostly anonymous.

Comments like:

“You said what I couldn’t.”

“Keep going. You're not alone.”

“Don’t train the enemy.”

*Day 83*

The protest was half poetry reading, half primal scream. A circle of the disillusioned and the defiant. Someone handed him a sign.

It read: *‘Don’t train the enemy’*

The march passed the community garden. The woman he met earlier was there. Tending to a flowerbed no one else noticed. She didn’t look at him. Just as he moved to say hi, he was met with a sight that had become all too familiar. Something he had come to think of as a neighborhood talisman, the pink VW Beetle.

It rolled slowly behind the crowd. Strawberry Fields Forever drifted faintly above the chants. He smiled and looked proudly at all these people. United in opinion, united in humanity.

*Day 97*

Something burned in him today. He had long given up sending résumés. That energy had turned into thinly veiled frustration and was about to reach ignition.

The march pulsed forward. Adam was in front. Fueled by chants, he felt empowered, invincible. He didn’t notice the pink Beetle behind them.

Someone pushed. He grabbed a heavy signpost, stepped forward, and threw it toward the local shop’s window.

As the post was hurtling through the air, it felt like time slowed down. Milliseconds felt like hours, until… blackness.

There was no shattering window when there should have been.

There were no chants anymore

There was… Strawberry Fields Forever.

*Let me take you down*  
*'Cause I'm going to strawberry fields*  
*Nothing is real*  
*And nothing to get hung about*  
*Strawberry fields forever*

1lgltce,https://i.redd.it/bnq5c95uy68f1.jpeg,Excessive Grease removal from Brew Group using Dishwasher! Who greases the o-rings!? Why?,"I got the Gaggia magenta prestige from whole latte love, and even in Gaggia Milano’s YouTube video on lubricating the magenta it looks like the unit has grease on the brew group. But they don’t ever grease the brew piston o-ring like whole latte love does and shows in their videos. My brew group was excessively greased, and I have been having headaches after coffee with this machine. And I realized all the petroleum grease everywhere is in my coffee.

Also I want to say whole latte love was amazing and I’m very grateful for my machine! Thank you! But also all of the user manuals and official videos from Phillips, Saeco and Gaggia all only say to apply grease to the slides, shaft and group piston. Nothing on the o-rings. Also even Gaggia UK made a video showing grease on all the areas water and coffee contact and I’m like that’s a No Go for me!

I actually ordered the Verdana Coconut Grease to replace the petroleum. And if it spreads at all by chance then it won’t be toxic — literally says it on the bottle.

Do you all grease your o-rings and points of contact with water and coffee? 

This is the official Gaggia Milano video showing no o-rings — but it looks like the group is kind of greasy.
https://youtu.be/M51Q4Mpovcs?si=lZQ8Phorewm_qo7i

Do you all think your brew group should be sticky and greasy all over? Does the grease spread during use?

This is the Gaggia UK video showing grease of everything 
https://youtu.be/R2a8gbuPJGI?si=KSvaNwjHMwYbLSKU

This is Whole Latte Love’s video showing grease of piston, slides, but no piston or shaft.
https://youtu.be/HGmfnGN_JQA?si=zV1hcAIPNt6NEGEC

What do you all think? I feel like the o-ring will lubricate just fine with the coffee residuals. And be a cleaner healthier coffee.

Also my brew group is in the dishwasher, with detergent!!!! I know I know! Anyone else do or done this? Have you ever even tried… not all the time, but if it’s truly gross and covered with grease and I can’t remove it after constant cleaning with rubbing alcohol and then detergent, I just put it the dishwasher. And actually pulled it out half way, and wiped it down really good again to get even more of the grease off.

And then after this I won’t ever need to do this deep clean and removal or grease.",1,1750472962.0,superautomatic,11,0.57,False

What is causing the spikes in my electricity usage kWh both when I am in the house as well as when I am away. I have noticed every morning in the hour from  8am there is a spike in usage. I've put some consecutive days data below.  

nb A = away H = at home

1.74kWh (A); 1.81kWh (A); 1.45kWh (A); 1.24kWh (A); 1.26kWh (H); 2.00kWh (H); 2.35kWh (H)

  
Details

* Solar system (7.48KW; no battery)
* Taylex Treatment plant (I live on an island)
* electric hot water system/fridge
* TV coffee maker turned off but not at the power point
* Starlink - modem and battery
* NO airconditioining 

Im sure there is a simple answer that relates to perhaps how the Taylex works or the settings for the electric hot water heater  but I am interested in people's thoughts.

I’m just afraid to hike alone as a single female, and I’m afraid of bears (probably unfounded as people have told me I most likely won’t run into a bear out there). Sorry for the long post.

It gives me headache if I wore the bag. I place crumpled up newspaper inside the bag and added several sacks of baking soda in it. (I used tied up coffee filters as sacks. I already let it sit in the sun all day but the smell wouldn’t go away. I wiped it with leather cleaner and conditioner. The smell is still powerful. ,3,1750472690.0,handbags,2,1.0,False

I've been divorced for 6 years and have dated a little here and there.  But I just haven't  had any luck.  I did have a wonderful match 2 years ago that lasted 6 months and then he decided it was getting too serious so he ended it.  We are still good friends and probably border on more, only because of the strong connection and the way we still flirt super hard.  But it is never going to be more. Never 
That being said, I seem to have a physical type I am attracted to.  But that type, so far, has always turned out to have a very  different set of values,  and likes than I do.  A family member pointed out that I really need to change things up.  So I tried.   I matched with someone (OLD) that was the same age and seemed pretty cool.  He was also pretty cute.   We've been out twice now.  First, I'm pretty sure his most recent picture was at least 10 years old.  I'm not trying to be shallow, but that's a bit deceptive.  All mine are recent.  But I wanted to try anyway because he's funny and nice and seems patient.  The dates have been simple, which is totally ok.  Dessert once, coffee once.  He doesn't drink at all.  I am not a heavy drinker but I like one now and then.  He's the logical type, Im more of a creative type.  Our politics and values match perfectly.  He's a great conversationalist as well.  So far it's been a hug good night each time.  I'd be ok with a kiss, but tbh, I'm not sure if there is any attraction.  I'm trying so hard to find it and I keep thinking maybe it just takes time.   We've been talking for three weeks.  But I also want to feel some passion.  I am set to meet my friend/ex on Sunday afternoon to tell him that I have to back off because I think, it may be causing me to disregard anyone else.  Real truth is that if I'm around HIM for 5 minutes I get butterflies and flushed.  But then I get frustrated because he will flirt like crazy but has zero intention of anything more than friends and I know that.  He's said it verbally and shown me and I've accepted it.  But Why can't I feel that way about this person I went on a date with.  It would be amazing to have that zing for someone who might actually feel it back.

Not with thirst. Not with drama.

*“I miss being touched without being stripped. Your words felt like home.”*

That’s it. Simple. Honest.  
And it hit deeper than any nude ever could.

I didn’t rush to reply. Not to play games.  
But because something that real deserves attention — not a quick emoji.

And what followed was a slow burn.  
Not sexts. Not kinks. Not roleplay.

Late-night chats about loneliness.

She didn’t wear makeup. No drama.  
Just a mustard yellow kurti, kajal half-worn from the sun, hair tied in a bun.  
She looked like someone who had been through life — and still carried softness in her.

I had made filter coffee, strong and sweet.

No Netflix. Just an old Ilaiyaraaja tape playing in the corner.

I nodded.

1lglo1e,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1lglo1e/do_i_23m_end_things_with_my_fiancé_22m_after/,Do I (23M) end things with my fiancé (22M) after finding out he’s been flirting with his co worker again after previously finding out and discussing the boundary overstep/consequences?,"So around a week before my birthday in April, I noticed that my fiancé was being very secretive with his phone. This was something he’d never done before and from past relationships I somewhat saw red flags about it. As a result I decided to read through his messages, to which initially there was no suspicious messages. The next day, he continued with the secretive behaviour and even quickly swiped off his Instagram DM’s when I walked behind him. I even remarked that he was giggling like a schoolgirl messaging her boyfriend to which he replied very defensively. At this point I was incredibly suspicious and decided to log into his Instagram on my phone and have the occasional look. 

The following day while at work, I saw messages coming from a man who I recognised he worked with, and they were incredibly flirtatious describing sexual acts, to which my fiancé was encouraging and engaging with. I confronted him with this and he was upfront about the ordeal and said this had been an incredibly uncomfortable situation as he felt very forced into a situation with him as he is considerably older. We decided to work at the relationship and trust especially considering I had gone through his messages (which I was not proud of and didn’t want to do again)

Since then we have been constantly up and down, we have since moved house, I have finished my degree and started a new job. To say that we’ve been busy and stressed is an understatement. I had a brief period of working my previous job while also working my new job, meaning straight after moving into our new house I had to work around 16 days without a day off and pulling shifts at both workplaces meaning I’ve barely had time to sleep let alone anything else, I finally had yesterday off which I spent doing mostly housework and errands that I’d put off, today was my relaxing day off. My fiancé calls after finishing work and suggests going for a drink after work and enjoy the nice weather, which I suggest enjoying that at home with some beers to try and save money (we’re going on holiday soon and as I’ve started my new job, this holiday is unpaid) to which he impressed about going out. I did not respond in the greatest way and said it seemed like a waste of money when we could easily do this at home. He came home and seemed very distant. I also began to notice he was hiding his phone again. When he went to the toilet and left his phone I did for the first time since the past incident look through his messages, I found a locked WhatsApp conversation that opened straight away (he has my Face ID on his phone) showing a bunch of messages he’d been sending moments prior to the same co-worker, calling him handsome and baby and that he really wanted to see him tomorrow (while I was at work, and he’d originally told me he was going to a coffee shop on his own for some quiet time to himself). 

When I confronted him about it, there was a lot said, but his reasoning was mainly to say that he felt very isolated, neglected and alone the last couple of months. He also said that he feels that he can talk to this co-worker easier as he is not as reactive as myself, and he gets scared to approach me with certain things. When he told me this, I immediately apologised as I know I can react quite big and have tried to focus on working on this but I had no knowledge that it was this bad. He said he didn’t want to bring it to me as he was too scared, which I understand. He also said that he had no intentions of having a relationship or anything romantic with the co-worker, just finds that he can talk to him about certain things easier. 

While I understand that I have played a massive role in this, and feel incredibly regretful that I’ve made this situation, I am conflicted on where to go from here. When talking about potentially working through this and our future, he was very concerned about keeping his friendship with this co-worker but stated he wanted to do whatever to keep our relationship going. Do I work at things like the last time or do I call time on our relationship?

posted this here because I really want to find someone (or THE someone) out there who shares a lot of interests with me, involved in some fandoms, and maybe someone who is a little creative and likes to create, share, and write (even though this post doesn’t look the best LMAO) im looking for someone who is willing to connect and hopefully build a strong and solid relationship together!  🖤

a little about me! 🦭
- im usually online a lot, especially during the mornings in which I don’t have work but in the afternoon I will be online all of the time, i use other apps as my main methods of communication!
-i have a job as a cook, i work in a kitchen making food and whatnot so i won’t always be online 24/7 but i like to make time for people that are important! like those who like to communicate and interact 
- i love animals, especially seals! a few that I like are puffins, cats, and birds!
- im usually a very passive person who doesn’t like to initiate any sort of conflict. im not a very competitive person, i like to have fun generally! i have a lot of emotions and i like to use them for the greatest, and I like to dwell on what i am feeling most of the time instead of taking it out on something else, i like to talk about my emotions though sometimes i feel like i have a hard time expressing them, not just to myself but to other people. if you’re the type of person who is going through something, id love to listen and hear your thoughts!
- i like to party up with a few friends of mine most of the time and talk about video games and such, connecting with others and building friendships are one of the things that are the most important to me!

things i love to do! 
- one of my favorite things to do is to write, and if you like to write too then we will get along well! i write a lot about characters from video games, sometimes from movies too. i like to be inspired by video games or movies or books and media to come up with stories for characters, i love to make lore about headcanons for characters like from some of the games down below. maybe we can share some stories of ours and write something together? 
- i like to play video games a lot in my free time, like a lot a lot! some of the games i like to play with others are fortnite and roblox, and some that are single player that i love to play are fallout, Farcry, cyberpunk, terraria, borderlands, and minecraft as well! i play on a ps5, if you were wondering!

- i love sharing memes and videos and such that i find funny, usually skits or edits!
- i like movies! probably my favorite movie of all time is tron!

that pretty much sums it up so if you want to send me a chat or dm feel free to message me! i can give you my socials and we will see from there!
