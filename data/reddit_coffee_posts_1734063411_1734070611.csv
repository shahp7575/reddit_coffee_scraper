1hd6164,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1hd6164/relentless_chaos/,Relentless Chaos,"The air in the mess hall of the ISS *Relentless* was thick with the smell of burnt coffee and stale protein bars. The crew had been running on fumes for weeks, and morale was lower than a slug’s belly. But that was before the humans arrived.

""So, these are the humans everyone’s been whispering about?"" Sergeant Myra G’lar of the Thalaxian Vanguard muttered, her four eyes narrowing as she watched the human contingent file into the room. Clad in mismatched armor that looked more scavenged than issued, they carried themselves with a swagger that bordered on arrogance.

One of them, a stocky man with a crooked grin, approached the nearest table. His armor was scrawled with graffiti—a crude stick figure giving a thumbs-up and the phrase ""Never tell me the odds."" He slammed down a metal crate and grinned. ""Alright, who wants to lose their rations in a game of 'Slapstick'?""

""What’s Slapstick?"" a curious Elvari engineer asked, his iridescent feathers fluffing up.

""Simple,"" the human said, pulling out a deck of cards. ""You slap the deck, you stick to the rules, and if you lose, you owe me a week of coffee credits.""

""You’re insufferable,"" Myra grumbled, but her tone betrayed curiosity.

By the time the humans were done teaching the mess hall their absurd card game, the *Relentless* crew was laughing harder than they had in months. Even Myra cracked a smile, though she’d deny it later.

And then the alarms sounded.

""Attention! Hostile fleet incoming! All hands to battle stations!"" The shipwide announcement cut through the laughter like a blade. The humans were the first on their feet.

""Finally,"" muttered the leader of the group, a woman named Captain Riley Stokes. She adjusted the strap on her rifle. ""I was getting bored.""

The enemy was the Raxak Coalition, a coalition of hive-minded insectoids notorious for their overwhelming numbers and relentless tactics. They had laid siege to Andron Prime for months, and now they were coming for the *Relentless*. The crew’s orders were simple: hold the line.

As the Raxak ships descended, the humans—officially designated as ""Advisors"" but informally known as ""those lunatics"" by the rest of the galaxy—took charge. They didn’t wait for orders. Instead, they marched straight to the front lines.

""What’s the plan, Captain?"" Myra asked, reluctantly following them to the bridge.

Riley grinned. ""Simple. We hit ‘em where it hurts.""

""Their central hive ships are heavily shielded. No way to break through,"" Myra pointed out.

""Oh, we’re not breaking through,"" Riley said. ""We’re getting in.""

The plan was madness. The kind of madness only humans could think up. Using a decoy maneuver that involved a stolen Raxak drone, a few dozen pounds of high-grade explosives, and what Riley referred to as ""classic misdirection,"" the humans infiltrated the hive ship.

Inside, the Raxak were disoriented. They had never encountered anything like humans before—creatures who didn’t rely on centralized command, who thrived in chaos, and who, despite all odds, seemed to be enjoying themselves.

""They’re...laughing?"" Myra whispered, horrified, as she watched the humans mow down waves of insectoids while cracking jokes over their comms.

""Hey, Jenkins,"" Riley called out. ""What do you call a Raxak with no legs?""

""What?""

""A speed bump!""

The humans erupted in laughter as the sound of gunfire and explosions filled the corridors.

The hive ship’s labyrinthine interior wasn’t just a battlefield; it was a playground for human ingenuity and sheer audacity. One squad, led by Jenkins, rigged a makeshift EMP from salvaged Raxak tech and short-circuited an entire wing of drones. Another group, cornered in a narrow corridor, used adhesive grenades to glue incoming reinforcements to the walls, turning the passage into an insectoid gallery.

Riley’s team reached the central command chamber, only to find it guarded by a towering Raxak warform—a monstrosity of chitin and bio-plasma cannons. The creature let out a deafening screech, its armored bulk advancing like a juggernaut.

""That’s new,"" Myra muttered, her weapon trembling in her hands.

Riley smirked. ""Relax. It’s just big, ugly, and in the way.""

The humans sprang into action, coordinating without hesitation. While Jenkins distracted the warform with a barrage of incendiary rounds, another human tossed a satchel charge directly onto its back. The explosion rocked the chamber, and the beast staggered, its plasma cannons misfiring wildly.

""That’s our cue,"" Riley said, darting forward. She slid under the creature’s legs, planting an explosive at the base of its spine. As she rolled clear, the charge detonated, and the warform collapsed in a heap, its death throes shaking the floor.

""You’re insane,"" Myra said, her voice a mix of awe and disbelief.

""Told you,"" Riley replied, casually reloading her weapon. ""Now, let’s blow this place to hell.""

The escape was no less chaotic than the assault. The hive ship’s self-defense mechanisms activated, sealing bulkheads and flooding sections with corrosive gas. The humans navigated the chaos with infuriating ease, their laughter echoing over the comms.

""Jenkins, how’s that override coming?"" Riley asked as they reached a sealed hatch.

""Almost there! Keep your pants on!""

""I’m not wearing pants, Jenkins.""

The hatch hissed open just as a swarm of drones closed in. The humans laid down suppressive fire, retreating through the passageway as explosions rippled behind them. By the time they reached the extraction point, the entire hive ship was on the verge of collapse.

As the team boarded their stolen Raxak shuttle, Myra glanced back at the inferno consuming the hive ship. ""You know, you’re all completely insane.""

""You keep saying that,"" Riley said with a grin, ""but I think you’re starting to like it.""

The hive ship erupted in a spectacular fireball, scattering the remaining Raxak forces. The crew of the *Relentless* cheered as the enemy fleet retreated.

Back on the *Relentless*, the humans celebrated with their peculiar brand of camaraderie, regaling the rest of the crew with exaggerated tales of their exploits. Myra found herself laughing along, despite herself.

""You know,"" she said, raising a glass of Thalaxian ale, ""you humans might just be the craziest species in the galaxy.""

Riley grinned. ""Damn right. And don’t you forget it.""

The crew erupted in cheers, and for the first time in weeks, the *Relentless* felt unstoppable.

Weeks after the siege, Andron Prime’s government extended an official invitation to honor the *Relentless* crew for their bravery. The humans, naturally, arrived late to the ceremony, still wearing their mismatched armor and grinning like they owned the galaxy.

During the proceedings, a young diplomat from the Solarian Confederation—humanity’s official galactic body—took the stage to deliver a speech. ""Ladies and gentlemen, and esteemed beings of all species,"" she began, her voice steady despite the grandiosity of the event. ""Today, we celebrate not just a victory, but a demonstration of the unbreakable spirit that unites us.""

Riley leaned over to Myra, whispering, ""You think they’re gonna mention the speed bump joke?""

Myra rolled her eyes, but she couldn’t suppress a smirk. ""If there’s any justice in the universe, no.""

As the diplomat continued, detailing the strategic brilliance of the battle, Riley’s comm unit buzzed. She answered it discreetly, her grin widening as she listened. ""Well, looks like our next job’s lined up. Something about a pirate fleet harassing trade routes.""

""More bugs?"" Jenkins asked from across the room.

""Nah, something worse,"" Riley said. ""Humans who’ve forgotten how to have fun.""

The crew groaned good-naturedly, already gathering their gear as the ceremony continued. Myra watched them go, shaking her head.

""You’re leaving already?"" she asked Riley.

""The galaxy’s a big place,"" Riley replied with a wink. ""And it’s not gonna save itself.""

As the humans left, Myra couldn’t help but feel a pang of admiration. Crazy, chaotic, and utterly unpredictable, they were unlike any species she’d ever known. And she was starting to think the galaxy might be better off for it.

*That night, as the Relentless crew toasted to their next adventure, the humans’ laughter echoed through the ship. And for the first time in centuries, Andron Prime’s skies were free of enemies.*

1hd5uqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1hd5uqe/tifu_by_trusting_my_husband/,TIFU by trusting my husband,"Every year around Christmas, it is a tradition on my side of the family to make carrot cookies. They are exactly what they sound like. I could probably make sugar cookies with the carrots removed from the recipe; first you have to boil a bunch of carrots and mash them, and depending on how much mashed carrots there are you can multiply the recipe. I had a flat 2 cups mashed carrots, so in order to double it, the recipe has 4 cups flour, 2 cups sugar, 2 cups Crisco, along with eggs, vanilla, baking powder, and salt. This made exactly 4 dozen cookies. 

This is perfect! My grandmother is old and shaky and can't make them, and my mother has had fingers amputated and also could burn air in an oven, so this year the cookie making and shipping fell to me. I made my 48 cookies last night. I did this completely solo because my husband works 11a-11p on and I slept in as I had yesterday off, so we did not bake them together.

I packed up one dozen last night, and once the other 36 were done, I sampled one for quality control purposes. The remaining 35 stayed on my cookie cooling racks until this morning. 

When I woke up at the too-early time of 6 am, I decided I needed a coffee and a cookie. My husband says that he heard me eating one and decided he wanted to wake up and eat one as well. This brings us to 33 cookies. This is fine, I planned to send one dozen to my parents and two to my grandparents, leaving one dozen for us. It was weird that my husband woke up so early, but I enjoyed the company. 

I asked my husband to at least bag the cookies while I went to work so that they wouldn't get super hard before I could ship them. I didn't even care if they were separated, I just didn't want them to get harder. He agrees, saying he's going to take a shower first, gives me a kiss, and off to work I go. 

And it is at this time in my story that I can tell you about Archer. Archer is my dog. He is allegedly a 100% Australian cattle dog, but he is 65lbs lean and stands a good three inches taller than my mom's cattle dog. He is the single most food motivated dog I have ever met. He came into our lives because he was hit by a car, and I work at a vet clinic, and his owners surrendered him to me when they couldn't afford his care. Even though he had 6 facial fractures and a shattered tooth, this dog was extremely happy to eat food with no pain meds on board. He has swallowed (and somehow, miraculously, passed) a squeaker. If I can hype it up enough, this dog will take pills with no treat around them. 

On the Fourth of July, I came home to find his head stuck in his food bag and my husband in the shower. After this, I proceeded to yell at him (not loudly enough, apparently) that if I'm not home, and he wants to take a shower, then he absofuckinglutely has to put Archer in the crate. He is crate trained very well because this dog will do almost anything for food. It's not hard. Wave a treat and say ""crate"" and he's off to the races. 

My fuck up today comes from the fact that I had trusted my husband not to make his mistake again. And let me tell you, I am extremely wrong. 

I did come home to the cookies in a bag. But since I came home from work today, Archer has been unusually gassy. I sent my husband a text that basically said ""he has farted 10 times in 90 minutes and I think I'm gonna die lol"". This is a solid 12+ hours since I left for work. He proceeds to call me and essentially say ""Archer may have had a cookie"". I was like.....""what the fuck do you mean?!"" And my dearly beloved husband proceeds to tell me, ""well I took my shower and when I came out there were cookies all over the ground and he was in the kitchen. I don't know if he actually ate any though""

I proceed to rip open that bag and count cookies. Archer is diligently sitting next to me as if I am going to aid in his bullshit. I counted once. I even counted twice. I have 23 cookies. 

My husband confirmed he did not eat any more cookies after I left and also confirmed he didn't take any to work. 

So now my dearly beloved dog gets to come to work with me tomorrow so I can monitor him since my dearly beloved husband obviously cannot, and my dearly beloved husband gets to hear me scream at him that he will kill this dog if he showers without crating him again. I am still dealing with the aftermath of his farts, and it is up in the air if he will actually get sick from this or not. 

TL;DR: I made a bunch of carrots cookies and asked my husband to bag them. Instead, my husband took a shower and my dog ate 10 cookies and my husband waited 12 hours to tell me.

1hd5pu6,https://www.reddit.com/r/U2Band/comments/1hd5pu6/song_of_the_week_in_gods_country/,Song of the Week - In God's Country,"This week’s song of the week is [In God’s Country](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tHLh4fkx9I) from the Joshua tree album. It was released as the album’s fourth single (only in North America) and an abridged version recorded in Denver, Colorado was included in the *Rattle and Hum* movie.

Musically, the song contains a strong, interesting bass-line and powerful drums, giving the track a fairly straightforward “rock-and-roll” rhythm. This quality was one of the reasons it was included on the album as the band wanted to balance its more atmospheric and mysterious tracks with classic rock-and-roll energy.

The Edge’s main riff is both powerful and fast, accompanied by notes that feel like splashes on a canvas—each carefully chosen to accentuate and add depth to the piece. A shimmering quality permeates the track, something fans and critics alike admire. Daniel Lanois credits this shimmering effect as one of his key contributions to the album:

>“It's almost another side of what I do. I keep treatments available on the console all the time. There's like a bank of twelve or sixteen channels that are designated to treatments, and that's all they do…It's like tinting an existing photograph or having a photograph and increasing the contrast. In a lot of cases I have given new life to a track with these treatments.”

One such track is In God's Country off The Joshua Tree.

>""The guitar now has a beautiful shimmer which has a lot to do with the mood of the track. What was a fairly straightforward rock track is now undermined by a mood of unrest; not all is well. It supplied Bono with new inspiration. It gave him a clue to modify his lyrics and give the track a greater dimension.” (Music Technology interview)

The composition is a bit of a sore spot with the band. Adam expresses that the song was difficult to get right while Edge is blunter in his criticism:

>“I don't think 'In God's Country' was ever going to be one of our best tunes but we needed a few up-tempo songs, so it was useful at the time. Some songs are just better than others.” (U2 by U2)

Bono seems to agree somewhat, discussing how the tried to motivate the Edge by writing a riff for the song and then acting like he was a better guitarist than Edge. In the end, Bono concludes that his lyrics, despite the lack of polish from the Edge, were “very good”,

>“He (the Edge) would say, 'It's not very good.' He's told me it was crap. ‘Now I'm going to have to make sure it's good’ What I really want him to do is to come up with something better, I don't want to have to be depending on this. The lyric was really good, the tune is pretty good, and the hook is pretty average - thanks to The Edge. (U2 by U2)”

Bono is, as for the whole album, on fire both with his singing and writing, which obviously contributes to the song’s beauty.

“Desert sky, dream beneath the desert sky.  
The rivers run but soon run dry.  
We need new dreams tonight.”

We open with the “dream” idea which connects to the song as a kind of spiritual vision. A need for rest and restoration which comes “like a drug”. This duality—of yearning for renewal and grappling with disillusionment—is a recurring theme:

“Desert rose, dreamed I saw a desert rose  
Dress torn in ribbons and bows  
Like a siren she calls (to me).”

The narrator dreams of a Desert rose, a woman, adorned by ribbons and bows, whose dress is torn—expressing beauty and ragged, down-trodden vulnerability. Bono has described the rose as an image of the American Dream, epitomized and symbolized by the Statue of Liberty. Yet, there’s an ambivalence:

>“There are not enough dreams. In ‘In God's Country’ I was talking about -- I didn't know whether I was writing about Ireland or America for a while.  Eventually I dedicated the song to the Statue of Liberty.” (Timothy White's Rock Stars 1987)

The American dream, visualized, if you like, in the Statue of Liberty. Bono wonders,

>“\[Has\] this woman come to rescue you from drowning or whatever, or is she the siren that’s actually drawing you onto the rocks?” (U2 The Definitive Biography)

This tension in Bono’s thoughts about America is present throughout the album, most directly and strikingly in Bullet the Blue Sky. The dream of liberty is beautiful and addicting, but fraught with contradictions. She is depicted as beautiful, but ragged and dirty. She is seen as seductive, but duplicitous. Energetic and passionate, but old and past her time.

“Sleep comes like a drug in God's country  
Sad eyes, crooked crosses, in God's country”

The “American Dream” is fueled by passion, coffee, and Marlboro reds, leaving its people wanting for sleep which, when it comes, envelops them like a sedative. “Sad eyes and Crooked Crosses” represent the tired and desperate masses while crooked crosses zeroes in on the dark side of American Christian idealism, wherein right-wing extremists and televangelists use “Godly” ideas to gain power and money (a bit of Dylanesque “With God On Our Side” theme). Despite this, I don’t think the song condemns the idea that America is “God’s country” totally, though it cautions the association of any set of beliefs or ideology with “Godliness”. In the end, Bono claims, rather than being united in Godliness and ideology, it is in desperation that we find true common-ground.

Bono: 

>“I wanted to write about America and you know... the dream.  The American dream.  And I wonder: where are the people that will rise to the challenge?  Y'know, where are the new dreamers?  I think I was talking about at the time, you know, all these people saying (adopts American accent) ""I'm a Marxist-Leninist, man"" or y'know, ""I'm into Reagan, Reaganomics""... These are all old, these are old ideologies, they're old, and I thought, put off the old, put on the new.  Where are the new dreams -- where's the new dreamers?  And ""we need new dreams tonight"" is the line.  I wonder where they are.  I want to see them.” (Timothy White's Rock Stars)

...

>“I have this feeling of starting over, that things have reached their end,” he says after a pause, “and also this notion that while people always talk about being joined in common wants and aspirations, I’m finding the reverse. Finding we’re united in desperation. I dunno, I come back to that line from our song “In God’s Country”: ‘We need new dreams tonight.’ The job is to dream up a world you’d want to live in.” (Mother Jones interview)

Bono does offer Nicaragua as a counterpoint to this general dearth of new ideas in the Americas at large, “Except in Nicaragua,” he says looking back. “That's why the revolution there was so important.” (Into the Heart)

“Set me alight, we'll punch a hole right through the night.  
Every day the dreamers die to see what's on the other side.  
She is liberty, and she comes to rescue me.  
Hope, faith, her vanity  
The greatest gift is gold.”

Again, there is this dual-aspect of this American fly-by-night energy—It is inspiring, it “sets one alight” so they can “punch a hole right through the night”. But the dreamers die and see something else, perhaps something darker (hence sad eyes and crooked crosses). She is liberty, characterized by hope and faith, but also by vanity—the greatest gift is gold. These ideas, at the founding of America, were seen as new, vital, and revolutionary, but now are seen as ideology which, like others, is tainted by selfish human drives and borders on idolatry. The total image of the statue of liberty, then, for all her beauty, is ultimately discredited. Her dress has been torn and she is aging—but her flame, the passionate yearning of the people who preceded the “American project” and is at least potentiated by those that are still living, still burns bright and is genuine cause for inspiration.

“Naked flame, she stands with a naked flame  
I stand with the sons of Cain  
Burned by the fire of love  
Burned by the fire of love.”

This becomes sort of codified with the ending, where the naked flame (representing the paradoxical rawness, youth, and purity of America) is characterized, ultimately, as a kind of love. Love which is burning, in both its destructive and renewing aspects. Bono says he “stands with the sons of Cain” which is a somewhat controversial statement from the standpoint of a Christian band, as the sons of Cain are historically associated with evil in literature, such as Grendel in ""Beowulf"". It is a trope to describe a person who has inherited, and so is ""naturally"", evil. In the Bible, Cain was “burned”/branded by God for killing Abel.

If the statue of liberty is like our ideas of God (characterized by love and passion, but also the danger to burn and deflower), then the sons of Cain are critics of American politics (like U2 in Bullet the Blue Sky) and foreigners to the American bloodline. Bono stands with them because they need people to, and Bono feels more like them than a true-believer in the ""American project"" as symbolized not only by the Statue of Liberty, who is already seen as imperfect, but attempts at global hegemony which has caused great destruction (more thoroughly explored in Bullet the Blue Sky). 

These ""sons of Cain"" are also the American people, at large, who are not idealogues but are burned by their passion and yearning. Burned by the ideas which ride on ""crooked crosses"", characterized by ""sad eyes"". These same people that, at their most desperate (like Cain himself) can be driven to murder and make war for the passion of their ideas. However, he recognizes, too, the powerful, passion and the beautiful, fiery love that the people have, and their yearning for ""new dreams"" which are potentiated by the flame and “fire of love”.

The fire of love burns with both passion and danger, embodying the contradictions of America itself. Ultimately, the song is a meditation on renewal, ambition, and the enduring complexities of faith and freedom.

My daily routine is just going to work, coming home, and sleeping, but I know I want something different.
I’ve tried exploring other things like stocks and dropshipping, but I couldn’t stick to them. I either lost interest or felt too lazy to continue. I struggle to commit to one thing, and it makes me feel like I lack direction.
I’ve even taken some career choice quizzes and MCQs, but the results didn’t match my actual interests at all, which only made me feel more uncertain. Everyone around me seems settled in their careers, and when I compare myself to them, I feel demotivated. My parents are pushing me to pursue another degree, but I hesitate because I see people with degrees still struggling to find jobs. It makes me question whether it’s worth the effort.
I feel stuck and need serious advice. How can I find something that truly interests me and build a fulfilling career? What steps should I take to figure out what’s right for me. ",1,1734068979.0,LifeAdvice,1,0.99,False

1hd5nn5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/1hd5nn5/scary_good_ai_script/,Scary Good AI Script,"Tonight at the local café, my friend and I got on the topic of google's new willow ai and subsequently went down a chatgpt rabbit hole. For context, I rarely use gpt but months prior to this I had asked gpt to write a script just to test it's capabilities and I was confidently unimpressed by it's output, even after having gave it heaps of variables. I gave it a go again with an extremely simple prompt: ""Write a script under 10 pages, one location, 2 actors, in the style of woody Allen rom com,"" and the results left me floored to say the least. I guess I was living under a rock as I hadn't realized how frighteningly better it's gotten. I also hadn't seen much of notice on the topic here since several months ago and I thought it may be important to share these findings, so here's what it gave me:

**Title**: **Unmatched**

**Location**: A cozy, slightly cluttered New York apartment living room. The furniture is mismatched but charming: a worn couch, a small bookshelf overflowing with books, and a coffee table with an old chessboard. Outside the window, the faint sounds of city life hum in the background.

**Characters**:

* **Max**: Late 30s, neurotic and self-deprecating, a freelance writer with a love-hate relationship with his own intellect.
* **Claire**: Early 30s, quick-witted and effortlessly charming, Max's long-time friend and occasional chess partner.

**Scene 1**

*(The apartment is quiet except for the ticking of a clock. Max sits on the couch, staring at the chessboard. His hair is slightly disheveled, and he’s wearing a cardigan that looks like it’s seen better days. The doorbell buzzes. Max startles and mutters to himself as he crosses to open the door.)*

**Max**: (muttering) Great, it’s probably Claire. She’ll either mock me for my existential crisis or borrow my last coffee pod.

*(He opens the door. Claire breezes in, carrying a brown paper bag and wearing a scarf that seems too bright for winter.)*

**Claire**: You’re lucky I like you. You know, some people bring wine; I bring bagels. It’s a much deeper gesture of friendship.

**Max**: (closes the door) Wine lasts longer. Bagels are just...carbs with a deadline.

**Claire**: (sets the bag on the coffee table) Oh, please. You’re the only person I know who could turn a bagel into a metaphor for mortality.

**Max**: It’s not a metaphor. It’s a cruel reality. (pauses) Did you at least bring cream cheese?

**Claire**: (mock-offended) What kind of monster do you think I am?

**Max**: The kind who once brought hummus to a bagel brunch.

**Claire**: That was an experimental phase. I’ve grown.

*(She flops onto the couch and eyes the chessboard.)*

**Claire**: You’re playing against yourself again. That’s not sad at all.

**Max**: It’s strategic. I’m sharpening my skills for our rematch.

**Claire**: (grins) Max, you haven’t beaten me in chess since college. And even then, I’m pretty sure you cheated.

**Max**: (defensive) I didn’t cheat. I… creatively interpreted the rules.

**Claire**: You moved your knight diagonally.

**Max**: (shrugs) Innovation frightens people.

*(She laughs and starts unpacking the bagels.)*

**Claire**: So, what’s the crisis du jour? I can tell by the way your cardigan is slouching.

**Max**: (sits across from her) It’s not a crisis. It’s just...I was thinking about my dating profile.

**Claire**: Oh, no. Not again.

**Max**: Listen, last week I went on a date with someone who listed “taxidermy” as a hobby. Do you know how awkward it is to eat chicken parmesan across from someone who can’t stop talking about stuffing raccoons?

**Claire**: (trying not to laugh) You attract the weird ones, Max. It’s your tragic charm.

**Max**: Tragic? Tragic is when you accidentally swipe right on your therapist.

**Claire**: Wait—you didn’t.

**Max**: (groans) I did. She unmatched me immediately. Probably some kind of boundary violation.

**Claire**: (teasing) Or maybe she just didn’t like your profile.

**Max**: (mock gasp) That’s low, even for you.

**Claire**: (leans forward) Let me see it.

**Max**: No.

**Claire**: Max, come on. I’m the only person who’s honest with you.

**Max**: (reluctantly pulls out his phone) Fine. But if you make one joke about my “lover of sunsets” line, I’m kicking you out.

**Claire**: (takes the phone) “Lover of sunsets”? Max, you don’t even stay up late enough to see sunsets.

**Max**: I thought it sounded poetic.

**Claire**: It sounds like you’re running for Miss America.

**Max**: (grabs the phone back) Okay, forget it. I’ll just die alone.

**Claire**: (softens) Max, you’re not going to die alone.

**Max**: Statistically, it’s highly likely.

**Claire**: Statistically, you’re exhausting.

*(They sit in comfortable silence for a moment. Claire picks up a chess piece and fiddles with it.)*

**Claire**: You know, maybe you’re trying too hard.

**Max**: Trying too hard? Claire, my entire personality is trying too hard.

**Claire**: Exactly. Maybe stop trying to impress people with your tragic charm. Just...be you.

**Max**: (suspicious) Be me? That sounds terrifying.

**Claire**: (smiling) It’s worth a shot.

**Max**: (leans back) What about you? You’re not exactly storming the romantic beaches.

**Claire**: (shrugs) I’m waiting for someone who can match me move for move.

**Max**: (grins) Like in chess?

**Claire**: Exactly. Which means you’re out of the running.

**Max**: (mock hurt) Ouch.

**Claire**: (smirks) But I guess you’re decent company. For now.

*(They lock eyes for a beat. The city hums outside. Claire breaks the moment, grabs a bagel, and tosses one to Max.)*

**Claire**: Let’s eat. And then I’m going to crush you in chess.

**Max**: (catching the bagel) You wish.

*(They set up the board, laughing as they settle into the game. The camera pulls back, framing them against the chaotic charm of the apartment as they bicker and play. The faint sounds of laughter linger as the screen fades to black.)*

**FADE OUT.**

It's not amazing, but for a short story it has proper scene direction, good pacing, nuanced and engagingly witty dialogue, also capturing Allen's neurotic essence with a neat ending to boot. It made me honestly question if parts of this dialogue were stripped from his movies or somewhere else?

As tempting as it may have been to want to save for later, it still rung to me morally wrong and intellectually fraudulent as an artist and writer to assume ownership. Of course this has been the debate since it's inception, nonetheless, I'm curious as to other's perspectives.

1hd5moz,https://v.redd.it/laek55fwzj6e1,"During my wife’s pregnancy, I (M31) gained 130lbs in 9+ months, all in my belly—now stuck with a 67” gut, looking overdue with quadruplets. Doctors say it’s the most extreme case of Couvade Syndrome, or ‘sympathetic pregnancy,’ they’ve seen, hormones pushing my body into a hyper-sympathetic state.","I never thought I’d be writing this, but after what’s happened to my body over the past 9+ months, I feel like I’m living in a surreal medical case study. My wife and I (both 31) are expecting our first children—twins!—and her pregnancy has been going as smoothly as possible. But for me, things took a very bizarre turn. Early in her pregnancy, I began experiencing symptoms of what’s called Couvade Syndrome, or “sympathetic pregnancy,” where men mimic some of their partner’s pregnancy symptoms. At first, it was funny—me complaining about morning nausea and intense cravings while my wife teased me for being dramatic. But as the weeks went on, the symptoms became extreme.

[HERE](https://imgur.com/a/1XUx2qQ) are some photos and videos of me before versus me now in the last couple months of this transformation. 

Within 9+ months, I’ve gained over 130 pounds, and it’s all gone to my belly.  Doctors have tested me for every possible condition—Cushing’s syndrome, hypothyroidism, ascites, insulin resistance, and a laundry list of rare disorders. They ran metabolic panels, hormone tests, and even MRIs to rule out anything that could explain this transformation. Everything came back normal. After countless appointments with endocrinologists, gastroenterologists, and dietitians, the consensus is unanimous: this is the most extreme case of Couvade Syndrome they’ve ever seen. My body has gone into a hyper-sympathetic state, mimicking my wife’s pregnancy so intensely that I now look more pregnant than she does.

Here’s the wildest part: my belly has grown to an unbelievable 67+ inches in circumference. It’s perfectly round, heavy, and tight—so much so that doctors have compared it to an overdue pregnancy with triplets or even quadruplets. I’ve been experiencing cravings, hormonal changes, and even bizarre moments of arousal that have made this entire experience surreal and difficult to process.

The public’s stares reactions to me have been nothing short of overwhelming. Everywhere I go, people treat me like a walking sideshow attraction. Strangers constantly stop me on the street to ask, “When are you due?” or “Are you having twins—or is it triplets?” Sometimes, people assume I’m joking when I say I’m not pregnant or assure them that my belly is real, even, and not a costume. One particularly embarrassing encounter happened when a man followed me in his car, yelling “Hey, heifer! How’d you get so huge, fatass!” and filming me as I struggled to walk. He kept shouting out the window, “When are the babies due?” and even taunted me to run, laughing as I awkwardly waddled down the street. 

Another time, a homeless man trailed me for blocks, loudly asking, “Are you sick? What happened to you? You can still fix this. You look like you’re about to pop!” His comments drew stares from others, and the whole experience left me humiliated. Once, at a grocery store, I reached for something on a high shelf, and the movement caused my shirt to ride up, exposing my belly. A woman nearby loudly gasped and asked if I was okay, or pregnant, and when I assured her I wasn’t pregnant, she looked me up and down in disbelief before walking away, shaking her head.  Thankfully, some guys are entertained or supportive, and say things like “Damn, bro, that’s the most impressive belly I’ve ever seen. Take care of yourself. That’s crazy.”

Our small town caught wind of what was happening to me and even ran a story in the local paper. They did a photo shoot with me and my wife, documenting what they called “the most extreme case of Couvade Syndrome on record.” The article focused on the medical mystery and included photos of me standing next to my wife, both of us cradling our bellies. At one point, they measured my stomach circumference on camera, which was mortifying. The reporter joked that I looked more overdue than my wife, and the whole experience left me red-faced, especially when people in town started recognizing me from the article and stopping me to ask questions.

Family and friends have been equally baffled. My wife’s parents were initially concerned and suggested I get immediate medical attention, while my own family didn’t believe it at first and thought I was exaggerating. Now, it’s become a mix of humor and genuine concern. Even at work, my coworkers started a playful due date countdown for me, marking it on the office calendar alongside my wife’s.

Despite the jokes, I feel terrible that my transformation has overshadowed my wife’s pregnancy. What should have been a time focused on her and the excitement of our twins has turned into a community spectacle about my bizarre condition. She’s been incredibly supportive and laughs it off, joking that I’m taking some of the heat off her by becoming the bigger attraction. But I can’t help feeling guilty—this was supposed to be her moment, and instead, I’m the one everyone’s talking about.

Meanwhile, I’ve struggled to maintain a sense of normalcy. My shirts don’t fit anymore, riding up over my belly and exposing the lower half every time I move. I’ve tried buying larger sizes, but even those don’t last long before I outgrow them. Just the other day, I bent down to tie my shoe at work, and the strain caused a button to pop off my shirt, shooting across the office like a missile. Everyone heard it, and I had to awkwardly laugh it off while turning red. Another time, I stretched to grab something at a 711, and the seam of my shirt tore open right down the side, leaving me scrambling to cover myself. My pants aren’t any better—they’re so tight under the curve of my gut that I’ve split the seams more times than I care to admit.

At work, I’m required to wear a uniform—a button-up shirt, no less—and squeezing into it has become a nightmare. The buttons pull so tight that I’m sure they’ll pop, and they often do—sometimes in front of coworkers or even clients, which is humiliating. I’ve started bringing safety pins to hold my shirts together in emergencies, but even those can barely contain the strain. Each week, I’m outgrowing something else, to the point where I’m running out of options entirely.

Getting dressed in the morning has become a daily battle. Pulling my pants up under the massive curve of my belly feels like trying to fit into a sausage casing. The waistband digs into me so tightly that it makes my gut stick out even more, exaggerating its size and making me look even more absurdly pregnant. My belt creaks and groans whenever I sit down, and I constantly worry it’s going to snap. Even sitting in a chair has become a spectacle; I have to ease myself down slowly to avoid bursting buttons or causing the furniture to creak under my weight.

Movement is an entirely different challenge. I can barely bend over to tie my shoes without my belly pressing hard against my thighs, forcing me to hold my breath just to reach the laces. I’ve started wearing slip-ons to avoid the embarrassment. Getting in and out of my car is another ordeal—it feels like I’m wedging myself into a tight space, my belly brushing against the steering wheel no matter how far back I push the seat. Walking down the street, my belly bounces and jiggles with every step, drawing stares from passersby. Sometimes, I even catch people filming me.

Everyday tasks that used to be simple now feel monumental, and I’ve stopped pretending I can blend in. Despite my best efforts to maintain normalcy, my transformation has made me impossible to ignore.

Doctors have been fascinated by my condition, describing me as a medical anomaly. They’ve even suggested publishing my case in a medical journal, as they’ve never seen anything like it. While I understand their excitement from a scientific perspective, it’s hard not to feel like a sideshow. I’ve been poked, prodded, and measured so many times that I’ve lost count.

As for other symptoms/side effects, there’s a lot more to this experience than just the abdominal growth. Early on, we thought it was kind of adorable how in sync my wife and I were during her pregnancy. I’d wake up nauseous when she did, I’d have random cravings, and we joked about how empathetic I was being when I’d have morning sickness. But as things progressed, it became clear this wasn’t just harmless sympathy symptoms. My body’s hormonal changes went into overdrive. Alongside the weight gain, I’ve dealt with intense mood swings, exhaustion, and an unsettling sensitivity to smells. Even little things, like the scent of strong coffee, can send me running for fresh air.  The exhaustion hasn’t helped with me also not being very active during this time. 

Unlike my wife, I’m not growing two babies, so everything I eat is turning directly into fat, and unfortunately, it’s all going straight to my belly. The uncontrollable cravings have been a big part of this. I naturally eat more than her as it is, but the hormonal changes I’ve been experiencing—like elevated prolactin and cortisol levels—have completely derailed any sense of self-control. It’s as if my body is craving the transformation itself. There have been times I’ve gone on insane binges, eating until I physically couldn’t anymore… Even when I wanted to stop, it felt impossible, I was still hungry, like my body was demanding more fuel to keep growing.

Doctors think my body is in a kind of “hyper-storage mode,” where every calorie is being stored as fat, specifically in my abdomen, almost as if it’s mimicking a pregnancy. Some specialists believe my fat cells in this area might have become overly sensitive to insulin, leading to the rapid, disproportionate fat accumulation. Others suggest that elevated prolactin levels, typically associated with lactation and maternal behaviors, might be affecting how my body stores fat and retains fluid. Combined with some fluid retention in my belly, it’s created this bizarre, ballooning effect that feels completely out of my control. It’s crazy to outgrow a shirt in a matter of a couple weeks. 

One of the more difficult—and frankly embarrassing—symptoms has been this bizarre hormonal arousal.  Sorry if it is TMI to share all of this, but it’s such a large part of the psychological side effects I’ve been dealing with that it would be hard not to include it. My doctors have explained that the surges of prolactin, cortisol, and other pregnancy-related hormones in my system seem to be “confusing” my body, tricking it into thinking this transformation is something I’m meant to desire or enjoy. It’s almost as though my body is trying to gaslight me into embracing the changes so it can continue expanding. They’ve told me that this is likely part of a feedback loop—my body experiences embarrassment or awkwardness from how big I’ve gotten and the trouble I have maneuvering or drawing attention, and that stress triggers a hormonal response that leads to an unexpected surge of arousal. That sensation then clouds my judgment, making me crave situations where I feel even more self-conscious, which leads to choices—like overeating or not avoiding tight clothes—that exacerbate the growth.

This feedback loop is one of the hardest aspects to navigate. It’s created a cycle where I feel like I’m feeding into my own situation, literally and figuratively. The arousal itself feels like my body’s way of pushing me to keep going, even though I logically don’t want to get bigger or draw more attention. And yet, I’ve found myself leaning into these situations, almost unconsciously seeking out moments that leave me even more embarrassed or humiliated. It’s such a strange and difficult headspace to be in because I know it’s my hormones playing tricks on me, but in the moment, it’s hard to fight against. The doctors are optimistic that these reactions should subside once my wife gives birth and my hormones stabilize, but until then, I’m doing my best to stay mindful and not let this cycle get even more out of control.

At the end of the day, I’m still at a loss. My body feels alien to me, and every day brings new challenges. I’ve started wondering if this condition will reverse after my wife gives birth—or if this is something I’ll be living with for the rest of my life.

I don't smoke and I drink very occasionally, like once every three months when I have whatever party or social event and even then I'm very moderate about it

I've started noticing this pain in the left side of my chest around two-three weeks ago, it happened to me like 3-4 times since then including this one, some longer than others, always comes and goes. It feels like it is right under my chest. It's always accompanied by shortness of breath, and a feeling of pressure in my chest.
It happens when I am resting, laying down or on my side, always around nighttime.

I'm a very anxious person so my family has assumes it's anxiety, I don't rule it out at all because I've had the shortness of breath and chest pressure since longer this year from time to time at different places and situations, which makes me believe it could be anxiety.
But also have eaten a lot of spicy and acid food since I was a kid and I guess I do overstep with it, recently my only change in diet has been that I've been drinking more coffee almost daily like for around s month or so, I know it's very irritating for the stomach, so I don't rule out any stomach issues. I do know I had a lot lf problems with reflux as a kid, even got me in the hospital. 

Just to note my family also has no history of any heart problems - my mother only was recently diagnosed with high pressure but most likely a result of her age and stress as she has no background of it either. 

Yeah I know this is practically my wake up call to become healthier. I just want to know if it's something I should worry about as I'm constantly scared I'm having a heart attack. Right now the pain has been more persistent.

I just wanted to say that I had a really great experience at Kamol Hospital in Bangkok. I'm two weeks post-op and am very happy with my results. Dr Kamol was pretty straight to the point and I didn't spend heaps of time with him, however he answered all my questions when I did have my pre-op exam with him. If you're looking for a surgeon with lots of time for you and a good bedside manner I wouldn't recommend him, but I wasn't fussed about that. The results of the surgery were all that I was really concerned about and I think he did an incredible job. My incisions are nice and straight (which is what I requested) and have healed really well so far. Can't speak too much on my nipple grafts as they're still looking pretty crusty, but so far the healing is going great.

I'd say the highlight were the staff at Kamol. The nurses were incredible and so lovely. There were hardly any communication problems (I speak 0 Thai so I was expecting it) and if we couldn't understand we'd use google translate on our phones and it did the job well. I had my mum and my sister with me, which was a complete life-saver. I would highly recommended bringing someone with you if you can -- especially if you're travelling. I came from New Zealand which was a 14 hour flight! We stayed at the K Garden, which is accommodation that's owned and run by the hospital. It's about a 3 minute walk from the hospital itself. The staff there were wonderful. Lots of food and coffee places in the area as well as supermarkets/corner stores. There's even a couple pharmacies nearby if you need to get any extra supplies post-op!

Over-all, I'd say my experience was pretty much perfect. Ideally I would've stayed in New Zealand and had the surgery here, however I was looking at around 36k (unfortunately top surgery is not part of our public healthcare system), whereas I paid about 14k including flights and accommodation.

Just wanted to share a good experience with everyone and hopefully help if anyone is looking into getting top surgery at Kamol hospital. Any questions about my experience are more than welcome!",3,1734068352.0,TopSurgery,1,1.0,False

I’ve been going back and forth with Prady for a few months over the Bolivia coffee drop he did at the end of August. He ran into a shipping issue initially and the wheels fell off from there. Out of frustration after ignored emails, I posted a comment on IG under his post which was deleted almost immediately and received a DM from him saying he was working on a new shipping option. Fast forward another month, I received one of two orders that I placed for that August release and reached out to him on IG since email apparently doesn’t work for him. He said he’d have the bag in the mail the following day or two. As of today I haven’t received the Bolivia bag. He can’t produce any shipping info for the order, so a couple weeks ago I asked if he just wanted to refund me which he said he could in a day or two. Latest communication today is that he’s checking on the status of the refund. Just a total runaround and pretty big disappointment from Mood Trap.",1,1734068341.0,pourover,1,1.0,False

Long story short, i was coping with life in corporate, adulting and doing everything alone and was recovering from a fall out with one of my best friends, infact lost contact with all of my friends(the same work busy and no time for friends stuff). One day, while commuting to work, i see this dude, almost dreamy in jan this year, he looked like sunlight on the cold mornings(lol poetic). I kept staring until I realized he too was staring me, and crazy part he got into my same cab, and to the best of plots, he works in my company. I couldn't have asked for better, then I kept seeing him in the office, everywhere, during coffee, during lunch, during random walks. He is everywhere i go, which is strange and we have too many eye contacts that his eyes are etched on my brain cells. 
Never been soo happy for just seeing someone, slowly, i started my delulu dreams, the crossover went from stares from afar or across the room to bumping into each other, randomly getting seating almost beside each other. After 8 months of almost so many swoon worthy incidents, he spoke to me casual cab talk, all i could utter was ""yeah"", ""sure"", but i imagined our kids faces for the rest of the month, until...
One day, a text pops up in common chat, its from him, he is looking for relocation, I am from Hyderabad, and right now we are both on Hyderabad, he wants to relocate to Noida (ofc he is from delhi), then once all the dreams and kids popped off my brain. I was at once closer to earth core(pataal) dropped directly from cool clouds(jannat). All the eye contacts and bumping and delulus were confusing me and i still thought it'd take sometime for him to leave and I'd have a proper talk and make him my friend. 
So, i spoke, like the dumbest creature on earth i asked his name and asked how transfer works(lol, lol, lol, there's a huge freely available already well known document) he recovered from my dumbness and answered some stuff which i was clearly not listening and then told me he didn't get it yet. Thats all i needed to know, HE DIDN'T GET IT YET, SO HE IS NOT GETTING IT ANYTIME SOON. 
I went on with my delusions of how hes going to stay forever and we have kids later(because what else is his transfer getting delayed for right?)
But I was too shy to talk to him after the dumb question, because ik he might have thought or got the hint that i asked it just because i wanted to talk. No efforts from his end. But I saw him very sad, almost depressed, ofc the not getting the transfer effected him badly and I was happy in it. A month went by and I barely saw his smile. I was very guilty and thought maybe he's staying back because i am wishing for it, so i kept everything aside and prayed that he get the transfer he's soo sad about. I kept praying and avoided him because I was now guilty(because in my head he is sad because of me) and embarrassed(ofc of the silly move) 
Until one day in mid November when we had like two crossovers and i was rushing away from him, ofc i was still guilty and embarrassed and he looked confused, but didn't say a word. I saw him one last time at the exit of our company and thats it. Later I learned that he got the transfer. Prayers are indeed heard!

I have an older brother, and we both have families of our own. He and my husband have the same kind of job, which makes me wonder why he constantly turns to us for financial help. What’s even more disheartening is that he never pays back what he owes. It’s not just a once-in-a-while situation; it has become a pattern, a way of life for him.  

He orders things online without thinking twice and expects me to foot the bill. The worst part is, I only find out about it when the delivery rider is already at our doorstep. Can you imagine how humiliating it is to scramble for money at the last minute? Like today—I only had 250 pesos left, and his order was 270. I had to swallow my pride and borrow 20 pesos from my mother-in-law just to pay for something I never even agreed to buy.  

I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve tried to explain that we’re struggling too. I’ve told them plainly: I don’t have extra money to give. If they’re hungry, I’ll gladly share what we have—there’s always bread and coffee here, and we usually have rice and a dish to go with it. But it’s unfair for them to depend on me financially, especially when I’m trying to make ends meet for my own family.  

It’s not just the money—it’s the principle. It’s the lack of accountability, the expectation that I will always be there to pick up the pieces. It makes me wonder if they even realize how hard we work just to stay afloat, or if they’ve simply decided that I’m their safety net.

1hd5fjl,https://www.reddit.com/r/behindthebastards/comments/1hd5fjl/medical_advertising/,Medical Advertising ,"I worked in public health clinical reporting for over 25 years in Australia. I remember all the urgent medico-legal requests that came in during the early 2000s related to Vioxx, Celebrex and a few other drug scandals. There was a a lot of reporting regarding heart attack presentations.

Australia's drug testing and approval became really, really stringent in the 1970s after the thalidomide scandal, because Australia was really badly affected by that. Pharmaceutical companies have never been able to advertise prescription drugs to the general public, and even over the counter drugs have very stringent advertising regulations.

Drug companies used to get around this by showering health professionals with gifts. Branded stationery, coffee cups, snack centres... and for people who could prescribe the stuff, holidays to luxury resorts. These were classed as ""conferences"" but really they were just advertising junkets where Merck, Pfizer etc could wine and dine medicos while telling them how awesome their drugs were.

I can't remember exactly when, I think it was around 2008, but the regulations around what drug companies could do to promote their products got even stricter. They can't do the wine and dine thing nearly as much, but the biggest thing was that all the branded stuff disappeared. This was particularly frustrating for hospital staff because it meant we couldn't get pens that worked any more (government supply contacts for the loss); and a lot of the coffee cups in staff rooms disappeared too.

Thing is, I never really considered just how dangerous drug ads could be until now. I'm glad pharmaceutical companies can't advertise directly. And while the stationery issue in public hospitals is probably still just as awful, it's probably a good thing we can't scrawl notes on Celebrex branded Post It's with our Vioxx pens, and leave them next to our Lyrica coffee cups.",2,1734067927.0,behindthebastards,0,1.0,False

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**The transformation of a smile can be one of the most impactful changes in someone’s appearance, and teeth whitening is a popular method to achieve that. The “before and after” results of teeth whitening treatments often showcase stunning differences, encouraging many to explore their options. This article will dive into what you can expect from teeth whitening treatments and how these services can bring about a significant enhancement in your smile.**

When considering teeth whitening, understanding the various methods available is essential. Different treatments cater to different needs and budgets. Here is a breakdown of the most common whitening options:

- **In-Office Whitening:** This professional service often uses stronger whitening agents. It typically takes about an hour and can lighten teeth by several shades in a single session.
- **At-Home Kits:** These kits, usually provided by dentists, come with custom trays and whitening gel. They are less intense than in-office treatments, but users can still see noticeable results in a couple of weeks.
- **Over-the-Counter Products:** These include strips, gels, and toothpastes that are widely available. While they may take longer to show results, they offer convenience and accessibility.

As you consider whitening treatment, it's crucial to manage your expectations. The results “before and after” can be impressive, but they vary depending on the method used, your natural tooth color, and any pre-existing dental issues. Many people have successfully brightened their smiles by up to several shades, which can make a significant difference in one’s confidence.

Images often tell a compelling story. When browsing through “teeth whitening before and after” photos, you will likely witness the transformation from dull, stained teeth to bright, shining smiles. These visuals can serve as motivation. Seeing someone achieve their desired results can help you imagine the possibilities for your own smile.

Teeth whitening can also boost self-esteem and improve one’s overall appearance. Studies show that people with brighter smiles are often perceived as more attractive and approachable. This newfound confidence can positively impact various areas of life, from social situations to professional interactions. A bright, white smile can create a lasting first impression.

However, it’s important to note that not every whitening method works the same for everyone. Factors such as personal dental care habits and individual tooth sensitivity can significantly influence results. To help you decide the best approach, consider the following:

- **Consult with your dentist:** They can assess your oral health and recommend the best plan for your needs.
- **Read reviews:** Look for testimonials from others who have undergone treatment. Their experiences can provide valuable insights.
- **Be patient:** Results may not be immediate, especially with at-home kits. Consistency is key.

The journey to a whiter smile doesn’t just revolve around the procedure; maintaining that brightness is equally important. Here are some essential tips to keep in mind:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Practice good oral hygiene:** Brush and floss regularly to reduce the chances of stains returning.
- **Limit staining foods and drinks:** Avoid coffee, tea, red wine, and dark berries if possible.
- **Visit your dentist regularly:** Professional cleanings help maintain your enhanced smile.

Ultimately, the allure of teeth whitening lies in its potential to create a remarkable transformation. The stunning results captured in “before and after” images can inspire anyone considering this enhancement. By understanding the different options available, setting realistic expectations, and committing to aftercare, you can achieve a bright smile that not only looks great but also feels fantastic.

So, are you ready to take that step towards a dazzling smile? With the right knowledge and approach, the transformation of your smile could be just around the corner.

Understanding the Myths and Facts About Teeth Whitening Treatments
------------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening has become a popular cosmetic dental procedure, with many people eager to achieve a brighter smile. However, misinformation surrounding teeth whitening treatments can lead to confusion and misplaced expectations. This guide will clarify some common myths and facts to help you make informed decisions about your whitening journey.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Myth 1: Teeth Whitening is Permanent

One of the biggest misconceptions is that teeth whitening offers a permanent solution. In reality, the effects of whitening treatments can fade over time. Factors such as diet, lifestyle choices, and oral hygiene practices influence how long your smile stays bright. Drinking coffee, tea, or red wine can lead to staining, while smoking is also a contributor to discoloration.

### Fact 1: Maintenance is Key

To maintain your bright smile after whitening, consider these tips:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- Practice good oral hygiene by brushing and flossing regularly.
- Use whitening toothpaste to help keep stains at bay.
- Limit consumption of stain-causing foods and drinks.
- Schedule regular dental cleanings to remove surface stains.

### Myth 2: All Teeth Whitening Products are the Same

Another common myth is that all whitening products offer the same results. However, this isn't true. Over-the-counter whitening strips and gels contain lower concentrations of bleaching agents than professional treatments. This means they may take longer to show results and might not provide the same level of whitening as treatments offered by your dentist.

### Fact 2: Professional Treatments Are More Effective

Professional teeth whitening performed by a dentist typically yields faster and more pronounced results. Dentists use higher concentrations of hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide, which can penetrate the enamel more effectively. Here’s a quick comparison:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Over-the-Counter Products:** Generally less expensive but may require several applications over weeks.
- **In-Office Treatments:** Costlier but can produce immediate results, often within one visit.

### Myth 3: Teeth Whitening Causes Damage to Enamel

Many people believe that whitening treatments damage tooth enamel. However, reputable whitening products, when used as directed, are safe and do not harm enamel. That said, overuse of whitening products, especially those with high concentrations of bleach, can lead to sensitivity or irritation.

### Fact 3: Sensitivity is Normal

While some level of sensitivity is normal during or after treatment, it’s essential to follow usage instructions carefully. If sensitivity persists, consult your dentist. They can recommend products or techniques to minimize discomfort.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Myth 4: Whitening Works on All Teeth

Teeth whitening doesn’t work equally for everyone. Some people have intrinsic stains due to factors like genetics or certain medications, which may not respond well to conventional whitening treatments. Crowns, veneers, and certain fillings do not whiten either, often needing replacements for a uniform appearance.

### Fact 4: Consult Your Dentist

Before starting any whitening treatment, it's best to consult with your dentist. They can assess your dental health and help you choose the most suitable option. They can also discuss alternative cosmetic procedures if whitening isn't adequate for your needs.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Myth 5: You Can Whiten Your Teeth Too Often

There's a belief that more frequent whitening can provide better results. In truth, overusing whitening products can lead to tooth sensitivity and damage to gums. Moderation is essential for safety and effectiveness.

### Fact 5: Following Directions is Essential

To achieve and maintain the desired results, always follow the manufacturer’s instructions or your dentist's guidance. This ensures not only effective whitening but also safeguards your oral health.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
With so many misconceptions about teeth whitening, understanding the facts can help you create a brighter, healthier smile. Whether you choose to go the professional route or use over-the-counter products, informed choices will lead you to the best results. Remember that every smile is different, so what works for someone else may not work for you. It's all about finding the right approach that fits your needs.

### Conclusion

Teeth whitening is more than just a cosmetic procedure; it can profoundly change how you feel about your smile. The transformation of smiles is evident when comparing before and after photos, showcasing the incredible potential of effective treatments. Many individuals experience a significant boost in confidence, which can enhance personal and professional interactions.

Navigating through the common myths and facts surrounding teeth whitening is crucial to making informed decisions. While some may fear the process due to misconceptions about safety and effectiveness, understanding the real science behind teeth whitening helps demystify these treatments. For instance, while some products may promise instant results, it’s essential to consider those that offer gradual yet lasting improvements, which are often safer and more effective in the long run.

Real, authentic results take time, patience, and the right approach. Whether you choose professional services or over-the-counter products, knowing what to expect can prepare you for a successful journey. Regular maintenance and proper oral hygiene can further extend the longevity of your bright new smile.

A brighter smile can open doors and create a lasting impression, empowering you to express yourself more freely. Remember, teeth whitening is not just about aesthetic appeal; it’s about feeling great about yourself. Embrace the possibilities of your beautiful smile, armed with the knowledge of the facts, and let your teeth shine brighter than ever.

Back in March I quit smoking and I knew I would have to replace it with…something.  My initial thought was peyote but my doctor kept stressing that it’s not a good idea to replace one bad habit with another bad habit—even if you get a cool vision quest involving a talking banana slug out of the deal.  So on a whim I ponied up $500 for a box of half dollars from the credit union.   

The following is a list of benefits that I have found:  

Half dollars are too big to fit in the coin slot on Tri-met buses so most of the time I get a free ride.  

It turns out that pre-1965 half dollars are made of silver and coin shops will buy them from you.  The lowest I’ve got is $2.50 and the highest I’ve received is $45.  There are usually 2-10 silver ones in a box.   

No offense to young people, but cashiers and baristas at corporate coffee shops and chain retail stores think half dollars are actually dollar coins, so your stuff is automatically 50% off.  This happens about 20-25% of the time.   

Studies show you spend less if you only pay in cash.  It’s such a pain in the ass to only pay in half dollars that I think I’ve cut down on my purchases by maybe half.   

Old people love half dollars and their faces light up when you pull them out.  It makes them happy, and it’s fun to make people happy.  

In my neighborhood I am now known as “50-CENT” which is funny to me.  

In conclusion, a $500 up-front investment paid for itself in about two months via resale, borderline theft, savings, and light-hearted joy.  Like I said I know it’s not for everyone, but I’m ordering a 4th box next week.

i had to leave the apt for a bit cause i didn't want to talk to her anymore and told her that she needs to control her behavior but she wouldn't hear it...

when i came back after spending an hour or so in the car she didn't want to let me in and asked me to ""apologize"" in order to let me in, i obviously faked it and she let me in ... but i did cry a bit in front of my door before coming in...

i am exhausted with her in every possible way. my daughter made my life so much more beautiful and i love her so much, i can't fathom how it would be for me to be without her and to see her grow up.

im in a lot of pain with no one to talk to cause no one understands, and if you talk shit about your wife you are seen as a horrible husband or whatever, and i don't have a therapist, but i don't know how they would help me.

i know i can't change her, she is miserable, i can sense it now that i know how this disease works, she is ""high performing"" on the things she cares about, like her job, but she is extremely tired all the time nd a couch potato and doesn't take initiative on anything. she doesn't approve of anyone nor does she allow her self to get lose or have fun. she does not drink coffee or tea and also is pre diabetic. 

if i was to leave her it would be really hard for me to tell my daughter about it and i feel that she would  not forgive me. my wife is really manipulative so she would probably turn her against me.

we don't even have a ""connection"" anymore, we never laugh together or do anything fun together. the way she sees the world is all messed up and i can't agree with her on anything. 

i tried to leave her multiple times in the past before kids but i don't know why the fuck i didn't do it. last time i tried to do it her sister convinced me not to and i caved in. i had bought a one way ticket to the city where i grew up. 

i would love to get divorced and minimize the damage to my daughter some how but i have no clue how to do it and i really don't want to be away from my daughter. i have been like this for years with no resolution in sight, and now that i have a daughter i am about to leave the situation it just makes me feel so weak. but at the same time i dont want her to grow up in a house like this cause we have nothing together anymore. our daughter isthe only thing keeping us together.",2,1734067242.0,BPDlovedones,0,1.0,False
1hd58qp,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1hd58qp/wdt_technique_for_commercial_applications/,WDT Technique for commercial applications,"Hello,  
As a coffee enthusiast and owner of a coffee business, I’m constantly seeking ways to refine my technique. At home, I rely on a WDT tool and tamping for consistency, but I’ve yet to identify an efficient workflow for incorporating WDT in a busy commercial environment.

Here’s the challenge: in a high-volume setting, I’ve found palm distribution tools to be the most time-efficient option. However, it’s clear that WDT offers superior distribution and extraction potential. With a single-group espresso machine and a relatively small boiler (due to power constraints) at my stand, time efficiency is crucial when producing 40-50 drinks per hour.

Currently, my workflow involves grinding directly into the portafilter, using a palm distributor, and tamping. While this method gets the job done, I’m convinced there’s room for improvement. The dilemma is that introducing WDT would require using a funnel, which adds steps—attaching and removing it—plus the time spent performing WDT. Even if these steps take only a few extra seconds, they add up during peak periods.

I’d love to hear from others who have found ways to incorporate WDT into their commercial workflows without compromising speed. Are there specific tools or techniques you’d recommend to streamline the process?

For reference, my grinder is a Mahlkonig K30.",1,1734067232.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

Step 1 get a lucid dream. 

2 know that  dreams work on expectations. 

3 example = expect(0%doubt) that you can fly when you run. Then you run. You must be able to fly as you run.

4 expect that you will wake up in your desired reality after thinking about this and then you try to think about waking up in your desired reality.  You will be reality shifted to your desired reality.

Why above method? 
Because the portal thing is harder to make than this as i have tried to myself. 

Scripting tips=
Note = have a detailed shifting scene script. For example=
 as i wake up
 I see the ceiling with a huge white fan (eyes) 
and
 there's no one beside me( space awareness) 
and
 also there's rain sound( sound) of rain striking the windows and. 
There's a smell of coffee in the air (smell) 
And 
The coffee powder is scattered in the room which caused me to taste coffee as I took a breath from my mouth. (taste) 
Which woke me up instantly. 

Try to keep it like a descriptive essay try using all 5 senses = touch, smell, taste, sound and eyes. 

Why above Script? 
The above script is to help you identify your desired reality as soon as you shift avoiding getting trapped in wrong realities. 

My success story. 
As I was in my lucid dream I thought of waking up in my desired reality. I saw myself in a totally different world which was not even anything like I had Scripted. I tried to come back to this old reality as I realised it was a wrong reality and avoided exploring a wrong reality.

I have educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out and earn extra money:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is mostly protein elements and electrolytes.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Your body regenerates plasma fast from staying hydrated and eating protein.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait inbetween those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hyrdrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

F-43 and M-46, 10 year relationship, Hard situation-love him, have kids with him but need the disrespect to stop.
Good evening, I'd really appreciate some solid advice. I've been in a relationship with my ""fiance"" for 10 years. We have two kids together, who we both adore and love immensely. They are young, in preschool and lower elementary. It has been amazing being a family and raising the kids together, and experiencing all of the new things our kids learn and do. I work day shift, and fiancé works second shift. I did quit teaching after over 15 years in, took a leap of faith, and got a different job in corporate that I really enjoy so far. I've been there a few months now. This is important because I wanted to make a positive change in my life and come home less stressed and more able to enjoy my own kids and also to see if this would improve things with my fiancé. Well I feel less stressed being done with teaching responsibilities, have more focus on my family, and feel more respected in my position. However. My ""fiance"" and I continue to butt heads and he tells me that I can't do things that I know I can do, and other people believe I can do, just to knock me down a notch. Example: ""I'm going to present such and such to a company so they can incorporate this into their routine."" He quickly responded with ""You can't do that, are you kidding?"" Then laughing like the thought is ridiculous. We both do our fair share of work, including housework, cooking, laundry, cleaning, taking care of the kids, etc. Which I really appreciate and make sure to show that by saying thank you and compliment his efforts. 
This is not reciprocated. He just expects me to have the house clean, lunches made, any laundry he started finished and folded, blankets we used that night folded, no dishes in the sink, dishwasher emptied, everything put away, spotless by the time he comes home. I make sure everything is cleaned up and looking good, coffee made up for when he wakes up and my am commute, and pick out clothes for my daughter who has school in the AM. This is after I get home and play with the kiddos, make dinner, read them stories, snuggle them up, and put them to sleep. He watches our son in the mornings, which saves on daycare. He gets less sleep because of this, but can nap in the afternoon when youngest goes to pre-K which helps. 
He usually gets daughter breakfast, packed up and ready for the bus. He doesn't get to see her as much since school has started, but makes up for it on the weekends by doing extra things with both kids. There's even sometimes I feel left out of my own family on the weekends. I love being with my kids and we as parents do all of these things because we love and care for our kids. I don't complain, and tend to be a cheerful person (except when I'm on my period, is what he says and I tend to agree.) What I don't understand is why he has resentment towards me. 
Most recently my littlest had his mitten pulled off accidentally from his car seat and it was in my car. I thought to bring it in three times last night and I forgot. My memory isn't the best, mostly because I have a ton going on, think in my head a lot, and have memory difficulties at times. Anyways he texted me this am when I was on my way to work asking if I remembered to bring in his mitten. I called him and said exactly that I remembered it three times last night and then forgot and apologized. It was a busy night, I took oldest kiddo to CCD,(we have different religions and different political views) and they both needed showers as well. Fiancé had made a delicious meal which is very very appreciated especially on a hectic night and we all expressed appreciation by videoing a thank you from each of us during dinner. 
Both kids have a plethora of hats, gloves and mittens and youngest who had mitten missing had two other warm pairs just waiting to get used. Anyways, fiance was on speaker phone with kids this am listening when I said sorry I had forgotten. He said ""I figured, I already knew the answer to that."" In a rude and egotistical tone. Before I left he said the same with a different subject, something trivial. I said I did it, but didn't get a chance to do this. And he said I already knew the answer to that. Like okay you poor thing. Anyways I drop my stuff off at work, drive back home, deliver the mitten, and kiss and hug my youngest before I start the drive back to work. Fiancé says, why’d you come all the way back? I said I want him to have his mitten and I don’t want to be labeled (like him thinking I’m a bad mom for forgetting his mitten.) He said “that’s not the smartest.” So I told him I’m disappointed the way he is talking to me and to stop doing it. And it’s not okay and you are doing it in front of the kids. 
He mumbled something I couldn’t hear but my youngest did. I do have a big heart, but also stick up for myself and the underdog and admit can get a bit fiery when it comes to my family/friends or standing up for what's right. 
I put “fiancé” in quotes because we got engaged right before our second child was born (that birth story and the drama with fiancé is for another time, but the greatest blessing of it all was our littlest and I focus on that.) A year later we got in a fight, both said some shitty things, and he asked for the ring back. He then went downstairs, came back up and bent it and threw it in the trash. Said that's what our relationship was, trash. I didn't think we would make it after that in all honesty. I went to a lawyer and gave him papers to sign for some legal documents since we own a home together and have two kids together. He stalled for almost 60 days, all the time I'm distancing myself from him, and he said he doesn't want this, we'd go to counseling for a second time, and he really wanted us to be together and be a family. I said okay, ate the 2k legal fees and things have been decent overall. I do want to say it's not been the most pleasant relationship, but I do love him very much. And I want to be together as a happy family unit. I just think he can be controlling and belittling at times. I make sure to tell him ah hell naw most days he wants to be rude. Any solid advice?

7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

I have educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out and earn extra money:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is mostly protein elements and electrolytes.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Your body regenerates plasma fast from staying hydrated and eating protein.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait inbetween those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hyrdrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.

Their constant phone conversations lasted for hours these days but the distance of 400 or so miles had kept them from having any idea how that might translate face to face.. and knowing she would finally see him today seemed to give the army of butterflies in her stomach more energy than usual. 
She took the warm white cardboard cup and turned to look for a place to sit and wait..
But instead she found herself looking up into his liquid amber eyes staring at her, his mouth fixed in an unbelievably sexy smile..standing before her and in literal seconds she was gently pulled into his arms and into the sweetest kiss she'd ever tasted in her life. The scene around her disappeared and even as the kiss ended, all she could see and feel was him. She understood completely in that moment that her life was going to be different now.

Cursed to walk the Earth for eternity, never aging past 25 and never dying.” “How old are you now, then?” “...Seventy. It was quite recently, actually.”","“Can you really say you're cursed if you're only seventy years old? That’s not really curse territory, is it? More like a mild inconvenience. Even calling it a mild inconvenience would be a stretch since it hasn’t really affected you.” Diana said, not believing Xavier’s story in the slightest. Everyone always had some farfetched story when they came to see her, and in moments like these, she couldn’t help but entertain their delusions. Not to mention, entertaining their delusions got her out of doing any actual work, able to ignore the stack of papers on her desk. The ones that sat beside the framed photos of her loved ones and her favorite coffee mug.

“I’m telling you the truth. I’m seventy years old. Look, check my license. That will prove my age.” He pulled out his driver’s license, sliding it across the desk. Diana collected it, flipping it over, checking its authenticity.

No matter how hard she looked, she couldn’t find any signs of forgery. The way the light reflected off it, the correct number of layers to its design. If it were a fake, it was one of high quality. “Sorry, sir. I still can’t approve you for a pension.”

“But I’m seventy years old. Every seventy-year-old is allowed a pension. It’s the law.”

“Sir, even the best plastic surgeons on the market couldn’t make a seventy-year-old look as young as you do. Even with a license, I can’t imagine anyone approving your application. Is this for some sort of prank show? Are cameras secretly filming me? You’re the second customer I’ve had this month that’s claimed to be immortal.”

That was news to Xavier, unable to believe another immortal existed. “There was another? Who were they? What were they like?”

Diana tapped her cheek, trying to remember the name the man gave her. “Well, I’m not allowed to give customer details, but since it was a fake name, I suppose there’s no harm in it. He called himself Kevin, the grand wizard of Barlia. The one who slayed the awful beast, and claimed the land. The one who- Yada Yada. He was a real talker, that one. Said if I didn’t approve his request, he would kill the person most dear to me.”

Xavier gasped, the immortal feeling sorry for the poor women. Who had she lost? He knew he shouldn’t ask, but curiosity got the better of him. “Did someone die?”

Diana sighed, looking at the framed photo on her desk. It was a photo of Kipo, the blonde-haired bad boy with a gentle heart, who had been tragically killed off in season 2 of Sexy Kung-fu bad boys. She stared at the framed, animated man, letting out an even heavier sigh again. “I guess someone did die.”

The immortals heart wept for her, until he leaned over and saw the photo, growing more confused than anything. “Ah. Ok.” was all he said, standing upright again. “So, how am I meant to prove my age, then? Can they check my pulse or something?”

Pulling herself away from the photo, Diana thought about that. “We could cut you in half and check your rings. Like how they check a tree’s age. At least I think that’s how they check a tree’s age.”

“That isn’t helpful at all. Are you making fun of me?”

“No, not at all. I’m insulting you. This isn’t fun at all.”

Xavier took a pen from his pocket, folding up the form he had brought to the FSE Pension department. After writing a list of complaints, he pointed to their complaints box. “Don’t make me put this in the box.”

“Go ahead, try to stuff it in there. That thing hasn’t been opened in years. I think we still have complaints from before you were even born, Mr. Immortal.”

The man scrunched up the form, frustrating he couldn’t do anything to get this application through. “This isn’t over. I’ll find a way to get my pension.”

“Why don’t you try doing it online? That way, no one would see your face. I mean, they’ll still see your driver’s licence, but it’s less suspicious.” She said, deciding to offer him an actual piece of advice now that this conversation was dragging on close to her lunch break.

“Huh, that’s actually… helpful?” Xavier didn’t know what to make of that. He unfolded the scrunched up paper with a smile and scribbled a few compliments onto it. “Thank you. I’ll do just that.” He said, before putting his form in the thank you/compliments box. As the paper landed inside, a puff of dust escaped the box, like a spirit had been freed from its confines.

As Xavier left, a new person stepped forward, only to get blocked by Diana’s ‘be back soon’ sign. “Lunch break.” She said, leaving the line of already frustrated customers more agitated. Before leaving her desk, she smiled. “If you have any complaints, feel free to write them down. We are always looking to improve our services.” She teased, heading to lunch.",2,1734066363.0,Sadnesslaughs,0,1.0,False

Will use fake names. 

Me = Jane 

Boyfriend = Mike 

Ex-Boyfriend = Adam 

Mike and I booked a very nice hotel for last weekend (December 6-8) in the city and we were planning to enjoy it together as we’ve been dating for 6 month. 

[NSFW] 

We were having sex on Saturday and it just got really intense. He started dirty talking and I did too, and during sex he said *“Jane I fucking love you”.* I don’t know why, but I said my ex’s name instead like *“Oh Adam I love you too and I love when you fuck me”* 

I know I made a big mistake because their names are really different, I don’t know what I was thinking...I probably wasn’t at the time. It’s worse because Mike and I actually ran into Adam a week or two ago, but Mike is much more good looking and better in bed so I know it’s not an insecurity of his. 

When I said it, Mike literally got off me, started putting his clothes on and told me he needed space. He started packing his things even though we had two more nights booked at this super expensive hotel. I got a little upset and tried to hug him and bring him back but he just pushed me back onto the bed and to “leave me alone”. 

Since then, I texted him a long apology but he hasn’t replied to me in two days. He didn’t even read my message (we have read receipts). What should I do? He’s been so good to me and I can’t bear to lose him now 😭

>>Edit: WOW, this blew up right in my face! Thanks, Adam!

**Bun_Dad** 

>Jesus christ. That is a shit storm. Not only was it the exes name, but it was the exes name during sex. Not only was it the exes name during sex, it was in a complete ""Fuck me Daddy"" sentence after he said he loved you. 

>Wow. Yeah. Thata a big oof. Are you in contact with the ex still? Like is he in the same friend group or something? Maybe saying you will put even MORE distance between the two of you might help. Other than that it's up to him. 

>I would probably bounce after that. I am a jealous guy and I wouldn't be able to get that out of my head.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ef355d/update_i_f25_ruined_a_romantic_weekend_and_my/)  **Dec 24, 2019** 

[Copy of the update](https://imgur.com/a/gtMlgDn) 

He texted me later that day saying he’s unsure of being in a relationship even though it was a mistake. Then a couple days ago, he wanted to meet for coffee. 

It was very short. I have been texting my ex since we ran into him, but that was as its getting closer to the holidays and I wanted to catch up. All platonic. Mike asked if I was still talking to Adam since we ran into him and I said yes. 

He basically told me that it was the first time he said “I love you” and to hear me say someone else’s name back was unforgivable. And then he emphasized the rest as if I didn’t already know it was a mistake. He didn’t care for any apology and said that he hopes I don’t make the same mistake with my next boyfriend. 

6 months gone because I mixed up a name. Happy holidays.

Sunday dinners with your family or friends are also a great way to spend time with those you love. It can be literally anything and can be as simple as including another in something you have to do this weekend like grocery shopping or shoveling snow. 

These things may seem simple but you are caring for your relationship by intentionally seeking to make it stronger.

I tried to go to Bingsu last week Friday, and it was close to closing time, but they told me they're not serving anymore (there was 30ish mins till its closing) so I left. I still wanted to try it, so this week Monday I went at like 3 and it was dead and the two ladies saw me and immediately came from behind the counter and said they're closed for lunch - like what?? wouldnt the store be closed w some sort of notice??

Anyway that felt weird so today at 3 again, I went with two of my white friends to see if they were gonna pull this again. I went in first at 255ish, and they recognized me and same thing, theyre on ""lunch"". I leave, then my friends go in 5 minutes later, and they were ready to take my friend's orders?

1hd4tba,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1hd4tba/advice/,Advice...,"I have been dealing with gastritis for about a year, and I finally felt like I was getting somewhere very positive. I know a lot of doctors and pros these days don't like to think of stress as a cause anymore, but I am 48/49, got it (and reflux, seemingly managed) after almost a decade as my mother's Caregiver when she had dementia, including through the pandemic and it exploded when she died last year. 

I am probably a cliché as I had tried to recover without giving up caffeine and weed, and I used to drink a lot too. 

I recently stopped trying to negotiate with it, and when I realised ativan gave my gut extraordinary relief I started using it intermittently [I am afraid of benzos]. 

When it flares up, it hurts in my lower right side. I had a scope 7 months ago and Dr said I was fine but inflamed. Problem has been I used acid HCL supplements to fix my digestion and I have mild but annoying white tongue lpr that I could manage that way, but it obviously makes my inflammation worse.  

I finally did 15 days without any booze, weed, heavier food or caffeine. I went to Mexico and let my body relax properly for a few days.

 Today I had a couple half caff coffees and it was amazing. I have ADHD as well but can't take stimulant pills, so coffee is very important to me. 

I am a writer, and today I could write again for the first time in a little while. Then I took a sauna and stayed as hydrated as I could. A couple hours later, my back started to hurt. I made a bland, healthy meal and had to have another ativan, and I felt nauseus (not my normal gastritis reaction). I took a second ativan, which I do not like to do in the same 24 hours. 

So now I'm going to have to try more; I've been on PPI's in the past, they make me feel so horrible I get dangerous ""Do I want to live like this"" types of thoughts. 

I have been taking 12hr H2 blockers at night, and when I wake during the night I pound alkaline water. I stop eating hours before bed, and if I cheat its soda crackers. 

I won't be able to stop caffeine forever. I'm dumb, disorganised and unable to be productive without it. I can handle life without beer, weed and I can even accept it if I have to pay to get an operation on my LES (I'm in Canada and not used to the idea of paying for a medical procedure). 

But the reaction to my coffee today was very disappointing. The pain and cramps seemed gone, and were not even there until after my coffee was several hours old. Could it have been the sauna? 

Tonight back onto Pepsid, and no caffeine tomorrow. A couple of days ago I had an edible thinking it was the smoke but the dry mouth, etc was bad and I could tell that wasn't going to work, either. So I (re) wrote that idea off for now.  

I'm healthy otherwise. I am skinny if anything, I eat well. I exercise & I ride my bike everywhere. Physically I'm better now than in my 30s. 

I need my coffee back. I feel like I'm getting close, what can I still do? ",2,1734065724.0,Gastritis,3,1.0,False

I know for a fact I’m doing nothing wrong or out of norm socially but sincerely everyone avoids me. I hate it so much. I can’t bear the thought that this is the curse, the burden I’m forced to carry. 

It’s like what’s the point of accepting yourself if no one is going to be there to accept you as well? Why don’t I just die already? I’m not good enough for this reality or whatever this is.

I struggled a few times with eye contact and just articulating my thoughts but for the most part it was great and she seemed to feel the same. At the end though, I said something so cringeworthy as I was walking to my car, I said “I’m not alone anymore!”. This was of course in a joking manner, I just say weird things out of anxiety and awkwardness sometimes I guess. And she knows I have friends but they live in other states. But I’ve felt weird and extremely down and depressed for the rest of the day. Things like this make me feel so small, like an insecure loser. I don’t know why I can’t just not care and build up my self esteem. She is also very successful in her job and social life already and is a year younger. I graduated college a year before her and have been bouncing between low pay service jobs. She’s making enough to afford a 2k apartment by herself. I guess I feel like a 16 year old awkward kid sometimes and I hate it so much.

I had my coffee in one hand and my book in the other, ready to spend a peaceful morning on one of the benches overlooking the small pond in the park.

As I sat down, I noticed a woman with a toddler who seemed around three years old sitting at the opposite end of the bench. The woman was busy on a video call, loudly chatting about what sounded like work-related issues while the toddler toddled around the bench, exploring sticks, leaves, and pebbles.

At first, it was cute. The kid picked up a twig and waved it around like a wand, mumbling something about magic spells. I gave him a polite smile, and then went back to my book. But that wasn’t enough interaction for him.

He walked over to me and said, “What you reading?”

I showed him the cover. “It’s just a grown-up book, kiddo.”

“Is it boring?” he asked, tilting his head.

“Not to me,” I replied with a smile.

Apparently, that was an invitation to climb onto the bench right next to me. The next thing I knew, the kid was trying to grab my coffee cup. “What’s that? Is it chocolate milk?”

“No, it’s coffee. Hot and not for kids,” I said, pulling it away.

His mom, still on her call, didn’t even glance in our direction.

The boy then decided my book was more interesting and tried to snatch it out of my hands. I gently stopped him and said, “This is my book, little buddy. Why don’t you go play with your sticks again?”

He didn’t seem to like that suggestion because he frowned and then loudly declared, “I’m bored!”

I glanced at the mom, hoping she’d notice her child and step in. She was still deep in her call, gesturing animatedly with her free hand.

The kid then grabbed one of my shoelaces and tried to untie it. That was when I decided I needed to set some boundaries. I gently but firmly told him, “Hey, you shouldn’t grab people’s things. Why don’t you go show your mom what you found in the park?”

The boy turned to his mom and yelled, “MOM!” She briefly glanced at him, held up a finger to indicate “one minute,” and went right back to her call.

At this point, I was getting frustrated. I wasn’t there to babysit someone else’s child, especially without being asked. I stood up, grabbed my things, and moved to a different bench a little farther away.

The toddler seemed confused, and I heard him whining as I walked off. A few minutes later, I saw the mom storming over.

“Really? You couldn’t keep an eye on him for five minutes? I was on an important work call!” she said, clearly annoyed.

I was taken aback but calmly responded, “I’m sorry, but I’m not here to babysit. I came to enjoy the park in peace.”

She scoffed and walked off with her kid, muttering something under her breath.

Later, when I told my roommate about the incident, she said I could’ve been nicer and helped out since the mom might’ve been overwhelmed. Now I’m wondering—was I wrong for not stepping in and keeping her toddler entertained while she was on her call?",42,1734064722.0,AmITheJerk,25,0.95,False

When making requests for a former teacher to be a reference, please do NOT:

* Send long e-mails that are written by AI. We can tell.
* Dump rephrased subject learning outcomes into your request, claiming how important these are to your career. We can tell.
* Include pre-written reference letters generated with AI. We can tell.
* Put phrases like ""consistently performed at the highest level"" in your pre-written letter, when you scored 58% for the subject. We check.
* Expect us to remember all 1000 students we had in our classes over the previous 3 years.

The longer it has been since we taught you, the harder it is for us to remember enough about you to write a genuine reference. Offer to catch up over a coffee or Zoom to help us reconnect with you.

1hd4h6t,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrthodoxChristianity/comments/1hd4h6t/how_to_change_my_perception_of_loneliness_in/,How to change my perception of loneliness in social settings (as an adult) while struggling with depression?,"Hi y’all. I’m gonna try to keep this as concise and easy to read as possible, but I have a tendency to ramble. 

I have two major upcoming appointments — a scheduled visit with a PCP to discuss my depression as a concern, and (not yet scheduled but I’ve been reaching out) a meeting with a local priest to schedule Confession and join a parish after moving away from home. 

I’ve found myself frustrated with my struggles because I have a background in psychology / mental health / counseling so I know, intellectually, so much about motivational interviewing, therapy techniques, trauma responses, etc. but cannot for the life of me get a handle on my own issues. 

For context — I think the relevant issues in my life are focused on non-romantic friendships. About two years ago, the girl who was my very BEST friend of nearly seven years seemed to have a mental break and utterly abandoned me. Long story short, she randomly started responding in very mean ways (over text), refused to compromise to go on a trip with me (then made the very same compromise with a different friend), and revealed that she hasn’t considered me her best friend in a year and a half. 

This screwed me up in so many ways. I bawled my eyes out so bad, as a 22-year-old, that my dad came up to my room and tried comforting me as I broke down. After years of being healthy, I resorted to self-harm. And now, having moved to a new city and started fresh, I feel like this is all acting in the back of my mind as a barrier to deeper friendships. 

Now, I’ve found a wonderful group of people who I love. There’s literally five people that I care about, who I want to have in my life, who are healthy and kind role models and seem so genuine and funny and full of life. 

But I pick up on EVERY little thing they do, that isn’t in my favor. 

I notice when they have conversations without me, or talk in hushed voices about one thing or another when I’m around. 

I notice when I’m at a table in the library and they’re all with each other laughing about something. 

I notice when I’m left out of the loop or out of date with someone’s current events because I’m not included in conversations that have updates. 

I notice when everyone makes trips for coffee and exclude me. 

I notice so damn much and it hurts. 

I’ve spoken with one of the girls in the group about my insecurities and my issues and she assured me that there’s nothing malicious going on and no purposeful exclusion. 

And I know everyone’s got their own lives. And I know that coincidentally, our conflicting plans/schedules means that some of us will naturally find ourselves running into each other more often than not. 

But I still notice the moments when nobody remembers to save me a seat. Or when I’m quiet, alone with my thoughts, and they don’t ask if I’m okay. I’ve had days where my roommates or other classmates reach out to check in on me, but none of these closest “friends” checked in. 

And then I blame myself. Because I’ve found myself limiting conversations. I don’t ask people many questions, especially small talk, because if they’re comfortable and want to tell me they will. If they’re want to invite me they will. If they want to sit next to me they will. 

I just feel so unimportant and undervalued. But I also feel like so much of this is being misinterpreted and misunderstood by me because of my depressed mindset. I don’t want to be saddened every day when I see my friends being content and happy with my absence. 

I try to think of God, and tell myself that if these issues are real, then there’s a reason for it and that I was somehow meant to experience this. I try to be thankful for the good moments. I try so hard. 

But I’m so deeply sad. I’m so frustrated. All my life I’ve tried to be a kind, gentle presence. But I’m loud and raucous and adventurous — not very gentle. But I’m kind. I always try to follow up when someone is interrupted. I always try to include people and invite everyone. Why am I always the one left out? Why don’t my friends do the same kindness for me? And I am NOT by any means insinuating I’m above anyone else, or better than anyone else. I just know that my friends are important to me and I want to be around them so I find myself so freaking depressed understanding that if they wanted to (if they wanted to sit with me, talk to me, etc) they literally would. But they don’t. 

So. Again, will be talking to a PCP regarding depression. And I’m hoping to settle in with my new parish and get spiritual advice not regularly. 

But from an everyday perspective, what advice do you all have? I’m getting so tired of being sad. Would never become suicidal, but just so depressed. I sometimes want to return to self harm, but I’ve not come close for the last year. I’m just woeful and sad.

1hd4gqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1hd4gqg/feel_like_im_in_a_dream/,Feel like I'm in a dream,"Me and this girl were born 1 day apart and grew up in a small town in the Midwest. From 1st to 4th grade I ""dated"" every girl in class, but never her, because it actually meant something with her, then I moved away halfway through 4th grade.

We reconnected a few times at a fair and a debate tournament and a party, then started dating and moved in with each other when we were 21. I was an out of control pothead-alcoholic-acidhead, and she was the other half of me, but sober. The only person who understood my jokes.

We fell madly in love. We got a dog, a cat, and a house with a white picket fence. We spent every waking moment together, like twins with our own language. She adopted my weed smoking habits and unfortunately my alcoholism, too. But all in all, life was perfect. Every day I woke up next to her and every day we pushed each other to be our best selves and got super into cycling and backpacking. Spent many days walking through the woods and doing it, constantly.

Backpacked/hitchhiked to Colorado. Played music on the streets for money. Saw the most beautiful sights to see. Spent 2 weeks living in the mountains, completely away from the world. Made loads of friends. Had a ton of crazy adventures and hiked tons of mountains. We made it there and back safe. Everyone thought we were crazy. Best time of both our lives.

At 26 or so I became a devil of an alcoholic. I let my nonexistent ego take over. I took everything in my life for granted. I was actively provoking death. She left. I got worse. She didn't want to see me die.

4 years later I was at Death's door, coughing up blood in a frozen forest. I felt like how a cat must feel when it goes off to die alone. So I decided I didn't want to die and asked for help.

Eventually, I got healthier and learned self-respect. I got sober. I've been sober about a year and a half, now. I hadn't talked to her in 6 years. I knew I couldn't stay sober with her in the picture. Addiction is weird. I couldn't let her see how weak I was without my chemical crutch, so I ghosted her.

She recently reached out to me and asked if I wanted to talk after all this time apart. I don't even feel slightly like that person she used to know. I messaged her, made sure she wasn't in a relationship, and asked how she's been and all that. She ended up with some guy who told her all the things she wanted to hear and he came inside her and she had a child. Now they're not together, but live under the same roof.

She came over to my place tonight. It was perfect. We talked about what's happened over the years. How I'm sober and she's trying to get sober, but stuck in this house with this abusive guy.

We can still talk to each other without speaking, though we did, but mostly were just happy to see that we're both still alive. It was like a dream. We laid on my bed and just held each other.

We didn't fuck or anything. We just were. And it was perfect. She went home a few minutes ago. She kissed me on the cheek and I kissed her on the head. Far from our crazy days of waking up naked in fields and shit. It doesn't feel real. It still feels like I'm in a dream.

I walked her out to her car and we parted ways. We're going to go to the aquarium tomorrow, or Christmas shopping, or to a book store to drink coffee or whatever.

I don't want anything else in life. This is all I ever wanted. Peace. And it feels like I have my other half back in my life, but we're not stupid kids anymore.

I don't know exactly what advice I'm looking for. I guess... I don't want to mess this up. I want to take whatever this is slow, and do everything right. Nobody else is her. And the feeling's mutual.

Should I just enjoy living in this dream, and take life as it comes? Because that sounds smart. Pinch me.",2,1734064484.0,AskMenAdvice,5,1.0,False

She was attractive and mentioned things she loved, so I rizzed her up and got a date 👏. We texted every day leading up to the date, which lasted about six hours and cost me around $150 altogether, went to this place she wanted to visit every since she moved to (the state we are in) and then spontaneously went to a coffee shop too she wanted to explore in said city we went to and i said “lets do it lets be spontaneous”. I was pretty sure it went well because she seemed interested in a second date. Even talked the whole time about topics I prepared for to make the date interesting. She even suggested we go to a sushi place then coffee after for the next date.

After a week, though, she started dodging my texts and would only reply every other day then stopped all together. I decided to ask her about it, saying communication was important and I didn’t want either of us to waste our time if she was having second thoughts. She assured me everything was fine, said she’d been busy with work and the holidays, and told me she would absolutely love a second date. She even called me to confirm this.

Despite that, she stopped initiating any communication. I sent her a text in the morning and another in the afternoon—nothing special, just wishing her a good day and mentioning that I was going to a friend’s house to game. When I got home, I discovered she had blocked me on everything 🤣.

One of the things she talked about a lot was how important communication was and how no one seems to communicate their feelings anymore, so I find it incredibly hypocritical that she pretended everything was fine when it clearly wasn’t.

To top it off, she didn’t even look like her profile pictures, so she pretty much catfished me. Even then, I gave her a chance because I liked her personality 🤣. She was still attractive, just not the same as in her photos for clarification.

Anyway, I’m just ranting. A whole month wasted over poor communication on her end. 


By the way we also called everyday before the date even up to a week after the date calling. Calls that would last up to 3 hours on average. PLEASE COMMUNICATE if you changed your mind about someone.


She also talked non stop about her ex so im guessing she wasn’t over him so that might’ve had something to do with it? She also trauma dumped everything on me during our date and at the end of the night. Anyways lesson learned😮‍💨",2,1734064119.0,Bumble,5,1.0,False

Hey folks, I plan on opening a cafe.

The plans are at a really initial stage, however I would like to understand from you folks - what are the most important pointers for you all to go for a new cafe? I have made some observations that I am listing below: 

1. Speciality coffee (obviously) and at what price?

2. Croissant or food items that go with coffee (need your help here)

3. Ambience (Instagram friendly?) - I prefer natural light of a glass door kinda setting but would love to know what do people like?

4. Ergonomic seating (I have personally faced this - as table are sometimes too small and not in line with elbows)

5. Activities to go along with coffee - helps?

6. Music/Vibe

7. Concept Cafe (does that entice you? - like sending a postcard/sports/sitcom)

8. Location?

- Also, what makes you go back to a cafe again? 

- Customer Obsession and good coffee can be the only USP that I can think of right now that can set me apart here.

Lastly, I like to drink a bit of beer or wine here and there with the very rare getting high off of a cart and edibles.

Hey everyone, I’d like to inform you this is a pretty long post. Thank you in advance if you choose to read it. 

We’ve dated since we were young. What pushed me over the edge with the already-toxic relationship was that 2 years into it, when we seemed to be smooth sailing, she full on cheated. I know I should’ve seen this coming given how our relationship started, but I really believed that she wasn’t going to actually do anything with anyone. For context, she had pressured me to have sex with her regularly, and I told her I still wasn’t ready (I’ve been assaulted before and I was still attending therapy trying to get through it, among other things). She cheated while I was out of the country for a couple weeks. She broke the news while I was there and when I came back she told me it had been happening since way before I left. That day she kept insisting that my not having sex was the reason she went to someone else, and of course, I gave in and just did it. I stuck with her for several years afterwards

We had a lot of issues. One that stood out was that she was really hyper sexual and knew how to guilt me subtly, and so we would just have sex all the time which was exhausting to me - I still have a lot of trauma from this. For the following years I would just zone out during sex and withdraw completely. In those years I would catch her texting the person she cheated with from time to time, and she’d start begging an d pleading and crying. I was and still am a shell of a person because of this relationship and didn’t leave her. 

She left me earlier this year. I stopped talking to her by March and got my stuff back by April. In June she asked me if I thought we’d ever be together again. I said absolutely not. She said she hopes that she can be in my life again and I said no. 

I think about her every day. I am currently going through a lot of shit - my health has deteriorated and I’ve been in and out of doctors appts, I lost a lot of my friends, don’t speak to my sister anymore, moved cities, I’m depressed and anxious as ever, and I haven’t been with anyone since her. All I want to do is reach out and tell her if she’s ever in town we should get coffee. I know I don’t want to be in a relationship with her and at the same time I don’t want her to have moved on already. She was my best friend for so many years. I’ve done extensive therapy, I took antidepressants, I have a healthy diet and regularly exercise, a great job, etc. but I’m currently miserable and think about her every second of every day. I have dreams about her almost every night. I really need to know how to not reach out to her. What’s worse is I felt like I was actually standing on my own two feet up until October. It started creeping back in like it always does and I don’t know what to do. If anyone has any advice, I’m in desperate need. Thank you. ",1,1734063440.0,BPD_Survivors,1,1.0,False
