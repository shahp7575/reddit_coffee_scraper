I am looking at a recipe for GF coffee cake (https://meaningfuleats.com/gluten-free-coffee-cake-with-sour-cream/) and it calls for 1 1/2 cups 1:1 GF flour. Problem is, I only have about 1 cup! But I do also have enough almond flour to make up the difference. Would this be doable? Are there any considerations with bake times, would i need to add more xantham gum, or anything else i need to keep in mind for it to work? Or do I just go ahead and buy another bag of 1:1?

1r9pq6t,https://www.reddit.com/r/StartupAccelerators/comments/1r9pq6t/ive_been_doomscrolling_1star_reviews_which_turned/,I’ve Been Doomscrolling 1-Star Reviews which turned out to be a goldmine!!!,"Yes you heard me right!

Lately I’ve been entertaining myself in a very questionable way. 

Reading negative reviews, Not even kidding, it’s more educational than half the startup advice floating around. When users get annoyed enough, they explain exactly what’s broken with absolutely no filter. It’s basically raw product feedback without the corporate sugar coating. 

Some repetitive comments that caught my eye were: 

**Weather apps are weirdly dramatic for tools that check the Sky**. 

you look outside. Perfect sunshine                                                                                           You check the app. Storm incoming.                                                                                                                                      

 Every weather app behaves like it has a flair for suspense. AccuWeather, The Weather Channel, doesn’t matter. Reviews are full of people saying the same thing, How are you this confident and this wrong? Honestly, an app that just admits uncertainty would already feel more trustworthy. Nobody expects psychic powers. Just don’t hallucinate rain.

 **Calendar apps love turning simple planning into admin Work** 

All you wanted was to note a meeting. Suddenly you’re managing colors, views, settings, reminders, layouts. Google Calendar wins because it’s glued into everything, but using it isn’t exactly a joyful experience. There’s a lot of silent friction in scheduling that nobody talks about. Users don’t want to “manage” time. They just want clarity. 

**To do list apps that drives us crazy** 

 Task apps have a habit of feature spirals. You install it to remember groceries. Next thing you know you’re dealing like that one girl with color coded notes. By the time everything is perfectly organized, you’re too tired to actually do the tasks. 

There's a reason minimal tools like Todoist keep their user base. Fast entry, low ceremony, done. Complexity is rarely the selling point users think they want. 

**Expense trackers that eat us alive** 

Manual expense logging always sounds responsible. It also always collapses. Nobody consistently records every coffee purchase like a disciplined finance monk. Apps like Walnut got popular by scraping SMS data because they stopped pretending users would behave perfectly. 

Good financial tools assume laziness and work with it, not against it. 

**Builder tools underestimate how annoying design decisions are** 

This one’s funny. Creator tools love advertising freedom. Total control. Infinite customization. In reality, that often means endless tiny decisions. Padding, alignment, spacing, fonts, layouts. It’s mentally draining. A lot of builders would happily trade freedom for sane defaults and structure. 

That’s why tools like PrettiFlow(https://prettiflow.tech) are interesting. They lean into components and guardrails so you’re not stuck micromanaging visuals for hours. You build faster, things look decent by default, life moves on. Most people building products care about momentum, not pixel perfection.

1r9ph40,https://youtube.com/shorts/P8rxT2pR4f8?si=oaZtqK8Z0TP8gkpp,Why I Hired an Affordable Reputation Management Specialist,"Here is a comprehensive, professionally written article based on the YouTube Shorts concept. It expands on the ""why"" behind hiring an ORM specialist and integrates [**RepHaven.com**](https://rephaven.com/) as the authoritative solution.

Buried Alive: Why Suppressing Negative Content with a Professional ORM Service is Your Best Career Move

You can’t delete the internet, but you can control the narrative. Here is why ""suppression"" is the only winning strategy, and where to find affordable help.

We have all been there. You are sitting in a coffee shop before a big date, or waiting in a conference room for a job interview to start. You pull out your phone. You type your name into Google.

Your heart sinks.

There, sitting at the top of the search results, is that old article, that angry customer review, or that misguided social media post from a decade ago. It is inaccurate. It is unfair. And right now, it is the first impression the world has of you.

The immediate instinct is panic. The second instinct is to try to fix it yourself or find a way to hit the ""delete"" button. But in the world of Online Reputation Management (ORM), deletion is a myth.

If you want to take back your name, you need to understand the science of **suppression**—and why hiring a professional service like [**RepHaven.com**](https://rephaven.com/) is the most affordable and effective solution available today.

# The Myth of the ""Delete"" Button

Let us address the elephant in the room: You cannot force legitimate websites to take down content just because you don't like it. Unless the content is defamatory, harassing, or a direct violation of a platform's terms of service, it is likely here to stay.

Fighting to get something removed is like running on a treadmill. You expend a massive amount of energy and end up in the exact same place: stressed out and stuck with a negative result.

This is where the average person gives up. They accept that their digital legacy is tarnished. But the savvy professional knows that there is a second option.

# The Science of Suppression

The goal of ORM is not to erase the past; it is to build a bigger, better, and more relevant present.

Search engines prioritize relevance and authority. If you search for ""John Smith,"" Google wants to show you the most pertinent information about *that* John Smith. If all you have online is that one negative article, Google assumes that is what you want to see.

However, if ""John Smith"" suddenly has a professional LinkedIn profile, a personal portfolio website, a Medium blog about his industry, and positive mentions on established news sites, Google's algorithm shifts. It now has more data to work with.

This is **suppression**. By flooding the first page of Google with positive, high-quality assets, you physically push the negative content down to Page Two. And as any SEO expert will tell you: ""The best place to hide a dead body is Page Two of Google."" No one clicks that far.

# Why ""Doing It Yourself"" Fails

It sounds simple, right? Just make a few websites and you are done. Unfortunately, ORM is not that simple. There is a reason why young professionals fail when they try to clean up their own reputation:

1. **Domain Authority:** Creating a blog on a free platform won't outrank an established news site. A professional ORM strategy uses high-authority platforms and SEO tactics to compete.
2. **Time:** SEO is a long game. Without a strategy, you are publishing content into the void while the negative content stays comfortably at the top.
3. **Consistency:** You need a steady stream of content to signal to Google that you are active and relevant. Most people make one post, give up, and assume the internet is broken.

# The Affordable ORM Solution: Hiring a Professional

This is why turning to a specialist is the best idea for any professional on a budget. You don't need a high-priced law firm; you need a strategic partner who understands the landscape.

Enter [**RepHaven.com**](https://rephaven.com/).

RepHaven bridges the gap between affordability and high-level strategy. They understand that as a young professional, you are building your brand, not just managing a crisis. Their approach focuses on:

* **Asset Creation:** They help build professional profiles and content that showcase your expertise.
* **Strategic Suppression:** They target the specific negative keywords keeping you up at night and build a wall of positive content around them.
* **Sustainable Results:** Rather than a one-time fix, they help you establish a digital footprint that grows with your career, ensuring that old ghosts stay buried.

# The Bottom Line

Your online reputation is your modern handshake. It is the first thing people see, and it often dictates whether they decide to trust you.

Stop letting a random page on the internet define who you are. You cannot delete the past, but you can absolutely bury it beneath a better future.

If you are ready to stop stressing about your search results and start controlling them, visit [**RepHaven.com**](https://rephaven.com/). It is the most affordable investment you can make in your future self.

Hello!  I launched my first humans about an hour ago.  I did three, and worked pretty hard to make them big and strong.  It all went pretty well, though I have some secrets at Exodus I still need to get to.  I probably also need to make my setup there a bit more efficient.  

The pod came down as expected, announced by the AI and shown on the map.  It was about 0.5km away.  I boated over, and saw a bunch of stuff in the water, a good 100m from the pod.  At first I thought it was  bio matter from some worms, but it was clearly loot.  I jumped in and got it, and saw it was stuff like memories and those quantum things that I tried and never made again.  I also noted that the hatch on the pod was open.

I went down into the pod anyway, and it was empty.  I'm guessing the contents got dumped into the ocean somehow.  I've got pictures of the stuff in the water, the pod, and my inventory with the loot.  Does this look like what you'd get from sending 3 beefy humans into space?

I am told by several dentists that I am grinding my teeth during my sleep which is causing them to break near my gumline. The broken teeth became black and even got sensitive after some time and I got fillings there. In addition to this, the tips of my front top teeth became transparent. Consuming so much coffee, tea and cigarettes with these caused me to have 3-tone teeth (natural yellow ones, fillings and transparent part).

Now, I want to fix this. I went to a few dentists and they offered ceramic or zirconia veneers. However I am only 26 years old and I have absolutely no problems with my teeth except the looks. They are also aligned perfectly. I really do not want them to be cut down for zirconia or ceramic.

With my own research, I learnt that composite veneers do not require the teeth to be cut, easier to do, and also cheaper. I know the lifespan is shorter, but I will be happy to keep my own teeth and getting treatment every 3-5 years until they are not healthy anymore.

Thank you for responding so well. I really liked the idea of getting her the same coffee as mine, which I carry everyday along with me while I commute.

Thought of reaching the station till 8:15 to be show up before she reaches. Stopped at the coffee shop to get the 2 of them, my barista was also delighted to know that I finally have someone to share my coffee with.

Was walking towards the common spot with coffee in both my hands. I was quite chill up till this point but to my surprise, I see her already standing there, surfing her phone. Holy shit, she was already there before me. All my rehearsed conversations went down the drain of me being on time and waiting for her.

I was recalculating everything when she looked up in between and immediately caught my attention. As she saw me, she had a playful smile on her face. I cannot forget that smile. I literally melted over there. Lol, sorry for being mushy.

Even I started walking towards her, with a smile on my face. Nobody could have guessed that I was imagining scenarios in the meantime. “Hii”. I greeted her with enthusiasm. She reciprocated with a “Hii” too, with that smile being a constant on her face.

Luckily, she was a coffee person as well and I can tell that it was a good move to bring her a coffee. We introduced ourselves and spoke for a while before the metro arrived. We boarded together and to our fortune, seats were empty for us to sit together.

We started talking and I got to know about Einstein’s analogy of his theory of relativity. My commute till work takes around 25 minutes usually but it didn’t felt a second more than 5 minutes. Although, we didn’t speak out loud, the entire coach felt our presence. I could feel the spark, even she was enjoying my company, it seemed.

When we de boarded the metro, she asked for my number herself, before parting ways. I gave her my business card instead of verbally giving her my number.

“Woah, so I am talking to a finance guy”. She told me after looking at my card. I responded with a cheesy line. “Well, people usually contact me for money but you can contact me for honey, too”. Even I felt this was a bit over the top, lol.

She just told “BYE” with a broad and mischievous smile before going her way. I was literally replaying all my conversations in my head till I reached my office. Most probably, we’ll meet for a lunch/dinner in a few days.

Thank you very much fellow redditors. As you can see, I used a lot of your inputs in my approach and it turned out quite well. You guys helped your bro get a very good girl for a date. Thank you for reading and responding. Peace Out ✌️☮️",2,1771574277.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

He is now throwing everything I give him to eat or drink on purpose, even if its his favorite and he knows he can't get it back once it's thrown. It started with chips, crackers, gold fish. I give him the snack in a bowl or zip lock bag and he dumps it on the ground purposefully then cries. He then did it with a bowl of cereal, plate of Mac and cheese, yogurt, milkshake from a coffee stand you name it. After it happens, my husband and I cant help but get frustrated with him. He isn't communicating like kids his age so we can't get a clear answer from him on what he's feeling but it almost always ends in a full blown crying melt down. My other kid and other kids in my family never did this. I'm wondering if it's maybe because of his autism, is he trying to show control or autonomy? We have tried showing zero reactions and that didn't help either. I'm at my wits end we are not only wasting so much food but he is doing it when he is not in our care as well.

Story ideas

Preamble, Preface, Prologue

Inspired by Creepcast

“

What are big recurring themes in my life?

One of my dreams is to own a gothic coffee shop on “goth street” in Northampton

Ideas:

Machinists nightmare, ripped into the machine

The quabbin reservoir

Dying alone

Ocean (navy)

 

Aspects:

Car with its wipers on max during summer

My left driver side speaker is taking a nap after blasting lady Gaga Kate bush and tool. I car well loved. Every so often I’ll hit a bump and it’ll fix it

Licking a nine volt

Loss ofnchildren or family; nostalgia and melancholy

Bittersweet 

Vomiting

7stages of grief

Keef joint

Meat, there’s so much meat, things with shields that look like sirloin and bows of long sinewed flesh. (The opposite of machinery)

Random sound of a toilet where you wouldn’t hear that

Have it take place in Oregon?

“I fall, feeling my fleeting footfalls, I fear, miss the flowering, petal filled, flower pot. And as I search for any quiet respite for my peddling phalanges upon my feet, I fear again that I have failed to feel the floor. Bound to such fate by fate and forces beyond my field of focus or fortune. The lady fortune smiles upon my freckled, frosted, and faint pale face.

Machinist nightmare:

Zombies. TWD. Scare Alice a lil extra

Rachel and Jenna does special affects

Technology is the way for demons to speak without speaking. It is a portal for evil to come through

Infected injuries from the shop

“I’ve always been superstitious”

Scene of pain and anger “WH-HYYY-HYYYY”

Trapped in the WNE machine shop (or Pathfinder?)

Shot of CNC mill flashing on with a program and part running; coolant 

“Feed me” on the walls

Speaking in tongues (“nothing to excess”, tongue clicking and sucking)

Collant filling with blood

Angels, nephelim, and neo-nazis. (Ignore the nazis lowkey)

Pissing pants “ok ok I understand I understand” but he’s talking to schizo voice”

A character that falls in love with an only fans model; drag race?

Walking away from each other

“We’ll talk later”

“Alright”

stephen looks down and sees a letter addressed to one of Gene H. PhD. He grabs it before she can see and runs inside.

Running up the stairs he panted. “Hey Stephen?” She called from the entrance way.

She was still brushing her feet off. Up the stairs, hot coffee poured on skin. “Stephen!”Oozing and sizzling. Slam the door behind me and

The problem: every AI headshot tool I've tried gives wildly different backgrounds and lighting for each person. One looks like they're in a corporate office, another looks like a coffee shop, and the third is in some weird blurred beige void.

What I need:

- Consistent style/lighting across all team members

- Professional but not overly formal

- Same general background vibe (doesn't need to be identical, just cohesive)

- Ideally something where I can set parameters once and apply to everyone

Has anyone dealt with this? Is there a tool that lets you lock in a specific style/environment and then generate multiple people with that same look?

1r9orpa,https://magazinekave.com/en-us/articles/87,The Barrier of Hangul...Why Do Foreigners Get Frustrated?,"Hangul, which seems theoretically perfect, becomes a huge barrier in practice. Many foreign learners study for over two years and still get frustrated because they cannot distinguish the subtle pronunciation differences of Koreans. The biggest challenge is distinguishing between 'plain sounds (e.g., ㄱ, ㅂ, ㄷ)', 'tensed sounds (e.g., ㄲ, ㅃ, ㄸ)', and 'aspirated sounds (e.g., ㅋ, ㅍ, ㅌ)'. For English speakers, 'g' and 'k' are distinguishable, but the Korean 'ㄱ' is somewhere in between or changes depending on the situation. Especially, 'tensed sounds' are produced by tensing the vocal cords, a phonation method rare in Western languages.



Plain sound (gabang): Starts at a low pitch and softly.



Aspirated/Tensed sound (kkabang/kabang): Strongly at a relatively high pitch.



When pronouncing ""gabang (bag)"", Koreans unconsciously start with a low tone, but foreigners pronounce it high, making it sound like ""kkabang"". This is not a consonant issue but a tone or intonation issue. If one does not realize that not only the intensity but also the pitch of the sound contributes to distinguishing meaning, no matter how much they mimic the mouth shape, they cannot produce native-like sounds.



Another structural feature of Hangul is the 'initial+medial+final' block structure. Here, the final consonant, or 'batchim', plays a role in blocking or altering the flow of sound.



Representative sound phenomenon: Leaf (ip), mouth (ip) have different letters but end with the same pronunciation \[ip\]. This phenomenon, converging into seven representative sounds (ㄱ,ㄴ,ㄷ,ㄹ,ㅁ,ㅂ,ㅇ), is economical but a chaos of confusion for learners doing dictation.  



Consonant assimilation: 'Gukmul' changes to \[gungmul\], 'simni' changes to \[simni\]. This is 'fluidity' that resembles the nature of the following word for ease of pronunciation.



I would like to interpret this in connection with the 'relationship-oriented culture' of Korean society. I (the preceding letter) am not a fixed entity but willingly change my appearance (pronunciation) in relation to others (the following letter). Korean pronunciation rules thoroughly aim for 'harmony' and 'softness'. This linguistic habit, which avoids abrupt breaks and prefers flowing liquid and nasal sounds, is also connected to the culture of 'jeong' (affection) embedded in the collective unconscious of Koreans.



The ultimate level of Korean grammar, the world of particles.



Situation A: ""Who is Park Su-nam?"" -〉 ""I (ga/iga) am Park Su-nam."" (Focus on the subject as new information)



Situation B: ""What kind of person is Park Su-nam?"" -〉 ""I (neun/eun) am a reporter."" (The subject is already known, focus on the following explanation)



This is more of an 'information structure' issue than grammar. Only by understanding where the speaker is shining the spotlight in the conversation can the correct particle be chosen. This subtle nuance, which even AI translators often mistake, ultimately belongs to the realm of 'nunchi' (tact), which can only be internalized through the accumulation of numerous human-to-human conversation data.



As of 2026, the language learning market has passed the technological singularity. If past learning was a lonely battle memorizing texts at a desk, now it is a hybrid experience combining AI and the metaverse.



Evolution of AI Tutor: The 'Korean Ai App' service 'Mycot' goes beyond simple Q&A. It analyzes the user's emotions and corrects even the subtle pitch of pronunciation. Especially, 'Teuida', reviewed in , offers first-person perspective virtual conversation scenarios, providing an immersive experience as if you were the protagonist in a drama. Their slogan, ""To learn swimming, you must enter the water; to learn Korean, you must speak,"" is accurate. However, as user reviews point out, short word recognition failures or technical limitations of voice recognition still exist. AI is an excellent sparring partner but cannot perfectly simulate the uncertainty of the real ring (reality).  



Metaverse Sejong Institute: Led by the Korean government, the Metaverse Sejong Institute gathers learners from around the world into a virtual space. In 2025, learners walk through Namdaemun Market in Seoul with their avatars and order coffee in a virtual cafe from their rooms. Research has proven that this metaverse-based learning effectively increases learner immersion and reduces anxiety. It is a new way of forming a 'language community' beyond the constraints of physical space.



With numerous apps pouring in, strategic choices according to the learner's disposition are necessary. The positioning of major apps in 2026 analyzed by the author is as follows.





\[K-LANGUAGE 2\] The Barrier of Hangul...Why Do Foreigners Get Frustrated? \[Magazine Kave=Park Su nam\]

""Throw away the books and turn on Netflix."" This is no longer a joke. Shadowing drama lines like a shadow is the best way to internalize intonation and speed. The dopamine from transcribing BTS lyrics and translating interviews of your favorite actors is a more powerful motivator than any textbook. Learners in 2026 are not passive recipients but active producers (Prosumers) who create subtitles and perform fan translations.



Learning Korean is the process of internalizing the hierarchy of Korean society. As seen in , between asking ""Did you eat?"" and ""Did you dine?"" lies the aesthetics of social distancing beyond mere age difference.



Many Western learners complain at this point, ""Why is it so complicated?"" But this is evidence of how much Korean society values 'relationships'. Language constantly reaffirms the positions of oneself and others and acts as a GPS to set appropriate distances. Using informal speech indicates that the sense of distance has converged to zero (0), a sign of intimacy, while using honorifics signals securing a safe distance of mutual respect.



Korean outside textbooks evolves like a living organism. As of 2026, Korea's linguistic landscape is a mix of the language of the MZ generation dreaming of a 'God-saeng (diligent and exemplary life)' and the Alpha generation born with smartphones in hand.  



The economics of abbreviation: 'Eoljuk-a (frozen to death but still iced Americano)', 'Jaman-chu (pursuing natural meetings)' show the unique economy of Korean that compresses long sentences into four syllables. This reflects the speed battle of busy modern society.



Symbolization of emotions: Texts composed only of consonants/vowels like 'ㅋㅋㅋ', 'ㅎㅎㅎ', 'ㅠㅠ' are hieroglyphs of the digital age. The list (ㅇㅈ, ㄱㄱ, ㅂㅂ) is now a code that must be memorized to chat with Koreans on KakaoTalk.  



Projection of social anxiety: Neologisms like 'stupid cost', 'impulse spending from stress' reflect the sad self-portrait of modern people trying to relieve stress through consumption in a high-cost, competitive society. Learning slang is a humanistic reading of the desires and deficiencies of that society.



No matter how advanced AI becomes, there are words it cannot translate. 'Jeong' is not just love or friendship. It is a sticky bond mixed with love and hate, an expression of the collective self that you and I are not strangers. 'Nunchi' is the ability to hear what is not said, the ability to grasp context. Being good at Korean is not just knowing many words but reading this invisible air and riding its flow.



How to Approach?

\[Step 1: 0\~3 months\] Draw a Map of Sounds (Physical Training)

This period is about training the 'body', not the brain.



Internalize the principles of Hangul characters: 'ㄱ' is the shape of the tongue root blocking the throat, 'ㄴ' is the shape of the tongue touching the gums. Check the structure inside your mouth in the mirror. Use visual materials like 90 Day Korean PDF to map letters and pronunciation organs.



Infinite Input: It doesn't matter if you don't know the meaning. Play Korean radio or podcasts for more than an hour a day like background music. Wait until the unique intonation and rhythm of Korean carve a path in the auditory cortex of your brain.



Use pronunciation apps: Eliminate the fear of opening your mouth with apps like Teuida. AI won't laugh at you even if you make mistakes hundreds of times



\[Step 2: 3\~6 months\] Into the Sea of Patterns and Context (Pattern Recognition)

Do not memorize grammar rules like math formulas. Language is a pattern.



Master verb conjugation: The core of Korean sentences is at the end (verb). Learn the patterns of ending changes like '-yo', '-seumnida', '-eoseo'.  



Shadowing: Choose a character from your favorite drama. Copy exactly the speed, breath, and emotion of their lines. Mimicking an actor's performance is the best way to swallow the context whole.



Forget word lists: Throw away flashcards with only words. Learn words in sentences. Words without context are dead data.



\[Step 3: 6 months\~\] Expansion of Self

Now it's time to express your thoughts and feelings in Korean.



Beyond survival to living: Go out and interact with real Koreans through HelloTalk, Tandem, or local communities like Culcom. ""The courage to make mistakes"" builds skill.



Understanding Sino-Korean words: To reach advanced vocabulary, grasp the concept of Sino-Korean words. Knowing 'hak (學)' is 'learning' leads to 'school', 'student', 'academy', 'study' like a string of sweet potatoes.  



Sublimation of fandom: Analyze your favorite K-Culture content and comment in Korean. Fandom activities are the most powerful language learning community.



Philosopher Wittgenstein said, ""The limits of my language mean the limits of my world."" Learning Hangul is not merely acquiring a new skill. It is the act of incorporating into your world the emotions of the Korean Peninsula with a 5,000-year history, King Sejong's spirit of love for the people, and the dynamic digital civilization of 2026.



Hangul is not perfect. Irregular pronunciations and complex honorifics will trouble you. But within that imperfection lies a human, all too human charm. The language of 'jeong' created by fragmented individuals longing for each other's warmth. In the era of cold AI and algorithms, Hangul may still be the last bastion of humanism with warm blood flowing.



You who are reading this now, do not be afraid and speak out. ""Annyeonghaseyo."" The resonance of those five short letters will open the door to a new world that will change your life.

Some of it was valid. Some of it wasn’t. Either way I paid attention.  
  
Over the last few months:

	•	We upgraded to a Probat roaster

	•	I’ve personally taken over roasting

	•	We rebuilt our profiles from scratch

	•	We even changed the name from Pink Bourbon to Pink Bloom based on feedback   
  
No ego. Just better coffee.  
  
I’m sharing our latest roast profile screenshots (phase splits, gas/airflow changes, development %, etc.) for transparency.   
  
Pink Bloom (natural):

	•	\~14–16% development

	•	\~38–40% Maillard

	•	Clean declining RoR

	•	No crash / no flick

  
Curves are one thing. The cup is what matters.   
  
So I’m sending Pink Bloom samples to 20 people from this sub, especially if you’ve been critical before.  
  
No conditions. Review it honestly. Publicly.

I have the dual boiler machine, the niche grinder, and the distribution tools that look like acupuncture needles. But the one thing I couldn't nail was the cups.

I convinced myself it was worth it for the thermal mass and the heritage factor. They arrived yesterday in a plain cardboard box. The cups were nice, heavy, and white.

The curve of the handle, the thickness of the rim, everything.  
  
The price? About two dollars a unit if you order a case. I basically paid a 1500% markup because I fell for a website with a nice font. They are great cups, don't get me wrong.

2 nights kanazawa  
1 night Takayama  
2 nights Magome  
3 nights Shimoda, Izu  
1 night Narita



**Some quick questions/advice if anyone is able to answer:**

1. How busy should i expect these areas to be as it is cherry blossom season and also during when the weather is getting warmer (kanazawa for example). We dont have any days in Kyoto, Osaka or Tokyo.

2. How should we go about booking shinkansen AND bus tickets (such as the ones to magome and takayama using nohi bus route)? i know the areas like tokyo will be busy and i dont want to wait in line and miss the last shinkansen (over-panicking lol) to go to kanazawa but i also dont want to book one too early, with reserved seats, then miss it and have to wait for available unreserved seats (will this even be an issue? last time we took the shinkansen to nagano (same line) the unreserved seats were plentiful which was around december 12th 2024)

3. Another thing is my extra luggage, I will have a bag or suitcase full of stuff from my trip in hokkaido as I will be going for volleyball training/tournaments and wont need any of it during the rest of the trip. Is it possible to store it somewhere relatively cheap for 10 days? preferably close to Narita Airport 



\*\* Going to be in Hokkaido, for a week from the 16th-22nd for a volleyball tournament, so this will be after that trip

  
**Day 1 - 23rd: 2 nights in Kanazawa**

\- Fly from New chitose \[9:40am\] to Narita Airport \[11:20am\]  
\- Go through customs etc (how long will this take? I think Ill be in T3 which should be domestic, does this mean the lines will be shorter?)  
\- Meet partner at 12pm for lunch, go to Ueno station for our shinkansen to Kanazawa (i'm thinking of booking reserved seats on the 3:30pm train, though maybe unreserved seats from Tokyo (the first stop) could be better since we would be the first ones on/lined up? at least thats how it is here in Australia...)  
\- Arrive at Hotel by 6:30pm, stroll around one of the many parks or districts   


**Day 2 - 24th:** 

\- 2nd day will be for all the typical activities (kurokuen, higashi etc. - open to suggestions on what to do here, most people just recommend the exact same 5 places and nothing else, will also just have a wonder around to find our own way but if there's anything that you have experiences that was unmissable let me know \^-\^)

  
**Day 3 - 25th: 1 night in Takayama**

\- Thinking of booking a seat for this one on a Nohi Bus early (within the next week) so we don't have any hiccups when it comes to getting to Takayama (again I don't know what kind of crowds to except but I've heard these areas are becoming more popular so don't wanna have to 'find out' when we get there...)  
\*I'm still deciding on if we should stop at Shirakawago but due to the slightly extra cost of the bus ticket and the time in between i think i'd prefer to go straight to takayama and relax  


**Day 4 - 26th: 2 nights in Magome (base)**

\- Go to one of the morning markets before grabbing our luggage and heading to Nakatsugawa.  
\*We will leave for takayama before noon, most likely going to take a Nohi bus route with some connecting trains to get there \[3.5 hr trip @ $35AUD\] (would it be best to book this or just show up and buy a ticket on the day?)   
\- I plan to arrive in Nakatsugawa by 2:30pm, giving us the afternoon to check out the area before taking the last bus to our accomodation in Magome at 6pm

  
**Day 5 - 27th:** 

\- We'll hike the magome-tsumugu or nagiso part of the nakasendo trail.  
\- I intend to really browse around each town as we have the whole day to just take it easy and breathe everything in.   
\*Still deciding on which direction to start from   
\-> Magome - tsumago - Nagiso ... train back to Magome, dinner and rest in accom  
\-> train into Nagiso - tsumago (I've heard some people have lunch/coffee here while they take a break which sounds nice) - Magome, close walk to accomodation, just have a quick dinner and rest straight away  


**Day 6 - 28th: 3 nights in Shimoda (base)**  
After having recovered and become one with nature we will make our way to Izu peninsula for a mini road trip.

\- We will start our treck at 8am to go to Atami as we have a car rental pick-up arranged for 1:30pm (IK I didnt realise the time I booked when making the reservation). We should arrive in Atami by 12:20pm  
\- Quite nervous for this though as I dont want to miss any trains or buses but I fear that we often get lost in train stations and take an extra 10minutes due to wandering around the wrong way..  
\- Once we have the car we might go see Mt Omuro before they close (3-5pm? is that doable idk I'll need to do more research, otherwise will swap it for Jogasaki Coast)  


**Day 7 - 29th:** 

\- Explore Jogasaki coast, kawazu falls, possibly dogashima if the weather is good but it will be '""reserved"" for the clearest day out of the three.   
\*Any suggestions on other areas will be appreciated! I dont mind taking it slow though and just sitting at the beach for hours. There are also many aquariums nearby that we can fill our time with depending on the weather.  


**Day 8 - 30th:**

\- Aaquarium for snorkeling with dolphins, and also to watch the sea animal shows. May look more along the east coast if we have time but mainly want to take it slow

  
**Day 9 - 31st:**

\- Eexplore the rest of the east side (heda, possibly shuzenji, all depends on timing, how tired we are and the weather)  
\- Wwe will drop our car off at 4pm and take the shinkansen to Narita where we stay for a night before departing fro narita airport in the morning



Any advice and suggestions are welcome pleease, I am itching not knowing what it will be like until we get there 🙈

*   **Electronics:** Just last month, I snagged a specific brand-name 27-inch 1440p monitor for **$249**, down from its usual $380-$400. That's a solid 35-40% off, and it wasn't a clearance item, just a well-timed flash sale I caught by monitoring price history for weeks.
*   **Home Goods:** A heavy-duty air fryer I'd been eyeing had hovered around $150 for months. I waited, set price alerts, and eventually got it for **$95** during a limited-time coupon stack. Nearly 37% off without compromising on the quality I wanted.
*   **Everyday Items:** Even smaller things add up. A bulk pack of my favorite coffee pods, typically $35, got it for **$25** through a specific online retailer's subscribe-and-save option coupled with a first-time user discount. Small, but consistent savings for something I buy regularly.

These aren't ""one-click and done"" finds. They often involve checking price history tools (like Keepa or CamelCamelCamel), setting price alerts, comparing multiple retailers, and sometimes even stacking coupons or rewards programs.

Now, let's be real: this takes effort. You're not going to find these kinds of deals every single day for everything on your wishlist. Stock can be limited, and shipping times aren't always Amazon Prime speed for some of the best finds. Regional availability is also a thing – what's hot in the US might not be available in Canada or Europe, and vice-versa. We try to specify when we share, but it's always good to double-check. There's no secret button. It's about patience and knowing what a *good* price actually looks like for a *good* product, not just believing whatever discount percentage a retailer throws at you.

About me: 

\- Not Texas born, but got here damn early in life

\- I don't talk politics except for understanding geopolitics

\- My background is in science, financials, building things, thinking keeps me busy

\- I love games of all types - Card, Board, Video, and would enjoy a trivia partner

\- I don't drink anymore... (unless you love tea or coffee) BUT I'm perfectly fine around you enjoying it or other things for that matter

\- I need someone that when we meet the first time you feel a ""spark"" because that's what I'm looking for too

\- I'm trying to be an open book here, happy to answer whatever, but would much rather do that over a date than 20 questions on reddit 👍

\- I'll be up front, I'm not a huge driver of small talk and I can enjoy silence around another person for long lengths of time, OF COURSE I want to get to know everything about you but... we're introverts right 🤷‍♂️

\- I'm athletic... but currently in dad bod mode, I'm getting back to mountain biking, gym, and I even like yoga. If you like climbing I'd love a partner to start back up. I'm 6' \~220 lbs. ( chub get back to muscles soon), blonde, blue eyed, hairy and tattoos

\- I actually like the outdoors a lot so if you're down for exploring trails, camping (like tent and roughing it, I'll bring telescope), getting out to do shit and just have been needing a partner... that's me

\- I'm kinda a ""chameleon"" so I do enjoy learning hobbies that my SO does, but don't want to smother you

\- Touch is my love language... if you're not one for constant attention then it ain't gonna work 

Now about you:

Age: 🤔 I'm flexible really because I believe women can be mature in many ways accelerated versus guys... 41/2+7 say I'm looking for someone 27 to 42

I don't know...😳 I'm looking for someone that read the above, finds herself intelligent, feels she's sexy and is financially stable (but understands I keep finances separate)

Kids... at my age I imagine you might have some, maybe. Want more? Kinda interested in what I might make with someone, but who the hell knows, maybe no kids and we go tour the world in a few years

\- someone that can communicate directly and honestly because really I don't get subtle hints at things... some part of my personality (maybe it's just guys to be truly honest 🤔) just doesn't get the little ""hints""

If you've gotten to this point you might realize I don't have a  ""type"" and haven't really dated in years (been working on myself... I have also been in a lot of isolated work, living alone... we're introverts 

\+ Gamer girl/lady who maybe likes Fallout, Civilization, and I like Nintendo games (Mario Party, kart, Metroid Samus momma😏)

\+ Don't be extremely political...on either side... I'm happy to talk about things, but it can't be one of the main focal points in my relationships

\+ Passion about something that impacts others/environment would be awesome; I'm not a hippie but understanding others and reduce-reuse-recycle-

Whether you're a seasoned woodworker or a beginner looking to explore this fulfilling craft, there are countless projects to consider. From handmade furniture to decorative items, woodworking allows you to create pieces that reflect your personal style and needs.

One of the most popular woodworking projects at home is building a custom coffee table. This project not only improves the aesthetics of your living room but also provides a functional surface for everyday use. Select a wood type that complements your existing décor, and get started with basic tools like a saw, drill, and sander.

Additionally, shelving units are practical woodworking projects at home that offer both utility and style. They can be tailored to fit any space—be it a corner, a wall, or a room divider—allowing you to display books, plants, and personal items. Adjustable shelving can also provide versatility, making it easier to adapt the unit as your needs evolve.

For those looking to edge into smaller projects, creating wooden picture frames is a great starting point. You can customize sizes and finishes to match your home, and they make wonderful gifts. Another exciting option is crafting organizers for your workspace, such as pencil holders or desktop trays, which can reduce clutter and increase efficiency.

Ultimately, woodworking projects at home are about innovation and personalization. Don’t shy away from experimenting with designs and styles. As you gain experience, you can tackle more complex projects, such as building a garden shed or even outdoor furniture. Embrace the process, enjoy the journey, and transform your living space one project at a time.",1,1771570831.0,GreenThumbHub,0,1.0,False

My A1C was over 16 when I got diagnosed. I recently got it checked again and it’s at 5.4. 

Go me! 

I’m really proud of myself for consistently going to the gym, eating less sugars and taking my medications. 

I had started out on an intense insulin regiment after diagnosis. Then switched, slowly, to metformin. I have been in the 5s for the last three bloodwork’s. 

I’ve made a lot of switches. My husband has been such a huge support! He switched over his eating habits so quickly and naturally it was so seamless and felt so supportive. 

I’ve had ups and downs with my parents over it. My grandmother(85f) has been such big help too. She learned how to convert sugar in her recipes to a sweetener so this Christmas was a lot better than the first one. She makes sure she is stocked with sweetener for coffee even though I rarely have coffee, but just in case I do, I don’t have to worry about sugar. 

My mother’s (56f) still has some issues that I don’t know if she will ever get over. Some deep seated ideas that sweeteners will give me cancer and thinks I should just have regular sugar because it’s better for me. Regardless of what I tell her. She at least makes sure that she no longer makes a sugar sauce for the veggies at family dinners and that there’s salads. So I’ll take improvements where I can. 

I just wanted to write some good things. Because I’ve been feeling down about other things in my life but this is something I am so happy about.

I've been going to the same dentist since I was in high school, as he is phenomenal.  I get cleanings every 3 months, and I'm due for another in a few weeks.

My dentist is a perfectionist, while his periodontist is much more laid back and has told me he's fine with putting off some grafts for a while.  It's so frustrating because I rarely eat candy or drink soda, let alone energy drinks or coffee.  I floss twice a day and brush three times a day.  For me, aside from the procedure and cost, the recovery time is the biggest thing.

I am very active, and certain activities I couldn't do for a month after each graft drove me crazy.  There's also the liquid diet.

I always buy light roasted specialty coffee and have typically favoured African single origins, because I’ve found them to be the brightest and most fruit-forward. I don’t regularly go beyond washed/honey/natural, brewing whatever tastes best out of V60, aeropress, and Hoop.

I have recently tried a number of Geshas, all Americas origin (Central and South), sucked in by both hype here and tonnes of promised \*floral\* flavour notes. 

I find that I’m always disappointed… they tend to taste a bit muted to me. Maybe there’s some florality there, but I don’t seem to pick up on it anywhere near as strongly as I do floral notes in African origin coffees. 

I have recently tried to troubleshoot by buying an African coffee and an Americas gesha from the same roaster, at the same roast level (light), dialled as best I can, same water, grinder, etc. etc. - and the same thing is still true. Bright fruit and florals on the African, fairly generic honey sweetness on the gesha. 

Am I brewing the geshas wrong? Do they need special treatment? Or am I learning that the usual profile of a gesha just doesn’t suit my taste very well?

*Cool wives just don’t look, they just don’t do that, y’know?*

I was on my way to grab my son from school. It was 3:20 in the afternoon, which had reared its bright and sunny head at my drowsy, nap-sodden eyes. I need a lot of sleep these days. It reminds me of my first few weeks postpartum, after I’d had my son all those years back: the swooning lallygag of motherhood creeping up behind my eyes, dulling them, weighing them, testing them. And then, in a blink, I’m on the couch with the baby curled into me, little breaths tittering on that full cupid’s bow while my own maw gapes open to relish in sleep, more sleep, always more.

*More?*

These days I am seven years postpartum. I have no real excuse for the extra sleep. I should know, I’ve had my thyroid checked twice. Guilt gnaws at me when I go upstairs to take my daily nap, away from the fray of my husband’s frantic typing and answering PNC calls: *Potential New Client.* But I do it, still. Little solace. Little death.

The fray of typing and daily life isn’t really what gets me. I could fall asleep listening to death metal, honestly. I could fall asleep on the floor of a Wal-Mart choked by Black Friday. I’m a deep sleeper, a good sleeper. It’s the *invisibility* I want to escape. And drinking at 2pm is a frowned-upon thing. Drinking is frowned upon in this house generally these days. I think he can feel why I do it. He can feel that I’m so unhappy. But, as he ranted at me previously, wives in this area, this *very nice* area, they do not do things like emotionally dump on their husbands after he’s had a long day of work. If they want to keep their lifestyle, that is.

Suddenly, I have a want for a set of midcentury furniture and a book of jell-o dinner recipes. Suddenly. So strange, is this. My brain is melting. Am I in Stepford? Is this a mental barbiturate, a false nirvana?

Well, anyway. On this particular day of my life, I trudge upstairs to my *nice* vibrator, dangle my legs off the edge of the mattress, huff myself into a tinny pleasure, and then curl into the fetal position to soak in a panel of sunshine like a fetid cat. I think of women when I cum. I will never be in a proper relationship with a woman — I am indeed what the kids might call a *heteroromantic* — but I don’t have nice memories of men, and so women become a perfect fantasy of unattainable, far-away, yet pleasant. Creatures of beauty, comfort, mothering, warmth, care. Softness. The things I try to be for my family. The things I want from others but cannot have. A state of ironic wantonness in perpetuity.

Has Sotheby’s tried to sell this thing? This concoction of woman? No. She is priceless. Hence all the paintings of women trying to capture her. God, it’s a vice.

I wake, groggy, to my phone alarm one hour, five minutes later, wipe at the mascara and brown eyeliner that smudged into a crust at the corners of my eyes, and yawn. If I am lucky, when I pad downstairs, my husband will say, *hey, baby!* And I will ask if he needs anything, like a good servant does.

Coffee?

*No, I’m alright, baby, thank you.*

Oh, the dishes need doing.

*What’s that, baby?*

I SAID, THE DISHES NEED — nevermind. How’s your YouTube channel doing?

*My latest video blew up! It’ll be a twenty-thousand-dollar month.*

Wow. I mean, truly, wow. How does he do it? All he does is bitch about Hillary Clinton. I guess that’s enough for a lot of people. I guess it is.

Alex Jones walked so my husband could run. Or something like that.

Properly napped and halfway out the back door, I say goodbye to my husband who is actually my ex-husband.

Yes, I’m sorry. This is confusing.

*Technically*. *Legally*. He is, in fact, my ex-husband. According to Uncle Sam, who’s the only uncle who matters. Especially since all mine are dead.

We will get to that, don’t you worry. But for now and for the rest of this writing, he will be referred to as my husband. That’s what we prefer, the theater of pretending a *Divorce Never Even Happened*. I wear my rings, dutifully, even if he “forgets” his. Which is often. I noticed he most often forgets when he does his little appearances for news channels, spots he pays for through a perfectly nice public relations woman. His eyes twinkle at the one news anchor he fancies best. For now. She has a strong jawline. In my steely heart of hearts, I grumble about how she looks very masculine, as if that should be a flaw.

If we are fighting, this particular anchor gets a nifty mention, or multiple, on my husband’s Instagram. At this point, I have been on-and-off blocked from my husband’s social media for the better part of a year — or was it two? — so I use a dummy account to check in on him, see where his indiscretions might lead him next. I will have to block him after checking on him otherwise he will find the dummy account through algorithmic suggestion and he’ll block that one too.

So far I have been successful with my most recent account. No blocks yet. I am proud of that, some kinda bitchin’ Nancy Drew. Hell yeah.

*I don’t need no college edumacation!*

For now, this news anchor has an ooey-gooey place in my husand’s tiny little ashen heart. Good for her, I suppose. She is special. I am not. Well, I used to be. The guy did marry me like, three months after meeting him. I was hot shit back in that day.

Unlike the news anchor, I am used to my ever-degraded position in his life. Unlike me, she can afford to simply not care. That’s why he likes her, I think. She doesn’t have to care. I do.

My husband is cheerful about his goodbye. He is feeling good today, probably because I had accepted his most recent bid to repair our relationship after he’d snapped about something. I am always fucking things up. I’ll tell you the rules of this theater marriage soon but just know that the *cardinal* rule is that I Am Always At Fault.

I walk out to the older model Tesla, the one I’d been relegated to despite the fact that the Model S Plaid had been declared “my” car just two years ago, as justification for its purchase. Because what person would tell a man to *not* buy his lovely wife a $100,000 car? No one, that’s who. Funny how that works. The nicer, sportier car goes to the man of the house always eventually. I said I didn’t mind all that much and I guess I don’t. Not really, anyway. I am a cool wife, a cool girl; low-maintenance sure is hot these days, isn’t it? All these red pills make it hard to see a girl anyhow, for what she’s really worth.

Anyway, my peripheral catches something interesting on the front porch as I fling my hand out, ready for the door on the X to open automatically *a la* concierge style. Hard to complain, either way, no? There, a small pink and white paper bag. My heart flutters: *Is it for me? Did my husband get me a surprise?*

I hurry to it, eyes wide to drink in the sight. My husband had been infuriated with me over the last week about various things and trying to make up for it with some physical affection, a process which was volatile as much as it was unpredictable. One day he came up behind me in the kitchen and kissed my neck, swayed with me, tried to joke around, while his thirteen year-old daughter became a proper holy witness to his desire to save us. He’d asked what I’d done that day. I’d said I’d cried a lot and bought myself flowers. I put my fingers on their petals, noting that my voice was flat; I’d have to change my tone or my husband would feel challenged.

He’d said “*aww*” in the way you might say while looking at an elderly woman trying to cross the street, and struggling. Hollow. Falsely altruistic.

My throat swelled up at the feeling of his closeness. It is so alien to me these days. I don’t want to trust his touch anymore. And, in that moment, it didn’t feel like he was touching me to repair us, it felt like he was touching me to prove to himself that he wasn’t a monster.

So, I pick up this little pink bag, giddy at the idea that my husband might have given me something, *anything*, to soften the blow of his many lashings.

The bag is filled with a dozen cookies, delivered by DoorDash. I cock my head, confused. I don’t eat junk food. I mean, I do, but my version of junk food is salmon nigiri, a good cabernet, and a movie. I don’t particularly enjoy cookies so much so that I would require a dozen.

On the front, a pert note, typed out for my husband, per the orderer’s instructions:

*“Congrats on the new firm, jerkface!”*

I looked at the sender’s name:

Lily.

It's been 60 days since I quit caffeine; haven't had a single drop of it since, even though I've been tempted to multiple times.

My waking cycle is currently an absolute mess. 

I'm really unsure of what to do, because mt husband thinks I should go back to caffeine - and I really don't, since I have better mental health without caffeine. He also says he's ""suffering"" because we have 1 less thing to bond over and he enjoyed getting coffee and making coffee with me... and I do feel bad for him on this point.

I’ve been plagued by chronic headaches for the past 2 years. I have had occasional headaches in the past but the ones in the past 2 years have been worse and almost daily (Unless my body spares me some days). Pain relievers like Ibuprofen don’t seem to help.



Me and the doctors I have seen have not traced it down an origin.

I did a CT scan— nothing there.

I checked my thyroid— nothing there.

I went to an Optometrist— nothing related to my eyes.

I even go to a Neurologist who recommended me the CT scan and Optometrist, but we haven’t figured out if the headaches are actually to anything neurological.



The only thing that had a slight correlation was my nose. I had a deviated septum and I ended up getting a septoplasty done back in October of 2025. It didn’t stop them necessarily, but I did temporarily give me a break before picking back up again. The only major helping the septoplasty gave me was that the headaches became more dull. (Previously, I described the headaches as extremely intense without necessarily being sharp and were very similar to tension headaches.)



As of right now, it’s a dull pain not pinpointed in an exact location just… in my head. My head feels like a rock, the headaches make me tired and sometimes dizzy. There’s no exact “trigger” for them as far as I know; they simply just… happen for me and sleep neither helps or sometimes I wake up with one even if I didn’t go to bed with one. Periods also do not affect my headaches.



Some additional, not sure if related information:

\- I do not drink coffee or consume caffeinated beverages on the regular. If I do consume caffeine, it’s rare or in foods like tiramisu. As far as I’m aware, it doesn’t affect my headache (or I hardly can tell due to the fact I rarely have caffeine) In fact, I hardly consume any drink that isn’t water.

\- I might be vitamin deficient. I have autism and in turn, ARFID. A lot of foods I can typically substitute for others in vitamins but the major food I avoid is meat. (I am not vegetarian or vegan, I simply dislike meat’s texture) I try to take capsules because of this but I tend to forget

\- I don’t really leave the house. Yea, I know. But every time I leave the house, I catch every run-of-the-mill virus know to man so I’ve opted to stay home. I’m not sure why even as I am not immunocompromised as far as I’m aware.

\- I have some problems with sleeping. Usually it’s because I’m not tired enough to go to bed or it’s too hot (I hate being hot). But either way, sleep is my enemy and I end up going to bed at odd hours. If I try to go to bed when I’m not tired, I end up waking up after 4 hours and can’t go back to bed.

I’m getting desperate honestly. Do I go get my hormones (not related to my thyroid) checked out? Do I just change my diet again and pray (I had to change it in June 2025 due to constipation and now consume more fiber)? Do I have some condition that I wasn’t aware of? I have a family history of migraines but I even tried the pills that my mom took for hers and they didn’t help. Is it that I keep getting sick and it triggers my headaches? My mom suspects it’s related to my hormones as I’m not as tall as I should be but I honestly do not know.

I don’t expect anyone to tell me exactly what it is. I just wanna know who I should see or what I should do…",1,1771569441.0,AskDocs,1,0.99,False

Chapter 1 

When the apocalypse hit, I became the team’s only lucky charm. 

As long as I just stood there looking pretty in my designer dress, the Infected kept their distance as if 

repelled by an invisible force field. 

Captain Luther Wilder and the team practically coddled me, terrified I’d break a nail. 

That changed when the team rescued a hard-nosed instructor, Rhonda Steele. 

The moment she arrived, Rhonda hated that I got the best rations and the softest bed. She wouldn’t shut up 

about “pulling your own weight” and how “nobody eats for free”. 

When the zombie horde attacked and everyone was scrambling to throw up defenses, I stood off to the side 

sipping a caramel macchiato to calm my nerves. 

Rhonda charged over, knocked the cup out of my hand, and dragged me by my hair toward the horde. 

“Everyone’s out there dying, and you think you’re special? You have a Gift? Then make yourself useful!” 

I landed in muddy water, sobbing. “Rhonda, I can’t, it hurts, and my Gift wasn’t for combat…” 

She kicked me out of the safe zone. “Save it! You’re nothing but a pathetic waste of space.” 

Before I could react, a heavy combat boot slammed into my lower back, sending me flying. 

With a strangled cry, I crashed into a mud puddle outside Fort Vanguard. My lace cocktail dress was soaked through, and my knees scraped against the gravel. 

I tried to reach for what was left of my caramel macchiato, but a combat boot came down hard on it. Crack. 

The cup exploded, splashing coffee across my face. 

“Seriously? Coffee? You’re pathetic!” Rhonda, in her camo vest, grabbed my hair and wrenched my head back. “See that? That’s the real world, not your little princess fantasy!” 

Rhonda forced my head up. The zombie horde was right there, writhing about five hundred meters out. 

Luther used to say God left me behind to keep everyone else safe. He called my Gift “Sanctuary.” It worked as long as I stayed happy and clean, a perfect circle of safety, nothing could breach it. 

Now I was filthy, my dress in tatters. The Infected caught my scent. Every one of them turned, milky eyes 

locking on to me.

Growls rose all around us, rising and falling in waves. I couldn’t stop shaking. 

“Rhonda, please! It doesn’t work if I’m-” 

“Luther would…” 

“Don’t even think about running to the captain!” Rhonda hauled me to my feet and shoved me toward the 

horde. 

“Still keeping up the act? ‘Can’t get dirty’?” Her mouth twisted. “You’re just a spoiled little coward! You’re 

getting blood on your hands today. Now get out there and kill one.” 

I stumbled through the wire gate and went down hard. 

When I looked up, the nearest walker was less than fifty meters away. A walker in a business suit, half its 

skull missing, its neck twisted at an angle. It clicked deep in its throat. 

It shuffled closer. I squeezed my eyes shut and curled into myself, arms wrapped around my head. 

One second. Two. 

Nothing happened. The agony I expected never came, instead, everything went quiet. 

I opened my eyes, shaking. The suited walker had frozen ten meters away, like it had hit an invisible wall. 

My dress was filthy, but some trace of “Sanctuary” still clung to me. Just enough to hold them back. 

“Ha! You see that? These things are pathetic!” 

Rhonda strode over and yanked me up by my collar, dragging me back inside. “I knew it! You were faking the whole time! That walker was harmless and you acted like you were gonna die!” ",1,1771569394.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

A year ago in my classroom at high school, I’ve had an girl that I’ve quite liked.. everyday she came around me and complimented my perfume, my height or even asking me random stuff.. I was quite shy to ask her, not knowing if she does this out of pure interest or just being nice.

A few weeks later I had the small bit of courage wanting to shoot my shot and when our roads intersected, while leaving high school she was with her group of girls.. at the bus stop I dragged her a bit away from the other girls wanting to talk with her and ask her out on a coffee but then one of her girls said “I want to listen too” and I had to ask faster not wanting for one of her friends to listen even tho I’ve taken the girl aside for privacy.. when I asked her out for coffee, her expression remained neutral and just.. “ugh.. sorry idk, I’ll tell you” and then left. That day I felt overwhelmed.. questioning everything..

Next morning I didn’t knew this would be an big change for me.. I walked in classroom only to be laughed and mocked by everyone for asking her out and for a few good months till present there have been some jokes and mockery here and there but at some point it stopped, thing is that I felt hurt and confused when every single one from my class laughed and mocked.. including people I considered close.

I just wanted to express this off my heart, maybe somewhere I did something wrong.. and maybe just maybe I feel like I shouldn’t have asked her out, now I changed and didn’t let them joke about that and close the jokes instantly by another joke or an mockery towards that person same way they did.

Everyday I carry it like an burden, whenever I see her I feel numbness, she tried to get in contact by small talk but always either acted like I didn’t heard or simple talked vaguely.",1,1771569261.0,whatdoIdo,4,1.0,False

It is nice to support each other and possibly to build good friendship too!

I’m 29/F Asian. Send me a dm with little introduction if you also interested!

Update: “Admin Night” is basically a small group of people spending time together in coffee shop or any chill places to finish up some online chores, like booking appointment, checking email, scheduling event, or anything that you have procrastinated to finish. It’s nice to have a support group and motivates each other :)

For context:

* I’m not overweight.
* I drink coffee daily.
* No known heart issues. Normal ECG
* I take a multivitamin and omega 3 (fish oil) supplement daily.
* I don't get tired easily.

My RHR usually sits around 80 bpm.

I’m looking for evidence-based ways to lower it long term. Has anyone had any success with this?",6,1771569174.0,Biohackers,22,1.0,False
