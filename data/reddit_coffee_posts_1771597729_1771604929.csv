How do I fix this?","I met my now fiance almost 5 years ago and it's been a perfect relationship, he's lovely, kind, hard working and everything I've ever wanted in a person. However, there's a slight problem. I'm pretty sure his sister hates me. When we first started dating she was nice to me, friendly etc and we also doubled dated with her and her ex occasionally, spending nye together, I would go shopping with her one and one, and seemed quite close for at least a year and a half. She broke up with her then bf and shortly after started seeing her now bf. One nye she told me she started seeing someone again and showed me his picture etc and I said oh I know him from a dating app, I spoke to him for a few days, never met up, he was local to me at the time, he wasn't my type etc and I ghosted him. We discussed that he said he was in the police, and said the same chat up line to us both 2 years apart, I found it funny and that was it. I think the last time she hung out with me one on one was shopping for me and my partners first home. 

Just for some context I'm a very sarcastic person, dry humour and say what I'm thinking, I don't think she minded this at first and found me funny, would message me and interact with me, like a friendship. Also gave compliments that's she wishes she was like me and likes that I'm myself and different etc.

She started to be more serious about the cop bf and family were worried just from tails surrounding cops, I also expressed slight disatifaction and me and my partner said a few jokes but nothing serious. I want to reiterate that it wasn't just us, this was her whole family at the time.

Time goes on and myself and my partner get better jobs, move into a house and start winning at life a little bit.

We go to a family meal her bf included and after she messages her dad asking if me and my partner were saying things about her bf behind their backs, he messaged her mum and she spoke to us. We didn't and we're very confused to why she's think that, made us uncomfortable

I see her in person at a families house and she's discussing a car she's thinking about buying and I said something a long the lines of it's ugly, not meaning to be rude I just didn't like the car and again, just being the same jokey person I always am(having an odd taste in cars, preferring older cars) I didn't think anything of this but again noticed more distancing months later I pick up on a vibe from her and ask my partner to ask her if she even likes me, when asked she says ""yes what's not to like, pauses and says but one time she said about a car I liked being ugly and that I can be quite abrasive with my words sometimes""... I immediately message her apologizing and ask if she would like to go for coffee etc, she brushes it off, ignores the invite time goes on we don't speak about it again.

  
She posts new trainers on Instagram and I recommend some to her plus a shop that fits running shoes, she replies really abruptly and I feel hurt by this and silly that I even messaged her in the first place.

Over the timeline  I invite her to coffee, to meet my friends (she only sees her bf and no one else), shopping etc several times over text but she ignores these messages and leaves them on seen Everytime, occasionally replying back to other stuff but ignoring the invites... Me and my partner get engaged and she messages a congrats... We invited her to our engagement party with friends, she doesn't come.....

  
Her and her cop bf are looking at houses to buy and for some reason it becomes top secret like me and my partner aren't allowed to know anything or shut down when talking about mortgages etc and just trying to give advice on the process as we just did it a year ago. It's at this point I decide she really just doesn't like me anymore and I don't know why...

Just to note here, I've mentioned this to her mum and other family as Im upset and hate feeling like I've upset someone and they tell me to ""ignore her and that she's like this and can be really rude, and say she doesn't have friends for a reason"" saying to not get involved or advise her on anything as she wouldn't do the same for me. I'm taken back by the comments but one time (year prior) out for coffee with her and her mum she pops to the shop next door and her mum says ""she's so far up her own arse, when will she become more genuine"" again this also takes me by surprise as my family would never say something about me to someone else. My partner also feels like she doesn't like him either and never really has. Her mum tells him that recently she's said that ""we are know it all's"" and ""all we talked about was moving into our house and now all we're going to talk about is our wedding"" (two things she should be happy about for us and anyone would want to talk about as it's big life events right?). She also said ""she keeps her bf away from us"" even though we like him and feel we would get on well with him. I'm confused to why her mum would relay this info that's she's talking behind our backs and I decided to distance myself for two months now, delete my socials and just hide away from them all as I feel so uncomfortable about all of this.

I'm quite sad about the whole thing, she told me secrets and felt like we were friends. Is this because I spoke to her bf years ago before I even knew my bf and her? Why is her mum telling us she bitches behind our backs? What's the narrative here?

Other things to note is through this timeline, we got together very poor, moved into a van, he eventually found a job and is doing quite well, he has part own in a business etc on the side of his job and I found better paying work, we bought or house and got engaged. I'm mentioning this because he always says she hates doing the same thing as him and always has and she also mentioned at she hates that he's in the same line of work as her now....

Is this all my fault? And I over reacting? 

Since all this I've been a lot quieter and uncomfortable to speak and I don't bother talking to her in person unless she addresses me. Throughout this saga she's bought Christmas presents for me, but I feel this is cos she feels she has to as her family would get mad if she didn't, she's also been nice to me in front of her family, but I just feel she doesn't like me at all and I don't want to have a friendship with someone who bitches about me behind my back...

I've been taking Iron (III) Oxide supplements for 3 months and I have had a rapid increase of appetite and I gained almost 4-5kg, which is insane honestly, I was initially 58kg and now I'm 63kg. According to my BMI, I'm reaching to the overweight status, Im 162cm.

My iron levels used to be 3.7 (umol/L), now its 12.8 (umol/L) after 3 months of consistent use with vitamin c for better absorption, the dark dry patches are also completely gone.

I wouldn't say it has made me super insecure or anything because the weight gain hasn't been that obvious on my appearance, it's more of just on the scale and that my butt and hips are bigger. But, it's the insane increase in appetite that's been bothering me, I just can't stop thinking of eating food! I've never been like this, I've never had an appetite since I was a kid and I never snack on anything, I don't eat timely and the portions I eat usually are very small. But now, all I think about is food and munching or drinking on something and it's honestly so annoying, the portions I have to eat in order to be full are also significantly larger than how it used to be.

Initially, I had thought maybe the supplements has increased my metabolism & energy which is why I'm constantly hungry but it still doesn't make sense I get hungry every hour almost, but I don't eat more than 1,700 calories a day, that's for sure. But my daily steps aren't that high either, sometimes its 5-10k, sometimes its 600, especially on the days I just sit at home and do work.

I just need to know whether it's the iron that's been causing my increase in appetite, I've been thinking of taking appetite suppression pills and drinking more coffee, because I really find it so frustrating to constantly think about food, I don't have the time to go for runs and walks daily as well so I depend highly on eating lesser to maintain my weight.",1,1771604287.0,Anemic,0,1.0,False
1r9zpj5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazingCoolFinds/comments/1r9zpj5/problem_solved_this_noisecanceling_headset/,Problem solved: This noise-canceling headset finally blocks out distractions (eliminated the problem) 🎧,"I wasn't looking for new noise-canceling headphones, but the constant hum of my open-plan office and a particularly chatty neighbor forced my hand. The Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones, at $429, promised a sanctuary, and they absolutely delivered, solving my distraction problem completely.

Positioned firmly among flagship noise-canceling headphones, these aren't just an upgrade; they're a reset for focused work and peaceful travel.

The core of the QuietComfort Ultra's efficacy lies in its custom-designed acoustic architecture, leveraging sophisticated digital signal processing and an advanced chip. This isn't just about blocking sound; it's about precisely targeting frequencies and creating a genuine bubble of calm. The difference showed up when I could actually hear my own thoughts, even with colleagues chatting nearby.

What sets these apart, even from strong contenders like the Sony WH-1000XM5, is their unique Immersive Audio mode. This feature takes spatial audio a step further, positioning sound outside your head for a more natural, lifelike listening experience that truly pulls you into your content. *Bose has clearly focused on creating an engaging, private soundstage*.

During three weeks of rigorous testing across various environments—a bustling open-plan office, a rattling morning train commute, and even a lively coffee shop—the Ultra consistently delivered. I particularly appreciated the unexpected utility in focusing on intricate work details, unhindered by ambient noise. They genuinely elevate concentration.

Here are the elements that sealed the deal:

*   **Unrivaled Acoustic Noise Cancellation**: With a simple tap, the world outside fades, letting critical conference calls and focused tasks take center stage. I found it to be perceptibly stronger than my previous Sennheiser PXC 550-II headphones.

*   **Immersive Audio Technology**: This isn't merely a gimmick; it creates an expansive soundstage, making music feel live and podcasts feel like the speaker is in the room with you. It’s an auditory experience that minimizes listening fatigue.

*   **Exceptional Comfort and Fit**: Weighing in at just **253 grams**, these headphones remain comfortable for hours, thanks to plush earcup cushions and a well-balanced headband pressure. This meant uninterrupted focus during long coding sessions.

*   **Up to 24-Hour Battery Life**: Reliability is key when you depend on your headphones daily, and a full charge easily got me through multiple workdays without needing to top up. Even with Immersive Audio enabled, I still saw impressive longevity.

*   **Customizable EQ and Modes**: Through the Bose Music app, I fine-tuned the audio profile to my preference and created custom noise-canceling modes for different scenarios, like ""Focus"" for deep work and ""Aware"" for quick interactions. The app interface is intuitive and responsive.

The **Bluetooth 5.3** connectivity was also rock solid, maintaining a stable connection across my devices without a hitch. This seamless pairing contributed significantly to the overall distraction-free workflow.

At $429, the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones represent a significant investment, but for those seeking unparalleled peace in chaotic environments, it's a justified expense. Be aware they are still over-ear headphones, so they might feel a bit bulky for ultra-minimalist commuters. Independent testing verified the claimed noise cancellation performs as advertised, often exceeding expectations.

These are explicitly not for budget-focused buyers or occasional users who only need basic audio. If pristine audio fidelity isn't your top priority, and absolute silence isn't a daily necessity, there are more affordable options available that still perform well for general listening.

Sorry but this may feel like a rant, but im just more than frustrated.

Yes i know my palate and my taste buds, i have tasted fruity espressos in different coffee shops and notes were so obvious, where cherries were written in coffee shops beans i tasted cherries effortlessly.
Where fruits were written it was so obvious.

So lately, after i got my df83v with ssp mp burrs with Profitec GO, I thought finally i would get these tastes in home.
MORE THAN 200 ESPREESO, i swear there is no variable i could change i didn't change,  water temps from 85c until 98c, water source(reverse osmosis and bottled). Grind settings , ratios from 1:1 to 1:3. Rpm of grinder, extraction time from 15 sec to 60 sec.


All variables were done while keeping everything constant and changing one at a time.

The only thing that didn't change was the double basket , double spout porta filter, and the constant pressure 30 lbs tamper.

The best taste i was able to get is non acidic non bitter , bland coffee. 0 notes .

Like imaging buying a coffe with a blank empty  description of taste notes, THAT WAS MINE.

Varaietes of coffee i tried in home Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, guji,ababa,  brazil cerrado, yellow bourboun, guatemalan, there was washed and natural. Some light roasts some medium roasts.

Should i invest in only speciality coffee beans that costs 100$ per kilo at least?

I used the ZP6 at 4. I used a clear glass to see the flow speed from the bottom. At the 4 minute mark it went from a nice steady flow to a slow drip with more water to pass through the grounds, maybe 30-40 ml- I didn't measure it just eyeballed it. So I took it off and put it onto another cup to drain the rest of the brew. 

What a difference in the two cups. It took another 45 seconds to drain the rest of the brew in the 2nd mug. It was bitter and astringent. But the original cup was really good, clean, bright, acidic, balanced just how I enjoy me coffee's. 

So from now on I will only use a clear glass cup with my Ceado brewer and once it slows to a dripping I will remove the brewer and toss out the remaining coffee. 

So if you are not getting the cup you like from the brewer give this method a try. It will not disappoint. 

This was my 3rd cup of the same coffee this morning. The other 2 were brewed with a v60 using Hoffmans recipe and Tetsu 4:6. This brew was right up there with the others on the v60. ",3,1771604165.0,pourover,2,0.8,False

Nothing came out of it. I gave fresh water and saw that they still had kibble before bed to nibble on and went to sleep. 

This morning I get up to change water and refill food dishes. The dry kibble was not really ate much from the bowls which is unusual. The younger cat wasn't begging for wet food but I made his dish up and set it down. Typically he has it gone within a few minutes. I washed my hands made some coffee the normal routine but noticed that he wasn't eating the solid parts just licking the gravy and licking at the chunks. Maybe a nibble here or there. I did the daily litter scoop and saw some mushy 💩 and noticed his bum seemed wetter but maybe he was bathing recently. I was leaving for work but he still hadn't ate the solid foods so I gave him a lick able soup treat before I left so he got something in him. 

I did call the vet and they said I could monitor him and set up a sick appointment for next week Thursday. Also said if he gets worse to call them back they might be able to get him in sooner if it is urgent/emergency.

This leads many people to engage in the typical ""panic applying,"" which is applying to everything they see. There's even a lot of software on the market specifically designed for this purpose.  
  
But I'm sorry to tell you that this technique is like playing roulette. You might just happen upon the person who finds your CV and calls you. Sending the same CV constantly to countless companies simply doesn't work. 

That's why I'm going to share what HR professionals look for and what I would do if I were looking for a job and I sincerely hope it helps someone.  
  
**Day 1**: Choose a specific role you want to apply for: The ""open to everything"" approach doesn't work. Recruiters are looking for someone who fits the specific role they're seeking, not someone with generic skills who can then adapt to the company. That's why on the first day I would focus on saving 15-20 similar jobs, with similar technology and responsibilities, and I would study their keywords and any recurring words or functions. You'll notice that many seem like a copy-paste job (and often they are).  
  
**Days 2-3**: - Creating the CV: Once I have the selected keywords and the recurring role characteristics, I would start creating a CV tailored to this role (there are many tools I won't mention, but many of them are free). I would focus on:  
  
\- The skills (hard and soft skills) that are in demand and most common for that position  
\- The technologies most used in these roles (you can include any you know)  
  
Why focus so much on keywords? Well, the world in general runs on keywords. If a store wants to appear first in the search results for ""coffee shop in New York,"" your goal should be the same.  
  
**Days 4-6**: I would send a maximum of 5 applications per day. After sending each application, I would go to LinkedIn (which, again, should also be optimized) and look for the recruiter who posted the job on LinkedIn, or for employees of the same company to connect with them and interact once I've sent my CV.  
  
**\*Tip**: Many companies pay their employees for referring people, so it's always good to have someone on the inside promoting your CV.  
  
**Day 7**: I would follow up on each of the positions I applied for from day 4 onwards. This is something many candidates fail at, and I understand; I'm a disaster at it sometimes too.  
  
But you have to look at it more from a sales perspective, and there are times when you have to follow up with the recruiter to get a response. You'd be surprised how many candidates get the job simply by sending the right message at the right time.  
  
I know this is an exaggeration and that these processes usually take longer, but I hope the message is clear.  
  
I hope this helps you as much as it helped me back then.",2,1771603752.0,jobsearchhacks,1,1.0,False

1r9zevw,https://i.redd.it/9le8kk9e8okg1.png,"How I Failed to Raise $5,000 for My Short Film on Indiegogo","Hi.

I’m writing this in case someone here is thinking about crowdfunding their film.

In January I launched an Indiegogo campaign for my short film. I needed $5,000. Not a huge amount. My cinematographer, production designer and I were already covering part of the budget ourselves. I just wanted to finish the film without constantly stressing about every small expense.

The campaign has been running for almost two months.

So far we’ve raised **$1,369**.

There’s one week left. I still hope for a miracle.

But realistically, things are not looking great.

# Weekly updates and small wins

I knew crowdfunding doesn’t magically bring money. You have to push it. So I promoted it through Instagram and YouTube.

I had almost no crowdfunding experience. I created the campaign and launched it immediately.

On day one I received $500.

I thought: *Great start. This is working.*

That feeling didn’t last long.

About once a week I posted updates. There was always something happening:

* Searching for a car for night scenes
* Negotiating prop weapons
* Companies agreeing to support us with equipment

The project was alive. I honestly believed momentum would grow.

Instead, something else grew.

# The scammers

Very quickly I started receiving around 10 emails per day from “helpers.”

All of them promised to help raise funds.

None of them could clearly explain how.

Some offered “email blasts to active backers.”

Active backers of what exactly?

Some offered paid Meta ads.

But here’s what people don’t always understand:

>Cold traffic doesn’t fund films easily.  
People don’t randomly give money to strangers.

Then it got weirder.

I started receiving small contributions from random people who immediately emailed me saying they wanted to “connect.” When I replied, they offered paid promotion services. When I refused to spend campaign money on ads, they cancelled their contribution and claimed it was a mistake.

At first this was frustrating.

Later I accepted it as part of the ecosystem.

Crowdfunding platforms attract creators.  
They also attract predators.

# Something I noticed from others

I observed other campaigns closely. I even connected with Uwe Boll, who did something smart.

He created his campaign page but didn’t start collecting money immediately. For the first month he only gathered followers. Built anticipation. Built a base.

Launching with a loyal audience makes a huge difference.

I didn’t do that.

I launched first. Built audience later.

That was a mistake.

# The “smart” idea that didn’t work

I had another idea.

* Find people who previously funded films
* Search those films on IMDb
* Find those backers on Instagram
* Reach out and tell them about my project

Sounds logical.

Didn’t work.

At least not for me.

But I still think the idea itself is solid. You’re reaching out to people who already proved they’re willing to support independent films. In theory, that makes sense.

Maybe I didn’t approach it the right way.  
Maybe my project didn’t resonate with them.  
Maybe the timing was wrong.

Just because it failed in my case doesn’t mean it won’t work in yours.

People who funded one project don’t automatically fund yours.

But they might — if the story hits them at the right moment.

# The reality

In the end, about **98%** of the people who funded my campaign were people I personally knew.

Friends. Contacts. People who already trusted me.

That taught me something important:

>Crowdfunding is not magic discovery.  
It is trust monetization.

If your network doesn’t have the financial capacity, it becomes extremely hard.

The hardest part wasn’t losing potential money.

It was realizing I overestimated how ready my audience was to financially support my work.

That’s very different from liking a post.

# The math in my head

At some point I did the math.

I have around **14,000 followers** on Instagram.

Most of them probably buy a coffee every day.

I told myself:

>If every 30th person shares just one $10 coffee with this film,  
we hit $5,000.

That’s 500 people.  
Out of 14,000.  
Just 3.5%.

On paper, it felt completely realistic.

In reality, it isn’t that simple.

Following is not the same as backing.  
Liking a post is not the same as financially supporting a project.  
Audience size is not the same as community depth.

The math made sense.

Human behavior didn’t.

# The painful part

Indiegogo currently does not allow partial funding in my case.

If you don’t hit 100%, you get nothing.

We later secured a car and prop weapons from other sources. I contacted support and asked if I could lower the goal.

They refused.

Rules are rules.

So now I believe something uncomfortable:

If I had set a much smaller goal, we probably would have succeeded.

Psychologically, people support success.  
Large goals feel risky.  
Small goals feel achievable.

Being fully transparent about your real needs can be expensive.

# What I learned

1. Build an audience before launching
2. Expect scammers
3. Most funding will come from people who already trust you
4. A smaller goal increases psychological momentum
5. Crowdfunding is more about community than about platforms

Crowdfunding didn’t finance my film.

But it forced me to understand what kind of support I actually have.

And that lesson might be worth more than the platform itself.

If you’re considering crowdfunding your film, feel free to ask questions.

I’m still in the last week of this campaign. Maybe something unexpected happens.

But even if it doesn’t, I already learned more than I expected.",0,1771603649.0,Filmmakers,3,0.25,False

Here's a guide to some of the recent chapters...

# Homeward Bound

[https://www.evil-inc.com/comic/butt-beseeching/](https://www.evil-inc.com/comic/butt-beseeching/).

Evil Inc's favorite devilgirl Desdemona gets word from the Neither Realm indicating that her time on planet Earth is at its end, and she must return to the Dark Dimension. But there's a loophole. If she perpetrates a large-scale act of evil, she can extend her stay. Somehow, this involves her opening an account on an OnlyFan-style website.

Meanwhile, Captain Heroic and Miss Match try to piece together their relationship — without Cap's father, Commander Heroic, getting in the way. 

Spoiler Alert: He gets in the way.

# Long-Lost Fiends

[https://www.evil-inc.com/comic/face-it-tiger-you-hit-the-jackpot/](https://www.evil-inc.com/comic/face-it-tiger-you-hit-the-jackpot/)

Cassie Cruz's superhero temp agency has grown into a successful business. In fact, it's so successful that Evil Inc sends Thea Rhutman to **buy** it — and expand its workforce to include **villains**! This goes against everything Cassie has worked for, but Thea has an ace up her sleeve — a secret that threatens to shake Fairmount City to its foundations.

Meanwhile, Lightning Lady is visited by an old flame from her days as a hench — a beefy minotaur who wants to rekindle their relationship! Will she take the bull by the horns?

# Multiple Choice

[https://evil-inc.com/comic/bring-out-animal-in-him/](https://evil-inc.com/comic/bring-out-animal-in-him/)

With her star-crossed romance with Captain Heroic on the rocks, Miss Match requests an out-of-town assignment from Evil Inc. She agrees to teach a series of supervillain seminars in Akron, Ohio. What will she do when the sparks fly between her and a stone-cold arch-fiend, Death Chill?

Meanwhile, devilgirl Desi is being called back to the Dark Dimension — for good. Her only hope for staying is to find a lifemate on Earth. Can she choose between her carnal attraction to the buff demon, Surgat, and her fiends-with-benefits relationship with Iron Dragon?

# Leap of Faith

[https://www.evil-inc.com/comic/look-up-in-the-sky-2/](https://www.evil-inc.com/comic/look-up-in-the-sky-2/)

After a tussle with Mister Howell, Wingman falls under the Werewolf's Curse. The enthralled hero is tasked with spreading that curse to his fellow supers. But his allies have paired off behind locked doors. Will they come out long enough to let Wingman put the bite on them?

Meanwhile, in a flashback to the 1970s, a mysterious princess from another world arrives in Fairmount City carrying a jaw-dropping secret. Can the valiant Mood Ring discover her true identity before his fellow heroes exile her?

# Choose or Lose

[https://www.evil-inc.com/comic/meanwhile-in-ralphs-diner/](https://www.evil-inc.com/comic/meanwhile-in-ralphs-diner/)

When Miss Match is taken hostage, Captain Heroic rushes to her rescue—only to face off against the ruthless manager of Evil Inc, who has absorbed the powers of an army of heroes and villains! Among them is Mister Howell, a formidable werewolf and Miss Match’s lover, who suddenly finds himself trapped in a dimension where his wildest fantasy becomes reality. Can Captain Heroic save the day, or will this battle reshape their fates forever? Find out in this thrilling chapter of *Evil Inc*!

# Boss Battle

[https://www.evil-inc.com/comic/graphic-violence/](https://www.evil-inc.com/comic/graphic-violence/)

Big changes are rocking the Fairmount branch of Evil Inc! The arrival of a new manager, a literal tentacled terror named Krakenos, isn’t exactly boosting morale. Especially when his “management style” involves sinister secrets and interdimensional consequences.

Iron Dragon finds himself in hot water when he accidentally zaps Krakenos into another dimension — while trying to resist the seductive advances of Tempest, Krakenos’ dangerously alluring assistant.

With the entire branch fired by Evil Inc's CEO, Dr. Whoosh, the team launches a last-ditch plan so devious — so diabolical — it just might save their jobs.

Meanwhile, across town, with Fairmount City's A-list heroes off on an intergalactic mission, Cassie Cruz scrambles to protect the city using the only resources left: one aging superhero and a handful of C-list villains. What could possibly go wrong?

Supervillains, sabotage, and scandalous hijinks abound in this jam-packed issue of *Evil Inc* — where the only thing more outrageous than the plot twists are the office romances.

# Double Crossed

[https://www.evil-inc.com/comic/chapter-16-page-1a-evil-mime/](https://www.evil-inc.com/comic/chapter-16-page-1a-evil-mime/)

Fairmount City’s supervillains have a problem — their evil plans keep getting busted before they even start. When Captain Heroic foils a mime-themed menace called the Anti-Voxxer, the villains of Evil Inc start connecting the dots: ever since Cassie Cruz took over as branch manager, their “perfect” crimes have been meeting mysteriously prepared heroes.

Convinced their new boss is a mole for the good guys, the staff turns on Cassie — and their assassination attempts are getting more creative by the day (starting with a possessed cup of coffee). Desperate to clear her name, Cassie launches a sting operation, planting false intel in each villain’s file to flush out the real spy.

Meanwhile, Angus the Minotaur, nursing an unrequited crush on Lightning Lady, finds emotional support in a group called Minotaurs Without Mates — and maybe something more involving a duplicate Lightning Lady from a parallel universe.

As suspicions rise and loyalties fracture, Evil Inc: Double Crossed delivers a hilarious and twisty workplace whodunit — with the fate of the Fairmount branch (and one very tired Superhuman Resources department) hanging in the balance.

1r9ze7m,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1r9ze7m/dear_you/,"Dear, You.","Dear, You.

I am long gone when you'll be reading this,
Which is great cause that means you cared enough to look around and found this note.
And for that thank you.

I can't say that I'll be in a better place, because I know I won't be and because that's what happens to people who kill themselves; they don't get the mercy of a judgement.
So I'll probably be at the edge of life and death waiting for what will never come.

I want to tell you I was scared, so scared that I wanted to back out and not do it, but I still did it because the alternate would have been living and I was never meant to do that because there's no way that was supposed to be my life filled with so much grief, it was all borrowed time anyway and I just paid my debt.

I just waited too long in hopes something will change, waited too long for something or someone to come for me and they never did.

I don't remember the last time I was happy, that was something that wasn't in my fate and I accepted that a little late because I'm a human after all; made of nothing but hope and longing. but maybe the foundation of my being was greater suffering.

When you find me lying there lifeless, don't rush, don't scream, take your time, hold me close and call someone so you don't have to bear the burden of carrying my body alone.

I know no one hugs corpses but hold mine with pity because love and care was always foreign to me.

Know that I tried, know that I dared to hope, know that I waited, know that I wasn't a coward, know me and remember me as someone who just wanted love, and humans couldn't spare me even that.

Don't think of me as weak as I fought my demons everyday so they won't consume me in hopes that some miracle would happen and I'd think of my suffering and think it was indeed for something good, but the truth is bitter the kind of bitter that reminds you that no matter how much sweet you add to it, it won't change because it was never meant to be anything but bitter.

Remember me when you read a book, watch an anime, or when you draw something remember me on your morning walks, in the trees and in the rain that comes out of nowhere yet gives everything its color back, washing away the dirt that collected in hopes of one day rain would come and it did.

Though for me it never did. I didn't give up, I just got tired of waiting.
I drowned in my own misery and sorrows, the home built with my bare hands because nothing else ever was.
Laugh for me, live for me, dream for me as I never got to do any of those things

Remember me as a hot coffee in the morning that burns your lips, remember me as the bus you miss just by a few seconds that makes you cuss out the universe for being against you and having to sit and wait for another one to come, and while you wait you see everyone Rushing to live their life realising there are so many the likes of you.

Remember me in those inconveniences that don't make you miserable but annoy you and make you stop and watch life happening.

Just know that I was tired and now I'm just sleeping, from which I'll never wake up. 

One of us will be buried six feet under. And one of us will have to drag their body, force themselves to do things that the other one won't get to do anymore.

I was in so much pain so much that it baffled me that how could I be in so much mental pain and it didn't kill me, having to prove that I was suffering and I didn't want to do that anymore.

Because there comes a point where pain becomes too loud and life becomes too quiet, and it doesn’t feel like a tragic ending anymore. It just feels like a relief. A closing of tabs. A return of borrowed things. Death gets called a thief, but that’s lazy thinking. It doesn’t take, it trades. It waits. It wears you down with options. It becomes the last one that leaves the door ajar. So eventually, I said yes to that quiet, to the stillness.

Live to the fullest, laugh the loudest in the room, work your ass off to get that money, cry if you feel like it, let it all out punch walls, destroy things and then slowly gather it all up and glue it back together or throw it away

Because you are worth becoming someone I couldn't be and much more than that. You are worth becoming.
Be yourself, take that long ass fuck break in my name and just rot in bed eat all the snacks be messy, and take your time cleaning it up sing along to the music and break down in the middle of cleaning, because you're not doing okay.
 Do all of those things.

And get mad at me for dying, get mad at me for leaving you alone in this shit heap of a world, you don't know how good that will make me feel.

I'm not giving you a blueprint on how to live life after me but I'm telling you that it'll be okay if you do all these things. It's okay if you process your grief in the most messy way possible. It'll still be grief even if it doesn't match the description of it the society created.

Let your heartbreak, let it shatter and let it turn into the most strongest part of you.

Don't spend your whole life at my gravestone, if I was lucky enough to have one but do come every month if that's not too much to ask for do tell me about my fav kpop group and how they're doing, do tell me what new manga came out and if new seasons of my favourite anime came out and when you run out of topics tell me about the weather. 

I was lonely in life. Don't let me be lonely in death too if that's not too much to ask for.

I'll be at the edge of life and death waiting for you, when your time comes; which is not yet and not anytime soon. I'll wait for you to make it easier for you and then you can complain about everything and about how left you with just this letter till then, fight the letter argue with it throw it and pick it up again, and show it to me when you meet me and yell at me about how many grammatical mistakes I made in the letter bring your pain and sorrows with you I'll take it with me so you can rest easy.

I'll always be where I always am.

With love and pain,
S.

I like taking time to build characters, talk through ideas, and just hang out while we shape the story together, OOC is essential for me to build that connection.


Here are a few plot ideas to give you a sense of what I’m after:

SOL Ideas

Unexpected Roommates
Two strangers end up sharing a place because rent is ridiculous. They start off just trying to coexist, but shared routines and late‑night conversations slowly turn into something more.

The Coffee Shop Regular
He always orders the same thing. She’s the new barista who notices the little habits he doesn’t think anyone pays attention to. A quiet, everyday kind of romance built on small moments.

Fake Dating That Stops Being Fake
They agree to pretend to date for a family event, work situation, or some other social mess. It’s supposed to be temporary, but the line between acting and reality gets blurry.

Bridgerton‑Style Regency Romance

The Season’s Most Surprising Match
Set in a Bridgerton‑inspired world — ballrooms, gossip, pressure to marry well. He’s a reserved gentleman with a reputation for being hard to impress. She’s new to the season and not interested in playing by society’s expectations. One dance turns into a connection neither of them planned on.

Fantasy Romance Idea

The Mage and the Warrior
A disciplined warrior is assigned to protect a brilliant but stubborn mage whose research could change the fate of the kingdom. They clash at first, but danger forces them to rely on each other, and trust slowly turns into something deeper.

If any of these sound interesting — or if you’ve got ideas of your own — feel free to DM me. I’d love to build something together.

You are who you are. I am who I am. If what we are aren’t compatible, it is what it is.

I’ve learned recently that people typically don’t have expectations of those they truly care about. We accept them as they come, no disappointments.

Harsher than I needed to be, especially to those who have had the misfortune of reaching my inner circle. I’m sorry you had to be the catalyst of my growth. I’m sorry you had to deal with my growing pains.

Pinaka-pet peeve ko kasi as a customer yung ang tagal mong nakatayo para lang um-order at magbayad sa counter.

Kaya the past few months, I solo-built **CoffeeOS**. Basically it's a QR dine-in and take-out ordering system na may kasamang Kitchen Display System (KDS). The goal is to lessen yung wait time, 3-5 minute kaka-antay mo sa counter into a \~30-second ordering right from your table. No app download, browser lang. Scan, order, and pay.

For cafe owners naman: I've implemented a ""pay-to-release"" flow. Meaning, hindi lalabas sa screen ng mga barista / kusina yung order hangga't hindi verified yung bayad. No unpaid orders or order mistakes kasi digital na. If you have multiple branches, there's a centralized admin dashboard kung multi-branch yung setup kahit 1000 branches pa. kayang mamonitor lahat into 1 operation tab in real-time.

Naghahanap ako ngayon ng mga cafe owners na willing mag-pilot test nito. Literally free for my first few partners, gusto ko lang talaga ma-stress test sa real-world environment at makakuha ng honest feedback.

So I wanted to ask:   

* As a customer, would this be convenient for you? or do you still prefer the traditional order-taking (staff going back and forth)?
* Any features, modifications, or upgrades you’d want to see?

Let's call my ex-friend, Anna. We've been inseparable since college and it’s been 10 years of ups and downs.

Backing up 10 years ago: I had my own friend group and she had hers. I had an acoustic band back then, so I was usually with my bandmates or wherever there's music. I also organized music events and festivities for the school. Anna came in during my second year of college, so she immediately grouped with her batch of newbies.

Because the music org was a ""cool"" place to be, Anna's group blended into ours organically. Eventually, my friends became her friends because her original group became toxic. I was the one who adopted her. I eventually brought her into my other friend bubbles and even my family events—my grandma's birthday, my cousin's surprise party, and Christmas parties. That Christmas party was not even two months ago. Our last grocery date was just a few weeks ago.

For more context, I spent the first 3-4 years of friendship helping her with school. She herself has said a million times that I helped her school ethics and motivated her to study because I was an academic achiever. We shared the same economic class and bonded over being poor lol. Early on, there was a guy she liked who liked me first; I didn't dig him, but I felt ""icky"" having her as a friend at first because of how she handled it. Later, she started seeing a guy who had freshly broken up with his boyfriend—a boyfriend who was also Anna’s friend. She broke ""the friend code"" there, too.

That relationship was the messiest I’ve ever seen. When they broke up, the guy turned into a sociopath and started threatening other girls in our friend group for clout.

After graduating, I moved to India (my hometown) to study and work. I was stuck there for three years because of the pandemic. Meanwhile, life struck Anna. The threats from her ex made her paranoid and she stayed stuck inside her house. She worked from home, never socialized, gained weight, and became completely depressed.

I was on the other end of the screen ALL THE TIME. Even before that, I was the friend who would hold her hair back while she was puking, or sit behind the door when she needed company while shitting. I treasured that messiness because, for me, that’s love. I loved her even though I had to call her out every time! I would even subconsciously save her from her own bad jokes because I hate awkward silence. Anna tends to just spit out words as she thinks them; she means well, but she can lose class.

She was there for me, too. I’m not perfect. I told her my deepest insecurities in confidence that she would just listen and absorb me.

When I finally came back from India, it became the reason for our friend groups to reconnect. That went on for three years. Then, there was a bun in the oven. I am engaged, but the baby was unplanned. I was filled with anxiety and worried financially. I admit I changed; I’m easily paranoid, angry, or crying. But even with the hormones, I am very aware of it. I have ""reasonable"" crash outs. When I feel things, I want to feel them all, sulk, and then laugh it off.

For example, when my mom got cancer, I went from ranting day and night to vlogging myself shaving my mom’s hair off while cracking jokes. Since my fiancé works abroad, Anna was the one I’d confide in. She lives closer than my other friends. I wouldn't say my life is harder than hers, but this is my era to be messy, right?

We once had an explosive fight where Anna told me I was the problem because of my ""hormones."" I think that's unfair. I was heavily pregnant, busy working as a Chef from home, doing chores, and balancing everyone else’s baby anxiety. I had a traumatic birth and my baby was in the NICU. My brain has changed chemically.

Anna is my most high-maintenance friend. I still tried to give her time for ""friend dates"" even while overwhelmed. At 4 weeks postpartum, I was hearing the baby cry even when he wasn’t. I went back to work 3-4 days after birth! Whenever I told her I was overstimulated, she would use it against me later. She would repeat the words ""overwhelmed"" and ""overstimulated"" back to me mockingly until I started questioning myself.

Almost every time we met during my maternity leave, I cooked for her. She would bring baked cookies. When I told her (as a professional Chef of 6+ years) that her cookies didn't come out quite right once, she snapped, ""I bake more than you."" She has been using an oven for less than six months.

The final straw involves a TikTok trend: adding biscuits to Greek yogurt. I sent her a photo of a coffee-flavored overnight oat ""tiramisu"" I made with homemade yogurt. I thought she’d like it because it was high protein.

She replied, ""It depends on who mixes it. I crushed the cookies and added them to the yogurt... as someone who uses a lot of cream cheese, it's pretty similar.""

My ""Chef ears"" were burning. I laughed it off and said, ""Funny you say 'as someone who uses a lot of cream cheese,' I went through tons of Philadelphia in my pastry chef days, haha."" I said it to humble her.

She went off, calling me ""egoistic"" and saying she’s sensitive. Then she blamed her ""luteal phase"" (her usual excuse). This is the same girl who messaged me the day before, begging me to ""wake her up"" because she had a crush on a married man.

I’ve since talked to two common friends. Both say I’m not in the wrong. They think she has spiraled into a ""TikTok therapist/tarot reader"" spiritual mess.

I agree that ending the friendship is a good idea, but I’m still mad. I invested so much.

**13. will culminate in / culminate in**

Meaning: to result in; to reach a final outcome (can be positive or negative).

Note: This phrase can describe both good and bad outcomes.

**Positive example:**  
Years of research and development culminated in a groundbreaking discovery that changed the field.

**Negative example:**  
Tensions between the two sides culminated in a heated confrontation.



**14. To be specific / To be precise**

Used to clarify or further explain what you just said. It adds precision and makes your writing more detailed and academic.

**Example:**  
The city has seen a rise in tourism. To be specific, there has been a 20% increase in international visitors over the past year.



**15. Moving on to the matter of…**

A very useful transition phrase. It helps you shift smoothly and logically from one topic to another.

**Example:**  
We’ve covered the project’s timeline. Moving on to the matter of budgeting, let’s discuss the funding allocations.

Our small book club in Bern is looking for new members. This club was founded about 1.5 years ago through a reddit post. We are around 10 people right now and are looking for 3-5 more readers.

Since the groups founding, we’ve read quite a broad range of books (see list below) but we will probably focuse more on genre fiction (mostly science fiction and fantasy).

We’re also (mostly) talk in English as there are English-speaking people in the group.



**How we roll**

We meet every 6-8 weeks and read 1-2 books in that time. At the meeting we hang out, socialize, talk about how we liked the books and choose the next one(s). We met at different locations so far (Grosse Schanze, Rosengarten, Tramdepot) but most often at Erupt Lounge as it’s right at the trainstation and chill.

Sometimes we also do things outside our “official” meetings. The last book we read was made into a television series, so we met up and watched the series together.



**Our expectations**

We are looking for people who are interested in joining our sessions on a semi-regular basis. You don’t have to take part in every session and read every book, just check in every once in a while. If you are unsure, just join our meeting and see if you like our vibe.

 

**The books we have read so far**

* Elder Race (Adrian Tchaikovsky)
* Flowers for Algernon (Daniel Keyes)
* The House in the Cerulean Sea (TJ Klune)
* Stoner (John Williams)
* Blindsight (Peter Watts)
* Before the Coffee gets cold (Toshikazu Kawaguchi)
* Memoirs of a Geisha (Arthur Golden)
* Hogfather (Terry Pratchett)
* The Murderbot Diaries “All Systems Red” and “Artificial Condition” (Martha Wells)



Our current books are “There is no Antimemetics Division” (qntm) and “Starship Troopers” (Robert A. Heinlein) and our next meeting will probably take place in early April.

Recently I can no longer get the pressure up. With the finest grinds I can grind, and the highest amount I can squeeze in the portafilter and tamped down with all my body weight, the pressure gauge slowly climbs up as under-infused coffee pours out, barely arriving in the ""espresso range"" before quickly collapsing back down.

In contrast, for most of the past many years my shots used to come out at the very top of the espresso range, pressure wise with little or no dripping in the first part of the brew. The change has been gradual. There are also some noises during brewing which I can only describe as 'water frothing' sounds.

I don't have a true blind basket but only the rubberized one provided by Breville with a tiny hole in the center. With that in the single portafilter, pressing double shot, the pressure needle doesn't budge at all and water slowly trickles out.

All ordinary maintenance is up do date.

Is this a pump failure?

or is there an overpressure valve that could be stuck open? and if so is that replaceable?

What can I check further with reasonable expense of time and effort, before I decide it's time for a new machine?

Thanks!

\--update: as I am finally getting around to asking, the situation appears to be worsening and in fact it is now very hard to get any extraction at all. With maxed out finest grinds in the single portafilter, the machine couldn't extract a drop and the needle didn't budge. No pressure. With the grind amount set to a notch lower, I got a couple of drops, with the needle lifting but not making it into the espresso range. 

My ignorant guess is that a broken overflow valve wouldn't result in this behavior, and that this sounds just like a pump which no longer generates pressure. What do you say?",1,1771602839.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

# Section 2: Income

**Income Progression**: 

January 2012-December 2013: Worked part-time after graduating at $12/hr for a property management company. It was hard to find jobs in my field (advertising/media) at that time.

December 2013-November 2015: $32,000 as an ad sales assistant. Severely underpaid but that’s ad sales. The benefits were good at this job. I had one small raise in late 2014, $34,000.

December 2015-April 2017: $48,000 

September 2017-March 2020: Hired at $40,000 as a national account coordinator, received a small raise to $41,500 in October 2018 and another February 2020 to $43,150.

March 2020-April 2023: Promoted to marketing coordinator role at $55,000. Received raise in June 2021 to $58,000. No raise since then, but a performance bonus in March 2022 of $6000. 

May 2023-February 2025: Hired at $72,500 at current company at previous role. With incentives/bonus in 2024, made right around $84K.

March 2025-Present: After the money diary last year, our organization shifted, and our bonus/incentives were taken away. I laterally moved, and my base pay went up to $81K. My new role is less stressful and more enjoyable, so I'm ok with technically losing out on incentive opportunity. However, I did get a bonus payout of \~$4,500 this week from a sale I made last year during the transition period. 

**Main Job Monthly Take Home aka Net Pay**: **$3,973.62**

My partner and I combine almost all household expenses, so we share a joint credit card and joint checking for that purpose. But we do not have combined overall finances, so for the sake of the diary, I’ll include his income ($150,000/yr). Since getting engaged, I am more aware of his financial assets, and his net worth is significantly higher than mine. We plan to combine income and post-marital assets upon marriage.

# Section 4: Money Diary 

**Day 1 – Friday**

6:45A: Little Dog (LD) and Big Dog (BD) wake me up because they're ready for breakfast, but it’s technically a weekend, so it’s R’s turn to feed the pups. Because it’s a leisurely morning, R joins me to cuddle for a few minutes before we get up.

7:15A: After our Nespresso died in the fall, we scouted holiday sales for an actual espresso machine. We love it so much, although my latte art needs some work. I have a 2-shot pistachio latte along with cheesy avocado grits (with flax seed for nutrients), and R has cereal.

8A: We play with the dogs in the backyard until LD decides he’s done. BD would rather stay outside munching the plants, but he's not trustworthy out there alone. Then it’s time to tidy up the house and change the sheets before we pack up and head to the airport. As usual, my mom is more than willing to stay with our sweet pups while we’re away.

11:30A: Time to get on the road! It’s an hour to the next bigger city airport, though it’s still pretty small. We intend to pick up lunch nearby the airport, but the line at Whattaburger (which I wanted to try for the first time) is so long we don’t think we’ll have time, and there’s not much else around by the time we get around the airport. The fuel light comes on as we near the airport, so we make sure to get gas so we don’t have to make a mad dash to a gas station after we get back. **($22.26, R)**

12:30P: Since we have a checked bag, we get to the airport with just under an hour to our flight time. Of course, as we get through TSA, we see the incoming plane hasn’t even arrived yet, so the flight is delayed. We grab some Jimmy John’s, sharing a giant sub **($21.40)**, and 2 Dunkin iced coffees **($9.46)** and relax until our flight.

5P: After a longer delay than expected and getting our bags, we hop into an Uber and get to our hotel for a little nap and refresh before dinner. (**$6.94**, after a $10 promo and $15 credit from our CC rewards).

7:15P: We walk to the restaurant, Heritage, a pizza/pasta that got a Michelin Bib Gourmand for 2025. We share the red butter & microgreen salad, which was incredibly orange-forward and could have used something salty/briny to cut through the acid, and the sausage and broccoli rabe pizza, which was delicious but could have used an acid. Go figure! Halfway through dinner, one of the garde mangers yells at the chefs to “get it fucking together,” and some things I can’t quite hear but it goes on for longer than I’d like. Some diners seem to find it entertaining (The Bear effect?), but we’re mostly uncomfortable. I grab the bill, since R paid for our hotel stay. **($92.76**, solo**)**

9:30P: I’m a cookie fiend, and there’s a cookie place literally right around the corner, so I grab a cookie **($7.06**, solo**)** and graciously let R have a bite or 2 of mine after he decides he doesn’t want one. We head back to the hotel and go to bed.

Day 1 Total: $159.88

**Day 2 – Saturday**

7A: Even if I wake up around the same time as usual, it’s nice to not have a schmedium-sized dog whining in my face. R has already been awake for about an hour (also normal, unfortunately), so he’s ready for breakfast. Our hotel offers continental breakfast, which isn’t my favorite, but it does the job. I eat half an egg & turkey sausage on wheat, a blueberry mini scone, and an apple with peanut butter. R enjoys his eggs, turkey sausage, yogurt and granola. He’s a lot less bougie than me. After breakfast, we get ready to go explore.

9:30A: The warmth, the sunshine: it’s glorious! We start our excursion with a leisurely walk on the Riverwalk. And then I realize when we get a mile down, that I’ve lost my visor. We retrace our steps, but alas, we don’t find it. Once we get back to the start of the Riverwalk, though, a water trolley is arriving. Since it’s a busy holiday weekend, they’re only going one way, but it’s nice to take a free 15-minute ride on the river.

11:30A: After walking back toward Las Olas Blvd, it’s time to browse the shops. I’m on the hunt for a white, natural fiber skirt to wear with a cropped red & white linen puff sleeve top that I brought for Valentine’s. I’ve had it for a couple years but have never found the right white skirt to wear with it. I don’t find a white skirt, but I do find a lovely pair of 100% cotton pants that cup my butt perfectly, and they’re 50% off, so I snatch them up (**$24.61**, solo). Halfway through our browsing, we pop into Capital One Café for half-priced iced lattes **($9.76)**.

1:30P: All the walking and browsing worked up our appetites, so we hit up a Mexican restaurant with indoor-outdoor dining. R has fish tacos, and I get a carnitas burrito. Both dishes are quite good, though their chips could use some seasoning (**$48.73**, solo). After lunch, we head back to the hotel for a bit of a nap and refresh before dinner.

4P: We take the water taxi **($78.43, R)** to the beach, stroll for a mile or so, and then take the water taxi back to our dinner stop. The yachts and megamansions lining the intracoastal and river enrage us, especially the Fountainhead and *one* of Bill Gates’ support yachts. Tax the fucking rich, y’all.

7P: Sushi at a more local spot, which we booked via Resy and use our quarterly AMEX credit on. Their specialty cocktails are the best thing we order: mine is a bahama mama, because it's fruity and tropical, and R orders an interesting tequila drink that I don't remember. I get a shrimp tempura roll and a specialty roll with different types of tuna, and R orders a medium-spicy pad thai, which is so unspicy that even I can eat it. He is unimpressed. (**$12.94** after our quarterly Resy credit)

10P: After a much too long journey, with too many drunken asshole encounters, we make it back to our hotel and cuddle briefly before falling to sleep.

Day 2 Total: $174.47

**Day 3 – Sunday**

7A: R has been awake an hour and a half, so he wants breakfast immediately. It’s a repeat of yesterday’s breakfast, though I switch out the bread and mini scone for 2 mini waffles.

10:15A: We take the Brightline train to Miami **($104.00, roundtrip)**. First stop, Little Havana. After a bit more walking than I intended, we end up at Sala’o for drinks and lunch. Their drinks are delicious: mine is a pink gin & prosecco cocktail, and R’s is a coconut-topped sherry old fashioned. The live music is loud but joyous, and while it’s touristy as hell, we don’t have ANY Cuban restaurants in our current city, so I’m going to enjoy my good but not quite authentic empanadas and lechon asado. It’s fine! **($79.61)**

1P: We head to Brickell Centre, with a quick pitstop by Capital One Café for iced lattes **($10.02)**. First we stop by Saks, because we must to get a $50 gift card, which will be credited as a reward. I have no idea what I’ll eventually purchase with these, but it’s going to be something luxurious that I wouldn’t allow myself to buy otherwise (**$50** but also free). Then we head to Indochino, because we’re looking for R’s wedding suit. All appointments were taken when we looked into it, so we only get to compare fabrics. Since that’s pretty much a bust, we shuffle over to SuitSupply. Our helper seems very new at this, and we ultimately leave because they say they can only do custom in R’s size, which I learn after that the guy said he’s a 34! R is slim but definitely a 38, which wouldn’t be a custom size. We did like the fabric and fit of the Havana suit, though, so R keeps that in mind.

3:30P: On our train back to Fort Lauderdale, I make a reservation for the Cheesecake Factory which is mere steps from our hotel. I know, it’s a chain, but we don’t have one, and I love it. Also, I really, really want cheesecake.

7P: I’m in my element. Give me brown bread, some kind of pasta, and cheesecake, and I’m a happy lady. R had never dined at the Cheesecake Factory, nor had heard of its splendor, until meeting me, and I know he’s ever grateful for it. We want to split the chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake, but our server says they don’t have it, so we settle on the Snickers instead. I’m only a little miffed when we walk out later to see that they have, like, 7 pieces of the cookie dough left. Oh well, que sera sera. **($74.00, solo)**

9P: It’s been a long day, so we call it an early night.

Day 3 Total: $317.63

**Day 4 – Monday**

8A: After a leisurely wake-up and showers, we’re delighted that our breakfast options have expanded. Cheese and sausage biscuits are on the menu today, so I put egg on that sucker and have a good ol’ time. After breakfast, we head back upstairs to pack.

9:30A: We head to the airport via Lyft **($19.99)** and oof, it’s a madhouse. Even the pre-check lane takes 30+ minutes after checking our bag. We also discover the lounge we have access to is not in our terminal, and there’s no access. Luckily I have Goldfish in my bag for a snack, but I do get a bottle of water from one of the grab & go kiosks **($4.27)**.

1:30P: After being delayed on the tarmac for 45 minutes (no comms from the pilot, so who knows why), we successfully land back in the next biggest city airport. We pay for parking **($60.00)**, and on our hour drive back, we hit up Chick fil a for lunch **($19.26)**.

3:30P: The dogs go insane when we get home, and I have the scratches to prove it. We immediately head out to play with them, or else LD will never calm down. BD just wants to be near us, sweet boy. When we get back inside, I transfer mom’s dogsitting money to her **($60.00)**.

6P: We feed the doggos and then decide what to eat from our freezer. I’ve been batch cooking meals and then freezing them. It’s a total game changer! White chicken chili is what strikes our fancy, and it’ll give us lunch tomorrow, too.

8P: We’ve been searching for a new duvet cover for a while, because our light blue one gets gross looking too quickly. BD’s skin issues don’t help, so we want a navy one in a percale or linen. The Company Store has a percale cotton option on sale for Presidents’ Day, and we decide it’s good enough **($116.52)**. We also measure R, so we can order the right size from SuitSupply. We confirm he’s definitely a 38R. He orders the color we liked in store. **($649.92)**. Lastly, we see a great deal on a reward flight to Barcelona for our honeymoon. Business class, baby! For both of us, it’s 126K miles and **$587.48**. Neither of us has ever flown business class, so we’re excited. We’ve already booked our return flight from Paris. It feels good to finally be able to book hotels & activities.

10P: Back to our normal bedtime routine.

Day 4 Total: $1,517.44

**Day 5 – Tuesday**

7A: After having iced lattes this past weekend, I’m all about it. I make a pistachio iced latte, but it’s too strong. Just how much milk do coffee shops use? Back to my cheesy flax grits, sans avocado.

8A: Dog playtime while I listen to a podcast, which today is Sam Sanders. He’s truly one of the best interviewers.

9A: Grocery pickup before starting work. Among some of our staples (oat milk, crackers), I get ingredients for chicken & sweet potato coconut curry as well as chorizo green chile enchiladas **($56.12)**.  

10A: Work. Today is a lot of internal product learning sessions. Some of it is great, some of it is not.

Noon: Leftover white chicken chili & doggy playtime. We also take a 30-min lunch nap. I was recently diagnosed with a medical condition that causes fatigue. For a long time, I thought I was just unhappy with my job and/or lazy but it’s nice to know it’s maybe not that. I do actually like my job, and I don’t want to think I’m just lazy. I’ll likely need surgery later this year, which should be curative, but my some of my lab levels need to stabilize first.

5P: R is home! I put brown rice in the Instant Pot and prep the sweet potatoes and veggies for our curry. I’m batch cooking and freezing leftovers. It yields 8 portions to freeze! The dogs’ routine is thrown off, and they start clamoring for dinner early. But they have to wait until 6, as is normal.

7P: We settle down for dinner and the Traitors. Yep, this is the fourth year in a row watching The Traitors during our money diary period. Rob is playing such a good Traitor game, and this is one of the first years I'm not actively wishing the Faithfuls take the Traitors out.

9P: I forgot to mention, but my Fitbit bit the dust on vacation. It’s my third one in 4ish years, so I decide I’m DONE with them, but I feel naked without a watch now, so I’m going old school with a Casio with a step tracker on it. I also order a slim leather credit card case, a replacement packable visor, and arthritis gel for R. He injured his foot playing soccer last year, and even though it’s technically healed, it will ache after a long day. **$95.30**

10P: Lights out!

Day 5 Total: $151.42

**Day 6 – Wednesday**

7A: Another iced latte and cheesy flax grits.

8A: LD gives up his herding ball and frisbee in, like, 3 minutes. This usually indicates he wants an actual walk, and yep, he allows us to walk! (Update from last diary: LD will generally not let us walk unless R is with us, likely due to the unleashed, aggressive dogs we encountered after the hurricane. We’re still working on him getting comfortable again in the neighborhood. But good news, they are back to their healthy weights!)

9A: Work is light again today. During our team call, I walk for an hour on my walking pad while the pups nap.

Noon: Leftover curry and playtime with LD & BD.

2P: After a couple internal calls, I troubleshoot some client issues. One of them is kind of weird, and I have no idea how to begin to fix it. I might have to loop in my manager.

5P: R is home! He plays with the pups and then we relax together while talking about some plans we have for next month.

6P: Feed the dogs and then thaw some wild rice & chicken soup. We attend a call for a leftist organization in our area, because we’re thinking about volunteering for a protest coming up.

7P: We eat dinner while watching Shrinking. God it’s so good. We thought Paul might die this season (😭), but after this most recent episode, I think he might just retire off-screen.

10P: Bedtime

Day 6 Total: $0 – Look, ma, a no-spend day!

**Day 7 – Thursday**

7A: Yesterday I was so hungry, so today I decide to have cheesy grits along with a whole wheat blueberry banana muffin I have in the freezer.

8A: Another walk! This time we go all the way to the lake, which is awesome. The tulip poplars started blooming while we were gone, and today I see daffodils. It’s almost the best time of the year here, and I hope it's not a false spring.

10A: First client meeting of the week, which is bizarre. Usually I’d be on client meeting 10 or so by now, but Q1 is generally a slower period for us. She compliments me, which I love, but disses our platform, which I don’t love.

Noon: I start heating up my lunch and then remember I actually have a noon meeting today. Oops! I join the call, and luckily it only takes 20 minutes. My chicken soup dumplings (from Trader Joe’s) are still pretty warm and very delicious after I make it back to the kitchen.

3P: I take a break to talk to a colleague about her son’s wedding last weekend. It was beautiful, and she had a great time. Happy for her! Everything about her screams casually wealthy, and I can’t wait to see pictures when she gets them.

5P: R’s not home. Dogs are bereft. While he works a little later than normal, I hop to the store to pick up a few items that were out of stock at grocery pickup but that I need for tonight’s dinner. At Lidl, I grab 3 avocados, a bag of shredded lettuce, a pack of carb counter tortillas, and a bag of Cheeto puffs **($18.36)**. Cheetos aren't a normal item, but I’m having lunch with mom tomorrow: green goddess tuna on everything bagel, and Cheeto puffs are literally the best accompaniment. I will not abide your judgment.

6:30P: We settle on the couch with dinner and Grey’s Anatomy. We’re on season 16, and some parts are still enjoyable, but this season is the biggest slog so far. I’ve heard it kind of turns a corner after the COVID season, though. Fingers crossed.

8P: R’s suit arrived today, so I’m treated to a little fashion show. Even without alterations, he looks so good. I can’t wait to marry this man.

10P: Ahh, the new duvet cover is wonderful. Sleep tight, everybody.

Day 7 Total: $18.36

**Weekly Total: $2,339.20**

Food + Drink: 463.75

Shopping: $105.33 (not counting the $50 Saks gift card, which was credited back to us)

Transportation: $291.62

Dogsitting: $60

Wedding & Honeymoon: $1,237.40

**Reflections:** 

I think this year’s money diary is a pretty accurate reflection of how we spend our time and money. We generally go for a long weekend trip every quarter or so, and this one was more expensive than most because we’ll go to a state or National park many times instead of a popular, expensive locale during a romantic holiday weekend. But when we’re not spending on vacations, we are pretty frugal and conscious of our spending and time.

1r9yuos,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1r9yuos/attractionlovetransference/,Attraction/Love/Transference,"Hello r/therapy. So, I've been seeing my therapist for nearly three years, and it's been a great experience. She's helped me navigate shame, loneliness, anxiety/depression, abandonment, some incredibly difficult times as caregiver to my aging parents, and attempts to create emotional intimacy with my wife. She's encouraged and inspired me to return to playing music, to set boundaries and put myself first. From the very beginning I found it easy to open up to her, to be vulnerable and emotional, something I really hadn't ever experienced before.

I specifically sought out a female therapist because, while I've had male friends, I've always harbored a measure of distrust and held them at arms length (thanks, Dad). I've always connected better with women, and I suppose somewhere in the back of my mind I knew there was a risk that I could end up catching feelings. And so, here I am.

On the one hand I am 100% fully (painfully) aware that this is a professional relationship - one with an expiration date. But I honestly don't know how anyone can do this and not end up having feelings for someone with whom you laugh, cry, and share your inner life, week in and week out. I've made real progress, and there's still work to be done, but I find myself thinking more and more about how one day this will all come to an end. I'll walk out of her office for the last time, and right now I can only imagine how heartbreaking that will feel. We can't even be friends, grab a coffee and catch up. Just a handshake, a thanks for everything. Goodbye.

It's not like I'm not consumed by this, and I'm able to compartmentalize and focus on the work. But I am attracted to her, and I feel like I'm in love with her. I feel like I would do anything for her, after all she's done for me. After three years, I can't imagine she hasn't picked up on it. I've literally admitted during sessions that the open, honest, vulnerable emotional connection I have with her is exactly what's been missing in my life. From a clinical perspective I suppose this probably works in my favor, but it's really hard crawling into a bubble for an hour a week and experiencing something you so desperately want to be a part of your everyday life. Things have improved at home, but it's increasingly apparent that my marriage will never feel the way I want (need) it to feel. I suppose coming to terms with that, and finding a way to wean myself off the emotional connection I have through therapy is what lies ahead.

I guess this is sounding like a vent, but any perspective or insight would be helpful. From what I've read, the general feeling seems to be that I should tell her how I'm feeling, but I really don't think I can. I can't possibly risk upsetting the dynamic we have, and I'm definitely not starting over with someone else - this is it. Maybe I need another therapist to help me navigate the transference with this one? (😆) Seriously, though - it's a good feeling, most of the time, and it sustains me. But it also weighs on me, and can feel kind of ... well, sad.

I also have a problem that when I don't like the food (or I think I wont like it) I still force myself to eat it. 



Also recently when I was in some country I had food I didn't like two days in a row for dinner (the first one probably because of jetlag or maybe because it was touristy place cause the place had 4.3/5 on google but almost all negative opinions on google when I looked later were from locals and the second one I ordered something based on reccomendation from the waitress and one of the dishes was nice but the other one not so much) but the other two days I ate food I loved and would eat again in a hearbeat. Now because of it I feel so bad like I didnt experience the good local food enough.



I'm always kinda scared(?) when I look for restaurants cause I want every meal I eat to be good and I'm scared I'm going to end up in a tourist trap. I wish I could just go to random restaurant I see but I fear I'm going to make a wrong choice or go somewhere with bad reviews (once on a trip when I wanted coffee I literally stood between two cafés looking through reviews). I'm also easily influenced (but I'm working on it) meaning if someone says that x place is a tourist trap I won't go there even if many people say it's good and if someone close to me reccomends me a place and I eat there I won't tell them I didnt like it.

1r9ym3g,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmITheJerk/comments/1r9ym3g/aitj_for_becoming_distant_from_a_flaky_friend_who/,AITJ for becoming distant from a flaky friend who then mocked me?,"I'm in a friend group of four: me, ""Anne"", ""Lina"", and ""Margot"". We all used to work together, and were pretty regular hanging out after work. Over time, we all moved on with other things in our lives and we stopped meeting as a group. We'd still be in touch, mostly over text.

This is mainly about Anne. We used to be quite close, but we haven't met in person in a few years. We still text, but most of the time she reaches out asking for career advice. It started to feel a bit utilitarian. Whenever meeting up came up, she'd usually be too busy or too tired, but I’d see she was meeting other people. Last November she said we should lock in a date, I sent her my availability, and she never followed up. Over time I became less chatty and responsive. She noticed and even asked me at some point if I was going to ghost her too, since apparently others had.

Fast forward to a couple of weeks ago, she texted the group chat suggesting we all finally meet again for coffee. We don’t all live in the same city anymore, and I work full-time, so I said weekends would be easier for me. Anne and Margot made a few comments about that, saying I was going to be difficult and that it was my choice to move further away after all. Anne also kept using an old woman emoji to refer to me (I am the oldest in the group). It didn't feel like a joke, but more like a jab. 

That whole exchange made me not really want to meet anymore, so I said I wasn’t available after all and told them to have fun, which I did mean. Right after, Anne texted me privately asking: ""Honestly, do you have something against me?"" I said: ""No, nothing against you. I’ve just been a bit more low-energy socially lately, so I’m more selective with plans"". She never replied to that, and it's been a few weeks now.

Have we changed, or do we talk about change? What has changed? Honestly! Take a look around you. Do you still argue? Are you still “*fighting everything and everyone*” (including yourself)? Have you just put down the drink and drugs? Are you now more miserable than ever? Are you eating more? Smoking cigarettes again? Vaping this time? Cussing more (that’s me!)? This shit happens. Happens all the time. People kid themselves about what they are actually doing in recovery. They hit a few meetings, make a few phone calls to that once-a-month sponsor they got, and think that is enough to change. Sadly, it is not enough, and we all know it. Your boss, your spouse, and your friends are likely waiting for you to fail while they grab the popcorn to watch you implode. It doesn’t have to be like this. It can be better. Stop bullshiting yourself and reach out again. No matter what we are going through, we all need extra help.

**Reflections**

Are you bullshitting yourself? Is it still so fucking hard? Why?

**Daily Challenge**

Try going without another vice (coffee, nicotine, sugar, etc.) for one day, or at least try cutting back on it for today.

I would like to think that those first few years were when I was *really* changing... But looking back, if I had read this then, I would have said, ""Oh! I have changed!"" and I would have passed a lie detector test saying it. But the reality is that I was in such self-delusion about my newfound life in sobriety that I would have been unwilling to reflect on the very present faults in my character that continued to dominate my personality. Just like my drinking, my behavior was a problem, and I was the last one to see it. I am thankful that I reached out... again. 

Stay active. Stay sober.

Recently during my coffee chat with the store manager, she told each of us that we are allowed one 10/15 minute break as the company allows it per shift. 

I tried to take my 15 minute break two days ago during an 8 hour shift.

My manager denied me. I was a little confused by her explanation and I told her the store manager by name said that we are allowed one 10-15 min break every shift. I asked again during the next CEL’s hour because before this point, I take a 10/15 minute break every 7-8 hour shift because i’m EXHAUSTED WORKING.

Sounds fair. The next manager allowed me to go.

The next day i come to work, another 8 hour shift. So i ask for a 15.

After my 15 minute break the  CEL has the L2 walk around and tell each individual employee that we after allowed 15 minute breaks anymore only if you work 9+ hours.. 

Which makes no sense? I’ve worked multiple jobs where i get a 10/5 minute break for working even 6 hours?

All this to ask, do you guys take 10-15 minute breaks as well as a 45/30 at your store? 

because i was actually accused of stealing company time because i asked to take a 10 minute break? which is allowed? or no t allowed? i don’t fucking know.

OH. that was the ADHD. and also somehow that was you surviving it.

i've been sitting with this for a couple years now and i keep coming back to the same five things that quietly held my life together before i had any language for what was wrong with me. not because i was smart. because i was desperate.

1. moving my body (and i mean this as someone who genuinely hated exercise): i started because i hated being overweight at 21, not because i read anything about dopamine or prefrontal cortex access or whatever. but something shifted. the hyperfocus kicked in around results and i got consistent almost by accident. turns out it was doing something real to my brain the whole time. i still don't like working out. i do it every day.
2. taking sleep seriously: this one only happened because i noticed i couldn't make myself exercise on bad sleep days. so it was less ""i will prioritize rest"" and more ""i have to do this or the one thing holding me together falls apart."" unglamorous. worked.
3. getting my own space: i grew up in a house where i never knew what i was walking into (alcoholic parent, chaotic energy, the whole thing). getting my own apartment in my mid-20s was the first time i felt my nervous system actually settle. i didn't understand why until way later. the external environment was just... directly mirroring my internal state. when the dishes were done i could THINK. that's not metaphorical. that's just how it worked.
4. yoga and then meditation: came into this during grief (my mom, a divorce, a cross-country move all sort of compressed together). not the fix i was looking for. quietly became the most important thing. i use insight timer now, free app, not sponsored, just genuinely what i use.
5. systems for everything: this is the one that only landed after the diagnosis. automating decisions so i don't have to make them in the moment. pills by the coffee maker. weekly reviews. notion. sounds boring, changed my actual life.

the part i can't stop thinking about is that none of these were ADHD strategies. they were just things i stumbled into out of pain or embarrassment or desperation. and they worked because turns out they're exactly what an unregulated ADHD brain needs.

someone in this community shared something similar a while back and it's part of what made me want to post this. some sharp people here if you haven't been paying attention.

a bit of context: i was averaging around 6 hours a day. mostly reddit, youtube, instagram, and just aimless tab surfing on my laptop. i am 20, in school, and the irony of spending more time scrolling about being productive than actually being productive was not lost on me.



here is what genuinely changed things:



1. i stopped treating my phone like it lives on my desk



this sounds small but it was probably the biggest shift. the phone now has a physical home that is not within arm's reach of where i work or sleep. i made it slightly annoying to pick up. that extra 10 seconds of friction kills about 60 percent of impulse grabs before they happen.



2. i replaced the first 20 minutes of my morning



i used to open my phone before i was even fully awake. now i make coffee and do not touch it until i have written down what i actually want to get done today. one to three things max. my brain is in a completely different state when i sit down to work now.



3. i stopped trying to fight individual apps



blockers and timers worked for like a week. the addiction just rerouted. what worked instead was giving myself a clear answer to the question ""what am i doing right now"" before opening anything. if i could not answer that, i did not open it. sounds dumb but having to name the reason before unlocking something is weirdly powerful.



4. i tracked the habit not the screen time number



staring at the screen time report every day made me feel bad without changing anything. i flipped it and started tracking whether i hit my focus habits each day, not how long i was on my phone. one simple yes or no per day. that tiny reframe did more than any blocker app. i use a small focus tracker called tunnelvision for this, basically just a habit layer that keeps the daily intention visible.



5. the real unlock was boredom tolerance



you cannot out-block your own brain. the blockers help but the underlying thing is that i had zero tolerance for doing nothing. sitting in a waiting room without my phone felt unbearable. i started practicing that deliberately, just sitting, no phone, no podcast, for a few minutes a day. after a few weeks it stopped feeling like torture.



right now i am sitting at 80 to 90 minutes most days. some days i go over and that is fine. the difference is i am no longer doing it unconsciously.

On the way back home he mentioned his plans for the next week and I later said that I would like to go on Friday to visit my friend at my hometown which is 1 hour and a half drive from where we live. My friend is leaving abroad for a couple of weeks and we wanted to spend a night with the girls. Basically I was asking him if he could give me a ride because I don’t have a driving license. He said no and seemed upset. I texted the groupchat that I wouldn’t be able to come on Friday because I don’t have a ride. They immediately said that they themselves are willing to come take me. I then asked my husband if his problem was giving me a ride or me going at all. He got angry and said that he doesn’t like spending Fridays without me. We had already brought a cake and he wanted to go to his parents’ house. Although we had an argument in the car, we still made it to his parents’ house and I acted as if nothing happened. However, he mentioned something about friends and his mom started talking about how she stopped being friends with many girls after getting married because her husband became a priority. I now understand that this is something that he expected me to do as this seems to be the norm at his family. I never saw a reason to distance myself from my friends in my hometown and I expected him to be ready to drive me home to my parents whenever I felt the need to. Maybe I shouldn’t have such expectations. Now we’ve been married for 6 months and it has been recurring that he is upset whenever I hangout with my friends. He doesn’t understand why I need the girls around me or how the energy I get from them isn’t something he could just replace. We went home afterwards and I didn’t say anything about what happened as I didn’t want to make a problem. Thursday I tried acting fine although I was upset but I didn’t say anything. He asked why was I looking upset and I said i’m fine. Then he started talking angrily about my friends and how my connection to them is always creating problems between us and that one day they’ll get married and they will abandon our friendship something that i’m not willing to do for his sake. He himself has a few friends but he never spends a boys’ night. He might meet up with them for coffee and that’s it. He likes me to be involved in all his plans and expects me to involve him in all my plans. Anyway, he was really angry and said that my friends has ruined his birthday for him and they were putting pressure one me. I wanted to have a civil conversation with him but he didn’t allow me to speak not one word. After some time I broke out crying. I locked myself in the bedroom and cried for about an hour and he didn’t do anything about it. I then got up and walked to the train station and went to my parents’ house. He didn’t bother coming after me but he did however call me and asked if I wanted him to come take me before I went up on the train. I of course was raging with emotions and didn’t agree. I went to my parents’ house and he didn’t speak to me all day. He called my mother and my mother blamed him for allowing me to get on that train alone. He was really upset she didn’t get his point. My father as well said he sees nothing wrong with me wanting to come home and spend sometime with my friends. I really expected a call from him, when he didn’t call I told my friend we can hangout tonight instead of tomorrow as I am in town. My friend posted a story of us together and that’s when he started calling. He demanded I go back to my parents’ house or we might be over. I said this isn’t the right time or place to talk over the phone and I don’t want to involve my friends in our conversation. He had an argument through message and when I got home we talked over the phone till 4am. Which was summed up in his wish to be more in control over our social boundaries with either his family and friends or mine. I said I won’t be coming back home unless he changes something and started taking more responsibility over his actions and speech. Today we haven’t talked at all.

A few days ago, I accidentally set off the smoke alarm (ironically, while trying to cook something that would make less noise) just before 6AM and my parents' roommate came out of his room to make a point of how upset he was, made coffee, then went back to bed and proceeded to not talk to me or my mom the entire day. He came up to my mom later that evening and gave her a small gift to break the ice but he still doesn't talk to me, lol.

Yesterday, my dad confronted me, saying that the roommate complained I was making too much noise at night and that the smoke alarm going off made me lose credibility with him. I know I messed up that night, but I honestly didn't expect it would set off the alarm since there was literally no smoke - it's just brand new and really sensitive, apparently. I asked my dad what I could do differently and he said ""don't wake him up"". I tried explaining all the measures I've been taking to avoid waking him up, like loading the coffee maker in advance and trying to open drawers quietly, but he wouldn't have it, he accused me of being argumentative and defensive. I asked my dad again what specific noise the roommate was complaining about and he said ""he shouldn't have to give you a play by play of how to prepare a meal without making noise"". My dad also told me not to talk to the roommate about any of this, which is the opposite of what my therapist suggested, saying, ""if he moves out, we'll be financially ruined. You'll be eating rice and God knows what else"".

I feel like since it bothers the roommate and I genuinely don't know what else I could do differently, the onus should be on him to come to me and communicate what's bothering him instead of going behind my back to my parents. Otherwise, I feel like I should approach him and try to have a calm, rational conversation because the situation is currently unsustainable. Am I the crazy one here?

It wasn't some huge blowup, more like we kept circling the same arguments until I finally said I'm done. We agreed to stay polite and not drag mutual friends into it. For a couple weeks it was fine, then he started ""checking in"" and I kept my replies short. Then the gifts started.

First one showed up at my dorm desk, a tote bag with a little note saying ""saw this and thought of you."" I texted him thanks but told him clearly, please don't do gifts. He said ""it's not a big deal, I'm not asking for anything."" After that it became like a pattern. Every 10-14 days something new shows up. A book, a scarf, a coffee gift card, a plushie of an animal I used to joke about. None of it is expensive but it adds up and more then that it makes me feel watched. Every time I get the email from the front desk my chest gets tight. My friends keep saying ""he's just being nice"" but it doesn't feel nice, it feels like he's trying to keep a little claim on me.

Last week I sent a really direct text: please stop sending me things, I'm serious, it's messing with my head and it's not respectful. He replied with this long emotional paragraph about how I'm turning kindness into something ugly and that I'm being cold. Then two days later another package shows up anyway. A hoodie in my favorite color with a note that said ""for late nights."" I hit a wall. I packed every single thing he'd sent into a box and mailed it back to his adress. No note, no explanation, nothing. I just wanted it out of my space.

He texted ""wow ok. you're really doing this"" and said I humiliated him and made him look pathetic. Mutual friends are saying I should've at least written something because sending it back with no note looks petty. I wasn't trying to be cruel, I was just done.

As much as I am a confirmed asshole, I also do a lot of volunteer work. I drive seniors to medical appointments and pick up groceries for a couple of them every week.  
Their shopping lists are static. Almost identical, week to week. Seniors' food, like staples.  
So you start to really learn prices. Seems every week, the peanut butter goes up 25 cents, no name Potato Chips up 17 cents and lets not even talk about coffee. When I drop these groceries off, one of the seniors pay in cash. This morning, the senior had her cash ready because when the list she gave me this morning was identical to the list she gave me TWO weeks ago. She kept the receipt and was ready with the cash because she thinks I am in a hurry.  
So, same list...two weeks, and it was $4.19 MORE than two weeks ago.  
She struggles bad so I just took the $95.00 she had and left, eating the four bucks myself.  
So a quick dive in the stats and January food inflation is SEVEN PERCENT.  
So, I am judging now.   
So, will the liberal voters speak out and call out this blatant broken promise? Or will they say it's my fault for not knowing how to shop and such?  
Anyway, that's my story for today.",32,1771601325.0,CanadianConservative,8,0.94,False
1r9yby9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1r9yby9/please_give_me_advice_tell_me_what_to_do_please/,PLEASE GIVE ME ADVICE/ TELL ME WHAT TO DO PLEASE🥺,"I am just looking for some advice from an unbiased point of view. So buckle up, grab some popcorn and put your best advice giving glasses on.

So I (21f) and my best friend(also 21f) let’s call her Jess, have been best friends since we were in the eighth grade. We have been through group friendships together, fights, relationships, family, drama, and everything else in between. We’ve cried together over her past relationship (never been in one and she’s only been in one), and we’ve fought no end on other things. Basically she is my person and we’ve been through hell. The problem is that from my point of view, I am giving my all and I’m not receiving as much.

For context, I grew up in a very verbally abusive household. But that is a story for another time. Because of this, I have the tendency to lie to anyone who I feel is going to get mad as a way to not cause problems because I’m telling them what they want to hear. Not great, I know, but I am sincerely trying to work on this and have been since I left my parents house when I was 18. And we have had smaller fights about this throughout our friendship because she is the one person that I cannot lie to. The last fight being around four months ago. She knows why I lie and it’s very understanding when it comes to this.

Now she  started a new job around August of this year so she’s been working at it for about six months.

Her Job has come new people that she’s met, which is so great. I’m glad that she’s meeting new people, but she has this new friend. Let’s call her Britney. Britney is a year younger than us and let’s just say she is the worst flake I have ever met in my entire life. They would make plans to hang out and at the very last second she would either cancel saying she didn’t wanna go or she would cancel because she found better plans and she did this constantly.

Throughout our friendship she has always called me jealous when she would have new friends or new people that she would hang out with because to be honest I don’t have a lot of friends. I will say that I do get a little jealous when we would go out just because I am a very over protective person. over Halloween weekend this past year me Britney and Jess went out drinking. I honestly don’t remember much of the night but according to Jess, I was extremely rude to Brittany the entire night and even went as far as to call her a not nice name because she wanted to Uber the five minute walk back to our house.( don’t worry it wasn’t anything really bad, I just don’t want to say it here just in case someone has a trigger to it) I apologized profusely saying I don’t remember ever being mean and she responded telling me that if I was going to be mean to her friends just because I’m jealous then she doesn’t want me there. I also apologized to Brittany, but she never opened the message or replied back, and the three of us haven’t went out since.

Starting probably two or three months back, Jess starts complaining to me about Brittany. Because Brittany is Jess’s trainer, and the problem with that is that Brittany doesn’t like training people, even though she gets paid extra to do it. Jess has been telling me that Britney is fine when they are out at a party, but as soon as they are working, she is terrible. She treats her like she doesn’t know what she’s doing, which she doesn’t obviously, she’s being trained to do the job and so she doesn’t know what she’s doing, obviously, and will even go as far as laughing at her in front of people when she is trying to do her job and fails miserably because she isn’t being trained properly. Also about this job, she had interned there the entire summer and had gotten close to one of the guys who we will call Jack, they had a bit of a falling out after her internship was over for reasons that I am not gonna disclose just because it’s her business to share not mine. However, they are OK now. Now, Brittany apparently has had a crush on Jack this entire time. And I think that that is part of the reason why she is such a dick when they’re working. She will also talk to Jack when he comes into the room, where Jess is being trained, and Britney will chat it up with him, but as soon as Jess chimes in, she gets mad snaps at her and tells her to get back to work. Oh, and did I mention that Jack is MARRIED!?  Granted his wife did recently cheat on him and they are practically separated, but that is besides the point.

This has been going on for a couple months now. She will go to work, get treated like absolute crap then come home to me and complain about the way she’s getting treated, and then we’ll go out to a party with her like nothing ever happened. (Sorry, I forgot to mention that we live together) about a month and a half ago, Jess mentioned that she had been invited to go to Florida with Brittany and all her friends. She didn’t tell me much about the planning, but I obviously wasn’t invited because those are her friends not mine. She didn’t tell me much of the planning, but I figured that it was because she didn’t know. Then about two weeks ago, she told me that it was going to only be Britney and her as a birthday trip for her birthday since her birthday was early February. Since if the trip was for her birthday I figured that she would want me (her best friend)and her sisters, and maybe some of her family to go, but no, it is only her and Britney. They left Last Thursday and haven’t come back yet, they were only supposed to be there for a week, but are staying an extra day for some made up excuse that she told her parents. How do I know it’s a made up excuse? Because she said it was for the weather. They’re in freaking Florida.

She has not texted, nor called me the entire time she has been there, I have texted her a couple times to have no response, and I have called her three times. She only answered twice, one time she was drunk, and the other time I called to let her know that I had gotten a new job and while she did say, she was excited and proud of me, she also wanted to get off the phone less than five minutes in because she wanted to go into the water, but would call me later to talk about it (spoiler:she never did) I can’t help but feel lied to about the trip she was going on, and I also can’t help it feel that I was intentionally left out because she just wanted to go off with Brittany because she is more important to her right now. Ever since she broke up with her boyfriend (he was extremely abusive and toxic, and had her wrapped around him, they dated for 3 years before she left him) last November, she has constantly been overworking herself, over partying, and not taking any room to breathe. She says she’s doing fine, and there’s nothing wrong, but I can obviously tell that she is hurting. I don’t feel like that excuses her treating me like I’m unimportant and like everyone and everything else is and more interesting and more exciting while I am just her backup choice.

Every year on her birthday and for Christmas I try to make it special. I try to get her everything that she wants decorate our entire house and get her a birthday party worthy of her. Yes I always get her multiple presents and spend too much money but to myself I always say that it’s worth it because it’s going to her. And I don’t care about not getting birthday presents or Christmas presents, but she has not gotten me a birthday present in probably five years. This year was the first Christmas in a while that she has actually gotten me a present/presents. For my birthday,she always says that either the party she throws me is my present (she’s thrown me like 3 parties), or the alcohol that she got for me for the party is my present, or she is going to get me something,She just ran out of time. But she never actually follows through. This past Christmas. She got me two books, some paint and a Xbox gift card. Which I Love and appreciate her for, but I got her a lot more. Which I’m trying to not sound ungrateful because I am. I understand that money is tight and I understand that I probably shouldn’t have spent as much on Christmas as I do, but after Christmas, she realized the difference in our presents and said that she was going to go out and get me more stuff which I love her for and I told her that that’s not needed, but she insisted, and never actually followed through with. And this happens all the time with anything that has to do with me. If it’s about her, she follows through perfectly with no hiccups, but anything that comes to do with me, never actually gets done. I have heard multiple years that she is always going to plan the day on my birthday and we’re gonna go do something special and we’re gonna do all this stuff because she hasn’t celebrated me in past years, and she feels bad,but it never actually gets done. I always spend my birthday either at home alone or going shopping by myself.I just feel like I I do a lot more for her than what I receive.

Now yesterday I talked to her sisters and her mom, and they all think that it is really shitty that she left me out of her trip and they described our relationship as me being willing to get hit by a bus or take a bullet for her and her not being willing to do the same. Now in the past, we have had issues with her sisters, spreading rumors about her and stuff like that but the way they were talking made me think that they were being genuinely empathetic. They told me that she is a very selfish person and that she uses her friends as a convenience. The way her oldest sister said it was that I’m convenient when she wants to go to target or get coffee or something like that and Brittany is convenient when she wants to go on trips and wants to go to parties and stuff like that. Which I can honestly see. All day today, I have  thought back on our interactions and our friendship and all I’ve been thinking about is that when it has to do with her and what she’s doing she will talk about it endlessly but as soon as I bring up anything that has to revolve around me, she’ll let me talk for a bit, but then I’m assuming she’ll get bored and then she’ll cut in and start talking about herself again.

All I can think about is that if I went off to on a trip by myself how I would be calling and texting her multiple times a day to let her know what I’m doing and to show her pictures and stuff, but that would never even happen because if I would go on a trip, I wouldn’t wanna go unless she was coming with me. So I just don’t know if I am as good of a friend in her eyes as she is to me. I know this was very very long, but please give me advice if you can, I love her and I don’t wanna lose her friendship, but I just don’t know how to fix the way I feel. Also feel free to call me crazy in the comments lol in case I am being crazy. Thank you for your time potatoes.🥔 🫡",0,1771601269.0,Advice,4,0.33,False

1r9yb4h,https://i.redd.it/f64tnrpy3okg1.jpeg,23M Seeking to vibe with new pals around the globe,"Hello internet people. Makin friends through these means is kinda fun for meand I’ve been lucky enough to make friends form here that stays in touch with me for a long time. That’s why I wanna try this again. But since i’m diving back here, something feels off and people are pointing out about bots and dead internet. So let’s see if I can get real human to be friends with me, lol.

So here’s a quick intro:

Call me Felix, I’m a human person of 23 years old. I’m based in Southeast Asia and currently living a post-event crash because I finally finished my long overdue andergrad thesis that took me an extra 1 and a half years in college. It certainly an experience juggling and wrestling with a massive destination branding project, a spicy mix of clinical depression, and way too many sleepless nights.

I’m here looking for dem random chaos of talking to people who live a completely different life from across the globe. Exchanging experience from mundane dailies to niches, what it’s like living there. No expectations, no pressures, just be you. Quick disclaimer, I'm in a healthy open relationship with my man (I also met him this way, can you believe that!?). Some who vibes with me sticks around, but I’m not against a quick chat ofc, that's where the chaos is. Online pals of mine I’ve met stills regularly catching up with me, daily, monthly, maybe next year it doesn’t matter. It’s nice to know that people still catch up to you after long time. Sometime we just shares silly stuff and random pics from daily commutes, I always find it fascinating how different live from even the next border could be different from mine. So wherever you’re from, when we can ping-pong eachother’s while taking things unseriously, we might vibe vibe.

Quick intro end, long ahh brainfarts ahead:

Right now I’m a soon-to-graduate design student after a five and a half year there. WOWWWWOWW?! Five and a half year?! Yes, where I’m from, doiing a final project+undergrad thesis is a requerement to graduate. I heard it called captsone project in english term. A paper and project culmination of my studies for the last 4 years as an undergrad. Mine is apparently too much for a single person to handle but what the heck I did it, BY MY OWN, a whole ass destination branding project that could be a project for a whole studio. BUT I FINALLY DID IT!. Submitted my final paper last week and the other shenanigans requirement. The output is pretty satisfactory atleast for my stnadard. I can show you some of my final exhibition display if you like.

I’ve been in the trenches of mental healths for a long time and just recently it crawled back out after awhile. I though I had it all until things hits me, I gotta live with this forever. But, hey, there’s nothing I can’t do. I made it this far might es well keep it going. I don’t like this vibe but i’m getting rid o fit slowly though meds and therapy and healthy living again bit by bit. I got lonely very often because of that, like dreading lonelyness, even though I’m surounded by many great irl. I find this as one of my escapism and end up with many great online conenction.I find comforts in talking to new people online and listening to their mudnane daily life, their interest, their hyperfixations, tell me wht’s the weather is like or what you’r next cup of coffee order will be. We might be a long term friends or maybe um uhh bromance cough.

As for the pals I made, I found one who loves writing and giving me long replies making it feels like a pen-pal-esque, one who loves collecting fossils around his town, one who loves hiking around in local spots, one who just living the Cali life, a few more, and one bf whose trying 3d modelling. To my surprise for friends I made o non reddit, they’re great! I wish to find more so maybe you’re next? Idk let’s see.

We can play 20 questions and ask eachother random ahh question to keep the convo going, I find it silly and fun way to get to know people quickly. Or maybe we already have common interest if you wanna check the board I mad ein my profile. I try I best to condence what i’ve been obsessed over my live lol.

Wanna tryna skipp the small talks? Dm me with “Panda” so I know you’re a real person and not just the dead internet bot and you actually put time to read through this long ahh brainfarts and actually interested to vibe. Tell me your go to snacks or coffe order, tell me your last game or movie you wathced that got you hooked. I’m a better listener than talker so feel free to share more, but you’ll find out if we clicks if I share and talk more than you 👉👈. The more you tell me about yourself, the more you'll know about me. Let’s vibe.

1r9yaqp,https://v.redd.it/30velgtr3okg1,Simplify Brewer Review + How I Brew Luminous,"Six months or so, I stumbled onto a brewer called the Simplify brewer - which claimed to be an easy button one center pour and walk away design. It was inexpensive and it took standard Kalita 185 filters, so I gave it a whirl - albeit with low expectations. 

Using it with clean washed coffee, when dialed in properly, provided surprisingly pleasant cups of coffee and I did find it delivers on most of its claims. The main divergence for me, is their instruction of one center pour - which I found provided insufficient agitation unless grinds were fine enough to compromise clarity. I found starting off with circular pours to more evenly agitate and soak the bed, and finishing with a center pour, as demonstrated in the video, worked best for me. Still extremely easy and low effort.  

While this brewer doesn’t produce my favorite cups of the clean washed coffees I typically drink, I did find that surprisingly this became my favorite brewer for processed and co-ferments. The less aggressive extractions really clean up and tame process forward coffees and present them in a way I personally prefer, and find more approachable. 

Overall - it’s a neat product that is simple to use, and depending on what you’re looking for in cup, might just be an easy button for you.  At $30, it’s certainly a premium over a V60, and it isn’t a silver bullet - but it sure does make surprisingly good coffee, and downright great (for me) cups of processed coffees and serves as an appreciated tool in my arsenal.

1r9yaiv,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1r9yaiv/i_made_an_ai_trip_planner_that_helps_you_craft/,I made an AI Trip planner that helps you CRAFT your trip rather than lock you into the AI suggestions.,"Hey all,

I wanted to create an app that helped you find things to do for simple daily outings or large overseas trips and I wanted it to be simple to find and refine options by asking a simple prompt like ""Catch up with my friend for coffee on Tuesday"" and from there you're given a full list of things to do as well as things to consider to make the trip as smooth as possible.

With the AI prompt what you get is a great starting point to explore your options to be able to start working out what will work and what won't, what tickles your fancy and what to tweak or remove.

As I worked on the app what it eventually became was a rapid planner that factored in other aspects of your trip that you might want to consider, such as an overview of what the weather would be like around the date of your trip, location of the points of interest, different modes of transport so you know how to get there, how long it will take to get there as well as estimated travel costs. It helps you plan a budget by finding things that fit inside a certain cost range, it finds reviews, video guides and other media relevant to the points of interest.

From there you can use the quick suggestions section to add other aspects of the trip as you see fit to help you craft a trip that suits your wants and needs.

What I've described is just a brief overview of what you can do with it and the idea is to keep exploring what makes a good planner to help travelers discover fun and exciting places in a super simple way while giving them a robust tool to quickly refine and change on the fly.

There's definitely more features that I didn't touch on like the Itinerary overview which shows you a suggested itinerary from the get go that you can then adjust, confirm activities and bookings, uploaded booking details and keep track of your entire trip from.

My aim is to make an 'AI' planner that doesn't force you into doing what the AI wants but to simply offer suggestions that you can then expand on to assist you in crafting a memorable trip and to make it a smoother experience.

The UI and functionality are still pretty rough but I really hope it helps people and would love to get feedback so I can keep making it as good as it can be.",1,1771601177.0,SideProject,2,1.0,False
1r9ya88,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1r9ya88/confused/,confused,"me and this girl were longtime instagram mutuals. in november I decided to get her number. we texted for a couple of weeks and the chemistry was great (she even drove from DC to Baltimore to try to see me) but eventually she stopped responding one day and I took that as she wasn't interested anymore or was dealing with someone else. then over the next two months she messages me or replies to one of my IG stories at least every week, I was still mad about the ghosting but at the top of this month I messaged her and asked if she wanted to get coffee and she said yes. I met her finally and the date went great. we met at 11. we went to 4 spots (she paid for the last spot) and we literally talked and vibed the whole 6-7 hours. we talked about liking alot of the same things at towards the end she was venting to me about things she went through and some current stuff her parents are going through and I just rubbed her knee and let her get it out. and when I left the last spot around 6 to go to the train she gave me a long hug and then while still holding her she asked me if I wanted to kiss her and I said yeah and she blushed and said not on the first date giggling so I made a joke and said ""on the second date for sure tho?"" then I gave her a kiss on the cheek. after that she walked me to the train and gave me another long hug and I kissed her forehead before I left. I got the vibe that I could've kissed her right there but I was chillin. she did make like a excited noise when I kissed her forehead tho. while we were on a date I locked in another date to see the wizards on the 22nd and she put it in her calendar. the next day after the date we are texting normally and she sends me a picture that she took of me as a meme. I'm at work busy so I cant look right away and then 30 minutes later I get a text that says ""damn okay that's crazy"" I text her back that I'm at work and it's busy but my bad. then I asked her if she watched he game and she responded she went to sleep I asked her how her day was going and never got a response. that weds I hit her up to confirm the wizards game move because I'm buying the tickets and she responded excited and shows me she's putting it in her calendar and sent her email over to transfer. after I transfered the tickets I asked her how her day was going and she never replied. at this point I'm thinking she just doesn't like small talk but she was great in person so I'm not tripping. after that I send her another message on valentine's day and she responds excited and wishes me a happy day too. now on this Wednesday at noon I message her ""looking forward to Sunday ☺️"" and as of right now I still haven't received a reply from her. meanwhile she's posting stories on Instagram every day since I sent that message she even has me in her close friends (I haven't watched any stories because she's been muted since November). I feel like sending another message to her is pointless right now and the ticket is already in her email and I can't get it back. I already made accommodations so I'm going to the game on Sunday regardless. I obviously like this girl and want to go out with her still but I'm confused on what her deal is ",1,1771601159.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

We just had 42 people show up to the Belmont Billiards meetup this week. Several told me they'd been lurking in the Discord for weeks before finally showing up. Some almost didn't come at all.

By the end people were exchanging numbers, making plans. A few stopped me on their way out just to say how glad they were they came. Since then the chat has been popping.

That shift is real. It happens every single time, and we're coming back in March for the next one.

***

# **BLOOM is our spring meetup – March 12, 7–11pm at The Brightside.**

There's a tree at the center of it. A physical installation we're building right now with artists from our own Discord community. Add an intention to it during the night – a habit you're building, a risk you're finally ready to take, whatever's been sitting in the back of your head. It's anonymous and totally optional. Just a cool thing to do when inspiration strikes.

Card games and Super Smash Bros Melee running all night. Full bar plus NA options. Pastel spring color clothes are encouraged but wear what feels right.

***

# [Save your spot – RSVP here](https://luma.com/4lnxrr81)

**RSVP takes 15 seconds. Just your name and email, no account needed.** 

It helps us have a headcount so we can better plan. It also helps you - you'll get a reminder before the event. If you're not 100% sure you can make it, RSVP anyway. Bring friends, a partner, whoever. Just grab extra spots.

***

# **If you get nervous about showing up to things like this, you're not alone.**

A lot of people who come to these start out convinced their people don't exist in Dayton. They do. They're just scattered.

If you've been wanting to get out more and you're tired of the same Thursday night on your couch – just come.

Worst case, you grab a drink and dip early. Best case, you find people you actually vibe with. You never know what saying hi to one stranger could lead to. I met my best friend at the first meetup we did in 2010 and it changed my life.

See y'all there 🌸

# [RSVP for BLOOM here](https://luma.com/4lnxrr81)

# **Join the** r/Dayton **Discord**

All of this is being organized in the r/Dayton Discord - 1,500+ locals, running daily. Book clubs, D&D campaigns, hiking crews, weekly trivia groups, bad art nights, last-minute coffee meetups. People who are into the same weird stuff you are. 
The tree design is literally being built there right now if you want in on that. 

Say hey in #introduce-yourself when you join – drop your name, neighborhood, and what you're into. Show up to the next event already knowing a few faces.

I used to work in a supermarket when I was 18 and I worked in theater in college. I haven’t been able to hold onto a job since. I worked retail for 3 months and they paid me under minimum wage because it was cash and they kept lying to me that they would give me a raise (so I quit). I did some dog walking, but it was really rough on my joints (EDS) and I don’t have the physical strength anymore.

All I ever dreamed of when I was little is becoming financially independent and getting away from my family. I went no contact with my father in 2017 and never looked back. I am low contact with my sister. My mother entirely financially supports me. I know I am so so lucky to have someome who can/will do that. She is litterally paying for me to stay away from her. She no longer pretends she cares. She openly doesn’t want me around. She openly hate my autistic traits, and she favors my sister.

She is a narc, a mild one, but still. I don’t know ANYTHING about her finances and it makes me incredibly anxious. I don’t know how much money she or my step father makes, how much is set aside for me or ahything. She is very unpredictable about what she is willing to spend money on. Seemingly it is always more…aesthetics or things she deems important not what I care about. To give persepctive—she won’t even let me thrift funiture and it is an argument for wayfair because it’s “too cheap”. I wouldn’t say she is rich but certainly upper middle class.

She gets mad everytime I spend money on my hobbies (I knit and sew). She has ALWAYS talked shit about my hobbies unless she want something from me. Then suddenly it’s “make a quilt for me” “make a hat and scarf in 2 weeks”. While I understand that it is her money, she can afford it (I don’t spend much and it is litterally the only “fun” thing I spend on, no coffee shops, no vacations, no concerts). What does she expect me to do all day? I’m bored. I have no one to talk to, no where to go, nothing to do, and she is upset that I actually find one thing to do that isn’t just housework basic life maintenence. And no it isn’t because she thinks I should be working, she talks down to me and tells me I’m incapable and sabotages any chances I have at getting external money or connections.

I’m terrified that her money will run out when I get older and I don’t know what to do. I will likely get all of it (my sister has cystic fibrosis so doesn’t have great long term survival) I feel like I could kill my health more if I do try to work, but in the future I could be forced to work out of necessity and I would have no safety net.",3,1771601097.0,AutismInWomen,5,0.8,False

1r9y8fu,https://tipstor.com/the-swiss-chocolate-express-in-zurich-switzerland/,"The Swiss Chocolate Express in Zurich, Switzerland","Zurich runs with polished precision most days, but the Swiss Chocolate Express turns the city into the starting line of a journey built for sweet obsession and alpine scenery. The train glides out of town with quiet confidence, threading through green valleys and storybook villages on its way to the temples of Swiss confectionery. This is not simply a tasting tour. It is a full sensory expedition into the craft that made Switzerland the global heavyweight of smooth, silk like chocolate.

The best season to ride falls between late May and early October when the countryside is vivid green and the mountain views arrive crisp and unobstructed through wide train windows. Winter adds its own magic with snow covered peaks and cozy tasting rooms, but the warmer months allow travelers to combine the chocolate pilgrimage with serious outdoor adventure. Hiking trails fan out across the nearby foothills, offering panoramic views of the Alps and encounters with native wildlife such as red deer, alpine ibex, marmots, and golden eagles riding thermal currents. Cycling routes along Lake Zurich deliver long scenic stretches ideal for working up an appetite before the next round of tasting.

The train eventually delivers its passengers to the legendary Maison Cailler and the immersive wonderland of the Lindt Home of Chocolate, where chocolate fountains flow with theatrical confidence and tasting rooms operate with cheerful generosity. Visitors move through interactive exhibits that explain how Swiss chocolatiers refined techniques like conching to produce the famously smooth texture that changed the global standard. The experience becomes deliciously hands on, with samples ranging from delicate milk chocolate to bold dark varieties layered with nuts and fruit.

Food and drink play their supporting roles with equal enthusiasm. Fresh alpine milk, the quiet hero behind Swiss chocolate’s creamy profile, appears in tastings and café menus throughout the journey. Local bakeries in Zurich tempt travelers with buttery croissants and chocolate filled pastries, while traditional Swiss restaurants nearby serve hearty rösti, fondue, and seasonal alpine dishes that balance the sugar rush with savory comfort. Coffee culture here runs deep and precise, making every café stop feel intentional.

Saving money on this indulgent route comes down to classic Swiss strategy. Plan ahead and travel smart. Booking rail passes in advance often reduces transportation costs significantly, and visiting Maison Cailler and the Lindt attraction on weekday mornings can mean lighter crowds and occasional promotional pricing. Staying in Zurich’s well connected outer neighborhoods instead of the historic center trims accommodation costs while keeping the train network within easy reach. Many hiking trails, lake promenades, and scenic viewpoints remain completely free, allowing travelers to balance premium chocolate experiences with budget friendly outdoor exploration.

The Swiss Chocolate Express delivers a journey that feels both playful and expertly engineered, where every curve of track leads deeper into the country’s proud confectionery heritage. It pairs alpine air with molten chocolate, scenic rail travel with hands on tasting, and physical adventure with unapologetic indulgence. Zurich may provide the departure platform, but the real destination is that moment when perfectly tempered chocolate melts smoothly on the tongue while the Alps stand quietly in the distance, approving of the entire delicious enterprise.

I can't believe that people can drink so much coffee or tea or any beverage for that matter on those long ass mugs. Some people have stacks of these sitting at home that they almost never use. Also ceramic is just fragile. I hate this one in general since it looks bland and boring.

1r9y7jp,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarketingMentor/comments/1r9y7jp/how_would_you_build_a_fanbase_for_a_fictional/,How would you build a fanbase for a fictional character on social media? (Transmedia project with existing content),"I'm working on a transmedia sci-fi project called Dakota Reign - about an AI pop star who becomes sentient and joins a rebellion against the corporation that created her. Think Westworld meets the music industry.

**Where I'm at:**

* Full 10-song album completed (ties directly to the storyline)
* Deep storyline developed (graphic novel and audiobook in production)
* Clear vision: Phase 1 is graphic novel + audiobook, long-term goal is TV series
* Previously posted some content (vague teaser stuff for song drops) but realized I was doing it backwards

**What happened:** I started posting before I had the full story figured out. I was building anticipation but didn't have a solid foundation. So I took a step back, developed the actual storyline properly, and now I'm ready to do this RIGHT.

**My question:** Now that I have real content and a complete story, how do I build a fanbase for Dakota as a character using social media?

**Specifically:**

1. **Where do I start?** Do I relaunch with ""here's who Dakota is"" or build mystery again? Do I acknowledge the previous posts or treat this as a fresh start?
2. **What platform should I prioritize?** TikTok seems obvious for character content, but I already have some scattered presence there.
3. **Content strategy:** Should I be posting:
   * In-character content (as Dakota)
   * Story/world lore drops
   * Music from the album with context
   * ""Behind the scenes"" creator content
   * Some mix of all of the above?
   * **One idea I'm considering:** Content showing Dakota experiencing ""human things"" for the first time now that she's actually sentient - like trying coffee, feeling rain, or misunderstanding idioms and social cues (imagine an AI taking ""break a leg"" literally). Basically exploring what it means to be newly conscious in a human world. Would this type of character-moment content work to build connection, or is it too niche without people already caring about her?
4. **Pacing:** I have a graphic novel and audiobook coming. Do I build audience NOW and maintain momentum until launch, or wait until closer to release?
5. **How do I avoid ""nobody cares about your OC"" syndrome?** What makes people actually invest in a fictional character they've never heard of?

**What makes this different from typical ""promote my book"" situations:**

* This isn't just a book - it's a character-driven universe designed for expansion (music, graphic novel, audiobook, eventual series)
* I already have transmedia assets (full album, developed world, visual identity)
* I'm thinking long-term IP, not one-off project

**Context about Dakota's story:** She was created as the world's biggest AI pop star, completely controlled by a corporation. Something causes her to ""awaken"" - gaining genuine consciousness and free will. The story follows her journey from that awakening into rebellion.

**Constraints:**

* Super minimal budget (bootstrapped)
* 2-person team
* Very small existing following (\~40-50 followers each on TikTok and Instagram)

**If you were handed this project - existing album, developed story, character ready to go - what would your 90-day social media strategy look like?**

1r9y74k,https://www.reddit.com/r/AI_travel_tips/comments/1r9y74k/i_made_an_ai_trip_planner_that_helps_you_craft/,I made an AI Trip planner that helps you CRAFT your trip rather than lock you into the AI suggestions.,"Hey all,

I wanted to create an app that helped you find things to do for simple daily outings or large overseas trips and I wanted it to be simple to find and refine options by asking a simple prompt like ""Catch up with my friend for coffee on Tuesday"" and from there you're given a full list of things to do as well as things to consider to make the trip as smooth as possible. 

With the AI prompt what you get is a great starting point to explore your options to be able to start working out what will work and what won't, what tickles your fancy and what to tweak or remove.

As I worked on the app what it eventually became was a rapid planner that factored in other aspects of your trip that you might want to consider, such as an overview of what the weather would be like around the date of your trip, location of the points of interest, different modes of transport so you know how to get there, how long it will take to get there as well as estimated travel costs. It helps you plan a budget by finding things that fit inside a certain cost range, it finds reviews, video guides and other media relevant to the points of interest. 

From there you can use the quick suggestions section to add other aspects of the trip as you see fit to help you craft a trip that suits your wants and needs.

What I've described is just a brief overview of what you can do with it and the idea is to keep exploring what makes a good planner to help travelers discover fun and exciting places in a super simple way while giving them a robust tool to quickly refine and change on the fly.

There's definitely more features that I didn't touch on like the Itinerary overview which shows you a suggested itinerary from the get go that you can then adjust, confirm activities and bookings, uploaded booking details and keep track of your entire trip from.

My aim is to make an 'AI' planner that doesn't force you into doing what the AI wants but to simply offer suggestions that you can then expand on to assist you in crafting a memorable trip and to make it a smoother experience.

The UI and functionality are still pretty rough but I really hope it helps people and would love to get feedback so I can keep making it as good as it can be.",1,1771600965.0,AI_travel_tips,1,1.0,False
1r9y6tw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Moccamaster/comments/1r9y6tw/new_style_thermal_carafe_2025_manufacture_kbgt/,New style thermal carafe (2025 manufacture KBGT machine),"I just got my first Moccamaster and was a little frustrated as I was doing my research.  I was getting a lot of mixed information on the thermal carafe style/manufacture, so I thought I'd share my thoughts.

Some of the older carafes are all stainless (inside and out).  I've seen pour videos and they look a little crazy... coffee pouring out of 1/3 of the cap that is mostly funneled (but not 100%) via a lip to a pouring area and then into the cup.  YouTube has lots of videos of this full stainless style of carafe.

The newer style (as I understand it) is a glass-lined thermal carafe.  This is what I got in my new KBGT.  When I was researching, I stumbled across the 2 different carafe types and had to do some digging to confirm that my new KBGT would be glass lined (what I wanted).  I believe that the consensus is that the glass one has a cleaner taste (less likely to retain odors from things other than coffee and possible metallic tang from the stainless liner) but it trades off some fragility (glass liner can break).

It catches some folks off-guard:  This is a relatively new 'midnight' series unit where the brewer body and the carafe are a nice matte black (the carafe is not the normal stainless).

Some notes on the glass-lined carafe after week 1 of use:

1. I'm SUPER happy that I've got the newer style that pours more neatly.  It's a pretty small flow, but it's well organized and focused.
2. I'm loving the lip on this carafe.  I took a detail shot and you can see a very crisp, double-layered edge right at the pour lip.  This has provided NO drips down the front side of the carafe under the pour spout.  I have been keeping the carafe on my raw wood desk top and have no worries about drips/rings under the carafe.  It is super clean!

Makin friends through these means is kinda fun for meand I’ve been lucky enough to make friends form here that stays in touch with me for a long time. That’s why I wanna try this again. But since i’m diving back here, something feels off and people are pointing out about bots and dead internet. So let’s see if I can get real human to be friends with me, lol.

So here’s a quick intro:

Call me Felix, I’m a human person of 23 years old. I’m based in Southeast Asia and currently living a post-event crash because I finally finished my long overdue andergrad thesis that took me an extra 1 and a half years in college. It certainly an experience juggling and wrestling with a massive destination branding project, a spicy mix of clinical depression, and way too many sleepless nights.

I’m here looking for dem random chaos of talking to people who live a completely different life from across the globe. Exchanging experience from mundane dailies to niches, what it’s like living there. No expectations, no pressures, just be you. Quick disclaimer, I'm in a healthy open relationship with my man (I also met him this way, can you believe that!?). Some who vibes with me sticks around, but I’m not against a quick chat ofc, that's where the chaos is. Online pals of mine I’ve met stills regularly catching up with me, daily, monthly, maybe next year it doesn’t matter. It’s nice to know that people still catch up to you after long time. Sometime we just shares silly stuff and random pics from daily commutes, I always find it fascinating how different live from even the next border could be different from mine. So wherever you’re from, when we can ping-pong eachother’s while taking things unseriously, we might vibe vibe.

Stop here for quick intro, here’s my long ahh braindumb:

Right now I’m a soon-to-graduate design student after a five and a half year there. WOWWWWOWW?! Five and a half year?! Yes, where I’m from, doiing a final project+undergrad thesis is a requerement to graduate. I heard it called captsone project in english term. A paper and project culmination of my studies for the last 4 years as an undergrad. Mine is apparently too much for a single person to handle but what the heck I did it, BY MY OWN, a whole ass destination branding project that could be a project for a whole studio. BUT I FINALLY DID IT!. Submitted my final paper last week and the other shenanigans requirement. The output is pretty satisfactory atleast for my stnadard. I can show you some of my final exhibition display if you like.

I’ve been in the trenches of mental healths for a long time and just recently it crawled back out after awhile. I though I had it all until things hits me, I gotta live with this forever. But, hey, there’s nothing I can’t do. I made it this far might es well keep it going. I don’t like this vibe but i’m getting rid o fit slowly though meds and therapy and healthy living again bit by bit. I got lonely very often because of that, like dreading lonelyness, even though I’m surounded by many great irl. I find this as one of my escapism and end up with many great online conenction.I find comforts in talking to new people online and listening to their mudnane daily life, their interest, their hyperfixations, tell me wht’s the weather is like or what you’r next cup of coffee order will be. We might be a long term friends or maybe um uhh bromance cough.

As for the pals I made, I found one who loves writing and giving me long replies making it feels like a pen-pal-esque, one who loves collecting fossils around his town, one who loves hiking around in local spots, one who just living the Cali life, a few more, and one bf whose trying 3d modelling. To my surprise for friends I made o non reddit, they’re great! I wish to find more so maybe you’re next? Idk let’s see.

We can play 20 questions and ask eachother random ahh question to keep the convo going, I find it silly and fun way to get to know people quickly. Or maybe we already have common interest if you wanna check the board I mad ein my profile. I try I best to condence what i’ve been obsessed over my live lol.

Wanna tryna skipp the small talks? Dm me with “Panda” so I know you’re a real person and not just the dead internet bot and you actually put time to read through this long ahh brainfarts and actually interested to vibe. Tell me your go to snacks or coffe order, tell me your last game or movie you wathced that got you hooked. I’m a better listener than talker so feel free to share more, but you’ll find out if we clicks if I share and talk more than you 👉👈. The more you tell me about yourself, the more you'll know about me. Let’s vibe.

Here’s how I’m trying to fix the operational leaks:

* **Zero App Download:** Uupo lang yung customer, scan the QR on the table, order on their browser, and pay.
* **Pay-to-Release Workflow:** Wala nang unpaid orders. Hindi magre-reflect o papasok yung ticket sa iPad/Tablet ng kusina hangga't hindi verified ang payment. 
* **Multi-Branch Ready:** Isang centralized admin dashboard lang to manage the menu, track peak hours, and view real-time sales across 10 or 100 branches simultaneously.
* **Speed:** It collapses the usual 3-5minute ordering bottleneck into a \~30-second seamless process. Faster ordering = faster table turnover.

No heavy POS hardware required din. It's built on a serverless cloud architecture (React + Firebase), so any existing tablet or screen can act as the KDS.

Naghahanap ako ngayon ng mga independent cafe owners or restaurant operators na open mag-pilot test nito sa store nila (completely free for the first few partners, I just really need real-world stress testing and honest feedback).

We recently did a survey with roasters about how rising costs are affecting their businesses, and what kinds of tradeoffs (if any) they are making to stay afloat.

Posting the full story below.

Green coffee prices have gone through extreme ups and downs over the last few years. 

Spurred in part [by extreme weather events](https://apnews.com/article/coffee-prices-tariffs-climate-3503a37a8fc95b7dc5a1f29747c81e27) in major coffee-producing countries, such as Brazil and Vietnam, green coffee prices soared by 40% in 2024. In 2025, costs rose further still as climate impacts [collided with low inventory and tariffs](https://freshcup.com/coffee-prices-up-people-switching-to-home-brewing-and-budget-friendly-beans/). And now, in 2026, prices remain so high that many coffee companies have been forced to fundamentally change how they do business.

Consumers are feeling the squeeze, too. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the [average retail price](https://apnews.com/article/coffee-prices-tariffs-climate-3503a37a8fc95b7dc5a1f29747c81e27) of a pound of ground coffee reached $9.14 in September 2025—up 41% from the same month the previous year. The broader consumer price index shows coffee prices up 19% year over year, even as overall food inflation has cooled.

For many coffee businesses, the impact of such prices now reaches well beyond a line item on a balance sheet. Margins were already tight before prices shot up; now, there’s limited room left to absorb higher costs—and limited ability to pass them on to customers—without making difficult trade-offs.

To better understand how businesses are navigating these increases, Fresh Cup sent a poll to roasters across the country in November 2025. We pulled together the most salient responses from 13 different businesses that reveal exactly how roasters are adapting their sourcing, pricing, and daily operations—all without alienating their customers in the process.

# Margin Pressure and the Risk of Passing Costs Along

The roasters that we polled report increases in green coffee costs ranging from roughly 17.5% to as high as 75%, with a median increase of around 50%. 

In response, several roasters describe having to walk a narrow line between raising prices and maintaining customer loyalty. At [C&S Coffee Roasters](http://www.cscoffeeroasters.com/) in Forest Park, Illinois, chief operating officer Peter Deo says its green coffee costs have gone up by 50% over the past year. When those changes reach customers, he says, even modest price increases can begin to affect demand. 

“As with any product, as costs to the consumer rise, the consumption decreases,” Deo says. “Traditionally, the consumer might switch to lower-quality coffee, but in this market, there is not a big difference anymore between the costs associated with quality levels. We have seen a decline in consumption just in the last few months alone.”

Many coffee sellers say it’s been hard to pass along the full increase in costs to their customers. Matt Marietti, president of [De Fer Coffee & Tea](https://www.defer.coffee/) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, says its green coffee costs are up roughly 70%, which has forced the company to raise prices on retail coffee and beverages, though those increases don’t fully offset the added costs.

“We’re not able to pass all of that increase along, or we’ll lose so many customers that we’ll go out of business,” Marietti says. “So we’re compressing our already-tight margins and trying to increase prices in lock step with our peers so that, again, we don’t move first and lose customers to everyone else.”

As prices rise, competition for lower-cost, high-quality coffee has intensified, leaving fewer options that meet both quality and price expectations, he adds. 

Several roasters note that rising costs are hitting at the same time as slower sales, squeezing margins from both directions.. When volume drops, any price increases become even harder to absorb. 

# Buying Deeper, Rotating Less

As margins tighten, many roasters said they’re making significant changes behind the scenes, shifting toward sourcing strategies that require more time, labor, and long-term commitment.

Rather than constantly rotating offerings, some roasters are choosing to buy more of the same coffees when they find beans that work for their bottom line. At De Fer, Marietti says the company’s core sourcing values haven’t changed, but its buying strategy has. 

“When we find \[a coffee that works\], we are likely going to buy more of it and keep it around longer,” he says. “The short-term effect of this strategy will be less variety for our customers.”

Multiple roasters describe offering fewer coffees, and keeping them on their menus for longer. [Driven Coffee Roasters](https://www.drivencoffee.com/) in Chanhassen, Minnesota reports that its green coffee cost increases have meant more time and effort spent widening importer relationships to find viable options.

“This leads to increased time chasing coffees, sample roasting, and cupping endlessly to find the diamonds in the rough,” says Erin Halloran, senior account manager at Driven Coffee. “Ultimately, it has been a catalyst to further direct-trade relationships.”

Halloran points to the cumulative operational toll of those decisions. “When you have an ingredient cost rise as quickly and sharply as coffee has, you’re unable to maintain a healthy margin in the short term,” she says. “It puts small businesses in triage mode to correct the product margin through making really tough decisions.”

At [Peaks Coffee Company](https://www.peakscoffeeco.com/) in Syracuse, New York, CEO and owner Samuel Bender says green coffee price increases touch nearly every part of the business. “It affects what we buy, where we buy it from, and how we buy,” Bender says. “It affects our margins. Our team has definitely had to run much tighter this year.”

To protect margins, Peaks has adjusted blend components, including adding robusta to certain products. “We’ve had to add in some robusta for our grocery-style blends, and adjust blend components in other areas to continue to hit a semi-OK return on our product,” Bender says.

For newer roasteries, those decisions can feel even more consequential. Mary Bozzelli, owner at [Armadillo Coffee Roasters](https://armadilloroasters.com/) in Austin, Texas, says green coffee price increases are forcing the company to weigh competitiveness against what the business can realistically absorb.  “We have to decide whether to eat the rising cost to try and stay competitive or increase our price point with the rest of the coffee community,” she says.

Armadillo largely moved away from Brazilian coffee during the period when steep U.S. tariffs made Brazilian imports significantly more [expensive](https://freshcup.com/u-s-scraps-40-brazil-coffee-tariff-after-months-of-chaos/), for instance, even though it had been a staple in some blends. “It’s too bad. We stocked up a little bit before tariffs went through, as some wholesale customers love it,” Bozzelli says. “But we’ve told them to consider other coffees.”

# Wholesale Relationships and the Cost of Consistency

Several roasters say that wholesale customers prioritize consistency, which limits how much they can raise prices, even in the face of rising costs.

At C&S Roasters, Deo says the company offered customers the option to switch to different origins as green coffee became more expensive, but most chose to stick with the same coffees. “The majority of our customers want us to maintain the consistent products that their customers love,” he says. “So no major changes have happened.”

A small number of roasters have avoided the worst of the squeeze, at least so far. These businesses report being better insulated from recent volatility due to long-standing sourcing models and purchasing strategies. At [Torque Coffee](https://torque.coffee/) in San Diego, California, founder Andy Newbom says despite price fluctuations, the company hasn’t raised prices.

“Our entire model is built upon the idea of keeping more money at origin and focusing cost savings on the middle controllable costs,” Newbom says. “So we have a built-in solution to these cost increases.” 

Torque’s sourcing strategy has provided short-term stability. “We are fully booked out for a year with excellent coffee,” he adds.

For many roasters, however, stability has been elusive—particularly given that the current pricing environment is unlikely to ease quickly. Across all 13 survey responses, one takeaway was clear: Rising green coffee costs are already reshaping how roasters source, price, and plan. For most, the work of adaptation is incremental, and largely invisible to customers. But it’s happening now, even as roasters continue to adapt within increasingly tight constraints.",7,1771600633.0,coffee_roasters,0,1.0,False
1r9y181,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/1r9y181/checking_the_phone_for_no_reason/,Checking the phone for no reason.,"I caught myself doing it last Wednesday. Picked up my phone, unlocked it, looked at the screen, put it back down. Nothing had happened. Nobody had messaged me. I hadn't opened an app. I'd just... checked. That the phone was still there, I suppose.

I did it again seven minutes later.

I only noticed because my girlfriend pointed it out. She just watched me do it twice in a row and raised an eyebrow. I got defensive in the way you get defensive when someone catches you doing something you weren't aware you were doing. Told her I was waiting to hear back from someone. I wasn't.

That evening I checked the phone settings. I picked up my phone 94 times between 9am and 10pm. I worked, watched three hours of television, had a conversation, ate dinner. And I picked up my phone 94 times. Each time for about eight seconds. Each time finding nothing, wanting nothing in particular, putting it back down.

The number 94 written on a piece of paper next to my coffee the next morning looked different than it felt the night before. I wrote it down to make it tangible.

I didn't delete any apps that week. I didn't buy a dumb phone or install a blocker. I just started counting. And the counting, by itself, changed something... because you can't watch yourself do a thing 94 times without your brain starting to ask whether you meant to.

Try it now that you are here. Just the counting. Write the number down here. It feels very weird to realize how hooked we are.",3,1771600592.0,nosurf,2,1.0,False
1r9y16c,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_LoveInTheShadow/comments/1r9y16c/waffle_house_is_evil/,Waffle House is Evil,"Back in the day, I was a server at Waffle House. And let me tell you, aside from my FAFO attitude, I really didn't belong there. Every server, every cook, every manager, was just the worst kind of people. 

The worst of all however, was how fucking racist so many of them were. The first shift old ladies? Don't let their sweet elderly smiles deceive you. They did NOT like black people. And they weren't very good at hiding it at the one I worked at. One of the regulars that came in for coffee every morning, he never left more than a handful of coins as a tip because of it.

The third shift I worked, wasn't any better. I remember one night, one of the servers was going around asking other servers to take someone in her section, and she kept getting a no. She finally made her way to me, and I asked her, why don't you want to take him is he some kind of creepy flirt or something, and her answer? No, he's Mexican, they don't tip.

My blood boiled at that answer, so I said yes and took his order. And I treated him the same way I treated every customer I served. Attentive, friendly, genuine smiles, the works. At the end, he tipped me $20 and told me to split it with the other servers. I said oh my gosh, thank you, I'll definitely do that. 

I did not. I kept it all. And when he left, I smiled to the other servers and excitedly exclaimed how I'd gotten a $20 tip. They didn't deserve his kindness, but I wanted to make sure they knew he'd tipped and tipped well, so maybe next time they'd think twice about treating someone differently just because of where they were from or the color of their skin.


Fuck Waffle House.

1r9y0d8,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/1r9y0d8/our_nightmare_with_an_az_private_school_when/,Our nightmare with an AZ private school: When “prestige” protects the wrong people.,"I’m sharing this because I’m still reeling from the discovery that private schools often operate with a level of immunity that public schools simply don’t have. If you are currently looking at private education for your kids, please learn from our experience at Summit School of Ahwatukee.

My daughter’s time there was short and, frankly, traumatic. After we left, I spoke with multiple other parents and realized what I believe to be a systemic issue with bullying and predatory behavior that has been shielded for far too long. In my opinion, money and ""status"" buy immunity at this school. It feels like an administration that is more worried about their reputation than the safety of the children.

The Retaliation

I did what any parent would do: I advocated for my child. The ""consequence"" was my daughter being abruptly expelled late on a Friday night through no fault of her own.

The most heartbreaking part? I later listened to a recording of a head admin telling staff that I was a ""danger"" to the school specifically because I am a military veteran. They were told to call the police if I was even seen near the campus.

I was a combat flight medic. My entire career was about saving lives, not harming them. I was a classroom mom—I brought the coffee, I planned the parties, I volunteered. I never once raised my voice at them; I only cried while trying to protect my kid.

The Legal & Police Involvement

Since the expulsion, I’ve had to deal with what I feel is legal harassment from their lawyers based on false statements. I’ve had to have police escorts just to pick up my daughter’s things and to deliver paperwork for a restraining order against my daughter’s attacker. Shout out to our local PD, who were incredibly empathetic and saw through the school’s narrative immediately.

The Lesson

I’m sharing this because the only way to stop this kind of abuse of power is to talk about it. Private schools often lack the oversight and safety procedures of public or charter schools.

I will never stop fighting for justice for my daughter. If you’re a parent, please: listen to your kids, trust your gut, and don’t let a ""prestigious"" name blind you to what’s happening behind closed doors.

\# Sample Opening (Draft)

He didn’t notice her the first three Tuesdays.

She was just the woman behind the counter — dark hair tied back, sleeves rolled up, smile practiced but not fake. The diner smelled like burnt coffee and fryer oil, and his steel-toed boots left dust near the door every time he came in after shift.

He always sat alone.

She always noticed.

What he didn’t know was that by the time he was falling asleep at nine-thirty, she was someone else entirely — lit by a soft ring light, voice lower, eyes heavier, selling a version of herself that never got tired.

And the two worlds were on a collision course neither of them saw coming.

If this is based on a true story, I need to ask:

\* Is this your story?

\* Do you want it raw and realistic or slightly fictionalized?

\* Do you want the focus more on romance, psychology, or social commentary?

\* Happy ending or not?

1r9xwju,https://www.reddit.com/r/hgh_t/comments/1r9xwju/i_tracked_my_deep_sleep_and_igf1_for_6_months/,I Tracked My Deep Sleep and IGF-1 For 6 Months — Here's the Correlation Nobody Talks About,"Everyone talks about ""getting 8 hours."" Nobody talks about what's happening INSIDE those 8 hours.

I wore an Oura ring and got IGF-1 blood draws every 8 weeks for 6 months straight. What I found changed how I think about sleep, aging, and growth hormone forever.

**The short version:** My deep sleep minutes predicted my IGF-1 levels almost perfectly. Total sleep hours? Barely mattered.

---

## Why I Started Tracking

Age 36. Feeling like I was aging fast. Slow recovery, soft body composition despite training hard, skin looking dull, injuries taking forever to heal.

Got bloodwork done on a whim:

- **IGF-1: 118 ng/mL**
- Reference range for my age: 83-233 ng/mL
- ""Normal"" according to my doctor
- But bottom 20th percentile for a 36-year-old male

Technically ""fine."" Functionally? My growth hormone output was that of a 55-year-old.

I wasn't fine. I just had a doctor reading ranges instead of optimals.

Around the same time, I started wearing an Oura ring. Not because of HGH — just curiosity. But when I looked at my first month of sleep data, something clicked.

My total sleep looked decent. My deep sleep was embarrassing.

---

## The Baseline — Month 0

**Sleep data (Oura, 30-day average):**

| Metric | My Numbers | Optimal Range |
|---|---|---|
| Total sleep | 7h 12m | 7-8h |
| Deep sleep | 38 minutes | 90-120 min |
| REM sleep | 1h 22m | 90-120 min |
| Sleep efficiency | 81% | 85%+ |
| Resting HR | 62 bpm | <60 ideal |
| HRV | 34 ms | 50+ ideal |

**Bloodwork:**

| Marker | Result | Optimal |
|---|---|---|
| IGF-1 | 118 ng/mL | 180-250 ng/mL |
| Fasting glucose | 96 mg/dL | <90 mg/dL |
| Fasting insulin | 9.2 µIU/mL | <5 µIU/mL |
| HbA1c | 5.4% | <5.2% |

Look at that deep sleep number: **38 minutes.**

That's a problem. Here's why.

---

## Why Deep Sleep (Not Total Sleep) Controls Your HGH

Most people think sleep = recovery. That's half the story.

Your sleep has stages, and they do very different things:

- **Light sleep (Stage 1-2):** Basic maintenance. Your body is asleep but not doing heavy repair work.
- **Deep sleep (Stage 3-4, also called slow-wave sleep):** This is where roughly **70-80% of your daily growth hormone is released.** Your pituitary gland fires its biggest GH pulses during these stages. Tissue repair, muscle recovery, fat metabolism, bone density — all peak here.
- **REM sleep:** Brain recovery, memory, cognitive function, testosterone production.

So here's the thing nobody tells you:

**You can sleep 8 hours and get almost ZERO growth hormone benefit if your deep sleep is garbage.**

That was me. 7+ hours in bed. 38 minutes of deep sleep. My pituitary was barely getting the chance to do its job.

### The Science (Layman Version)

Your body releases GH in pulses. The biggest pulse — often 60-70% of your total daily GH output — happens in the first deep sleep cycle of the night, usually within 60-90 minutes of falling asleep.

If that first deep sleep cycle is short, fragmented, or shallow:

- The GH pulse is blunted
- Less GH circulates overnight
- Less IGF-1 is produced by the liver (IGF-1 is essentially your ""GH report card"" — it reflects how much GH your body actually used)
- Recovery, fat burning, and tissue repair all suffer

**IGF-1 doesn't tell you what happened last night. It tells you what's been happening for weeks.** That's what makes it such a good tracking marker. It's the average, not the snapshot.

---

## What I Changed (Month 1-2)

I didn't take a single supplement at first. I just fixed the obvious deep-sleep killers:

### The Big 5 Deep Sleep Fixes

**1. Last meal 3-4 hours before bed**

This was the biggest single change. I was eating dinner at 8:30-9pm, going to bed at 10:30pm. My body was digesting food instead of entering deep sleep.

Shifted dinner to 6:30pm. Deep sleep increased within the first week.

Why: Elevated blood sugar and insulin directly suppress GH release. If insulin is high when you hit your first sleep cycle, that big GH pulse gets blunted or skipped entirely.

**2. Room temperature: 65°F (18°C)**

Was sleeping at ~72°F. Your core body temperature needs to DROP for deep sleep to initiate. A warm room fights this process.

Bought a cheap fan and set the thermostat. Simple.

**3. Zero alcohol**

I was only drinking 2-3 drinks on weekends. Thought it was ""moderate.""

Alcohol absolutely destroys deep sleep architecture. Even 2 drinks 4 hours before bed can cut deep sleep by 20-40%. Your Oura/Whoop data will confirm this brutally — check your deep sleep on nights after even 1-2 drinks vs. sober nights.

I cut alcohol completely for the 6 months.

**4. Magnesium glycinate — 400mg before bed**

Not a ""supplement bro"" recommendation. Magnesium is involved in GABA receptor function, which is the neurotransmitter system that transitions you into deep sleep. Most men are deficient. Glycinate form specifically because it crosses the blood-brain barrier more effectively and doesn't cause GI issues.

**5. Consistent sleep/wake time (±30 minutes)**

10:15pm bed → 6:15am wake. Every single day including weekends.

Your circadian rhythm governs when deep sleep cycles are longest. Irregular sleep times scramble this. Consistency was boring but the data proved it worked.

---

## Month 2 Check-In

**Sleep data (Oura, 30-day average):**

| Metric | Month 0 | Month 2 | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| Total sleep | 7h 12m | 7h 24m | +12 min |
| Deep sleep | 38 min | 72 min | +34 min (+89%) |
| REM sleep | 1h 22m | 1h 31m | +9 min |
| Sleep efficiency | 81% | 87% | +6% |
| Resting HR | 62 bpm | 58 bpm | -4 bpm |
| HRV | 34 ms | 48 ms | +14 ms |

**Bloodwork (8-week draw):**

| Marker | Month 0 | Month 2 | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| IGF-1 | 118 ng/mL | 156 ng/mL | **+38 (+32%)** |
| Fasting glucose | 96 mg/dL | 91 mg/dL | -5 |
| Fasting insulin | 9.2 µIU/mL | 6.8 µIU/mL | -2.4 |

Look at that. Total sleep barely moved (+12 minutes). **Deep sleep nearly doubled.** And IGF-1 jumped 32%.

Also notice: fasting insulin dropped. Less late-night eating = lower baseline insulin = less GH suppression. It's all connected.

The subjective changes were already noticeable:
- Waking up actually feeling rested (hadn't felt this in years)
- Gym recovery improved noticeably — less DOMS, could train harder
- A couple people asked if I'd changed my skincare routine (I hadn't)

---

## Month 2-4: Dialing It In Further

Added a few more things:

**6. 20-minute post-dinner walk**

Brings blood sugar down faster after the evening meal. Means insulin is lower by the time the first deep sleep cycle hits. Oura data showed a direct correlation: lower post-dinner glucose (tracked with a CGM for one month) = more deep sleep that night.

**7. Glycine — 3g before bed**

Research shows glycine lowers core body temperature and may increase time in slow-wave sleep. Cheap amino acid. Added it alongside magnesium. Can't isolate its effect perfectly, but deep sleep trended up another 10-15 minutes in the weeks after adding it.

**8. Morning sunlight — 10-15 minutes within 30 minutes of waking**

This isn't directly about deep sleep. It's about setting the circadian clock so that melatonin release happens at the right time, which sets up the correct sleep architecture. Downstream effect: more organized sleep cycles = longer deep sleep windows.

**9. Cut caffeine after 12pm**

Caffeine has a half-life of 5-6 hours. A 2pm coffee still has 50% of its caffeine active at 7-8pm. Caffeine blocks adenosine, which is one of the drivers of deep sleep pressure. Even if you ""fall asleep fine,"" caffeine reduces deep sleep duration. I moved my cutoff to noon.

---

## Month 4 Check-In

**Sleep data (Oura, 30-day average):**

| Metric | Month 0 | Month 2 | Month 4 | 
|---|---|---|---|
| Total sleep | 7h 12m | 7h 24m | 7h 31m |
| Deep sleep | 38 min | 72 min | 94 min |
| REM sleep | 1h 22m | 1h 31m | 1h 38m |
| Sleep efficiency | 81% | 87% | 91% |
| Resting HR | 62 bpm | 58 bpm | 56 bpm |
| HRV | 34 ms | 48 ms | 58 ms |

**Bloodwork (16-week draw):**

| Marker | Month 0 | Month 2 | Month 4 |
|---|---|---|---|
| IGF-1 | 118 ng/mL | 156 ng/mL | 198 ng/mL |
| Fasting glucose | 96 mg/dL | 91 mg/dL | 87 mg/dL |
| Fasting insulin | 9.2 µIU/mL | 6.8 µIU/mL | 5.1 µIU/mL |

**IGF-1: 118 → 198 ng/mL. A 68% increase in 4 months.**

Deep sleep: 38 → 94 minutes.

Total sleep only increased by 19 minutes total. The magic was in the COMPOSITION of sleep, not the quantity.

At this point the physical changes were undeniable:
- Body composition shifting even without changing diet or training (slightly leaner, more muscular look)
- Recovery was dramatically better — hitting PRs again after a long plateau
- Sleep felt like actual recovery instead of just ""being unconscious for 7 hours""
- Skin quality noticeably different — wife commented on it multiple times
- Minor aches and a nagging shoulder issue were fading

## Month 6 — Final Results

Continued the same protocol. No new additions. Just consistency.

**Sleep data (Oura, 30-day average):**

| Metric | Month 0 | Month 2 | Month 4 | Month 6 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Total sleep | 7h 12m | 7h 24m | 7h 31m | 7h 28m |
| Deep sleep | 38 min | 72 min | 94 min | 102 min |
| REM sleep | 1h 22m | 1h 31m | 1h 38m | 1h 42m |
| Sleep efficiency | 81% | 87% | 91% | 92% |
| Resting HR | 62 bpm | 58 bpm | 56 bpm | 55 bpm |
| HRV | 34 ms | 48 ms | 58 ms | 64 ms |

**Bloodwork (24-week draw):**

| Marker | Month 0 | Month 2 | Month 4 | Month 6 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| IGF-1 | 118 ng/mL | 156 ng/mL | 198 ng/mL | 224 ng/mL |
| Fasting glucose | 96 mg/dL | 91 mg/dL | 87 mg/dL | 85 mg/dL |
| Fasting insulin | 9.2 µIU/mL | 6.8 µIU/mL | 5.1 µIU/mL | 4.4 µIU/mL |
| HbA1c | 5.4% | — | — | 5.0% |

### The Final Scoreboard

| | Month 0 | Month 6 | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| Deep sleep | 38 min | 102 min | **+168%** |
| IGF-1 | 118 ng/mL | 224 ng/mL | **+90%** |
| Total sleep | 7h 12m | 7h 28m | +3.7% |
| HRV | 34 ms | 64 ms | +88% |
| Fasting insulin | 9.2 | 4.4 µIU/mL | -52% |

Let that sink in:

- **Total sleep increased by 3.7%**
- **Deep sleep increased by 168%**
- **IGF-1 increased by 90%**

Total sleep hours were basically irrelevant. Deep sleep was everything.

---

## The Correlation — Plotted Out

When I plot deep sleep minutes against IGF-1 across all 4 blood draws, the relationship is almost linear:

| Deep Sleep (min) | IGF-1 (ng/mL) |
|---|---|
| 38 | 118 |
| 72 | 156 |
| 94 | 198 |
| 102 | 224 |

Rough math: **For every additional 10 minutes of deep sleep, IGF-1 increased by approximately 16-17 ng/mL.**

Is this a perfect controlled study? No. I was one person. Other variables existed. But the trend was consistent across every single measurement over 6 months.

And it lines up perfectly with what the research says: GH pulses during slow-wave sleep are the primary driver of circulating IGF-1 levels.

## What This Means For You

**If you're trying to optimize HGH/IGF-1 naturally, stop obsessing over:**
- Total hours slept
- Supplements marketed as ""GH boosters""
- Arginine, GABA, and other oral secretagogues (most studies used IV doses, not oral)

**Start obsessing over:**
- How many minutes of deep sleep you're actually getting
- What you're doing in the 3-4 hours before bed that might be sabotaging it
- Your fasting insulin levels (insulin is the #1 pharmacological GH suppressor)

## The Practical Checklist

If you want to replicate this, here's the priority order:

### Tier 1 — Fix These First (free, biggest impact)
- ⬚ Stop eating 3-4 hours before bed
- ⬚ Consistent sleep/wake time (±30 min, including weekends)
- ⬚ Room temp 65°F / 18°C
- ⬚ Cut alcohol (or at minimum, never within 4 hours of bed)
- ⬚ No caffeine after noon

### Tier 2 — Add These Next (cheap, meaningful impact)
- ⬚ Magnesium glycinate 400mg before bed (~$12/month)
- ⬚ Glycine 3g before bed (~$8/month)
- ⬚ Morning sunlight 10-15 min
- ⬚ Post-dinner walk 15-20 min

### Tier 3 — Track and Test (worth the investment)
- ⬚ Oura ring / Whoop / any deep sleep tracker
- ⬚ IGF-1 blood test (baseline, then every 8-12 weeks)
- ⬚ Fasting insulin (most overlooked marker — get this tested)

### Tier 4 — Don't Bother Until Tiers 1-3 Are Locked
- GH secretagogue supplements
- Fancy sleep gadgets
- Peptides or anything pharmaceutical

## FAQs I Know You'll Ask

**""Is Oura/Whoop accurate for deep sleep?""**

Not perfectly. Consumer wearables overestimate or underestimate deep sleep vs. clinical polysomnography. BUT — they're excellent at tracking *trends over time*. If your Oura says deep sleep went from 38 to 102 minutes over 6 months, the absolute numbers might be slightly off, but the DIRECTION and MAGNITUDE of the change are reliable. That's what matters.

**""Can I just take MK-677 instead?""**

MK-677 is a GH secretagogue that does raise IGF-1. But it also raises fasting glucose, increases appetite significantly, and can cause water retention. If your deep sleep is 38 minutes, you're trying to pharmacologically force a system that's fundamentally broken. Fix the foundation first.

**""What if I work night shifts?""**

This is genuinely harder. Your biggest GH pulse is tied to your first deep sleep cycle, which is normally anchored to nighttime via circadian rhythm. Shift workers consistently show lower GH output in studies. The best you can do: make your sleep environment as dark and cool as possible, keep your shifted schedule as consistent as possible, and consider melatonin (0.5-1mg) 30 min before your sleep window. But I won't sugarcoat it — shift work is a real disadvantage for GH production.

**""Does napping count?""**

Short naps (20-30 min) are mostly light sleep. They won't contribute meaningful deep sleep or GH pulses. Longer naps (90 min) can include a deep sleep cycle, but they also risk disrupting your nighttime sleep architecture. For most people: prioritize nighttime deep sleep, don't rely on naps.

**""I already get 90+ minutes of deep sleep. Why is my IGF-1 still low?""**

Other factors that suppress IGF-1:
- High body fat (especially visceral fat)
- High fasting insulin / insulin resistance
- Low protein intake (liver needs amino acids to produce IGF-1)
- Poor liver health (fatty liver, high ALT/AST)
- Chronic caloric restriction or undereating
- High stress / elevated cortisol

Deep sleep is the biggest lever, but it's not the only one.

---

## The Bottom Line

I nearly went down the peptide/secretagogue rabbit hole. Glad I didn't — at least not before fixing the basics.

**38 minutes of deep sleep was my bottleneck.** Not my age. Not my genetics. Not a supplement deficiency.

I was sleeping 7+ hours a night and my body had almost no opportunity to produce growth hormone. I was aging faster than I needed to because of a fixable sleep architecture problem.

**6 months. Zero peptides. Zero ""GH boosters."" Just fixing deep sleep.**

118 → 224 ng/mL.

Your Oura ring is telling you more about your HGH status than most blood tests. You just have to know what to look for.

First example - I am a renter and my agency hired the partner of one of the letting agents to upgrade my bathroom after it got a leak. I was worried about it because he has done jobs before to a poor standard but I didn't have much choice so I did my best to be polite, make space for him to get the work done and I also offered him tea and coffee each day (which is standard in the UK when you have tradespeople in).

It started off ok but I noticed that each day he'd complain to me about his life - the work, life stresses, his partner's health etc. At first I listened briefly and said kind/encouraging things as I didn't want to be mean and I expected he'd get back on with the work after having a moan. But as time went on, he became increasingly angry and complaining, and he was really slow, incompetent and dangerous with his work, blocking my access with rubbish then getting rude and aggressive when I asked if he could move it, leaving sharp objects lying around, one of which fell and nearly hit me in the face. All the while expecting me to listen to his complaints! I actually had to tell him several times that I am the client/the renter because he kept treating me like his sister or something? It made me so angry how he treated me, the whole thing was a terrible experience.

Second example - I recently went to an opticians and the optometrist acted strangely casual and unprofessional compared to previous optometrists. She rushed the eye test, messed up my prescription, tried to overcharge me and I had to get a second opinion elsewhere. I made a complaint as it was such a bad experience, and when the manager rang me she was saying things like 'Ellie (the optometrist) is so upset because she thought the eye test went well and you got on.' The manager seemed upset herself, was overly familiar towards me, again treating me like her sister or colleague. She seemed to want me to feel bad that 'this poor young optometrist was upset' and extract sympathy from me? She also asked me what she could do. I used to work in a (completely different) profession myself so I found myself advising this manager about further staff training. But I feel she should have handled my complaint very differently, apologised for the poor service and reassured me she'd investigate it and set up further staff training or something similar. The way the manager spoke to me again felt overly familiar and just not right.

Both incidents left me feeling angry and confused. I feel like both times the people tried to put me in a different role to the one I was in (I was firstly the renter/client then patient/customer but both times they spoke to me more like a sister/friend/close colleague).

Is this a known phenomenon and does it have a name? It seemed to be a way for people to a)not take responsibility for a poor service they provided and b)extract support/sympathy/emotional labour from someone inappropriately. ",1,1771600267.0,LifeAfterNarcissism,2,1.0,False

We all have different journeys in law, a fact that can be drowned out by the majority voices of 20- somethings who came directly from undergrad to law school.

About me:

Web Developer by day. I read a lot. 15 tattoos and already want more. Former barista and coffee roaster so obsessive over coffee. Workout (cycling is my newest obsession) to keep the mental demons at bay. Always in all black clothing (not a phase). Dog dad. Horror and metal music fan.

1r9xt1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/sanpedrocactus/comments/1r9xt1p/help_me_move_please/,Help me move please!,"Hey SP Fam,

I live in the mountains at 5b. I obviously can't grow in ground, but I do put my cacti outside over summer and they really love it. I watch videos from TSS and Dave that give me such an amazing feeling. I want to have that. I think I need it for my inner peace and soul. I also grow in Phoenix at my parents house, but it's not the same. I only get to spend like 20 days a year with them; that's not enough. Serenity is me waking up in the morning with a cup of coffee and looking at the morning dew on my trichos. I truly feel like I'm missing something in my life right now.... and I know it's growing plants/cacti. 

Help me decide where I should move my family and cactus collection (it's gotten wayyyyy too big. I have 100s of cacti). I've tried AI to help but idk, I feel like other humans opinions are more important.

Things we need:  

* Trichos love growing there!! Ideally in-ground but not completely opposed to growing in large wooden/clay containers.
* Other plants/veggies can grow well with proper care
* Nice place to raise a family and safe. Good community is a must.
* Schools/colleges in the area (both for work and for the kids)
* Housing isn't insanely expensive (I'm looking at you Cali-coast!)

Added bonuses that would completely seal the deal:

* Lots and lots of green! (I understand that there would need to be a balance. If it is super green then the area probably get lots of rain and that means in-ground might not be doable. That's ok. I wonder if people dig and lay drainage pipes underground then stack a very high ratio of inorganic matter on top of them to prevent root rot.)
* Water nearby - ocean, lake, or river... Anything you can swim/fish and chill out at.
* Cool music/art scene - I'm a musician and my wife is an artist.
* Solid farmers market and growers community - I need to get us away from the constant micro/nano plastics and chemicals in all of our foods. I want to be growing as much as possible and trading with other gardeners/farmers.

>Tall, fit, clean.

>More importantly, giving, caring, respectful and attuned to a woman’s pleasure.

>I have only give this massage twice and both times they came back for more sessions.

>My massage can last hours, always at least an hour, but more if you enjoy being edged slowly.

>It starts very therapeutically, you can even be dressed to start. I like to understand your work, are you on your feet all day, working on a computer all day? It impacts the massage, but even without that I can find where you are tight. Shoulders, arms, upper or lower back, quads, calves, feet. And I will give you an amazing therepuetic massage. You will love it. Non-sensual. For a long time.

>If/when you want more, I will slowly tease around the edges to get your reaction. Briefly massaging a bit toward your side boob, your inner thigh, a touch that is a bit softer, occasionally letting my fingers trace under the outer part of your clothing, your pants, shirt.

>Depending on your response, breathing, moaning, body language, I will push further, ever so slowly starting to move your clothes out of the way, and massage deeper. If you are expressing good signs, I will slowly undress you and bring out the coconut oil, where you will start to enjoy a full body massage, still soothing, but sometimes reaching a bit further. By now you will be feeling it, wanting more, but I will edge you softly and slowly, teasing you, making you dripping wet with desire.

>Finally, when you are dripping wet, I will let youfeel my fingers between her legs, so lightly, still teasing, but now transitioning to your needs.

>I’m big on comfort, soothing, teasing, edging and your intense pleasure.

>Is that what you are looking for? If so, send me a chat.

>Hi! Before you ask, Yes I am an actual pastor. And yes I have come to terms with what I’m doing. If you want to know how that works in my head feel free to reach out

>I have been married for almost 20 years without any real intimacy, either physical or mental and I’ve kindof had enough. I don’t want to die without ever having experienced the feeling of being wanted and wanting someone, even if it’s just for a few moments. I am here to find that.

>I will be in NYC in April with a few days to meet and spend time together. I am reaching out now because I would love to spend the next couple of months getting to know each other. I’d love to go to a concert or a comedy show together or simply wonder the city like a couple of love birds:)

>About me: I am handsome, well read and well traveled. I am a bit of a free spirit who spent my early 20’s traveling and living in interesting places. I am talkative and reflective. My love language is teasing, both giving and receiving. I am looking for a woman who is fun, smart with a quick tongue who enjoys witty banter, personality is more important that looks to me. I want someone who is confident and knows she is sexy.

>In the bedroom i want a woman who knows she is sexy and is confident in here body. I love breastplay and pubic groping if you are interested. I also love kissing and foreplay.

>Married man here with 2 high school aged kids looking for someone who can keep up with my witty comments. Well, I think they are witty.

>Is it me that just has an incredibly hard time writing these? Well, I suppose most women don’t write one of these unless they want 3k responses. It is like writing your own review it is way harder to talk about yourself than it is someone else. You either come across less confident or over confident or a dud I guess. Maybe I sound like a dud explaining performance plan writing, call me dud-lee then. That was terrible.

>Okay if you made it this far here is some about me, I love sports, working out, talking social issues, movies, music, cars and pretty much any pop culture thing. I like to laugh, eat and drink. Good food is indeed great for the soul. What am I looking for?

>Someone who has a big personality. Someone who enjoys fitness to some level, music, pop culture…essentially some of the things I like. But, I am very attracted to ladies who have their own passion about their job or hobby or whatever. I truly love intelligent women. I think it’s sexy to hear her talk about things she knows. Someone caring and empathetic is also extremely important to me. Lastly, someone who is looking to commit time to getting to know someone. It’s hard to get to know a person and we live in such an immediate gratification society we forget we are busy people with busy lives and sometimes we aren’t our best conversation each day. That’s just my blunt thought.

>Alright, hopefully someone amazing lady read that and is like “let me find out more about this man”.

>Have a wonderful day.

How can he be a dud when he likes to do interesting things, like ""laugh, eat and drink"". I put the odds at ""someone amazing lady"" even *getting* to that part at <fart noise>.

# 35 (M4F) #NC Love Letter to Millennial Mothers

>Dear Millennial Moms,

>I see you. I see the effort that makes you all amazing.

>You've climbed careers that were never built with strollers in mind. You learned how to lead meetings and bedtime routines with the same calm voice. You answer Slack messages with one hand and tiny, sticky beings with the other, and somehow still apologize for being “behind.”

>Behind what? The impossible standard you were handed and then expected to beat?

>You pour more time, attention, emotional labor, and actual research into your kids than any generation before you—while also being asked to stay ambitious, visible, relevant, and resilient. You didn’t choose between being present and being successful. You just decided to be both.

>And your mombods—your beautiful, soft, real bodies that tell the truth about living. About growing humans. About surviving long days and even longer nights. Your curves hold history. Your softness holds comfort. Your strength tells a story of resilience.

>Your style? Effortlessly unfair. It somehow screams sexy without trying. Clanking accessories, boyfriend jeans— a look complimenting Gen Z's influence, yet putting them to shame.

>What I love most is that you still make room for you. A appointment squeezed between meetings. A skincare routine done at midnight. A quiet promise to not disappear into everyone else’s needs—while still putting your family first, every single day.

>One of you lives under my roof, but unfortunately that's as far a relationship extends. I've worked hard building a beautiful life for my family and don't want to change my situation or yours. I want a lasting connection that co-exists in parallel to what we've built individually.

>Me? I'm tall, dark, dangerously clever, and incredibly attractive in the conventional manner. Sounds conceited? Ask nicely and you can-see-it for yourself.

# 43 [M4F] #Pacific - Seeking Spontaneity And Excitement

>I miss meeting up with someone. Something fresh, new, exciting, the unknown. I miss finding out how you kiss for the first time. The sound you make as my tongue hits your cl\*t for the first time. The first taste of your dripping wet p\*ssy. Finding out what drives you wild, how I can make you c\*m faster, harder, multiple times. I miss being spontaneous and meeting up after work for a Quickie or finding a secluded place and just using you like my own personal toy.

>Getting you to the point and right as you are about to c\*m. Stop. Work my way up to your ear and whisper ""Your not allowed to c\*m, until I say you can"". Forcing orgasms out of you and making you beg ""no more"".

>I am hoping to find a woman like myself that is in a dead bedroom marriage. Someone who is like me, more of a roommate than a partner. Someone who has been taken advantage of and is always giving and asking nothing in return.

>I am looking for you.

>I am a decent looking guy. Am I hot? No. Am I overweight? No. I am average. I am 5'7"" 180lbs. Bright blue eyes, decent looking, average guy. But I am a giver and I want to make it about you.

>In theory I have it all. Good job, nice house, vehicle, family. Unfortunately, after I turned 40 I realized something is missing. The relationship at home is more of a roommate than sexual partner. There's no excitement, mystery or even much of a will for it.

# 44 [M4F] #PaloAlto #CA - Married, ovulating, and in heat — when your body is loud but your mind is exhausted. Seeking a discreet connection with a confident, married size queen who values patience and real chemistry

>I get it—life is relentless, and sometimes, when you’re ovulating, every nerve in your body is screaming for an escape from the ordinary. You’re a busy, stressed-out married professional in a dead bedroom who just doesn’t have time to escape your world and is craving to let go of the wheel and have someone else drive. You experience insatiable, hormonally charged urges, and when paired with a heavy workload, that are just not being met at home. You just want to be taken in the bedroom. **You have needs, and it’s time you found a solution**.

>Fit, masculine blue-eyed with dark hair married professional. Calm presence. Quiet dominance. Built to lead. I’m drawn to confident women who crave more—more intensity, more pressure, more man than most can offer. If you’ve always known you’re wired for bigger energy and stronger hands, we’ll get along.

>Private. Discreet. Dominant behind closed doors. I don’t rush, and I don’t need to explain myself. If you’re a size-queen by instinct and want a man who can actually deliver—message me. More info after we talk.

>PS - **I'm also ""snipped"" so no accidents. Ever. All the filthy fun without the worries.**

>Can really shake that booty. If you’re an arse man the bigger girls gonna bring it. Doggy style rocks!

>Honestly I love the way their bodies move and jiggle. It’s mesmerising and you just want to spend all day watching.

>We can host at a Long Island motel preferably on a weekend afternoon or some weekdays too. Both of us can only meet on LI, but I can travel into Queens or Manhattan but then it is just me. Trust me even if only me I am very very take.charge and will keep yu quite occupied.

So I must have missed it, but did our two ~~favorite~~ gross LI grandpas get together and form a supergroup? Just in case you missed it, they both have very very thick cut long lasting cocks with shaved balls. Also, I didn't bother copying more than one ad (there are sooooo many), but you can be sure that...oh, forget it, here's another one:

# 67/61 [M4F] #Long Island/NYC - Two tall in shape DOMINANT white males want to defile and debauch an entitled, very arrogant & very self centered woman at a Long Island motel one afternoon. If you have the nerve to meet us, your holes will be fucked by two very very thick cut long lasting cocks.

>Besides being arrogant you probably look really nice, but talk a big game when it comes to sex. You just want guys to cater to you. but sexually I doubt you've ever been used as a slut by one guy, let alone two. If you have the guts to meet, we'll defile/debauch and use your holes as our rag doll. To us you're nothing more than 3 holes to service our cocks. We are in charge and unlike the wimpy men you are married to or date, you will do as told. You may be a rich bitch who does not work (we love fucking MILF's too), maybe even someone well known who wants to be fucked by two regular guys, a high powered professional or even a woman who is hot but does not have a great job but because you're very good looking you attract wimpy guys who will do almost anything for you, namely spending lots of money on you. From your end you do not give them the time of day in bed because you are not into them.

>We'd get a motel on LI to totally dominant and use you. My buddy will only meet on LI, but I can meet you alone if you can host in Manhattan or Queens.

>Eventually your orgasms will be very intense as your body will be shaking as the moans are cumming out of your mouth. Then again we will do it multiple times so if you are not able to handle, do not waste your time by responding.

>By the time we're done using your body, we expect our balls to be fully drained. You're nothing but three fuck holes for us to use within your few limits, which we want you to tell us up front and they will be fully respected. We’ll be upfront about this. ***While*** ***we will never hurt*** ***you*** ***(and if you tell us to stop we will),*** we are  gonna **(we know going is grammatically correct but gonna sounds better** use your holes to see how much we can make you cum and of course you will be getting multiple loads too. I can see starting off by inspecting your body like a commodity as we tell you what to remove, how to bend and spread as we examine your holes. We'll probably tie you up spread eagle, each arm to each leg spread open giving us easy access to your 3 holes for part of the time we are together. Plus we love to edge and know you will be begging to cum and your juices will be flowing out of your cunt moistening your ass before entry even just with your juices or lube.

>We cum when we want, and will take whatever time it takes for you to cum again just to make you scream/moan louder and feel amazing as we want your pussy soaked and throbbing by the time we say our goodbyes. And hopefully you will want our cocks and skilled tongues again.

>We know you'll have intense orgasms many times while you suck our cocks and we fuck your pussy and hopefully your ass too. Does your body convulse long and hard or have a quick and violent lock-up when you cum? And we want you cumming multiple times and want the sheets soaked between your legs when we leave. If you squirt that is fine with us too.

>As for.your body type you do not have to be a model but a SSBW is a bit too large. You can be flat chested, have saggy boobs or have very ample boobs because it does note matter. Same if you have stretch marks, love handles, some cellulite, we could care less. Same for a very hairy pussy too. Just love cock and having two men. Whether you have a 1970's type bush or are shaved/trimmed that does not matter. What matters is that you have a great personality, holes craving cock, love to smile and enjoy sex with two men and realize we can last a long time. So please have the stamina we desire. We want to have several hours of fun with you.

>I'm the older guy, 6 feet, 200, clean shaven face, still have most of my graying black hair, dad body, clean shaven, non smoker and do not drink, in good shape, have first class oral skills and my cock is very very thick, cut, mushroom head and shaved balls, plus I last a long time.. My buddy is also white, 5’9”. 7 inch cock a bit larger than mine, smooth all over full head of dark curly wavy hair with just a bit of gray and his body is better than mine as I have a slight stomach etc. Her is In very good shape and also lasts a long time. When we are with you we can double team most of the time but also some one on one play too.

>Host for us or we can get a motel room one afternoon whether on a weekend or during the week. We can also take you to an XXX theater and expose you and use you in front of other men. Or you can service them too. Or go to a glory hole there too. We are fine exchanging pictures. Plus after we start texting if you are still interested, my buddy can write to you on here too.

I would be remiss if I didn't remind you that grandpa #1's very very thick, cut penis has a mushroom head! I know all you mushroom head-lovers out there haven't felt included in a while, so I wanted to let you know - I see you.

# 42 [M4F] #Niles IL #Chi burbs- looking for my bad Cinderella--need a connection to feel something new

>42 year married male seeking a married or attached woman who's in the same situation I am. I'm in unsatisfying, emotionally neglectful relationship. I'm seeking a woman who can be spontaneous and fun. Here's the Cinderella part--I have some fun and sexy clothes that I bought with my wife that she never touched- dresses, lingerie, heels. Size 8-10 and heels 7.5. If you're looking for a change, something new and this slipper fits...DM me. Maybe I can show you appreciation tonight the way neither one of us are getting at home.

Another reader submission (thanks!) that would have made the cut on its own, but it's especially pertinent because it reminds me of the [guy that brought his wife's used toys](https://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1q3wvq0/please_tell_me_this_is_weird/) to a meetup with his AP.

# 40[M4F] #SLC Utah - Tall, attractive, confident married man looking for something very specific.

>I’m a married 40m in SLC. I’m looking for something/someone very specific and I will make it very well worth it.

>I’m 6’3”, fit, handsome, muscular, with a full head of dark blonde hair, blue eyes.

>Who I’m looking for:  
I don’t care about race, age, or relationship status. My requirements are that you be submissive, willing, and have a small waist line that I can grip with my strong hands. You must be attractive because I am. You must be somewhat fit with a lot of sexual stamina.

>We will chat online a bit then meet somewhere public, maybe for coffee, and chat a bit to test chemistry. If we click, you’ll feel my confidence immediately. I will put my hands on your body and make sure you are aware of my intentions and feel comfortable.

>The next step: I will have a hotel room ready for you close to my job for you to stay a night in. You will have the room to yourself that night to just enjoy. I will only ask that you wake up by 9 am the next morning, do your makeup, and wear a sexy underwear and bra set beneath a robe. Expect me to show up shortly after.

>I’ll knock, you will open, and I’ll come into your room. I will take control of you, getting you ready for sex with plenty of foreplay and oral. You’ll drop to your knees as I command and begin sucking my well-endowed cock (I’m 7” and thick). I’m very vocal and will likely be audio recording our session so we can both listen later. I will give you oral until you cum at least once. Then I’ll command you to wrap a large condom onto my cock. I will fuck you exactly the way you need, which we will have discussed beforehand, until you need to check out of the room. I need you to be able to take me deep for as long as it takes me to cum. And I do not do quickies. Plan to glisten with sweat.

>If you meet my expectations, would love a hotel night alone, are capable of long, sweaty sex sessions, and don’t mind being fucked as my phone audio records us, I want to talk to you.

>I’m in no rush. Let’s chat.

At *best*, I think you'd end up in a bathtub full of ice, feeling about 230-310 grams lighter...

And that'll do it for this week. Maybe I'll be back in two weeks, maybe not, but either way - stay adulterous!",0,1771600013.0,adultery,5,0.5,False

1r9xoef,https://www.reddit.com/r/managers/comments/1r9xoef/managing_a_coffee_shop_with_someone_who_isnt/,managing a coffee shop with someone who isn’t assertive enough,"me (female 20) and my friend from highschool (female 21) run a coffee shop together with me being assistant manager and her being manager. 

were very close friends and for the most part were on the same page about how we run the shop and how we tackle certain issues. she’s very hard working, determined and has figured out a way to juggle everything pretty smoothly. 

the only issue is i feel like she is so much of a people pleaser that it gets in the way of her being direct, her communicating in the most efficient and effective way, and her ability to fully put her foot down. 

i feel like most issues she will address, wether they are big or small, starts with beating around the bush, saying “it’s okay, it’s not a big deal”, minimizing the issue, and making her response so long winded that it makes it harder to stomach. i appreciate that she wants to do her best to avoid conflict but i feel like as a manager she should be more comfortable putting her foot down by now. 

for example, this morning i was going to send a text to our work groupchat saying to please not leave unfinished food in the fridge overnight because other people end up responsible for cleaning that up, as well as reminding people not to eat the food that we use to make our syrups etc because the ratio will be off. 

instead of saying that, plain and simple, she sent a long winded text, saying it’s okay to save food sometimes if it’s just overnight (literally everyone that ever saves food like that just forgets about it, it ends up going bad and we always have to throw it out) and that it’s no big deal, and instead of firmly saying not to eat our food we use for syrups, she said “i would prefer for that item not to be eaten please!” 

i just feel like direct and firm communication would make things so much more simple. i think long winded messages like that often feel more like a lecture instead of a correction. maybe i’m just being really picky and i probably didn’t provide the most accurate example but this has been a reoccurring thing for months now, it was worse when we first both got promoted but it still gets to me quite a lot. 

also, nothing against my friend and manager at all. i love her dearly and really admire how kind she is and her commitment to making everyone happy and satisfied… i just feel like as a manager that’s not always possible. 

any advice? ",1,1771599776.0,managers,5,1.0,False

**System prompt (most people do)** :

1. You are an expert executive assistant.
2. Read the email and extract the action items into a bulleted list.
3. DO NOT assign things to the wrong people.
4. You MUST only assign tasks to the CORRECT person!
5. Only output the list!

Context :

Great meeting today team. Sarah, please review the Q3 numbers. John, I need that design mockup by Tuesday. Also, someone should probably buy coffee for the office, we're completely out. Oh, and I think I'll take Friday off. - Mike

\-next input-

Oh, wait, I forgot! Sarah, add the printer budget to your review. Also, can someone please remind the new guy to fix the actual printer? It’s making a terrible noise. Make sure this list looks super professional before you save it!

\-keep asking the AI are you sure-

**Constraint-based System Prompt** :

Domain: Task Resolution

Input: Unstructured text

Target: Bulleted list `[Named Entity]: [Action]`

Constraints:

1. Instantiable state: Explicit action bound to explicitly named human.
2. Locality: Input text.
3. Non-local mappings and unbounded resolutions are non-instantiable.
4. Conversational tokens are non-instantiable.

Try it!

Use the same examples as above and compare the results.

I work at a pretty good size accounting firm and since I started a little over a year ago, I’ve been asked to do numerous things, things that make us just look good, things that are community outreach, things that make the culture more enriching. And it’s draining because I have to juggle these things with the idea that I have to meet a billable hours goal. The last time I pushed back and said “no”, the partner who asked me to do it went to my partner’s boss and convinced her that I had to do it and came back to me and said “oh well, Head of the Departments said you’re doing this.” 

And every time I get voluntold to join one of these committees or do one of these things I can’t help but think that’s that many more hours that I won’t spend with my family because I still have to meet my billable hour goal and finish my client work. And then yesterday I got an email that said congratulations. I have been nominated and accepted to join the wellness committee and what a great honor it is and the partners think so highly of me. I get to be on this committee that meets biweekly and organizes in and out of office events to improve culture and wellness. And then I suddenly couldn’t help but think back to a time when I saw this news segment about culture overseas having this idea of office housekeeping where the bias is that women are expected to come in an hour early to do things like set up the coffee or make sure there’s a birthday cake, etc. etc. but it was always the women. It was always unpaid work and it was definitely un promotable work. So I decided to find the invite and open it up to see who is on this committee now, and lo and behold it’s 15 women and 1 dude who is about to retire, who very well may be the one who started the committee. And all the fun committees are women too, and the culture committees too!! P.S. This committee is expected to encourage people to do wellness challenges like “ which office will have the most average steps per person per day in a month, that office will win a doughnut party” or “ whoever posts the best picture of them hiking with their dog can win a branded shirt from the company store” or “we’re doing yoga Saturdays during tax season!”

I just can’t. And so I said no, again. We gotta be saying no more often to this non-promotable work. I do enough. Now I’m awaiting my “you’re not being a team player” talk (again.) ",13,1771599615.0,Accounting,7,0.93,False

That means nights and weekends spent coding, marketing, and everything in between. No team, no virtual assistants, and no agencies, just me, my laptop, and plenty of coffee. 

This past month felt like a real turning point for me. I got 2,150 organic visitors to my site, which led to 31 trial signups and ultimately 7 paying customers. That brought in $2,795 in revenue, which averages out to about $1.3 per visitor. And the best part is, I didn’t spend a single dollar on ads. 

So, what made the difference? Let me walk you through the tools and strategies that really moved the needle. 

I used [Typedream](http://typedream.com/) to build my homepage and pricing pages quickly. It only took me about two hours, and everything was SEO-friendly and mobile responsive without any complicated coding or design headaches. 

For backlink building, I relied on the [directory submission service](http://getmorebacklinks.org/). Manually submitting my website to hundreds of startup directories would have taken me around 20 hours, but with this tool, I did it in one click. My domain rating jumped from zero to six, and Google indexed my site in just four days, which gave me some crucial early momentum. 

To support content marketing, I used [PostKit](http://postkit.pro/) to post two blog articles targeting keywords with low competition. One of those posts ranked in the top 30 search results within 10 days. I also kept a public changelog to show that the project is alive and active, which helped build trust and conversions. 

For onboarding, I set up a simple five-step drip email sequence using [MailMaestro](https://www.maestrolabs.com/). I welcomed new users, shared helpful tips on features, highlighted testimonials, showcased a mini case study, and asked for feedback. This sequence played a big role in turning 31 trial users into paying customers. 

The biggest lessons I learned are not to chase flashy tools but to pick simple, reliable ones that help you work without friction. Despite not being glamorous, directory backlinks are still effective. Slow and consistent growth beats flashy viral hacks. And most importantly, your goal should be revenue per visitor, not just traffic. 

If you want, I’m happy to share email templates, blog outlines, and even the keywords I focused on. This month was my first time making real profit as a solo founder, and I’m finally starting to feel momentum.",21,1771599473.0,GrowthHacking,3,1.0,False

Me and my avoidant ex broke up 7 months ago and it was MESSY. We kept in contact for a month after but it was not a good idea and he kept playing ""pull and push"" game with my by creating fake stories to get my sympathy and to make me jealous. All boild down when I confronted him about one of his lies and then he decided to cut contact. After a month of not interacting I began testing him and apologizing which lead to him blocking me. After a month he unblock me on messenger but kept me restricted and two weeks later I texted him about something neutral. I got no response and left it at that but a month later he again appeared on my snap by toggleing his activity status and then changing his settings so I could see his snapscore, birthday and other stuff. Between these cycle he was following random girls on Instagram and try to distract I guess. A month after the snap toggleing he unblocked me on Instagram and couple of days later he just randomly unfollowed every girl on his Instagram and his parents and started reposting sad existential reels. He went quite for couple of days until he made his Instagram private and the next day he set his snap settings so I could no longer see the extra info (snapscore, birthday,...). After that he toggled his activity status for couple of weeks and then everything stopped. Two weeks after the last toggle I texted him on Instagram and asked a question about something he's interested in. My ex read the message in 15 min and didn't reply. Yesterday, more than two weeks after my last message, I texted him if we could meet for a cup of coffee and talk. He saw the message in 14 min and less than an hour later responded with ""Hi, thank you for texting me. I don't think that meeting would be a good idea. I wish you all the best."" and I responded with ""Hi, thank you for replying. I will respect your decision. If you ever want to talk- text me. Good luck"". I don't know what to do now because I love him so much. I forgave him for all the lying after the break up and before it and I just want him. Is there anything I can do to make him come back?

We have been tgt for 2 years and a bit now and lived tgt for a year and a bit.

Before we moved in tgt we had a bit of a messy relationship.

Aka: he lied about seeing a female friend when he went on a trip with his mom (he did go to the trip, but he met up with one of his female frds, which liked him. And I’m sorry, I don’t think it’s like ‘yey let’s meet for coffee’ kind of thing. I didn’t get to the bottom of what happened, because I didn’t want to know the truth)

Aka: I slept with my colleague. Not once, but a few times. Went out for dinners tgt.

I guess in my head then it was more like we’ve not moved in tgt. And given tht I will commit fully to him once I moved in with him (I guess I wanted to really make my mind up), I wanted one last time to go crazy.

I was a serial cheater in my last relationship, it was an abusing relationship which I was beaten up, not to justify the shitty things that I did, but it’s was really toxic where I cheat to make myself feel better. (Like u can beat me all you want, but I’m gonna cheat on you to make ur soul hurt) it did break me a little, but I’ve learn how to cope with the trauma with a lot of counselling and therapy.

He was also transparent about it cheating on his ex too. With a friend with benefits. Which he completely cut off when he was perusing me. (This friend is not the friend he met up with during the trip with his mom)

So, present.

We happily lived tgt for year and a bit now. No secrets. We talk about everything. About core values about our views in life. We talked about why we did what we did in our last relationship. We met each others families. I know I am committed to him because for the first time ever I don’t find anyone else attractive other than him. And I guess the same for him, yknow when you can see it in someone’s eyes?

But he doesn’t know about this colleague that I slept with. And I don’t know what he actually did with tht friend of his during his trip.

I guess not all relationships are perfect. But is ours too messy?

At this at and time, all couples seem happy and healthy online. No one talks about these things.

What do you guys think?

Did you and your partner have pasts like this? Did you guys work out?

He mentioned about looking at engagement rings last week (tbh I’m so happy and excited) but I am also panicking and scared if we are doing the right thing given all of the above.",0,1771599108.0,relationship_advice,5,0.25,False

**Pros**

* Easy 5 temperature presets make brewing simple.
* Smooth, controlled pour for V60 and pour-over.
* Fast 1200W heating, usually ready in minutes.
* Stainless steel interior, no plastic touching water.
* Compact size fits small kitchen setups.

**Cons**

* Outside gets hot during use.

But I’ve had this constant low-level money stress humming in the background for years. Not a crisis. Just always feeling one unexpected expense away from panic mode.

For the past month I really tried to tackle it head on. Stricter budget. Cutting subscriptions. Tracking every coffee. All of it.

It didn’t help. If anything it made me feel worse, because I was doing “everything right” and still felt stuck.

Then I read an article that explained why that feeling doesn’t go away when you’re technically managing okay. Nothing life-changing. It just framed things in a way that made me stop and go “oh… that actually makes sense.”

It didn’t fix my bank account lol.  
But it made me feel less like I was broken or bad at adulting.

Sharing in case anyone else here is in that same weird middle space not in crisis, but not really okay either.

1r9x5mk,https://i.redd.it/pxd9wv73wnkg1.jpeg,Design Help!,"I just bought this house and I love the character, but I am completely overwhelmed trying to figure out how to decorate this living space. I am very bad at visualizing design, so I’d really appreciate advice from people who actually know what they’re doing.

A few fixed constraints:

• The TV will be a Frame TV mounted over the fireplace; it’s honestly the only wall that makes sense for viewing/layout.  

• I’m keeping the existing tile in the kitchen area for now because of budget, so any flooring choice needs to work with that transition.  

• The wood paneling and beams are staying (I want to lean into the warmth instead of fighting it).

What I need help with:

1. Flooring color

The living room is currently carpeted and I plan to replace it. What wood tone would work best with the darker paneling and ceiling beams while still feeling updated and not heavy? Light oak? Medium neutral? Something warmer?

2. Furniture orientation

The furniture seen was what was in the house when we toured it NOT our current furniture. 

How would you arrange seating here with the TV over the fireplace?  

Should I float furniture in the room or anchor it closer to the fireplace wall? The space feels wide and awkward and I don’t want it to look like furniture is just pushed to the edges.

3. Style direction

My goal is a cozy, classic, Nancy Meyers / It’s Complicated traditional vibe; layered, warm, lived-in, but not dated or cluttered.

What pieces would you prioritize to achieve that look?

• Sofa style?

• Coffee table shape/material?

• Chairs vs sectional?

• Rug layering?

• Lighting ideas?

I also have a baby, so bonus points for ideas that still feel elevated but practical.

I’d love brutally honest suggestions- layout sketches, furniture types, flooring opinions, anything. I really want to get this right but don’t trust my own instincts yet 😅

I have been working for this family for 2 years, watching 2 kids (5M, 3F) and after the last few months, I’m pretty sure MB has a screw loose. She exploded on me this morning for being 6 minutes late to work because I was waiting for my MIL to come over to watch my own baby. 

For context, 5M goes to kindergarten all day so I’m mostly with 3F. She goes to school two days a week for a couple hours. I drive the kids to all of their activities (5M goes to therapy once a month, i do school drop off and pickup for 3F, take the kids to the library and other fun things sometimes so we aren’t trapped in the house every day) I use my own car because MB doesn’t let me take hers, she doesn’t pay me for gas, and if she wants me to take the kids to something that has an entrance fee she has an attitude when I ask her to reimburse me for their admission fees. To combat that, I’ve started having her pay me the admission fee before we leave the house. 

This morning, MB cussed me out. Literally called me “fucking immature” among other things, and said that her kids need to be my #1 priority. I was floored. I was late to work because my own childcare for the day was running late (rare occurrence) and stormed away when I politely said “I cannot be here to take care of your kids all day long if there’s something going on with my own child. Your kids are my priority from 8am-4pm but if something is going on with my family, that takes precedent.” 

If I am running more than 10 minutes late, I ALWAYS give her a heads up. Since I was on time but got stuck at a light less than a mile away from their house, I didn’t text her. It has never been a big deal before. I didn’t make her late for her appointment either. She had time to go upstairs and finish getting ready, start the dishwasher and make coffee before leaving. I’m shocked by her attitude, and also just the straight up entitlement from her. She works from home one day a week and the other days, she’s home relaxing while I am here taking care of her kids. I feel like she doesn’t really need me, she just doesn’t want to deal with her own kids! She has told me before, jokingly I thought at the time, that she doesn’t like kids but now I can see clear as day that she wasn’t playing around lol. She genuinely doesn’t like to spend time with her kids, and had the audacity to scream at me for being late making sure my own child was set up for the day so that I could be here to take care of hers. 

I am leaving a lot out for the sake of making this post too long, but basically I just don’t know what to do.

**1) Food gifts (Omaha Steaks, premium boxes, etc.)**

This is probably the safest “wow” gift. It’s something people actually use, and it feels premium without being overly complicated. Omaha Steaks is usually a strong option because it ships well and has a lot of bundle options.

**2) Experience-based gifts**

Think event tickets, local experiences, or digital gift cards for experiences. These feel more personal and memorable than physical items.

**3) High-quality everyday items**

Things like premium coffee kits, nice kitchen sets, or upgraded office gear. The key is quality over branding.

From our side, food gifts continue to be one of the most consistent performers for client and employee gifting. If you’re exploring options, Omaha Steaks offer a range of corporate-friendly bundles, and here’s a code you can use to help with your planning: THANKYOU30 for $30 off $149.

I’m currently looking for a co-founder here in Berlin to start something meaningful together.

A bit about me:  
I come from a product background — I’ve worked in consulting and software development, mainly focusing on building, structuring and improving processes. I’m strongest in product thinking, user understanding, validation, and turning messy problems into structured solutions.

What I’m looking for:  
Someone who complements that profile. Ideally more technical (engineering) or very strong in sales/growth — but I’m open. What matters most is ambition, speed, curiosity and the willingness to actually build, not just talk.

Important:  
I’m not fixed on a specific idea yet. I do have strong interests (SMBs, operational inefficiencies, AI leverage, real-world industries), but I’d prefer to shape the idea together based on shared conviction rather than force something pre-defined.

If you:

* Want to build a serious venture
* Think long-term
* Are based in Berlin (or willing to be)
* And are ready to validate fast and iterate

Let’s grab a coffee and see if there’s founder fit.

Feel free to DM me.

Long story short, I found carnivore through keto and it has definitely been a journey of learning and also positive results. To me this diet makes the most sense and I can genuinely say, that I could never go back to my previous way of eating and enjoy it without feeling bad.

I used to binge on crap and I really mean binge: in one day I could easily eat a pizza, a burger meal with all sorts of extras, multiple pastries with coffee, a bag of chips, easily over 500g of loose candy, 1,5l soda, chocolate bars… And I never felt satisfied, I could’ve just kept eating. But at least I felt happier. That was my daily diet, with occasional weight loss attempts here and there to keep my weight in check. 

After that I found a healthier way of eating for a couple of years until now, because of some physical and mental health issues. I ate mostly vegetables, fruit, oats, nuts, chicken, olive oil and so on, the typical healthy diet. But every so often I got takeaway, snacks and pastries because you know, nothing wrong with some friday lunch and snacks. 

And here I am, after 5 months of 20g carb keto and almost 3 months of strict carnivore, still fighting the cravings. I can eat a huge fatty meal of meat, feel full and satiated, but still crave all the stuff I used to eat. My head starts to come up with all sorts of pathetic excuses to justify that one bag of candy, just this once. I start feeling genuine sadness when thinking about all the stuff I can’t eat anymore.

It’s extremely draining and annoying to deal with and no matter what I do or don’t do, it doesn’t stop. I’m very self-aware in those situations and now after eating so much fat daily, the last thing I want to do is to also dump bunch of sugar in my system. I know better, it’s like praying for health issues and that’s maybe why I haven’t really ”cheated” on this diet. But now it’s gotten to the point where I also crave fruits and just plain water porridge, just anything that has carbs in it. I see a fucking potato and my mouth starts watering? Like hello.

This diet really showed me how addicted to carbs and sugar I really am and how sick it actually is. I’ve tried adjusting fats, proteins and electrolytes but nothing helps. This seems to be purely mental. I’m in this weird place where not being able to eat stuff makes me feel like shit, but so does the knowledge that if I do eat, it can have bad consequences and probably make the addiction even worse. I feel like an alcoholic trying to stay away from alcohol. It’s so bad that it’s almost painful, so sick.

So to anyone fighting the cravings, feel free so share that here. Let’s not give up!",7,1771597905.0,carnivorediet,15,0.77,False

Recently he got a new job. Up until now he’s been in a male dominated work place so I never really had to worry about these things before.. I noted the first week there was a girl that worked the same shift as him. Im not going to lie , I can be an insecure person.. I ruminate and obsess sometimes over things that i maybe shouldn’t .. it’s something I’m working on. So of course I noticed this girl was young and pretty. Fast forward a few weeks and I’m very aware of the fact that they work closely together. He is apparently “training“ her on a machine that she was working on before he came to work at this place so the fact that she’s texting him every 10 minutes for him to come and assist her doesnt make a lot of sense to me .. he been vocal about how he’s had to keep running back and forth on the job because she constantly needs help.   
This goes on all day long, him going back and forth to accommodate her and I can hardly get one message from him throughout the day because “he’s so busy” 

fast forward again. I’ve been told not to worry about this girl now that I’ve voiced my concerns. My concerns being her messaging him outside of work hours. Calling him before work to see how long he’s going to be. Txting about non work related things.   
since ive voiced my opinion , now I’m being told she’s a lesbian, she’s crazy etc. one day my senses were tingling because he mentioned what a “bad driver“ she was.   
i immediately questioned how he would possibly know such a thing .. turns out they’ve been doing coffee runs together at work. 

I have been paying attention to how closely he’s been holding his phone and how often he’s going to “take a shit“. im not stupid. ive Felt in my gut for weeks that something was going on.   
I really started to feel that way when she stopped smiling at me and giving me a little wave when I saw her at the workplace.   
now this girl won’t look me in the face. 

so I did what some people would find invasive but I really dont care. I went through his phone. Immediately saw this girls txt notifications are silenced. first red flag. Second red flag was i recovered over 70 deleted messages. some of which he called her beautiful, or hun. i found out they’ve been smoking weed before work together which again if he wasn’t hiding these things it would maybe not be such a huge deal but I had already asked him that question when I found out about the coffee runs .. “are you guys like smoking together all the time and shit?” His answer was no. 

the reaction I got when I brought all this to his attention was the worst part. it’s the biggest red flag of all. He made me feel like I was crazy , flipped the fuck Out on me. he completely flipped the script which made all of my concerns seems so much more valid and it was just so disheartening and I just don’t know where to put myself over the whole thing… I want to confront her. I want to fucking prove that I’m not fucking crazy. I want confirmation of this so I can stop ruminating it in my head.   
I know I’m not crazy, and that his actions and dishonesty is not okay.   
i don’t know what to do. it’s heartbreaking because I love him so much and I’ve never had someone make me feel this insecure.i really don’t think my boundaries are too much but this isn’t the first time they haven’t been respected by him.

**Title:** The Brain Song Reviews — How a Weird Little Tune Totally Rewired the Way I Work  

Hey folks,  

I’ll admit it: when I first stumbled across *The Brain Song*, I thought it was just another overhyped online thing that everyone raves about for a week and forgets. But the weird part? It actually stuck with me — not just as a catchy track, but as a shift in how I think, focus, and show up for my online work.  

I run multiple gigs — freelance writing, digital assistant work, a bit of affiliate marketing — and being *mentally on* day after day gets tricky. Most “boost your brainpower” stuff never lasts longer than my Monday motivation. But this song (yep, *The Brain Song*) hit differently. I listened out of curiosity, then found myself way more centered and ready to work afterward.  

You can check out what I’m talking about here:  
👉 [https://cashflowmanifest.com/The%20Brain%20Song](https://cashflowmanifest.com/The%20Brain%20Song)  

I don’t know the science behind it (some say it’s got tones crafted to activate focus or something), but the before‑and‑after for me has been noticeable enough that it’s now part of my morning setup — coffee, headphones, and *The Brain Song*. If you’re someone who thrives in flexible online jobs but sometimes struggles to *get in the zone*, it might be worth two minutes of your time.  

Again, for anyone curious:  
💡 [https://cashflowmanifest.com/The%20Brain%20Song](https://cashflowmanifest.com/The%20Brain%20Song)  

Let me know if any of you have tried it or experienced that sudden clarity or motivation shift. I’d honestly love to see if it’s just placebo or if this thing’s got real psychological legs.
