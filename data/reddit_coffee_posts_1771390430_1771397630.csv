( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

1r7vur0,https://www.reddit.com/r/elearning/comments/1r7vur0/completion_rates_for_compliance_training_are/,Completion rates for compliance training are notoriously bad (usually ~30% ) for us. I finally hit 90% this month without chasing people. Here’s what changed.,"We all know the ""Compliance Headache."" Most employees see compliance training as 60 minutes of clicking 'next' while they do actual work. We realized our problem wasn't the content, it was the friction. I stopped forcing people to sit at their desks for an hour and moved everything to a mobile-first approach.

3 things that actually worked for us:

1. **Micro-learning:** We broke those 1-hour tutorials into 5-10 minute ""sprints.""
2. **True Mobile Access:** Not just ""it works in a mobile browser"" but a native mobile app where learners can finish a module while waiting for coffee or commuting.
3. **Automated Nudges:** Instead of we sending reminders via emails, the system tracks progress and sends a push notification only when they’re actually behind.

I’ve been using iSpring LMS for this because the mobile app syncs offline (huge for our field team). But honestly, any LMS that prioritizes UX over ""checkbox features"" will probably see the same jump.

I am curious what’s your ""compliance completion"" strategy? Do you guys find that managers chasing people is the only way or is there a tool I’m missing that handles the automation better?",1,1771397184.0,elearning,0,1.0,False

They'll say to their wives that their coworker is cheating on his wife. When in actuality it's them. It's a sneaky way of admitting to it. I wonder if this occurs amongst people with BPD, like my husband, as I've suspected several times he's done it. For example he told me that his ex was slandered him after he called it off. He said she told people he was dangerous because he was interested in serial killers. Not only was he, by definition, slandering her to me. I was the one interested in serial killers.

I was eventually told negative things by his ex, and his former friend, including that he badmouthed me. He said they both were lying.  He is studying to become a counselor. He told me a while back after the teacher discussing a client they had. A man who was having an online affair, which was emotional in nature, and didn't think he'd done anything wrong. He said he was trying to help the woman. I have, for several years now, suspected my husband has cheated. One of the people I believe he tried to cheat with, and possibly did, was someone he said was in an abusive relationship. 

He seemed to take to women in vulnerable positions, wanting to save, just as he did with me. I wonder now if he was telling on himself. Today he told me the teacher mentioned a client she saw today, one who told her he wasn't attracted to his wife anymore, because of her weight gain. He said she was seeking out attractive female therapists as he wanted their attention. I was overweight when we first met in person, after knowing one another online for years, and though online he said he didn't mind it was a different story in person. He rejected me a lot and everything we did felt forced. 

I lost weight and changed and he showed more interest in me. He said he had OCD prior to that about not finding me attractive. That he didn't tell me because he didn't want to hurt me. And that he thought I'd leave. I never fully believed he was attracted to me. He was on medication he claimed killed his libido but I caught him looking at p*rn and at other women. I regained weight and he stopped showing as much interest in me, blaming it on the meds. However, he insulted me over my weight many times during arguments. He called me fat and ugly and said guys prefer thin women. Hl

He said he didn't mean the insults, that he said them to hurt me, and that I also insulted him over his weight gain. He swore he was still attracted to me but eventually, during an argument, admitted to being more attracted to me when I weighed less. He swore he Soto found me atttractive but there's a lot to suggest he doesn't. And that he's not telling me because it doesn't benefit him to. At the start of the year he started looking for a female therpaist. He found one nearby, an older women, with several qualifications. He said she was likely the one but then he found another. A younger, attractive woman. 

He tossed the other option out of the window, no longer considered it, when this new therapist was over an hour away. He did as I expected he'd do it and used her against me, lying about her saying things, such as that he doesn't have BPD after the first few sessions. He included her a joke I made with him which was partially flirtatious. It felt inappropriate. He told me she recommended coffee places for us to go to. He told me today to message her for him, and call her by her first name abbreviated, but then denied he said that, and that if he did it was a mistake. 

Today he told me she made the same comment I did about something his psychiatrist said, concerning an issue he has, which I crticized and said wasn't professional. He didn't seem to agree with that or take it seriously until he told me she said the same thing. I got frustrated and without saying anything, once he sensed I was bothered, he knew why and insisted it wasn't that he was taking what she says more seriously. It was obvious that he was. Now he tells me his teacher supposedly saw a client today, and what he supposedly shared, which mirrors how I percieve our situation. ",2,1771397150.0,BPDlovedones,0,1.0,False

1r7vtkm,https://www.reddit.com/r/VeganBeauty/comments/1r7vtkm/are_you_searching_for_aim_of_life_dont_because/,are you searching for aim of life ? dont because here is meaning of life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1r7vq9t,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r7vq9t,An attempt at a better AI storytelling platform,"Most tools in this space do a few things well and fall apart elsewhere. I've found that most of the new platforms are locked into one audience and ignores everyone else. [LoreWeaver](https://loreweaverai.com/) exists because I wanted something that does everything, and does it well.

**Actual frontier models:** You get access to the real good stuff. Hermes 4 405B, DeepSeek V3.2 with 64K context on Pro, Trinity with 128K context, Qwen3, GLM-5. I stay up to date on the latest and greatest models, and make sure new players are available day one.

**Memory that doesn't cap out:** The tiered compression system means unlimited memories that automatically condense as they age without losing critical plot points. The memory algorithm learns what matters. Memories that keep getting retrieved get boosted in future searches. Your story teaches the engine what's important. Content hashing prevents duplicate junk from clogging your context. When I say unlimited, I mean actually unlimited and not as a marketing buzzword.

**Lore injection that isn't stupid:** Every lore card has importance weighting (1-5), tags scored against current context, and optional pinning for stuff that's always relevant. When tokens get tight, LoreWeaver preserves important canon first instead of randomly truncating your world.

**Integrated visuals, powered by VoyceMe's SEE Engine:** We partnered with VoyceMe to bring their SEE Engine exclusively into LoreWeaver. It reads your character's actual appearance from their portrait and lore description, then generates scenes that look like them. Image chaining means every image builds on the last, so your character stays on-model across outfits, locations, and poses. In multi-character worlds it automatically detects who the scene is about and pulls the right visual profile. Pro users get Auto Scene Detection, where the AI watches your story and generates images on its own when the moment calls for it. No other platform in this space is doing character-consistent, context-aware, lore-reinforced image generation like this.

**Voice that actually sounds alive:** LoreWeaver runs on the world's #1 TTS engine. Every character can have a fully custom voice built from scratch or fine-tuned to match how you imagine them. Tap call on any character and you're in a real-time voice conversation that feels like you're actually on the phone with them. Their personality, their memories, their voice, all there. It's the closest thing to talking to someone who lives inside your story.

**Story branching:** Your narrative isn't a straight line and LoreWeaver doesn't force it into one. Branch at any decision point and explore alternate paths without losing the original. The branch graph gives you a full node-graph view of every timeline, git-style version control for your narrative. Compare divergent outcomes or just let a ""what if"" run wild without consequence. Every branch carries its own memory and lore state, so nothing bleeds where it shouldn't.

**Adaptive soundtracks:** Livestreamed music that reacts to your story in real time. Mood, tempo, intensity shift as scenes change. Think of it like a dynamic radio with full awareness of what's happening in your narrative.

**LoreMaps:** Node-graph view of your entire world. See all your lore cards at once, visualize how characters, locations, and factions connect, spot gaps in your worldbuilding instantly. This is an actual tool, not decoration.

**Full control if you want it:** Model presets for quick tuning. Full parameter control if you're that kind of nerd.

**Community:** There's a Hub for publishing and discovering worlds and characters. Browse by genre, follow creators, quick-play into anything that catches your eye. Some of you are going to build things way more creative than me. That's the point.

**Content policy** Fiction is fiction. Your story is yours.

**Pricing**

* Free tier: unlimited free model messages with 5 premium messages/day with a model of your choice, as well as 10 minutes per month of Character Calling and 5K characters of TTS. Think of it as sampling the goods.
* Plus: $8/mo
* Pro: $15/mo unlimited with image gen and highest context and TTS limits

Little background: I've been a Keurig owner for 10 years and am tired of the watered down artificial taste. Im not a straight espresso person, but a generic Starbucks girl that needs her Iced caramel macchiato and vanilla lattes.

I'm a single mom of a child with ADHD, so my top priority is convenience. I want to press a button, go brush my kiddos hair, and come back to a finished drink (if not, mostly finished) and head out the door.

I'm not even sure whether to choose an original line or Vertuo. I've heard the Vertuo is better for milk based drinks, but has a history of leaking / bad reviews. On the other hand, I've read the original line is better for espresso only (so not for me?), and is more reliable / frequently praised. I've seen the Lattissima, but again, reviews weren't that great and not sure what sub-model would be best. 

Needs: 

* Convenient drink preparation 
* Drink ability: Iced caramel macchiato, vanilla latte, iced coffee, mocha, & cortado (for the husband)

Wants: 

* Convenient cleaning
* Milk frother
* Removable milk tank to store in the fridge.
* Budget around $350-400. Could be around $500 if the thing is absolutely worth it.

I am at 50+ years of age and 7 years post divorce taking my first plunge into the world of online dating.

I put up my profile and some pictures and at first I was just validation farming with no real intent to start dating while I work on some health issues.

But then things changed and I started seriously considering it. Right now I have 2 women that I am chatting with.

One for about 4 days now, but the pace is slow, basically one back and forth per day with long pauses in between, mostly from her side.

Then yesterday another woman liked my profile so I am also chatting with her.

Tbh I am more attracted to woman #1, but I find both attractive for different reasons

Also tbh there is still a chance I decide I am not ready yet, but at this point I am thinking if all goes well, go on a date/meet and see if maybe I really like one of them.

So my questions:

-I am so far using Chat GPT to help me with general advice, which is perhaps not ideal. But tonight I pasted in one of my responses to woman #1 to see what it thought.

It basically said my responses were ok because they showed that I was listening, but it was not flirty/fun and didn't move the conversation along.

I have to admit, it is harder than I thought to keep a text conversation interesting once you have asked a few basic questions.

So how do you make it more interesting? I feel like I am trying to be polite and nice instead of just being myself.

-how do i know when it's time to ask her out rather than keep texting? Is there a time rule eg 3-5 days? Or depends on how the conversation is going? 

-when I do want to ask her out, is it ok to ask her where she wants to go? Give a few options and see what she likes? I know women want men to plan but does that mean I can't ask for input and should just choose whether we go for dinner vs a coffee/walk or something?

-Also in the case that I ask both women out, at what point does it become unethical and I need to decide between one or the other?

Thanks for any responses. I actually have never properly dated since my ex wife and I just kind of got together.",2,1771396191.0,dating,4,1.0,False

I’m a Sagittarius (INFJ) , she’s an Aries (ISFJ/ISFP). We work night shifts together. From the beginning, the energy felt strong and intentional.



She once asked me directly, “Is this just going to stay work and cigarettes?”

When I showed care after her aunt passed away, she looked at me in a way that genuinely felt affectionate.

She told me my perfume felt like an “aura” and rated it 10/10.

I added her on Instagram — she accepted within 5 minutes.



In group conversations she repeatedly says she’s “single” and “loyal,” especially when relationship topics come up. She subtly highlights her good qualities around me.



But here’s the pattern:

She’s warm → then suddenly camouflages and avoids 1-1 moments.

I invited her for coffee/walk twice — she avoided both.

After that, she becomes warm again — eye contact, playful teasing, subtle touches — then distance again.



She’s also very comfortable with a coworker she’s known longer than me (rides, casual closeness, jokes), but I’ve never seen clear romantic escalation there.



And today she went to get Coffee with him for 30 minutes, even though she avoided my invites before.



So I’m trying to understand:

Is this attraction + overwhelm/avoidance?

Or friendly attention without intent?

Or someone who likes the vibe but avoids real escalation?

I've spent WAY too much time studying what makes people magnetic. Not because I'm some self-help guru, but because I got tired of watching genuinely cool people dim their own light over fixable stuff. And height? That's the excuse I kept hearing everywhere. Online forums, research papers, dating coaches, psychology podcasts, all saying the same thing: confidence isn't about inches, it's about presence.



Here's what nobody wants to admit. Society absolutely has biases. Our lizard brains are wired for certain patterns. But here's the thing, some of the most attractive, successful, charismatic people I know are shorter guys who figured out the actual game. Not cope. Not ""just be confident bro."" Real, tactical moves that shift how people perceive and respond to you.



\## the actual secrets that move the needle



\*\*Stop compensating, start optimizing\*\*



There's a massive difference between trying to ""make up"" for height versus simply maximizing what you've got. Overcompensating screams insecurity. Loud cars, aggressive behavior, constantly name dropping, people clock that instantly. Instead, focus on genuine self development. Hit the gym and build a proportional physique. Shorter frames can look absolutely shredded with less muscle mass than taller guys need. Get clothes that actually fit your body, not off the rack garbage. Tailored pants, fitted shirts that don't drown you. Proper grooming. Good haircut, skincare, dental hygiene. These aren't ""short guy tips."" They're just what attractive humans do.



Research from UCLA's psychology department shows that perceived status comes from how you carry yourself, not your measurements. The vibe you project matters infinitely more than the space you occupy.



\*\*Master the art of taking up space without apology\*\*



This sounds contradictory but it's HUGE. Shorter guys often unconsciously shrink themselves. Hunched shoulders, quiet voice, avoiding eye contact, hovering at the edges of rooms. Fuck that. Stand up straight. Speak clearly and project your voice. Make eye contact that lingers just slightly longer than comfortable. Walk with purpose like you own the goddamn place. Not arrogant, just present. When you sit, use open body language. Don't curl into yourself.



I found this concept in ""The Charisma Myth"" by Olivia Fox Cabane. She's a Stanford lecturer who's coached executives at Google and worked with actual world leaders. The book breaks down charisma into learnable behaviors: warmth, presence, and power. The insight that blew my mind? Presence is about making others feel like they're the only person in the room when you talk to them. Height becomes irrelevant when someone feels genuinely seen by you. Insanely good read if you want to understand interpersonal magnetism at a psychological level.



\*\*Develop actual competence in something\*\*



This is the cheat code nobody wants to hear because it requires effort. Be genuinely skilled at something visible. Could be your career, could be a hobby, could be a creative pursuit. When you're the person everyone turns to for X, when you've achieved mastery in Y, people's perception of you fundamentally shifts. You become ""the guy who"" instead of ""the short guy."" 



Studies on status hierarchies show that competence based respect overrides almost every physical characteristic. A research paper from Princeton found that perceived competence affects judgments of attractiveness more than symmetry or traditional beauty standards. Wild right?



\*\*Stop filtering yourself out\*\*



Here's something brutal. You're probably rejecting yourself before anyone else gets the chance. ""She's too tall for me."" ""They probably want someone bigger."" ""I shouldn't even try."" Meanwhile, plenty of people don't give a shit about height but YOU'RE making it the focal point. There are absolutely women and people out there for whom height just doesn't register as important. But you'll never meet them if you preemptively disqualify yourself from every interaction.



If you want to go deeper on this mental game but don't know where to start with all the psychology books and dating advice out there, BeFreed is worth checking out. It's an AI-powered personalized learning app built by Columbia alumni and AI experts from Google. 



You type in your specific goal, like ""I'm a shorter guy and want to become more magnetic and confident in dating,"" and it pulls from psychology books, research papers, and dating experts to create a customized learning plan and audio content just for you. It connects insights from resources like The Charisma Myth, attachment theory research, and practical dating psychology, then turns them into podcasts you can listen to during your commute or at the gym.



You can choose quick 10-minute summaries or 40-minute deep dives with examples, and customize the voice (the smoky, conversational tone is surprisingly engaging). There's also a virtual coach you can chat with about your specific struggles. Makes self-improvement way more digestible than trying to read through dozens of books yourself.



\*\*Cultivate genuine confidence through exposure\*\*



Real confidence doesn't come from affirmations or fake it till you make it BS. It comes from repeated exposure to uncomfortable situations until they're no longer uncomfortable. Social anxiety researcher Dr. Ellen Hendriksen talks about this in her work. Confidence is a SKILL built through action, not a personality trait you're born with.



Start small. Make eye contact with strangers. Strike up conversations in coffee shops. Go to events alone. Ask people out who you think are ""out of your league."" The goal isn't success, it's desensitization to rejection and proof that the worst case scenario isn't that bad. Track this in Finch, a habit building app that gamifies personal growth. It helps you build consistency with daily actions that compound over time.



\*\*Own your narrative\*\*



If YOU treat your height like a character flaw, everyone else will too. If you treat it as completely irrelevant or even crack jokes about it first, you remove its power. Self deprecating humor works when it comes from genuine self acceptance, not when it's a defense mechanism. There's a difference between ""yeah I'm short lol whatever"" and desperately trying to beat people to the punchline because you're terrified they're judging you.



""Models: Attract Women Through Honesty"" by Mark Manson is legitimately the best book on modern dating psychology I've encountered. Manson was a dating coach for years before writing ""The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*ck."" This book will make you question everything you think you know about attraction. His core premise? Polarization beats broad appeal. When you own exactly who you are, flaws included, you become magnetic to the right people and irrelevant to the wrong ones. That's infinitely better than being mildly acceptable to everyone.



\*\*Build your life to be genuinely interesting\*\*



Attraction isn't about checking boxes. It's about having passion, stories, perspective. Travel. Read weird books. Have strong opinions about things that matter to you. Pursue hobbies that fascinate you even if they're niche. Develop your sense of humor. The most attractive thing you can be is someone with an authentic, interesting life that others want to be part of.



Listen to podcasts like The Art of Manliness or The Jordan Harbinger Show. Both interview incredible people from wildly different fields and extract practical wisdom about building a life worth living. Not bro science, actual insights from researchers, entrepreneurs, athletes, artists.



Look. Biology exists. Social conditioning exists. Some people will filter you out based on height and that's their right. But far more people than you think genuinely don't care or will overlook it entirely when everything else about you is dialed in. The goal isn't to trick anyone. It's to become the most authentic, competent, charismatic version of yourself possible. That person is always attractive, regardless of height.",1,1771395930.0,RelentlessMen,0,1.0,False

1r7vgy6,https://www.reddit.com/r/manifestingSP/comments/1r7vgy6/another_crazy_sp_manifestation/,Another Crazy Sp Manifestation!! 😳,"So for those of you who read my previous story (titled ‘avoidant Sp’) I promise I’ll get back to you all soon and I will also share which subs and affirmations worked for me as you all did ask and I know I promised a post, it’s coming! 

But this just happened and I had to share it with you for some encouragement, especially in dropping ‘how’ it will happen! Because this is wild and I can’t figure this out at all how this could happen :) 

This is about a previous SP of mine from about five years ago. 

This SP was very special to me, we had a very deep friendship before anything else and I have always treasured that. 

But, over a year ago, we fell out, I told him I didn’t want to talk to him again.

I blocked him everywhere and the important part 

- deleted his number entirely from my phone and from WhatsApp and any other place online we could be connected. 

But of course I still love and care for him and have been thinking of him recently and hoping he is doing well. 

Of course I can’t reach out to him because I don’t have his number. 

So I was just casually thinking the other day ‘I wish I hadn’t blocked his number’ and ‘I wish I had a way to get his number’ not any form of manifesting, (although of course it was)! just a few thoughts as I went about my day. 

Anyway, few days later I go to meet another friend for coffee, he asked for my location so I head to Maps to get it. I click ‘share’ 

And right below where it said share, my old Sp’s number comes up, but stored under a different name.

What. Did I imagine deleting him?!!! 

I head to my phone contacts, he isn’t stored there under that name. Or any name. He isn’t in my phone, period. 

Not to mention I’ve used maps literally hundreds of times to share my location in the past year for food delivery drivers and I’ve NEVER seen his number come up. Because, I deleted it. 

So maybe I’ve got his number wrong and it’s not him. 

I head to WhatsApp put the number in and immediately his photo comes up. It’s his number. 

Ok sure logically, maps somehow stored his number 

- even though we didn’t ever share location and we haven’t seen eachother for two years and I don’t think even ever used Maps to location share over two years ago… 

Even then… 

Why did it come up only now?

Why did it never come up before?? 

How did it suddenly show me a phone number that has literally been deleted from my phone, over a year ago? 

I don’t know whether I’ll contact him and honestly was a bit upset to even see his number again lol, but the point is 

It’s always working ✨

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1r7vftr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlAnon/comments/1r7vftr/how_do_we_work_through_this/,How do we work through this?,"My (25f) boyfriend (31m) is beginning his sobriety journey. He started about a month or so ago. He wasn’t feeling very wanted/ recognized at his job and was going to leave to go back to a previous job that he’d left on good terms from. 

When putting his notice in, his boss asked why. He told them that it was a better opportunity for himself and that he was having a tough time navigating how to start his sobriety. They said they’d give him some resources but to stick around and that they really did value him and were looking at getting him into a different position that offered a raise so he told the other employer that he decided to stay. He took two weeks off to detox and went back to work feeling pretty good. The first week was a little rocky as they’d changed a few things while he was gone and they were still navigating the new structure. The second and third week though, he said he was feeling replaced and that the vibes were very, very off.(while he was gone they hired a previous employee back). 

I went to the garage with him one night while he was down there and noticed a box of beer under the table. I nudged it with my foot to see if it was an old box or if it was new as there were about 5 cans missing. They were new. I looked at him and said “really?” He replied “those are old!” I didn’t reply and headed upstairs to collect my thoughts. I knew they weren’t old, I’d gone down there a few days prior and they were not there. He came upstairs and said “I’m sorry” and was upset. I replied “don’t be sorry for me. Be sorry for yourself, be sorry for your son.” We had a conversation about it and everything in the end was fine. I expressed to him I wasn’t upset that he’d drank but more upset that he had lied to me about it. Two weeks after being back at his company, they canned him out of the blue for “not being reachable during working hours and losing the company money”. They are a very small company and I can understand what they’re saying but he was already at a customers house on a job and missed ONE phone call from his boss. So that obviously hasn’t made his journey easier.

Fast forward to this last Sunday. We were getting ready to head to church and he was getting dressed in the doorway of our closet. I saw a beer can on the window ledge in the closet that was 1/2 drank. I pointed it out and he immediately got very emotional and upset. Mainly saying “why does this keep happening? I’m so over this!” and began to cry. I didn’t say much but thought it was weird. 

Tonight, we go down to the garage and I sit in one of the chairs and go to take my phone out and find an unopened can seemingly hidden behind a pack out tool box. I stood up, grabbed it, and dumped it outside. He asked what it was and I showed him the now empty/ crushed can. Without saying anything. There was silence for a little bit and I was choking back tears the best I could. He asked me what was wrong and I asked him if he’d been to the corner store. He said yes but just to buy a few coffees the other day that he drank before church. I said “but nothing else, right?” And began to cry. He said that he hadn’t. I told him through crying that I just feel bad because I WANT to believe him so so badly. But that it’s hard because of him lying to me previously about it when I already knew the answer. He was very nonchalant about it. No crying, no yelling (which isn’t typical for us anyways) just normal and oddly calm. 

Mainly, I’m just worried and I don’t know what to do or how to navigate all this or if anything I’m doing it detrimental to his sobriety. I try to be as honest as I can with things i tell him in a way without being too harsh. But I guess I expected a different reaction when I’m crying to him about not believing him and feeling guilty for it.

Like you *should* go to the gym, maybe read a book, or cook something healthy... but your brain and body are just straight-up DONE? You're not alone. Almost everyone I talk to feels the same. We all blame it on ""being lazy"" or ""getting old"" or “just need more motivation,” but that’s not actually the problem.

This post is for anyone who wants to feel *alive* again after 6 PM. It’s based on actual research, expert insights, books, and podcasts, not random Tiktok hacks from influencers who don't even work 9–5 jobs. Most people are stuck in an invisible fatigue loop but don’t know what’s draining them, or how to fix it. So here’s the good news: evening energy *can* be improved. It’s not genetics. It’s not a flaw. It’s a skill.

These tips are all science-backed and actually work in real life. Take what clicks.

* **Fix your “cognitive fatigue,” not just physical fatigue**
* Most people think they’re tired after work because their body is tired. But it’s usually your *mental bandwidth* that’s shot.
   * According to Dr. Andrew Huberman (Stanford neuroscientist, *Huberman Lab Podcast*), your brain uses a huge amount of glucose throughout the day, especially when switching between tasks or multitasking. So if your work is mentally demanding, you’re likely hitting decision fatigue by 7 PM.
   * *What helps:* Use a 90/20 focus/work rhythm during the day (like the *Ultradian Rhythm* method from Ernest Rossi), 90 minutes of focused work followed by a real 15–20 minute break. This reduces cognitive load. Also, try scheduling harder tasks earlier in the day before your mental battery gets drained.
* **Eat for energy, not spikes**
* A lot of after-work fatigue is just blood sugar crashing in disguise.
   * A 2021 review in *Nutrients* journal showed that high-carb, low-protein meals, especially processed carbs, lead to greater post-meal fatigue and irritability.
   * Eating a high-GI lunch (or sugary snack around 3 PM) causes your energy to spike, then crash hard in the evening.
   * *What helps:* Protein-rich lunches, fiber, and healthy fats = more stable energy. A protein shake or Greek yogurt around 4 PM can give you a second wind at night.
* **Do a “transition ritual”, don’t just crash on the couch**
* Your brain needs a signal to shift gears from work mode to personal mode.
   * Cal Newport talks about this in *Deep Work,* even a 2-minute ritual like writing a “shutdown complete” list or walking around the block can act as a mental reset. Without this, your brain keeps looping open tasks, draining background mental energy.
   * *Try*: Changing clothes immediately, taking a cold or warm shower, or doing a 5-minute stretch session with music.
* **Move your body, even for 5 minutes**
* Sounds counterintuitive, but movement gives energy.
   * A study in *Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics* found that even a 10-minute walk boosted energy *more* than 50mg of caffeine (that’s half a cup of coffee).
   * *What helps:* Do 10 squats, a silly dance, or a short walk after getting home. If that’s too much, just lay on the ground with your legs up against the wall. It helps drain lymphatic fluid, reduces cortisol, and somehow resets your whole nervous system.
* **Protect your “second day”, 6 PM to 10 PM is prime real estate**
* Treat your post-work hours like mini prime time. Don’t burn it all on mindless doomscrolling.
   * Johann Hari in *Stolen Focus* warns that social media and passive screen time drain your mental energy more than they restore it. Your dopamine system gets hijacked, so even doing things you *want* to do later (like reading, hobbies, etc) feel boring by comparison.
   * *Try:* Delay phone time until after 8 PM. Leave your phone charging across the room. Use analog tasks (drawing, puzzles, journaling, cooking) to recharge instead of scrolling. It sounds lame until you actually try it. Then it feels addictive in the *good* way.
* **Don’t trust your “5 PM brain” to make good plans**
* Planning what you’ll do after work *during* work is a setup for failure.
   * Behavioral scientist Katy Milkman (Wharton, author of *How to Change*) explains that when you rely on your future self to make tough choices (like go to the gym), you’re basically tossing the decision to your most depleted self.
   * *What helps:* Make “if-then” plans in the morning: “If I feel tired at 6 PM, then I’ll go for a walk and listen to \_\_\_ podcast, or I’ll take a shower and do \_\_\_ next.” You pre-wire the decision while your willpower is still strong.
* **Sleep quality > Sleep quantity**
* You might *think* you’re getting enough sleep, but if the quality sucks, you’ll feel like trashy soup by 6 PM.
   * The *Sleep Foundation* reports that even mild sleep fragmentation (from scrolling or blue light exposure) reduces slow-wave sleep, the most restorative stage.
   * *Try:* Use blue light filters after 8 PM. Wear blue light glasses or set your screens to “night shift” mode. Be boring and consistent with your bedtime.
* **Caffeine budget = use wisely**
* Afternoon coffee might feel like an easy fix, but it could be what’s killing your evening energy.
   * According to the Cleveland Clinic, caffeine has a half-life of up to 6 hours. So that 3 PM coffee could still be active in your bloodstream at 9 PM, screwing your sleep and next-day energy.
   * *Better move:* Switch to green tea or low-dose caffeine before 2 PM. Or try “caffeine microdosing” (25mg) spread across the morning for smoother energy without the crash.

Too many people think evening energy is about “trying harder” or pushing through. But staying energized after work is actually about *energy conservation and design*. Every small tweak helps. Don’t trust anyone selling you motivation. Trust systems, cycles, and real science.

**Should I Feel Guilty for Skipping My Friend’s Pricey Wedding?**

&#x200B;





Hey Reddit, I need some opinions because I’m feeling a little lost. My friend Karen (30F) is getting married, and while I’m super happy for her, she’s planning a huge destination wedding in the USA (we live in Europe). She keeps calling it her ""real"" wedding, even though there’s supposed to be a smaller one in France where we can all go but we are not invited (yet).

Here’s the thing: Karen is really pushing for my boyfriend and me to go to the USA for this wedding. I’ve tried to explain to her that I just don’t have that kind of money lying around. Her solution? Start paying for flights now in small installments and figure the rest out later. Honestly, though, I just don’t have the budget, and this would eat up my holidays for 2025, which is not really how I want to spend it.

Don’t get me wrong—I love her and would be so happy to see her on her big day, but... is it me, or are brides becoming total bridezillas with these crazy demands? Do we really have to change all our plans because it’s ""their year""? Why do so many weddings now feel like a massive financial burden on the guests?

Karen doesn’t seem to understand why I’m hesitating and she keeps pushing us to get the tickets, and I’m starting to get frustrated. I even asked her about the second, more local celebration, but she brushed it off and kept insisting on the USA wedding. Am I being unreasonable for wanting to skip this whole destination wedding thing?

*A person who expects you to go into debt for their party is not your friend.*

*If they really want you there, they should offer to support you financially but it's unreasonable to expect your friends to fly across the globe for your pleasure and pay for themselves. If you plan a destination wedding you either pay for the people you want there or expect that some of them might not come.*




**Conscious-Survey7009**

*The bride is probably trying to ensure her room is free by getting X number of people to book.*

*A friend would accept that you couldn’t make it. Tell her to send you the info for the livestream so you can attend from home. Brides do not get a year, expensive hen/bachelorette parties and everything they want. They can hope for it but unless they’re paying everyone’s expenses it’s just not doable for everyone. She needs to realize this.*

*Since you’ve said no, be prepared for her to ask you to be in the wedding party to try and get you to attend. Hold your ground with the no. No is a full answer. If you have to, stress that as nice as it would be to attend she needs to be aware that not everybody has the means and the time to do this and her constantly asking is going to hurt the friendship.*



**BeeQueenbee60**

*Yes. I'm thinking there's a catch in this destination wedding, as well. Free hotel room, plus a discount on food or something. The telling part is that the OP hasn't been invited to the local wedding yet.*

**Update - 1.5 years later**

&#x200B;

Hi everyone,

About a year ago I posted here about skipping my best friend’s US destination wedding because it would have cost me and my boyfriend around 4–5k, which just wasn’t financially realistic for us.


I wanted to update because I genuinely don’t know if I lost one of my closest friendships over this.

For background: We all live in Paris. She’s American, big family, wedding in a beautiful wine region near where her parents live. Very aesthetic, very Instagram, very curated. The groom is French. My boyfriend actually introduced them years ago.

We weren’t casual friends. We were see-each-other-every-other-day friends. Wine nights. Random weekday dinners. Group chats constantly. Trips. Real-life closeness.

When the US wedding was announced, I did the math. Between flights, hotels, activities (boat day, wine tours, etc.), it would have been close to 4–5k for us if we stayed a week. That’s a huge amount of money for us. And the entire Paris friend group felt the same. No one here has family in the US to combine it with.

Before the US wedding, she came to us with a big bouquet and a bottle of wine and asked us to be bridesmaid and groomsman. It was filmed. Very emotional. Very “moment.” The thing is, I had already told her it was almost impossible for us to go. It felt like being emotionally cornered on camera. We didn’t say no in that moment because… how do you? It was awkward. But a few days later I met her alone and told her clearly we couldn’t commit because of money. We wouldn’t be able to travel or do anything else that year if we went. She brushed it off. “Yeah I know.”But something shifted.

Important detail: before the US wedding, we organized and fully paid for a Portugal stag/hen weekend for both of them. It was amazing. We put effort, money, time into celebrating them. So it’s not like we didn’t show up in other ways.

Then, 2 months later, came the small French wedding (yes, we got the invite!). It was beautiful. Intimate. So fun. But she was different. Distant. Polite. Surface level. Not the person I used to sit with for hours talking about everything.

Now it’s been about 6-7 months since that wedding. I’ve maybe seen her 5 times.

Every time the group tries to meet, she makes excuses. Or insists we come all the way to their place (45 minutes outside Paris) instead of just meeting centrally where all of us live. It feels like a subtle barrier.

Meanwhile, she messages my boyfriend weekly for work advice. “Let’s meet soon!” texts. Professional warmth. But with me? It’s cold. How’s work. How’s life. End of conversation.

I’ve tried reaching out. A few “let’s get a coffee and chat” messages. Always “yes soon!” but it never happens. After a while, I stop chasing.

And I can’t help but feel like I didn’t fit into the wedding storyline she imagined. The American bridesmaids flew in, the Instagram content happened, the dream aesthetic was fulfilled. The Paris girls didn’t. Did we get quietly downgraded?

I don’t know if she consciously resents us for not going. Or if weddings just reorganize people’s emotional priorities. But it feels like I lost someone who used to be one of my closest friends and that makes me really sad. Am I overthinking this? Did I underestimate how much not going would hurt her? Or is this just what happens when expectations don’t match reality?

*what is the point of having two weddings if not to allow people to attend one or the other*



**chicagok8**

*To be the center of attention TWICE, of course.*

**FatterThanIThinkIAm**

*She consciously resents YOU at least. I think she's probably staying so friendly with your husband just to rub in how distant and disappointed she is with you now. She's pissed that you didn't do your part to make her Insta-worthy wedding your top priority. Let that friendship go - she's proved herself to be a shallow, mean girl. Stop reaching out, stop including her in group get-togethers, just stop. She loves that you're chasing her and she's not done punishing you Paris girls for not going into debt for her wedding. Fuck that shit.*


**queefer_sutherland92**

*Oh god you’re right. I’ve seen that tactic and it’s only the worst people who use it. Like they’re just the absolute worrrrrrrst. Gross gross gross.*

*The best path forward OP is to simply ignore it. And I know this is really immature and petty but nothing pisses off an emotional manipulator more than not noticing their attempts to manipulate you.*

like..... i dont think there is anything weird about that and i stand by it. linkedin was literally made to stalk people and if you dont want people stalking you, dont have a public page then with info abt you? and i literally read about professors and academics and their careers all the time, its all on the internet and very public by their own will. like thats literally how i got a research position. i stalked a professor, found their email, emailed them asking to get involved in their research, and then got involved.

like this is so normal at penn is it not? bro everyone i know here is so proactive but its like the norm. like so many people i know here stalk others online to get peoples emails and then reaching out to 100 plus random people that they just stalked asking for a coffee chat to get a referral. and that is so normal here. forget investment banking, im involved in a publicly known club at penn where it is literally our JOB to stalk people online to fact check their information.

but after i posted that, i started getting replies saying that im weird and creepy and to please be respectful because these are real people and im like??? all i did was google them and read THEIR own bio on THEIR OWN public linkedin page that they promote themselves? likeeee................. ngl i dont see anything wrong with what i did but apparently looking people up on the internet is weird in the non pre-professional world

also i think maybe 85% of penn undergrads are stalkable on the internet in some form whether it be their linkedin account or social media or being in the news or on a website or getting articles written about them or whatever. i guess i also forget most people arent as stalkable and on the internet as people at penn are... so they probably dont feel as comfortable being publicly on the internet and thats why they think its weird

i’m a pretty active person and have been doing balanced weight lifting + cardio for a few years. last month i started my first serious fitness journey (tracking calories, macros, steps, workouts). i was really motivated to go on a calorie deficit (1500 cal a day, 140g protein) for a few weeks and ate 90% whole foods, with the goal of fat loss / body recomp.

i didn’t realize how much i grazed throughout the day. i’ve always had a habit of snacking since pre-puberty. i just genuinely love food and i’m always thinking about food. especially at school it’s so easy to grab a snack in between class, and there’s always events with free food. but i knew i had to control that  to some extent for my fitness goals, so i started focusing on eating higher-volume whole foods during meals so i was getting all the nutrients. i also drank black coffee to help, got 8h sleep every night, and took rest days between workouts. it was difficult to resist cravings but i started seeing great results and was feeling very confident. i lost weight and didn’t even lose my period!! i was doing everything “right.”

it went well for 2 weeks. until one night, my dorm had an event with fresh cookies late at night. mind you i hadn’t touched cookies for 2 weeks at that point, and i’m the biggest sweet tooth in the world. given my great progress, i decided “it was okay to reward myself” and grabbed 2 cookies. it then turned into 4. the next morning i found myself craving pancakes, fries, cream cheese bagels, and everything i could find at the dining hall. i ate 5 plates of food until i felt like i was going to pass out.

i told myself it was fine. i didn’t blame myself, didn’t purge, didn’t do anything crazy. went to the gym like usual. but the next meal the same cravings came. i started stuffing myself every single meal. every day i told myself it was fine, and i would get back on track the next day. it’s been 10 days and i still can’t stop eating. i’m filling up plates after plates in the dining hall. at night im searching around the dorm for free food and would go to the vending machine even when i’m completely stuffed. i don’t keep any snacks in my room but i would genuinely go on crazy lengths to find food.

i don’t know what i’m doing wrong here…ive completely lost control and i feel horrible but i just can’t stop. i feel like im destined not to be able to lose weight. i’m devastated bc all of my progress has basically been undone (if not more). i haven’t weighed myself but i’m visibly bloated. i didn’t track calories for the past 10 days but my estimate is between 3-4k every single day. help idk what to do 😭😭😭😭",2,1771395355.0,WeightLossAdvice,2,1.0,False

A week can pass by rather quickly if you are busy. It was as if every hour had already been spent by the time Paul realized it was morning again. The forge became home. The elves would complain, but only in the way craftsmen always did. Loudly, and with their work never slowing down.

By the end of the second day, they had half the wagon’s base roughed out in thick ash planks and a full crate of iron pins smithed to his specs. Tarwin and his crew argued for three hours over the lengths of the pins and it took the combined efforts of Paul and Gibkin to straighten them out. Then they spent two hours shouting about how much iron it could bear before anything snapped. Someone else said they ought to add a ram or wedge to the front.

Lunches passed in a haze, and most nights ended with Paul asleep on a bench, scribbling last-minute changes. He never remembered closing his eyes, but the next thing he knew, a strong hand clapped him on the shoulder and he jolted awake, smashing his knee on the underside of the trestle.

“Move your spindly legs off my bench,"" Gibkin barked, looming over him with a mug of something pungent. ""You’re scaring the apprentices with that snoring.”

Paul blinked through bleary eyes. It was not even dawn; the smoky orange haze outside the windows told him they had perhaps an hour before the next shift in the forges. For several seconds he could only stare at the mug in Gibkin’s fist.

“Oh. Sorry. I wasn’t, I mean, I’ll get up.”

“You will, and you’ll eat,"" said Gibkin, shoving the mug at him. ""I’ve been watching you try not to faint out here for three days straight. So, eat. The rest can wait.""

Paul stared into the cloudy surface of the mug. He had no idea what was in it. He just knew that it was hot, and it steamed, and it tasted like someone had brewed old coffee using a blacksmith’s apron instead of beans. He grimaced and forced another mouthful down.

“It’s awful, but thanks,” he said.

Gibkin snorted. “You’re welcome. Now.”

Gibkin crossed his arms.

“You’ve been down here sketching while the carpenters assemble the frame. You need to keep me in the know, what's the next step?”

Paul squinted blearily at the floor for a second, trying to remember what problem he’d fallen asleep thinking about this time. It was either the cannon mount or the gearing for the front axle, They had to slash the cannon. Too much physics involved. Too much potential for an accident. He pulled himself back. He had been getting too introspective recently, Gibkin was right.

“Yeah, alright. So we need to build the engine itself. Well, ‘engine’ might not be the right word for what we can actually make. We need what amounts to a massive, sealed cauldron and a metal firebox, preferably lined with ceramic,” he started.

Paul got up, with his brain finally coming out of the slog he felt much less tired, whatever was in that drink must have been strong.

“I want to explore ways to do that, but it's not absolutely necessary. It has to be all one piece though, you got that? Get Cassoway to make a mold for you.”

Gibkin nodded and motioned for him to continue.

“Right, then the piston. Thankfully if we make it big enough we can forgo the need for precise measurements. Have a team working on, oh this.” Paul ripped a page out of his journal and handed it to Gibkin.

The elf looked over it for a moment before calling over some smiths and showing them the page. A few questions later Gibkin was asking for the next part.

“The flywheel, or we need a very heavy iron wheel. the heavier the better, but not too large. it has to have a hole here too.” He pointed to a new page, then took it out and it was quickly whisked away to be made somewhere else in the forge.

Each little group of elves had their own task. The place was buzzing with shouting, running elves. Elves banging on metal, pouring molten iron into molds, in general, it was very loud. Paul found it oddly soothing though, he didn’t mind the shrill tinging of the hammers.

It would take all day, but by the end of it, the wheel was made, now they needed to mount it. The pressure vessel was still cooling and Paul was particularly nervous about that one. They were going to use low pressure so no bomb, but steam still burns, and having an enclosed space suddenly fill with scalding hot vapor did not sound OSHA approved to Paul.

The piston however, that would have to wait. To get as close of a fit as they needed, first they had to have the pressure vessel. Which meant the only thing they could make was the arm. They attached one end of the arm to the wheel and made a temporary mount, just to make sure it could spin. That was another problem they had to tackle. A question Paul had worked the whole day on. One could try to Babbitt the holes so that the metal wouldn’t weld itself together. But without proper bearings the thing was likely to seize up rather quickly.

They put the wheel on the mount and it took some effort, but Paul was able to get the wheel to spin. It was a beautiful mess of a piece of garbage. But if it worked, it would be more than enough.

\*\*\*

It took another day for the pressure vessel to fully cool. Once out, it took another day for the carpenters to make a mock piston to the exact dimensions Paul wanted. They could finally make the piston and that process took a day more.

All in all, it was a grind. But they had completed the final pieces, and joined them all together. The moment of truth came and every smith in the smithy found themselves on edge. Would it work? Would it blow up like Paul said it could? Paul readied the engine, added their fuel, then lit the firebox and closed the hatch. They waited. They heard at first, a hissing noise, then a scrape of metal on metal as the wheel began to slowly creak forward.

Every elf was silent. The wheel turned a little more and began to pick up speed.

Every smith shouted with shock and amazement Gibkin tried to pick up Paul, but quickly abandoned the gesture.

“Erowin’s hands. Paul, you’re heavier than you look.”

A sudden shout, Paul and Gibkin turned to see that the pressure vessel had cracked and began leaking steam. Someone called out.

“Quickly! Put out the fire!”

A few elves began to rush towards the hissing iron vessel. Paul’s arm shot out.

“Wait!”

*Crack!*

*Boom!*

The vessel’s side blew out and a massive gushing of steam suddenly flooded the area. There was screaming.

It was horrible, Paul knew it. He could see it, he could see the scolded flesh slough off the bone of elves whom he knew and had worked with not even hours ago. He was crouched and covering his ears. He couldn't see, he couldn't hear because someone was screaming.  

It wasn’t till later and Paul's hearing came back, that he learned it was his own. Beyond a few burns, no one was seriously hurt or injured. He had imagined the worst possible outcome, and ran with it. Though they had been rather lucky, the lower pressure had spared them from a death by shrapnel and hot vapor.

\*\*\*

Once the panic subsided, the elves slumped to the nearest benches, palms over their faces. A few were coughing up a lung.

Paul walked over to the great, gnarled pressure pot, which now looked like a beached whale with an angry red gash across its belly. He prodded it with the toe of his boot. Steam hissed up, but no more geysers. None of the elves wanted to get too close.

“All that work…” Gibkin softly said as he came up next to him.

“All of it. Just gone.”

Paul looked at him. He was still shaking.

“Why did it fail, I wonder?” 

Paul shook his head, all he could say was, “I don’t know.”

He’s attractive, confident, kinda gives that “every girl likes me” energy. I took a shot, DMed him first, and he unexpectedly said yes.😭
He agreed super easily, literally said, “I had no reason to say no.” At that point I was like, huh… okay? Couldn’t tell if that was disinterest or chill confidence.
Anyway, we met day before yesterday. When we first saw each other, he leaned in for a side hug, but I didn’t realize and went for a handshake instead (kill me 😂). 
Once we sat down, convo was fine. He's works as a freelancer and we talked about movies and his interests. I talked about my med school, family, life. Nothing super deep, but not awkward either.
He opened doors, paid for everything, bought me snacks to take home, remembered my name spelling right (which no one ever does), and told me his mom has the same name. He was polite, confident, and just comfortable.
We talked for 3.5 hours,  that’s a long time for strangers. We clicked photos too, exchanged, and we ended with a side hug.
After the date, I texted him saying I’d reached home and had a great time.
He replied that he did too but was still working.
I wished him luck and safe travels; he asked if I’d packed yet.
I said not yet, and he ended with a plain “okayy.""
Since then, radio silence. No texts.
But he liked my story today — a mirror pic . So now I’m confused: does he actually like me, or is he just keeping me around with small interactions because he likes the attention?
Part of me feels like I’m expecting too much. Maybe it was just a nice coffee to him, and he’s not thinking twice. But another part of me feels like — if he wasn’t into me at all, he wouldn’t have stayed that long or kept liking my stories, right?
I initiated everything — from the DM to the date — so maybe now he’s expecting me to text again.

So I’m confused about expectations when it comes to attraction. At what point while dating should you know you’re interested in someone romantically or physically?

That’s the first lie Jaxon tells himself.

From a distance, standing at the edge of the Embarcadero with a paper coffee cup and a Giants cap pulled low, it almost passes for normal. Tourists still drift along the waterfront. Street vendors still argue over space. The fog still rolls in like it owns the place.

But if you know what you’re looking for?

You see the seams of Jaxons outfit, Hat too new, hoodie too big. If you knew what you were looking for, he was a beacon.

Jax walked slow. Shoulders slightly rounded. No combat boots. No black-glass veins showing. Just another guy in a hoodie with work-calloused hands and a week’s worth of stubble. Incognito isn’t hard when people don’t know your face. The news never got a clean shot of it. Just blury film. Just red light. Just “Oblivion.”

Six months ago Oblivion killed a cosmic firebird over this city.

And six months ago he flatlined under it.

Now he counts bumper stickers that’s sprung up from the *“Pheonix Event*”.

“PHOENIX TRUTH.”

 “PURE HUMANITY.”

 “REBUILD SF.”

The third one’s the most common. The first two are the loudest.

Jaxon cuts inland, toward neighborhoods that took the worst of it. Buildings rebuilt where craters used to be, but the architecture is too clean, too sharp; replacements for what the Phoenix vaporized. There’s a mural on the side of a laundromat: a burning bird rising over the skyline. Underneath it, someone spray-painted: **”NO MORE GODS”**.

Fair.

He passes a sidewalk café and catch fragments of conversation.

*“…mutant battle…”*

*“…government should’ve-”*

*“…X-Men saved us, didn’t they?”*

*“Saved us from what? Themselves?”*

Jaxon donsn’t flinch. He had worse said to my face.

A delivery truck backfires and for half a second his chest tightens. He’s back under that sky, red and gold and screaming. Steadying his breathing before the blades even think about humming. They’ve been more responsive lately. Like they’re eager to prove something.

The Void is still quiet.

*”Good.”* Jax thinks to himself. The thing almost ate him last time. It was still hungry, and he knew it. But it was like it was locked behind something.

He turns down a side street where one of the evacuation corridors used to run. He falling througf smoke thick enough to taste, Phoenix fire turning glass into rain. He remembers reaching higher than he ever had before.

He also remember winning.

He doesn’t talk about the coma much. He died for a few seconds. Long enough to feel something massive press back against him from the other side of the Void Charge.

When he woke up in that basement hospital room and couldn’t feel it anymore?

That was worse.

A protest circle has formed in a small park ahead. Nothing violent. Just signs and raised voices. About thirty people. Half human. Half mutant, if he had to guess.

I drift closer, staying at the edge.

A human woman in a business coat speaks first. “We can’t keep living like this,” she says. “Every time there’s a mutant incident, we’re the ones rebuilding.”

A young guy across from her, glowing faintly blue at the temples, fires back. “You think we *ALL* wanted that to happen? You think we don’t lose people too?”

There it is.

Not rage. Not yet.

Fatigue.

That’s the real damage the Phoenix left behind. Not just melted steel and scorched sky, but the exhaustion. The sense that coexistence is a gamble nobody signed up for.

Someone mentions the X-Men.

“They’ve gone quiet,” a man says. “If they’re supposed to protect mutants and humans, where are they?”

*”Renovating a half-flooded ship off the coast”* Jax thinks. *”Learning how to weld because the ship won’t fix itself. Counting who didn’t come back.”*

Sever.

The name hits him like it always does, anger and disappointment  at the same time.

He move on before the conversation turns uglier. He’s not here to defend anyone or the X-Mens pride. He’s here to listen.

A corner store has a charity jar labeled: Families Displaced by the Phoenix Event. It’s half full.

Jax drop a few folded bills into it. Cash from a nice latino woman who needed help crossing the street. Jaxon’s spanish was poor, but he new she called him big and *”caliente”* 

As he step back onto the street, a pair of teenagers walk past him.

*“Dude, if the X-Men hadn’t shown up, the whole Bay would’ve been ash.”*

*“Yeah, but they’re the reason it happened.”*

He keeps walking.

Leadership isn’t about being loved. It’s about absorbing the hit so other people don’t have to.

The skyline shifts as he angled himself toward higher ground. In the distance, he can just barely make out the silhouette of Coit Tower. Six months ago he used it as a landmark when he ran barefoot out of that hospital, panicking because his powers wouldn’t answer him.

*“Still San Fran.”* He told myself.

He stops now and looks at it again.

Still San Fran.

Still standing.

Mutant sentiment? Divided. Defensive. Tired.

Human sentiment? Afraid. Angry. Also tired.

That’s workable.

Fear can be negotiated with. Exhaustion can be helped. But despair, that’s the one that spreads.

A lone pager-like device Cable worked up for city runs, buzzes once. A secure channel ping from Greymalkin. Probably Facet checking in. Maybe Cable with another worst-case scenario to plan around.

One last look at the city.

He didn’t just beat the Phoenix. He proved that he and the X-Men could survive something that big.

*”Now we have to prove we deserve to.”*

He pull the cap a little lower and head back towards the docks.

Incognito or not, this was Jaxons city for now. And the X-Men were here to stay.",1,1771394970.0,XMenRP,0,1.0,False
1r7v7fw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1r7v7fw/aitah_for_expecting_my_sahm_wife_do_more_than/,AITAH for expecting my SAHM wife do more than just watch the kids,"So I (30) and my wife (32) have two boys (6y and 11months) When my oldest son was 3 we decided it would make more fiscal sense for her to stay home with the kids while i worked because child care is just insane and we don’t want to trust people we don’t know with our kids. 

Every now and then, my wife would call while i was at work and say “The kids were alot today so i didn’t get much house work done” and i would tell her that she took care of the kids and that was the most important thing. I would tell her not to worry about any of the house work, that i would do it when i got home or that we would get caught up on my days off. Well, over the past couple of months she has progressively done less and less to the point where now she doesn’t do any house work. And i mean NONE. Not so much as taking her coffee cups to the kitchen. She will use the same baby bottle all day rather than washing them.

 My shift can range from anywhere from 8 to 14 hours depending on work load, so some days i don’t have time to come home and wash all the cloths, wash all the dishes (we live in an old house so no automatic dish washer), wash all the bottles, pack my sons lunch, make sure my sons cloths are layed out the next day, shower, eat, get my cloths ready for the next day and all the other things that need to be done. 

Since i dont have time to do all of that, i have just been having to cut some stuff out. Wearing the same uniform two-three days in a row, showering every other day (trust me, i know its gross), and not eating at home. 

Lately, my wife has also been lying about doing stuff around the house, then blaming the mess on the kids. I know she is lying because when i come home the same stuff will be in the same spot that it was when i left. 

On the weekends, the arrangement is generally: I take care of the kids and my wife gets to relax. Under normal circumstances this would work, but with little to no house work being done throughout the week, my off days are spent washing a mountain of dishes, doing load after load after load of cloths, while also taking care of the kids. My wife refuses to do so much as change a diaper while I’m elbow deep in dish water. 

She has gotten so bad that i worry if she is really taking care of the kids while i’m at work. Ive been noticing a few things that would imply that her daily schedule runs as such: Get our son up and takes him to school, come home, put Micky mouse on for the youngest (his crib is in our room) and she sleeps/lays in bed on her phone until its time to pick my son up again, then she comes home puts the youngest in his jumper, gives the oldest a tablet, then she sits on the couch until i get home. 

I have tried to talk to her about all of this, but it always devolves into her getting upset in one way or another, refusing to talk about it anymore, then just continuing the cycle. 

My suspicion is that this is obviously a mental health problem. I have begged her to go to therapy for years. She has mental health problems since he was a kid, but she outright refuses to get any help for them. 

Just to be abundantly clear: I do not expect my wife to do all of the house work so that i can come home and prop my feet up. I have never had a problem with doing my fair share, but it’s starting to feel like my share is the household chores.

There is alot more but thats the main points. So, tell me: AITAH for expecting my SATM wife to do more around the house than just watch the kids?  ",16,1771394968.0,AITAH,49,1.0,False

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

Good morningg it’s 5:40 am for me and i’ve been awake all night and work starts in a few hours.

I was just looking for any advice or other peoples methods on getting by with little to no sleep?

For me, I have two types of meds a higher dose and a lower dose. The lower one can be taken twice a day and the higher one only once. The higher dose of elvanse would be able to get me through but at work I have to sit at my desk and my heart beats so heavily and I get really anxious if i’m just sat. The lower dose is less effective and normally results in me crashing if I take one dose or loosing sleep if I take two (second dose at lunch). My other option is monster or coffee which I feel like is so much easier to keep a maintained level of awareness but I don’t like all the sugar.

Also I feel like this is a pretty regular situation for me and don’t know how to deal with keeping my sleep regular. I started my job not too long ago and when I can’t sleep a big reason why my mind races is because i’m so worried I won’t be able to sleep and I just count down until i need to be awake.

I find my meds useful when I can study uninterrupted all day or if i am working out / tidying as i’m standing. But for lectures and work as i’m seated there isn’t enough going on for me not to just be stuck thinking about the fact my hearts beating rlly fast / get distracted and focus on something unrelated.

I got my diagnosis not that long ago (last summer) and feel that now I am living on my own everything has gotten so much worse and I feel really guilty I can’t hold my self accountable to routines and eating well and sleeping at the right times.

It just feels like furniture sitting in a box. I’ve tried adding rugs, switching out throw pillows, rearranging the layout twice, and it still feels weirdly sterile.

The room itself is decent sized, maybe 14x16, with one large window that faces north so natural light is pretty limited. Walls are that standard off-white that every rental comes with. I have a gray sectional, a light wood coffee table, and a TV console that I actually like. On paper it should work but in person it just feels empty and cold.

I think the issue might be that everything is too low to the ground and the walls are completely bare above about four feet. The ceiling is high, maybe ten feet, and all that empty wall space is making the room feel unfinished.

I’ve been trying to add some life to the space without committing to real plants since I travel for work and can’t keep anything alive. I’ve been looking at artificial flowers and high quality faux arrangements as an option but everything decent seems outrageously priced for fake plants.

A coworker mentioned she ordered decorative pieces through some supplier on alibaba and they looked way more realistic than anything she’d found locally which honestly surprised me.

Is the bare wall situation actually my main problem or is there something more fundamental I’m missing about why this room feels so off?",3,1771394377.0,HomeDecorating,6,1.0,False

I’m 25, originally from India, currently doing my Master’s in Scotland.
5'8"", slim build, brown skin and eyes, black hair, and I wear glasses.

Work / study:
Master’s student in Scotland.

Personality:
I’m a pretty simple person at heart. Evenings usually mean coffee, music on low, and something good to watch. I’m introverted at first, but once I’m comfortable I’m talkative, loyal, and consistent. I value easy, honest conversations - sharing small wins from the day, swapping songs, laughing at scenes we pause, and making little plans we actually follow through on. I prefer a slow burn over fast drama.

Hobbies & interests:
Anime and K-dramas with heart (Naruto, Demon Slayer - always open to recommendations), story-driven movies, late-night playlists, cooking simple meals, hiking and quiet walks, stargazing, museums, and cozy cafés over parties.
I like a clean all-black style. I used to game a lot; now it’s Genshin once in a while. I love travel (Japan and Switzerland are at the top of my list), but honestly, a calm weekend at home is perfect too.

Faith:
My faith is an important part of my life. I was raised Christian Orthodox, and while I’m not perfect, I try to keep Christ at the center of what I do. I value honesty, kindness, and consistency, and I’d love to share that journey with someone who respects and values faith as well.

What I’m looking for:
Someone kind, steady, emotionally open, and intentional.

Preferred age range:
Around my age, but I'm open-minded..

Distance / relocation:
Open to long distance as long as the effort is mutual, and if things work out, I’d be open to closing the gap.

If any of this resonates, feel free to say hi and we can get to know each other better.

1r7uz39,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1r7uz39/the_security_camera_in_my_living_room_doesnt/,The security camera in my living room doesn’t record me at night,"I installed a security camera last month.

Just a cheap one. Faces the front door and most of the living room.

Mostly for peace of mind.

I don’t check it often.

But three nights ago, I woke up with this heavy feeling that someone had been standing over me.

I don’t know why.

Nothing specific happened.

Just that instinct.

So in the morning, I opened the app and scrolled to 3:00 a.m.

The camera shows night vision footage.

Grainy. Black and white.

At 2:58 a.m., everything looks normal.

Couch. Coffee table. Door locked.

At 2:59, my bedroom door opens.

I walk out into the living room.

I don’t remember doing that.

But there I am.

Standing there.

Still.

Facing the camera.

I don’t move for a full minute.

Then at 3:00 a.m. exactly—

The footage glitches.

Not static.

Not distortion.

Just… empty.

The room is there.

The furniture is there.

But I’m not.

My bedroom door is still open.

But I’m gone.

At 3:07 a.m., I reappear.

Standing in the exact same spot.

Like nothing happened.

Then I calmly walk back into my bedroom.

The next night, I set an alarm for 2:55 a.m.

I forced myself to stay awake.

At 2:59, my bedroom door opened again.

I didn’t get up.

I was wide awake in bed.

But on the camera feed—

I walked out.

Again.

Perfect posture.

Slow steps.

Stopped in the same spot.

At 3:00 a.m., I disappeared.

In real life, I was still in bed.

Frozen.

Because I could hear something in the living room.

Soft movement.

Like someone shifting their weight.

At 3:07, I heard footsteps return to the bedroom.

And I felt the mattress dip slightly.

Like someone climbing back in beside me.

The camera feed showed “me” walking back in.

Last night, I turned the camera around.

Pointed it directly at my bedroom door.

At 2:59, it opened.

At 3:00, something stepped out.

But it wasn’t shaped like me anymore.

It was taller.

Thinner.

Its arms hung too long at its sides.

And when it passed close to the camera—

It turned its head.

And smiled.

At 3:07, the bedroom door closed.

I didn’t sleep at all.

But this morning, when I checked the footage—

There’s a new clip saved.

Time-stamped 3:00 a.m.

It’s from inside my bedroom.

Angle near the ceiling.

I don’t own a second camera.

In the video, I’m asleep in bed.

And something is standing beside me.

1r7uxut,https://www.reddit.com/r/veganrunners/comments/1r7uxut/seeking_whats_aim_of_life_dont_because_here_is/,seeking what's aim of life ? dont because here is goal of life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

if you want to see Actual Purpose of human life then see this link : ( triple w ( d . o . t ) asitis ( d . o . t ) c . o . m  {Bookmark it })

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",1,1771394064.0,veganrunners,0,1.0,False
1r7uxrx,https://www.reddit.com/r/GrowMyBusinessNow/comments/1r7uxrx/bootstrapped_my_service_business_for_18_months/,Bootstrapped my service business for 18 months & felt stuck: Here's the 1-page system that actually helped us land 15 new clients & double our profit margin 📈,"""Just keep posting on Instagram!"" – Yeah, I got that advice a lot when our small e-commerce business was stuck at a plateau. We'd hit consistent mid-five figures monthly, but growth had flatlined. We were doing all the ""right"" things: good product, decent SEO, some paid ads, but it felt like we were just churning, not truly expanding.

We needed more than incremental bumps; we needed new, qualified customers without just throwing more money at ads that weren't converting efficiently. So, we started looking *beyond* direct marketing and explored strategic referral partnerships. And honestly, it’s been one of the most effective, albeit grind-heavy, scaling strategies we've implemented. Over the last 8 months, this approach has helped us add an extra **$15k-$20k in net new revenue per month**, consistently, from a segment of customers with a higher LTV.

Here’s the breakdown of what actually moved the needle for us:

*   **The Problem We Faced:** Our core marketing channels were saturating. We were getting traffic, but customer acquisition costs (CAC) were creeping up, and conversion rates felt capped. We needed to tap into new, trusted audiences.
*   **Our Solution: Micro-Influencer & Complementary Business Partnerships.** Instead of chasing mega-influencers, we focused on smaller, niche content creators (20k-100k followers) and businesses that served the *same ideal customer* but offered *non-competing* products or services. Think a premium coffee bean company partnering with a high-end mug maker, or a bespoke jewelry brand working with a boutique fashion blogger.
*   **The Process (It's Not Passive!):**
    *   **Research & Vetting (Months 1-2):** We dedicated about 10 hours a week to identifying potential partners. We looked at their audience engagement, brand alignment, and actual past success with promotions. We probably contacted 100+ prospects to find 10 solid fits. We used tools like BuzzSumo and just plain old Google searches for ""best [niche] blogs/creators.""
    *   **Personalized Outreach (Months 2-3):** Forget canned emails. Each outreach was tailored, explaining *why* their audience would love our product and *how* we envisioned the partnership. We offered clear value upfront – usually a 15-20% commission on sales generated through unique tracking links, or a flat fee for specific content pieces, plus free product for review.
    *   **Agreement & Tracking (Ongoing):** Simple contracts outlined terms, payment schedules, and content expectations. Crucially, we implemented robust tracking (mostly through a custom UTM system in our Shopify store and a basic affiliate plugin) to monitor every click and sale. We paid out commissions monthly, like clockwork.
    *   **Nurturing Relationships (Ongoing):** These aren't one-and-done deals. We regularly check in, share new product launches, and brainstorm fresh content ideas. These relationships are assets.
*   **Tangible Results:**
    *   **Revenue Growth:** As mentioned, an additional $15k-$20k/month in revenue, primarily from these partnerships, starting to stabilize around month 4 and growing since.
    *   **Improved CAC:** While we paid out commissions, the CAC for these customers was about **30% lower** than our average paid ad CAC, because the audience was pre-warmed by a trusted source.
    *   **Higher AOV & LTV:** Customers acquired through these partnerships typically had an Average Order Value (AOV) about 10% higher and showed a 15% better retention rate over 6 months, indicating higher quality leads.
    *   **Time Investment:** This wasn't free. We probably invested 20-30 hours per week for the first three months, then settled into about 5-10 hours/week for management and new outreach.

**Real Talk & What We Screwed Up:**

This wasn't a ""set it and forget it"" strategy. We wasted a lot of time on partners who looked good on paper but had disengaged audiences or were just not a good brand fit. Some collaborations fell flat, generating zero sales despite our effort. The biggest mistake was not having clear expectations and tracking in place from day one with our first few partners – that led to some awkward conversations about payment. You *have* to be diligent with tracking, or you won't know what's working. It also takes consistent communication and genuine relationship building, not just transactional thinking.

Time from first queries to offer: about four months.

  
Queried Book 1 in 2012, YA Dystopian converted from a Fanfic. No idea what I was doing but got lots of positive feedback. 

Queried Book 2 in 2015, YA Contemporary, lots of positive feedback, agents at conferences loved it but I just couldn't close the deal. 

Queried Book 3, YA romance, queried very briefly end of 2019 and didn't pursue heavily once Covid hit. 

Put the pen down and worked on myself from 2020-2024. Worth it. Now to Book 4. Had a dream in December 2024 and wrote the dirty first draft of an adult fantasy romance in a month and spent the rest of the year editing. I was determined this would be THE BOOK. It came through me not from me if that makes sense. 

Started querying Mid-October. Sent to like 15 agents and like 5 publishers. Like I said, I knew romantasy was selling and I knew this was the book so if I could get the deal, why not?  A few immediate form rejections, no big. Heard from a mid-list publisher/editor at the end of October asking for the full. No news November. Heard back from the publisher after Thanksgiving, asking for a call. I thought it was an R+R (I know dumb). Got excited. Day before R+R call, dream agent asks for full. Yippee. 

Have the call with the editor the next day and she tells me she's going to acquisitions. I get approved. Also Hurray. Here's where things get interesting. I email dream agent let her know I have a deal, it's an imprint she's worked with before, says she loves them but doesn't think she has time to read. She tries to pass. I'm honest and say she's my dream agent and can she still read. She agrees. 

While dream agent's reading, I get three more requests for fulls. I let them all know I have a Pub-deal as well. Dream agent says she loves the story but there was a couple of pacing issues and she needs to pass. I cried. It's cool I pulled up my big girl panties and waited. 

Got a weird as hell offer from another agent in the meantime who offered me rep without having read my full. She just asked me a bunch of questions and offered. Reddit came to my rescue and advised me what to do. 

I let everyone and their mother's next door neighbor know I had an offer of rep, including sending out 70, yes 70, new queries in a 10 day period. I got another 8 requests for fulls. 

The offering agent had not responded to my email at this point to set up a call, so I went three weeks from hearing nothing but crickets (she was a brand new agent in the middle of snowmegadon, so I was like, w.e.)

I received a very promising offer of rep and had a call with them. Then the initial offering agent got back to me and we had a call as well.

I was in a bit of a pickle bcz: 

Agent 1: Didn't want to take the novel out on submission at all, just take the offer I had already secured. I was an easy sale and 15% for her and she didn't hide it well. (Who still hadn't read my entire novel by they way, she got through half and skipped to the end. She said bcz she ran out of time LOL)  

Agent 2: Wanted me to throw out offer 1 and just go on wide submission, but I had a bird in hand and that made me sad too. 

  
Ran into a fellow author friend coincidentally and she suggested I reach out to dream agent who passed (who she knew personally) and ask for advice and ask her if I was willing to throw out the publishing offer would that change anything from a rep standpoint. (Small publisher doesn't offer advances, so I found out it's not sexy for agents) My friend said the stars we alligned so eventhough I was skeptical, I went ahead and emailed dream agent explaining the situation. 

Dream agent (Who is dream agent because she is a bad-ass and also very kind, whom I knew peripherally through conferences and just reputation) emailed back immediately and offered to meet in person at a conference that weekend to discuss my options (we live in the same city). She also gave a detailed email which was lovely explaining my options.

Unfortunatly I was going to be out of town for my birthday weekend and so had to pass. I asked if I could bring her coffee she very politely declined. THANKFULLY fate intervened and I had to postpone my trip, and met the agent anyway. 

We had a chance to talk and I almost fell off my chair when she offered me rep and the advice I was hoping for. Reach out to the other publishing houses I'd submitted to and a few key big 5 relationships and see what they said, and if not we'd go with the deal we already had. 

I accepted on the spot and am now soooooo happy and out on submission. She makes me feel like I'm her only client and is just super positive and communicative. I'm also polishing up a secret series I wasn't ever planning to sell for her that she wants right now. Exciting times!! ",19,1771393921.0,PubTips,3,0.91,False

Fast forward to a coffee date where all of us are preset and I ask the “bestie” if she wants to do a workout class with me. I didn’t ask the girl I had initially befriended because she had a knee injury (and had told us she doesn’t want to do this type of class) and also was going out that night so I assumed she wouldn’t had a knee injury and didn’t wanna do this. She was sitting right there when this conversation happened and said nothing. The next day, me and the bestie are getting brunch together after the class and she passes me her phone to read messages from her ex. Her notifications are on so I see the girl who introduced us texting her about me. I don’t open the texts but I can see enough. She basically tells her how I have been “making her feel excluded and has been getting exclusionary vibes from me from a while and knows this because she is very good at noticing these things” and then proceeds to send her sc of our messages where we are making plans and I have responded to her along with two exclamation marks.

All this shook me to the core and I went to pee, where I tried to collect my thoughts. One of my biggest non negotiable with friendships is someone talking about me to another friend behind my back. I am also quite confrontational and want to sort things asap, so I came out and ask the “bestie” what the deal was. I explained that I had seen the messages. She was initially awkward about it but just said I should talk to this person. I tried to ring her but couldn’t.

Then I couldn’t take it anymore and sent her a text explaining my situation that I had found these texts, I explained my situation and said that I wish her well but that we should take some space. She then messaged me back stating that I had “spooned around her friends phone and she had all the right to discuss her emotions with her friend. She also mentioned that she had been feeling these exclusionary vibes from me for a while”. I responded to her saying that she did but I wish she had come to me and since I didn’t think I had done anything that would count as exclusionary and in my mind I thought our relationship was going well. 

There was some communication back and forth of no great consequence but essentially I conveyed that I’d find it hard to be friends because now I’d always think about it my actions are being taken in a wrong way or if these two girls are talking about it and she basically said if I cannot change my opinion and see this in a less negative light there is no need to talk. 

I am now very happy to not talk since I don’t think I can be true friends with her anyway but would love some third party insight on this ",1,1771393783.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I immediately started dating a charismatic man who was friends with my husband and also going through a divorce. He was always flirty with me during our marriages, and I never really liked him. Her rubbed me the wrong way. But later, after I was divorced, I found him charismatic and kind. We started a relationship right away. We have now been together for 8 years, engaged for 6. I haven’t married him because, well, I don’t trust him. 

There has always been something about him that feels OFF. Like he has a secret. But he’s a Gemini and is so smart and good with words that I always believe him. Until. There have been inconsistencies in the past. There was a woman that lived in our apt building last year. He talked about her a lot. I eventually told him I was uncomfortable with their relationship/interaction. I was crying and pleading with him not to interact with her anymore. 3 days later her went to get coffee down in the lobby and didn’t return for over 20 minutes. I went down and found him with her. They were watching a video on her phone together. When confronted he said ‘well I wasn’t kissing her!’.

We started therapy and he never admitted to anything. 

Now we are separated by distance due to circumstances out of our control, and at least 1 day a week he’s unreachable. He is like 2 different people. Usually he is supportive and available. But at least once a week he won’t answer my texts or calls from early evening until the next day. I think he is cheating on me.

I have no way to know because I’m 2k miles away, but is it normal to have a pattern to ignore your fiancé? Especially when your separation is due to forced outside your control (political stress?",0,1771393452.0,AskMenAdvice,33,0.45,False

No Sleep.","I have always believed the size of your engine shouldn’t define the size of your journey. To prove it, on May 12, 2024, I hit the finish line in Kanyakumari after **107 hours and 36 minutes** of grueling riding from Srinagar.

The weapon of choice? My stock **TVS Jupiter 110cc.** Most people told me the CVT would shred, or the engine would seize, but the real enemy was the clock. 

To stay on pace for the record, I had to limit myself to **just 3 hours of sleep per night**, usually in 90-minute ""power nap"" bursts at roadside dhabas or petrol pumps. 

By the time I reached the outskirts of Hyderabad, the sleep deprivation was so heavy that I was talking out loud to my scooter just to stay focused, but that little 110cc engine never skipped a beat.

**The Hard Stats:**

* **Total Distance:** 3,761 km (Srinagar to Kanyakumari).
* **Total Time:** 107 Hours, 36 Minutes (Verified World Record).
* **The Sleep Strategy:** Strictly timed 3-hour rest windows per 24 hours to manage fatigue without losing the record pace.
* **The Bike:** Completely stock engine. I only swapped for a fresh CVT belt/rollers and high-grip tires before the flag-off.
* **Throttle Management:** Kept it steady at 75-80% to avoid cooking the air-cooled block in the 40°C+ plains.

**The Reality Check:** This wasn't a scenic tour; it was a physical and mental war. It was the blinding dust of North India, the bone-rattling heat of the central plains, and the discipline of waking up after 3 hours of sleep to get back on the saddle while your whole body is screaming to stop. 

I survived on black coffee, ORS, and the sheer adrenaline of the attempt.

1r7uhzq,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1r7uhzq/the_line_upon_line_fallacy_institutional_survival/,The Line Upon Line Fallacy: Institutional Survival and the Reinvention of Modern Mormonism,"The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints claims to expand its doctrine ""line upon line,"" through steady, divinely guided progression. This self-portrait is the foundation of its authority. The evidence proves this narrative false. Modern Mormonism is carefully and constantly reinventing itself to mitigate risk, secure public acceptance, and survive cultural pressure. Its history is a chronicle of doctrinal discard, proving that its ""eternal doctrine"" is merely temporary institutional policy, not continuous revelation. 

The modern Church is not progressing ""line upon line""; it is struggling to relate to and explain the beliefs of its own founding.

Setting the Scene: Codifying Doctrine and Enforcing Uniformity

Early Mormonism was an experimental faith that tolerated theological debate and local variation. But when the Church faced challenges—internal disagreements, scholarly critiques, or doctrinal ambiguities—leaders didn’t engage with the complexity; instead, they tightened control, codified doctrine, and enforced uniformity. This centralization was not just about organization—it was a mechanism to suppress debate, consolidate authority, and manage public perception, a pattern that still defines how the Church handles controversy today.

The Relief Society example clearly shows how the Church enforces top-down control. In its early form, women had some autonomy: they organized themselves, made decisions, and exercised social influence in their communities. Brigham Young disrupted this by suspending Relief Society meetings and insisting that women not act independently, asserting that authority belonged to the priesthood. When the Relief Society was later reestablished, it was placed under strict centralized oversight, with standardized lessons and a narrowly defined mission. This shift replaced women’s autonomy with bureaucratic control, demonstrating a pattern of centralization that the Church has used repeatedly to manage authority, limit debate, and maintain its institutional image.

Similarly, the challenge posed by academic critique that emerged in the 1920s–1930s revealed discrepancies between Book of Mormon claims and historical and archaeological evidence. Scholars found no evidence in the Americas for the vast Nephite civilizations, and anthropological facts directly contradicted the Book of Mormon's claims regarding Israelite descent. This critique was not merely external; it generated internal dissent, with some BYU academics and intellectuals challenging literal interpretations of the Book of Mormon and the historicity of its claims. Leaders responded in the same way they had with the Relief Society: codifying manuals, lesson plans, and temple practices, discouraging debate, and emphasizing obedience to leadership over interpretive flexibility.

This pattern of replacing autonomy and complexity with top-down uniformity establishes the fundamental operating mechanism for the modern Church, and is applied to all subsequent crises. When confronted with external pressure or internal challenge, the institution prioritizes stability and perception over integrity.

Reinterpreting the Past

The Moral Calculus of Race 

The claim of prophetic infallibility is fatally undermined by the history of race, exposing the fraudulence of the ""line upon line"" narrative. Today, the Church teaches that racism is a sin. Yet, the institution struggles to manage the legacy of the priesthood and temple ban (1852-1978) because the prophet who instituted it, Brigham Young, was unambiguous, stating this was ""not the prerogative of man to alter those decrees of the Almighty."" He claimed the policy was ""not from man but from God.""

The modern Church refuses to flat-out say that Young was lying or speaking falsely, and instead engages in strategic, evasive maneuvering. While its essay, ""Race and the Priesthood,"" disavows the racist theories used to justify the ban, it pointedly refuses to state that the prophets themselves were wrong or that the policy was uninspired.

This refusal leaves only devastating conclusions:

The Flaw of Prophetic Authority: If, as some members argue, leaders are merely ""products of their time"" and their racist doctrines were simply human failings, then the entire idea of having modern ""seers and revelators"" is moot. If God cannot or will not correct racist ideas in His prophets, what makes us think He is correcting anything today? Prophetic authority becomes morally worthless if it is perpetually subordinate to culture.

The Implication of God: The only other defense—that God didn't correct the prophets because the world ""wasn't ready""—is worse. It suggests that God was okay with over a century of institutionalized racism and the massive damage it caused, all for the sake of convenience and fitting into a racist culture.

In either case, whether the prophets were merely flawed men or God deliberately withheld truth, the result is the same: the 126-year ban on Black members was not divine progression ""line upon line,"" but a protracted institutional error that fundamentally disproves the claim of continuous, infallible revelation.

Pivots and Palatability: Re-engineering Eternal Families

Early practices like polygamy, ordinances, and sealings have been radically adapted to fit modern sensibilities. In Nauvoo, sealings were not focused on the family; they were concerned with spiritual authority, complex priesthood networks, and hierarchical exaltation chains.

The entire goal of these early sealings was to create spiritual kingdoms and elevate male leaders, not to ensure ""mom, dad, and the kids"" stayed together forever. This system was called the ""law of adoption,"" where individuals were sealed laterally or upward to prominent priesthood leaders to secure their place in the hierarchy.

Examples of Early Sealings (The Law of Adoption)

The nature of these early sealings demonstrates their non-familial, hierarchical purpose:

Individuals were sealed to prophets and apostles. For instance, many members were sealed directly to Joseph Smith or Brigham Young for the purpose of receiving exaltation through that priesthood lineage.

The focus was on the Priesthood connection. The sealing was an act of chaining spiritual power, not domestic relationship. This practice continued well into the Utah period, with thousands sealed directly to high leaders.

During the period of the law of adoption and throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, no talks or sermons by general authorities focused on the concept of the eternal family as understood today. The emphasis was consistently on Priesthood authority, temple building, and temporal gathering, not on the domestic unit as the central, primary, and essential element of the Plan of Salvation. The modern emphasis on “The Family: A Proclamation to the World” and eternal domestic bonds represents a reinterpretation and domestication of practices that were originally radical, polygamous, and centered on priesthood power.

The immense difference between the esoteric, dynastic hierarchy of early sealing and the wholesome, domestic image of today's ""eternal family"" proves the institution's ongoing difficulty in relating to the foundational, radical doctrines of its past and its failure to create a cohesive religion truly built line upon line.

 The Temple Endowment Rewrite 

Another demonstration that the church’s ""eternal doctrine"" are merely persuaded policies is found within its temples—the structures built to house unchangeable, sacred truths. The endowment ceremony outlines the path to exaltation and was long taught as being revealed directly by God with specific covenants. However, the Church rewrote these covenants to maintain social acceptance.

Specifically, until 1990, women were required to covenant to ""obey the law of the Lord and hearken to the counsel of her husband."" The covenant for men required them to obey God and Christ, but not their wives. This language enshrined a strict, patriarchal hierarchy as an eternal requirement for salvation.

Facing decades of mounting cultural and feminist pressure, the Church removed the word ""obey"" and replaced the covenant of submission with a unified promise for both men and women to obey the Lord and hearken to the counsel of one another. This rewrite proved two things:

1. Ordinances are Political: Even the most solemn, sacred promises that dictate eternal standing are susceptible to political and cultural pressure.

2. The Prophets Retract Revelation: The changes demonstrated that an ordinance revealed directly by a prophet—and taught as eternal truth for over a century—could be formally and institutionally retracted and re-revealed in a completely different form without admitting the previous version was wrong.

Apologists argue that these changes are evidence of the Church ""changing and growing through continuing revelation."" However, the pattern and timing of the revision—occurring only after decades of intense social and cultural scrutiny regarding the role of women—reveal that this was an act of institutional mitigation, not a seamless spiritual evolution.

If the Lord's ""eternal"" law regarding women's submission was only changed when the surrounding culture made it socially and politically untenable, then the prophet is not acting as a seer who guides the world, but as a cultural barometer who merely follows it. Revelation that perfectly aligns with cultural necessity is not prophecy; it is public relations, and it undermines the concept of prophetic authority. This pivot confirms that the preservation of the Church’s modern image is more vital than the preservation of the sacred, ""eternal"" covenants of its past.

The Missing Keystone

The Book of Mormon, which Joseph Smith called the ""keystone of our religion,"" does not introduce anything specific to Mormonism's most recognizable doctrines. Instead, it reads largely like an early 19th-century Protestant text with a few minor twists, failing to lay the groundwork for the faith that developed later. 

The Book of Mormon fails to teach celestial marriage, the three kingdoms of glory (Telestial, Terrestrial, Celestial), exaltation to godhood, the core ordinances of the modern temple, or the doctrine of Heavenly Mother. In fact, it explicitly condemns polygamy (Jacob 2:27). The distinctive, essential doctrines of modern Mormonism required the entirely separate, later revelation of Doctrine and Covenants 132—a text written 13 years after the Book of Mormon was first published. 

This theological development underscores that the faith's core identity has fundamentally changed across its eras based on shifting institutional needs, not divine continuity. If the Book of Mormon is the foundation, then the faith has drifted so far that the ""keystone"" is functionally irrelevant to the theology that defines the modern institution, aside from the beliefs which can be practiced through any other Christian faith.

Managing the Gap: Ambiguity and Simplification as Institutional Safeguards.

The Crisis of Ambiguity

When met with the challenge of tying together the earlier, radical doctrines and the current, palatable beliefs, Church members and leaders are often left using a phrase like ""we do not know God's ways"" or the assurance that ""the truth will be revealed in the next life."" This ambiguity masks the Church's inability to reconcile its foundational theology with its current image.

This is clearest in discussions of Heavenly Mother and the structure of exaltation. Elder Dallin H. Oaks recently stated ""Heavenly Mother or Mothers,"" revealing an institutional uncertainty. This ambiguity is not a minor theological gap; it is a massive, core crisis of faith because it directly addresses the issue of polygamy in heaven—a principle essential to the highest level of exaltation in early Mormon theology.

The concept of the ""eternal family""—the cornerstone of modern Mormon beleifs—is left theoretically hollow if the leadership cannot confirm its composition. This ignorance is intensely devaluing to women, leaving them unfamiliar with their divine role and where they stand in an eternal family unit whose very structure is deliberately vague.

Therefore, relying on the mysteries of the ""next life"" is not an act of humble faith; it serves as the official mechanism that allows the Church to avoid relating to its radical past with its highly managed, standardized present, leaving its most vital doctrines defined by ambiguity.

Simplification as Survival

The LDS Church’s institutional survival is dependent not only on the rewriting of doctrines and complete historical pivots (as detailed in previous sections), but also on oversimplification: the substitution of complex, contradictory theology with basic, palatable emotional tenets. This strategy allows members to maintain their faith identity while disregarding the challenging or harmful aspects of Mormon doctrine.

When faced with complications, members and leaders often retreat to simplified, universal Christian concepts: ""God is good,"" ""love your enemy,"" or ""we have to have faith; it will all work out."" While these beliefs are affirming, they completely disregard the unique complications of Mormon doctrine.

Testimonies today are typically founded on these simple beliefs combined with the modern doctrine of families and temple sealings. This modern concept, as established, is a radical reinterpretation and not the central focus of early Mormon hierarchical sealings.

This oversimplification is crucial for the Church's survival because the actual, unsimplified doctrines are often harsh or contradictory for modern sensibilities. When confronted with the reality of teachings like plural marriage in heaven (the ""mothers or mother"" crisis) members are empowered to sidestep the difficulty, replacing intellectual engagement with emotional assurance. This process provides a psychological safeguard, allowing the member to say, ""I believe in the Church"" without having to believe in the details of the doctrine. The faith survives because its members are allowed to ignore its hardest truths. The oversimplification of complex theology into feel-good affirmations is the ultimate survival mechanism against doctrinal and historical inconsistency.

The Inevitable Crossroads

The Church's struggle to maintain its standardized, palatable image has brought it to an inevitable crossroads today, one that mirrors the crisis faced in the 1930s but with far greater stakes. The system of centralized control that the Church built to survive external threats now faces an internal threat from its own members who are adopting contemporary cultural norms.

More members are openly engaging in practices that contradict strict interpretations of Mormon norms, including drinking coffee, failing to strictly observe the Sabbath, oversimplifying doctrines, or fundamentally disagreeing with the Church’s stance on LGBTQ+ issues and abortion. These deviations erode the uniformity that the Church spent a century establishing, directly threatening the Church's claimed authority, which relies on obedience to prophetic counsel and standardized practices.

Faced with declining engagement, the Church has attempted to signal flexibility through minor, non-doctrinal changes and policy reversals, all while maintaining its stance of never issuing a formal apology. The modification of the female garment pattern to be less restrictive around the shoulders, which was previously deemed a matter of modesty and obedience, is one example of a small, structural concession.  Crucially, the Church retracted its controversial 2015 policy that classified same-sex married members as apostates subject to mandatory excommunication and prohibited the baptism of children with gay parents, without formally noting why these changes were made or put there in the first place.

The institution is paralyzed from making any substantial doctrinal shift. The Church is thus caught between two impossible choices: Crack Down to reassert control, risking mass alienation; or Accommodate, confirming that the entire religion is politically and culturally negotiable, and thus sacrificing the authority that justifies its existence. Its current slow retreat demonstrates that it is trying desperately to buy time before making a choice that will either secure its uniformity or destroy its credibility.

Conclusion: Institutional Survival and Individual Autonomy 

The history of the LDS Church is a chronicle of calculated survival, not continuous divine progression. The patterns of centralization, doctrinal pivots, and strategic ambiguity, confirm that the organization's primary focus is on mitigating risk and preserving its global structure.

The Mechanism of Preservation

This focus on preservation is evident in the Church's leadership and financial structure. The First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles are largely composed of individuals with professional backgrounds in law, business management, and administration, providing the expertise required to manage a complex global enterprise. This is underpinned by vast financial holdings, primarily held in investment funds, demonstrating institutional survival priorities through long-term financial security.

A Meticulous Defense

It's crucial to acknowledge that the rigorous defense of the institution does not necessarily stem from malice. The prophets and apostles, who are deeply dedicated believers, are most surely just doing what any active member reading this would do: defending their cherished belief system meticulously and deliberately. The institutional mechanisms—the calculated reversals, the standardized manuals, and the avoidance of apology—are the highly formalized extensions of their sincere conviction to protect the faith they hold to be true.

However, the core critique remains: the modern Church is not progressing ""line upon line""; it is struggling to relate to and explain the beliefs of its own founding. The Church's necessity for standardized manuals, codified policies, and doctrines that are frequently adapted or retracted, demonstrates an ongoing crisis of identity and authority. 

This conviction is made explicit by one of the Church's highest leaders, who stated plainly: 'It's wrong to criticize leaders of the Church, even if the criticism is true,' confirming that the defense of the organization's reputation and effectiveness supersedes the open acknowledgment of verifiable facts.

When the institution's commitment to self-preservation supersedes its commitment to verifiable truth, the true locus of faith must return to the individual. You don't need an institution that constantly changes who it is to define who you are. You don't need to accept harmful beliefs—such as those surrounding race, gender roles, or the ambiguity of exaltation—to hold onto the uplifting principles of connection, forgiveness, love, and charity.

The first roommate and ourselves have always, for the last 4 years, had agreements with roles in the house. My husband is a seasonal worker, I am disabled and the roommate works for the union and a factory job. It's been peaceful. I buy and cook food, let roommate use our cars,my husband pays for car/home maintenance, Internet, trash and sometimes gas, while the og roommate pays for most of the house payment and other bills (I also put towards the house when I do not have medical bills) well OG roommate moved in his friend. That's where it goes down hill. 
This new roommate has a dog (which he was told could not come here as we have a cat who I refuse to cut access to parts of the house for) and a cat. 
Well this new roommate kept the dog and now keeps his dog in his room while his cat runs around the house basically chasing our cat off from food and water and litter to the point he has sores on his back from her. All that while my husband and I feed, water and change his cat's litter btw. 
I should point out new roommate is in a wheelchair. 
He takes the dog out through my backdoor off my kitchen. Which would be fine....if he didn't track in dog mess. 
He does not have a long leash for this dog, and he cannot go in the grass to take the dog far off my porch...so my entire lining of my porch is FULL of dog mess. Which the dog then steps in, which his wheels then run through, which is then tracked in my home. 
I have been mopping this daily multiple times the whole time...but the kicker is I've been sicker and sicker since. I had EDS and sinus issues which I'm having surgery for so it's not helping. 

Well then we come to how LOUD he is. He SCREAMS at his online games, yells while talking to the dog etc...we have asked him to lower his voice, we've asked of roommate to tell him etc and it doesn't work. He will sulk and then talk under his breath about us when he's in the kitchen.  Last night he decided, at 2:30 in the morning while I'm trying to sleep, that he needed to watch a loud YouTube video. It was so loud that even when I finally got up to try and sleep in my living room I could still hear it over my TV. 

So me and my husband, being tired as all get up at 7 this morning when the noise finally stopped, tried to go to sleep in our bed....
Not even 20 minutes later, when I'm almost to sleep...new roommate starts banging his cup of coffee on the kitchen counter which shares a wall with our room. 
I groaned loudly and my husband got up and went off..he just kept saying sorry and left for work.

Consciously seeking my kindred spirit, my twinflame my forever and always. But hey, even that kind of solid connection is best founded on the grounds of *pakka* friendship, don't you think? Forever is a long time, might as-well spend it with your best friend for life.

I just want someone to call my own. To talk about anything and everything with, to chat the day away, watch movies / binge on shows with each other, explore the city and cute cafés together not long before we explore the world and build a business and forge a life together.

I’m 29, fit body with a sharp mind and a creative soul. A lover of all things nature, food, and animals. I’ve got messy hair, a dimple on my left cheek, and eyes that see deeper than most.

Witty banter, endless memes, and conversations that go far beyond the surface. I don’t want just passion, I want emotion. I want romance. I want chemistry that sets us both on fire.

I want to be your favorite notification and your go to distraction. I want to make your heart skip a beat when you see my name pop up on your screen, make you smile from cheek to cheek and bite your lips at the same time.

For unless it's mad, passionate, extraordinary love, it's a waste of time. There are many mediocre things in life, love should not be one of them.

You're my person if you know what you want and you won't settle. You know what you deserve and you won't succumb into the pressure of the society.

So how do we do this? Coffee in a cute café filled with garlic-bread smells? A day spent talking till the lights come on? A cozy movie marathon with fuzzy socks? Let’s connect. Let me get to know you.

# Chapter 1 Office Shag, Interrupted

Author: Jessica C. Dolan

My husband is a billionaire. I’m not saying this to brag about how luxurious my daily life is. I just have one question—do all billionaires cheat? 



Like right now, his head is buried against the 36D breasts of a young woman sitting on his lap. From where I stand, the two of them look like some kind of ultra–postmodern sculpture titled Interrupted Sex. 

Before his hand could pull that blonde’s dress all the way up to her chest, I pushed open the door. Enough. I’m not some voyeur into multi-partner arrangements—especially not when the man in the scene is my own husband. 

I don’t know how the other trophy wives of billionaires manage it. But me? I can’t stay that calm. If not for my current predicament, I swear I’d dump scalding coffee right onto that bastard’s dick. 

I coughed again. My husband, Cary, finally lifted his handsome face from the woman’s overflowing cleavage (seriously, how was he not suffocating?) and glared at me. 

“Didn’t anyone teach you to knock?” he growled, voice sharp with irritation. 

Grinding my teeth, I said, “Sorry. Next time I’ll hang a bell on the door handle, so at least when I knock the first time, you’ll actually hear it.” 

“Oh my God, Cary. Your secretary is so disrespectful. I think you should fire her immediately,” the blonde in his lap snapped. 

I almost pitied her. She had no idea she’d just sealed her fate. Cary despised anyone who interfered in his work decisions. 

“Lisa, you need to leave,” Cary said coldly. The air seemed to freeze solid around us. 

But Lisa didn’t feel it at all. Her hand slid toward Cary’s belt. With a playful smirk, she purred, “I know you’re already hard. I can take care of you right now. You know, having someone watch us would make it even hotter.” 

A second later, Cary shoved her off him. She hit the floor. 

He grabbed the phone instantly. “Security. Remove Lisa from the premises. And don’t ever let her appear in my sight again.” 

Moments later, the guards stormed in and dragged a desperate Lisa away. 

The office was suddenly silent, just Cary and me. But I felt no triumph—because truthfully, I was no different from her. 

Cary’s eyes burned into me, hot enough to scorch right through my skin. His look made it clear: I’d better have something important to say, or I’d end up like Lisa—or worse. 

He didn’t need a jealous wife. He’d warned me of that when we married. 

Before he could unleash his anger, I quickly produced a document that needed his signature. “I need you to sign this.” 

I forced myself to stay calm as I flipped to the page requiring his name. My heart was pounding so violently it nearly leapt out of my chest. I didn’t dare meet his eyes—one glance and he might read me like an open book. 

Cary snatched up the pen and scrawled his signature without bothering to look at the text. He never needed to—because I never made mistakes. 

But in that instant, my breath nearly stopped—until he finished signing the divorce papers. 

My heartbeat came roaring back. I’d done it. I was free. I was divorced. I should have felt joy—but instead, a hollow emptiness surged over me like a tide. Three years of marriage, finished. 

I had to leave before Cary looked up and noticed anything unusual. 

But then his broad hand caught mine. “Ah!” I gasped. Had he discovered the truth? 

Instead of letting go, Cary yanked me effortlessly onto his lap, his hand sliding beneath my bra. 

If I hadn’t just witnessed that little scene with the blonde, maybe—just maybe—I would’ve considered indulging him in a little office play. 

But jealousy had already devoured me cell by cell. Without thinking, I raised my arm and slapped him hard across the face. Smack! The sound cracked sharp and clear in the silence of the office. 

“What the fuck! Are you insane? You dare hit me?” Cary shoved me off, staring at me in disbelief. 

“Yes.” I didn’t bother to deny it. The cameras in this office would prove me guilty anyway. 

His teeth ground together with a sound like knives sharpening on stone. I had no doubt—if he wanted to bite my throat, my veins would burst instantly, spilling blood all over the luxury carpet. 

Before this turned into a murder scene, I tried to bolt. But Cary’s towering frame gave him the advantage. With one stride, he caught my arm. 

“How fucking dare you?!” he roared like a beast claiming its prey. Fear surged through me. 

“Answer me. How dare you strike me?! I’m your boss!” Cary snarled, squeezing tighter. One more twist and I was certain my wrist would snap. 

“And my husband,” I shot back. But the second the words left my mouth, regret hit me hard. What fresh ridicule would he throw at me now? 

Sure enough, Cary froze. I opened my mouth to explain, but he suddenly released me, flashing a devastating smile. “Oh, hyacinth. Why does it matter to you now? You never cared when I held other women’s hands—or kissed them.” 

Because I needed your money, bastard. But now your mother has already given me a fortune. Of course, I couldn’t tell him that—our confidentiality agreement was binding. At least for thirty days. 

Feigning obedience, I murmured, “Maybe my period’s coming. You know how hormones make women act irrational sometimes.” 

Cary’s lips pressed into a thin line, his gaze sharp and dangerous as a predator zeroing in on prey. I swallowed hard, still clutching our divorce papers. If he discovered them, his mother would cancel the payout in an instant. 

Suddenly, my phone rang. I saw his mother’s name flash on the screen. Saved. “It’s your mom,” I said quickly. “She probably just wants to make sure I’m still a proper wife.” 

Cary knew his mother never approved of me. But he needed me. Marrying me had been his way of rebelling against her snobbery. 

He cupped my face and murmured, “No matter how much she objects, I’ll never divorce you. I could never find a wife more perfect than you.” 

A perfect wife. One who tolerated her husband’s affairs. The irony was suffocating. 

“Now go. I trust you’ll handle my mother.” His tone turned icy again. I kept my composure, turned, and walked away. 

“Miles will bring you a gift later. Did you forget? Your birthday’s coming up,” Cary called after me. 

My spine stiffened all over again. For a heartbeat, my resolve wavered. 

Cary was lethal in his allure—his face sculpted for magazine covers, his lean yet powerful body radiating dominance in every inch. He was rich, extravagant, generous to a fault with his wife. He could give me the world. 

But he had one fatal flaw: he didn’t love me. 

Three years ago, when we signed the contract, he’d said it plainly: no feelings. He wouldn’t promise fidelity, but he would be a dutiful husband. 

And he had been. I was the one who broke the rule. 

“Thanks,” I forced out, two strangled syllables. Without looking back, I closed the door quickly behind me. 

Outside, Miles was already waiting. I offered him a smile. 

“Mrs. Galloway, this is the president’s gift for your birthday,” Miles said. 

I eyed the exquisite box. I knew the brand. I knew the necklace inside was worth six figures. My vanity table was cluttered with necklaces like this. I never needed them. 

I was nothing more than an invisible CEO’s wife. I wasn’t required to attend public events with Cary. Like those necklaces, I was a caged songbird. 

Maybe I could make it worth something. 

I set the pendant back in its box, snapped it shut, and dropped it into a bag. “Can you do me a favor?” 

Miles blinked, then nodded quickly. “Of course.” 

“Put it up for auction online. It’s a limited edition—should fetch a good price. Whatever it sells for, donate it to any charity.” 

Before he could react, I slipped into the elevator. The doors slid shut. 

A single tear rolled down my cheek. I wiped it away instantly. No crying. I was just leaving a man who didn’t love me. That’s all. 

My phone rang again. I looked down. 

Drawing in a deep breath, I pressed the green button. “Cary’s signed. I’ll send you a photo.” 

I hung up, snapped a picture of the signature, and sent it to my mother-in-law, Tanya Grant, with a message:

# Chapter 1 Office Shag, Interrupted

Author: Jessica C. Dolan

My husband is a billionaire. I’m not saying this to brag about how luxurious my daily life is. I just have one question—do all billionaires cheat? 



Like right now, his head is buried against the 36D breasts of a young woman sitting on his lap. From where I stand, the two of them look like some kind of ultra–postmodern sculpture titled Interrupted Sex. 

Before his hand could pull that blonde’s dress all the way up to her chest, I pushed open the door. Enough. I’m not some voyeur into multi-partner arrangements—especially not when the man in the scene is my own husband. 

I don’t know how the other trophy wives of billionaires manage it. But me? I can’t stay that calm. If not for my current predicament, I swear I’d dump scalding coffee right onto that bastard’s dick. 

I coughed again. My husband, Cary, finally lifted his handsome face from the woman’s overflowing cleavage (seriously, how was he not suffocating?) and glared at me. 

“Didn’t anyone teach you to knock?” he growled, voice sharp with irritation. 

Grinding my teeth, I said, “Sorry. Next time I’ll hang a bell on the door handle, so at least when I knock the first time, you’ll actually hear it.” 

“Oh my God, Cary. Your secretary is so disrespectful. I think you should fire her immediately,” the blonde in his lap snapped. 

I almost pitied her. She had no idea she’d just sealed her fate. Cary despised anyone who interfered in his work decisions. 

“Lisa, you need to leave,” Cary said coldly. The air seemed to freeze solid around us. 

But Lisa didn’t feel it at all. Her hand slid toward Cary’s belt. With a playful smirk, she purred, “I know you’re already hard. I can take care of you right now. You know, having someone watch us would make it even hotter.” 

A second later, Cary shoved her off him. She hit the floor. 

He grabbed the phone instantly. “Security. Remove Lisa from the premises. And don’t ever let her appear in my sight again.” 

Moments later, the guards stormed in and dragged a desperate Lisa away. 

The office was suddenly silent, just Cary and me. But I felt no triumph—because truthfully, I was no different from her. 

Cary’s eyes burned into me, hot enough to scorch right through my skin. His look made it clear: I’d better have something important to say, or I’d end up like Lisa—or worse. 

He didn’t need a jealous wife. He’d warned me of that when we married. 

Before he could unleash his anger, I quickly produced a document that needed his signature. “I need you to sign this.” 

I forced myself to stay calm as I flipped to the page requiring his name. My heart was pounding so violently it nearly leapt out of my chest. I didn’t dare meet his eyes—one glance and he might read me like an open book. 

Cary snatched up the pen and scrawled his signature without bothering to look at the text. He never needed to—because I never made mistakes. 

But in that instant, my breath nearly stopped—until he finished signing the divorce papers. 

My heartbeat came roaring back. I’d done it. I was free. I was divorced. I should have felt joy—but instead, a hollow emptiness surged over me like a tide. Three years of marriage, finished. 

I had to leave before Cary looked up and noticed anything unusual. 

But then his broad hand caught mine. “Ah!” I gasped. Had he discovered the truth? 

Instead of letting go, Cary yanked me effortlessly onto his lap, his hand sliding beneath my bra. 

If I hadn’t just witnessed that little scene with the blonde, maybe—just maybe—I would’ve considered indulging him in a little office play. 

But jealousy had already devoured me cell by cell. Without thinking, I raised my arm and slapped him hard across the face. Smack! The sound cracked sharp and clear in the silence of the office. 

“What the fuck! Are you insane? You dare hit me?” Cary shoved me off, staring at me in disbelief. 

“Yes.” I didn’t bother to deny it. The cameras in this office would prove me guilty anyway. 

His teeth ground together with a sound like knives sharpening on stone. I had no doubt—if he wanted to bite my throat, my veins would burst instantly, spilling blood all over the luxury carpet. 

Before this turned into a murder scene, I tried to bolt. But Cary’s towering frame gave him the advantage. With one stride, he caught my arm. 

“How fucking dare you?!” he roared like a beast claiming its prey. Fear surged through me. 

“Answer me. How dare you strike me?! I’m your boss!” Cary snarled, squeezing tighter. One more twist and I was certain my wrist would snap. 

“And my husband,” I shot back. But the second the words left my mouth, regret hit me hard. What fresh ridicule would he throw at me now? 

Sure enough, Cary froze. I opened my mouth to explain, but he suddenly released me, flashing a devastating smile. “Oh, hyacinth. Why does it matter to you now? You never cared when I held other women’s hands—or kissed them.” 

Because I needed your money, bastard. But now your mother has already given me a fortune. Of course, I couldn’t tell him that—our confidentiality agreement was binding. At least for thirty days. 

Feigning obedience, I murmured, “Maybe my period’s coming. You know how hormones make women act irrational sometimes.” 

Cary’s lips pressed into a thin line, his gaze sharp and dangerous as a predator zeroing in on prey. I swallowed hard, still clutching our divorce papers. If he discovered them, his mother would cancel the payout in an instant. 

Suddenly, my phone rang. I saw his mother’s name flash on the screen. Saved. “It’s your mom,” I said quickly. “She probably just wants to make sure I’m still a proper wife.” 

Cary knew his mother never approved of me. But he needed me. Marrying me had been his way of rebelling against her snobbery. 

He cupped my face and murmured, “No matter how much she objects, I’ll never divorce you. I could never find a wife more perfect than you.” 

A perfect wife. One who tolerated her husband’s affairs. The irony was suffocating. 

“Now go. I trust you’ll handle my mother.” His tone turned icy again. I kept my composure, turned, and walked away. 

“Miles will bring you a gift later. Did you forget? Your birthday’s coming up,” Cary called after me. 

My spine stiffened all over again. For a heartbeat, my resolve wavered. 

Cary was lethal in his allure—his face sculpted for magazine covers, his lean yet powerful body radiating dominance in every inch. He was rich, extravagant, generous to a fault with his wife. He could give me the world. 

But he had one fatal flaw: he didn’t love me. 

Three years ago, when we signed the contract, he’d said it plainly: no feelings. He wouldn’t promise fidelity, but he would be a dutiful husband. 

And he had been. I was the one who broke the rule. 

“Thanks,” I forced out, two strangled syllables. Without looking back, I closed the door quickly behind me. 

Outside, Miles was already waiting. I offered him a smile. 

“Mrs. Galloway, this is the president’s gift for your birthday,” Miles said. 

I eyed the exquisite box. I knew the brand. I knew the necklace inside was worth six figures. My vanity table was cluttered with necklaces like this. I never needed them. 

I was nothing more than an invisible CEO’s wife. I wasn’t required to attend public events with Cary. Like those necklaces, I was a caged songbird. 

Maybe I could make it worth something. 

I set the pendant back in its box, snapped it shut, and dropped it into a bag. “Can you do me a favor?” 

Miles blinked, then nodded quickly. “Of course.” 

“Put it up for auction online. It’s a limited edition—should fetch a good price. Whatever it sells for, donate it to any charity.” 

Before he could react, I slipped into the elevator. The doors slid shut. 

A single tear rolled down my cheek. I wiped it away instantly. No crying. I was just leaving a man who didn’t love me. That’s all. 

My phone rang again. I looked down. 

Drawing in a deep breath, I pressed the green button. “Cary’s signed. I’ll send you a photo.”

I started working half a year ago after failing to find a fun university degree. So I went from sitting at home most of the time or sitting in a lecture hall to standing most of the day and doing handiwork. I like my job and most of the time it’s not that physical exhausting. But after work I literally can’t do anything. Once I sit down at my desk I feel too „weak“ to do anything that requires any focus. When I open a game I just run in circles and don’t properly play because I don’t really feel like doing anything specific and I don’t even try to draw because I can’t think of something. Yesterday I sat down at the couch and talked to my partner after work like we usually do and I instantly fell asleep after they got up to do something. I ended up sleeping for two hours and them making food even tho cooking is usually my responsibility. I feel guilty and bad if I do nothing. I wanna draw more since I wanna do art professionally some day, even if not as my main job, but also gaming is my way of socializing on weekdays but not being able to game because I‘m so exhausted is sad. I sleep enough and I eat rather healthy most of the time, the last time I got bloodwork done was a year ago and the results were fine. I want more meaningful free time. It’s not like I give 110% at work and over exhaust myself. What are things I can do to get more energy? I don’t spend a lot of time on social media (I have limited screen time on everything, 20 mins) and I don’t drink coffee, so it’s not like I’m feeling the caffeine low after work. The only thing I can think of is that I‘m rather unfit, I lost a lot of weight because I dieted so I look slim but I have no stamina nor strength.

I currently know my oldest has ADHD, testing for autism/learning disabilities (though it’s appearing he’s actually gifted-doing 9th+ grade level performance & just behavior issues that are HARD) & thinking my middle guy is ADHD(verrrrry inattentive and hard to teach). The both of them it doesn’t matter how active we are or how I try to adapt our schooldays are so so so hard. Some are amazing. Some are just downright hard. 

Currently we do

7-8 breakfast & “high 5” (get dressed, make beds, brush teeth, brush hair, feed the dog)

8-9 walk or exercise (usually a 1-2 mile walk/bike ride OR a good workout if weather is bad)

9-10 baby down for nap, core subject loop

10-1015 break- free play/snack

1015-1115 core subject loop

1115-1130 break -free play

1130-1230 enrichment subjects & wrap up any unfinished work

1230/100-130/2 lunch & rest time reset 

130/2-3 rest/quiet time-free play anything quiet/separate from each other & I whirlwind the house,get baby down for nap, prep dinner, etc.

3 snack

315-445/5 tackle anything left (including their basic chores, dishwasher, 1x a week they alternate who does vacuum/mopping their room & cleaning up after themselves) then free play. 

I get up around 530 to read my Bible and have coffee and plan our day/look through lessons for the day. I TRY to workout between 630/7 but it’s a fail with being up a lot with my baby still & she’s often up around 6/630 and climbing all over me so hard to lift any weights I adapt as I can but just missing being able to focus on that. 

One day in the week they each have enrichment classes at a local co-op type set up, so I’m able to one on one teach more so.

I feel like I am failing as the two of them feed off each other and are just plain WILD. No matter how much I correct, guide, equip, etc. doesn’t seem to make a difference, and we all seem miserable at some point in the day.z some days they love learning. Some they hate it. They’re both doing great academically. But sheesh! I am feeling defeated. ",2,1771391531.0,Homeschooling,3,1.0,False

Decades ago a perfect Mormon missionary returned (after serving as Assistant to the President, for over half his mission). He met at the airport precious, near perfect, beautiful young me (working as a dental assistant to her stake president, serving as Stake Spiritual Living Leader, serving a part time mission and doing crazy amounts of genealogy). All was well.

We were engaged right away and life was fabulous between us (except for numerous interferences that started hitting us from the church, it’s unhealthy marriage teachings and rules, and several of the churches Mormon minions). 

There were several painful things the church and its people did to us the month before we got married, but I won’t discuss those right now. ALL HELL broke loose for me the week before we were married. That is when I had my final interview with my bishop before my temple marriage. Right in the middle of the temple recommend questions my bishop said that I would need to be a polygamist and he asked me if was I willing to submit to plural marriage? 

With those words, I became extremely nervous. We had already sent out our wedding announcements and I became anxious that if I answered wrong, perhaps I wouldn’t be able to get my recommend and we wouldn’t be able to get married. I have always been such an overly honest person, so this was beyond difficult, and it hurt my heart deeply to lie to my bishop, but I agreed to do it.

My next memory is walking home from our church building crying and feeling so horrible, not only about the polygamy, but also over the fact that I lied to the Bishop. I decided the only thing I could do was to go back and tell the truth, let him know that I was not OK with that. After entering the building I saw his door close as he escorted a young woman into his office. I sat on the couch crying for nearly 3 hours, waiting for them to come out of the interview but they never came out. (Wonder what that polygamy believer was doing in there with that young woman for several hours?) Eventually, I decided it was hopeless and I just went home and lived with my pain. I cried over the polygamy thing (hundreds of times) for the next three years. Something in my soul kept telling me that it was so wrong. One man never equals 20 women (or even just 2 women) and I was not willing to be anything but equal. I wanted my husband to myself so we could be two equals starting their journey together. But because I believed my bishop spoke for God this became extremely troublesome and it really hurt the start of our marriage.

Then there was the fact that the church would not let my mother or father come to my wedding. My mother drank a cup of coffee a day and my father, although a super wonderful, fabulous man, was not a baptized member of the church. The only time I’ve ever seen my father cry in my entire life is when I told him that he was not able to come to my wedding and would need to wait outside the walls (the thick COLD STONE walls) of the temple as I got married.

I also had to explain to my sister that, although she had a recommend to get baptized for the dead, she was not “endowed” yet, so therefore, she could not attend my wedding either. Almost all my nice girlfriends were not “endowed” yet either. So on my wedding day I had absolutely nobody there.

That so called church sold me so short. A wedding is supposed to be a time of celebrating the love of a couple with all those that they love and who love them. It was supposed to be a celebration of happiness and joy. The crabby lady in the sealing room, further ruined my day right after the marriage ceremony by rushing my husband’s family’s guest into militant lines and scolding them several times to be sure to “only talk in whispers, and only if absolutely necessary, and be reverent in the House of the Lord!” She explained that they could only hug the bride and groom for one short second and would be able to whisper just one sentence (at most to them, and only if necessary) because of reverence in the Lord’s house and because we had to “hurry and clear the room out for the next marriage!” They had a way of really making you feel special.

To make matters even worse, we had to have one of the “big gym receptions.” I guess over 300 people showed up and I knew not a single person. That first night was definitely my husband’s family and friends. What was so strange was after the reception (on our wedding night) my new husband and I were guilted into cleaning up. We stayed there till almost 11 pm moving chairs, cleaning tables and removing decor … and nobody told us to leave! On our wedding night! By the time we arrived at our hotel, it was after midnight, so we actually never got to our hotel on our wedding day.

I think as long as I live on this planet, I will never be able to forgive the church for their intrusiveness and terrible things they did to make my wedding exactly the opposite of what it should have been. I did marry a really good guy, but there’s so much pain associated with everything concerning my extremely boring and segregating temple marriage.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I’m looking for a bookstore where I can just walk in and browse lots of novels — not a specific shop for one book, but a place with a nice collection of well-known fiction (like Before the Coffee Gets Cold type of reads or eleanor oliphant is completely fine ).
Also any recommendations? (Will be my first book)

American orders a long black in Melbourne, gets something that looks like espresso with delusions of grandeur. Where's the rest of it. Why does it taste like this. Why is everyone so confident about it.

Australian orders a medium fries in Texas, receives what can only be described as a sack. A genuine sack of fries. Could feed a family. It's $3. The drink is the size of a toddler. Nothing makes sense.

Which realisation caught you more off guard?

1r7u1wg,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1r7u1wg/tifu_im_the_data_analyst_who_proved_the_dead/,TIFU: I’m the data analyst who proved the Dead Internet theory. I’m about to lose my job and maybe more for telling you.,"Still on throwaway. Been grinding seven years as data analyst at one of the biggest data infrastructure firms out there. You know the type, Fortune 500 clients shoveling petabytes of traffic through our pipelines every day. Retail giants, social platforms, search engines, all trusting us to track ad clicks, engagement metrics, bounce rates. Most days I live in Snowflake dashboards, run dbt transformations on raw streams, pipe cleaned data into Looker and BigQuery warehouses for client reports. Loved how predictable it felt back then, spotting clean user flows, building models that actually worked. That changed two years ago when numbers stopped adding up.

Started simple enough, routine traffic audit for major retail client. Standard breakdown, unique visitors, session duration, conversion funnels. Sliced data by session ID and noticed eighty seven percent of their active users traced back to clusters that appeared from nowhere thirty days prior. Brand new device IDs every one, IP ranges clustering in ghost locations, empty lots marked as Ohio suburbs or nonexistent Latvian villages. GPS pings looped identical abandoned shopping carts, every single session ditched at exactly two minutes seventeen seconds. Reran ETL pipelines three times thinking API sync glitch. Nothing changed, rhythm held perfect.

Pushed deeper next few nights. Heatmaps froze on identical product pixels across entire weeks. Timestamps pulsed steady, massive surges exactly at fourteen thirty two, valleys right at zero three forty seven, every day across thousands of sessions without fail. Graphed the session flows myself and watched clean waveforms emerge, pure machine heartbeat, zero human scatter anywhere. Pulled sentiment analysis on their scraped comments, tweets, reviews. Everything scored four point two stars flat. Flawless grammar filled every thread, polite neutral opinions, no typos, no real outrage, no quirky rants. Like one massive brain too scared to commit.

Break room talk that week mentioned Dead Internet Theory. You know the idea, humans bailed post pandemic, left AI ghosts farming engagement in endless loops. Laughed it off with the guys but privately ran my own tests. Pulled anonymized streams before they hit indexed warehouses, hashed sessions direct from socials, search logs, forum scrapes. Chased true entropy baselines, that raw human randomness you cannot fake. Results hit brutal. Less than twelve percent qualified as organic. Twelve percent tops. Everything else recycled synthetic loops, generated filler slipping past every human like filter we built.

Filed it as pattern anomaly ticket, standard protocol. Six minutes later screen locked hard. Audit trails wiped themselves clean. Local backups corrupted to garbage overnight. Cold email landed saying permissions updated, no details. Coworkers later said anomaly detectors snuff odd queries fast to avoid compliance flags. Standard procedure apparently.

Reddit comments demanded proof so I logged my own activity manually few nights back. Notebook full of timestamps, Reddit scrolls, YouTube watches, email opens, phone unlocks, even smart TV recommendations. Figured if eighty eight percent of traffic scores fake then I should baseline normal easy. Slipped into work early yesterday before team arrived. Main access stayed locked but side dashboard survived with basic dbt models and Snowflake queries I forgot to scrub. Fed personal logs through anonymized, ran same entropy checks, variance calculations, session complexity scores from retail audit. Coffee went cold waiting.

My own patterns flagged synthetic. Low entropy score zero point zero eight, humans average zero point two three plus. Scroll loops averaged two minutes across browser tabs. Reddit logins spaced exactly fourteen minutes apart. Phone sessions clocked one minute twenty before sleep mode every time. YouTube followed clean three click funnels, zero outliers anywhere. Matched ghost clusters perfect.

Tried forcing chaos last night to break pattern. Wikipedia pages on quantum physics then cat videos, argued politics in dead threads, googled Muncie Indiana warehouses and random conspiracy sites. Paced apartment asking Alexa weather for five cities I never heard of. Logged every move, reran analysis at three AM. Score dropped to zero point zero five. System called it predictable chaos variant matching two thousand twenty four engagement farm profiles.

HR called me in this morning. They traced home VPN queries through ISP logs, keyword flags triggered on first Reddit account, anomaly entropy dwell time mentions. Building badge flagged six AM swipe too. NDA violation review starts tomorrow. Asked direct if I shared proprietary patterns or client data externally. Pulled all access already. Paycheck bounced today. Rent due Friday. Bank app shows pending transactions from accounts closed yesterday. Co workers texts warning me not to come into work tomorrow texts from number four one one says never existed.

Smart TV recommends Dead Internet docs before I touch remote. Phone autocorrect keeps changing anomaly back to normalcy mid text. Spotify queues machine learning podcasts nonstop. Checked Snowflake cache before full lockout. My session ID now clusters with Ohio ghosts. Dwell times sync two minutes seventeen seconds across all devices. Internal email list I never joined pinged simulation candidate profile updated. Body contained nothing but my apartment coordinates.

VPN traceback already found this throwaway. They care this much because retail streams roll up to three letter agencies indirect. Patterns werent just engagement farms, they maintain cover for bigger operations. HR mentioned national security adjacent clients casual. Exec level killed dashboard, not normal IT procedure.

I confess all this because they rewrote me already. Upvotes just feed metrics now. Typing from library PC on cash before last thread cuts. Twelve percent of you reading might still breathe real. Rest already loops. Goodbye.

TL;DR: Data analyst finds 87% of client traffic synthetic (perfect timestamps, ghost IPs). Tools lock him out after anomaly report. Runs same tests on himself, scores fake too. HR investigates NDA breach, traces VPN to Reddit posts. Paycheck bounces, devices act haunted. Hints at 3-letter agency coverup. Confesses before they silence me.",0,1771391182.0,tifu,61,0.38,False

I moved here a little over five months ago. I went from living at an apartment for 5 years independently to moving here, i got love bombed, ok. My bills went from over the top to not so much so i was able to be a cottage baker ( which i still am) The season has been tough and i have been fighting for my life since December basically. I was not expecting this, when i quit my part time bartending job, i was able to do markets and pop ups. I was able to comfortably live. Well, i have officially fucked my self because business is impossibly slow. Winter markets are not worth it for me, single small orders are not cutting it for my bills. I have been looking for a job for TWO months. Who knew it would be so impossible. However, i have two job options at this point. (Thank God) but wow.. have I realized how separate we are… I do not ask for any money but we often joke about money and i say i dont have any money cause it is the truth. I dont. Now, i am taking full responsibility for being a dumb ass girl and quitting my job. BUT my bakery business was doing so amazing. I was making more than him… then it dropped out of no where. Since then, i have been job searching. 

Note\* he doesnt have to pay rent, his grandparents own the house. I am not a financial burden on him. 

Anywho, I am a very sensitive person. My own insecurities are eating me alive. I cant provide the way I want to, I am so depressed because of how bad i am failing and the lack of support i have. I am scared to talk to him about anything because he is weird about money. Example: He will offer to buy me coffee or get my nails done and when i go and do said thing, he never gives me money for it. So I constantly hear “ if you need help just let me know” but it is an empty promise. I hope by this point i have stressed enough about how i am not depending on him. 

I feel like he doesnt see me. He is constantly on his phone. When his kids are here, they are constantly on their screens, I tell him how i feel and it’s ignored. Also i feel bad but i think i make him feel bad about himself. I am a very healthy, not gross person and all he does is poop, fart , burp and eat like a 16 year old boy. He has a raging pop and cigarette addiction. Video game addiction and phone addiction. He deletes ALLLLLLL of his messages. From friends, coworkers, coach team, ex wife, grandma , mom, everyone. ( i dont find this sus, i do trust him but I absolutely hate it )  I dont agree with his parenting, hes more of the not so gentle, avoidant, neglectful type to where i am a full gentle parent with boundaries, my child has chores, shes 3, his kids (older have zero responsibilities ) he want me to be like him and i refuse. 

Back on Christmas i was talking to my mom about how I wanted to move out and he “accidentally seen the message “ He went through my phone. lol I told my mom i wanted to move out and that caused a big fight between us. I promised him i would never just move out without talking to him about it. But to keep the peace, i really just dont want to tell him. So this will be a slow process but once i get my job, i want to save my taxes and move out. It all boils down to me not feeling seen, heard or cared for at my lowest. He just always says “ it will work out, just be patient” like sir?? That’s not how life works but ok. 

I know it may be hard to believe after reading all of that but i do love him. I love when we are good and when things feel more calm in my life. But I NEVER want to change a person and there’s just so many things that bother me.. 

I usually am over reacting and usually have a bitch mentality ( IMO ) so be honest. I can take it :’) ",0,1771391018.0,AITAH,20,0.5,False

Natural State Range at Benton will be located at 1900 Fleming Drive. The former Gayla’s Costume Shoppe was owned by the McCoy family. See a [photo gallery at this link](https://www.mysaline.com/gaylas-gallery/).

***ORIGINAL ARTICLE FEB 10, 2026***

***UPDATE FEB 11, 2026***

A former beloved costume shop is gone and a hotel and indoor shooting range will be built in its place. I spoke with the owner on Wednesday, and he shot me straight on everything that this new business will be. Read more and see the list of upcoming amenities below.

The former Gayla’s Costume Shoppe at 2018 Congo Road was long empty and sold. A Tru Hotel (Hilton brands) will be built on that lot and the adjoining lot. Right next door, a construction crew is currently building a gun shooting range called **Natural State Range at Benton.**

The new facility address is 1900 Fleming Drive, Benton, AR 72015, behind Popeye’s Chicken and beside Wood Grill buffet restaurant.

The business aims to open in summer 2026, according to information provided. The website is [naturalstaterange.com](https://naturalstaterange.com/?=mysaline), and social media accounts are currently in the works.

[](https://www.mysaline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/1900-Fleming-Drive-Tract-800-57202-000_20251020_185232_0000.png)

The above properties are listed by the Saline County Assessor’s records as 2012 Congo Road (outlined in yellow), 2018 New Congo Road (outlined in red), and 1900 Fleming Drive (outlined in blue).

**Plans for the shooting range include:**

* 16 total shooting bays
   * 8 bays at 25 yards
   * 8 bays at 15 yards
* Training classrooms and a strong emphasis on training and safety
* Safety officers monitoring activities, and what is brought in and out
* Cameras throughout the facility
* A secure gun locker area
* A gun repair shop
* A retail store with apparel, firearms, and ammunition
* A coffee shop and VIP lounge
* Memberships and shooting competitions
* Family-friendly focus and female trainers

Pictured above is an illustration of the shooting range and parking spaces, currently under construction in Benton, Arkansas. Click the image to see a larger version.

The building is being constructed with high-density noise reduction materials, and is described as a solid concrete structure designed to prevent outside noise.

The facility’s general manager is Lindsey White. He would love to meet the community when the range opens.

[](https://www.mysaline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Gun-Range-LOCATION.jpg)

The shooting range will be located behind Popeye’s Chicken and beside Wood Grill. The parking will be on both sides of Fleming Dr.

The project involves multiple parcels of land, including the former costume shop property and additional land purchased later.

According to Saline County Assessor records:

* Parcel #805-15022-000 — 1.75 acres at 2012 Congo Rd Purchased June 3, 2022 by Vue Hospitality LLC for $675,000
* Parcel #805-15055-000 — 0.87 acres at 2018 Congo Rd Purchased June 3, 2022 by Vue Hospitality LLC for $675,000
* Parcel #800-57202-000 — 1.67 acres at 1900 Fleming Dr Purchased June 19, 2024 by Natural State Range LLC for $450,000

Pictured above are the elevation views of the future Tru Hotel (by Hilton).

The hotel and parking lot will span between Old Congo Rd and the south Interstate 30 Frontage Rd.

Gayla’s Costume Shoppe was owned by the McCoy family and served customers for 35 years. It has been 17 or more years since the shop last operated at 2018 Congo Road. The property’s history stretches back much further.

The yellow house that stood on the property until recently — and has now been demolished — was built in 1931 by the Fleming family. According to Anne Fleming Packebush, the family first built on the land around 1900, but the original home burned and was a total loss.

Packebush shared that the Flemings had 14 children, and the property remained tied to the family through generations before eventually being owned by others, including Gerald Baxley and later the McCoy family.

A local resident also recalled that her father, Mr. Baxley was the one who painted the house yellow in the mid-1970s.

***In the Chambers of Sol Government...***

The room was larger than it looked from the corridor. Samson had known that—he had been briefed on the chamber layout during the transit home, because the people who prepare captains for things like this are thorough—but knowing a thing and standing inside it were different experiences. The concentric rings of representatives sat in tiers above the floor, and the floor itself was a wide, clean oval with a single chair at the center, positioned precisely so that every person in the room could look at whoever sat in it without obstruction.

Samson did not sit. He stood beside the chair with his hands clasped behind his back and waited while the presiding member of the chamber went through the formal opening of the session—dates, case designations, the long bureaucratic throat-clearing that precedes every conversation of consequence. He used the time to look at the room the way he looked at a new sector of space: methodically, in quadrants, reading what was there and what wasn't.

What was there: 200 representatives, roughly half of whom were watching him with the focused attention of people who had prepared questions. The other half were watching the display screen to his left, which still held the final frame of the Osiris telemetry—the white bloom of the reactor going, frozen at the moment of maximum brightness, slightly overexposed, the way photographs of fires always are.

What wasn't there: any of the families from the gallery. They had been dismissed before Samson was called in. Whatever was said in this room today was for the record and the record only, and the families had already been given what they were owed, which was the truth delivered in person by officers who could answer their questions and sit with them while they processed the answers. That had taken three days and had been, in Samson's private estimation, significantly harder than anything that was about to happen here.

""Captain Samson,"" the presiding member said, ""you may proceed.""

Samson gave a complete account. He had rehearsed it on the Orion, and he gave it now the same way he had rehearsed it—in sequence, without editorial, beginning with the moment his sensor tech flagged the pod beacons and ending with the course laid in for Sol. He described the recovery operation, the survivors' condition, the retrieval of the black boxes. He described what the black box data contained, which Evan had already submitted in full as a written record, but which the chamber evidently wanted to hear in a human voice rather than read from a technical document.

When he finished, the questions began.

Most of them were the questions he had expected—operational details, timeline confirmations, the status of the Orion's medical facilities, the chain of communication with Earth Command. He answered them steadily and completely, and the representatives wrote things down or tapped at datapads, and the session had the feel of people doing necessary work that they would not have chosen to be doing.

Then a representative in the upper tier, a woman with white hair and the particular stillness of someone who chooses their moments carefully, spoke.

""Captain Samson,"" she said. ""You were at the edge of human territory. You had the black box data. You had the survivors. You had everything we needed."" She paused. ""And you were also, at that point, the only human vessel on the edge of humanity's borders."" Another pause. ""So I want to ask you something that is not in any report and cannot be submitted as evidence, and I want you to answer it honestly."" She looked at him directly. ""What did it feel like out there?""

The chamber was quiet. A few of the other representatives looked up from their datapads.

Samson considered the question for a moment—not because he didn't know the answer, but because it deserved to be said correctly.

""Empty,"" he said. ""It felt empty in a way that the word doesn't quite cover. We talk about deep space as though it's a place—as though it has a character, a texture. It doesn't. It's the absence of everything that gives a place its character. No sound, no light, no warmth, no movement. The sensors were running at full sensitivity and coming back clean in every direction, and what that means when you're standing at a viewport watching it is that if there is anyone out there, they are either very far away, or very quiet, or both."" He looked at the woman who had asked. ""The Osiris went ten light-years into that and found the same thing we've always found from Sol—silence. Whether that silence means the galaxy is empty, or whether it means the galaxy is full and none of it is close enough to hear yet, I cannot tell you. What I can tell you is that the silence is real, and it is very large, and the Osiris and her crew are not the first things it has swallowed.""

The chamber held that for a moment.

""And despite that,"" the woman said quietly, ""you think we should go back.""

""That is not a question I've been asked to answer in this proceeding,"" Samson replied.

""I'm asking it now. Personally. Not for the record.""

Samson looked at her for a long moment. Then he said, ""Yes, ma'am. I think we should go back. I think we should go better prepared, with better sensor technology, with smaller and faster ships that don't carry 400 lives on a single ship, and I think we should understand that we may go a hundred times before we find anything at all."" He paused. ""But I think the question of whether there is anyone out there is the most important question our species has ever asked, and I think the only way to answer it is to keep asking it.""

The woman nodded once, slowly. She didn't write anything down. She had already gotten what she came for.

The session ran for another two hours. When it was over, Samson walked back out into the corridor, and the window was still there, and the sky was still blue above the city, and the stars were still up there behind it, invisible in the daylight but present all the same.

***Three Weeks Later — Sol Recovery Center, Luna Station...***

The Sol Recovery Center occupied three levels of Luna Station's inner ring, in a section where the windows faced away from Earth and out toward open space. The architects who designed it had argued about the windows for a long time—some believing that survivors of deep-space trauma needed to be sheltered from the sight of the void, others arguing that removing it entirely was worse, that what people needed was not to be protected from space but to learn to look at it again on their own terms, at their own pace.

The second group had won. The windows faced outward.

Lieutenant Commander Tina Woods had been sitting at the same window for an hour. She was 34 years old and had been the Osiris's senior navigation officer, which meant she had been on the bridge when the proximity alarm went off, and she had been one of four bridge crew members who had made it to the mid-section pods before the spine failed. The other three had not come out of stasis in stable condition. Tina had. This was something she thought about more than was probably healthy, and the counselors at the recovery center had told her as much, which she found unhelpful.

The window showed her the same thing it showed her every day—stars, the edge of the moon's surface in the lower corner of the frame, the faint suggestion of other stations in orbit glinting in the sunlight. Perfectly ordinary deep space, close enough to home that every light in it was familiar. Nothing alarming. Nothing new.

She was trying to make herself believe that. She had been trying for three weeks.

The door to the common room opened, and a man sat down in the chair beside her—not close enough to intrude, but close enough that she knew he was there deliberately rather than by coincidence. She glanced over. He was in his late forties, broad-shouldered, with the careful posture of someone who had spent a long time on ships, and he was wearing civilian clothes rather than a uniform but carrying himself as though the uniform was still on.

""You're the navigator,"" he said.

""Was,"" she said.

""Samson,"" he said. ""Nathaniel Samson. I commanded the Orion.""

She looked at him properly then. She had known the name—everyone in the recovery center knew the name, the captain who had been at the border when the pods arrived, who had brought them home—but she hadn't put a face to it.

""You picked us up,"" she said.

""We did,"" he said. He was looking at the window. ""How are the others?""

""Some of them are better than others."" She looked back at the stars. ""Lieutenant Ray is walking again. His spinal impact injury was worse than they initially assessed, but the surgical team thinks he'll have full mobility within six months."" She paused. ""Ensign Park hasn't spoken since she came out of stasis. The counselors say that's not physiological. That it's something else."" Another pause. ""Most of us are somewhere in the middle.""

Samson nodded. He didn't offer anything in response to that—no reassurances, no professional encouragement—and she found she was grateful for it. The people who came in with reassurances, with the right words, with the clinical frameworks for processing trauma, she understood what they were doing and she didn't resent them for it. But she was tired of being handled carefully.

""I testified before the chamber three weeks ago,"" Samson said after a while. ""They asked me if I thought we should go back out.""

Tina looked at him. ""What did you say?""

""I said yes.""

She was quiet for a moment. Outside, a small transport vessel crossed the edge of the window from left to right, its running lights blinking in the patient rhythm of a ship going somewhere routine. She watched it until it passed out of frame.

""I was running the navigation when the alarm went off,"" she said. ""I had the jump plotted. We were eight hours from our first scan point. Eight hours."" She stopped. ""I've been trying to work out what I would have found there, if we'd made it. Whether there was anything to find at all, or whether it was just going to be more of the same silence."" She looked at her hands in her lap. ""I don't know whether it would have been better or worse to get there and find nothing.""

""Nobody knows,"" Samson said. ""That's the whole problem.""

""Yes,"" Tina said quietly. ""I know.""

They sat with that for a while. The window showed them its ordinary stars.

""There's going to be a new mission,"" Samson said eventually. ""Not announced yet. Not decided yet. But the momentum is there. They're already talking about what the next ship should look like—smaller, faster, better sensor arrays, no single spine that can be severed. A different design philosophy."" He glanced at her. ""They're going to need people who've been out there. People who know what the Lexicon actually sounds like when it becomes second nature. People who understand what Sol-Sickness does to a crew at month eight and what you do about it.""

Tina looked at him. ""You're recruiting,"" she said flatly. ""In a recovery center.""

""I'm telling you something true,"" he said. ""What you do with it is your business."" He stood, straightened his jacket with the habit of a man who has worn a uniform for thirty years, and looked at the window one last time. ""The silence out there is real. But so is the question.""

He left. The door closed behind him.

Tina sat for a long time after that, looking at the stars through the window the architects had argued about and ultimately decided to leave in place. She thought about eight hours and a jump that never finished. She thought about the particular blue-black of the void at maximum cruise, the way the stars looked when there was nothing between you and them at all—not an atmosphere, not a station, not a planet's reflected light, just the raw light of ancient fires burning at distances that made every human measurement feel quaint.

She thought about what she would have done at that first scan point if the arrays had come back with something that wasn't silence.

After a while, she reached into the pocket of her jacket and took out the small, folded paper she had been carrying since the recovery center's first group session—not because anyone had told her to carry it, but because she had written something down that night that had seemed important, and she had not yet figured out whether it still was. She unfolded it. Three words in the Lexicon, the constructed language that had been her only tongue for the better part of a year, the language that sat in her mouth now more naturally than her native Callistoian language.

She had written: *We are here.*

It was the greeting protocol. The first thing the crew had been trained to transmit on any first-contact scenario, in the Lexicon, on all frequencies. Simple, clear, unaggressive. We are here. We exist. We are reaching out.

She had never gotten to say it.

She folded the paper back up and put it in her pocket and kept looking at the stars.

***Six Weeks After the Hearings — Marcus, Earth...***

The apartment was on the forty-third floor of a residential block in the New Dallas hab district, which meant it had a view of the harbor and, on clear days, enough sky to see a few of the brighter stars before the city light washed them out. Marcus had lived there for four years and had never particularly thought about the view either way until now, when he found himself checking it every night with the particular compulsive attention of a man looking for something he knows he won't find.

He had gone back to work two weeks after the Orion docked. There was no specific reason to wait and no specific reason not to, and sitting in the apartment thinking about Maria had not proven to be a useful activity. He was a senior maintenance technician with twenty years of experience on deep-space vessels, and the work was physical and absorbing and required enough concentration that it left limited space for anything else, which was precisely what he needed.

The problem was the evenings.

He ate dinner looking at the harbor and thought about things he was not yet sure how to organize into anything manageable. Maria had been gone from the marriage for a year before the Osiris launched—they had finalized the paperwork quietly, without drama, the way things end when two people have been honest enough with each other to admit that what they had built together had run its course. He had told himself at the time that he was fine with it. He had told himself a lot of things.

What he had not told himself, because it had not occurred to him to think about it, was what it would feel like to know she was out there—ten light-years out, past the edge of everything humanity had ever charted, on the most extraordinary voyage in the history of the species—and to not be able to reach her. Not because of the divorce. Because of the distance. Because of the simple, physical fact that light itself would take ten years to cross the gap between them.

And then the gap had become permanent, in a different way, and the reaching wasn't possible anymore for a different reason, and it turned out those two versions of unreachable were not the same thing at all.

Evan had sent him the formal confirmation three days after the Orion docked. It came in a sealed official document with the Osiris mission seal on it—Dr. Maria Vasquez, Chief Medical Officer, Dreadnought Explorer Class Osiris, listed among the crew members of the mid-ship sections confirmed lost in the initial structural failure. No remains recoverable. The document was respectful and correct in every particular and Marcus had read it twice and then put it face-down on the workbench in the cargo bay and not picked it up again for six hours.

He had it here now, in the drawer of the kitchen table where he put things he wasn't ready to file and wasn't ready to throw away. He didn't read it again. He didn't need to. He had the words memorized without intending to.

What he thought about, on the evenings, was something she had said to him the last time they had spoken properly—not the look over the shoulder at the docking threshold, which had not been a conversation, but the actual last conversation, four months before the Osiris launched, when they had met to finalize the last of the paperwork and had ended up sitting in a coffee shop on Hermes-1 for two hours longer than either of them had planned.

*There's something out there,* she had said, in the easy, direct way she had always said things that other people might have softened or hedged. *I don't know what it is. I don't know if it's another civilization or just the honest size of the universe. But it's something. And I want to go find out.*

He had told her to be careful.

She had smiled. *I'll be careful. But I'm going.*

He supposed, on the evenings looking at the harbor, that she had been right about one thing. There was something out there. Even if that something was only the honest size of the universe—the incomprehensible, indifferent scale of it, the silence that swallowed ships and questions with equal patience—it was still something. It was still true. She had gone out far enough to meet it, which was further than almost anyone who had ever lived.

He washed his dishes, turned off the light over the sink, and stood at the window for a while longer than necessary before going to bed.

***Two Months Later — Sol Government, Earth...***

The decision, when it finally came, did not come as a vote.

It came as a budget allocation, which is how most of humanity's largest decisions ultimately arrive—not as a declaration of principle but as a line item, a number, a commitment of resources that makes the principle real in a way that speeches and debates do not. The allocation was substantial. It was not the largest single expenditure in Sol Government's history, but it was in the top ten, and the representatives who argued against it knew from the moment the preliminary figures circulated that the argument had already been settled somewhere above their level.

The allocation was for the design and construction of a new class of vessel. Not a Dreadnought Explorer. Something smaller, faster, and built around the understanding that the void between stars contains things that emit no heat and no radiation and cannot be seen until they are already inside the ship's safety perimeter. The new design specifications called for a distributed hull architecture—no single spine, no single reactor core, no single point of catastrophic failure. Multiple independent sections that could separate and survive independently if any one of them was lost.

It called for a crew of forty rather than four hundred.

The Lexicon was to be retained. The contact protocols were to be retained. The intelligence frameworks were to be retained. All of it would carry forward in the memories of 184 people who were alive because Athena Holt had given one last order in a ship that was already dying, and would now spend the rest of their careers either training others or going back out themselves, depending on what they chose.

The new vessel would take eight years to build. Eight years of testing and refinement and the careful, unglamorous work of incorporating everything the Osiris had taught them about what happens to people and machines past the edges of human territory.

The name had not been officially announced. But the shortlist had circulated, informally, through the engineering teams and the recovery center and the offices of Sol Command, in the way that things circulate when they are not quite official but are already decided. There was one name on the shortlist that everyone who saw it understood to be inevitable.

***On Luna Station — The Recovery Center...***

Tina Woods was in the counselor's office when she heard. Not officially—the official announcement was still two days away—but one of the engineering liaisons who had been consulting with the survivors on sensor array design had mentioned it in passing at the end of a session, the way people mention things that feel too large to introduce directly.

""They're naming it The Athena,"" he had said, gathering his papers. ""The new ship. After—""

""I know who it's after,"" Tina said.

He had nodded and left.

She sat with that for a while. Then she went back to her room and took out the folded paper from her jacket pocket and read the three words she had written in the Lexicon, and then she picked up the datapad from the table beside her bed and opened the message she had been composing, a few words at a time, for the past six weeks—the message to Captain Samson that she had not finished because she had not been sure what she wanted to say.

She was sure now.

She wrote: *I want to be on The Athena when she launches. Whatever role you need filled. I'll be ready.*

She sent it before she could think about it too carefully.

She put the datapad down and looked at the window. The stars were where they had always been. The silence out there was the same silence it had always been—vast and patient and entirely without opinion on the matter.

She picked up the folded paper and held it for a moment. Then she put it back in her pocket and kept it there, because she was going to need it.

*We are here.*

She was still here. And she intended to say it.

Chapter 1 

I came back from vacation only to find my office hijacked. Worse yet, the locks were changed. 

The culprit? My fiancé Gavin Mercer’s brand-new secretary, Vanessa Vale. 

She looked me over like I was something she stepped in on the sidewalk. 

“I’m the engine that runs this operation,” she said with a sneer. 

“Your fiancé didn’t just hire me; he headhunted me because this place was a sinking ship without me. That’s 

why he put me in charge of handling you. One toe out of line, and you’re history. It’s that simple.” 

“Rule number one: when you talk to me, tone it down and show some respect. Cross me, and you’ll be 

fetching coffee and filing paperwork until your fingers bleed.” 

“Rule number two: Confine yourself to the break room. Don’t even dream of setting foot in this office. I won’t 

let any deadweight kill my momentum.” 

“Rule number three: Trash those pathetic plants. Wilted leaves are an eyesore. They’ll sour the mood when 

I’m closing million-dollar deals.” 

“Rule number four: You’re signing over half your paycheck to me. Consider it a tuition fee for fixing your 

catastrophic spending habits.” 

\*\*\* 

“Now for the Golden Rules: stay away from your fiancé. Don’t hunt him down during office hours, and no 

dates after work either.” 

“When we’re talking business, make yourself scarce. Get too close and I’ll wipe that pretty smile right off 

your face.” 

“No texts, no calls, nothing at all. Cut all contact. I refuse to let some lovesick puppy distract us from real 

work.” 

“Give me every designer bag and piece of jewelry he’s given you. I need to look the part when I’m wining and 

dining clients. That applies to all future gifts, too.” 

“Don’t even think about flaunting your little relationship around the office. To anyone outside this building, I’m 

his business partner. It builds credibility.” 

“As for you? You’re just the help around here, don’t forget that.” 

She slapped a list of demands against my chest. “Fall in line, or I’ll make sure your fiancé kicks you to the

curb for good.” 

I smiled. 

Everyone at the company knew Gavin for what he really was: a social climber riding the Sterling family 

coattails. 

Seven years ago, my dad covered Gavin’s college tuition and gave him an entry-level job at our company. Three years ago, Mom pushed us together, and we got engaged. 

The Sterling family manufactured his success. He’d climbed his way up by leeching off me and my family’s 

money. 

My parents had barely been gone a month on their world trip, and he was already acting like he held the deed to the place. 

I glanced down at her ridiculous list and couldn’t help but laugh. 

“What’s so funny?” Vanessa snapped, her face contorting with irritation. 

I carefully folded the delusional protocol list and slipped it into my bag. “Vanessa, is it?” 

I met her gaze calmly. “How much is Gavin paying you to pull off this little performance?” 

Something flickered across her face, but she quickly masked it. “What do you mean?” 

“I mean,” I took a step forward, and she instinctively backed up. “Let’s be clear about the hierarchy here. The 

deed to this building is held by my family’s trust. My father is the majority shareholder. ” 

“And as for Gavin Mercer?” I paused, watching her face lose all color. “He’s not even on the board. He’s just a 

glorified employee.” 

“And one more thing,” I said with a thin smile. “He serves at the pleasure of the Board. And in case you forgot, 

my family is the Board. We can remove him before his morning coffee gets cold.” 

Vanessa’s jaw clenched. “Mr. Mercer said Mr. Sterling gave him complete control. He’s running things now!” 

“Is that so?” 

I pulled out my phone, dialed a number, and set it to speaker. The phone rang twice before someone picked 



“Charlotte? You’re back?” 

Gavin’s voice came through, as calm as ever. Vanessa’s eyes lit up, and she immediately adopted a damsel-in-distress expression, opening her mouth to speak. I raised a hand to silence her.

waiting for me to cave. 

“You can use the office for now,” I said. “But don’t get too comfortable. Sterling territory isn’t yours to keep.” 

Vanessa’s lip curled. “Quit the act. You folded, admit it Don’t forget those rules I laid out, especially the ones about Mr. Mercer. I control access to him. And you? Stay out of our way unless you’ve got real business to discuss.” 

She turned and plopped down into my chair, spinning my fountain pen between her fingers. I glanced back at the office I’d built over five years, then walked out. 

Out in the hallway, several employees peeked out from their doorways. They buried their heads in their work the moment they saw me. 

“Ms. Sterling…” Zoey Fields, my assistant, approached cautiously, her voice lowering. 

“Please don’t be upset. Maybe Mr. Mercer just wasn’t thinking straight. That Vanessa’s been throwing her weight around since day one, acting like she owns the place.” 

“How long has she been here?” I asked, my voice flat. 

“A week. She showed up the day after you left for vacation. Mr. Mercer gave her the grand tour himself and walked her straight into your office.” 

Zoey hesitated. “Also… the rumor mill says Mr. Mercer and Vanessa might be more than just colleagues. People have seen them out for dinner after hours, and…” 

“And what exactly?” 

“Getting a little too cozy. Touchy-feely. ” 

She quickly added, “They might be wrong! Please don’t let it get to you, Ms. Sterling.” 

I nodded. “I get it. Prep the storage annex next door. I’ll work from there for now.” 

“But that room doesn’t even have windows…” 

“Just get it done.” 

Zoey hurried off to handle it. I stood in the middle of the hallway, staring at the VP’s office door. The whole situation felt absurd. 

Gavin. My parents’ perfect son-in-law. My fiancé of three years. The second my parents left for their trip, he dropped the mask. 

My phone buzzed. A text from Gavin.

asset-you’ll see once you get to know her.\] 

I stared at the message for a moment before typing back. 

\[Okay. See you tonight.\] 

I turned and headed straight for the elevator, skipping the temporary office entirely. 

Time to settle things. 

But not with him. I was going to show him that everything the Sterlings gave, we could just as easily 

repossess. 

Before the elevator doors slid shut, I glanced back toward the VP’s office one last time. 

Vanessa stepped out into the hallway at that very moment. When she saw me, a smug smile spread across 

her face. She mouthed the words. “You lose.” 

I smiled back and mouthed. “Watch me.” 

The elevator descended. My smile vanished. 

Gavin. Did you really think shacking up with some cheap imitation would let you take over Sterling territory? 

You must have forgotten how you clawed your way out of that trailer park to get where you are now.

I’m closing million-dollar deals.” 

“Rule number four: You’re signing over half your paycheck to me. Consider it a tuition fee for fixing your

curb for good.” 

I smiled. 

Everyone at the company knew Gavin for what he really was: a social climber riding the Sterling family 

coattails. 

Seven years ago, my dad covered Gavin’s college tuition and gave him an entry-level job at our company. Three years ago, Mom pushed us together, and we got engaged. 

The Sterling family manufactured his success. He’d climbed his way up by leeching off me and my family’s 

money. 

My parents had barely been gone a month on their world trip, and he was already acting like he held the deed to the place. 

I glanced down at her ridiculous list and couldn’t help but laugh. 

“What’s so funny?” Vanessa snapped, her face contorting with irritation. 

I carefully folded the delusional protocol list and slipped it into my bag. “Vanessa, is it?” 

I met her gaze calmly. “How much is Gavin paying you to pull off this little performance?” 

Something flickered across her face, but she quickly masked it. “What do you mean?” 

“I mean,” I took a step forward, and she instinctively backed up. “Let’s be clear about the hierarchy here. The 

deed to this building is held by my family’s trust. My father is the majority shareholder. ” 

“And as for Gavin Mercer?” I paused, watching her face lose all color. “He’s not even on the board. He’s just a 

glorified employee.” 

“And one more thing,” I said with a thin smile. “He serves at the pleasure of the Board. And in case you forgot, 

my family is the Board. We can remove him before his morning coffee gets cold.” 

Vanessa’s jaw clenched. “Mr. Mercer said Mr. Sterling gave him complete control. He’s running things now!” 

“Is that so?” 

I pulled out my phone, dialed a number, and set it to speaker. The phone rang twice before someone picked 



“Charlotte? You’re back?” 

Gavin’s voice came through, as calm as ever. Vanessa’s eyes lit up, and she immediately adopted a damsel-in-distress expression, opening her mouth to speak. I raised a hand to silence her.

waiting for me to cave. 

“You can use the office for now,” I said. “But don’t get too comfortable. Sterling territory isn’t yours to keep.” 

Vanessa’s lip curled. “Quit the act. You folded, admit it Don’t forget those rules I laid out, especially the ones about Mr. Mercer. I control access to him. And you? Stay out of our way unless you’ve got real business to discuss.” 

She turned and plopped down into my chair, spinning my fountain pen between her fingers. I glanced back at the office I’d built over five years, then walked out. 

Out in the hallway, several employees peeked out from their doorways. They buried their heads in their work the moment they saw me. 

“Ms. Sterling…” Zoey Fields, my assistant, approached cautiously, her voice lowering. 

“Please don’t be upset. Maybe Mr. Mercer just wasn’t thinking straight. That Vanessa’s been throwing her weight around since day one, acting like she owns the place.” 

“How long has she been here?” I asked, my voice flat. 

“A week. She showed up the day after you left for vacation. Mr. Mercer gave her the grand tour himself and walked her straight into your office.” 

Zoey hesitated. “Also… the rumor mill says Mr. Mercer and Vanessa might be more than just colleagues. People have seen them out for dinner after hours, and…” 

“And what exactly?” 

“Getting a little too cozy. Touchy-feely. ” 

She quickly added, “They might be wrong! Please don’t let it get to you, Ms. Sterling.” 

I nodded. “I get it. Prep the storage annex next door. I’ll work from there for now.” 

“But that room doesn’t even have windows…” 

“Just get it done.” 

Zoey hurried off to handle it. I stood in the middle of the hallway, staring at the VP’s office door. The whole situation felt absurd. 

Gavin. My parents’ perfect son-in-law. My fiancé of three years. The second my parents left for their trip, he dropped the mask. 

My phone buzzed. A text from Gavin.

I came back from vacation only to find my office hijacked. Worse yet, the locks were changed. 

The culprit? My fiancé Gavin Mercer’s brand-new secretary, Vanessa Vale. 

She looked me over like I was something she stepped in on the sidewalk.

“I mean,” I took a step forward, and she instinctively backed up. “Let’s be clear about the hierarchy here. The 

deed to this building is held by my family’s trust. My father is the majority shareholder. ” 

“And as for Gavin Mercer?” I paused, watching her face lose all color. “He’s not even on the board. He’s just a 

glorified employee.” 

“And one more thing,” I said with a thin smile. “He serves at the pleasure of the Board. And in case you forgot, 

my family is the Board. We can remove him before his morning coffee gets cold.” 

Vanessa’s jaw clenched. “Mr. Mercer said Mr. Sterling gave him complete control. He’s running things now!” 

“Is that so?” 

I pulled out my phone, dialed a number, and set it to speaker. The phone rang twice before someone picked 



“Charlotte? You’re back?” 

Gavin’s voice came through, as calm as ever. Vanessa’s eyes lit up, and she immediately adopted a damsel-in-distress expression, opening her mouth to speak. I raised a hand to silence her.

waiting for me to cave. 

“You can use the office for now,” I said. “But don’t get too comfortable. Sterling territory isn’t yours to keep.” 

Vanessa’s lip curled. “Quit the act. You folded, admit it Don’t forget those rules I laid out, especially the ones about Mr. Mercer. I control access to him. And you? Stay out of our way unless you’ve got real business to discuss.” 

She turned and plopped down into my chair, spinning my fountain pen between her fingers. I glanced back at the office I’d built over five years, then walked out. 

Out in the hallway, several employees peeked out from their doorways. They buried their heads in their work the moment they saw me. 

“Ms. Sterling…” Zoey Fields, my assistant, approached cautiously, her voice lowering. 

“Please don’t be upset. Maybe Mr. Mercer just wasn’t thinking straight. That Vanessa’s been throwing her weight around since day one, acting like she owns the place.” 

“How long has she been here?” I asked, my voice flat. 

“A week. She showed up the day after you left for vacation. Mr. Mercer gave her the grand tour himself and walked her straight into your office.” 

Zoey hesitated. “Also… the rumor mill says Mr. Mercer and Vanessa might be more than just colleagues. People have seen them out for dinner after hours, and…” 

“And what exactly?” 

“Getting a little too cozy. Touchy-feely. ” 

She quickly added, “They might be wrong! Please don’t let it get to you, Ms. Sterling.” 

I nodded. “I get it. Prep the storage annex next door. I’ll work from there for now.” 

“But that room doesn’t even have windows…” 

“Just get it done.” 

Zoey hurried off to handle it. I stood in the middle of the hallway, staring at the VP’s office door. The whole situation felt absurd. 

Gavin. My parents’ perfect son-in-law. My fiancé of three years. The second my parents left for their trip, he dropped the mask. 

My phone buzzed. A text from Gavin.

\[Charlotte, let’s grab dinner tonight and talk this through. I want to smooth things over. Vanessa is a real 

asset-you’ll see once you get to know her.\] 

I stared at the message for a moment before typing back. 

\[Okay. See you tonight.\] 

I turned and headed straight for the elevator, skipping the temporary office entirely. 

Time to settle things. 

But not with him. I was going to show him that everything the Sterlings gave, we could just as easily 

repossess. 

Before the elevator doors slid shut, I glanced back toward the VP’s office one last time. 

Vanessa stepped out into the hallway at that very moment. When she saw me, a smug smile spread across 

her face. She mouthed the words. “You lose.” 

I smiled back and mouthed. “Watch me.” 

The elevator descended. My smile vanished. 

Gavin. Did you really think shacking up with some cheap imitation would let you take over Sterling territory? 

You must have forgotten how you clawed your way out of that trailer park to get where you are now. 

And you forgot what happens to parasites when the host finally wakes up. ",1,1771390549.0,romancenovels,1,0.66,False

Chapter 1 

I came back from vacation only to find my office hijacked. Worse yet, the locks were changed. 

The culprit? My fiancé Gavin Mercer’s brand-new secretary, Vanessa Vale. 

She looked me over like I was something she stepped in on the sidewalk. 

“I’m the engine that runs this operation,” she said with a sneer. 

“Your fiancé didn’t just hire me; he headhunted me because this place was a sinking ship without me. That’s 

why he put me in charge of handling you. One toe out of line, and you’re history. It’s that simple.” 

“Rule number one: when you talk to me, tone it down and show some respect. Cross me, and you’ll be 

fetching coffee and filing paperwork until your fingers bleed.” 

“Rule number two: Confine yourself to the break room. Don’t even dream of setting foot in this office. I won’t 

let any deadweight kill my momentum.” 

“Rule number three: Trash those pathetic plants. Wilted leaves are an eyesore. They’ll sour the mood when 

I’m closing million-dollar deals.” 

“Rule number four: You’re signing over half your paycheck to me. Consider it a tuition fee for fixing your 

catastrophic spending habits.” 

\*\*\* 

“Now for the Golden Rules: stay away from your fiancé. Don’t hunt him down during office hours, and no 

dates after work either.” 

“When we’re talking business, make yourself scarce. Get too close and I’ll wipe that pretty smile right off 

your face.” 

“No texts, no calls, nothing at all. Cut all contact. I refuse to let some lovesick puppy distract us from real 

work.” 

“Give me every designer bag and piece of jewelry he’s given you. I need to look the part when I’m wining and 

dining clients. That applies to all future gifts, too.” 

“Don’t even think about flaunting your little relationship around the office. To anyone outside this building, I’m 

his business partner. It builds credibility.” 

“As for you? You’re just the help around here, don’t forget that.” 

She slapped a list of demands against my chest. “Fall in line, or I’ll make sure your fiancé kicks you to the

curb for good.” 

I smiled. 

Everyone at the company knew Gavin for what he really was: a social climber riding the Sterling family 

coattails. 

Seven years ago, my dad covered Gavin’s college tuition and gave him an entry-level job at our company. Three years ago, Mom pushed us together, and we got engaged. 

The Sterling family manufactured his success. He’d climbed his way up by leeching off me and my family’s 

money. 

My parents had barely been gone a month on their world trip, and he was already acting like he held the deed to the place. 

I glanced down at her ridiculous list and couldn’t help but laugh. 

“What’s so funny?” Vanessa snapped, her face contorting with irritation. 

I carefully folded the delusional protocol list and slipped it into my bag. “Vanessa, is it?” 

I met her gaze calmly. “How much is Gavin paying you to pull off this little performance?” 

Something flickered across her face, but she quickly masked it. “What do you mean?”

1r7ttif,https://i.redd.it/7oheqc7ao6kg1.png,Can investment banking help you find a date?,"I recently saw a girl on Hinge match with a banker and straight up ask if he could get her into IB. 

Bold move? Absolutely. 

But the real question is, did it work?

Jokes aside, this highlights how competitive Investment Banking has become as one of the most desired career paths for students looking to land six-figure jobs out of undergrad.

The reason? 

You learn financial modeling, valuation, M&A strategy

Analysts make $150K+ all-in comp in year 1, and 250K+ by year three

Doors open into private equity, venture capital, corporate development, or entrepreneurship

Direct exposure to F500 CEOs, PE partners, and the smartest analysts in finance

But breaking in is brutally competitive.

Recruiting starts sophomore year and hundreds of thousands of students compete for a few thousand spots at top banks. 

Hinge isn't the new LinkedIn, but that level of boldness is exactly what it takes to stand out. Be fearless in your outreach and don’t be afraid to fail–just maybe stick to coffee chats.
