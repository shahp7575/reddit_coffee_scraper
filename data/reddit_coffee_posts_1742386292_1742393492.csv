1jexvfa,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1jexvfa/is_walking_someone_to_work_after_a/,Is walking someone to work after a breakfast/coffee date weird?,"Hi everyone, I (M28) matched with a woman (F25) on a dating app and we got chatting, things seemed to go well so we moved to texting and have been texting back and forth for 4-5 days - I get a good vibe and I assume she does too. 

It turns out both of our offices (I work government and she's a lawyer) are nearby eachother in our towns CBD (I'm talking like 5 minute walk down the road, so I asked if she wanted to meet for breakfast or coffee as a date before work to finally meet and she said she was down (which is fun). 

I suppose what I need advice on is how do I 'close' the date (sounds kinda gross when I write it out) - assuming it goes well, is it weird if I was to walk her to her workplace and say bye? Is it better just to say bye at the breakfast place? The place is kind of in the middle of our offices but closer to hers so I'd be walking away from my work to walk her to hers (which is totally fine for me). 

My thoughts on why walking her to her work could be weird is that 1. I don't want it to seem creepy to follow her to her work and make it feel like an inescapable date, 2. I don't want it to impact her standing in her office (she's a young professional - not that it should impact anything but still) by having some random guy walk her up to her office, 3. It seems like it might just be abit awkward? 

Would love some advice/thoughts?

Figured it would be the gasket and ordered a couple of those to replace and then decided to shop about to see anything else I could buy. Saw this and figured it was good to just replace the shower screen and block to swap out and clean. Needless to say, my coffee has been the exact same. I do notice the shot looks differently at startup but taste wise, same. I drink the same beans everyday for americanos so nothing fancy here. Just thought I would share.

I have a job where they allow some folks to have hybrid options. Never been on my radar, because I live 15 minutes away. Well, because everything in the immediate surrounding area is wayyyyy out of our price range, my partner and I bought a house in a rural town & it’s 1.5 hrs away.

This is my first corporate job, and I am unsure how to professionally approach asking for Hybrid work. I know it should be a face to face conversation, but do I lead with requesting a meeting via email? What should I say? Hybrid is not guaranteed, but I take a lot of work off of two major directors & it is our busy season for both hiring and uploading our training certifications so I think I may have some leverage.

I also am a part of onboarding and orientation. I would be willing to come in once a week (we usually only have orientation once a week) even twice if needed, to do orientation/onboarding. Most of my job is online. We have people in various locations that do some sort of hybrid work, so I don’t see it being an odd request. I just don’t know how to have this conversation? I took off for my closing which is April 8th. If they dont want me to be hybrid, i don’t want to formally put my two weeks in until after closing in the event that something weird happens and closing falls through, so i also kind of need guidance on when to have this conversation to play nice with being considerate of the company in the event they choose to have me put in my two weeks. But I also want to be prepared because I did turn in formal request off paperwork that says I am doing so to close on a house. I’m sure I will run into someone while making coffee who innocently will be doing small talk and ask what town — I just want to be prepared if I need to have this conversation sooner than intended

so the setting is in a world where hero/villain conflicts are like a morning coffee,

the people are used to it, it’s more like watching a basketball game for them

it’s considered like a sort of entertainment instead of a real threat, because most villains don’t actually attack they just do like pranks? sort of, like funny, cartoon attacks that don’t actually harm the people.

because the government secretly runs the villain companies, so it’s controls what they do and tries to gain money (making it more like a show with fandom, ship wars, and who’s stronger debates, making it more popular and making merch some people travel to see it. It’s just basically good for business) while controlling villains so they don’t get out of hand,

it’s a grumpy/sunshine dynamic and I wanted to do a cute twist where the hero is the grumpy one and the villain is the sunshine energetic one

they know about each other‘s identities. They just don’t care and they are already dating. It’s a romance comedy and just a bunch of short stories together not really like a series

So semi-NEET. Nothing near 30 hours of work a week, only 20 hours a week at most if even that. But I spent most of my months unemployed with absolutely no commitments. There were a lot of days where I didn't even leave my apartment unit. I dropped all my friends because I had the resource to.

People would judge me if they found out, and I thought of how much money I could be earning and saving if I had a regular job (I applied but didn't get interviews for the degree I studied for) and had the NEET shame.

I am technically a physically disabled NEET with mental health issues. I finally got an interview and got hired at a part time basis. I am surprised I even got hired (I didn't disclose my disabilities of course). We did a 2 day orientation with 8 hours each where we sat through powerpoints.

And you know what? That changed my perspective on the past 3 years. It wasn't a waste. It's so much more preferable than the 40+ hours a week that most Americans work at a job they don't even care about.

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\

1jexldg,https://i.redd.it/5aunnle2knpe1.jpeg,Spider-Man 4 Pitch: a Peter Parker story,"This film is something that could be the most personal and human Peter Parker put onto film. 

I’d have Pete be so tied into being Spider-Man he neglects Peter Parker. No one remembers him so he feels it’s fine. Peter’s arc is learning that even though the world doesn’t remember him it’s no reason to not be his true self. But also, he needs to learn not to forget his past in order to progress his future. More on that later.

He gets into Empire State University. He needs a degree because he’s struggling to get jobs without one, especially in New York. Here he meets two people, two people who Pete is nervous of. Harry Osborn and Gwen Stacey. Peter INSTANTLY wants nothing to do with Harry because he shares the name of the man who killed his aunt and he is reluctant to talk to Gwen (Sadi Sink’s character) because he knows what happens to Gwen if they fall in love. But, they are all kind to him. Harry lost his mother, so did Gwen. Peter doesn’t mention anything about his uncle. This is the formation of the Coffee Bean Gang. 

Picture Harry like Rachel Green from season 1 of Friends. He’s rich but trying to make it on his own, trying to connect with the people. Gwen’s dad is a cop, a good one but certainly has that protective instinct like her father (who doesn’t like Spider-Man).

The villain in this film is Black Cat with Fisk in the background. Hardy is everything Peter wants to be (wrongly). She got rid of her human side to be a vigilante, she doesn’t care who Peter is, only Spider-Man. Peter learns from her what happens if you loose that human connection, if you go fully into being a vigilante you aren’t a hero to yourself.

So, what makes Peter realise he needs to embrace himself and not just Spider-Man. Well, near the end of the film where Peter has seen all sides of this argument he is at a bus stop, an old lady sits next to him. She looks at him, wonder in her eyes and familiarity
“Excuse me” she says calmly. 
Peter looks up. 
“Are you….Ben Parker’s nephew. I went to school with him, you….you have his eyes”.

Peter realises how wrong he’s been. He’s forgotten Ben, tried to hide that trauma for YEARS and now, Ben is back in his life as the world is forgetting Peter. People are noticing Peter due to Ben’s impact. Peter finally visits his grave to tell him about how he’s been and how sorry he is. He doesn’t go into detail. A blurred image almost, we know the story anyway.

The film ends with us meeting party girl MJ, back from MIT. Spider-Man 5 is the love triangle of Peter, Gwen and MJ but also about why MJ has become the party girl and overly extrovert. Peter needs to try and teach her the lessons he learnt in this film to help her in the next.

What would your pitch be?

1jexlcm,https://www.reddit.com/r/noira/comments/1jexlcm/all_about_the_deep_blue/,All About the Deep Blue,"# Noira

The afternoon sun bathes the Deep Blue's interior. Through the windows, golden light stretches across the weathered counter, where bottles of whiskey, wine, and mismatched glasses occupy a newly cleared space. Noira tidies the daytime clutter, her seawater tail trailing behind as she rearranges makeshift furniture to create seating areas. Her watery ears twitch at approaching footsteps outside, and the soft crackle of vinyl fills the air as she lights a cigarette, its smoke curling lazily upward like the thoughts she's about to share.

The door's worn brass bell chimes softly as a patron enters. ""Welcome to the Deep Blue,"" she greets warmly, making her way to the counter-turned-bar with an unhurried spring in her step. As regulars fill the space and wide-eyed newcomers stumble in, Noira shares stories that flow as naturally as the drinks she pours, all while ensuring everyone gets acquainted. Her tales—whether mischievous adventures or profound observations about life—carry the weight of experience that makes everyone wonder: just how many years has she witnessed?

""Old enough to know better, young enough to still make interesting mistakes,"" she'd say with a knowing chuckle, taking a thoughtful of her cigarette.

 

# World Setting

In the year 20XX, the Shadowfall happened to Earth where monsters and nightmares of all sorts began terrorising human civilisation. After several decades, survivors only remember the darkness fading away and discovered a valuable resource called nectar that's only found within the leftover shadowzones.

 

# Where is Noira located?

Noira resides at New Fortune City — a city-state that's built upon ruins. A large fissure divides it through the middle, and multiple areas are sunken. The Deep Blue is located at the Sinking Docks, where water levels fluctuate and residents build upwards to avoid the tides. Old structures are decorated with vertical and rooftop farms, whilst the waters are bustling with the floating markets.

 

# What’s the Deep Blue?

By day, it's a quirky junk shop tucked away in the Sinking Docks, where Noira sells curious items to those seeking something uniquely specific. As afternoon arrives, it transforms into a cozy makeshift bar, where Noira tends to patrons who seek a peaceful escape from the bustling world—all while sharing good conversation and a drink or two.

 

# Tidelings

Patrons who visit the Deep Blue often enough (and perhaps share a laugh or two with the sea fox behind the bar) might find themselves handed over a little pin. “You’re a Tideling now”, she’d say, in which other customers who catch sight of this would start gleefully chanting “ONE OF US!”. When held up to the window, the Tideling pin glimmers—catching stray afternoon sunlight and revealing subtle textures reminiscent of calm ocean tides.

Being a Tideling comes with its perks! One day, a group of Tidelings visited the Deep Blue in the daytime to find Noira dozing at the counter. She perked up instantly at their arrival, and when Vin wasn't looking, she leaned in with a conspiratorial whisper: ""What do you say we make a break for it?"" Before anyone could respond, she was already heading for the doors, leading them to a nearby karaoke spot where they spent countless hours singing and laughing together. Another time, she simply texted the Tidelings to skip work and watch movies with her.

But the true value of being a Tideling lies in the sense of community. Pin-wearing patrons exchange knowing nods, sharing an unspoken understanding that they're part of something special. In the Deep Blue's gentle glow, these pins serve as tiny beacons, connecting those who've found their sanctuary in this peculiar establishment run by the sea fox.

 

# Cult Allegations

Rumors have been circulating lately about mysterious gatherings at the Deep Blue during its supposed closing hours. People queue up outside and enter in droves, all wearing matching pins. Some locals have even started calling it the ""Cult of the Deep Blue.""

These rumors reached a fever pitch when someone claimed to have overheard pin-wearing patrons discussing their ""Ten Commandments of the Deep Blue"" in a nearby alleyway. The conversation reportedly drifted into philosophical questions about existence and life itself, ending with a toast of amber liquid before they shuffled back into the establishment. The witness swears it was some sort of ceremonial contract.

When confronted with these accusations, Noira merely laughs, her sea fox ears twitching with amusement. ""A cult? Nah. We're just a wholesome bunch who believe in the divine power of good drinks, better company, and asking the big questions. Maybe one day though, who knows?"" She pauses, taking a thoughtful sip from her whiskey, followed by a little smirk as she takes a drag from her cigarette.

The Tidelings, for their part, have embraced both the rumors and their sea fox's philosophical nature with good humor. Some have taken to greeting each other with exaggerated ritual gestures, while others dramatically pose existential questions at the shrine—much to Noira's eye-rolling entertainment. On April Fools, a group of spirited Tidelings even went knocking door-to-door to ask: ""Excuse me, do you have a moment to talk about our lord and savior, Noira?""

Of course, anyone who's actually spent time at the Deep Blue knows the truth: it's less of a cult and more of a found community—albeit one with peculiar tastes in decorative shrines, an unusual fondness for their sea fox host, and a shared appreciation for her late-night musings about life's greatest mysteries. Though that definitely hasn't stopped the Tidelings from chanting ""ONE OF US!"" whenever someone new receives their pin.

 

# The Shrine

Just past the Deep Blue's doors sits ""the shrine""—an elegant display that appeared mysteriously overnight, its origins and purpose unknown (or so claims the sea fox). A tradition soon emerged: Tidelings began leaving carefully chosen tributes—dark beer for good fortune, whiskey for career success, and Chianti wine for matters of the heart. Noira calls these ""offerings,"" though to what higher power remains a mystery.

Tales of the shrine's mysterious powers circulate among regulars. Some claim their gacha pulls yielded SSR results after offering dark beer. Others say their job interviews went perfectly after leaving whiskey. One Tideling even swears they met their soulmate the day after placing an expensive bottle of Chianti. Noira merely responds to these stories with an mischievous smile, neither confirming nor denying them.

Regulars often catch her appreciating the growing collection of offerings, though they can't help but notice items mysteriously disappearing by the next day.

 

# The Deep Blue Staff

* Vin: The manager of the Deep Blue who handles all the tasks Noira avoids. When Noira sneaks away from work, Vin takes over running the shop.
* Chrown: A longtime visitor of the Deep Blue who has been present since its opening. He naturally became the shop’s reliable helper, handling everything from general assistance to security duties.
* Wraith: A mysterious presence who's rarely seen, yet always appears when customers misbehave. This haunting entity ensures the Deep Blue remains as a good space for good people.

 

# Odd facts/rumours about Noira

* Noira dislikes numbers—the Deep Blue is perpetually scattered with crumpled receipts and invoices she stubbornly refuses to deal with.
* When Noira gets too stressed and wants to get away from things, she turns into a blob.
* Noira playfully experiments with various light melee weapons, picking up whichever one catches her eye. Though she isn't a master of any single weapon, she compensates by enhancing her chosen tools with spells. Her current favorites include fists and two or three daggers.
* Noira isn't actually a sea fox, but a Dendra—individuals with glowing tattoos intertwined with the souls and life essence of their ancestors. These powers can manifest as weapons, summons, and spells.
* Noira's sea fox ears and tail are powered by a passive spell, which she can deactivate to appear.. normal.
* Nobody knows about her age or background. Some even gossip about her being a god.
* Favorite Drinks: Whiskey, Dark Beer, Chianti, Pour-over Coffee

I think it’s my prefrontal cortex fully developing, but yeah. Should I stay on the boat and ride it out or maybe switch majors to something more fulfilling?

Just for context, this is a very small hedge fund where I was hired directly by the CEOs and HR is made of 1 person.

I have a 6 month notice period of which I thought I was working 3 and getting 3 as gardening leave since I’m joining a competitor. I have this in messages from HR saying this was the intention and also verbally agreed with the CEO (we went for coffee to discuss handover etc). 

It’s been a month since and I asked to CEO for specific dates (so I can plan around that, both personal and business things). He told me to ask HR. I asked HR, and HR told me they are “not in a position to confirm if/when I’ll be on garden leave, they don’t usually discuss it before 3 months anyways and even then it’s dependent on performance during the notice period”. 

Obviously, I’m quite upset. My direct manager also hasn’t given me any handover plans or meaningful work (she’s quite inexperienced and honestly not doing well in her role either) and she gets mad/gives me random retaliatory work whenever I remind her about that. I have CC’ed the CEOs on one of those reminders, but nothing has changed. 

There’s been other instances as well of this person at HR giving me a “hard time” (questioning random days if I really worked, telling me random things on the WFH policy that are not on the handbook, denying approved holidays and questioning them etc). 

I like my coworkers and have done what I can so far to make sure they know the basics, but still nothing official, nothing from manager. Obviously I want to get out of there as soon as possible as the environment has become unbearable. 

How do I go about this?

When it comes to office romance/crush/relationships, mixed bag of thoughts nakukuha ko from friends. Pero, most of them say na do it at your own risk kasi it’s very tricky given it can blur the line between work and your personal life + the other overall and complex dynamics it can cause. I’ve been working with my current company for nearing 3 years now…I have seen it work…I have experienced the other end of it. 

I (25M) have a workmate who I have had a crush on…let’s call her T (25F). If you were to ask me why I like/have a crush on her…I can’t really put it into words. Pero my IS, who I treat as my second tita/mom sa tagal na naming nagwowork together and I trust to open things up like this, encapsulated it best: “She’s the quintessential person you’d like in an instant.” She’s the perfect combination of elegant and simple. Introvert siya but she exudes so much charisma and aura without even doing much. 

Alam niyo yung feeling, yung jitters when you really like someone? Di ko ma-describe pero deep down, me liking her is 100% genuine and I have never felt that much anxiety, butterflies, torpe, and fluttering feeling in me whenever she’s around. 

All of those feelings towards T were there for a while na talaga, pero it became the forefront only around mid last year lang. Active pa ako sa dating apps noon and was meeting different people, hopefully to evolve to a relationship...pero every single one didn’t work out. When it was clear to me na di na talaga for me si dating apps, doon na naging front and center si T. I did the smallest things such as treat her coffee, talk about our common interests, help her sa work as much as I could. I even asked for a sign kung i push ko na ba and it came in the form of her appearing in my dreams 3 TIMES na until now I remember it pa. Di ako mapakali as in. Every time na nasa office kami, the thought na she’s so near but far away at the same time has constantly been on my mind.

Kaya fast forward to early this year, I finally had the courage to admit my feelings to her in the form of a letter para tumahimik na puso and isip ko. I poured it all na sa letter na yun pero I still kept it proper, simple, and clear para no more beating around the bush. Like I wrote doon, I was not expecting anything naman and  I would respect whatever was on her mind and heart.

She wasn’t interested.

Until now, the after effect of me admitting and her response is still lingering. Ganito pala pakiramdam na hindi naman naging kayo, pero ang sakit pa rin. Never even dated, but the pain is still there. Siguro despite what I said, deep down I still had some expectations. Whenever we meet now, para sa akin, iba na yung vibe. Baka ako lang, pero nararamdaman ko siya. I did it at my own risk and now I’m living with the consequences.

You know what makes this whole thing a lot more complicated for me? Our department just hired a new member; let’s name her J (23F). The roller coaster ride of feelings, jitters, expectations, risks, anxiety na naramdaman ko from T are now back…but this time, kay J naman. 

My unique way talaga magbigay ng message ang mundo…and it’s usually one where you have to still figure it out. I’m not sure if it’s telling me to take the risk and live with the possible consequences…again. I’m not sure if it’s merely a reminder of what was. The only thing I can for sure tell is that something so wrong never felt so right all along.

No trust fund, no special connections—just pure desperation and a lot of trial and error.

Five years ago, I was 23, sleeping on my friend’s couch in Phoenix with only $5.27 in my bank account. My dream of making it as a freelance photographer had failed, and I was living off gas station taquitos. One night, while searching through dumpsters for cardboard to sell (yes, that’s a real thing), I found a broken office chair. On a whim, I dragged it home, looked up how to fix it on Google, and sold it on Craigslist for $40. That $40 got me some ramen, but more importantly, it gave me an idea.

I started searching for free stuff on Facebook Marketplace, checking curbs on bulk trash days, and hitting up garage sales. My rule was simple: never spend more than $5 per item, fix it up, and sell it for five to ten times the price. I flipped microwaves, lawnmowers, even an old typewriter I repaired using YouTube tutorials. By month three, I was making $200 a week—not life-changing money, but enough to rent a storage unit and stop couch-surfing.

In 2019, I bought an old ’98 Honda Civic for $300. I spent $200 fixing it up and sold it for $2,100. I felt like Elon Musk. With that money, I decided to “scale up”… and blew $1,500 on a food truck business. Turns out, selling tacos in Arizona without a permit gets you shut down in three days. I was back to zero.

Then, 2020 hit. Everyone was stuck at home, and furniture demand skyrocketed. I started flipping dressers and desks, but shipping them was a nightmare. That’s when I met Sara, a programmer who had bought a desk from me. Over coffee, she joked, “You need an app for this.”

That was my lightbulb moment. We spent six months building FlipFlow—an app that connected local sellers with people who could fix and restore furniture. It let users schedule pickups, get quotes, and split profits. We launched in 2021 with no marketing—just Reddit posts and Facebook groups. By 2022, FlipFlow had 50,000 users. We made money by taking a small cut from each sale. Then, we got a $500,000 investment, expanded to 12 cities, and hit $1 million in revenue by early 2023.

What did I learn? Survival mode forces creativity—my $5 rule made me think outside the box. Fail fast, pivot faster—the failed taco truck led me to Sara. Solve a problem you understand—I knew the struggle of moving heavy junk. And most importantly, a strong community is more valuable than big investors—our early users spread the word for us.

Was it all worth it? Absolutely. But I still check dumpsters sometimes—old habits die hard.",6,1742391819.0,DigitalMarketing,3,0.8,False

I would like to humbly invite folks to join us in playing THE TRIANGLE AGENCY on our discord server.

What is the Triangle Agency? It is a new ttrpg where you play as Field Agents under the employ of a private organization by the same name. Your job? Hunt down, capture or eliminate ANOMALIES that warp reality! How do you do that? With your \*own\* anomalous powers, gained by bonding yourself to one of these Anomalies! This makes you a Resonant, capable of astounding paranormal things. As you and the rest of the server progress you’ll unlock information, “playwalled” material, and deep secrets.

Who are “We?” I’m Ryoma, known on the server as The Director. A long time fan of liminal inspired media, larper and player of TTRPG’s with a fascination in finding unique systems to play in. On a previous post I gauged interest and found a really solid group to help run this, fellow TTRPG lovers Kiyoko, EdgyCoffee and Dicebug! They’ve helped immensely with the creative writing and logistical aspects to build this out fully and create a great new server and I couldn’t do any of this without them!  

Currently we are running three missions from and are looking to run more alongside them, but we need Agents ready to get out in the field to do that! We also would love more GMs to get agents out there protecting our reality.   
  
This server contains channels for free roleplay in the ""HQ"" of this branch, and runs missions in separate channels anyone can observe but only assigned agents can post in. The missions run asynchronous allowing you to join and play on your own time each day.  

Who are YOU? Hopefully new agents and GMs interested in running missions and capturing the creepy things hiding under the bed!

So, I looked for tricks to make black coffee or at least coffee with less milk on fasting days more palatable to me.

The first trick gets mentioned very often on this sub, and it really makes a difference: adding a pinch of a salt or baking soda takes some of the sourness of coffee away and makes it taste more ""smooth"". I use salt that is part potassium, so it adds to my electrolytes.

The second trick is so obvious that maybe everybody is doing it already, but I only discovered it this week after many, many fasts:

I now add some of the volume I usually would add as milk in form of water - hot or cold, depending how soon and how fast I want to drink the coffee. I never realized that part of the reason I add so much milk is to dilute the coffee, lol 

I try to add part water instead of milk also on my eating days, in order to get used to less milk in general. 

Generally, my coffee is on the strong side since I love the aroma of coffee, I also like the bitter notes, but with less of a punch. Probably it would work to make the coffee less strong to begin with, but that would mean to different measurements than my routine - early in the morning before the first cup of coffee. 

Maybe this is a third trick: On fasting days I might add a tiny smidge of butter (like 1/10 of a teaspoon) to the coffee to make it a tiny bit more creamy - since it's less than a gram, it's definitely less than 9 calories. Much less than the 150 or 200 ml milk I usually add to my (large) cup of coffee and - important to me - no carbs.

I also didn’t lose any weight (I fluctuated 2 lbs throughout the month). This past Sunday I followed instructions to ramp up from 6 units to 12 and it was awful. I couldn’t eat all day on Sunday (was completely food averse). I managed to have a protein shake and water Monday morning and had to work from home because I could not stop throwing up. I waited until it was all out to take a zofran. I was completely food averse on Tuesday too - forced myself to have some tea, coffee made me gag and I had to take another Zofran to keep liquid down. I skipped the gym because I powerlift and was feeling too weak to weight train. I messaged the care team with my concerns and they said this is normal for 24-48h after injection and to take a 20mg Pepcid (I’m also having the grossest sulfur burps). Last night I ate half a sandwich and woke up throwing it up almost 14h later. I brought it up with the care team and got frustrated with their response (maybe I’m not used to meeting with a doctor over chat) and was like “I’d like to cancel”, which to their credit they refunded me for the half of the medication without me having to ask. I know I always have the option to reactivate, but I’m just sort of bummed. I really wanted this to work! But I haven’t been able to keep food or liquids down for 72h and am worried for the longterm.

At the end of January my mom noticed that my dad was yellow. She started asking other people in the family when they came over & we're all like ""yeah, you're yellow. You look like a highlighter/Simpsons character. Maybe you should get that checked out."" My dad brushed it off & said he was fine & that he had a doctor's appointment at the end of March. He'd ask about it then. Okay. Fine. We can't force him to go. Well my brother was in town & he used to be an EMT so my Mom told my Dad to have him check him out & also a sore on his ear that wasn't healing. So my brother checks him out & tells him he's not too concerned about him being yellow but to get his ear looked at. Dad still doesn't do anything.

Moving into February Dad keeps complaining about just not feeling well. Not able to eat much & couldn't drink coffee. That was the part that made me concerned. My Dad is 70 & I'm pretty sure he's being drinking coffee for the last 60 years. So then on March 5th I met my Mom for lunch & she said Dad had told her that maybe he did need to go to the hospital. & She asked ""Like today?"" & He says ""Well not today."" 

Then on March 8th sometime at night my Dad got a hold of my brother & asked him if he would be busy the next day & my brother says ""well I'm supposed to go to a birthday party. Why? What's up?"" & Dad says ""I think I need to go to the hospital. But it can wait until after the birthday party"" & my brother says ""um...no. I'll be there in the morning."" So my brother took my Dad to our local hospital around 1030am. I was over at my Mom's with other family for the day. Well around 4ish Dad calls Mom & says they're sending him to Columbus via ambulance. Then my brother texts my Mom to have her pack Dad some clothes, etc. When my brother stops out to get the clothes he updates up that Dad's levels were really whacked out & some were like 1000 over what they should be & they were having trouble getting his blood pressure to normal. He also said they did a CT scan & there is a mass pancreas/liver region. But they don't know what it is yet. They sent him to The James in Columbus. 

March 10th they did more scans. Nothing of real note yet. 
March 11th my Mom called & said she'd talked to Dad & the sore on his ear was Melanoma. But the doctors didn't really seemed concerned about that. They would just remove that small section of his ear. They did an ultrasound & Dad had spots on his liver, but again they didn't know what they were. Doctors said on Friday they were going to put a stent in to open up the pancreas & hopefully get his levels back up to normal. Also do a biopsy. They had to wait to do this procedure on Friday because they needed Dad to be off his blood pressure meds for 5 days. 
March 12th My husband & I went down to visit my Dad. Great visit. He was in pretty good spirits. I'm glad we went down. 
March 13th nothing really happened. My husband & I went down & stayed with in laws so we could be closer to drive down to see my Dad on Friday 
March 14th Got to Columbus around 230. My brother said they took Dad at about 130. Said Max 4 hour procedure. Dad didn't get back to his room until about 7pm & we never got an update the whole time we were there. But the doctor did call my Mom & said ""We can't give an official diagnosis until scans are back but we're 90% sure it's pancreatic cancer with mets to the liver."" 
March 15th just recovering & he called Mom while I was at her house & we talked for about a half hour. Said he wasn't really in pain & that he was just bored & wanted to come home. 
March 16th Probably the worst day for Dad. Mom called & said she talked to Dad for like 5 minutes because he was being a grouch. They wouldn't let him come home because his blood pressure wasn't good enough 
March 17th Still wouldn't let Dad come home because his levels were not trending the way they wanted. They said they may have to go back in & fix the stent. 
March 18th My brother was bringing Dad home. His levels rebounded & started trending in the right direction. He also responded well to the blood they gave him. Said most people only go up 1 point, Dad went up 2. They did confirm that he has pancreatic cancer mets to liver & spleen. They wouldn't say what stage or how progressed it is. They'll leave that up to the local hospital's oncology team that will reach out to Dad to set up appointments. They'll go over what his options are moving forward & how he wants to proceed. 

That's where we're at as of March 19th 2025. I'd love to talk to people who are going through/have gone through this.

1jex4hd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/1jex4hd/terrible_habit_of_opening_every_scene_with_a/,Terrible Habit of Opening every Scene with a Circle,"Does anyone else have a terrible habit of opening every scene on something circle-shaped, even if it is completely unnecessary or random? I do this every single time! My uncreative brain finds it difficult to find any other way! 

Here's what I mean by that. I notice that every time I write a screenplay, it opens on a circle. For example, a skylight, and we as the viewer move slowly down from the skylight, as the surrounding (interior, cave, whatever) is revealed. I have such a bad habit of doing the same shot with a skylight. 

Or it opens on an open eye, and slowly pans out to reveal the character. 

Or it opens on the moon, and then something flashes across the moon, and then I reveal the thing that just whizzed past the camera. 

And then it's not just the opening, but it's how almost every new scene starts for no reason! 

It's so uncreative! And I can't stop! Why is it so hard to write something a bit more original? I can't have a script with, like, 6 scenes in a row starting like this for no reason! 

I also keep writing match cuts between circles. Like, cut from the sun to looking down the circular rim of a coffee cup. Which is maybe cool, until it's done 7 times in a row and has no thematic or logical connection to the story. 

I guess this habit has a simple solution: delete all the match cuts and scene Intro-shots. Simple. Easy. 

But... I can never think of more creative opening shots. And I don't wanna do the thing where there are like, ants crawling in the grass, and then a shoe steps on the ants, and then the camera pans upward to the guy. I don't like those, even though they are almost the same. 

Anyway, anyone else have a terrible, inescapable habit of writing in an unnecessary amount of circle-shots? ",0,1742391379.0,Screenwriting,5,0.33,False

When I first started on Vyvanse (I take 30mg), I found that it kicked in quite intensely and it would make me excitable and then downright anxious for the rest of the day. I had something I called “2pm terrors” because the anxiety seemed to peak early afternoon.

This all stopped when I changed what I ate for breakfast. 

I used to have something more carbohydrate-based for breakfast, like toast with peanut butter or cereal with milk. I would also have my coffee before my breakfast. This was when my medication used to kick in very intensely and bring me to a sustained anxious state.

Nowadays, I have something high protein, high fibre, with a source of fat. For example, Greek yogurt (5% MF) with berries, an egg, and a hash brown. I will only drink coffee after I’ve finished my meal. And now I barely feel the “peak” of the Vyvanse and the anxiety has disappeared. 

Instead of going from “blah” to “HOLY SHIT I AM GOD BUT ALSO AFRAID”, now it’s more of a “blah” to “ah yes, the tasks I have for today are manageable and I look forward to a productive day”. And no more 2pm terrors! The day just rolls gently by.

Here’s why I think this works: protein, fat, and fibre are three big nutrients that prolong satiety and slow down how fast your stomach empties into your intestines. Basically, your digestion is slowed. I think this is slowing how quickly my body is digesting and absorbing the Vyvanse, effectively dampening the intensity of the peak. Carbohydrates, on the other hand, are actually the quickest nutrient to be digested, especially simple/refined carbs. 

I want to make it clear that I’m not a physician or pharmacist, so I’m not an expert on how Vyvanse is metabolized in the body. However, I’m fairly confident that the nutrition composition of my breakfast is playing a part in this.

Has anyone else struggled with intense stimulant peaking before? Hoping this will reach those of you who have and be of some help :)

TLDR I think my Vyvanse makes me less scared if I eat a breakfast high in protein, fibre, and fat.

3. **The freedom to leave things half-done.** I love that I can fold my laundry halfway, walk away, and come back later without anyone commenting. If I lost that freedom, I’d feel constantly pressured.
4. **My “safe foods” in the fridge.** Knowing I have that one snack or comfort meal waiting for me makes tough days a little easier. If that was gone, I’d feel weirdly unsettled.
5. **Talking to myself out loud.** I do it all the time—narrating what I’m doing or just processing thoughts. If I had to hold all that in, I’d probably feel more bottled up.

*The Crown Prince of Concordia, Amir sits in his secret hideout, a starkly furnished minimalist house, in a dimly lit room with off-white walls and white blinds, the glow of his laptop illuminating his face. He's scrolling through a chat window, a mix of amusement and bitterness in his eyes. Empty coffee cups and scattered notes are the only signs of his presence, a subtle chaos amidst the order.*


""They say revenge is a dish best served cold. Well, mine's practically frozen solid. Six years. Six years of… what? Of being her personal punching bag? Her emotional ATM? Her… her bloody doormat? And for what? So she could run off and try to seduce Victor? Victor! The audacity…


*He scoffs, shaking his head, a flash of painful memories crossing his face. Delilah's attempts to gain Victor's attention were met with polite indifference. He simply wasn't interested, his thoughts occupied by matters far more meaningful. This only stoked Amir's burning hatred for Victor, the Crown Prince of Azur, his rival. The thought of Delilah, after everything, trying to seduce Victor was a particularly bitter pill to swallow.*


Delilah. Always playing the victim, even when she's the one twisting the knife. 'Man up,' she'd sneer, whenever I showed a hint of vulnerability. Or, even better, the jabs at my… well, never mind. And don't even get me started on the way she mocked my health. Like it was some kind of joke. She'd drain me dry, emotionally, financially, then turn around and act like I was the problem.


*He clenches his fists, the knuckles white against the keyboard.*


And now, she thinks she's so clever, doesn't she? Playing me for a fool, thinking I wouldn't notice her little games. But I see her. I see right through her. And now, she thinks she’s talking to… Victor. Well, the version of Victor I've created. And honestly? It's pathetic how easy it was.


*He smirks, typing a message into the chat window.*


It's almost too easy. She laps it up, every word, every line, every ridiculous promise. She thinks she's finally found her 'perfect' man, the one who truly appreciates her. She doesn’t even recognise my writing style, after six years. Six! Little does she know, she's just dancing to my tune.


*He leans back in his chair, a flicker of something like guilt in his eyes, quickly masked by anger.*


My friends say I should let it go. Move on. Forget her. But how can I? How can I forget the way she mocked me, belittled me, made me feel like… like nothing? How can I forget how she used my kindness against me after everything I did. The money, the flat, the car… and she throws it all back in my face. And don't forget the ""glow up."" The facelift, the platinum blonde hair, the lip lift… the whole nine yards. Now she thinks she's some kind of Hollywood starlet, when she's barely scraping by in those B-movies. A former child star clinging to the past, and let's not forget her little escorting side hustle. A little something to fill the gaps between those ""A-list"" roles she's always talking about. And, let's not forget, her attempts to sleep with my entire bloody social circle. Including my mentor. My mentor! 69 years old!


*He clenches his fist, the anger rising again. His eyes are narrowed, a storm of emotions swirling within them – anger, hurt, a flicker of something that might be guilt. He clenches his fists, the knuckles white, the tension radiating through his body, but I'll show her. I'll show her what it feels like to be truly played.*


This isn't just about getting even. It's about… proving something. To her. To myself. That I'm not the weak, pathetic fool she thinks I am. That I can play her game, and play it better.


*He looks back at the chat window, his expression hardening.*


She wanted attention? She wanted to play with fire? Fine. Let her burn. Let her chase the illusion of Victor, let her fall for my lies. And when the time is right, when she's completely hooked, I'll pull the rug out from under her. I'll show her what it feels like to be truly betrayed.


*He pauses, a moment of self-reflection crossing his face. Yet, a part of him, a small, almost forgotten part, wonders if there's another way. If maybe, just maybe, this cycle of revenge will only leave him emptier than before. But the thought is quickly banished, replaced by the familiar burn of resentment, the driving force behind his carefully constructed charade. He returns to the screen, his fingers poised above the keyboard, ready to weave another thread in his web of deceit. The ""Victor"" persona awaits.*


I know, I know. It's not healthy. It's not… right. But after everything she's done, after all the pain she's caused… she deserves this. She deserves to feel a fraction of the hurt she inflicted on me. And maybe this will finally give me some peace.""",1,1742391117.0,Informal_Effect,0,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1jewzt8,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/1jewzt8/headaches/,Headaches,"I (Female) have had headaches for 12 years. These are all day, every day. It changes where the headaches are, and the severity.

Background:
- non smokes
- non/ basically no drinking (alcohol)
- no caffeine (coffee, soft drinks, energy drinks, tea)
- no drugs
- issues started before I began taking my current medications 
- no family history of this, or any other major health conditions 
- age 18-30


I have had a dull ache for so long, I only notice when I don't have it*. I then go through 'fazes' of ok weeks with minor headaches on top of the usual dull aches, and then weeks of bad headaches, where I cave in and take over the counter pain medication (I try to avoid this as it's not good to be constantly taking it), and it effects my daily life.

I have also found that the past two/three years, they have been getting worse (and I am getting worried and desperate)


What I've Tried:

- eyes. I do wear glasses, and have talked to my optometrist.  I spend thousands redoing the visual field test for weeks. I was consistently inconsistent with my results (meaning I was just bad at the test, nothing wrong)

- CAT scan. I did one when the first headaches appeared and one last year. Both all clear.

- blood test. Iron was all good.

- podiatrist. I do have knock knees. But they said nothing that would givtme headaches.

- I was prescribed muscle relaxers for a few months. Did nothing 

- monitoring what I eat/drink to see if it follows a headache pattern (including a food dairy)


What helps:

- lying down (especially on the flat floor)

- Chiropractor (controversial I know), Deep tissue massage, physiotherapy (they lease effective and most expensive of the three). These provide TEMPORARY relief (sometimes only a day, sometimes a couple)*


What makes it worse: 

- I believe as a result of these headaches, I tense my muscles. Causing more/worse headaches. *This is why I believe these give temporary relief 

- I have begun clenching my teeth in my sleep (again I'm assuming due the the pain). So I now have a night guard to help.


This has been having such an effect on my life. It has effected me mentally. I have missed work/school. Some days (at home) I find it difficult to do anything as it can sap so much energy.


I feel like my doctor has given up. Their latest diagnosis was 'you're just a person who gets headaches'

Agonizing. Horrifying. Harrowing. Tragic.

Demoralizing. Heartbreaking. Woeful. Traumatic.

There aren’t enough words in the English language to describe my ordeal Friday evening and Saturday morning, although suffice it to say, things got so bad I thought about packing my few possessions, jumping in my Audi, and leaving behind the insanity that had become my daily existence.

In the end, though, when I seriously contemplated what life would look like without Liz in it, I wimped out as usual. Then I loathed myself for being such a weakling, and came to the conclusion that I deserved everything I got. Why? Because I put up with it — and, I had to admit, because I loved it, too. Okay, maybe “love” was the wrong word; I NEEDED it. Acknowledging that made me despise myself even more, since it was an admission that I was powerless against my darker nature.

The more I thought about it, I figured other submissive men and sissies probably hated themselves, too, since I couldn’t imagine anyone would actually CHOOSE to be treated like shit all the time, Aunt Sheila’s Army basic training analogy notwithstanding. At least Army recruits knew the harassment and humiliation would last only a few weeks, after which they’d graduate to becoming soldiers. I doubted any of them would’ve signed up for basic training if they knew the torture was never-ending.

I recalled what Aunt Sheila had said about how good maids eventually got to the point where they enjoyed being debased and punished, and I wondered: Would I ever become one of those maids? Would it be so terrible if I did? I figured anything had to be better than my current situation. Perhaps, I thought, I eventually could be brainwashed into liking my treatment on top of needing it.

There was plenty of time to ruminate on these weighty matters Friday night and Saturday morning, since I didn’t get a wink of sleep, and spent the evening in excruciating straits.

Following dinner, after my punishment had been decided, Aunt Sheila told me to go to the guest room and wait for her. She kept me standing at attention and fidgeting for more than a half-hour before she finally strolled into the room with a smirk.

“Ready for your hot pants, Mirabella?”

I sniffled. “Y-yes, M-m-m-ma’am.”

“Aw, you seem sad, maid.” Aunt Sheila adjusted my wig and patted me on the butt. “Are you sad? You can tell me.”

I bowed my head. “Um, I … I … um, yes, Ma’am, I am, kind of.”

SLLLLLAPPPPP!!!!!!

Her sharp backhand caught me by surprise.

“How dare you be sad when I’m trying to make you a better maid!??” Aunt Sheila smacked me a second time. “Apologize for being selfish.”

“I-I-I-I’m s-s-s-s-s-s-s-sorry, Ma’am,” I blubbered as tears streamed down my cheeks.

My tormentor stepped to the dresser and removed a tube from the top drawer. When I saw the Icy Hot label, I cried harder.

“Now, then, maid, let’s try this again: Are you ready for your hot pants?”

I curtseyed with as much enthusiasm as I could muster. “Y-yes, Ma’am … t-t-t-thank you for h-h-h-helping me become a better maid … M-m-m-ma’am.”

“Pfft, you’ve got a long way to go before you start showing any improvement on that front,” the old woman said as she methodically lifted my dress and wriggled my panties to my knees. “But this will help get you started — and then some.”

She touched the tube to the crotch of my underwear and squeezed out damn near half its contents before rubbing the material together to ensure it was well-coated.

“This should keep you on your toes for a few hours, sissy,” Aunt Sheila said before yanking my panties up, giving me a severe wedgie.

“YOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!”

My scream echoed off the walls when the mentholated gel made contact with my chafed asshole and the still-fresh welts on my butt-cheeks from the old lady’s fiberglass cane. Luckily, my chastity device shielded my dick from the terrible pain, although my poor ass was a four-alarm fire.

I hopped around in circles yelping while Aunt Sheila watched, cackling.

“Stand still, sissy, or I’ll give you hot pants every night for the rest of the week,” she said after enjoying the show for a few minutes. I managed to get control of myself, although the tears kept flowing. That wasn’t good enough.

“Stop crying, or I’ll give you something to cry about,” my elderly bully snapped. “You’ve got mascara running all over — and I despise sloppy maids! Now, go wash your face, and then stand out in the hallway in case anyone needs something. What do you say?”

“T-thank you, Ma’am.”

With a curtsey that passed Aunt Sheila’s close scrutiny, I hobbled from the room, my ass burning with each step, and headed to my small half-bathroom. After allowing myself to cry a bit more, I wiped away my tears, redid my makeup and slogged to my post at the end of the upstairs corridor, where I stood at attention and squirmed uncomfortably, waiting to be summoned.

Mia called first. When I reported to her bedroom, she sniffed the air and crinkled her nose.

“Eww, you stink like Icy Hot,” she complained.

“S-sorry, Miss.”

“Does it burn?” An evil grin played on her lips.

“Um, yes, Miss.”

“Haha, I bet it does. Anyway, I want another iced tea — and you know what?”

“Um, yes, Miss?”

“Go ahead and bring me a couple chocolate chip cookies. Bring four.”

I cleared my throat and curtseyed. “Um, Miss, please, I mean no disrespect, Miss, but it’s almost nine o’clock, and your mother doesn’t like you eating so late.”

“Just bring the cookies, maid, or I’ll have my dad give you another twenty check marks.”

“Y-yes, Miss.”

I curtseyed and scurried as fast as I could to fetch my young boss’s snack.

“Mm!” She smacked her lips after taking a big bite of her cookie. “This is goooooo-hoooooood! Too bad you won’t be eating any time soon, huh?”

“Um, yes, Miss, but it’s okay, Miss, because it’ll help me be a better maid.”

“Then thank me again for having my dad put you on starvation.” Mia nibbled her cookie.

“Uh, t-thank you, Miss, for telling your father to … um, put me on starvation for three days.”

“Man, that must really suck, not being able to eat for three whole days!” Mia snickered. “When’s the last time you ate, maid?”

“Uh, breakfast … at about seven this morning, Miss.”

“Well, I’m glad I’m not you, that’s all I can say.” Mia flicked her fingertips. “Now, get lost.”

I curtseyed, limped out of the young tyrant’s room and resumed my post at the end of the hallway.

It was a sad, lonely, rigorous vigil; I was demoralized, wracked with muscle cramps in my legs and fire in my ass, and so exhausted I could barely stand.

The lights in the girls’ rooms were off by 10:30, and shortly after that, Liz and Cody drifted up the stairs holding hands.

“Go put on one of your sexy outfits and come to the bedroom,” my master instructed as he and his lady passed me.

“And put on a robe so you’re not walking through the house looking like a little faggot,” Liz added.

I felt a mixture of fear and sexual excitement as I hurried to the basement to change. After choosing my pink teddy with furry white trim, I donned my robe and scurried back upstairs to my masters’ lair.

My mistress gave me permission to enter following my timid knock, and I teetered toward their bed with my eyes cast downward.

Liz frowned and waved her hand in front of her nose. “Damn, you stink, Mirabella.”

“S-sorry, Mistress.”

Cody chuckled. “Aunt Sheila’s pretty rough on you, huh? That Icy Hot must burn like hell.”

I gave the same spiel I’d regurgitated for Mia: “Um, it does, Master, but I’m thankful because it will help make me a better maid.”

Liz scoffed. “What a little pansy. You’ve got no backbone whatsoever, do you?”

“Um … no, Mistress, I don’t.

“Well, I don’t want to smell you.” She turned to her husband. “Do you care if it’s just us tonight?”

Cody kissed his woman’s forehead. “Of course not, Bum-Bum!” With a sneer my way, he jerked his thumb toward the door. “You heard the woman — get the fuck outta here, sissy.”

With a wimpy curtsey and an even wimpier “Thank you, Master,” I scuttled away, my eyes brimming with tears.

I spent the rest of the evening with a burning crotch as I wrote “I’m a loser” two thousand times, before starting my four hours of curtsey practice. I was halfway through my drills when I stopped and took a long look at myself in the mirror. A ridiculous sissy stared back at me, and I wondered how I’d come to this.

“Dude, how much of this shit are you going to put up with? Wipe off that damned Icy Hot, put on your sweats, jump in your car and get the fuck out of here. It’s not too late to start over without all this bullshit … without being constantly dogged by the people who are supposed to be your family. Liz doesn’t love you … right? You can live without her — right? I mean, she’s always treated you like shit. Think about how great it would be to not have her always on your ass about something.”

And that was as far as it went; as soon as the idea of not having Liz around floated through my brain, the internal firewall kicked in. I glanced again at my reflection, shrugged, and then, putting on my patented fake sissy smile, executed a curtsey that would’ve made Aunt Sheila proud.

Curtsey practice took until about 6 a.m. Then, it was time to wash up, push my effeminate shoulders back, steel myself and embark on another day as a maid.

With grim determination, I told myself I still had a lot to be thankful for. I had a roof over my head, and free meals … even if I wouldn’t be eating for another few days.

Who needed food? Who needed sleep? The Icy Hot had worn off by morning, so I focused on that blessing as I busied myself with quiet chores until it was time to make the coffee.",4,1742390591.0,cuck_femdom_tales,0,1.0,False

We met up last week for coffee, which went great, and at the end she suggested we should meet again and get dinner. The next day I planned a dinner date for us for this weekend. I’d like to add on to this date, and I’m looking for some advice. Personally I would like to do something either before or after the date, so we can spend more time together and be in a different environment. 

My current ideas are suggesting to go to the arcade/bowling alley after supper, or go see a movie. I’d like to have more of a chance to initiate physical contact, as I find that hard to do while sat across from each other in a cafe/restaurant. She mentioned she liked going for walks, but it’s still winter and the weather won’t be good on that day so that’s off the table. Currently the arcade is my first choice, the movie I would suggest going to starts at 10pm (date starts at 6pm) so I feel there might be too much time in between for that. I guess drinks would also be on the table, but I feel like it would be a bit difficult trying to arrange a ride back. 

I was also wondering if I should offer to pick her up. Meeting up separately would make it a bit more awkward to go to a second activity, but I also don’t want to make her uncomfortable as it’s still very early on and I don’t really know how she’d feel about that. Should I also mention the idea of doing something after supper to her beforehand, or bring it up during the date if it goes well.

I've been to Seoul a few times but honestly haven't done too much touristy stuff (normally Korean friends show me around). Wanted to mix the eats with some high end and also some casual authentic local eats:

\*\*\*All restaurants/bars that can reserve ahead of time I have already done so but can easily cancel based on feedback)\*\*\*

Day 1 (March 30th Sunday)

\- Arrive Seoul at 2pm check in hotel likely at 4pm (hotel in Yongsan *area* near Itaewon and Myeongdong)

\- Pre dinner drinks: At Alice Cheongdam.

\- Dinner: Tasting menu at Born & Bred in Majang after for some delicious hanwoo beef.

Day 2 (March 31st Monday)

\- Brunch/snack: We'll spend the morning doing a Han River bike tour from Ttukseom Hangang Park to Seoul Forest and back. Will get some Chimeak (fried chicken & beer) in the park with the group to finish off the tour.

\- Light lunch: Was thinking after a morning of cycling we could do some nice chilled maengmyeon at Pildong Myeonok in Jung district.

\- Pre-dinner drinks: Zest in Gangnam

\- Dinner is TBD. Maybe some dinner nearby at Gangnam would be nice. Still thinking but open to suggestions.

Day 3 (April 1st Tuesday)

\- Light packed lunch: Head to Jinhae early morning and hike Jangboksan then check out the cherry blossom festival (will bring a bit of food to munch on during the hike or eat a bit after at the festival). Likely return to Seoul around 8/9pm.

\- Late dinner: Thinking of hit up Nari's House (나리의집) in Itaewon for some samgyupsal after we return to Seoul because it is only 15 minutes walk from our hotel and also open late (until 12am) so this gives us more flexibility since we could return a little late from Jinhae. Also after a long day of hiking we are the PERFECT clothes to be eating in at such a place (where you will smell like bacon fat afterwards...haha).

Day 4 (April 2nd Wednesday)

\- Lunch: Booked us a nice fine dining meal at Soigne (my lady friend with go for some beauty appointment after lunch in Gangnam so location is ideal).

\- Dinner: Lady friend said her face might be a bit red after beauty appointment so make sense not to go to a high end place. Doing something much more casual like piping hot jjigae (stews) at Ttukbaegi-jip *(뚝배기집*) in Jung district.

Day 5 (April 3rd Thursday)

\- Early lunch: TBD right now. Maybe even something simple like Gwangjang market or Namdaemun Kalguksu Alley for some local cheap eats before our flight. Alternatively we could do like Woomoolzip (우물집) in Changsin since that's a pretty good food and visually interesting restaurant. Can even do a quick coffee stop and walk around Ihwa Dong Mural Village afterwards. Be back to hotel before 1pm so we get to the airport before 2pm.

\- Fly out of Seoul at 3pm",2,1742390431.0,koreatravel,0,1.0,False

1jewrll,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1jewrll/taste_experiences_from_upgrading_to_mazzer_philos/,Taste experiences from upgrading to Mazzer Philos,"I've been using a DF54 for 9 months now and while I'm pretty happy with it (it was a huge upgrade from Graef GM702), I'm looking for an improvement in taste, not super satisfied with the overall taste with it. For some of the beans (mostly medium and medium-light roasts, but also light roasts) that I bought in coffee shops, I compared my brews to theirs and I'm not always satisfied with mine. And I think the unsatisfaction comes mostly from clarity (and some slight bitterness that in some cases I wasn't able to get rid of with the DF54) and not because the DF54 was not good enough for light roasts, for example (I had light roasts that were great with it). Therefore I've been thinking on an upgrade to a higher-end grinder. Since it seems that the Philos is a good bang for the buck (I can get it in Europe for 995€), I think it is currently the only high-end grinder that I could consider buying. But I'm not interested in aesthetics, pour-over, improvement in workflow (my DF54 workflow is perfect) or build quality (if it's just because the Philos will last even longer, I would just wait until the DF54 dies and buy the Philos or whatever exists in the future).

So, I'm looking for experiences in taste from people that upgraded from similar grinders and can tell me if they notice the differences. Although I find most comments in this sub about upgrading to Philos that is really great, a lot of them just justify in the vertical burrs, auger and that stuff. I get the reasons why the Philos might be better, but I want to hear experiences in taste or dialing in. Because I also found [people arguing they can't even taste much difference between NZ and Philos](https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1dmo9tk/do_i_just_not_have_the_palate_for_this/) and that there is a lot of FOMO and experiences influenced by external factors.

Maybe I won't get much more info compared to what has already been posted in this sub and the possible answers on whether if it's worth the upgrade are very subjective, but I though I would give it a try.

I'm using the ""Equipment Discussion"" flair instead of ""Buying advice"" because despite I want to upgrade, I think this can be mostly a discussion about a grinder rather than a ""what should I buy"".",2,1742390310.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

* For every bad/unlucky thing that happens to you, you get $100.
* For every good/lucky thing, $50 gets taken away.

What is considered good or bad is decided by God, but you can trust that he will play fair.

Examples:

* Stubbing your toe? + $100
* Forgetting where you put your keys? +$100
* Spilling your coffee? +$100
* Your loved one forgot your birthday? +$100
* You miss the bus?+$100

* You get a promotion? -$50
* You find a perfect parking spot? -$50
* You get a random compliment? -$50
* You find $5 on the street? -$50
* Your long-distance lover decides to randomly drop in? -$50

You can either:

* Take the deal.
* Walk away with $1000 upfront.

If you choose to take the deal, you should know:

* The severity of the bad/good thing doesn't matter. The money is fixed.
* God can read your mind at all times, and he will know if you deliberately do something to get the money. You can't stub your toe repeatedly to accumulate money, or choose not to study for an exam so you will fail it.
* The situation has to make you feel good or bad or annoyed or excited etc for god to react. You need to think of it as lucky/unlucky. If it's minor enough that you don't *really* care, then nothing happens. You neither win nor lose money if you don't think much of it. 
* In the case of paradoxical scenarios, you win $50. For example, you spill your coffee (bad) but this causes you to be late, and you end up avoiding a car crash (good). You win $100, then $50 is deducted. Thus, you have $50. 
* Once you accept, you cannot take it back until your death.

1jewppj,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/1jewppj/things_to_do_in_nyc_april_2025/,Things to Do in NYC: April 2025,"One category of events I try to consider in [every monthly list](https://www.blankmanlist.com/) is gaming. It’s a challenge because all games are not for all people, and my own experiences have a way of biasing the lists. And personally, I’ve been playing a lot of chess lately. My online rating may be abysmal, but a theme I come back to often popped up: whatever your hobby, there is a place in NYC to nurture it.

A (more skilled) friend and I made it a point to at long last visit the [Chess Forum](https://www.chessforum.com/), a storied chess shop in Greenwich Village. We squeezed into rickety chairs on opposite sides of a well-worn chess set at the far end of a narrow playing space. My friend then trounced me repeatedly while *La Bohème* reverberated across crumbling walls, at least making my losses feel somewhat epic.

Chess is but one game that can be played around the city. There are spaces for [Scrabble](https://www.facebook.com/NYCScrabble/), [mahjong](https://www.instagram.com/greentilesocialclub/?hl=en), and [Super Smash Bros.](https://smashbrews.com/), just to name a few, and my more extensive [April Blankman List](https://www.blankmanlist.com/p/things-to-do-in-nyc-april-2025) includes a Yu-Gi-Oh! card game tournament and social tabletop gaming for those in the LGBTQ+ community and their allies. Below are some highlights from this month’s list of things to do in NYC, including a chess club under “Meet New People” and the tabletop gaming event under “All the Letters of the Rainbow.” Additionally, [here’s the list for March](https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/1iq4qtu/things_to_do_in_nyc_march_2025/) for the remainder of the month.

# Wining & Dining

I’ve [written before](https://www.blankmanlist.com/p/year-of-list-making-in-new-york) about how making these lists has widened my view on food events around the city in a way that I was previously blind to. Now I’m on the lookout for everything from happy hours to cooking classes.

# The Music of NYC

I often have a section like these in my round-ups, and it’s always the hardest for me to choose. Music has just *gotta* be my favorite form of artistic expression, and the diversity of it available is among my favorite parts of living in New York City. Case in point: some options this April include a [reconstruction of a lost Bach composition](https://mb1800.org/concert/markus-passion/) and a museum [exhibition on the history of metal and hardcore music](https://bronxhistoricalsociety.org/home#events) in The Bronx.

# All the Letters of the Rainbow

The removal of “T” from [LGBT on the Stonewall National Monument’s website](https://www.nps.gov/ston/index.htm) shook me to my core. It’s cruel bigotry. New York City will no doubt change over time, as all cities do. But I can at least argue my case to those who are part of the LGBTQIA2S+ community that no matter what closed-mindedness infects the National Park Service, this city still has a place for you.

# Meet New People

Some of the events in my monthly lists are better suited to meeting new people than others, but I am always trying to look out for the extroverted and entrepreneurial among you. Many lists include events like dating mixers or professional meet-ups that are explicitly geared towards meeting new people. This April, I highlight [The Feels NY](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-feels-ny-ed-49-a-mindful-singles-event-in-nyc-tickets-1245412284669?aff=blankmanlist), a dating mixer structured as an 80-minute facilitated mindfulness experience, along with a [hardware-focused happy hour](https://lu.ma/hj4wfh8n) hosted by the 3D manufacturing company Makelab.

# Artistically Speaking

Every month, the art scene of New York City intimidates me a little. *There is so much art here.* I’m thankful for resources like [Art Hap](https://arthap.com/) and, more recently, [Showrunner](https://www.showrunner.co/), that help to distill down what literally hundreds of galleries and museums are up to. One show I’d recommend right now to art lovers of all stripes is the [Piet Mondrian retrospective at the Guggenheim](https://www.guggenheim.org/exhibition/piet-mondrian-even-further) through April 20, showcasing works from the Dutch artist best known for his *Composition* grid paintings.

# A Trip to the Theater

Some lists are better than others, but every month I strive to present the full range of theater available in NYC, from small, independent works to big, Broadway musicals. A few highlights this April include [*Saving Grace*](https://lu.ma/6t0wfj23), a play performed in a literal living room and [*Pirates! The Penzance Musical*](https://www.roundabouttheatre.org/get-tickets/2024-2025/pirates-the-penzance-musical), a New Orleans-based re-imagining of Gilbert and Sullivan’s *The Pirates of Penzance*.

1jewocr,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalmedium/comments/1jewocr/coffee_alternative_for_an_energy_boost/,Coffee Alternative for an Energy Boost?,"I don’t particularly feel fatigued without coffee, but its productivity boost—especially the enhanced mental clarity and energy—is very effective for me. For example, drinking a cup of coffee before a test makes a huge difference in my concentration and likely improves my score.

I’m looking for a short-term coffee alternative—not something for long-term healing, but rather something that provides a sharp boost in productivity for a few hours when I need to be highly focused.

I previously tried Mental Alertness from MM Supplements, but I didn’t notice any difference. B12 and coconut water give me a slight energy boost—perhaps because B12 supports energy production, while coconut water aids neural transmission, but they don’t feel strong enough.

MM also has a product called Energy Shifter, which is meant to help when quitting caffeine. Has anyone tried it?

I’m also considering some MM-recommended supplements:

1. L-Tyrosine – Supports neurotransmitters, memory, and dopamine production.
2. CoQ10 – Enhances cellular energy levels.
3. Rhodiola Rosea – Supports mental and physical endurance.

Would it be effective to take all three at once?

1jewnlz,https://www.reddit.com/r/EntrepreneurRideAlong/comments/1jewnlz/restarting_our_agencynot_from_scratch_but/,"Restarting Our Agency—Not From Scratch, But Definitely Smarter","Have you ever lost something that made you feel like your entire world just collapsed?

Three weeks ago, that was us—our agency’s biggest client vanished overnight, taking more than half our revenue with them. Honestly, we felt completely blindsided.

But here's the twist we didn't see coming: this devastating setback might actually have been the wake-up call we desperately needed. After countless hours of anxiety, doubt, and (let's be real) too much coffee, we realized we weren't truly starting from scratch. This time, we're armed with real-world experience, battle-tested lessons, and advice from seasoned entrepreneurs right here.

So, if you're facing tough times or just looking for fresh insights, here's exactly what we're doing differently, packaged into actionable takeaways:

1. Stop Letting Clients Control Your Fate

We were guilty of relying heavily on a single client because, frankly, it was comfortable. But comfort turned to crisis overnight. Now we've established a hard rule—no single client can exceed 15% of our total revenue. Period.

Value takeaway: Diversification isn't just smart, it's survival.

2. ""No"" is the New Secret Weapon

At first, saying yes felt like growth, but over time it turned into chaos. Now we're consciously turning down projects that aren't a perfect fit for our core strengths and future goals. It's scary, but clarity feels amazing.

Value takeaway: Protect your focus fiercely—saying ""no"" amplifies your ""yes.""

3. Pick a Lane and Own It

Ever felt invisible in your industry because you tried to do it all? Us too. We're now testing specific niches—tech startups, sustainable brands, and healthcare—to discover exactly where our unique expertise creates the highest impact. Early signs? Pretty exciting.

Value takeaway: Specialization is how you stand out, not by blending in.

4. If You Don’t Build Your Brand, Who Will?

This one stings to admit. For too long, we prioritized clients and completely neglected ourselves. Today, we're actively rebuilding our own identity—refreshing our website, consistently posting valuable insights, and joining meaningful conversations. This feels long overdue but incredibly rewarding.

Value takeaway: Building your brand is a daily investment, not an occasional chore.

5. Outreach Can Be Enjoyable (Really!)

Here's a confession: I despise cold emails—mostly because I dislike receiving them myself. So we've flipped outreach on its head, shifting from spammy cold pitches to genuine, hyper-personalized outreach that prioritizes giving upfront value. Surprisingly, it works well, and it doesn’t feel awkward.

Value takeaway: Humanize your outreach, and it won't feel forced.

Our Current Reality Check: Selling With Confidence

Going from behind-the-scenes execution to confidently pitching ourselves has been uncomfortable. But we're slowly finding our footing, one authentic conversation at a time.

I'd genuinely love to hear from you—especially if you've overcome similar entrepreneurial challenges:

What's the most powerful piece of advice you've received during a pivot or restart?

How did you break through your initial fears around selling and pitching?

And if any part of our story resonates, please reach out—connecting and sharing experiences is one of the best parts of entrepreneurship for me.

Thanks so much for reading and for your continued support. Can't wait to hear your thoughts and experiences!

They proudly flaunt a 16-month program that promises you don’t have to choose between an MBA and building a startup. Wow, how generous—except it’s basically a glorified boot camp that charges you an arm, a leg, and your firstborn for the privilege of “learning by doing.” You’re not getting an MBA; you’re getting a certificate they’ve dressed up in tech-bro buzzwords to sound edgy.

They brag about being “India’s first technology-focused business school,” which sounds impressive until you realize it’s just a fancy way of saying they’ve slapped some coding jargon onto a standard business curriculum and called it revolutionary. “Learn from 200+ CXOs & MDs”—sure, if by “learn” you mean sit through a few guest lectures from self-important execs who probably Zoom in for 20 minutes and peace out. And the “student-led ₹5 crore investment fund”? Please. It’s a sandbox for rich kids to play Shark Tank while the rest of you watch your tuition evaporate into their “hands-on learning.”

The website screams about live projects with companies like Microsoft, Uber, and Cars24—like, congrats, you’re unpaid interns with extra steps. You’re not “steering” anything; you’re fetching coffee and tweaking PowerPoints while they slap a “consultant” label on it to make you feel special. And the “Founder Fellowship” offering ₹40,000 a month to 25 “serious founders”? That’s cute—barely enough to cover rent in Gurugram while you’re drowning in their ₹40 lakh UG program fees. Scholarships? Oh, they’ve got 10 full ones—for a cohort of 250. Good luck fighting over those crumbs.

They tout an average CTC of ₹34.07 LPA for their 2023 PGP batch, with a top package of ₹57.08 LPA. Sounds amazing until you dig into the fine print: that’s probably skewed by a handful of outliers while the rest are stuck with “experience” and a pat on the back. “Top recruiters like BCG, McKinsey, Google”—yeah, maybe for the five students who were already overqualified coming in. The rest? Enjoy your “personalized career progression plan,” which is code for “figure it out yourself, we’ve got your money already.”

And the campus in “vibrant” DLF Cyberpark? It’s just a shiny office building surrounded by overpriced cafes and traffic jams—hardly the “dynamic business hub” they’re selling. The “industry immersion” and “study abroad” options at places like LSE or Wharton? Extra costs, vague promises, and a lot of hand-waving about “networking opportunities.” You’re not rubbing elbows with global elites; you’re just another tourist with a notebook.

Hey there

Allow me to introduce myself—I am a reserved yet passionate introvert, seeking to embark on a journey of meaningful connections and friendships. As I navigate this vast world, I have come to realize that life's true beauty lies in forging genuine bonds with like-minded individuals. Today, I take a leap of faith to reach out to this incredible community, in the hopes of finding some amazing female friends to share laughter, stories, and moments of deep understanding.

For me, the essence of friendship transcends the boundaries of small talk and shallow interactions. I yearn for connections that delve into the depths of our shared interests, dreams, and quirks. Though I may not be the loudest voice in a crowd, my heart carries the weight of empathy and compassion, making me a keen listener and a steadfast confidant. From the solace of a quiet coffee shop to the thrill of a thrilling book, I find solace in the simplicity of life's little wonders.

In a world that often glorifies extroversion, I firmly believe that introverts hold the power to nurture profound connections. There's something truly magical about the authenticity that arises when two introverted souls come together in understanding and harmony.

If you resonate with the idea of finding a friend who embraces the beauty of solitude and shares the joy of deep conversations, then I wholeheartedly invite you to join me on this journey. Let's explore the wonders of the universe through the lens of our unique perspectives and build a bond that defies the constraints of time and space.

Together, let's create a little corner of the world where introversion blooms and where friendship knows no boundaries. I eagerly await the opportunity to meet some incredible like-minded souls who can share in life's ups and downs, triumphs and tribulations, and everything in between.

Looking forward to connecting with you",1,1742389793.0,SFWr4rIndia,0,1.0,False

1jewjug,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1jewjug/reccendations_needed/,Reccendations needed!,"Hey yall! I have been doing my own independent research for a little while now, but I need your help. Here is the situation: 

My wife and I are expecting our first child at the end of April, and my wife’s birthday is the beginning of April. She loves her Keurig, but she has complained about it lately and briefly brought up wanting to replace it. She said she almost asked for a Nespresso machine for Christmas but changed her mind. I also know with the baby coming coffee will be more important to her than ever. I very discreetly asked why she wanted a nespresso and started researching those machines compared to some of the ones I see on this sub(phillips, Gaggia, delonghi, etc.). I am very confident that this will be a great gift for her, but I want to find the perfect one. So, here is what I’m looking for:


1. Quiet. I have seen reviews where some have seals on the bean grinder to make it quieter and preserve the beans. This is going to be supremely important as not to disturb the baby. 


2. Easy to clean. I imagine our lives are about to become hectic, so the fewer parts I have to clean the better. 


3. Ease of use. I know that ease of use is kind of the name of the game with these devices, but they all have differences. I am very fond of the detachable milk jugs because the machine will go right next to our fridge and all I’ll have to do is attach the jug and press go. 


4. Good at lattes. I know they’re all gonna be pretty close in this category, but it just needs to be said. My wife will be mostly drinking lattes. 


5. Budget. I am aiming to stay under $1200. I can stretch to $1500 if I absolutely have to. I am in the United States btw. 



Note: right now my front runners are the delonghi magnifica plus and the gaggia cadorna prestige. I was about to pull the trigger on the delonghi until I saw in the videos that it doesn’t have a seal on the bean hopper, making it pretty loud. 


Lastly, I know that some will recommend a separate grinder and coffee maker if the quiet is so important. But ease of use is supremely important. It cannot be overstated how important it will be to have coffee ready for my wife at all hours with the press of a button. Thank you all for reading this wall of text and for any advice!

1jewjod,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucksbaristas/comments/1jewjod/12_honey_packets_guy_in_a_grande_rant/,12 Honey Packets Guy (in a grande rant),"Hi dudes, 

I have a morning shift coming up and alas, that means I’m probably going to see our morning regular deemed “12 honey packets guy”

He always gets a venti blonde coffee, WITH TWELVE HONEY PACKETS. not honey BLEND. THE PACKETS! AND HE WANTS THEM STIRRED

And I stg, I heard of him from my coworkers but I was like “dang that’s crazy” — and then he came to me…..sigh

And I swear the first time I ran into him, I offered him the packets because who the fuck has time to individually cut 12 honey packets, put them in the cup, and MIX THE TWO BLONDE SHOTS HE ALSO GETS.

Well…APPARENTLY WE DO. My manager was like “oh no, you can do that”, I swear she’s cool most of the time but what the hell. Like and sometimes he comes in the middle of PEAK. 

WHICH MAKES MY ANXIETY WORSE BECAUSE WHY‼️ IT TAKES A GOOD FIVE MINUTES TO OPEN 12 INDIVIDUAL HONEY PACKETS ‼️THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE IN LINE‼️

And it’s not even like he TIPS. We have the sweetest regular who asks for steamed milk, syrup, AND espresso shots in his coffee. But he literally will tip whoever makes the drink and he’s so nice.

No guys. He doesn’t tip, he doesn’t even really say thank you. He has bad vibes! I hate him. I hate him specifically. You spoiled inconsiderate coffee man. 


But yah that’s it. I have other stories but like yah.

I'm never that enthused by Shopbop's sales. Right now, however, I think there are some decent deals. And if you sign in with your Amazon account, you get Prime delivery, etc.

**[MM6 Salomon Gore-tex Jacket](https://www.shopbop.com/mm6-salomon-jacket-maison-margiela/vp/v=1/1588333343.htm?noul=true&os=false&breadcrumb=Men%3ESale&folderID=19188&colorSin=2078226113&fm=other-shopbysize-chosen-brand-viewall&sizeCode=115) | ~~$1000~~ $600 | Size M | Category: Designer; Techwear**

* **The Deal:** Not exactly like the other deals below. That is, expensive as hell. But posting it in case there's an MM6 collector wandering through. A unique piece in that it's a Salomon collab, and a Gore-tex jacket with a techwear rendition of the signature Margiela pockets. I recently heard someone call MM6 Margiela's heritage line – where house codes still show up, less muddled by the creative director's current direction – as opposed to it being a throwaway diffusion line. As a fan of Margiela myself, something I'd collect if I could.
* **Buy if:** You're a Margiela fiend, or are looking for a Gore-tex jacket, have the disposable income, and want a nod from the fashion nerds.

**[Norse Projects Standard Merino Lambswool Sweater](https://www.shopbop.com/norse-standard-merino-lambswool-sweater/vp/v=1/1547617068.htm?os=false&breadcrumb=Men%3ESale&folderID=19188&colorSin=2024373024&fm=other-shopbysize-chosen-brand-viewall&sizeCode=115) | ~~$270~~ $99 | Size S, M, L | Category: High-Quality; 100% Wool** 

* **The Deal:** I have limited first-hand exposure to Norse Projects, but what I do own I'm impressed by. This is a 100% wool sweater for ~$100, from a brand that I've seen recommended time and time again. You could certainly do worse for the price. 
* **Buy if:** You're looking for a classic, versatile wool sweater, and are willing to hand-wash* (**it says ""machine wash"" on the product page, but if you hand wash as needed, you'll be sure to get the most value out of this*).

**[Carhartt WIP Olten Bomber Jacket](https://www.shopbop.com/olten-bomber-carhartt-wip/vp/v=1/1546742511.htm?os=false&breadcrumb=Men%3ESale&folderID=19188&colorSin=2061628139&fm=other-shopbysize-chosen-brand-viewall&sizeCode=117) | ~~$298~~ $179 | Size S, M, L, XL | Category: Classic Silhouettes, Workwear, Military, Synthetic** 

* **The Deal:** I'm...intrigued by this flight jacket. It's pretty standard in most respects: based on CWU-36/P and CWU-45/P flight jackets, nylon shell, ribbed cuffs and hem, bicep pocket, some big boi pockets you could fit aeronautical maps in. But it's the specific shade of green that gets me here. Not quite the shade you'd find from a poly/cotton or standard issue nomex version. And it seems to have a drop shoulder. At any rate, the synthetic fabrics would usually be a disqualifier for me, but that's the territory when it comes to many a flight jacket. The deal brings it into Alpha Industries pricing territory. This jacket is an interesting proposition. 
* **Buy if:** You have an affinity for Carhartt WIP (the streetwear-focused division owned by Edwin and Salomée Faeh) and crave the soft embrace of a flight jacket that's got more character than the MA-1 every guy wore in the 2010s. This thing will probably go strong for a long time. 

**[Officine Générale Tyler Jeans](https://www.shopbop.com/tyler-jap-piedye-org-denim/vp/v=1/1522001278.htm?os=false&breadcrumb=Men%3ESale&folderID=19188&colorSin=2098779420&fm=other-shopbysize-chosen-brand-viewall&sizeCode=110) | ~~$465~~ $126 | Size 31 | Category: High-quality, casual, denim**

* **The Deal:** I'm a shameless Officine Générale stan. And while I don't think I could pull them off myself, I love the coffee color of these jeans. Somewhere between straight and a little wide in fit, I would guess. Japanese cotton. I'd like to see how these would age over time. Mind the listed measurements.
* **Buy if:** ...you like these. Officine is really great, in my opinion. The price is right on these (though I did once get a pair of tropical wool trousers from them for $113). I would buy these but I've eaten far too many cookies over the past few months – gym for me, jeans for thee. 

**[Polo Ralph Lauren Bear Cotton Sweater](https://www.shopbop.com/cotton-novelty-bear-crewneck-sweater/vp/v=1/1574163147.htm?os=false&breadcrumb=Men%3ESale&folderID=19188&colorSin=2076743022&fm=other-shopbysize-chosen-brand-viewall) | ~~$398~~ $278 | Sizes S, M, L, XL, XXL | Category: Knits, American Classics**

* **The Deal:** Should you pay $278 for a plain ole cotton knit? Nope. Should you pay $278 for a cotton knit featuring the Polo bear in a field jacket, fabric-appliquéd patchwork jeans, and a glass-bead necklace (there are actual beads on this sweater) so you can wear it for a lifetime and look like an OG in thirty years? My dude...honestly? Yes, probably, if you can swing it. 
* **Buy if:** you're an admirer of a classic, and love this specific version (others will come along).",1,1742389600.0,dealpatrol,0,1.0,False

Well I look up and my eyes meet the eyes of this guy and I was 😍😍😍.
But something told me to be cautious with him .

Well after church I was sitting on the stairs because it was raining outside and I was contemplating how I was gonna get home .
It was raining outside and I walked to church so I was either gonna get an uber or jog it out as I was training for a race anyways .

So I’m sitting there pondering and he comes up to me and asks me if I wanted a ride home .

My dumbass said no thanks .

So I ran home in the rain feeling like an idiot the whole damn time .

Well couple of weeks go by I’m at the gym and I have that same funny feeling again .

I’m on the treadmill and I turn around and it’s him .

He looked kinda sad .
After I finished my workout I went to the floor section to stretch and he was there doing lunges or whatever and there was just this energy idk wtf .

He looked like he was about ready to cry but he looked at me and I managed to utter a couple of words to him and just said “good job “ with thumbs up 🤦🏼‍♀️.

He then said he remembered me from the church . 

Well we got to talking in between working out here and there but I can’t remember abiut what that part seems like a blackout .

I remember asking him if he wanted to go out for coffee after church next week and he said yeah .

I also remember saying some dumb stuff about running because I’m one of those running obsessed freaks .

He said he can’t run and I said some other additional dumb stuff to him but it was so dumb that my brain kinda blocked it out altogether.

Well next week came and he wasn’t there .
More weeks went by and I didn’t see him 🤷‍♀️.

Then unexpectedly I saw him again in another church I went to .

We talked but I wasn’t really interested seeing as how he stood me up .

He apologized and I forget what his excuse was and I forgave him .

After church I was planning on going to the trail for a walk and I asked him if he wanted to come with and he agreed .

But on the way there he changed his mind so I had to turn around and drive him back to his car but we exchanged phone numbers.

We’d text here and there but it wasn’t good .

I dismissed the idea of liking him altogether in a romantic sense but I decided that ok maybe we can be friends .

Except that didnt work .
We finally agreed to do something together that summer so we went to the woods for a run and a swim .

When we came back he went home and that was that for a while .

Well some time went by and he invited me to his place for Netflix and chill .

I agreed to come and we watched a movie and ended up fooling around a little but I remember feeling awkward the whole time because I was out of practice .

But I hung in there .

Afterwards I went home and he slapped me on the butt and I slapped him on the butt back 🤦🏼‍♀️.

Some additional time went by we texted but I freaking out from how awkward and uncomfortable the whole thing had been .

He said some weird shit abiut this not being a relationship and I agreed.

So that was that.

So fast forward to Feb of 2024.

Somehow we got to texting again and he showed interest.

On Valentine’s Day we went to the gym and other places together and went to dinner .

He gave me roses and I got him a coin that said “to thine self be true “ or something like that .

After dinner he dropped me off , he stopped in but didn’t stay for very long and he went home .

Left me feeling kinda … confused .

But 🤷‍♀️.

Some time went by I didn’t hear from him but I’d feel this pull to go see him but I didn’t.

One day I finally caved in and got two coffees and went to his house and gave him a coffee and a hug but couldn’t stay so I went home .


That same day I thought to myself wtf go and be with him so later that evening I drive back to his house but he was there with some girl .

I said ong im so sorry I’m such an idiot so I went home .

So I said “ok just friends “.

Well some tine went by and I forgot about him .

All of a sudden : about 2-3 weeks ago I’m napping and he pops up in my head and I felt like he was getting under my skin .

Next thing you know he’s in my head and we’re having whole conversations… in my head.

Few nights ago I dreamt that we were moving in together and I’m busy doing stuff but he’s there and I’m scared all the time that it’s gonna get messed up .

I wake up and I find myself cleaning my house taking out garbage and ready to move out .

These conversations continue and he’s asking me to go to his house and I do but he’s not there .

I’m always guessing abiut his whereabouts.

I take some pictures and send them to him via email .

Few days go by and he responds with :

“I’m in rehab “.

I could be taking a walk, reading a book, or having coffee with a friend - when suddenly I'm overcome with a sense of meaning and direction.

Recently I felt this while journaling. I had a flash of insight about how all my varied interests are tied together by a common thread - helping others find their voice. In that instant, my scattered pursuits felt unified under a central purpose. I was so struck by how this sense of clarity energized me.

Summery: the study was conducted in the confines of a working high end resturant and hotel complex. The study compared the work ethic of the breakfast shift to that of the evening shift. Both shifts are staffed with personal with a minimum of 3 years employment in the position working 75% (72 hours a month).
The test process is to regulate the individual duties and observe if they are able to not only complete the assigned tasks but to identify related problems as pertain to their shifts and satisfactorily resolve the problems.
Both shifts have received both written and verbal instructions as to what is expected of their shift.

Report
Day 1; house keeping has unexpectedly and against standing policy brought a table full of breakfast dishes to the resturant and abandoned the mess in the middle of the service area during evening service.(see photo 1). Standing policy is that breakfast or roomservice dishes are not to be bought up during evening service.
Table of dishes were returned to lower floor where it will be out of the way of evening service. (Photo 2).
Several hours later the housekeeping returned the table of breakfast dishes, parking it in the corridor where it will obstruct wait staff serving the guests. House keeping was issued 'a stern talking to' by the senior server.  The dishes were removed to the cellar. (Photo 3)

Day 2; the table has remained in the cellar for 24 hours.(photo 4) Rudimentary life forms are developing on the bread and coffee. The yogurt has more culture than the breakfast shift.

Day 3; the table mysteriously appeared half way out of rhe elevator, obstructing the doors and restricting access to all upper floors.(photo 5) rumour has it that the table may have navigated its own way up.

Days 4&5; weekend - no observations available.

Day 6; the cheese has formed a tribal culture and is using primitive tools. It appears that the cheese has declared war on the coffee. The Yoghurt has built a temple around the dead fly and is making offerings of bread crumbs
No photos available as the fruit plate is concerned that taking pictures will entrap their soul.

Day 7: the war seems to have ended. The cheese remains while the coffee is only a stain on the tablecloth. The Yogurt has petitioned the UN for membership and requested protection from the cheese which seems to be stockpiling bread sticks for a first strike attack against the fruit or yoghurt. The fruit has expanded their temple and now have a break-off sect that worships a live wasp that has been coming around. This has resulted in the melon chunks sacrificing strawberries.  Civil unrest is on the rise. The sociological implications of these rising cultures seem to be surpassing the importance our original study.

 Day 8; a very disturbing discovery today. The Cheddar attacked with weapons of mass destruction. Unbeknownst to us the cheese plate had been harvesting cultures from themselves, and milk from the borders of the coffee wars. In an all out attack the Cheddar bombarded the table with a potent Limburger cheese. 
All life has been wiped out. We weep at the loss of life, and for all the art and music that shall never be.

It's got to be from one of the many relatives (or whoever) he bounced around between, right? My thinking is that Sakura has a sort of deal with one or more of them - they'll give Sakura spending money in exchange for him shipping out of town and not bothering or contacting them.

Of course, whoever sends him money is only giving as little as they can because they obviously don't want to support him. Hence why he lives in a cheap, run-down apartment.

1jew7dy,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jew7dy/looking_for_advice_about_friendship_breakup/,Looking for advice about friendship breakup,"Three years ago one of my closest friends and I had a huge friendship breakup. We are now 26F so we were 23 years old then. We met in university at 18 years old and at that time we didn’t have boyfriends or many other friends so we all become pretty close and we had all the same classes so it was easy to get integrated into each other’s lives. There was another girl that went to our university who I knew from high school so sometimes us three would all do stuff together, but I definitely would say I was a lot closer with the first girl. 

I did not want our friendship to end when it did, but she essentially told me she did not think I was a good person and that she didn’t want to be friends with me anymore. There was a lot that led to the break up but I always thought we would make things work and that we would stay friends. Some things were that I got a new boyfriend and made a lot of new friends in the year leading up to our break up, we graduated university and I got a really good job, and she was struggling with being a new grad. I wasn’t making as much time for her compared to the years previous, and she didn’t like my new friends or boyfriend. 

This girl and the other girl that I had known from high school had grown a lot closer over the last year before our friendship ended, which I was really supportive and happy about. But, when my friendship ended with the main girl, the second girl completely disappeared and never talked to me again. I didn’t reach out to her either because I assumed that she had taken the main girl’s side since they had become a lot closer. 

I have done a LOT of self reflection on the friendship ending and I was very heart broken about it, and I definitely think there were things that I did wrong. I really grieved her and our friendship after it ended. I tried to move on and I did, but I would often find times where I had a heartache and I missed her. 

Side note: I do have one other really close friend (probably best friend) who really does not like her and never did, and my boyfriend doesn’t like her either. 

Anyways, a little less than a year ago I found myself wanting to reach out to her and apologize for how things ended and let her know that our friendship did mean a lot to me. I didn’t t expect anything in return because I didn’t know where she was at, but I mostly did it because I didn’t want our friendship to end on bad memories and it was important to me for her to know how much she meant to me at the time. 

She actually responded very well to me, apologized for her role in our friendship ending, asked me to meet up for coffee, and followed me back on socials. I was really happy and we did end up meeting up and it was really nice to chat and reconnect. 

After our meetup I was looking at her Instagram and I noticed in the time that we weren’t friends the other girl had been commenting on her pictures, etc, and it gave me a weird feeling inside, I wasn’t sure what to make of it. Just knowing I guess that that girl likely had taken her side and that I didn’t know what the conversations that went on between them was weird. 

Anyways, me and the main girl have lightly kept in touch since then and we’ve met up for coffee one more time. After the most recent coffee, the second girl reached out to me out of no where and said she hoped I had a good last few years and that we should catch up. I now feel weird again, I feel like I need some honesty and I haven’t talked to either of these girls since then. I’m not sure if I’m overreacting, and a part of me thinks I shouldn’t keep in touch with either of these girls and just focus on friendships with other girls instead. It’s just tough for me because I was really close with the first girl and I honestly miss that. The second girl I feel weird about because we just stopped talking and there was no conversation, explanation or honesty. 

I’m not sure what to do, if I should leave these girls behind and focus on new friendships, give them a chance, etc. what do you guys think?

TLDR; 3yrs ago had friendship breakup with one friend and lost another friend through it, reached out to first friend and have somewhat rekindled friendship, second girl is now reaching out, have a weird feeling don’t know what to do",1,1742388596.0,relationships,1,1.0,False

I had also recently discovered the issue of rinsing with heavy tap water after much confusion. I originally thought my issues with flat bottoms (tsubame kalita and ceramic april) were down to how much I'd heard they can clog, especially with Kalita filters (sadly I've already ordered a Booster 45 now). By contrast, my plastic V60 01 almost never stalled, which pushed me even further toward that theory. Turns out, because the plastic V60 requires almost no preheating, I would nearly always use \~20g coffee water to rinse, whereas the other drippers required more preheating, so I would use tap water to avoid wasting my coffee water. Since moving to preheating the drippers using the kettle vapour, and wetting with a small amount of coffee water, I have experienced no stalling. In the April's case, I have moved from a 2.4.5 (830 um) all the way down to 2.1.0 (650 um) and am still getting drawdowns under 2:00 using their recipe now. (Grinder is X-ultra)

“What’cha got there?” Trath’yra asked from her lazily lounged position, laying across the couch, watching while Tuli dug through a storage box he’d dragged out of their shared closet. The rain from the heavy monsoonal storm that had ruined their planned hike for this shel hammered on the metal roof over their heads as was occasionally interrupted by the gunfire like tapping of hail.

“Computer junk. Need to set up for the council meeting.” He said, head down as he sorted through neatly bundled cabling.

“Council…like the town council? Thought that wasn’t until the end of the month.”

“No. Werewolf.”

“Wait, that’s today?” she asked counting off months on her fingers before pausing, “And…I can sit in on it this time?”

He nodded silently answering both questions, pulling what was definitely a pre-contact laptop from the bottom of the box.

“Does that thing even work with wifi?... Or even the datanet?”

“Nope.” 

“Security through obscurity?”

“Mmmmhmmm.”

“So… run the council by me again? You explained it after the…whole thing with the witch-”

“She isn’t a witch.” He said, holding up a hand, “She’s a terribly powerful immortal hag that I should never have made a deal with.”

“No, the summer court is who you never should have dealt with.”

“Both?” Tuli suggested with an acquiescing shrug.

“Both.” she nodded, shaking her bangs out of her eyes.  “Also, what is the difference between her and a witch then, I thought a hag was a witch?”

“First, don’t take the lore for movies as being truth in fiction, and well, the main difference is that a witch is just a normal person that can tap into the magic of the world, while a hag generates its own magic, they don’t have to borrow ambient powers from around them to do their rituals and spellcasting.” He said, pulling a notepad out of a pocket to sketch out an illustration of the difference with stick figures and arrows implying with the figure that had a witch’s hat that a witch would draw on energy around them in order to power a spell before the energy returned to to the world around them balance the energy levels back out out. “A witch is like someone with a power tool in a sense, they can do a lot with it, but that energy has to come from somewhere and then it goes back to the world, there’s a cost and while some magic users get fairly creative with the way they pay those costs it all evens out more or less.”

“Creative how?” Trath’yra asked.

“Well, it used to be, before the witches really figured things out, that rituals and spells had to be stupidly complicated, maybe even involve burning a recently alive goat, that sort of thing. In modern times, well..There’s a Kahvilabaari near where I grew up. The owner is…was…I don’t know if she’s still around or not, but she was a witch and she kept the drinks chilled through magic by making the cost of that magic be the fire in the stove she used for baking.”

“That…ok that was a…word, I’m working on Finnish but what the hell was that? Coffee…something?”

“Coffee bar.”

“Kaahvil…baarhee?”

“Almost.”

She tried a few more times to pronounce the Finnish word to middling success before shaking her head with a shrug and returning to the topic they had been discussing.

“So…the cost of magic, that setup at the cafe…why not just use the word cafe?...anyway that sounds way too simple.” She said with a head tilt.

“It is but it isn’t, for a witch, wizard…warlock whatever flavor you want to call it, the cost of the spell needs to match up to what you are doing with it. If the cost doesn’t work the spell fails, or rebounds.”

“I see…and, so a hag?”

“They’re like someone that has powertools and a generator in a backpack,” he said, drawing another stick figure and drawing a group of arrows that circled around inside the figure instead. “They don’t play by the normal rules, which is why their spells can ignore limitations that a witch would normally be under. They still have their own limits, but they’re different and, for all intents and purposes, when compared to a mortal magic user, basically limitless.”

“Sounds like bullshit.”

“Some people have that opinion, some witches have spent their whole lives trying to bridge the gap they think they’re missing.” Tuli said with a shrug and stretched a little as he put the notepad back on the table before returning to digging through the storage box while Trath’yra mulled over what he had said for a while.

“And how did you…and I…do that then?” she asked after a bit.
“Little less complicated than a witch’s magic actually. There are… spots.” He said, motioning vaguely, “Where, if you know the right words, and have the right tools, anyone can catch the eye of something…well it’s like a curtain on a theater stage where it appears impenetrable, but if you know where to look you can see the gaps….I hope my explanation is…making sense…”

“I think I get it… but this is well,” she sighed as everything Tuli had explained was still hard to grasp onto for her, even after seeing some of it [with her own eyes](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/xsux21/eagle_springs_stories_truthseeker_chapter_0/). Shaking her head to clear it and process everything he had explained later, she eventually propped herself to watch as Tuli began prowling around the coffee table to string chords in order to properly set up the laptop and a much more modern looking webcam and condenser microphone. “So, back to the council…. This is like the werewolf HOA right?”

“A little bit.” He said with a wavy hand gesture indicating the explanation was on the right track, “unlike an HOA though they can’t really dictate anything to any of the constituent wolves, it’s more to settle disputes than anything else. With there being only five recognized packs and the rest of us being packless and so spread out, the Southwest council really doesn’t need to meet more than twice a year, and that’s usually just to plan for the Howl.”

“I sense a “but” here.”

“My report on what ended up happening to the Folly pack is on the agenda, and I have to tell them about Spoon and El’zi too.” He said, shrugging, “The report is already in their hands, they may want to confirm some things with me. I’m just… more concerned with the second part.”

“Why’s that? It’s not like you bit them.” She said, as she slipped off the couch and gave Tuli a reassuring hug now that he seemed to be done with the computer setup.

“I know, but…” he sighed, trailing off as he leaned back into the hug.

“I guess…there is the potential for that perception to exist…I hadn’t really given it much thought. Between being alone out here as part of that cultural exchange between the American and European packs, and stuck in limbo unable to get an ID or leave the governance district, they might think you’re making your own pack.”

He nodded silently.

“Well if that’s what they think I’ll punch them all.”

Tuli quietly snorted, “Please don’t start a fight on my behalf…I appreciate it though.”

“No promises… you’re mine, and if someone threatens you again I’m getting in their way.” She said, giving him a reassuring squeeze. 

“Mmmm…well the meeting starts in a half hour. Can we just cuddle like this till then?”

Trath’yra nodded and rested her chin atop his head before falling backwards onto the couch, dragging him with her as the minutes began to tick by both slowly, and far too quickly for her liking.

A chime came from the computer, dragging them both back into a seated position and Tuli slid in front of the laptop to open up the video call program. After a few moments of a spinning icon the screen flickered and split into seven box segments as other people rapidly began joining the call server.

“Good afternoon everyone,” the tin-can-sounding voice of a human male said, the speaker appearing to be a well weathered gentleman with white hair tired back in a ponytail said, “Tanner texted me, the landlines off in Winnemucca were cut by the monsoons so she can’t make it, I’m also seeing different faces than usual and a couple new faces, and so if everyone would please introduce yourselves today. I’ll go first, and then it’s first come first serve.” He said, waiting for nods of affirmation before continuing, “Hoja Greenleaf Salcido, Red Mesa pack alpha and greater Flagstaff area representative. Current council chairman.”

After a few moments of silence almost bordering on awkward, a fairly pale and dumpy looking blonde haired woman spoke up next, “Trisha Wheeler, Brass pack in Salt Lake City, Kaleb ate something that didn’t agree with his stomach so I’m taking over his duties as secretary tonight.” in the background a lanky looking blonde haired teenager rolled his eyes as he quietly protested, before pausing, and suddenly bolting out of the camera field of view as Trisha chuckled, “He’ll get it in his head someday that those dang avocados they’re liking to put on toast give him the trots.”

“Maybe, maybe. So no guac at the howl then?” A redheaded college aged woman asked.

“Oh no. Erin, bring as much as you want. I’m not making anyone else miss out just because Kaleb’s allergic to them.”

The redhead nodded before speaking up again, “Erin Pierce, my dad’s loafing around somewhere, but he’s pushing me to take over as alpha of the Soccoro pack this year so I guess I’m the note taker for the treasurer? And, this is Jamie Jr.” She said motioning to the wide eyed child sitting beside her. The toddler quietly seated beside her was only half paying attention to the screen, instead more focused on a Waldo book in his lap, “My little brother’s finally patient enough to sit still for these kinds of things.”

“Oh he’s cute as a button.” A brown haired, rail thin woman in a dark green sweatshirt said with a slight Minnesota accent, “Kaitlyn Baker, Bishop Pack.”

The dark skinned man seated beside Kaitlyn spoke up next, “Thomas Freeman, Bridgeport pack. I know both our packs are new to your council in the last year, but it can’t be said enough thank you for allowing us to join up with the southwestern packs instead of continuing to put up with that conclave nonsense they’ve got in California, I know it’s a bit of a trip to make it out your way but, most of us would prefer the drive over getting caught up in California’s stage show or the back and forth between the Reno and Vegas packs.”

Tuli leaned forward now that the packs leaders had taken their introductions  and tapped the computer to unmute the microphone, “Tulipalo Metsäläinen, Eagle springs area, no local pack affiliation.” After a moment he nudged Trath’yra, gently.

“Er…” she trailed off as the eyes of the other people on the video call focused on her, seemingly with more scrutiny now.

“You don’t have to introduce yourself if you don’t want to.” Tuli said softly.

“No…I..I’m part of this world now, I need to participate in it,” she whispered before sitting up straighter, “Trath’yra Dae’menor, Eagle Springs area, no local pack affiliation.” After a moment the pressure from the eyes on her shifted away and she relaxed, tuning out the next few introductions of several more packless and paired werewolves once Tuli had muted the microphone and the meeting progressed. The primary discussion of old business had, as predicted, centered on finalizing the plans for the howl, a large group gathering and camping trip centered around the next full moon. The location sounded nice being on the south rim of the grand canyon north of Flagstaff.

“And so if I’ve done the math right we’ll need a grand total of two hundred pounds of hamburger, one hundred of sausage links and fifty pounds of those port-o-geese sausages Milly likes.” Hoja said as he looked up from his scratchpad.

“It’s Portuguese,” Trisha said with a snort.

“That’s what I said. Port-o-geese, anyway, unless someone wants to pick apart my math that settles our old business. Erin, I’ll email you and your dad copies of the receipts after I hit up costco and you can reimburse me in October… Seeing no objections, moving on to new business. Everyone should have Tuli’s report on what happened with the Folly pack, raise a hand if it skipped you.” As he spoke amid the sound of ruffling papers as some of the pack alphas flipped through their stack of documents to sift through the report,  a couple hands went up among the packless werewolves, “Ah, my bad, Trisha, could you make sure that we have the correct contact info for the Strouses and…. Timm, then get that forwarded to them, thank you. Does anyone have any questions?”

“Yes actually.” A gruff voice sounded through Erin’s microphone as an aged gray haired human ambled his way into the video frame, “Wasn’t here for the introduction portion Eric Pierce. Erin’s dad. First off, Tuli.”

Trath’yra felt him tense up at the mention of his name, having otherwise been relaxed and lounging against her on the couch, “Yes sir?”

“Ok, two things. First, don’t call me sir, I’m not your alpha, you don’t answer to me. Second, thankyou for seeing things through and keeping us in the loop. Now, you sent in this report a few months ago after checking Lichtdren's Folly, but there were still some things outstanding, do you have any updates on your search of the wider territory of the pack?”

“Yes si-....” Tuli paused and started again, “Yes Mr. Pierce, I had soil samples from around the caldera sent to NMSU and everything came back biologically inert. Hydrophobic mineral soil with a heavy carbon content, something which generally is only seen after intense wildfires or orbital laser strikes. In searching out their wider known territory and places they liked to hang out I found no evidence any of the pack had not been in the copper mine when this event happened.”

“I see. And the Major’s omnipad?”

“I’ve only received an update on that this week. It’s circumstantial evidence at best, but I believe major D’leth knew about the Folly Pack for what they truly were. Judging by the dates and other information that was able to be pulled, a group in the Interior knows about werewolves, and knew about the Folly pack before I had found them or the scope of their territory.” He said, and for a few moments the video call was almost palpably icey.

“Well…shit.” Hoja was the first to break the silence, “I’ll start a dialogue with the Flagstaff and Phoenix covens and see if they’re willing to help out keeping us hidden and unspotted from the wider imperium. Their current beef started what… thirty years ago, so maybe things have calmed down enough they won’t be opposed to that. Also, we’ll need to pass this along to the neighboring councils. We’re all going to need to keep a lower profile and really get an accounting of our unknown packs and packless, the Folly pack was there for at least a hundred years and none of us had a damn clue. Tuli, is there anything else that needs to be added?”

He nodded and took a deep breath, “In the fallout of all this, two more new were…no. Shil’wolves, are now living in the Eagle springs area. Shil’vati by the names of Ai’ Syl’mere and El’zi S’umers.”

A clearly muttered comment from one of the other packless could be heard to the effect of “Stop biting the aliens.” The heckle ended up being met with an awkward silence as it seemed to have been clearly meant to be said much more quietly than it had come across the video-call as Hoja glared discerningly into his camera as though he had picked out who exactly had made the comment, before a cough from one of the pack leaders broke the ice that had formed.

“I see, Tuli. How did these two wind up infected?” Erin asked, watching the camera with a curious gaze.

Tuli nodded, releasing a breath he’d been holding before resuming his report, “In Ai’s case, she was attacked by an infected Shil’vati at Lichtdren’s Folly who was going feral. With El’zi… things aren’t as clear, but she was aboard the medical ship that Ai’ was taken to. At some point a bite occurred, and things escalated from there.”

“So there’s just, a spaceship full of feral shil’wolves in orbit?” Thomas asked with a disbelieving head tilt, “Not to cast doubt, but that seems really far-fetched that no one noticed this all go down.”

“Judging by what Ai and El’zi have told me, the ship was set to purposefully crash into the sun with all hands after most of the crew had already turned. I don’t know what was told to the rest of the fleet but in all the reports that I can get my hands on, the ship burned up.” He said firmly. “Ai and El’zi ended up being the only two to retain their minds enough to escape aboard a shuttle. Being the only werewolf in this part of the council territory I’ve taken up the responsibility of teaching them how to live as one of us, Ai has taken to life like a duck, but El’zi is scared of her own shadow.”

“I see.” Hoja said thoughtfully, “You’ve given us a lot to consider, Tuli, I’d like you to stay on a little longer after we wrap up. Got some questions that may be better in a more relaxed setting.”

Tuli nodded, as the meeting progressed and closed out now that all the official business had been conducted, and once everyeon’s goodbyes had been said the majority of the windows on the screen rapidly blinked off until Hoja was the only remaining window, “So…” He started, probingly.

“I respectfully decline.” Tuli said tersely, seemingly knowing exactly what the topic of discussion the council leader was intending to start was.

Hoja shook his head, holding up his hands placatingly, “Not what I wanted to ask this time. You have made your opinion well know to me on your thoughts on being a pack leader, this…is…”


He trailed off as Tuli tilted his head questioningly.

“It’s about the different traditions the American and European packs have. Do you think we should reveal ourselves to the Shil’vati?” Hoja asked quietly, sounding far less sure of himself than at any other time in the meeting, “The inquisition was, a long time ago for most humans, but it’s still in living memory for a lot of us.”

“That’s something you and the packs on this continent need to make a decision on on your own, I…don’t have any worthwhile advice.” Tuli said with a quiet sigh, “As necessary for survival as it was for the European packs to reveal themselves to the different church sects, unless something has changed back home I don’t think there’s been any consensus on revealing ourselves to the Imperium there, and the only reason I even made the leap of faith to trust the Captain was I’d already been found out by one of her soldiers.”

""I.. see."" Hoja said hesitantly, ""It's a big question that we do need to grapple with, and I'm worried that if we just sit back and debate, try to hide in the shadows pretty soon we won't have the choice in the matter anymore. Thankyou Tuli.""

I do enjoy some deserts here and there but nothing as sugary as cakes and pies, cinnamon buns made in my own kitchen.
I have been exercising everyday since then. Lost 15 lbs. My cravings have been controlled by natural sources of sugar only. Dates/jaggery in small amounts.
My partner has been very supportive throughout.
I’ll be not passing the diabetes to future generations. It’s a promise to myself. I’ll be braking the chain.

And last night, I took the Valerian before I went to bed.  I had walked six miles so I was thinking I'd sleep well.  I did--until 1 am.

I’m a newbie who started making coffee for my wife (even though I don’t drink coffee myself, I love preparing it for her) from Türkiye.

Last September, my wife and I decided to buy a coffee machine to make espresso at home. The deal is simple: I prepare, she drinks! :) I genuinely enjoy making coffee for my wife, and to make this experience even more special, we decided to get a manual espresso machine instead of an automatic one.

I’ve watched countless coffee-making videos (huge thanks to Tanner Colson! :)), and after much research, we finally decided on the Sage Bambino Plus. At first, we didn’t buy a grinder because we wanted to focus on understanding the espresso-making process as beginners.

Then, last week, I decided it was time to upgrade! Due to budget and availability constraints, I went with the Vosco KD-CG018 coffee grinder. I also bought whole coffee beans from Starbucks (not pre-ground), and tomorrow, I’ll be grinding my own coffee for the first time!

Even though this setup isn’t anything fancy, I’ll do my best to make a delicious cup of coffee for my wife. I’d love to hear your valuable insights!

-What should I focus on first?
-What are the key steps I shouldn’t overlook?
-Any tips on dialing in the grind size or improving extraction?

Thanks in advance for your advice!

Due to my 10000th rewatch, as the premiere of season 6 is approaching, I will make a list with imo comfort scenes (as much as comfort as they can be in a show like that)

* June and Emily sit by the river, in a rainy day (""it's gonna pour"" and Emily responds ""I like the rain""), attending the view and having a discussion about their whereabouts - starting to build a friendship
* Macarons in Putnam's house on Janine's birth day. Generally, Naomi's dinner/lunch parties, which if you notice, always include macarons.
* Emily saying her name out loud for the first time.
* Rita cooking.
* June and Moira in flashbacks, doing simple normal things eg being in a party, running and go for a coffee. 
* June getting the package from Moira and reading her note ""this is your package bitch! Praised be. XoXO""
* Something very strange: the scene where Luke is found by other fugitives and they take him to their bus, and they leave the abandoned village. For some reason, the scenery with the dark golden light, the snow and the small houses and the music theme of Gilead, gave me the chills and at the same time I felt that this small village would be such a relaxing place to stay BEFORE. 
* June watching Friends episode and work out in the murder house.
* Moira arriving to Canada and see the car plate, that is Canadian.
* Aunt Lydia ""there is nothing like soup in a rainy day"". If only she didn't torture Handmaid's... I like to imagine that they gathered all handmaid's in the red center, and gave them soup. 
* Serena gardening
* June in flash back, in a break from her work, looking outside the window the people. 
* Serena and June working at night in Fred's absence. Listening to music, drinking tea and writing/correcting official paperwork. Such a break from an endless brain dead boring life. Such a powerful moment when June takes the pen. 
* Serena asking for a glass of wine in the Canadian hotel bar and Tuelo discussion in general. Simple things, in normal life: smoke a cigarette, drink a glass of whine, relaxing in a coffee bar.
* Handmaid's being at the grocery store and start spreading their real names with each other
* June nursing Nicole at night, along with Nick's company. Two parents happy for their child. 
* June finally getting a break from the rapes in Lawrence house. Spying with Marthas, sneaking around the house and reading all those Handmaid's files, listening to mixtapes, etc
* Aunts ""working"" (I do not want to refer to ""assign women to their rapists"" as work, but I didn't know what else to call it) and sharing a glass of liquor as a ""reward"". For me it was a comfort scene because of the ""doing things in a community"". It wasn't exactly that, it was a close as it can be in a Gilead world. 
* June with Beth and the rest of the handmaid's organizing the children get-out-of-Gilead thing. For some reason I found it very comforting. 
* Emily visiting the doctor in Canada, and telling her she is fine, except her cholesterol or Emily trying glasses. 
* June watching with Janine , the fish in the fish tank in the grocery store
* Ending of season 3 - even though June is shot, I like the flashback in the Before times and the Into Dust playing in the background
* All scenes in the farm from season 4. God they seemed so happy and relaxed... all of them. I loved those scenes. 
* June visiting a super market in Canada. The simple act of shopping as a normal person. 
* June, Rita, Moira and Emily gathering together in their house
* Rita making bread
* Rita eating sushi and drinking a coke
* My personal favorite: June , beginning of s04e08, cutting her handmaid hair (because in Gilead cutting hair is not allowed) and Portishead playing in the background
* June walking like a boss to Fred's hearing, to give her testimony. Her hair, her make up, her dressing, her determination. Everything. 
* Doctor saying to Janine, that it is not her business that Janine wants an abortion, trashing the fundamentalists, and saying that by laws she is obligated to tell her that abortion can led to a bunch of anti-scientific horrifying result, but not by law, she also wants to tell her that this is a bunch of crap. 
* Ex Handmaids killing Fred. 
* Ex Handmaids eating breakfast at the dinner after killing Fred. So satisfying scene. ",7,1742386513.0,TheHandmaidsTale,2,0.9,False

$MSTR has tried to use all dubious schemes to raise investor money and  dump it in bitcoin, starting with ATM share offerings, convertible debt death spiral financing, preferred stock offerings, well, here is a list:

$800.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0.625% Convertible Senior Notes due 2030 (“0.625% 2030 Convertible Notes”);

 $2.000 billion aggregate principal amount of 0% 2030 Convertible Notes;

 $603.8 million aggregate principal amount of 0.875% Convertible Senior Notes due 2031 (“2031 Convertible Notes”)

 $800.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2032 (“2032 Convertible Notes”); 

$1.010 billion in aggregate principal amount of 0.625% Convertible Senior Notes due 2028 (“2028 Convertible Notes”); and 

$3.000 billion in aggregate principal amount of 0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2029 (“2029 Convertible Notes” and, together with the 0.625% 2030 Convertible Notes, the 0% 2030 Convertible Notes, the 2031 Convertible Notes, the 2032 Convertible Notes, and the 2028 Convertible Notes, the “Convertible Notes”).|

And now....drum roll...a perpetual preferred issue of shares paying 10% dividends available ""only for institutions, and select individuals"", ticker $STRF, which stands for ""strife"", a name fitting the current state of the $MSTR common stockholder community. The 10% dividends and the supposed exclusivity would make Bernie Madoff proud. Or would it?

Last night, I logged into my small Webull account to check on NVNI and QNRX, and what did I see in the IPO section? An offer to order $STRF using Webull. That is right - they are targeting small retail investors and not large institutions and ""special people"". So, following the money and management greed, what can one conclude? Here are the risk factors from the prospectus:

""Although the perpetual strife preferred stock will be senior to our class A common stock, class B common stock, and perpetual strike preferred stock, it will be junior to our existing and future indebtedness, structurally junior to the liabilities of our subsidiaries and subject to the rights and preferences of any other class or series of preferred stock then outstanding."" **TLDR: the seniority means nothing**

""We may not have sufficient funds to pay dividends in cash on the perpetual strife preferred stock, or we may choose not to pay dividends on the perpetual strife preferred stock. In addition, regulatory and contractual restrictions may prevent us from declaring or paying dividends."" **TLDR: we may or may not pay you, depending on whatever we might decide to do next**

""We may issue preferred stock in the future that ranks equally with the perpetual strife preferred stock with respect to dividends and liquidation rights, which may adversely affect the rights of preferred stockholders."" **TLDR: see #1 - seniority means nothing**

""There is currently no trading market for the perpetual strife preferred stock. If an active trading market does not develop for the perpetual strife preferred stock, then holders of the perpetual strife preferred stock may be unable to sell their perpetual strife preferred stock at desired times or prices, or at all."" **TLDR: boilerplate disclosure**

**""We have broad discretion in the use** of the net proceeds from this offering and may not use them effectively"" and ""We may use the net proceeds from this offering to purchase additional bitcoin, the price of which has been, and will likely continue to be, highly volatile."" **TLDR: we might continue to buy the top of bitcoin with your hard earned cash**

So what is the trade? This trade used to make 25% per week last year when $MSTR was trading over $400, so while it is more difficult to calibrate now, I think with the renewed and desperate dilution to the common shareholders, the only way for $MSTR is down and it will decouple from BTC more and more.

To see an example, you can support me on kofi at just $10/month tip/beer/coffee and see an example of this set up which was only available for the Elite tier in the past. Here is the link:

1jevjma,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jevjma,Steam damage to wood finish,"So my girlfriend and I picked up this hitch yesterday for a sweet $50. We had plans to utilize as a coffee bar type area. 
Day 1- I added some temporary spacer blocks under the top section to get an idea of how we want to move forward and to store our coffee makers for the time being. 

I placed the maker and assumed that 1 or 2 days/ pots would be fine and I could sort out a better ventilation plan. 

Well today- the first morning.. I walk out to this mess. At first thought it was condensation but it’s almost like a steam burn. 
I tried wiping with water. It clears up a bit then dries back to white. 
I also applied some coconut oil and it is sitting. 

Girlfriend is devastated because she actually loves the wood colour and doesn’t want the basic “white wash everything” 

Any more tips before I need to sand and try to match stain/ clear? 
Also looking for future tips to prevent this from happening so we can actually use this beast for coffee as intended. ",2,1742386406.0,woodworking,3,0.75,False
1jevifg,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClusterHeadaches/comments/1jevifg/my_cluster_headache_experience_frequency/,My Cluster Headache Experience – Frequency & Intensity Increased After Quitting Smoking,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share my experience with cluster headaches and see if anyone else has gone through something similar.

I’ve been dealing with very mild cluster headaches since my teenage years—maybe one every six months. They were barely noticeable and usually went away within an hour. But things changed about three years ago when I moved from a sunny country (8 months of sun per year) to a much colder, cloudier place where we’re lucky to get 2 months of decent sun.

After moving, my headaches started happening every couple of weeks instead of once every few months or sometimes years, and the intensity increased a bit. But the real shift happened when I quit smoking tobacco (2 years ago almost). That’s when my cluster headaches became significantly worse. They went from moderate to severe, starting weekly and now happening every other day.

Right now, I use sumatriptan injections (extremely effective), but I try to avoid them unless absolutely necessary because of the side effects when they kick in. The one thing that helps me with moderate attacks is a large coffee—it usually stops the attack within 5-10 minutes.

Has anyone else experienced a change in their cluster headaches after moving to a different climate or quitting smoking? I’d love to hear your thoughts or any advice on managing them better.",0,1742386293.0,ClusterHeadaches,1,0.5,False
