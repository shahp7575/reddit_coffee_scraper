1ou3wm8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1ou3wm8/a_lifelong_companion_for_my_rv/,A lifelong companion for my RV,"Three months ago, I purchased an RV and took it on several short trips whenever I had free time. The scenery along the way was beautiful, and the freedom and convenience of traveling in an RV felt great. But sometimes on the occasional rainy day when luck wasn't on my side, I found myself stuck inside the RV, bored out of my mind. To avoid this happening again, I decided to buy a small TV for the RV. At home, I enjoy falling asleep to entertaining shows at night.

After reviewing recommendations and reviews from other RV owners, I chose the KANKA 32-inch smart TV because it was incredibly affordable. I only need less than $100 to get it. Since I also needed to save some budget for a coffee machine, I promptly ordered this TV.

The 32-inch size is just right for the RV. While the build quality is average, the picture is clear and smooth. Watching movies with the doors closed delivers decent sound, and it automatically adjusts the volume. However, the experience watching music programs is mediocre. The overall sound quality is bright and thin. It also has limited built-in media resources, requiring third-party apps for streaming, which is a bit of a hassle. With only 1GB of RAM, smart features occasionally lag. But considering the price, I'm willing to overlook its shortcomings.",1,1762848686.0,BuyItForLife,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

Something that makes me feel peaceful, nostalgic, or even a little emotional  like I’m part of that world while it rains outside.
I like anything related to nature, travel, love, or even something deep and introspective. But honestly, I’m open to all kinds  as long as it fits that cozy, rainy day atmosphere.

It was large, maybe coffee-table book sized (slightly larger than a normal picture book).

Contained full-bleed, vividly painted color illustrations (looked like they were done from photo reference - realistic).

Hardcover: by the time I found it, the dust jacket was gone.

Most of the book was narrative (kids/siblings go on adventure), while the second section switched fonts/layout and was a pseudo-scientific appendix explaining concepts from the story: teleportation, monsters, higher dimensions, etc., with diagrams and labeled illustrations. I specifically remember a section explaining how the protagonists had been able to fly through a mountain.

Story elements I remember:

It followed a few kids (siblings or neighborhood friends) living in a modern (for the time) suburban setting.

Illustration #1: A boy running down a wet street, chasing a paper boat floating along the rainwater runoff. He’s smiling, wearing jeans and a bright primary-colored shirt, and holding a Superman figure out in front of him like it’s flying to rescue the boat.

Illustration #2: Later, the kids are in a library or laboratory that’s being smashed up by extradimensional creatures. The lighting is dramatic; the kids look frightened. The creature has very strange, hammer-like features, numerous eyes and unnatural joints.

Scene 3: The kids on a flying carpet (possibly the same scene as above, or right after).

Tone: starts out everyday suburban realism, then slips into a strange, interdimensional adventure.

Appendix section:

Different font and layout — more like a textbook or field guide.

Had pseudo-scientific text and images explaining how teleportation works, etc.

There were appendix illustrations similar to geometric “superstructures.”

Publication timeframe:

Definitely existed by the late 1970s. Could have been anywhere from ~1965–1979.

[<< Chapter 40](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditserials/comments/1oo6htg/i_got_a_rock_chapter_40/) | [From The Beginning](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditserials/comments/1e69lkm/i_got_a_rock_chapter_01/)

The waiting room was uncomfortably quiet save for the ticking of a clock that sat across from Isak and the low whirring of an enchanted fan overhead that kept the room cool. Dark wood walls and dark tile floors would have made for a gloomy building overall if not for the lights that had just a touch of warmth to them. The combination made for a regal air to emphasize some kind of importance. Between the clock and a display case filled with scholarly books that looked to be written by former students hung a large painting of imperial forces first landing on the island. 

Naval forces of many different species disembark from row boats with old style sailing ships still out at sea. The Great Speaker himself leads forces onto the at the time newly discovered fertile island chain that completely lacked people. Even from this distance Isak could see the tiny spot of violet that belonged to the Great Speaker’s hummingbird darting ahead with other flying familiars in tow. Focusing on the painting and all its details was a better option than overthinking why he might be here. 

Was he in trouble? Had he done something wrong in the ‘duel’?

…aside from putting someone in the hospital of course. 

“Do you like the painting?” The school minister’s secretary, a small green mantiswoman, had emerged from her office. 

“Oh, um, yes.” Isak had been a little too focused on distracting himself from his thoughts and didn’t notice her until she spoke. “The colors are really nice. Like how it starts with the blues of the ocean, then you get to the old blue Navy uniforms, and then there’s the emperor’s scales so it’s like a range of that one color. Then it’s sandy beaches until you get to all of the greens that do the same kind of gradient thing.”

“It seems you have an eye for art! Well there’s plenty of other paintings in this building that you’re welcome to view.” She said with a smile. “After your meeting of course.”

She stood aside and gestured for Isak to enter the door past her. 

“Of course.”  Isak stood and crossed the room to attend the meeting with Vidal following after him. 

The secretary’s eyes lingered on Vidal though she kept a polite smile. The connecting room acted as both her office and an antechamber for the minister’s office. She directed Isak to head on in and returned to her own desk. Isak’s hand froze as it connected with the doorknob. He inhaled, then entered. 

A much brighter room awaited Isak thanks to large windows overlooking the sea letting in mid day light. A large wooden desk was the centerpiece of the room adorned with a small personal library along the walls that weren’t holding shelves full of small enchanted devices that Isak only recognized a scant few of. The desk itself was covered in books and papers but mostly blocked by the large kamo standing in front of it. Having heard kamo described as ‘shark people’ somewhere in the past was blunt but the human had to admit the comparison was apt. 

As big as the man was, the features of his face still had that characteristic kamo ‘sharpness’ that matched their teeth. Teeth that he was displaying in a smile that might have unnerved Isak if he hadn’t been getting so used to sharp toothed people smiling at him lately. His blue uniform shirt with white floral print was not unlike what Isak wore, though the white shoulders marked him as one of the staff. 

He reached out a hand to yank Isak into a handshake. “Isak Elijah Moreno! So good to finally meet you. Please take a seat. How do you take your coffee?”

Isak had still been processing everything when the smell of coffee finally hit his nose. He blinked and found the comfortable leather chair that had been offered to him. “Um, just a little sugar.”

“Good lad.” The minister chuckled as he retrieved a coffee pot and ceramic mug from a table off to the side of his desk. On the opposite end sat a small pterosaur on a perch. “I am Afa Valu. Call me Afa.”

“Y-Yes sir Mister Afa, and thank you.” The human said as he accepted the cup of coffee.

“*Just* Afa.” He corrected. The large man poured himself some coffee as well before he took a seat at his own desk. Gray eyes wandered over to Vidal standing behind Isak as he spoke. “I’m no professor anymore except for a few odd guest lectures. Instead I’m just one of the people making sure things run well around here.”

“Right! Just Afa. Thank you for the coffee.” Isak took a sip. His eyes shot open and moistened. “*Oh*…”

Afa bellowed a laugh. “All island coffee is good coffee. But now you’ve had some of the *best* island coffee.” 

The human took another sip, braving the heat just to get another taste of the divine drink. He fought off every urge to gulp it down and the crime it would be to not savor it. “Thank you!”

“Enjoy it! It’s the least I could do for having to ask you here.”

It wasn’t a gut punch but it still felt like a gut tap. “R-right…why uh…am I here?”

“Why indeed Isak! I was hoping you could tell me that.” The kamo took a sip of the fine brew. His face betrayed no emotion. “We’re not even a quarter of the way through the school year and you’ve already had one group of students try to gang up on you, and then another student tried to duel you. So I’ll cut right to the heart of the matter, Isak. Are you facing species based discrimination?”

Isak stared at the kamo with a serious look creasing his face. He blinked once, twice, thrice, then finally remembered to speak. “...no?”

Afa exhaled a breath even he didn’t realize he had been holding. “Well that’s one down. And any discrimination based upon religious traditions?”

“It comes up less here than back home.”

“Fantastic news!” Afa regained his smile full of daggers for a moment before clearing his throat. “Though if you have any input on why you seem to be getting targeted by other students, I would like to hear your side of things, Isak.”

The human took another sip of coffee and sighed. Half the reasons were embarrassing, the other half were stupid but also embarrassing. But he wasn’t in much of a position to say nothing here. “Some uh…*wealthy* students seem to have a problem with me. Not all of them! Two of my friends are apparently wealthy!”

“Well look at you, Isak! Bridging *so* many differences already! Not to mention already forming an *exceptionally* diverse group of friends who will be an *official* warband once you finalize a name.”

“Wait we’re a what?”

“Oh, that’s just the default group type. You can change it to something else once you pick a name. The sooner the better!” Afa shuffled through some papers on his desk. “Now, as per the duel–”

“She couldn’t take no for an answer!” Isak pursed his lips immediately afterwards, then averted his eyes. “I rejected her duel because she was trying to duel me into dating her. I said no and she didn’t like that.” 

The kamo sat back in his chair and grunted. “That more or less matches what I had already heard. And to be clear you are fully authorized to reject any unwanted romantic advances just as much as you are authorized to engage in appropriate self-defense…do you believe *your* response was *appropriate* Isak?”

Afa’s eyes had locked onto Vidal, still in the same glass form as when the incident had happened. Isak cleared his throat. “W-well a huge raptor was leaping at me…Vidal was just defending me.”

“I determined that grievous bodily harm and or loss of life were likely without intervention. My actions were taken in accordance with Master Isak’s own knowledge, morality, and instructions. The enemy familiar was dispatched knowing that doing so would leave the enemy mage physically unharmed but no longer a threat. Grievous bodily harm or loss of life was avoided and quick dissipation of the enemy familiar ensured that no harm would come to the onlookers who had insufficient time to retreat to a safe distance away from the sudden combat.”

“Right what Vidal said!”

School Minister Afa stared at Vidal with his mouth open and eyes wide. The cup of coffee was brought up to his lips and he took a long drink. He set the cup down, looking between Vidal and Isak for several moments, then regained a smile. 

“Well…an appropriate *and* efficient response. As to set your expectations, Miss Lelei will be making a formal apology to you. Despite your familiar’s…*appropriate assessment* of the situation, I don’t believe she intended to kill you. She will of course face other correctional measures but I think all involved would prefer to avoid having to ship a first year off to a correctional facility just because she can’t handle rejection. Wouldn’t you agree?”

It had only been a day but already Isak wasn’t having to deal with any more overly ambitious ‘romantic suitors’ stalking him, so all of this was still turning out well. Even if the tradeoff was a growing sentiment of fear towards him. “Yeah.”

“Perfect! Then I believe we’re done here! I know we’ll be seeing great things from you both. And your friends!” 

“Actually…” There might be an opportunity here. A *grand* opportunity. “I don’t know if you’re the one to ask but maybe you could tell me about something my…*warband*, name pending, would really find useful.”

Afa raised a brow but kept his smile.

“In our achieving of great things!” Isak matched with his own grin. “We have so many varied experiences and talents to share with one another. Magic, combat, combat magic, cultural exchange. There's a lot on the agenda and we had been having to either pile into a dorm room or meet on the beach. But one of my friends told me there are club rooms available…”

“And you're interested in one of those rooms?”

“For official clu– *warband* duties.” The mainstream culture of the empire was still strange to Isak but perhaps he could use it to his advantage.

Even better, it was something he could do for his friends. A thanks for all they had done and all that they were. Something he could provide even despite his meager means.

“And these official duties would involve…?”

“Well there’s the stuff I mentioned earlier, and I help out some of my classmates studying for Wilderness Survival. So, tutoring and…uh…” What was that fancy term Isak had heard? “*Community Enrichment*.”

Isak was out of his element here but he still had to try. 

“So, really this is something for others then?” His grin didn't show any teeth but it managed to be more predatory than anything the human had seen thus far. “Not simply having your own club room or personal glory?”

“My room back home, in a house barely thrice the size of this room, is a crawl space attic I can't stand up in. It's in a tiny village so far out on the frontier that the empire had to put me on a steam crawler for a week before I could take a train to even start seeing big cities.” He hadn't even told his friends that much about his living situation. “I don't need much. But I do need to provide for my friends.”

“A good leader must be brave, lead by example, and provide for his people.” Afa stood from his seat, retrieved the pot of coffee, and topped off Isak's mug before doing the same for his own. “Again, good lad.”

Isak blinked, looked over to Vidal, then back to Afa. “How…many tests did I pass today?”

“Enough.” 

“And the sugar in coffee–”

“No one is perfect but you did only request a *little* before going on to request a club room.” He sipped from his steaming brew. “Which I shall see about making into a reality after you file the proper paperwork. My secretary will assist you with that. Now, I think I have kept you long enough.”

Isak stood and profusely thanked Afa before making his exit with Vidal. The kamo gave a final curious look at the rock man before he bid the human farewell.

The human waved to Afa’s secretary and approached her desk.

“So…I was told to ask you for some paperwork?””

It took them both a while to fill everything out but the human couldn’t help but be thankful to the secretary for her help. Busara, that was her name as he would come to find out. Even with her aid he saw from a nearby clock that he would risk running over the time he had told his friends to wait before mounting a rescue. 

And he had a strong feeling that if Zyn told them about that ‘order’, a few of them would convince the others to attempt it. He had that feeling because it’s exactly what he would do while trying to figure out how to not have Vidal hurt anyone.

“Thanks again for the help!” Isak said while stowing the papers in his book bag. “It’s fine to take these with me?” 

There was a knock at the secretary’s door which prompted her to stand and walk with Isak there as she spoke. “Let your friends look over it as well and figure out a name. Return it to me once you are done.” 

On the other side of the door was some another staff member looking as though she had just finished sprinting. The lizardlady took a deep breath to compose herself before speaking. “Please tell me Afa is in, there’s b– oh…hello Mister Isak.”

“Uh, hello…ma’am.” Isak had never seen this woman in his life…right? He wasn’t just still having trouble with identifying lizardfolk faces? No, of course not. Those scale patterns weren’t familiar at all. She was taller than Citlali but without her…’bottom heavy’ build. So who was she and how did she know Isak? “Sorry I was just leaving.” 

“Have a nice day Mister Isak!” The unknown lizardlady said as the human and his rock man passed her before she darted into the secretary’s office. She didn’t even steal any curious glances at Vidal like everyone else in the administration building had been doing. 

He was left in the waiting room once more with naught but the ticking of the clock and the low whir of the fan overhead. 

There was a distinct possibility that he was getting too famous around campus. 

If he could get his friends the club room then it might be worth it but…this was a new complication that could lead to other complications. The lad sighed and headed down the labyrinthine hallways that would take him to the exit stairwell. 

He waited until he was down a hall and out of ear shot to speak to Vidal.

“They kept looking at you, buddy.”

“Apologies, Master Isak.” The rock man said as he followed his human. “I lack the means for a more subtle appearance.”

“No no it’s not your fault. It actually helps keep some of the stares away from me…uh, sorry.” 

“If I can protect you from any manner of harm, both physical or mental, then I am fulfilling my duties.”

“Yeah but I just had a whole talk about being a good leader…which still seems like a joke.” Isak stopped to admire another painting in the hallway. This one was of one of the dormant volcanoes on the island chain, surrounded by lush forests and probably not metaphors and allegory. “But I can do jokes. I like jokes. Girls like jokes.”

“I have not observed that any of your friends find your leadership farcical nor worthy of laughter.”

“Leadership…” Isak scoffed. “I’m just trying to be a good friend.”

“You are doing enough, Master Isak.”

“I should be doing more.”

“Feeling that way is proof of being a good friend.”

The human’s eyes drifted up and up to the rock man’s face. His eye sockets remained empty aside from some clear glass like tiny little windows into whatever was in there.

A soul?

Isak's soul at least. A piece of it to be exact. Put there by the familiar bonding ritual, now steadily growing into something bigger. And according to Manoka, no other soul was in there. Still, moments like this had the young mage wonder if there was something else going on within those rocks.

“Thank you for the input, Vidal.” He nodded to his familiar and finally returned to making an egress towards the nearest stairwell. “Don’t think I’m forgetting about you, either. Plenty of mysteries around you to solve. I left that out as one of the…*’warband’* activities but we’re working on it. Same for new forms.”

“A wider range of abilities with which to protect you is appreciated.” The rock man said as he followed after his mage.

While many brands offer 'Arabica,' very few commit to the **AAA Grade**, the pinnacle of coffee bean quality, which indicates superior size, minimal defects, and maximum flavor potential.

This crucial distinction is what separates a decent cup from a truly great one. In a crowded Indian market still dominated by chicory blends and lower-grade Robusta, the commitment to purity is a radical act.

[**KettleBerry**](https://www.kettleberry.in/) is leading this quality movement by exclusively using **100% AAA Grade Arabica beans**. This is the foundation of their superior taste—a rich, full-bodied profile that is inherently smooth and non-bitter. When you choose AAA Grade, you are selecting the highest tier of aromatic complexity and balanced acidity.

Furthermore, KettleBerry’s dedication to a clean label reinforces their position as the best choice for the discerning, health-aware consumer: their instant coffee contains **NO ADDITIVES** and **NO ADDED SUGAR**. It is simply a pure coffee powder, giving you total control over what you drink.

Elevate your coffee ritual and shop the AAA Grade standard today at the official[ **KettleBerry Shop**](https://www.kettleberry.in/shop).

I had my share of awkward dates, bad luck, and just times when the vibe wasn’t there. 

Sooo here I am, giving it another shot - hoping luck’s on my side this time! I just want to date seriously for long term 🥺

About me:
- 30 years old
- Biological female 
- 5’2” on a good day
- Straight 
- Christian
- Single. Never been engaged nor married. 
- No human kids 
- Curvy in all the right places, plus size
- Easy on the eyes
- No tattoos 

I’m a healthcare professional (fancy way of saying I help keep people alive and functioning 🩺). During my days off, I’m probably sipping coffee or matcha at a cozy café, pretending to “study” but actually people-watching… or getting lost in a book I picked up from a bookstore.

I love wearing dresses, strolling through bookstores like it’s a sacred ritual, and going around the city with my earphones in, imagining I’m in the opening scene of a movie chzz haha. I also enjoy for fog-covered mountains, road trips with no real destination, and city lights that feel like they’re winking back at you. Oh, and dogs? Absolutely! 💯 

Currently, I’m on a mission to shed some pounds —starting with daily brisk w@lks during sunset, which has been refreshing but feels like I’m being chased by regrets (or carbs 😂). I’m considering joining a gym soon, but I believe in taking it one step at a time. I hear having a cute fitness buddy boosts motivation... so, you in? 😉 

I’m also a bit of an introvert. I recharge in quiet, meaningful spaces. But if the vibe is right, you’ll see my fun and talkative side 😂

What I’m looking for… A **SINGLE** guy who’s an equally accomplished professional, intelligent, economically secure, respectful, and can start a conversation that goes beyond “hi” and “hello”. Also, **26-37 years old** , someone warm, caring, nice, grounded, endless thoughtful, and just as pleasing to the eyes as the scenery I adore. 

Bonus if you are:
- well dressed: clean, stylish, and just the right amount of classy 👌🏻
- Single. Not in a romantic relationship whatsoever. Never been married. (Best if you can provide a **CENOMAR** when we meet 😂)
- No human kids 
- Christian (genuinely God-fearing)
- Love and/or have dogs
- Enjoy spontaneous long drives
- Can appreciate the charm of bookstores and late-night cafés
- From **Cebu City  or Mandaue City** (easier for coffee dates and spontaneous drives). 

If this sounds like you…
Send me a message and tell me more about yourself such as what do you look like, important aspects in your background, current work, and/or your long-term goals, AND your go-to coffee order too!

Thank you for taking time to read until this point. Kindly include the word cheesecake when you message me so I would know!

Will ignore messages na not following simple instructions! 🙅🏻‍♀️ Puhlease, may effort naman post ko, hope you’ll reciprocate ha 😇

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

It’s a pale mint green on the outside with a white interior and rim, very simple and modern. The saucer matches the cup color exactly. No visible markings on the bottom that I could see.

Photo attached.
Anyone recognize the brand or pattern? It might be hotel-grade porcelain or something from a restaurant supply line (possibly NotNeutral, Steelite, or Heath Ceramics, but I can’t confirm).

Read a few years ago so here’s what I can remember, a mom & her son (young) are either at a mall or Saturday market type thing (I think a mall because I remember something about a parking garage). Son leaves with someone because they bought him a swirly lollipop (I think the shop owner brings this up during police investigation). Eventually the mom joins a support group of other parents of kids who have gone missing. I think one parent finds their kid but I can’t remember too much about that. 

The husband of the lady (main lady) ends up cheating with someone young, believe they meet in a coffee shop (I think this takes place in WA??). She figures out who he is because they have lots of money and they had made “ads” essentially to help find their kid so she’s seen those. I also know she (mistress) doesn’t have a lot of money and I actually think she may know who the kidnapper is.

In the end, turns out the male friend (of the main lady) was the one who stole their kid. I think the scene is like police at the man’s house, he may live with his mom? And I think he owns a bar! (I’m pretty sure it’s not *All Her Fault* - this show however is what reminded me of the book but this is very different from what I read.

I had my share of awkward dates, bad luck, and just times when the vibe wasn’t there. 

Sooo here I am, giving it another shot - hoping luck’s on my side this time! I just want to date seriously for long term 🥺

About me:
- 30 years old
- Biological female 
- 5’2” on a good day
- Straight 
- Christian
- Single. Never been engaged nor married. 
- No human kids 
- Curvy in all the right places, plus size
- Easy on the eyes
- No tattoos 

I’m a healthcare professional (fancy way of saying I help keep people alive and functioning 🩺). During my days off, I’m probably sipping coffee or matcha at a cozy café, pretending to “study” but actually people-watching… or getting lost in a book I picked up from a bookstore.

I love wearing dresses, strolling through bookstores like it’s a sacred ritual, and going around the city with my earphones in, imagining I’m in the opening scene of a movie chzz haha. I also enjoy for fog-covered mountains, road trips with no real destination, and city lights that feel like they’re winking back at you. Oh, and dogs? Absolutely! 💯 

Currently, I’m on a mission to shed some pounds —starting with daily brisk w@lks during sunset, which has been refreshing but feels like I’m being chased by regrets (or carbs 😂). I’m considering joining a gym soon, but I believe in taking it one step at a time. I hear having a cute fitness buddy boosts motivation... so, you in? 😉 

I’m also a bit of an introvert. I recharge in quiet, meaningful spaces. But if the vibe is right, you’ll see my fun and talkative side 😂

What I’m looking for… A **SINGLE** guy who’s an equally accomplished professional, intelligent, economically secure, respectful, and can start a conversation that goes beyond “hi” and “hello”. Also, **26-37 years old** , someone warm, caring, nice, grounded, endless thoughtful, and just as pleasing to the eyes as the scenery I adore. 

Bonus if you are:
- well dressed: clean, stylish, and just the right amount of classy 👌🏻
- Single. Not in a romantic relationship whatsoever. Never been married. (Best if you can provide a **CENOMAR** when we meet 😂)
- No human kids 
- Christian (genuinely God-fearing)
- Love and/or have dogs
- Enjoy spontaneous long drives
- Can appreciate the charm of bookstores and late-night cafés
- From **Cebu City  or Mandaue City** (easier for coffee dates and spontaneous drives). 

If this sounds like you…
Send me a message and tell me more about yourself such as what do you look like, important aspects in your background, current work, and/or your long-term goals, AND your go-to coffee order too!

Thank you for taking time to read until this point. Kindly include the word cheesecake when you message me so I would know!

Will ignore messages na not following simple instructions! 🙅🏻‍♀️ Puhlease, may effort naman post ko, hope you’ll reciprocate ha 😇

1ou3bxx,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/1ou3bxx/weird_neighbour/,Weird neighbour,"Hi everyone!



My wife, our 1.5-year-old dachshund and I moved to a new apartment two months ago. It's near Frankfurt am Main and is a relatively new building (built in 2003). The construction offers some nice features, such as underground parking spaces, a washroom downstairs, a large basement and underfloor heating in all apartments, so quite modern.

I work from home from 9am to 5pm, and then I go to German school from 5:30pm to 9pm. Then I come home, have a shower and go to sleep. I have been doing this for at least the past two months, Monday to Friday.

I walk the dog twice a day for 45 minutes each time, and my wife walks the dog for about 30 minutes before I return from school. We don't really play with the dog in the apartment.

My wife works in a coffee shop making pastries, so she wakes up at 6am to be at work by 7am, Monday to Saturday, untul 3:30pm.



I wanted to describe the situation to provide some context.

**Now, the neighbour** ***upstairs*** **complains that she can hear us walking around the apartment after 10 pm, and that we make noise.**

This sounds a bit strange to me, so my wife and I asked the neighbours next door and below us. None of them have complained about anything like this.

However, we still wanted to be cautious. We decided to pay more attention to how and when we walk around our apartment to see if she could be right.

She was quiet for 2–3 weeks, but then last night she met us in the hallway, smiling, and told us again that she could hear us. She seemed very calm and relaxed.



I am not going to ask whether walking in your apartment is normal or not before or after 10pm (considering a normal situation, not being an asshole). But the situation is a bit stressful. 

Now, let me give you a plot twist. 

Yes, I can hear someone (either her or the neighbour — I don't want to jump to conclusions) closing doors a bit more forcefully. I can also hear them walking around or doing things in the apartment. It doesn't disturb me; it's not very loud, and I also understand that I live in an apartment building, not a house.

But *twice* I heard her hitting with her fist the wall and scream at the neighbour through the wall, 'Hello!' (probably because the neighbour had the TV loud; she mentioned one day that the neighbour sometimes does this, because she's a 90-year-old lady and doesn't hear well). It was so loud that it woke me, my wife and my dog up at midnight.



I generally find Germans very nice and friendly, and they have good boundaries. One person won't change my perception, but she will reinforce it by showing that she's an exception that proves the rule: Germans are nice people.

***But how can I formally manage this situation?*** I asked my landlord and he said he had never received any complaints from the upstairs neighbour (he lived in this apartment for 10 years and rented it out to an old lady for three years before us).",0,1762846493.0,germany,2,0.33,False

Lately I’ve had a tough realisation. My closest friendship has become really one sided. I’ve been the one putting in the effort, checking in, showing up… and it’s draining when it starts to feel like that effort doesn’t matter. It’s made me step back and think about the kind of friendships I actually want in my life, the ones that feel mutual, supportive, and real.

I’m married, and my wife’s amazing! She’s my person and we have a great relationship. But I’ve learned that even with that, sometimes you just need a friend’s perspective. Someone you can talk to honestly, who gets it, and who brings their own kind of energy and insight into your life.

Most of my guy friends are good people, but our friendships tend to revolve around doing things rather than really talking. I’ve always found that friendships with women often have more emotional depth and openness. That ability to connect on a real level, and that’s something I genuinely miss.

Just to be super clear, I’m not looking for anything romantic. I just value genuine, platonic friendship. One where both people care, listen, laugh, and can be real without it feeling like effort.

A bit about me: I’m loyal to a fault, thoughtful, and very much a quality over quantity kind of person. Once I feel comfortable, I’ve got a solid sense of humour and love conversations that go deeper than small talk, whether it’s over coffee, gaming, food, or just chatting about life.

If you’re also someone who values honesty, emotional connection, and friendship that actually means something, I’d really love to hear from you. ",1,1762846395.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False

At the time, Olivia would have been 16 and Joshua would have been 19 (although, this could have secretly started a bit before/she could have been 15 since she celebrated her 16th birthday on set). They supposedly broke up when she was 17 and he was 20. That same year - 2020 - Joshua was accused of sexual assault by two girls via one Twitter account that’s now been deactivated. He pretty quickly revealed he’d supposedly been sexually abused by a family member during childhood and later by an older man during his teen years, claiming he’d ’only just recalled’. I’m not saying the allegations against him were true and I don’t want to dismiss his story since it could absolutely be true but sometimes his timing felt specific; he was being bullied by Olivia/Sabrina stans? He went into hospital. He was accused of assault? He’d also been assaulted. He revealed he was queer when it didn’t seem like his career was going to recover after what Olivia did, gaining some support for his bravery and now it seems to have somewhat worked, he’s deeply religious/took down his pride posts. Sometimes we talk on this sub about Olivia’s creepy relationships with older guys and fail to pinpoint this is where it might have started. I also think Olivia was the main villain/mastermind of the whole love triangle and definitely benefited the most but maybe she and Josh were both kinda narcissistic artsy types together who slowly realised they were dating characters/someone pretending to be someone else? His Doppelgänger music video of their time together seemed kinda obnoxious. I understand idyllic love but the events in the mv made me actually laugh out loud because real love isn’t just playing guitar in a field and going to little coffee shops and dancing in the kitchen and drinking champagne in the bath they were sharing together. It made me question how serious the relationship was or maybe highlighted that we really blasted someone for going through a breakup while they were college age. Like, looking back, this relationship was not serious at all 😂 Even the contents of her songs are just talking about ringing him on the phone, driving around to listen to music, writing songs about each other and her writing a whole section about how romantic it was he gave a homeless man his mittens 😂 It literally sounds like they’re 11. But him depicting them sharing a bath and drinking together in his music video heavily implies he was having sex with/supplying alcohol to a minor…so…It’s really icky",4,1762846296.0,OliviaRodrigoSnark_,1,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

I’ve always found winter to be the best time to travel across India — the air feels cleaner, the crowds thin out in some places, and every region shows a different kind of charm. This year, I started revisiting a few old favorites and discovered some new gems too.

* Gulmarg, Kashmir: Picture-perfect snow and the most peaceful mornings.
* Auli, Uttarakhand: Feels like India’s version of a ski postcard.
* Rann of Kutch, Gujarat: Cold nights, starry skies, and surreal white salt plains.
* Jaipur, Rajasthan: Warm days, cool nights, and perfect for exploring without melting in the heat.
* Coorg, Karnataka: Misty hills and that smell of fresh coffee — unbeatable in December.

# Aroma And Scent

Aroma and scent play a vital role in defining a good coffee. The smell of freshly brewed coffee offers the first impression before tasting. It reveals the coffee’s quality, origin, and roasting style. A rich and inviting aroma signals a delightful cup ahead. This sensory experience connects drinkers to the coffee’s unique story. Understanding common aroma profiles helps in appreciating each coffee’s character.

# Origin And Roast Notes

Different coffee origins produce distinct aromas. Beans from Africa often have bright, fruity smells. South American coffees may carry nutty or sweet scents. The roast level also shapes aroma. Light roasts tend to keep floral and fruity notes. Dark roasts bring smoky and bold scents. Together, origin and roast create a complex bouquet. This aroma profile hints at the flavors in your cup.

# Fruity And Floral Scents

Many good coffees give off fruity or floral aromas. Citrus, berry, or stone fruit scents are common. These aromas add brightness and freshness. Floral notes, like jasmine or rose, offer a delicate touch. Such scents often come from lightly roasted beans. They signal a lively and vibrant coffee. Fruity and floral aromas enhance the drinking experience.

# Nutty And Chocolatey Hints

Nutty and chocolatey aromas are popular in many coffees. Almond, hazelnut, or walnut scents create warmth. Chocolate notes range from milk to dark chocolate. These aromas usually appear in medium to dark roasts. They add richness and smoothness to the coffee. Nutty and chocolatey hints bring comfort and depth to each sip.

# Flavor Balance

Flavor balance is a key trait of a good coffee. It means no single taste overwhelms the others. Instead, sweetness, acidity, and bitterness work together smoothly. This balance makes coffee enjoyable and easy to drink. It also highlights the unique character of the beans.

Good flavor balance creates a pleasant experience sip after sip. It shows the skill of the roaster and the quality of the coffee beans. Now, let’s explore the main elements that contribute to this balance.

# Sweetness Levels

Sweetness in coffee comes from natural sugars in the beans. A good coffee has a gentle sweetness that feels smooth and soft. It can remind you of honey, caramel, or fruit. This sweetness balances the sharpness and bitterness. Too little sweetness makes coffee taste flat. Too much can make it seem syrupy or artificial.

# Acidity And Brightness

Acidity gives coffee a lively, fresh taste. It adds brightness and can bring out fruity or citrus notes. Good acidity is clean and crisp, not sour or harsh. It helps coffee feel light and vibrant. Low acidity makes coffee taste dull or heavy. Balanced acidity is important to keep the flavor interesting.

# Bitterness Control

Bitterness is natural in coffee but must be controlled. Good coffee has a mild bitterness that adds depth without being overpowering. It often hints at chocolate or nuts. Too much bitterness can ruin the taste and cause bitterness to linger unpleasantly. Proper roasting and brewing reduce excess bitterness. This control creates a smooth and satisfying finish.

# Body And Texture

The body and texture of coffee define the physical experience of drinking it. These traits shape how the coffee feels on your tongue and how it coats your mouth. A good coffee has a balanced body that matches its flavor profile. The texture should enhance enjoyment without overwhelming the senses. Understanding these details helps you appreciate every sip.

# Viscosity And Mouthfeel

Viscosity refers to how thick or thin the coffee feels. A medium to full viscosity gives a satisfying weight in the mouth. The coffee should feel smooth, not watery or too heavy. Mouthfeel is the overall sensation of texture, such as creaminess or silkiness. Good coffee delivers a pleasant mouthfeel that invites you to take another sip.

# Richness Without Oiliness

Richness means the coffee has depth and complexity in its texture. It should feel full and rounded but never oily or greasy. Oiliness can leave an unpleasant film on the palate. A quality coffee balances richness with cleanliness, keeping the texture enjoyable and fresh. This balance highlights the coffee’s natural flavors.

Lately I’ve had a tough realisation. My closest friendship has become really one sided. I’ve been the one putting in the effort, checking in, showing up… and it’s draining when it starts to feel like that effort doesn’t matter. It’s made me step back and think about the kind of friendships I actually want in my life, the ones that feel mutual, supportive, and real.

I’m married, and my wife’s amazing! She’s my person and we have a great relationship. But I’ve learned that even with that, sometimes you just need a friend’s perspective. Someone you can talk to honestly, who gets it, and who brings their own kind of energy and insight into your life.

Most of my guy friends are good people, but our friendships tend to revolve around doing things rather than really talking. I’ve always found that friendships with women often have more emotional depth and openness. That ability to connect on a real level, and that’s something I genuinely miss.

Just to be super clear, I’m not looking for anything romantic. I just value genuine, platonic friendship. One where both people care, listen, laugh, and can be real without it feeling like effort.

A bit about me: I’m loyal to a fault, thoughtful, and very much a quality over quantity kind of person. Once I feel comfortable, I’ve got a solid sense of humour and love conversations that go deeper than small talk, whether it’s over coffee, gaming, food, or just chatting about life.

I'm from the south east suburbs of Melbourne in Australia, so even better if you are localish and we could actually hang out!

If you’re also someone who values honesty, emotional connection, and friendship that actually means something, I’d really love to hear from you. ",1,1762845150.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,2,1.0,False

A few years ago, I didn’t think I’d ever recover.  
There were days I’d stare at the ceiling wondering how I got *so lost* — disconnected, tired, and constantly feeling like I was a little too much and not enough at the same time.  

Turns out, I wasn’t broken.  
I was unsupported.

When the right people, structure, and mindset finally entered my life, everything shifted — not overnight, but noticeably. That’s when I learned that healing isn’t about “fixing” yourself… it’s about *building the environment where you can thrive.*

Here’s what I discovered along the way 👇  

---

### 💡 1. Isolation Lies
You tell yourself you’ll figure it out *alone*.  
But solitude becomes a trap disguised as strength.  
When I accepted help — therapy, friendship, community — the darkness started thinning.

### 💡 2. The Right Support System is a Cheat Code
People who remind you of your value are *oxygen*.  
Systems that remove friction are not luxuries; they’re essential.  
Stop trying to climb barefoot. You need boots, a rope, and the right crew.

### 💡 3. You’re Not Lazy — You’re Tired of Pushing Uphill
Without support, motivation becomes exhaustion.  
With it, goals feel lighter, and progress… actually sticks.  
Your effort isn’t wasted, it’s just been working without gears.

---

That realization inspired me to write something that doesn’t sugarcoat the process.  
It shows how to rebuild your confidence, energy, and mindset — from the inside out, with structure that *lasts*.

👉 Check out my free guide:  
**[You’re Not Broken — You Just Need the Right Support System (Ebook)](https://trendwave-usa.kit.com/3d4461955f)**

- Rebuild practical daily rituals that foster resilience  
- Identify toxic self-stories and rewire them  
- Create a community that fuels your growth, not drains it  

If you’ve ever felt like a piece of you went missing, you’re not alone.  
You don’t need to start over — you just need the *right surround sound* for the life you actually want to live.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1ou2xjs,https://www.reddit.com/r/roommateproblems/comments/1ou2xjs/advice_for_the_feta_fiasco/,advice for the feta fiasco,"I (20F) share my college apartment with two roommates (both 20F). All three of us are friends, but also students with busy schedules that don't align. Each of us does our own grocery shopping as needed, but typically shares items in a type of unspoken system that has worked for the past 3 months. These usually include what are assumed to be basic things, such as bread, butter, cheese, milk, eggs, coffee, snacks, etc., that one person wouldn't consume the whole thing or buy as a specialty or single-serve.

Since we all have pretty packed schedules during the week, we also all do meal prep. Two days ago, I bought ingredients to meal prep: squash, bell peppers, and feta cheese to go with what I had leftover from weeks before. Last night, I cooked my food per usual and thought nothing of it.

I was sitting in the living room when one of my roommates came home around 10pm and opened the fridge to meal prep. 

""Hey, I just want to say that I bought some feta for my meal prep and I need the whole container, but it's gone. I really wanted to address this issue up front.""

Of course, I immediately apologized and was ready to take the blame, although I was a bit confused since I knew I bought feta myself. When I asked to see the fridge, a realization struck.

My grave mistake? I panicked at the Trader Joe's when it was crowded and bought a different type of feta than usual. I bought the Mediterranean herb feta on my grocery run instead of the plain feta, so I used my roommate's. For context, the two containers look identical except for the green vs blue label, and I usually buy the blue container. I used about half of my roommate's plain feta and already mixed it into my food.

I apologized again and offered to buy her more feta, but she said no and repeated, ""I just wanted to address this issue up front for the future. I'll just have to wait to do my meal prep until tomorrow.""

After some time going back and forth, my sister called and I left to go into another room. She told me I shouldn't feel the need to apologize since she didn't accept any of mine, but I can't help the need to make amends. There's already been some underlying tension between the two of us and I want to resolve any conflict asap. Do I Venmo her? Text another apology?

Also pushing me for more babies,"There is a 16-year age gap between us. I’m 30, he’s 46. We’ve been married for 3 years and we have two children. His career is his top priority. He has climbed to the top of the hierarchy in a very large company

We met a few years ago when I was working at the same company. He is Polish and I am Slovak. We in Slovakia have been some sort of outsourcing for the plant in Poland that he was leading. He always spoke down to my department because customer service it seems is very low. I knew from my boss that he said we are "" trash"". But it wasn't personal for me at that point. I did meet him face to face when he was probably ""forced"" by headquarters to come to Slovakia and meet us. He didn't even answer to my hello. not to my colleagues. He did go out for a coffee with the leader of the customer service but that was it

I wanted more career wise and I moved to Poland myself internally, directly to the plant. We basically got to know each other from scratch — he had divorced recently. Even at the plant there were like 7 layers between us. I am in no managerial position. But we met actually outside of the office - its a medium size city and we started talking. Due to internal regulations I changed companies so I can have a real relationship with him. He helped me to find a job somewhere else and we became official. Got married within a year. And he helped me get back at the plant too, nothing prestigious. . I don't report to him, but we found a workaround and I report to the headquarters.

We have a daughter and a son. Our daughter is only a few months old. He barely spends any time with them, but now he wants another baby. He comes home always tired, always irritated, and he has daily conflicts with his subordinates. He doesn’t waste time with friends; when he’s not at the office or out working, he’s home with us, but he’s either sleeping or on his phone, always talking about work and stressed out. I am not ready for another baby but maybe in a year or so. However, I will return to work soon, so at the plant he leads and I checked some emails, looking for key words. I found an email with a long chain and at the bottom of it was an email from him saying that all those... Sl0vaks are doing tr#sh work and he wants to get rid of them because they are all a bunch of barely out of high school ""philosophy"" students who came here to take our people's jobs.",2,1762844900.0,NarcissisticSpouses,0,1.0,False
1ou2x21,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ou2x21,Fiddle leaf trouble,"Good day :)

Fiddle leaf is going through some pain currently. For a while actually. Was infested by thrips which kept coming back. Finally decided to trimm all affected leaves a few weeks back. Also sprayed the plant with neem oil, soap, water mix a couple of times. Havent seen any thrips since then. 

However, now i have leaves developing these brown patches and falling off. Others are yellowing very slightly and falling off. 

Did not change watering procedure which is sticking in 2 wooden chipsticks all the way to the bottom once a week and only watering when they come oit pretty much dry again after being inserted for about 30s. 

I cant make out any other creatures on the plant and i assume this is not root rot because im making sure to only water once the soil is dry. 

Yesterday i did discover some new growth. Ive had that 2 times in the past but both times it stalled out and died before developing fully. 

The plant is kind of close to a west facing window. Its winter in switzerland so lights is rather low currently. Humidity of the room is around 50%. 

Could it be linked to my misting the plant with the neem oil mixture?

The coffee plant also has some similar browing but i guess this is an untelated issue?

Would love to hear you insights. 
Thank you!

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

We're implementing a polymer flooding technique but honestly the reservoir conditions are giving me massive headaches. The high temperture and salinity are causing our polymer to degrade faster than expected, and we're not seeing the viscosity values we need.

I've tried adjusting the polymer concentration and even switched to a different polymer type (from HPAM to a more temperature-resistant one), but the results are still dissapointing. Our injectivity has improved, but we're not seeing the mobility control we expected in the reservoir. The economics are starting to look shaky since we're using more chemical than anticipated without the corresponding oil production increase.

Has anyone here dealt with similar issues in South East Asian reservoirs? Any tips on polymer selection or treatment methods that might work better in these conditions? Our team has a review with management next month, and I'd really like to have some potential solutions to present.

I am not looking to sell candles or create for anything other than personal use/gifts to family and friends. I also am VERY sensitive to artificial fragrances. Yankee Candle will give me a migraine just walking by the store and a lot of cheaper department store candles will set off my allergies in a huge way. That said, I also own other candles from small retailers/craftspeople that I know are made with fragrance oil (not essential oil) that don’t bother me at all! Some of my favorite candles I own are coffee, vanilla, linen, and orchid scented which I know are not EO candles.

Are there any scent experts out there that can help me navigate purchasing fragrance oils that I probably won’t get sick from? Are there certain ingredients or red flags in cheaper candles that I’m probably reacting to? How does one assess a high quality FO versus lower quality? Any help is greatly appreciated. I’m hoping to make my candle-loving boyfriend some Christmas gifts and I’ve found great resources here for safety and handling, but I’m hoping there’s some advice here for finding scents that I can enjoy too.

1ou2mj2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ou2mj2,13 hours to Tokyo never felt this short,"Just got back from a trip to Tokyo, finally visited Akihabara again after years, and  it still has that electric chaos I remembered. The giant screens blasting anime trailers, rows of gachapon machines, the faint smell of curry rice and electronics dust mixing in the air, it's sensory overload in the best way. I'd been dying to check out the new Animate building and some of the collab cafés (the JJK café had the cutest themed desserts). Totally worth the wait.

Outside of Akihabara, I spent one morning just walking through Ueno Park with coffee in hand, watching the early autumn leaves start to change. It's one of those quiet Tokyo moments that feels worlds away from the neon noise just a few stops over.

But tbh, the 13-hour flight from LA to get there is always rough. I usually can't sleep on planes, and the tiny seat screen just makes it worse. This time I brought a small head display called Goovis with me, basically a wearable private screen. I watched Dune 2 and Past Lives, and both looked gorgeous.  Since it's open-style, I could still glance down to grab my drink or talk to the crew. For once, I actually didn't mind being stuck on a plane for half a day.

If you're planning a trip to Tokyo soon, definitely save some time for just wandering. Akihabara's still the wild heart of anime culture, but I also loved the slower corners, Yanaka's little coffee shops, and the book street near Jimbocho are absolute gems.

I had only just gotten out of 6th grade when my older brother Jonathan passed. I woke up for another summer day to both of my parents in the kitchen with sore, red eyes. I made myself cereal and sat down. Before I could start eating, my mom sat down next to me.

""Sweetie, I don't know how to tell you, but Jonathan died last night in a bad car accident.""

To be fair, I don't remember this memory; this is just what my parents told me. After that, I was never quite the same. I couldn't focus on schoolwork at all. I lost all interest in soccer. By freshman year, I had a 2.1 GPA, and I somehow graduated with a 1.6. I guess the school was trying to graduate as many people as possible for funding. But a few months after high school, I was the same, but now with more free time. I would sleep most of the day away and wake up around 6 PM for dinner. One night, my parents sat me down for a talk.

“Listen, you know we love you, but we can’t afford to have you living here much longer. You’re going to need to find a place until you can get a job and start chipping in.”

A couple of days later, I called my grandparents to ask if I could stay at their house until I found a job. Being the nice people they are, they let me stay. Once I got over there and set things up, I started applying everywhere in my small town. Eventually, after a week, this new mom & pop shop called me in for an interview. I went in about 3 days later and met with the owner. I walked up to the store in a nice pair of slacks and a button-down. The old man behind the counter, Terry, walked around slowly and asked,

""Are you Ryan? For the interview?""

I nodded yes, and he told me to follow him. The shop smelled of disinfectant and looked relatively new. In the back, Terry asked me some questions about availability and hours. After telling him that I'm always free, it was pretty easy to get the job. He said that they couldn't find anyone to cover the graveyard shift if the store was going to be 24/7. Knowing what he was about to ask, I said I could cover the shift. He smiled and shook my hand.

""Be here tomorrow at 10 PM.""

I nodded as I walked off. I got in my car and noticed that I wasn't as nervous during the interview, especially after how I acted in high school. I had trouble focusing and was a little dizzy, but my words were coming out clearer than ever. I brushed it off as good luck and drove back to my grandparents’ house. After I had gotten back, I heard my grandma talking to someone in my bedroom. I went to see what she was doing, and when I opened my door, I saw nothing. There was no one in my room, no one who could have been making those noises. 

I brushed it off as my mind just playing tricks on me, mainly so I wouldn't have to think about the implications of what I heard. I barely got any actual sleep that night, possibly because of my horrid sleep schedule or the impossible sound I had heard. Eventually, I drifted off to sleep and woke up in the early afternoon the next day. I stumbled my way to the kitchen to make myself some coffee. Surprisingly, I didn't see my grandparents. I called out for them and looked, but they were nowhere to be found. Back in the kitchen, on the counter sat a note:

""Grandpa and I went to visit your cousins in Ixon, be back Friday.""

The only problem was that they left before I got off shift yesterday.

———————————————————————————

I walked in at 9:55, a little earlier than what Terry said, but,

""To be on time is to be late.""

My dad always told me. The shop still smelled of disinfectant. I approached the counter, and that's where I found Melinda. Melinda was Terry's wife; she seemed to keep everything in order around here. I asked where to go for training, and she looked at me, confused.

""Honey, all I need you to do is ring customers up. There's no training.""

I nodded and asked where Terry was. She pointed me to the back of the store, so I stepped back there. From the sound of things, Terry seemed to be on the phone. I quietly made my way towards him, not to interrupt. That's when I looked at him. He doesn't have a phone in his hand. He's not talking to anyone. I waved over to him, but to no avail. Eventually, after watching him talk to the air for a few minutes, I walked up to him.

""Terry? Who are you talking to?"" 

He looked at me as if I had annoyed him.

“It's rude to interrupt people while they're on the phone, ya know.”

I stammered and apologized. He pointed at where the uniform was and said he was leaving for the night. I put on the employee outfit and made my way to the front.

“Don't mind him, he has a bit of undiagnosed dementia or schizophrenia or something,"" 

Melinda stated. I stepped back in shock.

“You never got him diagnosed? I mean, those types of things are pretty serious,"" 

I responded. She shrugged me off and started getting the register ready for me. Melinda showed me the basics and got in the car outside, where Terry was waiting. I waved them goodbye as I stood there, realizing that I was a lot more tired than I should be for an 8-hour shift. I told myself to power through it as I leaned on the counter by the register. After about 30 minutes, this ringing in my ears started going. It wasn't overbearing, but it sure as hell was loud. After about an hour of dealing with that, a customer walked in. I greeted them and started getting the checkout space clear. As I was cleaning away the clutter, I heard someone say,

“Are you ok?”

I jumped up and saw it was the customer with his hands full.

“What do you mean?"" 

""You weren't cleaning anything. It looked like you were carrying air and moving it to the side,"" 

I looked down and saw an empty space, something I had been decluttering just a second ago. I excused myself and rang him up. He walked out, staring me down like I had offended him in some way. I rubbed my eyes just to try and wake myself up again, but I was awake. I was sure there was trash on the counter a moment before. As I was trying to collect myself, I got this feeling in the pit of my stomach. I looked up and out into the big window at the front of the store. Outside was a figure, across the street, just staring at the shop, or perhaps staring at me. I tried to make eye contact with them, but it was just a silhouette. As soon as I took my eyes away from them to do something else, I got that feeling in my stomach again. I took another glance at the window, and now they were pressed up against the glass. I stumbled back, paralyzed with fear, and just stared at them for what seemed like multiple lifetimes.

———————————————————————————

I woke up the next day after what had happened. I had a splitting headache and was very confused about how I ended up back home. The last thing I remembered was seeing the silhouette up against the glass, and now I was here. It was far too vivid to be some nightmare but too strange to be reality. I called up Terry, and he picked up rather quickly.

""Ryan? Where the hell did you go last night?""

I was dumbfounded. If I had left in such a manner that caused that type of reaction from Terry, where did I go? I explained to him that I myself didn't remember, and then he stopped me.

""How on earth do you not remember barging out of the back exit? You left the door unlocked, for Christ’s sake!""

I froze, and just as I was about to respond, Terry said,

""You left your car in the lot. You ran into the woods across from the store at 2 in the morning! What the hell happened?""

I was asking myself the same question. Then suddenly I heard footsteps outside my bedroom door. I abruptly hung up on Terry and was so thrown off by everything, I didn't know what was behind that door. The handle rattled before being opened, and in stepped my grandma.

""Ryan, look at you, you're a mess.""

I looked down and saw dirt everywhere on my clothes. I stared back at her as if she had the answers I was looking for.

""Wash up, you have work soon.""

I looked at my clock and realized I had slept in until 8 PM, and I was still in my work uniform. I told her that I wasn't feeling well and would probably have to call in sick. After a change of clothes and a warm shower, I called Terry back to let him know I wouldn't be coming in. He told me I should just take the rest of the week off, seeing as I was clearly not in the right mental state. I thanked him, hung up, and slumped down onto my bed. I tried to distract myself by scrolling on my phone, but the thoughts of what happened kept flooding my mind. Why didn't I remember anything after I saw the person? Did they knock me out somehow, and I lost my memory? But if they did knock me out, how did I run out of the back of the store? 

As I lay there pondering the possibilities, I realized I was still very tired, surprising, seeing as I had just slept for an entire day. But I gave in just to escape the reality of the situation I was in. I fell asleep rather quickly. After drifting off, I woke up in the middle of the night. I couldn't move. I realized I was having sleep paralysis; I tried to calm myself down, until I saw it. Outside of my bedroom window was the silhouette person, looking at me as if I had forsaken them. I almost had a panic attack as I was making eye contact with this eyeless entity. I woke up in a cold sweat and with a blistering headache. I wiped my eyes and looked around. On the floor was a broken glass lamp that wasn't in pieces before I fell asleep.

———————————————————————————

About 2 weeks after the events prior took place, I was resting at my grandparents’ place. Nothing too strange has happened, except for a few headaches and misplaced things. I think what happened was due to a mix of stress, sleep deprivation, and malnutrition. I wasn't eating much, and since I had a night shift, my sleep schedule was basically nocturnal. On top of that, getting kicked out of my parents’ place didn't help much. But after all of that, I think I'm okay enough to go back to work, plus, I really need the money. When I clocked in, Melinda hugged me and said,

“Honey, I feel so bad for what happened! Are you doing better?”

I told her I was and not to worry. Terry wasn't there that night, so I got to work pretty quickly. After an hour or two of run-of-the-mill customers, I heard something in the back. It sounded like someone was throwing things around in the pantry. I jumped a bit and slowly walked back there. Stupidly, I didn't have any sort of weapon to defend myself. If the person were armed with anything, I would be screwed. When I turned the corner towards the pantry, I saw no mess, no one in the pantry, and nothing was out of place. I was frozen.

“No no no no NO!”

Why am I back here? I thought I was fine! I took the time off! What is happening? I shuffled to the register, lightly hyperventilating, and I tried to stay calm. I picked up the store phone and entered “911.” I didn't dial it; I just had it ready in case something actually happened. After half an hour of no customers, I heard that ringing in my ears again. That same ringing I got on my first shift here, the kind of ringing so loud that my hands started buzzing. I decided not to give in to the fear this time. The last time that happened, I ran into the woods at 2 in the morning. Anything that would happen for the remainder of this shift, I was going to be as calm as possible. 

I was on a pretty high horse until I looked outside the front window and saw the silhouette again. It was like when I had sleep paralysis. I was so stricken with fear that I couldn't even blink. As I was making visual contact with this thing, I noticed it was getting bigger. I focused as hard as I could on it before realizing it wasn't growing; it was moving towards me. I stumbled back into the wall behind me, knocking over some shelves filled with cigarettes. I hit the call button on the store phone with 911 pre dialed and made a run for the back door. I collided with the back exit, but it didn't budge. I pushed against it, but to no avail. I stepped back and read the note left for me by Melinda:

“Locked it for your own safety. I hope you understand.”

I read the note one more time just to seal my fate. I turned around and peeked into the front of the store. The front door was wide open. With nowhere to run to, I just waited for whatever entered the store to find me. On the floor, I saw a shadow of something behind the corner, slowly moving towards the back of the shop. My head hung on my shoulders as I looked down, not wanting to see whatever this thing was. After some minutes had passed, I noticed it had stopped moving. It was just there, standing. Still, I did not want to look at it, until it made me.

“Ryan.”

The thing spoke to me in a familiar voice, somewhere I had heard long ago. I couldn't fight it anymore. I looked up at it.

It was Jonathan.

Cops found me passed out in the back of the store no less than 5 minutes later. I’m writing this down in case my memory slips on me again, I’m not crazy, I know what I saw. This is my official statement in case they try to blame this on some mental condition. I know what I saw and they aren’t taking that away from me.

We both agreed that we are outgoing people who like to have friends over often. When we first moved in, we went out together and to coffee and lunch and just spent a lot of time together overall. We might not have been the best of friends immediately, but we get along well and we live together seamlessly. 

However, after the first month she started to deny my invitations to hangout together. She stopped going to the dining hall, and stopped hanging out with friends. She goes to class and spends the rest of her time in the dorm on her iPad or laptop. I joined clubs and made an effort to make friends, and I invite her to every club meeting and I introduce her to every new friend I make so that she can have a chance to meet people too. But every time I do she refuses to come with or she ignores the friends I bring over. I have continued to go out with friends and invite people over, but she refuses to come with me. I haven’t judged her for this at all, and I still invite her out with me. But when I bring people over she just sits on her phone in bed, and she judges me when I come home late on a weekend. 

I started calling my boyfriend (18m) during the day and leaving for lunch and studying outside the dorm because she doesn’t talk to me when I try to talk to her anymore. I still invite her every time I leave, but she never says yes to coming with me. I had my boyfriend over this weekend, and I had to pay her $25 to leave the room for 2 and a half hours so that we could have some alone time. She then proceeded to spend the rest of the weekend alone in the room so we had to leave. I don’t think it’s bad that she doesn’t like to go party, but I also don’t think I should have to stay in because she refuses to. I never get alone time unless she is at class. This would be fine, except she doesn’t like to talk to me anymore so we just coexist silently. I feel bad being in the room because she obviously doesn’t want anything to do with me.

So around three days ago I played Homicipher and I felt obsessed right away with one of the characters. Homicipher is a horror-ish deciphering game with horror characters that you can subtly romance. 
I’m scared that I subconsciously manifested the company of some evil entity because I’m a lonely hikikomori that always had a passion for fantasizing about some higher dimensional creature watching over me and liking me since I was 13, when synchronicities started being part of my daily life. Yesterday I couldn’t sleep at night and I ended up falling asleep for three hours in the middle of the day. About two hours after I woke up I choked on water the moment I was thinking about that horror character. I choked in a way that I never have before. (by the way, I’m not delusional and thinking that that specific character broke the 4th wall for me and is now haunting me, I just think that fixating on a game with dark topics and such a horror atmosphere might have lured something.) It lasted for 10/15 seconds and I thought I was really going to die. It was horrible. And I’ve choked on spit or water before, but this time I was truly gasping for air, and I wheezed very badly when I tried to calm down and take a breath through my mouth, since my nose was completely shut off too. Then, a while later (this is stupid but I never break my things.) I broke my favourite mug and I don’t even know how. I think my foot hit the coffee table and it fell. And meanwhile in all these three days I started seeing black dots in my peripheral view. Now I feel like I’m just connecting nonexistent dots and I know I might start seeing everything like it’s a ghosts doing, like I’m probably already doing, but I also got my period the same day I played the game, and it was late by a week and my period has always been super on the clock.

Enter Pokémon Unite.

I know, I know — I laughed too. But hear me out:

Ranked matches are 10 minutes. That’s it. No 60-minute emotional marathons where you’re praying your carry doesn’t DC at 45. You get your dopamine hit, your teamfight high, and you’re back to life before your coffee even goes cold.

The MMR system is tighter and saner. You actually feel progress without needing spreadsheets or therapy.

The heroes (okay, Pokémon) are surprisingly deep. Each one has mechanics that reward skill and timing, not just pay-to-win builds. There’s real complexity under the cute skins.

And unlike LoL, the art style doesn’t make me feel like I’m trapped in an overdesigned fantasy cosmetics store. (No offense to LoL fans, but that interface gives me anxiety.)

For context, I was a hardcore Vainglory player before it died, and Dota filled that void for a while. But Pokémon Unite somehow hits that sweet spot between Vainglory’s slick mobile design and Dota’s tactical chaos — minus the 1-hour commitment and emotional damage.

So yeah. I think I’m cured.
MMR still matters, but at least now I can touch grass between matches. 🌱

No memory improvements. No brain fog difference. No anxiety reduction. Honestly i'm less productive than before, probably about 50% as productive.

Caffeine made me feel good and locked in. I feel unplugged without it most of the time.

My wife knew for a year, but I told my sister and my mom just two months ago. There were almost no follow up questions beyond ""And you're sure about this?""

When I told my mom, I asked her for a new middle name for when I legally change it.

Then about a week ago I was getting coffee with my mom, and she parked the car and grilled me about why I'm doing this. It wasn't mean, or hurtful, but she was worried about me. I was caught pretty off guard. She, by that point, had not successfully used the correct pronouns or new name. She hadn't discussed my request for a new middle name. When I pointed out I would prefer she use the new name, call me ""she/her"" and not ""he/him,"" she always apologized and said it was a difficult thing for her to adjust to after 40 years. Fair enough. She never argued.

But after two months of no questions, comments, even if I decided to bring it up, I was blindsided by her asking me *so suddenly.* Was I sure? Was this maybe depression and confusion? What if I decided to go back?

My answers were... Not satisfactory *to me.* I felt I yammered and stuttered and fumbled my way through. I was too close, and too emotional to answer properly. So I typed a big ass email to her, and wound up sending it to her, my wife, and my sister to make some things more clear. I'm not exactly sure why I am posting it here, but here it is below. Names removed.

----------

I've been thinking about our conversation earlier today, in the car. You know, when I told Wife, she had several questions for me. What did I feel, for how long, why didn't I do or say anything sooner–things like that. She would have more over time, too. Mostly about checking in on my status, like if I'm still okay with this. If I'm worried or doubting.

Originally I typed here that I haven't had any doubts. That would be a lie, of course. I had doubts. But I don't now. I haven't since I spoke up about this to Wife. My doubts all happened earlier than that. When I told you that the first time I thought ""I wish I had just been born a girl"" was when I was at most 15, I meant it. I remember the moment well because the thought left me confused and scared.

I was in the bathroom. I was stepping into the shower and it crossed my mind and then refused to leave. I think the confusion speaks for itself, but being scared? I sorta thought I knew who I was, ya know? It feels so stupid to say that now, almost 40, that I could have known anything about who I really was at 15, but that's how a 15 year old thinks... In any event I WAS confused, and I WAS scared. So I did the only thing that made sense to me at the time, and I tried to ignore it.

I thought about it a lot, and I mean a whole fucking LOT.

You know back in the 90s, the only examples of anyone like me were played for laughs. You'd get crossdressers in TV (like Drew's brother in Drew Carey Show, or David Duchovny in Twin Peaks), just clearly a man in a dress and wig and the audience would laugh and laugh. They're a joke! Isn't it funny? There's SOMETHING WRONG WITH THEM!

School wasn't any better. One of the guys is a little smaller than the average? Maybe a little girlier? Relentless bullying. I had my fair share of being bullied, some you know of and most I never told anyone about. Not really a forum of intellectual discussion on gender identity, right?

But I DID always get along better with the girls. Sure, I hung out with the guys. I was great friends with Male Friend 1, and he was as straight as bent spring. You may recall when you told me he was married to a dude and I said ""Yeah, sounds right."" Or Male Friend 2, who I swear was in love with me with how clingy he was. Straight like a fish hook. Super macho, that one... But I always still had Female Friend 1, and Female Friend 2, and Female Friend 3, etc.

Hell! How many high school boys back then do you reckon kept their stuffed animals from when they were a kid? Barney the Bear was an exception, but I kept a load of them. That stuffed raccoon... Remember that one? 

But without a way that I could explore my thoughts on this without relentless mockery and abuse, I just kept it to myself. You know, when you do that for long enough you can even come just shy of convincing yourself that it wasn't serious in the first place. It wasn't until I was 21 or 22 that I learned there were actual ways to transition that didn't need me to just obviously be a man in a dress like so many examples from my youth. By then, though, I just said to myself, ""I've been this, whatever the fuck that means, for two decades. I can deal.""

So I kept ignoring it. But ignoring a thing don't make it disappear. ""Silence like a cancer grows,"" I think is the line from Simon & Garfunkle? 

I know you remember that I used to make faces in the mirror waiting for the shower to heat up, or after using the bathroom. I had long since stopped by then. I did everything I could to not look. You once joked I had a beard because I was too lazy to shave.

I have a beard because it hides my face. I let it grow long because I need the mirror to shave.

I had a difficult time saying why I felt the way I do yesterday (yes this took long enough that it began with ""earlier today"" and is now ""yesterday""). It's because I cannot put into words what it feels like to see yourself in reflections, in photographs, and see a face that shouldn't be yours. That feels like it belongs to someone else! Maybe I could... maybe I could work at it, and find a way to express the way my heart sinks when I look down at the rest of my body while I'm showering or getting dressed. How hot my cheeks feel when I clench my jaw every time I hear a man's voice in a recording and know it's ME! 

I wouldn't wish this on anyone... I feel like a stranger in my own body. ""Comfortable."" You said you wish for me to be comfortable. To hell with comfortable! I just want to feel like I belong in here. I don't want to feel like I'm in a prison without hope for escape.

This got heavy.

...sorry. I'm okay. I promise.

Stop crying, mom.

I started this whole thing because, for more than a decade, I don't think a single day has gone by that I didn't think or say, ""I wish I had just been born a girl."" The same thought, verbatim from when I was 15.

I just couldn't push the fucking boulder up the goddamned hill anymore. 

I don't have doubts about this. Not a one. But I do have regrets. I regret ignoring myself for 23 years. I regret having been afraid before.

I regret that I had to have these conversations because I am not normal. That Sister had to tell me how she thinks she's woke, but wants me to correct her if being listed as ""Not Brother"" in her phone is wrong (still hilarious, by the way). That you're so concerned you didn't ask me hardly anything for almost two months, and when you finally did you broke down and cried. That my decision on my new name has impacted Wife and how she's always felt about her own name.

I regret starting this thinking it was just going to be a text message, Jesus Christ this is way too long for a text.

I love you all,

1ou2guh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ou2guh,"D'Life interiors, Bangalore - Review","Sharing my experience with D'Life Interiors, Bangalore. I've shared some of these points as comments in other posts but I am putting out a detailed review now that the project is complete and we have lived with the results for a few months.

NOTE: This is not a paid/sponsored review. It is my family's experience with D'Life Interiors, Bangalore. The teams assigned were from their various branches and partnerships in Bangalore. The below doesn't guarantee everyone has or will have the same experience with D'Life, but the chances of getting what you want are higher than most other firms. This review does not include the Kitchen and wardrobes as these were not part of the scope with D'Life.
Check out their YouTube showcases and experience centers to get a better feel and understanding of their work.


Initial impressions
We reached out to multiple interior companies after the first half of the project was ruined by a local carpenter/supplier. During which someone had recommended checking out D'Life in Reddit's r/Bengaluru community (the mod there took down the post for some reason), after which we dug a little deeper and found D'Life interiors to seemingly have the best finishing through their YouTube videos. We visited D'Life Interiors, at HSR Layout to be specific. The management and designers did a basic check on our requirements and agreed to move forward with the project, since technically, there was a lot more than just half the home to complete (which the other interior companies didn't understand). This already gave a first impression of how patient and understanding this company was. The work covered all bedrooms and the Living Room (and some chairs/stools for the kitchen). The entire kitchen and major wardrobes were done (messed up would be the accurate term) by the previous vendor.
The team came over to the location multiple times to measure and plan out the designs. Everyone was surprisingly punctual throughout the project, despite the traffic, which I think is unheard of in Bangalore/Bengaluru. Timelines were followed as best as they could (minor delays due to holidays and other reasons cited by the team).

Pros (First two months)
1. Very good sales, design and management team who were all easy and comfortable to communicate with. Just well mannered overall.

2. Not big, but a good enough experience center in HSR Layout. Enough to give customers an understanding of what they can get.

3. As mentioned before, the team visited the location multiple times, always on time, to assess and design the space.

4. Surprisingly good use of tools. We've never seen any company/carpenter use tools from brands like Bosch and Stanley before. A minor detail but one worth noting.

5. Excellent communication via a dedicated Whatsapp group.

6. Quick understanding of design requirements and quick revisions (despite our assigned designers busy schedule).

7. Great explanation of materials at the experience center. This helped understand which ones to pick from a financial, practical and aesthetic standpoint.

8. A very well thought out process in general, pre-implementation/pre-execution.

9. The company is based out of Kochi, Kerala. The state already has a good reputation in terms of carpentry. This is mentioned as a pro because D'Life is quite transparent with their production facility and where the materials are processed and transported from.

10. 3D designs provided on time.

Cons (First two months) - This doesn't undermine the pros mentioned above. Some nitpicks that the company has already been informed of.
1. The Designs aren't necessarily creative or open. They are, in ways, restricted to what D'Life already offers.

2. This is a potential con, but one that can be ignored if it doesn't apply to you. Products, Materials and Color choices are also, in a lot of ways, restricted. This is partially a good thing as D'Life's designers and management have explained that the materials offered are always available throughout their service period (10 years for warranty and Lifetime for support if I remember correctly). But it also hampers some design choices that customers would like to make. Luckily in our case, we were happy with what was available.

3. We did make some minor layout and design choices ourselves, since we didn't completely love what was proposed at first. This might be subjective too cause we already knew what we wanted. But there are many parts of the design that indicated that the designer hadn't properly considered spacing and dimensions required for certain areas of the room and objects. Human errors were present.

4. Confusing quotation process with misleading discount timelines, and later, an abruptly higher quotation than what was first informed. This slightly lowered our mood because we had already been through similar troubles before. We had later, mutually agreed via email to proceed with the work and resolve any concerns when the project is complete, but it is still something many users have complained of online. D'Life should really consider simplifying this process and make it more transparent. If D'Life was some cheap interior company, it would make sense that they would behave this way, but they do amazing work and this aspect undermines all the hard work they do. If management from D'Life interiors is reading this, honestly, consider this point since D'Life interiors has tremendous potential to be the best interior firm in India.

5. 3D designs were not as helpful as we thought. It was just a POV from a fixed position in the room, instead of a free roam, detailed look at the work. Ideally it would be great if the 3D provided was something like photo mode in modern video games, and certain aspects like drawers and shutters were interactive.

6. Certain aspects like electrical work weren't clear during the design process.

7. Profit margins are quite high. D'Life interiors won't appeal to customers who have positive contacts with local carpenters and don't care much about the process and quality/finish.

Once the designs and quotations were confirmed. It took just a little over a week for D'Life to prepare the materials and transport it to our home. Surprisingly fast given these were custom parts. Then they had proceeded with the work in the following order: Thin Yellow cover sheets (for existing furniture, electronics, doors..etc) -> Material delivery -> Electrical work -> Assembly (with some material delivery and electrical work in between) -> Painting -> Sofa setup

We were present on location almost everyday due to other work we had ongoing on location at the time.

Pros (Next two months)
1. The team had arrived on location within a week post confirmation to wrap all existing furniture, doors and electronics. They were very cooperative in wrapping everything we wanted them to wrap. Also, on time material delivery. Minimal cutting on cutting, most of the materials are prepared in the factory and shipped as per designs (except for things like panels). Materials were primarily assembled on site which is a contrast to what cheaper interior firms do.

2. The 'Project Manager' assigned frequently supervised the project.

3. Team's punctuality. It's unbelievable how punctual they always were (for our location at least).

4. The project manager, electricians and carpenters were cooperative with us on many aspects like covering doors and A.C's, closing bathroom doors for other work, timings, electrical switch placement, unit shifting..etc.

5. Exceptionally skilled teams. We had experience in doing our interiors with LivSpace, independent carpenters, electricians, plumbers, painters..etc. and none of them so far were as well planned or executed as D'Life's. The electrical team had done the wiring work so well with walls being cut in straight lines and right angles (if you've worked with some local electricians before, you'd know they don't care about this stuff and just cut the walls like Picasso) with very neat putty application once finished. The carpenters were very careful in placing materials in ways that minimize damage to the home's walls and assembled everything so calmly and systematically.

6. The sofa was only delivered and set once the entire work was complete (very sensibly planned from D'Life's part).

7. Painting and wall finishing was very nicely and carefully done. Surprisingly, the paint didn't have any smell (Asian paints premium emulsion) that we usually notice when homes are painted. The project manager mentioned that this was the case since D'Life uses original brand materials. I'm not an expert on various types of paints and brands so it's better if someone else who has worked with D'Life and used Asian paints also confirms this. Imperfections are visible if you go close enough.

8. The delivered materials were all wrapped in thin cardboard paper taped with D'Life's logo. It's a small touch, but adds to the experience. Most firms and carpenters deliver the materials exposed and in the end, a lot end up damaged for which they later charge the customer.

9. The materials delivered are very solid. I tried lifting just a small cut-out portion of plywood which was being thrown away, it was heavy! (Gurjan plywood is what they mentioned, I don't think it's from Indonesia though like they mentioned first, but I can't confirm that either). The coffee table we got reflects this (we got wheels for that later XD cause it weighed like a motorcycle ) and just shows how solid the materials are overall.

10. Exceptional finishing on plywood and laminates. Edge bandings were perfectly fitted and thin enough to not notice them, laminates were pasted flat and perfect on the plywood. In comparison, cheap work can usually be noticed where laminates are pasted poorly and the reflection appears wavy.

11. Minimal to zero panel gaps in all fittings.

12. Most home's walls have tiles fitted towards the edge of the floor. The previous interior supplier had completely taken off the tiles and left them in corners of the house to install the built-in wardrobes. D'Life had cut the plywood to fit around it (might be common practice but still amazing to see how well thought out the process is).

13. Wall mounted plywood/furniture have been fitted with ladder frameworks under them for stability. This wasn't done on our instructions, which again, shows how well designed each unit is from a technical standpoint. For cases where customers have no clues on how this all works, this is really reassuring.

14. Fluted wall panels were installed with a very interesting technique. I won't share this in case this is D'Life's trade secret and I respect that.

15. Close to expected timeline on project delivery. Some minor delays.

Cons (Next two months)
1. Mistakes were made with delivered materials in terms of measurements of some furniture. For example, the TV unit, which couldn't fit the AVR we purchased. The AVR's dimensions were shared earlier, but since the designer likely didn't know how it works and the space it needs for wiring, the entire unit's depth was lesser than what was required. This was later resolved by D'Life with a separate unit. D'Life should consider studying varios home theater systems and maybe improve this aspect in the future. 60 cm would be the suggested depth of the unit, AVR's have different dimensions but have an overall threshold. They need enough air above them for the vents and enough space behind them for the wiring.  

2. Certain aspects of the electrical boxes and hinge placements weren't clearly communicated and in the end, were not what was expected. eg. separate electrical boxes for sockets instead of being built/flushed into the wall, hinges being placed on the base of the unit (shutter opens downward) which takes away space required to place objects in it.

3. There were certain rules that seemed unfair. First one being, adding more shelves to the cupboards are separately charged after the project execution has started, but are included with the cupboard's cost during planning.

4. Minor nitpick. We wanted to shift one of the wall mounted drawers a little higher. This cost us around 6000 Rs. for each shift as per D'Life's policy, which was higher than it should have been. But this was done by the team seamlessly so we don't have any major problems with this besides the cost.

5. The LED strips provided are a little excessive in power consumption and weren't practical. Some LED's were just taped onto the surfaces in some parts of the project instead of having a grove in it and later being covered with the diffuser. It's not that D'Life cannot cut the groves cause other parts of the project had it, planning error maybe. Overall electrical charges were hefty in comparison to the rest of the quotation. Since they were taped onto some surfaces, some of the strips started peeling off after a month (which they taped/stuck back later).

6. The pull-out and push-to-open drawers don't seem premium enough, despite being hettich branded mechanisms. One of them already doesn't work as expected. Drawers from IKEA which cost a fraction of the price feel much more sturdy and just better to open and close in comparison, even after 10 years.

7. The yellow wrap/cover done in the beginning wasn't as good as we had hoped. We expected a thicker material that would protect tiles and electronics from impact. But it was more of a dust cover. Getting thicker covers would push up the cost, but I think giving customers this choice would be ideal.

8. The sofa wasn't as good as we'd hoped. Instead of the lounge and sofa unit being attached to each other, they were separate units that move around easily due to low weight. The dimensions weren't good overall either like low seating to pillow space ratio (partially our fault for not noticing earlier). Better alternatives can be found in Home Center, Damro, Stanley's Sofas and more,IKEA...etc.


Suggestion to D'Life: Provide carpenters with those professional masks and glasses that you'd see on professional carpenter demos. This has long term benefits for the staff and for the business.

The final stage was the sign-off and satisfaction survey. Things got a little messy there but in none of these conversations did we feel uneasy. Everyone was so well behaved and each aspect of the project was reviewed calmly. It took a while to convince them of the mistakes in the quotation but they eventually rectified the same.

(Next 3-4 months)
1. The sofa provided didn't match the dimensions provided on the brochure. Two revisions were done. This is both a bad and good thing. It shows that D'Life makes mistakes but are honest enough to rectify those mistakes.

2. D'Life had provided a quotation that did not match the estimate provided in the first two months. Cost of electrical work and components, painting, revisions had gone up, beds were charged for customization. For which we sat a good while and discussed with the designers and supervisors and resolved. Whether the price we paid in the end was still higher than what is usually charged to other customers is still unknown.
Other user reviews were also cited during these discussions and we have suggested that D'Life as a company, not choose this route, even if customers don't often realize this, as again, D'Life does amazing work and should not undermine all their effort with tactics that are usually associated with fraud carpenters or other interior firms who already have bad reputations.

3. An additional unit below the TV unit was provided during these discussions and matched the constructed unit so well. This additional unit was for the AVR.

4. Some of the paint and walls had chipped off during the sofa revisions and there were some areas where the paint wasn't properly applied from before. These were corrected later on the project manager's instructions.

5. D'Life honors the warranty period and lifetime service policies with electricians or carpenters being sent in a few days when something needs to be fixed.

Conclusion
D'Life Interiors, from our experience, is one of the best interior design firms you can go with in Bangalore. It is a premium brand and costs can be slightly higher than average. Maybe come prepared in terms of aesthetic design and furniture placement as these are always subjective before starting the design phase (it's not uncommon for designers and customers to be out of sync). The execution was close to flawless from a technical standpoint. Excellent team who were professional in so many aspects like communication, uniform, tools used (D'Life could go easy on their staff with regards to uniform. A jacket or thin cloth with the logo on top of casual wear would be fine enough). The best part, D'Life doesn't ghost/avoid you if things go bad and, as mentioned before, are honest enough to acknowledge and rectify mistakes.
Indian interior firms/companies are notorious for cheating their customers in cost, materials or labor quality (D'Life still plays around with pricing to some extent). But I'm glad to say that D'Life has relatively exceeded expectations to the point where you could mistake this for an international brand in some aspects.

Alternative premium interior firms to check out : (though I think D'Life is still the best end to end service in comparison)
1. Hafele Design Studios - (D'Life provides Ceaser Stone countertops as well)
2. Rehau (they're primarily into laminates but we saw a kitchen that they do as part of that)

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

PART 1,"   Hi, let me preface this post, by making it clear that I've never written a Creepy Pasta before. This is my first venture into that sort of territory and honestly I probably wouldn't be caught dead writing one- that is.. if it wasn't for the fact that after all that's happened, I've been feeling that I need to find a place to write this all down. 

Maybe its just a way for me to come to terms with the reality of it all, to reassure myself that its all real. Or maybe by putting this story into something like Creep Cast I can reassure myself that I dreamed it up.. sort of establish that it is.. in fact.. fiction. 

But something tells me it won't be that simple.  Either way. I need to write this down. I need to put  this out there somewhere for somebody to find. For somebody to know.  I don't think Im in any danger, but I also get the feeling that what I'm about to talk about isn't exactly something I'm supposed to know, so who knows if I'll ever get another opportunity to say anything about this? 

Anyways, down to the meat of the matter.  Several weeks ago I was called by my friend Lisa who worked down at a gas station near River Flow Drive.. a little ways away from a sleepy college town called Dahlonega.  I lived in Atlanta, about an hour's drive out, so it really wasn't common for us to meet up after Lisa graduated College.   I still had about a year's worth of credits to get before I could join her and start searching for the starving artist job of my dreams, so most of my connection to her was kept through phone calls, texts and the occasional once a month trip into the Appalachian Trail.   Overall she was a very good friend to me, and in spite of how friends just seem to fall out of contact after a little bit after separations like this- she and I just couldn't fall apart like that. We just vibed you know? Not sure how to explain it. 

""Heya Mickey, how's tricks?"" Lisa's voice came over the speaker as I slid my Bamboo pen over my digital drawing pad.  We usually did voice calls over texts, cause my hands were always full. 

""Ah same old same old."" I muttered.  ""Got commisssions. Need to get an essay done for Mr. Flanders again.. and I still have no idea why I took metaphysics."" 

""In other words, you're still near broke."" said Lisa, her voice almost tracing the sly smile I knew she had to be wearing. 

""Shit Lisa.. no need to rub it in."" I said, smirking back and rolling my eyes as I continued to draw, switching the layers on my editing software with a few taps of my pen. ""You wouldn't be taunting me on this if you didn't have something for me though. So spill."" 

""Okay, so get this Micky.. Friend of mine, Terrance. He works at Game Stop right? Apparently its this different sort of Game Stop, more high end than the typical stores, pays a TON. He's going on vacay for a couple of weeks and needs somebody to fill in.  30 bucks a fuckin' hour!"" 

I felt my stomach twist and my mouth go dry,  I tried to say something intelligent. Like ask if there was a catch, or maybe if there were any special requirements, or why they didn't just ask for an employee from another nearby location to handle it. But instead my near broke deadass brain managed to simply say. ""Wut?"" 

""HA!  'wut' she says. Yeah.. you heard me. 30 bucks an hour, several weeks. And all you need to do is I don't know- whatever Game Stop employees do. Stock shelves and shit."" 

Stock shelves and shit. For 30 dollars an hour? That couldn't be right. I had seen the size of Game Stops before. They were small enough that usually a single employee could probably manage the whole place on a good day. At least to me it always seemed that way whenever I needed to get my controllers replaced.  I honestly ordered most of my game stuff online nowadays.   Last time I was excited to go to Game Stop was when I used to go get those fun event limited Pokemon for my 3DS.. and even then I never stayed  to do anything else. 

Maybe I just didnt' know enough about game retailing?  I don't know.  I trusted Lisa, and I needed the cash. 

""So they just need me to fill in and that's it?"" I asked, pausing to put down my pen and sip my coffee so I could begin to drink it all in. 

""I know it seems a BIT too good to be true, but trust me, this isn't the typical Game Stop. I think its a store for some special clientelle. I'm not exactly good on the specifics, but they also apparently need more help there to begin with anyways, so they want this to also be a trial run for a potential new employee. Full Time. ""  Lisa said.  ""Terrance is a childhood friend of mine, so no worries, I know he's legit. Just- at least go to the interview and see what they're about. If it seems bad, back out and we can talk about it- sound good?"" 

I sighed, weighing my limited options as my eyes scaled over my dingey dorm filled with stacks of Ramen Dinners in the corner and literally nothing else. 

My stomach clawed at my spine, as if daring me to pass up the opportunity to afford a real meal.

""Fuck it, lets do this."" I said. 

""YES! I'll send the address. Be there tomorrow, six pm sharp. They just wanna do an interview, nothing really major. Terrance will meet you there. "" 

The drive up was around 35 minutes. Overall, that was great for me. With my classes and my commissions, a good commute time was  good sign overall. 

The Game Stop however, wasn't like any other store location I had ever been to before.  Usually Game Stops from what I remembered were in malls or outlets. They never had their own big location like  Walmart or Costco.   But this one.. well.. when the building came into view I had to do a double take.

The Game Stop logo sat above the building much like you would see the logo of Target or Home Depot on their own large stores. Full on concrete, huge sliding double doors. I could see what Lisa meant when she said it wasn't like other Game Stop locations. 

Maybe Game Stop had upped its game since the last time I went. But I couldn't imagine that being the case given the state of Game Stop's stock before that one incident I think most are aware of.  Either way, this explained why they were looking for more employees.

There were no cars in the parkinglot except for a pure black SUV and what appeared to be a very old looking Ford Mustang. 

Terrance was waiting for me outside the large transparent automatic doors. He seemed like a handsome enough guy with sandy hair, a somewhat fit thin frame, half a stubble and what passed for a kind enough smile. Glasses perched jauntily on his long nose as he slid a clipboard under his arm and held out his free hand to shake mine.  ""Hey, you must be.. Mikoto right?"" 

""Micky is fine."" I said as I took his hand.  ""Big place you have here."" 

""Awesome right?"" He said, looking over his shoulder at the place. ""Big as it is, we only take a select few customers. Not many people in the lower end of the company even know it exists.  Come on, lets get you introduced to the ol' place."" 

He gestured for me to follow him inside, and I nearly hesitated. There was something odd about what he said. What kind of store was this?   Whatever it was that bothered me ,though, it definitely didn't bother me enough to admire the store for what it was. 

Rows upon rows of shelves filled to the brim with pcs.. controllers, boxes, headsets different kinds of gear as far as the eye could see.  It truly was a  ""What if Department Stores were run by Steam?"" sort of scenario. 

There were various acloves, sort of like Home Depot or IKEA where different gaming furniture, Monitor setups and gaming desks were set up with running systems connected so you could sit down, play and test out how everything ran.    Until today, I wasn't even sure if it was possible to run a department store that purely dedicated to gaming and only gaming. Even large PC super centers sold vacuums and washing machines sometimes.  

The further into the store I followed Terrence however, the more I started to notice a few weird things that stuck in my mind. 

There were sectioned off shelves near the center of the store where Consoles were primarily being shown off.   One of the waist high shelves, marked with a flag saying ""E-21112-ON LOCATION- showed off stuff I knew. XBox Ones,  PS4s and PS5s, Steam Decks, ROG Allies, The Switch 2. Even what looked like very nice refurbished Gamecubes and Gameboy Advances.  It made me kind of drool and I felt an urge to ask 'how much' for the Charizard Orange GBA SP in the corner of the end of the shelf. 

Then... we got to a shelf marked ""E-21113-DAILY RESTOCK"".. and it was filled with game systems I had NEVER heard of in my life.   The Play Sphere X50. Jolly Joy Handhelds. Meat Canyon Simulator 2027.   And the controllers. They didn't look like anything I had seen even. 

  
It got stranger the farther in we went, with some shelves holding the most weird ass devices I had ever seen in my life. One game console was what appeared to be a large metal bubble with a glass port hole where coral could be seen growing inside.. coral that seemed to twitch..   Controllers were plugged into it with wires, and the way their handles and triggers were designed in a twisting entertwining fashion all around what looked like 2 foot long handles, suggested that holding it meant you might have to wrap your limbs around them in the same fashion an octopus would, and you'd probably have to be jointless and boneless to pull it off.

""The fuck?"" I grunted. 

Terrance heard me and smiled back over his shoulder. ""Yeah.. like I said.. special place. Don't worry though, customers don't really shop here in person. Its rare they ever do actually. Most of our stuff is call in and delivery. Makes for a pretty quiet job and honestly you'll hear no complaints from me on that end."" 

As we strode towards a large door marked ""STAFF ONLY"" I caught a group of shelves filled with what appeared to be the physical game boxes. The actual cases holding the disks meant to be slotted in to whatever PC or Console was capable of playing them. 

And I was immediately confused. 

I caught a glimpse of some of the titles. Nothing strange there-

Battlefield 6, Pokemon ZA, Ghost of Yotei- some of the latest titles and.. in spite of the fact I knew at least one of the titles there ran on a completely exclusive system, they were all in the same style of box. 

A DVD-Bluray style case with NO labels indicating for what game console they were, what their rating was.  In fact I could only make out one large sticker slapped on each case, with what appeared to be sharpie hastily written down on each one. 

""Safe"",  ""Mild Danger"" ,  Seemed to be the words I saw the most. As well as ""Can be reasoned with"" and other weird indicators.  One box of ""Despicable Me the Game"" came with a label saying ""Fucking Christ don't open this Marcus, I swear."" 

And the weirdest part. All of them were padlocked and wrapped to slots in the shelves with what appeared to be bike chains. 

""You'll learn about that in a sec."" said Terrence as he caught me eying the shelves.  ""It won't make sense at first but- it's important."" 

We got settled in an office with a security desk that had various monitors showing parts of the store, and a bunch of plush couches. 

On the wall of the office there was a large rack holding what I assumed were replicas of items from various Video games. 

Kratos's Leviathan Axe from God of War,  Aloy's bow from the Horizon series,  a large hazmat suit that looked quite a bit like it came from Lethal Company.  Hot damn. This was some store.   Except it was weird how they were displayed.  Along with other game replicas, they seemed to be half hazardly stuffed up there, like they had been placed over there as an afterthought rather than displayed for the sake of displaying. Maybe they were also for sale and this was just where they kept all of it.

""Okay then."" Terrence said as he got settled on the desk and I took the nearest seat. ""So.. Mikoto Kamisato..  22.. born May 2nd... sound about right?"" 

I nodded as Terrence took out a ball point pen and scribbled down on a sheet of paper.  ""Okay. Now Just to make sure you're aware, this is a trial employment. You're pretty much subbing my vacancy till I get back from vacation. You'll be here with two other guys who'll show you the ropes. Shift's from 6 am to 6 pm Monday to Wednesday.  From what Lisa told me it shouldn't interfere with your classes right?"" 

""Yeeeaaah?"" I said, wondering when the typical interview questions were going to come up. 

""Alright."" He said, nodding. ""Just about covers it. Welcome to the Game Stop Family!"" 

""Wait hold on!"" I said. ""That's it? I'm in!? Just like that? No interview or-?"" 

""Look my vacay starts tomorrow, I don't have time to be picky."" said Terrence, his expression apologetic. ""That's what the trial shift is for. Consider the time till I come back the actual interview- to uh, see if you're a good fit for the job.  That is- if you're okay with it."" 

I sighed. Truth be told, I was going to accept the job regardless. It was a physical location that existed, and honestly I was tired of Ramen noodles every night. Nothing really screamed ""Red Flag"" at me. Just.. ""weird"" but not in a way that told me to run for my life really.  Worst case scenario, the games were either pirated or actually porn- which wouldn't make sense cause what do you think the internet was for? 

I tried for as polite a smile as I could and shrugged. ""I guess I'm okay with it."" 

Terrence smiled again, this time looking relieved. Considering that his vacation was tomorrow and I didn't see anyone else waiting in the wings for an interview, I guess I could understand.  ""Nice. Again, sorry about how abrupt everything is. Now, we just need to make some measurements for your uniform and- uh.. RIGHT big thing, can't forget this."" 

Terrence handed me a large manilla envelope. ""This might seem strange, heck you might even think its a joke- feel free to think its a stupid hazing ritual if you want-  but I need you to memorize this. Company policy."" 

I felt by brow furrow as I took the envelope tentatively. The paper felt.. warm to the touch, like it was generating its own heat. 

""We'll sign your temp contract tomorrow. But only if you can remember what's in there."" said Terrence. ""If you can't remember everything, then I'll have to cancel my vacay and you're out."" 

I gulped. Well this was one way to put on pressure. ""Wh-what is it?"" 

""Nothing too hard to memorize trust me."" said Terrence. ""Just take some time tonight to let it sink in, and as long as you know the important points you'll be good."" 

I drove back to my dorm that night feeling a mixture of emotions that I couldn't place. Nerves? Slight fear? Premonitions?  I don't know.  Either way, it was just strange enough to have me wondering what exactly I had gotten myself into and whether it was too late to get out. 

But each time these thoughts plagued my mind, the vision of dollars slipping into my wallet immediately stifled my misgivings. 

That night, I sat down on my bed and slid open the envelope. 

The paper inside was even warmer than the envelope itself, making me realize that this was the reason why the envelope had heated up in the first place. The paper felt like it had its own heat source. 

It didn't take long to see why. The spidery handwriting on the page was glowing like orange coals. The letters thin and neat and yet almost stick-like. Almost like I was looking at the glowing letters on the One Ring from Lord of the Rings, and yet there seemed to be a movement to it- as if the hand that took its time to transcribe the burning ink had long thin fingers that fluidly moved the quill that had been its instrument of communication. 

I nearly dropped the letter in shock as I looked the writing up and down, trying to find some sort of logical explanation for the burning ink.  After about a half hour of this, the letters began to hiss and cool, the orange glow dying down into smoke. 

Huh,  that was.. umm.. I honestly didn't know what to make of it, so I shook my head and began to read. 

  
""Greetings Mikoto, and welcome to the Game Stop E-21112 Location Family"" 

Weird, I don't think I ever saw them take the paper out and write my name in front of me.. the thing was pre-sealed- but Lisa did give Terrence my name before I got there so this is probably nothing. 

""While we hope your time working with us is an enjoyable experience, to keep it that way we do wish for you to observe some rules.  Take note that these rules are non-negotiable, and failure to observe them could result in termination by loss of life or existence.  These punishments are not handed out by the company, but in fact are simply consequences of your failure."" 

I stopped reading at this point.  This was either a really bad prank, or the start to some really generic Creepy Pasta.

I looked at the now ordinary ink, remembering how it had burned moments ago.  

  
Hmmm... was I stupid? Or was I smart? 

  
Taking a deep breath, I sighed and slipped the paper back in the envelope. I then picked up my phone and prepared to call the store and tell them that I had decided not to take the job.  I have no idea if I was being overly paranoid, but I had read enough scary stories with stupid desperate protagonists to not have the alarm bells ringing in my ears. 

But as soon as brought my phone out of sleep mode, the same spidery writing met my eyes on the screen.. plastered against my Evangelion screen saver like a burning sigil. 

""Rule #1: All employees must clock in before 6'oclock at least exactly a minute before 5:59 AM. Failure to do so will result in severe consequences."" 

I shut my phone and dropped it with a squeak. I breathed hard, and nearly jumped out my own window as my tv suddenly burst on in a chorus of static- displaying more burning words. 

""Rule #2: All game cases in the game aisle must remain closed at all times. Patrols of the game aisle must be carried out between the hours of 2 pm and 3 pm by at least two employees. At least 2 rounds must be made of each aisle in this section every 15 minutes. Should you find an open case, alert the manager. Do not alert the location Boss. Further instructions will be given depending on which case is open. ""

The TV clicked and immediately it switched to the next rule. Through my daze of fear and shock, the 'totally done with this shit' side of my brain reasoned that the rules were probably so important, they wanted to make sure I read them by any means necessary, even if I was deciding against my employment.  At least, that was the theory.

""Rule #4: -"" 

I gripped my head. My ears and mind throbbed. It was only now that I realized that the inner voice that I had been reading the rules in.. wasn't MY voice.. or at least not the voice I was used to reading things in my head with.  It was .. smooth.. far too well mannered, and held a suave accent to it I could only assume was british or something. 

  
"" - All games with Horror genre, Horror tropes, or anything related to Horror inspired themes whether brief or not, must be locked in the QUARANTINE aisle. Patrols of this area must be carried out between 3 pm to 5 pm  by at least two employees.  Rounds of any number must be made on all sections at least more than once, and cannot be carried out alone. Employees must always keep full sight of each other at all times.  Should any case be found open, alert the Location Boss immediately. If you find yourself unable to leave, emergency caches filled with specialized tools are at your disposal. Most subjects are vulnerable to generic firearms. Some subjects may require more specialty gear. 

  
""Rule #5: Employees may bring games from home for recreation during breaks. However, these games whether mobile or otherwise must be kept away from either Game Aisles at all times. Failure to do so will result in immediate termination. 



""Rule  #6:  Do not bring in food from the outside. Sustenance will be provided to you between the hours of 12pm and 1 pm. Food must be consumed within that period and all traces of crumbs, sauce or other commodities related to said food must be sterilized and removed. Failure to do so will result in possible severe consequences.   


""Rule #7:  This store is managed by the Location Boss. They are not to be disturbed unless there is an incident with an on location customer or an incident with the Quarantine Section.  If there is an attempted theft or a Quarantine incident, use the controls on the security monitor to alert the Location Boss. They will send security to deal with it. DO NOT BE PRESENT OUTSIDE THE STAFF ROOMS OR DESIGNATED SAFE ZONES WHILE SECURITY IS ON PREMISES."" 

When the voice spoke the all caps letters, it didn't change tone, but my head throbbed, almost as if the severity of the rule stated was being drilled into my mind. I flinched, and nearly fell to my knees.  

  
""Rule #8:  Though rare, occasionally we will have in person customers. Before the customers enter, a warning will be sent to your phone. If the warning lists the customer as ""E-21112"" you may greet them physically as you would in any other store. Please keep them away from the game aisles. They may only peruse areas specifically dubbed 'E-21112 SAFE'.  Should your phone read a different number, please follow the signs to the nearest designated SAFE ZONE or return to the Staff Room. If there is an E-21112 customer in the store, direct them to said SAFE ZONE as well or direct them to the Staff Room if more convenient. Each Safe Zone will be fully equipped with distractions for your customer until the 'All Clear' is broadcasted. ""

I had fully submitted to the weirdness by now. I was now slumped on my couch, glaring at the tv, holding up my middle finger to whatever entity was in my head. I was DEFINITELY not taking this stupid job now.   


"" Rule #9:  All first time Employees must go through a 2 week trial period to ensure that this job is in fact right for them. These employees may leave employment at any time should they feel unsafe or uncomfortable. However, it is recommended that you wait until after work hours have ended before leaving the store. Doing so could result in loss of life. First time employees who survive the 2 week trial period will recieve a 2000 dollar bonus and a raise of up to 500 dollars an hour should they seek full employment."" 

I froze.  No.... NO... NOT THIS TROPE.. The all too common Creepy Pasta trope of- 'but the pay was way too good'. My weakness.

  
\- ""We thank you for your decision to join us, and should you decide to seek employment elsewhere, we wish you the best of luck.

  
\-Signed,  Nia Elizabeth Crowley Tothep- Regional 21112 Location Boss. 

Terrence Klein-  Store Manager. 

Marcus Simmons-  Deputy Manager. ""



My TV flickered off.  For a moment I just sat there, staring, wondering if that had all just been a kooky dream. 

Then I realized something. I could recall every rule word for word. The shapes of the letters themselves seemed to resonate in my head, and try as I might, I couldn't seem to forget any of it. 

Just to check, I picked up the envelope from before and withdrew the paper, scanning the now normal looking ink. 

Sure enough the spidery handwriting held every word in my head exactly, all the way down to the signature from the Regional 21112 Location Boss- whatever that meant. 

The 2000 dollar bonus and the 50 dollar an hour permanent Employment raise seemed to hang in my mind for a moment, dancing before my eyes like a worm wiggling on a fish hook.   This couldn't be a good idea.  Nothing that was worth that much money could possibly be this easy. 

And yet, I could feel my desperation clouding my sense of judgement and survival.  The job situation was not good at the moment. 

  
So now you find me here... typing away on reddit, wondering if I even experienced what I just experienced. The letter from the store is sitting next to me. Its there. I can touch it, it exists. But somehow I'm not entirely convinced.   I'm planning on posting this later.. by then I'll decide on whether I'll take the job.  If anyone has any advice for situations like these, I'd appreciate it- I'm not sure if stuff like this happens elsewhere- or if I should legit just call the cops.  

  
\-Until next time,  

Micky. 



Update:  I decided to give it a try- wish me luck.
