Lorraine McLees gives us the inside skinny on creating art for the Halo universe, as **Sketch** chats with Bungie's resident Artist about the process involved in creating the Halo 2 cover for The Official Xbox Magazine.

**Sketch** : Have you worked on any magazine covers in the past? If so, what were they?

**Lorraine:** The last thing I worked on that made it to magazine covers was [Oni ](https://web.archive.org/web/20090204062435/http://www.bungie.net/News/%20http://oni.godgames.com/%20).I think the most notable one was an issue of Gamers Republic. There were a couple of others, in the US and the UK, but I can't remember them off the top of my head.



**Sketch** : How does creating a magazine cover differ from say, creating an ad or a box cover?

**Lorraine:** Not much different, really. It depends on whether or not I'm doing the entire box (front, back, flaps if any) or just the cover. In general, ads tend to be horizontal for a two-page spread but composed so it would be easy to crop for a single-page ad and still have room for logos, screenshots and text. Box covers are generally vertical. Of the three, box covers often have the most time allotted to them (unless I'm called on to fix one!)

I'm not sure how it works elsewhere, but in the case of the ad for *Halo* for the PC (which was later appropriated for the Mac version), the consensus was to show some giant epic battle on a recognizable map where the ring structure that is Halo would be visible. The going message was Halo invades the PC. The image in my head was pretty clear and after discussing with Andrew, the product manager for Halo for the PC and Pete, Bungies studio manager and former head of Xbox Marketing, the execution of this message was pretty much left up to me. Oh, and I was told I only had a few days, but they trusted Id be able to come up with something really cool. Sure. No sweat.

So I played the game, froze a scene, moved the camera, took a screenshot, rinsed, repeat. I did that until I got all the pieces to something close to what I wanted. Assembling the humongous file, I presented the visualization of my concept to Pete and Andrew, who said wow, so I said cool, then we all said variations of, wouldn't it be great if, then I started taking high-res screenshots armed with additional ideas and then assembled the layout I envisioned. The process took a whole darned week of late nights; coffee and making sure my son didn't roll off my desk until I was done. No problem.

The last box cover I was pretty much in charge of was Bungies [Myth: The Total Codex ](https://web.archive.org/web/20090204062435/http://www.bungie.net/News/%20http://www.bungie.net/perlbin/blam.pl?file=/site/3). I created the cover art, the whole box, in fact. The CD imprints, the manual, the ads, shelf talkers, even the set-up/installation interface graphics. The cover needed to portray three heroes; And they just needed to look heroic and be recognizable Myth characters. Sometimes box covers are easy that way.

In the case of the June 2003 OXM cover we wanted it to show the Chief in his new armor, and he basically just needed to look bad-ass. There were other elements we wanted to show: other Marines (in this case the ODSTs), a new environment (New Mombassa) and the Chief being able to use two guns at the same time (dual SMGs). And I just had to get it looking cool at the end of five days. And there we go. :)

Man, I want to go get some sleep, thinking about all those.

**Sketch** : In your mind, what are the most critical aspects to creating a ""successful"" cover?

**Lorraine:** Clarity. I should know what I'm looking at immediately, my eyes should be drawn to the main point(s) of interest and the message should be clear and, if at all possible, scream at me.

**Sketch** : What were your goals for this cover? Was there anything in particular that provided inspiration or direction?

**Lorraine:** With the OXM cover, we wanted to sort of continue where we left off with the announce trailer. We wanted to hint at what audiences would expect to see of Halo 2 at E3 2003. The Chief in his new armor. Two weapons, one on each hand. Hes on Earth. And hes fighting with the rest of the human race to fend off the Covenant. The general idea behind the whole thing was to say Holy -blam!-! It's the Chief in his new armor! Halo 2 is coming! He-he!

The announce trailer was a wonderful source of inspiration. You really get a sense of this bad-ass hero, a faceless, selfless soldier literally throwing himself into deaths maw to save the human race. Powerful and capable. I could only hope that my illustration did him justice.

  
**Sketch** : Can you walk us through the creation of the OXM cover?

**Lorraine:** When I'm illustrating something like this, I start with a bunch of thumbnails, basically unloading everything I can think of as fast as I can on a sheet of paper. I was a little hard pressed to come up with something that I hadn't already drawn before (particularly something that Oni's Konoko hadn't done before!). I was doodling on graph paper during that first phone conference with Holden Hume, OXM's art director. While we were talking, a picture of the Chief standing on top of a building popped into my head. He had a foot up on the edge and he was looking at the horizon behind the viewer. This idea emerged as just a mass of lines that showed limb positions, angles of objects in the sky (clouds or perspective of buildings) and an arrow that showed the direction the Chief would be looking. In my head, he was holding the Battle Rifle. But then as the conversation progressed, we wanted to see the Chief with the two SMGs, so I started drawing stick figures with two guns. We had leaning as a new feature, so I drew the Chief with two guns kind of leaning forward with guns ready. I didn't like it. After a few minutes, we got some specs, a sense of direction and a set of ideas to go on. And I also found out that I only had five days. Oh crap! I went to the drawing board and started sketching immediately!

That first image turned out to be the one that held the most promise. All the other poses failed to give a sense of hero or didn't provide a dynamic-enough pose. One shot, though, looked neat, was too close to a recent OXM cover with Sam Fisher of Splinter Cell.

  
To help me come up with poses more quickly, I started playing with the action figures at my desk. When I got the file of the proposed cover text, I started taking pictures of my [Stikfas ](https://web.archive.org/web/20090204062435/http://www.stikfas.com/)figures and dropping them in. Getting an idea of what might work, I grabbed more pictures and put them all on one file and printed them out so I could solicit feedback from Marcus and other artists like Robt and Shi Kai. After picking a couple, I printed out the poses and used that as the skeleton for the Chief. After a 13-hour Day 1, I drew up a pose we all liked and fired it off in e-mail so Holden could take a look at it in the morning.



Day two, I came in and loaded up Earth City on my dev kit and started flying around and started taking reference shots for the background. There were no textures to speak of, just geometry and lighting. The sky wasn't even finished. But all I needed were silhouettes of buildings anyway, so it was all good. We got the rest of the feedback that morning. I was happy to hear positive feedback, but there were a couple of requests that I wouldn't be able to implement until I get to the final run, so I forged ahead. I started throwing shadows onto the pencil sketch and started placing buildings into the picture. I then blocked in the other Marines behind the Chief. At the close of yet another long day, I had Robt render out two SMGs for me in the angle they would be shown and slapped it onto the Chief. I planned on painting right on top of the render from 3D Studio Max.

Needing sleep, I did some rudimentary brush strokes on the guns and I sent the last black and white rough for people to look at. I guess the OXM crew were also busy trying to put the rest of the magazine together because, just as I was wrapping up to go home, I got an e-mail back from Holden, saying that everybody left for the evening, but he really liked what he saw and that I should go ahead and start applying color. I just had enough time to start blocking in color before the day caught up with me.

Tired and feeling the effects of motion sickness from taking so many screenshots, I wanted nothing more than to get my 5-month-old son off my desk and head home to bed. I did find out later that Holden and the rest of the guys were really happy with what they saw and, even though it was just black and white, said that they can go with that cover if they really, really had to; that's how much they liked it.

For the next three days I would concentrate on coloring the Chief and getting the rest of the image close to finished. The file started ballooning to1 GB before I started paring down my file and getting rid of unused layers. 4am at the end of day five, I combine layers and get ready to send it all off. My memory of events is kinda hazy at this point. I don't even remember how I got the huge file over to OXM. I think Brian took care of it, but I can't recall much of that last day. But I do remember this: after having recuperated over the weekend, I forgot to sign the illustration. So the whole thing got printed with no artist signature. I slapped myself on the head. I couldn't believe it!

**Sketch** : How many different iterations did you work on before deciding on this particular image? Is the final image the one that you originally wanted to use?

**Lorraine:** There were only five other ideas for poses. There were two that we liked. But there was just no time to do a second one, so this final image was the one I took to the finish. And even so, I think I could have used another day or two to add some polish to it. About nine months later, the opportunity presented itself when a Halo 2 poster request came through the pipeline asking for the OXM cover as the image.



**Sketch** : What were some of the major challenges you had to overcome while working on this project?

**Lorraine:** The background. I didn't have enough time to experiment with it.

**Sketch** :Approximately how much time would you estimate that it took to create the finished cover?

**Lorraine:** Probably about 80 hours from the time I got the project to when I saved it and called it done.

**Sketch** : How does it feel knowing that your Halo 2 cover has gone on to become the most popular and largest selling issue in the history of OXM?

**Lorraine:** I feel pretty lucky. I honestly think that if the drawing was of somebody else and not the hero of Halo 2, I don't think it would have done as well.

1o67wzo,https://www.reddit.com/r/onenation/comments/1o67wzo/meaning_of_life/,meaning of life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

if you want to see Actual Purpose of human life then see this link : ( triple w ( d . o . t ) asitis ( d . o . t ) c . o . m  {Bookmark it })

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",1,1760422772.0,onenation,0,1.0,False
1o67ve3,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1o67ve3/when_the_rain_fell_sideways/,When the Rain Fell Sideways,"
It was one of those nights where the rain didn’t fall—it attacked.
Sideways sheets of water blurred everything into watercolor chaos.

Ethan stood under a half-broken bus shelter in downtown Seattle, pretending the plastic roof was doing something. It wasn’t. The bus app said Delayed for the third time. His phone battery hovered at 3%. His mood—worse.

Then she appeared.

Running across the street, soaked, clutching a paper bag to her chest like it carried treasure. She stopped under the same shelter, hair dripping, cheeks flushed. Her coat was useless.

“Seattle weather’s dramatic tonight,” she said, laughing.

He smiled despite himself. “Yeah. Feels personal.”

They stood side by side, the kind of silence that isn’t awkward yet. The rain filled it nicely.

“I’m Emma,” she said, finally.
“Ethan.”

He noticed the bag—an old-school record sleeve poking out.
“You collect vinyl?”
She grinned. “Yeah. I rescue them, actually. From people who think Spotify is enough.”

He laughed, and just like that, the world felt less soggy.

The bus never came. Neither of them minded.

They ended up walking to a coffee shop two blocks away—some dim, indie place still open because its owner refused to close for “mere weather.”
They shared a booth, coffee steaming between them, swapping stories about cities they hated leaving and people they’d never say goodbye to properly.

By the time the rain slowed, it was 1:00 a.m. He offered to walk her home. She refused, said she lived close.

At the door she smiled, tugged her damp hoodie tighter. “Thanks for not being weird.”
“Thanks for assuming I could’ve been.”

She laughed, stepped backward into the mist.
“Maybe I’ll see you when it rains again.”

He watched her disappear around the corner. He didn’t even get her last name.

Days passed. Then weeks.

Ethan went back to the same stop every evening. Some nights he brought coffee for two. He even checked every record store in the neighborhood. No Emma.

Seattle gave him everything—fog, traffic, rent hikes—but not her.

Eventually he stopped waiting. Mostly.

Three months later, while grabbing a late latte, he heard that same laugh behind him.
He turned.
Different girl. Different laugh.
Just a sound the universe recycled to keep him guessing.

He smiled anyway, told himself it was time to move on.

Then he noticed the café’s turntable spinning a record—its label smudged but familiar. The barista had scrawled a note on the jacket taped to the wall:

“Donated by Emma W., who said rain makes people honest.”

He stood there longer than he should’ve, coffee cooling in his hand.

Outside, drizzle returned—gentle, steady, Seattle-honest.

He didn’t chase ghosts anymore. But every time it rained, he’d still glance toward the street corner… just in case a girl with a record sleeve and that laugh decided the weather was finally worth remembering.",1,1760422607.0,stories,0,1.0,False

# A beginner's guide to filling your house with awesome expensive gadgets in the pursuit of Halo perfection.

**Surround Yourself With Victory!**

One of the coolest, yet most underutilized features of the Xbox generally, and Halo in particular, is its use of Dolby 5.1 digital surround sound. What does that mean to you, the gamer? A lot, if you have the equipment.

Dolby 5.1 surround sound basically splits the game audio into five digital channels of surround, plus the "".1"" bass effects of an accompanying Subwoofer. That means that audio can be sent to any of the five speakers center, front left and right and rear left and right. In movies this makes for cool effects like a spaceship sweeping by and around you. In Halo, it's actually gameplay. If a Covenant soldier is behind you, he'll sound like he's behind you you can use the audio to improve your performance in the game.

That becomes especially important in multiplayer games when the radar is turned off you can actually hear the direction of approaching footsteps or vehicles and plan your tactics to suit. An explosion directly ""behind"" you means it's time to get moving, even the rattle of falling shale and debris can be a useful clue.

Marty O'Donnell, Bungie's in-house maestro reminds us that one of the first sounds you hear in Halo is Dolby 5.1, ""That shield charger is real 5.1, it's processed to literally spin around your head as it charges and depletes the shield. It's probably the first in-game surround sound most Xbox owners heard.""

Of course, you need some equipment to get this working. For one thing, in order to get a digital audio connection, you must have either an Advanced AV Pack or a High Definition AV Pack both of which have a digital optical connection built-in. And it goes without saying that you will need a Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound system and these can come in a number of shapes and sizes.

The most common, practical and easy to use is one of those Home Theater In a Box deals that you'll find stacked at your local electronics store. For about $300 you can get a pretty decent system with six speakers (including the subwoofer) and a digital surround processor. That should give you sharp sound, lots of bass and plenty of options, like an FM tuner, support for other formats (like DTS) and more. Spend a little more, you'll get either more power or perhaps a built-in DVD player.

If you want to get really fancy, you could take a look at a pair of Dolby 5.1 headphones, which use some aural trickery to produce surround sound from a pair of cans and in the case of the infra red wireless Pioneer SE-XB1 phones, they do an amazingly convincing job, without shaking the drywall off the TV room. They may however blast some of the loose gray matter out of your brainpan.

*It costs around $450 and is hard to come by, but nothing says hardcore like this Pioneer SE-XB1 wireless surround headphone setup.*

And staying with the Xbox branded theme, a speaker company named Spherex has created a sub-$500 home theater system designed specifically with Xbox in mind although it does have some muscle to back up its aesthetic appeal. The most interesting feature in the Spherex Xbox 5.1 setup is its use of Omnipolar technology for speakers that spread the sound in all directions, as opposed to conventional speakers which simply ""fire"" sound in the direction they're pointed. The result, according to Spherex is ""a deep wide and tall soundstage.""

We actually use these speakers here in the office, and can vouch for their clarity. The sound does seem more natural and lifelike. The fancyness extends to the electronics as well as the actual speakers. Located in a small box, the processor has upgradeable firmware and a USB port, so you can not only use your PC to customize your setup, you can upgrade to new features as they become available.

*Spherex has built a system that's either sexy or frightening, depending on your sensibilities.*

**Rez up for Rezults**

Halo supports two resolutions 480i, which is your regular vanilla TV resolution, and 480p which in spite of the numbering, is basically twice as sharp as 480i. The ""i"" stands for ""interlaced"" which describes the fact that old school TVs only draw every other line simultaneously, at about 30 frames per second. Your brain simply blends the two alternating pictures together for a smooth, convincing image. In a 480p display, ""p"" stands for ""progressive"" as in ""Progressive Scan."" Almost all HDTVs and PC monitors can handle this display format, which draws every line simultaneously. The result is a much sharper image, with a great deal more detail and clarity.

These resolutions for the most part apply to the North American NTSC TV system other countries use incompatible standards like Pal, and SECAM and since most of Europe doesn't have HDTV yet, this part of the article kinda skips 'em. Sorry!

In Halo, a 480p picture isn't just a cosmetic boost it can be a big gameplay advantage, especially for snipers. You can simply see more detail, and pick out players who might otherwise be hidden in a combination of blurry 480i display and in-game camouflage. Of course, the enhanced definition can make you a victim as well as a victor. Even better, split-screen games become much less of an ordeal, since each player gets more detail.

There are a couple of things you'll need (aside from an Xbox and Halo of course) to enjoy 480p resolution and a couple of options to consider. The most straightforward is a combination of an HDTV or EDTV television set and an Xbox High Definition AV Pack. The former are two types of TV capable of displaying 480p and the latter lets you connect directly to your TV's component video inputs just make sure to enable 480p in the video section of your Xbox dashboard.

The next big problem is buying an HDTV. There are so many competing technologies and acronyms, you might lose your mind trying to juggle it all. In our research (and for research, read, ""asking dude in next cubicle""), the biggest confusion seems to be the difference between HDTV and EDTV. As far as we're concerned, EDTV is NOT the way to go, since you can't really use it to watch HDTV programs (although it's fine for 480p gaming). Don't worry too much about having a tuner built-in, since most HDTV signals will come from an external box like a Satellite tuner or cable box. Built-in HD tuners only give you access to broadcast signals. And in just how much hi-res can you take Leno's chin?

Now, HDTVs and monitors can support other high resolutions, including 720p, 1080i and even 1080p. Halo however, will only function in 480i and 480p modes.

*Samsung's DLP projection sets are among the best in terms of value and quality.*

You also want to make sure that your TV has plenty of inputs for your console and more. Component video is used for most HD applications, including your Xbox, but you will also want DVI, since most future devices will use this superior digital connector, and maybe even HDMI which is compatible with DVI but can also handle digital audio. So what you really want to wait for is a TV with DVI, HDMI and Component Video Inputs. Confused? You should be. All this mess is caused by multiple companies with competing standards.

And then there's screen technology. Basically CRT screens still have the best overall image quality, but they're heavy and limited in size. LCD projection screen TVs offer the most real estate for the dollar ($2000 will get you a huge quality set) while Plasma and LCD flat screens are both at the higher end of the price scale, but dropping rapidly. In about two years, you'll be able to pick up a 42 inch Plasma for less than $1000 is our guess.

There is another, more unorthodox, but considerably cheaper option, in the shape of a VGA adapter. A few companies, including Neoya ([http://www.x2vga.com/](http://www.x2vga.com/)) with its X2VGA device, let you plug your Xbox into a PC monitor for near identical 480p results. Since most people already have a VGA monitor at home, it's a pretty cheap solution coming in at around $70 for the adapter which like the High Definition AV Pack, also lets you attach surround sound via an optical or ""SPIDF"" connector. One downside is that VGA monitors usually cannot display 480i so your dashboard will look like ass, clearing up only once the game loads. The X2VGA has a filter of sorts that makes the dashboard visible, if ugly, and dip switches for customizing the output. It also supports 720p and 1080i resolutions.

*The Neoya X2VGA lets you plug your Xbox into a VGA monitor for HDTV thrills without the associated expense.*

**Postural Posterior Gluteal Recumbinator**

Or chair, as we like to call it. LaZboy could be the only way to go, especially now they make recliners in Sci-Fi and animal patterns that may or may not horrify your significant other. And if you leave a coffee stain ring on the arm rest, you can always claim it's the afterglow of the destroyed Halo

**GLOSSARY:**

**EDTV** \- Enhanced Definition Television (limited to 480p but fine for Halo)

**HDTV** \- High Definition Television (usually supports 480p, 720p or 1080i or all three)

**Dolby 5.1 Surround** \- A digitally encoded sound that splits an audio signal into five speaker channels and a bass channel.

**Subwoofer** \- Big giant box that makes room go boom.

**VGA** \- Video Graphics Array (basically a PC monitor)

**DVI** \- Digital Visual Interface (lets you get a high def purely digital signal into your monitor or TV)

**HDCP** \- High bandwidth Digital Content Protection (Basically an anti-piracy measure, but you might need it so you can watch unscrambled movies in the future)",1,1760422535.0,u_TyLandcan,0,1.0,False

Some questions about moka pots (Bialetti & accessories):

1. Does an E&B Lab 3T filter fit perfectly into a 2-cup Bialetti moka pot?

If it does, is it actually worth spending extra on the E&B filter, or is it more of a gimmick?



2. Any coffee bean recommendations for moka brewing? Or at least what roast profile tends to bring out the best flavor?


3. Lastly, for Bialetti Brikka users, any not-so-obvious tips or tricks to get the most consistent brew?

1o67sur,https://i.redd.it/09c09sqhr0vf1.jpeg,"South Manchaca, Music Village, and Stinson Trail","Hi yall. I’ve seen some post with some misconceptions about what all is happening on South Manchaca and I though I’d take a moment to set the record straight. My name is J.R.Stinson and I’m a looong time South Austinite and a full-time Bubba. I’m the local land developer who has been focused on preserving South Manchaca Road for most of my life.

Before I start I’d like to share a bit of background on my family’s connection to South Austin. My family patriarchs settled on farmland that is now Peter Pan Golf all the way Tinnin Ford Road including Travis Heights and Bouldin back in 1850 and 1851. Another branch of my family settled Davis Lane in the 1840’s. My great Aunt, Mollie Dawson, was one of Austin’s first female teachers and later developed many areas of what is now Bouldin. More recently we all grew up on a cattle farm on Manchaca at Davis Lane. All that land is long gone, but we still remain on Manchaca Road, hence my love and connection for  South Austin.

In 2019 my business partner came to me and asked if I had a passion project that I would like to see through realization. He said it could be anything that really cared about. I told him that I had always wanted to preserve South Manchaca from becoming overran with dull boring whitewashed apartments and national restaurant chains. As many of you know this area was never annexed into the city limits which attracted many entertainment venues. The only problem was it was not very walkable and is next to a 55 MPH highway. Unfortunately the area has experienced a lot of pedestrian fatalities over the years due to the lack of sidewalks. 

Through many restless nights of studying the area maps I realized that most of the lots surrounding Moontower Saloon had a back line that almost made a perfect line. Could this back line become a pedestrian trail tucked safe away from the speeding cars? It would take us many years to find out. So in 2020 we began purchasing as much land in the area just south of Slaughter Lane as we could get in an effort to connect up the proposed trail path. 

The area currently is home to Sam’s Town Point, Armadillo Den, Moontower Saloon, Bouldin Acres South, MSB, Reset Bar, Lulu’s, Bohdi’s Hideout, The Hive, Drifter’s Social, Pickle Hub, and SABG. I hear that Cosmic Coffee, Rush Racket Sports, and a lit par 3 golf attraction are soon to open in the area as well. The energy is gathering for sure. 

We met with County Comissioners and City Council members in an effort to figure this out. The only problem was that County development code really didn’t offer a way to create a contiguous and useful place for a safe pedestrian passage anytime in the near future. So we got busy with neighbors to buy or borrow their back line to make a proposed .9 mile walking trail that could connect land on Slaughter lane near Sam’s all the way down to the Slaughter Creek trail system. Most neighbors were delighted to contribute land, while others have been less interested in the idea. All in all we only have a few small sections that have held out, but we are hopeful that the land owners will join our efforts soon. 

In November of 2024 I filed a petition to remove the area by election from the Austin ETJ, a move that would allow for simpler funding and permitting timelines for the trail development. The area still has the same environmental water quality standards that it had before, same impervious cover limits, and we have all voluntarily decided to dedicate any previously protected live oaks trees into permanent protection through deed restrictions. This was really important to me because I’m a tree hugger and nature enthusiast, some might better describe me as a cowboy hippie, but regardless TREES MATTER!

The area really doesn’t have an official name, but due to the amount of venues in the area it has been proposed that we adopt Music Village as the new namesake. 

As we enter into 2026 I will be building and opening the first section of the trail from Slaughter creek to Lynnbrook Drive. Currently we are self funding the segments of the project but would love it if some local philanthropist or businesses might want to partner with us on this effort. The trail will also feature space for farmers market and vintage trading booths plus  more area parking. I plan to add community chess tables along the trail as well. At the south end of the trails proposed path it will terminate into the Slaughter Creek trail system, which COA has proposed to expand to connect to East Austin trail systems and westward to the Violet Crown Trail. Due to the coming sports attractions we hope to become an outdoors recreational destination. 

My hope is that this area will be preserved from big development for many more generations to come and that it will become a hub for community connection for all Austinites. 

I have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in effort to engineer and create the trail, and will be donating over two acres of land to see this effort through. Selfishly I plan to name the trail sections that I am donating after my late father, Ned Stinson, a lifelong public educator who taught drivers education at Crockett High School until his death in 1991. He cared a lot about public safety and building community in South Austin.

So the next time you pass by the Stinson Trail sign on South Manchaca don’t wonder if this is some dickhead trying to Vegas your South Austin. We are just trying to raise awareness that this area needs critical infrastructure and also trying to promote locally owned businesses that can stave off big development for many more decades to come. Someone recently told me that “South Austin is all of the real Austin that we have left”, and it made me tear up a bit…. But then I went to Sam’s where I danced and smiled all night long. 

So I welcome your comments and criticism  here publicly and privately. I realize this isn’t every person’s  ideal outcome for the area. You won’t hurt my feelings. I welcome new ideas that could enhance this all. I welcome your assistance if you’d like to help my efforts somehow. Please feel free to reach out anytime neighbor.

Hey everyone,

I’m looking to team up with someone in the Mesa area who’s either growing their construction business or has a steady flow of small projects and could use a reliable, skilled right-hand guy.

I’ve got solid hands-on experience, a strong work ethic, and the mindset to help build something from the ground up. Whether it’s residential remodels, light commercial, punch lists, or weekend warrior projects, I’m ready to show up, get things done, and contribute to the bigger picture.

Ideally, I’m looking for a partnership-type situation — not just a short-term gig. If you’re building a company and could use someone dependable to help make it happen, or if you want to tag team jobs and split the load, let’s talk.

Shoot me a message if you're interested or want to meet up and chat over coffee or on-site.

Thanks,
John

With golden beaches, mountain views, and charming local markets, Nelson has something for every kind of traveller.

While you can walk around the city centre, the best way to experience everything Nelson and its surroundings have to offer is by renting a car. **A** [Car Rental in Nelson](https://zoomrentalcars.co.nz/) **gives you the freedom to travel anywhere, anytime, and truly enjoy the journey at your own pace.**

https://preview.redd.it/1e4n2414o0vf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf0888d9f4245ba5823e903a7a725d06b3fd584b

**Why Rent a Car in Nelson?**

Nelson is surrounded by stunning natural attractions that are often hard to reach by bus or taxi. Renting a car makes travel easier, faster, and far more enjoyable.

Here are a few reasons why car rental is the smartest choice for visitors and locals alike:

1. **Freedom to Explore:** You can plan your own route, stop for photos, and take detours to small towns or beaches that public transport doesn’t reach.  
2. **Comfort and Privacy:** No need to follow crowded tour groups or wait for bus schedules — just drive when you’re ready.  
3. **Affordable for Groups:** If you’re travelling with family or friends, renting a car is often cheaper than buying multiple bus or taxi tickets.  
4. **Flexible Drop-offs:** Many rental companies in Nelson let you drop off the car in other cities like Christchurch or Wellington, which is perfect for long road trips.  

**What You Get with a Nelson Car Rental**

Most car rental services in Nelson offer a range of vehicles to suit different needs and budgets. Whether you’re a solo traveller, a couple, or a large family, there’s something for everyone.

Common vehicle types include:

* **Economy cars** for budget travellers  
* **Compact and intermediate cars** for city drives  
* **SUVs and people movers** for larger groups or longer road trips  

Typical inclusions and services:

* Unlimited kilometres so you can drive freely  
* Basic insurance cover (with an option to reduce excess)  
* Roadside assistance  
* Optional extras like GPS, baby seats, and roof racks  

Nelson’s rental companies are known for being friendly, transparent, and professional. One example is [Zoom Rental Cars Nelson](https://zoomrentalcars.co.nz/), a locally owned company offering clean, reliable vehicles and excellent customer support.

**Top Places to Visit by Car in Nelson**

Once you have your rental car, there are so many amazing destinations you can reach easily. Here are some must-see spots:

https://preview.redd.it/17nzv0lzo0vf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=76a30b78cca64b1483b8cd29b2ebe17230333bae

* **Abel Tasman National Park:** About an hour’s drive from Nelson, this park is world-famous for its golden beaches, coastal tracks, and kayaking adventures.  
* **Kaiteriteri Beach:** A family-friendly beach known for its calm waters and bright sunshine — ideal for swimming and relaxation.  
* **Nelson Lakes National Park:** If you love nature, don’t miss this beautiful area filled with hiking trails, mountain views, and peaceful lakes.  
* **Mapua Wharf:** A short drive from the city, Mapua is a creative coastal village with cafes, galleries, and local shops.  
* **Motueka and Takaka:** Both towns are full of friendly locals, craft stores, and delicious food — perfect for day trips.  

Having a car lets you enjoy these locations without worrying about limited bus schedules or expensive taxi rides.

**Important Things to Know Before You Rent**

Before you rent a car in Nelson, here are a few simple but important things to keep in mind:

1. **Driver’s Licence:** You must hold a full, valid driver’s licence in English. If it’s not in English, you’ll need an official translation or an International Driving Permit.  
2. **Age Requirement:** Most companies require drivers to be at least 21 years old. Some may charge extra for drivers under 25.  
3. **Insurance and Excess:** All rentals include basic insurance, but you can pay a little more each day to lower the excess (the amount you pay if there’s damage).  
4. **Payment and Bond:** A credit card is usually needed. If you don’t have one, the company may ask for a refundable cash bond.  
5. **Fuel Policy:** Most rentals operate on a “full to full” policy — return the car with a full tank to avoid extra charges.  
6. **After-Hours Pickups:** If you’re arriving late, check if the company offers after-hours service (some do for a small fee).  

**Driving Tips for Visitors**

Driving in New Zealand is safe and easy once you know the basics:

* Drive on the **left-hand side** of the road.  
* Always **wear seatbelts** — it’s required by law.  
* Speed limits are usually **50 km/h in towns** and **100 km/h on highways**.  
* Keep your phone off while driving; use hands-free if needed.  
* Plan your routes in advance, especially if heading into rural or mountain areas with limited signal.  

Remember, the roads in Nelson and surrounding areas are scenic but can be narrow and winding — take your time and enjoy the drive.

**Why Choose a Local Company**

Supporting a **locally owned rental company** in Nelson, like Zoom Rental Cars, not only gives you better service but also helps the community. Local operators often provide more flexible terms, personal attention, and local travel advice that big international chains can’t match.

Many local rental firms offer:

* Affordable daily rates  
* No hidden costs  
* Free pick-up and drop-off at Nelson Airport  
* Friendly customer support  
* Clean, well-maintained vehicles  

Choosing local also means your money stays within the region — supporting jobs and local tourism growth.

**Best Time to Rent a Car in Nelson**

The summer months (December to February) are the busiest time in Nelson, thanks to warm weather and school holidays. If you’re visiting during this period, it’s wise to [book your rental car](https://web.rentalcarmanager.com/API32/zoom-car-rentals/) **early** to get the best rates and vehicle choice.

In the cooler months (May to September), you’ll find lower prices and quieter roads, making it a great time for a relaxed scenic drive.

**Experience Nelson Your Way**

From the sunny beaches of Tahunanui to the craft markets of the city centre, Nelson is a destination full of color and creativity. Whether you’re planning a short stay or a long road trip, **renting a car gives you complete freedom to explore every corner of this amazing region**.

With your own vehicle, you can follow your curiosity — stop for a coffee at a roadside café, pull over for photos of the mountains, or take a spontaneous detour to a hidden beach. It’s all part of the experience.

So next time you visit Nelson, skip the waiting and the schedules. **Rent a car, hit the open road, and discover the beauty of Nelson at your own pace.**

Don’t bother looking me up. You’ll never find my channel. That niche is overstated and I don’t have many subscribers. I’m pretty much invisible to search engines.

One of my videos kind of blew up though. (That is, if you consider a thousand views ‘blowing up’.) It was a video where I left two peanut butter jelly sandwiches sitting on a plate in the woods behind my backyard. My camera captured a cute raccoon holding a sandwich the way a human would and nibbling at the crust. The comments were full of Facebook moms spamming heart emojis.

I figured I finally found my audience. So, two nights ago, I left ten sandwiches in the same spot, in between two trees, in the hopes that the cute raccoon would return to milk views.

What I instead captured, though, left me puzzled and disturbed…

I started the morning as I always do, with a cup of Joe and a grounding walk along the trail to retrieve my camera. All ten sandwiches were gone when I arrived. Not even a crumb was left behind. I took that as a good sign and returned home in a good mood, picturing the YouTube play button I’d surely receive for all the subscribers I’d surely gain.

I sank into my peeled leather sofa and inserted the SD card into the laptop on my coffee table. Cracking my knuckles and rubbing my calloused hands, I pressed play and leaned back. I kicked my feet up and wiggled my liberated toes. Soon I’d be doing the same on a cocobolo desk with maids feeding me grapes…

Or so I thought until I spotted a fat ugly raccoon entering the frame. The thing waddled and stopped every few seconds to catch its breath. I tried shooing it away as if the tape wasn’t pre-recorded, but the little fucker eventually reached the plate and grabbed the thickest sandwich. This, of course, infuriated me.

I fast-forwarded and sighed as I saw raccoon Case-oh had cleared the plate all by itself.

I was about to close the tab, defeated, when shifting shrubs in the top left corner caught my attention. Out came the cute raccoon! Maybe the clip was salvageable after all. I could title the video “Sad baby raccoon misses out on a meal.”

My thoughts got interrupted by a humanoid figure entering the frame. He had a burly bedraggled build, and he held a rifle in his arms. The baby raccoon fled a little too late. A gunshot rang, and a bullet tore through its grey fur, out of which sprayed blood and guts.

The man grabbed the raccoon and turned around, holding it up to the camera. His smile… it stretched wider than any I’ve ever seen. He winked and simply wandered away, and that’s where the footage ended.",1,1760421664.0,shortscarystories,0,1.0,False

Let’s talk about something that's been on my mind lately: **Rethinking retirement**. I mean, we’ve all been told that turning 50 is basically the end of the road, right? But honestly, isn’t it just the beginning of a wild and fulfilling journey? 🎉

**Picture this**: You wake up one day, grab your coffee, and think, “What’s next?” Suddenly, you’re deciding between two seemingly opposite paths: picking up a pickleball paddle or discovering a new passion that sets your soul on fire. 😄 

Let’s break it down a bit. 

### **The Pickleball Obsession: A Fun Way to Stay Fit**
- **Addiction Level**: Low-key obsessed! Between the lighter paddles and the ease of play, you can enjoy hours without even noticing time flying. 
- **Social Connection**: Nothing beats rallying with neighbors and friends; it’s like a workout and a social hour rolled into one.
- **Cognitive Sharpness**: Who knew you had to think strategically while running around? It’s a serious brain and body workout!
  
### **Finding Your Purpose: The Life Sauce**
- **Passion Projects**: Whether it’s painting, volunteering, or starting a blog about your travel adventures, doing what you love can reignite that youthful spark inside you.
- **Meaningful Connections**: Meeting folks who share your passion is like discovering your favorite flavor of ice cream—you just get it! 🍦
- **Legacy Vibes**: What do you want to be remembered for? Leaving a positive mark can be the sweetest motivator of all.

So here’s the kicker: **Which keeps you younger after 50—pickleball or finding your purpose?** 🤔

Honestly, there’s no right answer! It could be a mix of both! The trick might just be in the balance. Who doesn’t love shooting hoops and painting sunsets after a good round of pickleball? 🙌

And for those who are wondering, **we believe in the strongest people**. That’s why I want to share this link—it’ll help you tap into resources and connect with others on similar journeys. Check it out here: [Explore Your Potential](https://mavely.app.link/e/TuANm4vQCSb). 

Just a quick heads up: there may be some affiliate links in there, but I’m all about sharing what I find helpful!

Then we take a long walk around the area, eat at a restaurant, talk in a coffee shop, etc. and exchange numbers.

You’re so unlikeable that me losing my temper at you pissing away the resources in freezing for has made me more money on a GFM in one day than yours had. People have been flooding me with kindness when I was so afraid to even share for months I was homeless because lowkey embarrassed and worried I’d be talked to the same way. And I wasn’t. Everybody has been so kind. Even when I’m on social media on the necks of people who I feel committed terrible crimes. 

This is my first birthday this year free and I spent the first 4/5ths of it crying alone because I thought wow I’m homeless nobody will like me or want to be around me. And by the end of the night I was apologizing to people because too many had baked me cakes themselves or grabbed me sweets that day. A woman I befriended just because we chatted about makeup while she worked at target baked me a cake. 

You sit here and whine and cry about how the world is against you and that’s why you’re alone. You blame the world for the way the world talks to you. And you blame social media for everything in your life. And yet? Everything I feared I’d become homeless because of what i saw happened to you isn’t even remotely true. Before I worked the system and then fell into it, I could’ve been fooled. I was fooled by the crying over beauty standards video a few years ago. You can still get pity. But what you can’t do it make a fckn friend in the world. 

It’s YOU. People aren’t mean to me for my situation for the most part. People offer me special job interviews and warm cups of coffee places I go. And people DO try to chat you left and right. It’s the way you spoke to the shelter worker supporting you. It’s the way you speak to your audience. It’s the way YOU interact with the world that results in the way you experience it. 

I just want to say, if anyone else here in this thread is also unhoused, I was scared to share my journey too. But the truth is that it’s her. It’s how she treats the world. And if you’re kind and honest, friends and warmth are sure to follow. Tophia, I don’t know how to word it any other way. You’ll always be alone and it’s the way you’re choosing to interact with people. You’re crass, you’re rude, you’re over bearing, and you have no empathy for others. When you reflect on suing people or blaming others for your shortcomings, remember all of the women in the shelter around you who get help before you and understand it’s about effort and grace. I truly hope you felt alone sitting all alone at the bowling place after coercing a dv victim to speak to you again with TYLENOL.

**AITA for telling my dads wife I don’t care that she has cancer and thinking she’s lying?**



A/N I just want to say that I have no ill will towards this women BECAUSE she married my dad. I’m up in arms about it because I feel like she’s manipulating my dad. All the comments about me thinking she’s an “evil step mother” and that I have an issue with her bc she married my dad, just isn’t true.

My parents getting a divorce was one of the best thing they ever did for me. Thinking of them being together with their differences and having heard them argue towards the end of the relationship i would not have benefited as a child if they had stayed together. I always liked my moms boyfriends (except one guy that hurt her feelings pretty bad), and I LOVED my dads second wife. I never ever minded that my parents dated and saw other people.

That being said: my only problem with Francine is I believe she is manipulating all of us. That maybe she’s sick in her head. I made this post more to make sure that I wasn’t fully insane and that her behavior is sus. I don’t like her not because she’s married to my dad but because her personality makes it hard to even be friendly.

And none of this is about the insurance. She holds it over our heads and threatened to take myself my siblings and my dad off it.

Sorry this is long, and trigger warning for self harm, cancer, ED, and major loss.

For context, my dad 65 M, has been married 3 times. Me, 26 F, and my siblings: Leo 23 M, and Vanessa 24 F, come from his first marriage. When I was 21, he married his 3rd wife, Francine 65 F. Over the years of their marriage until this year I always thought Francine was strange. Little things like not allowing our step-sister, Hanna 18 F, drink juice or make comments about how much she was eating when she was 12/13. Later I found out Hanna was struggling as a teenager with self harm and an ED. Francine never showed much interest in myself, Vanessa, or Leo. Which was fine with us since we were adults by the time she came into our lives. She was at birthdays, Christmas, thanksgiving, but never really gave anything more than a joint gift with our father. Would leave early from theater productions we participated in, never made it to rugby games, and only ever asked us when we are going to have children and get married and it was all she cared about.

Francine always had “health problems”, she always over reacted to our perfume, shampoo, or the smell of cigarettes on our clothes (my mom and grandmother who had primary care of us were smokers). So since they were married me and my siblings barely ever saw my dad in case we sent Francine into some kind of allergy shock. Her allergies were different every time we see her: corn syrup, red dye number 5, yogurt, peanuts, the list goes on. Things I’ll see her eating next time I see her.

Fast forward to this past year, 2022. Francine was “diagnosed” with stage 4 lung cancer in April and was given a year to live. My siblings and I made sure we supported our distraught father who was very upset and taking the news very hard. Later that year in December, my grandmother was also diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. For further context, I was grandmas favorite, her first grandkid, we shared a bedroom for most of my life, she would babysit me when my mom needed a break, and I love to say that my grandma was my first love. The person I learned to love before I even understood how to love my parents. She meant so much to me, and she progressively and very quickly got sicker and weaker. I took a leave of absence from work to help my mom care for her on hospice until she passed away in early February 2023, and I took the loss very very hard. I was in therapy twice a week and was almost admitted to the hospital for relapsing on self harm behaviors.

The weeks after she passed, my family and I were all trying to get our lives together without our main support system. My sister went on medication for her mental health, my brother fought to get a promotion at work, and I had turned 26 that January 2023 started mapping out my future with my long term boyfriend including what to do about health insurance at the end of the year when I was no longer covered by Francine’s plan.

Here’s where I might be an asshole. I texted Francine asking if there was a date I was going to be taken off so I could cement my plans so I was covered. She sent me a three paragraph essay about how she had cancer and the only time I ever texted her was because I needed something. I told her that was true because, and I quote, “let’s face it, you are as interested in me as I am in you. YOU never reach out when my grandmother died , knowing full well my relationship with her, or when my other grandmother passed away early 2022. You never ask me about anything in my life, don’t even know I’m coming up on my graduation date for nursing school, or know how I’m doing in general. How dare you come at me when you haven’t even checked yourself. Be an adult and admit we aren’t even friends let alone family. The phone works two ways and if you wanted to have a relationship with me that bad you should have tried when I was 21.”

In private I told my siblings, my mother, friends, and boyfriend that I think she is lying about having cancer. A thought first stated by my mother and later my boyfriend in two separate conversations. She claims to be allergic to the chemo, and is doing coffee enemas and juice cleanses she claims are helping her cancer. She claims she got surgery but I see no scar. Not only that, but she was diagnosed with the same thing my grandmother was and over a year later, Francine does not look sick and even took a month long trip to upstate New York and Canada with my father in August 2023. She had sent us a photo of her and my father and she looks and is acting completely healthy. I asked my siblings honestly if they think she has cancer and Leo agreed it’s fishy and Vanessa wouldn’t answer either way asking why would our dad lie to us. I pointed out that dad seems like he never goes to the doctors appointments with Francine and just tells us what she says and when asked further question he says he doesn’t know or sighs and shakes his head.

In recent events, Hana has apologized to me for her mothers behavior saying that she has no idea what her mothers issues are. Francine is currently trying to get my father and Hana to move to upstate New York, where she stayed with family since their trip, because the “air is healthier for her healing process”. My father and Hana blatantly said they will not go.

AITA?

There is so much more but can’t think of it all. Fell free to ask questions so I can fill any holes.

*You should be able to call the number on your insurance card and get the info you need, or dad can get it for you. She sounds like a manipulator with major issues.*

>OOP: Not sure if it’s the same with every state but I did try that and they needed her to call bc I’m not the holder. She did follow up with the rude message with a date for me I just had to read a bunch of bullshit before I got to my answer LOL

>Also want to add this story as well: Our first thanksgiving together Francine left in a rage bc she made us go around the table and say what we were thankful for. My brother said “that I live in a safe place” and my sister said “for my family”. I said “for my friends”. Francine took that as a jab at her and left saying “well I guess I’m not welcomed here”, and “I guess IM not your family because you don’t want to love with me!” and we were all genuinely confused and when she came back Vanessa told her out right she was crazy for thinking it was a jab at her and it had nothing to do with her. Francine is bat shit crazy, I s2g.

**Turbulent-Buy3575**

*Offer to drive her to her next doctors appointment and go in and meet the doctor and thank the doctor profusely for taking care of her and her lung cancer*

>OOP: Holy shit lmaoooo

**Turbulent-Buy3575**

*Well you want to know the truth. Take her to a doctors appointment. Simple. If she’s lying she won’t accept the offer or she will forget where the office is or forget her doctors name or claim some other crazy stuff. If she’s telling you the truth, we’ll the proof will be there as well. And if she won’t take you then ask your dad to take her*

>OOP: This would be an amazing idea. Maybe I’ll see if I can dish it up if and when she comes back from NY. Honestly I see another divorce in my dads future and I’m not sure she’ll be coming back. Pretty odd she wants to be so far away from her doctor when she’s so sick, huh?



**\*\*Judgement - NTA\*\***



**Update - 2 years later**



Oh boy it’s been a long time and I went back and read some comments on my original post. And I can give yall the short version of what’s happened in the last year…

To keep it short: She lied. My dad and her had an ugly divorce that ended with my father being homeless.

Francine winded up revealing that she owed over $60k to her ex in alimony and he was taking the house where her, my father and sister were living. The week of Thanksgiving last year, she kicked them both out, and they were both homeless up until August of this year. (Before anyone asks, no I didn’t have the means to help them.) the entire thing was crazy as shit. She broke off the key in the lock to stop them from getting their things, stole a bunch of money from my dad and bought a house in New York destroying my dad’s credit, and so many other petty and disgusting things. Yes she’s still alive, yes she was questioned about her cancer. She’s fine. My dad realizing everything was a lie was very very upsetting to watch. IMO she destroyed his life.

To those that said I was TAH: suck a dick.

I’ve officially started my clinicals and hope to wind up in peds oncology after graduation. I think abt my grandmother all the time and wish she was alive to talk to her about EVERYTHING.

**Dreaming\_in\_Sign**

*As someone who has been in the cancer world from the time I was 16 (27 at the end of the month!), going into Ped. Onc. is amazing! My nurses were some of the only people who kept me sane during my long stays, and I could never thank them enough! I actually named my service dog after my favorite nurse, who would come in early to snag my chart from whoever was on my night shift lol That said, in regards to everything else, I am so sorry... is there anything your father can do legally against Francine? Like, prove she prevented him from obtaining his property and then the theft?*

**FartMasterChamp**

*Your father chose this woman over his own kids. It's pretty clear what kind of man he is. He's getting exactly what he deserves. I have no sympathy for him. As for Francine, I hope she has the life she deserves.*

**Lover-of-harpies**

*My ex's brother lied about having cancer to make everyone pay attention to him. At least he was a resourceless bum and not a human candiru like this lady*

>OOP: For what I heard— he is. Taking her to court and taking her shit it’s why she fled the state and got shot under my dads name

And just like every year, the queue is long, the hype is deafening, and your social media feed is probably flooded with unboxing videos.

The buzz is real. In India, owning the newest iPhone isn’t just about having a phone; it’s about making a statement. It’s a ticket to the exclusive club. But here’s the thing: that ticket costs a lot of money.

And that’s where we, the resident financial realists, step in. Because, frankly, the numbers tell a very different story about who is buying these devices and how they are buying them.

**The Great Indian EMI Obsession**

The easiest way to make a ₹1,00,000+ purchase feel affordable is to break it down. Enter the mighty EMI (Equated Monthly Instalment).

You’ve seen the ads: “Get the new iPhone 17 for just ₹4,999 a month!”

Sounds harmless, right? Like buying a cup of coffee every day.

But there’s a quiet truth about this trend: over 50% of iPhones in India are bought on credit or EMIs.

This is not necessarily a bad thing if you’re financially robust and using a genuine 'no-cost' EMI offer for smart liquidity management. But for most, this is simply a way to buy something they cannot afford upfront. It’s an easy on-ramp to debt for a depreciating asset.

Think about it:

1. You are borrowing money to buy a gadget.
2. The gadget loses value the moment you open the box.
3. You are paying interest (unless it’s a truly **no-cost EMI**, and even those often have processing fees or hidden costs).

You’re essentially getting poorer twice: once by committing future income, and a second time because the asset you bought is turning into junk value faster than you can pay it off.

**Status vs Utility: Which Are You Paying For?**

Let’s be brutally honest. Why do you really want the iPhone 17?

The engineers at Apple have crammed the device with cutting-edge tech: a new A17 chip that can run console-quality games, a LiDAR scanner for complex augmented reality, Apple Intelligence, a camera that captures incredible detail in 48-megapixel ProRAW, and cinematic video capabilities.

Now, answer this simple question: What percentage of these high-end features do you actually use?

If your daily routine looks something like this:

* WhatsApp chat
* Scrolling Instagram and YouTube
* Taking basic photos for social media
* Making phone calls
* Using UPI for payments

...then your usage pattern is roughly 5% of what the new iPhone 17 is capable of.

Your 2-year-old Android phone or an iPhone model from two generations ago can handle that 5% perfectly fine. In fact, most phones costing less than ₹30,000 can do it without breaking a sweat.

So, the actual choice isn't between the iPhone 17 and your old phone. It's between:

1. **Utility:** Buying a phone for its actual functional value to you.
2. **Status:** Buying a phone to signal your financial standing to others.

When you spend ₹1.2 Lakhs to use 5% of its functionality, the remaining ₹1.14 Lakhs isn't paying for utility. It's paying for a status symbol.

**The Financial Cost of 'Keeping Up'**

This is where the financial education comes in. Let’s talk about opportunity cost, the money you could have made if you hadn't bought the phone.

Suppose the total cost of the iPhone 17, along with some accessories, is ₹1,00,000. You take a 2-year EMI at a standard personal loan interest rate of, say, 15% per annum.

Your total payout over two years is roughly ₹1,16,082. You paid ₹16,082 just for the privilege of owning it now.

Now, let’s imagine you delay gratification.

You keep your old phone for two more years. Instead of paying the EMI, you start a **Systematic Investment Plan (SIP)** with the same monthly EMI amount of ₹4,837 (what you would have paid) into a decent mutual fund (which historically gives 10% annual returns).

In two years, the money you invested would be worth about ₹1,28,434.

**The difference:**

* **iPhone Route:** You have a 2-year-old, depreciated iPhone (worth maybe ₹50k to ₹60k) and are ₹16,082 poorer because of interest.
* **SIP Route:** You have a corpus of ₹1,28,434 growing for you.

You are either paying interest (making you poorer) or earning returns (making you wealthier). The decision to buy on EMI for status directly sacrifices wealth creation.

Is that 'status' worth sacrificing ₹1.2 Lakhs of future wealth?

**The Hidden Trap of FOMO**

The real engine driving these sales is FOMO (Fear of Missing Out), fueled by the constant digital parade on social media.

Everyone around you seems to have the new phone. You feel pressure to 'fit in' or to look 'successful.' It’s a vicious cycle where people are spending money they don’t have to impress people they don’t even like, with a device they don’t actually need.

Real wealth is not the brand of phone in your hand. Real wealth is the number in your bank account, the assets you own, and the freedom you have from debt.

A person who carries an older phone but has a fully funded emergency corpus, zero high-interest debt, and a strong SIP running is richer than the person flaunting the latest iPhone on a 24-month high-interest EMI.

**When Does Buying an iPhone Make Sense (Yes, It Can)?**

This is not a zero-sum argument. There are legitimate cases where buying a premium iPhone can be rational. Consider:

* If your earning potential depends on the phone (e.g. a content creator, social media influencer, a professional photographer, someone doing shoots or editing on the phone). In that case, the device is not just for consumption; it’s a tool.
* If you already have disciplined finances - an **emergency fund**, no high-interest debt, consistent investments - and the EMI won’t upset your core financial plan.
* If you really value Apple’s ecosystem (Mac, iPad, iCloud, Handoff, services) and expect to use those features meaningfully over multiple years, that extra convenience might justify part of the premium.

In such cases, the iPhone becomes more like “a tool with extra perks” instead of “just a showpiece.”

**Final Thoughts**

There's nothing wrong with wanting nice things. But there's everything wrong with sacrificing your financial future for temporary social validation.

*Be an Intentional Buyer, Not a FOMO Buyer.*

Before you swipe that card or sign up for that next EMI, take a deep breath and ask yourself these three questions:

1. **Utility Check:** What problem does the iPhone 17 solve that my current phone cannot solve? Do I use the features that justify the ₹1 Lakh+ price tag?
2. **Affordability Check:** Can I buy this phone cash without touching my emergency fund or any of my investment goals? If the answer is no, you can't afford it.
3. **Opportunity Cost Check:** If I invested the total cost of this phone (including interest/fees) for two years, how much would that be? Is the temporary social validation worth giving up that future corpus?

Your phone is a tool. Don’t let it become your master. Build your net worth, not your self-worth, based on an expensive gadget.

You want something professional yet personal—something that reflects genuine appreciation without feeling overly promotional. Here are some thoughtful ideas and tips to help you make a lasting impression this holiday season:

**1. Personalised Gifts**

* A touch of personalization goes a long way.
* Consider items like engraved pens, monogrammed notebooks, or a handwritten note that acknowledges your working relationship.
* These gifts show sincerity and effort, making your client feel genuinely valued.

**2. Gourmet Food & Drink Hampers**

* Edible gifts never go out of style—they’re shareable and widely appreciated.
* Think artisanal chocolates, fine teas, coffees, or gourmet snack assortments.
* If you have multiple clients, choose high-quality items that reflect care without extravagance.
* Companies like Exclusively Luxe often highlight the importance of tasteful presentation, which can elevate even a simple gift.

**3. Sustainable & Local Options**

* Supporting local or eco-friendly brands shows social responsibility.
* Consider gifts made from recycled materials or sourced from small local artisans.
* Sustainable gifts communicate that your business values community and environmental awareness.

**4. Practical Office Essentials**

* Choose items your clients can actually use—premium journals, reusable bottles, or quality desk organizers.
* These gifts serve as daily reminders of your professionalism and reliability.
* Avoid over-branding; subtlety feels more refined and thoughtful.

# 5. Virtual or Experience-Based Gifts

* For international or remote clients, digital gifts work beautifully.
* E-gift cards, online course vouchers, or charitable donations in their name can be thoughtful and inclusive.
* Experience-based gifts (like a coffee tasting or wellness subscription) add a unique, personal touch.

**6. Presentation Matters**

* How a gift is presented can be just as important as what’s inside.
* Neatly wrapped packaging, handwritten tags, or elegant gift boxes create a memorable unboxing experience.

***In Chapter 3, a priest stops in for tea and a final confession at The Midnight Diner.*** 

The doorbell’s chime cut through the hum of the fluorescent lights. Kat looked up from the counter, cloth still moving in slow circles over a patch of Formica that hadn’t needed cleaning in ten minutes. A man had stepped in from the drizzle, shaking water from his sleeves as though brushing off an unpleasant memory.

He was somewhere in his fifties and of average height. His hair was thick, a light reddish-brown that didn’t quite belong to his age. It was too even, too deliberate. The man had been handsome once and still believed he might be. His tweed coat was well cut, English in a way that made him seem out of place at The Midnight Diner, with a black shirt tucked into narrow jeans, sued shoes, and, most surprisingly, a priest’s collar at his throat. When he smiled, his teeth were very large and neat, and his voice carried that rounded London calm that made everything sound like a podcast.

“Good evening,” he said. “Still serving?”

“Coffee all night,” Kat answered, already reaching for a mug.

He shook his head, setting his briefcase carefully on the stool beside him. “I don’t drink coffee. Tea, if you’ve got it.”

“Sure,” she said. “With sugar?”

The man considered the question, gaze slipping toward the window, where the rain streaked down in thin, trembling lines. “With honey,” he replied at last, the word landing soft but deliberate. “It’s always nice to have a little something sweet at the end of your day.”

Kat turned to fill the kettle. The metal hissed as it met the burner. Behind her, the man sighed as though releasing something long held. Outside, beyond the glass, the night continued to gather itself. It was always night there, she thought, as she poured the boiling water over the teabag and watched the color spread like smoke through glass. English breakfast with a bit of honey. Just the way he liked it, though she couldn’t remember how she knew that.

“Not much choice,” he said, studying the menu. “But you know, I’ve always loved these American-style diners. Something about them that’s so honest. Down-to-earth. I’ve been in places where they call an omelette *artisan*, and they still burn it.” He smiled at her over the laminated page. “At least here you know what you’re getting.”

“Well,” Kat said, smiling. “People don’t come here for surprises. It’s usually coffee, eggs, and bacon, to be honest.”

“Comfort, then. Predictability.” He stirred his tea slowly and stared at it a little longer than normal, as if waiting for a vision.

“Are you a priest?” asked Kat, looking again at his collar.

“Oh, yes,” he said, looking at her and beaming. “And quite a good one, if I do say so myself.”

His accent softened the confession into charm. “Lovely little parish. Hedgerows, cricket matches, the whole postcard business. Bees in the garden behind the rectory. I don’t keep bees, but I did have a hired hand keep them for me. Nothing quite like organic honey, don’t you think?” He lifted the jar of *Melissea’s Organic Honey* and looked at it approvingly. “Lovely stuff.”

“Do you still have bees?” Kat asked.

The priest shook his head. “Left them behind. Congregation, hives, the lot. It’s astonishing how quickly they replace you. You stop tending the boxes, and the new queen decides she’d rather live elsewhere. Same with people.” He laughed under his breath, a sound with no humor in it. “You preach to them every Sunday, think you’re indispensable, and then one day they’re singing Hallelujah for someone else.”

He took a slow sip of tea, and grimaced. “Needs more honey.”

Kat grabbed the jar from the counter. When she came back, he was watching his reflection in the stainless-steel napkin holder, tilting his head to catch the light on his hair. *Plugs, I bet*, she thought cynically.

“Looks all right, doesn’t it?” he said, running a hand over his bangs. “Bit of help from the good people at Harley Street, of course. Everyone wants to look the part. The church never quite understood that. Branding, you know.” He drizzled honey into his cup. “It’s no use talking about salvation if you look like you’ve already lost the fight.”

The diner was quiet except for the kettle’s settling clicks and the low conversation humming in the background. Various patrons sat talking to one another; a few sat alone. A quiet, older couple sat in one of the booths. She could tell they were trying to listen in, even as they moved their food around on their plate. Kat looked outside and noticed that the rain had stopped. The glass shone black and empty for a moment longer, before something small struck it with a dull tap.

Another followed. Then another.

The priest didn’t notice. He was still speaking, voice low, almost tender. “Sunday mornings, the air would smell of beeswax and hymn books. Especially in Spring. The English coast is Paradise in May. Have you been? Wonderful. Children running around in the churchyard, parents pretending they believed every word of what I preached to them. Newsflash, they don’t. I used to think that was holiness, the effort of pretending. We we were all pretending to believe.”

A small shape fluttered against the window again. Kat glanced over and narrowed her eyes, trying to figure out what it was. A bee, fat and golden, was crawling down the pane. She blinked. Another landed beside it.

*Strange*, she thought. *Are there wildflowers around? Do bees fly at night?* She didn’t think so.

The priest lifted his cup, unaware. He smiled into his tea, and outside, the dark began to hum.

Kat topped off the kettle and left it to whisper on the burner. The priest sat with his hands braced on either side of the cup, as if the warmth were something he needed to steady himself against. Outside, rain had given way to that polished, late-night stillness, where the parking lot looks like a black mirror with a few coins of light tossed across it.

The priest’s voice thinned as he spoke, the words drifting like smoke from the lip of the cup. “My father kept bees,” he said. “That’s why I always wanted to have them around. Always the same hives, lined in a soldier’s row along the hedge. They were his parish before he ever looked inside a Bible. He’d hum to them; low, steady, the sort of sound that didn’t care who was listening. He said the bees liked to hear a man at work. They’d calm if you sang to them.”

The man touched his throat, as if feeling for that old vibration. “He was so gentle with them…” he said, softly.

“The first thing I learned about faith came from those hives: if you move too quickly, you get punished; if you keep still and quiet, you get spared. I suppose that was his Gospel, anyway.”

Kat watched him trace a fingertip around the rim of his teacup. The night was still, the parking lot glimmered with leftover rain, and the neon lights pulsed faintly in the window.

“He had a craftsman’s patience,” the priest continued. “Hours bent over those boxes, smoke rising from the little tin he carried, the bees lifting off him like little helicopters, the most remarkable creatures. I used to stand by the gate and watch. He’d lift the frames, check the comb, nod as if reading a profound piece of wisdom in the scriptures. When I was allowed closer, he made me wear the veil. I remember the netting pressing against my nose, the smell of linen and smoke. He said it kept me safe. It kept me quiet.”

The hum of the lights overhead blurred into something deeper. Kat thought for a moment that the power had dipped, but it was only her ears adjusting and a faint drone coming from outside, from the glass itself.

“He kept rules the way other men kept gardens,” the priest said. “Everything clipped to the same line. When I disobeyed, he took me out back to remind me where order ends and chaos begins. Afterwards, he would tell me it was love. He always used that word. It’s strange, isn’t it? How a word can outlive its meaning.”

He didn’t flinch at what he said, just stirred the tea again thoughtfully, as if tasting the memory. “When he finally abandoned my mother and I, he left almost nothing behind. Just the beehives and a half-empty drawer of clothes. I went through it as if it might explain him: shirts folded with military care, a jar of cufflinks, one pair of boxer shorts patterned with bees. I stared at his underwear for ages, at those bees, waiting for a lesson to appear. Of all the things to leave me for an inheritance.” He laughed to himself.

The man took a small sip, grimaced. “I couldn’t keep his hives, anyway. They made me nervous. I’d stand at the hedge and listen to the hum, waiting for the moment they’d turn on me, just as my father would, on occasion, leave me bleeding and call it love. But of course, they never did. Bees are gentle creatures. In fact, they simply left. Maybe they followed him to God-knows-where he went. One day the boxes were empty, and the air went very still. It was quieter than peace. That’s the sound that follows me: silence after a swarm.”

Kat caught herself listening for it, the pause between vibrations. A faint flicker passed over the glass again, and she caught the outline of a single bee down along the windowsill. A couple others that had parked themselves on the door flew over to join it. The rhythm of their movements was irregular, but patient, searching.

The priest looked up as if he noticed her attention shifted. “Rupert was the first person who made noise feel safe again,” he said sadly. “Lived three houses down. He was older, stronger, better at everything boys think matters, but he was kind enough not to notice. We spent summers in the meadow behind the cottages, with wildflowers taller than our heads, the smell of foxglove and clover, the air thick with bees. You could lie on your back and feel the world turn without moving a muscle. He would laugh at me for keeping my hands folded and clasped close to my body. Told me the bees only sting if you lie to them. I didn’t believe him, but I wanted to.”

He smiled at the table. “He’d catch one sometimes, cup his palms together, a little pulse of life inside. Then he’d let it go and watch it vanish, proud of himself. I tried once, got stung, and cried like an idiot. He said the pain was just proof I was alive. I remember thinking he sounded like my father, only kind.”

From outside came another small tap. The bees were multiplying now, not frantic yet but purposeful, gathering like raindrops refusing to fall. The sound carried through the glass, a low tremor Kat felt in her fingertips as she wiped the counter.

The man turned the spoon in his cup again, a faint scrape of metal on porcelain. “Rupert left for school in London, you know. I stayed. Studied law first, because it sounded respectable, then theology because it sounded like redemption. People assume one is the cure for the other. It isn’t. They both teach you how to arrange guilt neatly on a shelf.”

The hum deepened, close enough now that the air itself seemed to vibrate. Kat tried to count the shapes on the glass as the man kept talking, but she quickly lost count; the movement had become the shimmer of a thousand wings. Each movement left a faint smear of gold that caught the light before fading. It was beautiful, and wrong.

Still, the other patrons didn’t seem to notice. Two truckers at the far booth were laughing softly, the cook in back was whistling off-key. Only she and the priest seemed tuned to the same frequency.

He went on quietly, as if talking to himself. “Rupert used to say that bees understand loyalty better than we do. A hive will die for its queen without question. My father would have liked that thought. He used to say obedience is the truest form of love. Perhaps that’s why I listened to him longer than I should have.”

The priest finished the tea and stared at the empty cup. “I thought if I became the one giving orders, I’d never have to hear his voice again. I built sermons instead of hives. Collected people instead of honey. It’s remarkable how similar the work feels if you close your eyes.”

The sound filled the room now, a single deep chord that made the napkin holder quiver and the spoons tremble on their hooks. He smiled faintly as he looked at her, like a man recognizing an old song.

“That sound,” he whispered, closing his eyes. “That’s how heaven must be like: obedience-made music.”

He opened his eyes again. They were clear and blue, oddly young and infinitely sad. “Don’t worry,” he said. “They’re like my children. They’ve always known me, and I’ve always known them.”

The hum thickened until it was impossible to tell whether it came from outside or from within the walls themselves. Kat held very still, the cloth damp in her hands, the smell of honey and cleaner mixing together and rising through the air. She leaned on the counter, pretending to wipe another clean spot. The bees had quieted for a moment, a collective breath between movements. Almost half the window was covered now by their seething bodies, trembling in a slow dance. She imagined all of them were staring at her.

“I went to seminary in the city,” he recounted, “back when everything still looked possible. High ceilings, cold floors, the smell of paper and polish. We studied God like He was a theory that could be diagrammed. They told us He lived in rational thought, in human achievement, in discipline: knees bent, eyes lowered, voices trained to chant. I thought, where was the mystery? It was almost like a science there. I don’t know. I didn’t like it much, but I pressed on.”

He smiled to himself. “The Church loves a man who sounds confident, so even though I doubted, I still had what it took. That’s all I was, really: confidence in a collar. Throw in a dash of good looks, a killer speaking voice, and the ability to fit into a nice pair of skinny jeans, and who could ask for anything more? Jesus be damned! He never looked so good.

“Well, my first parish was coastal. A small, tired church with a spire that leaned like it was making a confession. I mended it, or tried to. We repainted, added music, lights, a touch of theatre. You can get anyone to believe in redemption if the lighting’s good. And a good stage. You needed a good stage. Altars are so middle ages, don’t you think? And as I learned in seminary, to Hell with mystery, am I right? Out with the old and in with the new, I say! It’s what the people want.”

He laughed, the sound tight and cynical. “You should have seen the place, full to bursting! All of them singing songs they didn’t believe in, just for the pleasure of hearing themselves in harmony. An emotional intoxication: all those voices, all those eyes on you. It’s not God they’re looking at, is it? It’s the reflection of their own longing.”

The priest sipped, winced. “Well, now it’s too sweet.”

He kept talking, voice soft and almost tender. “I had a gift for listening. People tell you things if you let the silence last long enough. Guilt makes them generous. They want to hand it over, and I was always willing to take it. You absorb enough of that and you start to think you’re doing them a favor.

“In fact, they trusted me completely. That’s the worst part, you know. The trust. It sits on your tongue like honey, too thick to swallow, too sweet to spit out. I told myself I was healing them. That was the lie that kept the sermons easy.”

The bees were denser now, crawling in sheets across the window, blotting the view. Kat could see their tiny legs working, their wings flickering under the light. But no one else noticed. The cook moved in and out of the kitchen; the truckers laughed softly. The couple in the booth continued to move their fried eggs around their plates. A teenage boy sat by himself in a booth beside theirs, studying a menu. The world kept pretending it was ordinary.

“I grew popular,” he continued, speaking faster, his accent sharpening. “Newspapers called me The Modern Cleric. The Bishop of London said I was the future. I believed her. There were banners, photographs, interviews. They printed my words under headlines about faith and youth and optimism and so much about the love of God. I even thought about writing a book! Imagine that, me, an authority on love and goodness.”

He laughed, short and sharp. “I still had my flaws, of course. Everyone does. Pride, impatience, a bit of vanity, but I did good work, didn’t I? People were fed, the sick were visited, the choir was paid. I built a life out of small, manageable virtues.”

Kat asked, “And then?”

He looked at her, startled, as if she’d broken a spell.

“And then,” he said quietly, “the murmurs began, didn’t they? Misunderstandings, they called them. Accusations. A fog of rumor that never lifted. I told myself it was envy. Success breeds resentment, you know. But once people decide they’ve seen a monster, they don’t look away.”

He rubbed his temple. “And the press came, of course. Headlines, statements, the inevitable suspension. It all happens so fast now; one minute you’re on the altar, the next you’re ash in the wind and last years’ next best thing.”

The bees pressed thicker against the window, wings rasping like sandpaper. The air in the diner had turned heavy. A faint sweetness lingered beneath the smell of grease and coffee. Kat noticed the light dim as the swarm blocked out the neon sign outside. She turned toward the coffee station to grab the hot water and refill his cup, when she saw them crawling up through the drain in the sink, one by one. The hum was in the walls now.

The priest’s hands were flat on the counter, the knuckles white against the laminate. His voice changed; the performance drained away. “It’s the young ones who believe the fastest,” he said. “They listen the hardest. You tell them they matter, and they bloom right there in front of you. You think you’re saving them, and perhaps you are for a while. Everyone wants to be chosen.”

The priest looked at Kat for a long moment, and asked, “Don’t you?”

He didn’t wait for a response. “You tell them they’re special. You teach them how to speak to God as though He’s a friend who answers back each morning: coffee and Jesus, like bread and butter. You take their fear and make it feel like grace. It’s a lovely trick while it lasts.

“You start thinking of them as your work. That’s the danger. They become your evidence. Every smiling face a line on your résumé for heaven, and then you find you can’t tell where comfort ends and ownership begins. It all feels the same when they look at you that way: hopeful, terrified, grateful. You tell yourself it’s love because you need it to be.”

A tremor passed through the diner floor. Cups rattled faintly on their saucers. No one else seemed to care; a trucker flipped a page of his newspaper as if nothing moved.

The man went on, his accent thinning with exhaustion. “I’d take one or two under my wing, mentor them, guide them. You tell yourself it’s discipleship. You give them gifts, attention, a place to sit near the front so they feel seen. They glow under it. It’s a terrible, wonderful light. And they were helpful. Whatever I wanted they would do. Good boys, they were. My busy little bees.”

A few bees crawled out of the heating vent onto the ceiling and began crawling across it, dropping onto the counter with dull thuds. Kat stepped back in disgust. They were bigger than any bees that she had ever seen. They were scrambling on the smooth Formica, heading towards the priest’s arm, but he only watched them fondly.

His tone lifted again, sermon-like. “But tell me, what sin is worse? To give too much of yourself or to be adored for the wrong reasons? They called it exploitation, but I called it devotion gone to seed. I saw need, and I answered it. Isn’t that what we’re taught to do?”

Kat watched him the way you watch a street you’re about to cross, measuring distance, the speed of passing cars. The priest had settled back into himself, thumb circling the saucer, that little smile warming and cooling like the pulse of the swarm outside, but he seemed perfectly at home in the hum. His eyes were glazed over, and his mouth was set in a firm line, as if he were visiting a far away and painful memory.

“Can I ask you something?” she said.

The man glanced up, polite but somewhat confused. “Ask me what?”

“Did you do it?” The words surprised her with how plain they sounded. No euphemism, no cushion, just the question set on the counter between them like a chipped saucer.

A beat. Then the practiced smile. “Do what, exactly? I mean, people say so many imaginative things when they’re bored. Especially children.”

“Did you hurt them?” she asked, and felt her throat narrow around the last word.

The man let out a breath that was almost a laugh. “Hurt is a very modern term, you know. I *cared* for them. I cared more than anyone.” He reached for his cup, found it empty, set it down again. “You weren’t there.”

Before she could answer, a motion at a far booth tugged at her eye. The teenage boy who sat alone was waving at her. He was maybe sixteen, hair dark and damp-looking, plastered to his forehead as if he’d walked through the rain to get there. He wore an oversized hoodie, jeans gone shiny at the knees, and shoes scuffed to a dull gray. He lifted his hand and waved her over in a small, courteous way, afraid to interrupt.

Kat left the priest at the counter with his empty cup. “I’m sorry,” she said when she reached the boy. “I didn’t see you come in.”

“People don’t,” he said with a similar English lilt as the priest. “But he saw me come in when I first came to his church.” He tipped his chin toward the counter without moving his gaze. “Told me that I was the best thing that ever happened to the little parish.”

“Were you… alone?” Kat asked.

“I was good being alone,” he said. “And I was lost and scared, rejected by my parents, dabbling in drugs already, even at fifteen. But it didn’t matter anymore.” The ghost of a smile emerged on his handsome and delicate face. “He said I had a home now. A bed. Food. He took me in, let me stay at the parsonage, said I had a future because he could see one, because Jesus told him that very morning that he would meet someone like me. But I was just a little something sweet at the end of the day, wasn’t I?”

Kat swallowed hard, and she suddenly needed a drink. Anxiety seethed in her stomach, a ball of buzzing, nervous energy. She didn’t want to hear it. She glanced over her shoulder to look at the priest, who had turned slightly on his stool to stare at his reflection in the shine of the espresso machine. The little practiced smile was back, the one that fit him like an expensive coat. He was picking at his oversized teeth. Suddenly he was ugly to her. Whatever vestiges of youth or charisma had disappeared. She wanted him out.

“I’m sorry,” Kat said, turning back to the boy.

He nodded as if she’d told him the weather. “I believed him. It’s easy to believe a person who never stops looking at you.” He laced his fingers together on the table, knuckles pale. “And there was a price for belonging, for having a home. He taught me that, too.

“And the thing is,” he went on, words soft beneath the buzz of a million honeybees, “when I stopped giving him what he wanted, when I fought back, he—”

“Don’t say it,” Kat said, too sharply. It came out like a slap, and she hated the sound of it the second it left her mouth.

The boy’s eyes widened. Tears filled them, and for a moment Kat thought he was going to cry. Then she thought that she would cry instead.

He looked down at his hands. “That’s what he said to me,” he murmured. “Don’t say it. Don’t tell anyone. But I was going to tell someone anyway. I was getting angry.”

The hum pushed deeper into the room until it pressed against Kat’s teeth. She felt it like a low-grade fever. She knew what the boy was going to say when she asked her next question. Kat looked back toward the counter and the priest; calm, composed, listening to nothing, or maybe to the sound of his own sermons in his head.

She turned back to the boy in front of her. “And then what?”

“I think you know,” he said, looking over her shoulder to the man at the counter. “So can I order something?”

“Of course,” she said quietly. “Whatever you want. It’s on me.”

“A Truth Sandwich,” he said. No smile. Just a look that met her eyes with confidence. “But I’ll get it myself.”

Kat stepped aside as the boy slid out of the booth and stood. He was smaller than he looked sitting down. The gray hoodie swallowed his shoulders. He walked to the door with a careful tread, yet she noticed a lightness to his steps.

“Father,” he said loudly across the room. But no one turned to look. The guests kept their slow conversation; a fork scraped a plate; the cook sang two notes of some old song and then forgot the rest.

But the priest heard and turned around.

When he saw the boy, the little smile died on his mouth like a candle starved of air. His eyes widened in a way that stripped years from his face and left nothing but the frightened child who learned to be cruel so he wouldn’t be small.

“You,” he said, barely a breath. It was the last word he would ever speak.

“You told me I was chosen,” the boy said sadly, placing a hand on the door handle. “You told me I was your busy little bee.” Then he pulled it open.

The night came in on a hinge, and with it the sound broke from a hum into a living roar. The first wave of bees moved like smoke and like water and like something with a will that was unified, hell-bent on death. The ceiling vents exploded outward. The drains erupted. Waves of them poured in. They arced over the threshold, down from the vents, out of the hairline cracks in the tile, and the thin seam at the base of the jukebox. The room filled with black and gold motion. Kat’s body wanted to run, to cover her mouth and close eyes, but somehow she knew they wouldn’t touch her or any other clueless patron in that place.

The swarm found the man as if he were a single stalk of foxglove and the last pollen for a thousand miles They wrapped him head to hands in a moving veil. He stood at first, stunned, then screamed and stumbled back against the counter. The bees were stinging then. He slid down, trying to hide his face in the crook of one of his arms, waving the other around to fend off the waves of what seemed like an endless sea. It didn’t matter. They were in his hair, his ears, the soft corners of his eyes. Stinging. He tried crying out for help, and the sound came out thick, because the bees already filled his mouth, driving their stingers in a frenzied rage into his lips, his tongue, his throat.

The man drew in a breath to scream and took wings and rage into his lungs instead. He coughed and vomited at the same time, and it was a wet, sweet sound; a ball of insects tumbled from his mouth, then flew back up and in as if desperate to go back home.

Stings swelled his throat in little suns. Welts bloomed along the lines of his jaw and disappeared beneath the moving mass. The skin on his face was bright red, swollen and heavy. He tried to rise, and the swarm rose with him, lifting and settling in a pulse that made it look as if the bees were purposely trying to keep him down. He staggered again, struck the counter a second time and sent the teacup spinning. It shattered on the floor.

Kat saw his eyes once through the living veil, blue blown wide, a child’s terror behind a man’s face, the desperate stare of a man drowning in a sea of black and yellow bodies. Then he sank beneath the waves. He sagged sideways, and the swarm moved with gravity and fell with him, a living shroud heaped up on the tile floor. A hand reached out, grasping for an invisible rung, but the bees swarmed upward, stinging its flesh until the blood began to flow and his hand disappeared again.

“It’s finished,” she murmured, staring at the terror before her. The swarm loosened the shape of him and lifted as one, a single inhalation. There was no body left, though whether they ate him or stung him into non-existence, she couldn’t say. A single priest’s collar lay on the floor where he had been, the white tab smeared with red. The bees wheeled in a slow spiral and sped in a great receding wave out the door, which the boy held open, staring at what remained of his oppressor with a look that held both grief and satisfaction.

Kat stared as they flew past the boy and out into the night. Each one had been a voice. Not just the boys the priest had touched and bent and silenced, but all the voices that were silenced when the stories spread, and the people said, *Not again*, and left the pews and took their children and their already fragile faith with them. Men like him help shut the door on anything that could call itself a blessing in the lives of so many. All that potential turned to dust, a cathedral of ruin built out of a thousand tiny lives.

Her eyes met the boy’s for a moment, but when the last of the bees disappeared, so had he. The door slowly closed on its own.

Around her, the diner continued as it had. Not one of the patrons seemed to have noticed anything that happened. She couldn’t really understand what was going on. Was she having a vision? But the first thing she saw when she turned from the door was the broken teacup and the bloodied collar.

Kat picked them up carefully and dropped them in the bin. Tea had tracked across the tiles and dried tacky; she felt it pull at her soles as she moved. On the counter, a spoon sat glued to a small map of spilled honey. She pried it free, wiped the scar of sweetness away, and watched her own hand go back and forth, back and forth, until it looked like someone else’s.

She straightened the sugar caddy, righted the salt, and set a clean cup on the saucer by reflex. Around her, the diners continued their ordinary devotions: forks, newspapers, the slow ceremony of a night that expects nothing. The neon hummed outside, steady again. Kat pressed the cloth to the counter and moved it in patient circles, polishing a shine into the place where a man had been and where, if anyone asked in the morning, no one would remember him at all.",1,1760419191.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

I quit multiple substances and bad habits during my life for example nicotine over 10 years but this thing has a very strong grip on me. I grew up with tea and started to drink coffee only when I was around 32. Now 6 years later, I'm struggling. 

The problem is not just caffeine because when I switch to tea, everything seems to fall into place for a couple of days and then my motivation and mental health becomes shit. Coffee is also affect me very very badly. Anxiety, Restlessness, severe ADHD, insomnia til morning,  low blood pressure and no apetite are the main reasons I cannot continue.   
  
My previous attempt failed at 35 days and I went back to using substances for a couple of days (which is much worse). I have a dog, I have jobs, responsibility and goals, and I cannot afford to do it obviously so I went back to drinking coffee again instead of worse options. When I quit, life becomes so dull, life becomes so slow and I cannot do anything done but when I start, life becomes so fast that my physical being cannot keep up with my thoughts. The only way I can handle is when I workout on it, like exactly before running but my dogs are 247 with me these days and I have no free time for that. Even then, the effects linger long enough to ruin my other activities.

I ordered 50mg caffeine gummies tonight with the hope of filtering out some bad effects because I strongly believe there is something else in coffee that reacts very bad with caffeine. I had days that I drank up to 8 cups black tea and I was no where near where I am with just one cup of coffee. I hate to say this but the closest feeling I get on coffee is when I was on amphetamine.

Anybody had any success with caffeine pills or gummies ?",4,1760419176.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

Something that really stuck with you after finishing the game. I also like that often times with these you can sometimes find a bit of environmental storytelling nearby to go with what you just heard/read.



Here's a few that have stuck with me over the years:

1. In Dead Space there's an audio log you can find of one of the crew members who didn't want to turn into a Necromorph and hurt anyone so he severed all his limbs. It always stuck with me from the original Dead Space game, but it's even worse in the remake. Absolutely brutal to listen to him screaming. You can find a Necromorph near the audio log missing all but one of its limbs so his plan didn't even work.

>""Supervisor 2nd Engineer Dallas reporting. This will be my last report. I've seen what they do...to the bodies. What they become. I can't let that happen to me. At least if I don't have any limbs...I won't be able to kill anyone when I'm infected...  
*(Gun charging in the background)* Please, tell Dawn... and the kids... that I love them.  
*(Gunshot)* Oh God... *(Panting in pain, second gunshot)*  
One more...one more... *(3rd and last gunshot)""* 



2. In Fallout 4 there's a terminal entry in the Vault-Tec Regional HQ that cracks me up and just totally captures the franchise's dark humor. It's even better cause you can find a skeleton hidden in the basement with a pen.

>""Sharon spilled coffee on my new shirt while we were in the lounge this morning. I told her it was fine and we had a good laugh about the whole thing. If she does it again I'll stab her in the fucking throat with my pen. She's a good kid.""



3. In Bioshock: Infinite there's an audio log from a character who sets traps around trying to catch members of the Vox Populi (rebel group). A young boy who was acting as a courier gets caught and they have to cut his leg off. Near the audio log you just see a bloody bear trap. It's a really haunting audio log and has really stuck with me over the years.

My obstacle: myself.

I have extremely specific requirements, and I’m convinced my ideal tumbler might be a myth, but if anyone can prove me wrong, it’s Reddit. Here’s what I’m looking for:

1. **Capacity:** At least 18–20 oz. I do a quad shot with milk or cold foam and ice, and 16 oz just doesn’t cut it.
2. **Leak-proof:** Needs to survive being tossed in my bag without turning it into a coffee crime scene.
3. **Cupholder-friendly:** Must fit in a standard car cupholder.
4. **Clear body:** I need to see the swirl of milk and espresso mixing. Preferably glass, but I’ll take high-quality clear plastic for travel safety.
5. **Double-insulated:** No condensation, no sweaty tumbler hands, no damp backpack.
6. **Lid + handle:** Easy to carry and to stash in a backpack bottle pocket. Bonus if the drinking surface stays covered (I work at an animal hospital, so hair happens).
7. **Sippy-style lid preferred:** Like the Starbucks cold foam lids that enhance the flavor and texture. If it has a straw, the opening can’t be one of those frustratingly narrow ones (looking at you, Nespresso Nomad).
8. **Aesthetic:** Minimal, clean, and chic. Functional but pretty enough to live on an influencer’s counter.

I realize I might be asking for a unicorn here, but maybe one of you coffee gear geniuses has already found it or hacked one together.

**TL;DR:** I want a clear, insulated, leak-proof, cupholder-friendly 20 oz tumbler with a handle and sippy lid, basically if a Stanley, a Nespresso Nomad, and a Starbucks cold cup had a beautiful, practical baby.",1,1760418989.0,IcedCoffee,0,1.0,False

So my life has been pretty rough from dealing with all sort of abuse growing up to becoming and enraged person to coming back to Christ in my 20’s. I grew up nondenominational still am. I walk with Christ daily but lately everything has hit like a ton of bricks to the face backed with a chair to the neck. I’m 38 and recently very recently had a heart attack. Some genetics played a role but I was told it was the extreme stress I have been living under. My child’s father turned out to be a very unsavory character that has stalked us since she was about 2. He stalked me when I was still pregnant. I moved thought it was over. It wasn’t. Since then we’ve been through name changes and moved around the states trying to stay safe. I’m now to the point I’m looking into personal protection. The last year we had someone break in and I took my child and ran just to find out the person I trusted was in cahoots with this guy. Had something aimed at me in front of my daughter and praise Jesus we left the next morning. We ended up sleeping in a tent for a few months. It was some relaxation we needed. Found out she had asthma pretty bad landed in the er. Got that taken care of. Then my mom offered to help us get a place and moved with us into an apartment. Been here not even two months had a cold went to er thinking it was pneumonia. Welp I was in the midst of a heart attack. 100%blockage on an artery on the bottom. Now on a slew of meds still in early stages of healing. Went from being super active walking and hiking shopping just normal for us. I’ve been on SSI for awhile for ptsd anxiety and paranoia. I’ve called police so much they don’t like me. Even when I had physical evidence things are really happening I was pood off. There were literal finger prints drag marks and a pit dug where someone was sleeping in our basement and no one wanted to come out. We’re blessed to have our home now. Not many options for fear to kick in. I’ve been stuck in bed for to long and will be for awhile. Having a hard time not focusing on all the bad and my past. Haven’t had friends since 2010. Lost a ton when I got clean and sober the rest fell away after we had to start running. I feel so alone. The loneliness is killing me (killing me) I must confess I still believe (still believe) lol I just needed to get it out there. I fell apart on my mom and sobbed tonight. I’m a tall big lady with a weird sense of humor. Still very immature but if I couldn’t laugh at inappropriate moment or supposed to be serious moments I would’ve ko’d a long time ago. If you get this far could you please pray I get through this funk. I’m learning how to relax and destress but that has never been a strong suit so I need all the prayers anyone can pray for me and mine and maybe someone to talk to ??? Since I’m on blood thinners I’ve been told to not work with my wire crafts.  My next payday I figured I’d get a Bob Ross set up and make some happy mistakes I can play in and get dirty with. Most my hobbies are physical like refurbing old furniture  and random pieces. I’m a great artist just no strength to draw. I’m lucky if I make it to the bathroom and the coffee pot in one trip. Thanks for reading all of this! Jesus be with you and yours. ",1,1760418808.0,Christianity,4,1.0,False
1o66swm,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatShouldIDo/comments/1o66swm/should_i_confess/,Should I Confess?,"I know it’s pretty much in the title haha but I’ve had a crush on someone for a while (almost two years) I went through all the stages of denial, realization and acceptance but now it’s eating me alive in a way. 

We don’t see each other much but when we do it’s just laughter and happy moments and I just honestly feel safe with him (and I have a lot of social anxiety). The problem is those moments are only at work. I’d hate to ruin what friendship we have and the work environment over this. I’m fairly close with all of my coworkers but not like he is and all i can think is what if I ruin the whole dynamic? 

But more importantly what if i make him feel uncomfortable? I’d rather bottle it up for as long as I need to than make him feel any negative emotions towards me and I feel it would be selfish to tell him my feelings. 

The only reason I’m even considering it is because of his behavior but I could be overthinking. He looks at me when he laughs, he remembers little things like the coffee i drink  at work, and we briefly texted for a few days about stuff and it started with me getting the courage to ask what he thought of a recent movie that came out. He seemed enthusiastic about texting back but I don’t know. I didn’t know how to continue the conversation so I haven’t texted him and he hasn’t texted me first so I’m pretty down.

I could go into this a lot more even with how much I like him and all but I wanted to keep it as short as I could for you all. Apologies on how disorganized this might be haha but I’ll take any advice and appreciate it 💜

1o66q9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1o66q9w/my_parents_argued_a_lot_during_my_childhood_and/,"My parents argued a lot during my childhood, and my father wanted me to listen and participate","This is a long story, and I'm not sure to who should I tell this since I don't want to be an annoyance to my friends or make my family guilty, so I hopped on to an alt to make this post to vent a little and remain anonnymous of my friends and family, it's not a big tragedy nor any big juicy/funny drama, but it's my life. Also, excuse my poor English this isn't my main language.

Ever since I was little, my parents argued, a lot. I don't really recall many events that transcurred during that time, but I recall that those were really tough times, so much so that as a child I contracted Bronchospasm and I even became a bully as a way to vent all my frustrations against others in the form of hate. Massive outbursts of rage and violence weren't uncommon for little me and I got multiple citations by the school administration because of that, luckily I never did anything really bad.

The main reason of why I was like that was because of how things were at home, at that time, we didn't have a lot of money, so both of my parents were really stressed, my mother sold pillows and blankets through internet, and my dad worked in a pharmacy. They argued a lot, with each other, and with us. And it wasn't pretty, they screamed and insulted at each other, and same for us.

My dad was a really strict and temperamental man, he snapped really easily, and when scolding, he would always approach to you until he corners you and start screaming and insulting mere centimeters of my face, towering me, feeling his spit on my face while he did so. Also, at first during the first 6 years of my life, not only did he do that, but he also used physical punishments, like spanking, and using a leather belt.

And the years went by, luckily at that time I had my big brother at my side, so when my parents started arguing, we would lock ourselves in the bedroom, and he would turn on his pc and start playing a game like the binding of isaac while making funny commentaries which would make me laugh a lot.

Now, I don't recall these next events with 100% fidelity, but I'll try to describe them as best as possible.

Ever since around 2015 (I was 10) during some arguments that my parents had with each other, my father would sometimes barge into the bedroom where me and my brother were in, and he would start screaming to my mother that he was leaving, while packing his luggage right there, and I don't even know how my brother reacted at all in those situations, but I remember crying and screaming begging my father to not leave.

Until early 2017. That time both of my parents had yet another argument where my father packed his luggage while making us watch, but that time my mother actually made him leave.

Later that year my grandmother fell very ill, it sometimes happened once every few years and my mother went there to take care of her, this would eventually lead to my grandmother going to live with me, my brother and my mother.

Not long after, after an argument between my brother and my mother, my brother who I always relied upon finally moved out of the house, going to live at my father's place, which now was the house where my grandmother lived at (he was renting there), and a few months later, my brother eventually moved to his own place.

And because of different health necessities that my grandmother had for sleeping, she took the double sized bed that my parents used to sleep at, then my mother couldn't sleep at the living room (it connects to the rest of the house, has 0 privacy and is right next to the bathroom that my grandma needs to use constantly) so she went to sleep at my room and I went to sleep at the living room, essentially losing the only secure and private place I had till this day.

I could add to how difficult it was living with my grandmother, but I won't, because she might've been seriously difficult to deal with, and still is, she's very dependant on an emotional level, very manipulative (faking health issues, saying that she will harm herself so my mother or me have to come running) and pretty often has tantrums like a kid. But I still love her, and I don't want to make this story even longer.

So after all that, things were already pretty rough, and my life had changed 180° but I'm not finished, during like the middle of 2017, I started visiting my father, and we chatted, and walked a bit, I don't remember very well the details, but what I do remember was the moment where everything got so fucked up. So, my father that day started telling to 12 year old me that he was trying to reconnect with my mother but everything he did was in vail, she always rejected him with anger, and STUPID 12 year old me thought that it would be a great idea to help, so I asked him ""Why not give her some space?"" he did so, and next time that I went to visit him, he said that it worked (nowadays I'm not sure if he was lying) and started treating me not like his son, but in his own words ""like a friend"".

And after that, he started telling me EVERYTHING my mother and him talked, from the good, to the bad, to the topics that you would normally find pretty gross to talk with (sex, accusations of cheating).

So now I knew every argument they had, every insult they said to each other, I even knew that my mother threatened my father with a restriction order, and not only that, but my father was also a really manipulative person, and he was constantly telling me stuff like lies in order of making me be against my mother.

That year was seriously tough, felt like I lost the family I once thought I had, my perception of both my mother and father completly changed, I lost all my privacy, and I didn't have anyone I could feel like I could count on.

Through the years, this stuff kept going, problems at home with my mother and grandma, problems outside with my father, I was starting highschool and I didn't even know how things were going to fold out outside of the school, I was already stressed tf out. I even remember asking my father around early 2018 to stop showing me the conversations he had with my mother, and he practically started having a tantrum in the middle of the street, saying that I don't love him, and that he will die alone, I didn't even know how to respond to this, so I went back with what I asked him.

And things kept going like this up until 2019, he went back with my mother and they started going out once again (many years later my mother confessed me that it was because of the pressure and that she didn't want him to keep putting me and my brother in the middle of this problem), my father was completly different in front of my mother, pretty gentlemanly, never disagreeing with her, but he kept showing me their conversations and now that he was going out with my mother, he was way colder than before, and less ""friendly"".

And things went on during the next years, they were still kinda rough, I was already dealing with lots of stuff from past years, and while yes, things looked like they were calmer, in reality, all the arguments they had with me now started from air, and were really really bad, one day I just couldn't even keep up with it, and while they both were yelling at me, I just ran away from home, I was feeling terrible, I was crying and I was feeling like I was lacking air, and so I walked towards a park close to my house to cry in peace for a while, meanwhile I got some messages from my father saying that I was in the wrong and asked me to come back home so we could talk. I just ignored him and stayed in that bench where I was crying for a while longer, I started texting some friends asking how they were doing, not wanting to show them in what state I was in, but wanting to feel comforted by just talking to them a bit.

Until I got a message from my brother, where he asked me where I was, I told him, and he called an uber to come take me to his apartment, so I stayed there for 3 days in total, where we talked the situation, and eventually he convinced me to go back home and tell our parents that I was sorry for running away.

Time went on, eventually the pandemic came and I stayed at my mother's place with my grandma while my father stayed at my grandma's old apartment. The years eventually passed by as notmal, with the same stuff as the years before, but a little toned down.

Until at the end of 2023, a few weeks before christmas, my mother cut out my father for good, at that time I was already at university and working, so my father told me what happened one day I was leaving of work, at that time I felt so fed up with that shit, that I cut him off, apologized because I knew that it was a stong topic, and asked him to just stop narrating me all his arguments with my mother, he got really angry, and had a similar moment like in 2018 where he said that I do not care for him and that he will die alone, etc.

I spent christmas and new years with my mother and grandma, I just didn't want to go see him at that time, I was actually really fed up with what he wanted to tell me. 

A few weeks later I decided to start visiting him, mostly to check on him, have a chat with him, and see what he's doing, at the end of the day, I still love him beucase he's my father, despite him acting so much like a fucker.

And so I spent like a year visiting almost every weekend, sometimes we went to drink a coffee, sometimes we went out to eat something, or we went to the cinema, or we just stayed home, I even spent 2024's christmas and new year with him.

But he never truly changed, not only did he keep telling me everything he argued with my mother via chat, he also started acting like a poor victim that will die alone and as if my mother was so evil, when she started dating someone else, he did some kind of reverse search or something using his photos from my mother's instagram stories to try and find some info on that guy. He moved right in front of my mother's workplace. He even tried to make me believe that my mother was having an affair prior to her cutting him off. During one of the first months, he even told me that he wanted to kill himself. And if I didn't went to check on him for a couple of consecutive weeks he got super mad, saying that if something were to happen to him I wouldn't know until it was too late.

Things got out of control at June 15 of this year, this is the last time I had a direct contact with him, I once again didn't visit him for like 3 weeks because I had exams (and also I didn't enjoy spending time with him anymore), and when I came back, he went back to try and guilt trip me saying that I do not love him, if something were to happen to him I wouldn't even notice, etc. That day I lost my cool, had a real argument with him in years and never came back after that.



And that's the backstory, nowadays I try to live my life as cheerfully as possible, distracting myself with videogames, music, going out with friends, making bad jokes and laughting at them, etc.

But sometimes, when I'm not doing any of that, I can't help but remember all the stuff that happened in the past and feel really depressed and sad, or remember how I turned my back against my own father and feel really guilty, sometimes waking up from the bed is really hard, and thoughts of self harming or more are not infrequent, but still, I wouldn't do that, maybe it's just caused becuase I normally don't sleep enough but still. 

I feel like my life is going nowhere, and there's stuff that I want to do, like developing my own games, but as soon as I go in front of my pc I lose all motivation.

And I feel that thanks to all the shit that happened before, talking face to face with other people it's harder than ever before, I feel way more shy than I ever was.",1,1760418527.0,TrueOffMyChest,1,1.0,False

# Espresso Machine Essentials

[Espresso machines](https://gomehedi.com/best-espresso-machines/) bring café-quality coffee right to your kitchen. Understanding the essentials helps you choose and use the right machine. It also keeps your espresso tasting fresh and rich. This section covers key points to get started with your espresso machine.

# Choosing The Right Machine

Start by deciding how often you will use the machine. Small machines suit occasional use and limited space. Larger, more complex machines fit daily heavy use. Consider features like built-in grinders or milk frothers. Budget matters. Find a machine that balances cost and features. Simpler machines offer control but require skill. Automatic machines are easier for beginners.

# Machine Components

Know the parts of your espresso machine. The portafilter holds the coffee grounds during brewing. The boiler heats water to the perfect temperature. The pump creates the pressure needed to extract espresso. The steam wand froths milk for lattes and cappuccinos. A water reservoir stores water before brewing. Each part plays a role in making good espresso.

# Maintenance Tips

Clean your machine regularly to avoid bad tastes and damage. Rinse the portafilter and baskets after each use. Backflush the machine weekly to remove coffee oils. Descale the boiler monthly if your water is hard. Wipe the steam wand after every use to prevent clogging. Proper care extends your machine’s life and keeps coffee fresh.

# Coffee Beans And Grind

Making espresso with a machine starts with choosing the right coffee beans and grind. These two factors affect the flavor, strength, and crema of your espresso. Understanding how to select beans, grind size, and store your coffee helps you brew a rich, balanced shot every time.

# Selecting Beans For Espresso

Pick beans that suit espresso’s bold taste. Dark roast beans are popular for espresso. They offer a strong, rich flavor and less acidity. Some prefer medium roasts for more complex flavors. Arabica beans are common for their smooth taste. Robusta beans add more caffeine and crema. Experiment with blends to find what you enjoy most.

# Grind Size Importance

Grind size is key for espresso extraction. The grind must be very fine, almost like powdered sugar. Too coarse a grind makes the espresso weak and watery. Too fine can block the machine and cause bitterness. Adjust grind size to control the flow rate and taste. Use a quality burr grinder for even particle size.

# Freshness And Storage

Fresh coffee beans deliver the best espresso taste. Beans start to lose flavor soon after roasting. Buy small amounts of freshly roasted beans. Store beans in an airtight container away from light, heat, and moisture. Avoid keeping beans in the fridge or freezer, as this can cause condensation. Grind your beans just before brewing for maximum freshness.

# Preparing For The Shot

Preparing for the shot is a key step in making great espresso with a machine. It sets the foundation for the flavor and quality of your espresso. Paying attention to the details before brewing will improve your results. Focus on measuring the coffee, applying the right tamping pressure, and using the proper water temperature and quality. These small actions create a big difference in taste and texture.

# Measuring Coffee Grounds

Use a precise scale to measure coffee grounds. The ideal amount is usually 18 to 20 grams for a double shot. Too much or too little coffee changes the strength and flavor. Fresh coffee grounds give the best taste. Measure every time to keep consistency.

# Tamping Techniques

Tamping means pressing the coffee grounds evenly in the portafilter. Use a flat tamper that fits well. Apply firm, even pressure around 30 pounds. Press straight down to avoid uneven extraction. A good tamp creates resistance for water to flow slowly. This helps the espresso develop rich flavor and crema.

# Water Temperature And Quality

Water temperature should be between 195°F and 205°F (90°C to 96°C). Too hot or too cold water affects taste. Use filtered water for the best results. Hard water can damage your machine and change flavor. Clean water ensures the purest espresso taste and keeps your machine safe.

# Pulling The Perfect Shot

Pulling the perfect shot is the heart of making great espresso. It requires attention to detail and control of key factors. Each shot tells a story of your skill and the coffee’s quality. Small changes can make a big difference in flavor and texture.

Understanding the timing, volume, and visual cues helps you craft espresso that tastes balanced and rich. Practice and patience lead to consistently excellent results.

# Extracting Time

The ideal extraction time is usually between 25 and 30 seconds. This range allows the water to pass through the coffee evenly. Too fast means under-extraction, which tastes sour and weak. Too slow leads to over-extraction, making the espresso bitter.

Start your shot and watch the clock closely. Adjust your grind size or tamp pressure to keep extraction time steady.

# Shot Volume

A standard espresso shot is about 1 ounce (30 ml). For a double shot, aim for 2 ounces (60 ml). Measure the volume to maintain consistency.

Too little volume results in a strong but thin espresso. Too much volume dilutes flavor and weakens the crema.

Use your machine’s settings or a small measuring cup to track the shot size.

# Visual And Taste Indicators

Good espresso has a thick, golden crema on top. The crema should be smooth and caramel-colored. It shows proper extraction and freshness.

The espresso should taste balanced. Look for sweetness, a bit of bitterness, and a smooth finish. If it tastes burnt or sour, adjust your grind or extraction time.

Observe the flow: it should start slow, then steady, and stop smoothly. A thin or fast flow signals a problem with your grind or tamp.

# Common Issues And Fixes

Making espresso with a machine is rewarding but can present challenges. Common issues often affect the taste and quality of your espresso. Understanding these problems helps you fix them quickly. This section covers typical extraction problems and how to adjust your settings for better results.

# Under-extraction Problems

Under-extracted espresso tastes sour and weak. It happens when water passes through coffee too fast. The coffee grind may be too coarse or dose too small. Extraction time might be too short. Fix this by using a finer grind and increasing the dose. Also, check the tamping pressure to ensure even extraction.

# Over-extraction Signs

Over-extracted espresso tastes bitter and harsh. This occurs when water flows too slowly or stays too long in the coffee. The grind may be too fine or the dose too large. Extraction time might be too long. To fix, use a coarser grind and reduce the coffee dose. Clean your machine regularly to avoid buildup that slows water flow.

# Adjusting Grind And Dose

Grind size and dose directly affect espresso quality. Start with a medium-fine grind. Adjust grind size based on taste and extraction time. Increase dose for stronger espresso but avoid overpacking. Use a scale to measure coffee dose accurately. Small changes in grind or dose can improve flavor significantly. Experiment patiently to find the right balance.

# Alternative Espresso Methods

Espresso machines are the classic way to make espresso, but some people do not have access to one. There are other tools and methods to make a strong coffee similar to espresso. These alternatives do not create the exact pressure of an espresso machine but can give a rich and bold coffee experience. They are often affordable and easy to use. Let’s explore some popular methods that make a concentrated coffee shot without an espresso machine.

# Using A Moka Pot

The Moka pot is a stovetop coffee maker. It uses steam pressure to push hot water through coffee grounds. This creates a strong and thick coffee. The Moka pot is easy to use and clean. Fill the bottom chamber with water. Add finely ground coffee to the filter basket. Assemble the pot and heat it on the stove. The coffee will collect in the top chamber. It is not true espresso but has a similar bold flavor. The Moka pot is a favorite for many espresso lovers without machines.

# Aeropress Espresso Style

The Aeropress is a small, portable coffee maker. It uses air pressure to push water through coffee grounds quickly. This method can produce a rich, espresso-like coffee. Use finely ground coffee for a stronger taste. Add hot water and stir for about 10 seconds. Press the plunger down slowly to extract the coffee. The result is a smooth and concentrated brew. The Aeropress is versatile and simple. It is great for making espresso-style coffee at home or on the go.

# Drip Coffee Maker Hacks

Standard drip coffee makers cannot make true espresso. They lack the pressure needed for it. But you can still make a stronger coffee using a few tricks. Use a finer coffee grind than usual. Add more coffee grounds to the filter. Use less water than normal to concentrate the flavor. Brew as usual and enjoy a richer cup. This method will not replace an espresso machine but helps create a bolder coffee. It is an easy way to get closer to espresso taste with what you have.

# Enhancing Your Espresso

Enhancing your espresso brings new joy to every cup you make. Small changes can improve taste and appearance. These simple steps turn a plain espresso into a rich and creamy delight. Enjoy learning easy ways to add texture and flavor to your coffee experience.

# Steaming Milk Basics

Steaming milk adds creaminess and warmth to your espresso. Use cold milk for best results. Fill the pitcher to one-third with milk. Place the steam wand just below the surface. Turn on the steam and move the pitcher slowly. Heat until the milk reaches 150°F (65°C). Avoid boiling the milk to keep it smooth. Practice makes the texture soft and velvety.

# Creating Latte Art

Latte art makes your espresso visually appealing. Pour steamed milk slowly into the espresso. Start from a little height, then get closer as you pour. Use gentle wrist movements to create patterns. Common designs include hearts, rosettas, and tulips. Perfect your technique by watching your milk flow. Latte art adds a personal touch to your coffee.

# Experimenting With Flavors

Add flavors to customize your espresso taste. Try vanilla, caramel, or hazelnut syrups in small amounts. Sprinkle cinnamon or cocoa powder on top for extra aroma. Use flavored extracts carefully to not overpower the coffee. Cold milk or cream can balance strong flavors. Experiment with natural ingredients for new tastes. Changing flavors keeps your espresso exciting every time.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

* As stated in the title, this is the ONLY item in the dishwasher that comes out looking like this.
* It happens every time. This isn't a random one-off occurrence.
* The spots are NOT coffee. Sometimes coffee isn't even used in this mug.
* I'm not entirely convinced that it is related to food/drink residue at all.
* The mug does NOT go in looking like this (in case you're thinking the dishwasher isn't working and therefore leaving the mug dirty).
* Said another way: The dishwasher itself works fine.
* I am thinking that it is some kind of reaction happening to the glaze of the mug (??? - but if so, why???)
* It doesn't happen to the inside of the mug. Only the outside. Perhaps it has something to do with the printing process used for the graphic?
* This is the only mug I have of this kind, and it is not from a set, so I can't say whether the problem is a batch issue from the manufacturer or unique to this mug. I am guessing that if I had two, they would both do this. I do have other graphic mugs, and they don't do this.  
* The spots DO rub off. This is not a permanent thing - which is why I find it so strange to think that it is a glaze issue.

Part 1 linked in comment section. 

Pickup Story:
Made a day trip down to a small island which these pans had called home for the last many years. It was windy, the beach was ok, the dog had fun, the coffee was expensive. 

The seller’s story:
The pots were bought from a city much further north. Brought to this island for display purposes. Although seller lived with a chef, these lived their lives on a cabinet. Aesthetic beach house vibes I guess. They also had a Ruffoni set, never used, only for aesthetic. 

The Pans:
Three pans. Unstamped. Brass drilled handles. Hammered, including base. Copper rivets, flush inner surface. 

They had my attention. 

The internal lining had not been well pictured prior to pickup. It was well oxidised but intact. I decided to try cleaning them up gently instead of an acid bath. 

As display pieces, they were lacquered. I anticipated this being difficult to remove but a soak in warm water with Bi-Carb Soda and the film could be peeled away. Satisfying. Picture included for your pleasure.

Unstamped. I had thought a stamp may appear. Concealed by lacquer and worn down with age. Alas not. Instead the pans revealed a well preserved hammer pattern, with little oxidisation on the copper. Thanks lacquer, you did your service but it was time for you to go. 

I then turned my attention to the inner lining. Oxidised and maybe a little black food stuff. After a soapy scrub with the most delicate of scouters, I decided a little chemistry was required. Time for aluminium to do its duty. A boiling bath of Bi-Carb and aluminium foil. The oxidisation thinned out. A light scrub with blue scourer and a small dusting of Bar Keeper’s Friend. Voila! The lining intact and shining for my own aesthetic needs.

Their origin? Uncertain. Commenters on Post 1 had ideas. 

The hammered base is nice and maybe a tell of their intended use. I don’t have callipers but weights are available in the previous post.

The Rivets. I haven’t seen the outside rivet heads be tinned before. Yet here they are. I welcome your commentary on this detail!

Will I re-tin them? Maybe, not immediately. The surface is smooth. They didn’t wear out easily under the scrub. Maybe they’re nickel lined?The last photo demonstrates where the lining is not perfect but I think perhaps still functional enough for now. Thinning but ready to serve. 


In conclusion,
I am happy with these three pans. They’re a functional size for me. They seem well made. I am partial to brass handles despite their shortcomings. The thickness seems forte enough for me. They will make a fine addition to my collection. 


TLDR: three sauté pans with photos for your enjoyment.

(Prolly trigger warning),"My sister was recently going through some old videos and we found a video of my family at great wolf lodge eating dinner for what I later realized was my birthday. I have been having flashbacks for years now of what feels like increasingly worse truama and have been open about some of it with my family for a while now. My aunts boyfriend was there along with my aunt, mom, dad, and sister. The camera flashes at me immediately and the first thing I noticed was the fear in my eyes i was about 5 years old wearing a short white dress. I look horrified. Then In front of everyone the man behind the camera says he loves me. I couldnt even remember his voice, I mean I can but its something that resides in the back of my head like a voice echoing in an empty mall, living in the similar part that my grandfathers voice does. Then he shows his face and its my aunts boyfriend (they never got married she broke up with him a couple years later)
The video continues as my dad grabs the camera and is pointing it at my aunts boyfriend who is  forcing me onto his lap and kissing my face trying his hardest to kiss me on the lips. I push him away from me and get off of him, everyone is watching this and no one does anything. My dad is recording this and does literally nothing as my aunts boyfriend glares at me for rejecting him. The only reason I got off his lap is so they could sing happy birthday to me. This man's name is all over my journal he also has the same name as my father weirdly enough. He was overly affectionate, I remember how he made me feel, how some of my parts thought thats what love was.
Tbh this is just one of the things that has caused me flashbacks the last couple of weeks. All of them make me feel like this is just too ridiculous to be real. Like all of this? Happening to one person cause my grandfather practically trafficked me? I mean one of my aunts killed herself when she was 17 after she told her teacher that her father was r***** her (the grandfather that parts of me have said SAed us)

*Witness account of a World Bank agent* 

The Republic of Guatemala sees the start of its 5th year under the leadership of President Juan José Arévalo. It has been 5 years since the Guatemalan Revolution in 1944 toppled the Dictatorship of Jorge Ubico. Under the leadership of Juan José Arévalo, Guatemala has seen an explosion in political activities, union organization, and civil liberties. These tenants of democracy have been protected under his government. President Arévalo, a charismatic figure, has led his nation firmly for five years. President Arévalo has not led without opposition. Would be dictators and overly ambitious army officers have attempted over 20 coups against the man but to no avail. The Arévalo Administration, for all the opposition it faces from elements of the right wing within its military, endures. 

Amidst these years, the Presidency of Arévalo has seen significant social and labour reforms. The minimum wage has seen increases in these past years. Social security has been established. A labor code has been promulgated which gives urban and rural workers the right to strike and protects them against unfair dismissal. Arévalo's administration has also moved to regulate banking and monetary practices. Some underdeveloped foreign estates have seen their land redistribued to peasants. 

Arévalo has made education and public healthcare a national priority. And it is these sectors must surely reveal a troubling reality to Arévalo himself - these reforms simply are not *enough.*

Even as early as 1939, Arévalo had diligently written *""All educational reform will ultimately fail unless laws and government help to eliminate all types of economic exploitation.""* 

A quote that has been forgotten by the man since he assumed office. Across Guatemala, the native Maya peasantry remains vastly illiterate and excluded from the majority of social reforms enacted by Arévalo's administration. What good is the minimum wage and social security if the peasantry lacks the means to access and understand their new rights? What good are civil liberties and voting rights if the illiterate peasant must be watched while casting his vote? If he does not understand the newspaper that present the political choices? 

The basis for the ills of Guatemala hail from the large amounts of illiteracy within its native population. In 1949, 90% of Mayan schoolchildren do not attend school. 70% of the wider population is illiterate. The wealthiest 2% still control three quarters of the land, regardless of the land redistribution in former foreign estates. Attempts at agrarian reform in the form of Fincas Nacionales (130 coffee estates controlled by the government which produce around 25% of Guatemala's coffee for export) have fallen into mismanagement and are rife with corrupt overseers. The state has been deprived of much needed income from this mismanagement and siphoning of funds. 

In order to hide away from these ills, President Arévalo has funneled several million dollars into the creation of an agricultural colony in the Town of Poptún, within the Department of El Petén. Since then transportation expenses, inefficiency, and corruption have ensured the project remains unfinished. In February 1949, only around a hundred colonialists will be found at Poptún attempting to cultivate the land. 

Even Arévalo's claims at having promoted labor unions are rife with suspicion. It is true that in the towns and Guatemala City the labour unions have made strong returns to social life. Yet in the countryside, where the millions of Guatemalan peasants toil, labour unions find themselves repressed at the grasp of a whip. The peasantry lacks the land necessary to sustain families, forcing many to become cheap wage laborers for the larger estates. As a result, while the minimum wage has risen in other sectors of the economy, wages for the agricultural worker have fallen from this influx of new desperate labour. 

Arévalo is not blind to these defaults - neither the man nor the Revolutionary Action Party (PAR) which he is supported by are completely blind to these failings. 1949 will see a new year of attempted reforms - although they will undoubtedly fall short of the transformation necessary to overcome the landinos, the church, the right wing forces in the military and the inequality produced by the current system. 

February 1949 has not seen new government edicts or bills to enforce reforms - instead President Arévalo has turned his energies into funneling his charisma to guide national development. If reports are to be believed, his government has initiated a campaign of national mobilization which seeks to send young students, teachers, and educated individuals forth from the cities to the countryside. Around a million US dollars are being spent on a campaign to send literate youngsters and teachers forth into the countryside to teach the peasantry the basics of reading and writing Spanish. 

President Arévalo has revealed this campaign in local speeches across the country. This eight month long planned effort intends to see the mobilization of some 100,000 volunteer teachers, students, and learned individuals to be sent forth into the countryside to establish basic literacy schools. The government is using its funds to encourage weekly efforts in spreading literacy to surrounding villages and using those same funds to sustain the presence of volunteer teachers into the countryside. 

As comes typical of Arévalo, the man has used boisterous words and national feelings to drive forth his legions of volunteers. To crowds of would be volunteer teachers (many of them youngsters), Arévalo proclaims firmly that their mission is a civic duty. A neccesity in order to bring the light of education to the unenlighted peasant and transform them into a full citizen of the state. He proudly declares that his volunteer crowds are serving their fellow man and country through their volunteer work in the fields. 

This campaign, while undoubtedly loud and ambitions, also reflects the sad truth. President Arévalo is adverse to the structural reforms needed to transform the nation. The man has laid the foundations of reform - but it will require another force entirely to truly bring the change necessary that will help stabilize the country and wrest it at last from the vestiges of its almost feudal state of affairs.

*1 March 1949* 

--- 
--- 

&nbsp;

> The essence of Islam is intention, prayer, and other basics. If you do these things, nobody can be a better Muslim than you. 

— Muhammad ibn Ali al-Senussi, c. 1837. 

&nbsp;

--- 
--- 

###I. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND 

--- 
--- 

Sayyid Muhammad Idris al-Senussi is not only head of state of the newly-declared Emirate of Cyrenaica [see [*Libya, a primer*, I.3](https://www.reddit.com/r/ColdWarPowers/comments/1o56qku/news_libya_a_primer/)]; he is also spiritual head of the Senussite Brotherhood, a Sufi order founded in 1837 by his grandfather Muhammad ibn Ali al-Senussi. 

The founder al-Senussi eschewed the ecstatic practices, esoteric doctrines, and elaborate hierarchies characteristic of many other Sufi orders, teaching instead a *tariqa* (or “path” toward intimate knowledge of God) of highly disciplined and intentional but basically mainstream Muslim devotion. His approach to the Qur’an and *hadith* was rigorous, but down-to-earth and pragmatic. He required his followers to abstain totally from alcohol, tobacco, coffee, and ostentatious displays of wealth, and to renounce such pre-Islamic customs as animistic divination and the infanticide of unwanted female children. Al-Senussi made particular efforts to broker peace between clans that had been at war, calling them to unity on the basis of their common profession of Islam. Under his leadership, Senussitism quickly became a powerful, positive social force among the nomads and semi-nomads of the Libyan desert. 

The basic unit of the Brotherhood was never the individual brother, but the *zawiya*. Translated “lodge” (or more literally “nook”), the *zawiya* (plural *zawaya*) is a kind of community centre, one of which was established in every town or among every desert clan that accepted al-Senussi’s teachings. The typical *zawiya* complex includes a mosque, classrooms for religious education (which included of course basic Arabic literacy), lodging for travellers and storehouses for goods in transit, agricultural lands, and a communal bakery. Beginning in the early 20th century, the *zawaya* began also to serve as armories, dealing and stockpiling small arms (including leftovers from the Mahdist War in neighbouring Sudan). The public and multipurpose character of the *zawiya* made it a pillar of its local community; and at the same time, the network of *zawaya* formed a thick regional infrastructure that supported Senussites in their mercantile, missionary, and (eventually) military activities. 

Cyrenaica was always the heartland of Senussitism, but the order was never by any means confined to that region. By the late 19th century, Senussites could be found all across North Africa, from Morocco to Egypt; and beyond, as far east as Senegal, as far south as Lake Chad, and as far west as Somalia and the Hejaz. But the movement’s international growth halted in the early 20th century, as the Senussites of Libya turned all their energies to the long and costly *jihad* against Italian colonization. In December 1930, as part of its genocidal repression of native Libyans and their independence struggle [see [*Libya, a primer*, I.2](https://www.reddit.com/r/ColdWarPowers/comments/1o56qku/news_libya_a_primer/)], the Italian government ordered the forcible closure of all the *zawaya* in the colony, confiscating their property. 

--- 
--- 

###II. REBUILDING THE SENUSSITE MOVEMENT 

--- 
--- 

###II.1 Reopening the *Zawaya* 

Idris cannot match his grandfather as a leader of men, a religious scholar, or an ascetic. But he is a passably devout Senussite, and feels keenly his responsibility to maintain and strengthen the legacy of his family and of his order. And of course, he hopes that a strong Senussite Brotherhood (with strong personal loyalty to him) will be a great para-state resource for consolidating power in Cyrenaica, and for projecting power and influence throughout the region. 

As a first step toward strengthening the Senussite movement, Idris is making it his first priority to reopen the Libyan *zawaya*. As Emir, he has issued a decree reversing the 1930 confiscation within Cyrenaica, and restoring all *zawaya* properties to the local brothers; and as head of the Brotherhood, he has commanded his followers to resume as much as possible their pre-War activities. The agricultural lands attached to the lodges were in some cases distributed to Italian settlers, but only a handful of these remain in Cyrenaica [see [*Libya, a primer*, II.5](https://www.reddit.com/r/ColdWarPowers/comments/1o56qku/news_libya_a_primer/)]. Idris’ orders are that the few Italian settlers still in occupation of confiscated lands should, for the time being, be left unmolested; but that the brothers should vigorously reassert their right to any *unoccupied* lands. 

In Tripolitania and Fezzan, Idris’ civil decree does not apply, but his orders to the brothers are much the same. In Fezzan, there was never any Italian settlement, and the native population are overwhelmingly Senussite; so, barring interference from the French military administration, there should be no major obstacles to the reopening of the *zawaya*. In Tripolitania, there are many more Italian settlers, and the question of what will happen to them and their properties is unresolved and highly sensitive. The British military administration would certainly look very unkindly on any attempts to expropriate them. But the Senussite presence in Tripolitania was always much smaller than in Cyrenaica; in consequence of which, confiscation of *zawaya* lands was never a major source of securing lands for Italian settlement. Only a couple of the shuttered *zawaya* in Tripolitania ended up occupied by settlers, and Idris thinks it should be possible for the brothers to reassert control of the others without incident. 

Surviving *zawaya* outside Libya will of course remain open. 

| Region | # of *zawaya* | Major *zawaya* | 
|:--|:--:|:--| 
| Cyrenaica | 51 | Benghazi, Bayda, Derna, Awjila, Jaghbub, Jawf, Taj | 
| Tripolitania | 15 | Tripoli, Misrata, Hun | 
| Fezzan | 17 | Ghadames, Murzuk, Ghat | 
| Western Egypt | 30 | Sidi Barrani, Umm al-Rakham, Qarah (Siwa), Bawiti (Bahariya), Qasr (Dakhla) | 
| French Equatorial Africa (Chad) | 10 | Bardaï | 
| Hejaz | 17 | Medina, Abu Qubays (Mecca) | 

In principle, every *zawiya* is self-supporting through its own agricultural yield; but of course it will take time for recovered lands to return to their previous level of productivity. In the meantime, Idris has mandated an extraordinary source of supplementary funding. In every community where the Senussites are present, the brothers collect *zakat* (alms) from the larger community, for redistribution to the local poor. These monies are not normally intended for the support for the brothers; but Idris has issued a *fatwa* to the effect that, for the next five years, up to 50% of the *zakat* may be appropriated by the lodge to cover operational costs. 

--- 

###II.2 Leadership Structure 

A second step, which will affect the Brotherhood both inside and outside Libya, is to strengthen local and central leadership. To this end, Idris is mandating a modified revival of the late-19th century leadership structure, according to which each *zawiya* will managed by three officers: 

1. Every lodge will be led by a *sheikh* (“elder,” plural *shuyookh*). He is chosen by acclamation of the local brothers, and therefore usually identical with the head of the local clan. 
2. He will be assisted by a *wakil* (“deputy,” plural *wukala*), appointed by the head of the order. Several decades of intense armed struggle inside Libya mean that the local talent pool is somewhat reduced, and tends to have a more martial than scholarly skillset. To make up for this, many of the Libyan lodges will be supplied with *wukala* from Western Egypt and the Hejaz, where the brothers have lately been able to receive a more well-rounded religious and legal education. Leading prayers and preaching are the prerogative of the *sheikh*, but in practice he will often share these duties with his *wakil*. 
3. Finally, an *agha* (“elder brother”) will be appointed by the *sheikh* to serve as a kind of administrative assistant *cum* drill sergeant. Idris has directed that fitness drill (and, where local conditions permit, discrete armed drill) should be a regular part of the life of the *zawaya*, and oversight of the same will be one of the *agha*’s major responsibilities. 

Idris is also reviving the Majlis, an annual gathering of leading *shuyookh* from major *zawaya* around the Senussite world, serving as a kind of executive council under the presidence of the head of the order. A true international gathering like this has not been possible in many years, but Idris plans to convene the Majlis in Benghazi this September, in what will be an important assertion of his leadership and an important symbol of the Brotherhood’s post-war renewal. 

--- 

###II.3 Consolidating the Senussite Legacy 

Finally, Idris is taking some small steps to manage the wartime legacy of the order, with a view to cementing the association between the Brotherhood and the pro-independence struggle across Libya, and bolstering his own (somewhat checkered) personal record as a freedom fighter. [On the latter, see [*Libya, a primer*, I.2](https://www.reddit.com/r/ColdWarPowers/comments/1o56qku/news_libya_a_primer/).] 

One important move will be the reinterment of Omar al-Mukhtar, the great hero of the Senussite *jihad* against Italian imperialism. After his hanging at the Soluq concentration camp in 1931, al-Mukhtar was discretely buried in an unmarked grave in the cemetary of Benghazi. But in 1941, the gravedigger made public the location of the martyr’s grave. Idris has now ordered the exhumation of al-Mukhtar’s remains for reburial in a mausoleum on the grounds of the *zawiya* of Benghazi, with a public funeral to be held on 16 September 1949 (the 18th anniversary of his death). The ceremony will coincide with the convocation of the Majlis that month, so that representatives from all the leading *zawaya* may conveniently be present. All of this is intended to assert the specifically Senussite character of this national hero’s struggle and martyrdom. 

Other important burial sites include Jaghbub, which served as the Brotherhood’s mother-lodge from 1853 until 1895; and where both the great founder himself, and Idris’ cousin Ahmed Sharif as-Senussi (who was also his immediate predecessor as leader of the order) are buried; and the *zawiya* of Taj, in the Kufra Oasis, which served as mother-lodge from 1895 through both World Wars, and is the burial site of Idris’ father Muhammad al-Mahdi al-Senussi. In reopening these *zawaya*, special attention will be taken to restore the graves of these saintly men to a dignity befitting the Senussi name.",3,1760416798.0,ColdWarPowers,0,1.0,False

With all that said I’ve been speaking to an agency and they have set up a meeting with someone at the end of this week. It would be two mornings of four hours where they would come to my house - honestly for half that time baby would be sleeping. 

This would be only until early next year when our spot in occasional care opens. Budget wise it’s very achievable for us.

For nearly a decade I lived in a body that made no sense.
If I got warm or anxious, my skin would sting and erupt in prickly hives (cholinergic urticaria).
If it was cold, my hands and feet turned ghost-white and numb (Raynaud’s).
And no matter the temperature, my hands and feet were always cold — yet constantly sweating.

Doctors called them “unrelated” — autoimmune, circulatory, idiopathic.
Nothing worked.
Then I started working with a qualified Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) healer who ran a full tongue and pulse diagnosis, created custom herbal formulas, and treated me with weekly acupuncture.

Within just one and a half months, every symptom vanished — all within the first phase of treatment.
And for the first time in over ten years, I no longer needed coffee or Vyvanse, because my energy and focus returned naturally.
I’m now moving into Phases 2 and 3 to solidify and rebuild my Yin and Jing for long-term stability.

⸻

☕ How I got here

For years, my routine was: wake up, coffee on an empty stomach, skip breakfast, power through the day fasting until late afternoon — usually with iced drinks.
I thought it was discipline. In reality, I was burning my system down from the inside out.

From a TCM perspective, that combination wrecks the body’s inner balance:
	•	Coffee on an empty stomach overdrives Yang Qi and scatters it upward.
	•	Fasting weakens Spleen Qi, impairing digestion and fluid metabolism.
	•	Cold drinks extinguish digestive Fire, letting fluids congeal into Dampness.

Over years, this turned into Damp-Heat accumulation and Yin deficiency — the perfect storm for my symptoms.
Internally overheated, externally cold, Qi trapped in the middle — classic Damp-Heat with deficient Yin.

⸻

🔹 My TCM diagnosis

My healer explained that my body was like a sealed pot under pressure:
	•	Damp-Heat trapped in the middle and upper body → prickly heat, flushing, and sweating.
	•	Yin deficiency → no internal coolant to stabilize temperature.
	•	Qi stagnation and weak Yang circulation → hands and feet icy cold, yet sweating constantly.

My tongue confirmed it — red center with yellow greasy coat, pale edges, and cracks.
The diagnosis: Damp-Heat with underlying Yin deficiency and impaired Spleen-Kidney communication.

🔹 The TCM treatment plan that worked

This wasn’t random self-experimentation — my TCM healer monitored my progress every week through tongue diagnosis and acupuncture, adjusting formulas as needed.

Phase 1 – Clear Damp-Heat and strengthen digestion (current phase — achieved full symptom relief here)
(Shen Ling Bai Zhu San + custom modifications)
	•	Drained internal Dampness, rebuilt digestive Fire, and restored Spleen Qi.
	•	Ate warm, cooked meals three times daily at consistent times.
	•	Only warm boiled water — no cold drinks, ever.
	•	Weekly acupuncture supported Qi flow through Spleen, Kidney, and Liver channels.
	•	After about 1.5 months, all symptoms were gone: no more rashes, no more Raynaud’s, and my hands and feet became warm and dry.

Phase 2 – Nourish Yin and clear residual Heat (next stage)
(Zhi Bai Di Huang Wan)
	•	To gently replenish Yin fluids and stabilize the gains from Phase 1.
	•	Balances warmth and cooling internally while preventing new Damp formation.

Phase 3 – Deep restoration of Jing and Yin (final consolidation)
(Zuo Gui Wan + continued acupuncture)
	•	To rebuild Kidney Essence, strengthen the core, and make the recovery permanent.
	•	Will include ongoing acupuncture and light warming teas (like ginger–chen pi) to keep the middle Jiao strong and prevent relapse.

⸻

🔹 The results so far — full remission in Phase 1
	•	No prickly heat or urticaria.
	•	Hands and feet now stay naturally warm and dry, even in cold weather.
	•	Sweating normalized.
	•	Energy steady — completely off coffee and Vyvanse, with no fatigue or brain fog.
	•	Tongue: pink, moist, thin white coat — sign of healthy internal balance.
	•	Sleep deep, mood calm, digestion smooth, circulation open.

⸻

🔹 Lifestyle changes that made the difference
	•	Warm, cooked meals three times daily.
	•	Warm boiled water only — no cold or iced drinks.
	•	Gentle walking or qigong after meals.
	•	No fasting, no stimulants, no skipping meals.
	•	Consistent meal times to support Spleen rhythm.
	•	Occasional tonic teas with Huang Jing and Gou Qi Zi to sustain Yin and Jing.

⸻

🔹 What I learned
	•	Long-term fasting and caffeine drain Yin and injure Spleen Yang — the silent root of “mystery” health issues.
	•	Cold hands and feet with sweating means Heat trapped inside, Yang blocked outside — a Damp-Heat and Qi circulation problem, not just “bad circulation.”
	•	True healing follows sequence: drain Damp, then nourish Yin, then rebuild Jing.
	•	Professional TCM guidance — herbs, acupuncture, and tongue tracking — transforms guesswork into precision medicine.
	•	When balance is restored, stimulants become unnecessary; energy rises naturally.

🌱 Where I am now

It’s been months symptom-free, and I’m now moving into deeper restorative phases to solidify everything — Yin, Jing, and Qi.
My body temperature, energy, and mood feel even for the first time in my adult life.
The transformation came from one simple shift: stop fighting symptoms and rebuild the body’s internal climate.

This is just my personal experience working closely with a qualified TCM practitioner — not medical advice.
But if your hands and feet are always cold yet sweaty, and you’re living on coffee, fasting, and cold drinks, you might be trapped in the same Damp-Heat and Yin deficiency cycle I was.

For nearly a decade I lived in a body that made no sense.
If I got warm or anxious, my skin would sting and erupt in prickly hives (cholinergic urticaria).
If it was cold, my hands and feet turned ghost-white and numb (Raynaud’s).
And no matter the temperature, my hands and feet were always cold — yet constantly sweating.

Doctors called them “unrelated” — autoimmune, circulatory, idiopathic.
Nothing worked.
Then I started working with a qualified Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) healer who ran a full tongue and pulse diagnosis, created custom herbal formulas, and treated me with weekly acupuncture.

Within just one and a half months, every symptom vanished — all within the first phase of treatment.
And for the first time in over ten years, I no longer needed coffee or Vyvanse, because my energy and focus returned naturally.
I’m now moving into Phases 2 and 3 to solidify and rebuild my Yin and Jing for long-term stability.

⸻

☕ How I got here

For years, my routine was: wake up, coffee on an empty stomach, skip breakfast, power through the day fasting until late afternoon — usually with iced drinks.
I thought it was discipline. In reality, I was burning my system down from the inside out.

From a TCM perspective, that combination wrecks the body’s inner balance:
	•	Coffee on an empty stomach overdrives Yang Qi and scatters it upward.
	•	Fasting weakens Spleen Qi, impairing digestion and fluid metabolism.
	•	Cold drinks extinguish digestive Fire, letting fluids congeal into Dampness.

Over years, this turned into Damp-Heat accumulation and Yin deficiency — the perfect storm for my symptoms.
Internally overheated, externally cold, Qi trapped in the middle — classic Damp-Heat with deficient Yin.

⸻

🔹 My TCM diagnosis

My healer explained that my body was like a sealed pot under pressure:
	•	Damp-Heat trapped in the middle and upper body → prickly heat, flushing, and sweating.
	•	Yin deficiency → no internal coolant to stabilize temperature.
	•	Qi stagnation and weak Yang circulation → hands and feet icy cold, yet sweating constantly.

My tongue confirmed it — red center with yellow greasy coat, pale edges, and cracks.
The diagnosis: Damp-Heat with underlying Yin deficiency and impaired Spleen-Kidney communication.
