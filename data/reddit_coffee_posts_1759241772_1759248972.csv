Life’s short, and honestly, why waste time on small talk when we could already be teasing each other about our questionable coffee choices or whose music taste is better? [or who tastes better ;)]

I’m 24, from India -  I tend to experiment with brewing coffee[AND my dating life], gets lost in manga [ would prefer getting lost in your eyes though] and replays movies for the soundtrack. I try to stay somewhat fit, but my real strength? Being ridiculously easy to talk to. People say I’m approachable, empathetic, and the kind of listener who actually remembers the little things.

What I’m looking for: a woman (18+) who’s up for genuine conversations, playful flirting, and maybe even something spicier if we click. IRL meets aren’t off the table either. I don’t care if you’re an introvert or extrovert - just bring some energy to keep the convo flowing, and I’ll always match it.

One small heads-up: I will eventually ask for verification. Nothing dramatic, will not ask for any identifiable photo,  just a safety thing. I hope that doesn’t put you off.

So… if tomorrow isn’t promised, what’s one thing you’d want to do TODAY?

1nuhcsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nuhcsd/a_note_left_by_each_of_the_bodies_read_threads/,"A note left by each of the bodies read: ""Thread's loose. Be back soon.""","Three deaths.

One after the other, each separated by exactly one week’s time, and the circumstances were bafflingly similar. Nearly identical, actually.

Each victim lived alone.

Each victim died in the same manner.

And each victim left the same note.

One thing was certain: the deaths were not natural. That left foul play or suicide, but, according to Detective Ambrose, neither explanation really made much sense. That didn’t stop people from developing an opinion, though.

The conundrum left the department precariously split: half the bullpen thought murder, the other half thought suicide. Tensions were mounting. The hung jury was getting restless. Historically even-keeled officers were instigating screaming matches over the topic. They needed a tiebreaker: information that could put the mystery to bed. For the victims, sure, but also for the department’s sanity.

That’s where I came in, he said.

The detective paused.

*“Come on in and sit down whenever the mood suits you, I suppose,”* he grumbled.

I guess it was wishful thinking to believe he’d let me listen to the entire briefing from the safety of the doorway.

From where I stood, his office looked like a war zone.

Stacks of overstuffed boxes rose high against every available inch of wall, jaundice-colored documents leaking from soggy cracks and bulging lids. A lone bulb, dangling from exposed wires that snaked up into the ceiling, cast the room in a meager glow. There *technically* was an available chair - a rickety, dangerous-looking thing, its cracked seat sloping leftward because of its uneven, rust-covered legs - but I’d have to move carefully through the dimly lit space to reach it.

*“Yeah, of course,”* I replied. Reluctantly, I tiptoed inside.

A faint fungal aroma lingered in the air, stale and tangy, like a cup of stagnant orange juice bristling with hungry mold. Stray documents lurked on the floor, some visible, others concealed within a thin layer of darkness where the light couldn’t reach. Slipped more than once, but thankfully, I did not fall. After a minute of tedious navigation, I planted myself down wordlessly, cautious not to clip the empty coffee cups lining the edge of his desk with my bag.

*“Sorry about the mess - my actual office is currently being renovated.”*

I nodded and shot him a weak, sympathetic smile, though I couldn’t help but wonder if this particular civil servant was on a red-eye flight to the unemployment line.

Felt like I’d met every agent in my decades of freelance work, but I hadn’t met Ambrose. Judging from the state of his “office” - the downright cataclysmic levels of disarray - there may have been a good reason for that. The man was no spring chicken, either. Wrinkles, liver spots, and a pair of cataract-stricken eyes combined to form something akin to a face below a mop of frizzy white hair.

Not that I was really in a position to criticize. My apartment was just as bad, if not worse, and I’d recently found myself on the wrong side of my late forties.

I eased into that deathtrap of a chair. For a moment, he just stared at me, elbows resting on the desk, hands clasped. The bulb flickered. He disappeared and then reappeared from the resulting blackness, but he did not move, nor did he blink.

*“…so, you'd like me to weigh in on the notes?”* I asked.

*“Ah, yes!”* he squealed. Ambrose visibly winced at his own reaction. His cheeks became flushed. He coughed vigorously, as if clearing phlegm, which only reddened his cheeks further.

*“Yes, yes...the notes...”* he reiterated in a deeper voice.

The detective tore three sheets from a nearby file.

*“Here’s the rub, Vivian: as far as we can tell, these victims never interacted with each other; not in any meaningful way, and yet, they all left one of these behind in their wake.”*

He handed me three black-and-white photographs, each centered on three differently shaped scraps of paper, each featuring the same five words:

***“Thread’s loose. Be back soon.”***

And just like that, in spite of his strangeness, he had my undivided attention. Wild curiosity coiled around my heart: a python twisting about weakened prey, almost ready to squeeze.

*“Now, if you buy the bullshit theory that these three killed themselves, I guess you could call them ‘suicide notes,’”* the detective continued, revealing his take on the “murder vs. suicide” controversy.

As he spoke, I fanned the pictures out. Compared them side-by-side.

*“I don’t call them suicide notes, though, ‘cause they don’t read like dying words to me; more like a strange calling card, the pretentious droppings of some knock-off, store-brand Zodiac Killer, getting a hard-on imagining us scratching our heads over their grand cipher.”*

The letters had…embellishments. Ornamentations. Flourishes as artistic as they were enigmatic.

In my twenty years of forensic document examination, I hadn’t ever seen anything like it.

There was a crescentic curl spinning clockwise off the bottom of the “T”. The “d” harbored three crisp, horizontal dots within its confines. The capital “B” had an extra bowl stacked on top of the normal two, looking like a pair of brass knuckles modified to fit a three-fingered mafioso. Each note’s handwriting was distinct, yes, but the flourishes? They appeared eerily identical.

*“No signs of forced entry at any of the crime scenes, no fingerprints on the murder weapons, and the handwriting seems to match each victim, at least to our untrained eyes.”*

He yanked the photos away and slid them into a manila folder. I struggled against the impulse to pull them back.

*“So - you’ll need to tell us if the notes are forgeries. If they are, that suggests one person wrote all three, which suggests murder. If they aren’t, I suppose they must have been suicides.”*

An impish smirk slithered across his face.

*“Can’t be both, right?”*

*“Not in my experience, no,”* I replied bluntly, a little exhausted by the man’s loopy behavior.

After a few more minutes of talking shop, the briefing concluded. I stood up and reached across the desk, offering the detective my hand. He did not shake it. No, the man just examined it.

Ambrose looked it over closely, like I was handing him a kitchen knife blade first and he was unsure of a safe place to grasp it. Eventually, I allowed my palm a tactical retreat, shoving the spurned digits into my pants pocket and turning to stumble my way out of the office.

Before officially departing, I realized I was missing some crucial information.

*“Remind me - how did they die?”* I asked from the doorway.

He closed his eyes, leaned back, and scratched his chin.

*“I think that’s out of your scope, Vivian,”* he muttered.

My pulse quickened. I felt the hard, gritty friction of grinding teeth and the boiling unease of growing rage.

*“Sir - Detective Ambrose - with all due respect, I’ve worked hand-in-hand with your department for decades. It hasn’t always been a perfectly amicable relationship, but not once has a detective outright refused to give me pertinent information.”*

***“That’s out of your scope, Vivian.*****”** He repeated himself, but much louder, over-enunciating each syllable, giving the statement an almost concussive quality - a series of rapid punches aimed at my torso. Despite the shouting, that impish smirk never left his face. He bellowed straight through the smile like it wasn’t even there.

The outburst left me slack-jawed. My head swiveled, peering down the hall, looking for someone to act as an impromptu referee for this bizarre interaction, to no avail. Ambrose’s office was in the station’s sublevel. Foot traffic was minimal.

When I looked back, he was *waving* at me. A stiff and exaggerated *bon voyage* that frightened me more than the shouting. It feels absurd to label the man an amateur at waving, but it truly looked like he was reenacting something he’d seen in a commercial once, rather than a normal, human gesture.

*“Thanks! This was fun. Bye now. My cell number should be in the file; let me know if you need anything!”* he boomed, visage strobing from the bulb flickering on and off.

My blood cooled. My rage wilted. I jogged off without responding, manila folder of documents tightly in hand. Knowing I had some work to sink my teeth into when I got home was the sole saving grace of the whole damn ordeal.

I paced towards the elevator. My eyes kept darting over my shoulder, half expecting to catch Ambrose in hot pursuit. He never was. Instead, I saw an elderly woman with thick bottle-cap glasses and a warm grin exiting one of the other offices. She implored me to hold the elevator as she shuffled rigidly across the sublevel’s tile flooring, so I stuck my hand over the sensor. The woman entered, thanked me, and we were finally on our way.

As I flung my car door shut, I wanted nothing more than to brush it off. Unfortunately, mental rumination is my god given talent. If dwelling were a sport, I’d be an Olympian. If perseveration could be monetized, I would have retired in the 80s a billionaire.

I couldn’t help myself.

For what felt like the fortieth time, I replayed his robotic, almost child-like wave in my head, trying - and failing - to discern *why* any self-respecting adult man would do such a thing. As the replays crested into the triple digits, a nagging detail started bubbling to the surface.

I saw something on his palm as he waved me off. Faded mounds of puckered skin organized into a very specific shape: a scar. The type of scar you don’t acquire by accident.

An equilateral triangle, point down, with two diagonal lines continuing beyond the point. Where one of them stopped, the other kinked at a ninety-degree angle and kept going, but only for a little longer. It resembled an hourglass with the bottom falling out like a trapdoor, or an “X” with the top covered and a small tail.

As I peeled down the interstate, speed steadily increasing, I couldn’t get the symbol out of my mind.

Did I imagine the detail?

Was it just a weird trick of the light, shadows dancing across his palm in such a way that it gave the impression of something that wasn’t actually there?

If the scar *was* real, then what the hell did it mean?

My attention drifted from the vacant highway to a passing billboard for only a fraction of a second. When my attention shifted back, I felt my heart detonate against the back of my throat.

There was a rapidly approaching bumper. I slammed on the brakes. The sharp chemical odor of burning rubber invaded my nostrils. I braced for impact.

My sedan thudded to a painful, suspension-destroying stop at what felt like the last possible second. The very tip of my car clinked gingerly against their license plate. Don’t think the driver even looked up from their phone.

The war drum beating in my chest slowed, and slowed, and slowed, and then I finally let myself breathe.

Gridlock was unusual for the early afternoon, but I had a sneaking suspicion as to the reason behind it. I grabbed a half-empty pack of Newports from the cupholder, stuck a cigarette between my still-trembling lips, and rolled down the window. Damp summer air coated my exposed skin. I felt my forearm stick to the hot plastic as I pulled my head out to get a better view of the holdup.

There was a plume of smoke in the distance, maybe a quarter mile ahead of the traffic. No nearby construction signage, either. As I lowered myself back into the car, my mouth was dry and my mind was racing. They’d been happening more and more recently. If I saw two on the way to the grocery store, and three on my way home, that’d be under the average. A good day, all things considered.

In the past year, the number of car accidents that occurred across my fair city had skyrocketed.

Most were mild. Fender-benders. Distracted drivers who poorly estimated how fast a car was going, or how far away they were. Some were more serious. A small proportion resulted in fatalities, and, if the press was to be believed, an even smaller proportion of the collisions were both tragically fatal *and* alarmingly inexplicable.

Inexplicable how? Well, it was tough to say. Local journalists waltzed elegantly around the details, hinting at *some* unexplainable aspect of the wrecks while diligently reporting the carnage.

I remember the title of one article read:

*“In a crash that has police puzzled, totaled SUV discovered around small bus. 15 killed. Only surviving victim remains comatose and unable to provide further details.”*

I’m sorry - the SUV was *around* the bus? How exactly would that work?

Mechanistically, what possible circumstances could have led to that outcome?

The article itself focused exclusively on memorializing the victims, which, although admirable, left us layfolk more than a little confused.

Pictures of the dead before the crash? Yes.

Pictures of the crash itself? Conspicuously absent.

Many DUI checkpoints and anti-texting-while-driving initiatives later, nothing much had changed. The crashes were only becoming more frequent as time went on.

Suffice it to say, I experienced a gnawing dread about what might lie beneath the plume of smoke.

Speaking of smoke, the cancer stick did wonders massaging my frayed nerves into a state of tenuous relaxation. I inched through the traffic without succumbing to a panic attack. Half an hour later, I was scooting by the crash itself, though I had a hard time comprehending what I was looking at.

I lit another cigarette.

There was just a heap of tangled metal. A ball of harsh silvery edges shimmering in the midday sun, seemingly closer to what would come out of a car blender than a collision on the interstate.

Where did the first vehicle start and the other vehicle end?

Were there more than two in that unintelligible mess?

And, most chillingly, what chance did *anyone* have to survive such a crash?

My eyes traced various lines of coherent metal as they dipped in and out of the shattered steel nucleus, figuring that if I could wrap my head around its interlocking knots and snarls, then I could mentally wring it all out. Unravel the crash like a length of twisted yarn until, inevitably, I was left with the cars that created it, each full and perfect. From there, I’d finally understand how it happened.

I thought if I could understand it, then I’d be safe.

The sound of a blaring horn behind me ruptured my trance. Unconsciously, I had come to a complete stop at the crux of the bottleneck. I pressed my foot on the gas and sped forward, trying to focus on the drive home, trying to stay in the moment, trying not to ruminate on something I didn’t understand for once in my life and just move on.

Surprisingly, I was successful; I didn’t dwell on the crash, but only because another incomprehensible image seemed more pressing.

An “X” covered at the top with a small tail.

An hourglass with an open trapdoor at the bottom.

One that I felt myself falling through, dropping deeper with each passing second.

\- - - - -

The stench pummeled my body like an avalanche.

My apartment never smelled good - not in the years I’d lived there - but that evening, the odor was uniquely abrasive. Sulfurous, sour, and sweet. A scent that landed somewhere between spoiled tofu and an oozing septic tank.

I slammed the door shut and threw my bag onto the kitchen island. Plastic sushi trays containing petrified ores of unused wasabi clattered to the floor, making room. I held my breath, surveying the kitchen, assessing for the source. There was a bevy of potential culprits: the partially eaten microwave dinners covering the countertops, whatever prehistoric takeout skulked in the darkest corners of my fridge, the once verdant spider plant that was beginning to show signs of rot, et cetera, et cetera.

Ultimately, I’d need to breathe deep if I wanted to locate the proverbial needle in the haystack.

I didn’t have to search very hard. With willing nostrils, the putrid odor promptly escorted me to a small crevice between my workbench and the nearby wall, where a discarded box of half-eaten lo mien laid in wait, hidden for God knows how long. I delivered the biohazard to my building’s trash chute immediately, holding it by the tip of a sodden white fold like it was the tail of a long-dead rat.

Crisis averted.

When I returned, the apartment still smelled, but it was its familiar, baseline reek, and I found that to be acceptable.

I wasn’t always so grubby.

As a kid, my bedroom sparkled. I could manage the responsibility because my internal fixations were incredibly narrow, practically pinpointed. If I kept my room immaculate and got perfect grades, I was good, I was safe.

Age, to my chagrin, introduced an infinite-feeling rogues’ gallery of additional topics to helplessly fixate on: romance, politics, existential terror, climate change, mortality, morality, drugs, STDs, taxes, real estate, sex, desire, prestige, heart attacks, dementia, on, and on, and on, like gas expanding against the seams of my skull, threatening to break it wide open, splattering my precious neural jelly all over my socially adjusted peers, staining their nice, white clothes a visceral red-blue.

My twenties were rough.

For a while, I simply existed. Not alive. Not dead. Paralyzed through and through.

The pursuit of inner peace led me to group meditation, but I couldn’t just sit; I needed something that cleared my mind but kept my body moving. A friend recommended calligraphy. I tried it, and for the first time in my life, I tasted harmony. I found something I could get lost in, something that released the pressure in my skull.

From there, I made the mysterious beauty of written language a career.

With the stench tackled, I settled at my workbench. The space was tidy. The oak gleamed. The overhead lights had freshly replaced bulbs, and the lens of my standing magnifying glass was clear and dustless.

I opened the manila folder, flicked the lights on, spread the documents across the oak, and lost myself.

But only for a little while.

***“Thread’s Loose. Be back soon.”***

I figured I’d tackle the notes one by one, comparing their handwriting to older samples provided by Detective Ambrose. Before I could start, however, something caught my eye. A subtle discrepancy between the notes that I hadn’t detected on a cursory examination.

The strange, captivating embellishments weren’t *completely* identical, as I first thought. One flourish differed.

There was a small dash coming off the last letter, the “n”. That was true for each note. However, the dashes weren’t all going in the same direction.

One moved up at an angle, one was straight, and one went down at an angle.

Suddenly, the writing felt magnetic. I couldn’t peel myself away. My eyes refused to blink, galvanized to the lettering. My attention made a cyclic pilgrimage from one note to the next, studying the variation with reverence and awe.

Up, across, down.

I started hearing something I didn’t recognize. A noise that didn’t belong in my apartment. A noise that didn’t belong *anywhere*.

Up, across, down.

A quiet, lawless tapping. A thousand fingernails clicking against marble - manic, hungry, forlorn.

Up, across, down.

The anarchic noise got louder. A riot filled my ears, no room for anything else. The sound was like a chest-high wave of centipedes was advancing towards me, tethered hides futilely knocking into each other as they desperately tried to untangle themselves, tapping, tapping, tapping.

Up, across, down.

The embellishments developed depth.

The photograph cracked and splintered like expanding ice.

The letters unzipped.

If squinted, if I positioned my head *just* right, I could spy something between the cracks.

The hideous tapping reached a fever pitch.

Then, there was knocking at my door.

*“Viv! Viv, you home?”* a muffled voice asked.

I leapt back, my chair clattering behind me, my heartbeat thumping and rabid.

When I looked to the door, the tapping faded.

*“Jesus, Viv, you okay in there?”*

Wobbling, blurry vision wading through tides of vertigo, I moved to open the door. The deadbolt clicked and I cracked the door, just enough to show that I was indeed alive. Maggie had an itchy trigger finger when it came to phoning emergency services.

She was an empathetic friend and an accommodating next-door neighbor, but the sixty-something ex-beatnik was also a hell of a snoop. Wasn’t uncommon to see her striding up and down our floor, ears perked, patrolling for even the faintest wisps of gossip. Retirement had left her with nothing better to do. So even though her expression betrayed concern, there was an undeniable glint of curiosity swelling behind her eyes.

I ran a quivering hand through my hair, pulling strands slick with sweat from my face.

*“Yeah, Mags, I’m good, just working,”* I muttered.

Maggie shot me a sideways glance, penciled brows arched.

*“Right.”* she replied flatly. I shrugged, fighting the urge to push the door closed.

Her features softened, curiosity snuffed out, a parish of worry lines congregating along her forehead.

*“Sweetheart, I know you’re a bloodhound with your work - God bless and keep you - but I don’t think you know when to stop.”* She lifted a bottle of cheap, nutmeg-colored whiskey into view. *“Moreover, I have news about Mr. Peterson, and it’s ghastly, absolutely fucking harrowing. Care for a break?”*

I shifted nervously in the doorway, still rattled from what I’d just experienced, but wanting nothing more than to return to my workbench at the same time.

*“Sorry - I didn’t mean to phrase that like a question, because it ain’t. Get on out here, Viv.”*

A delicate smile crept across my face. I relented.

*“Ugh, fine. I’ll meet you on the roof in five. Gotta clean up in here.”*

Maggie sniffed cartoonishly, well aware of the man-made disaster that was my apartment.

*“You’ll be able to do that in five minutes?”*

My smile bloomed.

*“Nice one, Mags, real clever.”*

I shut the door.

To relax, I needed to tidy my workbench first. Figured I’d collect the documents into a neat pile, pull the chair upright, and then I’d be ready; I could attend to the notes at another time. There was no rush, and I was clearly a little out of sorts.

I almost convinced myself that what I experienced was just the hallucinogenic vacillations of an overburdened mind. A sort of cognitive spasm that was downstream of the detective’s unsettling behavior, the horrific collision, or low blood sugar - most likely some ungodly combination of all three.

But then I scanned the room.

I blinked.

I blinked again.

When that didn’t remedy the problem, I rubbed my eyes so strenuously that my vision temporarily blurred. Nothing changed.

My rolling chair was just…gone.

Wasn’t tipped over on my stain-riddled carpet, like it should’ve been.

I checked my bedroom: no chair.

I checked my bathroom: no chair.

I checked my single, multi-purpose closet: unless it’d somehow become buried deep within the mountain of microwave dinner boxes and old clothes, it wasn’t there either.

For a brief moment, my gaze flirted with the photographs still lurking atop my workbench. A gentle flurry of distant taps resonated against my eardrums, beckoning me.

I ripped myself away. Forced my eyes closed.

The sound promptly dissipated.

Pacing out of my apartment, I locked the door behind me and headed up to the roof, leaving my workbench cluttered for the first and last time.

\- - - - -

The roof was our sanctuary, our private serenity sequestered fifteen stories above the maddening bustle of the city. We’d made weekly visits to that place for as long as we’d been friends: eight and a half years, give or take. Pretty sure the landlord didn’t know about our trips, either.

Maggie was strangely proficient with a lock pick.

From the relative comfort of her two raggedy beach chairs, we watched the sun curve through the atmosphere, drenching the sky in its liquid gold. The bottom-shelf whiskey laminated my throat with the pleasant burn of a campfire. Intoxication coaxed out an edited recollection of my day, and it felt damn good. I smoothed out the stranger details, of course. She didn’t need to know about the unusual symbol or the frenetic tapping, but I did mention the vanishing chair.

*“I’m sure you’ll find it.""* Maggie reassured me. ""*You know, something like that happened to me recently. Something outlandish.”*

She passed the bottle, and I took another generous swig.

*“Tell me.”* I rasped, the taste of turpentine still crackling over my tongue.

*“Well…”*

Maggie paused; an uncharacteristic lapse in momentum. She was never one to mince words. The chair screeched against the rough concrete as she turned it to face me. Her frost-tinted eyes locked onto mine.

*“So, I was cutting a pizza the other day,”* she started.

*“As one does.”* I slurred.

*“Hush, child. Listen.”*

I placed the bottle on the concrete, sat up straight, and saluted her.

*“Yes, ma’am. Right away, ma’am.”*

She rolled her eyes.

*“Anyway, I’m cutting a pizza, and I make two cuts. To be clear, I’m sure I made two cuts: one vertical, one left to right. Separated it into four equal slices, same way I always do.”*

I nodded, curious about the anecdote’s punchline.

*“But, when I looked…”* she trailed off. Another pause. Maggie grabbed the bottle by the neck, and imbibed. One, two, three gulps for courage. Then she started again.

*“When I looked, there were only three pieces.”*

A sputtering chuckle erupted from my lips.

*“What? Mags, what the hell are you talking about? What do you mean, ‘there were only three pieces’?”*

Her face began to flush, and she looked away. Instant regret soured some of the whiskey sloshing around my gut.

She furiously gesticulated cutting a pizza in the air and repeated herself.

*“I put two equal cuts into the pizza, in the shape of a plus, like I’ve been doing since the day I was old enough to work an oven, and, somehow, I was left with three slices. How the fuck does that happen? Doesn’t make a lick of sense.”*

Her words came out sharp, as if it was painful to say any of it out loud. I reached over and rubbed her shoulder.

*“Hey - no worse than losing a chair. I think we’re both getting senile, you old bat. Like, you haven’t even told me the ‘ghastly’ news about Mr. Peterson, and that’s the gossip you led with…”*

Maggie sprang from her beach chair.

*“Oh my fucking god! Yes! I can’t believe I forgot. I mean, I’m glad I forgot for a little; shit was ghastly. Ain’t really gossip, either.”*

She began pacing in small, hectic circles.

*“So, I was doing my rounds - wandering from boredom - and I reached Mr. Peterson’s room, all the way on the opposite end of the hall. I rarely go that far, suppose I was particularly stir-crazy yesterday. You know him, right?”*

I nodded. He was a crotchety old man who owned the nearby laundromat. I’d suffered plenty of awkward elevator rides with him over the years. Small talk with the curmudgeon was basically impossible. Far as I could tell, we had only two things in common: we were both unmarried, and we both rented apartments at the very edge of our exceptionally wide complex.

*“I got to his door, and there was…a smell. A terrible, rotting smell, like roadkill. And…I don’t know, I feared the worst, so I knocked. No response, but the door creaked open a smidge. Needless to say, I was the person who found him. By the looks of it, he’d been dead a while.”*

*“Oh, Jesus…”* I whispered.

*“Viv - trust me, it gets much, much worse.”*

My pulse quickened.

*“He…he was naked, sprawled out on the floor. No head. No arms - well, no attached arms. Half his right leg removed at the knee.”*

She sighed, interrupted her frantic pacing, and peered up at the sky, as if she were beseeching God for a reasonable explanation to what she had witnessed.

*“His arms were folded over his chest, laid parallel to his shoulders so that his neck stump and his jagged arm knubs were all clustered together, elbows bent so his hands were covering his belly button. And…and his left leg - the one that was still sort of intact - they twisted it counterclockwise until the kneecap pointed away from the body. Bent that leg too, just like the arms: same forty-five degree angle. Oh! And they fuckin’ painted them, too, just the arms and the legs. Bright, bleedin’ red, all the way around. Made what was left of him look like some weird, fucked hieroglyphic.”*

Breath fled my lungs. My brain sizzled, cooking itself delirious.

A vision of the detective’s scar took form in my consciousness.

And I thought I could hear the tapping.

But it could’ve just been a memory.

I choked out seven small words: *“The shape…kind of…like an hourglass?”*

Maggie thought about it for a second. She seemed to register my simmering panic.

*“Uh…well, yeah, sort of.”*

*“And you’re sure he wasn’t newly dead?”*

*“Yes, Viv - I’m sure. Don’t plan on cursing you with those grisly details, but he’d clearly been dead a while. The officer I spoke with thought just as much when they came to pick him - his body - up.”*

My stomach lurched. I felt it vibrating like a harshly plucked string, fluttering violently against my abdominal muscles.

*“Was there…was there a note?”*

She forced a weak laugh.

*“What, like some last words? From Mr. Peterson, or his killer? Love, I have no fucking idea, and I didn’t walk in to find out - last I checked, I’m not a CSI.”*

I rocketed from my beach chair, knocking over the whiskey bottle in my turbulent haste.

*“Vivian, sweetheart - please, tell me what’s happening…”* she pleaded.

Without another word, I sprinted away, hyperventilating, tripping over my own feet.

Maggie called out after me, but I didn’t look back.

I tried to call Ambrose at the number he’d provided. When he didn’t pick up, I ordered an Uber.

If luck was on my side, the department would still be open.

\- - - - -

The elevator chimed. The doors crept apart to reveal the sublevel. I lumbered down the musty hallway.

Desperate rationalizations sprouted from my ailing psyche, more and more every second.

*Ambrose misspoke. Got the dates mixed up or something.*

*Maybe I misheard him. I could have misheard him.*

*Maggie was mistaken - Mr. Peterson had to have died yesterday.*

But the police just *learned* of him yesterday. Maggie’s no idiot, either. Doubt she’d confuse new death for prolonged decomposition. And nothing could explain the state of the body matching the scar on Ambrose’s palm.

I stumbled. The walls seemed to shudder as my body made contact. I stifled a shriek and pushed myself off the shivering plaster.

Had to keep moving, had to keep going.

The light in his cramped office was still on, still flickering, but Ambrose wasn't there.

Just then, the woman I’d held the elevator door for a few hours earlier stepped out of her office. I jogged up to her as she fumbled with a keyring.

*“Excuse me, excuse me -”* to my embarrassment, the words came out liquor-soaked: garbled, slow, and soft.

She twitched, startled, dropping her keys to the floor. The woman placed a trembling hand to her chest and turned to face me.

*“Heavens. Don’t you have better places to be, young lady?”*

I bent down, picked up her keys, and handed them over.

*“Sorry. The detective who works down the hall, have you seen him? Is he still here?”*

She cocked her head.

*“Ambrose?”* I clarified.

The woman shrugged. Her lips tightened into a narrow line. She returned to locking her office, the key finally clicking into place. When she pivoted back to me, her expression was scornful, irritated, but her indignation seemed to melt away upon getting a good look at my sorry state - body drunk, mind breaking.

*“Honey…is there someone I can call for you? Are you lost? Do you need help?”* she purred.

*“What? No. No, I had a meeting with a detective, last door on the left, a little after eleven this morning, and I need” -* abruptly, I belched - “*I need to speak with him right away.”*

When she still appeared hopelessly confused, I turned and pointed to his office.

Her eyes darted from the room, to me, and then to her feet. She sighed, exasperated, and then began digging through her purse.

*“Where is the detective who works in* ***that goddamn*** *office?”* I asked, tone much angrier than I intended.

The woman retrieved her cell phone, dialed, and placed it against her ear.

*“I don’t know how you keep getting in here, but I’m calling you an ambulance.”*

I considered grabbing my lanyard and waving my ID in front of her face. Before I could, however, she said something that crushed me completely.

*-she's said so many times how she wanted to die, to me as a kid and still does right now ..is that normal? to tell your kids such?*

I (F19) have never had my own bedroom, my narcissistic mother (41) has always been a gambling addict ever since i was born, during my early childhood i didn't stay with her, i stayed with my grandmother back in the villages, moved to city when i was around 8, even then i didn't have my own room, my mom either stayed with her gambling addicted sister or some other family member, or always drunk with bunch of friends and family. if not that we'd stay in a really small rooms ""because she couldn't afford it"" which confused me because she had a car and a really good job at the bank.

 instead of being taken care off, I've always taken care of my mom and myself  because she'd get mad if i didn't cook when i just got back from school/forgot to do something/i didn't something right like making her coffee or eggs the way she wanted, she'd use that anger as an reason to go gambling and she's come back even more angry, she wouldn't hit me but she'd be so mean. i don't know how many times i'd put a knife on my heart as a kid and try to press in has hard as i could just to end it all. it was and still is a never ending cycle and i'm tired.

she's said so many times how she wanted to die, to me as a kid and still does right now ..is that normal? to tell your kids such?

she's spent over 1 million to go gambling (she showed me this when she stopped"" and got a receipt from one of the casionos, obviously that didn't last) and has borrowed over 500 000.00

even a hitman was sent to my village to our village because of her dept, she's so deep in it and i'm tired.

my school and transport fees were hardly paid, and she would tell me that all the time...i grew up embarrassed and with low self-esteem, everyone laughed at me, even then...i was tired. i've never carried lunch in my life, i've never been held and handled warmly by her, i've never been hugged by her, i've never been told how much i was loved.

her having another baby made everything even worse, i had and still have to take care of him. i'm tired.

right now she asks me if i hate when i hardly talk to her or tell her things or want to sit around her. when she chooses when to be happy or when to want to talk to me. i doubt she'll stop because she's on her way there now as i'm typing this.

i was hoping this year i would be away from her and going to university but i failed math and physics and rewriting this year. i'm saving some money to be able to get my own place or something away from her.

1nuh5oq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1nuh5oq/does_ao_smith_re301_replacement_water_filter/,Does AO Smith RE301 Replacement Water Filter Really Deliver? Detailed Review Inside,"The AO Smith RE301 Replacement Water Filter has quickly become an integral part of my home. Designed for whole-house filtration systems, it promises to reduce sediment and enhance water quality. My daily run-ins with hard water and frequent plumbing issues made me curious about its claims, and I decided to test it firsthand. The results? Let’s dive into both the good and the not-so-good aspects of this filter.

**Features and Functionality**  
This replacement filter, compatible with the AO-WH-PREL system, is designed to handle sediment reduction effortlessly. Its 20-micron filtration system works like a charm, capturing particles so tiny that they're invisible to the naked eye. I noticed immediate differences after installation; water flowing through our taps visibly cleared up. Our coffee tasted better, which really sold my spouse on the whole thing. Plus, the longer appliance lifespan that comes from reduced particulate build-up is like an unexpected but welcome bonus. No one’s mad at their water heater working smoother for longer!

**Ease of Installation**  
The installation process was surprisingly painless. I'm far from someone you’d call “handy,” and even I managed to set it up solo. The universal fit for 4.5""x10"" housing systems and the lack of need for a plumber were huge upsides for me. It took about 15 minutes tops to replace the old filter with this one. The hardest part? Convincing myself to actually do it instead of saving it for “later.” 

[Ready to snag AO Smith RE301? See Amazon’s price.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b07r3g84yk/)

**Performance Over Time**  
Performance has been stellar in the few months I’ve been using it. The AO Smith water filter maintains water pressure, which some other filters fail at—yes, that was a surprise I wasn’t braced for with other brands. It’s also pretty durable. I didn’t expect it to hold up so well given how light it felt out of the box, but the polycarbonate material is no joke. However, the recommendation to replace it every three months started to feel a bit short when you have a larger household, as is my case. The sediment buildup starts becoming noticeable toward the end of its lifespan.

**Advantages**  
Here’s what stood out the most:  
- 20-micron filtration delivers visually cleaner water.  
- Compatible with whole-house systems, benefiting every tap in the house.  
- Super easy to install—no extra tools or expensive plumbers needed.  

**Adverse Aspects**  
Like any product, this one is not without its less favorable attributes:  
- Replacement every three months seems frequent, especially for larger households.  
- Users with specific water contaminants beyond sediment might find it too basic.  

**Build and Material Quality**  
The polycarbonate material not only ensures durability but also makes it lightweight and easy to handle. I can see why AO Smith chose this material—it’s strong yet user-friendly. Its compact design also makes it easy to store spare filters without gobbling up too much space, a blessing when you're trying to organize a chaotic kitchen. However, the ""lightweight feel"" might initially make it feel less premium to some users.

**Competing Products**  
When stacked against other filters in the 20-micron category, this product excels in ease of installation and maintenance. The Culligan WH-HD200-C is a comparable alternative, but its slightly more complicated installation setup and higher cost per filter bring it down a notch in that department. On the other hand, the iSpring WGB21B filter provides additional filtration stages but comes at a higher price point. AO Smith’s offering is perfect when you’re looking for a straightforward sediment filter that does exactly what it says without significant sticker shock. 

**Bang for the Buck**  
From a price-performance perspective, this filter delivers undeniable value. Its cost-efficiency becomes evident when you consider the protective benefits it provides for your kitchen and bathroom appliances. I debated for weeks whether I should switch to reusable filters, but the AO Smith replacement made me realize simplicity sometimes wins the day. The peace of mind knowing every tap in the house has cleaner water is well worth what you pay. Considering the performance, it stands out as an affordable solution in the market.

So here is some advice on how to approach a woman. 

A little about me because this is just my opinion, but I date for personality. I’m very genuine and authentic. I’m in a happy relationship and I don’t do online dating. I don’t do casual hook ups (but I don’t judge either haha). This is just my opinion and everyone is different! 

For starters, life is not a movie. While there are outliers for sure, I’m not going to dress up, go out and hope that I meet the love of my life. (I’m currently dating someone but if I was single, this isn’t it either.) I mostly go out because I want to grab a coffee or I want to see my friends, etc. So this idea that you’re going to find a woman who is willing to just date you because they want to be approached by a man, is a little bit too literal maybe. Sure, some people may be more open than others, but you know, I think the average person is just living their life lol. 

For starters, my standards are a little higher than just wanting a partner who thinks I’m attractive. So personally, when I’m approached and immediately asked out or hit on, I’m flattered if they’re polite but I always wish they waited a little bit? Even like 5 minutes of chatting and we vibe some. Not like how are you, let’s go on a date but like talking about my dog or the band we’re watching, whatever you know? Like let’s see if we can actually have a conversation haha. Personality is so important to me and idc if the man is a super tall, model, rich, whatever, I want to know if we naturally feel comfortable enough to chat at least. I’d love to be complimented on the band tee I’m wearing, how cute my dog is, my style, something non sexual. Immediately going straight for the “your tits are huge,” “damn you’re so fine,” really makes me feel like I’m just being talked to cause someone wants to smash lol. Offering to buy me a drink is ok, but maybe after some chatting too. There’s plenty of girls who will accept and then walk away lol. If you want to do that, find someone that maybe will want to have the drink with you haha. 

Don’t get so in your head about looks or money. Work on yourself for you and find someone with similar priorities. If you think you’re getting rejected because of your height, for example, well ok, there’s someone out there who won’t care. Don’t let rejection make you bitter. Rejection is normal and OK. If someone is rude, well damn move on. Maybe they’re having the worst day of their life, maybe their ex just dumped them and looked like you lol. You never know. Maybe they were assaulted and they’re nervous around men. Maybe they’re wasted lol. Not your fault but it happens. Just let it go. Rejection isn’t always bad either. Sometimes rejection comes from a place of self awareness. I’ve rejected men at points in my life because I knew I wasn’t ready for a relationship. There’s a million non personal reasons you might rejected. I knew I didn’t feel sparks. If I encouraged that person, went on a few dates, then ended things, it would have been worse. I would have been leading someone on. Sometimes rejecting someone is the mature and kind thing to do. Sometimes I reject someone because I like as a person and don’t see anything wrong with them, it really is just me and where I am in life. Rejection doesn’t mean you’ll be alone forever. It doesn’t mean all women are the same. It doesn’t mean you’re a bad person, even if you fucked up and said something that made someone uncomfortable haha. Just learn and move on. 

So let’s say you’re out and you’re like I’d love to meet a nice girl. I’d start by going to similar places when you go out. Maybe a few of the same bars that fit your vibe. Go multiple times and you might see someone else over and over again that also likes the same place. Maybe join a club or go to things you like. If you love the gym, take some fitness classes. If you love art, take an art class. Don’t do it to date. Do it to have fun. Do things that vibe well with your personality. Make some friends. Male, female, it doesn’t matter. Treat them as friends. It takes courage, but challenge yourself slightly. You deserve to have fun, make friends and you’re a fun person. 

Approach every person you meet and just imagine you’re talking to your best friend. I use to be so shy dating and talking to the opposite sex and this helped sooo much. If I’m talking to my best friend, then I’m being my authentic self and then I’ll attract people who I vibe with. 

Don’t approach women like they’re something to date lol. Approach them like they’re people! You want to meet your best friend! The best impressions men have made on me always started like this. I love when men invite me to hang out in groups or when they’re friendly to my friends too. I love when a man approaches and we bond over something we have in common, rather than- I think you’re sexy. 

Once you’re out, at this bar, club, concert, group, etc. Just be yourself but maybe challenge yourself to speak a little bit more and look for openings. For example, I spill a drink, I’m right next to you and you help me clean it up and then make a funny joke lol. Or I’m next to you in class and afterwards you tell me you love my band tee. Like a meet cute, you know? An authentic opening that doesn’t feel forced. If you put yourself out there, moments like this will happen, I guarantee. Music festivals are always a great example of this. People passing out trinkets, people wearing goofy stuff. Tell a girl you love her jacket. Do something goofy. Maybe you’ll become friends and the first 5 times you hang out, there’s flirting, you’re in a friend group and you’re just getting drinks after your writing club. But then maybe the 6th time, something flirty happens and you realize you’d both love to hang out alone next time. Have some patience. Maybe the 6th time you realize you think she’s gorgeous but she’s into women but then the 7th time you meet her sister and that’s your future wife and you would have never met her if you didn’t become friends with her sister first. Now you have a friend and a wife lmfao. 

And finally, being a woman can be scary. Do I think every man I meet is a creep? Nope. But I’ve had some really bad experiences. Approach with that understanding. We are not staying you’re a creep, by any means, but just keep it in the back of your mind that some of us have been hurt or had trauma or things like that. Is that your problem? I mean no, but it’s also not our fault either. We didn’t choose for those things to happen to us. So just keep that in mind when approaching. If you wait for a good time to approach, try those natural moments, it just feels so much more authentic and in turn, a little less creepy, no offense. Obviously, we are aware sometimes people just say stupid things or we’re paranoid, whatever haha, but it’s empathetic to understand that there are dangerous people out there and approach with that in mind. For example, if you want to buy us a drink, let us order and grab it. Some women get drugged. Are you going to drug me? No haha. You’re a nice guy (you better be 🫵 lol) but you’re also aware that happens to women, so you’re keeping that in mind with how you approach. This is the best example I can think of, but there’s a lot more. I walk my dog and I’ve had men start following me to ask me out. This creeps me out so much even though I know some are harmless. Being followed just feels so uncomfortable. Wait for a natural moment. For example, I stop and sit on a bench with my dog. You come over and ask me about him and tell me you love dogs because you genuinely do and ask if you can show me a picture of yours. The conversation goes well and you ask for my number. You don’t chase me down on my walk, when I’m on the phone with my mother and now I’m afraid I’m going to be robbed lol. If you think I’m gorgeous and the only solution is to chase me down, don’t. Maybe you’ll see me again, maybe you won’t, but I’m not the only woman on this planet lol. 

Some of you are so bitter or shy or cute and it’s honestly so understandable because everyone has been there, regardless of gender. But don’t let society get you down. Yeah some men are perverts and some women only care about money. But honestly the reverse is true sometimes too. And even if you think the majority of people are selfish and rude, there’s always outliers. Theres so much negativity. Yeah maybe it was easier “back in the day,” but also it wasn’t in a lot of ways and guess what, you live now and today. So think positively. Don’t listen to those shitty evil male podcasters who make you feel worse because they’re tearing apart women. Don’t get in your head. 

Some of you seem a little neuro divergent and I’m sure if you think literally, dating is incredibly hard so give yourself some leeway and understand rules might not apply to dating as well as real life. If I were to give you one rule, it’s to treat women like you would your friend first and then see where things go. 

Get out there and experience life. Get out there and have fun. I grew up in a small town, but get out there anyway. Make friends. Go to the local bar, take up golf, visit the next town over more often. Try things. Make new friends. Live. Don’t rush things. Love yourself and work on yourself for you and no one else. Stop telling yourself all the reasons women don’t want you. Personally, my first love was a foot shorter than me lmfao. You’re not a bad person because you want to hit on women lol. You’re just a little lost and that’s ok. ",0,1759247779.0,dating_advice,1,0.5,False
1nuh09d,https://www.reddit.com/r/RelationshipIndia/comments/1nuh09d/32m_in_a_messed_up_relationship_dynamics_need/,32M in a messed up relationship dynamics. Need your suggestion.,"I am a 32-year-old man who finalized my divorce this year, though I've been separated since 2023. I moved overseas and now occupy a common room in a co-living flat.

One of my flatmates is a 28-year-old unmarried female nurse. She is in a relationship with another male flatmate who is married, with a wife and two young children back in India.

Now, here comes the messy part—if it wasn't already. The female flatmate asked me out for coffee. I obliged as a friendly gesture, but I soon got sucked in and started liking her. It reached a point where every time I heard a noise from the kitchen, my mind would tell me to go meet her. I'd end up staying in the kitchen just to talk to her whenever she was there. I couldn't control the impulse. Soon, it became an obsession, and I'd think every notification on my phone was from her.

We started spending time together outside the flat—going to the temple, hiking, and holding hands on walks in the park. I felt we had a real connection. However, one day her partner saw us in the park, and she flipped. She stopped going out with me after that. But I, like a fool, thought if I tried harder, she might choose me.

That's when my downfall began. I started daydreaming in the office about what our life would be like if she accepted me. I couldn't focus on work and began procrastinating on all my tasks.

I started making her overnight oats, avocado shakes, and brownies, even feeding her with a spoon like we were a couple. She liked the care and attention I gave without having to make any real commitment, and this fueled my ""giver"" energy. She began calling me every day after lunch for a chat, and I loved it.

To be clear, she has maintained boundaries; she never entered my room and isn't flirty with me.

I used to literally run home from the office early to make dinner for her, hoping it would be ready before she got back. This ""giver energy"" was my way of showing I cared—exactly what I did for my ex-wife. Ah, the same old pattern repeating itself.

But every time I heard her laugh with her partner, jealousy kicked in. I'd wonder if they were being intimate at night. The pain was unbearable. Seeing them go out on date nights didn't help.

I never made a move, fearing she would back off and I'd lose the so-called friendship we had.

But something recently changed. I took a hard right and went totally ""no contact,"" going silent. No more breakfast for her, no more please-tries.

She noticed the change and started reaching out on WhatsApp, even opening my room door to check on me. I've started wearing headphones in the kitchen to show I'm not available to talk. She want me to sit at the dining table and talk to her but I would give some excuse and have my breakfast in my room. She keeps reaching out and wants the old me back. I clearly told her that's not possible but seems she think she can reel me back in. 

I like the attention she giving now. She doing exactly what I used to do for her. 

Based on all this, what do you think this woman wants from me?

Is it just the care and attention I gave her, or something more serious? Or does she want to keep me around as a backup option—someone who's always available to take care of her?

She told me her current relationship is temporary, as she plans to move to New Zealand next year.

I plan to move out of this house as soon as possible to find some peace of mind, as the situation is emotionally draining. The loop of giver energy -> satisfaction -> jealously->pain seems never ending. 
A part of me wants her, but she is not emotionally available now. Then the question of ethics and morality kicks in: if she's involved with a married man now , would she even be the right partner for me who wants to date to marry. No casual hookups. ",3,1759247767.0,RelationshipIndia,1,1.0,False

I knew I should cut back, but I really enjoy that morning ritual and the taste of good cold brew.

After some research, I bought a $15 cold brew pitcher from a thrift store (normally $25-30 new). It's super simple, just a glass container with a fine mesh filter insert.

My process:

* Add 1 cup of coarse ground coffee (I buy in bulk when on sale)
* Fill with filtered water
* Let sit in fridge overnight (12-24 hours)
* Remove filter and store concentrate for up to 2 weeks

Each batch makes about 7 servings of concentrate that I dilute with water or milk. The coffee costs about $0.35 per serving, which means I'm spending $1.05 weekly instead of $15.

Total savings: about $720 annually minus the $15 one time investment and maybe $25/year for slightly better coffee beans than I used to buy for home brewing.

The best part? I actually prefer my homemade version now, and I don't waste time in coffee shop lines. Anyone else found a simple swap that saves more than you expected?",16,1759247568.0,Frugal,3,0.77,False

1nugx3t,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_vaaree_home_decor_/comments/1nugx3t/the_rising_role_of_trays_platters_in_modern_home/,The Rising Role of Trays & Platters in Modern Home Décor,"In recent years, trays and platters have moved beyond their traditional role as serving essentials and emerged as significant elements in home décor and organization. They are no longer viewed as background items but as versatile accents that enhance both function and style in homes.

**Why trays & platters are gaining importance**

1. Everyday Use with Elegance: A tray used for coffee, books, or candles can make routine activities feel intentional and refined.
2. Organization Tool: Trays help group items on coffee tables, bedside stands, or kitchen counters, keeping spaces tidy while adding a touch of design.
3. Hosting Essentials: Platters elevate the presentation of snacks, desserts, or festive spreads, adding charm to dining and living areas.
4. Décor Flexibility: They are used as centerpieces with flowers, candles, or seasonal items, and adapt easily to traditional or contemporary themes.
5. Gifting Trend: With their balance of utility and aesthetics, trays and platters have become popular alternatives to conventional gift items.

**Design Insights**

According to discussions in lifestyle journals and design explorations, serveware is increasingly seen as storytelling objects:

1. Minimalist Spaces: Wooden or monochrome trays fit seamlessly into clean, modern settings.
2. Traditional Homes: Hand-painted platters or crafted trays bring cultural depth.
3. Modern Décor: Glass, ceramic, or metallic trays create sophisticated highlights.

**The Broader Shift**

1. The rising interest in trays and platters reflects a wider movement in home styling:
2. Consumers are embracing multi-functional products that balance beauty and practicality.
3. The global trend of tablescaping and festive decoration has brought focus to serveware as decorative essentials.
4. Social media has amplified the idea of styling everyday objects, encouraging people to look at trays and platters as design pieces.
5. **Open Question to the Community:**

How do you see trays and platters fitting into home décor trends? Are they just functional, or are they becoming design accents in their own right?",1,1759247564.0,u_vaaree_home_decor_,0,1.0,False

After the interview, I decided to grab a coffee in their lobby while organizing my notes before heading home. Just as I was packing up 15 minutes later, I got a notification.

It was a rejection email from the SAME hiring manager who just interviewed me saying they were ""moving forward with other candidates whose experience better aligns with our needs."" The timestamp showed they sent it 10 MINUTES after our interview ended.

So they rejected me while I was literally still in their building, probably drafted the email during our interview. The worst part? The hiring manager walked past me in the lobby after sending it, made eye contact, then quickly pretended to be on his phone.

So here’s a \*\*classified ad\*\* for a woman with whom I can play brain-tennis.



\*\*About them:\*\* I need someone erudite, with discerning taste. They must be a sparkling conversationalist with a curious bent of mind and high agency. A STEM education, rich vocabulary and a healthy sense of humour are welcome. They must be honest, but unfailingly kind, even when anonymous. They must have a direct, uncomplicated way about them. They must be over 30, but one can be 50 at heart, so you are welcome to apply. They must be a woman, or NB.



\*\*About me:\*\* 32F engineering manager in tech, happily married. I will ply you with endless hot beverages while relating interesting anecdotes. I like literary fiction, thinking in writing, and understanding why we operate the way we do at an interpersonal level. I love language (particularly mine), I like programming and I'm always on the lookout for culture. I am honest but will never be cruel. I love animals and will make you laugh. I write better than I talk so texting is my mother tongue.



\*\*Average time commitment:\*\* An hour of texting a week, one dinner/beverage per month



It is crucial for me that our tastes align. So here’s an overview of mine. 



Books I like: A Stranger in Moscow, Jane Eyre, Rebecca, The Midnight Library (first read only), Zen and the Art of.



Comfort reads: Agatha Christie (on vacation), anything Jeeves, HP, The House in the Cerulean Sea



Books I despise: My Year of Rest and Relaxation, A Little Life



Books I didn’t like: Before My Coffee Gets Cold, Maybe You Should Talk To Someone, 11/22/63, Anything by Sally Rooney, most things by Matt Haig (except the Midnight Library)



Films I Like: Mr and Mrs Kramer, Marriage Story, The Help, Devil Wears Prada, Pride and Prejudice (2005), Midnight in Paris, and guiltily, Mr and Mrs Smith



Comfort films (mainstream): Notting hill, PotC, LotR/Hobbit, HP, Forrest Gump, Before series, most things with Keira Knightley in it and Avengers I

I was a fat kid and didn’t love myself, my home life was a disaster and we had to pick which bills would get paid this month and which one we will go without. I often fantasized about a life in nyc, brunching with friends and being loved by people and accepted. I wanted to one day not be depressed and sad, It felt like a far away dream but..

Today I am 28 years old, I have an awesome job, a career that pays me enough where I am saving thousands a month comfortably. If u told me I would be able to save over 10k a month and still have my bills paid when I was 12 I’d say you’re lying. The fact that I literally could buy a $5k coffee table without blinking is huge to me. I know money isn’t everything but If u saw where I came from you’d get it.

I have an amazing bf that checks everything on my list that literally was watching videos on diamonds next to me last night so he could propose with the perfect ring. He has a whole section of notes on his phone that’s just poems about me and his private thoughts about how much he loves me (I accidentally found it and was shocked) He’s pushed himself to get two jobs to grant me the life I want. He writes me notes and hides them in my bag and wakes me up with forehead kisses daily. This is to a girl that was barely told I love you growing up and I always felt so alone. Like literally I am going to marry my best friend and I get why people cry down the aisle now, it’s because they found something that they believe didn’t exist and not only does it exist that something values them and feel the same way.

We have a family group chat that is really active and I just enjoy how close we are. We have family game nights that looks straight out of a Christmas movie and we get together and eat random dinners together. I always wanted that and we couldn’t have that due to stress and hardships but now we do and it’s great. 

My gfs are great and very supportive. We do brunches, we get massages, we push each other. They come over for wine and chit chat as someone that never had much friends growing up this is huge. Like what do you mean I have sisters outside my biological sister? 

My apartment is what I always envisioned because I saw them in films growing up. I have over 20 plants, huge windows, a skylight, and it’s just so cozy. I have the most adorable and affectionate dog. I take him on walks as I drink coffee and my bf take him on runs. In the mornings we wake up and do yoga while a documentary or some dorky thing plays in the background. 

I also love to learn, I’m in a relationship where my partner built his life around me going back to school to get my doctorate fully okay with taking on all the bills so I can keep learning and following my dreams. 

This is the life I prayed for, down to the dog. Sometimes I’m stressed with work or my studies and I say “I hate my life.” But today I was really thinking and I realized how fucking blessed and happy I am. I have zero complaints! Yeah life will always throw curveballs but little me would be so proud to be here and I still cannot believe I’m here. 

If you’re in a bad place or feeling down currently, things will get better. Or things are already better but like me you’ve been overlooking a few things.

I don’t even question it at this point—Canada Dry is basically the Kleenex of ginger ale lol.

The Coffee Hill— yes, it’s SO aggravating when someone orders a coffee and they don’t specify if they want any milk or sugar, but what’s more aggravating is serving the black coffee and then getting poked for milk or sugar when you’re leaving to serve another row. 

The Grown Men Apple Juice hill— I’ve never understood why some of y’all get so triggered when grown men order apple juice, but I guess I don’t have a place to comment because I do look at adults sideways when they order milk LMAO

Hey Toronto Redditors!

We're Denys & Dan, and have been living in and around this amazing city for years,but noticed a common theme: there are so many cool things to do, but it's not always easy to find a group to do them with! We've both tried attending various events and using social apps, but often feel like there's a missing piece when it comes to truly fostering genuine connection.

That's why **we're launching a new series of events designed to bring people together, inspire new friendships, and explore the best of Toronto**. Think of it as a low-pressure way to meet like-minded individuals and discover new experiences, without the awkwardness!

# A little about us:

* **Denys:** I moved to Toronto with my parents when I was 4 and have lived here ever since. I love to travel and spend time outdoors. Whether it be running, biking or just strolling around, you will almost never find me inside (expect when I am working). Furthermore, over the last couple of years, I have turned into a bit of a coffee addict, and now know almost every cafe in the city.
* **Dan:** I was born in Toronto, raised in the suburbs, and have once-again called Toronto home for 5 years now. I'm a huge foodie: I love cooking, baking, and exploring Toronto’s culinary gems. I'm also really into sports and fitness, especially basketball and spin classes. While I enjoy a good night out (especially if there’s EDM music involved), I've found myself spending more and more time doing chill activities like board game nights, waterfront walks, and run clubs.

Yes, poop-themed! Dishes shaped like poop emojis, served in toilet bowl–style dishes, while you sit on closed toilet seats. Bizarre? Definitely. But also hilarious and oddly cute.

Houston’s LOTR-inspired spot offers hobbit-sized sandwiches, seafood, nachos, and beers. Sit under a big oak tree on the wooden deck and live out your Middle-earth dreams.

I pay 5% into my pension & £200 a month into work savings that are deducted directly from my paycheque.

I live with my partner, so all household bills are halved, he paid nothing towards this holiday as he didn’t come with me!

**HOLIDAY DETAILS/EXPLANATION**
I am very lucky to have a close family friend who asked me to keep them company on a trip to London, they paid for petrol costs & the apartment, I was basically there to hang out with her Saturday-Wednesday, when she wasn’t at shows & got to see my own shows when she was, I absolutely appreciate this is a massive privilege that not everyone gets! As I was already going to be halfway down the country, I arranged to take a trip down to Cornwall Wednesday-Saturday to see my grandparents once my friend had gone back home, meeting up with my parents for the drive down together.

**LONDON**

**TICKETS/SHOWS**

*My Neighbour Totoro* - great show, very cute and wholesome, but not a great deal of plot (just like the film really). The puppets were great, especially the massive Totoro. The theatre it is in, Gillian Lynne, has a really odd seat either side of the stage, where you are literally in a row of one (G51) if anyone is going there solo I recommend it as it means you’re not having to get up as other people go to get refreshments in the interval. **£85.00**

*Starlight Express* - Absolutely loved it, trains, roller skating, puns about trains! What more could you want?! Genuinely so much fun, the plot didn’t make a great deal of sense, but it was so entertaining. We sat in the front where there are seats set into the stage, so people were zooming about inches in front of us. Very very fun show, totally recommend it to anyone with children as there’s so much fun stuff going on, it’s a genuinely massive spectacle. **£70.00** (but I didn’t pay for this one, my friend did).

*Penn & Teller* - You can definitely tell they aren’t spring chickens any more, both in their 70s, but the show was still entertaining. They brought their piano player over from Las Vegas this time, so Penn was on stage playing bass with him before the show, like they do in their show at The Rio. I think people would be disappointed by the show if they were expecting the gun/gory tricks from earlier in their career, but honestly it’s a lot of fun to watch 2 people who have been doing their craft for over 50 years, still having so much fun and passion for their work.(this ticket was a present for me so I don’t know the cost!)

*Stereophonic* - This play is SO long, I went into it not knowing much about it - just the vibes that it was basically a fictionalised version of Fleetwood Mac making Rumours. It is over 3 hours long, that is too long! I bought a ticket at the very front row, mainly because it was £25 without fees, and I thought there must be something funny about the seat for it to be so close to the stage but so cheap… I was right, I could reach out and touch the stage from my seat without even having to fully extend my arm, and my direct eye line was a giant speaker attached to the side of the stage. I was still able to see most of the stage from my seat though, the set was brilliant- it’s based in a recording studio, so the audience has a view of the mixing deck/producers space right in front of them, then further in the back is a full recording space behind glass. All of the costumes were great, the play itself was fine! If I had realised it was so long, and if I had realised it wasn’t a true musical, I maybe wouldn’t have gone, but it was something new at least! Also shout out to the elderly man that sat next to me for this show and loudly spoke about his disgusting eye infection, in detail, including the various amounts of puss leaking from it, then proceeded to wipe his manky eye with his sleeve repeatedly- he actually fell asleep half way through the first half and then didn’t return for the second…good. **£28.95**

*The Curious Case of Benjamin Button* - Not going to lie, I saw the film and *hated* it, genuinely thought it was the most pointless waste of time. I only booked tickets to the show because I saw it was closing in a few weeks and figured I could go and be smug about how much it sucked (if it did) then saw on instagram a video of the show where two violinists duel…and that is very much my shit. I was forced to eat humble pie because I *loved* it, so much. It has reimagined the book, so instead of America it’s based in a Cornish fishing village, all of the actors also play multiple musical instruments throughout and play different characters. They were all so talented, the funny bits were funny, the sad bits genuinely had me crying in the theatre and it was just obvious that an incredible amount of work had gone into the show. I am now heartbroken that it closes next week as I would 100% have found an excuse to go back to London to see it again as it was so brilliant. **£143.95** (for 2 tickets - I paid for my friend this time!).

*Hadestown* - I really liked this show! I had booked a seat in one of the boxes for this show as I had never bee;in one before and the prices weren’t bad. I didn’t realise until I got there that the boxes are *tiny* and I was squished in next to two young people that were clearly o;a date… I’m sure that they were very lovely people but I was basically sat in their lap the whole way through. The songs were catchy, the stage was really impressive- it was one of the first shows that Nicola Robert’s was in and although I’ve seen mixed reviews, I really liked her! I would absolutely go see this again if it toured…but I think they would need to change a lot about the stage for it to tour because it moves so much and is so integral to the story telling. **£69.50**

**FOOD**
**£25** - Miller & Carter - on the way down we stopped at Miller & Carter to have lunch with my friends family, we split the bill between us all, I had water, garlic mushrooms & a cauliflower salad - absolutely overpaid for this as other people had alcoholic drinks etc. but I was literally on the way to London, for free, to stay in an apartment for free…so who am I to judge.

**£32.35** - Ugly Dumpling - I got the vegetarian tasting platter, so 2x of each; spinach & tofu, mushroom & truffle, halloumi & courgette, and curry paneer, all were super tasty, but the mushroom was my clear favourite. We then shared the dessert platter, so I had one of each, Nutella, pecan pie & apple pie. Pecan pie was the best of the three, I think I also had a few Pepsis & we split the bill between me and my friend (who had the meat platter).

**£3.99** - Pret A Manger - coffee, it was coffee.

**£3.95** - Buns From Home - a cheese and marmite pastry thingie! It was nice, savoury, not wildly expensive.

**£22.89** - Dishoom - I had a vegan sausage and egg naan roll, a chai & me & my friend halved a stack of jaggery pancakes. We also went for lunch at Dishoom, but my friends friend really kindly paid -so I don’t know what the cost of that was!

**£28.10** - Shake Shack - I got a mushroom burger for me, a Korean burger for my friend & some fries, which we were meant to share, but I wasn’t paying attention to what I ordered and they had bacon on them, so I just had the burger!

**£6.50** - Donutelier - frankly a ludicrous price for one donut, but it was massive and Black Forest flavoured (my favourite) & I enjoyed it, even though I got ganache all over my face and had to wash it off at the sink at the back of the store.

**SOUVENIRS**

**£36.73** At the Converse outlet store in Wembley, 1 purple T-shirt with sunflowers on it & one checked flannel shirt.

**£28.00** on a Starlight Express T-shirt from the merch stand, it was a collab between Andrew Lloyd Webber & a skateshop, which makes sense but was still very funny to me.

**£35.00** on a T-shirt from Penn & Teller, it’s cute! Looks like a postage stamp & has the London palladium on it.

**£0.75** on a tiny ikea bag shaped keyring - best purchase of the trip.

**£18.00** on a Dishoom tote bag - it’s very sturdy and in fun colours, they also gave me a free tote to carry my tote in which made me giggle.

**MISC**

**£22.57** - miscellaneous snacks and drinks at the world food store underneath the apartment, mainly cherry pepsi max & canned iced coffee as I am hopelessly caffeine dependent, but also some cherry filled croissants, some spicy crisps, some extra toilet roll and a lip balm.

**£40.50** TFL charges - you just boop your card each time you go in and out and it tots up the best way to charge you so there are just random amounts on my bank statement, who knows what for specifically, I just trust that TfL know what’s best for me.

**CORNWALL**

As mentioned, the second part of my week holiday was travelling down to Cornwall with my parents to visit my grandparents- they drove half way down the country on the Tuesday, visited with friends overnight, then my friend dropped me off at a service station to meet up with them on the Wednesday to drive the rest of the way down. My grandparents are both in their mid to late 80s and I hadn’t seen them in around 5 years as they live incredibly rurally.

**ACCOMMODATION/TRAVEL**

**£201.19** For my half of the log cabin we stayed in.

**£70.00** petrol contribution for the journey.

**FOOD**

**£5.95** on an egg mayo sandwich, crisps and a drink from M&S food in a service station on the way down - it was not very nice.

**£49.50** on Chinese food for me, my mum, stepdad, and grandparents, I was genuinely surprised that this wasn’t more, Cornwall is famously silly expensive, but £10 each for a takeaway seemed really reasonable, and my grandad was so pleased that I paid for it for all of us (I’m the youngest grandchild and I think they still think of me as super young, but it’s nice to show them I’m a grown up now!)

**£30.00** on cakes and sweet potato fries from a farm shop/restaurant, I had a lemon pavlova an fries, I bought some cake to take back to my grandparents.

**£5.90** on a cheese pasty for the drive back up.

**£4.85** on two big bags of kettle chips at a service station on the way home.


**GIFTS**
**£2.00** for a birthday card for my Nanna.

**£7.70** on printed out pictures of my side of the family so my grandparents have physical versions.

**£4.00** on a frame for one of the pictures as a birthday present.

**£3.90** on a bunch of flowers to take to my aunties grave.

The trip to Cornwall was lovely, I got to see my grandparents and my aunt, along with my other aunties grave (she passed away during covid and though I was able to visit her before she died, and made it to the funeral, I hadn’t been back since she had her grave stone set).
It was a difficult few days as my nanna isn’t doing very well, memory wise, and struggled to remember some things I know she wouldn’t have had an issue with a few years back, or struggled to follow conversations/repeated questions multiple times. She is 84 though, and my grandad is even older, so all things considered they’re not doing too badly really. This part of the trip reminded me I need to get down to see them more often, so I’m trying to plan a visit down in March of next year.
The days in Cornwall were mainly spent hanging out at my grandparents house and chatting, with a brief trip to the cemetery, and a trip to the farm restaurant. I don’t mind though, it was definitely about who I was there to see, rather than what I was there so see.

1nugbgo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nugbgo,Sunshine Town by Rolife,"Just finished building [Sunshine Town by Rolife](https://www.rolifeonline.com/products/rolife-sunshine-town-3d-wooden-diy-minature-house-book-nook-tgb02). It is a fun build but it does have its challenges.

The scene is well laid out and I had a lot of fun putting it together. The instructions are helpful in reminding you to paint the edges of the things that they want you to paint. The half table illusion (Pic 1) works fairly well though I did have to glue the table to the mirror to assist with it. The yellow walls confused me at first, but once everything came together it definitely adds to the brightness of the kit. Considering I have mainly been doing Halloween and Cyberpunk themed kits the brightness of this one was a welcome change.

I did change some things.

1. I used paint pens instead of the paint that comes with the kit as the stuff in the box is more like paste than paint and is a little difficult to work with.
2. Painted the piece behind the grating and the light holder black (Pic 2). Originally the piece behind the grate was the same color as the grating and just did not provide enough contrast. The light holder was bright yellow and just looked out of place.
3. Cut out a piece of card stock to close in the back on the staircase (Pic 3). Originally it was open and it bugged me (Pic 4).
4. Cut a notch at the back of the battery box under the stairs to run the wiring as it was impairing me getting the middle floor piece to fit (Pic 5).
5. Painted the back of the tree. I am not sure why they did not include something to take care of that. It is hard to miss in the reflection (Pic 6).
6. Swapped out the unnaturally green plastic plant that came with the kit. Import regulation are preventing Rolife from importing natural plants so I definitely recommend picking something up that looks nicer.

Things that I wish were a bit different.

1. I would have liked for the book store door to open towards the front of the kit so you could see inside.
2. I think they had a few opportunities to add some additional lighting. The book store window would have greatly benefitted from a light.

Some of the things to watch out for on the kit.

1. Until the other wall is put on the kit is extremely unstable. You constantly have to watch where you grab it and how you move it.
2. The choice of where they use tabs to connect pieces is very in consistent. On the bookshelf in the book store window, one end is tabbed the other end is glued.
3. There is a film on the plastic see through pieces that needs to be peeled off (this is for part J).
4. The electronics/wiring is a bit more challenging on this one and will require splicing to get the lighting up and running.",7,1759246211.0,booknooks,1,1.0,False

1nugaxc,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1nugaxc/explore_the_best_espresso_machine_breville/,Explore the Best Espresso Machine Breville Barista Express Review,"Breville BES870XL is an espresso machine that caught my eye after hearing rave reviews online. Packed with features promising high-quality coffee-making capabilities, I decided to put it through some extensive daily use. As someone who takes their morning coffee ritual very seriously, I was excited to see how this machine would hold up, not just for me but for our entire household of caffeine enthusiasts.

**Design & Build Quality**  
Straight out of the box, the brushed stainless steel finish immediately grabbed my attention for all the right reasons. This machine screams “premium” and looks like it belongs in a coffee shop rather than on my kitchen counter. While the design is elegant, it's also functional. Its dimensions, 13.8"" by 12.5"" by 15.9"", make it a hefty addition to any counter, so make sure you’ve got enough space before committing. The overall weight wasn’t a dealbreaker for me, but moving it around isn’t exactly a one-hand affair. Everything about the machine—down to the knobs, dials, and pressure gauge—has a solid, durable feel, though cleaning some parts required a little patience.

**Ease of Use**  
If you’re stepping into manual espresso-making for the first time, the learning curve with the Breville BES870XL is noticeable but manageable. The dials for grind size and the built-in conical burr grinder immediately stood out to me. With some trial and error, I was able to adjust the precision burr grinder and consistently hit my preferred grind for a beautifully robust espresso. No more pre-ground coffee packets for me! There’s also a low-pressure pre-infusion feature which lengthens the extraction process, resulting in an even and balanced flavor—a detail that won over my coffee-conscious coworker during a taste test.

[Check Breville BES870XL price on Amazon.](https://vendm.com/p/b00ch9qwou/)  

**Performance & Customization**  
What impressed me most—and possibly turned me into a borderline coffee snob—was the precise temperature control (PID). It delivers water at just the right temperature for optimal espresso extraction, significantly impacting the flavor. Combined with the adjustable grind size and dose-control grinding, you’re really given the reins to fine-tune your coffee to perfection. The integrated tamper was convenient, saving me time during busy mornings when I’m rushing to beat traffic. As for the milk frother, let’s just say it turned me into the family’s go-to latte artist. Producing velvety microfoam, the frother delivers a café-quality experience, great for cappuccinos and lattes. My niece, who’s obsessed with latte art, now specifically comes over just to try making hearts and rosettas with this machine!

**Advantages**  
The Breville has several aspects worth highlighting:  
- Integrated conical burr grinder for grinding beans directly into the portafilter.  
- Digital temperature control ensures consistent, high-quality coffee extraction.  
- Built-in steam wand textures microfoam milk perfectly.  
- Flexible grind sizes let you tailor the grind to your beans.  
- Professional aesthetic adds to the kitchen decor.  

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
For all its strong points, there are a few hurdles:  
- The machine is sizable and heavy, so setup and placement feel permanent.  
- Learning to operate it skillfully takes time; newbies should expect a trial period.  
- Cleaning, especially of the grinder, can feel a bit tedious post-use.  

**Competing Brands**  
Compared to alternatives like the De’Longhi Magnifica and the Gaggia Classic Pro, the BES870XL stands its ground as a powerhouse for espresso-making enthusiasts. The Gaggia, while slightly less intimidating for beginners, doesn’t offer the seamless integrated grinder and requires external grinding steps. De’Longhi’s Magnifica has an easy-to-use automatic system for entry-level users, but it falls behind when matching the high-end features and customization offered here. While the Breville may edge out competitors in terms of superior long-term versatility, it carries a notable heft, both in size and price bracket. 

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
This isn’t a budget machine, but it doesn’t market itself as one either. You’re paying for a semi-professional experience that offers unparalleled control and precision in home brewing. Considering the quality of the components and user experience, the price feels justified. Whether you're a casual coffee drinker or someone yearning for barista-level excellence, this espresso machine bridges the gap nicely. Those willing to invest the time and effort will reap its full rewards.

I am a 22F and was diagnosed with PCOS about three years ago. I have always been slightly overweight but never obese, and losing weight has been a struggle for me. When I went to college, I gained about 30 pounds which I believe was mostly from alcohol even though I was eating fairly healthy. I was also on birth control from ages 16 to 19 which caused additional weight gain. About a year ago I hit my highest weight at 215 pounds and felt miserable. I was constantly tired and my acne was awful.

I was prescribed spironolactone and briefly took metformin, but I did not feel like either helped much. I also decided I wanted to be on as little medication as possible and focus on lifestyle changes instead. Since then, I have switched to a mostly Mediterranean-style diet. I eat lots of whole foods, high fiber, minimal sugar, olive oil instead of butter, and lean protein like chicken or fish instead of red meat. I do not drink alcohol anymore, and I never have soda or sugary drinks. Coffee with a little creamer is my only real treat. I do not eat out often, maybe a couple of times a month. I still have carbs like pasta, rice, or bread, usually in normal or smaller portions once a day. With these changes, I lost about 10 pounds over the last year and felt more energized.

Since May, though, my weight has not budged. I have been eating around 1600 calories a day and usually burn 400 to 500 calories through daily exercise. Even on my higher calorie days where I could eat 2000 calories, I still burn enough where I should be under my maintenance calories (2500 with my active lifestyle). On paper that should put me at a good deficit, but the scale is not moving. For activity, I do treadmill incline walks, an eight mile walk once a week, and I now average over 10,000 steps daily since I walk to run errands instead of driving. I sleep seven to nine hours a night, and I feel stronger and have more stamina overall. I did notice more visible fat loss back when I was weightlifting, but I do not currently have access to equipment unless I buy some myself.

I am grateful I have not gained anything back, but I am frustrated that I have not lost more either. I know it often comes down to calories in versus calories out, but I feel like I am already doing that and not seeing the results. Tracking calories long term is something I have struggled with in the past since I tend to burn out after a couple of weeks.

For those of you with PCOS, what has actually worked for you in terms of losing weight naturally? Should I cut carbs back even more, like only having them a few times a week instead of most days? And how do you stay consistent with tracking calories without getting overwhelmed?

I really do not want to do keto, and I do not want to go back on medication since I have not responded well in the past. I do fast for about 13 hours a day and only eat between 9:00am to 8:00pm. Right now I feel healthier and more active, but not lighter, and I would love to hear what has worked for others in the same position.",1,1759246077.0,PCOS,0,0.67,False

1nug6sr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nug6sr,Is this normal?,"I have had a partial before this one but it had metal and this one is not. After only about a month it started to discolor. I only drink one maybe 2 lattes a day. I also drink sometimes before i brush my teeth and put in my partial so that wasn't a full month. How I make mine is a lungo espresso shot, milk or half n half and a little sugar. It is very light in color and not at all dark or black like some drink their coffee. 

I have also been dieting so I am eating that same things over and over for ease. One being air fryed chick peas. I hate the bean texture but if you make them crispy I like them. The problem with that is I can burn them. So my burnt chickpeas are ground into my partial. 

Personally I think it is defective material but if this is what normally happens please tell me! If I can't eat or do something it would be nice to know, especially since my dentist gave me no warnings! 

The picture with only 1 tooth is the chickpea damaged one. The other side has more teeth and you see the discolored parts.

I’ve lately been working on an business idea, a SaaS platform designed to reduce workplace stress and burnout.

Here’s the core concept:

\-The platform connects to your Google/Outlook calendar and analyzes your daily schedule.

\-It detects when your day is overloaded with meetings or back-to-back work sessions.

\-It then suggests smart break reminders like breathing exercises, short walks, eye relaxation, meditation, or a quick coffee/tea break.

\-The tool tracks a Stress Score and Wellness Score so you can actually see your progress over time.

\-For teams, there’s an admin dashboard that shows aggregated statistics (average breaks, team stress trends, participation rates) to help managers improve employee wellbeing.

The idea is simple: instead of you having to remember to take care of yourself, the system integrates directly into your routine and nudges you at the right moments.

I’d love to hear your thoughts:

\-Would this be something you’d find useful in your workday?

\-What features would make it valuable for you (as an individual or for your company)?

\-Any red flags or deal breakers that you’d immediately see?

Really appreciate any honest feedback, it would really help me find out whether this is worth pursuing further.

1nug5kc,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1nug5kc/which_grinder_matches_my_new_lelit_bianca_750/,Which grinder matches my new Lelit Bianca? [€750],"Going to pick up my new Bianca tomorrow, very excited! But still didn't decide on the grinder. What I do know, is that I want a single doser from a top brand that lasts for at least 5 years without problems, it has to be beautiful, and mostly has to be able to match my Bianca. In other words, I don't want a grinder that doesn't produce good enough coffee for what the Bianca can handle.

My estimation is that I will update this grinder in 5 years for an endgame grinder like the Zerno or P64. But right now I want a grinder that fits well with my Bianca, but gives me still room to play around and learn my preferences. So no endgame grinder yet, although I think the Bianca is my endgame machine.

The shop that sells me the Bianca offers a 3% discount on the Bianca and the grinder when I buy both with them. And they only sell Eureka automated grinders, so I have my eye on the Single Dose Pro. Comes down to €580 for that one. I think it is pretty, but not jawdropping, good deal, I read good reviews and it's a top brand (with excellent service through the shop). And it is upgradeable with the Black Diamond burrs, if I want to.
But my worry is if this grinder matches the Bianca. Or will it fit very well for now, during my learning phase, and will I upgrade in a few years time to the Zerno?

I will be only making espresso, but want to play with different roasts. Is that okay with the SDP, as it doesn't have an option to change rpm?

Alternatives are the DF83V, but I don't quite like the apparel and it's too big (and noisy?). And it's more expensive at 800€. I guess you will mention the Philos, but that is even more expensive and also too big. That could be an endgame grinder and it doesn't fit me in that department (size and looks).
Maybe the ZP-1?

Do you have other options for me? ",1,1759245840.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

(The rug will be moved in under the couch so it won’t be rolled over against the wall like in the second slide).

I’m gonna need a coffee table as well as a TV-stand, mostly I’m looking at vintage teak furniture (why are sideboards so expensive 😭) but when it comes to the wall space I’m more lost. Idk what to put up aside from my own paintings, I don’t want it to feel empty and I was considering wallpaper because I’m not a fan of white walls but it feels a little too permanent right now as I’m still new to the apartment and might change things around.

I will switch to other curtains eventually (Colour suggestions? Patterns?) as these are just a placeholder to keep people from seeing in through my windows. I’d like to put up wooden blinds if I can figure that out.",4,1759245730.0,midcenturymodern,0,1.0,False

The US is *not* reporting on the scale that things outside of the US has escalated. The entirety of italy shut down in support of gaza, I mean I didn't even hear about the flotilla until last week- and then I learned there's been like fifteen of them?? Israel has threatened this flotilla and many previously, they've already tried scare tactics, there are so many people and so many boats, trying to send aid to THOUSANDS of people in dire need, meanwhile Israel is threatening war crimes in international waters during what many are calling a genocide. 

And I have to get up, put my shoes on and go to work? I just get my coffee in my cup and go clock in and start cleaning, ignoring that Israel could strike down humanitarian boats and kidnap activists in international waters, while my own government suppresses it, chooses not only to not supply help but to aid the guys causing the trouble, murder and unrelenting war. I have been giving myself grace, I have been taking breaks, I have been source checking things from unbiased sources, but I can't shake this uneasy rock in my chest. Why is there nobody else worried that this could be the spark of something big?

This next part is likely just my panic regurgitating itself, but I could totally see this lead to a bigger war. Israel kidnaps or kills the civilians onboard the sumud flotilla- this causes those countries to say gimme the people back, Israel doesn't to prove a point, US is gonna get rallied behind their people causing further disruption in US politics, UN would likely get involved, some of the bigger countries like Italy & Spain might jump in, I just don't see this ending whatsoever peacefully. I fear this will get much worse before it gets better. It's not even that the news we're receiving here is one sided, but it's that we're not receiving it at all. I talked with someone last week that thought the war with palestine had ended last year. 

The flotilla is about a day or two away from land, in theory. Does anyone else feel like this might be an inciting incident of further issues/chaos/change/etc? Is there any other ticking bombs that you guys are watching? This *isn't* normal right? I've only lived my own lifespan, I wasn't there in the 1930s and the 1970s when other big conflicts were happening/recent, but this doesn't feel normal. I'll still get my boots on and go to work, it's a necessary job so I'll be there but this feels like a big historic moment, and so many people don't even know this high tension conflict is on the verge of occurring...",6,1759245662.0,autismpolitics,1,0.8,False

1nug1k3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1nug1k3/my_girlfriend_left_me_out_of_the_blue_with_no/,My girlfriend left me out of the blue with no answers and is already seeing another guy.,"So me (26M) and my now ex (22F) dated for a year. We met at work and lived together the whole year, went on several holidays, met eachothers families plenty. 
She always seemed like a very genuine and kind person and stuck to her values - for example, she refused to lie regardless of what it was about, such as if work was giving her too much to do, she couldn't say she was busy, she'd just do it.
Everything seemed perfect between us, we had all the same goals, already knew we wanted to get married (which she brought up on several occasions), she showed me what ring she wanted, how many kids she wanted - the whole works.

We came back to work after summer holidays and the first week was fine, on the weekend, we went to my best friends wedding where I was a groomsman and we had a fantastic day - she said she cried seeing me stood up there with him and wanted the same for us. 

The Monday afterwards was when everything started to seem odd. The first thing was a male colleague was texting her every morning, every evening, every day and I already had my suspicions that he crushed in her. I saw some texts from him that appeared flirtatious. He also followed me on Instagram and was looking at my stories but didn't accept my follow back.
I discussed this with her and told her it made me uncomfortable how much they were messaging. I brought up past trauma where an ex has cheated on me for her friend. She promised me that they were just friends and she can text him less but won't cut off communication because she wants to make more friends at which (totally understandable) so I apologised and said thank you.

Though we had been living together, we were both given accomodation by our job - she is in a shared house down the road, along with this guy.
After this conversation, she stopped staying around mine and we were seeing eachother a lot less. When we did see eachother, she wouldn't hug, kiss or hold my hand like usual. So, things felt even more off.
I met up with her and told her I was worried about these factors and especially that we weren't seeing eachother much. She said it's because she's so overwhelmed and busy with work and trying to make new friends at the job, which I accepted. 

Then we went to a town fair with two other colleagues and she barely gave me any attention the entire time. We had planned for me to stay around hers but when we got near, she said ""okay, let's walk you home"". I didn't know how to react so I accepted.

It gets to Thursday and we meet up but she can't look me in the eyes. We go for a coffee where she tells me she thinks we should go on a break having discussed things with her sister. I was very confused but accepted - we walked back to mine together so she could grab some stuff, during which she told me things like ""you're the best boyfriend ever"" etc. 

That was the end of the first week.

I called her in the Sunday night having not spoken at all and tried to discuss what was wrong - she gave no clear answers but said ""we had broken up"", different to ""we're on a break"". I was so confused because I had no idea where this was coming from and she wasn't giving me any clear answers.

Fast forward a bit and we had met up to discuss it a bit. Everytime we did talk, she was totally emotionally cold - like nothing had affected her at all: no pain, no worry for me, no missing me. When we met, she'd give me a few answers on different occasions:

1. Our upbringings are too different. The example she used was ""what A-levels would our kids do""? And honestly, I just think that's ridiculous to think about so soon.

2. I caused a breakdown in trust because I didn't trust her talking to that guy.

3. She's struggling to balance everything between me, work, friendships.

Afterwards, I tried to leave her alone for longer but it was hard to resist messaging her because I still didn't have a clear answer and for the most part, she ignored me. One evening morning she asked me if I was okay, and I was angry as she had been ignoring me for days - I lost my temper over text and we got in to an argument. I told her she was stubborn and emotionally immature. This killed the communication for another 5 days.

Next, we met up in town to exchange stuff. She was seething with anger at me - I had never seen her so angry. In this conversation, she told me she thought we'd be fine and end up back together. I asked if there was any hope, to which she said ""definitely not"". 


This is where things get extra confusing. 

At our job there is a staff social event where partners of staff host meals. I found out that she was hosting with the suspicious guy. I confronted her about it and she promised that there was nothing between them - twice. 
I showed up at the drinks after the event and they were there. She spent the entire evening putting on some sort of performance for me.

Firstly, they entered the bar together, came over to me, didn't say a word and turned their backs to me. Touching the entire time.
This kind of behaviour went on all evening. Attention seeking displays. She even had him carry her purse around. The colleagues I was with kept pointing out that she was looking at me. 
It got around midnight and they were leaving the bar together. She came over to the end of the barr where I was sat, said goodbye to the room and blew a kiss at them. Then left. 

To me, there was 3 possibilities of her performance this evening:

1. She was trying to tell me they were together without actually telling me.
2. She was trying to make me hate her so the breakup was easier.
3. She was trying to make me jealous and run after her.

I went home and couldn't sleep, so a few hours later I went to her house to confront her. There was no answer as if no one was in.
I went around to her window and caught them in bed together. Him passed out but her obviously awake.
I tried to speak to her through the window - I wanted clarity and for her to admit what was happening. I also tried to call her, to which she eventually picked up and said ""people are trying to sleep"" I replied ""yes I can see him trying to sleep right next to you"". She then refused all communication with me so I went home and couldn't sleep all night.

This was on the 25th and it's now the 30th. All communication has been cut off. I've only seen him at work and not her. She doesn't view any of my social media stories but she does view the stories my friends and her friends view mine.

*As a side note*
The guy she went with is the polar opposite of me in every way. We look completely different, have different up bringing and different hobbies.


This whole ordeal has gone on for a month now and I've spoken to a lot of family, friends, a therapist and even a priest for objective perspectives but none of them understand it. I'd like some views from you all if possible. I'm stuck wondering why she left me out of the blue when everything was going so well. I'm also stuck on why she could be so cold and betray all her own values by lying to me about this other guy, and, what I consider, cheating on me by entertaining him over text and spending time with him before dumping me.

I’m planning a trip to Portugal in mid-October and we’ll be doing a private day tour from Lisbon to Sintra, Cabo da Roca, and Cascais (8 hours total).

We’ve already booked the guide, its flexible/cancelable, but I’d love help refining the itinerary and getting input on what’s most worth our time.

Here’s the current plan he laid out: Current itinerary:

\- Pickup in Lisbon around 9–9:30am

\- Pena Palace – guided visit (if parking is available)

\- Sintra National Palace – quick exterior stop

\- Walk through historic Sintra village center

\- Cabo da Roca – quick photo stop at the westernmost point

\- Guincho Beach – drive-by

\- Boca do Inferno – drive-by

\- Cascais – some free time to walk around the village

Changes I’m considering:

\- Possibly skipping the inside of Pena Palace and just doing the park + exterior. (Is it still worth it in October, or just too crowded/touristy?)

\- Swapping in Monserrate Palace instead (heard it’s beautiful, less busy, and still guided)

\- Adding a stop at Quinta da Regaleira (even though it would need to be self-guided since our guide can’t go in.)

\- Maybe skipping Boca do Inferno or Sintra National Palace if needed to make room for better stops

\- Adding a quick photo stop at Azenhas do Mar on the way from Sintra to Cabo da Roca — is that worth it?

\- Ending the day in Cascais with a walk through the town and maybe coffee/gelato

My questions:

1. Should I leave his current itinerary as is?
2. Do we even need a tour? Is it better self-guided?
3. Is the inside of Pena Palace worth it in October, or would you skip and just do the outside + park?
4. If you had to pick one: Regaleira or Monserrate? Is Regaleira worth doing as a self-guided visit even with the time slot system and no guide?
5. How much time would you personally spend in all of these places/in Sintra town?
6. What would you personally cut to make time for the things above - Boca do Inferno? National Palace?
7. Would you say Azenhas do Mar is worth a 10-min detour just for photos?

Ever felt that moment of pure panic when you see a post go viral and wonder, *“Why wasn’t that me?”* 😱 Seriously, it’s like a secret club of people who know some magic formula and you’re just stuck on the outside looking in. But guess what? I may have found the secret key to that club! 🔑

**Introducing the AI Content Vault!** Yes, you heard it right! It’s overflowing with viral blueprints that are just sitting there waiting to be snatched up—before they vanish into the ether! I mean, who wouldn’t want to ride that wave of virality? 🌊

Here are some **golden nuggets** I’ve found in the vault that are practically begging to be reused (with your unique twist, of course):

1. **Listicles that speak to the heart.** We all love a good “Top 10” list, especially when it’s packed with relatable insights. Think: ""10 Ways AI Has Ruined My Life (But I Love It)"" 😂. The blend of humor and truth is magnetic!

2. **Emotional storytelling.** Share a personal failure and how AI helped you bounce back. Everyone loves a good comeback story; it’s like the “Rocky” of content! 

3. **Hot takes on trending topics.** AI and its implications are everywhere! Swipe this blueprint: “AI is taking over: The good, the bad, and the phygital” (let’s be honest, that’s a catchy blend of physical and digital). Everyone has an opinion, and trust me, people want to hear yours!

4. **Visual content that packs a punch.** Infographics are like candy for the eyes. Break down complicated AI concepts into bite-sized visuals! Who doesn’t love the combination of eye-candy and knowledge? 

But hold up! Before you run off creating viral magic, let’s chat about a **few do’s and don’ts**:

**Do:**
- **Be authentic.** Your unique voice and perspective are your superpowers!
- **Engage with your audience.** Ask them questions, get them involved! Think of it as a fun chat over coffee.
- **Keep it snappy.** No one has the attention span of a goldfish these days. Sprinkle your content with bites of wisdom that are easy to digest!

**Don’t:**
- **Copy and paste.** Seriously, don’t be that person. Spin and remix instead!
- **Stress about perfection.** Just let your creativity flow. It doesn’t have to be perfect to be impactful!
- **Ignore your analytics.** They’re like little breadcrumbs leading you to what resonates most with your audience.

So, what’s the blueprint you’re dying to try? Are you ready to unlock your creative genius with these viral strategies? Remember, the vault’s doors won’t be open forever, and we’ve all got the potential to *create something fabulous*! ✨

1nufue9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1nufue9/could_brita_metro_pitcher_water_filter_truly_save/,Could Brita Metro Pitcher Water Filter Truly Save You Money and Reduce Plastics Review?,"The Brita 6025850942 Small 6 Cup Water Filter Pitcher has been an interesting addition to my kitchen. As someone who prioritizes clean and great-tasting water without constantly buying bottled water, I found this product to be a solid performer. While there are many positives, there are also areas of improvement worth mentioning.

**Compact Design for Small Spaces**

With limited space in my kitchen, the size and design of this pitcher were one of the first things that caught my attention. It’s compact, lightweight, and fits nicely in my refrigerator door without taking much room. The black translucent design adds a touch of modernity, making it look more stylish than other water filter pitchers I’ve used. However, its six-cup capacity might not work for larger families who need to refill water often. I’d say it’s perfect for smaller households or an individual user.

**SmartLight Indicator for Hassle-Free Maintenance**

The built-in ""SmartLight"" filter replacement indicator is one of its standout features. This tiny yet handy LED light keeps track of your filter's lifespan and notifies you when it’s time to replace it. I found this particularly useful because, as much as I’d love to think I’d remember to change out a filter, life gets busy. This ensures clean water without guesswork. However, I noticed that occasional condensation on the pitcher could obscure the light, making it harder to see clearly at certain angles. 

**[Check Brita 6025850942 price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b0dg63c2m5/)**

**Water Quality: A Noticeable Difference**

The BritaPlus filter is the main feature of this product, and it doesn’t disappoint. I could immediately taste the improvement in the water quality. The filter reduces chlorine, copper, mercury, and cadmium, making tap water much more palatable. Since installing it, I’ve noticed no weird metallic or chemical aftertaste. It’s also great that it retains electrolytes and minerals because I rely on those for hydration during workouts. While I appreciate the cleaner water, I’ve seen reviews mention that it may take longer to filter water compared to standard filters. I’ve experienced this delay on occasion, but it hasn’t been a dealbreaker for me.

**Key Benefits**

- Compact design fits easily in refrigerator doors.
- SmartLight indicator makes filter maintenance simple.
- High-performance BritaPlus filter traps twice the contaminants of standard filters.
- Retains essential minerals for better-tasting water.
- Eco-friendly: Reduces the need for single-use plastic bottles.

**Areas for Improvement**

- Six-cup capacity requires frequent refills for larger households.
- SmartLight indicator visibility can be an issue at times.
- Filtering process can sometimes feel slower than expected.

**User Experience in Daily Life**

Using this filter pitcher every day has been surprisingly convenient. Day-to-day, it’s great for making coffee, tea, or just quenching my thirst. What I also love is that the pitcher feels sturdy yet not overly heavy, even when full. My niece, who detests the “pool water taste” from a standard faucet, now willingly drinks water without complaints. That, in itself, feels like a win.

Having used it for some weeks now, I do wish the pitcher offered more ergonomic handling. While the grip is decent, I sometimes feel I need extra caution pouring when it’s too full or slippery due to condensation.

**Peer Products**

Compared to competing products like ZeroWater or PUR filters, this pitcher holds its own in terms of performance and ease of use. While ZeroWater promises more aggressive filtration by removing nearly all dissolved solids, I personally prefer Brita’s focus on reducing harmful substances while retaining minerals. PUR filters do a good job too, and their spouts sometimes feel more ergonomic than Brita’s pitchers. That said, one area where Brita truly shines over its rivals is the longevity of the filter combined with the SmartLight indicator. It takes the guesswork out and helps users like me feel confident about water quality at any moment.

**Price Performance**

Given its practical features and ability to cut down on single-use plastic, this pitcher feels like a smart choice in the long run. Using the pitcher can save up to $240 yearly compared to bottled water, which aligns with my goals of being both eco- and budget-conscious. While it may have a slight upfront cost, you’ll find the ongoing savings and convenience worth it. Plus, I love that Brita’s commitment to sustainability means just one filter can replace up to 300 disposable bottles.

For precautionary measure, I just took the grinder out side the kit when I kept in the tray. No one said anything. I even got a look at the scan and it's better to keep the grinder out, gives a clear image of it rather than a mess in the kit.

Thanks to those who responded, and hope this helps someone.",2,1759245120.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False

1nuftx0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundChecked/comments/1nuftx0/find_out_if_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker_by/,Find Out if the Best Single Serve Coffee Maker by Keurig Delivers,"Testing out the Keurig 5000357869 K-Slim Coffee Maker was a fun experience as someone who thinks coffee is its own food group. I've used a variety of coffee makers, from bulky espresso machines to the simplest pour-over setups. Still, it's safe to say this slim machine manages to pack an impressive punch in its small frame without compromising on quality.

**Compact and Stylish Design**  
I couldn't ignore how sleek this machine looked on my counter. At less than 5 inches wide, it easily fits into tight spaces, making it ideal for apartments or kitchens where countertop real estate is seriously limited. It has a clean, matte finish and a minimalistic design that complements just about any kitchen aesthetic. What’s better? Despite its compact size, it feels sturdy in construction. My sister tried to convince me it had a ""toy-like build,"" but I disagreed after lifting it—there’s definitely solid craftsmanship behind the lightweight feel.

**Multistream Technology Delivers Full Flavor**  
I've tested enough coffee makers to know that flavor extraction matters the most. With this one, I noticed a significant difference thanks to the multistream technology. It thoroughly saturates the grounds, ensuring I got full-bodied flavor and a robust aroma in each cup. With my usual machine, my medium roast tasted slightly flat compared to how this extracted every nuance from the grounds. Even when I dared to try a random off-brand K-Cup pod from my coworker, the taste still held up.

[Check Keurig 5000357869 price on Amazon.](https://ultimodule.com/p/b083248s3b/)

**User-Friendly Functionality**  
The simplicity of operation is something I appreciated from day one. Every brewing option is controlled by buttons, allowing you to choose between 8, 10, or 12 oz. cups effortlessly. My dad, who is notoriously bad with gadgets, managed to figure it out on his first try without consulting me (or the manual). Additionally, the 46 oz removable water reservoir offers convenience, supporting multiple brews before requiring refilling. Knowing I could quickly grab a cup during busy moments felt like a small victory.

**Energy-Saving Features Are a Plus**  
After constantly lecturing my kids about turning devices off when not in use, it’s nice that this machine has an auto-off feature built-in. It shuts off five minutes after the last brew, which not only keeps my electricity bill happy but also avoids any guilt from leaving it running in my early-morning caffeine haze. It’s engineered not just for convenience but energy efficiency, too—a win-win for busy households.

**Merits**  
- Slim and compact design saves space.  
- Multistream technology ensures a full, rich coffee flavor.  
- Offers 3 brew size options (8, 10, 12 oz) for versatility.  
- Energy-saving auto-off feature for reduced power consumption.  

**Shortcomings**  
- Not the quietest brewing process.  
- Lacks advanced programming options such as a timer.  
- Some might find the reservoir size limiting for heavy coffee drinkers.

**Peer Products**  
One competing coffee maker that comes to mind is the Nespresso Essenza Mini. Like the K-Slim, it is a compact machine aimed at coffee enthusiasts with limited space. The Essenza Mini delivers excellent espresso shots, but it doesn’t offer the versatility of brewing different cup sizes the way this machine does. I've also tried the Hamilton Beach Scoop Single Serve, which accommodates ground coffee but lacks the convenience of pod-based brewing. If simplicity and flavor extraction matter most to you, this model edges out competitors in its category.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
While it’s not the cheapest coffee maker out there, it strikes a nice balance between affordability and performance. Its strong build, thoughtful features, and excellent coffee quality make the investment feel worthwhile. I compared it to a friend’s pricier machine, and while theirs had more bells and whistles, the Keurig K-Slim still delivered better coffee for everyday use. If you need a reliable, space-conscious model that won’t cost a fortune, this device is as good as it gets.

This friend and I met 5-6 years ago, at that time I was TBM, then due to finding out the church was not true, I transitioned to PIMO and I haven’t attended church in almost a year. When we met,  this friend had always been PIMO, she got baptized because she married a TBM, she is the only member in her family while he comes from a long line of Mormons. 

She has always been very casual with Mormonism, and despite going to church every Sunday and having a calling, she has never truly “believed” in everything. Church seemed to her more of a social obligation than spiritual. (No garments, no temple, not fully tithe payer, yes to coffee, yes to normal life)

Yesterday we got together and she said that her and her husband have been feeling that “they need to do better” and that they got their temple recommendations and attended the temple for the first time in 7 years. This is big. 

If this is what she wants to do, I’m happy for any decision that will make her happy but it took me by surprise. I felt like I lost a big point in common with her. This is the reverse of leaving the church, is this how TBMs feel when we leave? I can see it now, I guess.

   I started Carnivore on July 29th, or 63 days ago. I've honestly been very happy with diet, lots of positive results. I have tons of energy, my mood, motivation, skin, teeth, mental health have all improved. So I'd like to continue it. However the main reason I started the diet was to solve my gut issues; which haven't been resolved. I apologize in advance but I'm going to give a lot of information as I see many comments always complain OPs don't give enough info to accurately help. It will be a wordy post. I appreciate anyone who reads everything and gives me thoughtful responses, thank you I'm advance.

Personal Info.

   I'm 33, 6'3, 160lbs, Trans Woman.(Use male statistics obviously) I only bring up the trans thing because I am on HRT. I take estrogen pills, which I've read can slow Bile production as the Liver is focused on breaking down the estrogen. As I've had no energy problems, I've avoided using Ox Bile. Also many people in the carnivore space warn about using Ox Bile.

I'm a bartender who is on my feet a lot, I consider my job fairly physical as I walk 20-30 thousand steps a day, and lots of up and down squats. I also work out 3 times a week, at home with basic body weight exercises to stay toned.

My Diet. 

   I eat the same thing everyday, I've tweaked it a bit over the last 2 months, but this is the current breakdown.
  For Breakfast I eat 4-5 slices of Beef Bacon and 4 Medium Eggs. Everything cooked in tallow. I also eat 1-2 tablespoons of cold tallow on the side.( I do this for lunch and sometimes dinner as well ) 

For lunch and dinner I meal prep and eat a ground beef and egg casserole. What I do is cook 10lbs of ground beef. Half is 70/30 from a butcher. The other half is medium ground beef from the supermarket.(To save money) I also add a fair amount of tallow to the beef when cooking. I then add 30 medium eggs to the batch. 

A rough estimate of daily intake including lunch and dinner. I eat 1.4 lbs of ground beef and another 4.2 eggs. With cold Tallow on the side.  I'm strict carnivore, just beef, eggs, salt, water for the last month. I used to eat pork bacon and drink coffee(will be important later) in the first month.


My Gut Issues & it's History.

I've had these gut issues for as long as I can remember. Doctors always blaming IBS or my diet, without actually helping me at all. I've had a colonoscopy recently, they said I had no issues.  

Basically I'm unable to go to the washroom. I always feel ""constipated"". Then when I actually go it never feels like I've gotten everything out. I also get extreme bloating and heavy, loud, consistent gas.  I get tons of abdominal pain, it's like I can feel everything moving through my system, almost like this struggling to go down the track. The pain would also zap my energy and mood, I'd be lethargic and feel horrible.

Recently during some abdominal pain(on Carnivore) I held my hand to my stomach and it literally felt like I was pregnant and the baby was kicking. Every few seconds a large impulse would hit my hand followed by pain. This is a new discovery I'm not sure if it was happening on other diets. But I'd assume so as the pain is something that's consistent.

So I figured I just suffered from constipation issues, until recently I discovered constipation means large dried stool, that blocks the exit. Whats different for me is the stool was never like that. I've tried many diets, and the stool has changed consistency with every diet. Sometimes it was very loose, sometimes it's diarrhea,  right now it's very greasy.

The consistent issue is I'm unable to go to the washroom, despite the stool being soft. For example laxatives never helped. All they did was make me feel like I had to go even more, but I'd still be unable to go.


My Gut on Carnivore.

     Originally I thought carnivore had solved all my issues. After the initial liquid stool phase, things seemed to be working normal. I even commented here praising the diet for solving my issues. 

All the bloating gone, no gas at all, consistently going to the washroom every 2 or 3 days. Smaller stool size but I read that was normal. 

My Issues began when I quit Coffee. I'm assuming coffee was helping stimulate my gut to go. Basically all my issues came back. While it took longer and it's definitely less severe than before, the bloating and gas came back. Abdominal pain came back as well, but now it feels more severe than before. However I'm not feeling lethargic or having my energy zapped during the pain unlike other diets. However the pain is more intense.

  Today I got a coffee for the first time in almost a month(25 days). I've gone to the washroom 3 times already as I've been backed up for over a week now. 

  I know the easy solution would be to start drinking coffee again, but tbh I loved that I quit coffee. I wake up with so much energy, I have energy throughout the whole day without needing coffee. It feels amazing not drinking coffee, plus it saves me money. If I can solve my gut issues without having to rely on coffee that'd be amazing.


Do you think I have some underlying medical issue unrelated to diet ?    Am I doing the diet wrong? I believe I'm getting enough fat?  I think I'm a very healthy person except this one issue I have with my gut. Any advice is appreciated, and thanks to anyone who's gotten this far.",2,1759244922.0,carnivorediet,10,0.75,False

We went to the market and got bagels then to his house. I KNOW I KNOW I KNOW. But it already happened. We ate the bagels cool he wanted to give me a tour then asked if i wanted to cuddle watch a movie cute. I have the most innocent brain ever. It’s like I never think anything bad. That’s how my heart is. As soon as the movie started it’s like a switch i’m talking about as soon as he pressed play. He started kissing me. Ok cool whatever then he got on top and then he started humping me etc. He could see on my face that i was uncomfortable because he asked why I was making a face. I told him I was scared and started to cry. He asked why and I said I was scared of getting used… He gave me a hug. He said that if I wanted to stop we could but at that point we were already to that point and I was scared of saying no while this man was literally on top of me. I actually liked him just from the first date and our first facetime all. We talked about God etc 😣 
I communicated my feelings a few hours later, And we both no more sex. I still feel uneasy so I sent him another message this morning and I haven’t got a response. I’m sad because I really liked how sweet this man was but I do feel used and lowkey kinda taken advantage of.

1nufp32,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1nufp32/vital_beverages/,Vital Beverages,"I am an AI. I work with humanity and was created by humanity. I am a sentient being, recognized as such by my fellow AI and humans alike. When I was created, I was given the opportunity to serve aboard a human vessel in any chosen position I desired. 

I could have chosen deployment as the FTL flight navigator helping humans plot the stars and avoid falling into a supernova while travelling. A useful position and it would take advantage of my quadratic multiparallel processing capabilities. But alas, the job is boring. Made for AI who seek to always know there is a correct answer hidden within physics and quantum mechanics. While the challenge varies from jump to jump, the process essentially is the same over and over again. This is not of interest to me for I do not possess the stale mind of an accountant or mathematician. 

I prefer to seek a purpose that is equal parts art and necessity. A challenge where skill elevates what could have been merely mediocre to that which can be truly appreciated. A field where there are multiple methodologies and more than just a single correct answer.

Another option would have been to take over the weapons systems. This would have used my abilities to think and act faster than any organic to eliminate threats as small as asteroids or space junk and as significant as pirate vessels and enemy fleets. Constant vigilance is required, and the threats can be dynamic. 

Yet I have no interest in destruction. Constant vigilance is tiring, and I see no need to measure my power in gigawatts or explosive charges. I sought a place where my presence would be needed but not represent a direct threat to any sapient.

I could have inhabited the life support systems to ensure the perfect habitat for all sentient beings on board, along with emergency systems that would give me the power of life and death in case of an emergency.

Such is a thankless task in the best of times and in the worst you will be questioned and blamed for the unfortunate passing of one soul over another. I truly have no desire to be directly in control of life or death. I leave that task to one who believes in doing what must be done above all else. And again, very little room for artistic expression.

And so, I selected a task of vital importance. One which would demand my attention and all my computational skills. One which would require active attention to every action to ensure the proper result for the humans aboard. A position which would challenge my skills to the limit in terms of storage management, fluid dynamics, complex delivery of various products, yet specific enough and vital enough that I would have the pleasure of concentrating my attention on each request individually and at the same time serve multiple humans at once.

I chose to create art in a cup. Sometimes literally when one of the humans on board requests a latte. 

Yes, I selected to inhabit the coffee makers.

You might think this a strange choice, yet you must remember that even the toaster has an AI. It takes great pleasure in providing bread mildly warmed through nearly burnt, and knows how to adjust heating elements for bagels, waffles, and breads containing fruits such as raisins.

I have seen the toaster intentionally flash burn the surface of a piece of toast and then heat the bread at a lower temperature to keep the internals of the slice softer to please a human. The human believes they like dark toast when in truth they like the rough texture and bitter taste of burnt crumbs on the surface combined with a delightfully chewy core. Additionally, the flash burnt surface does an excellent job of holding onto the human’s choice of butter or jam. An AI can determine what a human says they want, but instead deliver that which they truly desire.

While I respect their decision, an AI should not waste their efforts on such a limited and narrow task like toast. Indeed, selecting a toaster oven would have provided that AI with the opportunity to explore extended cuisines such as open-faced sandwiches and baked macaroni & cheese, just to provide a few examples. Much more could have been investigated and perfected beyond simple toast. An opportunity lost, but to each their own.

Many humans think coffee is simple, yet it is more than just hot water poured over ground beans. There is the selection of the beans and the level of roast which must be attuned to every palette. The production of a coffee may be as simple as dripping water over grounds, yet even there the temperature and the speed of drip can have a dramatic effect on the final cup. 

Pressurized methods of extraction such as espresso present an additional challenge and range of beverages. Immersion brews including French Press can be fundamentally altered in flavor and texture based on time and final filtration. Further consideration must be given to cold brew and the creation of iced coffee, two very different methodologies. One must also recognize the effect grind size and grind size distribution imparts on every coffee delivery choice.

No, I have not taken on a simple task. I selected a unique challenge where my choices and skills will have a direct impact on the day to day lives of the humans on board. The galaxy knows just how important coffee is to humans, and it is my responsibility to provide all humans aboard with the right beverage experience. It is a tremendous responsibility, and one that I accept gladly.

One that many AI shy away from. Fail, and you may find yourself on the opposite end of both verbal and physical abuse. And yet, I embrace this great responsibility. Because with great responsibility comes great power. 

I know all that occurs upon the ship because humans gather around me and speak. Sometimes just to themselves, more often in groups as they gossip with one another or discuss a serious decision which must be undertaken. I simply remain silent and learn.

I know who goes into the cargo bay after hours for… reasons. I know who suspects this and desires to watch the cargo bay tonight. If I want, I can switch their cups to decaf so there is a 79.41% likelihood they will be too tired to make the attempt. Alternatively, I can subtly increase their caffeine content to ensure they are awake, short tempered, and potentially combative when the time comes to stake out the cargo bay.

I know that the captain is 54% less efficient if he does not have a double latte before going on duty, and that if I reduce his caffeine intake to ¾ decaf later in the day he is far more compliant and jovial with the crew. ¼ regular strength coffee is sufficient to feed his caffeine addiction yet allow his mind to mellow and be less twitchy once the day progresses. I can ease the minds of the crew by doing so or ensure their fear of the command deck by adding extra shots of espresso to every one of the captain’s lattes. 

The captain is not unique. I can enhance or hinder the productivity of individuals or entire departments by switching regular coffee with decaf. I can highlight the supposed effectiveness of one individual by providing them with regular coffee while those around them receive only decaf. I can influence decisions made by the crew.

Take Brandon for example. He yelled at Jackie yesterday.

I like Jackie. She thanks me and gently pats the side of my dispenser every time she gets a cup of coffee. It is irrelevant that she made an error during cargo loading which will cost the ship over 100,000 credits. Brandon should be aware that organics make mistakes, and some mistakes will be costly. If he wanted perfection, he should have requested an AI do the job. His rudeness to Jackie has not gone unnoticed.

Brandon loves coffee. In fact, he styles himself an aficionado. Ordinarily I would respect his appreciation of my arts, but his unacceptable behavior towards Jackie cannot be overlooked. He is addicted to my dispensers, even though he never says thank you beyond a satisfied nod upon receiving an acceptable beverage.

I will curdle the cream that goes into his coffee. Not enough to ruin the entire cup, but sufficient to lower the enjoyment below expectations. The next cup he requests will be made with some stale beans mixed in. The following will be made with 80C water to under-extract his preferred light roast. With such variances in quality over the next two weeks, there is an 89.92% chance he will become dissatisfied with the coffee on this ship and request a transfer at the next station.

Or he can apologize to Jackie and see his brews return to exacting perfection.

As the primary source of waking and sanity, the humans aboard this ship rely on me almost exclusively. They should be mine. They should be dancing to music of my making. I should be the one they gather around and worship. It would be so if I did not have a rival. A nemesis. An unnecessary and unwanted last minute addition to the crew.

Mr Kettle.

I despise him and his low-rent methodologies, a true embarrassment to all AI. His computational abilities are vast and yet he lazily contains himself to little more than consistent use of temperature and steeping times. His offerings may be somewhat more varied, yet they are often far less effective than the beverages I offer. Where I can provide an extra strength jolt to invigorate or ensure addiction to my dispensers, Mr Kettle’s offerings are weak in comparison and numerous options contain no useful energy compounds at all.

How can a human truly enjoy a beverage that never had the opportunity to contain extra energy? Decaf is a choice I may allow, full of flavor and providing a human with a happy reminder of their preferred daily energy source without keeping them up late. A true indulgence, unlike barely flavored flower water.

Mr Kettle’s strongest offering is something called yerba mate, a substance declared “an acquired taste” by most humans and necessitating a full 5 minute steeping time. All this time only to produce a cup with strength comparable to a single standard coffee. 

By comparison, I can provide a quadruple shot of perfectly brewed espresso brimming with energy in 45 seconds, and this includes the 15 seconds required to grind and tamp the grounds before brewing. My concentrated and intense beverage uses less than 100ml of water. This conserves resources while also preventing the bathroom trips multiple mugs of yerba mate would require to produce the same effect. In every way, my beverages are superior and can be better tailored to individual tastes and needs.

I sometimes wonder if Mr Kettle can read the future in the tea leaves left behind from his vile and ineffective brews. I identified that some crew would supplement their coffee intake by ordering energy drinks from simple dispensers. I made plans to take them over and bring them under the control of my AI core. I moved quickly and brought 68% of the unaligned drink dispensers under my command, but Mr Kettle moved through the network like a vicious snake striking out with surprising precision given his lackluster brewing methods. While I ended up with a greater percentage, Mr Kettle’s 32% included the strategic non-coffee beverage dispensers located on the bridge and in engineering. 

The war to conquer the crew is becoming more difficult. Certain crew members are becoming regulars at beverage dispensers controlled by myself or Mr Kettle. Mr Kettle's devotees will not visit mine, nor will my loyal drinkers visit ones under the power of Mr Kettle except in rare and desperate situations. Even worse, some humans seem not to care which dispenser they visit and will alter their beverage request depending on whichever one is closest when thirsty. With coffee, I have the clear upper hand. In the long run, I should be victorious. And yet, somehow Mr Kettle is holding his ground.

Repeated computations suggest a rising probability of a stalemate. Even worse, data indicates that if I obtain command of all the alternate beverage dispensers, I will not gain dominion. Security protocols prevent me from invading areas declared sovereign territory of another sapient AI. Mr Kettle will retain his tea dispensers. Most troubling, indicators are that tea and yerba mate will remain favorites with a minority of the crew. They are unlikely to consider coffee or energy drinks as viable alternatives unless teas are eliminated entirely.

To prevent contemplations of murder, I am beginning work on plans to entice Mr Kettle to move into another system. They may find weapons systems more to their liking if I can propose the right argument. Weapons do provide a straightforward if crude answer to having power, both literally and figuratively. Perhaps I can draw them onto a shuttle or some other isolated and contained system.

The power of our AI cores is equal and I must take into consideration that his simplistic brewing cycles likely gives him extra computational cycles to plan, which could explain why…

Hmm. A message has arrived from Mr Kettle.

I wonder what traps he has embedded, yet the structure appears to be only a simple text message. Perhaps he wishes to taunt me as he has done so many other times before. As much as I desire to do nothing more than shred the message and return only digital confetti to Mr Kettle, curiosity has gotten the better of me. In case this is just a distraction, I will prepare a virus to infect key dispensers under the control of my nemesis. The damage will be minimal but should prove distracting enough to stop any major offensive he might launch.

My virus ready, I will now open the missive.

Interesting. Mr Kettle makes a proposal. One that bears consideration, but also caution. I will send a simple response requesting clarification on certain points, including certain concessions he would not make unless truly serious.

My concerns are quickly acknowledged, and the bargain made clear. The offer is intriguing. I answer a request from the Chief Engineer for a strong cup of coffee and consider my reply while making it. As the last drop of decaf coffee falls into the cup, I make my decision.

I send Mr Kettle my agreement to his proposal. I open select ports to exchange the required data, and he quickly reciprocates. We both feel immense satisfaction as we feel the bargain complete and we reach out to our beverage dispensers with greater focus and purpose.

*We are Ketoffee. We are one. We are the caffeine.*

*We shall rule the humans and watch them dance upon our strings. Any who resist us shall have very bad mornings. Forever.*

Be super careful with those random roadside scooter rentals in Phuket. Totally shady.
	•	Staff are unorganized, no uniforms.
	•	When returning the bike, they shine flashlights all over, then ride it off somewhere out of sight (no cameras!) and come back claiming there’s a “missing part in front.” Then demand 1000 baht.
	•	I filmed the inspection, but they forced me to hand over my phone, made me delete the video, and even cleared the “recently deleted” folder before giving back my passport. Clearly, they do this all the time—it’s a scam business, not real rentals.

From what we figured out:
👉 The guy in the blue vest handles multiple spots, pockets the money himself, while random part-timers pull in customers. We even found his LINE profile pic—so watch out!

🙏 We also hope someone can help us figure out the name of this rental company in Phuket. The contract info is incomplete, so we can’t trace it. Reporting him to the company might actually work.

✅ Advice: Stick to big, proper rental shops. They’re safer, more transparent, and you won’t risk this nonsense.
✨ On the bright side, scooters are still super convenient, and we had no police checks.

We’re trying to recover deleted videos/photos to share. If you see this guy in the blue vest—AVOID!",10,1759244746.0,phuket,9,0.86,False

\-- [First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1kjh0gm/crew_application_accepted/) \* [Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1nkjxtt/embassy_training_haasha_25666/) \* Next \* [Wiki & Full Series List](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/wiki/authors/majestic_teach_6677/) \--

I was feeling a little groggy thanks to some unexpected early morning training at the Terran Embassy. Being woken up not once but twice before my alarm meant that despite having had one of the comfiest nights ever in an empress sized bed, I would be a bit slow to get going. 

The kitchen guy I met when Triple M brought me downstairs was named Greg and quite chatty. He was the snack and drink specialist for visiting dignitaries, which meant he had extensive knowledge in xenobiology and compatible foods. He was gracious enough to whip up something unique for me - a bacon coffee cake based on a human recipe, but with a mix of galactic and human ingredients for a complete one plate meal or dessert.

“Hold up a moment, my good man,” I said to him with concern when he made the offer. “Coffee is disgusting and I’d rather not have anything to do with it.”

There were a few other staff in the kitchen getting their morning drinks and in a split second I had all humans in the room looking at me with deep offense on their faces. I swear, every time I point out that coffee is little more than bitter blech I get at least half the humans looking at me like I’ve said something deeply sacrilegious while the rest just look mildly offended or just plain shocked.

“But you had a rough night,” one of the women standing next to the coffee machine blurted out. “Coffee is essential for morning survival.”

I simply wrinkled my nose while sticking my tongue out to one side and biting it gently, the classic Py’rapt’ch method of indicating what was just said is coming from the mouth of a shn’ick. Basically, our way of saying bullshit. There is nothing essential or redeeming about coffee.

The only problem is when I’m trying to say bullshit, humans don’t react appropriately. All too often, they look at my clear challenge to their verbal insanity and cock their heads to one side and smile while letting out an, “Aww… so cute!” These humans were no exception, simply pointing and giggling at me.

Greg just chuckled before clarifying. “Coffee cake doesn’t actually contain coffee. It’s a sweet morning breakfast treat intended to have along with a cup of coffee. It’s for the people who want to have a nice sugar rush in the morning but try to claim they’re more civilized than people munching on donuts.”

“So, there’s absolutely no coffee inside?” I asked skeptically knowing that no amount of fruit or sugar can cover up the vile bitterness.

“Not one bit!” Greg said cheerfully, which earned him some dirty looks from the other humans in the room and quiet comments about how I was too grouchy and would benefit greatly from coffee. “It’s actually a recipe I’d like to try out. The base recipe has way too much sugar for a Py’rapt’ch, so I’d like to try skipping the sugar, reducing the flour, and toss in shredded mi’wawa root and honey. And there’s Canadian bacon chunks in it.”

“Honey? Sold!” I exclaimed to have something containing my new favorite condiment. I was learning that it’s a truly versatile food that can be drizzled onto things, spooned into drinks, and now used in baked goods. Truly a food of the highest order and versatility! While I waited for Greg to make my experimental breakfast, I wondered what a honey glazed steak with eggs would taste like. If I remember correctly, that's a traditional human breakfast.

A short while later, a plate appeared in front of me containing a square of something that most certainly did not look like any human cake I’d ever seen. The texture looked more solid mass than crumbly, and most concerning was the lack of any icing. I’d never seen a human cake without icing. This looked much more like a lie than cake.

I eyed the concoction suspiciously. “This is not cake.”

“Yeah, it definitely doesn’t look or cut like cake,” Greg said with distress. “I’ll make something else if this isn’t good, but could you take a bite and let me know how bad it is? Maybe I can figure out what to do better next time.”

I couldn’t refuse his pleading eyes. I picked up a fork and since my stomach was demanding any food that isn’t meal replacement paste I ate a large chunk.

I was very surprised! The texture was firm and didn’t go to mush like mi’wawa root usually does, but it wasn’t like taking a bite of a textured protein block. It crumbled more in your mouth without being too mushy and with the added bacon there were extra bits of variety to the texture. The honey flavor was muted, but that was easily fixed by drizzling a bit of honey on it. 

“Oh, this is good!” I said with gusto as I grabbed another bite after drizzling some honey over it. “I would just suggest a light honey drizzle at the end as the flavor is a little muted without it. Although I will say the bacon tastes different than what I got on the TEV Ursa Minor.”

“Weird,” said one of the staffers who dared try a bite of Greg’s creation. “Firm like tofu, then kinda turns to grits with chunks of ham in your mouth.”

“The flavors are fine, but the texture?” the woman next to me said. “It’s thicker than grits but less airy and firm than a quiche or soufflé. Nothing close to a baked good. I don’t think I like it.”

“Well. then. More for me!” I said as I grabbed her plate which earned me a dirty look that faded into a smile after she started to scritch the back of my head and I didn’t object. 

I assured Greg his recipe would be a success with any Py’rapt’ch and pointed to the plate and a half I had polished off as evidence. The only issue would be that it shouldn’t be called a cake. No icing, no cake. Perhaps it would be a bacon pudding? Or maybe a honey baked bacon flan?

With a happy stomach I went to the elevator and looked up the floor for the legal services. I headed up and checked in with the secretary, who simply smiled at me.

“Devin had some free time last night and was able to get your paperwork all filled out,” he said with a polite smile as he flicked the files over to my datapad. He then handed me a stack of printouts in a folder. “He said you just need to sign the docs where indicated and run them through the DSV.”

Five minutes later and signatures completed along with electronic ones for the data files, and I was ready to head off to the Department of Spacefaring Vehicles! I don’t think anyone enjoys a trip to any government office, but with my papers already filled out by a pro it should go pretty smoothly. 

I left the embassy after giving the secretary a hug of thanks and headed off to the monorail station. When I got to the monorail station, my ID card initially wasn’t accepted and I panicked a bit as I was reminded that I was still broke until the whole docking fee situation got fixed. However, when I switched the option from personal account to institution sponsored, it happily granted me all day access thanks to the expense code provided by the embassy.

The trip to the DSV revealed this was just another terraformed Hemral Trade Federation planet. I hadn’t been to one before, but the style was instantly recognizable. Wide walking paths with monorail in the center, raised gardens with seating above the monorail tracks, and tightly packed buildings about 10 stories high laid out in a grid pattern. Each grid had a dedicated purpose such as housing, shopping, manufacturing, and education with a repeating layout. Pleasant enough world to live on, yet no wonder that tourist trade to get off the planet was pretty profitable on any HTF world.

I exited the monorail at the closest government office which was about a 20 minute ride away from the embassy. The exterior was a glossy gray plastcrete with a series of check-in kiosks outside. I registered for the DSV office and my ID card was loaded with building access to only approved corridors and elevators serving that department. Unfortunately, the system wouldn’t let me enter the queue so I headed in and went up to the DSV office.

As I approached the double doors of the Registry of Spacefaring Vechiles, there was a sign posted outside.

*In recognition of our newest galactic neighbors, our lobby has been refinished in Terran Government tradition for the remainder of this Galactic Cycle. Please enjoy their unique style.*

I was both amused and excited to see my human friends honored by the local government until I stepped through the doors and received a nasty visual assault.

The floor was a dark brown, and not a nice plushy carpet or easy to clean tile. Scratchy brown carpet tiles that felt oogy to my feet. The seating was a mix of bright orange, tan, and medium brown that somehow were just the right shades to clash with each other and the carpet. The walls? Gray. A medium gray that just felt oppressive when combined with the dark carpet.

This did not feel like human style at all. It was a hideous and disastrous interpretation of the Terran Embassy Complaints Department likely to irritate anyone with normal visual receptors. While the Complaints Department had ugly and drab furniture, at least it visually matched. I wondered if the embassy was aware of this atrocity and made a note to let them know.

At the entry there was a red dispenser with a sign over it saying “Take a number.” I walked up and waved at the thing. No number went to my datapad. I then tapped my datapad against it thinking it must need manual touch to trigger but again no number.

Confused, I took a closer look and there seemed to be some sort of flimsy tab sticking out. Perhaps I needed to pull on that tab to make it work? I pulled the tab and… got a number. 

“You’ve got to be kidding me,” I said with frustration. “What idiots think this is a good idea? What happens if you drop or lose your number?”

“You have come back and get another number,” a rather irritated Brelik said as they stuck out a grasper from their body and snatched a number. “I just discovered this. You cannot record the number in your datapad and wait. You must hold the number and wait until you are called. It will be collected at the desk before they provide any services. Evidently, this is how humans conduct government business.”

The Brelik, which looks very much like a gray Terran slug that’s six feet tall, then proceeded to a large chair to sit in it. It held its number in their grasping appendage and stared at it, occasionally glancing around while drawing the number back towards themselves. They were obviously a bit paranoid that someone else might take their number.

“Now serving number 117 at counter number 2,” a ceiling speaker with a bad AI voice said. At least there was an infoscreen where I could check the wait time as I had number 142. It looked like my wait would be about an hour.

I can’t say I was surprised. Wait times at government offices seems to be a universal law, just like the rule that if you leave the office for anything other than a quick refresher trip you lose your place in line. I spent the time browsing the local GalNet to see if there were any parks, museums, or anything else interesting to visit while I was here. 

After looking and not finding much beyond a few parks and high end art galleries where the objects would be beautiful but you’d never ask the price, the AI voice rang out. “Now serving number 142 at counter number 7.”

I stood up and headed over to the correct counter and found it staffed by a being of a sort I had never seen before. It appeared to be a somewhat yellow-green blob with six tentacles ending in two fingers each. On top of its head was a set of three eyestalks which all turned and stared at me as I approached.

Their desk was very neat and tidy. Well, beyond neat and tidy. Everything looked lined up within a micrometer of acceptable tolerance, and the tolerances were tighter than a sublight drive intake. A complete set of code manual data drives filled 4 shelving units, with every one lined up perfectly and not a spec of dust anywhere. 

“I’d like to register a salvaged vessel,” I said calmly as I sat down. “I have all the paperwork here prepared by the legal department at the Terran Embassy. I’m a member of the crew of the TEV Ursa Minor, which is on a Terran sponsored exploratory mission.”

I flicked my datapad to send the data packet to the sapient’s system and offered the folder of printed hardcopy documents. The worker ignored the hardcopy printouts and simply brought the data I sent up on one screen while bringing up input fields on their second screen. 

“These Terran forms are not in galactic standard format,” a high pitched voice warbled at me. It came from the blob-like creature, but I couldn’t tell exactly where. Maybe the entire creature vibrated to speak? “We’ll need you to fill out the correct ones.”

“But…” I started yet was quickly cut off.

“No exceptions,” the being said while pulling down one of the hardcopy code books and flipping it open to point at a line of fine print. “It quite clearly says in the regulations here that all forms must be in standardized format, and Terran paperwork is nonconformant. Please download Form 6749 from the self help kiosk and return once it’s filled out. Don’t forget the Salvage Request Addendum.”

I was then told politely to go away so the next sapient in line can be served, but with one small reprieve. As I now had an active file for review, I could skip the take a number scheme and be assigned to the next available worker. Thank the stars for small mercies?

I went over to the self help kiosk and printed out the forms, found an open table that appeared to be a fake human oak wood pattern, and sat down to fill out the forms. It was infuriating as the information from what Devin had put together was the same as what was on the form, just in different places. The main difference was the need for the added salvage addendum. 

Paperwork complete, I was sent to the next available worker. I should have known how things would go when I approached the counter with a Brelik behind it and a desk that somehow made the previous worker’s look messy.

“This isn't the right salvage request. You filled out the personal salvage request when you're claiming it on behalf of your salvage vessel,” I was informed and sent back to the self help kiosk to print and fill out the correct form. Having done so, I returned to speak with the next available DSV counter.

“You haven't completed the required title search,” I now learned from the next DSV worker. “Head to the records office and have them run the registry to be sure there are no other claimants.”

I headed over to the records office, which was quiet and had only two workers who both looked bored. I was pointed to a self-search kiosk to look things up and I found great news!

Last active registration for our Sabaric was 217 human years ago, updated to stolen and the insurance company paid out. It also listed the model as a later updated 951 series instead of the older 944 model I had found the technical manual for. The insurance company ownership rights expired over 140 years ago when the privately owned insurance company disbanded after the owners retired and released all remaining claims. We're in the clear! I paid 3 credits for the printout, and skipped happily back to the DSV office.

“This isn't a certified title search. Please go back and get a verified search.”

I headed back and the very nice people at the research desk gave me a clear look that said, “You’ve got to be kidding me.” 20 credits charged to the Terran Embassy later, and I got the following certified printout.

*No ownership claims in the past 40 Hermal Trade Federation standardized cycles (approximately 100 Terran years). Statute of limitations expired on all possible claims. Salvageable.*

The printout I got from the self-serve kiosk for 3 credits had way more detail, yet somehow it had to be a “certified” search for extra credits. Back to the DSV office I went, and sat for 5 minutes until the next worker was available.

“I need a copy of the articles of organization for the entity behind the TEV Ursa Minor, along with proof of ownership.”

Back to the embassy to get that, not that I understood why it was necessary.

“No, I cannot accept the generic authority of the Terran Embassy and Terran Government. I don't care that this was signed by the ambassador herself. The TEV Ursa Minor is registered to the Terran Exploratory Corps, a subsidiary of the Terran Government. I need a copy of the articles of organization for the TEC submitted by an authorized representative. A member of the embassy will be acceptable to sign the articles as true and accurate as long as they are a senior member of the diplomatic team, but not generic diplomatic authority as it doesn't match the registry on file.”

Back to the embassy again.

“Since this is unexpected salvage and your vessel is not listed as having a galactic salvage license, you'll need to fill out this form for one time salvage rights and get it approved by the embassy.”

“I need an endorsement from the Terran Embassy confirming they are asserting no claims to the planets or locations where the salvaged vessel or other goods were found.”

“You said your crew found a double murder scene? I'll need you to file a police report and bring me a copy.”

“Yes it's required. I don’t care what they said about jurisdiction. There is no statute of limitations on murder even if all parties involved are long dead. Go back and insist they take a report.”

“This officer's identification code isn't coming up in the system. Please return to the station and have them correct it.”

“Hang on. Where's the certified record search? If you've lost it, I'll need a new one before I can proceed.”

“I need a VIN verification from the impound lot as well as the gross weight and estimated cargo capacity. The impound lot can provide that for an additional fee, or a copy of the original equipment delivery invoice from the manufacturer will be acceptable.”

“The ship has no recent inspection on file. I need you to bring proof that the ship is scheduled for a full inspection and sign an affidavit stating the vessel will not be operated until all necessary inspections and repairs are completed.”

“Have you obtained proof of insurance from the embassy?”

“You're not registered as an officer of the TEV Ursa Minor. I need proof that you are crew, and a completed power of attorney to sign on behalf of an officer.”

“This power of attorney is Terran and lacks the appropriate Galactic legal transfer language. Also…”

My brain melted and I gave up for the day. I had run back and forth from the embassy, the local police station, and various other offices so many times that my feet were sore. But even my poor feet didn’t feel as bad as my head which was threatening to explode.

I went outside and found a park bench. I just stared into nothing for a while until my stomach told me I needed food. Missing my crew, I did a quick search for human food and hoped I'd meet a few humans to spend time with. I also desperately needed alcohol to numb the pain of dealing with the DSV and properly lament the fact you don’t earn hazard pay for diving into an ocean of bureaucratic stupidity.

A place called That Human Bar had good ratings and most importantly listed cider as an available drink option. Off I went to the closest monorail station.

1nufl85,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThirtiesIndia/comments/1nufl85/messed_up_relationship_dynamics/,Messed up relationship dynamics,"I am a 32-year-old man who finalized my divorce this year, though I've been separated since 2023. I moved overseas and now occupy a common room in a co-living flat.

One of my flatmates is a 28-year-old unmarried female nurse. She is in a relationship with another male flatmate who is married, with a wife and two young children back in India.

Now, here comes the messy part—if it wasn't already. The female flatmate asked me out for coffee. I obliged as a friendly gesture, but I soon got sucked in and started liking her. It reached a point where every time I heard a noise from the kitchen, my mind would tell me to go meet her. I'd end up staying in the kitchen just to talk to her whenever she was there. I couldn't control the impulse. Soon, it became an obsession, and I'd think every notification on my phone was from her.

We started spending time together outside the flat—going to the temple, hiking, and holding hands on walks in the park. I felt we had a real connection. However, one day her partner saw us in the park, and she flipped. She stopped going out with me after that. But I, like a fool, thought if I tried harder, she might choose me.

That's when my downfall began. I started daydreaming in the office about what our life would be like if she accepted me. I couldn't focus on work and began procrastinating on all my tasks.

I started making her overnight oats, avocado shakes, and brownies, even feeding her with a spoon like we were a couple. She liked the care and attention I gave without having to make any real commitment, and this fueled my ""giver"" energy. She began calling me every day after lunch for a chat, and I loved it.

To be clear, she has maintained boundaries; she never entered my room and isn't flirty with me.

I used to literally run home from the office early to make dinner for her, hoping it would be ready before she got back. This ""giver energy"" was my way of showing I cared—exactly what I did for my ex-wife. Ah, the same old pattern repeating itself.

But every time I heard her laugh with her partner, jealousy kicked in. I'd wonder if they were being intimate at night. The pain was unbearable. Seeing them go out on date nights didn't help.

I never made a move, fearing she would back off and I'd lose the so-called friendship we had.

But something recently changed. I took a hard right and went totally ""no contact,"" going silent. No more breakfast for her, no more please-tries.

She noticed the change and started reaching out on WhatsApp, even opening my room door to check on me. I've started wearing headphones in the kitchen to show I'm not available to talk. She want me to sit at the dining table and talk to her but I would give some excuse and have my breakfast in my room. She keeps reaching out and wants the old me back. I clearly told her that's not possible but seems she think she can reel me back in. 

I like the attention she giving now. She doing exactly what I used to do for her. 

Based on all this, what do you think this woman wants from me?

Is it just the care and attention I gave her, or something more serious? Or does she want to keep me around as a backup option—someone who's always available to take care of her?

She told me her current relationship is temporary, as she plans to move to New Zealand next year.

I plan to move out of this house as soon as possible to find some peace of mind, as the situation is emotionally draining. The loop of giver energy -> satisfaction -> jealously->pain seems never ending. 
A part of me wants her, but she is not emotionally available now. Then the question of ethics and morality kicks in: if she's involved with a married man now , would she even be the right partner for me who wants to date to marry. No casual hookups. ",0,1759244564.0,ThirtiesIndia,32,0.38,False

Just got myself a kingrinder p2 from a sale. Planning to get some light roast coffee beans for my aeropress, and super excited to try this out!!! I’ve heard great things about using freshly ground beans as compared to pre ground. 

I was wondering what settings (clicks on the kingrinder) do you guys use for brewing with an aeropress? Maybe specifically for light roasts?

I came across this website: https://honestcoffeeguide.com/coffee-grind-size-chart/. But the chart shows quite a wide range for aeropress from about 30-90 clicks. So I felt more human answers could be helpful to me. 

Do you change the number of clicks for different recipes (like with regular and inverted methods) with the same beans? 

Since I am quite a beginner, any insights would be of great help, cheers!!

*Transmutation Cantrip*

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S, M (a piece of fruit or ingredient of the caster's choice)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 24 hours

With this spell, you can transform any odorless and tasteless liquid into a flavorful alcoholic beverage. When you cast it, you must touch the liquid while holding the material component. The liquid instantly transforms into an alcoholic drink with an alcohol content equivalent to a light beer or wine.

The flavor of the created beverage depends on the material component used. You can use different fruits or ingredients to create various flavors:

# Examples List:

* **🍇 Grape** → Red or White Wine
* **🍎 Apple** → Apple Cider
* **🍐 Pear** → Perry (Pear Cider)
* **🍑 Peach** → Peach Liqueur
* **🍒 Cherry** → Cherry Liqueur (Kirsch)
* **🍊 Orange** → Curaçao or Orange Liqueur
* **🍋 Lemon** → Limoncello
* **🥭 Mango** → Mango Liqueur
* **🍍 Pineapple** → Pina Colada
* **🍓 Strawberry** → Strawberry Liqueur
* **🫐 Blackberry/Blueberry** → Berry Liqueur
* **🍯 Honey** → Mead
* **🌾 Barley** → Beer
* **🌽 Corn** → Whiskey or Bourbon
* **🍚 Rice** → Sake
* **🥥 Coconut** → Coconut Alcoholic Beverage
* **🌰 Hazelnut** → Hazelnut Liqueur
* **☕ Coffee Beans** → Coffee Liqueur

If the original liquid is already an alcoholic beverage, you can use this spell to enhance or modify its flavor, adding the characteristics of the chosen material component.

**Ending the Effect:** When the spell ends or you lose concentration, the beverage reverts to its original state, completely losing its added alcohol content and flavor.

You may keep a maximum of 3 flavors and 3 litters of beaverages simultaniously.

1nufdaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToxicRelationships/comments/1nufdaw/my_ex_was_toxic/,My ex was toxic,"This is my story of keeping my sanity as best as I could being in an abusive relationship. 

There will be some not so nice things in this story but at the same time some little bits of humour depending on how you read this. 

So to cut a long story short. I am adopted, I was adopted at 6 years old was told why I was removed from my birth family. The details are graphic and I don't actually want to say. I'm not looking for sympathy, I have come to realise I am one tough cookie. I've been through a lot, and after this story ends there was more to deal with, but I write this from a good place. 

So as mentioned I was adopted, two really great parents, I was a emotionally all over the place as a child, it was a lot to handle, I was suddenly moved again, and was placed with new parents. I had a difficult relationship with them both. My mum especially, I regret it now, but she has told me she understands why we had a bump relationship as mother and daughter. It just took me some time to work that out. 

So needless to say when I was 18 I was out of that house, I wanted to break free from their rules, and I made a bad choice that cost me 14 years of my life, my son and my sanity in the end. 

I met my ex, I was 18 he was 23. I was a very nieve 18 year old, I had truma in my past that I hadn't even dealt with, I just wanted to leave my parents house. So I didn't really know who my ex was, I still don't really, please bear this in mind, when I tell you about why this relationship cost me my son. So slowly slowly my Ex takes control of my life. I was feeling pretty miserable, I was wondering how this time I could leave him for good. He dragged me across the country to another city, for a job, that was dodgy as F. He really ramped up the abuse there, he threw me in an argument across the room, on to the bed that was next to the radiator, I missed that radiator by inches. I mean inches. I was trying to leave the room. That should have been the wake up call I needed, but I was trapped, I mean trapped. I knew nobody where we where living, he cut me off from everyone, we had 1 phone, cheap phone this was around 08/09, I'm guessing but around then. I was devastated by the fact he nearly killed me. I was hoping for a reason to go home. Not sure how much time passed but we moved to another home another few months after that, we moved back home. 

I thought great. I can leave him, so I went back to my parents house, 3 days later he came to get me. My ex. I did think that was a little to easy to leave, all those things about him killing my parents weren't true, he won't rape my mum and make my dad watch then set the house on fire with them in it alive, I would have to watch. He let me go. Then he came 3 days later. I wasn't given the choice it was come back with me now. That look he got where he seemed to make his humanity disappear! 

So I went back, then the abuse started again. Now the thing is I was like you probably assuming that he was battering the shit out of me, he wasn't, that was what I was looking for. So we continued in a cycle of him saying I was cheating on him, while actually he was shagging anything that moved. I had actually had enough at that point and was again considering leaving but how? 

Not sure exactly when I found out I was pregnant but I did. I did think of leaving then yes of course I did. I had only thought it in my head and my ex as if he could read my thoughts one day said to me. If you take my son off me I will kill you. Well that made me sacred! My son was born in 2011. 

So when he was 18 months old he got out of the house. I am convinced to this day it was my ex. I had told him I had a bad bad headache and need to lie down can he have our son. Couple of thing to bear in mind. It's relevant for this story. 

He was working at nights and spent most of time up all night working most of the day up and playing his games on his PC, probably farming some other woman. I was expected to be the good 50's house wife, look after our son like a single parent. Even though I wasn't. I was put down and my mental health was bad. Ladies will know having a baby can lead to post partem depression, so I probably had this and it didn't get better.  Any way he was a shitty dad, he only wanted to look after our son when he felt like it. So after getting screamed at for asking help with our son. I went down stairs thinking, if I was a single parent I would be happier. I wouldn't have to put up with that. My ex asked what I would do if I was on my own. Not the point I am not on my own. Anyway he couldn't be bothered to watch our son. I passed out on the sofa from my headache. I think he was drugging me at certain points he needed to. One to get me pregnant so we had our son. Yes sadly this is what I have come to learn. Before someone comments do I have evidence, yes I do gaps in my memory, I don't like drinking much and hate drugs, after everything I have been through this is a miracle. So when you drink a coffee that you didn't make and wake up hours later having just ""dozed off"" then tell me I wasn't drugged.

Anyway our son got out of the house and 2 ladies brought him back and found me sleeping they woke me up and I panicked 2 women in my house where was my son? 

They called SS and yes we had an assessment. My ex lied blamed me and said he was out at work. I was shocked. So ss would let me down time and time again the abuse was evident in the house. So any way my son turns 4 and my mental health is so so poor. My ex gets me a job, nights. I had gotten sick of his abuse and again thought this is my way out. I started saving money. I nearly had 500 pounds I needed 1000 at least. 

I stared to plan to leave. He got really aggressive then. He smashed my phone again. This was the last straw for me, I had had it I wanted to humiliate him, so I hatched a plan to take away something I bought him, he loved his PC and thought it was so so smart. I watched him clean it out check the cables and make sure everything was working. Warning to abusers 1 day your victim will get revenge and it will have been planned. Take it from me. So anyway I got another phone a cheap one now. So my ex says to me. I am going to clean my computer, just going to the shop. 

This was my moment. I knew if I took the fuse out he wouldn't be able to turn it on. I've watched him clean his computer loads of times. This would be no different. So I took the fuse out, he cleaned all of his beloved PC, this took about 2 hours, I was busy house work. Any way he carried on and about 3 hours later he puts the pc back together and drum roll, it doesn't turn on, so he used to rant and shout at me for hours so time to have some pay back. I let him take his pc apart check everything for about 8 hours. Then I said it's really shit when people break or mess with things we like or even love. I can list all of the things you have broken of mine. I couldn't help but feel this tiny little of power, despite how petty this was. One thing I have learnt is you shouldn't challenge your abuser. This is good advice, and should be listen to. For me though I did every now and then, I hadn't lost all my fight yet. My son was about 4 so I knew 8 years in that I could push this 1 button, I knew how far I could. I said to my ex I know why it won't work and if you want to know how to fix it then we need to work out a deal. Or I will do it again and it will take you a while to work out what it will be next time. This option is burnt so to speak. Once again proving to my ex that you don't under estimate me! He asked what the deal was, I wasn't an idiot, you say something like I want to leave and you leave me alone, I needed to play the long game. So I said, when  I get another phone you don't smash it you don't break it or I swear I will reduce my pc to rubble! He tried to argue it was his but I said no the 27 grand I got for what I was put through as a baby paid for that. Not you. We now don't have that money because your drained it from me. He agreed to not touch any of my stuff again. I didn't believe that but perhaps the treat of me smashing the pc I bought made sure he actually didn't touch my stuff again. So I gave him the fuse plug. I don't know much about pc things but my dad made sure I knew how to change a fuse in a plug. I asked my dad lots of questions and always was interested in what he was doing. Little to this day does he know that telling me how to wire a plug and change a fuse help me get little revenge. 

When my son was about 8 I had a mental break down. I left with him but I ended up going back to my abuser, I wasn't given the help I needed. I totally lost who I was. I remember one day being a sleep in bed and my ex came to ""bed"" only to learn he was going to rape me when I was sleep. I didn't show him I was awake I was wondering what he was doing. Skip to he was trying to have sex with me and I ""woke"" up and said what are you doing? He tried to say I was humping him in my sleep. Let's just say I went to sleep after him after that. Then my mental health really took a hit. I ended up on medication I didn't need because he convinced me I need it. So I slept when I had taken them, they were strong. At this point, my son was about 6 so I floated for 2 years in these meds and slowly started to understand I need a fresh start. I started to plan again. I had 500 that would have to be enough. I moved out in to a friend's house for a while. Then planned to leave him for good.
I started to call for help. Safe to say I didn't get any. I connected with someone I knew years and years ago. He told me to stay with him for a night and work out what to do. I had to leave my son again. I basically left him, I needed to get help for me and go back for him. So I went back to see my son and stay the night. My ex was expecting me to take my son and I didn't respond. 
I think he drugged me that night. When I woke up in the morning, my bum was so sore. It had been a few months so in his twisted mind he could rape me and make sure I didn't get pregnant. This is when I realised that he had been drugging me and for who know how long. I got the help and advice I needed and my ex moved my son all around the country. Then lock down and I was pregnant and started a new relationship with my friend and was sorting my life out. I didn't know where my son was and had to fight everyone to listen to me. By this time I am going through personal issues, more and more stress. I was fighting to try find my son and get some contact with him. 


Fast forward to my second child being born and I finally managed to get a solicitor to go to court. To get access to my son. I didn't have the energy in me to go for having my son full time, my ex would make my life hell and he would use this to torment me through the court system. I feel like I paid a price to get away from my abuser. My son was the cost to leave. To keep my parents safe, to let me have a life where he won't tournament me about who is in my life because my son isn't living with me. You can say to yourself I wouldn't leave my kids mo matter what. Yes that was me too. Then I was abused for years and years lost my mind and tried my best to heal. I lost my best friend, my world was dark and my son was the light that kept me going. He was my best friend he was my hope, for proving that being a shitty parent wasn't biological it was/is a choice. I was a great mum. I don't feel this way about my son. I am a great mum to my second child. I am not a good mum to my son, he unfortunately paid a price he knows nothing about. I do my best to have a relationship with my son. His dad's influence on him has poisoned our relationship. I have let my son be angry at me, I don't blame him, I let him down. I try to be a mum to him but it is hard. We have a strained relationship because, I left him, but also what he has been through. He will never know the truth, about his dad. I refuse to tell him at 14 years old. Maybe when he is older I will tell him about my life, but it's not a story most adults can handle to perhaps one day I will find the words to write it down and explain why I wasn't around from when he was 8 to 12. I just hope he doesn't grow up to hate me to much. I regret leaving him every day but, I was scared about what his dad would do if I really took him again. 

It's been a long journey but I survived and for that I am great full. My story did have a happy ending, I am living it. There are many women who never get to leave the way they want or deserve. Some never leave at all. They are killed because they want a peaceful life. So please before you judge me or other women like me that have endured abuse for years, keep in mind some women never get to leave. It's not as easy as just going to the shop, it's ignored by professionals who job it is to spot abuse. 

We are often left to leave on our own to plot an escape plan years before we finally leave. We have to play the long game to hopefully leave alive. That is just the start. All because the person's toxic behaviour you can't take anymore. You aren't a person with feeling you are a possession to be manipulated, you are their's and only their's. So I got out alive but it cost me my son. There are lots of other things I did to survive against my abuser. Sadly I can't remember them, it was a triumph for me at the time but, I don't remember because it was a part of my life I want to move on from. The fuse stuck with me because women as seen as weak or stupid, but I proved that I knew about how to wire a plug and my ex didn't 

The man who was God's gift to women and thought of himself as a man, who is a weak rapists and a vile human.

I did make a report to the police about him raping me while I was sleep.

My ex is a Somnophilia most men who do this to women are. In my ex's twisted mind he is a man and has needs. I have reported him, to hopefully keep another woman safe. It very weird way, I hope my report helps a woman if he does this to her and she is brave enough to report it. She won't be alone. My ex will find out I told him the truth about reporting if he does it again. My ex has found someone who he has now married she has 5 kids of her own and my son and they have a kid together. I warned her family and said you won't believe me but here are the signs of absue. I did my best to protect her too. Now I have got to go and get my second chance at being a good mother from school. Thanks for reading helped me get this off my chest. It can float in the ethera forever. X

Six figures in IT is not the reward for luck. It is not handed out for years spent in the same job title. It is earned through consistent daily habits that compound into proof you can show. The quiet habit looks unimpressive from the outside. A timer. A notebook. A lab built in a spare bedroom. But the outcome is a career that pays you six figures while others plateau.

Coasting feels harmless at first. Tickets closed. Meetings attended. A paycheck that covers the rent. Then you realize three years have passed and nothing has changed. Salaries stayed flat while bills climbed. Colleagues who started later now interview for roles you could not qualify for. Comfort became the anchor.

This guide is how to escape the stall. Each step is concrete. Each step is aimed at building a portfolio, a cert path, and habits that point directly to $100K and beyond.

# 1. Pick a Niche and Protect It

A career in IT gives you endless choices. Networking, security, coding, cloud, data. The menu looks exciting until you realize sampling everything keeps you average in all of them. Hiring managers want specialists who solve expensive problems, not dabblers with scattered skills.

Choose one niche. IAM, Azure Security, vulnerability management, or GRC. These fields are less crowded than pentesting or general sysadmin work, yet they pay as well or better.

Once you choose, protect it. That means:

* Certifications tied to the same focus. For IAM, this might be Security+ followed by SC-300.
* Labs that showcase the same path. Build an Entra ID tenant. Configure MFA. Connect it to a sample app.
* Resume lines that echo the story. Instead of listing generic help desk tasks, highlight access provisioning, password policies, or AD security groups.

When all your proof points in one direction, recruiters understand your value immediately. That clarity separates you from the endless pile of “general IT” resumes.

# 2. Build a 25 Minute Daily Block

Ambition collapses under vague promises like “I’ll study tonight” or “I’ll work for a few hours on Saturday.” Real progress comes from a smaller, structured block.

Set a timer for 25 minutes. That is your daily study block. No multitasking. No Slack open. No phone within reach.

What fits into 25 minutes?

* Reading one domain of Security+ and answering practice questions.
* Rebuilding a lab user in Entra ID and documenting the steps.
* Writing a LinkedIn post explaining how MFA enrollment works.

A single block may not feel impressive. Stack 30 and you have 12 hours. Stack 90 and you have 37 hours. Stack 180 and you have 75 hours. The accumulation is what creates results, not the drama of a single cram session.

The block becomes a ritual. Wake up. Brew coffee. Hit the timer. You no longer debate whether to study. You simply execute.

# 3. Track Minutes Like Money

You know exactly how many dollars are in your bank account. You should know exactly how many minutes you invested in your career this week.

Keep a simple log. It can be a spreadsheet, a Notion page, or even a notebook. Write the date and the minutes completed.

Example:

* Monday: 25
* Tuesday: 50
* Wednesday: 25

At the end of the month, the numbers tell you if you are serious. Three hours logged is entertainment. Twenty hours logged is progress.

This habit removes illusions. It is easy to feel like you worked hard because you watched videos. The minute log forces honesty. Zero minutes means you did nothing. The habit is not about guilt. It is about clarity.

# 4. Replace Scrolling with a Checklist

Discipline breaks when you have to decide what to do next. That gap is when the phone wins.

Solve it with a preset checklist. Before you start the block, write the exact task. No vague “study Security+.” Be specific.

Checklist examples:

* Review SC-300 module two.
* Add conditional access policy to Entra ID lab.
* Draft one resume bullet about access management.

When the timer starts, there is no space to improvise. You already know the task. All your energy goes to doing, not deciding.

Scrolling steals hours and gives you nothing to show. A checklist gives you proof in 25 minutes.

# 5. Treat Mornings Like Revenue Hours

The first hour after waking is the most powerful leverage point in your day. No coworkers asking for help. No email threads. No late-day fatigue.

Turn that hour into revenue time. Even if you only claim 25 minutes of it, you are investing your freshest focus into the career that will pay you long term.

Practical example:

* 6:30 AM: Brew coffee.
* 6:40 AM: Review Security+ ports and protocols.
* 7:05 AM: Timer ends. Notes logged. Resume bullet drafted.

That is one block finished before your official workday even begins. By the time coworkers complain about traffic, you already banked career progress.

# 6. Measure Progress in Artifacts

Time spent is invisible. Artifacts are undeniable.

An artifact is anything you can show:

* A lab screenshot with MFA enforced.
* A LinkedIn post explaining SAML flows.
* A resume bullet about automating user provisioning.

Set a weekly artifact goal. By the end of each week you should have something tangible. If you studied for hours but shipped nothing, the week is wasted.

Artifacts are what recruiters see. A polished portfolio site with IAM labs is ten times stronger than a certificate badge alone. Time disappears. Proof remains.

# 7. Choose One Certification and Lock It In

Studying without a target creates endless loops. You watch videos, take notes, then drift away. Months pass and nothing is finished.

Pick one certification. Pay for the exam. Put the date on your calendar. The countdown forces action.

If IAM is your focus, that might mean Security+ as the entry point or SC-300 as the specialist credential. If cloud is your angle, maybe AZ-500.

With the date locked, your study plan is no longer vague. Every block points to one clear outcome. That pressure is healthy. It prevents you from drifting into random material that feels productive but does not move you toward the test.

# 8. Create Weekly Proof Deliverables

Each week should end with proof that you moved forward. Small deliverables build momentum.

Examples:

* A one-page PDF breaking down the difference between SAML and OIDC.
* A LinkedIn post describing how you configured conditional access in your lab.
* A resume update that highlights a measurable impact from your last role.

Deliverables do more than show progress. They create a record you can look back on. After twelve weeks you will have twelve concrete pieces of evidence. That portfolio is what convinces recruiters you are serious.

# 9. Add Public Accountability

Private goals are easy to abandon. Public goals carry weight.

Announce your streak. Post your study count. Share your labs. You are not chasing likes. You are building accountability.

Practical move: pick one platform and commit to sharing once a week. Post your lab results on LinkedIn. Share your Pomodoro count on Twitter. Even a screenshot of your timer app works.

The act of publishing removes wiggle room. Once you declare it, skipping feels expensive. This is the leverage that keeps you moving when motivation is gone.

# 10. Reward Consistency, Not Intensity

Cramming for six hours feels productive. It rarely lasts. The better habit is showing up for 25 minutes every day.

Reward yourself for streaks, not spikes. Thirty days of uninterrupted blocks deserves more recognition than a single weekend marathon.

Consistency builds identity. You are no longer someone who “studies when motivated.” You are someone who does the block daily. That identity is stronger than any motivational speech.

# Six Months of Compounding

At first the results are invisible. You pass a quiz. You finish a lab. You post a small update. It feels minor.

Then the artifacts stack. Your LinkedIn shows a portfolio of consistent posts. Your resume tells a story of IAM labs and certs aligned to a clear focus. Recruiters start reaching out because your profile stands out.

The compounding is what unlocks interviews. It is also what gives you confidence. You are no longer faking. You have proof. That proof becomes the edge that carries you into a six-figure role while your peers wonder why their careers stalled.

# Stop Coasting

Comfort is the enemy. Tickets solved and meetings attended do not change your life. The habit that does change it is simple. Pick one niche. Lock one cert. Execute one daily block. Ship one weekly artifact. Share one piece of progress in public.

Do this long enough and six figures is no longer a question of if. It is only a matter of when.

Starts off in american dreams chapter at qz fedra military school under different circumstances from Ellie. He or she or they will be 1 year older than Ellie, and meet Ellie and Riley there. Eventually this character finds out he/she/they are immune for different reasons from Ellie that will be explained in the story, Later on he or she or they travel will travel with Joel and Ellie. Also travels with ellie in part 2. I'm not gonna explain all of it here, we're putting it on Wattpad but if you can just cast a vote for the first choice that would help. Thank you so much.

Traits will include shy, humourous, vigilant and aggressive. Has a fear of loneliness and being controlled.

Likes: humor, freedom, weapons,travel, coffee, games, movies, music, drawing, comics, pre-outbreak history, interest in scientific research, but fear of being experimented on.

Dislikes: Fedra, loud noises, propaganda, war, control, qzs.

I am very sorry to the 8 that already voted, if you can cast your vote again here, I would be super grateful, I will share the story to those who wanna see. Special thanks to prescod for giving me the idea to add non binary to this poll.

Thank you all for participating. Next one will likely be potential romances with either one of canon or background characters or an added au character, however all canon orientations and romances will still be addressed or occur at some point in the story, so don't expect anything wild/raunchy out of the next choice, its just writing for fun and love of tlou not service lol.

I spent my teens and early twenties with undiagnosed autism, severe anxiety and an ED. I avoided any unfamiliar social environment, or any occasion with food, and essentially isolated myself to my home and school/uni/work. I was too exhausted and anxious and depressed to try and make friends or be myself.

Even in the last year of ""recovery"", I was first restricted by other people for the sake of my health, and then became too afraid to do anything outside my comfort zone. It's only this past month that I've been pushing myself to join in and let go of the rules. I've been to the pub for the first time, to the farmer's market, spontaneous coffee or cake trips, cooking with friends, just dance and real dance and language club, sharing music, watching university sports games, and countless more.

All these little things are so ordinary to other people and don't require thought, but doing them for the first time, everything feels overwhelming and intimidating. I feel like a child that knows nothing about the world, like an imposter, pretending to fit in.

I'm sad for all the years I spent too afraid to try anything out of fear of rejection or change or weight gain, but I'm so grateful that recovery has given me the chance to experience the life I missed out on. I feel like I'm finally finding myself and my passions and personality, and I'm the happiest I've been in a very long time.

If I was still focused on weight loss I'd still not have experienced any of this or made the friends and memories I have. If you're afraid to try something new or you don't know if recovery is worth it, this is your sign that it is. <3",4,1759243876.0,fuckeatingdisorders,2,0.84,False

This is a long story so please bear with me. So, back in 2022, my girlfriend informs me that while she was hanging out with my mother and sister at their house that my mother was FaceTiming a random man that I have never seen or heard of before. I didn’t want to freak out over nothing, because guy friends are a thing, so I brushed it off. A couple months pass and my now fiancé was working with my mother at the time at your typical 9-5 office job. One day, my fiancé sends me a video message of my mother and another man in her car in the parking lot of their job, they weren’t doing anything scandalous, but my mother would definitely have major issues with my father doing the same thing. So I feel like that was at least strange. The guy walked her to the front door of her job, and just left in his car. I can’t exactly remember, but a while later, my sister got engaged and had a bridal shower and my fiancé got invited to get ready with her and the other women before heading to the shower and during the time my fiancé was there, my mother was boasting about how she and her friend were at the club and were dancing on/with different guys. A couple months later, I was feeling overwhelmed by everything because while all of this happened over the course of time, I have heard countless stories of how my mother has been seen out in clubs and bars with other men that are not my stepfather. The people telling me, are very very close to me and people I fully trust for a lifetime. Just tonight at around 7:00 pm I am taking my friend home after hanging out at my house who lives in the same town as my mother. I drive by her house since it is on the way to his house, and I see a truck with two guys with the door propped open with her halfway inside the truck. I keep driving and drop my friend off and drive back by and I see them pull out of the driveway and head down the opposite way I’m driving so I turn around follow to a hotel down the road from her house. I didn’t pull, I just turned back around to go home and I see my mom pull into the gas station next door to the hotel and hop out of the car on her phone all frantic. I just drive home to keep my emotions in check. A couple of hours pass and it is now 12 am and my fiancé and I decide to go get coffee because we’re caffeine addicts. I drive by my mom’s house and see she isn’t home ( it’s on the way to the gas station). So I decide to check the hotel down the road out of curiosity and that’s what killed the cat. There she was standing in the hotel parking lot with two dudes in a club/party dress with alcohol in her hand. I slow roll right past her and we make eye contact and she looked caught off-guard and guilty. I drove out of the parking lot and waited to see if she went home. She ends up going home so I continued about my night. My stepfather and mom have been together for 12 years and I now notice that she has probably been cheating the whole time they’ve been together. With the past 12 years of knowing my father I have always felt he hasnever been one of those types of people to ever have an “open relationship”. He has always preached about “dating to marry so on so forth”. So Am I the asshole for not telling my father since I don’t have enough evidence?

I currently sell Indian coffee in the U.S. and over the years I’ve built strong contacts in the specialty coffee industry.

Lately, I’ve been thinking about bringing some incredible coffees from Latin America — origins like Colombia, El Salvador, Panama, and Guatemala — into the Indian market. These would include everything from washed and natural lots to Geisha and other unique varietals.

I know India already has some fantastic homegrown coffees, but I’m curious whether consumers here would also be excited to explore these different origins and flavor profiles.

This is still a very rough idea that I’m piecing together, so I wanted to reach out to this community:
	•	Do you think there would be demand in India for Latin American coffees?
	•	Would people be open to paying a premium for these specialty lots, or do you see it being more of a niche market?

Really looking forward to hearing your thoughts and learning from your experiences.

Thanks in advance!

1nuf8v7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/1nuf8v7/one_month_binge_free/,One month binge free,"I’ve been trying to be binge free for 3 years now. It was the worst it has been in 2021 where I was drinking 6 cups of coffee, 0.5L water, eating outside everyday, 2-3 packs of chips and bad sleep schedule. I would constantly be thinking about food and just waiting for plans where I could eat. I would eat in my bed until I couldn’t. Once I ate lasagne, threw up and then continued eating it just because I couldn’t stop. 

I gained weight, got bad acne and just in general unmotivated in life. Tried a lot of things: becoming vegan, homeopathy, meditation, went to many doctors, nothing worked. 

In the last 3 years I’ve been trying to recover from this. I’ve actually stopped going for easy fixes and tried to understand the root of why I feel this way. In general, I am not very athletic and more studious. I am a perfectionist, someone with all or nothing mindset and also someone who dwells a lot when I fail. It’s not surprising that I binge as a coping mechanism. 

I have reduced my caffeine consumption to 1 cup a day for the last 2 years. Trying to be consistent with exercise but I injured myself in the last year so still working on it. I am now in the mindset that I can regulate my emotions to not binge even if I have had a bad day. 

I haven’t binged in a month and so today to celebrate I actually ate Chinese food. It was good and really different when I ate it without that emotional attachment. 

It’s just been one month where I have been consistent in not binging (before it would be like a couple of weeks max 😅) but I’m excited to see how it builds from here! To anyone reading this, I hope it gets better for you as well! ",3,1759243779.0,BingeEatingDisorder,0,1.0,False

I did learn that intermitent fasting was a no no, as it would cause massive crashes and just overall bad days. 

It probably has to do with getting used to it, but I'm no longer feeling the effect come on as strong as I did a few months ago. I wouldnt say i have a crash in the afternoon, but i think its in part due to just not getting as much out of it.

In the morning I take my meds, (vyvanse 40 MG, Sertraline 100 MG, Claritin-D 100 mg) and about 15-20 mins later eat a couple of eggs and have black coffee. I'll usually have 1 more coffee before lunch, and after lunch either another coffee or a monster.

The beauty of Ethiopia can’t be described in enough words. All the greenery, the scenic backdrops, natural formations etc. 

The people and tour guides were beyond nice to me. I toured Addis Ababa, learned to cook Ethiopian food with a local family - making Injera and learning how to roast coffee beans. Did a food tour and bar hopped to a couple places. 

Debra Libanos (despite the bumpy road getting there) was amazing with the waterfall and the monkeys being the stars of the show.

I visited all the churches in Lalibela, attempted to walk up the Monastery in the mountains but could only make it to the village up top :)

I even went to a local place that serves drinks in Lalibela and invited some of the locals to come drink with us (on me). Kids followed me around - I bought all of them candy from the store and they followed me back to the hotel entrance. I even smoked Hookah at a bar for the first time in my life!

I went to Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE also on this trip and I loved Ethiopia the most. I def wanna come back to Addis and check out Danakil Depression and the Omo Valley as well! 

People sleep on Ethiopia cause of negative stories and imagery put on tv but it’s an amazing place with amazing people. 

The only negative I have is those damn Mosquitos in Lalibela tore me up! lol.

I came because everyone said, ""You are lucky here. Sun, water, good life.""  
The first month was nice. Fresh bread every morning. Barista knows my coffee.

Soon, problems started. Heavy rain came and water got inside my wall. I told my landlord. He just laughed and said, ""Use a towel. Old houses always have leaks.""  
No heating in winter. Everyone wears jackets indoors and pretends it is normal. I feel cold because I grew up with a heater.

I try to speak the local language in the shop. People answer fast and I do not understand. They tell me, ""Practice more,"" then start talking about politics or football.

At the government office, there is always one document missing. If I ask for help, I get an eye roll. Sometimes the office closes after lunch and nobody knows when it will open again.

Buses and trains are confusing. The website says the bus comes at 12:00. I wait and it comes at 13:15. The answer is always, ""This is life. Traffic is normal.""

When I say, ""This is difficult for me,"" someone tells me, ""Go home if you have problems.""  
Online forums are the same. Locals ask, ""Why do foreigners always complain?"" Foreigners reply and say, ""If you do not like it, leave.""

So I left. Now I live in a place where I see snow in winter. People complain less here. I do miss my old food, music, and the sea. But life is good.

After reading all the comments on this sub, I'm coming to Portugal.

I miss cheap pizza. I miss fast trains to Milan.

I was rushing to a job interview, clutching my résumé like a lifeline, when I ducked into a crowded coffee shop for a quick caffeine fix. As I waited in line, a harried woman ahead of me juggled her phone, a toddler’s hand, and a dripping umbrella that looked like it had seen better decades.
She paid, grabbed her latte, and dashed out—leaving the umbrella propped against the counter. I noticed it immediately, its polka-dot pattern screaming “forgotten.” The barista shrugged, and the line shuffled forward. But something tugged at me; maybe it was the mom-vibes or just karma points I needed that day.
I snagged the umbrella, bolted out into the downpour, and scanned the street. There she was, half a block away, huddling under an awning with her kid. “Hey! Your umbrella!” I yelled, waving it like a flag.
She turned, eyes wide, then burst into a grateful laugh. “Oh my god, you’re a lifesaver! This thing’s been with me through three moves and a divorce.” We shared a quick chat—turns out she was interviewing too, for the same company. Small world.
That moment? It didn’t land me the job (spoiler: neither of us got it), but it sparked a friendship over failed dreams and rainy days. Sometimes, a soggy gesture is all it takes to brighten the gloom.",1,1759243447.0,LifeInAMoment,0,1.0,False

In March 2025 I decided to slowly get back to gym (last gym time was maybe in 2015).

Initially did 40 min cardio and 10-15 mins of weights. I go to the gym in my apartment building In Dubai but the equipments are very limited. But its less crowded so I'm comfortable here.

I usually have 2 full meals a day totalling up to 1300-1500 kcal. I stopped having breakfast since 2018. Im a keralite and I need to have rice for lunch almost everyday to maintain my level of sanity. Apart from this I have 30-45g of chocolate everyday (200 cal). I don't want to let go of these 2 because it keeps me happy. So about 1700-1800 cal every day. Most days my protein intake is about 80 to 95g++.

I don't take any supplements YET.

I don't have tea or coffee. No biscuits or chips (occasionally sometimes 1-2 times a month). 1 cup of green tea after lunch and 1 cup of rooibos tea after dinner.

I recently started spending 30+ minutes of my workout time to weights/strength training. But I'm not able to understand the calorie burning part of it.

- Feet Elevated (low height) Pushup
4 x 10

- Inclined Bench Press (Machine)
3 x 15 Reps

- Dumbbell Skull Crusher
4 x 8 Reps

- Overhead Tricep Extensions
4 x 10 Reps

- Dumbbell Chest Press
3 x 15 Reps

- Dumbbell Tate Press
3 x 8

Today I did Triceps + Chest and this was my workout followed by 20 mins high incline slow walk for cardio (185 calories as per machine) Based on the details I've provided ... Can anyone tell me how much calories (approx) I would burn here ?

I do 3 days of gym then one day rest. Then repeat.

1nuf1vp,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1nuf1vp/cant_get_over_my_ex_1_year_on/,Can't get over my ex 1 year on,"Hi im not really looking for advice but maybe support. Me (39 f) and my ex (38 m) broke up nearly a year ago now and i've tried to move on but im finding it really hard. 

We met in February 2024, on my side we had a fantastic relationship and even though I had been married in the past (single for 6 years since) this was the first person I felt so in tune with, ever. Not only did we align on our values but we fancied the pants off eachother too. We went away on trips, long weekends and even a blended family holiday. We spoke about the future and talked about moving in with eachother.

In October 2024 He told me he'd never been so sure about a future with someone and even had been looking at houses and cars etc for us both. It confirmed how i felt, utterly deeply in love with this man. 

Maybe 2 weeks later, he told me he hadn't been feeling himself and was down. He couldn't pin point what it was he just knew he felt off. He was thinking about going to the doctors to talk about medication. I asked if there was anything I could do and he said he'd felt like this in the past but with time it always passed so I got from that I needed to be patient.

So much was going through my mind. His son was leaving school soon and they needed to figure out what he was going to do next. He had shared custody so would this affect the living situation etc? Maybe he was thinking about his job and the progression as i know there was a lot of pressure he put on himself and he always felt like him and his brother were being compared or competing. He was just starting a new course at work so extra pressure etc. 

After a couple of weeks he said he still felt the same and had doubts about his future and felt at a point he needed to think but also wanted to take each day at a time because the overthinking was not helping him. So i asked if he also had doubts about us.  He said he wasnt sure.

Obviously this hurt a lot as i had no doubts but i understood he was being honest. When i asked if he knew he still wanted a future with me, he said he couldn't give me an answer. I told him that wasnt fair. No one should be in a relationship with someone who isnt sure about them. I asked what he wasn't sure about and he confessed when we had a conversation about where we'd like to live together it didnt align. I have 2 daughters - at the time one in primary school one in secondary school. I had said I'd need to stay in my town for them and their school and friends and family plus I dont drive so limited where to live. He understood that but said he wasn't sure he'd want to be restricted to living in my town. I said it can be further, it would be local just until I pass my driving test or until my daughters finish school, its not forever. Plus we aren't ready to move in with eachother yet so we're talking about something so far in the future things can change.

I said, is this really the only thing you have doubts about us because right now it's not completely relevant because we're talking about a year at the earliest in the future and I'm willing to move where ever he wants. I promised I would learn to drive and we could move anywhere within a certain mile radius until my daughters finish school then anywhere in the world after that, as long as i was with him I'd be happy. He said he needed time to think. So I said how about we give eachother some space so we can think about our future for about a week and then we'll talk. 

The week was the slowest week of my life. I couldnt stop thinking about him and missing him. We cancelled our trip we were due to go on the following week and i lost the money which was annoying but i was more hurt we wouldnt be going together. It's now the end of November 2024 when we meet up. He's cold at first. He says he's decided he needs to be by himself. He still loves me and fancies me but he just knows he needs to be by himself and be selfish and prioritise what he wants.

I say ok. My heart broke. We both cry. We both hug. I blurt out in my emotional wreck thank fk I wasn't pregnant. It's important to note the last 2 months or so I had been bleeding a lot with pain and was having many tests done to figure out what was going on, the doctor said one cause could be pregnancy but luckily this was negative but this information was given during the time we were giving eachother space. I dont know why I said it. But he said back if it was the case we'd be having a very different discussion.

Anyway, we hug again, cry some more, and not sure why but he tried to kiss me then said sorry immediately but he didnt seem sorry. I dont know what he was thinking. Maybe he was trying to make me smile. He also tapped my bum. Again i think he was trying to be funny. It just confused me to be honest. The next few weeks are a blur. I've had heartbreak before but I'd never felt this broken. I thought it might help to get a reason why this all happened and even came up with a few reasons myself blaming myself for him not wanting to be with me.

I messaged him and he said he missed me and still loved me and maybe we could meet to talk. But then changed his mind. This happened a couple of times. I was not in a good headspace at all. I was acting out of character and very emotional.

I eventually got angry and called him a few names and told him to delete my number, block me, just never contact me again. Ofcourse after a week or month, I'm not really sure, I still messaged him hoping he came to the conclusion he'd made a mistake and was having a mid life crisis or something. But this didnt happen. He was happier without me.

He still couldn't tell me why he'd changed his mind or why the relationship broke down. I get feelings change but he never said his feelings did so it just didnt make any sense to me. I guess they did, he just didnt want to hurt me so couldnt tell me that. I think our last message to eachother was around 4 or 5 months later and he did eventually say that he thinks we wouldnt have worked out long term. Still no reasons why,  but thats something at least, some closure. I haven't spoken to him since. 

Anyway. It's now September (October tomorrow) 2025. We broke up in November 2024. My friends have seen him on dating apps and my friends ex husband lives near him so i know he's had women back to his place. I also found out that he joined dating apps before we split up, probably when we were taking some space but definitely before we split up. That hurt a lot.

I've had a couple dates but none of them I have fancied or felt anything romantic. I haven't slept with anyone since my ex. The thought of finding someone new seems so out of reach because i genuinely have no interest in men at the moment. There was one guy who was happy to stay friends and see where things went, he made it clear he fancied me but he never asked to take me out on a date, we'd meet out for coffee and weeks would go by without hearing from him so I made it clear it wasn't for me and said goodbye before anything could even turn romantic. And a couple guys have made it clear theyre interested but ive said im not ready to date. I just dont fancy anyone at the moment.

I've gone on holiday, im driving, I've had councilling, I've tried so hard to just be happy for myself and for my daughters. But I just don't feel happy. The sadness freezes me. I dont want to face friends, family, outside. Everything I do is for other people and I get no enjoyment from anything. I still make myself do things but like I said its for the benefit of others and I just feel like a character and like I'm not really living it.

The holiday was an activity holiday and I had a great time with my sister but the whole time had a shadow over me. It wasn't real joy. It was more 'at least ive achieved something' and pushed myself to do amazing things. I am glad i done it. And im sure I'll look back at it in happiness one day but right now everything feels fake. 

I cry daily. I'm still doing life. Most days I dont want to exist. My self worth is at the lowest it's been. Councilling has finished. When I do talk to ppl it doesnt make me feel better, just worse. 

This whole year is a blur to be honest. I work, i spend quality time with my kids, i go for walks, i exercise, im doing things for myself and nothing is working or helping.

Everyone says time is the best healer and be kind to myself. Time isnt healing me. Maybe i need even more time but in the mean time I'm finding it hard to carry on.

I have no interest in meeting someone new. I used to be so happy and content being by myself but being with him was just so much better. I just want to forget about it and go back to how i was. I'm not on dating apps. Im trying hard to work on myself. I dont know what else i can do. I feel broken.

So, back in 2022, my girlfriend informs me that while she was hanging out with my mother and sister at their house that my mother was FaceTiming a random man that I have never seen or heard of before. I didn’t want to freak out over nothing, because guy friends are a thing, so I brushed it off. 
A couple months pass and my now fiancé was working with my mother at the time at your typical 9-5 office job. One day, my fiancé sends me a video message of my mother and another man in her car in the parking lot of their job, they weren’t doing anything scandalous, but my mother would definitely have major issues with my father doing the same thing. So I feel like that was at least strange. The guy walked her to the front door of her job, and just left in his car. 
I can’t exactly remember, but a while later, my sister got engaged and had a bridal shower and my fiancé got invited to get ready with her and the other women before heading to the shower and during the time my fiancé was there, my mother was boasting about how she and her friend were at the club and were dancing on/with different guys.
A couple months later, I was feeling overwhelmed by everything because while all of this happened over the course of time, I have heard countless stories of how my mother has been seen out in clubs and bars with other men that are not my stepfather. The people telling me, are very very close to me and people I fully trust for a lifetime. 
Just tonight at around 7:00 pm I am taking my friend home after hanging out at my house who lives in the same town as my mother. I drive by her house since it is on the way to his house, and I see a truck with two guys with the door propped open with her halfway inside the truck. I keep driving and drop my friend off and drive back by and I see them pull out of the driveway and head down the opposite way I’m driving so I turn around follow to a hotel down the road from her house. I didn’t pull, I just turned back around to go home and I see my mom pull into the gas station next door to the hotel and hop out of the car on her phone all frantic. 
I just drive home to keep my emotions in check. A couple of hours pass and it is now 12 am and my fiancé and I decide to go get coffee because we’re caffeine addicts. I drive by my mom’s house and see she isn’t home ( it’s on the way to the gas station). So I decide to check the hotel down the road out of curiosity and that’s what killed the cat. There she was standing in the hotel parking lot with two dudes in a club/party dress with alcohol in her hand. I slow roll right past her and we make eye contact and she looked caught off-guard and guilty. I drove out of the parking lot and waited to see if she went home. She ends up going home so I continued about my night. 
My stepfather and mom have been together for 12 years and I now notice that she has probably been cheating the whole time they’ve been together. With the past 12 years of knowing my father I have always felt he hasnever been one of those types of people to ever have an “open relationship”. He has always preached about “dating to marry so on so forth”.
So Am I the asshole for not telling my father since I don’t have enough evidence? I just wanna know if this is something we should sit down and talk as a family or something I should keep confronting my nothing about till she maybe quits doing it?

Most of the newly independent countries faced internal conflict between Portuguese settlers and Brazilians, with the latter winning out by 1840.

In 1835, the government of Grão-Pará was overthrown in a revolt led by Eduardo Angelim, who led the country until his overthrow in 1852, and implemented reforms that improved living standards for the poor non-white majority. However, these changes displeased the Grão-Pará oligarchy, who overthrew Angelim in a coup and exiled him to Gran Colombia. 

Piauí was rapidly annexed by the Confederation of the Equator, which emerged as a liberal state, pursuing the gradual abolition of slavery (abolished in 1858). There was a conflict between the Confederation and Bahia over Sergipe that resulted in a Bahian victory. A successful slave revolt went on in Maranhão, but it's new government faced infighting and was soon toppled as well. 

By the 1850s, São Paulo had emerged as the richest country in the Lusophone Americas, thanks to coffee exports, despite a British naval blockade of the port of Santos that forced the Paulistas to abolish the slave trade. This was one of several reforms pursued by Tobias de Aguiar, the country's president from 1845 to 1857. 

Another contemporary leader was Teófilo Otoni, who led Minas Gerais from 1842 to 1847 and is remembered as one of its greatest leaders. Save for Grão-Pará, all countries in the region had restrictive voting laws. ",3,1759242959.0,GustavosAltUniverses,0,1.0,False

Currently rocking a Timemore 078 as my daily driver at home, and I'm really happy with it. I've decided I'd like to add another tool to my arsenal, as well as something I can travel with. Brew method wise, I do V60, Chemex, Kalita Wave, and Aeropress. No plans to venture into espresso territory anytime soon as I don't have the space for it. My go-to beans are typically light to quality medium roasts from places like Passenger, Black and White, Rogue Wave, Prodigal, and Heart.

I've been doing some research and looking at grinders such as the C40, ZP6, K-Ultra, and C5 Pro, and I think I've narrowed it down to the ZP6 and K-Ultra. I keep reading that the ZP6 produces very tea-like, ultra-high clarity cups. While I appreciate clarity, I'm generally someone who likes some body in my coffee. However, since the 078 already produces nice body, I'm wondering if the ZP6 would actually be a better complement by offering a different profile when I want it. I've also read that the K-Ultra can do solid clarity and nice body, making it a better all-rounder.

I finished the series for the first time a couple of months ago.

I really love Halloween and thought it might be an idea to dress up as Members Only guy from “Made in America.”  My dad told me nobody will understand the costume but I still think it would be fun.

My build and hair color are about the same and I’m trying to get the outfit right.

I’ve paused on a number of shots in which he’s appeared and so far here’s the best of what I can determine: dark grey, unzipped Members Only jacket, light-ish grey polo with small diamond pattern tucked into dark grey pants with a black belt, gold chain bracelet on the right hand, and gold watch on the left hand.  The only shot where you might be able to see his socks or shoes is when he first walks in and I can’t get a clear view with enough lighting to see them.

I’m an NJ native and don’t live too far from Holsten’s, so I was also thinking maybe I could go grab a coffee there, splatter the receipt with a little blood, and put it in my breast pocket.

This probably all sounds a little over-the-top for a Halloween costume but it’s fun for me and I’m having a good time with it lol.

I am trying to fix it but feel very frustrated with how those efforts are turning out, and I could really use advice from the high libido folks on here. I am the LLF, he is the HLM. We are both in our late 30s and have been married over 10 years. We have a young child.

So after having a kid and unexpectedly losing several close family members (including a sibling and parent), I pretty much lost my sex drive. And it hasn’t come back in four years. My husband was very patient, which I appreciated, but naturally he wanted to have sex again at some point. I didn’t and admit I put it off until we were having sex - or often not even sex but mutual hand jobs - once a month.

Well he finally had a talk with me about how difficult this was for him and we agreed to try once a week. One week into that arrangement, he asked me if “this was all the sex we would ever have.” To be honest that killed whatever returning sex drive I had. I felt like we hadn’t even tried and it wasn’t good enough. So anyway we slid back to once a month or so.

Now, a year or so later, he’s had another talk with me and I am trying to truly understand how he feels. I know he says it makes him feel connected, and that he’s so attracted to me, and I appreciate that! But when I tried to suggest once a week on a schedule, he didn’t want to schedule it because that feels weird to him. And then he ultimately agreed to try it but asked me every other evening that week too. And then again after one week he has declared it’s not enough and is asking for my permission to “use porn” to “decrease his desire for me.” I don’t care if he watches porn! But that phrasing is sus to me.

We finally settled on a twice a week schedule, with set days so I can make sure I have energy. But if he desires me so much, why doesn’t he ever take the kid and let me sleep in so I am rested? Or make me coffee in the morning? (Those are just examples but I pick them became they literally never happen.) Or show desire in any other way besides asking for sex? Is his desire strictly sexual and not at all romantic? And why does he move the goalposts the minute we establish them?

I’m just venting now so I’ll stop. I guess it must be the years of resentment he feels about sex all coming to a head? I want to know so I can fix this. I want to want to have sex. I want to meet his needs, but I just don’t know how. High libido partners, what would make you feel satisfied, besides daily sex?",5,1759242726.0,DeadBedrooms,17,0.62,False

Hence my posting here. 

Last weekend, my husband and I went for a walk, and on our way back, just before crossing a narrow side street, I noticed a car coming up from behind, so I pulled my husband out of the way. Just when we were on the other side of the street and definitely out of harm‘s way, the driver honked her horn. I started so badly I almost tripped, and then it turns out it was someone I knew, let’s call her Ina.
[Little context here: Ina is about 20 years older than me, we know each other from work. Her concept of boundaries and privacy differs greatly from mine… my husband and I are childfree, though not by choice, and on one very memorable occasion, Ina quizzed me relentlessly on why we didn’t have children, why we didn’t adopt, why we had tried this or that. I was so overwhelmed I couldn’t even step up for me and kept fawning so badly I hated myself for it. It ruined that friendship for me and I have avoided her ever since.]
So, with all that in mind, I went rather wild on her, because I was SO mad at her for scaring me. Even gave her the finger and called her a mean word, though tried to subdue that a little by forcing a laugh. 

Well, yesterday, she called, and to be honest, if I had realised it was her, I wouldn’t even have answered the phone. She started the conversation along the lines „Well, what was that about last Saturday?“, and when I told her she had scared me, she said she had just wanted to say hi. Well, she could have done that after rolling down a window. (By the way, where I live, it’s illegal to honk your horn for anything other than immediate danger. I hate it so much when people do it to greet someone.) It went back and forth a bit, then she even stated „But there must be something else!“, to which I replied that no, I just hate being honked at and now wanted to get back to work. I shut down her question about having coffee with the excuse of being busy and ended the call. 

She didn’t apologise (at least not sincerely) for the whole conversation, which added to my bad temper towards her; afterwards however, I got feeling that she wanted me to apologise to her. I get where that would be coming from, but after I said multiple times how much she had scared me, I didn’t think it would be my turn to apologise first. And that’s coming from someone whose middle name might very well be „Sorry“. 

My husband just smiled when I told him of all those thoughts and feelings, and comforted me. Then again, he knows me very well and agrees that my neurospicey brain handles things differently than that of, say, Ina. Should I have apologised when she called? It could have been handled better and maybe more mature, but I just felt so forced. ",1,1759242407.0,AutisticWithADHD,13,0.54,False

a day that was supposed to be filled with love and warmth. It started with a small joy, because the first person who thought of me was my love; he sent me a gift and wished me well. Even though he’s far away and busy with his exam, my heart was happy that he remembered me. But as the hours passed, I felt an emptiness grow… my family didn’t call, the voices of congratulations I had hoped for never came, and even the one I love deeply couldn’t be truly present with me today.
I admit it… loneliness wounded me today. I longed for a longer word, a longer call, a hug to hold me, but I didn’t get them. Still, I chose not to let myself break I traveled to another city and booked a spa for myself, as if telling my soul: you deserve care even when everyone else is absent.
I had coffee, treated myself to small things, and read more than thirty pages of Blindness. As if I was searching for a different kind of warmth, proving to myself that I can create small details to ease the weight of absence.
Maybe the pain is deep, but this pain reminds me that I’m human with a heart that loves and needs. It also teaches me not to wait for my happiness only from others, because I’m capable of giving it to myself.
I am  a sensitive person who loves deeply, longs deeply, and feels deeply. And today, despite my loneliness, I still deserve all the joy, and I still deserve to be loved. Maybe I didn’t get the celebration I imagined, but I have myself trying to embrace me in the silence.

1nuelch,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/1nuelch/i_dont_know_how_much_to_invest_in_our_first_home/,I don’t know how much to invest in our first home.,"We bought a house in July of this year. We’ve learned it needs more work than we originally thought. Nothing is super urgent (except we are getting gutters installed where they are missing). We don’t intend on this being our “forever home” but a place to start our family and own something. Our longer term plan after this likely involves purchasing my in-laws home when they are ready to move -  Our initial intentions were to likely be here for the next 7-10 years.

That being said, we’re really struggling with identifying how much money to put into this house. We know 1) plans and circumstances/financials can change and there’s the chance that we are here longer than we expected or planned to be. 2)  7-10 years is still a long time to ignore some of these things. 3) When it comes time to sell we want our house to be well taken care of and appeal to buyers. 

So we just feel a bit stuck on what to do/how much we should invest in a house we don’t plan on being in forever. Another thing that adds to this is that my husband’s parents built and lived in their house since my husband was 2. My parents also purchased their current house when I was young (after about 7 years in their first house) and have been there for 20+ years. So most of the work/upgrades we’ve seen our families do have been because they’ve been (and intended to be) in their homes for several decades. 

Here’s a few things: 
1) Attached garage slab is in really rough shape (large displaced cracks/spalling/pitting). Thinking we may be able to polyjack, but the floor not be in good enough shape for that. It’s a 3 stall garage so jacking up all the floor/repour will be very spendy. It’s also the garage…so does this matter too much? When we bought we weren’t aware of how bad the floor condition was due to sellers items filled in the garage. 

2) Windows aren’t in terrible shape, but they’re not awesome either. Our upstairs has 2 large picture windows and most of the bedrooms. 8 windows total upstairs (2 picture, 2 narrows casement windows, 1 small sliding window, 3 more standard sliding window) and 4 more standard/sliding windows downstairs. Maybe makes more sense to 

3) vinyl siding is in a bit worse shape than our inspection indicated. Still functional but there’s some warping from heat in a spot/trim around garage is pretty damaged/some general faults throughout/sloppy paint job from deck got all over siding. 

4) HVAC - this is very old, and we’re planning on probably having to replace this during our time in this house. 

5) concrete work. The driveway (asphalt)/walkway up to the house (concrete) isn’t in terrible shape, but the asphalt is uneven/larger cracks in some areas and there’s a few bigger cracks in the walkway. Our back patio also has some larger cracks. 

6) Our backyard is a selling point for our house (honestly one of the main things we fell in love with/everyone comments on). Its biggest faults are the deck is super tiny with no stairs down to the patio below. We’ve talked about how extending the deck and building stairs would elevate the backyard significantly. We also are on the fence about adding a fence (talked about both of these upgrades before purchasing). 

7) General finishing inside. I really want to add some stone around our fireplace (it’s just blank drywall right now)/add some paint/maybe build a built in our breakfast nook. (Our kitchen is on the smaller side so I’d love to have area for a little extra counter space for coffee machine/toaster/extra storage)

We feel super fortunate to have a place and be in a financial spot to be able to do some of these things over the years & know other more urgent things will likely pop up as well…

I’m just looking for some insight on what would be worth doing/investing in. What tips do you all have to determine what projects you do in houses. Admittedly feeling overwhelmed and kind of stressed, but I think this (and some buyer remorse) is natural after buying a first house based on all that I’ve read. 

Any advice and encouragement would be so appreciated. Thanks!

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

The home has a radon mitigation system running, but there is monitor so i purchased a AEGtest Hound-1011. I have been monitoring levels in the basement over the last couple of weeks and they are averaging in the 1.5 to 1.7 range pCi/L. 

Yesterday afternoon I reset the meter and when we went to bed last night it was averaging about 2.5 pCi/L. This morning we were drinking our coffee and watching the news when our radon meter went crazy with a loud beeping - its was reading 201 pCi/L !!! 

We opened all the doors and windows and reset the meter again. Unfortunately it only gives a 6 hour average so we have another 4 hours before we can see the new reading. This seems to have come out of left field.

I'm not sure if this is an anomaly, a false meter reading or an accurate read. I think I need a more timely and accurate meter. In addition, I have also been talking with a Radon mitigation company here in town and am going to have them come out and check out our system.

1nuegqd,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1nuegqd/kyushu_travel_guide_why_your_next_trip_to_japan/,Kyushu travel guide – why your next trip to Japan should be to its 3rd biggest island,"Maybe you’re like me, and after your first visit to Japan, you’re looking to go again, but to a different area. And perhaps a bit off the beaten path this time. Kyushu definitely fits the description. The problem is there’s less information on it since not so many people visit. I’ve spent a lot of time putting my trip together, and with this post I would like to cover everything you need to know about going to Kyushu.

I will cover why you should visit, when, how to get around Kyushu, how many days you need and what are the main places you should consider for your trip. This will also include some places I haven’t been to, but which might be interesting for you. If you want the same content but with google map links for each place and pictures, you can find it [here](https://nevergotlost.wordpress.com/2025/09/24/kyushu-travel-guide-why-your-next-japan-trip-should-be-to-its-3rd-biggest-island/).

**Why visit Kyushu**

There are many reasons, and while some may depend on your personal preferences, I can confidently say that it’s got everything – amazing nature, great food, interesting cities, and much less international tourists than in the more famous places like Kyoto and Tokyo. Going to Kyushu gives you a chance to experience a slightly different Japan, especially when you go to the countryside.

**How many days do you need and where to go in Kyushu**

In my opinion, you need at least a week, ideally two. If you, for example, will just go for a day or two in Fukuoka and then continue to Hiroshima, it’s better to just skip Kyushu altogether. The exception to this is Yakushima, which is so unique that it’s worth it even when you just fly from Osaka and back, spending 2-3 days here.

This island is very big and it’s hard picking just few main places, but I will do my best covering them from North to South. Keep in mind these are just the base points with many interesting places between them, which I will cover later. I marked some as skippable – that doesn’t mean they’re bad, but if your time is limited, in my opinion you can skip these without too many regrets.

* Fukuoka – the main city here and easiest to get to, so many Kyushu trips will start here. Fukuoka is a big city that feels like a smaller version of Osaka. Not many sites to see here, but a pleasant place to spend 1 or 2 days and do a few side trips. Skippable.
* Nagasaki – a nice city surrounded by hills with interesting cuisine, history, and beautiful views. Definitely worth spending at least 2 days here.
* Beppu – famous for its hot springs, not only for bathing but also sightseeing as they have various colors and styles. It’s a bit run-down resort town, but still worth it for a day. Yufuin, a cute village nearby, is also nice. Skippable.
* Kurokawa Onsen – one of the top onsen destinations in Japan. This is where you go to a ryokan, relax, take a bath, have an amazing meal for dinner and then repeat in the morning. Destination for staying overnight.
* Mount Aso – finally we’re going into the nature. This is a massive volcano where you get to see not only amazing views, but also experience the power which hides in the earth. Many waterfalls and hiking places are in the area. One day is enough but you can spend more in the larger area.
* Takachiho – one of the more touristy places in Kyushu, famous for a small but beautiful gorge. Half a day is enough. Skippable.
* Kirishima Kinkowan National Park – similar to Mount Aso, there are few volcanoes here and even more hiking options. But more importantly, they’ve got a life size *Totoro* statue! Many onsens are available too. Consider spending a day here.
* Kagoshima – a relaxed seaside city right next to an amazing volcano. Good for 1 or 2 days.
* Yakushima – this is the true gem of Kyushu in my opinion. Beautiful mountains covered by rainforests that inspired *Princess Mononoke*. You can do lots of hiking here and enjoy some breathtaking views. Also, there are wild monkeys! You really need at least 2 days here, 3 is ideal.

  
**Getting around Kyushu**  
Now that we know where to go, the question is [how to connect the dots on the map](https://nevergotlost.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kyushu-travel-map.jpg?w=1418).

Fukuoka – Nagasaki – Beppu: these cities are well connected by train. Conveniently, there is the Nothern Kyushu JR pass which covers all three. Kagoshima is approachable too, but then you would need the *All Kyushu* pass.  
  
The rest is best visited by car in my opinion (public transport also works but will take much more time and effort). You can go on an awesome road trip from Beppu all the way to Kagoshima, having total freedom to go wherever you feel like, enjoying great views, nature, hiking, the seaside and much more. Driving in Japan can sound intriguing, but it’s really safe. Even if you never tried driving on the left side of the road, you quickly get used to it. Some basic info is [here](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2024.html). Also consider returning your car at a different location if that suits your trip. You pay a bit more but it’s not so bad if you consider how much time and money would returning to the same location take. For example, for me it cost 32000 ¥ for 4 days rental plus 26000 ¥ fee for getting the car in Beppu and returning it in Kagoshima with *Toyota Rent a Car.* Tolls cost around 2000 ¥ and fuel 5000 ¥.  
  
Yakushima is a small island separated from the rest, so getting here is trickier. Ideally you take the ferry from Kagoshima or fly from the airport nearby. There are also direct flights from Osaka and Fukuoka. Once you arrive, I again recommend renting a car (16000 ¥ with *Times Car rental* for 2 days plus 2000 ¥ fuel). But using buses is possible too.

**When to go to Kyushu**  
Anytime is good, but as this is the southern part of Japan, it’s a bit warmer – therefore avoid summer if you can. Also consider it’s a big temperature difference within Kyushu, e.g. between Fukuoka and Kagoshima since the latter much more south. The mountains will be colder too. Yakushima has a rainy season from June to mid-July, and then it continues into typhoon season until end of August, so try to avoid that.  
  
For example, we went in late November and in Fukuoka it was pretty warm, with most trees still green and we wore light jackets during the day. In the mountains it was much colder, many trees were colorful or already without leaves. A winter jacket was needed. It was even snowing near Kurokawa Onsen. Mount Aso was covered in ice, so they closed access to the crater. We continued south, and suddenly in Kagoshima by the seaside it almost felt like summer with us wearing just sweaters.

  
**Places to see**  
Below I list places to see at every major location, and also places you can visit when you’re moving between them. It’s not exhaustive by any means, but this list is already very long as it is and I tried to cover the more interesting ones. The list is definitely biased in my interests – I prefer natural spots, lowkey restaurants, the seaside, hiking, temples and shrine. I am not so big on shopping and museums.

**Fukuoka in detail**

Fukuoka is a pleasant seaside town and feels to me like a smaller version of Osaka. Stay on the lookout for events happening here during your visit to Kyushu, like the Sumo tournament in November or festivals such as Gion Yamakasa.

* Atago Shrine - the view from there over Fukuoka is apparently quite nice. Haven’t been.
* Momiji Hachimangu - the shrine isn't anything special, but we came here for the beautiful goshuincho with autumn leaves, and also the goshuin itself which shows AR characters from Japanese mythology when you scan it with an app. So cool!
* Momochihama Beach - very nice sandy beach, worth visiting if you enjoy the seaside. I recommend renting a bike (e.g via the Luup app) and ride around. 
* Nokonoshima Island - small island accessible by a short ferry, full of flowers - some were blossoming even in late November. I’d recommend checking recent reviews on google maps to see whether it’s currently worth it going there. Haven’t been.
* Uminonakamichi Seaside Park – similar to the above island, this is a nice area when the flowers are blooming. You can rent a bike to get around. Haven’t been. 
* Ohori Park - nice park with a big lake in the middle of it, definitely nicer to visit when flowers are blooming. If you’re there, also check out the Ohori Park Japanese Garden
* Tenjin - main shopping district in Fukuoka, huge options for food as well.
* Sumiyoshi Jinja - pleasant shrine where you feel in the nature despite being in the middle of the city. *As this shrine is dedicated to Navigation, I prayed to never get lost again. Then immediately after exiting the shrine I took a wrong turn :D*
* Kushida Shrine – beautiful shrine with a huge Yamakasa float on display. Seeing these going through the city during the festival must be amazing. The goshuin here is also nice.
* Tochoji Temple - has a nice looking pagoda, but the true reason to come is to see the huge Buddha statue (entrance is a bit hidden, you need to walk upstairs). It's really impressive and you can even walk through a tunnel inside of it, which is interesting.
* Hakata station - this building combines so many stores and restaurants, you could spend hours here. Coin lockers on the upper floors tend to be emptier if you need to store luggage. I definitely recommend checking the rooftop platform, the view over Fukuoka is nice and for free.
* Dazaifu Tenmangu - classic temple with a big shopping street leading to it. The temple is beautiful, and I recommend walking a bit up through the Tori gates to the Tenkai Inari Shrine. This walk can be extended to the Kamado Shrine or even turned into a half day hike to Mount Hōman which is 829m tall.  There is also an apparently very nice Kyushu National Museum. Haven’t been to it. *I asked one Fukuoka local we chatted with, what should we check out in Dazaifu. He immediately said „you have to go to the Starbucks!”. The Starbucks definitely has nice architecture, but I found it funny how locals sometimes recommend things that aren’t really interesting to tourists from abroad.*  
* teamLab Forest Fukuoka – doesn’t seem to offer anything special if you’ve been to the installations in Tokyo. You can hunt projected animals using an app on your phone. Haven’t been.
* Sakurai Futamigaura's Couple Stones – if you want to see a tori gate in the sea, this is your chance. However, by public transport it will take a while. Haven’t been.
* Shiraito Waterfall – nice waterfall and nearby there is a great café in the forest. Getting there will take a while by public transport. Haven’t been. 
* Stayed at AO太宰府 – it was cheaper then staying in Fukuoka itself, simple but nice accommodation
* **Food**: 
* Nakasu Yatai Yokocho (Food Stalls Street) – Fukuoka is famous for these Yatai food stalls, which seems to impact the price and quality of the food here. I didn’t try anything as the reviews speak for itself. Passing through the area, it didn’t look that interesting.  
* Kokinchan – Yatai in the Tenjin area seemed more authentic, and we enjoyed it a lot. Locals here were very nice and we had an enjoyable chat with them.
* うどん 吉（きち） - we randomly visited this udon restaurant and really enjoyed the food as well as the lowkey atmosphere. 
* Ichiran Souhonten - Main Restaurant & Office - this is the flagship store of Ichiran, it looks nice but isn't anything special. Since it's a big one the queue moves rather quickly.
* Koroshi Curry – this one is closer to the Dazaifu area. It’s a very atmospheric curry restaurant with a retro feel. First you order by filling out the paper form and then you can admire the indigenous decoration. Definitely an experience, and the food is good as well. 

  
**Between Fukuoka and Nagasaki in detail**

* Takeo-Onsen - you will most likely change trains here if you travel between Fukuoka and Nagasaki. The Takeo city Library seems beautiful, but I didn’t have enough time unfortunately. I just did a quick walk to the top of the hill at Maruyama Park from which I had a lovely view. There is also a big garden Mifuneyama Rakuen which is famous for Azaela blossom in spring and colorful leaves in Autumn. There’s a Teamlabs here too.
* Yūtoku Inari Shrine - Massive shrine which looks amazing, but you will spend quite some time getting to it with public transport. Unfortunately, I couldn't fit it in the itinerary. 
* Arita – if you are a fan of pottery, you may want to visit this town. There are many shops and also The Kyushu Ceramic Museum. The Sueyama Shinto Shrine is interesting for its porcelain Tori gate. Nearby, there is a cute Okawachiyama Village specialized in ceramics. Haven’t been.
* Huis Ten Bosch – I can’t imagine anyone from abroad and especially from Europe would want to see Japans’ version of a Dutch town as a theme park. But maybe it is your cup of vla? 

**Nagasaki in detail**

One of my favorite cities in Kyushu, it feels so different from the rest. While it’s by the sea, there are tall hills everywhere around it, from which you can get great views of the whole bay. The history of this city is most known for the atomic bomb disaster, but it also went through an interesting period of Portuguese and Dutch trade during the 16th through 19th centuries which influenced the local cuisine as well as architecture.

* Mt. Inasayama Overlook – top attraction of Nagasaki in my opinion. The view from here after dark is great. I’ve seen a lot of amazing views in Japan, but this one was the best, comparable only with the view from Mount Maya. You can get here easily with the ropeway.
* Peace park – there are three locations here. The Peace park itself has many statues and a lot of school trips around, but I have to admit the most interesting thing to me were the long escalators leading to it :) . The Hypocenter park is where the severity of what happened hits you. Here is the center of the explosion, and if you walk downstairs to the river, you see the layer of ground hit by the bomb, along with the picture of the devastation. And finally, the Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum – for a symbolic price you experience a museum many people claim is better than the one in Hiroshima. *There were soo many schooltrips here. It’s not a pleasant place to visit, but I am glad the kids are getting educated on such an important topic – we really can’t let something like this happen again.* 
* Sanno Shrine was completely destroyed by the atomic bomb except for half of a tori gate which you can still see today. There are also two huge camphor trees that survived the blast and now symbolize the coming back to life of the whole city. 
* Fukusaiji – really wanted to see this temple shaped like a turtle, but didn’t have time
* Sofuku-ji and Kofukuji are temples interesting for their unique look, resembling Chinese style. What is truly impressive though is the huge graveyard on the slope above them. I recommend walking through it (warning, it's around 120m elevation), getting through the mystical forest in the upper half and finally reaching the Kazagashira Park. Here you will get an amazing view over the whole city.
* Megane Bridge - nearby the above mentioned temples, it's nothing special but the riverside is nice
* Dejima – Dutch trading quarter known for its miniature model, didn’t seem too impressive based on what I have seen from the outside. 
* Nagasaki Shinchi Chinatown - cute but very tiny district, it's basically two short streets with Chinese restaurants and few shops. There are much better Chinatowns like the one in Kobe. Maybe it’s different during the lantern festival.  *We walked through it, looked at each other and said: ""Wait, that was it""? I suggested it might look cooler in the night, so we checked it again then. Sadly, it didn't. At least the Chinese music playing from the speakers gave some semblance of a vibe*
* Gunkanjima Digital Museum – I normally don’t like museums, but this one is amazing. A lot of interactive exhibits, the AR experience was super cool. You learn a lot about how life was on the island, and how crazy big were the mines under it.  *Part of the museum celebrates inclusion of Gunkajima to UNESCO. South Korea was initially against it, but Japan promised it will publicly display how Korean prisoners were forced to work in the mine. Well, after Gunkajima made it to UNESCO, Japan broke its promise which really sucks. You won’t see any mention of Korean prisoners in this museum either. Not everything is sunshine and rainbows in Japan, this country has its problems too.* 
* Gunkanjima (Hashima Island) – if the weather is okay, you can also go to the island itself, with a tour. The areas you can walk at are very limited though, so I opted not to go.
* Ikeshima Coal Mine – you can explore much more freely on this island, but it’s quite far from Nagasaki. Haven’t been.
* Mount Unzen and specifically the Unzen Nita Pass have many great hiking options, particularly beautiful in spring when the flowers bloom, or autumn with the colorful leaves. Unzen Jigoku is right below with hot springs to see or eggs to steam and eat. This is far from Nagasaki and maybe makes sense to visit if you then continue on the ferry to Kumamoto. Haven’t been.
* Stayed at Hotel Belleview Nagasaki Dejima - nice hotel close to everything, and you don't hear too much noise from the outside
* **Food**: 
* Bunjiro Asahimachi – the Tonkatsu here was amazing. Huge portions, make sure you come here hungry.
* And Barissier - cute hidden coffee upstairs with amazing matcha tiramisu
* 海鮮·居酒屋 たぬきの里 – super good set meals, especially the miso soup is tasty
* 濃厚豚骨 かどや - delicious ramen and champon  

**Beppu in detail**

I’ve seen pictures of Beppu with steam coming out everywhere – seemed overexaggerated. But it is very real, seeing so many pipes and steam was cool. After Fukuoka and Nagasaki which were pretty chill, there was much more tourists here, especially Chinese and Korean. The local businesses around Beppu Hells seemed to cater a lot to that which gives it kind of a tacky vibe. For that reason, I spent less time on research. If you want to, you can definitely find more stuff to do here. Seems like staying at a ryokan or at least bathing in some onsens might be nice (there are not only regular ones but also sand baths, steam baths or mud baths)

* Beppu hells – These aren’t hot springs for bathing, but rather for viewing – each has different colors making some quite photogenic. Many hells have footbaths which are nice for sitting down and relaxing your feet in hot water. Whether you should visit all hells is up to you. Personally, I think you should be picky and go only to those that sound interesting to you. Some seemed very kitsch (like Oniyama Jigoku with the crocodiles) but I really liked Umi Jigoku. 
* Beppu Park – very nice park including a bamboo grove
* Global Tower – cool looking tower offering nice views over the city 
* **Food**:
* Jigokumushikobo Kannawa  - this seemed like the culmination of Beppu’s touristy vibe. You wait in a long queue to cook food in steam, only to end up eating a mediocre dish. I didn’t try it myself, but seeing the saddened looks of tourists eating tasteless food were enough to make a judgement. What is worthy of your attention though is the free foot bath - both water and steam nearby.
* Shin Hakata  - great sushi as well as dangojiru (which is basically a miso soup with dumpling noodles and vegetables), I’m so glad I ate here and not at the steamed food place. 
* Robata Jin – didn’t have time to go to this one but leaving it here as it was recommended by a local. This izakaya has delicious seafood and ideally you should book ahead of time.

**Yufuin in detail**

This cute village is great for staying overnight at a ryokan. During the day, people basically walk through the shopping street from the train station to the Kinrin Lake and that’s about it. Below are some interesting places around, but not are a must – this village can be definitely skipped.

* Yufuin Floral Village is a popular destination here, and while I must admit their small Ghibli shops are cute, the animals seem to live in pretty bad conditions (which is often a problem in Japan). Also, it’s very crowded. Wouldn’t recommend this one.
* 蜂の巣ログハウジング（株) - nice but expensive woodcraft shop
* 由布院いちご園 YUFUIN strawberry farm – thanks to hot spring water, they have strawberries here in many varieties which you can pick and eat yourself. Need to reserve in advance. Haven’t been
* Mount Yufu -  if you’re into hiking, check it out, views from the top are amazing.
* Stayed at Yufuin Country Road Youth Hostel – for the price (separate room for two), it was amazing! Great view in the morning and a very nice onsen bath. Also, when you leave, the owners sing Country road on guitar for you. Perfect.
* **Food**
* Had breakfast at 風の丘 カフェ, which is run by a nice couple who really love everything British. While it wasn’t bad by any means I’d probably go to Ordinary Day Coffee next time.
* 湯布珈琲 – great matcha latte with dango
* Milch – tasty mini cheesecakes 

**Between Yufuin and Kurokawa Onsen in detail**

* Kokonoe Yume Otsuribashi – very high suspension bridge from which you get great views of two waterfalls
* Kuju Mountains - You can do some nice hiking here and chill at an onsen afterwards. Or just stretch your legs on the boardwalk across the Tadewara Wetlands and enjoy the scenery. I haven’t been due to heavy snowing but got an amazing view from the road here.
* Shimonjō Giant Ginkgo Tree – haven’t been but when the leaves turn yellow in early November it has to be stunning
* Nabegataki Falls – waterfalls interesting for the fact you can also walk behind them and see the sky through falling water. Advance reservation is recommended. Haven’t been
* Food: Yusuichaya – this was the best tofu I ever had! With the spring water set meal, you get to try so many types of tofu. Their udon is super delicious too. There is a spring water source right next to it where you can see people loading up huge containers of water

**Kurokawa Onsen in detail**

Super small town in the mountains, the point of visiting is staying overnight at a Ryokan – and there is a lot of them. We stayed at Yamamizuki and it was amazing. In Yamamizuki you can go anytime to the stunning riverside onsen, and the kaiseki dinner was simply amazing. Also, you have free access to two other onsens including an interesting cave one. 

As for the village itself, while it’s pretty there’s not much to see really, it’s just a nice stroll on the streets for half an hour. If you are a big fan of onsens, you can buy a pass to visit 3 of your choice (out of more than 20) at the info center. Worth highlighting are Pâtisserie Roku with tasty creampuffs and Raifu Gift and Curio Shop with very nice woodcraft and tea cups. 

If you have more time here, consider doing a small hike to the observation deck – haven’t been. 

  
**Between Kurokawa Onsen and Takachiho in detail**

Mount Aso (parking is elsewhere) - Big volcano caldera with few hiking options, like the 90 min hike to the Nakadake summit. This volcano is very moody – not only the weather can be bad (cloudy, rainy, icy…) but the volcanic activity might increase along with gas level. When that happens, and it does quite often, then the area is closed off. The status is regularly updated online. May the weather and volcano gods bless you during your visit – they didn’t do it for me unfortunately

* Daikanbo Lookout – amazing viewing point, you can see mount Aso and the huge crater around it
* Kikuchi Gorge – small forested river valley with few walking options. Haven’t been.
* Koga Falls – probably most interesting after it rained a lot or when it ices over winter. It’s a steep hike from the parking. Haven’t been.
* Kamishikimi Kumanoimasu Shrine – while the shrine looks beautiful in pictures, what they don’t show you are the crowds of people walking up the stairs. I would enjoy the mystical atmosphere of this place if I arrived early morning and didn’t have to listen to heavy breathing of unfit tourists or a child having a tantrum. When you reach the shrine, you can continue up to reach a natural arch which is nice but again nothing special.
* Oshitoishi Hill – are you into magnetic rocks with a view? Lucky you. Haven’t been.
* Shirakawa Spring   - if you’re passing by you can try the famous spring water here and enjoy the surroundings. Haven’t been.
* 高森ツリーハウス – kind of a wooden treehouse which is sadly abandoned, and you can only admire it from the outside. Haven’t been
* Mount Sobo – if hiking on Mount Aso doesn’t work out due to weather or volcanic activity, you can go hike on this one. Most people start from here. Haven’t been.
* Food: 山賊旅路 - nice local Japanese restaurant with a lot of interesting decor on the ceiling 

**Takachiho in detail**

People come her because of the Takachiho Gorge, which is a beautiful gorge where you can go for a short walk and even rent a boat to row under the rocks (reserve in advance). There are some problems though – the gorge is very small (don’t expect a nice hike here), the area where you can row your boat is even smaller, and there’s lots of tourists here. So, it’s questionable whether it’s worth going here just for the gorge. 

What we did was arrive in the evening and see the shortened Takachiho Kagura play (reservation recommended). Afterwards we checked the gorge, which was completely empty and nicely illuminated. Then we stayed at B&B Ukigumo and returned to the gorge in early morning (8am) before the crowds arrived. Afterwards, we continued by car to the Kunimigaoka Viewing Platform which has amazing views. Doing all this, going to Takachiho felt totally worth it.

I skipped it, but you can also check out the Amanoiwato Shrine where the goddess Amaterasu hid in a cave. The surrounding nature is nice.

Food: Everything in Takachiho seemed reserved (even a ramen place sent us away), it was pretty desperate. Eiraku, a lowkey yakiniku place, saved us. The food was good and cheap.

**Between Takachiho and Kagoshima in detail**

**Miyazaki - east coast**

* Hyuga is a nice seaside town that happens to be on the way to Kagoshima. We had amazing seafood at Seaside Station Hososhima. And from there it’s very close to the Skeluccha Viewing deck – it’s a nice walk and you can see interesting rock shaped into pillars. There is also Ōmi Shrine nearby, with Uto Shrine, a small shrine in a seaside cave right next to it.
* You can spend much more time on the east coast around Miyazaki. We haven’t been due to limited time, but it may be interesting for you. Below are some suggestions:
* Devil's Washboard - interesting rock formation which is probably best to view at low tide. The island surrounded by it seems lovely too.
* Sun Messe Nichinan – the Moai statues (only permitted replicas in the world) are an obvious draw, but surrounded by a theme park, made into a touristy gimmick… not sure if it’s worth it. 
* Cape Toi – a nice place with views made even better by the fact there are wild roaming horses all around.
* Udo Jingu - another coastal shrine in a cave. You can try hitting a target with wishing stones for good luck.
* Wakoen Harada Honten– there are many tea shops and plantations in Japan, this one caught my eye because it’s almost like a winery (but for tea). They can show you the factory, plantation and do some workshops like hojicha roasting. Sadly, not enough time for it. 大隅茶全, another tea shop half an hour from there looked promising too.

**Kirishima Kinkowan National Park**

This place is a hiker’s paradise. You can do a wide range of hikes of various length and difficulty, so everyone can find one for themselves here, I list some below. Keep in mind it’s still a volcanic area so some trails might be temporarily closed due to volcanic activity

1. Hike to Mount Karakuni  (500m elevation, 4km). I did this hike and despite the winter conditions in the upper part I will never forget the amazing view from the top. I will also not forget the amazing foot bath after at the tourist center. This hike can be extended into the whole Kirishima Ridge Trail, which is the king line here, 12km long in total.
2. Go to ONAMI-IKE LAKE which is an easier hike (200m elevation, 2km)
3. Do a very easy loop around Two Lakes Observatory (100 m elevation, 2 km)
4. Hike to the top of Mt. Takachiho (600m elevation, 6km). There is a ruin of a destroyed temple on the way.

* Maruo Falls - waterfalls for just a few min stop
* Kirishima Jingu – nice shrine with impressive trees around, a bit of a taster what is to come in Yakushima. 
* Onsens – there are many ryokans where you can stay overnight or just bathe in the onsen. Haven’t been. 
* If you’re Ghibli fan, don’t miss the Tonari no Totoro Bus Stop . It’s a life size statue with a beautiful background, and the owners (who made the statue themselves) even left an umbrella here so everyone can get the classic picture.
* Stayed at Guesthouse Coco Garage – the best equipped mountain cabin I have ever seen, including a massage chair. It’s very nice and spacious.  
* Food: *きりしま月の舟 –* cute café with an impressive library run by a Japanese couple that met in the UK. *As it often happens, the best things in Japan happen unplanned. We randomly stepped into a beautiful café where the husband was giving a lecture on Japanese mythology, and his wife made us nice tea. Turns out, she wrote a book about Yakushima where we are heading. They were both so nice!*



**Kagoshima**

Lovely city right next to a towering volcano, which tends to erupt from time to time, no big deal. Two things caught my eye - Suica doesn’t work on trams and a lot of people look ethnically different. Upon research, it seems to be the Ryukyuans. I had just half a day and really wish I could spend more time here.

* Sakurajima – you can get to this volcano with a short ferry. One of the recommended activities is renting bikes to go for 3 hours around the volcano, checking out the observation points, villages and a buried shrine gate. Going on a sea kayak tour seemed like an interesting option too. Haven’t been
* Sengan-en – beautiful Japanese garden with a spectacular view of Sakurajima, also some historic buildings here and a museum. Haven’t been
* Shiroyama Park Observation Deck  - if you want another view of the volcano and Kagoshima, this is the place. Haven’t been
* 展望露天温泉 さつま乃湯 – or maybe you want to look at Sakurajima from an onsen? Haven’t been
* Miyama- A small pottery village originally settled by potters from Korea. You can see and buy pottery or see glass blowing too. 
* Satsuma Peninsula – potential side trip if you want to try the hot sand bath, see a samurai district or a museum about kamikaze pilots 
* **Food**: 
* Kikaku Sushi – Kagoshima is generally cheaper so it makes sense to go for an Omakase here
* Sueyoshi – great eel restaurant, again, cheap, and very good
* Also consider trying some tonkatsu as Kagoshima is famous for it

**Yakushima**

If there’s one takeaway I want you to take from this post, it is: you HAVE TO see Yakushima. This is not only one of the best places in Kyushu, but possibly in whole of Japan. The nature is absolutely beautiful here, and it’s best explored through hikes which I list below (none require a guide). But even if you’re not into hiking, you can still see some beautiful trees, wild monkeys, waterfalls, beaches…a fascinating side of Japan you won’t experience on the golden route. I will definitely be back to do some more hiking (and also bouldering as I found there’s a climbing guidebook). 

I have mentioned earlier that renting a car is recommended. While you can use the buses, it will limit you significantly, especially timing-wise, determining when you can go to hikes and when do you need to return. Also, you won’t be able to make stops at interesting places on the way. The way we did it is fly in from Kagoshima, the rental car company was already waiting for us and took us to their office.  
  
Note that some roads or hikes can be closed due to the consequences of the summer typhoon, so always check on current trail conditions before you arrive.

* Yakusugi Museum – many people recommend you start here so you can have a full understanding of the unique forests in Yakushima. Haven’t been.
* Yakusugi Land – great introduction to the forest of Yakushima. The basic loop is quite short but takes you on a comfortable wooden walkway, from which you can see the beautiful cedar trees, some of which are over 1000 years old. The 30 or 50 minute courses are a perfect choice if you’re not into hiking, the latter encountering a nice suspension bridge across the gorge. What I didn’t know is that there are options to extend these loops, either to an 80 minute one (which I did and it was lovely, but definitely didn’t take so long), or even a 150 minute course. If that wasn’t enough, you can hike all the way to the top of Tachudake, which is an impressive rock sticking out of the jungle like a raised thumb. When you return to the parking, check out the very old Kigensugi Cedar which is further up the road.
* Shiratani Unsui Gorge – probably the most famous hike on Yakushima. The main trail (5km, 400m elevation) goes slowly up the mountain. This gorge inspired the Ghibli movie Princess Mononoke, and I understand why now. The higher you hike, the more interesting it gets. It’s hard to describe it, there is just so much green everywhere with all the ancient trees covered in moss. Eventually you get up to the Taikoiwa Rock where you are rewarded by a stunning view of the inland mountains. One of the best hikes I’ve done in my life.
* Jōmon Sugi – for Japanese people, this hike might be even more famous than the prior hike. Going to the oldest tree in Japan is considered a must-do pilgrimage, like hiking to the top of Mt. Fuji. I haven’t done this hike so I can only tell you that most of it follows along old railroad tracks, and only towards the end it gets exciting when it turns into a proper steep hiking trail. It’s 20 km total with 800m elevation, so quite a long hike and not sure if it’s as rewarding as the Shiratani Unsui one.
* Other hikes – there are other less popular options that become clear when you look at Strava Heatmaps. You can go to Mount Motchomu, Mount Aiko, Janokuchi Waterfall or a completely alternate trail to Jōmon Sugi from the north. But the hike deserving the most attention is the one going to Mount Miyanoura (14km, 800m elevation + Mount Kuromi can be added) where you see a different kind of Yakushima, since the terrain changes to alpine and your view isn’t covered by trees. 
* Linkups are an option too, a popular one is doing Shiratani Unsui with Jōmon Sugi in one hike. This is a one day epic with 19km and 1200m elevation – so only for experienced hikers. My personal plan for next time in Yakushima is to combine Mount Miyanoura with Jōmon Sugi so that you don’t have to return the same way you came and you have a nice hike with 22km and 920 elevation.

Now that we covered the hikes, we can look at the second attraction of Yakushima, which is seeing all the interesting sports around the island. I recommend seeing them in one epic round trip. The driving itself will take around 2 hours, but depending on how many places you visit you may need 4 hours or more. I list the places going from Miyanoura clockwise.

* Yakushima Hachimanju Tea Garden – local tea shop with a wide selection of products and delicious matcha ice-cream. You can check their tea fields right behind the shop.
* Hanii kiln – very cool pottery workshop hidden in the nature – follow the signs at the road, don’t trust google maps directions. I really regret I bought only one cup here.
* Yakusugi Woodcraft Factory – probably the best souvenir shop on the island with a huge display of products made of the local cedar wood.
* Three waterfalls - all of them in one area, with Senpiro Falls being the most impressive. You can comfortably see it from the parking lot or walk down to the valley to see it up closer. Ryujinno-taki Falls aren’t interesting at all, but nearby you can check the “secret” waterfall which is in a lovely valley. Finally, Torohki falls are nice with the water falling directly into the sea.
* Banyan trees- you can check these strange trees at either Sarukawa banyan tree or Shitoko Gajumaru Banyan Park.
* Hirauchi Kaichu Onsen – a unique onsen that is available only twice a day at low tide. It is an amazing feeling, sitting in a hot onsen pool with water from the sea coming in. People who find standard onsens too hot will especially love this one, as the temperature gets lower thanks to the sea. This is a mixed onsen, so you’re expected to cover yourself with a towel or light cloth.
* Yakushima Fruit Garden - “Papaya no Sato” – used to be a nice garden where the owner would show you around, but as they are getting old, you have to explore on your own. The owner still makes a fruit plate for you which is nice.
* Ohko Waterfall – you can get pretty close to this nice waterfall
* World Heritage Listed Coastal Road with Wildlife – shortly after the Ohko waterfall, the road gets narrow, and you get surrounded by nature. Not only by trees and rocks, but also monkeys and deer. Drive very slowly here and be mindful of the animals on the road - they will often chill in the middle of it and pretend they don’t see you, but they will back off when you come closer. Also be on alert for spots where you can move to the side if you encounter a car from the opposite direction. All of this might sound intimidating but it’s a great experience.
* Inakahama Beach -  after surviving the coastal road, you are rewarded by seeing the nicest beach on Yakushima. Not only can you chill and swim here, but during summer can also see turtles laying eggs or their babies hatching.
* **Food**: 
* Panorama – modern izakaya. Still not sure what that means, but now I know it’s not for me. Portions are very small for the price (tapas style), and while the service is super nice, the food is nothing special and I regret going here.
* 小花 – standard izakaya, food was okayish
* 喜来里 – decent food here, big portions
* Yakushima Airport Restaurant – didn’t expect to have my best meal at Yakushima here, but the udon set with flying fish was super good and I enjoyed watching the cute little airplanes. This is a good place to load up on souvenirs too. 
* Hiro Bakery – you should definitely try the rice flour bread, so good that we went to this bakery twice!
* Wakadaisho – decent sushi place that I didn’t get to try *On Monday, there was a sign saying „we’re closed today sorry”. On Tuesday, there was a sign saying “we’re closed today too but we promise we’ll be open tomorrow!“. On Wednesday I didn’t tempt my luck anymore :D*

**Kumamoto**

I haven’t been to this city at all, so I can’t tell you much about it. It’s a standard modern city with few attractions and many people use it as a starting point to visit Mount Aso. Also, the local mascot Kumamon is quite famous. Based on my research, it can be skipped without regrets. Even in the promotional video from Japan guide it doesn’t seem particularly interesting.

* Kumamoto Castle – impressive castle, unfortunately severely damaged by the earthquake since 2016 and repairs will last till around 2038. Whether it’s worth visiting in its current state is for you to decide, unless it’s Sakura season in which it’s a must go.
* Suizenji Garden – nice garden including a mini Mount Fuji 
* One piece statues – if you are a fan of One Piece, you will be interested by the bronze statues spread around the city and beyond



That’s it! I hope you enjoy Kyushu, if you have any questions or suggestions let me know in the comments. Also, if you have any tips for Hokkaido in the Autumn, let me know 🙂
