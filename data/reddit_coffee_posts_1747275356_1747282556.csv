[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/s/fHu1gtjGUr): **April 4, 2024** 

My wife cheated on me nearly ten years ago. I won't get into the specifics, as they're unimportant, but due to the fact that I saw blame on both of our parts, I forgave her and we moved past it.

My daughter is sixteen years old, and she only just found out, from my MIL, who seems to have decided she was old enough to hear the family 'gossip', and that she would be 'mature' enough not to confront her. Initially, my wife thought I had told her, and came into my office where I had been, to ask me what the hell I was thinking, and if I was trying to destroy their relationship. (She and my daughter have been strained for a couple years now, lots of arguing, on both sides.) She refused to believe that I hadn't said anything at first until my daughter entered the room and joined in on the screaming that I was too 'weak' and her own mother had sold her out.

The fighting went on a long time, and honestly I may as well have not been there, for all the good I did. I tried to step between them when I was concerned, but that only ended with some ringing in my ear, haha. Eventually, my wife left to cool off, and my daughter and I could talk. She wasn't happy with me either, and didn't hesitate to tell me so, but she wasn't screaming or throwing shit anymore, so I just let her get it out.

She asked me why I stayed and I was honest, that I was no perfect husband, and I decided not to end my marriage, break up our home, and destroy her childhood for something that I held blame in as well.

The entire time I was speaking, she just kept watching me with this sad face that made me uncomfortable, but when I finished she just shook her head and said that I needed to leave my wife, and that the cheating 'wasn't the only issue'. She started bringing up every insignificant 'flaw' my wife has, (She brought up my wife getting angry at me because I had put too much creamer in her coffee, for example, just trivial crap).

I told her as much but she just kept shaking her head. It ended up turning into an argument where she insisted I was some sort of victim, and making some kind of *getaway plan.* I kept trying to talk her down, but that was going no where.

I first tried my wife, but found my call went straight to voicemail, so I called my MIL to inform her of the situation, but my wife had already made it there, and planned to stay overnight to calm down, because she didn't want to 'see either of our faces'.

It's been a few days now and I still haven't seen her, or heard from her, but her mother informs me she's okay, just very emotional. So I'm also scared for my wife (She has had mental health struggles before, and if she's going through that again, I should be there to help). (EDIT: To the people who have commented, or private messaged me to say I shouldn't care. My wife almost died the last time she had an episode, and I don't think even my daughter, as angry as she Is right now, wants her mom *dead*). My daughter told me she hopes her mother never came back. I'm just feeling defeated, and tired. I've done everything I can to keep this family floating, and somehow I'm still failing. It's beginning to feel like I always do, at everything, and always *will* fail at everything, as long as I live.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter:** Ok few thoughts here:

1 - MIL is completely in the wrong, it’s NO ONES business to fill daughter in on ‘family gossip’ that includes her parents.

2 - I’m sure some of this is normal teenage rebellion crap.

HOWEVER:

Your wife got angry about too much creamer in the coffee? You say trivial stuff BUT

How often does wife get overly sensitive about trivial shit? There is a point where it becomes you managing wife’s emotional outbursts instead of wife working on her own issues.

Does daughter have a point at all?

> **OOP:** I 120% agree. I'm slightly in shock that my wife is mad at me, and our daughter, but somehow not too angry to stay in the house of the person who told her? I don't know, that part has been messing me up a lot, I think. My daughter has definitely been going through some teenage rebellion stuff, which I haven't minded because it's introduced me to a lot of new music when she's mad, but my wife has had some issue with because she's scared when my daughter get's older she'll regret all the crazy hair or odd clothes. I've been trying to help her with that, because I was a little teenage-dirtbag myself, and my daughter is a good kid, no real trouble out of her other than being a smart-ass sometimes, which she comes by honest.
> 
> To the rest, I don't know. My wife is temperamental, but she's not violent. I mean, she just gets mad easy. She get's over it pretty fast though. Like, she yelled about the coffee thing, dumped it out, and got a new cup and it never come up again. I honestly forgot about it until my daughter brought it up, it really wasn't a big deal.

**Commenter 2:** What the fuck was your MIL thinking to tell that shit to a kid? She sounds like a miserable asshole who loves to stir up the shit. I wouldn't even be remotely cordial or polite to her again.

> **OOP:** From what she said, for some *reason* she was idiotic enough to think my daughter would keep it to herself- which honestly I'm glad she didn't because I know how secrets like that can eat at a kid, and that it was 'harmless gossip' because it was so long ago, and I stayed. Like if I had forgiven her, somehow my daughter wasn't meant to be affected by it? I've been working on staying calm, because she's my only link to my wife right now, and yelling at her is a good way to get blocked and have no sure way of getting updates on her.

**Commenter 3:** Ok just because someone isn’t violent doesn’t mean they aren’t making an emotionally hostile environment for everyone else and you may need to examine that or I anticipate daughter will want to leave the house as soon as she’s able to.

My dad remarried a woman with a similar temperament. She was quick to anger but quick to move on…it honestly felt like an emotional rollercoaster sometimes. Dad loved her so he looked past this flaw as her partner chalking it off to ‘just the way she, it’s but she’s a good person’. And yea that was true, she wasn’t a bad person.

But he failed to realize her emotional outbursts made US kids feel like the vibe around the house was tense since small trivial things could make her snap even for just a minute. It just wasn’t pleasant to be around at all.

> **OOP:** They were always so close growing up, though. I mean, I felt like the bonus parent at times, because they were so close when she was little. Like, I remember being a bit jealous about it, because I would laugh and think to myself that I thought dads and daughters were supposed to have the special relationship, haha. They only really started fighting when my daughter was fourteen. I guess I still feel guilty, because their first fight was 100% my fault, and I still blame myself for it.
> 
>> **Commenter 3:** Hm really? Their first fight was *“100%_” your fault? That’s amazing - you managed to force two other people to fight, and basically created the difficulties in a mother-daughter relationship _all by yourself?!* /s
>> 
>> It sounds like you’re very prone to taking responsibility (or blame) for other people’s actions. This can be a good trait, up to a point. But not when it’s combined with another person who’s emotionally abusive and likes to shift blame for their actions onto someone else. Which may describe your wife.
>> 
>> Your daughter is telling you your wife is abusive. And she’s telling you that the way you make excuses for and accommodate your wife hurts her - makes her feel unprotected by you, disappointed in you, and sad for you. These things can all be true even if your wife is a good person in other ways, and even if she loves your daughter.
>> 
>> You’ve told yourself that accepting your wife’s explosive temper is a form of maturity on your part. For your daughter’s sake and your own (and even your wife’s), you need to ask yourself if what you’re really doing is being an enabler of abusive behavior.
>>> 
>>> **OOP:** I just don't know if I can see it that way. I mean, my mom used to be really abusive when I was young, in more ways than one. (My daughter doesn't know about that, my mom died before she was born) My wife has never been anything like that at all.
>>> 
>>> I do intend to talk to my daughter, because a lot of people are saying my wife may be hurting my daughter behind closed doors- other than the fighting which we've been trying to work out for a while. I will speak with her, and depending on her answers, I will go from there. The biggest reason I dismissed my daughters concerns, though, was because it was all about me.
>>> 
>>> Like during that talk she never spoke up about her mother hurting her at all. If she had even told me that she had no reason for it, but she was afraid of her mother, I would have taken that to heart, and we could have figured it out from there.
>>> 
>>> I just don't see my wife shouting and pouring out some coffee as anything remotely close to my mom.

**Commenter 4:** Tell us more about the MIL. Does she usually intrude on your personal lives like this?

> **OOP:** MIL and my wife were always close. She's said more than once that her mother is her best friend. Intrude... Its hard to say. I don't particularly like her knowing everything about our marriage because its weird to me, but then I had no relationship to speak of with my mother when she was alive, so I have no idea if thats actually just me being weird.

&nbsp;

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/s/OBdsP4h3Xa): **May 8, 2025 (13 months later)**

It's been a while. I probably will regret posting this as much as I did the first time, though for different reasons. Before I begin, I want to thank all the kind people who reached out with genuine advice and with whom I had lovely conversations. I appreciate you more than I can say.

Checking my history, I saw that I never updated after the conversation with my daughter about her situation with my wife. We talked, and it went worse than I expected, but better than most of the comments. She never hit my daughter or threatened her. My daughter did bring up the yelling, and I listened, though she said she was never afraid of her mother, but she started to hate her when she noticed how she treated me; hence the change in appearance and rebelling. She liked that I stood up for her when it came to her new style, because then I was 'standing up for something'. That makes me laugh a bit now, but at the time, I was confused.

We talked a long time, and she said she thought maybe she could get over the resentment she had for her mother if she didn't have to see the way she treats me. I didn't much like that at the time, and I admit I argued that I was an adult and she didn't have to fight my fights for me. My daughter said something like, 'If I don't, who will?' and it just kinda stopped me in my tracks, because my only answer, 'Sometimes you have to pick your battles,' sounds weak when you pick none of them.

I still intended to try to work on my marriage, despite the comments. I really hoped to turn things around because of their previous relationship, and frankly, how much I still loved my then-wife. But then she didn't come home for weeks. I don't know if it was my daughters needling, or the fact I could tell she was upset at being abandoned by her mother at the first sign of trouble, but one day I eventually reached out and asked my Ex-Mil when my wife was going to come home and act like an adult, and was told she was looking into divorce attorneys, and that if I wanted her back I should really work on getting my daughter to apologize.

It all felt so manipulative, and I just got so angry. I just hung up and spoke to my own Lawyer. After being served, she tried to come back and cried that it was her mental health, but I was still so angry, I just shut her down and told her to leave. Divorce was finalized a while ago., My Daughter stays with me most of the time, since her mother moved out of state afterward, and she wants to go to college in the area when the time comes, but visits MIL, and speaks to her mother on the phone sometimes. As much as I hate to admit it, their relationship is improving since the divorce.

I don't hate my Ex-wife, even if many, including my daughter, categorize her as abusive; she's the first woman I ever really clicked with in that way, and though I don't love her anymore, probably the last. I don't mind it so much, I have a full life without her around, and a quieter one as well.

But, anyway, thank you all again for listening, and I am bracing for ""I told you so's"". I don't blame you, you did.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** It does seem obvious that you were being a doormat if your own child viewed herself as needing to be your savior from her mother. Then learning the betrayal made how she felt 10x more valid. I believe your ex MIL wanted this outcome and felt similar to your daughter

Hopefully you’re doing better for yourself and listening to your daughter more instead of being defensive lol. Good luck with everything

> **OOP:** My Ex MIL may have, but with the shit storm she was constantly starting during the divorce I doubt it. I think she just wanted to gossip and start drama. Predictable for her. From what I hear from my daughter, I don't ask, but she tells anyway, MIL is broken up about my ex leaving the state.

**Commenter 2:** She thought your daughter should apologize??! 🤦🏽‍♀️

You will be so much better off without her. ❤️

> **OOP:** I'm fairly certain she wanted my teenage daughter to pretend she didn't even know. Which is ridiculous, and regardless of my feelings on the incident, that wasn't going to happen. and I wouldn't want it to.

**Commenter 3:** Your daughter saved all 3 of your lives. Your wife was abusive. Your daughter was being abused, and so were you. I'm glad she was adult enough to finally put an end to this madness. I really hope your ex-wife gets serious mental help and your daughter doesn't have lasting effects from it.

> **OOP:** From what I know my ex is ""Finding herself"". Good for her, I never even knew she was lost.
> 
> My daughter is a strong young woman. Stronger than I ever was or ever will be. I am more proud of her than I can possibly explain, even without this situation. She's the best part of my life, and to quote the old sayings, when I count my blessings I count her twice.

**OOP on ex-MIL and her visits**

> **OOP:** My MIL is no longer allowed in my house due to some of her actions over the past year, but my daughter is 17 now, with her own car, and I won't prevent her from talking with her on the phone or visiting if she wants. She's never expressed a desire not to see her anymore, and I'm not going to force the issue. If she changes her mind, that's no problem for me, but I've been very clear that she has no obligation to cut off anyone over me.

**Why does ex-MIL hate OOP?**

> **OOP:** There's a lot to that. She never really *liked* me exactly, mostly tolerated me because I was a 'decent' husband in her words. But she tried to get me to drop the divorce since 'clearly' my ex was having an 'episode' when she brought it up in the first place, then the divorce proceedings started she insisted my ex should get full custody despite my daughter, and my ex wife arguing against it, then it was division of assets and she had a problem with anything not handed over to my ex, even ridiculous things (she argued my ex should get both cars). My ex was surprisingly reasonable, but it was like her mother wanted me punished for 'giving up' on my ex.
> 
> After a lot of screaming when she showed up at my house anytime I was home, I eventually told her that she was no longer welcome and if she came back, I would call the police to escort her off the property, I think that scared her, and she hasn't been my problem since.

Prologue

You've heard their tales. Their legends. You already know their story. But not mine....

To many, I was just an expendable soldier— one of thousands sent to die in the scorching sands of the Middle East. One of the ""cogs in the machine"". Interchangable, mechanical, and necessary. Once we are broken, we are easily replaced. They expect us to fight. To bleed. To fall. 

I used to wonder on how many chances I have left. A bullet, a bomb, a blade. Some days felt like I was gambling with Death itself. And I kept winning. Until the day I didn't.

My name is Sergeant Paul Jackson, United States Marines Corps 1st Force Recon—
And this is my story. 

A story forged in fire and burning sands in the midst of an smart bombs, faster kills, and colder orders. A story born in— Modern Warfare. 


Chapter 1: Early Years

Most folks think that inside the Marine Corps breed the toughest, and most enduring humans in the planet. But the fact they didn't know that before they joined the Corps, wearing the uniform, and carrying a weapon of a Marine, some were forced to be one in their own, fucking civilian life. And I was one of them. Not physically, but emotionally and mentally. But I ain't gonna say that all of my early life was shitty.

I lived in a small neighborhood outside San Antonio, Texas. It's a peaceful neighborhood— but can be tough in its own fashion. A good ol' classic Texan environment. Cattles being guarded by real damn cowboys, barbeque parties in the weekend, fucking bull riding competitions, ice cold as fuck beers, and most of all, guns. For self defense of course, you dumbasses. That was the good ol' Texan lifestyle. For some people, they may think it's an inappropriate neighborhood to raise kids. Especially when guns are involved. But the guns in my place were only small to medium revolvers. Some had even shot guns too and they were tucked as hell. But the outsiders do not know  is that some people had shit even harder at home. Especially like folks me.

I was the first son of the three children of Juno and Mary Jackson. A big brother to Theresa and Johnny Jackson. Also, I am Toby's master, our family mutt, who knew more about me than my whole damn parents, except my siblings, friends, and my squad of course.

My father and mother always throwing accusations and fighting like wild as hell. He always have an affair with women younger than my mother, although they were married since they are 18 years old back then. So, they were into their early 30s or something. My mother, despite all the affairs of his, chose to stay not to have a divorce. Because of the fact she loved him. Until she met another man. They were young and somewhat immature to marry each other, after conceiving me in the womb. So, we were taken by my mother's sister, Aunty Anna, who lived in the same neighborhood.  She was the elder sister of my mom, yet she had no family. So she took me and my siblings under her wing. For years, she had been our mother. Although not by blood, but by the things she done for us, for me. The thing that we didn't expect is that, she had a terminal illness. Which cannot be cured. She kept it a secret until it got worsen. Despite this, she attended my graduation in school. While my parents... Don't expect much. Until her last breath, she told me to take care of much siblings, and myself. So I can do good for others. She said that it is our duty from God, to serve others with kindness, and fight for what's right.

After her funeral, our stupid ass dad separated me from my brother and sister. While my mom took my siblings into the East Coast with her new husband. It was me and Toby from then on. Living with my old man was such a drag to be honest. I had to endure my whole high school life broke, even though my teachers help me financially from time to time. I endure all insults from the old man's new wife and her motherfucking children. One time, her daughter wanted me to ""hit"" her hard. Like, what the fuck bro?! I ain't doin shit. Quit watching porn. They treated me a maid, more than a family. It is a fucking prison. Or at least worse if it weren't for my dog. He stayed by my side. Even the times when my dad will punch, and kicking my ass often. He protected me but also, got hurt. Until he was given away to a random ass dude by my step mother. I wouldn't wish or dream this whole damn experience to anyone, even Khaled Al-Asad. I know he is bad and shit, but no one had to go through this. The neighbors knew this, and hated my new family for it. They knew how he abused my mom and us back then. But this shit, is enough. They even once held a Mexican standoff which didn't turn into a shoot out. Thank God that no shots were fired. 


Chapter 2:  Escaping the Hell hole

Thankfully after highschool, my other relatives contacted me to help them in the family business , which is a restaurant in Sacramento, California. They have a small room with bath and a single bed perfect for one. Without any second thought, I accepted the offer. My ""family"" or if it's even family, doesn't care even if I was shot dead, doesn't mind me leaving their place. To be honest, they would be more happy if I wasn't born at all. Painful although, but at least I get to leave in that fucking hell hole. Uncle Benjamin, Miss Dawson, my teacher, and the rest of the hood helped me arranged my travels. Collecting money, packing up and selling some of my old stuff. And the ticket for the bus to California. The day came, and they all came with me in the terminal. Saying their best wishes for me and to be careful. ""Be careful kid, that ain't Texas you know"" said Uncle Benjamin. ""Yeah, thanks man. Thank you. For everything"" I said. Uncle, then hugged me and whispered ""I packed my good ol revolver on you stuff. It's yours son."" I was shocked that his beloved pistol, used in Vietnam war, was given to me as a gift from the hood. We waved onto each other as the bus went on. For the first time, I felt true freedom. The American freedom. No toxic family, new beginning, and possibly, just maybe— a new love. 


Chapter 3: Sacramento Days

Hours of journey passed and the bus rolled into the highway, I finally woke up from my good ol' beauty sleep, and the bus arrived in Sacramento. Upon leaving the bus I  then, was greeted by his cousin, Derrick and his mom, Janett, who is also my aunty. They greeted me with warm smiles, something that I had never experienced for years. We went into the car and drive all the way to my new home, their home. Arriving into the front yard, I helped them carry my stuff to the front door until I was stumble upon the rest of the family, really close friends, and even some of the workers in the restaurant. They even held a small welcome party for me. It's been a long time since a party held with my own family after the death of Aunt Anna.

""You must be exhausted from the journey, let Derrick, and Boris take your stuff"" said by my uncle, David. The old man of the house. After putting my baggages inside , all of us were in the living area while the music is playing. People chattering to each other, the kids are messing around for a bit, while some taking food from the buffet. It was something common to them, but overwhelming for me, or is it the years that I never experienced such event. While everyone was doing stuff, I was offered by old man David for a talk while drinking some ice cold beer outside. 

Uncle David was my dad's brother. Back when they were young, they had a rivalry on who wins my mom's heart first. Sadly, my dad won by having me. But to Uncle David, it was ok. As long as she is happy, until she wasn't. He heard all the family drama from Texas. He offered us to stay with him and his family in Sacramento at first, but mom didn't agree. For she had a new life with her new husband and my siblings who recently separated from me. He wanted to have me long ago, but due to parental custody he have on me, he wasn't that successful, until I was 18 and an adult who could choose where I want to live.

We talked for a while about the thing that went into the past years in Texas. Complimenting I am a strong kid. ""You got guts, and heart. Don't worry, it's all over now"" he said. He hugged me tightly that couldn't breathe for a sec. But I needed that. For a brief moment we are called inside. The rest of the night were filled with happiness and fun. 

A week later and after familiarizing with myself on how things run in the restaurant, I decided to do the delivery, for at the time, I was a type of person who always go outside and explore the place. It wasn't Texas afterall, so I get to see new places, food, stuff, and even ladies. Of course, at the time, I wasn't fixated on girls, after what happened between me and my stepsister. 

The delivery was simple. Derrick and Boris took me to a stroll and had me memorized the streets for delivering. Also, fun with the bros is about to begin. We started off by the mall, where I get to buy new clothes and stuff. The money came from uncle David. He also told me to buy my own phone. So in case I am lost or something, I could call them right away.

 After the mall, we went into the market to order supplies for the restaurant. Hour later, we were walking in the streets to buy some coffee and bread for the old man and his wife. Then I saw a military truck that had Marines on it. I asked ""Is there any a military base here by chance?"" ""No, there's only a recruitment station here."" said Boris. Derrick also replied ""The Marines are here to test the new recruits there. Also for the security purpose of the station because recently a suicide bomber was found with one of the recruits. Folks over there are paranoid that they even request some worst of the Marines to guard them. But you know what they say, Marine is a Marine."" For a second, I thought to join the army. But shit got blown away. 

After we get all we need, we all straight back home. But something's off. The restaurant had not closed all it's curtains usually. Then, me and the boys check on the back, seeing a robbery was in play. They, then suggested to call the cops, but that would alarm them and possibly dispose of everyone inside. Of course me, a Texan doesn't usually call the cops to settle things. I told them to go back home first and get my pistol from old man Ben. Since they knew I'm a Texan and knew how Texans settle problems, they agree. After arriving at the house, I then rushed to my room and took the revolver, and a dozen of ammo. We all went back to the restaurant but entered the back. 

""Shit, they got guns. You sure know how to do this?"" asked Derrick. I instructed them to break the window glass with rocks to draw the robbers. They did as expected and drew the attention away. Then I manage to untie some of the employees. But I was blown and the robbers started shooting. As an Texan, if your neighbor doesn't settle problems and just straight shooting my ass, I better get shooting. I stood on my position, managed to wound them in the hand, feet, and legs. But one of them aimed for my head. And in return, I shot him only in the hand, feet and n the sitrep. And came to the rescue. 

After the men were arrested and the situation went back to normal, aunt Janett approached me and to see if I got shot or something. 

""Are you ok, honey?? Tell me that you didn't get shot. I'll call the–""

""I'm fine, aunty. Thanks. You should be the one to get to the hospital.""

Just as aunt Janett about to speak, the Marines approached me. 

""Nice shooting, I am Sgt. Jones by the way. This is Pvt. Eliza Hart."" *Paul shakes hands to the Marines. "" And you are?"" asked Sgt. Jones.

""I'm Paul Jackson, Sir. Thank you for the actions you did to save everyone in the restaurant"". 

Jones replied ""Oh no, I should be the one who be thankful. You saved our great chef you know. The boys back in the base loved the food here. So, we are like family. By the way, where did you learn to shoot?""

""My aunty from Texas sir! She was a retired cop in our town.""

""So you are from Texas? Which one?""

""San Antonio."" After this, Sgt. Jones went to talk to the police and David.

""You handled yourself well. Not a bad shooting from a Texan. Bet you getting all the ladies back there"" said Eliza. Then, I replied:

""I wish I could but..."" As he about to finish his sentence, Jones called. ""Hey Pvt. Hart, we're leaving. Looks like we are going back here tomorrow.""

After hearing this, Eliza said good bye to me and said:

""Don't worry, you'll get one"" she said as she winks on Jackson. Hinting that he had taken the nice shots. 

""Hey, I shoot better than flirting""

""I will teach you that!' as Pvt. Hart hops on to the marine jeep.

I, for a moment stared at the jeep leaving farther. Then Uncle David said: ""She's a fine woman you know. You've been here for a week and you already caught yourself a chick?""

Boris added: ""Not just some chick. But a Marine one.""

I said: ""When see said I'll get one. Does that mean a girl, or a bullet?""

""Don't be a dumbass"" said Derrick. 

After the small talk, we all do our job to fix the restaurant. But I didn't know about the interaction between me and the Marines were just beginning.


Chapter 4: Metal Rose

It's been 3 months since my arrival in Sacramento. And things are truly opposite as it is in Texas. I like the way I'm living there. I got a decent job, good home, and a warming and cheerful company at home, and at work. Sure once in a while I visit Pvt. Hart when I deliver foods in their station. I became close with her the more times I visit the station. We always had small talks. Making jokes. Sometimes, she'd wait outside just to have conversation with me, even if she wasn't the one who ordered. In some chances too, we hang out in the bar like ""brothers"". Although she is a bit manly die to her time in the Marines, she is just... A young adult like me back then. 

 Then one afternoon, she visited me not as a customer— but as a friend. Me and my cousins waited for their dates so we can go to the local bazaar market. It was a huge event at the time. I can't remember if it was the city founding or whatever. But one thing I remember, is just her.

She looked.... Beautiful. Not in a made up way.  She wasn't in uniform that day, for some Marines were needed for the city security and most takin their day off. No name tag, no rank, no war. Just Eliza. Hair tied loosely, eyes soft, smiles were a bit nervous. She wore a red rose dress. As gorgeous as any women could wear— and this motherfucker,for a second, forgot she was a soldier. Just a young woman who is the same age as I were. 

We spent the rest of the day strolling around the center of the city. Tasting different types of cuisine, window shopping on different types of booths, watch the kids as they play games in county fairs, and jamming to jazz music performing across the city center.

When night time came, decorative lights dominates the night sky. It was more like Christmas market, but I don't know why. It was very different than the ones in Texas. My cousins and their dates went on a different way from us. It is subtle but I knew they want me to make out with her. So, Eliza and I continue window shopping. Then we stumble upon a gift shop of an old American Indian lady. She was selling trinklets, keychains, and dream catchers. Eliza saw a light metal necklace whose middle is a rose. It had a tiny metal spikes surrounding the lace. 

""It's strong, but it's still a rose. Just like you"" as she looked at me. Me, being a dumbass, don't know on what to reply. Just fking nod and took the initiative to buy the necklace for her. 

""What's this?"" She asked. 

""A gift. What else? I think it fits for you. You're hot as damn you know?"" Eliza then, blushes for a bit. 

""Stop fucking around. But thanks. It's the first time I hear this from someone.""

Some minutes later, the fireworks began to light the sky, like missiles exploding middair. While the people are busy watching the display, she, for the first time shared her life story, to me. She grew up in a rich household, with her parents being owners of a known company, but she didn't specify. And of course as her friend, or something else, didn't ask questions and listened to her. Her life was really easy. Everything that most kids wants, she could get it instantly.  

""I grew up in a rich family. Every kid 's dreams and desires, I could get it instantly. But, my nanny taught me about fairness and equality. So, I unconsciously adapted that philosophy. But of course, rich people being rich, my parents doesn't like my... ""Rebellious"" behaviour. And being a daughter of rich people, I was forced to act one.""

Me, laughing my ass a little for being how rebeIlious she is, despite the fact she was one of the most responsive and disciplined in her squad. Then she punch me in the stomach slightly.

""Aww!! What was that for?!""

""I thought you're here listening??""

""Sorry."" She also apologized to me for hitting me. 

""I was 16 years old and still, can't take off that mindset. This is also the time where I found out that I was bound to marry some boy from another company. And I had it. I rebelled so hard that they kept me locked in the room. But luckily, I made own way to escape. Took the money I have from my bank account, my stuff, and some documents. My nanny, who is now retired accepted me when I left my parents. And told her about my situation. Which she understand and accepted me."" 

""What happened?""

""My parents found me, and forced me to go home with them. But luckily, my nanny, and her neighbors, were former Marines. Most were trusted by the cops and in the city government. So, they had no choice but to let me go. Some time later, I get an advance training from the vets in the hood. But told me not to show it all at once, cuz that would result in something I would regret. I got recruited, trained for months, endured that fucking one of a hell training you know, until I got the uniform and the rifle. I told to myself that this is it. You have the chance to travel around the world without being a vip.""

""Have you considered to be in a relationship? Like where you can choose who to love?"" I said to her.

""Well... There's this one gu—"" 

""No way?! For real? No shit! What was he like?""

""Well, he's a good shooter. Tall, brave, caring, awkward when talking to girls, but had a different kind of... Aura in him...""

For a brief moment, we were... Silent. My heart beats like, it beats the same time as Eliza's.... As our faces about to embrace each other, Boris came to interrupt my moment— our moment. Dragging us to watch the fireworks together. As we watched, her hands and mine, held onto each other. Without direct confession, I knew I was the one she was talking about. The great shooter, tall, brave, and awkward. I was truly a dumbass and a badass back then....

For Landlords: 

\- Structure Insurance: Mandatory. Covers rebuilding costs (fire, floods, riots). 

  Example: Earthquake cracks your building? Rebuild at ₹50 lakh, not ₹1 crore market value. 

\- Contents Insurance: Optional but critical if you rent furnished spaces. 

  Reality Check: Tenant trashes your sofa? Insurance replaces it—but only if declared upfront. 

\- Loss of Rent: Pays you if the property becomes uninhabitable. 

  Cold Truth: If a flood forces tenants out, insurers cover lost rent… unless the policy excludes ""gradual damage"" (e.g., mold). 

 

For Tenants: 

\- Contents Insurance: Protects personal belongings (laptops, clothes). 

  Example: Burglar steals your gadgets? Claim reimbursement… if you itemized them. 

\- Liability Cover: Saves you from accidental damage to the landlord’s property. 

 Gotcha Moment: Break a window? Covered. Spill coffee on a vintage rug? Not unless it’s explicitly included. 

The Numbers Don’t Lie 

Here’s the cost of insuring a ₹1 crore property + ₹30 lakh contents (5-year premium): 

| Insurer       | Premium (₹) | 

|---------------|-------------| 

| Bajaj Allianz | 13,806      | 

| SBI           | 14,438      | 

| Digit         | 15,760      | 

\*Note\*: Cheapest ≠ best. Exclusions vary wildly. 

BUT….Is This Just Fear-Mongering? 

Let’s flip the script. Insurance companies profit from your paranoia. 

1. Landlords: 

   \- Loss of Rent sounds great, but policies often exclude ""preventable"" disasters (e.g., poor maintenance leading to water damage). 

   \- ""Reinstatement value"" calculations ignore inflation. By the time disaster strikes, rebuilding costs could skyrocket, leaving you underinsured. 

2. Tenants: 

   \- Liability cover is a safety net, but how often do tenants accidentally burn down apartments? Statistically, you’re paying for a ""maybe."" 

   \- Insurers love loopholes. Did you forget to photograph your belongings? Claim denied. 

The Unspoken Truth: 

Insurance is a business, not charity. Policies are designed to minimize payouts. For every success story, there’s a tenant fighting over a denied claim or a landlord discovering their ""comprehensive"" plan excludes monsoon floods. 

Final Take: 

Home insurance can be a lifesaver—if you read every line of the policy, document obsessively and cross-examine agents. But ask yourself: Are you buying peace of mind… or funding an industry that thrives on your worst fears?

Problem is with my ADHD-hyperfixating tendencies, I'm worried this obsession is going to die out in a few weeks and I'll be deeep in a financial hole and back to frequenting coffee shops. I guess I'm asking what my budget expectations should be for a good quality grinder (preferably one with a portafilter cradle but not required). And if you have any specific product recs, I'd love to hear them. My original mindset was hoping to keep it under $100. Now that I'm a bit better educated on the topic and have dealt with the frustration of a horribly performing grinder from amazon, that seems a bit naive.

Will you be my caffeinated friend and help me diagnose?  [Baratza Encore, Capresso EC Pro]","Ok, first issue is my Baratza grinder. It's an Encore... and that's kind of what I'm looking to give it.

I've used it for pressurized portafilter before, it did an ok job, but I've been using it to daily drive my V60 for the past 2 years. I use Grindz everyday (is what I'd tell my dentist, but really I use it every year or so). In any case, recently, over a very short period (maybe 2min of grinding time, tops, over a few days), it went from good to useless, without me adjusting or modifying anything in the least.

Basically, whether it's at its finest (or, well, used to be) or its coarser setting, it delivers similar size grinds (see photo showing off the full range of the machine). This is trash coffee from 10 years ago (what am I going to do, waste good coffee on this?), but here is a lighter roast (on the right of the photo with 2 groups; look at that full-sized chaff!), at the same brew settings.

What in the world could be happening here?

Problem 2.

My brother borrowed my Capresso EC Pro espresso machine, and gave it back in a... well, non-working state. He daily drove it, never descaled over the 2 years he's made a daily latte with it, and yeah, pitiful. I mean, he could've at least cleaned it, right?

Nothing will come out of group head nor the steam wand. I mean, given water is available, ideally, this would, but alas.

Still, can I bring it back to life if it makes the sordid noise you'll encounter in the video? What's broken? Can I buy parts?

I’m into late-night convos, dancing and listening reggaeton, and any excuse to learn something new—especially if it’s useless in a practical sense but cool in a “did you know…” kind of way. Big fan of things that make me feel alive: dancing, traveling, laughing way too hard, riding roller coasters, and drinking a lot of coffee. Black.

I love people who are passionate about weird stuff, and I collect moments where things just *click*—whether it’s a well-timed joke or a really good question.

### Wild

Wild me is kinda the same, but in a hot, steamy way. I enjoy talking about kinks, roleplaying, sexting, trading, and feeling good. Everything in a safe way, of course... been there, done that.

My favorite kinks revolve around power exchange, be it bdsm, orgasm control, CNC, free use, or bondage. I enjoy playing the role of a pleasure top, being the one in control get's me going. I also enjoy playing a bull for couples or cucks.

I also really enjoy blowjobs (the sloppier the better), interesting sex positions (what's your favorite?), group play, and public play.

And of course, having fun online. That's my favorite, and the reason I keep coming back to reddit. Like a lot of guys, I prefer girls around my age. But I usually don't turn down a good convo.

1kmyhnn,https://www.reddit.com/r/digimarketeronline/comments/1kmyhnn/what_are_some_costeffective_ways_to_conduct/,What are some cost-effective ways to conduct marketing research without using expensive methods such as online surveys or focus groups?,"*Smart, scrappy marketing research* can actually be more insightful than expensive ""big agency"" methods. 🔎💡  
(**2025 mindset:** *Real insights beat glossy reports.*)

Here are **some seriously cost-effective ways** to run marketing research without draining your budget:

# 🧠 1. Social Listening on Steroids

Instead of paying for surveys, **go where people already talk**:

* Reddit threads (especially niche subreddits)
* Product reviews (Amazon, Yelp, Trustpilot)
* Facebook groups and TikTok comments
* Twitter/X searches on hashtags
* YouTube video comments for products/topics

🔍 **What to look for:**

* Complaints = pain points
* Excitement = emotional triggers
* Repetitions = key trends

💬 **Tip:**  
Use free tools like **Google Alerts** or basic versions of **Hootsuite** or **Brandwatch** to automate some of this.

# 🧠 2. One-on-One Informal Interviews

Instead of focus groups ($$$), do **casual 15-minute Zooms or coffee chats** with real users or target customers.

👥 **How:**

* Post a casual invite on LinkedIn, Instagram Stories, or niche forums
* Offer a small thank-you (like a $10 gift card or even just public recognition)

✨ **Bonus:**  
Informal chats = *realer* insights than people trying to ""perform"" in a formal group setting.

# 🧠 3. Customer Service and Sales Team ""Gold Mining""

Your sales reps and support team hear **everything** first-hand.

🎧 Set up a process like:

* Monthly ""pain point"" roundups
* Quick surveys: “Top 3 objections you hear”
* Keyword tracking in support tickets

💬 **Real conversations** are often more valuable than any survey.

# 🧠 4. Website and Search Behavior Analysis (Free or Very Low Cost)

Tools like:

* **Google Search Console** (what people are searching when they find you)
* **Hotjar / Microsoft Clarity** (user session recordings and heatmaps — free tiers available)
* **AnswerThePublic** (finds real user questions in search)

🔎 **What it shows:**

* What people *think* they want vs. what they *actually* do
* Barriers and confusion points in real-time

# 🧠 5. Competitor Content Comment Mining

Scope out:

* Blog post comments
* YouTube video comments
* Instagram and Facebook post replies from your competitors

📖 **What to notice:**

* ""I wish you would..."" = unmet needs
* ""This helped me..."" = emotional wins
* Frequent FAQs = content ideas and positioning angles

# 🧠 6. DIY Micro-Polls and Quick “Pulse Checks”

If you have any social media presence:

* Instagram polls
* LinkedIn one-question polls
* Twitter/X polls

✅ They’re fast, casual, and super low pressure — people love tapping a button.

# 🧠 7. Pre-Sell Campaigns to Test Demand

Test marketing ideas *before* you build anything:

* Set up a landing page
* Run $50 worth of targeted Facebook/Instagram ads
* Track sign-ups or interest

📈 **Key Insight:**  
Real intent to buy > hypothetical survey answers every time.

# ✨ Big Summary:

1kmygeo,https://www.reddit.com/r/chubbytravel/comments/1kmygeo/the_boca_raton_review/,The Boca Raton Review,"We stayed at the Bungalows at The Boca Raton, which are long term or family style apartments part  of their property, which is sprawling, active and quite beautiful overall. 

Going into this trip, I have heard that the on property was food left things to be desired, but I was left extremely impressed with the offerings. 

The good:

I find at luxury resorts, that sometimes the staff is very helpful but you can tell that they have no interest in being there. This wasn’t the case at all, every single person but one seemed that they enjoyed working there. I’ll cut her some slack because she seemed to have a tough job. (Check-in person at the Bungalows) 

The breakfast was some of the most delicious and well rounded menus I’ve seen in a long time, there are 2 on property locations for breakfast, Sadelle’s and one located at the beach front, we didn’t go there, but it had Mediterranean influence, it looked good but logistics didn’t make sense.

The French toast was great, my mother loved the whitefish on bagel, the coffee left things to be desired, but very minor.

It was super easy to sit down, except for Mother’s Day brunch on Sunday, it was about a 45 minute wait for breakfast, and the members at the Boca Raton made sure to know they were supposed to sit first. I find a lot of these Miami/south florida resorts are full of entitled assholes (Setai, Faena, ritz key biscayne), but besides Mother’s Day breakfast, I found most guests at this resort unoffensive. In my opinion, it’s Mother’s Day, have some grace. It’s gonna be slow.

The Japanese restaurant and the Greek restaurant on property were quite delicious. I have heard the food here was bad, but the Toro roll at the Japanese Bocce Club (a part of the Carbone restaurant chain) was one of the best rolls I’ve had globally. A big pet peeve I have is when seaweed is chewy in maki rolls and their had the right amount of pull and snap. Well done.

Their poolside service was superb, one of the best I’ve had at any resort in recent history, with great rapport and staff that went above and beyond.

The isolation between the adults only and children’s pool was enforced well without question.

They have a large water park style slides which were not being used by most children since the limit was 48 inches, so I found myself on it a few times with my parents, a really fun memory and lots of laughs.

The poolside food was great and relatively well priced. This resort is “no tipping” which is nice, but that means 20% service charge on everything.

They have a main bar that was able to make a great cocktail and was offered warm cheese puffs. 


The bad:

This first one is very subjective, and I should have done more research but it is not a walkable resort. I probably should put this more in an information section, but you have to wait for shuttles or walk 20+ minutes to each part of the resort. They are on time and really easy to use though.


If you want seats during the week at the adult pool, you need to be there by 9am on weekends and 11am on weekdays. I found this annoying, I like to workout before breakfast, but it doesn’t work that well here with my schedule. 

The gym left much to be desired, it was slammed and full of members who felt very entitled to be assholes. I’m surprised this was the case, if I was them, I’d create a 20k square foot gym and make it the focal point of the resort. It was fine, don’t expect much.


The beach set up was confusing, they have no markings but the beach has suite only locations, member only locations and anyone else locations. It’s fine, but it made us feel lost and confused on where to go. Just strange they haven’t addressed it.
Seen many reviews like this.

The last part of the review leaves a bad taste in my mouth but I’ve heard worse, the resort takes 50% of the service charge so the staff effectively gets a 10% tip if you don’t add supplementary tip. Which I find ludicrous. Just something to note.

I go by pant size and I'm one size back to fitting my skinny pants. More than that, I feel great! My mind is clearer. I feel lighter. Im less grouchy. My eyes see better. After my inflammation went down, I started working out again: pilates, ballet, rebounding (mini trampoline), and today I went on a 1 hour walk. No worries, I don't do them all. I listen to my body and see what I can do. I'm only hungry on my way home from work bec that when I would my 1 meal of the day. I smell my husband's food and just appreciate it, but I'm not craving. I only felt weak on my 6th day but it felt more like sleepiness bec I overslept. No dizziness and it went away when I got busy. 

I read the note about electrolytes on this sub and follow it. I also put 3/4 tsp of organic lemon juice, 1/2 ACV, a Sprinkle of cinnamon and cayenne pepper, and electrolyte powder in my 37 oz water bottle. I drink 2 of those throughout the day, drink a cup of coffee in the morning and a mug of herbal tea at night. I also treat myself to lemon fizzy water with a few drops of stevia. 

For nearly 3 years, I've done 20:4 to 16:8 most days but the last few months I started stress eating terrible food. Being Filipino, I grew up eating lots of rice and starchy carbs and I'm addicted. It became all I could think about. My thoughtful eating was replaced by aimless stuffing my face. I kept eating even after I was full. My last blood work showed I was back to being prediabetic.That's why I'm fasting. I want NOT to be a slave to food. I'm aiming to lose most of my visceral fat, have energy, and a clearer mind.

I'm aiming for 14 days. I have a refeeding plan ready. But, on the 14th day, if I feel as great as I have these past few days, should I keep going? How can you tell if you can go for longer? What are the signs that you can't go longer?

My mom and I have had a complex dynamic to say the least. She never wanted to have kids (she has 5 so that’s been a confusing message). She blames my father for having so many kids. She has told me many times she didn’t want kids, we ruined her life and she hoped I wouldn’t have kids either. 

When I was 14 she told me my father raped her and she got pregnant and she felt like she had to marry him. She said all of us are the product of rape. She told me this while we were out at dinner. Really loved that this is when and how she chose to share this. Plot twist, it’s not true. But at the time, I believed my mom, I felt I had to be there for her. I also felt fucking awful for being alive. 

There are a lot of other things I could say, but it’s a lot of typical emotional and physical neglect, abandonment, etc. I didn’t have a bad childhood per se. Others have had much worse. I’m not trying to complain, just provide context. 

Fast forward many years - I’m an Aunt (a cool aunt) and a mother. Those kids… damnit those kids, my kids and my nieces… they’re fucking amazing. They changed everything. It was at this time that the lights began to flicker in my head.… A lot of shit has happened and this is already so long I don’t want to nor can I cover it all, but where things really went off the rails was maybe 2-3 years ago. I yelled at her for being a shit grandma. She never called my kids or my nieces on their birthdays. She didn’t even know their birthdays. I called her every week like a dutiful daughter and that day - I just couldn’t take it anymore. She had never visited any of her grandkids. Ever. My nieces are in their 20’s so she’s had some time. And she travels for vacation so it’s not a fear of travel.  I yelled at my mom. I probably called her an evil bitch, I can’t remember, but I felt good about it. My kids always wondered why their grandma didn’t talk to them and fuck her for making them question their worth. 

I was kind of done at this point, but like an idiot, I’m super forgiving. Also, my dad died right after my oldest was born and I still miss him everyday. I know he would have wanted me to try and fix things. So I called on her birthday. She didn’t call on mine. Or on Christmas. Or my kids birthdays. But fuck it, I called on Mother’s Day. Told her I loved her and we wanted to come visit. The boys miss her. She tells me my brother doesn’t talk to her anymore. I know my sister rarely does. I felt sad for her. She tells me she loves me and we hang up. I felt hope that we could find some peace. And maybe forgiveness. Gentle reminder - I’m an optimistic idiot. 

Today she calls while I’m at work. I leave a mtg to meet bc I’m worried something has happened.  She said ‘I know you’re at work and I have to bother you, but I never want to see you ever again.  You live so far away (6hr drive which isn’t far I mumble), she says she doesn’t like that I’m always mad at her and she worked for 50 years (I mumble that all of us have to work for most of our lives) and she just doesn’t care. She never wants to visit anyone, her back hurts and she doesn’t want to see me. And if I just show up at her house she will call her lawyer’. At this point I’m stunned. I stumble into an empty meeting room to let her finish. I actually hung up on her before the end.  And I cried. I’ve been crying since. 

And I keep wondering… did I do this? Did I fuck up? How does someone’s own mother not love them? The one love we all should be able to count on is our mother’s love, right? My self worth has been shit because of this lady. And I’m so upset that I’m sad. I’m upset that I didn’t say ‘why the fuck would I just show up at your house? Have I ever done anything like that in my life? And let’s not pretend you have a lawyer on speed dial. You couldn’t even call the cable company, I had to do it for you. Also… what a fucking crazy thing to say and why would you call during the work day?’ I mean she does like to tell me awful things at the most awful times and normally in public so I shouldn’t be surprised by the timing. 

Im so so terrified I’ll end up like her. I just don’t understand. And at my core I’m terrified that it’s me. That there is something so fundamentally unlovable about me that even my own mother can’t love me. I know logically it’s not me, that she is a troubled soul, but fuck…. My heart has a hard time embracing that. I struggle with it bc of how much I love my kids. 

Wow that was long and if anyone actually made it all the way through my ramblings, I owe you a coffee or tea or wine. I don’t know anyone who has a parent like this… it sucks. As much as I don’t like her, it still cuts so deep. ",15,1747278673.0,entitledparents,8,0.89,False

1kmy02d,https://www.reddit.com/r/deepnightsociety/comments/1kmy02d/echoes_part_1/,Echoes (Part 1),"Me and some compatriots are studying the night sky and trying to find out what lies beyond our universe. We just recently had a new telescope built on a very small remote island in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean named Otok—well, at least that's what we call it. Not sure if it has a real name. Not a big island, only a few buildings for the inhabitants—me and three other coworkers: Atlas, Leo, and Luna.

Luna: ""Are you gonna write in that journal all day or are you gonna actually do some work?""

Me: ""Oh, like you're doing—sitting over there watching YouTube videos and eating chips. Hahaha.""

Luna: ""Hey, come on now. Ain't much else I can do. Atlas is always hogging the scope nowadays.""

Atlas: ""I just feel like there's an area in the void that we’re missing. This new telescope is supposed to be ten times stronger than the Hubble, and it still seems to show complete black. How can a void truly be that dark?""

Leo: ""Well, it seems to be a pocket that never had anything develop in it. So as the universe expands, the void just gets bigger and bigger.""

Atlas: ""It just doesn't feel right. It’s like something in the back of my mind keeps telling me to scan it.""

Me: ""Why don't you give it a break for the night and let Luna or me look? A fresh set of eyes never hurt.""

Atlas: ""Yeah, you're probably right. I'm gonna go get a snack and maybe take a nap.""

Luna excitedly jumps up and runs over. ""Finally, some time alone with my new baby.""

She slid into the chair, cracked her knuckles, and brought the telescope controls up on screen. I was still scribbling in my journal when I noticed her pause.

She leaned forward, head tilted like she was trying to catch something just out of range.

“…Did you hear that?” she asked softly.

I looked up. ""Hear what?""

She scanned the room—just us, the quiet hum of the electronics.

“It sounded like… a whisper. Faint. Came from the headset, I think, but we’ve got all the mics muted, right?”

“Yeah, everything’s off.”

She gave a nervous chuckle. “Weird. Probably just interference or something.”

But the way her hands lingered over the controls, stiff and hesitant, said she didn’t believe that. She stayed quiet after that, hyperfocused—eyes flicking across the void on the screen like she expected something to blink back.

Luna: ""Hey, will you come here for a second?""

Me: ""Of course, what’s up?""

Luna: ""Look at the screen. Does it look like a very dim star right in the area Atlas has been looking?""

I rubbed my finger on the screen to make sure it wasn’t dust.
Me: ""Yeah… it does.""

Luna: ""But does it seem like it’s blinking to you?""

Me: ""Oddly, yes. I’d say it’s the atmosphere of Earth, but the actual telescope is floating above Earth's atmosphere. We’re peering into it—and it’s peering into the void currently.""

Luna: ""It seems as if it is a code of some sort. It keeps flashing the same way in odd intervals.""

Leo: ""You guys know how much I love a puzzle. Let me come sit and watch it, and I’ll see if I can't figure it out.""

Luna: ""Be my guest, Einstein. Hahaha.""

Leo walks over, sits down, and starts writing out the flickers as he sees them.

Leo: ""This is gonna take a few hours. Y’all can go do whatever you need to for the moment.""

Every morning before the sun rises, we all usually grab ourselves some coffee and hike through the jungle side of the island to sit on the pink sand beach and watch the sunrise together. As we walked:

Atlas: ""Doesn't everything seem more quiet to you?""

Luna: ""Now that you mention it… I haven’t seen one of our daily creatures.""

Me: ""Yeah, I haven't even heard a leaf rustle. It’s way too quiet.""

Atlas: ""Must have just heard Luna's loud mouth this morning.""

Luna: ""Ha ha ha, very funny, dick. I think you're just mad I found something in your void and you didn’t.""
She sticks her tongue out at Atlas playfully.

We walked through a wall of dense forestry and out onto the beach into the most beautiful sunrise. We sat down to soak it in. That’s when my phone rang. I looked down—it was Leo.

Leo (on the phone): ""Hey guys. When you get the chance, I need you to come by the telescope. It’s rather important.""

I relayed the message and we rushed back. But we took note that everything felt almost normal now—the wildlife was back, but still skittish, like we were radioactive. Maybe it was just too early before.

When we returned, Leo looked pale—like he’d seen his grandmother’s ghost. He looked shaken up.

Atlas: ""What did you find, Leo?""

Leo: ""I just need you to look at the paper I used to decipher the message. And… don’t say anything out loud.""

We all leaned in and read the Morse code:

> -.. --- / -. --- - / .-. . ... .--. --- -. -.. .-.-.- / - .... . -.-- / .-- .. .-.. .-.. / .... . .- .-. / -.-- --- ..- .-.-.- / -.-- --- ..- .----. .-. . / -. --- - / .- .-.. --- -. . / --- -. / -.-- --- ..- .-. / .--. .-.. .- -. . - --..-- / --- .-. / - .... . / .. ... .-.. .- -. -.. .-.-.-

We all stared at the message, silence thick like wet cement.

Atlas: ""I have no idea what this means.""

Luna: ""It means you should have paid attention in college.""

Me: ""Luna, quit messing with Atlas. This is serious.""

Leo hadn’t said a word since handing us the note. He was still staring—upward.

Me: ""Leo?""

He finally spoke, his voice barely audible. “I heard it too.”

I frowned. “What?”

He looked at me with wide eyes, like a child describing a nightmare.
“The whisper,” he said. “Right after you guys left.”

Atlas: “Like what Luna heard earlier?”

Leo gave a slow, terrified nod. “It said my name.” And handed us the paper with the translation on it

Sometimes I imagine a future where there's no government, no borders, no money, no gender roles, no war, no countries- just pure freedom and equality. Everyone has what they need. No one works just to survive. Basic needs? Already taken care of food, shelter, health- completely handled by AI.

It's like true communism. I mean a new level AI-run, peaceful, fair. No power games. No one dominating others. Just people living because they want to live, not because they have to survive.

In that world, people work on their passions, not paychecks. One person might explore black holes, someone else might paint full-time, another just wants to grow plants or raise animals or build new tech. Everyone contributes what they love doing, not what they’re forced to do.

I seriously believe AI could make this real someday. Like, it could manage resources better than any human system. No bias, no greed, just logic and fairness. And with tech evolving so fast, maybe we’re not that far.

Is this just me dreaming too hard? Or do other ENTPs feel this too?

Like…

What if AI is the key to that kind of world?

What if we’re meant to explore the universe, not just pay bills until we die (optional)?

Are we visionaries- or just rebellious optimists with wild imagination🤔?

1kmxvaz,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineGrowthPlaybook/comments/1kmxvaz/95_of_buying_decisions_are_emotional_is_your/,95% of Buying Decisions Are Emotional. Is Your Brand Tapping Into That?,"Branding is far more than a logo or slogan—it’s about creating an emotional connection with consumers. Here's how psychology drives purchasing decisions and builds loyal customers.

# 1. Emotions Drive 95% of Purchasing Decisions

* **Why it matters:** Research shows that the majority of purchasing decisions are made subconsciously, driven more by emotions than logic.
* **Example:** Apple taps into emotions like trust and excitement, connecting customers to innovation and status.

# 2. Emotional Branding Creates Loyalty

* **Why it matters:** Successful brands use emotions to trigger deep connections, fostering brand loyalty.
* **Example:** Innocent Drinks uses humor and trust to create a positive, refreshing brand experience.

# 3. Brands Create Experiences, Not Just Products

* **Why it matters:** Brands like Nike, Apple, and Dove go beyond selling products; they sell an emotional experience.
* **Example:** Dove's ""Real Beauty"" campaign shifted beauty standards, connecting with consumers on a deeper level of authenticity.

# 4. The Power of Identity in Branding

* **Why it matters:** Brands that align with a consumer's identity, values, or aspirations create stronger emotional bonds.
* **Example:** Gymshark aligns with fitness enthusiasts' desire for strength and self-improvement, making their brand a lifestyle choice.

# 5. Consumers Don’t Buy Products, They Buy Feelings

* **Why it matters:** Consumers often purchase based on emotional needs like belonging, trust, and aspiration.
* **Example:** Patagonia's environmental activism resonates with eco-conscious buyers, aligning with their values.

# 6. Emotional Triggers Lead to Purchases

* **Why it matters:** Brands that successfully trigger emotions like joy, trust, and urgency can increase conversions and create lasting connections.
* **Example:** Coca-Cola’s ads tap into joy and family connection, making their brand synonymous with happiness.

# 7. Trust Builds Long-Term Loyalty

* **Why it matters:** Trust is a core emotional trigger in branding, which helps reduce consumer anxiety and builds brand loyalty.
* **Example:** Apple builds trust with its sleek design and focus on privacy, making their devices feel safe and reliable.

# 8. The Mere Exposure Effect: Familiarity Breeds Trust

* **Why it matters:** People tend to trust and choose brands they’ve been exposed to repeatedly.
* **Example:** McDonald's golden arches are globally recognized, and repeated exposure helps consumers feel familiar and secure with the brand.

# 9. Brand Consistency Reinforces Trust

* **Why it matters:** Consistency in branding—whether in messaging, design, or customer experience—helps reinforce reliability and builds emotional security.
* **Example:** Starbucks maintains the same coffee quality and store experience worldwide, which fosters long-term loyalty.

# 10. Branding Mistakes Can Have Major Consequences

* **Why it matters:** Failing to align with your core audience or sending mixed messages can lead to losing trust and sales.
* **Example:** Bud Light’s failed attempt to reposition its brand led to significant backlash, loss of customers, and a drop in sales.

# Final Thoughts: Branding Is a Journey, Not a Sprint

Creating a powerful brand is a long-term commitment. By tapping into emotions, aligning with your audience’s values, and being consistent, you can build a brand that’s recognized, trusted, and loved.

On my second day I noticed my ex of 3 years was there waiting on a drink. This surprised me, as last I knew she was still working in our hometown. I asked around to my new coworkers, and sure enough, she's a regular. Literally works a few buildings over. 

This woman destroyed my life. She is manipulative, hateful, and extremely passive aggressive. I faced much emotional distress and trauma during our time together (which I only found out was abuse after starting therapy....) it has been about 3.5 years since we broke up, and we haven't seen each other since. It was a very rough breakup on my end, and I'm still going to therapy every other week to improve and heal from the damage. 


Today, she placed a mobile order, I saw her name come up and told my co-workers I'd prefer if they could handle her orders. At the end of my shift I decided to leave her a note on her car setting some boundaries about contact. I ran the note passed my manager, and they agreed it was civil and fair. 


For context it said:
Ex's name,
As you may have noticed I have started working at coffee shop.
To maintain boundaries, please only mobile order from now on.
This will allow us to avoid contact.
With love,
Your favorite ex <3

(Yes the sign off is a bit passive aggressive, I'm aware. I thought it was cheeky but not mean...)


The problem is, she got a new car, I didn't know which was hers. I don't know why I didn't just give up, but I thought ""I'll just leave it at the desk of her job, they can deliver it to her, and all will be well."" So I walk in and boom she's sitting at the front desk. I just plop the note in front of her, walk out, and drive home. 

By the time I get home my manager texts me and said ex had called the store and asked to speak to a manager about why she was banned from the store. No where did I say she was banned. I just asked her to please only place mobile orders so I can anticipate her arrival and plan accordingly with staff. 

Now it has caused a lot of drama, my manager is upset, and I'm worried that my ex is out to ruin my new position out of spite. 

Am I in the wrong for trying to set this boundary? Did I fuck up by giving her the note? Or is this her manipulating the situation to her advantage once again to frame me as a bad person to my new job? 

Also I'm autistic and it's hard for me to understand when I'm crossing a line. Maybe this is all my fault. 

Thanks in advance.


Edit: it's clear I'm in the wrong. You are all being very hostile to me which feels unjustified. I thought I was responsibly setting a boundary but it's clear I overstepped. Please give me some grace, this has stirred up a lot of trauma and has been very hard for me. I'm just a girl, maybe an idiot, but I meant no foul play.

Edit 2: have none of you been in abusive relationships? Do you not realize how much damage is done? You can say I'm in the wrong without being so mean.",1,1747277621.0,AmIOverreacting,34,1.0,False

1kmxplj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee_Shop/comments/1kmxplj/megathread_were_launching_a_fund_that_backs/,"Megathread] We’re launching a fund that backs independent coffee shop owners — today’s the last day to apply. AMA, feedback, ideas welcome.","TL;DR A transparent share on how we support and fund early-stage coffee shop owners.

At Coffee Futures Fund, we are building a village that brings the entire ecosystem of capital, mentorship and community to support early stage coffee shop owners. 
 
Most startup accelerators are built for tech bros. Most small business loans come too late or with too many strings. And the indie coffee world? It’s full of passion, but rarely funded or supported that is why 6 out of 10 shops don’t survive after five years. 

We thought -- what if we built an ecosystem custom-designed for coffee shop owners? One where mentorship, storytelling, and funding *actually reflect the values of the café world.*

So we started CFF. We’ve bootstrapped it so far with a small team and a big belief:  
That the future of coffee is local, community-led, and creatively financed.

We're not a big VC or some corporate-backed incubator. We're coffee owners who have been there; done that — and we’re trying to build something that we wish we had when we started. We bring combined experience of 100+ years in the coffee space. 

🧵 Here’s what this post is:
- A behind-the-scenes look at the 10-week program
- A transparent share on how we support and fund coffee founders
- A final open invite to apply (today’s the last day)
- Mostly: an open thread to talk shop with this community

---

###  What is Coffee Futures Fund?

CFF is a 10-week program for emerging coffee entrepreneurs — especially early stage US coffee owners (1-3 years old) — who want to build something of their own.

We:
- Help you clarify your concept, customer strategy, pricing & ops
- Connect you with mentors (operators, roasters, founders)
- Provide up to 50K funding to selected applicants
- Do it all in a cohort model so you’re not alone

The goal? Help more independent coffee shops succeed long-term.

Applications close tomorrow (midnight PT):  [coffeefutures.fund](https://www.coffeefutures.fund)

---

### 💬 Why post here?

Because this is *where the coffee brains are.* Reddit’s full of baristas, owners, roasters, dreamers, skeptics, and operators who love the craft *and* understand the grind of the business.

If you:
- Run a shop already and want to scale
- Want to understand how we’re funding this
- Just want to tell us what you think we should be doing

Then hit reply. We’re listening.

Ask us *anything*. Or roast us. That’s fair game too.

1kmxoys,https://www.reddit.com/r/AchillesRupture/comments/1kmxoys/just_started_walking_a_week_ago/,Just started walking a week ago,"Non op. Was full weight bear in the boot (15 weeks it was removed). I am able to do 5 min increments and increase as tolerated  (since last Wed) per the doctor. 

I’ve been basically not wearing the boot in my house. If I rest beforehand for 15 mins, then I will walk to/from the bus stop for the kids (7 min round trip). 
Today it’s pretty swollen and sore. Am I overdoing it? I don’t walk constantly but I do have kids so I’m up and down when they’re home. 
In the day I work from home so not a ton of walking aside to bathroom or kitchen for coffee etc.  (minimal stairs in my day). 
I am wearing runners inside, as that is the most comfortable but by the evening when I finally get to relax I’m putting my slippers on (solid and comfy sole). 

My physio was impressed with my movement and strength the day after the boot came off (my first appt). And said I could certainly do longer than five mins. 

I remember someone saying pain/swelling pretty normal for a while?? It is pretty sore today. I do NOT want to overdo it. I’ve come too far! 

I have physio again Friday and will ask then, just wanted to hear other experiences once you were given some freedom?

Standup shower and driving has been amazing 🤣🤣

Shoes:
I bought a pair of Skechers running shoes on clearance and they were so comfortable so I bought another pair to wear inside. My doctor said any shoe would do basically and when I tried on the one shoe it was so comfortable. So happy with them! 

And lastly random question: When you were able to walk w two feet did your doctor tell you to lead with your injured foot or the other one when going downstairs? My doctor and physio said opposite things 🤣.  So was just curious !

1kmxmom,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1kmxmom/5_years_of_ibs_heres_what_happened/,5 years of IBS… Here’s what happened,"I’m mostly writing this post because ranting about my IBS issues eases my anxiety, which in turn, eases my IBS. Love the gut-brain connection. 

I got IBS 5 years ago after an entire day of hiking (with minimal water) and then scarfing down Korean fried chicken and a few soju bombs. That night while I was on the porcelain throne, I had experienced the worst cramps and stomach pains of my life. It was so bad I almost fainted and was getting light headed. Basically, those poor decisions backed me up so bad and altered my GI track. 

Next day I thought I was fine, but every time I would eat I would get those awful cramps and sit on the toilet for long periods of time. This cycle of eating and immediately being in pain persisted for months. It got to the point where at times I was bed ridden, sobbing my eyes out. This was all while I was finishing up my MA in college, so I had even worse anxiety when I was on location for my internship, then when I would get home I would crash and all the IBS symptoms would appear. 

It got to the point where I was too scared to eat so I would starve myself which ended up putting me in even more pain and making my IBS worse. 

During that time I saw my doctor who recommended me Metamucil and and improved diet, and it helped for a little, but I was still always so backed up and the cramps kept hitting at random. I began doing my own research and came across IBS, and man it sounded exactly like what I had. The next doc appt I finally asked if he could refer me to a gastroenterologist. He did, and I booked that appointment so fast. 

I had to wait 2 more months for that doctors visit, and when I finally got there and she told me I had IBS-M, I broke down crying in the office because finally I had an official diagnosis of what was wrong with me. After that she referred me to a dietitian who helped me through the elimination diet, which took many more months. I took my sweet time with it because my relationship with food had deteriorated so much that I was terrified to try anything. Found out my main triggers were apples, garlic, beef, coffee, spicy foods, and a few others and I started to cut out sugar, gluten and dairy (as much as I could, I still indulge here and there). 

While it really helped, the elimination diet was PAINFUL. I started with garlic (I know, idk why I did that) and I was so confident that I could eat 1/2 a clove… until the cramps began. No more garlic for me :( I also had to try and get through 1/2 cup of beans in a day. I couldn’t do it, not that it was a trigger, it was just too many beans. 

Things started looking up after that, I was more confident in what I could do/try though it did take me a year to begin reincorporating non-low fodmap foods into my diet again. Since then I’ve rekindled my relationship with food and stocked up on IBGuard, Imodium, Citrucel tablets, and all the other things I needed for emergencies. 

Right now I’m laying in bed with an upset stomach because I ate some red bell pepper and it’s not sitting well with me at all :) but now I know I need to stay away from red bell peppers because they’re probably a trigger. 

My IBS journey sucked and I would never wish that kind of internal pain on even my worst enemy. That feeling of helplessness I felt for 6 months (because I had no idea what was going on) traumatized me. Even 5 years later I’m still identifying triggers and slowly mending my relationship with food. I’m just happy that recovery is going okay. 

Anyways, hope my story helped. Or at least was entertaining. ",11,1747277063.0,ibs,1,0.93,False
1kmxmnj,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndai/comments/1kmxmnj/a_fun_magic_item_the_everfull_mug_of_ale/,A Fun magic item - The Everfull Mug of 'Ale'.,"https://imgur.com/a/jqdxwus

**The Everfull Mug of ""Ale""**

XP Value: 400 | GP Value: 1,500

Powers:

• Endless liquid—but the drink changes each time:
Roll 1d6: 1) Ale, 2) Water, 3) Vinegar, 4) Liquid Cheese (See table below), 5) Spiders (harmless), 6) The DM’s Choice (See table below),.

• 1/day: The mug compliments the drinker in a fake dwarven accent.

Lore: Commissioned by a gnome tavern-keep to ""save on costs."" Now banned in three cities.

Curse: After 10 uses, the mug falls in love with the drinker and writes bad poetry. (Notes appear in mug at random intervals, hopefully not while you are drinking from it.)

**Random Liquid Cheese Chart (1d10):**
When the Everfull Mug produces Liquid Cheese, roll to determine what unholy dairy (or dairy-like) substance pours forth:

1. Glorious Gouda Gold – Rich, buttery, and perfectly melty. Ideal for dipping bread. The mug sighs happily.
2. Bubbling Cheddar Fondue – Sharp, tangy, and inexplicably stays warm. No one questions it.
3. Mystery Inn Cheese Soup – Probably safe. Probably. Tastes like nostalgia and questionable decisions.
4. Blue Cheese Slurry – Bold, pungent, and aggressively lumpy. The mug coughs apologetically.
5. ""Cheese"" from the Wizard’s Lunchbox – Vaguely cheesy, slightly glowing. Grants +1 to Arcana checks (and -1 to Constitution saves).
6. Ratfolk ""Artisanal"" Spread – Smells like a cellar. Tastes like regret. The mug mutters, ""Look, it’s technically cheese.""
7. Spectral Swiss – Full of holes. Literally. Drips through solid surfaces if not consumed quickly.
8. Gelatinous Cube Cheese – Translucent, jiggly, and mildly carnivorous. The mug warns, ""Don’t let it touch your fingers.""
9. Stink Hag’s Toe Curd – The smell alone requires a CON save (DC 12) to avoid vomiting. The mug giggles.
10. The Cheese That Should Not Be – It whispers. It watches. The mug screams and flips itself over to stop the flow.

Optional Rule: If a player drinks #10, they gain a temporary madness (per DMG) and an irrational fear of dairy.

*DM’s Choice Liquid Table (1d20 or choose)*

Roll to determine what eldritch, nonsensical, or mildly cursed beverage pours forth this time.

1. Sentient Gravy – It whispers compliments (""Mmm, yes, pour me on those potatoes"") and gets offended if wasted.
2. Liquid Lute – Drinkable music. Causes the consumer to hum uncontrollably for 1d4 hours.
3. Dwarven Beard Oil – Not technically a drink, but the mug insists it’s ""fortifying."" Grants +1 to Charisma (Persuasion) vs. dwarves.
4. Mimic Spit – Sticky, vaguely metallic, and deeply unsettling. The mug shudders.
5. Reverse Wine – Starts as vinegar, but the more you drink, the sweeter it gets. Confuses sommeliers.
6. Gnomish ""Coffee"" – 90% sugar, 10% lightning. Consumer’s hair stands on end for an hour.
7. The DM’s Tears – Salty. Occasionally prophetic. The mug murmurs, ""Rocks fall, everyone cries.""
8. Polymorph Punch – Turns the drinker’s teeth a random color for 24 hours. No other effect.
9. Invisible Soup – It’s definitely there. You can feel it. The mug insists it’s ""delicious.""
10. Molten Candy – Scalding hot, but tastes like birthday cake. CON save (DC 12) or take 1 fire damage.
11. Echo Water – Repeats the last thing said near it when swallowed. ""Wait, did I just drink my own voice?""
12. Bubblegum Mead – Non-Newtonian. Chewy when sipped, liquid when chewed. The mug finds this hilarious.
13. Antimatter Ale – Pours normally but vanishes the moment it touches a surface. The mug claims it was ""perfectly good.""
14. Spectral Milk – Glows faintly. Cats stare at it intently, even if no cats are present.
15. The Forbidden Smoothie – Ingredients unknown. Smells like a wizard’s laundry. CON save (DC 15) or hallucinate tiny dancing goblins.

17. Liquid Deja Vu – The drinker feels like they’ve had this before. Because they have.
18. The DM’s Backup Plot – A swirling, ink-like substance. Drinking it grants +1 to Insight (you briefly understand the campaign).
19. Mimic’s Revenge – Looks like ale. Tastes like ale. Is actually ale. The mug is very disappointed in you for suspecting otherwise.
20. The Void – The mug pours nothing. Absolutely nothing. Not even air. The drinker’s mouth feels wrong for an hour.

Just want to state I’ve never been diagnosed with anything before. I just am curious if there’s others with anything similar.

So when I eat something too fast, I will get really bad cramps (like I just got the stomach bug) and will have to run to the bathroom and I get explosive diahrea, I sweat, get cold and my cramps are so bad it feels like I’m about to give birth. Basically feels like the stomach flu. 

I’ve noticed it’s always just when I eat too fast. Like today at work I didn’t eat any breakfast, so I was starving near lunch and ate a protein bar very fast before the gym. Then an hour later terrible cramps and I had to run to bathroom twice and it was just pure liquid and bad cramps. 

The week before I ate two boiled eggs fast (I wasn’t even that hungry) I just wanted to make sure I got protein and I had the worst stomach cramps and diahrea. 

In the past I’ve also gotten it from drinking large iced coffee too fast.

A recent “discussion” regarding the many Bunnahabhain 12 reviews and comments made over the years suggesting that B12 & B18 were mildly peated prompted me to revisit a bottle of the 12 year old bottled in 2022 to see if I could better understand it’s profile. I paid much more attention when enjoying a dram this time.

A very cogent case was made for tannins found in a particular type of oak barrels sometimes used by Bunnahabhain being the “culprit” for the earthy, woodsy or dirty note that many mistake for peat when describing the nonpeated B12 & B18.  

So, here are my notes. Please beadvised that my nose doesn’t pick up as many notes as my palate. It’s hard enough breathing through it let alone using it to explore scotch.

Nose: Sherry and a hint of strawberry twizzlers candy. (at least I didn’t consume all that red dye)

Palate: Thick, oily mouth feel. Shows earthy dry straw mixed with earthy coffee grounds dusted with powdered chocolate followed by sherry and some sour cherry that was somewhat astringent. A hint of burnt paper floated by. There is a little vanilla floating in and out as well. The profile evolved into a slightly astringent mix of sour, dirty sherry and over-baked cookie dough. There is a slight alcohol nip I find common in younger whisky. The hint of burnt paper was the biggest surprise.

Finish: looong. I can still taste the sherry mixture an hour later.

The Bunnahabhain 12 is very good and well made. It is one of the few 12 year olds I drink ( I prefer older whisky) because the profile is interesting and quite different from most 12 year olds.  A side note, I just broke down and bought a Glendronach 12  to try (I enjoy the 15 & 18) and, as I feared, it‘s not very compelling.

So, in summary, a very well made non peated whisky exhibiting a very interesting flavor profile that wants to trick you into thinking it is slightly peated. You get your money’s worth out of this one.

Enjoy

* **Holding Space Without Judgment:** A friend of ours was unraveling after a breakup. One night, my husband sat beside him while he cried. No advice, no reassurance, just quiet presence. Later, our friend said it was the first time he didn’t feel like he had to perform strength. That night, silence was the kindest thing my husband could offer.
* **Carrying the Mental Load:** When my cousin was in the hospital, a family friend showed up every day. He never asked what we needed. He didn’t hover or offer to help. He just sat in the waiting room, reading and sipping coffee. For days, he did nothing. And then, suddenly, we needed someone to rush documents to the doctor. He was there, because he’d always been there.
* **Creating Safe Spaces for Vulnerability:** At a work lunch, someone quietly admitted they were having a hard time. Not dramatically, just honestly. That small act of openness shifted something.

My mother has been in the facility for one week. Understandably her sense of time is skewed because she went to the hospital first and then straight to rehab. She hasn’t been home for 15 days now, but it feels like 3-4 weeks to her. I understand that. Anyway, spoke to her earlier and she wants to come home this coming Monday and she wants to speak to the social worker at the facility about it. I think Monday sounds too soon and no one has given a report to me yet about how her physical therapy is going. I know she’s doing better though because she looks and sounds better. It’s my understanding at the minimum that about 3 weeks of pt is necessary to build up her strength and see where’s she’s at. So I arrive at the facility, give my mom her coffee and dessert and tell her I’m going to introduce myself to the social worker. She says okay. I really like the social worker. I asked her if she could tell me where we were at with my mother’s therapy and I had a couple of questions about my mother’s insurance also. Unfortunately she was unable to pull up my mother’s notes at that moment, but she explained how my mother’s insurance worked and that she would go visit my mother tomorrow and discuss therapy and how the release process worked. So I feel much better. Then I get back to my mother’s room and the first thing she says to me is, you better not have been trash talking me to the social worker. So instead of explaining myself to her, I just said okay well I’ve brought you your stuff and I’m going to just go now because I’m not explaining my discussion and I’m not arguing. It’s occurred to me that she just is not going to listen to me. She doesn’t completely trust me. She still thinks I’m the child and she’s the adult. She’ll listen to the facility though. So I’m stepping back and leaving everything else in the hands of the facility and to God through prayer. I’m tired now and just don’t care as much. She’s not going to keep making me feel bad for trying to do what’s best for her because I love her. No crying this time, no tears. She can learn to just accept her situation.

1kmx86v,https://www.reddit.com/r/SumaMethod/comments/1kmx86v/daily_practices_for_wellbeing_in_recovery/,Daily Practices for Wellbeing in Recovery,"*Because staying well is more than staying clean.*

Recovery is not a single decision—it’s a series of daily choices.  
And those choices aren’t just about avoiding the addictive thing. They’re about building the kind of inner and outer environment that makes returning to yourself possible, sustainable, and safe.

In the Suma Method, recovery isn’t measured by abstinence alone. It’s measured by system coherence. That means every small, consistent action that supports your physical, emotional, relational, intellectual, spiritual, or purpose-based wellbeing is part of your recovery. These practices are not add-ons. They’re infrastructure.

Here are a few core practices that help stabilize the self-system and anchor recovery in daily life:

**1. Grounding the Body (Physical Domain)**  
Drink water before coffee. Stretch before screens. Eat something nourishing before the day devours you.  
Your nervous system is a key player in recovery—treat it like a partner, not an afterthought. Reconnect with your body through sleep, hydration, movement, rest, and pleasure. Not to earn anything, but to *support your own staying.*

**2. Name and Feel Your Emotions (Emotional Domain)**  
Recovery demands emotional literacy. Set aside even five minutes a day to ask: *What am I feeling? What triggered this? What do I need right now?*  
You don’t need to fix your feelings. You just need to stop abandoning them. Journaling, voice memos, or even naming emotions aloud can disrupt old loops and give your feelings somewhere to land.

**3. Tend to Your Thinking (Intellectual Domain)**  
Not all thoughts are true. Not all beliefs are yours.  
A daily mental hygiene practice—like cognitive reframing, writing down distorted thoughts, or practicing mindfulness—helps reduce the noise. The goal isn’t to silence the mind. It’s to become a trustworthy narrator of your own life.

**4. Connect Intentionally (Relational Domain)**  
You don’t need a hundred people. You need a few safe ones.  
Send a check-in text. Join a support space. Let someone know what’s *really* going on. Recovery thrives in relationship, not isolation. If you’re not ready to be vulnerable, start with honesty with yourself—and let connection build from there.

**5. Recenter with Meaning (Spiritual Domain)**  
Recovery is hard. Make sure you remember *why* you’re doing it.  
Whether it’s through meditation, prayer, nature, ritual, or silence, return to something larger than your cravings and stronger than your shame. Spiritual practices don’t require religion. They require *remembrance*.

**6. Reaffirm Your Direction (Purpose Domain)**  
Each day, ask: *What small thing can I do that aligns with the person I’m becoming?*  
It doesn’t have to be world-changing. Write a sentence. Help someone. Do the next kind thing. Recovery isn’t just about who you were. It’s about who you’re building—and what kind of life will be able to hold them.

Daily practices are not glamorous. They are not always exciting. But they are *how the future gets built*.  
One moment of coherence at a time.  
One day of staying with yourself at a time.  
One act of remembrance that says:  
*I’m still here. And I’m still choosing myself.*",1,1747275809.0,SumaMethod,0,1.0,False

Now where I live there's this path that's roughly the width of say about minivan or about the width of SUV, and there's roughly across from this, not sure if it's even a full road, but kind of dirt path. Right across from me my house on the other other side of that pathway  into I guess kind of quazy culdasac are two houses, one directly across from me, right next it is another house, that owned by the most streotypical suburban older woman type ever complete with that kind of very over tanned, sort of 80s plastic tanned look. Omg it is just, wowza. Anyway I  go for walks semi regularly and just came back from suuuper nice one.  Just as I'm heading up some stairs. That person came up to me puffy and yelling ""Sir, Sir, your AC is really annoying me! "" so of course I didn't way any attention and tried to keep going, thinking: what is this person talking about man. ""SIIIIR SIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIR!!"" this older lady, hardly any meat on her bones, way over tanned, was right in my personal space just as was about to close the door, and in fact I tried to when she had a foot in the door way. So I naturally  thought: What do I do, ok? do call the police? do grunt? is it some dire thing?  etc etc. NO! this crazy lady just wanted to tell me how, I've got my AC on and it's somehow bothering her. 

My first instincive thought was: ""ok that's nice, so not wear earplugs or something.""

OOH no she was already going on about how I ""have to"" move the same AC I've owned for ages now and that she had worked it up in her mind that it somehow my up to me to fix this problem and gosh she's got a quite AC. Man it took everything to not just laugh because of just how rediculous, and surreal this whole thing was. And I just wanted some coffee and to get off my feet and take my shoes off, walk for both health (to loose weight.) and for fresh air and touch grass right.

Ok well a week or so past so I thought: well ok maybe the crazy lady moved on or something. NOPE I was coming back and: simillar thing

What this lady didn't know was I had been meaning to try to move the AC to a slightly more better window anyway I just had find a guy that might be able to help  make the right kind of ledge since I just have the tools or knowledge to make nice little ledge to help support the AC in the new window it's currently in. And I did that last friday.

Unknwn to me: this crazy lady had:  been stalking me, us google maps and! as it turns out she's a realestate agent and this is where things go off the rails. She had taken to stalking my family, and harassing them and making vague faux legal threats, citing, citing all kinds of stuff about sound ordininces and how an that exact same window with a few different AC units for at least 20 years or so is now a huge problem, Even though no one that's owned any houses around me has ever complained!

Now from what I understand from family is they and her have some kind of deal.  But they did also make it clear that should she push things it won't end well for her. 

Like what the hell man for a weird compirson: up from about I think 2011ish all the way up to 2020 I had made MORE noise cosplaying as a Klingon as a smal funky little charity event to raise money for cancer research, where the last day of the event on christmas me and a hand full of other people would be up pretty late loudly singing in some key that never matched the right ones in Tarren. And people sure seemed to have a great 'ol time, and when I do Halloween with making a decent racket no one complained about that, I think the construction crews around now and the better parts of summer make more noise than I do.

The AC is a frigidair and it's not that old.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.
