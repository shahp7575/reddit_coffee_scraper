1i2vb1g,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1i2vb1g/how_can_i_m30_address_relationship_problems_with/,How can I (M30) address relationship problems with extremely anxious partner (F30)?,"Do you think I am doing too much in our relationship? How do I talk about my personal issues with our relationship with someone who is in a delicate state of mind?

I (M30) started a relationship with a girl (F30) about two months ago, and I have put a tremendous effort into acts of service and emotional support for her. For context, she works insane hours at a hospital (13 hours/day with occasional 24 hour shift), and she does not enjoy her job. Unsurprisingly, she suffers from panic attacks and extreme anxiety, to the point where she is frequently waking up in the middle of the night shaking and calling off work, which cascades into more work stress for her. This is, of course, not a healthy way to live. She is so worried that there is something wrong with her making her feel anxious, nauseous, sick, and depressed all the time. It is really worrying to witness, and I do really care about her well-being. But, I have my own issues too, and constantly supporting her has been very difficult and is throwing my life out of balance, and I no longer feel like an equal in our relationship.

  
She has tried medicine, therapy, meditation and journaling, and is constantly looking for new (maybe obscure) solutions, such as religion, volunteer work, etc. I have convinced her to take some time off work, which she has finally worked out with her boss. I also reached out to my friends, who have treated anxiety with certain medications, and had them share their stories with her and answer her questions based on their experiences. I think she is on the right path, in general, to getting better. But she is still in a very fragile state of mind, constantly feels nauseous and anxious, deals with manic panic attacks, gets migraines, etc.



What she still has yet to address is her sleep schedule, diet, and exercise routine. This is crazy to me, but she refuses to drink water. She gets these crazy migraines and feels nauseous all the time, and is willing to ""try anything to fix herself"", but drinking water is ""too difficult"". She worries that she has some disease that makes it hard to drink water, and has thought about getting tested and taking some steroid or whatever to take care of her kidneys. Idk. That actually really frustrates me because drinking water is not hard, and I feel strongly that it would help with a lot of her problems. Its at least worth a shot and makes more sense than trying another pill. It makes me think that she actually isn't trying hard enough. Or...maybe I actually don't understand her condition.

  
So that was all context. Obviously, she objectively has a lot of mental problems that she needs to address and is addressing. What I really need help with is understanding is if we have an unhealthy relationship and if so, how can I salvage it if possible. I have written out a few of my biggest frustrations.

* Drive to see her daily. If I can't see her, we talk on the phone for hours. This was fine at first, but it has since become a chore, and I am finding it harder to keep up with my good habits, such as healthy sleep schedule, exercise, and time with friends. Usually, our phone calls are her complaining and even crying about how she feels and me consoling her. If I can't see her or talk to her for as long as she wants, she can get upset/depressed/insecure, and it makes me feel guilty. I have tried to include her in my activities, such as going to the gym or hanging with my friends, but every time I have tried to integrate her into my life, she feels nauseous and is totally out of it. I don't know what my friends think of her, but the vibe is usually uncomfortable when we are all together. 
   * A small little anecdote: I was sick with COVID or something a few weeks ago. Every day that week, I woke up from a mid-day nap to drive to her house and go on a walk with her, wearing a mask. I did not want to, but she was having a hard time and wanted to see me, so I felt obligated to. One of the days, she was complaining about how she felt. Meanwhile, I was suffering from a headache, joint pain, exhaustion and a head ache. I was not a great conversationalist that day, and I had a hard time consoling her since I was dealing with my own health issues, which she had no concerns about. Because I didn't console her good enough, she thought ""I wasn't excited to see her"". I had to explain to her that I was feeling exhausted and sick, myself, and did not have enough energy to give you the support she was looking for.  

* She talks about her exes A LOT. It is crazy. I had to tell her that it feels extremely humiliating when you talk about your exes to your friends around me. ""Last time I was here, I was on a date..."" or ""My ex and I did that once..."". When we are alone, its even worse. She is constantly telling me how bad her ex used to be or how I remind her of her other ex or how her parents like me more than her exes etc etc. I told her that she can talk to me about anything, but I really don't like it when she brings up her exes. I have never mentioned my previous relationship history to her beyond the basic stuff when we were initially starting to date. I also told her explicitly that I would really like it if she stopped talking about her exes in front of other people when I am around.

* When we have sex, I often feel inadequate and maybe used. She is far and away a more sexual person than me. We will literally be feeling each other up, and she will look at me disappointed and say shit like ""I want to turn you on"" or ""I want you to want me so much you struggle"" when I am literally fully hard and making out with her. I also really enjoy hands stuff--recently, she said something like ""I wish you would get excited about being inside of me as much as you do when I touch you"" literally after I just climaxed from vaginal sex. Idk, little comments like that make me feel a little inadequate sometimes. I am a pretty compassionate person, and comments like that make me question our compatibility.

* She does not treat her family well in my eyes. Her mom is currently visiting her from Texas for an indefinite period of time to take care of her at the request of my girlfriend. She straight up assigns tasks to her mom, such as picking up dog toys or buying items for her house. She also told me that she told her mom she still wants to see me privately, which makes me feel uncomfortable because when we hang out, I am just thinking about how her mom is just hanging out at her house with nothing to do until my gf returns. Or the other night, I was sort of coerced into hooking up with my gf in her bedroom while her mom was doing the dishes right outside, which I really was not into. I verbalized that to her, but she still applied pressure to have sex anyway, which we ended up doing.

* She does not take great care of her pets. Her dog barks so much and she does not feed her lizards on a consistent schedule. The dog really bugs me though. She has neighbors, and she is totally fine with having her dog bark on her balcony whenever someone is walking by. Or, she is fine leaving her dog tied up outside a coffee shop, barking up a storm, while she goes inside to get coffee. I've tried to stay outside with her dog to keep it from being a disturbance, but she will guilt me into coming inside with her because ""she wants to be with me"". This worries me a little bit if we  maintain our relationship and ever have children.

* In general, she complains a lot. She hates being cold to the point where she will avoid the cold altogether. Or she hates water, so she doesn't drink water. I think this bothers me so much because I do things that are hard all the time, and getting cold time to time or drinking water to stay hydrated are not hard things to do. 

So I know everyone's advice is probably going to be that you need to talk with her. My dilemma is I really, truly care about her, and I want her to get mentally healthy. I don't want to give her any reason to have more stress or reasons to panic. It truly is scary how terribly anxious she is and the toll it is taking on her. God, I can't even imagine how she would handle a break up in her current mental state if we got to that point. So what does a third party opinion look like? Is this relationship fucked?  Is there anything I can do, so we can feel more like equals?

1i2v9bt,https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1i2v9bt/weekly_recap_january_16_2025/,"Weekly Recap | JANUARY 16, 2025","Why, hello there! Welcome to another edition of the Weekly Recap where we recap the week! Let's see what happened in case you missed something!

**NEWS AND ISSUES**

* Reddit released the Q3 Safety & Security report for 2024. You can read it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditSafety/comments/1i0ne04/q3_2024_safety_security_report_election_recap_and/). 

* The Content Policy has been renamed ""Reddit Rules"" and this was announced in the post linked above. Longtime Redditors might remember that “rules” was actually the original name of the Content Policy. But the name “Reddit Rules” better reflects that our policies govern both content AND behavior on Reddit. This is just a name change and doesn’t affect the content of the rules themselves. You can read the Reddit Rules [here](https://redditinc.com/policies/reddit-rules).

* There was a little tiny outage on Tuesday, the 14th. It was resolved fairly quickly, so the status page did not have a chance to get updated. 

* The fix for iOS buttons being unresponsive should be out in the 2025.02 version of the app. If you have updated to that version and are still having issues, please nicely let me know and I'll pass it on to the team that's working on that. 

* Some users may be seeing duplicate posts in their home feed. This has been fixed and will go out in the 2025.03 version of the app. 

* The banana icon for the Reddit Recap should be gone at this time. If you're still seeing it, please update the app. If you did not view your Recap for some reason and would like to now that it is gone, that is not possible. It's over. But come back next year! 

*Next week's app release will be delayed a little bit due to the US holiday of MLK Day. It will still go out, but just a little bit later than usual.

**BUGS ROUNDUP**

* [Web] Comment/post overflow menu actions are broken - The fix is on the way

* [iOS] The app crashes when you try to sort the rules within the mod tools - This will be fixed in version 2025.03

* [iOS] Some users were reporting a blank comment section - This has been fixed!

Thanks to u/CorrectScale and all of the work going on over in r/bugs. If you are experiencing a bug, please head over there to report it! 

**ONGOING ISSUES**

* If your account gets the ""server error"" banner or you can't update your profile, I can fix that sometimes! Just let me know and I'll take a look and get you all taken care of! Please note that I cannot give any information or assist with any account unless contacted directly from that account. **I cannot fix accounts where you are receiving the ""server error"" message and are unable to view content from that account when logged out.** In those instances, you will need to file an appeal. 

* If no one else can see your posts or comments across Reddit (not just in one sub) and you are unable to post here in r/help, you can file an appeal [here](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000600232). 

* Please check the [Help Center](https://www.reddithelp.com/) to see if you can find the answer to your question there. Also, check this sub for stickied posts regarding outages and downtime. 

* If your account is marked as NSFW and it is not NSFW, you can check out [this Help Center article](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043471131-Why-was-my-profile-marked-as-Not-Safe-for-Work-NSFW-and-how-can-I-change-it) for information on how to change it back. If you're unable to change it back, feel free to make a post and we'll help you out. (Team effort, this one is! Thanks to all of the helpers who flag me for this.)

* Last week, there were a multitude of issues that were brought up that I addressed in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1hxj9j7/weekly_recap_january_9_2025/m69lvcv/) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1hxj9j7/weekly_recap_january_9_2025/m69m4bd/) comment. Huge thanks to u/jgoja for cataloging all of these and bringing them to the table so that I could get really good at filing tickets and get everything in front of the correct teams and track things along the way. So far, we've made progress in a couple of areas:

  * The number of subreddits that you can view on the sidebar is intentionally capped at 250. If you are subscribed to more than 250 subreddits, you can view the entire list over on old Reddit by going here: https://www.reddit.com/subreddits/mine

  * The issue with not being able to see more than 25 subreddits in a custom feed has been fixed. 

**WEEKLY STATISTICS**

Over the past 7 days, r/help had 1,758 posts, which is only 22 fewer posts than the 1,780 posts in the previous 7 days. And there were 4,743 comments which is up just 42 comments from the 4,701 comments the previous seven days. So we're holding pretty steady! 2,800 new users subscribed to r/help last week (exactly the same as the previous week's 2,800 subscriptions) and there were over 1.3 million views, which is the same as the 1.3  million views last week. Consistency all the way around in r/help! 

**TOP POSTS**

* **[Can I filter out posts with certain topics?](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1hx4l35/no_trump_no_musk/)**

A user was hoping to rid their feed of topics that they don't want to see. They don't necessarily want to unsubscribe from those subs, but they don't want to see posts on certain topics. I hear ya. We're all tired. lol Unfortunately, there is not a way to filter out specific topics. As super mod and awesome helper u/westcoastcdn19 said ""You can mute subreddits that are likely to feature the type of content you’re trying to avoid, but no way to use key words to filter posts"".

* **[Your free awards are back for another 36 hours](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1hxlr4i/your_free_awards_are_back_for_another_36_hours/)**

Some users had free awards that were to expire on December 31 at a specific time. Due to some sort of technical irregularity, some users awards expired before that stated time. Our friend u/sticksfigured stopped by to let us know that everyone who had free awards that expired to early would be getting them back and had 36 more hours until January 10, 2025 at 11:59:59 PT to use them up. Thanks, Sticks! 

* **[How do you report a subreddit that is breaking the rules?](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1hylqb7/why_so_many_hateful_subreddits/)**

A user had run across some subs that were explicitly violating the newly renamed [Reddit Rules](https://redditinc.com/policies/reddit-rules). If you see content that is violating the rules of Reddit, please report it! You can use the report button underneath the content to report individual violations. If you would like to report an entire subreddit, you can use [this form](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360001103212) and under ""What is your community concern?"", please select ""I want to report a subreddit for violating the Reddit Rules"". Then fill out the rest of the form. It would be super helpful if you could include links to the violating content. That way, even if the subreddit isn't in violation of the rules, the user who posted violating content can be actioned.

In Bollywood, it's a cup of singing, a sprinkle of catcalling, accompanied by a generous helping of bizarre dances around the woman till she gives in and likes you back. In Kdrama, the man has to unrealistically rescue the woman from a car or bus or from falling from a height or from hot coffee that is about to scald her skin. And so on. Each tactic is over the top but (more importantly) different so it becomes very confusing overall.

But how should we men go about trying to romantically approach a woman in real life? Can you ladies you give us some pointers on wooing?

Last month’s box featured 3 ethiopian washed beans so I decided to have a cupping. 

The result was pretty surprising to me. Some lovely fruityness and nice acidity. I've never been able to get that out of whashed beans ever with the V60 only ever with natural or fermented. So I think I truly suck at the V60. 

I'll have to reevaluate if its a good brewing technique for me. I had switched over from an aeropress and found the increased clarity to be enjoyable but now knowing I'm leaving soo much flavour behind is eye opening. (I'm using a Q2 heptagonal)

Also did a washed Kenya in the cupping session which hilariously tasted like canned green beens and asparagus. I wanted to have a contrast with the ethiopians and boy was I ever served what I wished for.",1,1737051004.0,pourover,2,1.0,False
1i2v7xn,https://www.reddit.com/r/LGBTindia/comments/1i2v7xn/what_do_i_do_with_this_hot_stranger/,What do i do with this hot stranger?,"One evening, while waiting at the bus stop, I noticed a guy giving me what felt like a very deliberate look—shirt slightly lifted, exposing his belly. I tried to ignore him, staring into the distance, but he smirked at me. On impulse, I walked over and casually asked, “Hey man, are you looking for something?” He didn’t respond immediately but eventually asked where I lived and what I did. Turns out, we lived in the same area.

When the bus arrived, it was packed. He squeezed in, but I stayed behind. As the bus moved away, he kept looking at me, almost as if he wanted me to follow. I waved goodbye, and that was that. I forgot about him for weeks.

But then one night, on my way home, I saw someone walking ahead, just beyond the streetlights. He was carrying a backpack and, as I approached, he seemed to notice me. Suddenly, he slowed down, fidgeting with his bag. My heart raced—was he pulling something out? I passed him quickly without making eye contact, but as I did, he cleared his throat, almost like a call for attention. I kept walking, resisting the urge to look back until I was farther away. When I finally turned, he was gone.

The next morning, I walked the same road, hoping to see him again. I didn’t. There was this strange feeling of regret—of not acting when I had the chance.

Then, as if by fate, I saw him again. This time, he was walking slowly, with a slight limp. He noticed me and made a strange sound, almost like a signal. I hesitated, pretending to head to a shop, but couldn’t bring myself to approach him. As I passed, I felt a mix of intrigue and nervousness.

Since then, I’ve noticed him around the same spot at 7:35 p.m. each time. One evening, he looked especially handsome—well-dressed, with no backpack. Maybe he’d had a special day. He saw me again, and I felt my nerves spike. Why hasn’t he approached me? Should I be the one to break the ice?

I keep replaying our first encounter in my head. What did he want that day? Does he remember me like I remember him? Next time, I’m determined to say hi—maybe even invite him for coffee.

I’m dealing with a concerning issue where smoke from burning plastic at a commercial building next door has entered my property earlier today. I’m worried about potential health risks and the lingering smell or damage it could cause. The plumes of smoke created a noticable haze inside and outside -- I immediately called the fire department which responded in the matter of minutes. The fire was confirmed as starting from the business next door, with it being reported that plastic was burning in their oven. 

It took me around 10 minutes to evacuate; as I was unsure if it was something minor in my own apartment and investigating, only to open the door to the hallway and see a thick haze. During this time  and during the evacuation I was not wearing a mask, and in certain areas the smoke made the corridor non-visible. 

Has anyone experienced something similar? What immediate steps should I take to mitigate the impact, and what long-term actions can I consider to address this with the neighboring business? Also, how can I ensure my indoor air quality returns to a safe level? Should I go to urgent care and have any tests run? 

I currently feel a bit light-headed and spacey from what I presume is the fumes. 

Actions I have taken:

\-Left the apartment to get fresh air at a coffee shop

\-When entering the apartment wearing a mask and setting up two air purifiers, cracking all windows.

\-Made a log of time emergency services were called

Any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",1,1737050877.0,legaladvice,0,1.0,False

I have the misfortune of being a bit of an empath, particularly with negative vibes and emotions. If you’re upset or anxious, then so am I. I fucking hate it. But I also have the ability to never let it show. So…

Around 9:00 this morning, a woman came down to the front desk to ask if anyone had turned in a purse. I immediately said no because no one turned one in to me, and as dumb as my coworkers can be, they know to leave notes about something like that. I asked the lady to describe it, and she said it was a black bag that she had with her *last night around 9pm when she came down to get coffee.*

😐😐😐 how can you not account for your purse for 12 hours?? 

She then went on to explain that it had basically her whole life in it—keys, ID, credit cards, lots of cash. As she’s explaining, I was already in the process of looking in our lost and found, around the desk, and near where she said she was last night. Her sister got involved and volunteered to look in the room again. 

While we’re waiting for the sister, the woman (who I’ll call Andale) asked if we had cameras to check because at this point, she was convinced someone had stolen her purse, even though she admitted she didn’t remember taking it off. 

I went to my manager to ask her to run the cameras back, but they were buffering, so I had to buy more time. I went back to the lobby to try and assure Andale and her sister that we were doing everything we could to help her. But by now, she was locked in on the idea that someone had stolen it. 

*”I only been to two places, and there is no way these cameras won’t show who took my purse! I can’t get home without it, so they need to find whoever took it!”*

The manager came out to the lobby and explained everything herself. Then for whatever reason, brought up the fact that our lobby was full of people this morning and they could have accidentally taken it with them. How that was supposed to help, I don’t know, but Andale is in full hand-on-head panic mode now. 

SADLY FOR US, the camera system continued to buffer, so the manager had to call the owner, who is out of state and busy, to give us access to the server. Which he did, but in his haste, he failed to give us the password. So in order to try not to bother him, we tried to guess the password, failing each of our limited attempts. 

I went back to the front desk to see if I could find the password in an email, and give an update to our antsy guests. I had also text the owner myself to see if he could send the password. By then, I had a number of other guests who needed my assistance. 

*”I mean, I’m not understanding the lack of urgency here! Y’all can look on the cameras and see which one of these people took my stuff?! I mean, that’s EVERYTHING I have!”*

My manager ended up getting a phone call from her kid’s school, so she stepped outside to see what the problem was. Andale saw her and lost it. 

*”HOW CAN SHE JUST GO OUTSIDE ON A SMOKE BREAK WHEN MY STUFF IS MISSING?! You know what, y’all aren’t moving quick enough for me. I’m gonna go check my room one more time, then my next step is to call the police and file a police report to get that video footage.”*

Which… if WE don’t have the password, what makes you think the police are gonna have access??

I finally called the owner, who sounded like he was running a marathon, and got him to text the password to the manager. The manager was still on the phone with her kid’s school, but I let her know to expect a text. 

So I was left in the lobby with Sister, who took a phone call, and she was telling the other person the situation. I always like to listen in to hear what lies get told. But her phone call got interrupted by one from Andale… *who found her fucking purse in a drawer.*

Sister threatened to kick her ass, then offered a very embarrassed apology before running to the elevator. 

About 30 minutes later, they both came down to check out, and Andale had this to say:

*”I do apologize, BUT I still take issue with the way this was handled. There could have been a little more urgency on your end.”*

I wished them a good day and went back to talk about her to my manager. 

A couple minutes later, the sister came back to re-apologize. She gave me a hug and told me that I handled everything with grace and professionalism. 

*”If I was in your shoes, I woulda lost patience because SHE lost her purse, not me or you! So yeah, the way you handled things did not go unnoticed. You deserve a merit badge!”*

I don’t usually like apologies, but that was nice to hear, because yeah, IT IS NOT MY FAULT THAT YOU LOST YOUR OWN PURSE IN YOUR OWN ROOM. ",1,1737050860.0,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,0,1.0,False

Should I be worried or am I overreacting?","Just had a really odd experience this morning, and I am curious if it is something to be worried about/report, or if it is a scam? 

This morning I heard my dogs barking and looked outside to see a large truck idling in my driveway and a man looking under the mat at my front door. My family member went outside to ask what they were doing and the man told us he ""had bought some coffee syrup on marketplace and was here to pick up the envelope of money"" which doesn't make sense. If he bought it, he would be picking up the coffee and leaving the money, not vice-versa. 

Anyways, we let him know that he must have the wrong address and he read from his phone our address, exactly right. He wouldn't tell us who sent the message, and didn't ask us for our names either to confirm or check, which I found odd. He then got back in his truck and sat in our driveway for 3 minutes with a younger female passenger in the passenger seat, who kept looking at our house then looking at her phone, again and again. My family member went back outside and approached the truck, asking them if they had figured it out and the guy got mad and said no and drove away.   
  
My most logical assumption is he was scammed and someone gave him our address, which also freaks me out that someone is giving out my address. The anxious part of me feels like they were scoping our house for some reason, because their story didn't make any sense.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you found this note in a small wooden box with a heart on it, then \*congratulations!\* You are probably the first person to read this. I didnt really plan on sharing this with anybody, but for some reason I think its exciting that somebody out there, a complete stranger, will come across this note and read my story. Someone I will never meet, sharing such a personal bond with me. Im fascinated that either one of us could die - even as soon as tomorrow - with the other being completely clueless to the fact. To you, my entire life is within this note, and so I will live for as long as your memory can carry me. Writing this, Im wondering if that makes you feel fascinated or violated. Its so exciting.



Im sorry if my story is a bit disorganized, but Id like to get it down while its still fresh on my mind. First, Ill tell you a little bit about myself. Im a first-year college girl and have led, by most standards, a pretty unspectacular life up to this point. I grew up in an upper-middle class school district with decent teachers. I did track in middle school and some of high school, and Ive had two boyfriends. Now, Im studying for a career in occupational therapy, because I feel the field is undervalued and provides tremendous help to people.



Im giving you this background because theres this strange misconception that if you want to kill someone then youre either sick in the head or you have anger management issues. But, its very apparent that I dont fall into either of those categories. Its true that most murder cases are in a domestic setting where someone loses control of their anger or something. But the thing is that those people kill under provocation, whether by a singular outburst or by a slow-burning series of misfortunes. Those people kill because in that brief moment, they want a specific someone, for a specific reason, to be hurt or killed.



What Im talking about is wanting to kill someone for no specific reason, maybe just to see what its like. Do you ever get that? I wouldnt know how others feel, because its not something I ever talked about. But Ive been curious about what its like to kill someone ever since I was a child. Not killing anyone in particular, just a random person. Its always just fascinated me that if I put my mind to it, I can approach anyone, and in five minutes they would be completely gone from this Earth.



But Ive never done so for a couple of reasons. First of all, for most of my life it was logistically impossible for me to do it without getting caught. I only got my drivers license a couple years ago, and even then, the preparations would take too much time, definitely stirring suspicion. It was only once I started college that I realized this was no longer an obstacle.



Another reason is that I was afraid of causing harm to too many people. You might laugh reading that, at how hypocritical it sounds. But, let me explain: Why should I feel bad about killing someone if theyre too dead to care? Who would I be feeling bad for? Contrarily, its the grief of the living that Id rather not be responsible for. Because of this, I knew it would take a good deal of research before finding a suitable person to kill, and Ive never had the means to do so - again, until I started college.



And now, having just experienced it, Id say it was pretty satisfying in the end. Something I would try again? Probably not, since my curiosity has already been satisfied. It really wouldnt be the same a second time.



But anyway, if by any chance youre also curious to kill someone, then youre welcome to take notes. :)



\*\*\*



I started a hobby of people-watching soon after I entered college. People-watching is interesting to me because its taking one of the infinite extras in your life and turning them into a main character - without them knowing, of course. Its so easy to forget that every single one of the hundreds of strangers you pass every day has a life story as deep and complex as your own. One thing I noticed about people-watching, and wanting to kill someone, is that you are in more constant awareness of this. When I find a person to observe, their story slowly becomes more clear to me over time, gaps being filled - it really is amazing.



I usually went to grocery stores on weekends and looked around in peoples shopping carts. If I saw something that interested me, I decided to observe the person for a little bit. Of course, since my goal was to find someone to kill, I ruled out anyone who had children or a partner with them. Wedding rings were another tell-tale sign.



So maybe once a weekend, I would find someone who fit my criteria, at which point I would follow them home and note their address. From there, it became incredibly easy to investigate a little bit more; most people have normal work hours, meaning I could spend afternoons going through their mail or looking around in their house. I repeated this with several people (and had one close call), but for varying reasons I didnt really feel satisfied enough with them to kill any of them.



I started getting a bit impatient and thought that I might just settle for killing the man named Devon, even though I didnt really want to kill someone wealthy. But then, I came across someone new - someone who just, felt perfect. The feeling only strengthened as I investigated her further, and I knew that she would be the one for me to kill.



A young-looking woman I met at the grocery store, as per usual. She was doing some light shopping with a basket. Her hair was wavy and dark brown, sitting inelegantly on her slumped shoulders and surrounding her tired-looking face. Her bare fingers told me she might be single, but beyond that, my gut was almost certain of it. This woman just seemed soplain, really. I guess I felt a greater acuity for the personal lives of strangers ever since I started my people-watching. But the way she carried herself, I just got the feeling that if she suddenly died, nobody would be around to miss her. Of course, I still wanted to investigate her a bit.



I followed my usual routine of checking out her place during her work hours. I learned immediately from her mail that her name is Linda Watson. Linda lived in a quiet apartment complex, her mailbox easily accessible right outside her door. Instead of quickly shuffling through it, I decided I could take her mail back to my dorm and return it before she was finished with work (she only lived about 15 minutes from me). I did some research and learned how to open and reseal the envelopes without damaging them, which took some technique along with a hair dryer, rubbing alcohol, and Q-tips.



This made it easy for me to learn a little more about her. Linda was a 33-year-old woman who worked for a small accounting firm - Id rather not name the place outright. Her birthday was December 11th which, coincidentally, was approaching in a couple weeks. I also managed to find a bank statement that gave me a nice look into how shes been spending her past month. It was at this point I realized that my assessment of Linda Watson as an extremely plain woman was pretty spot-on, because there was absolutely nothing interesting on the list. A trip to Old Navy, a bunch of Starbucks, something about $40 from Amazon - no restaurants, no movies, nothing that would really imply she was spending any time socializing. That aside, I also found a cooking magazine, so I guess she was into cooking.



Apartments are harder to break into than suburban homes, because there are fewer doors and windows. Every time I got Lindas mail, I would check the front door and the windows in the back, but they were always locked. This was a bit frustrating because I was really interested in getting into her house. So, I came up with a sort of plan that I thought would be fun, even if it didnt work.



Last Saturday, I visited Linda Watsons apartment complex as I would on weekdays. The difference is that this time, I wanted her to be home. I thought it would be interesting to have a conversation with her. If I got lucky, I could take advantage of the situation to discreetly unlock a window from the inside. So, I walked up to her door wearing nothing warmer than a light sweatshirt, and knocked. The adrenaline rush was crazy. I was afraid I might screw something up.



The door opened, and in front of me stood Linda Watson, exactly as I remembered her from the grocery store. It was at that moment, making eye contact for the first time, that I realized I was running the risk of beginning to care about this person. As selfish as it is, I couldnt kill a person I cared about, even if its a 33-year-old woman standing in a doorway with a slightly perplexed look on her face, giving me a reserved Hello.



Arms crossed from the cold, I shyly returned Lindas greeting. I explained that I was walking my dog near the woodsy area behind the back of her apartment, and that he had gotten away. I had been looking for my dog for an hour and was wondering if Linda may have seen him roaming about. Of course, Linda sympathetically apologized for the situation and that she couldnt be of use to me, but that she would keep an eye out. I wore a defeated expression in response, apologizing in return for troubling her.



It somehow went exactly as I had hoped - Linda invited me inside to warm up a bit with some coffee. I outwardly hesitated before accepting her offer, although on the inside I wanted to jump through the door and hug her for cooperating so well. And thats how Linda Watson ended up with a 19-year-old girl next to her on the couch - who knows if it was just a nice gesture or if she really has no better way to spend her Saturdays than talking to some kid she just met (who happens to be interested in killing her).



Linda soon learned that my name is Maria (its not) and that I attend the nearby community college (I dont). I was a little bit nervous that she would ask me too many questions because I didnt have many answers prepared. I was able to steer the conversation toward her, and she was pretty happy to talk. I asked what she does, and she told me that she works for the accounting firm I already knew about, communicating with outside clients and keeping records. I told her I was pretty nervous about growing up. She told me to enjoy college and to make lots of friends because theres less opportunity once you start working.



When I asked if she was married or anything, she laughed. Of course I knew she wasnt married, but I wanted to hear more about her love life. She said that she doesnt currently have a boyfriend (I guess shes at least had boyfriends, but who knows how long ago). When I asked her about kids, she said she doesnt want them until she gets a better job. On top of that, she told me that her family has a history of some genetic diseases such as arthritis and depression, which she is afraid to give to her kids.



Its funny that she mentioned that because when I asked to use her bathroom, I noticed a tube of prescription pills on the sink. It was labelled duloxetine, which I looked up later and discovered that it is in fact an antidepressant. I had a joking thought that maybe by killing her Id be doing her a favor, but quickly decided I was a terrible person for coming up with that.



The rest of the visit was pretty dull. We talked about food and some other mundane stuff before I eventually made an excuse to leave. I didnt get the chance to unlock a window or anything like that, but I didnt really feel the need to go through her apartment anymore. As early as the drive back to my dorm, I was already thinking about how I would best like to kill Linda Watson.



The choice was between effectiveness and fun. I decided to go with fun, because it would be way more satisfying to kind of dissect her as I killed her, rather than just getting it done and calling it a day. Fast-forward one week to December 13th - today, actually. Linda Watson turned 34 two days ago. I made a fun little wager with myself where if Linda was spending her birthday weekend alone, I would pay her a visit and kill her. If she was out or had company, I would stop by next week or something instead.



So this morning, I drove over to Lowes and bought an axe. Again, I expect youre laughing, but thats also kind of the point. An axe is so kind of cliche and a movies thing that I actually thought it would be the most fun. Swinging it at someone and everything, its a really entertaining image. They actually had a bunch of different axes, so I picked one that had a good weight but was still light enough for me to swing quickly.



The drive after getting the axe was when the adrenaline really picked up. All that kept going through my mind on the way over was Wow, Im really doing this. Not in a bad way, just like a surprised this is real life sort of thing. I also got this strange rush of recollections of the time I spent with Linda. It was like my life was flashing before my eyes, except it was just the rather mundane hour I spent with Linda - like snippets of our conversations, the sound of her laugh, her facial expressions and stuff.



I also wondered to myself what the crazy serial killers would be feeling at a time like this - schizophrenic delusions? Sexual buildup? I have no idea, but what I felt was kind of like ridiculously alert and numb in the senses at the same time, however thats possible.



Before getting out of the car, I had the sense to stuff the axe into my backpack to look a little less ridiculous walking across the parking lot. The handle was sticking out, but that didnt really matter. At that point my heart was pounding so hard I could feel my throat throbbing. I tried controlling my breath, but its really hard to not breathe fast when your heart is pounding like that.



I reached Linda Watsons door and quietly put my ear to it after setting down my backpack. I heard a voice that wasnt hers - company? No, it was just the TV, mixed with her occasional tapping footsteps behind the door. I actually kept my ear there for a really freaking long time, because I wanted to make absolutely sure nobody was over. Probably 10 minutes of that and a lot of reassuring myself convinced me.



I quietly opened my backpack zipper and held the axe in my hands. My fiercely shaking hands. What the hell was this kind of reaction that my body was making? I told my body to shut up, that its no big deal, but of course it wouldnt listen. It was actually bizarre how much my hands were shaking. It must be the adrenaline buildup. I rolled my eyes at myself and got my hand to rest on the doorknob. If its locked, Ill knock, itll be basically the same. I took a deep breath and forced my muscles into action.



I swiftly turned the doorknob. Not locked. In one movement, I opened up the door and slipped inside. Linda Watson, just a few steps away into the kitchen. I see - she was in the middle of cooking. She immediately jumped and turned around, startled. I expected that. Quickly, I let go of the doorknob and adjusted the axe into both hands. In the following split second, I realized that she would probably start to make a lot of noise. Looking back, Im an idiot for not considering that. Just as Lindas mouth opened to speak - maybe even started speaking - I forcefully swung my axe into the side of her head.



But, my axe was facing backwards. I hit her with the blunt end of the blade. I actually did this on purpose, because in that split second I somehow decided that it would be the way to keep her noise to a minimum. It actually worked. I felt barely any resistance in the swing as I collided with her head, knocking it clean aside. Lindas half-formed syllable came out as a kind of weird grunt - a noisy exhalation is probably the best I could describe it. That happened at the same time as her head smacked into the cabinet from the force, and she fell backwards without any ability to keep her balance. I didnt hesitate at all to keep swinging at her while she was half lying down on the ground, this time my axe facing the right way. I didnt really know where to swing, so I kind of just started hacking at her collarbone area and chest. It didnt feel like the axe was going too deep, but there was a nice thunk sort of sound every time the axe embedded into her. I even felt the soft sinking sensation ripple into my hands, like the axe was a kind of physical extension of my sense of touch.



On a whim, I swung once at her throat, but most of the swing actually missed and I hit the floor by accident, causing a loud, dull whack to resonate through the apartment. I didnt have time to think about it. I swung again with better aim and got a more centered hit, feeling the bone or cartilage or whatever is in there, so I must have split it open. Right after that, I decided to swing at her face, and I got this diagonal cut along her nose and mouth, which felt pretty good so I did it once more.



I finally briefly stopped to survey the damage. Linda was bleeding ridiculously. The blood was kind of coming out in waves, in sync with her beating heart, probably. It was pooling all around her and riding along the cracks between the tiles. Her light blue shirt was all torn up and stained dark, kind of mixed with a fleshy mess around her chest. It was all just glistening red. Her face wasnt much better, covered in dripping red at this point, and her lip was kind of hanging off, revealing red-stained teeth in a really weird way, like a zombie or something.



Linda wasnt dead, though. Her limbs were kind of weakly, aimlessly trying to move while she was stuck on her back. More than anything, she reminded me of a bug that you crush but it still pitifully moves its legs around before it dies completely. Thats basically what she was doing. But I didnt know how long it would take for her to die, or what kind of condition she was in. I ended up grabbing a big knife that was on the counter that she was using to cut up meat. Trying to step around the blood, I reached down and carved into the upper half of her neck, trying to sort of saw it from the left side to the right. It was a little awkward because the area was so soft and squished around the knife as I was cutting. But the sensation was completely different from the axe. It actually felt like I was cutting a tough piece of raw meat (which I guess technically, I was).



The blood started pouring out, and I hoped that I severed the most major arteries in there. It must have worked, because after a moment Lindas limb movements kind of just had the strength drained from them, soon resting still on the floor. I took a few seconds to catch my breath. No time to stick around and think about the experience. I shook the knife blade through a dirty pan in the sink to clean off the blood, then threw the knife into my backpack. I did the same with the axe. I also took her laptop that was sitting on the counter. It had some recipe open for veal and mushrooms. I didnt really take the laptop to use it, since I have a perfectly good one myself that I got for college. I just wanted to look through it for fun.



I finally went outside and closed the door behind me. I got some blood on my sweater and jeans. But funnily enough, I actually anticipated that so I wore dark colors.



The drive back to my dorm was just a constant replaying of the experience in my head. I guess thats still kind of happening even now, actually. But it felt pretty nice. Linda Watson is dead. I kind of let the weight of that sink in. The sensation of having completely removed a human life from existence. Its crazy. I dont know how else to describe it.



Anyway, I threw the axe and knife into a dumpster on campus, which I think is picked up every Monday, so theyll be gone by then. My roommate goes home on the weekends, so I have the dorm to myself today. It gave me the chance to go through Lindas website history. I was right in thinking thats where her deepest secrets would lie.



There was actually a lot of dirty stuff, like the names of websites for porn videos and stories and things like that. Same with her searches. A lot of the websites were boring, like cooking websites and recipes, and game websites like Bejeweled and stuff. I eventually got to the one week ago section of her history, and it gave me a chill.



There were a whole bunch of searches like methods of suicide, how to tie a noose, dangerous household chemicals, carbon monoxide poisoning - like a lot of them. She was probably ready to write a book on suicide after all the research she did. So I guess Linda was contemplating suicide. I wonder if it was influenced by her depression.



The irony is actually striking. Maybe Linda was going to die anyway. Or maybe she couldnt find the courage to do it. If that were the case, I almost literally gave her a birthday present by killing her. Thats actually really comical in a messed-up way, and it leaves a weird taste in my mouth. The part I dont get is that I didnt see any of those searches up until the one week ago section, nothing more recent than that.



I ended up throwing the laptop in the dumpster with the other stuff. Its been a few hours since then, so Ive had some time to calmly think about everything. Like I said, it was pretty satisfying and Im glad I finally got around to it. I feel like I can finally cross it off my bucket list, or like Im tying loose ends with myself. This is probably the first and last time Ill write the name Linda Watson - its back to living a normal college life, except I might do some people-watching every now and then because its definitely fun and interesting.



But Ill always wonder how many people there are like me. Im sure there has to be a lot, because there is just nothing strange about it to me, being curious about killing someone. Sadly, its something that people cant exactly just talk about, so I guess Ill never know. Im sure that anyone would just lie about it even if you asked them. But you cant help but wonder if that person in the grocery store, who stares at you as you pass by, might be considering what it would be like to kill you. If I could, I would tell them all about it, so they could decide for themselves.  But who knows, maybe I got lucky, and that person is you. I actually really, really hope so.

1i2v21z,https://i.redd.it/q12fz489bede1.jpeg,Imagining an Alternate Ending for The Last of Us 2,"Night falls over a clearing bathed in soft moonlight. Joel and Abby sit around a small campfire, the crackling of the flames filling the awkward silence between them. Joel holds a makeshift coffee cup, his hands steady, but his gaze is lost in memory. Abby stands facing him, her arms crossed, her face drawn with the tension of conflicting emotions.
After a long silence, Joel breaks the barrier and begins to express himself.
Joel: (low voice, almost a whisper):
""I know that nothing I say will change what I did. Not for you... not for anyone."" (pause) ""But you deserve to know why I did what I did, I know you think I'm a heartless monster, I don't judge you for that. But you have to know the truth.""
Abby doesn't respond immediately, but her hardened gaze shows that she's listening.
Joel:
""When I lost my daughter... Sarah... the most precious thing in my life, something inside me died along with her. I spent years without purpose, just... surviving. Until Ellie came along, I felt like she gave me a chance to live, what I loved most in the world, which was the love of my daughter.""
He stares into the flames, his voice cracking.
Joel:
""She gave me something I thought I would never have again. Not just someone to care for. But a reason to keep living. So when they told me she had to die to... save the world..."" (pauses, takes a deep breath) ""I couldn't do it. I couldn't go through that again. I couldn't lose another daughter.""
Abby looks at Joel, her eyes shining with unshed tears.
Abby: (cold, but with a hint of vulnerability)
""And for that, you killed my father.""
Joel: (looking directly at her)
""I know. And I don't go a day without thinking about it. I won't apologize for saving Ellie, but... I'm sorry I took him away from you. I know what it's like to lose someone like that. It's a pain that never goes away.""
Abby: (broken voice)
""You took him from me, Joel. You destroyed the only family I had. All because you couldn't face your trauma.""
Joel lowers his head, shame weighing down on him.
Joel:
""You're right. It was selfish. I only thought about myself, only about what I was going to lose... and not about what the whole world could gain.""
Abby stands up, pacing in circles around the fire, fighting back tears.
Abby:
""You know what's worse? I know that if my father were in your shoes... he would do the same thing. He always said that saving a life was more important than anything else. He would have chosen to protect someone he loved, even if it meant the end of everything. I, I think I would do the same thing if it was to save him...""
Joel looks up at Abby, surprised by her statement.
Joel: (sincerely)
""Then maybe... he and I aren't so different after all...""
Abby: (stopping, staring at Joel)
""No. You're not. But that doesn't mean I can forgive you. You took everything from me. And I don't know if I'll ever be able to look at you without remembering that.""
Joel nods slowly, accepting the words with the gravity they deserve.
Joel:
""I don't expect you to forgive me. But I do hope that one day... you'll be able to find some peace. Even if it doesn't come from me.""
Abby is silent for a moment, taking a deep breath.
Abby: (lowering her voice and shaking)
""Maybe... someday. But I don't think ever.""
She turns, walking away from the fire, but stops for a moment and looks over her shoulder.
Abby:
""Take care of her, Joel. Don't make the same mistakes again. Tell... Ellie to be okay.
Joel watches as she disappears into the darkness, the weight of her words hanging in the air. He sighs, staring at the flames dancing in the fire, his expression a mix of regret and acceptance.
The camera pulls back, showing Joel alone by the fire as night consumes the landscape, leaving the promise that even in a broken world, understanding can be a step toward healing.",3,1737050597.0,TheLastOfUs2,0,1.0,False

1i2v032,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancun/comments/1i2v032/review_on_live_aqua/,Review on Live Aqua,"My wife and I (we're mid 30s) went to Live Aqua a few weeks ago and I wanted to give our unbiased review on it as I know there's lots of people in our shoes before trying to figure out which resort to stay at.

We ended up spending many nights reading lots of reddit reviews and we found this spot to be the most reliable when it came to actual real people and real reviews so I thought I would return the favour!

Disclaimer: This was both of our first times in Mexico so we don't really have a point of comparison

TL;DR: It's amazing and if you're on the fence about going, just do it, you won't regret it!

**The Good**

***The Service***

I never considered myself someone who really cares about good service but let me tell you, I was dead wrong. The service at Live Aqua is next level. Whether it be you're just chilling by the pool or the beach they have people come by and ask what you want to drink, go deliver it to you. Or it's just walking through the resort all of the staff are incredibly friendly and always willing to help as much as they can.

The room was very nice, they have a big ass tv for late nights when you're tired and wanna just chill. They have 24/7 room service (the options aren't the best, but the desserts are great). They come in during 12 or so every day and clean your entire room and tidy everything up replenishing your towels, chips, drinks, etc. We had clothes everywhere and other ""items"" around the beds and they tidied everything including folding my clothes, etc. It was pretty funny when we got back on the first day we were so surprised haha.

My FOB stopped working randomly 1 day and I went down to the lobby and they instantly had like 4 people come up with me to figure it out immediately. Funny enough they ended up removing the lock from the door, the handle was loose and was falling off but they apologized profusely and fixed it very fast.

***The Food***

We've never been to an all-inclusive but we read that most of them don't really have the best food, which makes sense. But one of the things we read about at Live Aqua was that the food was good and we were not disappointed! Other than 1 restaurant (Sea Corner) every one of their 6 or 7 restaurants were amazing. Truth be told though, the best food I had at Live Aqua was EASILY the bbq pit they have during the day or night time where they do fresh bbq chicken, ribs, or if they aren't doing that the fresh tacos they make. DAMN I will miss that soooo much. If you go to Live Aqua do not skip on the lunch time bbq or the tacos.

Favourite spots:

Hidden Garden. The aesthetic was awesome and the food was great, they had this coconut foam dessert that was banging

Azur. Food for both breakfast and dinner is great, the vibe of the place is chill, you're right by the beach, their smoothies are SO good. Make sure you order the smoothies there for brunch! My wife is middle eastern and she really loved the food there during dinner.

MB. The atmosphere was really high end, the food portions were really small but everything there was really fancy and pretty good. Honestly the actual food was slightly underwhelming? But definitely go here at least once because it's a vibe for sure.

Honourable mention. Big shout out to Marco at the morning breakfast buffet (it's awesome definitely go there at least once) who makes fresh smoothies and is super friendly.

***Overall Vibes***

Just great, we loved the aesthetic, the infinity pool was awesome, we swam a lot, we went into the ocean a lot. We woke up pretty early most days and set up our stuff on either one of the pool lounge spots or the beach lounge spots and just had such a relaxing time. The drinks are great, we highly recommend getting the Miami Vice cocktail (we're addicted, we started making them at home now).

They got a ""Starbucks"" in the resort but it's not like a real Starbucks, my wife called it fake starbucks because they have limited options, don't be expecting to get anything too wild with cold foam, just basic coffee and some frapps.

On our last night there they had this Circus event set up by the pool and it was a great time, we got dressed up a bit, got some food, watched the show it was so fun! They have lots of these events lined up and they give you an itinerary of things they are doing to see what you are interested in.

They do have like a DJ thing late at night at the Egos bar, we actually do enjoy going to club and stuff and dancing having some drinks but we went there and it's really small and there were like 10 people there soooooo we didn't end up doing that, we thought about going to one of the night clubs outside the resort but didn't end up doing that.

**The Bad (minor)**

**Premium Options**

They do have quite a few ""premium"" option stuff at the resort you have to pay more for but we didn't find them really necessary. For example they have a select few great Cabana spots that you have to pay extra for that would have been nice to have for all guests. Most of the restaurants have ""premium"" items like Lobster you pay extra for and the prices on them are absurd. Also one of the restaurants is fully premium where you have to pay for your meal and drinks (we didn't go there). It just sort of leaves a bad taste in our mouths where we paid a lot to be there and it feels bad when not everything is included. Maybe this is just because it's our first all-inclusive, not sure if this is super common or not.

Note: One of the premium options we ended up doing one of the days the weather was bad was the couples massage which was like $250 CDN or something? So pretty expensive, it was 50 minutes, it honestly felt great but probably not worth it. I wouldn't do it again. They also pitched that they had a jacuzzi and sauna after but they are separate so me and my partner would have to have done that separately which we weren't fans of and we didn't end up doing.

**The Hotel Lobby has a very strong aroma**

It has an INSANELY strong eucalyptus(?) scent. I don't know exactly what sort of concoction it is, but it almost gives me nausea smelling it. Luckily it's only in the lobby and you can't smell it too much where you're going to be most of the time. I thought I'd mention it as I saw a few posts about it and it was just an odd quirky thing about the resort I found off-putting. I only really mention this because of my FOB issue where I spent a bit more time in the lobby so I was more exposed to it.

***Pushy Salespeople***

Later during the day at the front of the resort they will have a few local merchants come by and sell their stuff to tourists. Now I actually don't mind this, we ended up buying a really cute fridge magnet as a souvenir but they tend to be very pushy. It could just be a culture thing because I just walked over to see what they had going on and trying to leave was very difficult, I just wanted to look haha.

After we got our massage the next day there was a lady explaining about 50% off massages and I talked to her and it turned out that if you sit through some 1 hour time share presentation you can get 50% off or something? That sort of felt bad, although I wouldn't waste an hour of my time there sitting through a sales presentation. Left a sour taste in my mouth a bit.

Even in the airport I thought some guy was helping me figure out where to find my shuttle but half way through he started selling me something and I kept trying to exit the conversation and it was very difficult. That's not really anything to do with Live Aqua but I thought I'd mention it.

**One thing I wish I knew before I went**

* If you want a nice spot for the day to chill it's **first come first serve**. Wake up early and get set up by the pool or beach cabana bed early. If you wake up around 10 or so and go eat breakfast it's probably already going to be too late maybe. Once you have that spot though, we would just leave our stuff there and go off and noone would touch it. Only some of the options are premium which include the cabanas with the cloth over them, or the umbrella beds by the pool that face the beach.

Overall we had a blast, we really want to go back again and we definitely will be some time in the future!

Most of my coworkers are pretty chill, and I get along with everyone, including Tom (35M). We work on the same team, but I don’t interact with him too much outside of team meetings and casual office chats. That said, things have gotten really uncomfortable lately, and I’m not sure if I’m overreacting, so I need some advice.

About a month ago, I was sitting at my desk working, and Tom walked by and, without saying anything, reached over and brushed his fingers through my hair. I was stunned, but I didn’t say anything, just awkwardly laughed it off, assuming it was a one-off thing. But then it started happening more and more. Every time he’d walk by my desk, he’d touch my hair, sometimes lightly running his fingers through it. It started feeling weird, but I just didn’t know how to handle it.

Then, one day, it crossed the line. I was in the break room getting coffee, and Tom came up behind me and *smelled* my hair. He just leaned in, took a deep breath, and said something like, “Your hair smells so good. What kind of shampoo do you use?” I was completely horrified. I didn’t know what to say, so I just muttered a quick answer and walked away. I couldn’t believe it.

After that, it only got worse. He would sometimes stand a little too close to me when talking, and I’d catch him sniffing the air around me like he was trying to smell my hair again. He’d even comment on it, like, “Your hair always smells so fresh. I wish I knew what scent that is.” I tried to brush it off, but it felt more and more invasive every time.

Finally, a few days ago, after he did it again during a meeting, I couldn’t stay silent any longer. I felt grossed out and violated. I went to HR and explained the situation, including how Tom had repeatedly touched and smelled my hair without my consent. I told them I felt uncomfortable, and I had tried to ignore it, but it had gone on long enough. HR assured me they’d take care of it.

A couple of days later, Tom came to me, visibly upset. He asked why I went to HR and said, “I didn’t think it was a big deal. I was just complimenting you on your hair, it’s no different than someone saying they like your shoes.” I told him it wasn’t just a compliment, it was an invasion of my personal space, and I had asked him to stop before but he didn’t listen. He then said I was overreacting, that I was making things awkward, and that I should’ve just told him to stop instead of reporting him. A few people from our team have been talking about it, and some say I made a mountain out of a molehill, that I should’ve just handled it directly with him.

Now, I’m feeling conflicted. I don’t want to be the person who overreacts, but I also feel like his behavior was crossing serious boundaries. Was I wrong for going to HR? Should I have just told him to stop?

So, AITA for reporting Tom to management instead of just asking him to stop?",16,1737050438.0,AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC,18,1.0,False

For context, I am 24 years old, autistic with only 3 months work experience from 5 years ago when I was undiagnosed. I worked as a catering assistant and really struggled to show up a lot due to my social anxiety and feeling like I wasn't capable of doing the job properly. It's now 5 years later and I have found a job listing at my local Costa Coffee shop for only 7 hours a week. I do want to get back into work starting with smaller hours first as I want to build it up over time but I know how busy places like Costa and Starbucks can get so I've been on the fence about applying in case I put myself in an environment that I can't handle.

My autism mainly affects me socially and in terms of independence which I've only in the past year or so started showing a lot of progress in. I have been in counselling the past 5 years and have gotten better at managing and tolerating my anxiety but I still feel a sense that I'm not capable of working in a cafe/restaurant environment. I'm struggling to look for a job in this dead town as it is and despite the fact that I'm not required to work at the moment (I'm down as having limited work capability at the job centre) I've always wanted to do something more because I feel like a waste of space not working. I've always wanted to work but have never been able to find something that I feel confident I can deal with. My ideal job at the moment would be in an office doing the same thing every day with the same small group of people with little social interaction but the only jobs I can find in my area are retail and hospitality.

Is there anyone here who works as a barista, in a cafe or does 7 hours per week working with the public? Like, I said, I'm just looking for advice or opinions from experience.

1i2uzar,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1i2uzar/everything_reminds_me_of_him_us/,Everything reminds me of him— us.,"My ex-boyfriend and I broke up recently. We were together for two and a half years, but for the latter part of that time, we knew we were falling out of love— we just couldn't bear to leave each other yet.

Now that we're broken up, I really tried to forget him, but how can I when I see him everywhere I go and in everything I see?

Everything reminds me of who we were before— how we were before. 

In my living room where we watched Jojo Bizarre Adventures, and he tried to explain to me how it's a great anime. In front of my house where he used to visit me after his classes because I was his pahinga (rest). His clothes that I borrowed from him whenever I stayed over his house. The street we used to walk around on. The burger place we always went to. The coffee shop we broke up at. The list goes on and on.

It makes it hard to move on. Fuck. Just how do I dissociate everything from him?

And a combination of events short term and long term are making me consider completely distancing to the point of no contract with my family and I want advice one amnI being over dramatic and two if I should distance, I'm finishing studying in a year what should be my plan of action. 

(Yes, this part is more of rant, but I need to confirm if I'm over exaggerating or not. But check the ** that is the part I actually need help with.) 

So, starting long term part of the reasoning, is the relationship between me and my brother. I'm five years younger than him. He was in a horrible car accident when I was 5 which essentials left him to have to relearn to walk, move and write again, luckily no brain damage. (And after talking to a student counsellor,) I realized that I felt very neglected as a child, partial due me not expressing my need for attention and partial due to my parents having to reraise my brother and smalle stuff like parents missing what I call my first step years. Though my brother and I were still extremely close with shared interest of animes, sports we played and chess. It wasn't untill I was 12 when he tried to unalive himself and I was posted reason number 2 in his thirteen reason why. A lot of stuff happened a late diagnose of Asperger's syndrome and our relationship never really recovered, but it's more pleasent than most, but still strained.

And the short term which could be actually be long term issue. This holiday, my dad ended being in a sour mood due to being called back to work early. We have a great relationship, so I was kinda playing buffer between my dad and my mom arguing, because yes, it isn't nice having someone being pouty about their holiday ending and yes, it might be a bit of a party pooper, but at the same time; we've been working for almost 3 years at getting my dad to be open about his emotions and express his thoughts and trying to explain to my mom that it includes the negative emotions as well. And yes my dad was a Debbie downer, but he wasn't rude or weird, he genuinely just struggling to be more open.

 **The concerning part came, one day in the kitchen after my dad expressing how upset he was this was his last day off, my mom, brother and I were busy cleaning up. My mom made a off hand comment about throwing happy pills in my dad's coffee and I did a dubble take. Long story short we had a fight with me saying saying that's wrong it is essential drugging someone, and my mom reasoning its herbal natural remedy and it helps dad emotions. Which indicated to me this wasn't the first time. Worst is, my brother agreed with her, saying it was for the best.

And it had me thinking, did my mom ever do that with me? I already feel so on edge at home and now this. Is this good even reason to cut of people I love so dearly? Should I tell my dad, because my mom said she would stop, but did she? Idk, I just need advice and validation that despite my family being so loving and kind 90% of the time, this is actually toxic or an I over exaggerating?",1,1737050057.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I'm brand new to Cronometer (a few days in). I upgraded to Gold so I can import recipes. So far I really like most everything about the app and the fact you can use the desktop to add things as well.

The issue I'm having is I'm always in a huge calorie deficit every day. The image above is my food log for the entire day yesterday. I need to lose weight, and I believe most of my weight gain over the years is tied to the weekend in going out and drinking and eating. Throughout the rest of the week, I generally eat the exact same Breakfast and Lunch. I'm at 280 and I set a goal of 240 as a starting point. My issue is, how do I get more healthy calories into my summary? I usually eat an egg and 1/4 apple in the morning along with a cup of coffee with half-n-half. My lunch is typically a tuna salad on about a cup of Spinach, a mozzarella cheese stick, a small orange (I eat a total of 3 oranges throughout the snack/lunch day), and an unsweetened apple sauce snack size thing. Then a dinner that can range all over the place, but last night as an example, was broiled chicken tenders (no skin) with some broiled broccoli and a serving of microwavable spanish rice.  

No soda really ever - just water. 

* Am I just not eating enough? 
* If I have 1405 CAL remaining to reach my goal, I understand that in theory, if I hit that goal dead on every day, I should likely lose weight?
* But what happens when I'm so far under like I am? 
* Any suggestions on healthy/quick snacks or additions to breakfast/lunch that I can incorporate to get me closer to my target?
* If I add in exercise (even just 30 minutes on a treadmill), I'm even further away from my energy (CAL) target.

Protecting your identity in today’s digital world is no joke. From sneaky scammers to accidentally oversharing on social media, the risks are real! 

Let’s dive into the top 10 identity threats you need to dodge like a pro:

# 1. The Too-Good-to-Be-True Email

*“You’ve won $1 million!”* Spoiler alert: No, you haven’t. Clicking that link could make someone else a millionaire—using your bank account.

# 2. Sharing Too Much on Social Media

Your dog’s name + your birthdate + “#NewHouse” = a hacker’s dream. Don't make guessing your passwords as easy as scrolling through your profile.

# 3. Using “123456” as Your Password

Come on, even hackers are rolling their eyes at this one. Invest in a password manager, or at least use something more creative.

# 4. Free Wi-Fi at the Coffee Shop

Public Wi-Fi might be free, but it can cost you dearly if a cybercriminal is lurking. Use a VPN, or stick to your data plan.

# 5. Oversharing Your Kids’ Achievements

Yes, your child’s first-grade report card is adorable, but posting it online may give away personal info like their school or name.

# 6. Phishing Texts

*“Your package is delayed. Click here to fix it!”* Translation: “Click here so we can steal your info.” Ignore and delete.

# 7. Unshredded Mail

Tossing those credit card offers into the trash without shredding them? You’re basically inviting identity thieves to play “dress up” as you.

# 8. Downloading Shady Apps

That app promising to add sparkles to your selfies? It’s actually adding malware to your phone. Stick to reputable sources.

# 9. Not Checking Your Bank Statements

Noticed a charge for $5.37 from “Random Inc.”? That’s probably a test run for something much bigger. Review your statements regularly.

# 10. Reusing the Same Password Everywhere

One password to rule them all = one password to lose them all. A single breach, and it’s game over.

**BONUS TIP:**  
Stay vigilant, trust your instincts, and when in doubt, channel your inner detective. Remember, your identity is yours—don’t let anyone else *steal the show*!

*Be smart, be secure, and keep the hackers guessing! 🕵️‍♀️✨*

My boyfriend and I have been together for 9 months, and I don’t know what to do about this situation.

During the month of November, I began noticing some changes in my boyfriend. He stopped taking care of his apartment, and he began having really bad breath. I had a conversation with him about this, while trying my best to give him the benefit of the doubt. I suggested to him that he may have been struggling from depression.

The conversation went on for hours. He denied having depression, and was offended. He said that I was making “baseless claims” about him, and that he’ll listen to me if I can provide “more evidence”.

Fast forward two months. I haven’t been going over to his apartment, because I have had respiratory allergies and I am concerned about the air quality. He insists that he has been cleaning regularly, but that his roommate is the reason it keeps getting trashed again.

I purchased a cheap mold test kit on Amazon to test the apartment before I start staying over again. But with that being said, I don’t know if I will be staying over again? One of the problems has still remained.

The problem that has still remained is his bad breath. The last time we went on a date, it was a week ago at a coffee shop. Sitting across from him, I had a headache because the odor was so bad.

I haven’t been allowing him to kiss me, in order to protect my own health. I have had numerous polite conversations with him about the bad breath. He seems unconcerned.

He doesn’t believe he has a bad breath problem. He doesn’t believe it, because he says that other people in his life don’t notice. He said that he asked five of his colleagues if he has bad breath, and all of them said “no”.

It sounds as if he basically believes I am making this up. I have no reason to make this up, and I truly am bothered by the problem. I do have a more sensitive sense of smell than most, however.

We got into a pretty heated argument about this over text the other day. At the end of the night, he sent me a sweet text saying that he is committed to doing everything he can to salvage the relationship. We have decided to further the discussion in person, in order to have clearer communication.

Reddit, I don’t know what to say to him? How to I navigate conflict like this with him in the future, considering that his whole argument is centered around how I am the only one who notices?

1i2umpr,https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/1i2umpr/the_commission_for_the_study_of_russian_influence/,The Commission for the Study of Russian Influence has published a partial report on disinformation. Quotes.,"As you may recall, the previous publication at the end of October stirred up a lot of emotions because it was largely about Antoni Macierewicz. Apart from the understandable groans of PiS media workers, there were accusations of politicising the Commission and doing the same thing as Law and Justice, only in the opposite direction. We can cite the critical (and, in my opinion, written to support the thesis) texts by Witold Jurasz in Onet who said that the Commission had been infected by Tomasz Piatek's madness. But also Grzegorz Sroczyński's tiresome interview with one of the commission's members. Adam Leszczyński, in which Sroczyński insisted that the commission's work only increased polarisation and that Leszczyński was serving the Civic Platform party. In the context of Macierewicz's interview, the following exchange took place. among others

>Adam Leszczyński: The next report on disinformation, which we will probably present at the beginning of December. will be presented by a larger group of commission members. And you will see that if it is not about Macierewicz, journalists will not be interested in it. I bet they will. And it will be a big, serious report.  
Grzegorz Sroczyński: And it will probably follow from this that Russian disinformation operated mainly in the ranks of the PiS?   
AL: No.

And imagine that a few days after the publication of this report. Macierewicz's name is not mentioned and - shock and disbelief journalists are not particularly interested in it. On the major portals we find only brief mentions. dry information, sometimes not even signed by an author. Well, the Commission met, showed the report, two sentences of a quote from the conclusions and we refuse to elaborate further. And even in these brief mentions they managed to squeeze in literally one sentence from the entire report, the most clearly critical of PiS. Someone malicious might say that this proves the unobtrusive quality of the Polish media and that the November drama about Macierewicz had more to do with their tendency to seek sensation than with the substantive value of the commission's work, but I am not malicious and I do not want to be called a Tusk-paid scumbag by my relatives again.

Okay, but what does this report say? [Firstly, I urge you to read the whole thing and judge for yourself whether this is really just a Civic Platform attack on PiS.](https://www.gov.pl/attachment/c8ad4e5e-01ee-49d3-ab8a-7ab4d51ab067) It is only 84 pages of text in large print, to be absorbed in one sitting. And it is worth it. Secondly, my assessment is that this is the first official attempt by the Polish state to deal with the problem. The problem of Russian (and Belarusian, and also Chinese) information warfare is real, and we have known about it for a decade. And certainly since the American elections in 2016. Poland has also been a victim of Russian operations for a long time. Whether we mention the 2014 tape scandal or the 2021 email scandal and crisis on the border with Belarus, or numerous disinformation operations on refugees, vaccines, gender, climate, etc., etc., the list is long. It is certainly good news that someone in Poland has finally sat down, read thousands of documents over several months and drawn some conclusions and recommendations.

The report contains a long theoretical introduction explaining what Russian cognitive warfare is. It states very clearly that, contrary to old habits of thought, it should be treated as a hostile and serious action. Its techniques and the scale of its funding (2-4 billion dollars a year) are listed. There is also a list of the main directions of Russian propaganda. And an explanation that in Polish conditions it is difficult to spread it openly, so it is done by means of reflective management, in a roundabout, more subtle way, often in the camouflage of patriotic, anti-imperialist, pacifist, freedom-oriented and other rhetoric.

Much space is devoted to how Poland is prepared to counter these operations. This part contains criticism of PiS, but it is far from being a party squabble. In fact, I would say that this chapter is cautious and softens statements precisely to avoid criticism. So we have a statement that for a large part of the last decade Poland practically did not recognise the problem, and many initiatives have only been taken in the last few years. When some measures were taken, they were underfunded, scattered, uncoordinated and lacked follow-up. For example, in 2019, the Department of Strategic Communication was established in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. But firstly, it employed only three people (three!) and secondly, its activities, like those of other units, remained virtually unanswered. It was also pointed out that various initiatives to combat Russian disinformation bounced off the wall - for example, the report ""Counteracting Disinformation in Poland"", prepared in 2022 by several dozen experts. System Recommendations', all 60 of whose recommendations were presented to a joint committee in the Senate, fell into a complete vacuum. The committee stated that it had found 

>""no trace of discussion or reaction to the experts' proposals for systemic solutions in the government's documentation to date"". 

Or that the NASK Disinformation Prevention Department, created in 2022 (only!), produces weekly reports on disinformation, which the committee found valuable, but its potential is not being fully exploited.

The most critical part for PiS is the assessment of the functioning of the position of the Government Plenipotentiary for the Security of the Information Space of the Republic of Poland, created in 2022 and occupied by Stanisław Żaryn. The Commission notes that Żaryn treated Russian, Belarusian, Chinese and German disinformation equally. This is probably some kind of confusion of orders.

And that his reports 

>""were written in a formulaic and routine (repetitive) manner. Channels, websites, pro-Russian sources in the space were practically not described or thoroughly investigated"".

And that 

>""he paid much more attention to analysing the narrative of the political opposition, especially the parliamentary opposition, and the independent media than to the real disinformation threats directed against Poland. He identified various types of content as internal threats (e.g. texts about the lack of professionalism of the Polish Army personnel, the Prime Minister's Office, nepotism, failure to maintain standards in the selection of people for managerial positions in state treasury companies)"".

It went on to say that in the 2023 election year, Żaryn 

>""also focused on issues related to the narrative and campaign activities of opposition parties. For example, in the analysis of 4 October 2023, the proxy recommended, among others, strengthening communication about the strong and dominant position of the United Right"". 

And: 

>""However, the recommendations did not contain any proposals on the actions of state institutions in the field of detecting, neutralising and countering disinformation repeating the Belarusian and Russian message.""

Is this critical of Żaryn and the actions of the then PiS government? Yes, it is. Is it written from a political point of view, with the aim of feeding the hardcore Civic Coalition voters with a story about PiS as a Russian agent? Or is it out of concern that the Polish state should finally approach the burning problem with due attention, enthusiasm and reason, and learn from the mistakes of previous years? I'm asking for a friend.

Is the statement partisan?: 

>“To sum up, counteracting disinformation threats from Russia and Belarus in the period analysed by the Commission was insufficient, ad hoc, inconsistent, and often feigned in Poland. It certainly was not long-term and systemic in nature. No coordinated defensive actions were taken in the cognitive warfare waged by Russia and Belarus by either the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the plenipotentiary, who did not go beyond general recommendations for monitoring, training and cooperation. No recognition was made of attempts at hostile reflexive management of Polish elites openly announced in the Russian strategy documents, and threats in the area of ​​science and higher education were ignored.”

And in the light of the above, is there anything controversial in the statement? 

>""The most serious active torpedoing of the Polish and NATO defence in the field of cognitive warfare was the destruction - even by physical invasion - of the NATO Counter Intelligence Centre of Excellence, which was being set up in Warsaw to deal with countering the information warfare of the Russian Federation""? 

Well, sorry, but whether you like Prime Minister Tusk or not, Antoni Macierewicz broke into this NATO CI COE. And if you look at it more broadly, in the context of the Polish state's feeble attempts to combat Russian propaganda, you can see how disastrous the consequences have been. But remember, if you think like that, you are a bunch of trolls paid by the KO staff, just like me.

In the following parts of the report we will find, for example, a description of how, during the Podlasie crisis, the state embargo on information created a space that Russian-Belarusian propaganda was free to fill. Or a description of how this disinformation came to the fore during the pandemic and how the state did little to stop it. Or examples of Russian interference in elections in Moldova, Romania and Georgia.

Or a list of internet portals involved in spreading Russian propaganda. As someone who is involved in this in some way, I can say that yes, these are portals that spread Russian propaganda. Your overview is valuable because it shows that the message is spread through many channels. So we have a representation of the ""kresowiacy"", a well-known pseudo-law firm, several extreme right-wing and at least one left-wing blogs, the Korwinist Najwyższy Czas, a site associated with the Ordo Iuris, Myśl Polska and many others, most of which I know.

I suggest you see for yourself, page 33.

And imagine that Bodnar's ministry could have listed Wpolitice, Niezależna, or other TV Republika, but for some mysterious reason they did not. And, similarly to the above, there is a sense here of keeping the rhetoric down rather than turning it up.

Below is an example of a content analysis of websites with a description of the methodology. And from this analysis it follows that, for example, one of the nationalist outlets does NOT spread Russian propaganda. It was more or less at this point in the report that I began to feel confused, because if it was written to support a thesis coming from Donald Tusk's hand, then that thesis is incomprehensible to me.

The report ends with a list of ten recommendations. In short, they point to the need to organise the state's activities, their coordination, education, subsidies, etc., and to improve communication between the state and society. The latter is all the more regrettable because the key role in this process should be played by the media, which are independent of the state. It is with a constant lack of satisfaction that I note that the Polish media are failing this test en masse, which I will finally write about soon.

But it's not as if NO ONE reacted. Well, there were serious accusations. And they sound like this. First: that there is plagiarism in the report. If I understand Żaryn and Cenckiewicz correctly, the plagiarism is that Mr Michał Wojnowski of the Internal Security Agency wrote in the Internal Security Review (a journal published by the ISA) about Russian cognitive warfare. In the text, he referred to a Russian source and quoted its fragment translated into Polish. The Commission's report also quoted this fragment, in this translation, citing the Russian source as the source, not Wojnowski's article. I don't know whether this is formally plagiarism, but I think we agree that it is a detail.

The second accusation is that, by complete coincidence, TV Republika has just published the news that the Commission has commissioned some analyses from external persons, including: Tomasz Piątek, Marcin Celiński, Klementyna Suchanow and Anna Mierzyńska. Let's start by correcting a few manipulations. Well, according to what Celiński writes, he did not carry out an order, so nobody paid him, so Republika is lying. Republika calls the one-off payments of around 8,000 (Piątek and Suchanow) and 15,000 (Mierzyńska) ""generous"", but we do not know WHAT exactly they were paid for. That is, how much work the authors had to put into the analyses they were commissioned to do. Piątek writes that he worked on his for ""many months"". Even if he only worked for one month, I see nothing wrong with 8,000 PLN (as I understand it, gross) for one month of substantial work. If he worked for two months, that's practically the minimum wage. The channel resorted to far-reaching manipulations to discredit the authors. The best example is probably Anna Mierzyńska, who in 2022 ""defended GRU officer Pavel Rubtsov"". 'Cause you understand, Mierzyńska has been working for OKO press for about 8 years, during which time she wrote hundreds of very valuable articles, exposed various pro-Russian groups, websites, narratives, lies, disinformation, etc. ... and suddenly in 2022, according to the logic of TV Republika, she decided to reveal her true pro-Russian orientation by defending GRU officer Pavel Rubtsov. After that she did nothing for the next two and a half years, continuing to write dozens of valuable and clearly anti-Russian article. Well, it sounds credible. Someone malicious could say that maybe Mierzyńska made a mistake once. Or that she did not defend the GRU officer because the confirmation that Rubtsov worked for the GRU came much later. Or that she wasn't so much defending him as demanding that the legal basis for his detention be revealed. But I'm not being malicious.

Of course, Tomasz Piątek aroused the most emotions. I really understand that Piątek often draws far-reaching conclusions and has a tendency to write complex and obscure digressions. But no matter how critical one may be of his books or articles, the fact remains that the wealth of information we have about Russian influence in Polish politics first saw the light of day thanks to him. And also that the later findings of other journalists were basically in line with his main findings. There is, of course, a non-zero probability that the commission was, as Jurasz put it in November, ""infected with Piątek's paranoia"". And that all its members, and these are undoubtedly people of public trust, swallowed some unverified information without a second thought. And that it was approved by the services (the head of the Commission is, after all, the head of the Military Counterintelligence Service). And by the Ministry of Justice. And by the government. And that one Piątek deceived the whole world and only journalists from TV Republika discovered it. But it's probably more likely that he was asked to prepare an analysis on a subject he had an objective understanding of, and that was it. For the sake of clarity, let us add that the main accusation by Republika was that Piątek wrote novels during the PO-PSL government and did not ""pretend to be an investigative journalist"".

Of course, this sudden ""revelation"" has no other purpose than to discredit the Commission's work. In order to create a spin that they are usually, you know, paid to write some madness, the sheeple swallow it as they go, and Tusk's sinister face emerges from a cloud of tobacco smoke. First of all, it is dangerous. Members of the Commission are already receiving death threats, and I think we can safely assume that we know from whom. Surely there is no need for such discrediting as the PiS swindlers are now doing. Secondly, it is of course complete nonsense. The commission has been working for about half a year. During this time, its members have analysed thousands of documents from dozens of public and private institutions. Based on the reading of this vast amount of information, analyses, consultations with experts, etc., the Commission has published a report full of rather cautious and uncontroversial conclusions. A report which, let us not forget, represents only a small part of their work. The assumption that they all, I don't know, sat down for a coffee, someone brought them some crazy conspiracy theories, they looked at them, then put them on the Internet and let the PiS's asses burn - well, I find this assumption idiotic. Really, I don't see any paranoia or partisanship in the report. But I do see recommendations as to what the Polish state should do in order to finally deal properly with the Russian information war. And I think that's why this commission was set up.

That's more or less how it is. It is with absolute dissatisfaction that I repeat that Leszczyński, quoted at the beginning, was right. When the previous partial report concerned Macierewicz, the media gave it 100% of their attention. Respected public opinion leaders criticised the Commission for becoming a political tool of Tusk. That it was doing the same thing as PiS drones like Cenckiewicz, Michał Rachoń and Andrzej  Zybertowicz, only in the opposite direction. People wrung their hands, saying that an important issue had been drowned in the political tide. Barely two months later, a report was published that clearly explained what Poland was doing wrong in terms of Russian influence, what the consequences were and what should be done to improve the situation.

Well, Macierewicz's name is not mentioned.

And basically there is media silence.

I've lived with a partner before, but it was a long time ago and we were college kids. I've lived alone for nearly 5 years now, and I'm worried it'll be hard for me to adapt to living with someone else again. I also don't have any in-person friends, so I'm hopeful that I can make some friends in my new city. I've visited him there many times so I know the city well, and I'm fluent in Spanish so I won't have any problems in that area. Finding a job will also be easy for me as my area of work is in high demand. 

My biggest area of worry is his family, specifically his mother. He came out to them about two years ago, a few weeks before I came to visit for the first time. I'm the only significant other he's ever had, and he never showed any signs of being bisexual/gay before, so his parents were shocked. His mother especially doesn't like that I'm from another country. She doesn't speak English at all, which is fine since I do speak Spanish except she doesn't seem to believe that I actually speak it well. Every time I visit, she doesn't really interact with me. I hope that I can break through and make a relationship with her, even if we never become close. I just want her to see that I'm trustworthy and really love her son and want to take care of him. 

I've been selling my belongings that I can't take with me like crazy, but things aren't moving fast enough. I'm also bringing my cat with me, and the cat hates traveling so it's gonna suck at first. But I know he'll be okay. We've moved around a lot and he always settles in. My partner is very excited to have a cat. 

The city I'm moving to is the most beautiful place I've ever seen. It's also the number one country in the world for LGBT rights, which is important to me. I've always wanted to leave the US because I have never fit in here, so I'm looking forward to this change. 

Most of all, I'm looking forward to all the time I'll get to spend with my partner. We'll finally be able to sleep together at night, make each other breakfast, and have coffee together on our balcony. We'll be within walking distance of the beach, too, so we can go on walks at sunset on the beach. We've made it work long distance and it's always been worth it for him, but being together every day is something for which I've been longing for years. It's a dream come true. I never imagined this could happen to me. 

This is a big step for our relationship, and I'm aware of the risks. I'm not worried about our relationship going sour though. He's so reliable, trustworthy, and steady, and we both feel completely at ease with each other. He's more than just a pretty face (and he is smoking hot). I've found the love of my life, the one that's worth fighting for, and I'm not letting go. Yes, I'm a little afraid. I'm moving to a different country, and living there is of course going to be different than visiting. Change is always a little scary, but I know it's the best move. I'm also confident in my ability to do this. If the worst were to happen, I would be able to do it alone. But I know that I've got his back and he's got mine. He's the one I can count on, the one I want to build a life with. Finally, after dating so many guys who flaked out when it got real, l've found the guy who matches my energy and commitment. So yeah, for him, I'm willing to sacrifice everything. 

I've built a comfortable life here in the states. My cat and I don't want for anything. But I'm leaving it all behind for love. I'm confident as I venture out into the unknown, because I know he's waiting for me, and as long as we have each other, there's nothing we can't do together.",2,1737049449.0,GayMen,4,1.0,False

TBH, it pains me to leave Portland and I’m worried about getting homesick. The following is a list of some things that I love about Portland.

**Based on the list, can you give me suggestions for spots in the area where some of these things might exist? (I care most about art-related spaces and creative communities.)**

Feel free to go through each item and tell me whether or not something is existent or not in the burbs. From my research so far, I know there are a few thrift stores and pop-up markets. (Sidenote: I’m looking forward to checking out the nature parks and trails in the area. Also, I will definitely check out the Library and Schute Park.)

Things I like about Portland:

1. Going on walks and looking at creative gardens and front yards. (I worry that HOAs squelch this kind of thing.)

2. Street art like stickers on stop sign poles. Also, stencils, posters etc. (This is probably a longshot in the burbs, right?)

3. Free libraries

4. Walkable areas, in general (I heard Downtown Beaverton is my best bet for this.)

5. Running into an outdoor cat on my walk. Giving them a pet (if they allow it).

6. Art pop-ups and markets with local artist vendors

7. Vintage and thrift stores, especially stores where I can find cheap art/craft supplies. (I love Village Merchants, SCRAP and Reclaim It in Portland.)

8 Ceramics studios that have affordable classes or open studios (for adults)

9. Local craft-related businesses in general

10. Stores that sell items made by local artists

11. Coming across local newspapers like Willamette Weekly, and flyers for local events (I usually find these at local coffee shops in Portland.)

**Bonus question: 
Is the drive from Hillsboro to the east side of Portland bad? Compare it to the driving from Tigard. **

IMO,  it seems easier to get to the east side of Portland from Tigard.  My partner thinks the drive from Hillsboro to the east side wouldn’t be that bad. I suppose I could get used to it, but I’d love your opinions about this also. (I have a car btw)

TLDR:
I care about art spaces and art communities. I want to be able to access the East side of Portland somewhat easily. How much of a culture shock will it be? Which place is less of a culture shock?",5,1737049273.0,askportland,13,0.73,False

Side note, will be significant later, narc family friend borrowed a piece of equipment from me for the upcoming surgery, before the sick family member got bad. I did so happily, in service of a friend with no request for anything in return, that is how this family friendship has worked for years, we help and support each other.

A close family member has been sick with cancer for a few months. In an effort to help them, I stepped up to handle the updates of ER visits, treatments etc., so that sick family member’s spouse wasn’t bombarded with tons of inquiries by text, all day, every day, and could focus on helping sick family member as they were treated. I work in the medical field and have a better understanding of what is going on so that I can help with questions from other family members. Keep in mind, there are approximately 50 or so family members and around 20 in the close friend group. Potentially 70+ updates. They are all concerned for sick family member’s well being and the outpouring of support and love is generous and so helpful during this difficult time. 

I created several group chats with sick family member’s spouse explicitly stating please channel all inquiries through me bc sick family member’s spouse is overwhelmed and very stressed with all the technical jargon. 

I reached out to family friend narc who is close with sick family member’s spouse. I asked if they could invite spouse over for a regular coffee chat (they do this a few times a week) to just give sick family member’s spouse a little break and some normalcy. Narc did this. But went out of their way to ask about sick family member’s condition, like specific medical questions which really stress out spouse. Spouse did not put the inquiry to a stop in the moment, just took it on and added more to their plate = added stress.

Then, narc turned the family friend group chat into a chat about their upcoming elective surgery (referenced equipment above). (They had postponed the surgery for months in order to travel overseas and to Caribbean. Not urgent at all.) Narc stated their spouse would update in this chat during/after the surgery while they were recovering. This was happening while sick family member was still unstable and in and out of the ER and Oncologist office for treatment. The risk at that point was stroke and heart attack based on the symptoms for sick family member.

A day later, narc texted sick family member’s spouse trying to stir drama and create/fuel rumors based on non facts about another family member. This stressed out sick family member’s spouse greatly. I had to help console this spouse about the drama as well as help console about sick family member’s condition.

I have since ghosted narc family friend, not provided updates, not responded to inquiries, any attempt to engage and abandoned the pirated group chat. I am so pissed about them overstepping 3 specific boundaries, directing inquiries to me as spouse requested trying to stir nonsense drama and directly asking specific medical questions directly to spouse when asked not to. 
It feels disrespectful to my family and their wishes. Narc has tried making joking texts to bait me to get my attention. I’ve been a grey rock. Honestly, I have lost all respect for narc.

2-3 weeks later, sick family member is stable, treatment is working and they are feeling better but not 100%. So no ER visits, mostly Oncology and other docs. Sick family member’s spouse went to visit family friend narc and brought back the borrowed equipment. Spouse also produced a gift from family friend narc for me.

I really don’t want the gift. It feels like a hook a narc uses to engage with me and I don’t want to owe them anything. I don’t want to engage at all. 

If I drop off the gift at narc’s home WIBTA?

Do I give it to sick family member’s spouse to return? 

What do I do to not be indebted to this narc? They seem like the kind that would be insulted if I returned the gift, but if I keep it they seem like they would dangle it over my head. 

Edit: sick family member’s spouse is more of a “keep the peace/don’t rock the boat” kinda person.

We’re planning a 16-day trip to Australia in March, flying in from Queenstown, NZ and leaving from Sydney. It’s our first time in Australia, and we want to make the most of our trip while balancing iconic sights with some relaxation. Here’s what we’re thinking so far:

1. **Great Barrier Reef & Port Douglas** – Spend a few days exploring the reef, relaxing in Port Douglas, and enjoying the tropical vibe. This is our priority! 
2. **The Outback/Uluru** – We’d love to experience the Red Centre, see Uluru, and learn more about the cultural and natural significance of the area.
3. **Melbourne** – Explore the city, see Phillip Island for the penguins, and maybe enjoy some of the famous coffee and art scene. Maybe drive a day on the Great Ocean Road (not the entire thing).
4. **Sydney** – Finish the trip in Sydney, taking in the Opera House, Harbour Bridge, and the surrounding beaches. Maybe 1-2 nights max, though. 

We’re open to flying between destinations to save time, but we’re wondering if this itinerary is too ambitious or if we’re missing anything must-see. Also:

* How many days should we allocate to each destination?
* Are there specific airlines, routes, or tips for getting around that you’d recommend?
* Was is the best order to visit these places?

It wasn’t much—just a small one-bedroom on the third floor of an old building that had seen better days. The rent was cheap for the area, and I’d been looking for something affordable and cozy. I had my own space, my own routine, and that was exactly what I wanted. No roommates, no noise, just me, a few cigarettes and my beloved cat Chicken Nugget, who I adopted last fall.

The apartment had a certain charm, though it was hard to pinpoint exactly what created the illusion of the same. The walls were a pale butter yellow, and the ceilings heavily popcorned. A combination that reminded me of the hungover mornings I spent at my aunt's mismatched home. A monstrosity that often looked like adorable bits of patchwork sewn together, had somehow come to life and now resembled something close to a cottage.

The hardwood floors creaked under my feet, especially in the hallway, but that only made it feel more lived-in. The kitchen was small, but the sunlight that streamed in through the window in the mornings made up for the lack of space. I spent hours organizing my spices, placing my coffee mugs just so, trying to make it feel as homey as possible. I even painted the cabinets a soft mint green, something I’d seen on Pinterest, and added little gold handles to make them feel special. It was a small thing, but it made me feel accomplished, like I was doing life right.

The living room was where I spent most of my time. It had the best light in the apartment. I’d rearranged the furniture a few times before settling on a cozy setup—a cream-colored sofa with throw pillows in muted shades of pink and mustard yellow. The rug I found at a flea market had this faded floral pattern, and though it wasn’t perfect, it brought the room together. I spent an afternoon putting up fairy lights around the window, a little touch to make it feel magical when the night came.

It wasn’t perfect, but it was mine. I loved it.

At first, I didn’t even notice the apartment across the street. The building was an old brownstone, just like mine, with narrow windows and ivy creeping up the sides. It had been vacant when I moved in, and I’d seen no sign of life from behind the windows. But then, one night, after I’d finished unpacking the last of the boxes, I glanced out the window and saw a light. A warm, golden glow. I thought it was strange. The apartment had been empty, hadn’t it? But I shrugged it off. People forget to turn off lights all the time.

The next night, the light was still there. And this time, I saw something more—a figure, sitting still, staring into the dim room. I could barely make it out from the distance, but I was sure it was a person. A person in the same position, in the same place. I wasn’t sure what to think of it, so I decided it was probably nothing. I was new to the neighborhood. Maybe the place across the street had a resident now. Or maybe it was just someone who left the light on by accident.

But the next few nights, the figure was still there. It was always the same—a silhouette in the soft light. Sometimes sitting, sometimes standing, but always in the same spot. The longer I looked, the more uncomfortable I felt, like there was something about it that didn’t quite add up. Still, I ignored it. I was just being paranoid. There was nothing strange about a person sitting in their window.

One evening, a week or so later, I was sitting on my couch, scrolling through my phone, when I looked up and saw something that made my heart skip a beat. The apartment across the street—the one with the figure—had changed. The blinds were open a little wider than usual. I could see into the apartment now, and there it was.

The furniture.

It was identical.

The couch, the same shade of cream as mine, only it was a little more worn around the edges, like it had been used more. The rug, though smaller, was the same faded floral pattern. The coffee table—exactly like the one in my living room—dark wood with the same little scratches on its surface. The lamp in the corner, with the same brass base. The throw pillows, the same muted pink and mustard yellow.

I felt my stomach drop. There was no way. No way that could be a coincidence.

I stood up from the couch, pressing my forehead against the window as I looked across the street, trying to see more. But the figure was still there, sitting in front of the window. This time, I could see them more clearly. A woman, perhaps in her mid-thirties, with long brown hair pulled back into a ponytail. She was looking straight ahead, her back rigid. I couldn’t see her face, but something about her posture reminded me of myself when I was lost in thought, staring out the window, just trying to exist in the moment. 

I didn’t know what to think. Maybe she was just like me—another person, trying to make her space feel like home. Maybe it was nothing. But something about it felt… off.

Over the next few days, I became more and more obsessed with the apartment across the street. I found myself peeking through the blinds at night, trying to see what they were doing. Every time I looked, the apartment looked more and more like mine. The same placement of furniture, the same colors, the same little details. It was like I was looking into a mirror that shouldn’t have existed. Even the kitchen, the way the sink was placed in front of the window, and the shelf I had mounted above it to hold my plants—it was all the same.

One afternoon, I decided to try and distract myself. I grabbed some paint and a brush and began to touch up the trim around the windows. It had gotten a little chipped, and I wanted everything to look fresh. The idea of making my place *nicer* soothed me. The yellow walls seemed warmer in the sunlight, the mint green cabinets looked a little more polished, and the plants on the windowsill made it feel like a little garden. I worked slowly, making sure each stroke was perfect. When I was done, I stood back and admired the little details. It wasn’t just a place to live—it felt like a reflection of me. 

That evening, when I sat on the couch with a cup of tea, I glanced out the window again, almost against my will. The apartment across the street—again, the blinds were open wider than usual, and I could see inside more clearly.

There it was.

The exact same trim, freshly painted. The same plants on the windowsill, sitting in the same spots. The same yellow walls. The same mint green cabinets, the same vase on the counter. Everything was just… *right*. Too right.

And the figure? She was sitting there, too, but this time, her head was tilted, like she was looking directly at me. For a long moment, I just stood there, heart pounding in my chest. I couldn’t breathe. It was like she was staring into my soul, as if she knew I was looking, as if she knew I’d *noticed*.

I stepped back from the window, trembling, my thoughts spinning. How could this be? I’d never been inside that apartment. I couldn’t have. There was no way she could have all the same furniture, all the same details, right down to the same color paint.

I had to see it for myself.

I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. That *she* was wrong. So, the next day, I crossed the street, heart racing with every step. I don’t know why I did it—I just needed to. Maybe I thought I could find an explanation. Maybe I thought I was being foolish.

I reached the door, and my hand hesitated over the handle. I don’t even know why I was nervous. I was just going to knock. Just going to see who lived there. But when I twisted the handle and pushed open the door, the room inside was… empty. The walls were bare. The furniture was gone. 

I stood there, confused. My heart was racing. The apartment across the street wasn’t just familiar—it was *empty*.

And as I turned to leave, I heard it. A voice, soft and whispering, coming from the empty room.

it was my last class & i had my drink out in my other classes taking sips of it now & again, so i thought it was okay to do. but i felt awkward cuz it was a can of monster so in this class i left it on the floor under my desk because i coupdnt put it in my bag because it would spill.

it was 5 minutes before class ended so i took a sip of it so i could put it in my bag before i go. my teacher came down and in front of the whole class started asking me what the drink was and i said it was an energy drink and she said yoir not allowed them and i said oh sorry i didn't know 

then like 2 minutes later she came back down to me agqin(i didn't drink the drink again after she came down to me the first time)and started questioning how i didn't know it wasn't allowed then why was i hiding it and i just said i didn't wanna put it in my bag or else it would spill and that i don't normally drink tjem it's just cause i'm so tired and she just said 'then get some sleep' and she started telling me how bad they are for me and then she said drink tea or coffee instead and she said this in fromt of my whole class 

it really embarrassed me and made me feel uncomfortable like i never drink tjem it's just cause i was so tired and if i had known we weren't allowed tjem i would of pur it in my bag but i had it oht in other classes and nobody told me anything was wrong w it and were allowed normal fizzy drinks on our desks anyway like coke etc

am i the wrong? also PSA i did not drink it multiple times in this class i onky drank it the one time and that was at the end of class ",2,1737048587.0,Advice,6,1.0,False

1i2u8hh,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1i2u8hh/starting_now_lets_go/,Starting now - Let's go!!,"# Here we go,

This past summer I turned 30. And even before that I've been struggling and just going up-up-up since covid hit in 2020. Before that I was at a comfortable 90kgs/198 lbs. 

I've recently also gone back to uni to redirect my career and it hit me this fall really how out of shape I've become and how my body aches and doesn't really feel great. 

So, I'm looking for some guidance / verification of my plans that they are both sustainable and realistic from you guys who are loosing it and those who've lost it already. 

I've tried for many years, researched this and that and gone keto, gone OMAD, tried a multitude of stuff but in my experience it has always been a one step forward two steps back journey. 

I'll admit that my biggest struggle is food. Love food. I love it alone, I love it with friends and I would even say my food habits in terms of what I eat isn't even all that bad. Could do with more nutrition in my daily life, but other than that my day to day food is home cooked, little to no processed foods. I could use a lot more greens to be honest, but that's basically the only drawback, in my honest obviously biased opinion. 

But, I overeat like a mothaf\*cka. To a degree where I looked at my portion size the other day and was genuinly shocked by the size of it. And this needs to end. But since I've tried before, even with some success, I want a sustainable way forward and I will list what I've come up with and I'll gladly take any input you guys have. If you have advice, suggestions or just something that you believe will help please don't hesitate to tell!

Why?

* I want to look slimmer, back to my old self. 
* I'm at the age in my country where soon it's time to eventually start a family and I really want to be healthy for that.
* Well being. Just general well being both mentally and physically.

# My plan to achieve this, in however long it will take comes here:

In terms of calories, what is my plan?

I've calculated using this TDEE calculator (https://tdeecalculator.net/) and I've accounted for a sedentary job. This puts me at 2,841 per day to maintain my current state. I've also read along here and on other places that 1500 seems to be the male minimum. So, without alot of thought, it seems reasonable to not go as low as that, but still go a bit lower. So, let's put it at an even 2000 calories per day. 

In terms of what I am gonna eat, I'm thinking to follow a mealplan that is generally low-carb, but doesn't exclude anything, as described in the FAQ ""**General Low-carb**"" because I think I could adjust my current diet with removing parts of the rice or pasta and replacing it with veggies.   
  
I actually mealprep most weeks. There are one that occur most frequently in my kitchen:

* Chili con carne with rice 
* Spaghetti Bolognese (sorta)  
* ""korean"" minced meat rice bowl 
* Swedish ""Sausage stroganoff"" with rice.

I generally only eat lunch and dinner as it is today. Never really been a breakfast guy. As I'm Swedish my breakfast usually contains of a black coffee and snus (or the OCCASIONAL cigarette in the mornings, I'm not a fulltime smoker by any means).

Should I introduce a breakfeast, or should I keep it as it is and turn it into an intermittent fasting schedule with and eating window from 12.00-18.00 (6 hours window from 12 midday to 6 in the evening.)

The few things that have actually worked before has been IF. in 2022 I think I lost somewhere along the lines of 20kg doing it but then a depression hit and I ate that progress up real quick. 

But I would be okay doing a 1200-1800 eating window and nothing for the rest apart from coffee. 

But I'll try and find a mealplan somewhat similar to what I have today but with less sugar and less carbs, and add vegetables as a part of the meal. Thinking about adding broccoli, peppers, cucumber, brusselsprouts. Any more great veggies that are cheap and filling that fit into this kind of diet? Carrots?

I think I have a kitchen scale from my previous attempts. Otherwise I guess I'll buy one. This is a hard thing for me. I just don't like fiddling with weighing everything but I guess it's needed and i'll try and build a routine about it. Anyone got any tips for maintaining this? For meal prep, I would assume I weigh the carb, then zero it, weigh another part of the meal, etc so I know how much a box of food created by me contains?

How large should a lunch / dinner be in terms of caloric size? Since I've got 2000 calories to work with, 1K for each meal seems almost excessive so maybe I should spread it out and include a snack-time or something?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# Excercise:

So, my plan is this. 

I could have access to a gym, but currently the wallet seems to be echoing a bit so I'd rather not tbh.

I've found an excercise schedule with some ""home workouts"" containing of: Squats, Reverse Lunge, Press Up, Tricep Dip, Jump Squats, Plank Hold, Walking Lunge, Step Ups, Ab Crunch, Burpee, Bicycle Crunch, Sprint on the spot. 

Apart from this I actually walk some each day, but not anything super regular. I plan to introduce a 30-45 minute walk each day. 

And as an extra, friends have started going swimming a few times a week and have been hounding me about joining and it was suprisingly cheap so I plan to go swimming a few times a week. 

With this in mind, do I need to add more food or should that be alright, is the minimum of 1500 regardless of excercise or not? 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

This is what i've come up with. As long as I weigh and log my caloric intake and keep it where I want, follow it 99 days out of 100 I guess I should be on a good path to success? 

Am I missing something? 

Should I add something?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
  
Alcohol:   
  
Also, I do partake in a pub-quiz on a weekly basis. I could of course drink water, but I do love me a beer or two. How do I tackle this? Fine to take a few pints and log them, and deduce the food or how would you handle it? I do like wine as well but as far as my knowledge goes alcohol = sugar = calories. Heard there's a guinness thing going around and I do already consome guinness on the regular. Maybe low ammounts and cherish those I get? :D By no means an alcoholic, but yeah ya'll get the jist of it. 

So, if you got down here, kudos to you! What I do think I need is something with as little of a hassle as possible, as that is what i've had most success with before. When doing something more advanced, tracking everything on a macro level I get discouraged very quickly and stop. I'm aware I do need discipline, and tonnes of it. 

Please help! :D

(I've read the FAQ/Wiki, and could not find anything about these kind of posts. I just want input if this is viable, or if I've forgotten about something. )

The session was primarily led by the architect and developers, with input from other stakeholders. The purpose of the meeting was to gather community feedback before the developers approach the city to request an amendment to the original plan for the space.

**Background on the Original Plan**

* The city had approved a plan for a 25,000 sq. ft. supermarket space (approximately 15,000 sq. ft. for customer use and the rest for backroom/storage).
* Aldi was originally set to occupy the space and invested nearly seven figures in preparing it to their specifications. However, they withdrew for unspecified reasons.
* The developers showed the space to over 100 grocers (at the national, regional, and local levels). While some negotiations advanced, no agreements were finalized. 
* Many reasons grocers aren't interested in this space include: being too big for the amount of foot traffic and population density or the layout doesn't work for their purposes (was originally built to Aldi's specs).



**The New Proposal**

* **Smaller Space for the Supermarket:** The developers propose using an 11,000 sq. ft. space closer to Southwest Park. This space:
* Has more foot traffic (it faces SouthWest park)
* Features a rectangular layout for easier use.
* Includes a basement, meaning the full 11,000 sq. ft. could be used for customer service (similar to the size of a Trader Joe’s).
* If the community supports the new plan, the developers will seek city council approval. Once approved, they will re-engage grocers to negotiate a lease.



**Other Potential Uses for the Larger Space**

* **Hoboken Department of Education:** The superintendent attended and expressed interest in leasing the 25,000 sq. ft. space to create eight pre-K classrooms for approximately 150 students. This would help address the need for more pre-K space in Hoboken, as they currently have approx. 1,000 pre-k students.



**Community Concerns**

* **Traffic:** Traffic and parking dominated much of the discussion. Developers clarified that traffic studies, conducted by the city, will follow plan approval and take 6–8 weeks. A follow-up community meeting will address traffic concerns & solutions.
* **Parking:** A parking garage with 300 spaces (serving residents, retail, and commercial tenants) is already built above the 25,000 sq. ft. area.



**Building Layout**

**Ground Level:** Main entrance through a glass atrium with access to:

*  25,000 sq. ft. space (potential pre-K classrooms).
* 11,000 sq. ft. supermarket space.
* 1,800 sq. ft. retail space (likely for a coffee shop).
* 3,700 sq. ft. restaurant space.
* Three additional retail shops.

**Upper Levels:**

* Top two floors: Commercial spaces.
* Middle floors: Residential spaces.



**Timeline**

* Construction completion: June/July 2025.
* Residential move-in: Shortly after construction ends.
* Smaller retail spaces: Expected occupancy by late 2025/early 2026.
* Larger spaces (including pre-K or supermarket): Occupancy projected for 2026.

  
**Additional Notes:**

* The architect works and lives in Hoboken and has built other spaces in Hoboken; at least one of the developers live in Hoboken, directly across this space. I personally appreciate that people who have a skin in the game are at the table where these discussions are being had.",13,1737048101.0,Hoboken,5,1.0,False

We met at work and have been socialising outside of work for a year - I have since left that company so I only ever see her when we meet up.

The problem is, whenever I suggest a restaurant or a coffee shop to meet at, she always rejects my ideas and suggests a place she likes. I’m easy-going so if I’m not really into an edgy gen-Z type coffee shop, I’ll still go because my main focus is hanging out. And coffee is coffee no matter where you go. But my friend will not budge when what I suggest isn’t up to her standards. And it’s not like I’m suggesting going for a walk in the freezing cold or a greasy kebab shop; I recently suggested a nice-looking pancake place - and I thought it’d be fun for a girly hangout. But she rejected it. In fact she said she wouldn’t be seen dead there. Bit dramatic, it’s just pancakes! She has lived in my city all her life as a local whether as I’m a foreigner, so I don’t know how locals see certain restaurants. But even if I were in my home city and a friend suggested somewhere I wouldn’t go as a local, I’d be open-minded and give it a go - or if I really didn’t want to go, I’d just say ‘you know what, this isn’t really my kinda place but you enjoy!’. I wouldn’t say ‘oh I wouldn’t be seen dead there’.

It just feels like she has such high standards in cafes and restaurants that she won’t accept other people’s ideas. Don’t get me wrong, as a foreigner it’s great to get some restaurant tips from a local, but sometimes it’d be nice if we could do what I want to do! And it’s pancakes - it’s gonna be good either way. 

The ironic thing is she mentioned what a student place the pancake place is. But the edgy cafe she suggested that I ended up going to (because I’m not a control freak) was FULL of students. So her ‘it’s too studenty’ reasoning doesn’t stand up. It really seems like she is just being picky and controlling. She obviously thinks she’s ‘cool’ and ‘edgy’ so couldn’t possibly go somewhere she doesn’t deem as cool.

She did it before when she mentioned ice skating. I said why not go to the big indoor one where you can actually skate. But she said, no I like the cute small one at the Christmas market. She suggested a ramen restaurant; ramen isn’t my favourite food but I thought why not, haven’t tried it in a while. When someone suggests an idea to me, unless it’s extreme like skydiving, my first response isn’t to shut it down; I think ‘why not give it a go?’ But my friend clearly only wants to be friends with me if we do what she wants. The only idea I had that did pass her standards, was an afternoon tea I hosted at my house, but it was because she happens to love scones. But any cafes or restaurants I suggest get 👎🏻 rejected.

I feel a bit fed up because I can’t have a friendship with someone who is always controlling the situation. And only in it for their own selfish desires. I know it’s just a difference in taste but with how dramatic she is with her responses, it comes off kinda judgemental, like I’m not good enough. Do you know what I mean? It’s so hard to put into words.

 I'm currently 20 years old, never had a boyfriend, and the only interest a guy had ever shown to me was a guy that just flirts with lots of girls. Tbh I guess I'm bisexual even though I like more men than women, like 20% women and 80% men. I wouldn't date a girl, but damn I was close to it, and I didn't even know. This is why I'm making this post. Even though I have the social skills of a washing machine, there were at least two chances where I could've dated a girl, which is not too much, but it's still odd. And I realized that years later.

Exhibit A: I fumbled a tomboy back in high school. That's exactly what happened. I had to be like 14-15, and it seemed that I had more game than now. I didn't  give a fuck about sexuality even though my family is homophobic. I liked her just by looking at her. She had to be 16-17 at the time. So with the help of my best friend at the time, I wouldn't say anything but I'd give her sticky notes with cute doodles in it. Nothing too romantic except one with a lil character that was offering a flower. Then, we spoke once, we said goodbye and she kissed my cheek (In my country it's normal to greet and say goodbye with a kiss on the cheek) and I was IN THE CLOUDS. Jumping and all that shit after she left. Not only that, I ASKED FOR HER PHONE NUMBER DAYS LATER. I was SHAKINGGG, she was like ""Why are you shaking?"" and I was like ""I'm just cold dw about it"" IT WAS SUMMER. Later she texts me, we talk a bit, AND SHE ASKS ME OUT FOR COFFEE. I panicked. I fumbled it and said that my parents didn't let me. And she was like ""Okay no problem"" and we never spoke again. It didn’t affect me or anything, I didn't care. BUT HOW TF DID I HAVE MORE GAME BACK THEN THAN NOW??? THERE'S NO WAY I WOULD EVEN ASK A GUY'S NUMBER NOW. HOW??

... Moving on-

Exhibit B: My best friend, who I mentioned before, told me that she was bisexual. I was like ""Cool"" and that was it. I never thought really of it. She kissed me on the cheek once in my pool, I didn't know why but I didn't have a problem with it. Then she tells me via text that she likes me. And I was like ""No homo lmao"" bc we would always joke like that. And she was like ""Haha yeah no homo it was just a joke"" and I never really thought of it until YEARS LATER. And I can't even ask her bc we don't talk anymore.

Years later. I'm playing Sims 4, just chilling. Starting a new game, trying to make it accurate to my life. I stopped playing for a while bc I was studying, and now that I got my degree I came back to chill. And I don't remember putting that I was bi in the game?? Anyways. I only got a date with ONE GUY, and somehow I fumbled it??? I didn't do anything bad?? And he told me to never call him again?? ONLY TO ASK ME OUT ON A DATE AGAIN AND TELL ME THE SAME SHIT? Not only that, AT LEAST THREE women started to get flirty with ME. AND I DIDN'T EVEN DO ANYTHING.

Honestly, I'm done. I just want a man. A nerdy guy if I could but I don't really have a type clear. Any advice?? Am I tripping??

Edit: BTW I obviously didn't talk about any of this to my family or anybody, just in case. I have been hiding this for years. I love my family, but they've already said that I'd get kicked out if I was LGBT or something like that. So.. yeah.",2,1737047953.0,Truthoffmychest,3,1.0,False

I want to automate it so that it turns itself on automatically in the morning and off at night.

I tried a Phillips Hue Smart Plug and while cutting the power does turn the unit on/off a manual finger press on the ice button is needed to kickstart the machine, otherwise it just sits there.

I thought I could use a switchbot to press but turns out the buttons are Capacitive Buttons, which require a human finger to work. I found this article from Alex Meub, [""Automating Capacitive Buttons with a Modified Switchbot""](https://alexmeub.com/automating-capacitive-buttons-with-switchbot/) but I tried this down to the T and it didn't work.

While moving in together we had a deal that I would do most of the chores such as laundry, washing the dishes, shopping, cooking and cleaning the bathroom. She takes care of sweeping the floors, vacuuming and putting clean dishes away (we cannot have dishwasher). We also have a dog and that is another reason I wanna do most of the cleaning.

I work in a customer service for a international company. I won't go into detail but it is job for 2 and I have been doing this alone for 2 weeks (colleague is sick) and it has been really exhausting.

This week, my gf has a week off of work so yesterday she decided to bake an apple pie. I was happy she did something for us, and even happier when she told she would do the dishes for me. In the evening the sink was still full of dirty dishes. I just reminded my gf that the sink is still full and she said ""I will do it tomorrow"". Ok, I just reminded her to do it before her mom comes to visit us, also reminding her her mom has her own key (we gave her a spare so that she can take our dog on walks when we both have morning shifts (bf works 3 shifts). I knew that if gf was walking our dog and her mom came and saw the dishes, she would start washing them. Now, I really appreciate her help, but not with the dishes!

Anyway, I come home from work, greet everyone and see the dishes were done, yay! I thanked my gf before his mom, we got coffee and talked. After she left, I once again thanked my gf for the dishes. She confessed that her mom actually did them. I got upset. As I feared, rest of now soggy dough on the plates and mugs (smeared on the insides), the pan from caramel still sticky... I put everything into the sink and rewashed it. Gf said I was being an AH, not appreciating that her mom did something nice for us. I told her that I do appreciate the help but it has to be an actual help.

I sent her mom a text thanking her for the dishes and that I did not know she did them. My gf is now not speaking to me, calling me a perfectionist AH. Was I the AH here?",1,1737047830.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

This lasts for several days, where my voice is effortless to project, and is very deep, strong and pleasant, to the degree of getting complimented by strangers.

Unfortunately, after a few days it fades away. Sometimes my voice is somewhere in between: I can reach some decent depth and volume but have to make some effort. Then sometimes it’s just dead: weak, nasal and flat.

Honestly, my voice is at times my superpower and at times my biggest weakness.

I tried to notice some factors at play such as sleep, usage, food (silent reflux can kill my voice), anxiety, nasal obstruction.

I came looking for them with my initial diagnosis and was very disheartened and scared after reading through many. I realize it’s a thread for help and most people come here when things are bad so I am not naive to know that’s everybody’s experience. 
Backstory. I received my diagnosis last year and was suffering immensely since the summer. I’m 35F with two young children and have always been an active person and athlete. My whole world came crashing down with one virus and a major life event. We determined that I’ve probably always had PsA but had a major flair with stressors. Officially seen a rheum and diagnosis in September. Very overwhelmed I asked for some time to make decisions on method of treatment and he gave me very honest and open suggestions. Main goal is to get inflammation down. Here’s what I’ve done to feel like there is a light at the end of this very dark tunnel. 
•First meds…
5 mg prednisone daily. Tapered to 2.5 mg now. (Hoping to taper off this month)
Tumeric/curcumin supplement 
Magnesium 400 mg nightly
Vitamin D after blood draw to check levels
•Diet….
Elimination diet AIP
Strictly eating whole ingredients and very little processed foods. Cut gluten completely and all nightshades. Also very very little dairy. 
Zero alcohol and only one cup coffee and water rest of day. 
•Better sleep practices have helped as well and nightly use of heating pads.

All this to say I know this is not going to work for everybody and I don’t intend on giving false medical advice or hope by avoiding medication. I listened to my body and what my gut said at the moment. I went from barely being able to use my hands and having daily pain of 6 or higher and relying on muscle relaxers and NSAIDs to tolerable pain of 2 or lower and can’t remember last time I took an nsaid for enthesitis or joint pain. I have a follow up to discuss further treatment. I of course would love to avoid long terms meds but as a nurse I realize this is a lifelong diagnosis and treatment will eventually need to take place. This is HUGE progress for a glimpse of an enjoyable and fulfilling life. I did my first exercise today since last fall and that gives me even more hope for healing! 

Sometimes you can heal from the inside out and I believe that’s what’s happening in my body. It hasn’t been easy and it’s a daily battle to make good decisions but has been worth it! I hope this can help somebody give some hope and a start on this rocky path of PsA. ♥️",2,1737047776.0,PsoriaticArthritis,0,1.0,False

[eclypse](https://eclypse.io) is a translation management tool that facilitates collaboration between translators and developers and is designed to improve productivity, communication while reducing translation errors. As an indie developer, if you choose to use eclypse for your localization needs, you can also get your content translated with chatgpt, google or deepl literally with a few clicks. In other words, there is no need to get translations sentence by sentence. If you had 2000 separate translatable sentences, eclypse fetches the translations for all of that from your choice provider while you go get your coffee.

I primarily built this app because of my personal interest in the domain. Not because I wanted world domination or to be number one in this industry. I am well aware that there are number of other products that perform similar functions. I am differentiating eclypse from competition by making it a macOS only app and offer an alternative experience that is more developer focused. Or at least I try. This is part of the reason I am writing here. If you would give it a-go and write me a few sentences on how I can be more developer friendly and reduce friction.

In some ways eclypse is a traditional tool that performs the basics necessary for localization such as tagging and filtering, glossary, support for plurals, custom statuses, ability to chat with translators and git integration - to name a few. It also has a few unique features such as translatability or manage by milestones to improve productivity.

I am looking for developers that would like to try new products and like to give feedback to improve it. eclypse adopts a freemium model. Paid levels are designed to accommodate the needs of larger corporations. I believe the free level is fairly generous and should be able to handle the workloads of most indie developers.

eclypse does not require credit card at all. When you first install it and you can initiate a 30-day trial period without any credit card info. It unlocks all of the of the features. If the trial period ends and you actually like to continue to use eclypse, just message me and tell me that you saw this post and I will put your account in the white list so that you can continue to use it forever. You can reach me here on reddit or eclypse's contact us page.

If this sounds interesting to you, you can download the notarized version of eclypse from the website at [https://eclypse.io](https://eclypse.io) . The website also describes the various features of the product so feel free to peruse it in your free time. Thank you.",1,1737047626.0,macapps,0,1.0,False

We went through a really rough patch at the end of 2023 and we ended up living separately for a bit to have some space. During that time a girl reached out to me with screenshots of my boyfriend snap chatting her (which he never really uses).
Complimenting her, calling her sexy, beautiful, etc and asking to go for coffee. Long story short nothing happened with that because she did research on him and found out about me within a few hours and messaged me that same day. We were able to move past it and since then have had a wonderful relationship. I do suffer with a few mental health issues, one of those being BPD which I have been able to manage but still does mean that things hurt me and stick with me alot more as I try to manage my illness and recover from the bit of relationship trauma he has caused. It's now been just over a year since this has happened and like I said, we've been doing so well, he has done alot of work on himself to learn how to treat me and better our relationship (so have I but that's besides the point). At times I still have moments where I question him on things, because my anxiety is on an all time high as I haven't learned to fully trust him again since that happened, I'm always scared and I think about what happened every day of my life because I am with him every day and i'm reminded of it. But every time I bring something up that I just want reassurance for he shuts me down. I'll give you the example of what happened with us this morning while he was getting ready for work; So l've bee hearing a random buzzing noise for a few weeks now, it sounds like an iPhone text tone buzz and sounds like it's coming from under the bed on his side whether he is home or not. I convinced myself I was going crazy until it happens this morning and I asked him if he heard it and he said he did. I calmly said ""you're not hiding another phone from me right?"" and he just laughed and said no. So I said ""okay, but you laughing is making me more anxious, I get worried about you and there's times I still don't trust you"" he then proceeds to keep brushing me off, telling me I have nothing to worry about in a extremely annoyed voice, when I pointed it out he said ""of course i'm annoyed, you don't trust me and ask me over and over again, i've already told you there's nothing"". I explained that I ask over and over because I have every right to not trust him and when I do ask he can't give me the time of day to sit down and properly reassure me from a place of love, he always just shrugs me off and doesn't make me feel very good. Every time I bring up his tone of voice and how it's condescending and rude he goes ""i'm not doing that, idk where you're getting this from all I said is i'm not hiding shit"". I just feel that there's a much nicer way to say things and he's making me feel like i'm the annoyance when I didn't cause this situation in the first place, he gave me the distrust, he is the one who was planning on cheating on me, I think I have every right to question him on things like this. He then proceeded to tell me that I should be ""over it by now"" and that it's pathetic i'm not, he said this all while chuckling. I got more upset especially when I believe I have every right to not be over it, it's only been a year, we have had no counselling and every time I try and bring anything up to talk about it and try and work through it, this is how he responds to me every time. How am I supposed to get over something when my partner shuts me down and makes me feel like i'm the problem, I didn't cause these issues in the first place, he did, l just want his support as I try to navigate through the pain I feel from this daily.
Long story short, is it valid to be looking for the reassurance that he's failing to provide? And if so can someone please explain how we can go from here, l want to go through any replies I get on here with him later, although I bet he doesn't care, because I should just be over it by now, and when I bring it up later I'm sure he'll just continue scrolling on his phone and barely give me the time of day, because 'HE is over it' and so should I.

TL;DR!
My boyfriend won’t give me proper reassurance after him cheating on me because he is annoyed that I’m always asking for it as he believes I should be over it by now. ",3,1737047571.0,relationships,18,0.67,False

Is there a way to get a consistent stable NIC name such as only eth0 with LXC use?  I've tried the udev 10-network.rules trick, but this didn't work.

And I always find myself making a lot of dumb mistakes, now that wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the fact that I'm a SPC who only picked up from time in service. It's been 2 years already, and I'm still making the same mistakes as if I had just shown up. I get comments from so many people, not just the platoon but the whole company. The standard in our platoon is to show up to hit times 15 min prior, and so many times I've just barely made it or 1 or 2 min after that point. My barracks room gets comments from junior enlisted, to gunners, to section sergeants, to my past and current platoon sergeants on how it's not organized or clean enough, what my room looks like is my constant attempts at balancing functionality with tidiness, I'm changing the layout, the closet, where I keep everything a lot. Also my memory is embarrassingly poor, I misplace so many things, from pens to headgear to keys to important cif issued gear that I know I'll have to pay for at some point. Oftentimes I'll forget what was just told to me, I'll forget to do assigned tasks especially if I'm already in the middle of one. I've been told to try and write things down to remember better, which I have tried but the amount of times I tried to write things down to remember, only to realize I didn't remember to bring pen and paper or even my phone I think speaks volumes. I don't know if I'm just making excuses or not working hard enough, but it tends to be when I actively try to improve something, the other things just get worse. If I start showing up earlier, my I loose focus on organizing, if I try to organize better I end up showing up late, if I try and write to remember, I end up late, and disorganized. I've been going to behavioral health as well, dealing suicidal thoughts. I'm still pretty ashamed to admit the amount of times I broke down crying in front of leadership because of all that. I take antidepressants now, and the fact that even that doesn't seem to help much. At least I'm not having those thoughts as much anymore. Already blew my shot at being a gunner myself, now a PFC that showed up after me is my gunner. I try not to think about it too much but every time I come into work I'm just ashamed. I overhear comments behind my back sometimes and even just casual passing comments about me being late or having a messy room or that a PFC is my gunner. I just don't know what do at this point. All I do now is just keep my mouth shut and try to do my job the best I can. What really is there to do knowing they're completely right. 


TL;DR I'm 2 years into my first contact, picked up SPC, and I'm still f-ing up the most basic things like organization, time management, memory, etc. I've tried just about everything I could think of to be better with little to no improvement. What do I do?

I remember at the beginning foodie smugly saying that she is going to consolidate her debts, start a payment plan and then she won’t have a problem sponsoring Salah. Well it’s not as simple as that. 
And foodie paying off her debts, well that  can be achieved and done so much faster, if they live frugally for a few years and Salah gets a job. 
But Salah doesn’t want to work in a place that will pay him very little ( I don’t think he’s as educated as he makes it out to be ) in Kuwait the better paying jobs are for Kuwaitis or for highly educated people who have specialised skills. 
As for Chantal, she would need to sacrifice if she wants to get Salah to Canada . This would mean no more takeout, no buying personal items like lush or even anything from Temu. But who thinks Chantal would actually do this ??? 
She orders takeout online almost daily, plus buys groceries weekly. On top of this now she’s taking the car and driving regularly and while out she buys coffees and snacks without thinking about the price. At this rate Chantal’s debts won’t be paid for another 50-60 years. 
I’m sure Salah is on the prowl looking for another sad desperate woman he can manipulate to be his ticket out of Kuwait. If he succeeds his  plan will be to disappear during one of Chantal’s visa runs. Chantal won’t know what to do except come back to Canada and rage once reality hits her.

1i2to2i,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1i2to2i/short_story_the_general/,Short Story: The General,"It was nearing midnight, and all was dark at the offices of the PDCO (Planetary Defense Coordination Office). The lights were always set to disable at 10pm sharp, which annoyed Johnson, whose shift ran from 10pm to 6am.

Johnson felt that he was not respected at this workplace. He was smart, diligent, and punctual, and his Masters degrees in astrophysics and computer science distinguished himself from many others in this field. However, having dedicated his life to his studies, he had grown into a fat, sweaty bald man with a high-pitched, squeaky voice and a perpetually shaky, anxious disposition. He had no girlfriend, no family, and no social life outside of work. Nevertheless, Johnson was proud of his academic achievements and believed his position at the PDCO to be both admirable and important to the world.

Johnson stared at his computer screen, illuminating his face in the indigo-shaded darkness of the room. He took a sip of his sweet milky coffee and a handful of some Cheez-Its while trying to shut out the sounds of the janitors vacuuming the neighboring offices. His job was easy, but dull; he had to monitor the skies for any chance of an NEO (near Earth object). He analyzed data from various telescopes across the world to detect any objects that could potentially impact the Earth. There were often many NEOs to be found, but it was unbelievably rare to find one headed directly towards the Earth; most just zipped on by without ever acknowledging this world teeming with life.

The phone rang, shocking Johnson out of his staring contest with his computer screen. Calls were rare, especially during the night shift, so Johnson felt a tremor of anxiety jolt through him. His clumsy hand reached awkwardly for the receiver, which slipped through his clammy palm, clattering on his desk. Johnson could hear a loud, gruff voice yelling through the phone: “God damn it, Johnson! Did you drop the phone again?! Sounded like a damn gunshot going off in my ear, you baboon!”

Johnson finally maintained his grip on the phone and held it up to his ear; his clumsiness had caused him to sweat even more profusely.

“Yes sir, sorry sir,” Johnson had a tendency to be overly formal with his superiors, much to their annoyance. The man on the phone was Donaldson, his rigid and loud-mouthed supervisor. “So, why are you calling? You never-“

“You’re probably wondering why I’m calling so late,” Donaldson interrupted. “I have important news. The General is coming.”

“The General?” Johnson had no idea who ‘The General’ was supposed to be. “As in… the U.S. military?”

“He was supposed to arrive earlier, but his flight was delayed,” Donaldson said, ignoring Johnson’s queries. “His time is limited, so he would still like a tour of our offices even though it’s after hours. I practically begged him to come tomorrow, but he insisted on visiting tonight. Since you’re the only one on duty, the task will fall to you.”

“Me? But sir, you know I have to constantly monitor-“

“Johnson, this is The General we’re talking about. His presence takes precedence over your duties. We have no other options.”

“W-well… Okay…”

“Fantastic,” said Donaldson, his voice dripping with condescension. “Oh, and one more thing: you’ve probably seen the Cheez-It snack bags that were left out on the breakroom table. Those are for day shift only. You are not to have any. We made sure to count them.”

Johnson gulped, looking down at the empty snack bag in his wastebin underneath his desk. “Guh… Yes, sir.”

“God knows you don’t need any more snacks, you fat bastard.” Donaldson suddenly roared an evil, scathing laugh that sounded like a vicious Rottweiler barking at a bird. “Anyways, I’m going to sleep. Don’t call me if you need anything.”

The line went dead.

Johnson, temporarily relieved to not be on a call with his boss any longer, had another pang of anxiety after realizing he hadn’t asked what the General was supposed to look like, his real name, his age, nothing. The General could be anyone. Johnson hoped it would be painfully obvious when the General arrived.

His computer began beeping, alerting him that an NEO had been spotted. This, again, was not abnormal; the computer found NEOs all the time. But as soon as Johnson focused in on what the computer had located, he nearly passed out in his chair. His heart jumped out of his chest. His minor sweat beads turned into a raging waterfall. His armpits moistened, his pupils dilated, his nipples hardened, and his hands began shaking with the ferocity of a 9.8 eathquake.

A massive asteroid. Hurtling directly towards Earth.

There was no mistaking it: the computer does the math well, but Johnson ran a few ancillary tests to confirm. Indeed, the asteroid was on a collision course with the Earth, and would collide within a day or two, based on its relative speed. It was huge; perhaps 2.5 - 3 kilometers wide. Typically, asteroids that size could be detected years, or even decades, in advance, but this asteroid appeared to be approaching from the direction of the Sun - what all astronomers know to be called the “solar blind spot”. This was indubitably the worst-case scenario.

Johnson, who had trained for this moment his whole life, sprang into action. He immediately called dispatch, who would connect him to the U.S. military. A bored woman answered his call.

“Dispatch.” she moaned dully.

“Yes, this is J-Johnson from the Arizona PDCO,” Johnson spit the words out frantically, trying and failing to maintain his composure. “There is a massive asteroid heading towards Earth, I need to speak to a high-ranking officer in the military immediately.”

The lady did not seem fazed. “You said Johnson?”

“Yes, ma’am, Johnson from the Arizona PDCO.”

“Isn’t that where The General is headed?”

“I, uh, yes…” Johnson furrowed his brow in confusion. “But that isn’t important right now. An asteroid, a huge, huge asteroid, will collide with Earth in roughly two days and cause unbelievable devastation! I need to be connected with someone immediately!”

“Hmm,” said the unaffected lady. “Most of ‘em are asleep right now and would rather not be awoken. Ooh, I have an idea, why don’t you just tell The General when he shows up?”

Johnson shook his head in disbelief, spurring a few beads of sweat to fly off him like skittish bugs. “Look, can I speak to someone else? Maybe someone who can understand the gravity of the situation?”

The lady laughed, a sharp, acerbic sound. “Gravity. Ha ha. I get it. ‘Cause you’re, like, a space guy.”

“That’s not what I-“

“I’m the only one on shift tonight, Johnson. Everyone else called off sick,” said the lady, and Johnson could hear her take a big gulp of something. “And to be honest - it’s my first day.”

“You’re kidding,” Johnson replied, his eyes widening in abject horror and frustration. “Well, you’re supposed to connect me with someone in the military. They need to take action on this as soon as possible.”

“I told you, they’re asleep.”

“Well, WAKE THEM UP!” Johnson suddenly screamed impatiently, surprising himself.

“I will not tolerate disrespect,” the lady stated, suddenly speaking in a sharp and mature tone. “Donaldson will be notified of your transgressive behavior.”

“I-I’m sorry!” Johnson wailed. “I just need you to take this seriously! This is a matter of life or death!”

No reply.

“Hello?!”

The line was dead. Johnson cursed and re-dialed. No answer.

“G-God damn it!” Johnson slammed his hammy fists on his desk, causing his coffee cup to spill on his keyboard and mouse. Johnson then tried calling Donaldson, who did not answer either. Feeling desperate, he then opted to call Donaldson’s boss. Donaldson would typically be furious that Johnson would go over his head, but he truly felt that he had no other choice.

“Robertson here,” said a grim, elderly voice on the line. “This better be good.”

“Robertson, it’s Johnson. Night shift.”

“Johnson? Donaldson’s employee? Why are you calling me in the middle of the night?!”

“There is an asteroid hurtling towards Earth. Nobody has answered my call except for you. We desperately need to alert the military.”

“Well, call dispatch. That’s your entire job.”

“I did. They were no help at all.”

“Hmph. I actually received a report that you disrespected a dispatch officer, verbally berating her until she felt no other option than to quit. Why would you do such a thing?”

Johnson squinted his eyes. “She quit?! Look, she wasn’t doing her one job of dispatching me to-“

“That is unacceptable behavior, Johnson. We will discuss this next time I’m in the office. I’d fire you right now if The General wasn’t coming in. You’re all set to meet him, correct? He should be there any second to inspect the facilities.”

“Just who is this General guy? If he’s so important, why aren’t any supervisors here to meet with him?”

“There’s that disrespect again. Johnson, if I hear you utter even a single disrespectful syllable to The General, I will make your life a living hell. I won’t just fire you, I’ll fuck you. For life.”

Johnson paused.

“But sir… The asteroid…”

“Christ, again with this asteroid bullshit. Just tell The General. He’ll know what to do.”

The line went dead abruptly.

Just then, before Johnson could even register that the call had ended, a janitor walked in with a serene look on his face.

“Señor… The General es here.”

Johnson blinked, his heart surging in his chest. He had no idea what to expect, but he was anxious anyway.

He hastily put his coat on and walked to the front entrance of the spaceport. Across the street sat a dark, ominous limousine; Johnson wondered why they didn’t park closer to the actual entrance. A silent driver, who looked more like a walking corpse with his skinny body and pale skin, gave Johnson’s presence zero acknowledgement as he slowly lifted himself out of the car and slowly walked to the rear door of the vehicle. He moved so slowly and so quietly thay Johnson felt as if he were watching a surreal play, especially with the moonlight’s glow being the only thing illuminating the scene.

But finally, the driver opened the door.

A man with a button-down shirt, red as blood, and a long, black leather duster stepped out of the vehicle with a confident swagger Johnson had never before witnessed. This man carried himself like a celebrity, or a sports star, or a used car salesman. He had shockingly white teeth, possibly veneers, that seemed to smile and grimace at the same time, like a demented Gary Busey. His greying hair was slicked back like a 1950s greaser. A cigarette dangled out of his mouth, but no smoke was emitting from its tip; was it merely a prop? He wore clean, perfectly ironed jeans that dropped down to his domineeringly large cowboy boots. He looked like a character from a Tarantino movie that Harvey Keitel would typically play.

This man was an enigma. He just had to be The General. There was no mistaking it.

The General looked directly at Johnson, sizing him up. It seemed he was not too pleased with what he saw.

“I’m here.” said The General, a hint of disdain in his voice.

“A-are you The General?” Johnson asked. He was intimidated by the man’s sheer confidence.

“Am I The General?” The General giggled and looked at his driver, who laughed as well. “He’s asking me if I’m The General.”

Johnson blinked, feeling pathetic.

“I need to be shown around,” said The General, finally stepping towards Johnson, his cowboy boots clinking metallically with each step. “You will serve as my guide. Do only as I say or you will be severely punished. Do you understand?”

“I, uh, I suppose…”

“My god, you are pathetic,” The General said, sneering at Johnson. “You really must take more pride in your appearance. You’re sweating as if you just ran a marathon, but I presume your job requires no manual labor. A desk jockey! Tell me, is it a condition? Or do I make you nervous? You may answer.”

“To be quite honest, sir…” Johnson gulped. “I found an asteroid headed towards the Earth, which is set to collide with us within one to two days. Approximately.”

The General lip-smiled sheepishly and looked back at his driver, who met him with only a blank, emotionless stare. He then looked back at Johnson.

“How interesting. Yes, yes, this is quite an interesting development indeed!” The General began pacing with his hands behind his back. “I knew there was a reason that I was supposed to come here tonight. I knew it.”

“So… you’ll call someone? So we can do something about it?”

The General smirked mockingly at Johnson.

“No. No, my dear boy. You do not become someone of my status by merely leaning on others for help. You and I, we will take action here, tonight. We don’t need anybody else.”

“S-sir, but-“

“I did not tell you to respond, did I?” The General raised his hand and smacked Johnson’s cheek with an unyielding strike. Johnson yelped like a wounded coyote. “Now, bring me inside, and we’ll figure this out. Like men!”

Johnson begrudgingly led The General into the lobby of the spaceport, greeted by an empty front desk and a darkened room. Johnson heard this room was often very welcoming during the day, but it took on a foreboding look in the dead of night.

“This is the lobby,” Johnson said, continuing towards the elevators. The General grunted, looking around with a stern and focused expression. Johnson hit the ‘up’ button. “Now I’m going to show you the 2nd floor, where I work.”

They stepped into the elevator, where a dainty jingle was playing. The elevator lurched upwards, and quickly settled on the 2nd floor with a jarring ‘ding’.

Johnson saw the janitor down the hallway, who, upon noticing, stood up straight and saluted. Johnson, confused, looked at The General, who nodded as if this was expected behavior. The janitor maintained this salute as they passed by and into the breakroom.

“Ah, Cheez-Its, morsels of the gods,” The General said, somehow unironically, and grabbed a small bag off the table.

“Ah, sir, those are for day shift only…” Johnson felt as though he was talking to the wind.

“Day shift. P’shaw!” The General ripped open the bag and poured the entirety of its contents into his gaping maw. “I am the All-Shift. Shifter of worlds. I can turn Day Shift into Night Shift and Night Shift into Day Shift.”

Johnson made a conscious effort to disregard this comment, and opened the door to the large, dark room that contained his office. At the far end of the room was a single window that took up the entire wall, serving as a viewing port for the Space Shuttle down the tarmac, about a half mile away. The sight of the shuttle often inspired Johnson, and reminded him of why he went into this field in the first place. It seems The General was struck by this sight as well; his eyes lit up and filled with tears, while his mouth hung open, just slightly agape in wonder.

“A tower… No, a monument to the Heavens. Mankind’s ultimate goal, fulfilled. Not just a marvel of engineering, but a marvel of imagination, determination, and victory over science. Victory over God, even. Beautiful.”

“Yeah… we have a launch scheduled for next week. Just to test some of our propulsion syst-“

“This is why I’m here. I understand now.”

Johnson was confused by The General’s ramblings, and vainly attempted to soldier on with the tour. “Yep, and over here is my desk.”

“You will allow me onto the spaceship,” The General said, still looking directly at the shuttle, spellbound. “You will launch me towards the asteroid. I am The Savior. I understand it all now. This is my purpose.”

Johnson, confounded, shook his head. “Look, I know you’re The General and all, but I can’t just… launch you. This is a billion dollar project, plus it would take a whole team to get it to work. Also, you’re not trained, your safety cannot be guaranteed, and-“

“These are all excuses. Matters of semantics. We are two men tasked with finding a solution for a danger that threatens all of humanity. I am not a fan of bureaucracy. I take charge. All of mankind is at stake here, yet you’re still too filled with trepidation to actually do anything about it? It’s time to take charge and stop being the pathetic animal you’ve been your entire life.”

Johnson blinked.

“Can you get me on that spaceship?”

“I mean… y-yes.”

“Do you know how to initiate the launch sequence?”

“Uh… yeah, I guess I know what needs to be done…”

“Very good. I will handle the rest. I will eliminate the asteroid, even if it costs me my life. Safety be damned. This is our purpose.”

Johnson couldn’t help but feel inspired by The General’s words. In many ways he was just happy this matter was finally being taken seriously by someone, even if it was only by this eccentric man.

“Now. What do we need to do to get this bird airborne?”

Johnson explained that the shuttle was already fueled and fully tested for the upcoming launch, and all that was needed to be done was the countdown sequence, which would only occur once The General was in the ship’s cockpit. The rocket would need to be armed, the tanks pressurized, and the spacecraft fully powered up. Typically this was done by a team of people, but Johnson understood the basics of what needed to be done, as most of the hardest bits of the mission were already completed.

“Good. Very good! We were put on this Earth to meet each other at this precise moment for this specific reason. I will save the world, but I need you to be the Shepherd to my Savior. Understand?”

The General’s charisma was overwhelming. Johnson didn’t understand, but he still nodded, as if in a hypnotic trance.

The General walked out of the building, and Johnson watched from the viewing port as the limousine drove out to the parked shuttle, like a lamb to the slaughter. At this distance, Johnson could barely see, but with a bit of squinting, he watched as The General climbed the precarious ladder leading to the cockpit. After a few minutes, The General’s voice sounded from the computer.

“Alright, Shepherd, I’m in place and buckled in. Not that it matters!” An uproarious laugh echoed from the comm system, causing a high-pitched feedback noise to scratch Johnson’s earbuds. “You’re going to launch me right at that fucking asteroid, and I’m going to obliterate it!”

“But what exactly is the plan here?” Johnson asked. “It’s not like the ship is equipped with asteroid-destroying lasers.”

“It’s simple. Elementary. I’m going to collide with the asteroid at a high speed to alter its trajectory. I’m going to give it a good bump and move it away from Earth!”

Johnson considered this. “Kinetic impact… of course. That could actually work. But that’s suicide!”

“It’s every man’s dream to die for something larger than himself,” The General replied. “We’re running out of time, and I’m running out of patience. Initiate the launch sequence.”

Johnson began powering up the rocket while running through the tasks on his timed checklist.

Rocket: armed.
Tanks: pressurized.

After approximately 15 minutes, the spacecraft was powered up, and dawn was beginning to break.

“We’re all set. I locked your coordinates directly towards the asteroid. We just need to do the countdown!”

Johnson couldn’t wait for this. It was every astronomer’s dream to do the countdown.

“FUCK the countdown, let’s fucking ROLL!”

Once again, maniacal laughter emanated from the comm system, and soon enough, Johnson was laughing hysterically too. Their riotous laughter was almost in sync.

Johnson hit the button.

Beautiful, menacing plumes of smoke and fire erupted from the bottom of the spacecraft. The haunting bellow of the rocket blasted through the room, and directly into Johnson’s soul. Everything shook, as if the ground too was nervous of what was about to happen. Beyond the roar of the rocket, Johnson could only hear The General hooting and hollering loudly as the ship took off at an incredible speed.

Johnson cried.

The next morning, the sun came up, and the world continued turning.

So… I’ve started my third idle/incremental game. Yes, third. And no, I’m not abandoning the other two—I just have the attention span of a caffeinated hamster. When a new idea appears, I can’t help myself, so I hop between projects like a ping-pong ball.

**What’s this one about?**  
Complaining! Seriously, you click to whine, then automate the process so you can watch your Grievance Points skyrocket. I’m using **Vue 3 + TypeScript** with **Pinia** for state management, and **break\_infinity.js** to handle those ridiculously large numbers (because who doesn’t love infinite potential for negativity?). The game features plenty of silly references to everyday annoyances—cold coffee, slow internet, endless captchas—basically, the universal language of frustration.

**But why another idle game?**  
Because focusing on one project is so last year! I tend to rotate between ideas so I don’t burn out on any single concept. The other games are still on the table—I’m just juggling all of them to keep things fresh.

**What do I need from you?**

* **Feedback** on the concept: Is “click to whine” your kind of jam, or is it too meta?
* **Ideas** for funny daily gripes or pun-based upgrades (e.g., “Sourpuss Generator,” “Infinite Whine Machine,” etc.).
* **Encouragement** (or a playful scolding) to keep me from letting any of my half-finished projects gather dust.

**Planned Features**

* A ton of comedic complaint lines (because complaining about complaining is next-level).
* “Rant bots” that do the whining for you—because we all have better things to do, right?

The position is 100% my skill, expertise, blabla. I’m definitely professionally qualified and think it sounds like a good job with nice tasks and responsibilities.

Here comes the problem: in academia -here in Norway- you don’t have a set working time or schedule. So I can work however, whenever and wherever I want. I can work 10 hours or just 1. no one cares. If I don’t feel good, I stay at home. Sometimes for a week if I have had a meltdown for example. And it’s all fine. 
But this position would be «average». I asked about working hours and possibility of home office in the interview and they have flexitime but core hours are 9-15 (where is that flexible, that’s just a normal working day schedule?? Flexible my ass) and home office just in exceptional circumstances but not as a usual thing. We also talked a bit about the social aspect and even tho I highly mask and everyone perceives me as extroverted, outgoing and nice to be around, I usually am not that social. Like lunch break where everyone has lunch together and then you have to sit at a table with 20 other people and it smells hundred different foods, super loud because everyone is talking and you have to make small talk? That’s not a break for me, that’s torture and more exhausting than actual work. The team leader said they usually have breakfast coffee and lunch together and I think it’s expected from me to join 🫠🫠🫠 

Another thing is public transport. Right now I live 10min from the university and I walk. Which is super nice because I can’t stand public transport. But this would be on the other side of town and commuting would take ca. 45min one way. I know that’s not much for most people but for me it sounds insufferable. I would probably be exhausted by the time I get to work. 

But then again, I need a job and this is a good position which pays good, has awesome benefits and a career development plan. I would love to stay in academia but a postdoc would mean another temporary position for 3-4 years, no benefits, few holidays, low pension payments. The only two things which would be better are the working hours and that I’d do it where I’m now, so no new environment and all that stuff plus no commute. But then again, I would have to apply for a grant for a postdoc project and who knows even if I get one.. arrrggg this makes me so frustrated that I can’t just function as a normal person in this society.

I want to start by saying in many ways I am luckier than most. My Wife and I love each other and laugh everyday. My children are generally happy every day. 

That being said, I AM SO BURNT OUT.

 My Wife, as the breadwinner, the secondarily preferred parent, and person who works outside the home, she is thrust into a role that has traditionally been occupied by men. As the work from home Dad, the preferred parent, and the one in touch with my emotions, have been thrust into a role that was traditionally occupied by women.
 
 I feel like this has made me very empathetic to what women go through, and without realizing it, my Wife has subconsciously adopted many of the cliches of full-time working Dads. (Ex: Not changing very many diapers, not getting up in the middle of the night with the baby, often feeling too tired to help when she gets home, waiting to see if I'll get up first when one of the kids is crying, allowing me to maintain naps and feeding times even in the evenings and on weekends, and generally doing parenting tasks halfway, like only changing a diaper if I bring her the wipes and the diaper, or assembling them a plate of snacks instead of actually making them dinner when I ask her to make dinner for them.) 

 I GET that she's exhausted. I do not discount the fact that she's working a legal job for a major coffee company and commuting 45 minutes to work in either direction. This is not lost on me, and I'm super appreciative of the life she has provided for our family, allowing me to be home with our girls in their developmental stages. 

 But I have also been working since we got together, paternal leave is almost non-existent, and despite always having to go back to work sooner, I have always been the one to do the night shifts, because of postpartum depression, and because of her career. 
 It's been 19 months straight of me being the one to get up in the middle of the nights, and the only chance I get to sleep in are on weekend mornings every other weekend. 

 My job is from home and it's only part-time, and in general I think raising kids is a blessing to be allowed to do full time, but THERE ARE NO FREAKING BREAKS.
  We moved to Arizona half a year ago, and now that we have no friends and no family around us, I have seen nothing but my Wife and children since we got here. We've had one date night out, but I was so burnt out it barely even registered.

 But my Wife still feels like she does so much that she needs me to do more. More planning, more initiating cleaning, more in general. I think she gets that I say I'm burnt out, but I think she feels like me getting to talk about it on a Tuesday means that I'm fine on Wednesday, when the truth is is that I have been going and going for years and I'm freaking tired. 

 It's not that it's too hard, it's that it never ever stops. 
 She reminds me that she's not getting breaks, she's going to work, but I don't think she comprehends that being able to leave the house is a break from the children, even if it's exhausting work. 
 Getting to talk to other adults is a break from raising children, even if it's tiring.
  Getting to drive in the car is a break from the chaos of home, even if it's monotonous. 
 It may not be a relaxing break, but it's time away from the kids that lets her mentally recharge, and I can't seem to get her to truly understand that without that, lethargy is setting in, and my ability to get anything done beyond what absolutely needs to get done is slowly withering away and dying.

I love my Wife, I love my children, and I don't want any life but the one I have. I just need a little community, I guess. 

 I didn't need less on my plate, I just need a little break now and then. Anyone else?

Dear Diary, 

I'm finally drinking some coffee. My second cup of the day was delayed by a broken coffee maker at work. 

But there's certain sublime euphoria that comes with finally drinking a delayed cup of coffee. Genuinely, the high is different. It's worth the discomfort of the delay once in a while. 

It's most effective with the first cup of coffee of the day though. I won't feel it to such a pronounced degree with this one, since it's my second cup. Maybe I'll delay my first cup tomorrow. 

In any case, it's been a rough week. My son was so sick on Tuesday. Seeing him sick was heartbreaking. He had a fever of 102 plus headache, sore throat. He was totally lethargic and slept so fitfully, groaning and whimpering in his sleep. 

It breaks my heart to see him suffer. And I fret terribly when he's sick, always worrying that it's the onset of something dire. 

I took off the day of work and tried to provide him as much comfort as possible. 

He's feeling a lot better now, though still not 100%. 

And as for me, work has been a struggle due both to missing a day and being exhausted from my son's disturbed sleep. 

My biology students took a quiz today. My environmental sciences class will come next and I have a lesson about wildfires for them. I do not feel prepared. 

I've been cooking more and more. I think I mentioned -- it's largely due to budget constraints. I need to make my dollar stretch further.   
  
I can't spend on a meal what I could get three pounds of rice or lentils for.   
  
 I made a great stew the night before last. It had potatoes, oats, tomato sauce, a handful of pasta (which I had an awkward amount left of) onions, ginger, zucchini, carrots, peas, paprika, a garlic, chili pepper, cilantro, rosemary, thyme, turmeric.   
  
I think it was pottage.   
  
Phedre and Jocelyn in my audio book always seem to be eating pottage and it always sounds good and I'm always wondering what it is. And I think it was that. 

I think I'm nearly finished with the book. I like Hyacinthe better than Jocelyn. I think Hyacinthe is my favorite character. But I just have a bad feeling about his eventual fate. Nothing bad has happened to him yet (I mean...nothing *fatal*. He has certainly suffered some hardship.   
  
But, as a writer, I just sense that the author is queueing things up to turn him into Phedre's tragic backstory. I sense it. Maybe I have THE DROMONDE. 

Also, last night I made some good oatmeal again, with stewed apples. I love stewed apples and I love the way they make my apartment smell when I boil them up with cinnamon. 

And raisins. I love the way raisins get fat and round when you boil them because they're just truly a divine thing to eat. 

Been remembering my dreams lately. Dreamt of neglected pets that I forgot I had. Dreamt of a pair of exs who wound up next to each other on a roller coaster. Dreamt of a fire fighter rescuing a spider. Dreamt of a mechanic's shop in the middle of the wilderness, and of a girl who gave me a blanket with mars on it as a gift. 

I've had good luck remembering my dreams of late and I hope it keeps up.

1. Do I need to download the app

For the most part you're gonna need to app to get the full benefit of the rewards program and to redeem coupons. And you need to make an account.

Now if you just want the cigarette discount, you can just scan the physical card at the register but you won't gain points.

If you don't have a smartphone you can sign up at wawa rewards .com and make an account that way, and scan the physical card

2. Do I have to scan the app

If you got a physical card in store, you can link the number on that card and the one on the app together and can scan either one

3. If i have the physical card but I haven't linked them can I still get rewards.

No, you have to have a rewards account to accumulated your points. And the card doesn't store your past transaction

4. I forgot to scan my rewards at checkout, can I still get my points

No, points can't be added after the fact

5. What can I get points on?

Everything except gift cards, alcohol, cigarettes, lottery tickets, catering orders, and oddly some dairy stuff. 

Fuel is by the gallon not the dollar amount

6 Fuel and gas?

So you get 5 points per gallon at fuel locations except NJ. It may take 24 hours for points to show up

7. What can I redeem points for and how many points do I get when I scan my card

10 points for every eligible dollar. 
There's a rewards transaction link in the app to show you why you got certain points

There's 2 types of rewards the ones with assigned point values, and promotional reward offers. The point value ones are always available and come in the 350, 500, 1000, 1200, and 1800. 

Examples of stuff in each category 
350 : free coffee, free wawa 16oz ice teas, bakery item, fountain drink, soft pretzels

500: apple slices, a variety of our handcrafted ice beverages, small/medium side, wawa ice tea/lemonade half gallons (my personal fav), sizzlis, and 0.15 off a gallon of gas

1000: burgers(my moms fave), chicken sandwhich, personal pizza, breakfast sandwiches, frozen drinks, rechargers and refreshers, 0.30 of a gallon of gas

1200: classic size hoagie, salad, specialty sandwhich (paining, club, ciabatta)

1800: 14 inch cheese or pepperoni pizza only. 

Promotional  coupons pop up below the the points coupon and they have an expiration date. For example your free birthday coffee or fountain soda pops up here and expires a month after your birthday. 
Another example is our 1,2,3 promo going on right now. 1 hot coffee, 2 ice coffee, 3 monsters

8. I wanna redeem multiple rewards.
 
You can, just not on the same transaction. So If you want a free coffee and a free hoagie separate transaction. And you can't  redeem the same coupon multiple times. This gets alot of workers yelled at. It's not our fault.

9. I scan my rewards and there is still a balance?

The rewards only covers the base of an item. So say you wanna get a free ice coffee, and you order a 24oz mocha ice coffee with Almond milk and extra espresso and extra mocha. The coffee will be free but you have to pay for the Almond milk, extra espresso and chocolate sauce. 

There are definitely more questions but this already really long, so if you have more i can try to answer them in the comments or refer you to the app. Thanks",8,1737046093.0,Wawa,4,1.0,False

1i2t7w9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1i2t7w9/eyes/,Eyes,"I had the weirdest dream last night, and it was *so* unsettling. It started out normal enough, like a regular day—just me in my apartment, doing the usual stuff. But then, it got… wrong. Like, I’d be doing something totally normal, like opening the fridge, and as I turned away, I had this weird feeling, like something was watching me. I didn’t think much of it at first—just, you know, your typical “creepy vibe” feeling, but then it happened again. I looked at the fridge, and the handle? It… it wasn’t just a handle anymore. It had *eyes*. Like, small ones, kind of hidden in the curves of the design. But every time I tried to look directly at them, they’d disappear. Blink, and gone. 

So, naturally, I turn to the window. But when I look out, the curtains? Full of eyes. *All* over them. Like, little ones tucked between the folds. I swear they were following me, but the second I looked at them straight on, they vanished. I kept walking through the apartment, and no matter what I did—opening a cupboard, pouring some water, checking my phone—everything felt like it was watching me. The coffee mug I grabbed off the counter? Eyes. The door handle? Eyes. It was like I couldn’t escape it. Every time I turned around, there’d be something, something else staring, but as soon as I faced it, it would vanish.

The worst part was when I was sitting at my desk, scrolling on my phone. I swear I saw the keyboard shifting. Like, the keys were *moving* when I wasn’t looking directly at them, and when I glanced over, the keys were just normal again. I’m not talking about shadows or reflections—it was like the whole world was seeing me, noticing me, but it wouldn’t let me see *it*.

And the weirder part? The longer it went on, the more everything felt like it was made to watch. Like, I couldn’t even trust my own apartment. My bed? Eyes. The rug? Eyes. Everything I looked at had them, and every time I tried to focus, they’d disappear, but I *knew* they were still there, just waiting.

It’s like the whole dream was just one big paranoia trap. No matter where I went or what I did, I could never escape being watched. It was terrifying.",1,1737045968.0,Dreams,0,1.0,False

1i2t4c6,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1i2t4c6/the_bunkhouse/,The Bunkhouse,"**January, Florida**

I live in the woods.  
Sand is the ""dirt"" here.  
It gets between my toes

when I come back inside  
from the outdoor shower.

Sometimes, I don’t get it all out  
before putting my socks on—  
There are bigger problems in life.

It gets cold at night.  
Even though I have a heater,  
My shack isn’t too well insulated.

I don’t know why  
it doesn’t bother me as much  
as it would other people.



I enjoy simple living  
I eat simply:  
rice, beans, pasta,  
peanut butter, bread.

That doesn’t seem to bother me, either.  
And I have my coffee every morning  
while I write in my journal,  
watching the sun fall through the window—  
through the sheer curtains Jennica bought  
from Goodwill.

**Jennica**  
We—I—  
have to keep the curtain  
perfectly slid open,  
because there’s a hole in it.

But I found, if you look at it just right,  
squint your eyes,  
turn your head a little—  
think picture day in elementary school—  
you almost feel like  
you could be on a Pinterest board.

But inevitably   
you open your eyes fully,  
And you see it for what it is:  
a different kind of beauty.

A sand-in-your-toes,  
soft-spots-in-the-floor,  
hole-in-the-ceiling,  
raggedy-Goodwill-sheer-curtain beauty  
that only sunlight,  
a cup of coffee,  
and a spontaneous poem in my journal can illuminate.

They call it “The Bunkhouse”  
People ask why I don’t move  
to a new place.

I don’t know why.  
I might be trauma bonded  
I don’t really know what that means but it sounds right

This house has always been here for me.  
It’s beautiful in its own way—  
not conventionally,  
but it’s perfect.

There’s duct tape on the ceiling,  
soft spots on the floor,  
spray foam insulation  
where the mice tried to get in.

I love you, bunkhouse.

Where the mice *did* get in.  


I continue to live with it  
And it works  
But there must be a reason  
I put up with all this.

I don’t know, though.  
I don’t really want to know.  
Maybe it’s better if I don’t know.

I don’t know how,  
on God’s green earth,  
I wound up here.

Sometimes, I get mad at the house.  
I yell at it, swear at it,  
And wish I’d never moved to Florida.

But there isn’t anything wrong with it.  
It’s just an innocent old house—a really old house.

I came here broken  
and found something just like me.

I have a choice now:  
love it, or hate it.

Where do you draw the line, though?  
Surely, you can’t just love  
living like this…

Oh, yes. I do, actually.



I think I’ll coin a new term:  
Ugly Beauty.  
Don’t even get me started  
on the fifty-year-old, outdated carpet.

Its dirty beige and pink hues—  
I bet it looked good and vibrant once upon a time,  
Now? it looks like old strawberry vomit.

It’s so frickin’ ugly.  
Damn thing.

It looks like it’s been walked all over  
for fifty years,  
and no one’s ever thanked it.

Thanks.

Someday  
They want to tear the place down.  
What a…Sad…  
No,   
happy…No…

I don’t know what mix-of-the-two  
day that will be.



Some nights  
I wake up at 2AM  
And hear her whisper in my ear:  
I love you

I (24F) could use some advice about a guy I’ve been talking to (31M). I met him at his cafe where he’s the owner. The first couple of times I visited with a friend, he seemed really attentive to me—switching the music to something romantic when I was there, getting me things like napkins without me asking, and generally paying attention to my needs. I wasn’t looking for anything serious at that point since I had just gotten out of a complicated situation with another guy, but I did find him attractive.

On my third visit, I went alone, and we talked for a bit. He asked for my Instagram handle and my number. I gave him my IG but declined the number exchange, saying we could talk there instead. For the first couple of days after we connected on Instagram, he seemed really interested—asking how I was doing, complimenting me, and even suggesting we talk on the phone. I was with family and couldn’t talk at first, but I sent him pictures to show I wasn’t just ignoring him.

Then things started to feel a bit off. The next time we tried to talk, he got a little sarcastic, like, “Now you remember to call me?” when I couldn’t pick up his call. When we finally did chat, he made comments like, “I can’t talk to you, you’re too beautiful,” and abruptly ended the call. He also asked if I was just there at his cafe to drink coffee or if there was more to it, which was a little strange since I hadn’t expressed interest in anything more at that point.

He said he’d call me back, but then texted saying it was too late, so we agreed to talk the next day. However, the next day came, and I didn’t hear from him. He saw my stories on Instagram but didn’t reach out, even though I mentioned I’d be visiting his cafe again.

I’m feeling confused about his behavior, and I’m wondering how to approach this situation. I’m not sure if I’m just overthinking things or if his actions are indicative of something else.

How would you handle this situation? Waiting for him to text seems a bit too much at this point

This is an annual trip focused on the NFL playoffs so we were looking for a suite that had a big ass TV and comfy seating for all of us. I booked an Executive Suite with a mountain view (ie not a strip view) and it was perfect for our purposes. A 75"" TV is harder to find than you'd think in this town! We ended up on the 69th floor (nice) and  had a view facing north on the strip after all. We got a Black Friday discount for new loyalty members for about $900 a night. 

This is the cleanest hotel I have ever entered. They're trying real hard to make the place smell like a pretty girl and mostly succeeding, but it's just adding to to sensory overload. The service was good. The dealers were fun.

My biggest and only real gripe is the cost of everything that is just marked up because it's a nice hotel. 

2 drip coffees: $15
3 vodka/sodas: $67
Minimum to post up in the sports book: $500 (this is mostly why we get a suite)
Eggs / bacon / toast: $29

I mean, sheesh. I felt like my wallet was under siege even if I wasn't gambling. It was enough to make me consider somewhere else next time.

Cleaver: good steak, amazing sides, good service, good vibe. The steak wasn't good enough to get me to come back but I don't regret the meal.

Bouchon: brunch here before afternoon kick off is a staple for this trip. The pastries are out of this world and so are all the eggs dishes. 

Best Friend: also now a staple after we fell in love last year. The short rib tacos are my favorite but seriously everything is fantastic. Roy Choi is the best

I heard the First Step, and not much else, at my first meeting. My wife’s treatment program counselor had told me to go to Al-Anon. “If it will help her, I’ll do it,” I said.  
  
It was all women at that meeting. As I saw it, they all had alcoholic husbands and I had an alcoholic wife-a completely different situation. One man came in a few minutes late. Afterwards, as I was fleeing, he tackled me in the parking lot. He suggested the Wednesday night men’s meeting. What kept me coming back was the hour-long conversation with two men in the parking lot afterwards-they listened. On the way home, I realized it was the first time anyone had listened to me without telling me what to do. We eventually became life-long friends.  
  
I quickly settled into several meetings and found a home group that had many men in attendance. A long-timer said that I should make coffee. I said, “Someone already has.” She replied, “I meant for October, November, and December.” I am still unsure if that was a suggestion. My over-developed need to please got me there every week, which was the whole idea.  
  
After a while, my name appeared on the calendar to speak at the meeting. I asked the person next to me what I should talk about. “Serenity,” he said. “I don’t think I have any,” I replied. “Talk about how you lost it,” he said. It is so nice to have choices!  
  
Soon, my young children began attending Alateen and our behavior started to change. After several years in Al-Anon, I sensed the universality of the program while listening to a young woman tell her story at an anniversary meeting.  
  
I don’t recall if she was the A.A. or Al-Anon speaker, but she qualified for both. At the time, I was a mid-50’s white male raising two daughters. She was a 25-year old African-American woman who was bi-sexual, cross-addicted, and a dual member.  
  
Our stories were very different, but the feelings that led her to what she did were the same feelings that led me to do what I did. It was clear to me that our lives had put us on different paths with a common destination-recovery.  
  
After 25 years in the program, I noticed the Preface to *Courage to Change* (B-16) and I quote, “Because these selections are based on sharings from individuals, they contain references to gender and specific relationships, but the thoughts are applicable to people in all walks of life.”  
  
Al-Anon helps me make sense of the changes in my life. Being with other Al-Anon members helps me realize I am not alone. We are going through the same kinds of changes-and we are doing it together.

1i2suyy,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1i2suyy/cup_colour_into_taste_perception/,Cup colour into taste perception,"Me having amassed Loveramics cups of every colour, I have been researching on the internet the topic of how different colours are perceived emotionally, and this drove me into the subject of how colour of your espresso cup may translate into taste perception.

Quite amazing findings, you may support or disagree:

	•	White: Enhances the contrast of the crema and intensifies the perception of bitterness.
	•	Red: Accentuates sweetness while mildly softening acidity.
	•	Pink: Makes the flavour feel sweeter and softer compared to red.
	•	Yellow: Highlights acidity but also adds a touch of sweetness for balance.
	•	Green: Emphasizes acidity more strongly than yellow, making it ideal for brighter espressos.
	•	Brown: Enhances bitterness and reduces the perception of sweetness, creating a more robust flavour.
	•	Black: Makes the espresso feel richer and stronger, emphasizing boldness and bitterness.
	•	Blue: Balances flavours overall while softening bitterness.
	•	Transparent: Increases the perception of sweetness due to minimal colour contrast with the coffee, offering a modern and clean aesthetic ( I have a pair of Kruves).
	•	Orange: Enhances both sweetness and richness, creating a warm and vibrant coffee experience. My favourite colour for espresso:)

If you take the above into consideration, then here’s a guide to choosing the right cup colour based on the effect you want to achieve:

	•	To enhance bitterness: Choose brown, black, or white cups.

	•	To accentuate sweetness: Opt for pink, red, or orange cups.

	•	To increase the perception of sweetness: Use transparent cups.

	•	To soften acidity: Pick pink or red cups.

	•	To highlight acidity and brightness: Go for yellow or green cups (yellow balances sweetness and acidity, while green emphasizes acidity more).

	•	To balance flavours: Blue cups work best.

	•	To create a warm, vibrant experience: Orange cups are ideal.

And yes...it has Github-style chart 😅

Largely used Cursor AI to build it, and the main bits took me about 3 days - gotta say that working with an AI to get some basic stuff down helps you move super fast.

Anyone else use anything like this? Or have suggestions of cool things to track for the end of the year?

I have irregular period since the surgery. 2 weeks post op > heavy bleeding almost die > blood transfusion, antibiotics and transanemic acid.

Since the heavy bleeding, my body feel weak like hell...and I have become very sensitive to certain foods and drinks.

For example, bagels with cream cheese, ice lemon tea, cake with cream, ice cream, donuts, coffee, Christmas chocolate drink that contains syrups from coffee bean trigger back some of my symptoms (although it is not as painful before surgery, feeling ache and cramps with pressure I will give it 2-3 pain level). Not only feeling pain, but my body begins shivering with cold.

It's been 4 months that I skipped visiting my gynaecologist...I am scare of recurrence...I am scare of something bad happening.

Last 4 months have been stressful due to the work contract. Once it ended, I had a cheerful month then stressing about job seeking and interview with crazy assessment tests (companies nowadays need u to do a project before they decided whether to hire u...) 💔.

This month is particularly stressful as my parents pressure me alot. I begin to feel lower back pain, shoulder pain on and off, shortness of breath. The period this month is painful and my stomach is bloated like 4 months pregnant.

I want to see my doctor, but there is so much things going in my mind with the interview and assessment deadline coming up too soon 🤦🏻‍♀️. I want to prioritise my health, I want to see my gynaecologist...but I am afraid. 😭🥲

I kinda hope the consulting company fail my assessment test and project...as I do understand the intense amount of workload and stress I need to handle is brutal. Besides the salary is not quite desirable. Health is wealth...I dont know how I should tell my parents...all I think about is my symptoms, possible recurrence...unemployment, etc... 🤦🏻‍♀️

I know I am a mess now. Sorry.

“Hey, Nin?”

It was a memory, back when things made sense, back when my life was warm. 

It was still scary and confusing, but parts of me were coming clear. 

Back when running away was still an option we never took.

I immediately recognized it.

I recognized my own voice.

We were in the kitchen. I was making breakfast, and Rowan was perched idly on the countertop, swinging his legs, a cigarette dangling from his mouth. 

Wrapped up in his robe, my roommate resembled a pouting toddler, hiding behind thick brown curls. Rowan was acting like a man-child, but he was getting better, which was progress. 

When I slumped down with a bowl of oatmeal and a coffee, I figured entertaining his presence would be better than ignoring him, which had been my initial plan.

“Good morning.” I said, risking a sip of iced tea. 

I was still struggling with the whole *eating while my roommates ate ME thing*.

Rowan scoffed, exhaling a cloud of smoke. 

His eyes found the pitch black sky vacant of the sun, lips curling around the cigarette. 

Rowan Beck was the main character in his own mind. “*Is* it though?”

Oh, so he was in that type of mood. 

I tried again. 

""What are you drinking?"" 

I regretted my question zero point two seconds after I asked it. 

Especially when he pivoted on the countertop, lips curving around the rim. 

His smile had way too many teeth, a hint of sharper incisors coming through. 

""You.""

“Hey, Nin, can you grab my lunch from the refrigerator?” Kaz stuck his head through the gap in the door. He was half-dressed in boxers and nothing else. 

I pretended not to notice Rowan’s eyes almost popping out of his head.

“Put that *out*,” Kaz ordered, and to my surprise, Rowan completely lost his stone-cold demeanor, jumping up and immediately spitting out the cigarette. 

I couldn’t tell if it was a reaction to Kaz randomly showing up half-naked, or if he just wasn’t allowed to smoke. Either way, looking at the two of them—and knowing their past—the stoner vegetarian was definitely the one who called the shots.

I focused on my oatmeal, willing myself to stick it in my mouth and chew. 

It wasn’t exactly hard, per se. 

The hard part came when my cannibal roommates started preparing their own breakfast, which was a varied selection of my internal organs. Kaz set it up like a meat platter on the countertop, like I really was café-de-Nin.

Rowan was more discreet, blending me into a smoothie. I wasn’t a fan of him sitting there, legs swinging, downing it like it was chocolate. 

His weird moans when he swiped at his lips needed to be studied. I was already swallowing the barf creeping back up my throat in a thick paste. I really wanted that morning to be nausea-free, but I was already inching toward the bathroom, my body betraying me.

“Dude.” Kaz stood impatiently in the doorway, running his hands through his hair. “Grab me my lunch. It’s on the top shelf with your old blended brains.” 

He nodded to the refrigerator, and I caught the subtle smirk he and Rowan shared.

When Imogen came crashing in wearing nothing but a towel, she too shot the boys a devilish grin.

Oh.

Rowan avoided my gaze, slurping my liquidized intestines.

Oh, it was a test, huh?

I risked a glance at Immie, who situated herself next to Rowan, leaping onto the counter. 

He tried to shove her off, grumbling, “I got here first.” But Imogen Prairie was not a morning person—and after receiving the mother of all death glares, he turned his attention back to me.

It *was* a test.

I stood up, my legs already wobbling, and strode over to the refrigerator. 

I had been dreading what was inside ever since discovering my roommates’ unusual diet. 

In fact, I had nightmares about what they were hiding. Still, if I was going to be a Bolivia House resident, I had no choice but to get used to their “food.” 

I squeezed my eyes shut, reaching blindly for something that felt like plastic. 

I was already struggling, and their laughter didn't help. 

“It's not funny.” I hissed, pawing for anything that felt like a container. 

“Oh, but it *is*.” Rowan chuckled, and I had to bite back a hiss. 

They were acting like children. 

“Fuck off, Rowan.” 

His response was a giggle. “Nah. I like watching you squirm.”

“That’s cheating,” Kaz said, when I knocked a soda can over. “Come on, Nin. You’ve gotta suck it up at some point.”

“It’s my blended organs,” I managed through gritted teeth. 

“Yes,” Rowan said, “and they fucking slap, dude.""

“Rowan.” Imogen chastized, but she did catch my eye, her lips forming a smile. 

“They kinda *do*, though.”

Kaz’s “lunch” was neatly placed on top of some  half eaten hummus. I had to swallow the puke creeping back up my throat. I could see my slimy scarlet remains mushed into a sort of burger patty. Somehow, it didn’t surprise me that Kaz was already trying different recipes with my discarded flesh. 

While Rowan and Imogen were actual fucking savages, raw-dogging my poor emaciated corpse. 

Maintaining a smile, I pulled it out, held it at arm’s length, and shoved it into Kaz’s bare chest.

“Your *lunch*, my lord,” I mockingly bowed, managing a gritted smile, and his eyes lit up, his lazy smirk breaking out into a grin. 

Imogen squealed, clapping like I’d won an award.

“She did it!”

Rowan groaned, leaning back. “And, *this*, my friends, is why everyone thinks we’re weird.”

I wasn’t expecting Kaz to hug me, wrapping his arms around me. Imogen hopped off the counter and joined in.

Rowan watched idly, his eyes already mid-roll.

Still, though, he was halfway off of the counter, like he was about to join us. 

He changed his mind when I met his gaze, his mouth forming a scowl. 

""You guys are *adorable*.""

When Kaz left to find clothes, Imogen disappeared into the lounge to play video games, I was left with Rowan—and his flask. 

He kept playing with it, swinging it between his fingers. 

“Nin.”

Rowan said my name more like a cough.

Somehow, I knew exactly what he was going to say. 

Call it intuition, or maybe I was more entangled with my roommates than I thought.

“Don’t say it,” I said, stirring my oatmeal into an unappetizing mush.

“If she… you know, gets in my head—like really gets in my head—I’m talking full-on fucking possession and never coming back, like totally mind-controlled minion—”

“I get it, Rowan.”

“Yeah.” He heaved out a breath, and suddenly his voice was so small, so vulnerable, choking up. He slowly slid off the counter, and proximity was suddenly incredibly close, his breath in my face.

“Look, I know we’re dangerous, and I know we’re fucked up with the whole, uhh, partial moon possession, or whatever—but I want to be selfish.” 

His words took me off guard. 

""Selfish?"" 

His voice broke into a laugh, though it was more of a sob. “You’re right! You’ve been right this whole fucking time, and you didn’t say it out loud because she showed you, just like she showed me.” 

I wasn't expecting him to be so soft, gentle. I could put it down to him being moon drunk, but this was different. 

This was raw, vulnerable Rowan. 

“When you left us, it was human nature to run—to survive, and it'll take a while for me to fully understand it, but part of me knows exactly why you did it, Nin.""

He held out his hand, and I took them, letting him squeeze my fingers.

“I know why you ran, and I don’t fucking hate you for it,” he whispered, and part of me also broke, right there, squeezing his hand for dear life. “So.” Rowan’s voice broke into a sob. “Can you let *me* be selfish this time?” His eyes reflected her light, and I wondered if she was listening.

His lips formed a smirk, and it was there at that moment, that I knew it would always be him. 

The pretentious, self-righteous boy who built walls around himself to avoid getting hurt– who still couldn't understand *why* I left him to be brutally killed. He was as fucking selfish as me– as human as me.

“Because if it comes down to saving this town, or me, Kaz, and Imogen,” Rowan’s nails bit into my skin, and I felt his desperation to stay alive, that self preservation he tried so hard to hide. 

“I want you to choose us.”

Day 8

My flexibility is back to pre-surgery levels. I noticed the first signs of muscle atrophy in my legs. This is to be expected, and it isn't significant at this point. To keep the rest of my body in shape, I have been lifting using my backpack and one of my smaller suitcases. I can hit my arms, shoulders, lats and traps, but there isn't much I've been able to do to hit my chest. Not without buying a bench and some free weights (which I won't be doing).

On day 8, my ERC machine stopped working. I contacted Dr. Giotikas on WhatsApp, and he sent out a technician that same day. He arrived in the afternoon, and I had to do 3 of my .25 mm lengthenings at once. Surprisingly, I didn't feel much different doing them all at once.

Tasos, one of the physiotherapists, came out to my Airbnb around 5. We went over some exercises and he tested my flexibility. Based on my flexibility, it looks like I should be able to hit 7-8 cm. The only muscles that are tight on me are my hip flexors, so I will start adding a few more sets into those stretches.

Day 9

As an experiment I tried lengthening the full 1 mm in one session vs. 4. I felt some discomfort, but it wasn't terrible. I will stick with 4 lengthenings per day since that is what I was instructed to do, but it's good to know if I miss a few sessions I can make it up with minimal repercussions.

Today was relatively uneventful. Went to physiotherapy came home and worked. I was informed by the physiotherapists that I was the most flexible guy they have right now, so after hearing that I'm really shooting for the full 8 cm.

I have a training for my team back home from 11 PM - 1 AM tonight, and that's going to be rough. I tried to get a midday nap in (only about 30 minutes) and I had an afternoon cup of coffee.

Not sure if it's simply due to reduced food cravings or less cortisol production. Also not sure this is a ""benefit"" everyone gets obviously.   
  
Additional details, I'm overweight, 6 foot, was 240 lbs and am now 225 lbs, so weight loss might have come easier for me than healthy weight people.

1i2sie0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i2sie0/a_message_appeared_on_every_screen_in_the_world/,A message appeared on every screen in the world: HIDE.,"I stared with confusion at my phone. The rest of the gang were all-in on this Monopoly game.

“I swear to God, if you get Free Parking I will literally kill your stupid face,” said Evelyn.

Ravi rolled the dice in his hands. “*Come on,* sweet baby Jesus. I just need a *four.*” He dropped them onto the board. “Fuck!” he said, probably biffing it like always.

I tried to make sense of it. Just a word on my screen—black text on an all white background, a rather classical-looking font: 

**“HIDE”**

I tapped, rather impatiently, on the expensive black rectangle. The text wouldn’t disappear. 

“*AJ*,” Evelyn called, like a teacher busting a student. “You’re fucking addicted. Play board games like a normal human adult.”

“Yeah, I—sorry.” A few more desperate fingerpecks at the screen, then I turned to holding the power button down for an extended period. With my free hand, I grabbed the dice, rolled a three, landed on *B & O Railroad.* After two seconds of thought—“Nah, fuck railroads,” I said.

Of course, we weren’t animals. If someone didn’t want to buy a property, that was fine. No auctions or any of that nonsense. *House rules.*

Back to the phone as Hiro, on my left, took the cubes and prepared to drag his sorry little shoe across *Go* to collect his two hundred dollars. A minute with the power button didn’t do anything—we were entering factory reset territory. I contemplated borrowing Ravi’s laptop to Google whatever the fuck this might have been. 

I felt the apartment rumble—albeit, just for a split second. As if we were on the edge of an earthquake. I tensed, briefly. 

The background noise from the TV—*No One Wants This* autoplaying on Netflix—disappeared, following the faint sound of the flicker of static. 

Ravi was the first to get up. “I don’t…” he said, talking slowly as if not to jinx it, “I don’t *think* that was an earthquake?” He examined the TV, confused at the outage. He checked the wires. “Shouldn’t be the breaker—I don’t have that much stuff plugged in, do I?” 

I grappled with the sad, likely *hacked* state of my phone—and that weird word staring me down.

“Damn, that’s fucking weird,” I heard Hiro say, half-laughing.

Head lifted. “What?” I asked to catch Hiro turning his phone to me. His home screen too had been replaced by black text atop white. “HIDE” 

Evelyn, as anti-technology as it comes, had properly clocked this reprieve as her time to quickly respond to long outstanding texts. “The fuck?” she said. “What… is this?” 

At my confused look—bordering on scowl, *resting scowl face*—she flipped her phone around to show me the damage. It was the same on hers. 

I grew a bit nervous. “Ravi, where’s your phone?” I asked him.

“I’m sure it’s somewhere,” he said, still tinkering with the TV. Likely not due to any of his troubleshooting, it flashed back to life, red power light at the base blinking steadily.

A simple message now appeared on the big screen. 

“Hide?” Ravi asked, grabbing the remote and pressing buttons to switch back to Netflix, but nothing was registering.

“Dude,” I said. He turned around. I showed him my phone—Hiro and Evelyn showed theirs.

“That’s…” he looked back at the TV, then at us again, “wait *how is that possible?”*

“Is that like an amber alert?” Hiro asked.

“I mean I guess but that’s a push notification, this is like, *completely overtaking the screen.*” Ravi’s brows furrowed. “On different hardware, too.”

“A hack?” I asked.

He shrugged. “That’s kind of a weird hack, no?” 

“Government experiment?” Hiro again.

A thought came over me.

I walked to the balcony, slid the door open, stepped out onto it. Eye of Sauron’d the city from Ravi’s fourteenth floor apartment. 

In the neighboring apartment towers, most of the units had blinds down, curtains closed. The few unshuttered however—*I felt like that guy from Rear Window—*contained strangers staring perplexed at their phones. At their computers. The sides of bolted-to-the-wall TVs, barely visible to me, displayed the same white background with text atop it. What I was seeing, everyone else was seeing.

The others joined me on the balcony. 

“Whatever it is, it’s at least hit this block,” I said. I looked down at the city streets—most of the people below caught in a similar holding pattern of standing frozen, heads fixed to their devices. 

“I guess we don’t have anything to call the cops with?” Hiro. 

“I’m sure they’re aware.” Me.

“Maybe wait it out until they fix it?” Ravi.

I nodded. And yet, I could tell Evelyn was a bit perturbed. Forcing magnetic thoughts to imbue her silence with weight. “Thoughts?” I asked her.

“I mean, should we do it?” she asked.

“Do what?” Ravi. 

“Hide.” Her again.

“Hide where?” Ravi again. 

“I don’t know,” she said.

“I mean, we’re already in my apartment. I’m sure that’s—good enough, right?” he said.

A pause.  

“Let’s not lose our heads,” Ravi continued. “This is nuts but it’s not—I mean it’s not like, *literally hide,* right?”

Hiro clicked his fingers. “What if it’s viral marketing? Like for a movie?” Hiro with the necessary but unintentional levity.

“*Hacking our phones so we can’t use them?* I don’t know if that’s in Lionsgate’s purview, man,” I said, then, head turned to Evelyn. “But *hide?*”

The flicker in her eyes more than meant that she’d sided with the lightbulb in her head. She returned to the inside, and got to exploring Ravi’s apartment carefully. 

“What are you doing?” Ravi asked, trailing. Hiro and I followed.

“I don’t care if I look stupid. It could be a warning. Maybe something is happening,” she said. 

“We’re in a box in a box, basically,” said Ravi. “We’re fine Ev.”

“But the fucking *thing,*” she motioned to the TV, then to her own phone, “says *hide.* Maybe it’s *that* literal.” She continued scouting, finally settling on the sliding closet in Ravi’s room—the best she could come up with in his 600 square foot quarters. “I’ll do here unless you think there’s better.”

**“***Evelyn,****”*** Ravi stressed.

She shuffled in, past hung garments, scooching to the end to make space. “I’m gonna close the door soon, and if you’re all *really* my friends, you’ll join me.” 

Awkward silence until Hiro chimed first—

“I mean, guess it’s good to be safe right?” He went for it, second-guessed for a second, then committed to entering.

“You guys get the luxury of laughing at me forever if I’m dumb—win-win,” she called while Hiro wedged in beside her. A compelling argument, certainly.

Begrudgingly, I followed, tucking in next under Ravi’s dress clothes. There was still room for him inside his own closet.

“Fucking hell,” he caved, joining last, sliding the door closed to introduce darkness.

I went back to my phone. Still that classical font. Still that mandate.

“How long do we have to stay in here?” Ravi asked.

“Five minutes,” she said.

“Yeesh,” he tagged.

And then we sat in stillness for a while.

Distant *tick tick ticks* of the clock in the living room bringing down the blood pressure a tad. 

It all felt—silly. Kind of fun.

“Remember when we went camping at Sunlight Groves?” Hiro asked. 

“*Glamping,*” Ravi clarified.

“Ev thought she saw a bear.” Hiro laughed. “A bear and its cub.”

“It was dark, it fucking *looked like bears,*” she said, half-laughing herself. “I heard noises too.” 

“Bears at *Sunlight Groves,*” he said again. “Saddest patch of trees in America.” 

“Guys, shut up. We’re here so let’s commit to the bit. Before the *Conjuring* doll gets us,” said Ravi, surprisingly not bitterly.

We kept our traps zipped for another minute. 

Eyes at my phone again. “HIDE”—nonsensical, all of it really, but in a way that was starting to sit more and more uncomfortably for me. 

“What do you think it is?” Hiro whispered.

I shook my head. Evelyn with the light shrug. Ravi with a deep inhale before speaking. “I mean, *obviously sophisticated,*” he said, voice low. “Like it’s—yeah, it’s obviously *something*.”

I waved my phone. “My bank is on this and it’s bricked now basically? I’m fucked.”

“They’ll figure something out,” said Ravi.

Powerful knocks at his apartment door all of a sudden. Thundering.

“Hey!” a voice called, muffled through the walls. “Ravi, you there?”

Evelyn braced. *“Who is that?”*

“A skinwalker, obviously,” replied Ravi. “Kidding—my neighbor Monica.”  

Evelyn reached across me and Hiro to tug at Ravi’s sleeve. *“Are you positive?”*

“*Yes,* and I should probably get it.”

“You said five minutes,” she said.

“Yeah but I’m being a pretty trash neighbor right now,” he replied.

The knocking persisted. So did the words. *“I have this weird thing on my phone—Brad has it too. It says Hide? TV same thing, computer same thing, I don’t know how to reach anyone or what to do—*” the neighbor trailed on. 

Ravi blew air out of his nose. “Alright, this is stupid, I’m gonna—”

“No!” said Evelyn, but then all of a sudden—

He stopped. 

We all stopped. 

*I felt something*. Something very, very real—

No knocking anymore. Or at least, I couldn’t hear anything. Not the tick of the clock, nor the soft rustle of us against clothing. It was like the world was holding its breath. 

Like there was a *presence.* Right outside the closet. 

Then—the sting of static in my ear, before—

It passed. 

Whatever it was, the feeling dissipated, the sound returned, and I sneaked a glance at my phone—

The word HIDE was gone and replacing it was my home screen. 

The silence between the four of us was uncomfortable. 

“Did you feel that?” Evelyn finally whispered.

No one said anything. Ravi outstretched his arm yet again to slide the door open, but his hands were shaking. 

“You can do it,” I whispered. “I think we’re good.”

He steeled himself, looking very much like he was crossing some sort of internal threshold. He pulled the door aside, revealing his room exactly as we’d left it. 

We took it in. 

“I’m gonna answer Monica,” he said, with not a whole lot of vigor to his voice, getting up and creeping out of the room. The rest of us followed, stopping in the living room while he continued to the door.

I went to Twitter, searched ‘Hide’ and sorted by new. Evelyn, meanwhile, grabbed the remote from the stand and turned the TV—now “Hideless”–-on and maneuvered through the Roku channels.

“What are you looking for?” Hiro asked.

“Just like, a *live* channel, I guess.” she replied. “The news?” 

My scrolling wasn’t yielding anything of help or insight, though it was clear—via the confused posts from seemingly around the whole world—that the scope of whatever happened was global. 

My focus shifted to Ravi, who was standing on the welcome mat, eye pressed against the door’s peephole. He hadn’t moved in quite some time.

“Everything alright man?” I asked.

He didn’t reply. Just stood there, frozen.

I approached slowly. 

“She’s… she’s…” I heard him croak.

I reached him, patting him on the shoulders and urging him to detach from the door viewer. He finally did, leaning against the wall at first before slowly sliding to a seat on the floor.

I peered into the hallway through the hole.

Outside, his neighbor—the one knocking—

Looked like she’d been skewered. Decimated.

An explosion of blood in the hallway. 

“What…” I felt a buzz on my phone. I pulled it out.

**“AGAIN”**

Before I could even process, I heard Ravi and Evelyn react.

“There’s another one—”

“It says *again* now—”

I turned to see the foreboding word on the TV. “Fuck.”

“So we should hide again?” Hiro called.

Much like Ravi, I was shellshocked.

“AJ, what do you think we should do?” he repeated. 

“Evelyn,” I said, trying to force the words out of my mouth. “You had good instincts the first time—what—*what do you think*?”

“How much time do you think we have?” she asked.

*How much time passed between when I first saw the word HIDE and when we felt that presence in the closet?*

“It might’ve been ten minutes,” I heard Ravi mutter, almost lifeless. 

“I… don’t…” then Evelyn interrupted herself, “wait, what did you just see outside?”

She started approaching the door. I stopped her. “I don’t… think it’ll be good… for you to see it.”

“Are—are you serious?” she responded.

“*Yes,*” I said, immediately realizing that lying might have been smarter.

“We can’t assume we have the same amount of time,” Ravi added. 

I went with my pitch. “Do we try the same spot?” 

Hiro started pacing, thinking, tapping his foot. “It’s—if we think about it, it said “hide” and we hid. Now it’s saying “again” and *obviously* that means that—whatever happened, is gonna—happen again.” He gave us a look, as if he could see, in our drained expressions, what was waiting on the other side of the door.

“That’s… a great recap man,” I said.

“What I mean,” he said, struggling, “is that when you’d play, as a kid, if you kept picking the same spot over and over, eventually it’d catch up to you.” 

“Are we really trying to apply some sort of logic to this?” Ravi mumbled.

Evelyn fortified herself. “I think he’s right. It’s *nuts* and I can’t believe I’m saying this, but we need to operate on gut. And *gut* tells me—we pick better spots this time.”

“But *spots* makes it sound like we should split up?” I said, looking around, slowly realizing that the limited real estate we had to work with meant this suggestion made more sense than I would’ve liked. I turned to Ravi. “Where should we all go?” 

He shook his head, palmed his forehead a few times as if to slap himself back to reality. “We do…” he started, thinking, “Two under my bed,” he grimaced, letting neurons collide in his mind, “One of us in the utility closet, the other… laundry closet.” He got up and pointed—one of the closets was right behind me. Life in him again. “Now!”

My eyes flitted to Hiro and Evelyn, who ran into the bedroom. 

Ravi gave me a nod, before entering the laundry closet and awkwardly squeezing in with the washer and dryer, closing his door.

I entered the utility closet, and closed mine.

Rather—I tried to. The door wasn’t clicking shut.

*“Fuck,”* I said, “Ravi, the door, it’s not—” but then I fought the urge to say anything more. If time was up, I’d compromise my spot, hell, compromise his spot too if I kept talking. I tried a few more times to get it to close, then—

I committed, terrified out of my mind, to gripping the handle and holding the door shut. I tried to keep my shaking hand and quickening breath in check as—

The silence overtook again. *Complete* silence, and *then,* that presence—

I felt a light tug at the door. I kept my hold firm but didn’t try to overpower–-didn’t want to completely give it away—

And again, it stopped. 

The feeling disappeared. And I waited fifteen seconds before sneaking a look at my phone, to see that the “AGAIN” warning was gone.

I heard the sound of Ravi’s door swing open first. I followed with mine.

He was emotional. “I forgot that that door is fucked, I got scared man, and I was—”

“You’re all good—it’s alright man, I know—”

“I even heard you call for me, and I didn’t, I—I panicked and I thought it’d—”

“We’re alive man, it’s alright, we’re—” and immediately I remembered it wasn’t just *us*. “*Evelyn and Hiro.*”

“Right,” he said. We rushed to his bedroom.

Nothing—at first. The two hadn’t emerged yet. For a moment, the horrifying thought that we’d be pulling their corpses out from under the bed rushed past me.

“Guys,” I said, “Coast is clear. Quick—”

Silence. For quite some time, before they finally shuffled out in one piece, alive.

As they shifted from crawl to bend to standing, I wanted to hold them. Hold everyone. For just a second, I felt a newfound appreciation for life and their faces and personalities.

Another buzz on my phone. I took a look: 

**“BREAK TIME”**

I let out a sigh of relief and showed the message to the others. 

“I guess that’s good,” Evelyn said. “A second to catch our breaths, after this fucking *craziness.*”

“But then what?” Ravi asked. “Is this just gonna *continue?*”

We walked into the living room together, nervously.

“We haven’t even gotten a single second to wrap our heads around this,” Evelyn again. 

Something in me didn’t seem right. 

I didn’t feel good. 

“Hey, Ev, how’d you know that we should’ve stayed in the closet for five minutes?” Hiro asked, somewhat pointedly.

I clocked minor annoyance in her face at the question. “I didn’t *know* anything—it was a guess. But I mean, yeah, you guys were fucking lucky I was here and pushed for it, because *fuck* were you all being stubborn.” 

Hiro wore a strange expression as he looked at her. “Alright.”

“Sounds like you want to say something more,” she said.

“Why would I? What makes you think I’d—”

Ravi interrupted Hiro by stepping between the two of them. “*Holy hell,* keep your heads on people,” but as he said it, and maybe it was just an aberration in my mind, but I couldn’t help but feel something significant stir within me, something *really* inflame, as if even though his face was straight he was concealing some sort of inner smile at what was happening.

“Hiro, I think you’re focusing your skepticism in the wrong direction,” I said.

Ravi’s expression turned irritated, which all but confirmed it for me. 

“I don’t know if you want to be mad at the person that saved us the first time,” I said, trying to make a point by motioning to Evelyn, but as I looked at her, something felt wrong there too. I contained it. “Or rather, the person who wanted to *open the closet door*.”

And then something even more obvious hit me.

“Wait, Ravi, *you tried to kill me*.”

And all of a sudden, I was glaring at him, my temper rising by metric tons every second as if it was all starting to make sense. Evelyn and Hiro joined me.

Ravi looked incredulous. “I already admitted that I fucked up with the door—*I confessed to you!* Why are you trying to make things worse? I was trying to calm them down—” then, noticing us approach him, he backed towards the kitchen cabinets. He pointed at me. “You were on your phone when this first happened,” he said, as if he were having his own revelation. “You were waiting—waiting for it to start—”

“That’s an *insane* fucking misdirect,” I said, positive that I couldn’t trust him. But as my eyes turned to Evelyn and Hiro, I realized I couldn’t trust them either, couldn’t trust anyone. 

*Still,* Ravi absolutely needed to be the first to go, the first to be disposed of. 

He grabbed a knife from the cupboard and held it out at us.

And only the smallest thought in the back of my mind was telling me that we were being toyed with—that it was so incredibly obvious that whatever this was, it had a handle on us, but unfortunately that understanding was academic for me at best, as I kept finding string after string of thoughts and emotions connecting, everything adding up, the logic *sound*, my emotions *inflamed*—

“Break time,” Evelyn said. “It’s breaking us.”

*Of course she would know that though, if she were in on it.*

We all looked at her. I watched for sudden movements from any of these traitors—these bastards. Even a millimeter shift wouldn’t get past me.

“It’s overriding us, it’s flooding us with anger that isn’t ours, and *real as it feels*—”

She faced her phone at us, beckoning us to read it clearly:

**“BREAK TIME”**

“We can’t fall to it.”

And that small grounded part of me took over, even though I was sure with everything in my soul that she, Ravi, and Hiro were the source of everything that was happening. 

Ravi’s grip on the knife tightened as he and the rest of us remained in the bizarre equilibrium of our four-way stand off. 

*It’s all of you,* I thought to myself, before I felt a lightness overtake me. 

Like an insatiable hunger fading, or extreme fear dissipating when you realize that noise in the other room wasn’t a person but rather something knocking over, my feelings of unrest and paranoia were gone. My phone screen, once again, returned to its default background.

It was hard to describe how I felt now. *Lucidity. Shame.* I looked at Ravi sadly. His head hung low as he put the knife back in its place.

Hiro turned to Evelyn first. “I’m sorry,” he said. Then to Ravi. “Sorry.”

“Sorry guys,” Ravi.

“I’m sorry.” Me.

“You’re welcome, assholes.” Evelyn. *We deserved that.*

“That was fucking—insane,” Ravi said.

“Like a fucked up rollercoaster ride,” said Evelyn.

“I didn’t—that, *that wasn’t totally me*,” Hiro said. “Like, *something was in me*, and it was—”

“It’s okay man.” I was getting tired of saying it, and certainly I out of everyone didn’t deserve to impart forgiveness anyway after where my own head was at only thirty seconds ago. 

“We need to like, write something down—like *we are susceptible. Don’t forget—”* started Ravi.

“We just need to remember to keep your heads on,” I interrupted, “Remember—”

But I think the fear that “AGAIN” would pop up on our phones drove him to start rummaging for some paper, start scribbling some words on it, while the rest of us tried to soak in the reprieve of *nothing happening.* Every half-second a luxury.

I wanted to say “sorry” another twenty or so times—something I was sure wasn’t a feeling unique to me.

“I feel like I’m losing myself,” I said. It felt like I was in a dream at this point.

“Yeah,” said Ravi. “*Yeah.*”

“We’re…” Hiro said, looking at us carefully. “Probably all gonna die. Should we like, say our words, I guess?”

“Don’t—don’t talk like that,” said Evelyn.

“How many people do you think are dead?” Hiro asked.

I went to the TV (temporarily free yet again from one or two word mandates), turned it on, toggled through the home page until I found the livestream of a soccer game.

One fixed camera angle. Everyone in the stadium—torn apart. Players on the field within frame—eviscerated.

I returned to the home page, navigating in an attempt to find a different live program. I clicked on what appeared to be a news channel I hadn’t heard of before.

The sight of an empty desk appeared. Wires leading under the desk made me think that perhaps the anchor was hiding under it.

“We are trying to report,” he said, “knowing that the signal is going to cut out. I’ve survived so far, survived whatever exactly this might be, but the carnage from footage I’ve seen is extensive. *I strongly recommend—*”

The broadcast was interrupted by the new word:

**“SEEK”**

Again, in classical lettering. 

And the screen cracked, then shattered with a loud pop, sending bits of glass onto the floor—

As did the screen on my phone that I’d placed on the coffee table—

As did the phones in Evelyn and Hiro’s hands too, reactively dropped on the floor by the pair, a weak bounce before settling—

I panicked.

“Seek, *seek*—” I said desperately, trying to jolt my brain to the task. 

“Maybe something out of place?” Evelyn said.

“What if we have to find what’s killing everyone?” said Hiro.

“I don’t…” I started, but I couldn’t even muster up a close to the sentence.

I ran to the balcony, outside, to see if there was something obvious to look for—in the sky, in the city. What I spotted on the neighboring high-rises was bloodstained curtains, unrecognizable bodies where blinds were lifted, and—as my eyes darted from spot to spot—*a lead.*

A small TV in one of the apartments. The screen looked unbroken. A word on it I couldn’t make out—five letters was the best I could do.

“*It’s the screens,”* I said. “We need to find a screen that still works!”

I ran back into the living room.

“Does anyone have binoculars?”

They all looked at me.

“Why the fuck would anyone have binoculars?” Ravi asked.

“There’s a—there’s a screen *I think,* in one of the other apartment buildings, it’s working, there’s a word, but I can’t see it—we need to find another one, I don’t know, I—”

I ran into Ravi’s office. Computer screen broken. *Fuck.* Grabbed his laptop—shattered. *Nope.*

I nervously tapped my chest with the fingertips of both of my hands while the rest desperately searched for something viable too.

*Did I have to run to the other apartment?*

*Would there even be enough time?*

*How would I even get in?*

And then, like a bolt of the blue, it hit me.

“Ravi, where’s your phone?”

His voice was a little confused. “I don’t know man I lose it all the time—”

“*Find it.”*

“You really think that’s it?” 

“We’re looking for a functioning screen—it’s the only one we haven’t ruled out yet.” I turned to Hiro next. “Check out the other apartments on this floor. See if any of the doors are unlocked—if they are, go inside, check everything—phones, laptops, TVs, doesn’t matter, see if there’s a message intact on any of them.”

“On it,” he said, rushing to the door, opening it, freaking out at the body in front of it, nearly tripping, then composing himself and rushing into the hallway as the door closed behind him. 

We tore apart Ravi’s apartment next.

*Couch cushions.* “Where do you usually lose it?” I asked.

*My head peeked under the bed.* Peeked into counters alongside Evelyn, desperately. “I don’t man,” he answered, “it’s stupid but sometimes I literally just chuck it across the room—”

*Helpful—supremely helpful.*

In the bathroom, I looked in the medicine cabinet. Then—back into his room, to his closet, checking the pockets of all of his pants. I started to feel the inevitable looming. *This was the one that was going to kill us, wasn’t it?* 

“Love you guys,” I heard Evelyn say almost under her breath, like she could feel it too. 

No tangible ticker counting down, but a feeling in my chest. A train closing in, with us tied to the tracks.

Ravi running to the TV stand, looking behind, then, under books, under shelves—

And I was back in the living room again, *sure* there was nothing left, my eyes lowering to the painful game we’d started our deadly evening with—Monopoly.

Specifically, to the messy pile of 50’s, 20’s and 10’s on Ravi’s side of the board. I knew his etiquette for swapping some of them out for hundreds was quite poor. The cash stacked high, which made sense—he was *crushing* all game. *And yet—*

I crouched and did an even more aggressive sweep of the spot that we’d started our desperate search at, to discover his preserved Samsung Galaxy A35 underneath the fake money, with a new word to greet me:

**“SMILE”**

And it really did feel like time was up this time. 

“Ifoundityouhavetosmile!” I screamed like a goddamn auctioneer.

Evelyn turned first from her spot in the kitchen—“What?!”

I ripped the phone from the ground and held up the message to her. “Smile!”

She mirrored my uncomfortable expression—all teeth, feigned happiness—as did Ravi as he bolted out of the room before even seeing the message on the phone *or* my intense eyes—

Hiro threw open the door—

“Couldn’t find anything, I’m sorry!” he screamed. He saw our wide smiling faces and our eyes screaming at him to get the hint as I tried to mouth the word while keeping my pose, but instead it sounded like “SMUHHH.”

And yet, despite the confusing sight—

With the luckiest stroke in the world, he copied and showed me those pearly whites. 

I retained my beaming smile, feeling a tear of fear travel down my cheek, my eyes glued to Ravi’s phone in my hand, *hoping and praying that we wouldn’t all get torn apart—*

And the word disappeared. I showed the group the proof, and one by one our cheery expressions dropped to our default nervous frowns. *Resting scowl face restored.*

A collective exhale.

“I can’t fucking do this,” said Ravi.

“I know,” Evelyn added.

And unlike some of the gaps we’d been afforded in the past, I already spotted a new message on the single, remaining functional phone left in my right hand:

**“POINT TO SACRIFICE”**

I could feel the group’s eyes on me. I couldn’t hide the misery.

“What?” Ravi asked.

“Point to sacrifice,” I said, barely legible.

“AJ?” Evelyn asked.

I tilted the phone so they could read it. I couldn’t say the words any louder—my body wouldn’t let me.

Underneath the words, a timer had been running. One that was already down to *1:45, 1:44, 1:43* by the time I flashed them the phone.

And yet still, all of us needed more seconds to let it settle.

I felt defeated. Truly, this time.

“Alright,” said Ravi, cutting through the holding pattern. “So what? We talk it through with the time we have left? Maybe we all agree on someone to point at? I mean, hey, fuck knows what I have to live for.”

Hiro next. “I—my family, Mom, Dad, siblings, I wasn’t even thinking of them this whole time. They’re all probably dead, they—”

“Yeah,” I interrupted, his words hitting me immediately and curbing any remaining social etiquette I had left—*everyone I had ever known was likely gone—*“I, uhh, *wow*—”

Evelyn smiled at us softly. “I just have you guys now,” she said. “So uh yeah—*fuck this,*” she said, *immediately* pointing to herself, almost causing me to die right there in fear she’d be torn apart immediately, but the counter was still ticking down. “I flip the board on this bullshit,” she said, without wavering.

*1:12*

*1:11*

*1:10*

Hiro pointed to himself. “Fuck it—yeah. You know what, I flip the board too,” he said.

I looked at him, almost nervously, exasperated. “Really, after *all that*, guys?”

*1:07*

*1:06*

*1:05* 

“If there *is* a hell,” Ravi said, “Unlikely, but what the fuck—maybe we dodge that bullet.” He curled his index finger back towards himself. “Flip the fucking board.”

I just looked at them. It was strange to feel a deluge of selfish thoughts flood into me all at once.

*0:40*

*0:39*

*0:38*

“Alright,” I said, copying my peers. “Let’s do it.” I pointed at myself too, like we were all playing Simon says or something. 

*0:33*

*0:32*

*0:31*

I took an appreciative look at my old friends. The longest-standing friends I’d ever had in my stupid life.

And then, at the Monopoly board we were playing on. 

It really was quite an awful game—I wasn't sure why we’d always subject ourselves to it.

*0:27*

*0:26*

I saw the pile of money on “Free Parking.”

*0:23*

*0:22*

The only way to make it fun was to play with bullshit rules—house rules.

*0:20*

*0:19*

“Wait,” I said. “Follow me.” I sprinted to the door. 

I opened it, held it open for the rest.

*0:15*

*0:14* 

*0:13*

I pointed at Ravi’s dead neighbor in the hallway in front of the door. Monica. 

“We didn’t know what we were dealing with, until she died. Her *sacrifice* gave us a chance,” I said, almost looking up as if I was speaking to whoever was enacting this terror on us. 

I was aware it was a reach. 

*0:09*

*0:08*

“And we’ve probably lost a lot of humanity since then, so—sorry,” I said, pointing at her. “And thank you.”

*0:06*

*0:05*

And my best friends pointed too. A real morbid way to close things out, with a clash of “Sorry” and “Thank you” escaping them as what would likely be their last words—I had really interrupted what was quite a nice moment inside for this strangeness.

*0:02*

*0:01*

*0:00*

“House rules,” I said.

And then I prepared myself for it—*pain, then annihilation.* 

…

But nothing came.

Instead, Ravi’s phone in my hand just read—

**“GOOD GAME”**

Before defaulting to Ravi’s home page picture—a Borzoi. He didn’t even own one, he was just obsessed with that breed of dog.

We stood there for ten minutes it felt, before we finally ventured inside, single-file, like a group of polite zombies.

I was unsure what to make of what had happened—what to do, who to check on, the state of the world, what was going on around me.

I sat back down at the Monopoly board. The others, in an almost Manchurian candidate sort of way, took their spots too.

“I think it was my turn,” I said, slowly. 

I grabbed the dice. I rolled. It was a ten.

I tapped my Top Hat icon on each square until I landed on *Short Line Railroad*.

“Do you want to buy it?” Evelyn asked me.

I thought about it for too long. Finally—

“Sure.”",51,1737044171.0,nosleep,3,0.97,False

Whenever I saw my crush. Time always stops (just a metaphor ofc). I can't hear anything. Things around me paused. My vision blurred out and all my eyes are on him.. 

They say if you have a crush to someone, u feel butterfly in your stomach. But for me i cant feel it. Just i dont hear anything. Evething is in slowmo.

Just like a while ago, i bought a coffee on our pantry area, i saw him walking and enter to a door. And just me staring a him walking. Just felt silence and realized that im smiling after he walkef away..


Ps. He doesnt know me. We are not friends.

1i2sh8v,https://i.redd.it/xase710xrdde1.jpeg,"Fake YouTube Livestream Scam: $20,000 a month on probably children","I’ve had this individual popping up in my YouTube shorts every day as a livestream. Only thing is: it’s a fake livestream begging for donations. It’s a video of him playing slop games live, like flappy bird, but it’s the same video on loop. In the video, he’s got text saying stuff like “$20=restart”, “$50=smash keyboard”, all the way up to “$500=end stream.” However obviously he never does these actions since the video is pre recorded, but being shown as “live” on loop. I’ve seen people donate hundreds of dollars in just a few hours of watching the scam take place. Obviously this is children doing this. Better yet, he’s proud of what he’s doing. On his Instagram, https://www.instagram.com/captainslaxyt?igsh=MXYxZDE5ODQ2azVyMg==, he proudly proclaims he makes $20,000+ a month doing this. And there’s nothing wrong with the scam because it’s “not against TOS”. 

And I know there are other people out there doing this, exploiting children with their parents credit cards. Messaged coffee on signal, but I really want this scam to see some light. I’ve spent many many hours in his live streams informing people not to donate, as it is a fake livestream. And also reported many times to YouTube, but nothing happens. I think this scam needs awareness, I’ve never seen anyone talk about it. ",1,1737044093.0,Coffeezilla_gg,0,0.6,False

We both have knowledge of teas and experience managing a restaurant. We also have the funds to start the business. We recently found a storefront that would be great. It's located downtown near a campus and many other small businesses. There is another cafe nearby that focuses on coffee and we feel that with our different hours and menu, we could maintain a sustainable business in the same community. Unfortunately, we discovered just last night that one of the popular local coffee chains in our area is opening right across the street from our planned location. They sell the sugary iced coffees that everyone raves about and now I'm feeling like this venture may need to be relocated. I don't want to waste our time and money. I know tea isn't as popular as coffee and don't want to get lost in the excitement of this new coffee chain coming to town. Any thoughts/opinions? ",1,1737044073.0,smallbusiness,3,1.0,False

I’ve been off pre workout and energy drinks for about 1 months and 12 days. I felt a lot better since before I was getting all sorts of symptoms panic attacks, headaches. 

Well I decided to try drinking coffee had about 2 cups ish not strong coffee, I was okay the whole day but when I was about to sleep I just felt this tidal wave of fight or flight, some sort of shockwave and then I started trembling and shaking. It lasted about an hour or so. I tried calming myself down because the shakes were uncontrollable. 

Any idea if I need to do clearly stay off since it feels like I can’t even have a cup of coffee like my body rejects it or it stresses my body.
