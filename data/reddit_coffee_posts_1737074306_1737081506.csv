1i36bce,https://www.reddit.com/r/flashfiction/comments/1i36bce/mr_squeezy_man_and_ms_somia/,Mr. Squeezy Man and Ms. Somia,"Everyone has their demons. Mine have names.

There is Mr. Squeezy Man. He normally works the day shift but has been known to work overtime. He lives right behind my nose. Whenever I try to wake up from behind my eyes, he takes his big, strong, gray, pustulated hands, places his fingers on my top eyelid, and his thumb on my bottom eyelid, and tries to force my eyes closed.

Mr. Squeezy Man is one of the few that I have never seen face to face. All I see of him are his hands, with their chipped and rotted fingernails, which only happens when his hands lose their grip and slide off my eyelids. The only way to free myself of Mr. Squeezy Man‚Äôs vicelike grip is with coffee. He has gotten stronger over the years. In high school, one cup was enough‚Äîand that was with cream and sugar‚Äîbut now I need no less than three cups of the strongest, blackest coffee available.

Then there is Ms. Somia. She works the night shift. She lives inside my pillow. Her body is roughly the size of a cat, but she has arms long enough to reach the other side of my queen-size bed. Her skin is purple and wrinkled, like a grape that isn‚Äôt quite a raisin.

Whenever I am about to fall asleep, she likes to play a trick on me. Sometimes, she cups one hand around my ear, making a megaphone, and uses the other to bang on the radiator. Other times, she gives me an anti-massage, which is very much like a regular massage, except that the longer it continues, the stiffer and tenser I become.

But she has been known to play other tricks on me, such as tugging the blanket away from my feet so I get too cold, or using her long arms to bang on the ceiling, imitating the sound of the neighbors walking above. (I haven‚Äôt had upstairs neighbors in years.)

There are a couple of ways to free myself from the effects of her little tricks. I can work out before bed, but that is only when Mr. Potato is off shift. Or I can take melatonin. Like Mr. Squeezy Man, she has also gotten stronger. I used to go through a bottle every two months in high school, and now I am lucky if the bottle of melatonin lasts me a week.

1i369xe,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1i369xe/i_just_got_divorced_by_my_fake_husband_and_i/,I just got divorced by my fake ‚Äòhusband.‚Äô And I didn‚Äôt expect to be so weirdly torn up about it.,"Y‚Äôall please help I‚Äôm a genuine MESS. 

and i know the title‚Äôs got people like ‚Äò???‚Äô for sure. so let me try and explain it quickly to make it less confusing.

i‚Äôm 22F in college. I am a lesbian. My best friend is also 22M and is my roommate. He is gay. Last year for April Fools we decided to get fake married because everyone thought we were dating. We got rings and everything. Invited people to the coffee shop on campus and stuff. 


Today after nearly a year of this fake marriage, he interrupted me while I was doing homework and gave me fake divorce papers. I thought it was a joke and I was confused, and then he (poorly) tried to explain himself. That he‚Äôs been trying to pull away from me, from *us* for the past semester or so and me being the autistic girl i am was totally oblivious. he said he felt his boundaries were being crossed (because i‚Äôm a very touchy person and sometimes do so to express what i can‚Äôt verbally), and that lately he‚Äôs felt that i‚Äôve been using our fake marriage as a way to trap him into hanging out with me. 

obviously this is only his side of the story but since it was so out of nowhere to me I was kind of??? Freaked out??? In shock? Idk??? And I know what you‚Äôre probably thinking. ‚ÄòGirl you‚Äôre both gay it‚Äôs a fake marriage move on.‚Äô And I don‚Äôt want to pull the ‚Äòit was real to me!!!!‚Äô shit but like‚Ä¶ kind of. You know those characters in media (cough cough sasuke and naruto) who have such a will they won‚Äôt they relationship that no one really knows what they are to each other, not even them? That‚Äôs how it felt. And he has been there through my worst moments. We‚Äôve said we loved each other in the midst of many nights last year of me crying my eyes out because of the shit in my life constantly blowing up in my face. And I felt like constantly reminding him (and myself) of my undying devotion to him was a way to pay him back for that. 

I know it‚Äôs been toxic for awhile. Like genuinely. Never did I think I would get into a weird codependent something with my gay best friend where he is scared i‚Äôm gonna cease to exist without him and i‚Äôm scared that he‚Äôs gonna leave me. Like GIRL HE ISNT EVEN YOUR BOYFRIEND!!!!

And I know by now you‚Äôre probably like ‚Äòyeah girl this sounds like you had some unrequited love thing for him and he finally shut you down.‚Äô but i genuinely didn‚Äôt love him romantically. it was weird because he was my first real friend in college and i think since i never had friends growing up i just based it on what i know from media and formed this deep bond.

so many people told me i need to get space from him. because it was so bad last semester that i wouldn‚Äôt eat at the dining hall without him. i grew distant from all my friends that weren‚Äôt mutual friends of him. hell, i PUT MY LIFE on hold for him (literally- as in I switched my major just to be with him and then realized i had geology and luckily switched back). I almost transferred but didn‚Äôt because I‚Äôd be so sad without him even though now I kind of think it would‚Äôve been better for the both of us.

Anyways, yeah. He felt suffocated and felt like he was making it seem too much like a joke so he had to actually set the record straight tonight. I mostly just stared at him like a dead fish because he‚Äôs so conflicted avoidant that I never realized anything was an issue until he throws it in my face (which we also talked about as being something he needs to work on so people are less confused), but it still hurt. Like I‚Äòve been blasting ribs by lorde for the past hour LOL.

And I know it‚Äôs a blessing in disguise. My mom used to always say to never give up my life for a man (even a gay one), and she wanted to literally slam her head into a wall when she saw how ridiculously codependent I was to him. And I worked hard to break it over summer and winter break but it‚Äôs hard. But lately I‚Äôve been wanting my post grad self to look a lot different. While I used to beg him to confirm that we‚Äôd be getting an apartment together and be together forever, now I kind of want to be alone. Not because I hate him but because I‚Äôve been living to prevent other people from leaving for years and now I think it‚Äôs time I need to live for myself, even though that‚Äôs fucking scary as hell. And I know I shouldn‚Äôt jump to conclusions and think this means he hates me and doesn‚Äôt want to be around me cause he said he‚Äôs not mad but my brain is wired that way so i‚Äôm trying to just tell myself this is just boundaries for the both of us so we don‚Äôt inadvertently blow each other up and instead can watch each other thrive from a healthy distance as two healthy best friends.

So, yeah. I dunno. I needed to get this out somewhere cause I didn‚Äôt have anyone to talk to about it and it‚Äôs weird. Bittersweet sort of.",3,1737081187.0,TwoXChromosomes,0,1.0,False

The morning was peaceful and we actually got along. We took a nice long car ride and got coffee together. It was a great feeling. Around noon we split, him playing video games and me scrolling on my phone. He comes into the room and starts to pick on me playfully however I just wasn't in the mood. I wasn't even fully annoyed or anything I just didn't want to be messed with and told him to stop twice. He reached for the blanket I had on my lap and tries to snatch it off of me but I caught it and firmly told him to stop for the final time. 

Immeadiately he launches into a tirade: Why can't I be nice to him, why am I treating him like this, that he wasn't even messing with me, etc. I wasn't even annoyed or anything I just didn't want to be messed with and that me telling him to stop doesn't mean that I wasn't being nice. He attempts gaslighting me by claiming that he wasn't even grabbing for the blanket DESPITE it literally being in his hand. And to that I told him to stop playing stupid, that I saw him with my own two eyes. At this point, I'm still not even bothered, ya'know? I see through him games and know how to handle myself now. It's just like....stop bothering me lol

He storms out of the room but before doing so he calls me a bitch with a smirk and then flies to the bedroom to slam the door and lock it. He avoids me for the next 2-3 hours. Okay. Not my problem. 

Around 5pm I realize that dinner still needs to be made for our son. The plan was to stop by the store to pick up a nice birthday steak dinner for him + brownies made by me but he's still doling out the silent treatment; I ended up defrosting some hamburger to at least have something. I swear the second he heard me bounce ideas off our kiddo for dinner he finally left the room and wants to know if we could go to the store with him. Before I even get a full sentence out letting him know that I'm fine with doing that, it's just that I have meat thawing out as a plan B and to give me a sec to put it in the fridge he's, for the second time today, walking away from me and heading back to the bedroom to throw a temper tantrum. 

A firm boundary that I've placed for myself is that I do not chase after him. However me still wanting him to have a good birthday dinner despite his poor behavior, I went to him. 

Cue ""The Argument"" -- There's no problem on his end and that I'm desperate to argue for no reason, I need to be an adult, I can't let things go (ie him calling me a bitch), his communication is perfect and it's me that lacks skills, I must respect him if he doesn't want to talk, blah blah blah. Even with all this BS I'm still asking him to just move forward with me so at the very least *he* can have a birthday dinner. My favorite quote: ""Even on my birthday, you're still trying to make it about you"" and with that he slams the door in my face and locks it again. 

I'm still not even hurt, bothered or annoyed by his narcissism. I'm just incredibly frustrated because I've realized that they all play by the same rulebook. I mentally predicted every single action and reaction before he even did it. If anything, I'm more annoyed in myself for continuing to play this game of his. 

That was yesterday and today he tried the route of resetting and acting as if nothing happened. No. Something did happen and I'm not going to pretend like it didn't. So now as I write this post it's coming after another (mini) argument where I demand for accountability. Unfortunately, he'd rather victimize himself. ",1,1737081028.0,u_melonmoscato,0,1.0,False

1i36696,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jung/comments/1i36696/david_lynch_on_therapy/,David Lynch on therapy.,"The video accompanying this post is a fragment taken from an [interview](https://youtu.be/g8UnCjeLev4?si=pMNmkDvUaYBmkX5q) conducted by Charlie Rose with David Lynch in 1997. In it, Rose asks Lynch if he has ever been to therapy, he answers that ‚Äú*it was only once, because that process could alter his creativity and the way he generates ideas*.‚Äù This is one of the many reasons why I have voluntarily decided not to attend these spaces, without the intention of disparaging the profession of psychoanalysis.

And, of course, not all minds are the same, we are not all born under the same conditions, we don't all have the same privileges or the same genetic background, which strongly influence the chemical processes of our brains. My refuges in times of crisis are established, and they are nothing more than the simple things in life: a good coffee in the morning, an exercise routine, spending time with the people I love and who love me, expressing emotions when necessary, listening to or making music, creating without haste, and even romanticizing chaos in a certain way, all of this within the limits that life itself imposes. Nothing more is needed, everything is there.

If David Lynch, being one of the 90s most prestigious directors, and therefore having a significant net worth with his productions, is told by a psychoanalyst ‚Äîalso prestigious, I suppose‚Äî that therapy can affect his creativity, then what is expected for the other anonymous creatives in the industry? Even people in my close social circle have told me about their experiences and many have been bad, because as in every profession, there are good and bad professionals, many of my friends have had to go from office to office trying to find one that ‚Äú*works for them*,‚Äù which also ends up impacting their own personal economy, because these consultations are not free.

Let us dedicate ourselves to living, but not under the standards of this society of immediacy; let us allow ourselves to live under our own convictions, because that is what the system and unnecessary eagerness want to take away from us.

It's my genuine wish that, in the distant future, we'll look back together and remember today as the start of a great and true friendship.  

First, my struggle. You can skip this part. Really. Consider it a preface by a curmudgeonly academic who talks to himself about Walt Whitman and eats many Werther's Originals.  

2024 was an adventure that went nowhere, a tearful year that began with my move to a new city in a new state (literally on New Year's Day) and concluded before I could achieve my top goal: to make a new friend. That's right, I failed to make any friends for an entire year (and counting). Working long hours from home for a company on the opposite coast probably wasn't the best idea; and although I attended movie meetups, joined an astronomy club, hung out on live jazz nights, showed up at my local nature center for group hikes, volunteered for a literacy program, and got a few pretty snazzy haircuts along the way, it just wouldn't, didn't, happen.  

Now maybe you're asking yourself, ""What's wrong with this guy?"" And to that I smile and say, You're not alone; I've been asking myself the same question.  

As someone who loves writing, reading, and all things peaceful, my tendency toward solitude became a real problem for the first time in my life last year. I learned: Without friendship there is no solitude. And when I resolved to ditch the books and pens and reach out for connection, I was surprised to find: silence. By the time I left Thanksgiving cards for my neighbors in the adjacent apartments letting them know how grateful I am to have them nearby, my health was suffering. And when, one day at a time, my neighbors didn't reply, still haven't replied, I have felt loneliness as an actual physical pain. In recent weeks I've taken to buying dinner for the person or people behind me in line at Chipotle just to feel included the world, to enjoy some tiny human connection and kindness. When I did this on my birthday, the woman and her daughter each hugged me; they had no idea and will never know that they provided the highlight of my year.  

Okay, now to the actual post:  

Hello! I am a living human person who values laughter, empathy, nature, hazelnut coffee, the sound of ping-pong being played in an adjoining room, great literature, nostalgia, things that smell really good, dim lighting, live music, new notebooks, acoustic guitars, classic movies, and above all kindness‚Äîand the kindest thing I can think to do for myself (and hopefully for you) is to offer my company, my presence, my friendship here.  

This new year I am all about trying new things. I am excited to report that I have just watched my first anime (Weathering with You); I adored it and subsequently became, oh yes, a Mega Fan on Crunchyroll. I'm listening only to music that is new to me, so please feel free to share your stellar recommendations. I'm looking for a new job and new friends and I'd love it if you'd be the first (friend, not job). We can connect in any way you'd prefer: letters, emails, DMs, texts, or any combination of the above.

Has anyone else experienced this. I feel like my food/coffee intake is not that much higher but damn I can‚Äôt even lay down at night due to the heartburn. 

PS. 
if anyone has anymore ideas for this stage of the withdrawal Leme know. Creeped this sub and got some helpful info already earlier today. I was, however, thinking I was through the worst of it and it was almost over. According to some of these posts, that will not be the case.

It's my genuine wish that, in the distant future, we'll look back together and remember today as the start of a great and true friendship.  

First, my struggle. You can skip this part. Really. Consider it a preface by a curmudgeonly academic who talks to himself about Walt Whitman and eats many Werther's Originals.  

2024 was an adventure that went nowhere, a tearful year that began with my move to a new city in a new state (literally on New Year's Day) and concluded before I could achieve my top goal: to make a new friend. That's right, I failed to make any friends for an entire year (and counting). Working long hours from home for a company on the opposite coast probably wasn't the best idea; and although I attended movie meetups, joined an astronomy club, hung out on live jazz nights, showed up at my local nature center for group hikes, volunteered for a literacy program, and got a few pretty snazzy haircuts along the way, it just wouldn't, didn't, happen.  

Now maybe you're asking yourself, ""What's wrong with this guy?"" And to that I smile and say, You're not alone; I've been asking myself the same question.  

As someone who loves writing, reading, and all things peaceful, my tendency toward solitude became a real problem for the first time in my life last year. I learned: Without friendship there is no solitude. And when I resolved to ditch the books and pens and reach out for connection, I was surprised to find: silence. By the time I left Thanksgiving cards for my neighbors in the adjacent apartments letting them know how grateful I am to have them nearby, my health was suffering. And when, one day at a time, my neighbors didn't reply, still haven't replied, I have felt loneliness as an actual physical pain. In recent weeks I've taken to buying dinner for the person or people behind me in line at Chipotle just to feel included the world, to enjoy some tiny human connection and kindness. When I did this on my birthday, the woman and her daughter each hugged me; they had no idea and will never know that they provided the highlight of my year.  

Okay, now to the actual post:  

Hello! I am a living human person who values laughter, empathy, nature, hazelnut coffee, the sound of ping-pong being played in an adjoining room, great literature, nostalgia, things that smell really good, dim lighting, live music, new notebooks, acoustic guitars, classic movies, and above all kindness‚Äîand the kindest thing I can think to do for myself (and hopefully for you) is to offer my company, my presence, my friendship here.  

This new year I am all about trying new things. I am excited to report that I have just watched my first anime (Weathering with You); I adored it and subsequently became, oh yes, a Mega Fan on Crunchyroll. I'm listening only to music that is new to me, so please feel free to share your stellar recommendations. I'm looking for a new job and new friends and I'd love it if you'd be the first (friend, not job).

For the past year since I've lived in a nice condo. There's about 4 or 5 concierges in shifts, and all of them are really nice except for one.

Every time me or my brother goes to see him, he looks like he just smelled a fart. Initially, we just told him our unit number so he could get our packages for us (that's how the system works). We didn't think much of it, assuming that he's just not a social person. Then, we saw him acting all friendly with other people, chatting with them happily and everything. Still didn't think much of it, we're not very social either, so maybe we just didn't make that initial connection.

But then it got to the point where he saw us come out of the elevator and instantly jumped up to get our packages. He also had a strange habit of leaving it in an oddly inconvenient spot on his desk (inconvenient for both him and us) instead of just handing the package to us. He stopped speaking at all to us, not even responding to a ""Thank you"", and avoiding eye contact. The latest development is that he keeps our packages on the oddly inconvenient spot (after seeing us on the camera in the elevator??? I don't know how), and pointing at it while staring at his screen as we approach so that he doesn't need to interact with us at all.

Every time I see him, he stares at me like I spat into his coffee. I'm not sure if I'm overreacting, wtf is up with this dude? I cannot recall anything I or my brother could have done to offend him. He also opens the door (remotely) for everyone except for us.

I haven't really seen his attitude towards other brown folks, I have only seen this friendliness towards white people and black people. He is a Latino gentleman.

1i35u4z,https://www.reddit.com/r/StructuralEngineerUSA/comments/1i35u4z/how_i_passed_the_pe_civil_structural_exam_on_my/,How I Passed the PE Civil Structural Exam on My First Attempt: Tips and Study Strategies,"Hi there,

I passed the PE Civil Structural Exam yesterday (Wednesday). I had the exam last Thursday and prepared for almost three months. I booked the exam in September and started preparing on September 26. I didn‚Äôt study every day, but in the beginning, I studied for about three hours per day until I finished the on-demand School of PE videos (you can buy in 50%discount if you use university email). I made my own notes for studying, although I also printed all the handouts and workshop problems they provided.

Once I completed the videos and the workshop problems (around 200 problems), I felt quite happy with the content they provided. I always felt like the material was more than enough, even though the syllabus provided by NCEES is not very detailed on a micro level. After finishing the videos, I started practicing the problems on their website, which totaled around 155. During this time, I reviewed a lot of the material I had studied through the School of PE videos and printed slides.

I finished all of these by the end of November but still felt like I hadn‚Äôt practiced enough problems, so I decided to study another book:¬†*Christine A. Subasic - Six-Minute Solutions for Civil PE Exam Structural Problems (2014, Professional Publications, Inc.)*. For this book, I wrote out each question and solved all the solutions myself. Although the book isn‚Äôt updated to the current code, about 4-5 questions needed revision according to the latest codes mentioned in the NCEES syllabus. While solving the problems, I found some of them to be really long and a bit different from what might be asked in the exam. However, I completed every question in the book to build confidence. By doing this, I could remember many of the questions and answers.

After finishing that book, I practiced the NCEES Practice Book, which cost around $35-$40. While working through this book, I thought that if the exam was similar, I could finish it within the time limit. I also felt that the first half of the exam would be relatively easy since the practice book problems were straightforward and could often be solved in just 3-4 steps if you had a good foundation.

In the first week of January, from January 2 to January 8, I revised everything I had studied, including using flashcards from the School of PE website. These were very helpful for reviewing the basics. During this time, I didn‚Äôt study every day consistently because I had to work on my research and experiments simultaneously as a graduate student. However, whenever I had time, I studied for 1-2 hours per day.

The night before the exam, I couldn‚Äôt sleep. I knew I needed to be at the exam center by 8:00 a.m., but I couldn‚Äôt sleep until about 4:00 a.m. I slept for only about 2-2.5 hours. I felt excited but also tired and a little out of it. I arrived at the exam center at 7:25 a.m., and the exam started at around 7:40 a.m. I was the first to check in and enter the exam hall. I had a small coffee before the exam and didn‚Äôt eat anything, as I didn‚Äôt want to risk feeling uncomfortable during the test.

For the first part of the exam, I had 38 questions to solve in 4 hours. I aimed to finish early to save time for the second part, which I expected to have more design and code-related questions. I completed the first part in 2 hours and 50 minutes and flagged four questions. I flagged them not because I had no idea how to solve them, but because I wasn‚Äôt entirely confident in my answers. Overall, I didn‚Äôt encounter any questions I didn‚Äôt recognize. After finishing the first part, I took a break, refreshed myself, and stayed motivated for the second part.

During the break, I stayed calm and re-entered the exam room 15 minutes before the break ended. I had only half a glass of water. The second part of the exam started as expected, with a few tricky questions at the beginning. I flagged and skipped them initially to avoid wasting time. I solved all the other questions first and then revisited the flagged ones. By the end, I had about 10-11 flagged questions and 1 hour and 45 minutes left to address them. Of those, I recall two questions that I knew how to solve but couldn‚Äôt focus on due to lack of sleep, and one question that was either tricky or deceptively simple. Overall, I roughly estimate I made three mistakes in the first part and about 5-6 mistakes in the second part. Even with this worst-case scenario, I calculated that I would still score around 85% (or answer more than 70 questions correctly).

Yesterday, at 8:47 a.m., I received my results and learned that I had passed the exam. Thank God!

An honest suggestion from my experience: I‚Äôve seen many comments and reviews online saying the School of PE is not good, but I personally found their content more than sufficient. Adding a supplemental book for extra practice and confidence can also be helpful.

Good luck to everyone preparing for the exam! Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need advice.

Cheers!

Note: This was my first attempt. If you‚Äôd like to know about specific topics or types of questions asked in the exam, feel free to comment. I‚Äôm happy to help!

I love music in almost every shape and form! I play a handful of instruments and right now my goal is to get a few covers out on YouTube! I‚Äôm always looking for new music so pleaseeeeee send me your favorite tunes! 9 times out of 10 it‚Äôll become my new favorite music and we can obsess over artists together!

Good food is seasoned food and I‚Äôm all about good food! Some heavy hitters are kbbq, ramen, seafood, tacos of all shapes & sizes, vegan dishes, the list goes on honestly!
I love making food and drinks for people. My dream is to have ramen bar of sorts and give people a multi course meal with various mixed drinks included. I used to be a barista so coffee drinks are included for the brunch version of this!

According to one of my best friends: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a  golden retriever to put it simply. Very energetic for the ones he loves. At times very dopey and spacey. He‚Äôll get distracted by a squirrel but still knows exactly everything I said surprisingly.‚Äù

This is very true I‚Äôm definitely always listening but I‚Äôm also always living in the moment! I just love observing. I love noticing things and learning how the world works. Some people say ‚Äúit‚Äôs not that deep man‚Äù and I hate that phrase. That‚Äôs one way to stop someone from living/experiencing life.

It was supposed to be a simple 20 minute procedure and I was supposed to be able to walk into work today. Instead it was over an hour and there were more issues than expected when he did the scope. So I ended up with a huge dressing, a boot for at least two weeks, crutches, and a lot of pain. I‚Äôm so depressed about it. I took the rest of the week off of work and will go back on Tuesday. Hopefully I‚Äôll be able to get up the stairs okay by then. Unfortunately the closest restroom to my office is downstairs and the other one is all the way on the other side of the building, so that might be a struggle. I don‚Äôt know exactly what caused the surgery to be extended, because I wasn‚Äôt able to talk to the doctor. I‚Äôll find out at my follow up. 

I did opt for spinal anesthesia with sedation and numbing of the limb. It was bizarre. They said I wouldn‚Äôt remember anything, but I remember a lot. I remember the anesthesiologist telling me when the hardware was out. I remember the doctor saying that the scope was going to be a lot more extensive than planned. I remember the doctor and others talking about doing a coffee order from a local coffee shop (would it be weird or funny if I gave him a gift card to that coffee shop?). I remember feeling stuff happening and the anesthesiologist reassuring me that if I wasn‚Äôt feeling pain it was okay that I was feeling movement. I definitely don‚Äôt remember the whole thing, but it‚Äôs wild to me what I do remember.

Intensity has to exist from the get-go. No room to breathe. Dopamine and adrenaline before anything else, before complexity, before comfort or longevity. Part of me longs for something gentle and slow. Something unremarkable in every way except for my own dedicated preoccupation with watering and tending to it. 

I am not preaching, I myself am intense and immediate. I'm not a stand out in my generation, in fact I epitomize it. I am way to addicted to youtube. I do things to balance it out. I enjoy classical literature and journaling, I spend most of my time alone listening to music and untangling the same things humans have wrestled with for centuries. I have a few degrees and am entering the legal sector midway through this year. I don't have any dreams of fame and fortune. I just want to write and read for my own enjoyment until I can't anymore. I am unremarkable in every sense, I'm sure you could find twenty of me in the corner of every local coffee shop. But I will be gentle and patient with you. I will celebrate the things other people find boring. I'll laugh at your adventures and share my own. 

If this sounds appealing, send me a message telling me about a moment you felt truly like yourself.

So we are here for our own sake (we want to understand, often get over the trauma and come to terms with the loss of so many precious and irretrievable years). However, we are also here for another reason - we need to reach people who are already in the cult and those who are thinking about joining it. The more people we warn, the less suffering will flow down this river..

  
That's why I don't understand one thing and it's hard for me to come to terms with it. There is a person who devotes a lot of her private time to running this forum.

A hopeless romantic, who is livin' for the hope of it all
Should I regret, or let curses steal my sleep,
For daring to ask you for hot coffee in coast's sweltering heat?

But you-oh, you looked like sunshine, a radiant glow,
Half an hour together, yet it stretched like eternity's flow.
Was it just my mind, spinning tales too bold?
For you're the only one I've ever asked to hold.

Ego whispers, questioning if it's all just a guise,
Or perhaps it's my heart longing to see behind your eyes.
Do I want to know you? The answer rings true
For in that fleeting moment, I think I found my clue.

Still, I recall the words I dared to say,
""Under the hot sun, sipping hot coffee, with a hot guy .""
Did it make you smile or cause your eyes to roll?
That moment replays, gripping my soul.

I relive it as if my life depends on the scene,
Caught in this whirlwind, feeling like sweet sixteen.
I say I can move on with ease, it's just a whim,
What a bummer to leave this earth without knowing you

After our talk, I went about my day,
But your silence turned my skies to gray.
This little heart, setting ego aside,
Sent a message, asking for your side.

But you, unbothered, left me on hold,
While you vibed to Indian Hip hop songs, bold.
Then came Monday, your words so few,
They painted my day in a somber blue.

It stung, it hurt-a truth too raw,
What a bummer to leave without knowing it all.
Now, I sit, listening to songs of a Blonde American,
Hoping for the best, dreaming of when.

I'll never dare to ask to dance with a devil,
For love's a gamble, a dangerous level.
Yet no matter where this story ended,
You'll remain the first-planted like a seed.
The first I dared to ask for a chance.

They say artists are crazy-I can't deny,
For I dreamed to paint you, my muse, my sky.
With my best colors, I set out to start,
But black, white, and the deepest blue filled my art.

How could I paint sunshine like you,
When my colors are cursed, my canvas askew?
I couldn't afford the hues you deserve,
So I turned you into words, my soul to preserve.

I ask myself, what made you so rare?
No other man quoted Gita in text,
With words so profound, leaving my heart perplexed.

Perhaps it's time for my soul to align,
To seek the divine in this chaotic design.

Now, all I do is move with time,
Hoping for the best, though you're my favorite crime.
A moment of daring, a heart I unchained,
A sin I'd commit, again and again.

You're the echo that lingers, the muse I never regret,
A favourite crime that felt worth to commit
The sunshine I found, but couldn't hold.
Though I move forward, your shadow remains,
Etched in my soul, Good bye my Beloved.

I open my inbox like a door to hope,
Waiting for the text you‚Äôll never send.
I read those unsent words in my mind,
Echoes of feelings left behind.

You shone like Sirius, piercing my night sky,
A fleeting brightness I couldn‚Äôt deny.
Now unease wraps me, words trapped within
You said you'd leave this city by summer's end.

I hope to forget you by then,
But my heart defies my wiser plans.
I ignore every glance, every voice,
Craving only yours am I foolish, or wise?

How can I waste my¬† whole days
For thirty minutes of fleeting gaze?
You spoke fewer than ten words,
Yet I couldn‚Äôt read the signs, blind and absurd.

I sit, I wait, like a shadow cast,
Bound to a memory that won‚Äôt outlast.
The coffee shop sits untouched by me,
Since you said you didn‚Äôt want me to be.

There are countless stars, but you shine the brightest,
No moon can replace you, my beloved Sirius 
how can I feel so hopeless?
I think of you endlessly yet you don‚Äôt even know I exist.

Deluded, I stand like a statue with hope ,
pray not to crumble with time .

1i35jou,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1i35jou/mechs_and_magic_chapter_one_now_youre_thinking/,Mechs and Magic: Chapter One - Now You're Thinking With Portals,"‚ÄúReactor online,‚Äù the digitized voice of my on-board artificial intelligence rang through the speakers of the cockpit. It wasn‚Äôt a true AI, more like a highly specialized combat assistant. I watched the screen on the console, diagnostics flashing on its surface in a blaze of speed. If there were any problems, the screen would flash red and display the relevant text. I reached down and toggled the comm switch next to the screen, connecting to the mission channel. The screen on the console flashed over to a real-time video display of Commander Jacobs, the ship‚Äôs executive officer, for the mission briefing.



‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have a lot of time,‚Äù he began, his voice a smooth baritone. ‚ÄúScans have found an installation on a small, rocky moon, in a system that is listed as uninhabited. We jumped to the system nearly sixteen hours ago and have been scanning from roughly a light-hour away.‚Äù I nodded along as I completed my start up sequence, diagnostics showing every system was operational, though there were two new systems added to my mech that I didn‚Äôt have before.



My mech was a heavy weapons platform, it‚Äôs squat body loaded to the gills with weapons. Other than the actual artillery mech, I piloted the mech with the most ordinance on the entire ship. My left arm was a thirty millimeter autocannon loaded up with nearly six thousand rounds housed in an armored compartment where a shoulder would normally be. My right arm was a standard arm, complete with a ‚Äògripping apparatus‚Äô or hand as it‚Äôs normally called. Attached to the underside of the forearm was a short barrel, one hundred and fifty-five millimeter cannon loaded with fifteen rounds of high explosive shells. Sitting atop the mech‚Äôs shoulders, to either side of the unit‚Äôs head, was a retractable three pack of armor penetrating missiles.



Commander Jacob‚Äôs voice brought me back to reality. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve loaded the long range scans of the facility into your mechs. There are three anti-ship cannons located in a triangle around the facility. The back wall of the facility is a cliff face and the best we can tell is that they‚Äôre digging into the mountain.‚Äù I looked at the scans that were provided. The facility was a large building, easily large enough to serve as a hanger for several ground based mech squads. The cannons were spaced out far enough that they couldn‚Äôt all be destroyed in a single orbital strike.



‚ÄúSir,‚Äù I began, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs so important about this place? Normally we‚Äôd either ignore it or just glass it from orbit.‚Äù I watched as the Commander frowned. Had he already gone over this while I was daydreaming about my mech? I could already imagine the rest of my squad laughing in their mechs.



‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know, Corporal. The fact that the facility matches the typical layout of The Conglomerate‚Äôs outpost is the main concern. This system is far from their own territory, deep behind our own borders. Your squad is part of the initial pacification force. You‚Äôll be taking out those cannons and any smaller point defense systems to allow our ground forces to drop in.‚Äù The Commander took a sip from a white coffee mug, grimacing as he swallowed. There was no telling how old that coffee was. I commiserated with him, cold coffee was terrible.



‚ÄúBecause of the cannons, we cannot get in close enough for a standard combat drop. Your squad will have to jump in.‚Äù My stomach immediately dropped. A combat jump was a short range light jump, effectively a teleport from old Earth science fiction. They were dangerous with nearly a ten percent failure rate. A jump failure resulted in your atoms being spread across the entire jump corridor. If the Commander noticed the slightly terrified looks on any of our faces, he didn‚Äôt comment and continued with his briefing.



‚ÄúOnce you hit the ground, you should have about fifteen seconds to hit the cannons before they become active. While we don‚Äôt think they can effectively target your mechs, as small as they are compared to ships, it‚Äôll be in your best interest to neutralize them quickly. Once that is done, you are to move on to any secondary defenses, prioritizing any communications gear you see. Once the defenses and comms have been destroyed, the ground teams will drop in via conventional drop ships and begin sweeping the area.‚Äù Of course the ground pounders would get the all-expenses paid, luxury cruise down to the surface.



‚ÄúYou‚Äôll note that your mechs have two new systems added on. These systems are still experimental but the labrats have decided they need actual field data on these systems.‚Äù He tapped on a remote and the screen on my console changed from displaying the Commander‚Äôs face to a pair of schematics. The first schematic enlarged itself, taking up the whole screen.



‚ÄúThis first one was added to your mech‚Äôs chest, slightly to the right of the cockpit. It consists of three projectors. When activated, the projectors will project, for lack of a better word, a light-based shield that, in theory, will stop most incoming projectiles.‚Äù



My jaw hung open as I registered the Commander's words. I couldn‚Äôt stop myself from speaking, interrupting him and drawing his ire. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got fuckin‚Äô force fields?‚Äù If looks could kill, the Commander would have incinerated me on the spot, through the screen.¬†



‚ÄúThe technical term is a ‚Äòhard-light shield‚Äô,‚Äù he sighed. ‚ÄúThe power draw is significant. Your reactors won‚Äôt be able to keep the shields up for long periods of time. The suggestion is to use it in emergencies. The second system has been added to your mech‚Äôs right arm, another hard-light system. It is a pair of projectors mounted on the topside of your arm, at the wrist. When activated, it‚Äôll form what amounts to a push dagger. It‚Äôll extend nearly three meters from your wrist. The tests have shown the dagger capable of cutting through our ship armor with relative ease. It‚Äôs a lighter power draw than the shield, but it still draws power heavily. It‚Äôs a last resort weapon.‚Äù



I sat back in my seat, digesting what he told us. We had actual force fields and a fucking lightsaber dagger thing. This was awesome.



‚ÄúSir,‚Äù the voice of Private Taylor cut in. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a quick question, if you don‚Äôt mind.‚Äù The Commander nodded, waiting for Taylor‚Äôs question. When he spoke, I found myself wanting to strangle the little bastard. ‚ÄúHow the fuck is light hard?‚Äù¬†

  
  


\~\~\*\~\~\*\~\~\*\~\~\*\~\~\*\~\~\*\~\~



A countdown appeared in the right corner of my displays. The angry red numbers began rolling backwards from one hundred and twenty. I took a deep breath and tightened my hands around the controls. I hated jumps. I‚Äôd much rather be fired out of the drop tubes, a pair of thrusters quick-mounted to the legs of my mech to soften the inevitable landing. Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt get to make those decisions. My stomach roiled as the numbers dipped below sixty. ‚ÄúSixty seconds,‚Äù I called out over the squad comm. As the numbers hit ten, I felt the static build up of the jump as it prepared to kill us, I mean jump us to the surface. It always unnerved me, being able to feel the build up of the energy. According to the scientists and doctors, it was all psychosomatic and that no one could feel the energy of the jump. The number finally hit zero and I felt the energy lance out from around us, vertigo rearing its ugly head.



One moment we were in the hangar bay of the ESN Cambridge and the next we were on the surface of a barren, rocky moon. Everything was dull brown with little variation in color. As soon as the jump finished, I swung my mech to the left, the targeting reticle for my cannon immediately centering over the magazine compartment of the anti-ship cannon. Without thinking about it, I pulled the trigger on the controls and watched in satisfaction as my cannon belched a round from the barrel. The shell punched through metal protecting the magazine and the entire structure exploded, flaming debris flying through air. Just moments after my target ceased to exist, I heard similar explosions, the squad taking care of the rest of the cannons.¬†



The squad all slowly scanned the area, looking for any other defenses. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see anything else, do any of you?‚Äù I spoke into the squad comm. I got three negative responses. ‚ÄúSpread out and make another sweep. I wanna be sure before we bring in the troops.‚Äù It took an extra five minutes of searching and scanning, but we didn‚Äôt find anything else. I keyed up the command channel, knowing that the Commander would be listening, waiting for my report. ‚ÄúFacility defenses neutralized, no communications equipment found.‚Äù The reply was almost immediate, a woman‚Äôs voice responding. ‚ÄúGround teams inbound, ten minutes.‚Äù



Waiting for the ground troops was always the worst. While we had taken out the defenses, the Conglomerate loved their ambushes. They‚Äôd let you come in, do your damage, and when you were waiting on the troops, they‚Äôd appear from nowhere and ruin your day. Their mechs were smaller and faster, but they lacked the armor to go toe to toe in a fight. Whatever they lacked in armor, they made up for with firepower. Their weapons were exceptionally dangerous on a good day.



‚ÄúKeep alert, ground forces are inbound, ten minutes,‚Äù I spoke over the squad comm. ‚ÄúNo telling what‚Äôs going on here or what could be waiting for us.‚Äù As we waited, I started to inspect the facility. The building I originally thought could be a hangar of some kind turned out to be four pillars holding up a large roof. It was pressed up against the cliff face behind it, a large metal door centered between the two rear pillars. The door was large enough for a mech to walk through with nearly six meters of clearance.



‚ÄúWhat do you think is behind that door?‚Äù Private Durand asked, his voice steady and low. ‚ÄúWith any luck,‚Äù Taylor began, ‚Äúa couple of good looking women, cold beer, and hot steaks.‚Äù I rolled my eyes as the rest of the squad chuckled over the comms. An alert on my display screen popped up, a tracking reticle over a pair of dropships coming in low. ‚ÄúLooks like the ground pounders are almost here.‚Äù



It only took a few seconds to disgorge the ground troops from their ships. The dropships screamed back into the sky, putting distance between them and the facility. They‚Äôd be close enough for an extraction if things got really hot. I watched as the infantry fanned out, sweeping into the few outlying buildings that were like some kind of administrative offices.¬†



‚ÄúCorporal Summers,‚Äù a voice called out on the command comm, bringing my attention down to the man standing closest to my mech. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Lieutenant Knight. I‚Äôm going to have a squad breaching that door in two minutes. I want your men ready in case there‚Äôs any nasty surprises in there.‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúAcknowledged,‚Äù I replied, moving my mech into position, facing the door. The rest of my squad fell in without having to be ordered. I switched my fire selector over to my autocannon and waited, watching the men on the ground take up their own positions. A pair of men jogged over to the large, metal door set into the rock face. As I inspected the door, I noticed that it was designed to slide to the side on a set of metal tracks.¬†



‚ÄúFire in the hole,‚Äù Knight said over the comms. The door exploded, debris flying everywhere. The explosion kicked up a lot of dust, obscuring the entrance. The men on the ground poured in, weapons at the ready. I tensed, waiting for gunfire, but none came. ‚ÄúLieutenant,‚Äù another voice called out on the comms. ‚ÄúI think you need to come see this.‚Äù



Another few minutes of tense silence passed. From the entrance that was blown open, a faint blue light seemed to seep out. ‚ÄúCorporal,‚Äù Knight‚Äôs voice crackled over the comms, surprising me and sending my heartbeat spiraling out of control. ‚ÄúI need your mech in here to scan and record this.‚Äù I slowly eased my mech forward, my muscles tense with unease.



Inside the door was a large cavern, the center dominated by a dais that appeared to be carved from the stone that made up the floor of the cavern. The platform was large, big enough for a mech to stand on and have plenty of room to move without stepping off of it. Along the bottom of the dais, blue light pulsed inside some kind of carved symbols. My mouth was dry, a very intense feeling of unease settling into my stomach. ‚ÄúWhat am I looking at?‚Äù I asked on the comms, not expecting an answer.



Everyone just seemed to stand around, staring at the dais in confusion. I couldn‚Äôt see any kind of power source for the strange symbols that glowed. ‚ÄúIs it just me or are those symbols pulsing?‚Äù the voice from earlier called out. He was right. The eerie blue glow of the symbols pulsed in some form of mockery of a heartbeat. The pulsing continued, growing in speed until each pulse seemed indistinguishable from the next. I felt a tug at the edge of my senses, like a hypnic jerk, and the light in the symbols died.



‚ÄúWhat the fuck?‚Äù I heard Lieutenant Knight ask.



I was wholly unprepared for the surge of blue light that filled the cavern and a loud ripping sound accompanied the light. When my eyes stopped feeling as if they were dipped in a pot of boiling water, I saw a large, blue circle of energy floating slightly above the dais. It was at least as tall as my mech. It was the same shade of blue as the light that pulsed from the symbols. I watched as the men on the ground took up positions, some hiding behind bits of rock while others deployed metal barriers to take cover behind.



The glowing energy hung in the sky, as if it had every right to be there. I slowly moved my mech forward, staring into the energy. As I got closer, I saw that there were jagged lines of white energy writhing through the blue, all coming together at a point in the center of the blue energy. It was mesmerizing to look at. Then, it pulsed once and flashed brightly, stinging my eyes again. I reflexively turned my head away, eyes closing to protect me from the agony. When they opened again, there was something standing on the dais in front of the blue energy.



It was large, maybe a meter or two taller than my mech. It looked like a fairytale knight, its armor a bright blue. Where the joints of the armor met, instead of padding or chainmail, the same blue energy shone. The knight was human shaped with two arms and two legs. In one of the hands, it held the largest sword I had ever seen. The world seemed to be standing still as we all took stock of what had happened. Then the thing moved.



One moment it was standing completely still in front of me, as if it were a statue. The next moment, it had crashed into me and had carried my mech back out of the cavern. My mech landed on its back, skidding away. It was fast, faster than anything that size had a right to be. My squad hadn‚Äôt even reacted when he reached Taylor, the large sword plunging through his mech right where the cockpit was. I doubt Taylor even had time to scream.



It was hard, getting a mech back on its feet, but it was something we trained for. There were always some kind of tripping hazard or an explosion that would take you off your feet. I couldn‚Äôt waste any time, I had to get back in the fight before that thing could kill anyone else. With a heave of the controls, I managed to get my mech‚Äôs feet back under me. I spun around, looking for the knight, anger boiling in my veins. I found him as his sword sliced Benson‚Äôs mech from shoulder to hip, completely bisecting it through the cockpit.



The knight was in Durand‚Äôs reach before the two halves of Benson‚Äôs mech hit the ground. There was no way this thing could be that fast. The targeting reticle of my mech seemed to move too slow, struggling to keep up with the knight. I watched as Durand‚Äôs autocannon started to spin up, preparing to send a stream of death at the knight. My horror grew as the knight‚Äôs sword punched through Durand‚Äôs cockpit. I felt sick to my stomach.



The knight placed a foot on Durand‚Äôs mech and pushed it off his blade. The knight turned towards me, sword in front of him, and waited. The thing was taunting me. It was faster than I was and we both knew it, but it seemed like the sword was its only weapon. We were about forty meters apart. No matter how quick this thing was, it wasn‚Äôt quicker than my autocannon. I squeezed the trigger.



I watched with grim satisfaction as the thirty millimeter rounds lanced out, impacting on the knight‚Äôs right side. I drug the targeting reticle to the left, intending to rake the rounds across its chest. Before a dozen rounds had even impacted, a translucent blue barrier appeared, the same symbols from the dais in the cavern danced around the edges, glowing white. The rounds from my autocannon impacted on the barrier and were stopped, each impact sending white ripples through the barrier. I let off the trigger and the autocannon stopped. The knight seemed to be holding his hand up, as if the barrier were a shield. Behind that barrier of light, I could see the damage to its armor. Each round had passed through the armor, the holes ragged and the blue energy leaked out as if it were blood.



It was pure luck that I jerked back on the controls as soon as I saw the knight move. He closed the distance between us in the blink of an eye, his sword slicing through the mech‚Äôs left arm. Warning lights danced across my displays, the autocannon now a useless hunk of metal incapable of doing anything.¬†



I twitched the controls to my right, turning the mech as I tried to avoid the follow up slash from the knight. The downward stroke shaved armor off of the mech‚Äôs left leg as I was too slow to avoid the blow completely. Reacting on instinct, I shoved the mech‚Äôs right arm towards the knight, the barrel of my cannon slamming into the knight's shoulder. I toggled my fire selector to the cannon and squeezed the trigger.¬†



The blast from the shell knocked the knight backwards, putting some distance between us. Smoke and dust swirled around us, obscuring the knight from my vision. It didn‚Äôt take but a moment for the knight to step from the dust, its left arm dangling uselessly as blue energy seemed to pour out of the hole in it. I guess the knight was right handed as he lifted his sword and pointed it at me. He moved forward, this time slower than he had been but still incredibly fast. His sword flashed out, slicing down the barrel of my cannon, splitting it into two halves, and continuing down into the firing mechanism. It would be useless. His shoulder slammed into my mech, knocking me backwards a few steps. My muscles were tense and my hands were shaking. I was faring better than my squad had, but this thing was taking me apart. It was toying with me.



I pressed the weapon release for my cannon, triggering the explosive bolts that held the weapon to my mech‚Äôs arm. Four small explosions destroyed the bolts and it dropped to the ground. It would be more useful as a club than a cannon now. The knight watched me, studying my movements. I grinned savagely, as it would consider me to be unarmed now. It had destroyed both of my weapons.



I seem to have forgotten that it was ungodly fast. I thumbed the selector for the force field that had been installed before the mission. The barrier thrummed into existence, shimmering an unsettling translucent green. The knight‚Äôs sword seemed to bounce off of it, surprising both of us. Before I could let the barrier dissipate to save energy, the knight swung his sword again, testing the barrier. I jerked the controls back, trying to put some room between us but the knight pressed in on me hard.



I managed to dodge a swing, surprising myself. I immediately released the barrier and hit the trigger for my hard-light dagger. It snapped into existence off of my wrist and I plunged my mech‚Äôs arm forward with as much force and speed as the mech could muster. The knight managed to pull its head away from the dagger, though the dagger scored a deep, jagged cut across the helmet. With a quickness that shouldn‚Äôt have surprised me, but did, the knight managed to get his sword up and slice through my mech‚Äôs arm, severing it at the elbow.



‚ÄúFuck,‚Äù I yelled. The knight spun, his sword going low as it sliced through the right leg of my mech. As it turns out, a mech needs two legs to keep upright. My mech toppled over, landing face down on the rocky ground. I tensed, waiting for the inevitable of a giant fucking sword to get shoved through my cockpit. I was surprised when I felt my mech being jerked over on its back, the knight looming over my mech. I was not surprised when the knight shoved his sword through what would be the waist on my mech.



The knight drug his sword sideways, severing my mech‚Äôs remaining leg from the torso. It let go of its sword, still stabbed into the ground where it sliced my mech in two. It reached out with its good arm and seized the remains of the right arm, lifting the mech up. Warning lights and klaxons rang out through my cockpit, telling me things I could already guess at.



It studied the damage it had wrought to my mech. I didn‚Äôt want to die here and desperately considered all my options. I had no weapons. Wait, that wasn‚Äôt right. I grinned as I formed a plan. I tapped the loudspeaker option on my console, broadcasting my voice to the knight. I had no idea if it would understand the words, but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôd understand the tone.



‚ÄúFuck you,‚Äù I said, thumbing the weapons selector over to my shoulder missles. I hoped my battered and dying mech had enough juice left in it for what I had planned. I gripped the controls tight with one hand while my other hand hovered over another button. I had to get this timed just right as I didn‚Äôt know if the force field would let anything pass through it on my side.



I squeezed the trigger and sent six missiles blasting into the knight, my hand slamming down on the force field button half a heartbeat after squeezing the trigger. The missiles exploded as they hit the knight, the blast tearing the remains of my mech‚Äôs arm from the body and throwing us apart. The knight was swallowed in a fireball and I watched as I saw the overly large blue armored body parts flying in different directions. Then, the back of my head was introduced to a piece of metal that had caved in when my mech hit the ground and I knew nothing more.

There were quite a few people around who proudly wore their favorite David Lynch-related shirts. You could hear people talking about films like Inland Empire and the others that he made.

Although it was also business as usual at this location, you could see the passionate fans were there to honor him.

IMDb Summary: Artist and filmmaker David Lynch discusses his early life and the events that shaped his outlook on art and the creative process.

Starring David Lynch and Lula Lynch, his cutie patootie daughter. 

I remember when [Twin Peaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Peaks?wprov=sfti1#) came out. I was 14, headed to 15, and in high school. A few of my friends liked it too, especially my friends Sallie and Wendy. They were significantly cooler than I was, especially Sallie. While I was not sure that I understood all of what was happening, what I did know was that I loved Agent Dale Cooper, his sense of order, his quirky mannerisms, and his love for a good piece of pie and cup of black coffee. 

Fast-forward a few years and I am in a relationship with Zedd.  I try to convince him that *Twin Peaks* is a great series, that [Blue Velvet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Velvet_(film)?wprov=sfti1#) is an awesome film, and that David Lynch is a hell of an artist. 

But I know, he‚Äôs not for everyone. His films and TV are non-linear. The meaning of something, whether an ear in a field, a red lampshade, or a ring, is often something else entirely. They can also be violent and sexual in nature. Gritty and breathtaking. 

After some time, Zedd got on board with Lynch and then we watched The Art Life. Zedd tells me that The Art Life elevated Lynch - for him - from interesting dude to full blown respected artist. Understanding, regardless of which medium you connect with him on (painting, video art, television, music, movies) - he‚Äôs always an artist first - he lives The Art Life. He helped influence Zedd to ‚Äúfind himself‚Äù in the writing - something that directly influenced 500 Movies. Whether he‚Äôs here or not, The Art Life Lives On.

Well, that‚Äôs pretty ***Movie On*** isn‚Äôt it? David Lynch, you will be missed.

Hey everyone, I (31M) have been married to my wife (29F) for a few years now. I consider myself a good husband who enjoys spending time with my wife‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs traveling, having coffee dates (which she loves), or just supporting her interests. I genuinely try to show excitement for the things she likes, even if they‚Äôre not always my top priority.

However, I've noticed a pattern that‚Äôs been bothering me lately. Whenever I plan something for myself, like spending 3-4 hours playing basketball with my friends, my wife completely shuts down. She stops talking to me, and it feels like she withdraws emotionally. This has happened multiple times now, and it‚Äôs starting to make me feel like I can‚Äôt have my own space or do things that make me happy without her getting upset.

I‚Äôm really confused because I‚Äôm just trying to balance my own personal interests with the time I spend with her. I don‚Äôt expect her to join me for basketball or anything like that, but I do expect some level of understanding that I need some personal time too.

Is it wrong for me to want a little bit of space to hang out with my friends, or is this something I‚Äôm just not understanding? Could this be a sign of something deeper, or am I just being naive or childish about it?",32,1737078381.0,AskMenAdvice,88,0.93,False

I've been stalking it for months, but when the winter sale began, it appeared to be perpetually out of stock.

I am a hairstylist of 7yrs. My salon is all booth rentals so we are all independent businesses sharing a space. I will refer to my fellow booth renters as ‚Äúcoworkers‚Äù even tho it‚Äôs not quite the same but it‚Äôs just the best simple description I have. And the ‚Äúcoworker‚Äù I had an incident with we will call her ‚ÄúJosie‚Äù 

So I was washing my client in the rinsing bowl and accidentally bumped the nob to turn on the sprayer and it spray a couple drops on my ‚Äúcoworkers‚Äù(Josie‚Äôs) clients pants and suede Birkenstocks. Like literally a few drops. For context I am not bougie at all, I have never owned a pair of Birks, I don‚Äôt have designer bags or cups, it‚Äôs not my class. Most of my ‚Äúcoworkers‚Äù do. So when this happened I at first was naive to how serious it was. Two of my ‚Äúcoworkers‚Äù are freaking out like ‚Äúoh my gawd water got on the Birks‚Ä¶.what do we do?!‚Ä¶ oh nooo. Like it was the end of the world reactions I‚Äôm not kidding.‚Äù And I‚Äôm thinking; ‚ÄòOmg does that little of water ruin Birks? Why would you wear them here, let alone in winter wet weather if that‚Äôs a thing? It can‚Äôt be right? It‚Äôs okay.‚Äô I make sure to apologies and her client seemed forgiving so I continue on with my client. I mean this happens all the time in our salon (bumping the water on accidentally) so I continue on after apologizing. Josie is panicking and takes a wet rag and wipes down her clients shoes saying ‚Äúlet‚Äôs just put water all over and see if it all dries the same color at least‚Äù. After I see my client out my coworker is also finished with her client so I go over to check in how the shoes are drying and once again apologize since it was such a big deal and see if there was any further expectations (since that was the STRONG vibe from my ‚Äúcoworker‚Äù Josie). Josie doesn‚Äôt give her client a chance to respond to me and says ‚Äúya, they are ruined‚Ä¶I‚Äôll talk to you later about it‚Äù and dismisses me. She then texts me that night saying her client wanted to be compensated for her pants and shoes but that she let the pants slide because they are old. (Like what? How do you wash your pants if you can‚Äôt get water on them? Ew. Sus.) So she immediately reimbursed her and wants me to pay her back for her paying her client. So now I have no other way to make amends besides paying or not paying. 
(I let my clients know it‚Äôs a risk that their clothes could get stains and recommend options accordingly. If they have such sensitive clothing on I drape their legs and feet too. I personally feel we are responsible for our own clients since we are all separate business and I would never hold my coworker accountable for an accident like that since it‚Äôs just the nature of the environment. Although I may be at fault for the accident, I don‚Äôt feel it‚Äôs my fault she didn‚Äôt warn her clients of this, also putting us other renters at risk of such situations.) 

Why are you wearing $165 shoes into a busy salon that can get ruined by water anyways??? And then if anyone gets a few drops of even water on them you expect them to just casually cough up $165 out of pocket? :( It was just an accident and it happens. I told her I can‚Äôt afford $165 out of pocket and they can try to go through my insurance since I don‚Äôt have $165 just casually (I don‚Äôt work full time right now due to personal reasons). I am so upset that it will be over water droplets tho :,( 
Am I in the wrong for feeling I do not have to personally pay for this accident, I really don‚Äôt even want to make an insurance claim either. I understand if it was at like Walmart or something and I spilled coffee on someone, but this is a place where you know you are coming into a higher risk environment for stains, this is my place of work. I have everything in place for my business and I still feel like there was nothing I could do about this besides insurance. 
I just feel you are responsible for your own clients and the environment they are in. It just kinda blows my mind that you wear shoes that can be ruined by water into a salon. 
I gave Josie my contact info to send to the client so I can make a claim with my insurance and she didn‚Äôt want to give it to her client and said she will ask the client if she wants to provide pictures. (Note ‚Äúif she wants to‚Äù) 
I personally don‚Äôt even want to go through my insurance unless she wants to make a claim herself. I think this is an outrageous expectation. That‚Äôs seriously walking on eggshells if you are afraid to get water on other stylists clients on accident and then have to cough up over $100, almost $200‚Ä¶ 
I also feel very uncomfortable that she wants me to pay but won‚Äôt let me work it out with the client myself. I do feel really bad that it happened but I just feel like I should stand up for myself and that this is not an acceptable reimbursement situation. Especially since it‚Äôs technically not even my business and we all know we are in a shared space by choice. And like I said, I just wouldn‚Äôt expect my coworker to pay in this situation either. Especially out of pocket.

I feel my coworker Josie got taken advantage of by her client and took the least confrontational route with her client and is expecting me to easily just cough up the money like it‚Äôs no big deal. But she didn‚Äôt even let me solve the issue myself which I feel very uncomfortable with. I personally feel it‚Äôs not right for me to pay and that I would be a push over if so. Is this even valid for an insurance claim?

Am I in the wrong for thinking this way? I don‚Äôt understand ‚Äúsocial moral rules‚Äù very well but am well intentioned and try my best to, so I am genuinely asking for advice, please be kind. 

Another question is, IF you do think I should pay, should I offer to pay half with Josie since she put water all over the shoes as well and since she didn‚Äôt warn her clients of the risks coming into the salon? ",1,1737078229.0,HairStylistTribe,0,1.0,False

Hey Reddit,

I wanted to share a story that really touched me and made me want to take action.

Lately, I‚Äôve started taking late-night walks, and around 1:20 AM tonight, I stopped at a coffee vending machine near our local meat market for a hot chocolate. That‚Äôs when I saw a homeless man I‚Äôve noticed around town for about a year now.

The first time I met him was when I was too young to buy cigarettes for myself. I asked him to buy some for me in exchange for a few euros, and he agreed. What surprised me, though, was that he used the leftover money to buy himself a bar of chocolate instead of alcohol or more cigarettes, as many might expect. It was the first time I‚Äôd seen a homeless man spend money on something so small and thoughtful for himself, and it stuck with me.

Afterward, I saw him hopping on some small trampolines outside a nearby science center, and my friends and I laughed at how pure and joyful it looked. We even started calling him the ""happy homeless man.""

Over the year, I‚Äôve seen him eating from dumpsters or buying cheap meals, and it‚Äôs clear he‚Äôs doing his best to survive without falling into the trap of alcohol or drugs. At the start of this year, during winter, my friends and I were at McDonald's when I saw him sitting there with a coffee. I decided to buy him a burger, fries, and some sauce, and his gratitude really stayed with me.

Fast forward to tonight. After seeing him again during my walk, I felt compelled to learn more about his story. I circled back and asked if he wanted to chat, and he kindly agreed. What he told me broke my heart.

He shared that his mother passed away from Parkinson‚Äôs disease, leaving him with significant debts. Despite government promises of financial help, he receives only small amounts of money‚Äîbarely enough to survive. He wants to find work and rebuild his life, but he struggles without a stable place to stay. The homeless shelters, he said, are overcrowded, and the conditions are so bad (locked doors, no ventilation, crammed sleeping spaces) that he prefers sleeping on park benches, even in the cold.

Throughout our conversation, he kept apologizing, as if he was being a burden, but I insisted on listening. I encouraged him, telling him I had hope for him because of the effort he‚Äôs putting in to stay clean and focused. When he spoke about wanting to repay me someday, it was clear how much he values dignity and kindness.

Now, I can‚Äôt stop thinking about how I can help him. I know I can‚Äôt solve everything, but I believe that even small contributions could make a big difference. I want to set up a GoFundMe or find other ways to collect donations for him. Even a dollar could help me buy him a meal, coffee, or eventually enough to afford a place to stay for a few days so he can start looking for work.

If anyone has advice on how to set this up or wants to contribute in any way, I‚Äôd be incredibly grateful. Let‚Äôs show him that people still care and that there‚Äôs hope for a fresh start.

Thanks for reading, and please let me know your thoughts or ideas!

Atomic Habits : must read especially for this program.  75H is a program designed to build sustainable habits with an all or nothing approach that gets it done basically as quick as possible.  Atomic Habits explains the science behind it. 

Extreme Ownership: 10/10 book on leadership.  I found this uniquely useful in the program as well.  I draw on many of these concepts day to day.

Can‚Äôt Hurt Me : wow. When your bitch voice is telling you to quit, read this and realize your life is probably pretty good in comparison. 

Never finished : Ok, Dave Goggins is a massochist.  Much respect to the guy and where he has come from but holy moly the dude takes it to a new level.  Get ready for a graphic ride.  You don‚Äôt want to meet this guy in a gym. 

The E Myth:  Fantastic book that I read from time to time on company building.  If you‚Äôve heard ‚Äúwork on the business, not in the business‚Äù it probably came from here. Always worth another read, although the format can be jarring to some. 

12 Rules : Check Goodreads if you want better reviews. The book had a ton of great ideas but I‚Äôll say it was dense.  Jordan Peterson writes like he speaks so be prepared to hear the book in his voice.  I read in the evening so it‚Äôs possible this might be better in the morning with a coffee. 

 Unreasonable Hospitality : Phenomenal book about delivering remarkable experiences to your customers. While it‚Äôs set in a restaurant, the applications are everywhere.   In my line of business we concentrate on ‚ÄúCX‚Äù or customer experience and this leveled us up. Absolute recommendation.

I told my Mom about this incredible page & while we were out and about yesterday we stopped behind Hoods Gome and checked out their dumpster.

I've seen a lot of posts in this sub about fungus gnats and I thought that it would be a good idea to share my experience. I have had a really bad infestation of fungus gnats before because my potting mix was infested but also it was rainy season and my outdoor garden beds was infested with gnats breeding in the mulch and they flew into my house through the windows/doors. After applying my method, I have went from hundreds of gnats to 0 gnats in my house. The key to getting rid of fungus gnats for good is attacking them from all stages of their life cycle.

1. Mosquito bits (You can get this from amazon)
2. Reusable Filter bag to put mosquito bit kernels into for making the tea (1 tablespoon per litre/gallon) Mosquito bits get mouldy very quickly so its best to put them into a reusable filterbag and then discard the kernels after use. PS: Also use gloves when handling. (You can get this from amazon)
3. Coarse sand or Gnat Barrier (Any sand will do but coarse sand is better for more drainage to keep the top dry, I got mine from a local nursery)
4. Diatomaceous Earth (I got this from a local nursery)
5. Yellow stick traps (Can get this from a local nursery or amazon)
6. Filter paper (I sometimes also use a single ply of tissue paper and put it flat on the drainage hole so its still breathable)

Step 1: Get rid of larvae  
So first thing I did was get mosquito bits. I made a mosquito bit tea, by using hotwater and putting the mosquito bits in a little filter bag and into the water. Soak for a few hours and then water the plant thoroughly from top to bottom.

Step 2: Get rid of adults  
Some plants like moist top soil such as African Violets, Peace Lilys, Zebra plants, etc. So I put a layer of coarse sand or Gnat Barrier on the top of the soil. This will make it harder for adults to crawl into the soil.  
Then I get diatomaceous earth and layer it ontop of the dry sand. Diatomaceous earth is basically death by a thousand cuts to any adult gnat as well as any other pests in the soil. Diatomaceous earth doesn't work well when wet so hence why the sand/gnat barrier on the top soil is always a good idea because it will keep it dry. For extra protection, I put a yellow sticky trap into the pot to catch all the stragglers.

Step 3: Watering from the bottom only  
After you put diatomaceous earth on, you need to bottom water your plant only. Make sure you are still using the mosquito bits tea to water. You want to continue doing this every watering for the next month or two, this is to disrupt the gnat reproduction cycle. Do not water from the top as the diatomaceous earth will become wet and sludgy and it won't work anymore. Adults will no longer be able to lay eggs in the top soil and larvae will no longer be able to chill out at the top because everything in the top soil will be a lot drier now.

Step 4: Beware of Drainage Holes  
Something I learned in my journey is that fungus gnats are not dumb. If they don't have access to the top soil and your plant is off the ground/on a stand or there is access to drainage holes, the gnats will get in by the bottom and start multiplying that way. Something I did was put a filter paper/coffee filter/extremely thin tissue paper over the drainage holes of plants that had their bottom drainage holes accessible to gnats. When watering, I just remove the filter and water.

Step 5: Beware of other breeding spots around your home  
Most likely if you have gnats, they will start going for your other plants too and breeding in their soil. So in this scenario you want to treat all of your other plants in the same way. The only time they won't is if you have something like a cactus or succulent that usually has really dry soil most of the times. If you have a bad infestation, gnats love breeding in the kitchen/toilet/bathroom/laundry in drain holes. I made sure to put bleach down my drains when I had gnats. Because it was rainy season when I had gnats, they were breeding outdoors as well and loved flying at my windows and would come inside the house from outside. If this is happening to you, make sure all windows/doors are closed or turn a light on outside so they flock to the light instead of the windows. Another breeding spot is in any plants without drainage holes. If you have a plant in soil without drainage, get rid of it and get proper drainage. If you have plants growing in leca, that is usually fine as gnats don't breed in leca.

Step 6: Fungus Gnat Free  
Once you are fungus gnat free, you don't want all your plants to get infected again so next time you get a new plant always make sure you isolate for at least 6 weeks and treat the new plant with the above steps. Ensure that the doors are closed in the room you are isolating. Usually takes about 3 weeks for the gnats to start popping up. Once the gnats are gone, you can take them out of isolation.

Other things to consider  
Lots of people say that fungus gnats are a result of overwatering. To reduce overwatering/guess work, I use a moisture meter and only water the plant when it is dry. Also always make sure that you research your plants needs. Some plants are thirstier than others so make sure they have the right soil mix so that it's not retaining more water than it needs. Overwatering however, is not the only reason you may have gnats, I find that most plants you get from big box stores already have gnats/eggs in them. Gnats can also come from your potting mix. If your store bought potting mix has little breathing holes in the packaging, its more than likely they will have fungus gnats and eggs in them. To avoid fungus gnats I would recommend making your own potting mix and avoid buying store bought mixes.

I am aware some people are unable to have access to things like mosquito bits. Another option is neem oil drenches to get rid of the larvae or hydrogen peroxide. These steps MUST be followed up with all the other steps as well because all stages of the life cycle need to be disrupted.",3,1737077608.0,houseplants,1,1.0,False

I'm married to my long-term partner (NB27) and engaged to my fianc√© (M31) but I'm looking for something new!

Some of my interests: 
Board games (like a huge variety), cats, music, crystals, tattoos, piercings, unhinged memes, TikTok, coffee/energy drinks and reading (horror and smut specifically) 

About me:
I have brown hair typically but I do love dying my hair. Hazel eyes that get called pretty often. I'm a hopeless romantic who loves to cuddle, go on cute dates, send sweet memes/TikToks, I'm loyal and empathetic (almost to a fault), I cannot stand dry conversations, I tend to wear shorts and t-shirts because they're comfy. I'm not religious and very liberal. I'm also a mom! 

What I'm looking for: 
I would love someone who will let me be clingy, respond in a timely manner (or let me know that you're away/busy), have a dark sense of humor, and is open and honest, I tend to prefer thick body types but I'm more into your personality. 

I'm currently looking for online and long-term, but I'd love some new friends, and would be interested in-person if we hit it off, dms are open! ‚ô•Ô∏è",1,1737076912.0,polyamoryR4R,1,0.67,False

I've taken to giving her a treat every time I go to work and now she's always there to make sure I get to it on time. Isn't she the sweetest thing? Anyway, I am very happy with what I wrote. We are in the final stretch. One last minor fight scene - or half of one seeing as i'm almost done it - and then the villains will abscond and a the book will be over. I do worry a little that the ending will be a little awkward because originally, this is not where the story would break off. The endings success if entirely hinged on how well I write it. But isn't everything hinged that my writing? That is how writing a work tends to work.

I am exhausted now. The tiredness left me when I got to my writing and it returns almost immediately after I stop. I could honest sleep now and it isn't even 8:30pm yet. Then again, Mother did make a lovely lasagna for dinner so perhaps that's to blame. Either way, I am eager to end this note here. I might have my evening coffee a little early tonight.

**Part 5: Beyond the Zero**

My alarm goes off at 4am, a bit over three-hours after I fell asleep. I am groggy and tired and completely not rested. I‚Äôm also hungry after slowly falling behind on calories all day yesterday and then not being able to have a large meal before going to bed last night. This is not how I‚Äôd hoped to start the second day and I have essentially zero interest in getting back on the bike.

But I‚Äôm going to anyways.

The first task is just to sit up, and that‚Äôs relatively easy - just keep doing one little thing at a time.

Eventually I‚Äôm up, dressed, and walking downstairs with the bike to get some food. I know I need to eat a lot to catch up, but I have minimal appetite ‚Äì the next concerning sign. I force myself to eat, just go slow, have some yogurt, have a coffee. I‚Äôm able to get some semblance of a meal down, but not as much as I know I need. Reluctantly I get up, go outside, and get back on the bike. It is 5:08 am, so only 8 minutes behind schedule. It is dark, I am by myself, and there are relatively few riders on the road around me now unlike last night ‚Äì The Bulge moved on while I slept.

I feel like ass, but I am experienced enough that I know this feeling will improve after about 30 minutes of riding. Just go slow.

As I make my way out of Loudeac I immediately notice that the terrain has changed. There are more hills, they are longer, and they are steeper. And it‚Äôs not just the fatigue and low-mood playing tricks on me ‚Äì the elevation profile confirms it. As I‚Äôm climbing yet another hill, a small group of riders passes me in the other direction, yelling something at me in French that I don‚Äôt understand as they pass.

I keep climbing, but I have a bad gut feeling about this. Am I going the wrong way? While the route is quite well-signed, it would still be fairly easy to miss one, especially in the dark as you‚Äôre tired. This feeling of disquiet grows and I eventually stop and pull out my Google Maps‚Ä¶ confirming I had made my first wrong turn of the event and was going the wrong way. God Damnit! I turn around and continue.

It‚Äôs 30 minutes later now and I still feel like ass.

It‚Äôs also colder out this morning (14C and damp; almost cold enough to do-up my jersey zipper) than it was the first one, but that is OK with me ‚Äì yesterday was too hot. The darkness takes longer to pass than it did yesterday as there is no excitement anymore, just vague discontent that I am only averaging 20kph because of all these stupid hills and calorie deficiency ‚Äì I am supposed to be averaging 25kph today! My maltodextrin powder which saved me yesterday is also completely unpalatable today, making me want to gag a bit even thinking about it. But I still force myself to have a sip every once and a while.

When the sun does come up it is foggy, and the land is different. Unlike yesterday which seemed to be endless cropland at times, this country is wilder with fewer farms and more forests. There is a concerning nausea slowly growing and worsening in my stomach and I need to slow down even further. But as the day continues to lighten, I start craving food‚Ä¶ only certain foods though. Like soup, or stew. In fact, I‚Äôm fantasizing about drinking soup. That‚Äôs a weird one, I‚Äôve never had that on a ride before. I talk myself out of this, because I know it is exceedingly unlikely that they will have soup at the control. I come across the first secret control of the event, and keep plodding.

https://preview.redd.it/s9k71elzggde1.jpg?width=371&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=56574bc9ca1d0304968b9fc15a50d445b305a6e0

Eventually, I arrive in Carrhaix after riding those 80km at only 22.9kph, about 45min behind pace. I really need to go to the bathroom and am directed to a line of porta-potties. Opening door number 1 reveals a giant pile of shit all over the toilet seat. Wonderful. Behind door number 2 is‚Ä¶ a giant pile of shit all over the toilet seat. Behind door number 3 is‚Ä¶ a heaping pile of shit *in* the toilet at least, because the porta-potty needs to be emptied. I choose the lesser of evils, then make my way into the food hall (thank god for hand sanitizer).

AND HOLY SHIT THEY HAVE SOUP!!!

This day suddenly became a lot better. I decide I‚Äôm going to take as long as it takes at this control to feel closer to normal. I sit down with my gigantic bowl of hot vegetable soup, slurp it back, and am happy. Then I work my way through a plate of hot pasta with mushroom sauce, and a cup of coffee, and I feel much better. The nausea is gone.

[Life-saving soup!](https://preview.redd.it/jv6gtcc1hgde1.jpg?width=356&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=34fb6f2158842a427469575048cf9f68ec9a562d)

As I leave Carrhaix and start the 90km to Brest, it‚Äôs obvious I‚Äôve caught back up to The Bulge, as I‚Äôm once again riding through a stream of riders. It is still hilly and a bit cool and cloudy, and I have accepted that I‚Äôm just going to go slow today, and if I‚Äôm behind pace, so be it. Still not a big fan of the maltodextrin drink mix though, which means I will need to take in more solid calories along the road and not just at controls. Which also means more stoppage time. I make my way up ‚ÄúThe Big Hill‚Äù which is 18km long, but only \~2% average gradient. At the top is a gentleman playing harmonica and singing, and offering riders free coffee and brioche. This seems like a good place to stop, so I hang out for a bit, eat half a loaf of brioche and take in the sights and sounds for a while, then continue.

https://preview.redd.it/00tfnym2hgde1.jpg?width=809&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4ee1332f2efd98cff273115e3e8346b2562d67a5

I‚Äôve managed to make some positive progression on the calorie situation with all the brioche and am feeling pretty good by now. Near Brest, a rider that I‚Äôve passed reacts to me passing them, and grabs my tail. It‚Äôs a Korean dude who started Sunday night and looks exhausted, but managed to find a burst of energy to jump on with me. Based on when they would have started, they must be pretty close to their time cut off for Brest, so OK, you hang on, and I‚Äôll pull you into Brest, let‚Äôs do this.

We get into Brest a bit after noon and I congratulate the guy. He‚Äôs obviously happy/excited, but doesn‚Äôt have that much English, so I never learned his full story. I also need to keep moving because I‚Äôm like 90 minutes behind pace now and feeling well enough that this is back on my mind. I‚Äôve come to terms with the fact my stomach only wants to eat hot meals today though, so I eat a solid meal at the control and am feeling good right now. However, the first signs of sleep deprivation are starting to leak through. I‚Äôm definitely somewhat disinhibited, as witnessed by the fact I just reached into my bibs and put chamois cream on at the bike rack, rather than in the washroom‚Ä¶ and in doing so flashed some older French rider‚Ä¶ who I then small talk with for a bit. I recognize this is not normal, but also don‚Äôt really care.

Leaving Brest to go back to Carrhaix takes a different route than going to Brest. And this 93km stage is by far the hilliest stretch of the whole event, averaging 1.4% gradient. It‚Äôs also sunny out now and fairly warm (28C), but I‚Äôm off. I pass by the Atlantic Ocean, and the iconic bridge in Brest, but only take pictures very briefly as I‚Äôm focused on riding again. This is entering new territory for me ‚Äì I‚Äôve never done a ride longer than \~620km before.

I had been worried about this stage due to the mental hurdle plus all the climbing, but quickly come to realize the terrain actually plays to my strengths. The hills are relatively steep, but also short ‚Äì they only take 3-5 minutes to climb, and that part of the power-duration curve is a strength of mine. Then there is a descent which is another of my strengths. So, the stage I had been worried about ended up being my favorite.

A few kilometers after leaving Brest, I came across an Indian rider who had gotten off his bike and was walking it up the hills. I slowed down to try and cheer him on, patting him on the pack and yelling ‚ÄúAllez!‚Äù but his only response to this was to look at me with dead eyes and respond ‚Äúne pas allez.‚Äù And yet, he was still carrying out the Sisyphean task of *walking* up the first of hundreds of hills, almost as physically far away as he could possibly be from the finish. I teared up a little bit.

This stretch leaving Brest was also jam-packed with local families cheering riders on. Every hundred meters would be some locals sitting in lawn chairs offering words of encouragement, or a class of school children screaming ‚ÄúALLEZZZZ!!!‚Äù I teared up a bit at this too‚Ä¶ which actually on further reflection is kind of odd. Huh, I must be starting to get some emotional lability from sleep deprivation too.

By around 5pm I had arrived back in Carrhaix and was continuing to feel good. Despite some early warning signs of sleep deprivation, I didn‚Äôt feel tired either. I‚Äôd also made up 30min of time over that last stage, so was now only 60min down. The food hall in Carrhaix was quite hot though, and the lines were very long. I was tempted to leave, but knew I needed another proper meal again, and didn‚Äôt know where else I could get one any faster.

After waiting in line for about half an hour, it‚Äôs finally my turn to pay‚Ä¶ and some random guy in line behind me faints. He seems fine and given the context it‚Äôs most likely some combination of vasovagal syncope and heat stress, but everyone is just standing there staring at him. And more importantly no one is ringing through my order. So I get to play first responder for the second time, quickly chatting with him and confirming he‚Äôs fine. This seems to get everyone out of their stupor, and people start doing things again. Like ringing through my dinner. (Hmm‚Ä¶ maybe I‚Äôm getting a bit irritable.)

I set out into the evening for another hilly stage back to my hotel in Loudeac ‚Äì 85km, and 1.2% average gradient. I was still feeling strong physically at this point and didn‚Äôt feel tired at all. The terrain still played to my strengths, so I kept going hard up the hills, then descending quickly down them. I was definitely in the heart of The Bulge at this point, as the density of riders was frankly insane. Whereas before it was a steady stream of people, this was just a constant coagulation of exhausted riders bumping their way down the road. No one paid any attention to where they were going. They didn‚Äôt ride in a straight line. They didn‚Äôt look where they were going. They would ride on the wrong side of the highway. And literally everywhere you looked there were people sleeping in ditches. Like hundreds and hundreds of people, just passed out in the ditch.

With the sheer volume of riders around you, you started to notice some weird things. Like the guy who had a trumpet with him. Wait. That‚Äôs actually really weird. Was there actually a person with a trumpet, or did I just imagine that? Now that you mention it, there‚Äôs lots of really weird things. Like it‚Äôs not normal for people in fluorescent yellow vests to be sleeping in ditches everywhere you look. Am I imagining this? No, I convince myself that this is normal given I am riding PBP, but on some level I am still somewhat concerned that this isn‚Äôt real. I also have a few weird transient ideas of reference that things are happening, or people are doing these things, *just for me;* but those pass quickly as well.

By the time I pull into Loudeac it‚Äôs 10:30pm, and the control is once again completely swamped with riders. My vague issues with reality testing and ideas of reference due to sleep deprivation resolved within an hour or so and I was still feeling really good. As a result, I made the decision that I was going to just take a quick nap at my hotel then keep riding through the night, which should put me on pace to finish sometime around 62 hours total.

By the time I‚Äôve eaten a meal, showered, and gotten the bike ready for Day 3, it‚Äôs a bit after midnight, and I immediately pass out upon laying down in bed.

It would turn out that tomorrow would be an interesting day...

>I started full time work recently and have had less and less time to give towards actually drawing and practicing art. The consistent paycheck is welcome and, well, it's nice to be kept busy while developing fun connections with people that I see and talk to on a daily/weekly basis. Yet the immense sacrifice of personal time weighs heavily on my drive to continue honing my art skillset when so much of my time off of work is dedicated to preparing for the next workday.

>I wasted a lot of my time during my early years through drug and video game addiction, a time sink which existed well before the trauma of a near-death experience during my first year of university away from home but was certainly exacerbated by it. I eventually replaced it with art and studies. To say that it took years and a few failed degrees to do so is an understatement, but I eventually felt a little more... happy with the place that I was in as a better student even though money was tight.

>As long as I was occupied by full time studying with part time work with some hours of drawing, I was content. As long as I didn't go on social media and see actual artists flaunting about their fantastic pieces or their rich, overpaid commissioners flaunting about their purchased goods, I wasn't overcome by envy and jealousy with a mix of anger and sadness. I've always been humble and reserved with my work without feeling the need to toss it in front of the rest of the world, so I never related to what people do with their showboating.

>But I eventually graduated and mostly gave up studying. I then eventually picked up full-time work (with a fair amount of overtime) and mostly gave up my free time. I want to go back and do graduate school to continue studying and have better jobs lined up in the future. However, the full time work paycheck is nicer than the paltry earnings that I've had in the past. The problem is that I fear becoming the thing that I dislike the most: An art ""commissioner"". Even the supposed title disgusts me because of the people that I've seen associated with it: Egotistical braggarts who think that money is a pass to get anything that they want without even raising a pencil or pen. They don't do art, they just pay someone else to make it for them and reap the spoils of attention on their social media profiles.

>I'm okay with the idea of supporting artists in need. I am NOT okay with the idea of obsessing over a popular artist's availability for mental harlotry and an ego boost.

I still stand by this. I've been working every year of my damn life since I was young enough to legally hold a job. To what? Makes end meet, acquire an education that I hoped would allow me to get a better payed job but has hardly netted me more than work which doesn't require a degree? Meanwhile these egotistical pricks make enough money in their empty lives to satiate their degenerate ego without empathizing with the struggles endured through spending years of study and practice in a craft. I grow tired knowing that I struggled every inch of the way through collecting beer and coffee-soaked trash bags, cleaning some stranger's gran-nan liquid bowel contents from her body for the fourth time in one night among dozens of similarly suffering patients, and have been treated like dirt from college instructors for picking the wrong major for years and years while some hedonistic degenerate soaked in his own escapism can live like 16th century royalty by tossing beer money at someone who draws desperately for dinero.

I am tired and find myself alone in this damn existential struggle. ",0,1737076518.0,self,5,0.2,False

During the day she will go from lovely calm wake windows, to the odd fussy period, to sparked out asleep. She'll even be moved into her bassinet, asleep or awake, no problem. Basically rainbows and sunshine. 

Fast forward to 5pm and the my baby becomes possessed by a demon somewhat resembling the velociraptors of Jurrasic Park. If those velociraptors were also to be possessed by a banshee. 

8pm to midnight is where she really turns it up a notch. Our little velocibanshee goes from pretty damn grumpy to AWAKE. Like, chasing a large black coffee down with 15 red bulls awake. She then obviously gets overtired and turns into a tiny crying Jackie Chan. An hour later holding her, bouncing her and giving her some boob and she'll sometimes settle. Still wide awake. 

By about 11pm/midnight she'll sometimes be falling asleep. Hallelujah! Then we slowly put her down. Remove contact slowly over 10 mins or so to help keep her asleep when she jolts around. 5 mins later, you guessed it, awake. We start the process again, rinse and repeat. 

Seriously though, we have a routine (bath, change of clothes, into the bedroom, no lights, no tv, have a feed, burp ans settle). She's farts and burps well and shows no signs of trapped gas. Nappies are fine etc. But she just get so awake and inconsolably fussy sometimes through the whole night. Max she'll sleep is around 2 hours but it takes over an hour to settle her again. We limit how long she naps for and try to make sure her wake time is an hour or more at a time during the day. She absolutely does not work with being out down drowsy but awake. Anything from awake to asleep she just wakes up and cries once in her bed. When we pick her up it's a good hour to settle her again and even then she's often settled but eyes wide open/awake. Yesterday she cried for over 2 hours in my arms until I finally had to wake my wife up to put her on the boob. This is the only thing that settles her but as soon as she's moved from her sleep on the bosom she wakes up in an absolute rage again. 

I know she's too young to be sleep trained but really just want any tips on how we actually get her to recognise that the evening and night are for sleeping, when she seems to become more awake as the evening draws on. And how to get her to actually sleep for even just a few hours in a block. 

TL/DR: demon baby wide awake in evening and night. Tried every thing known to man to settle/help baby associate night with sleep. Please send help. ",1,1737076326.0,sleeptrain,1,1.0,False

She would always bake me and my grandfather cookies walked with me to shops gave me money.

She had one problem though, she had a drinking problem.

Getting older i started looking down on her because she drank too much.

It came to a point where i pushed her one side from full conversations everyday that conversations because ""Hmm yes"" , ""okay"" and ""okay bye"" 

1 September 2024 it seemed like a normal day , i did my laundry and went to hang it outside since it was a sunny day, that afternoon 3 o clock my grandmother came and said ""i took your washing off and folded it you just need to pack it away"" my reply to that was ""okay thanks"" she asked me to make her a cup of coffee because she wanted coffee i replied "" jeez cant you make for yourself"" and continued making me a cup of coffee and went sat down and drank it. 

(We have 2 houses on one property, she lived in the other one) 

About 8 o clock i hear a panicking call from her house, i called my mom who was in the living room "" agh mom grandmother is call again"" my mom going to her house to her bedroom seeing her sit on the bed sweating breathing heavily holding her chest telling my mom it hurts please call an ambulance. They rushed her to hospital on their way there she became unresponsive in the car. Got to the hospital layed her down on the hospital bed, they told us to het out 5 min later they come through telling us they did everything they could.

Till today cry and wish i didn't push her away, wish i could turn back time and make her that last cup of coffee. Everything happened so fast no one could say bye.

Karen and Ken got married in 2023. They mooched a church wedding because she had to have one. Nevermind the fact that they didn't have money to rent a church, pay the pastor, get the decorations, or anything. They barely scraped together money for the license and clothes. She also had to have a wedding cake, even got a Mr and Mrs topper,  and a reception though she can't eat at all by mouth. Ken was, and still is, a portly fellow. I have a friend that is a Pastor at a church and he decided to be  generous with his time and the church and do the wedding because we have known each other for a while. The only thing I actually volunteered to do was be her matron of honor and I was going to surprise her with a bridal shower. I all but ended up planning the entire darn thing, mid-semester in university classes for me, for the lazy couple. My only ask was that the wedding was in the morning because I had coursework due on Saturday afternoons that I usually was putting final touches on to keep my GPA at 4.0. The wedding was scheduled for 10 a.m. as I knew that I would need to be up early and pick up Ken and Karen, they don't drive, and they live 45 minutes from me in the opposite direction of the church. I had budgeted in 3 hours of drive time that day on my dime because they never have money for gas but they expect free transportation or they walk. I was onboard to do at least the shower and be there for her on her wedding day. That is until Ken decided to have an attitude about the whole situation, Ken had planned nothing, done nothing, and wanted everything to be easy for him, but decided the wedding that I had done most of the legwork on, free of charge mind you, was their day after he and the Pastor decided they needed enough time to drink coffee before the wedding. I promptly cancelled the shower because they knew I was on a time constraint. He swore university students didn't have coursework due on weekends and I informed him uni is nothing like high school which is all he has barely. I also bowed out of the wedding and didn't do another thing.

Before their first anniversary even rolled around they were already separated and she was essentially homeless living in a shelter. She left all of the presents from the shower that some of the church ladies gave her. Karen stayed her max at the shelter but already had another guy on the line before she needed to move.  Both Karen and Ken decided committing adultery was fine even though she had to have that church wedding, they both claim to be Christian people, but break one of the big commandments. She moved in with this new guy as soon as her time was up.  Of course, it's a Section 8 apartment. The new guy doesn't work either. None of her husbands or boyfriends ever have a job, a car, buy their own food, or a home of their own. Ken moved in a new woman as soon as Karen was gone. He lost one of Karen's five cats. All of them get every government handout they can get. Karen decided she was going to divorce Ken for free with legal aide. A year and a half after their nuptials they are officially divorced. That's the best damn petty revenge on that whole relationship because I knew from the beginning it wouldn't last.",1,1737076295.0,u_CornerAdventurous946,0,1.0,False

However lately i have been feeling uncomfortable because she gets offended by some things I say or do. I want to say too that it is okay and i respect if she feels offended. 

The problem is that she keeps demanding apologies for those things even after I already apologized and we have talked it out and decided to let go, she also always brings up how i offended her in the past if there is an argument.

I will give you guys some examples:


‚Ä¢ we were talking about starting a business and she said she knows what its like to run a bussines because she sold cocktails on a christmas market once, to which i replied ‚Äúyeah but just selling cocktails on a market is nothing compared to running a long-term business 24/7‚Äù. After that she got offended and said i was making fun of her cocktail stand, I apologized and pointed out that i didnt mean to make fun of it, just wanted to say that it is different than operating a full business. After that she wrote a whole letter about how i offended her and i apologized again but she thought I didnt mean my apology so stayed mad about it for another 2 days and brought it up multiple times


‚Ä¢ another time we were on vacation and we needed to clean the airbnb with not much time left to catch our flight, she didnt want to get out of bed while i was already up and cleaning, i tried to get her out calmly but it didnt work, after that she got up and just started listening music on the couch and drinking coffee like its a sunday morning, when i told her niceley to clean she didnt really care that much so i had enough and I said with a more aggressive tone ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like your lazy attitude and i want you to help me clean now because we are running late‚Äù. After that she was sad because i was being mean to her, i apologized and told her i didn‚Äôt mean to hurt her i just wanted to make her realise we need to hurry. She didnt accept the apology because I was according to her not apologizing but just justifying me being mean at her. Only after apologizing multiple times in the course of the day after she kept asking for one over and over she was not mad anymore

I honestly don‚Äôt think I am that unreasonable and i am a bit tired of having to apologize all the time for small things over and over, I often just apologize always when she demands it because I just don‚Äôt want to argue anymore

What do you guys think I can do to make her realize that im not hurting her on purpose? And how can i make her stop bringing up the past? Also do you guys think I was treating her wrong in those 2 situations and just don‚Äôt realize it?

Sorry for the long vent, this is only a small part of our relationship and i could write a whole book about the good things about my girlfriend

I like... More people than I probably should. But that's not the point! 

Currently I think I have 3 primary crushes. One is a girl who's been in my class for many years now and I've always thought she was cute and beautiful. I don't know much about her though. 

Another is a girl I met more recently, probably 1-2 years ago. Her and I talk more often, but not a great deal. We run a club together at school. She always shows incredible kindness but I can't tell if she likes me or not. We had coffee together one time and neither of us knew if it was a date or not. 

The third is similar to the first only I've not known her very long. I think she's cute and really the only reason she's more on my radar now is because recently I got back from the hospital and she was the only one to ask how I was doing. I think that very well might have been the first time we talked.

Just like the documentary, had to get through it in instalments, hoping to not get to the end.  The experience of the documentary and the book seemed like watching the home videos of your best friends.  Deeply meaningful, and often leading to deep thought and personal reflection.  Going through, there was this relentless hope that the ending would turn out differently and this gnawing understanding in disbelief that it just wouldn‚Äôt happen.  I really appreciate the stories and anecdotes and getting more insight to the albums and the journey of the band along the way.  It was tough to hear about the hard times.  The guys definitely have weathered some storms, and will always carry with them both pleasure and peril it seems of their experiences.  I hope that they are all doing well. It‚Äôs fun to imagine one day being in Kingston and running into some of the guys.  Having a coffee or a beer with them and talking about whatever - the weather, hockey, music and guitars.   Just Canadians being Canadians. 

Ive always been a fan but now I really enjoy listening to the albums in sequence and hear the evolution of the sound over time, across all of the guys.   It‚Äôs amazing to be able to listen to the albums and learn something new each time in different ways - I can listen for entertainment, I can listen to the songs trying to understand what Gord was getting at.  (I can imagine Gord giving that quiet half smile while sitting in a Muskoka chair by the lake - yeap you understand that song, I can also imagine him chuckling as I try to find deep meaning in places where the stories might be just superficial). I can listen to them building my own personal meaning and interpretations and I listen to them closely to hear the other members tell their part of the stories through their instruments and how they evolved over time.  

Amazing music and stories, thanks guys.

Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm reaching out for help and advice as I navigate a challenging health situation. On December 1st, I was diagnosed with esophagitis after a visit to the emergency room due to some bleeding. Over the past six weeks, I‚Äôve lost 30 pounds, which, while not all bad initially, has now left me struggling to maintain my weight and energy. I worry that I‚Äôm not getting enough nutrition to support my healing process.

**Background**:  
Since May 2024, I‚Äôve gone through a series of health issues: sepsis, followed by pneumonia, and now esophagitis. I suspect that the massive doses of antibiotics I was given have significantly disrupted my gut microbiome, which I‚Äôve been trying to rebuild over the past six weeks. I‚Äôm not sure how successful I‚Äôve been so far.

**Current Situation**:  
I have significant swallowing difficulties. Right now:

* In the mornings, I manage to have an almond milk smoothie loaded with whey protein, powdered Ensure, and a few crushed vitamins (I use a coffee bean grinder to crush them).
* The rest of the day, I can only handle 100% thin liquids like water or broth.

Here‚Äôs what works best for me: I take two small to medium swallows, using my tongue to push the liquid down both sides of my throat, then I wait 3‚Äì10 minutes before I can attempt another two swallows. Anything more than two swallows tends to sit in the back of my throat and comes back up.

**What I Need Help With**:

1. **Nutrition**: I‚Äôm not getting enough nutrients to heal or maintain my weight. Does anyone have tips or recommendations on how to pack in more calories and nutrients through liquids?
2. **Pureed Foods**: I‚Äôd like to try pureeing meats, vegetables, and other nutrient-dense foods to make them thin enough to drink through a straw. Does anyone have tips on how to do this effectively?
3. **Healing Support**: If you‚Äôve been through something similar or have ideas for improving my situation (nutrition, gut microbiome, esophagus healing), I‚Äôd love to hear from you.

I haven‚Äôt been scoped yet, and honestly, I have limited confidence in the doctors I‚Äôve seen so far. I know some people have gone through dozens of doctors without solutions, and I want to avoid that if I can. My goal is to take control of my nutrition and healing.

Thank you so much for taking the time to read this. If any of this resonates with you or if you have advice, I‚Äôd greatly appreciate it!",2,1737074608.0,dysphagia,1,1.0,False
1i343en,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1i343en/great_tea_as_coffee_replacement/,Great Tea as Coffee Replacement,"Great Tea as Coffee Replacement

I had been about a week caffeine free and was looking for The Drink. 

I used to start my morning with a large cup of coffee. At work I hardly ever drank coffee and if I did, I drank decaf. Then at home in the evening I often drank decaf coffee or decaf black tea otherwise I would not sleep. I never liked herbal teas as they did nothing for me as I was addicted to caffeine even if it was in small doses in decaf. 

Now I was looking for The Drink that I would like, the one I could be looking forward to. Especially in the morning and in the evenings. 

I went through Republic of Tea and found two teas that I liked:

- Vietnamese Cinnamon. It is lovely slightly sweet beverage that I make at work in Maison Jar and drink through the day. 

- Cardamom Cinnamon. This one has okay taste. But for me it was not the tea I would go to often. I can say it is not bad when there is nothing else üôÇ.

I happened to purchase Bengal Spice by Celestial Seasonings and was stunned by its flavor!!! RICH. Sweet. Insanely wow. Immediately I thought ‚Äúit is too good to be true‚Äù. Too sweet. I am also off sugar so I am not looking forward to start drinking it. I was investigating where this sweetness comes from. And google convinced me it is from carob and cinnamon. But‚Ä¶ then I saw it among ingredients ‚Äúnatural flavors‚Äù. Aha! So here is ‚Äúsugar‚Äù. Probably some other sweetener. 

I also tried Cinnamon Apple Spice by Celestial Seasonings . Wow! The taste is hmmm very sweet and tart at the same time and something else. Again, ‚Äútoo good to be true‚Äù. Aha! Also, in the ingredients there are ‚Äúnatural flavors‚Äù. 

I purchased Roastaroma by Celestial Seasonings. Now guys, there is no ‚Äúnatural flavors‚Äù in this one. Roasted barley, roasted chicory, roasted carob, cinnamon, allspice, and star anise. Although, as Bengal Spice it has Carob and Cinnamon, it is not sweet! So I was right, the sweetness was coming from ‚Äúnatural flavors‚Äù in other teas. This Roastaroma  is the closest thing to coffee drink. It has this very rounded taste with some bitterness in it. It is black - the same color as coffee. It hits the sweet spot just right. 

If you are not absolutely satisfied with water or chamomile tea or ginger lemon and are looking for coffee-like beverage, give it a try!

I‚Äôm learning to properly steam milk and I‚Äôve been having a little bit of a hard time. I feel like it doesn‚Äôt get thick enough - is that a me problem or a machine problem? Im a little worried about the steamer because it makes a LOT of noise but i can‚Äôt tell if its more noise than it should be or if i just make my lattes in a quiet house when no one else is awake lol. 

I know this post isn‚Äôt very specific, I just was hoping someone might give me some insight on it. ",2,1737074503.0,espresso,6,1.0,False

As an Indian, I remember how I discovered him randomly one day back in 2015 when I was bored and started watching a film called Mulholland Drive. I had no idea that my life was about to change. He completely changed the way I looked at life, art and stories in general. He helped me appreciate the mundane, the dark and the bizarre. The man who nurtured my creative soul didn't speak my language, he was so alien to my existence and yet he has left a lifelong impact on me. I owe a great deal to him and will always be indebted to his artistic brilliance. His work will be with the world for eternity. Thank you David Lynch. I'll cry tonight but I'll watch your work again and smile tomorrow with a cup of coffee under sunshine and blue skies. ü•∫üå∏",9,1737074499.0,davidlynch,0,1.0,False

1i34280,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaffeineFreeLife/comments/1i34280/great_tea_as_coffee_replacement/,Great Tea as Coffee Replacement,"I had been about a week caffeine free and was looking for The Drink. 

I used to start my morning with a large cup of coffee. At work I hardly ever drank coffee and if I did, I drank decaf. Then at home in the evening I often drank decaf coffee or decaf black tea otherwise I would not sleep. I never liked herbal teas as they did nothing for me as I was addicted to caffeine even if it was in small doses in decaf. 

Now I was looking for The Drink that I would like, the one I could be looking forward to. Especially in the morning and in the evenings. 

I went through Republic of Tea and found two teas that I liked:

- Vietnamese Cinnamon. It is lovely slightly sweet beverage that I make at work in Maison Jar and drink through the day. 

- Cardamom Cinnamon. This one has okay taste. But for me it was not the tea I would go to often. I can say it is not bad when there is nothing else üôÇ.

I happened to purchase Bengal Spice by Celestial Seasonings and was stunned by its flavor!!! RICH. Sweet. Insanely wow. Immediately I thought ‚Äúit is too good to be true‚Äù. Too sweet. I am also off sugar so I am not looking forward to start drinking it. I was investigating where this sweetness comes from. And google convinced me it is from carob and cinnamon. But‚Ä¶ then I saw it among ingredients ‚Äúnatural flavors‚Äù. Aha! So here is ‚Äúsugar‚Äù. Probably some other sweetener. 

I also tried Cinnamon Apple Spice by Celestial Seasonings . Wow! The taste is hmmm very sweet and tart at the same time and something else. Again, ‚Äútoo good to be true‚Äù. Aha! Also, in the ingredients there are ‚Äúnatural flavors‚Äù. 

I purchased Roastaroma by Celestial Seasonings. Now guys, there is no ‚Äúnatural flavors‚Äù in this one. Roasted barley, roasted chicory, roasted carob, cinnamon, allspice, and star anise. Although, as Bengal Spice it has Carob and Cinnamon, it is not sweet! So I was right, the sweetness was coming from ‚Äúnatural flavors‚Äù in other teas. This Roastaroma  is the closest thing to coffee drink. It has this very rounded taste with some bitterness in it. It is black - the same color as coffee. It hits the sweet spot just right. 

If you are not absolutely satisfied with water or chamomile tea or ginger lemon and are looking for coffee-like beverage, give it a try!
