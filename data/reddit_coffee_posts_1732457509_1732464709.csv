1gyufwn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gyufwn/i_36f_got_salty_with_bf_34m_and_said_this_isnt/,I 36f got salty with bf 34m and said this isn't working. Now I regret it,"For some background, this guy came into my life as I was fixing a bunch of things in it. Changing jobs, getting my car fixed for a new job, healing some wounds. He had asked me out for coffee and I declined and explained what was going on in my life. He was very understanding and we still continued talking.


We found that we had seriously everything in common and grew to really like each other. I finally met with him at a mutual friends get together, once my car was fixed and my new job started. We hit it off so well and I fell hard for him. 


He said he fell hard for me too. We kissed a lot that first night, and even shared a bed (no sex). For a couple days after, he was so into me. Talking about getting a different shift or different job to match my schedule. I work days and he works nights. Said he wanted to be in a relationship.. 


I agreed with all of this and was trying to make it work by spending time with one another over video chat some nights. There were many nights I stayed up later than I should, just to get a little time with him. Also worthy to note, we live about an hour apart so physically seeing each other is a once a week thing. 


But it seemed to be a pattern of the first couple of days after seeing each other, he's over the moon about us. Then it dwindles off to where he's talking to me like a Bro. His responses become hours apart. He claims he is sleeping all day. Which I'm understanding about and I don't even say anything about it or act distant myself. There are nights I just straight up pass out before he gets off of work and he's been understanding to that as well. 


We saw each other this past weekend. He wanted to watch the fight with his friends, so he brought over his laptop and got on discord with them the first 3 hours he was here. Then we started making out again and touching each other. Still didn't go all the way. Which in hindsight, I'm happy about.


We put ourselves in a relationship on social media. Really hit it off again and it felt right. This week though, he went right back with the distance. It's a night and day behavior as far as how he acts when we're together, and how he acted prior to meeting in person.


I brought it up once and asked if everything is okay, because I'm perceiving some distance and shortness way different than normal. He insists he just has a lot going on right now (lives with toxic mother). So I am understanding to that. Then it became him sleeping all day. Which again, trying to be understanding about it.  I asked if he's okay, again, thinking maybe he's having it rough or something.


I don't feel we really had much quality time the prior weekend, because he spent most of it watching a game with his friends then pretty much just wanted to rub all over me and not much else. 


It starts feeling very familiar to things I've been through before, where a guy was all about deep conversations and cool activities together, but then once he had me he just was only interested in that. We didn't have sex yet and that was his hesitance due to being tired that night. So I start getting confused and think he's obviously not just trying to use me for my body, but at the same time, his energy was purely focused on that. No conversations, no crafting and games like he said he wanted to do. 


Queue to this weekend with him canceling Saturday and offering staying the night Sunday, which I should have just went with, but I was thinking about how with his distancing, that Sunday probably wouldn't happen either... 


All of this in mind, I let my emotions of the confusion take over and reverted back to a very old way of dealing with the pain that I thought I was long past... I told him that's cool, I had already made plans anyhow as I saw this coming. It was snippy, rude, abrupt. I figured I could bounce back from it, but I spiraled from there. He found it odd I'd preemptively made other plans. Apologized that his life in unstable right now and he's sorry he can't be more present. 


What got to me is, that he pursued this relationship so hard. I was willing to take things slow, give it a good few months before getting serious. He wanted a relationship. He said we were perfect for each other. He wanted that title and was even trying to plan some vacations for the future. I really thought we were on the same page. 


So instead of delving further into his explanation, I told him this just isn't working and I don't think I can do this hot cold thing. Like I said, I spiraled into an immature self protect mode..


He said he's fine with just being friends and that he really needs to work on getting his life a little more stable. That his current state makes it difficult for him to maintain relationships. He was in the beginning though.. It sounded like the typical ""let them down easy"" approach, or at least how i perceived it. The energy just didn't match at all sometimes. I'm a consistent person. There are bad days of course, but if I'm in a bad state, I won't date because I know I can't give that person the energy and effort they deserve. 


For some reason, though it didn't last long, I'm really hurting over him badly. Everything was so perfect with him, and the hot cold Rollercoaster and things just not adding up (claiming insomnia but seems to be asleep a lot) was the only issue. 


I later tried to back track on this and said I really do like him, and I let things get to me that shouldn't. That I would like to try again later on down the road if he's willing. 


He stuck to being friends, which I can't really do right away. Not until I get over him.. I feel like I'm the AH because I jumped to conclusions about his distance and abruptly told him this isn't working. 


I feel I could not be the AH in some ways because the energy was definitely different than in the beginning and I felt he just wanted to lay claim to me without putting in the effort to be with me. ",2,1732464591.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

1gyueo6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gyueo6,Just lost my first rat an hour ago,"I’ve had Toge for a few years and god it hurts. I’ve currently got him wrapped in a towel on the kitchen bench, I want to bury him but it’s too dark and cold outside right now so I’ll wait until later.

I was expecting him to go for awhile but you never actually see it coming. It was early in the morning, or late, 1:20ish in the morning, and I was listening to music (Eskimo Joe) when I got this bad feeling. I got up and turned the light on and looked over at him. 

He was still and leaning over his food bowl, the food was untouched, and he was still alive but barely, I knew it must be his time so I grabbed a towel and wrapped him in it and moved him to my bed and laid down with him.

I was patting him and giving him cheek rubs and telling him he was a good boy and always would be my special Butthead (Butthead was one of the many loving nicknames I gave him). I told him that it was okay, he could go now, everything would be okay. Barely 30 seconds after I say goodbye, I watch him take his last breath. 

Monday 25th November at around 1:26am, Toge had died right in front of me, right there in my arms.

If I hadn’t have checked him when I did, and instead fallen asleep, I would’ve woken up to a tragic site, it’s a heartbreaking thought. So I’m glad he didn’t die alone, I’m glad I saw him off. And I’m sad I won’t be able to say things like “Good morning Butthead” and boop him on the nose like I did every morning. I’m going to miss walking into my room with my coffee and look over at him to see him poking his nose through the bars of his cage. 

I’ll miss teasing him with a bird feather. He seemed to really hate birds, jealous little jerk he was. We used to have a Sparrow named Capo and when she was learning to fly the poor thing flew straight onto his cage and Toge jumped up and bit her toe off…

Coincidentally, many years ago now, the same incident happened between the Pigeon we had and my rabbit. My rodents don’t like birds.

I’m sorry if my grammar isn’t great or that this post is all over the place, I just don’t know what to type, I’m just typing and I want to tell you all about Toge. 

I got him as a birthday present, for my 18th birthday I think. God everything from 2019 onward is such a blur ha. My home life wasn’t great, I was struggling, and in comes Toge, precious little Baby Rat Toge (Baby Rat was another one of my loving nicknames for him) and I had been pretty much inseparable since then. And now he’s gone to be with all the other ratties in Rattie heaven.

I really don’t know what else to say, he was just such a good boy and I wish he could’ve stayed with me a little longer. But it’s okay. I’ll be okay. I know that he’s okay now. 

Goodbye Baby Rat.

For context, i've struggled with a restrictive ED from around the ages of 15 up until 20, when i started my recovering process. As of recently i have a healthy weight for my height and can ignore the disordered thoughts for the most part. 

He has known about it from very early in the relationship, but we never really discussed it in full depth until a few months ago. 
I had gained 3kg due to stress binge eating during exam season, and it really really bothered me how it was showing on my body, so i mentioned to him how i was planning to exercise more often to try to go back to my usual weight. 
He was really excited since he likes to go for runs sometimes and i could join him. He then asked if i had maybe considered also going on a diet since the goal was to lose weight and not just being more active. I said that i was thinking about it but was hesitant since it might trigger my ED again. He didnt really understand the conection since he didnt know much about the process/concept/experience of an ED so we had quite a long conversation about it and such. He was super sweet and understanding and never brought up me going on a diet or anything like that again.

A week or so after that he mentioned that he was thinking of trying to lose some weight as well and said he ""weighed quite a bit more than he used to in his peak"", he then clarifies that his peak was in his early 20s, when he used to hike very long trails basically weekly along with doing extracurricular sports during his bachelors degree.
Now, he wasn't overwheight by any means, he was maybe at most on the heavier side of the healthy weight for his height, but he was still generally slender and ive always found him very physically handsome. But i do know that dysmorphia is a bitch, that feeling good in your own body is very important and that the wheight he was trying to reach was still healthy, so I asked him how he was planning to go about that. He said that since nowadays with his job he doesnt have time to be as active as he used to be in that time he plans on eating healthier and have less sugary snacks. 

Thats all well and good, but after that he started skipping meals most days and eating a lot less, to the point where he was moody and his blood pressure fell dangerously sometimes. I told him that that was dangerous and to be careful to not let those thoughts become obsessive and that i was starting to get worried but he assured me that i didnt have to and that he knew his limits. 

He's still skipping meals, and he updates me on his weight quite often. Sometimes he takes a picture of the scale to show me bc it made him so happy. In the last couple months he lost around 10kg, which is still safe but i still worry about him.

About two weeks ago he said his weight wasnt going down as usual and i mentioned that he might have hit a plateau. Its pretty common during weight loss for many reasons, but it frustrated him and ive noticed that he's been eating way less since.

Last week i went to hang out at his place a little later than usual, when i got there he had a terrible migraine, and turns out he hadnt eaten anything since breakfast (it was early evening when i got there and he had a cup of milk with coffee for breakfast at 7am) and had been waiting for me to eat. We naver had any arrangements like that, usually when we watch a movie we have snacks together but its not really a formal thing or anything and it never kept him or me from eating at our own places. I got very worried and tried to get him to eat something, i wasnt hungry but he was very stubborn in only eating if i also ate, and only the usual snacks we have. I conceeded and ate with him but in the end he said he wasnt hungry anymore after like a quarter bag of chips and maybe three cookies. Ive been to his place to hang out a few times since and it hasnt happened again, so i hope that was a one off situation.

I just genuinelly worry for his well being and health, i love this guy and dont want him to go throught what i have. If he is indeed developing an ED then his excitement might be a honeymoon phase, and that passes soon and leaves only the ugly and unhealthy things that i really dont wish for him to go through.

I dont know if im maybe overthinking this, since hes a healthy weight and happy in his journey and such. Maybe im projecting how my thoughts used to be and seeing patterns where there arent any. I dont really know what to think, i comment sometimes if he's eating properly and we joke a little but idk if i should have a proper talk with him about it.

A part of me knows this has to be adressed at least in part, bc this whole thing is also triggering me a bit, ive noticed my disordered thoughts have been more frequent and sometimes i really dont want to eat anymore when i really should. 

Even though i had lost those 3kg a while back and was back at my normal weight, i noticed a few weeks ago that (probably because of this whole situation triggering me a bit) i ended up loosing a bit more weight than planned. Since i dont have a scale, i used the one at his place to confirm my suspicions and when i mentioned to him that i had lost a few more kgs than i expected he pulled me for a kiss. It was an intense one, like at the end of a romance movie when the two leads get together. I felt like a princess. While it was nice, it was also unexpected so i jokingly asked what was that for and he said it was a congratulations. I dont remember the exact words he said rn so the way i say it might sound worse than it was, but the general idea was that it was sort of a prize for having lost more weight than what was expected. 

I dont know how to feel about that either, but i know it has been making me want to restrict again so its probably a good idea to talk to him about it idk.

In the end i just really dont know how to aproach the subject with him in regards to either of those things, but idk if its because EDs are a bit of a personal topic or if i just havent been able to make up my thoughts on everything.

Tl;dr: told my bf that i struggled with an ED in the past, since then he has been showing symptoms of an ED himself and i worry for both his well being and mine since it has also been triggering me. ",2,1732463137.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

A large number of studies generally support not just the safety but benefit of coffee even at the high end of moderation. 

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28853910/

Meta analysis suggests all cause mortality benefit that peaks around 3.5 cups a day:

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31055709/

There is also a line of literature that serum cholesterol and cardiovascular risk can be raised by coffee consumption (these are very small effects), but that a significant portion of this is mediated by diterpenes - cafestol, and kahweol and that this can be mitigated through paper filters. Which is nice, although historically my favorite forms of coffee (espresso and French press) are not really so amenable to paper filtering. 

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29735059/

When patients ask me I generally tell them that I think coffee consumption in moderation is probably net good for most adults (and every once in a while, newspapers will run pieces urging people to teetotal coffee for health purposes, and there just does not seem to be any science behind this). For myself, because I’m getting older and my cholesterol (but not really my cardiac risk score) is trending up, I’m also interested in any small things that might cumulatively keep my lipids healthy.

Thanksgiving on my side of the family is one giant reunion with all the aunts/uncles/cousins and other distant relations. And the only person who knows I’ve left is one sibling out of eight (my husband’s much smaller family is all aware). 

I’m heading down South where Thursday is projected to be 76+ degrees. I have new piercings, I love a good cup of coffee, we’ve been using eating out as a time to try different alcoholic drinks, and knowing there are some younger members of my family who have either left or are likely questioning things feels like a solid reason to not hide any of it. A slight little signaling, a show of solidarity. Also, my kids are aged 10 and under and I’m 99% sure one of them will happily and heartily out us (the more power to them, they’re awesome little balls of walking confidence). The thing is, I don’t want to hide it. I don’t want to hide us. 

Despite my bravado, my body’s recognizing the stress and sleep hasn’t been easy. For all those worried and anxious over this week with seeing family and how they might take the news or harp on the prior discovery of it, we can do this. We’ve got this. We are wonderful human beings with wonderful interests and wonderful bodies and nothing and no one can choose what we get to do with that. We get to decide. We get to invite what we want into our lives and set boundaries for the things we don’t. 

Stay beautiful, my friends. You are deserving of every piece of love and happiness this world has to offer, exactly the way you are.

1gytdy7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1gytdy7/maca_powder_vs_capsule/,Maca powder vs capsule,"When I take Maca in powder form it doesn’t have any noticeable effect but when I take it in capsule it does within a few hours. 

The capsule is Horbaach black maca complex which has an equivalent of 6 grams maca (5 grams yellow and 1 grams black); 600 mg equivalent of panax ginseng and 15mg of black pepper.

The powder is Sevenhills whole foods organic peruvian maca.
Recommend dose 5 grams which should be about 1 teaspoon. Typically i take 2 teaspoons or even more in a shaker with some other stuff (proteins, cocoa, taurine, lecithin and some white coffee)
I also take a tablet of gingko (equivalent to 3 grams) and ginseng (equivalent to 1 gram) on the days when I use maca powder.

So it seems to me the only significant difference is the form (powder vs capsule) and that little pepper that’s included in the capsule.

Why then so much difference in noticeable effect?
Is the capsule more absorbable?

1gytdc5,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1gytdc5/a_different_situation/,A different situation ,"Hi, I've been reading through the subreddit for an hour now. I am in a different situation than most of you are, so I want to put everything I have inside on here and let go of it. 

Exactly one year ago today, 24 of November 2023, this guy from a class messaged me. We started talking, as friends. A small while later he confessed that he had feelings for me. A week later I asked him out. We dated, had put ups and downs. For reasons we broke up in June. 

I tried to go into NC, it wasn't the best effort from me. I broke it a few times. He messaged a few times as well over the summer. 

At the end of september school year started again, he goes to a different school so I don't see him there. We just went to have a coffee, to talk how it had been. How the life is going. I said him firmly ""I want you in my life, I miss you but I don't want a relationship with you."" He agreed to this. So we became sort of friends. 

I thought that every romantic feeling I had for him was over the course of summer. Well, they started to come back and harder than I had fallen for him the first time. We can't be together tho, we can't start a relationship together. I don't want that to be a situation right now. 

I also see him moving on, talking with other people. Which is good, I've been talking as well before I realized I was still carrying feelings for him. 

I like him as a person as well, I enjoy his company. I miss sharing videos with him, a song, a movie, a conversation, a thought... anything I miss sharing things with him. 

3 weeks ago, I found out that he had lied to me when we were together. It wasn't a big deal for him, but it was for me. I still forgive him and we kept on talking. I asked him if there were any lies, he said no. 

Yesterday we went out to have a coffee. I learned another lie from him, back when we were together a lie he said. That lie broke me there infront if him. He is a man who always talks about honesty and how he hates lies. I two lies in my hand, I don't want to learn more this is enough. 

A bit about me, I am a forgiving person. Even tho it hurts, I have already forgave him for the lies but I don't want to keep talking with him. Forgive and forget has always been the way I went with life. This time I need that to change. Forgive but don't forget. Forgiveness is for me, so I don't carry a burden within me. Remembering is for me as well, so I don't accept him if he ever regrets. 

I told him yesterday that ""When we leave here I will not message you ever again, because of all the lies."" I don't think he believes that I will do this or even he remembers it. 

My plan is if he ever messages me just deleting it. I will not even give him a seen notification. If he asks for the reason I will explain in a single paragraph and keep on NC later on. Because even when I've lost my trust in him, I can not bear to be the person who ghosts an explanation. 

I still like him. I will miss him so much. I will see a post on instagram and won't send it. I will listen a song and won't think of him. I will pass through the exact metro station where I asked him out and create new memories. I will cry my heart out and forget him. I will remember him again, miss him again but it will be less intense. Then forget, again. It will be cycle that gets smaller with time. Less emotions and less stuff to forget. And one day I will manage to take photographs out of notebook pages where I glued them. I will take the blue box that's in my wardrobe and throw it in trash. 

Right now, it is hard but it will get easier. Hopefully in a few months I won't even remember his voice. 

Starting yesterday, I am in NC. ",1,1732461774.0,ExNoContact,1,1.0,False
1gytd82,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1gytd82/aio_to_my_best_friend_acting_like_this/,AIO to my “Best Friend” Acting Like This?,"My friends (27F/29F) and I (NB27) have known each other since we were 13. Every year, we end up spending Halloween together, because we’re the closest friends we have, and it just naturally happens. They used to be my neighbors, but a few years ago, they moved to a town 3 hours away. Last year, they moved closer, but still an hour and a half a half away from me. I mention this because neither of them have a car or a license. Any time we hang out, I’m the driver. 

So the weekend before Halloween, I ask them if they want to go out, since they live in essentially Night Club-Ville. They agreed, so I told them I’d call my sister (who is also our very close friend) and see if she wanted to meet up, too. She did, but they were in a different part of Downtown that was more lively, so I call my friends and ask if they’d rather go there and meet up with my sister and her gf, and they do! I know they’re strapped for cash, everyone is. So I let them know that if there’s a cover, I’ll pay it (they don’t tend to be more than $10 around here). The older friend (I’ll call her Amy), asks: “will you be getting the food as well?” Well, I don’t really have the money for everything, so I let them know I could probably get some bar snacks if they had any, but not like, a full dinner. That’s okay with them. 

We get to this bar, and sure enough, the cover is $10, so I pay $30 for us to get in. I am fine with this. We step to the side and start talking about where we wanted to hang, and immediately, Amy and (I’ll call her) Megan come up to us and tell us they’re leaving. We’ve not even cleared the main walkway yet. I ask why and to go where, and they say that one of them is having an anxiety attack and they’re just gonna hang out in a coffee shop around the corner. I’m a bit pissed that I just paid $20 for them to open the door and then leave, but I can’t keep them anywhere obviously, so okay, “I’ll meet you when we’re ready to leave.” And they go off.

A few hours later, I call them to see where they’re at, because my sister and I are going to a different bar. They said they were out getting food. I’m a bit taken aback again, because they’ve asked me to pay for everything thus far, claiming they don’t have money, and now they’re eating at a Japanese restaurant. I tell them where we’ll be, and not an hour later, they text me that they’re “not having a good time” and they’re getting an Uber home…which they ask me to pay for. I wouldn’t have regardless, but I didn’t see their text until way later, because we were at the bar. I see it and ask if they got home okay. They say yes, but that they “feel really abandoned rn”. Frankly, I’m pissed at this point. 

When the day of Halloween rolls around, I had a really important licensure exam (that I passed :)) that went from 8a-2p. My phone had to be powered off and locked in a locker during that time. We had plans to meet up around 6 so they could come with me to take my son trick or treating and then we’d do whatever afterwards. Well, I power up my phone after the test, and I have SEVEN BACK TO BACK MISSED CALLS from Amy and 2 from Megan. I check my texts, and Amy is apparently freaking out because she’s “been sending memes on Instagram and hasn’t heard anything”. We are not those kinds of people. We look at the memes, laugh, and move on, but things don’t (typically) disintegrate if no one replies for a bit. I resolve to gather my thoughts on the drive home from the test facility and respond then. Except Amy proceeds to call my TWENTY. TIMES. on the drive. And in the middle of that, I get a call from my mom…that Amy just tried to call her, too. And TWO messages from my sister that Amy messaged “is [me] alive?? It’s been five days and they haven’t texted me!” to both her main and photography account. I’m shaking mad. 

I essentially lay it all out. I tell them that I’m not happy with their behavior the previous Saturday and that they’re not entitled to my time like this. It’s not even remotely okay that they blew up my phone and my family like that. All Amy keeps saying is that she “just wants a few seconds of communication, because not talking to me for five days is disturbing and unsettling”, as if it’s unheard of. It’s not. We can go for a week or so without talking, it happens all the time. 

I end up telling them that I can’t be responsible for them like this. I blocked their numbers and unfollowed them on everything. But now I feel like I’m in CrazyTown, because I feel bad. AIO?",0,1732461765.0,AmIOverreacting,0,0.33,False

1gytaqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/FishingForBeginners/comments/1gytaqp/night_fishing_insights_from_the_late_great_john/,Night Fishing Insights from the late great John  Mckean R.I.P,"“Morning! How about a cup of hot coffee?” called the friendly old man from the next campsite.

I was surprised to see someone up before me, but I gladly accepted his offer.

Bill had been up since 11 PM the previous night! He explained that fishing in the dark made largemouth bass go wild for his slow-moving topwater plugs. Seeing my surprise, Bill showed me his cooler, filled with fresh green lunkers. Despite his humble demeanor, it was clear Bill was a master angler.

Bill and I fished similarly, though with different techniques. On New York’s St. Lawrence River, I used homemade bucktail jigs for northern pike, while Bill used wooden floaters for bass. Our retrieves were similar—wind the baitcaster, pause, and wait for the strike. This method worked well for both of us, especially during the pauses.

As a dedicated jig fisherman, my crank-and-pause technique works perfectly for using my new BIRD lure after dark. Bill’s advice comes to mind, especially during hot summers when I prefer the coolness of night fishing. He noted that lunker bass roam open water at night, away from their daytime hideouts. Modern BIRD lures, with their snagless design, make night fishing even more enjoyable.

**13 Tips for Night Fishing with the BIRD Lure:**

1. **Stay Away from Shoreline:** The BIRD casts far, so avoid casting into trees.
2. **Focus on Wingspan:** The stop-and-go motion creates a natural flapping pulse.
3. **Vary the Pace:** Short pops can create noise that attracts bass.
4. **Navigate Obstacles:** Use a slow, steady retrieve to climb over weeds and sticks.
5. **Take Breaks:** Longer pauses can be effective; enjoy a cup of coffee.
6. **Pause Before Lifting:** A brief pause before lifting the lure can surprise you with a catch.
7. **Use a Long Rod:** A longer rod helps cover more water.
8. **Power Hookset:** Crank down hard and use your body to set the hook.
9. **Quick Battle:** Don’t play the fish too long; unseen obstructions can be a hazard.
10. **Return to Hotspots:** Revisit areas where you saw activity but didn’t get strikes.
11. **Deep Water Casts:** Occasionally cast over deep water to intercept roaming lunkers.
12. **Nighttime Thrills:** Night fishing can be even more exciting than daytime; be prepared!
13. **Safety First:** Wear a life jacket and be cautious.

How long should you fish? As my pike fishing friend says, “You just have to keep on jigging!” The same goes for night fishing—keep your BIRD lure in the water you can learn more at bigbirdlures over at facebook",5,1732461582.0,FishingForBeginners,0,1.0,False

“While we value innovation and collaboration,” said CEO Barbara Whittington during a hastily called press conference, “the sheer amount of sexual activity occurring at this branch has surpassed even the most lenient interpretations of our employee handbook. It’s less of an office and more of a...well, let’s just say HR ran out of euphemisms back in March.”

The Bismarck branch first raised eyebrows last quarter when its performance review described it as “surprisingly unproductive, yet inexplicably happy.” While sales reports were abysmal and no one seemed to know how to attach a PDF to an email, employee engagement surveys reported unprecedented satisfaction, with comments such as, “I don’t even care what my salary is, honestly,” and, “This is hands-down the best place I’ve ever had sex with a co-worker in a unisex bathroom.”

Despite the branch’s infamous reputation, employees remain defiant. “I don’t see what the big deal is,” said Karen Delaney, a marketing associate who admitted to conducting “strategy meetings” in the janitor’s closet with her colleague Brad “just to talk about campaigns or whatever.” Brad could not be reached for comment, as he was reportedly occupied “in a team-building exercise” with two IT interns.

Sources confirm that even mundane office tasks have become intertwined with a flourishing underground hookup culture. Routine printer jams are resolved with extended shoulder massages, brainstorming sessions inevitably lead to candle-lit dinners, and the coffee break room has been unofficially dubbed “The Tinder Lounge.”

In an attempt to salvage the branch earlier this year, corporate installed security cameras, only for employees to treat the footage as “an accidental audition for The Bachelor: Corporate Edition.” HR also attempted to enforce a strict “no dating” policy, but enforcement faltered when the HR manager herself was found passionately making out with a regional director during a mandatory PowerPoint seminar.

Not everyone at the Bismarck branch is thrilled with its licentious culture. “I actually came here to work,” grumbled accounting assistant Dennis Probst, the lone employee without a romantic entanglement. “But every time I try to use the bathroom, there’s some kind of ‘staff appreciation’ happening in there. It’s gotten to the point where I’m afraid to open the supply closet because it might be a surprise engagement party.”

The branch is set to officially close its doors at the end of the month, but corporate isn’t giving up entirely on its employees. Brantley Corp announced plans to transfer most of the Bismarck staff to its Fargo branch, where the office culture is reportedly dominated by aggressive shouting matches delivered entirely through sports metaphors.",1,1732461387.0,theartificialonion,0,1.0,False

1gyszhh,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/1gyszhh/26_m4f_florida_online_cute_alt_nerd_boy_wants_to/,26 [M4F] Florida / Online - Cute alt nerd boy wants to make you smile :),"Heya reddit, I'm Grey! I'm a 26 year old guy from Florida, here looking for someone sweet to spend my days with:) 

If you're looking for someone to talk to about your day, or your hobbies, or your special interests, or the things that grind your gears, or just to babble about nonsense at nonsensical hours, you've come to the right place! I want someone I can share everything with, from thoughts to feelings to experiences to coffee. 

So a lil bit more about me, I work in retail management, it's not exactly a blast but it keeps me fed for the time being. Still searching for my true passion in life, although the exploration process is kind of fun in and of itself. I am neurodivergent and quite a goofball, and I tend to get a bit anxious from time to time. I am mostly introverted but I love going out with close friends. I am a pretty big Nintendo fan, and I would love to find someone who loves Pokémon as much as I do. Major points if you tell me who your favorite is in your message heh. I enjoy a variety of hobbies from gardening to baking to juggling. I adore animals and I have a very round cat. I am super into tattoos and piercings and have some of each. I have reeeeeally long hair.

Some of the things I value most in a person are kindness and empathy. If you're a sweetheart who loves seeing people feel happy, you should absolutely send me a message! I hope everyone has a great day, and thank you for taking the time to read my post!",1,1732460777.0,r4r,1,1.0,False
1gysxx6,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhentermineTopiramate/comments/1gysxx6/beginning_my_journey/,Beginning my journey,"Hi everyone! When I was exploring this option for weight loss with my doctor I saw people sharing their experiences on this thread and wanted to do the same. 

I am on day five of 37.5 mg of Phentermine and 25 mg of Topiramate twice a day (one with the Phentermine in the morning, one in the evening for a total of 50 mg of Topiramate total). I have lost 8 lbs so far. (5’7 SW: 208)

The first day I definitely experienced some side effects as I had my usual coffee and didn’t realize caffeine interacted with Phentermine (that was my bad, I have never been on any medication aside from birth control) and felt like I was just EXTREMELY caffeinated. After that happened I have since cut out my usual morning cup of coffee since. I have since experienced some light insomnia (waking up at 4AM), but I saw some folks in this thread suggested melatonin, and the Ritual brand Melatonin has really helped and I’ve been able to sleep a full night. I use an Oura ring to keep track of my sleep cycle so I can really see the difference. The nausea up until this point has been really bad, and I can feel some mild uptick in my irritability (mostly because I’ve been nauseous lol). I have had some short bursts of pins and needles in my left foot but nothing too major. I think maybe I have some minor brain fog too, but it’s not debilitating, it just feels like it takes me an extra minute for an extra cog to turn in my brain for a thought to come out. Overall I’m really pleased with the weight loss thus far and hope to keep the momentum up. ",1,1732460663.0,PhentermineTopiramate,0,1.0,False

## FAQ

**I live in Nicaragua/Canada/Cuba/USA, why are you posting on a Saturday?!**

Because I'm writing this from Europe in the future where it's already Sunday. Timezones be crazy.

**Why are there a bunch of non-board games in the board game list?**

Because the Tabletop games category on Kickstarter includes anything remotely related to board games and sometimes things slip through my filters.

**Why is this future award winning board game and literal saviour of humanity missing from your list?**

Sometimes my filters get a bit overzealous and discard actually valid projects. If you feel something is missing for this reason, leave a comment and I'll add it (maybe).

**Can I donate all my money to you?**

No

**Can you help me promote my game?**

Please no. I make lists. Nothing more.

**Your list is full of errors and now the Nigerian prince won't answer my emails anymore!**

Indeed, this fine piece of code runs purely on hope and dreams, so anything can happen. Leave a comment and I'll see what I can do.

1gysvxq,https://www.reddit.com/r/beginnerfitness/comments/1gysvxq/resting_contributed_to_weight_loss/,Resting contributed to weight loss?,"I, 35 F, have been consistently staying active and working out since spring of this year. For me, that looks like doing at least 10k steps a day, sprinkling in two weight training days a week (one day focus on lower body and one day on upper) and I do Pilates reformer once a week, which targets core and many other areas. I am still battling a few lasting symptoms of Long Covid so I try not to push myself too hard, especially with cardio. My diet is as well balanced as it can be (celiac and food allergies) with a focus on healthy carbs, protein and fiber. I almost only drink water, alternating days where I drink my mushroom coffee. I’d say I’m always in a mild calorie deficit but I don’t really track that.

Since my journey began, I’ve sat at 150lbs. I know that I’m getting more muscle because I can see and feel it, and definitely losing fat, but it doesn’t feel like a lot. But no matter how my body changes, the smart scale still says 150. Fast forward to this morning, I decided to weight myself because I hadn’t in a while, and imagine my surprise when the scale reads 147.3lbs. The only thing I’ve done differently this past week is… hardly work out. We had a major storm which caused us to lose power and interfered with my Tuesday workout, and then I ended up stuck in bed with a horrible headache pretty much from Friday until now. So I missed Pilates, have barely done any steps due to being bed bound, and didn’t workout at all. My diet didn’t really change, I maybe ate slightly less? Since I’ve been going to bed earlier to escape the pain from my head. But for the most part just ate like I normally do.

I thought it might be helpful to compile what I've learned to help others who are just starting their journey or feeling lost.Also credits to my GI Specialst, My Ayurveda diet consultant & my personal yoga coach for helping me in the journey

#  Here's what I've found:

# Most Common Symptoms

* Constant upper abdominal pain/burning (especially under left rib)
* Bloating and excessive burping
* Early satiety (feeling full after eating small amounts)
* Nausea (with or without vomiting)
* Sleep disruption during flares
* Anxiety and depression from chronic symptoms
* Back pain (especially on left side)
* Loss of appetite and food aversion
* Fatigue and brain fog

# Red Flags People Wish They'd Known Earlier 🚩

1. Ignoring symptoms and pushing through pain
2. Returning to normal diet too quickly after feeling better
3. Not taking stress management seriously enough
4. Relying solely on medication without lifestyle changes
5. Waiting too long to seek medical help
6. Not keeping a food/symptom diary from the start
7. Trying to exercise too intensely during healing

# The Treatment Timeline ⏳

* Month 1-2: Most people start with PPIs and strict diet
* Months 2-4: Some improvement but frequent setbacks
* Months 4-6: Learning their triggers and what works
* Months 6-12: Gradual improvement with consistent approach
* Beyond 12 months: Many report significant healing but need to maintain healthy habits

# Common Triggers People Report

1. Large meals
2. Stress/anxiety
3. Certain foods (especially spicy, acidic, or high FODMAP)
4. Eating too late at night
5. Alcohol
6. Coffee/caffeine
7. Not eating regularly enough

# Most Frequently Tried Treatments

* PPIs (Omeprazole, Pantoprazole being most common)
* H2 blockers (Famotidine/Pepcid)
* Sucralfate
* Low dose antidepressants (Amitriptyline, Mirtazapine)
* Probiotics
* Zinc Carnosine supplements
* Bland diet/Low FODMAP diet
* Small, frequent meals
* Stress reduction techniques

# Unusual Treatment Approaches People Swear By 💡

1. Slippery elm tea before meals
2. Chiropractic adjustments (especially for those with back pain)
3. Acupuncture for stress and pain management
4. Fresh cabbage juice
5. Specific breathing exercises before eating
6. Regular light yoga or gentle stretching
7. DGL licorice supplements
8. Meditation apps specifically for digestive health

# Common Questions/Concerns

1. ""How long until I get better?"" (Recovery times vary widely, from months to years)
2. ""Will I ever be normal again?"" (Many success stories show yes, but it takes time and dedication)
3. ""What does my endoscopy result mean?"" (Especially terms like chronic active gastritis, erosive gastritis)
4. ""Are my symptoms normal?"" (Wide variety of symptoms reported)
5. ""What can I eat?"" (Bland diet recommendations very common)

# What Actually Helped People Most

1. Strict dietary changes (even when feeling better)
2. Stress management (meditation, therapy, lifestyle changes)
3. Eating schedule (small, frequent meals)
4. Patience and acceptance (many mention mental health impact)
5. Finding the right medical support (Many needed to try multiple doctors)
6. Alternative therapies (some report success with acupuncture, chiropractic care)

# Key Takeaways

1. Recovery isn't linear - flares and setbacks are normal
2. What works for one person might not work for another
3. Mental health is heavily impacted and needs attention too
4. Consistency with treatment/diet is crucial
5. Many eventually recover but it takes longer than expected

I was surprised to see someone up before me, but I gladly accepted his offer.

Bill had been up since 11 PM the previous night! He explained that fishing in the dark made largemouth bass go wild for his slow-moving topwater plugs. Seeing my surprise, Bill showed me his cooler, filled with fresh green lunkers. Despite his humble demeanor, it was clear Bill was a master angler.

Bill and I fished similarly, though with different techniques. On New York’s St. Lawrence River, I used homemade bucktail jigs for northern pike, while Bill used wooden floaters for bass. Our retrieves were similar—wind the baitcaster, pause, and wait for the strike. This method worked well for both of us, especially during the pauses.

As a dedicated jig fisherman, my crank-and-pause technique works perfectly for using my new BIRD lure after dark. Bill’s advice comes to mind, especially during hot summers when I prefer the coolness of night fishing. He noted that lunker bass roam open water at night, away from their daytime hideouts. Modern BIRD lures, with their snagless design, make night fishing even more enjoyable. You can visit bigbirdlures at facebook. 

**13 Tips for Night Fishing with the BIRD Lure:**

1. **Stay Away from Shoreline:** The BIRD casts far, so avoid casting into trees.
2. **Focus on Wingspan:** The stop-and-go motion creates a natural flapping pulse.
3. **Vary the Pace:** Short pops can create noise that attracts bass.
4. **Navigate Obstacles:** Use a slow, steady retrieve to climb over weeds and sticks.
5. **Take Breaks:** Longer pauses can be effective; enjoy a cup of coffee.
6. **Pause Before Lifting:** A brief pause before lifting the lure can surprise you with a catch.
7. **Use a Long Rod:** A longer rod helps cover more water.
8. **Power Hookset:** Crank down hard and use your body to set the hook.
9. **Quick Battle:** Don’t play the fish too long; unseen obstructions can be a hazard.
10. **Return to Hotspots:** Revisit areas where you saw activity but didn’t get strikes.
11. **Deep Water Casts:** Occasionally cast over deep water to intercept roaming lunkers.
12. **Nighttime Thrills:** Night fishing can be even more exciting than daytime; be prepared!
13. **Safety First:** Wear a life jacket and be cautious.

How long should you fish? As my pike fishing friend says, “You just have to keep on jigging!” The same goes for night fishing—keep your BIRD lure in the water",0,1732460262.0,Fishing_Gear,0,0.5,False

He replied that he was flattered but that his life is a shit show and he’s not really in a position to offer anything to anyone else rn. I was bummed but understood. 

I guess since then I’ve been struggling with how to act towards him and then how to take care of myself. I’ve tried to act as normal as possible like nothing happened but I can’t help but think maybe something shifted. 

It might sound dumb but he used to always be the first one to like and comment on all my stories and I’ve noticed a significant dropoff there. 

Last weekend I messaged him because I was going to be in his neighborhood so I said if he wanted to go for a walk/get a coffee or something that could be nice. 

He ended up already having plans but overall his response was positive; he showed interest in what i was doing and told me about what he’d been up to. He was at an event that he thought i’d be into and said we should check it out sometime together. 

I guess now I feel that the ball is in his court and I’ve been trying to just move on mentally and focus on other things which has been going well. I actually muted his stories just to give myself some space but hope it hasn’t come across as passive aggressive or something. 

Part of me think it’s just a brain chemical thing that I’m struggling to regulate now that I don’t have the excitement of this crush. Phew. Any tips?",2,1732460180.0,Advice,4,1.0,False

My ex hated cats, used to say cats are false, smelling and good for to be shred into sausages only.
One of the first things I did after divorce was to make a reservation for two kittens at an old-lines breeder.
He had only boys, I picked up the silver tabby white and red tabby white, named  them Cyril and Metod (Methodius) - as the original saints were Apostles to the Slavs, my cats are Apawstles to the Meows.
Later I got white deaf kitty who could not be kept at the breeder. Het family name is Mia.
No. 4 is a tortoiseshell girl from Prague... very unplanned... I fell in love with her photos and decided to buy her only from love for the first sight. Named her Sissi.
All of them are very calm and well-behaving, thoug completely different nature.
Silver boy is a very shy one, though after he gets to know the human better, he is very cuddly. But only on a lap. Hates to be picked up. His fur is sleek and silky. I use him as a tester for people - those who he accepts and does not hide from are always the best in heart.
Coffee latte boy is the biggest softest fluff ball. Absolute flegmatic, though passionate and showing most of affection to me. In night he sleeps near my head. He loves to be worn in my arms... weighing almost 10 kgs.
Deaf white girl is the most patient one and best companion for my autistic son. She does not care whether he screams or makes a noise
noise.. she loves to be held and cuddled.
Tortie girl is the smallest, though the smartest one. Best athlete of those. She can reach impossible places. She loves to accompany me at the toilet, sometimes fell asleep on my lap and then I am sorry to wake her up.

	•	Adding more cardio or overworking your body?
	•	Ignoring your need for stress relief or recovery?
I get it—you’ve been doing what you thought was right. But the truth is, those solutions are only making the problem worse. I’ve helped people like you rebuild their energy naturally and sustainably, and I can help you too.:

","So as the title suggests:

I pull an empty shot in the basket only water to get the pipes hot, as I've read it's a good idea to get the temperatures up within the machine. I use a DF54 grinder. I grind at level 19. 36 grams took 50-55 seconds. Right after I pull a second shot for next cup of coffee for a guest for example, using the exact same weight (18 grams in) - grind on level 19, I pre infuse also both shots for 10 seconds. This shot spills everywhere and gets 36 grams out in like 15-20 seconds.

So I tried to re adjust the grinder to level 15, because the second shot came out way too fast. Now the shot is 18g in and 36 grams out around 25-30 seconds out as I want it.

If I wait a couple of hours, same thing occurs if I try at grind level 15. First shot takes up to a minute to get out 36 grams out. Second shot now runs as it should or still a bit too fast. The inconsistency is crazy, using same beans and weighing in 18 grams exactly every time.

So right now, I need to grind way coarser on the first shot than on the second shot, using the same beans, if I want consistent results which is quite annoying.

For both shots I use:

Such illness meant that we were unfortunately unable to go on the first ""roadtrip"" that was planned for yesterday - a 300ish mile round trip to sunny Alston for a friend's 40th.

This was a blessing in disguise as the m74 and M6 seemed pretty jumped with the weather.

We've hardly been over the threshold this week, but I did get a chance to sort a small cold weather test on Thursday: 

4.3 m/kWh

This was dootering round town in the dark. Pretty pleased with that and content that the 12v battery obviously got a boost whilst the car was charging - it started fine.

I'll still buy a new one on payday I think.



Today we made it out for coffee and cake before doing some food shopping - saw a bit of an improvement in economy in the warmer weather: 4.5m/kWh

TL:DR

Was ill, couldn't roadtrip, however cold weather economy seems fine.

I've got MBA 13 and Ipad Pro 11 M1. I want to extend iPad cabalities by adding a keyboard to it (magic keyboard or logitech combo), but i realized iPad with a keyboard is loosing its portability and becomes quite heavy and the difference between MBA and iPad is blurring when it comes to portability.

I want to use my iPad with keyboard to quickly get this and sit down in the coffee shop, library or simply do what i need while having it on my laps. It will be used for study, making some notes (hand-written), writing some articles/book with a keyboard for convenience, responding to some mails or reading a book. I don't want to replace entirely my MBA, because it's not possible in my opinion based what I use MBA for.

I was wondering if switching to Ipad mini would make sense for the purpose mentioned above. 2 years ago I selected Ipad 11 pro over Ipad mini because making hand-written notes were uncomfortable to me due to its size and i couldn't lay my hand on a screen, but now i started thinking about it again, because i'm not using the full potential of Ipad Pro and my idea for using an iPad has changed (previously i had an idea to use it most of the time for hand-written notes).

Is there anybody who uses ipad mini for the purpose I've mentioned?

After a loooong academic grind and enough group projects to last a lifetime, I’m venturing into this digital jungle to find someone cool, witty, and seriously fun.

If you’re looking for a girl who’s short hair chinita with glasses —yeah, that’s not me. I’m 5’0”, not gym-obsessed but play sports. So, if height’s your non-negotiable, feel free to scroll; no hard feelings! 😊

**Let’s start with my potential red flags (because honesty is the key):**

* I have a habit of saying “one more episode” during study breaks and suddenly it's 3 AM
* Always says “kaya pa yan” even if sabog na sa workload.
* Walang masyadong time cause gradwaiting student

**BUT, if you can overlook those, you get these:**

* 4th-year student surviving thesis season with equal parts caffeine and blind optimism. Balancing academics, org responsibilities, and the occasional breakdown (*but make it productive*).
* Loves playing badminton
* Deep-diving into random reels/videos, and bingeing K-dramas when I should be studying.
* I never say no to pasta or coffee.
* I’ll adore your dog and even *try* to befriend your moody cat
* Let’s explore random cafes and decide if the ₱300 coffee was worth it.
* 🐯


**What I’m looking for in you:**

* Around my age (21–26) so that we can keep it relatable.
* Location: Metro Manila (preferably Manila or QC kasi proximity is life).
* Personality: Fun, matured, may sariling goals and willing to match my energy in convos. 
* Please be politically aware. If you voted for BBM, swipe left (or scroll down, in Reddit terms).

**How to apply (wow, parang job post):**

* Send me a short intro! Tell me about yourself, your vibe, and your go-to comfort food.

If this sounds like a vibe, send me a message! Let’s start as friendly strangers and see if we can turn into something much coo",0,1732458457.0,PhR4Dating,3,0.5,False

It's happened to him a lot over the years to varying degrees.

One of the easiest grifts in the world has to be to have some kind of product or talent to grift and then to ingratiate yourself into the bear community and then push your product or talent on all of the cultist plebs. Although I'm not sure how well it would work nowadays with his dwindling audience but it was a slam dunk grift a couple of years ago that a lot of people were smart enough to tap into. In some ways I suppose it helped Owen too because it allowed him to point to something to lend credence to the idea that they're all a community there to help each other. Whether it was one using Owen as a stepping stone to launch ones cartoons to ones merely private labeling things like wholesale coffee to mark up to gourmet prices, there was an opportunity for all kinds.

Those are somewhat victimless grifts but then there's the snakes who ingratiate themselves into Owen's inner circle. They spot Owen as a mark from mile away with dollar signs in their eyes. There's the obvious examples, the Nimmer's, The Jim-Bob's (clearly saw Owen as invaluable stepping stone to promote his drawings) and dare I say even Adam Camacho? I realize the line of thinking of the ""enemy of my enemy is my friend"", but I'm not so sure he wasn't an unsavory character himself. Hell and then there's even Coddington who has somehow convinced him to cough up HALF of his superchat income which is just insanity. For any good streamer, the superchats are the bread and the butter of the income... Despite all of those various cretins, there remains the puppet master...

I don't know if it's just me, but I suspect there's something really shady going on with this Sam character. At the very least, he saw Owen as a financial opportunity that he could hitch his wagon to to extract as much money as possible. Didn't the guy even move from out of state to live near Owen? Seems pretty suss for a grown man to do. What exactly is he getting out of this partnership that could justify such life altering decisions?

The one thing Owen has going for him is that he's independent and should be able to self manage himself. I mean Hell, the guy doesn't even gig or tour or anything so why exactly does he need a handler? Camacho revealed in an interview that all these Beartaria Apps and Beartaria Fest and these beef cattle businesses were all the vision and work of Sam. It's like he's trying to be the mogul behind marketing the \*brand\* of Owen Benjamin and turning it into some wide ranging business empire but it's an unsustainable vision. Owen's bread and butter is his comedy and his podcasting and he really shouldn't be anchoring himself to all of this other nonsense. 5-10 years from now when he's over the dumb idea of this Beartaria stuff, he's still going to be on the hook for having to live up to offering ***something*** for the insane amount of money that he raised off of these people. it's a 110 acre millstone around his neck that is dragging him down that he won't be able to escape from.

Just watching his podcasts lately, he already seems to be over it all. There seems to be some issues brewing behind the scenes. I see a lot of these ""edgy"" stand up comedians on Twitter who are amassing huge followings over the last couple of years. If Owen had any sense, he would hook up with a few of the more prominent ones,  team up with them to go on a tour and reconnect with the audience to then win over more viewers for the podcast. He seems to be getting way in over his head with all sorts of nonsense that isn't even in his wheelhouse. He's gotta rid himself of these parasites who are taking advantage of him.

1gyrty0,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringResumes/comments/1gyrty0/student_phd_student_preparing_a_cv_for_research/,[Student] PhD student preparing a CV for research positions in industry,"Hello!

First of all, thank you so much for this sub! The wiki has been incredibly helpful as I worked on the first draft of my CV. I am now looking for feedback to improve it further.

I am a final-year PhD student specializing in machine learning, and I am gradually preparing for my job search. I am looking for research scientist positions in private companies, such as Huawei, Google, or more specialized firms. Since I work in a very niche subfield of machine learning, I aim companies that hire researchers in my area of expertise.

I haven’t settled on a specific country yet, though I am particularly interested in Switzerland, the USA, Canada, and Singapore, among others. I’m quite flexible, so my decision will ultimately depend on the opportunities available.

**Some notes about the CV structure:**

* I know skills are typically listed at the end, but given the specificity of my field, I feel that including these keywords early on might help non-expert recruiters quickly identify that I match the role.
* I’ve tried to apply the XYZ method, but I don’t have quantitative results easily understandable by non-experts. So I am not sure if I should include them.

**A few questions:**

1. What are your thoughts on the highlights section? I included it to emphasize the achievements I’m most proud of, but I don’t see this section in many CVs.
2. Should I add a research objective section?
3. Should I include a link to my Google Scholar profile?
4. Do you think using an email provider like ProtonMail might create bias?

Thank you in advance for your time and input! I’m happy to provide additional context if needed.

A massive thank you to everyone on this thread! It was my first time visiting this part of the world so I was a bit nervous. All the advice and tips on this thread have been incredibly helpful to me. And a special thank you to everyone who also responded back to my questions directly - either in the forum or via DMs. 

I've made a little travel highlight video - enjoy and give it a watch with sound! Music: Full Sail by Ryan Farish.

I (M29) did this trip solo and I had an incredible time! It was exciting, serene, and I felt like I was immersed in nature - rain and cloud forests, volcanoes, beaches, waterfalls, wildlife. This is exactly what I wanted. 

**TL;DR**  

I had an incredible time in Costa Rica for almost three weeks being immersed in nature. I went to Manuel Antonio (MA National Park, Espadilla Beach, Damas Island Mangrove tour), Monteverde (**El Tigre Waterfalls**, **Selvatura Park**, Monteverde Cloud Forest), La Fortuna (Cano Negro Wildlife tour, **Rio Celeste hike**), Puerto Viejo (Punta Uva, Ara Manzanillo), and San Jose (general city exploring). I've ""bolded"" my top 3 memorable experiences. I pre-booked every activity. I used Interbus to move between key locations and they were fantastic. I easily used Uber in San Jose and somewhat easily in Manuel Antonio/Quepos. I almost exclusively used Apple Pay on my iPhone to pay for things. I used colones when I needed an official taxi. I took out around 50,000 colones which was more than enough for me for the trip. It did rain but for me it added to the whole experience. You need a decent pair of shoes. I used an Airalo e-sim, which was easy to set up and I had no issues with connectivity. Food was more expensive than I thought it was going to be and the food overall is okay/neutral. 

**Trip overview**  

I travelled from London to San Jose. Not including travel/transfer days, I did:

* 3 full days in Manuel Antonio
* 3 full days in Monteverde 
* 2 full days in La Fortuna 
* 3 full days in Puerto Viejo 
* 2 full days in San Jose 

For anyone travelling  London-San Jose, just to flag that the schedule says the flights take around 11h 45mins, but in reality each leg was only around 9h 30mins or so. British Airways catering is not good, so pack snacks.

**Weather** 

Firstly, I’m sorry for all the impact the recent weather has had for Costa Ricans and tourists. I hope things have started to improve for all - or hopefully will start to very soon.   

It is something which I fortunately did not get caught up in. Thanks to advice from Reddit, I did all my main activities in the morning - I was usually out the door by 0730. It did sometimes rain in the morning, but it was completely manageable with a raincoat and/or umbrella *and* waterproof shoes (more on footwear below). 

Personally the rain, even when it downpoured, added to the whole experience for me. There was something really magical about me, for example, being the only person on a hanging bridge, listening to the sounds of the rainforest, and hearing the rain. During a lot of the hikes, it was also very humid so I appreciated the rain in these instances. And everything did look spectacularly green and lush and all the waterfalls were mighty. 

If/when there was a prolonged downpour in the afternoon, I was usually inside - an activity, having a nap, eating (at a restaurant, cafe, hotel), reading a book, etc. Because I luckily stayed in good locations, these downpours did not stop me from walking 1 or 2 mins (with a raincoat and umbrella) to a shop or restaurant. 

**Hiking shoes**

I want to especially stress the importance of having a decent pair of shoes. I think after passport and money, footwear is perhaps the third most important thing! I used these Columbia Trailstorm Ascend hiking[ shoes](https://www.tradeinn.com/trekkinn/en/columbia-trailstorm--ascend-hiking-shoes/140985595/p?tqw=9.5&_gl=1*1x00qv6*_up*MQ..&gclid=CjwKCAjw1NK4BhAwEiwAVUHPUMcP1U5Ef49Kq5BtZhU5fRySmaNk1GROv6r1vKG5ZWnhYu2StrSQ5hoCpXIQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds&gbraid=0AAAAADt53Ngjb6raVPKJuN-m6Yuptrf6J) (which I got for £52 on sale!). I put them through a lot and they kept me dry and comfortable and they held up impressively well. 

**E-SIM**

I bought and installed an Airalo ESIM before I travelled to Costa Rica. Really easy to set up and to switch on when in-country. It uses the Liberty network. I had no issue with using data or making calls! The ESIM was £37, valid for 30 days, 20gb data, 200 mins, 200 texts, local number. Grand!

**Travel in Costa Rica** 

I used Interbus to move between key locations. They were fantastic! Every shuttle was on time, clean, and had free wifi. Drivers were helpful and friendly. The shuttle from San Jose to Manuel Antonio had me as the only passenger - and I am very grateful that they did not cancel this.

I personally would have liked Interbus on the morning of travel to (re)confirm via WhatsApp the pick-up. However, I quickly got into the mindset of “if they have not said anything, assume it is still going ahead” which worked! 

It of course takes longer than driving by yourself as you are picking up and dropping off other passengers and there are also rest breaks along the way, but these two things did not bother me and I appreciated the rest breaks.

I used Uber easily in San Jose and somewhat easily in Manuel Antonio/Quepos. Restaurants and shops were within walking distance from my hotel in Monteverde - activity providers can usually organise pick up/drop off (may include an additional charge), your hotel can organise transport, or you can always ask someone to ring you an official taxi. I did all three in Monteverde. Similar situation in La Fortuna. I was in a somewhat isolated location in Puerto Viejo, so I used tuk-tuks to get around - ask your hotel for recommendations, get the driver’s number, and then just organise through them directly. 

I booked all my transfers with Interbus directly via email ahead of flying to Costa Rica. And because I did multiple bookings with them, they kindly gave me some discounted fares for some trips - every bit of saving helps, which leads me onto my next point… 

**Money** 

I used Apple Pay on my iPhone for everything (shops, restaurants, hotel bill) except when using the official taxis or tuk-tuks (in Puerto Viejo), which I paid for in colones. If you’re from the UK - use Monzo for travel if you are not already: it’s straightforward and there are no charges involved. 

I only took out about 50,000 colones. And that was fine for my trip. I had some money left over which I used to buy some last minute gifts at the airport.  

I personally found food to be much more expensive than I thought it was going to be - and a higher price does not mean that it will actually taste particularly great. Just on food, it was okay. Overall, there’s nothing really to write home about - but I expected this as it’s frequently mentioned in this forum. 

On tipping, and without igniting any aggressive cultural debates, I followed the same approach as I do in the UK: the service charge is the gratuity. If I feel like I want to give more as a cash tip because of a particularly great service, then I will do. 

**Hotels**

I stayed in the following hotels: Park Inn by Radisson (San Jose), Karahe Beach Hotel (Manuel Antonio), Camino Verde Bed and Breakfast (Monteverde), La Fortuna Lodge (La Fortuna), AwA Beach Hotel (Puerto Viejo), Bee Suites Escalante (San Jose). Happy to answer any questions from anyone. I found staff at each hotel incredibly warm, welcoming and helpful. 

Highlight: Camino Verde B&B - the location, room, staff, hospitality, price: Awesome! I also really enjoyed staying in the studio apartment in Bee Suites Escalante in San Jose. I strongly recommend both. I would happily stay in both again. 

Meh: AwA Beach Hotel. The hotel is beautiful, the staff are great, and you are staying essentially on Punta Uva. However, I think this is way overpriced and not worth the money. For the price they charged, I personally noticed the following things which dented my experience and which I would expect to be of better quality: The sound proofing in the room is not great and there is no TV; the showers are not powerful enough and the bathroom had an odd, drain-type smell; the food at the restaurant was not great and had limited options. Other than the excellent coffee and fresh juices, the breakfast was average to poor. The food you order from the menu has odd portion combinations on the plate. But the real problem is the self-serve buffet which had loads of flies and other insects swarming over it. Not ideal. The location, design, and genuinely lovely staff is what lessens the sting from the overall experience. 

**Manuel Antonio**

I really enjoyed exploring/hiking in Manuel Antonio National Park - the easier trails had a larger number of tourists, but the harder trails which take you deeper (and at much steeper inclines) into the Park were more quiet. I was staying right near Espadilla Beach, which is an awesome beach. Most mornings I felt like I had it to myself and even at its most busiest, it didn’t feel that busy. I did[ this](https://www.viator.com/tours/Costa-Rica/Mangrove-Boat-Tour-Damas-Island-Manuel-Antonio/d4507-70025P4) Damas Island Mangrove Boat Tour, which includes pick up and drop off and a really tasty buffet lunch at the end at a local restaurant. The tour guide (Joseph) was super cool, knowledgeable and really easy to get along with. We saw capuchin monkeys REALLY up close, lots of iguanas, birds. I also just really enjoyed  touring/seeing this type of ecosystem. I would do it again!

Just to note, I did not find the area where I was staying “walkable” at all - it’s very, very hilly. 

**Monteverde** 

I truly had a fantastic time in Monteverde. You really are amongst the clouds! I did the[ El Tigre Waterfalls hike](https://www.eltigrewaterfalls.com/) \- it was incredible, one of the most memorable things I did, and it felt like a proper adventure with the hike/surroundings, the waterfalls, rivers/streams, and wooden hanging bridges. I booked the “full package” and I highly recommend it. I was grateful for the 4x4 drive at the end, and lunch was super tasty. I also had a lot of fun at Selvatura Park; I booked the[ emerald package](https://selvatura.com/packages/emerald-pack/) which includes the treetop canopy walk, sloth sanctuary, and butterfly garden. On the last day, I went to the monteverde cloud forest. It was a nice morning hike - it wasn’t as exciting as the previous two activities, but of course just appreciating and experiencing the uniqueness of the ecosystem you’re walking in is still worthy in and of itself. I strongly recommend the hummingbird cafe which is right next to the park. The hot chocolate is tasty and of course seeing hummingbirds zipping around is wonderful.  Please be aware of the coatis outside - one rather aggressively took and scoffed down my cake slice right in front of me! 

**La Fortuna**

A really great little town, which is easily walkable. I’ve seen all the pictures, but I was still in awe the first time I saw Arenal Volcano. I had no idea it was SO visible from the town IRL,  and I had an excellent view of it from my hotel. I did the Cano Negro Wildfire Refuge Tour - it was okay, and a good lunch at the end. A highlight of this was seeing orange howler monkeys (which are usually black), which are considered to be rare. Our guide told us there’s only three in Costa Rica, and that they are orange because of a genetic mutation. According to google, they could also possibly (and more sadly) be orange because of chemicals from nearby plantations. If you happen to have a free day and want something to do, then sure give it a shot, but it’s not something I would recommend you prioritise. 

An experience that I think will stay with me for life: the[ Rio Celeste](https://www.viator.com/tours/Costa-Rica/Rio-Celeste-Full-Day-Tour-From-La-Fortuna/d821-18265P3) hike. WOW! It honestly felt like I was in an enchanted forest in a Disney movie. I found the hike to be quite hard, but doable with water and rest stops. It is a trail, not a loop, and the return is much easier. I did a tour which includes pick up and drop off from La Fortuna, lunch at the end, and my tour guide and group were great. STRONGLY RECOMMEND! 

I wish I did one more full day on La Fortuna and another tour, or even just exploring the town itself and sitting myself down with a book and taking in the view of Arenal Volcano.  I skipped the La Fortuna waterfall after the incredible waterfalls at El Tigre and Rio Celeste, so I don’t feel like I missed out. 

**Puerto Viejo** 

All I wanted from this leg of the trip is to enjoy the sun, sit on a beach, read my book, and look at the blue waters of the Caribbean sea. And that’s what I got thanks to staying so close to Punta Uva! Considering this is all I wanted from this part of the trip, I should have reduced this from three full days to two, and used the extra day at La Fortuna. 

It was really hot the whole time, and I was getting chewed out by mosquitos, so hiking in Cahuita National Park did not appeal to me. But maybe I should have powered through! 

I visited[ Ara Manzanillo](https://aramanzanillo.org/), which I posted about on Reddit[ here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CostaRicaTravel/comments/1gsalw8/beauty_of_the_great_green_macaw/). Please do visit and support this organisation if you can. There’s also a lively town centre, with lots of shops and restaurants, and lots of other activities you can do - speak to your hotel or check out a website like Viator. 

**San Jose** 

I spent two full days in San Jose. I think you can get away with one, definitely no more than two. My top three highlights: Drinking coffee from Edificio Steinvorth (I’m afraid I can’t remember the exact store; I also bought loads of yummy artisanal chocolate bars from La Casa del Cacao, which is located here); enjoying the sun and reading my book at Sabana Park; and soaking up the city and people-watching in many of the other, smaller urban parks in San Jose.
