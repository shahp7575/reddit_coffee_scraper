I'm wrapping up my applications for internal and external transfer for target schools right now. I have a good GPA, involved in IB club workshops, coffee chatting business students at my school, but no relevant finance experience at all. 

Is it realistic to look for regional boutique non-paid IB intern positions for this summer, or is it too late? Especially since I'm non-target. If I can't, I'm definitely looking towards a search fund internship, but I heard it can be difficult to get any practice doing pitches/modeling/research beyond cold-emailing and busy work at most firms.

1r1nf9b,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1r1nf9b/should_i_just_be_underemployed/,Should I just be underemployed?,"Long story short, a c-suite person at the company I've been working at for nearly a decade met with me a month ago to encourage me to apply for a new role that was ""perfect for me... aligned with my growth... trust us."" I held onto some hope and took the confidence to heart, only to learn I didn't get the job.

Further, after being effectively demoted, I was asked how they could help me grow, along with a smattering of compliments that I had to physically try to not start crying during due to the complete ridiculousness of it all. To say I was confused, especially after not receiving constructive feedback,  is an understatement. I acknowledge maybe I just wasn't the one, but I feel they made a mistake and weren't accountable by setting me up like that. We even met in public, which was humiliating, and I feel they did this because they thought it wouldn't make me emotional.

My ask is this... How many of you are or have chosen in the past to be underemployed, but happy? Some days the idea of being a cashier again or slinging coffee beans just makes me feel that maybe it's the mental break I need. Corporate is basically heartless, and I've learned that the further away you get from the frontline and the higher your salary gets, the less connected you are to the real human life you are impacting. I don't even know if I want that, at this point. I know it would be a significant pay cut, but the emotional toll this has taken on me has shown me how much my job impacts me, and I don't like it. 

Cashiering and slingin' beans has its hard days :) I've done both! But just... I feel like my mental load just needs an effing break. Do I keep my head down and work (which I will no-doubt be called out for somehow)? or do I move on?",1,1770783532.0,jobs,0,1.0,False

It’s been about 3–4 months since finishing antibiotics. I’ve been trying supplements I’ve seen mentioned here (Atrantil, a motility supplement, berberine). I do feel better overall and I’m going slightly more often, but I still have lingering burping and acid reflux that never fully went away.

So basically she gets jealous easily and I ended up removing a lot of girls from Snapchat. She is one of the only 3 girls in her class and a lot of guys want to hit on her. One of her classmates (who we will call Jeff) fell in love with her and got emotionally attracted to her after she comforted him and saved him from suicide after his breakup with his ex. 

Every tuesday my girlfriend doesn't attend first class (which starts at 7:30AM-8:15AM) so she goes to the nearby coffee shop to wait out. Last week she was alone and Jeff came to her and asked her if he can sit with her and have a coffee. She told me about it and how they talked about his breakup or feelings for his ex and I was okay with it.

Yesterday I went to the same coffee shop and saw them together. She was laughing the entire time because he was being silly. She never looked at her phone because she believed I was in school so I felt invisible. 

I told her that I don't like that she is seeing him because he has feelings for her. But she called me jealous. I know she isn't in love with him but it still feels wrong to give him attention.

She is telling me how she informed me that she will be with him but then states how he again simply came by random.

1r1nbit,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r1nbit,"We've been building a companion collector RPG that lives in Discord AND a full web portal, the pre-beta is now live and we'd love your honest feedback","After months of late nights and way too much coffee, we're finally ready to let people poke around what we've been building. **AstroPals** is a play-to-earn game where you collect, customize, and battle with companions, and it runs in two places: a Discord bot and a full web portal at [astropals.com](https://astropals.com).

We're calling this a **pre-beta** because that's exactly what it is. It's early. Things will break. But the core is there and playable, and we genuinely want people kicking the tires and telling us what works and what doesn't.

# What is AstroPals?

At its heart, it's a companion collector with RPG mechanics. You build Pals, battle them, explore, and collect. What makes it a little different is the hybrid setup, the Discord bot handles a lot of the social and quick-play stuff, while the web portal at [astropals.com](http://astropals.com) gives you the full experience with profiles, visual builders, leaderboards, and a bunch of game modes we're rolling out.

Think of the Discord bot as your pocket version and the web portal as the full console experience.

# What's playable right now

Here's what you can actually do today on the web portal:

* **Custom Pal Builder** (mashing) — This is the big one. A full layer-based character creator with 11 categories (backgrounds, hair, tops, bottoms, eyes, hats, hand items, FX effects). You build your Pal visually and it generates a composite image. It's weirdly addicting.
* **Player profiles** with stats and collections
* **Pal Parade** — Community showcase events where players build custom Pals around a theme and submit them. Think of it like a fashion show for your creatures. More on this below.
* **Arena leaderboards**, transaction history, relic gallery, inventory, and shop
* Discord OAuth login, fully mobile responsive

And there's a lot more in the pipeline that's coming soon, holographic card effects, a cosmic fishing mini-game, a roguelike dungeon crawler called Portal Run, anonymous drift bottle messaging, and a lore journaling system. We're not short on ideas, just short on hours in the day.

# Got any GiftedOcean NFTs? Here's how to bring them into the game

**This part is completely optional.** You do not need a wallet or any NFTs to play AstroPals — the full game is free to play without them. But if you have any GO NFTs, you can link them to your account and actually use them in-game as playable Pals.

**A quick note on the collection:** The full Gifted Ocean NFT collection isn't available in-game just yet, we're still in pre-beta, after all. We plan to include the full collection over time, along with some new exclusive drops and artist collaborations. More details on that as we get closer, but we wanted to be upfront about where things stand right now.

**Currently available GiftedOcean NFT Pals (28):**

Heavens Hand, Obsidian, Apex, Sovereign, Sol & Moons, Liana & Pearl, Kazan & Chars, The Kraken, Kami Supreme, Breeze & Pollen Pixie, Four, Kumo, Nori, Eyemancer, Electric Symphony, Moon, Antic, All Creator, Six, #58, #57, Vega, Heli, Cosmic x Council, Kid Drac, Eira, Planet Eater, and Hoof.

The whole process takes about a minute and you only have to do it once per wallet. Here's how it works:

1. **Log in** — Go to [astropals.com](http://astropals.com) and sign in with your Discord account.
2. **Go to Settings > Connections** — Open the Settings page and click on the ""Connections"" tab. This is where all your wallet management happens.
3. **Add your wallet** — Click the button to add a new wallet, paste in your Polygon wallet address, and hit connect. You can connect up to 3 wallets.
4. **Choose a verification method** — After connecting, pick one of the supported platforms to prove you own the wallet:
   * **OpenSea** — Paste a verification code into your OpenSea profile bio
   * **LooksRare** — Paste the code into your LooksRare profile bio
   * **SuperRare** — Paste the code into your SuperRare profile bio
   * **DECA** — Paste the code into your DECA profile bio
   * **Nifty Gateway** — Paste the code into your Nifty Gateway profile bio
   * **Reddit** — Enter your Reddit username and verify through your Reddit profile description
5. **Get your code & verify** — The site generates a unique verification code for you (you can copy it with one click). Paste that code into your chosen platform's profile bio, then come back and click ""Verify."" The system checks your bio for the code and confirms ownership.
6. **Sync your NFTs** — Once verified, hit the ""Sync NFTs"" button right there on the Connections page. It scans all your verified wallets and pulls in your NFTs automatically. You'll see a count of how many were found.
7. **You're done!** — Your NFT Pals are now in your account. Set one as your ally, customize it in the Pal Builder, enter Parades, and battle.

A few things worth noting:

* **It's secure.** The bot never asks for private keys, seed phrases, or signing permissions. All wallet interactions happen through ephemeral messages, meaning only you can see your wallet info. Nobody else in the server sees any of it.
* **Verification is one-time** per wallet. Once it's done, it's done.
* **You can re-sync anytime** to pick up new Allies you've acquired since your last sync.
* **Up to 3 wallets** per account, all on the Polygon blockchain.

And just to repeat because this is important: **connecting a wallet is not required to play.** It's a bonus for people who already have NFTs and want to bring them into the game. Everyone else can jump in and play for free without ever touching a wallet.

# The First Pal Parade is live RIGHT NOW

To celebrate the pre-beta going live, we're running the very first Parade:

**""Welcome to the Stars — First Steps Parade""**

No theme restrictions. No pressure. Just build your first custom Pal and show us your style. **Every single person who submits gets 500 coins.** That's it. No catch, no lottery — you enter, you get coins.

**How to join:**

1. Go to [astropals.com](https://astropals.com)
2. Log in with Discord
3. Head to Parade
4. Build your Pal
5. Submit

That's it. Takes a few minutes and it's genuinely fun to mess around with the builder.

# What we're looking for

Brutal honesty, basically. This is a pre-beta and we want to hear:

* First impressions — does the portal make sense? Is it intuitive?
* Bugs — if something breaks, we want to know
* What excites you and what doesn't
* Feature ideas or things you wish existed
* Performance issues, especially on mobile

We're a small indie team and community feedback is how this thing gets better. We're not looking for hype, we're looking for people who want to help shape something from the ground up.

# Links

* **Web Portal:** [astropals.com](https://astropals.com)
* **Discord:** [https://discord.gg/mmHCkRRs](https://discord.gg/mmHCkRRs)

It's **free to play and free to try**. You just need a Discord account to log in.

**TL;DR:** AstroPals is a companion collector RPG with a Discord bot + full web portal. The pre-beta is live at [astropals.com](https://astropals.com). You can build custom Pals, check out profiles and leaderboards, and enter the first-ever Pal Parade for 500 free coins just for participating. Got GO NFTs? You can optionally link your wallet and bring them into the game as playable Pals (28 currently available, full collection coming soon along with new exclusive drops and artist collabs) no private keys or signing required, fully secure. It's early, it's free, and we want your feedback. Come break stuff with us.",9,1770783214.0,GiftedSaga,0,0.92,False

I compiled everything into a dataset, which includes the top dicussed 25 machines, 15 grinders, specs, real street prices, community sentiment, what people recommend upgrading to, common complaints, all of it.

2 interesting analysis came out of it!

I mapped the upgrade path the community recommends for every machine in the dataset. 9 out of 25 end up pointing to the lelit bianca, doesn't matter if you start at $400 or $1,600 the sub keeps funneling people to the same destination. Only 3 machines are considered ""this is it, stop buying stuff"" (decent DE1, flair 58, profitec pro 700 with flow control).

**What does an espresso setup ACTUALLY cost when you add the grinder this sub recommends with it?**

Everyone focuses on machine price but the community has pretty strong opinions about which grinder you need with each machine. When you add those together the picture changes a lot, the cheapest ""good"" combo is $466 (solis + timemore) and the most expensive is $6,637 (linea mini + lagom/weber)

Some of the most environmentally conscious decisions individuals make on a daily basis are related to where and how they choose to dine.

The Green Dining Alliance (GDA) is a year-round restaurant sustainability certification program of earthday365 in St. Louis, in which partner restaurants work to reduce their environmental impact through on-site audits and mentorship programs. Many of St. Louis’ most iconic restaurants and coffee shops, including Blueberry Hill and Salt & Smoke on the Delmar Loop, are members of the GDA.

The Student Sustainability Board (SSB) is passionate about informing and connecting the WashU community with St. Louis’ GDA restaurants as part of our organization’s green dining initiatives. This Civic Action Week event will take place on WashU’s Danforth Campus, and will consist of an informational session on green dining practices and the Green Dining Alliance followed by a potluck-style taste-testing of catered food by multiple GDA-certified restaurants around WashU’s campus. It is the Student Sustainability Board’s hope that, following this event, participants will develop a stronger understanding of sustainability practices within the restaurant industry, feel inspired to support local St. Louis establishments and the broader St. Louis community, and recognize how everyday choices (including where and what we eat) can serve as meaningful forms of civic and environmental action.

I’ve cuddled her, given her food and treats and she seems to be eating fine but I just feel horrible. I guess I’m looking for some advice or comfort or reassurance?

I'm posting because I'm genuinely looking for connection, conversation, and people to actually hang out with and the lowkey Netflix or CrunchyRoll marathons. Intimacy needs face to face connection for me. 

Age-Gap supportive:

I've always connected well with people of different ages and backgrounds. Younger, older, doesn't matter to me - good energy and mutual respect matter way more than a number I feel you conect to the energy of the person not their age, colour, gender or religion.

What I'm hoping to find:

Someone to do normal, everyday stuff with - coffee, walks, exploring neighborhoods, random local events, thrift store wandering, food adventures, board games, museums, or just hanging out and talking about life. Nothing intense, just easygoing company, and pure organic connection.

About me: Indigenous & Pagan 

Open-minded and poly-friendly 

Neurodivergent (totally comfortable if you are too)

A little nerdy a little creative

I'm into my community, curiosity, and good conversations Life kept me busy for a long time and I realized my social circle has gotten smaller than I'd like.

1r1mw6t,https://www.reddit.com/r/TyWrites/comments/1r1mw6t/the_coat_rack_in_the_corner/,The Coat Rack in the Corner,"Lynda admired the new coat rack that sat in the corner of her living room. Well, it wasn't exactly brand new, as it was something she had found sitting outside on a neighbor's curb along with the garbage. But who cared? It was nice. She had no idea why it had been left there, as it was visually appealing and seemed to be in pretty good condition. It added a nice touch to her apartment and provided a place where she could finally hang her sweaters and coats without causing clutter.

Speaking of clutter, Lynda turned toward the kitchen. The sink was nearly overfilled with dirty dishes that badly needed to be washed and put away. Grabbing some dish gloves and turning on some soft jazz music, Lynda made her way to the kitchen sink and sighed. ""Oh well, it needs to be done,"" she thought. She filled one compartment of the sink with hot, soapy water, grabbed a plate from the other side, and began scrubbing away. 

Lynda was halfway through washing another dish when she heard a noise coming from behind her. It sounded like a soft scraping. Was it coming from the living room? She couldn't tell. She finished washing the dish and set it aside along with the other clean dishes. Drying her hands on a kitchen towel, Lynda paused the music and listened for the strange sound to come again. When it didn't, she unpaused her music and went back to the dishes. 

A few dishes later, there it was again: SCREECH... SCRAPE... SCREECH.

She turned to look over her shoulder and gasped. The coat rack was seemingly further out in the living room than she remembered it being. ""Hadn't I placed it in the corner?"" she thought aloud. She dried her hands on the towel and headed into the living room to observe the coat rack more closely.

Yes, it had clearly been moved, but how? A cold chill ran down Lynda's spine. She lived alone, so who could have possibly moved it from its original spot? ""Could it...? No! Absolutely not"". Lynda laughed at herself for even thinking that an inanimate object could be capable of moving on its own.

She stood there for a few seconds thinking, and then she realized that maybe her cat, Whiskers, could have accidentally bumped into it. He was a big cat—a fat one at that—so it was definitely a possibility. ""Stupid cat,"" she said, turning to go back into the kitchen. She picked up a mug and noticed that it had a long crack running down one side of it. ""Darn it! This was one of my favorite coffee mugs"". 

Lost in thought while staring at the mug, she heard it again: SCREECH... SCRAPE... SCREECH... SCRAPE!. It sounded closer than before. She spun around and screamed, letting the cracked mug drop from her hand. It shattered into a million pieces at her feet.

The coat rack was now somehow standing at the kitchen entrance, almost like it was blocking the way out—trying to keep her there as a prisoner. Dumbfounded, she couldn't move, speak, or even think. Lynda shut her eyes tight and tried to calm her breathing. ""Could this possibly be my imagination just playing tricks on me?"" she thought.

But the sound of the SCREECH... SCRAPE... SCREECH quickly ended her thoughts and forced her to pull her now tear-filled eyes open. This time, it was only a few feet in front of her. ""HOW!"" she screamed at it. ""HOW ARE YOU MOVING!?"".

Before she had time to think about what to do next, it moved even closer. Now it was right in front of her. Lynda opened her mouth to scream, but no sound came out. A large, hairy, purple hand with sharp, curved nails reached out from the midst of the coats and grabbed poor Lynda, snatching her into the vastly dark center of, well, nothingness.

1r1mupg,https://i.redd.it/u0mzokbkfsig1.jpeg,"""I Don’t Know if This Story is True, But it Carries a Powerful Lesson for Traders""💥","&#x200B;

""When I first started investing, I thought fast money was the goal.

Turns out… slow money is what actually makes you rich.”

Three years ago, I was the guy who refreshed stock prices every five minutes.

Coffee in one hand.

Phone in the other.

Heart racing like I was gambling in Vegas.

If a stock went up 2%, I felt like a genius.

If it dropped 3%, my whole day was ruined.

Buy. Sell. Panic. Repeat.

I wasn’t investing.

I was chasing.

And honestly...

I was losing more sleep than money.

One afternoon, after another bad trade, I walked into this small local café to cool my head. That’s where I noticed an older man sitting alone near the window.

Gray hair. Reading glasses. Newspaper folded to the business section. No laptop. No charts. No stress.

Just calm.

On the table next to him was a book: The Intelligent Investor.

I don’t know why, but I asked,

“Sir… do you follow the market?”

He smiled.

“Son, I’ve followed it longer than you’ve been alive.”

We ended up talking for almost two hours.

I told him everything — the day trading, the losses, the stress, the constant fear of missing out.

He just listened.

Then he said something that hit me hard:

“Why are you trying to get rich by Friday?”

I laughed.

“Isn’t that the point?”

He shook his head.

“No. The market isn’t a casino. It’s a tool. And tools reward patience, not speed.”

That was the first time someone had ever said that to me.

He pulled out a napkin and drew two lines.

One was zig-zag and crazy.

“That’s you,” he said.

Then he drew another line. Slow. Steady. Upward.

“That’s investing.”

He explained it like I was five years old.

“Buy great companies. Companies you’d be proud to own even if the market closed for 10 years. Then don’t touch them.”

I remember asking,

“But what about timing the market?”

He chuckled.

“Time in the market beats timing the market. Every single time.”

Then he told me about compounding.

How money grows… then grows on the growth… then grows on that growth.

Like a snowball rolling downhill.

“At first it feels slow,” he said.

“Then suddenly it’s unstoppable.”

He talked about dividends too — companies literally paying you just for holding their stock.

“Imagine getting paid for being patient,” he said. “That’s real wealth.”

It sounded… boring.

No excitement.

No adrenaline.

But also…

No stress.

That night, I went home and did something crazy.

I sold all my random trades.

Stopped chasing hype stocks.

And bought shares of solid companies I actually believed in.

Big brands. Strong profits. Long history.

Then I deleted my trading app from my home screen.

I only checked once a month.

The first few weeks felt weird.

Too quiet.

Like nothing was happening.

But months passed… and something interesting happened.

My portfolio didn’t jump wildly anymore.

It just… slowly climbed.

Up. Down a little. Up again.

Steady.

Peaceful.

For the first time, I slept better.

No more midnight panic checking.

No more emotional rollercoaster.

Just consistency.

A year later, my returns beat everything I made day trading.

And I barely did anything.

That old man was right.

We think investing is about action.

But it’s actually about discipline.

It’s about sitting still while the world overreacts.

It’s about trusting time more than luck.

It’s boring.

And that’s exactly why it works.

Now whenever someone asks me for stock tips, I tell them what he told me:

“Don’t look for the next hot stock.

Look for the next 10 years.”

Because wealth isn’t built in days.

It’s built in decades.

Slowly. Quietly. Patiently.

Like planting a tree today so you can sit in the shade tomorrow.

And honestly..

I’ll take calm money over fast money any day.

I lay in bed and stare up at the ceiling counting the little popcorn bumps. I groan as I check the time on my twin bell alarm clock. ""Fuck... Work starts in an hour."" I was honestly hoping I could wake up a little earlier so I could get some food in me before I went to work, maybe watch some YouTube. But I settled on scrolling through Instagram reels instead. Scrolling endlessly with mind numbing swiftness, dreading having to pull myself out of bed and get ready. 

A pling notified me from my manager of the address we would be cleaning that day. ""Fuck it."" I said as I threw my phone to the far end of my mattress. I got up, brushed my teeth and jumped in the shower. Throwing on some old dirty jeans from the past 5 days in a row and a black t-shirt with holes around the bottom. 

A quick look in the mirror and ruffling my brown hair and a stupid smile ""you're a wreck"" I thought. I walk out of my laundry covered room and grab my keys off the kitchen table.

I pulled up to the address and saw my coworker John getting all the cleaning supplies out of the back of the van.

""John Manager, what's up man."" I said as I walked up to him. 

""Shut up Will."" John scoffed to himself 

John was a no bulshit kind of guy, grizzled maybe in his early 40's I wouldn't bother asking. He was good company, had his jokes and dry humor. All I cared about was that he was a good manager and coworker. 

He actually got his hands dirty when you needed him and jumped onto any situation to give you tips. Not in a know it all douchey way either, He's a good dude is my point.

""why don't you help me get the hazmat suits out of the truck."" He groaned as he put a massive bucket of bleach onto the concrete.

""Got you, so what's going on up in the apartment? Any word on what we are walking into?"" I said as I rummaged through the van.

""I'm not too sure, all I heard was something happened with the guys teeth and he croaked about a week ago. No one heard from him and they called in a wellness check. Sure enough we are here, so yeah.... Hes dead"" he said with a kind of stare off into the distance and hands on his sides.

""Oh word? He's not alive and breathing? I thought we were here to say hi. Maybe give him a kiss on the cheek or something.""  I said dumbfounded

""Yeah you can go give the cadaver a kiss on the cheek if you want."" John said laughing 

""So where the hell is Arin...it's 10:30... Dude is seriously late every fucking day."" I said noticeably annoyed I threw the 3 hazmat suits onto the pavement next to the bleach.

""Yeah I know he is, he sent me a text I guess his alarm went off late I don't know. I just saw his car pull in so whatever."" He said brushing it off.

""NOT WHATEVER! FUCK THAT DUDE! John, I bust my ass to get here on time every day and that scrawny fuck is always late!!!"" I said throwing my hands up

Arin walked up to the van with his big Osiris shoes and an oversized tap out shirt way too big for his skinny frame. Tall, goofy greasy hair. His breath always smelled like he rolled out of bed and ran out of the door. I Hate this guy. Who the fuck wears tap out shirts and Osiris shoes in 2025. I'm not even sure they make them anymore.

""You guys started unpacking already?"" Arin said with fake concern in his voice clearly trying to cover his ass.

""Uh yuh we did. We started at 10."" I said as I walked by him to grab the respirators out of the van. 

""Arin grab the brooms and mops and get it ready to go up to the apartment and hurry up, I don't feel like being here all night. And before you give me some dumb excuse just get your suit on man. This is your 3rd last warning, you're late again and I'm kicking your ass to the curb."" John said with a stern tone.

""Alright alright...I'm sorry I just was on my way here an-"" John cut off Arin

""I just said I don't give a shit! Do what I asked please."" John said with anger.

All while this was happening I couldn't help but notice the lack of cars in the parking lot. It's late at night on a Tuesday. Shouldn't there be more people here? Probably why no one noticed the smell, No one lives here.

We got all suited up, big yellow hazmat suits, respirators and goggles. Dressed to the nines ready for whatever it is we were going into. 

We had to walk up 5 flights of stairs just to get to the fucking apartment. For some reason they didn't have an elevator in this place. How the hell do they even get furniture in these rooms. 

""So what's the room number?"" Arin asked

""565 is the room, we're almost there."" John said winded from the stairs.

We finally got to the room. A coffee brown stain on the bottom of a white door that has seen much better days. The green paint on the trim of the door has begun chipping and falling off as if it were dripping some rank ichor onto the dark grey carpet of the hallway. 

Little did any of us know at the time. This rot was a sign of the corruption that seeped out from within that horrible room. A sign of the foreboding madness that lay waiting within.

""So uh who wants to do the honors and open the door?"" John asked Arin and I in a bouncy tone. He's clearly been doing this much longer than us.

""I got it."" I said with my chin to my chest and hand in the air.

As I put my hand on the door knob I couldn't help but feel a creeping sense of anxiety. Not exactly full blown panic or anything, but the feeling in my gut that whatever it is we were going to walk in on was something that should not be mettled with. Not in the sense of gore, but something completely off. Something macabre that should be left well alone...

 As I turned the door knob a small voice ever so soft was screaming at me to quit that job right then and there and up and leave. I could deal with John later I'm a good worker, Im sure he would understand. But I gritted my teeth and opened the door. A rush of air flooded into the stale dark apartment. Even through the respirator I could smell the all too familiar coppery scent of blood.

 I sat there for a second, and I couldn't put my finger on why. I've done multiple jobs before this, seen horrible things. So why does this one job in a random apartment complex feel like something so wrong. I huffed to myself and let out a small ""okay."" And heaved the door all the way open as if I had to push it through some sort of viscious fluid.

The door let out a small creak and a smack. As it hit the wall. I saw nothing, it was too dark in the apartment. So I stepped my right boot in and reached my arm onto the wall. Desperately reaching out for some sort of switch, finally my hand caught leverage. I flipped the light on and the scene before me was something I could never have imagined.

As the lights came on, John, Arin and I were absolutely taken back. The only person to utter any form of opinion or word about what laid before us was John a quick short simple ""woah."" Is all he said.

The room laid out, a simple small 2 bedroom apartment. Living room, kitchen and bedroom were right in front of us and to the right was a small bathroom. In the corners of the room crimson erupted up from the baseboard just out of grasp of the ceiling in all four corners. 

Crumpled pages laid sprawled out in a random incoherent order all around the room. The couch laid in 2 pieces split down the middle as if someone too heavy sat right in the center. The bed displayed signs of ensanguination, the mattress soaking up the hemmorage like a giant sponge. Writings all over the wall, the only decernable message in some desperate manner was a name or a word? 

""Vrag Gnasth?"" I said aloud in a questioning manner.

""What the hell does that mean."" Arin said puzzled

At the center of all of this laid a rotting mass of meat and rotting teeth. Laying in front of it all, a small brown journal with an almost vine looking design on the cover. 

""What the fuck."" I said in disbelief

Arin stands there saying nothing. A man of few words and even fewer thoughts. Fucking hate that guy.

""Well let's get to it! I said it earlier and I'll say it again. I don't want to be here all night. I got a date with a 30 rack at 6am and you can't drink all day if you don't start in the morning."" John said and smacked his hands together with a loud clap and bounced forward into the gore with a mop and bucket. Old blood sticking to the wheels of the bucket as he pushed it into the room.

Shaking his head Arin followed behind. 

After a solid 2-3 hours of cleaning and scrubbing and ripping up the carpets.

I picked up the brown journal that was now tossed to the side, in a pile of dreams put to an end too early.  I flipped through the pages, It looked fairly normal with random dates and entries almost like a diary.

""Hey John, so what are we gonna do with all this uh.."" I looked down at the pile of rotting carrion ""..this...guys things?""

""I was told to throw it all away, the guy didn't have any family."" John said packing the mans clothes into a garbage bag.

I figured I would keep it for myself and read it later. I don't know why I had the urge to take it for myself, but I had this itch in my brain I couldn't scratch and at that moment taking the journal felt like it would help.

Me and Arin stood in front of the van fully packed with bags full of torn up carpet and various fluids. I pulled down the hood of my suit and lifted off the respirator taking in the biggest suck of fresh air iv had in the past 5 hours. Whiping the sweat off my forehead I turn to John who was walking out of the apartment complex.

""Is that the last of it?"" I said with a huff catching my breathe from the 5 flights of stairs. ""My legs feel like fucking jello."" I whined into the air twords no one. 

""They seriously need to put an elevator in there or something."" Said Arin holding his lower back

""Yup, that's most of it. The morning crew will come in and finish up in about 3 hours, so we should be set to go home."" John said with a satisfied smile.

""I'm beat, see you guys later."" Arin said as he turned around to walk to his car.

""Wait up man."" I said to him in an annoyed tone ""John is there anything else you need from us? Are we good?"" I said with a thumbs up 

John gave us a hearty thumbs up and sent us on our way. I turned around and bolted twords my car I couldn't get there fast enough, I needed a shower and bad. Arin said bye to me but I scoffed and got into my car. Fuck that guy. Dude seriously sucks.

After a long drive of depersonalizing and listening to the radio. I finally came too as I pulled into my drive way. I didn't have much, just a nice little 1 story home I rented out with the money I made from the job. I walked in and threw my keys on the kitchen table and tossed the odd journal beside it.

After washing blood from my ears and the little bits of whatever the hell that got in through the hood. I dried off my hair and plopped into bed. The sun was rising at this point.

Thinking back on that job, why didn't any of us even question what the hell we walked in on. The dude was reduced to a pile of meat. Not to mention the rotted teeth that were thrown into the mess, it doesn't make any sense. It was just needlessly violent for no reason. 

Most of the scenes, even murders aren't like that. like yeah it's gross but it's someone laying in bed or on the floor, maybe some blood here and there in the carpet or on the walls. Not a pile of organs and bone and a cascade of blood all throughout the apartment. 

I decided I'd do a little research online to see what had happened to the guy. I didn't find much, just a name and a obituary. The guy really didn't have any family, his name was Daniel Cline. I guess he was married at one point but had a nasty divorce.

Obviously I wouldn't find anything on him if there really was something odd going on... It's not like I'm some CIA agent, all I have is Google. But at the crime scene there were pages almost laid out on the floor in a manner like he was studying something. Not to mention that another language written on the wall in blood, Vrag Gnasth. 

""Vrag Gnasth, that doesn't even make any sense."" I said allowed questioning it once again. 

So I tried googling that and nothing came up only that typical ""your search query couldn't find existing documents.""

""Whatever"" I thought.

I decided I'd get some sleep so maybe I could actually wake up at a normal time to get some stuff done before everything closed. 

I awoke to the sound of grinding. Almost like a squeeking sound. Like glass scouring together, violently. The sound itself gave me a visceral reaction. I could feel a chill down to the core of my bones. My eyes shot open almost in a panic. I looked around my room and nothing still alone as always. 

I took a peek at the time, it was 10pm What the hell? I fell asleep at 8am. You're telling me I slept for 15 hours. Probably from all the hard work I did going up and down those stairs.

 I decided I'd check my phone to see if John messaged me about a new job, Im normally on call at random times during the week. This was one of those times, but nope no texts or calls. Guess no one's died recently.. or found at least. While checking my phone I couldn't help but notice a slight pain in my jaw. That same aching feeling I got when my wisdom teeth were pulled when I was 17. Sore, aching?  

""Ow"" I said to myself rubbing my jaw. 

I groaned as I opened and wiggle my mouth around in an attempt to maybe stretch out the pain. No dice, it was still there.  

Shaking it off, I rolled out of bed and threw on some old shirt after giving it the sniff test, I decided it would be a pretty boring night considering it was late. Only thing open right now is the gas station down the street so I guess I'm not getting groceries. I plopped my happy ass down on the couch in my living room rubbing my aching legs and grabbing the remote. Figured I'd throw on some creep cast or something on YouTube, catch up on some old stories. 

While watching them talk about some goofy my little pony story I started hearing that grinding noise again. So I paused the video, looking around the room listening trying to pin point the exact source of this noise just so I could stop it. It was horrible! No matter where I looked it sounded like it was right on top of me. 

I figured maybe it was something outside. So I opened my window and nothing, there's absolutely no one out there and why would there be? . I threw my head in my hands. And that's when I noticed it, it was me. I was the source of the excruciating noise. I have been grinding my teeth this whole time! As soon as I caught it, it stopped. And soon after the pain I felt this morning returned. 

""What the fuck"" I said rubbing my jaw. 

""Maybe it's all the stress from work getting to me?"" I'm pretty sure stress can do weird things like that right? Maybe I just need some beer, take the edge off. That gas station down the road might actually come in handy after all.

I flung open the door to the easy fill and heard a loud chime of the bell above the door. At the counter was an overweight man with glasses and a unkempt beard. Looked like he couldn't be fucked to be here. He was sitting at the counter with his arms wrapped around his chest and his chin down staring at his little phone. ""Probably a discord mod."" I thought to myself and laughed.

I made my way to the back and grabbed a 6 pack of Bush. Didn't like the stuff that much but it's what I could find that wasn't shitty. I brought it up to the counter.

""How ya doin."" I said making small talk with the man

""Ohhh you know...just another day in paradise. Been looking for the girl of my dreams back here on my phone."" He said with a snark laugh

""Oh yeah?"" I laughed nerviously 

Oh God one of these. I thought to myself

""That'll be 8.95$ sir."" He said with hot breath

I gave him the cash.

""Looks like you got your wisdom teeth pulled recently. Your cheeks are puffed up, I wouldn't be drinking beer like this if I were you. You know, it can actually unclott the blood and give you dry socket."" He said while he was giving me my change.

""What?"" I felt the back of my jaw and sure enough it was swollen like a gumball.

I took my change and quickly left the gas station.

As I sat in my car I hurriedly pull down the sun shield and looked into the mirror. Holy shit I look like I got hit by a baseball bat. I drove home rubbing my face and racking my brain thinking about what I could have done to start this? I mean maybe grinding my teeth? But really that vigorously and not noticing while I did it?! What the hell.

As I sat back down on the couch I cracked open one of the beers and took a sip. The cold beer on the back of my gums felt nice. The alcohol helped too and the pain soon subsided, as I watched YouTube I felt myself finally relaxing. No more pain in my face and no more pain in my legs fucking finally I thought. After finishing the 6 pack of Bush I soon fell asleep on the couch with my TV on. 

While I slept I drempt of a dark void with a crimson glow. I was standing there that much I knew. I could feel my body but not see anything. I tried to look at my hands but nothing was there. I felt the increasing panic rise in my chest and my breathe quicken. It felt as though I had masses and bumps under my skin, wriggling and moving. 

The foreign objects, I could feel them pushing against one another begging for more room inside my arms. All I hear is the same grinding sound but this time it is accompanied by a wet sloshing smacking sound. Like meat in a grinder that is far too dull to get the job done without violent force.

 The noise rose slowly in volume. Getting louder and louder. I desperately looked around for something, anything. Any sort of light. Something to grace my eyes with an explanation or some sort of false comfort. There was nothing but the sound ""Gnasstthhh Gnasssshhhthhh Gnassssttthhhh"" louder and louder

It felt like I was stuck in this void for hours. I could feel my palms pressed against my ears but nothing stopped this noise from assaulting my ear drums ""GNASTHSH GNASHTHHH GNASSSSHHHHTTTHHHH"" I finally awoke in a panicked sweat. 

 

""WHAT THE FUCK!"" I yelled to myself.

I franticly rubbed my arms and legs to check if I was infact okay. There was nothing, it was a dream. I knew that but I couldn't stop myself.  The pain in my face has returned and is definetly not ignorable. I rushed to the bathroom to look in the mirror. Prying my mouth open and cheek to the side. In the back of my mouth, my wisdom teeth were growing back in. 

Blood soaked the bottom of the tooth already half way erupting from my gums. My  wisdom teeth are growing back at an alarming pace. I poked them, they were real but they weren't nearly as secure as the rest of my teeth. They grew as if there was nothing below to anker them into my mouth. 

 I poked and prodded and moved them with my fingers. Twisting and pushing the left molar. I pulled my hand out of my mouth and steadied myself on the bathroom sink looking into the mirror. I don't want to but I think I have too. I smack my hands on the edge of the sink, open my mouth and lean closer to the mirror with determination. I grabbed my left wisdom tooth and pulled. The pain was unimaginable.


 I yanked and the tooth gave way. As I pulled a thick stringy twine-like mass of veins laid below. I yelled at the top of my lungs as I pulled, blood pooled into the crevice underneath my tongue. I felt the warmth of blood filling my mouth. Screaming in pain gargling as it went down my throat. I didn't care, this wasn't right it shouldn't be growing back. It doesn't make any sense. Finally with a swift ""plenk"" the tooth came out. Leaving a small hole with flesh in its place, oozing yellow and white fluid. My effort wasn't unrewarded though, the pain had begun to fade in the left side of my face.


I breathed heavily spitting the blood and infection into the sink. Taking a deep sip of water I swished it around and spit. Finally as I calmed myself, I took a good look at the tooth. There was a full crown on the top but the sides were ripe with decay. It smelled like rot. 

Underneath laid a dark red ball of tissue. I tossed it to the side of my bathroom counter. ""What the fuck is going on."" I could feel tears welling in my eyes. Why the hell don't I have health insurance. I cursed myself on top of all the bulshit that was happening. With my head in my arms draped over the bathroom sink I wept. 


I grabbed the tooth and returned to my couch, plopping myself back down defeated with the pain I still felt in the rest of my face. I wanted it to stop but if it meant going through what I just did again and again I don't think I could do it. I stared at this alien object I extracted from my maw. 


""It just doesn't make any fucking sense."" I sighed.


Googling ""can wisdom teeth regrow in face"" didn't yield any information because surprise no they fucking don't. So now I'm sitting here in pain wondering what the hell is even happening to me. Laying down on my couch defeated and staring at the ceiling. 

The silence didn't last long though. It starts up again, the grinding of my teeth. Rubbing vigorously and with force hard enough to shatter my teeth, I was waiting for them to shatter through one another into the gums above and below. But that isn't happening. Over and over I open my mouth smack it back down and grind my teeth hard.

 I scream in pain but it comes out as muffled yelp from my mouth being forced shut. I panic, I don't know what to do. I don't have control over my own jaw. The only thing I can think to do in my altered state is punch myself as hard as I can in the mouth. Doing so lodges two rotted teeth into my knuckles. 


""OKAY I GOTTA GET HELP"" I say allowed 


I quickly rummage for my phone, it must have fallen into the cracks during the struggle with my over active jaw. I try to stick my hand in between the cushions but the teeth that are stuck in my left hand dig further into my tendons. That's when I noticed it. 


""I hit myself with my right fist, how the hell did-"" I say puzzled


I pull my hand from the couch and hold it out in front of my face inspecting every inch of my hand. 2 rotted teeth are peeking out from the back of my hand, 3 are growing from under my finger nails 2 under my thumb and 1 under my pinky. I yell in panic as I notice they're slowly growing ripping and tearing apart my nails grasp from my finger. 


""What do I do! WHAT DO I D-"" I begin to cough and choke as my throat begins to close. 

I feel my face begin to turn red and the pressure growing in my visage. I look down and see bumps begin to form under my skin along my arms. I raise my shirt and see the same. Blood begins to pour out of each hole. Growing and growing, heavier and heavier I feel my feet begin to press into the carpet below me. All at once I feel as though I will erupt, pop like a zit filled with calcium.

 My vision begins to fade to black. I'm begging and pleading inside myself for this to stop. As it begins to crescendo I feel my body stretch up and up, finally I collapse into myself. A wave of blood erupts from me like a volcano. Shooting in every single direction in my little home. There I lay, a pile of what I once was. Gone. 

I cannot see. I am not me. I am not here. I simply hear the gnashing of teeth and the chewing of meat. I am with him. He is with me. We are one. I am whole once again. 






""Hey Arin, we got another clean up job. I'll send you over the address. When you see it just let me know if you'll be alright doing it with me. I know it might be tough."" John said over the phone in a somber tone.


""Sounds good"" I say as I hang up the phone.


My phone beeps with a notification. When I check it, I notice it's my friend Wills address. Oh shit... I guess that explains why he hasn't shown up to work in a couple of days. 


As I walk up to the familiar home I've only seen dropping off my co-worker when he had car troubles. I see John already suited up and ready. 


""We started at 10 right John?"" I said concerned.


""Yeah we did, you're on time. Guess I'm just antsy to get this clean up done. Will didn't deserve this..."" John said sadly


""Yeah he didn't..."" I said with my hands in my pockets and a sigh.


When me and John finished up our portion of the clean up I noticed that same journal that we saw at the other job on Wills table. I thought that was odd, so I decided to open it up and take a look at what was written in there. Sure enough the first couple pages were just day to day stuff. Boring days at the office, something about a bad divorce with this guy's wife cheating. 


""There's that weird thing again Vrag Gnasth"" I said aloud to myself.


But then I flipped towards the back and noticed a page with something real weird scribbled on it over and over. It looked like it was written in a hurry almost like someone was panicking. All it was over and over was ""don't say his name""

The company posted adjusted earnings per share of $0.58, beating estimates, but revenue of $11.80 billion fell short of the $12.0 billion consensus.  
  
The revenue shortfall was driven primarily by weakening demand in North America and Asia, as consumers pushed back against price increases. Despite the miss, the company demonstrated underlying strength with 5 percent organic revenue growth in the quarter, supported by 4 percent volume increases and continued pricing power. Coke Zero and water brands showed particularly strong performance.  
  
Coca-Cola shares fell approximately 4 percent in premarket trading and continued declining throughout the day, down 2.1 percent at one point, representing the steepest drop since October and second-largest decline since April. The stock weakness extended to competitor PepsiCo, which also traded lower.  
  
Looking ahead, Coca-Cola forecast 4 to 5 percent organic revenue growth for 2026, in line with analyst estimates but viewed as cautious given current market conditions. CEO James Quincey characterized the revenue miss as a ""weird anomaly"" while emphasizing strong underlying revenue growth trends.  
  
The company announced it will retain full ownership of Costa Coffee but is reviewing the brand's challenged operations in China. Separately, bottler Coca-Cola HBC reported strong fourth-quarter results with higher profit and revenue, forecasting 7 to 10 percent organic operating profit growth in 2026 driven by robust demand for non-alcoholic beverages and market expansion.  
  
Despite the disappointing quarter, several analysts defended the stock, taking a long-term view of the business. The company continues advancing innovation initiatives and refranchising efforts while navigating evolving consumer preferences toward low-sugar options amid growing weight-loss drug trends.",1,1770781645.0,MarketFluxHub,0,1.0,False

Is it wrong for me to be upset because I do everything around the house? I cook, do all the cleaning, shopping, etc. He has never cooked me a home cooked meal, has maybe surprised me with flowers or something nice 1x. Anytime I need something done around the house it’s like pulling teeth. If I ask him to do laundry or fold laundry he treats it like a burden. I literally can’t ask for help at all because he will either laugh me off or just not do it. He only works 3-4 days a week and spends most days playing video games never leaving his chair. It’s honestly starting to disgust me and I’m slowly starting to resent him. All we do is get into arguments and he accuses me of just wanting his money and that I just want things. He thinks holidays like Christmas and Valentine’s Day are consumerism and a waste of money so I never get any gifts. Barely any effort on our anniversary too. He doesn’t like to leave the house and is a hermit. I just don’t know what I’m supposed to do to change him. I don’t want to do everything around the house. It would be nice for him to cook me a meal or make me coffee instead of me always doing it. I am so tired of it. I also take care of all our animals. (3 dogs and 2 tortoises).

1r1mn0g,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1r1mn0g/revelation_chapter_1/,Revelation - Chapter 1,"The city had a rhythm to it at night. Elijah had lived in it long enough to know the patterns, the way the traffic thinned after nine, how the street vendors packed up their carts on 5th street, the particular quality of light that made the downtown high-rises look like they were floating. It was October in 2103, and the air through Naomi's cracked window carried that first hint of winter, the kind that made you think about scarves and hot coffee and the holidays still months away.

Normal. Everything was supposed to be normal.

He stood at her apartment window on the fourteenth floor, watching a delivery drone navigate between buildings with its blinking green lights. Below, a couple walked their dog past the corner bodega where the owner, Mr. Chen, still refused to install a digital payment system and only took cash. The old ways persisted in a world that had moved on.

""You're doing it again,"" Naomi said behind him.

Elijah glanced back. She was curled on the couch, knees tucked under her, wearing that old NYU hoodie she'd had since undergrad. It was faded now, the logo cracked and peeling, but she refused to throw it out. Said it was lucky. Even now, six months into whatever this was between them the sight of her made his chest tight in a way he couldn't quite explain. He was ready to give it all up for her. 

""Doing what?""

""Catastrophizing."" She smiled, but it didn't reach her eyes. Not tonight. ""Come sit down. You're making me nervous.""

Behind her, the television played on mute. The news, always the news lately. The apartment was small, the kind of place young professionals settled for in the city: one bedroom, a kitchen barely big enough to turn around in, but the view made up for it. Naomi worked in graphic design for a marketing firm two blocks over. It paid enough for this place and student loans and the occasional weekend trip upstate when they could both get away from work.

They'd met at a friend's birthday party in July, one of those rooftop affairs in Brooklyn where everyone drank too much and pretended the humidity wasn't suffocating. She'd been standing alone by the railing, and he'd offered her his beer because he was already too warm and she looked thirsty. They'd talked until three in the morning about nothing important, favorite movies, worst jobs, whether the Mets would ever win again. She'd given him her number. He'd actually called it.

And now here they were, and the world was ending.

Elijah crossed the small living room and sank beside her. She immediately tucked herself against his side, her head finding that hollow beneath his shoulder like it always did. He breathed in…coconut shampoo and something floral he could never name. Her hand rested on his chest at first and then slowly moved up to his hair and began to trace small circles through it. 

His phone buzzed in his pocket. He ignored it. Probably work. The insurance firm where he'd been grinding away for two years as a risk analyst, calculating probabilities and running models that predicted how likely people were to die, to crash, to burn. Morbid work, but it paid the bills. Or it had, back when bills mattered.

""It's just weird,"" he said suddenly. ""All of it.""

""Weird doesn't mean world-ending.""

But her voice wavered, and they both knew she was lying. They'd been dancing around it for three days now, ever since the reports started flooding social media. Not just the usual conspiracy theory corners either. Verified accounts, news organizations, government officials. All of them talking about the same impossible thing.

The world in 2103 was supposed to be beyond this. They had quantum computers that could predict weather patterns six months out. Gene therapy had cured most cancers. The Mars colony was accepting its third wave of settlers. Humanity had solved so many problems, climbed so many mountains.

And yet here they were, watching grainy cell phone footage of something that should have belonged in a medieval manuscript.

A white horse. A rider with a bow. Moving through the clouds like lightning.

The television shifted to a split screen: a stern-faced anchor on the left, a religious scholar on the right. Dr. Something-or-other from Yale Divinity School, according to the captions.

""—what we're seeing is mass hysteria on a global scale,"" the scholar was saying. ""Social media has created echo chambers where—""

""But how do you explain the simultaneous sightings across different continents?"" the anchor interrupted. ""We have reports from Jamaica, New Denmark, Moscow, all within the same hour.""

""Confirmation bias. People see what they expect to see. One viral video becomes a template, and suddenly everyone's seeing white horses in cloud formations.""

Elijah felt Naomi's fingers curl around a strand of his hair.

""Do you think it's real?"" she whispered.

He wanted to say no. Wanted to laugh it off, kiss her forehead, suggest they put on that cooking show she loved. Instead, he thought about the video he'd watched that morning while she was still asleep. A street camera from Seoul, timestamp verified. The sky had split open, just for a second, and something pale had streaked across the frame. Too fast to be a plane. Too deliberate to be a meteor. And the bow. God help him, he'd seen the bow.

""I don't know,"" he said.

The anchor was introducing another guest now. Some tech billionaire Elijah vaguely recognized. Younger than them, probably, though the expensive suit aged him.

""—excited to announce that my company will be partnering with the UN to establish a global coordination framework,"" the billionaire was saying. His smile was perfect. ""What we're facing is an unprecedented crisis of information and infrastructure. But crisis breeds opportunity. With the right leadership, the right vision, we can emerge from this stronger than ever.""

""He looks like a used car salesman,"" Naomi muttered sleepily, burying her face into his shirt with a cute squeak.

""A used car salesman who just got appointed to some new UN position."" Elijah nodded at the screen, where bullet points were appearing: Special Envoy for Global Stability. Emergency Powers. Unified Response Protocol.

""How does that even happen? Three days ago nobody knew his name.""

""Three days ago we weren't seeing horses in the sky.""

Naomi pulled away just enough to look at him. In the television's glow, her dark eyes were almost black. ""You think they're connected?""

""I think nothing makes sense anymore.""

She studied his face for a long moment, then moved away and reached for her phone on the coffee table. Her thumb moved in practiced swipes. Instagram, probably, or TikTok. The blue light washed out her features.

""There's a new hashtag,"" she said. ""People are calling him the Peacemaker. Says he's already negotiating truces in the Middle East, stopped some conflict in the South China Sea before it escalated. All in like, seventy-two hours.""

""That's not possible.""

""None of this is possible, Elijah.""

The television cut to footage of the billionaire, “the Peacemaker,” shaking hands with world leaders. The image had that surreal quality of historical moments captured in real-time. Tomorrow it would be in textbooks, Elijah thought. If there was a tomorrow. If there were still textbooks.

He stood abruptly, needing to move. The apartment suddenly felt too small, the walls too close. He found himself back at the window, forehead pressed against the cool glass.

""Hey."" Naomi's voice behind him, soft. ""Talk to me.""

""My mom used to read me the Bible,"" he said. ""Every night before bed. I didn’t like it, all those thee's and thou's, the smiting and the plagues. But I remember Revelation.""

""Elijah—""

""The seven seals. The horsemen. White horse first, then red, then black, then pale. Conquest, war, famine, death.""

""You don't actually think—""

""I don't know what I think."" He turned to face her. She'd stood, was hugging herself now, the hoodie sleeves pulled over her hands. ""But if I'm right, if this is what I think it is, then who knows how long we have before it gets worse.""

""Worse how?""

""The second seal. The red horse."" He swallowed hard. ""Peace taken from the earth. War.""

Naomi crossed to him in three quick steps and took his face in her hands. Her palms were warm, steady. ""Listen to me. We don't know anything for sure. Maybe it's mass hysteria. Maybe it's some weird atmospheric phenomenon. Maybe it's nothing.""

""And if it's not nothing?""

""Then we deal with it. Together."" She rose on her toes and kissed him, soft and fierce, erasing all worry from his mind. ""You're not alone in this. Whatever happens, we face it together. Okay?""

He wrapped his arms around her, held her close enough to feel her heartbeat against his chest. ""Okay.""

But even as he said it, even as he breathed in her scent and felt the solid reality of her in his arms, he couldn't shake the image from that Seoul video. The way the sky had opened like a wound. The white horse emerged from nothing, from nowhere.

The bow in the rider's hand.

And the crown, he hadn't mentioned the crown to Naomi, couldn't bring himself to, gleaming gold against the impossible white of everything else.

His phone buzzed in his pocket. Probably his boss, wondering if he was coming in tomorrow. The firm seemed both incredibly important and utterly meaningless now. What did statistical tables matter when the math of reality itself had broken?

""Are you staying tonight?"" Naomi asked.

""If you want me to.""

""I want you to.""

They stood there in the window's light, the city sprawling below them, still beautiful despite everything. Headlights traced familiar patterns on the streets. Apartment windows glowed warm. Somewhere a siren wailed, just a normal city siren, ambulance or police, the kind you learned to tune out after living here long enough. In the distance, a plane blinked across the horizon, just a plane, nothing more.

Tomorrow he had work. A meeting at nine about the new strategic models, lunch with a client who wanted to insure a fleet of autonomous vehicles. Normal things. Naomi had a deadline on some campaign for an energy drink that was supposed to appeal to Generation 6. They'd planned to get dinner on Thursday at that Thai place in the West Village, the one with the patio seating and the mango sticky rice that Naomi said was worth the wait. Plans. A future. Things that assumed next week would come, and the week after that.

The television droned on. The Peacemaker was speaking again, his voice full of calm authority. ""—assure the international community that these phenomena, whatever their origin, will be met with coordinated, rational response. This is not a time for fear. This is a time for unity.""

""He's good,"" Naomi said quietly. ""The way he talks. He makes you want to believe him.""

Elijah said nothing. He was watching the sky beyond the glass, waiting for it to split open again, and half expecting that it would. 

It didn't.

Not that night.

But he knew, with a certainty that lived in his bones, in the space where faith and terror met, that it would. At the thought his arm tightened around her shoulder and he pulled her in closer. 

The first seal had been broken. The white horse had ridden. Conquest had begun, subtle and smiling, wearing an expensive suit and promising peace.

Six more seals waited.

Naomi's presence next to him was the only real thing left in the world.

Outside, the city hummed on, oblivious. Mr. Chen locked up his bodega. The delivery drone completed its route. The couple with the dog had long disappeared around a corner. Life, continuing as if it knew how.

Elijah held Naomi closer and tried not to count the days.

* Adderall (25mg daily) - past several months (took Ritalin for ADHD for ~17 years prior, paychiatrist made the switch)
* Caffeine via multiple cups of coffee daily - past few weeks (makes me feel like crap with the jitters and hampers sleep, but does help at a high enough dose)
* Taurine and low-dose Theanine (standard doae gives me a headache) with the coffee
* High EPA/DHA fish and cod liver oil 3x daily - past 4 weeks
* MCT oil (2 or 3 tablespoons first thing each AM) - past few months
* Magnesium malate (~300mg elemental daily) - past few months
* D3 (4000 IU) + K daily - past 4 weeks (was taking 2000 IU sans K prior)
* Intermittant fasting ~14/10
* Green smoothie with Kale daily
* Regular low-ish intensity cardio exercise

Considering trying:
* B vitamins (took liberally over the fall, stopped due to astronomically high B12 reading in December)
* High dose vitamin D (like 10,000 IU)
* Turmeric (made me feel weird last time I tried it a few years back)
* Microdosing psilocybin (~100mg every 2 or 3 days)
* Low-Dose Naltrexone
* Modanafil (psychiatrust tells me this would have to be in place of Adderall)
* SNRI like Wellbutrin (*very* wary of this route due to bad previous SSRI experiences)
* Intermittant fasting ~18/6 or higher (/lower?)
* Eliminating processed foods, possibly gluten (per dieta below)
* Mediterranean, Paleo or anti inflammatory diet
* Low carb/no sugar added diet
* Keto diet
* Elimination diet (e.g., Whole 30)
* High intensity interval training
* Sleeping 9+ hours nightly (getting to bed early has always been a huge struggle)

Have any of these - or something else - actually moved the needle in terms of fatigue and brain fog for anyone with PsA here?

1r1mmgz,https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelNoPics/comments/1r1mmgz/our_three_week_thailand_trip_as_first_time/,Our three week Thailand trip as first time visitors,"My partner and I (M+F early 30s) recently returned from a 3 week trip to Thailand. It was our first foray to Southeast Asia and we will definitely be back. Here’s a rundown of our itinerary with my notes and suggestions.



Summary

* Bangkok: 3 nights (4 if you count the additional night I booked to check in early)
* Sukhothai: 3 nights
* Overnight train: 1 night
* Chiang Rai: 2 nights
* Chiang Mai: 5 nights
* Khao Sok: 3 nights
* Koh Phangan: 4 nights
* Bangkok: 1 night



**Bangkok** 

**Dec 29-Jan 1**



Arrived early in the morning at BKK airport. Baggage claim was quick. At immigration we waited maybe 30 minutes? Make sure to complete your [TDAC](https://tdac.immigration.go.th/arrival-card/) in advance for smooth entry. 



We followed the signs to the airport rail link to get into the city. Contactless payment is possible with a credit card. There’s also machines that dispense single-use payment tokens. The machines were easy to use. A touchscreen shows a map of the line and you select your destination. Thailand has both older and newer (plastic) bills in circulation, but the machines only take the newer bills. The bills we received at the currency exchange were the older type so we ended up just buying the tokens at the staffed ticket booth.



We arrived at [our hotel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/eXLFH98bu11g5Sxp9) and checked in right away because we had booked our arrival for the previous day (Dec 28). Definitely worth it being able to shower ASAP after a long flight. This hotel had a (smallish) rooftop pool and great hot water in the shower. Only complaint here is that the bathroom did have some sewage smells, which we did encounter at a number of accommodations on this trip. When we booked, we paid the few extra dollars to have breakfast included and it was well worth it. This hotel had the largest and best breakfast buffet of anywhere we stayed. Mix of Thai and Western options, all delicious. Good, hot coffee. 



Things we did/places we visited:

* [Wat Arun](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LJMmo7Qk6sKSnXzZ9). If you’re on the east side of the Chao Phraya river, and you navigate to [Suppaniga Eating Room](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mBCKDoLWwbyBEAkd6), to the right is a sign directing you to the boat to go across the river to Wat Arun. The boat ride was short, maybe 5 minutes. Wat Arun was one of my favourite temples. Our timing meant we were there at the hottest time of day, which I would recommend against, as there is very little shade. 
* [The Grand Palace Complex](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jNPK7T2QWu27uoT16). So beautiful! Your ticket includes the Queen Sirikit Textile Museum which is a nice break from the sun.
* [Museum Siam](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yqMdRNAy2fbkv1yd8). This was a nice quiet break. 10/10 concept, 7/10 execution. You could skip it.
* [Wat Pho](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MVNs1z9NQ5w9mxwQ7). Like the Grand Palace, there is actually a complex of buildings, not just a single temple. We enjoyed it!
* [Song Wat Road.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7JRFixngBB9fLMv78) A great place to explore, check out cute cafes, go shopping for unique souvenirs. 
* [Chinatown.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/iW2Um9m89tzVdrRs7) Wandered into Chinatown after Song Wat Road and it was quite a bit busier. Lots of great inexpensive food options in the area.
* [Erawan Museum.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GGmxWbx23ar8xVav9) A bit out of the way but we got there easily via the BTS (Skytrain). 



Notable eating:

* [Suppaniga Eating Room](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mBCKDoLWwbyBEAkd6). Reservations recommended, especially for dinner. We showed up for lunch without a reservation and waited maybe 15 minutes. The air conditioned dining room has views of Wat Arun. This was probably the priciest meal of our entire trip but well worth it. Great cocktails as well. There is an upstairs open air patio, but I believe it only opens for dinner as it was closed when we were there, and it was too hot for it anyway.



New Year’s Eve:

We went to [FVTURE](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aJHMLkpyAof4RjDF7), a new club that just opened on Jan 30. For NYE, they had Marten Horger headlining, who we really enjoy. The club wasn’t very busy for the NYE countdown (I assume people went elsewhere) but started to fill up at 2/3am. Surprisingly, by the time we left around 3:30, there wasn’t many food options open around RCA Alley (where many of the clubs are located) or around our hotel. We ended up trekking to a 24 hour Burger King. In hindsight we should’ve just ordered food for delivery via Grab, which is convenient and has lots of options.



Things we didn’t do that I would try to do next time:

* [Lost in Thaislation cocktail bar. ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xGh2wFWFGLb1GHEs7)
* [A Chef’s Tour Food Tour.](https://achefstour.com/tour/bangkok-food-tour) I didn’t get on this fast enough so by the time I went to book, it was full. I’ve heard great things about this food tour company that has operations throughout the world and in particular SEA.
* [Wat Sam Phran](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XStWuoGxeVJAvTwB9)
* [Golden Mount/Wat Saket](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yD6S6xhz9gsB7d8U8)

  


We got everywhere with a combination of the BTS (Skytrain), MRT (metro), Grab, Bolt, and our feet. We found it pretty easy and affordable to get around. Besides the short boat ride across the river to Wat Arun, we didn’t take any river ferries. I would’ve liked to do so, but I found it difficult to find information about routes, schedule, etc. 

  


**Sukhothai**

**Jan 1-3**



On Jan 1 we took the long distance train from Bangkok to Phitsanulok. These trains are operated by Thai State Railway. You can buy tickets in advance on their website, on their app,  or in person. I recommend [the app.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dticket&pcampaignid=web_share) The full route is Bangkok to Chiang Mai, and people travelling the full distance get first dibs when ticket booking opens 90 days in advance. 1st and 2nd class sleeping berths on the overnight trains do sell out so it’s worthwhile to book in advance. 



If you’re going something like 50% or more of the full route distance you can book 60 days in advance. Since we were travelling a smaller portion, we could only book 30 days out. Because of this, and because we didn’t want to leave too early in the morning after NYE, our options were a bit limited. We ended up taking a 2pm train in the third class seats, which got us to Phitsanulok at around 8pm. This was not an express train, otherwise the usual time is less.



Third class does not have AC. The windows were open, and so with the breeze it wasn’t overly hot. Especially as it went into the evening, it actually got a bit chilly at the end. I enjoyed looking out the window, however with the train speed blew lots of dust into the air so we were a bit grimy by the time we arrived. Hawkers got on regularly selling pop, water, snacks, and meals. Our train left on time and arrived on time.



Phitsanulok is more of a transit town than a destination, but there are plenty of food options and whatever else you might need (including a small market) right outside the train station. We got a bite to eat and called a Grab to take us the 1 hour journey to our accommodation in Sukhothai. We did have a couple drivers cancel on us due to the distance, but got one after not too long a wait. If you want peace of mind, you might be better off pre-arranging transportation through your accommodation if you choose to come in through Phitsanulok. I believe there are also scheduled mini buses from Phitsanulok to Sukhothai, but we arrived too late in the day to make that an option. 



We checked into [Thai Thai Sukhothai Resort.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RSb9KdEJCoNyWdQ86) I highly recommend this place. It was very affordable, cute, and comfortable. The staff were very friendly and helpful. We had breakfast included, which was buffet style and a mix of Western and Thai options. Not a big selection, but good. There is a pool, which is across the street. When we went, in the middle of a hot afternoon, there were only two other people there. 



We rented bicycles from the hotel to cycle around the town and [Sukhothai Historical Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DmyziLp3xaogFAGv5), the main attraction. The bikes were fixed gear and in varying condition. I would suggest checking out other rental places in town for more comfortable, better maintained options. We spent our first full day cycling around the historical park. It’s a huge ancient city complex that spans many acres. We bought the full access ticket which includes all the different “zones”. It would be difficult to see every single ruin in one day, but many of them are quite deteriorated to the point where there isn’t much to see, so I think one day is enough. I recommend doing a quick Google search of which sites you want to prioritize and marking them on your map. 



There is a very nice little [market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BLwRwZDwJqsMTJoD7) (mostly food) that’s open weekend evenings that is just inside of the park gates. I assumed they would just block off a section of the park and the market would be open to all - I was wrong. After our day exploring the park, we returned to our hotel to take a dip in the pool. We went back to the park to check out the market for dinner and discovered that while market access (like park access) is free for locals, foreigners are required to pay the full entrance fee, but you can reuse the ticket you purchased earlier in the day. We had mistakenly left our tickets at the hotel and had to go back to get them. I do recommend visiting the market. There were mostly locals there. People bring picnic blankets and set up to watch the sunset. We had lots of delicious and inexpensive food there. 



We booked a private driver through our hotel for 1900 THB to take us around [Si Satchanalai Historical Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/17GNsRVk7YNV4tXd9) the next day. This ancient city complex is similar to Sukhothai park but smaller and way less busy. We regularly looked around and realized we were the only ones around. Si Satchanalai is more forested and secluded and so provided a different experience. There’s a little food court within the park to grab lunch. You can rent bikes there too, but we found it fine to explore on foot. Especially since some sections are not navigable by bike anyway, you’d have to get off and walk and retrieve the bike, we found walking preferable.



After Si Satchanalai, our driver dropped us off at the bus station in New Sukhothai town, where we got a bus to Phitsanulok. We bought the tickets at the station. Buses leave every hour or so. We could’ve taken a taxi but our train wasn’t leaving until late so we were in no rush. 



We had time to kill so decided to do laundry at the laundromat. The place we went to had machines that automatically dispenses laundry detergent and fabric softener. Convenient but not great if you have sensitive skin like me. Later in the trip we found laundromats where you bring your own detergent and we were able to get some [D Nee brand baby detergent from 7-11](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ6YDlwRT0f67K0h2c5H7igrVOPmtNVa_a37Q&s). This was the only brand I was able to find without a strong scent. Usually on a trip I’d bring [laundry detergent sheets](https://well.ca/products/nature-clean-laundry-detergent_186350.html?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=20454905960&gbraid=0AAAAAD-k6EWS74fyxbpoDKAIkJFt_dLKt&gclid=Cj0KCQiAkPzLBhD4ARIsAGfah8h_nOK0qqMcX540JyM-rcUt1ksHeJejfQI4uF93lwvP4R0-XPxI_2YaAijpEALw_wcB), which take up hardly any space, but I forgot this time.



Phitsanulok train station has a left luggage counter, so we dropped our bags there so we could explore and get dinner. Then we took the train (2nd class, AC sleeper this time) overnight to Chiang Mai. We got a pretty good sleep. The lights on the train stay on in 2nd class, but the curtains do a decent job of dimming them. I’d do it again. At 7am, everyone gets up so the train staff can flip the beds back to regular seat mode. Our train left on time and arrived on time. Looking at the info screen at the train station, the trains seemed to generally be on time. If they were late, it seems to only be by 5-10 minutes. Before our trip we heard a lot about late trains so this was a pleasant surprise!



Notable eating:

On the main street of Old Sukhothai is this [little hole in the wall place](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EtVCvCTbhixJvmNZA) selling the eponymous Sukhothai Noodles. For two bowls of noodles, a water, and a coke, I think we paid 120 THB. This was one of the most delicious meals we ate the entire trip.



**Chiang Rai**

**Jan 4-6**



We arrived at the Chiang Mai train station, and walked to bus terminal 3. We had bought bus tickets online in advance through [FairFair.](https://fairfair.co.th/en) We booked the VIP bus to Chiang Rai, which was comfortable and spacious. The bus AC was quite cold so wear a sweater! After the heat of Bangkok and Sukhothai, it was noticeably colder as we went north. The VIP bus has a washroom on board and so doesn’t stop, making it slightly faster than the regular bus. There was construction on the route so I think we were 20-30 minutes late arriving in Chiang Rai.



We checked into [Grandma Kaew House.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/27DujX9FSJQetm7w7) This place was cheap and cheerful, in a good location.



Things we did/places we visited:

* [Wat Huay Pla Kang](https://maps.app.goo.gl/AFFvYoVUTTpsFcBeA). This temple has a giant Guanyin statue on a hill that you can go inside of. Great sunset views from inside and outside of the temple. This temple was free, but you need to pay to take the elevator to the top. There is no option to take the stairs.
* [Baan Dam Museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SxXfGfYV4BmQ9eBs5) (The Black Temple) While this is called the Black Temple it is not a religious location. It is more of an art exhibition. I thought it was okay but not necessarily worth the price of admission, while my husband thought it was cool. It was designed by Thawan Duchanee, who was an interesting character.
* [Wat Rong Khun](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4dtH7C6W4ZEnQDvP8) (The White Temple) Beautiful! We enjoyed it here.
* [Rong Suea Ten Temple](https://maps.app.goo.gl/AMwngsp8E4MCoEjKA) (The Blue Temple). Free to visit. We came in the evening and it was lit up beautifully. There’s a small museum, but we weren’t able to visit as it was only open until 5pm although the temple is open later. Inside the temple was very quiet and serene while we were there.
* Coffee shops. The Chiang Rai region grows coffee, so we were able to get really incredible coffee basically everywhere. Our favourite was [1:2 Chiangrai](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rMecSD8BU8b5jYBF9). They have a few locations.
* Sunsets. We enjoyed some beautiful sunsets here. First at Wat Huay Pla Kang and then at [RTCR Rooftop Bar.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/t92VdWFuuLEAxX9k6)
* Markets. Chiang Rai has a few different night markets. They’re a good mix of food and shopping and we didn’t find them overly crowded or overly touristy. 



The temples listed above are not really close together. Some people recommend joining a tour or paying a private driver to see them all in one day. We opted to take Grab/Bolt between them and go at our own pace over two days, and I was happy with this choice. 



I could see us returning to Chiang Rai in the future to spend more time exploring the natural attractions outside of the city.



Notable eating: We had a fantastic meal at [Barrab restaurant.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XhP3DpnMufDNsGyK6) Very small place, indoor seating only. We were able to get in without a reservation, but those that came after us were turned away. Worth stopping by the day before and making a reservation if you can.

  


**Chiang Mai**

**Jan 6-11**



From Chiang Rai we took the VIP bus back to Chiang Mai. We stayed at [Tanita House](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sh1yhrtaZE4SaMCK9), which I highly recommend. It’s a quiet oasis in the busy city. While it’s not right in the confines of the old city, it’s quite close and overall I think the location was good. The owner is really sweet. Breakfast is included with bacon, eggs, and toast made to order.



Things we did/places we visited:

* [Wat Phra Lat](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GtDXDRNfTkmoXgfP6) \+ [Doi Suthep](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CWEAn3URY5K8UW9LA) via the [Monk’s Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/thailand/chiang-mai/doi-suthep-monk-trail?u=m&sh=ucre6w). We started with breakfast at [Basecamp Trail Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XeYEDi11P7fQZtkN9), before walking down to the trailhead, where we bought a national park entrance ticket. The trail was very steep and pretty challenging at times, especially the section after Wat Phra Lat. If you follow the path on AllTrails, the last section takes you on the road for a bit. It’s windy and steep, with no shoulder to speak of. If you zoom in on the map, you’ll see a side trail to enter the back way. We did this and it was quiet and shaded. Once we reached Doi Suthep, we relaxed and explored for a bit. We exited through the main entrance, which opens out to an area with some shops, food, and plenty of songthaews. We got a taxi back into the city from there instead of hiking back down. Unlike some other national parks in Thailand, you do not need a guide to explore  this park, as far as we can tell.
* [Zabb E Lee Thai Cooking School](https://maps.app.goo.gl/w6DZvgAE4QN5Tztj6). Highly, highly recommended! You get to cook and eat a 5 course meal. Our teacher Amy was super fun, friendly, and knowledgeable about food. The whole experience was extremely well organized.
* [Baan Kang Wat Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/F2sfQJmzQLZDwuoG9). Relatively large pedestrian-only craft market. We found some great souvenirs here. Very cute place to walk around, grab some food or a coffee and do some shopping.
* More temples! We spent the good part of a day exploring the city and exploring some of its more popular temples. I don’t have any particular suggestions, as there are many, and deciding which, if any, are worth stopping at depends on the traveler. 
* [Kalm Village](https://maps.app.goo.gl/u7BcsPcNWkgZWd7t5). This complex includes some small shops and museum exhibits. A nice place to take a break from the busyness of the city. While we didn’t have a chance to attend, it looks like they host some cools workshops and yoga classes.
* [Elephant Nature Park.](https://www.elephantnaturepark.org/) My partner loves elephants and wanted to see them while in Thailand. I spent quite a bit of time doing research to try and find a sanctuary we felt was ethical. I can definitely vouch for Elephant Nature Park. Ultimately, I think the only truly ethical living for elephants is in the wild. In the case of Elephant Nature Park, the elephants housed there are former working elephants who need somewhere to live out the remainder of their lives following the decline of the logging and elephant riding industries.
* [Doi Inthanon.](https://www.getyourguide.com/chiang-mai-l271/chiang-mai-doi-inthanon-park-with-kew-mae-pan-hike-day-trip-t655465/?ranking_uuid=9571b2d6-457f-4875-8668-50e6041547f0&_pc=1%2C2) This national park is tricky to get to without your own transportation, so we booked a tour to visit. Like many national parks in Thailand, you are restricted with the trails you can hike without a guide, so it’s convenient to book a tour for that reason as well. We picked this one in particular because it includes a hike on the Kew Mae Pan trail, which has particularly beautiful views.



Notable eating: [Dash Teak House.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tTumdJnwPhtbax6h8) Great food, cocktails, friendly service. We showed up without a reservation and only had to wait about 15 minutes. Also [สมบูรณ์ใจ SomboonJai](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yRHbrMDRGMbXL9oo8). We went here after visiting Baan Kang Wat. It was inexpensive and absolutely delicious. Great home cooked food.

  


**Khao Sok National Park**

**Jan 11-14**



We took a taxi to the Chiang Mai airport and caught a domestic flight to Surat Thani. We had booked a stay at [Monkey Mansion Jungalows](https://maps.app.goo.gl/f16zdRBfWYY71RUR6) and arranged in advance for them to pick us up from the airport. We booked the 3 night [classic package](https://www.monkeymansion-khaosok-jungalows.com/khao-sok-tours/classic-package/) and had a great time. There is an on site restaurant and breakfast and lunch was included in our stay, with dinner being billed separately.



Many people come to Khao Sok to stay in the overwater bungalows on Cheow Lan Lake. After reading really mixed reviews for all but the most luxurious options, I wasn’t sure it was worth the hype or the price tag. So we decided on the classic package that included a day trip to the lake, but no overnight. 



Day One

* Arrived at the resort and checked into our bungalow. This was our only accommodation in Thailand without air conditioning. This was actually not a problem since we were outside during the day doing activities, and in the evenings, the weather cooled significantly. Make sure to bring some warm layers if you stay here because the bedding was pretty minimal even after we asked for extra blankets! The bungalows are open air, with lots of room for small critters to get inside (for us, mostly geckos, and one monster bug). The shower here had great hot water and looked out into the jungle scenery - very cool!
* Had an early dinner, then left on the night hike. We were taken to the national park trailhead with a small group (myself, my partner, and one other), where we bought our tickets and met our guide. Our guide Mint was very knowledgeable about the park’s wildlife and helped us spot spiders, scorpions, and monkeys.

Day Two

* We were taken back to the trailhead in a small group (4 of us total) and met back up with our guide Mint. We did a half day hike along a different trail, again spotting many critters, including civet cats. We had a chance to relax at a beautiful swimming area in the jungle.
* After lunch, we went bamboo rafting down the river, in the same small group. This was peaceful and relaxing, with great views of the scenery. We stopped at a cool rock formation and had “bamboo coffee”.

Day Three

* This was the day of the Cheow Lan Lake tour. From what I can gather, no matter which tour company or hotel you book through, everyone ends up put into larger groups with tours led by national park guides. The exception being if you were to book a private tour. A mini van brought us from Monkey Mansion to the pier. From here, we were put into a larger group. We took a long tail boat to one of the overwater bungalow rafts where we had lunch. Then we were given the option to stay at the raft to kayak and swim, or to go on a hike. We chose the hike, but after the other hikes we had been on, it was pretty disappointing. Not much to see. I would choose the kayaking instead if I were to do it again. Then we went to see a cave, which people seemed to like but I’m a bit claustrophobic so it wasn’t my favourite! Overall the scenery at the lake was beautiful, but the organization of the tour was lacking.



Overall, I would recommend Khao Sok as a great destination for outdoorsy types who enjoy beautiful nature, physical activity, and who don’t need a lot of amenities. Most of the accommodations here are grouped around Khlong Sok village. This small village consists of one main road and exists exclusively to cater to tourists (Thai and international) who are visiting the park. The village doesn’t have much in the way of things to see or do, so we spent our down time relaxing at our accommodation when we weren’t doing activities.



On the day we left, we had booked a driver to take us to Donsak Pier to head to our next destination. We had arranged (for an additional fee) to have the driver stop at [Khao Na Nai Luang Dharma Park.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tWMuXCoGtyqv9S6g8) It was right on the way, so a nice little detour that I would definitely recommend. While we encountered other visitors, it was not busy at all. There’s a little stall at the bottom with snacks and drinks. I’d definitely recommend getting some coconut ice cream.

  


**Koh Phangan**

**Jan 14-18**



When we arrived at Donsak Pier, we got a bite to eat at one of the food stalls. It was fine, but not a great selection. I’d recommend eating elsewhere if you can. From there we took a Lomprayah catamaran to Thong Sala on Koh Phangan.



From there we got some lunch and then took a songthaew to our accommodation. We stayed at [Sand Terrace Beach Bungalows](https://maps.app.goo.gl/P7WQt4Fr5sCctahP7). This was by far the most expensive accommodation of the trip, but it was well worth it to be right on the beach. We were also close to some of the music venues we wanted to visit, so we were happy with the location.



Things we did:

* [Oxa Jungle Party. ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uVxK4AoGzuPowm7o7)Three stages (house, latin/commercial, techno). We saw Mat.Joe here and had a fun time. The crowd was mainly early 20s-early 30s foreigners. Pretty good vibes!
* [Retro Mountain Jungle Club.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7dTafm5pC79oDgZX8) Two stages. When we were there, the main stage was playing techno. The crowd was really fun and diverse. A good mix of locals and foreigners. You can get mushroom shakes and nitrous at the bars here if that’s your thing. 
* Hiked to the [Bottle Beach viewpoint.](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/thailand/surat-thani/bottle-beach-viewpoint-khao-baan-fai-mai-peak?u=m&sh=ucre6w) We got here by taking a songthaew to the trailhead, hiked uphill to the viewpoint, and then downhill to Bottle Beach. This is *definitely* the way to go. We saw some people coming up from Bottle Beach, but that direction is extremely steep and rugged. Going down wasn’t the easiest, but still much better than uphill. At the beach we were rewarded with beautiful views and plenty of space to enjoy. There are a couple small resorts and beach bars, but they are not too imposing on the beach area. From the beach we took a longtail boat to Chaloklum beach, and from there we took a songthaew back to our accommodation. 



In advance of our trip we read about the “taxi mafia” in Koh Phangan being the reason there is no Grab or Bolt. We used these apps often in the rest of the country and found them affordable and convenient. We came prepared to haggle for songthaews and to pay more than we had previously for transportation. That said, by the end of our time on the island, we were pretty tired of the songthaew rigamarole. 



While I know many will suggest that we should’ve rented a scooter, I’m glad we didn’t. Neither of us had driven one before, and an island comprised of hilly, windy, sometimes poorly maintained roads filled with drunk travellers didn’t seem like a great place to learn. That said, if you are looking to rent a bike, you’ll have a much easier time getting around. If you are traveling with a group, it might be worth considering hiring a minivan and driver at a daily rate and have them take you wherever you want to go. Splitting the cost, it would probably be cheaper and more convenient than most other options.



Notable eating: [Fisherman’s Restaurant and Bar.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qTEEZmdLipmLHsA49) Great food and ambiance in the back patio area. Pricey but worth it. Fantastic cocktails as well. No space the first time we tried to go, so we booked a reservation for the next night. We also had a delicious and inexpensive meal with really friendly service at [Lotto Bar & Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5PwsvPLq6xUtxouj7).



While we made the most of it, we both agreed Koh Phangan was our least favourite destination on the trip. We generally felt that we paid more for less, compared to elsewhere in Thailand. However we did choose this island because we wanted to listen to some house and techno in the jungle, and Koh Phangan did deliver on that front. Worth mentioning that the full moon party in Haad Rin was not scheduled during the time we were there. I think this was for the best as I understand the island can get quite overcrowded at those times. 

  


**Bangkok**

**Jan 18-19**



We left Koh Phangan on a Lomprayah catamaran back to Donsak Pier. This time we booked the combo ferry-bus ticket, so when we got off the boat at the pier, we were shuttled onto a bus that took us into Surat Thani Tapee Pier. You can also take the Lomprayah bus from Donsak directly to the airport or the train station. 



We chose to go to Tapee Pier because it seemed to us that that was the closest bus destination to downtown. That said, it was actually a bit out of the way still so we ended up getting a Grab into town. Because we had time to kill before our evening flight, we thought we’d go into Surat Thani Town, get some food, and explore a bit before heading to the airport. The bus ran late so we didn’t have much time after getting some lunch, so we took a Grab to the Surat Thani Airport. From there we caught a domestic flight to BKK. 



We didn’t have a lot of time between landing in BKK, and needing to be back at the airport the next morning for our flight home, so we opted to stay at [The Park Nine Hotel ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/K6ohKBMoTgC7zM2M7)due to its proximity to the airport. It is only a short drive away, and the hotel offers free hourly shuttle services to and from the airport. The timing of these worked out perfectly for us. 



Overall we had a great time and we are looking forward to returning to Southeast Asia in the future. We’re considering Vietnam next. Or perhaps Laos/Cambodia.



Let me know if you have any questions about my itinerary or experience - happy to share 🙂

1r1mlsx,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThailandTourism/comments/1r1mlsx/our_three_week_thailand_trip_as_first_time/,Our three week Thailand trip as first time visitors,"My partner and I (M+F early 30s) recently returned from a 3 week trip to Thailand. It was our first foray to Southeast Asia and we will definitely be back. Here’s a rundown of our itinerary with my notes and suggestions.



Summary

* Bangkok: 3 nights (4 if you count the additional night I booked to check in early)
* Sukhothai: 3 nights
* Overnight train: 1 night
* Chiang Rai: 2 nights
* Chiang Mai: 5 nights
* Khao Sok: 3 nights
* Koh Phangan: 4 nights
* Bangkok: 1 night



**Bangkok** 

**Dec 29-Jan 1**



Arrived early in the morning at BKK airport. Baggage claim was quick. At immigration we waited maybe 30 minutes? Make sure to complete your [TDAC](https://tdac.immigration.go.th/arrival-card/) in advance for smooth entry. 



We followed the signs to the airport rail link to get into the city. Contactless payment is possible with a credit card. There’s also machines that dispense single-use payment tokens. The machines were easy to use. A touchscreen shows a map of the line and you select your destination. Thailand has both older and newer (plastic) bills in circulation, but the machines only take the newer bills. The bills we received at the currency exchange were the older type so we ended up just buying the tokens at the staffed ticket booth.



We arrived at [our hotel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/eXLFH98bu11g5Sxp9) and checked in right away because we had booked our arrival for the previous day (Dec 28). Definitely worth it being able to shower ASAP after a long flight. This hotel had a (smallish) rooftop pool and great hot water in the shower. Only complaint here is that the bathroom did have some sewage smells, which we did encounter at a number of accommodations on this trip. When we booked, we paid the few extra dollars to have breakfast included and it was well worth it. This hotel had the largest and best breakfast buffet of anywhere we stayed. Mix of Thai and Western options, all delicious. Good, hot coffee. 



Things we did/places we visited:

* [Wat Arun](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LJMmo7Qk6sKSnXzZ9). If you’re on the east side of the Chao Phraya river, and you navigate to [Suppaniga Eating Room](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mBCKDoLWwbyBEAkd6), to the right is a sign directing you to the boat to go across the river to Wat Arun. The boat ride was short, maybe 5 minutes. Wat Arun was one of my favourite temples. Our timing meant we were there at the hottest time of day, which I would recommend against, as there is very little shade. 
* [The Grand Palace Complex](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jNPK7T2QWu27uoT16). So beautiful! Your ticket includes the Queen Sirikit Textile Museum which is a nice break from the sun.
* [Museum Siam](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yqMdRNAy2fbkv1yd8). This was a nice quiet break. 10/10 concept, 7/10 execution. You could skip it.
* [Wat Pho](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MVNs1z9NQ5w9mxwQ7). Like the Grand Palace, there is actually a complex of buildings, not just a single temple. We enjoyed it!
* [Song Wat Road.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7JRFixngBB9fLMv78) A great place to explore, check out cute cafes, go shopping for unique souvenirs. 
* [Chinatown.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/iW2Um9m89tzVdrRs7) Wandered into Chinatown after Song Wat Road and it was quite a bit busier. Lots of great inexpensive food options in the area.
* [Erawan Museum.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GGmxWbx23ar8xVav9) A bit out of the way but we got there easily via the BTS (Skytrain). 



Notable eating:

* [Suppaniga Eating Room](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mBCKDoLWwbyBEAkd6). Reservations recommended, especially for dinner. We showed up for lunch without a reservation and waited maybe 15 minutes. The air conditioned dining room has views of Wat Arun. This was probably the priciest meal of our entire trip but well worth it. Great cocktails as well. There is an upstairs open air patio, but I believe it only opens for dinner as it was closed when we were there, and it was too hot for it anyway.



New Year’s Eve:

We went to [FVTURE](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aJHMLkpyAof4RjDF7), a new club that just opened on Jan 30. For NYE, they had Marten Horger headlining, who we really enjoy. The club wasn’t very busy for the NYE countdown (I assume people went elsewhere) but started to fill up at 2/3am. Surprisingly, by the time we left around 3:30, there wasn’t many food options open around RCA Alley (where many of the clubs are located) or around our hotel. We ended up trekking to a 24 hour Burger King. In hindsight we should’ve just ordered food for delivery via Grab, which is convenient and has lots of options.



Things we didn’t do that I would try to do next time:

* [Lost in Thaislation cocktail bar. ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xGh2wFWFGLb1GHEs7)
* [A Chef’s Tour Food Tour.](https://achefstour.com/tour/bangkok-food-tour) I didn’t get on this fast enough so by the time I went to book, it was full. I’ve heard great things about this food tour company that has operations throughout the world and in particular SEA.
* [Wat Sam Phran](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XStWuoGxeVJAvTwB9)
* [Golden Mount/Wat Saket](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yD6S6xhz9gsB7d8U8)

  


We got everywhere with a combination of the BTS (Skytrain), MRT (metro), Grab, Bolt, and our feet. We found it pretty easy and affordable to get around. Besides the short boat ride across the river to Wat Arun, we didn’t take any river ferries. I would’ve liked to do so, but I found it difficult to find information about routes, schedule, etc. 

  


**Sukhothai**

**Jan 1-3**



On Jan 1 we took the long distance train from Bangkok to Phitsanulok. These trains are operated by Thai State Railway. You can buy tickets in advance on their website, on their app,  or in person. I recommend [the app.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dticket&pcampaignid=web_share) The full route is Bangkok to Chiang Mai, and people travelling the full distance get first dibs when ticket booking opens 90 days in advance. 1st and 2nd class sleeping berths on the overnight trains do sell out so it’s worthwhile to book in advance. 



If you’re going something like 50% or more of the full route distance you can book 60 days in advance. Since we were travelling a smaller portion, we could only book 30 days out. Because of this, and because we didn’t want to leave too early in the morning after NYE, our options were a bit limited. We ended up taking a 2pm train in the third class seats, which got us to Phitsanulok at around 8pm. This was not an express train, otherwise the usual time is less.



Third class does not have AC. The windows were open, and so with the breeze it wasn’t overly hot. Especially as it went into the evening, it actually got a bit chilly at the end. I enjoyed looking out the window, however with the train speed blew lots of dust into the air so we were a bit grimy by the time we arrived. Hawkers got on regularly selling pop, water, snacks, and meals. Our train left on time and arrived on time.



Phitsanulok is more of a transit town than a destination, but there are plenty of food options and whatever else you might need (including a small market) right outside the train station. We got a bite to eat and called a Grab to take us the 1 hour journey to our accommodation in Sukhothai. We did have a couple drivers cancel on us due to the distance, but got one after not too long a wait. If you want peace of mind, you might be better off pre-arranging transportation through your accommodation if you choose to come in through Phitsanulok. I believe there are also scheduled mini buses from Phitsanulok to Sukhothai, but we arrived too late in the day to make that an option. 



We checked into [Thai Thai Sukhothai Resort.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RSb9KdEJCoNyWdQ86) I highly recommend this place. It was very affordable, cute, and comfortable. The staff were very friendly and helpful. We had breakfast included, which was buffet style and a mix of Western and Thai options. Not a big selection, but good. There is a pool, which is across the street. When we went, in the middle of a hot afternoon, there were only two other people there. 



We rented bicycles from the hotel to cycle around the town and [Sukhothai Historical Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DmyziLp3xaogFAGv5), the main attraction. The bikes were fixed gear and in varying condition. I would suggest checking out other rental places in town for more comfortable, better maintained options. We spent our first full day cycling around the historical park. It’s a huge ancient city complex that spans many acres. We bought the full access ticket which includes all the different “zones”. It would be difficult to see every single ruin in one day, but many of them are quite deteriorated to the point where there isn’t much to see, so I think one day is enough. I recommend doing a quick Google search of which sites you want to prioritize and marking them on your map. 



There is a very nice little [market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BLwRwZDwJqsMTJoD7) (mostly food) that’s open weekend evenings that is just inside of the park gates. I assumed they would just block off a section of the park and the market would be open to all - I was wrong. After our day exploring the park, we returned to our hotel to take a dip in the pool. We went back to the park to check out the market for dinner and discovered that while market access (like park access) is free for locals, foreigners are required to pay the full entrance fee, but you can reuse the ticket you purchased earlier in the day. We had mistakenly left our tickets at the hotel and had to go back to get them. I do recommend visiting the market. There were mostly locals there. People bring picnic blankets and set up to watch the sunset. We had lots of delicious and inexpensive food there. 



We booked a private driver through our hotel for 1900 THB to take us around [Si Satchanalai Historical Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/17GNsRVk7YNV4tXd9) the next day. This ancient city complex is similar to Sukhothai park but smaller and way less busy. We regularly looked around and realized we were the only ones around. Si Satchanalai is more forested and secluded and so provided a different experience. There’s a little food court within the park to grab lunch. You can rent bikes there too, but we found it fine to explore on foot. Especially since some sections are not navigable by bike anyway, you’d have to get off and walk and retrieve the bike, we found walking preferable.



After Si Satchanalai, our driver dropped us off at the bus station in New Sukhothai town, where we got a bus to Phitsanulok. We bought the tickets at the station. Buses leave every hour or so. We could’ve taken a taxi but our train wasn’t leaving until late so we were in no rush. 



We had time to kill so decided to do laundry at the laundromat. The place we went to had machines that automatically dispenses laundry detergent and fabric softener. Convenient but not great if you have sensitive skin like me. Later in the trip we found laundromats where you bring your own detergent and we were able to get some [D Nee brand baby detergent from 7-11](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ6YDlwRT0f67K0h2c5H7igrVOPmtNVa_a37Q&s). This was the only brand I was able to find without a strong scent. Usually on a trip I’d bring [laundry detergent sheets](https://well.ca/products/nature-clean-laundry-detergent_186350.html?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=20454905960&gbraid=0AAAAAD-k6EWS74fyxbpoDKAIkJFt_dLKt&gclid=Cj0KCQiAkPzLBhD4ARIsAGfah8h_nOK0qqMcX540JyM-rcUt1ksHeJejfQI4uF93lwvP4R0-XPxI_2YaAijpEALw_wcB), which take up hardly any space, but I forgot this time.



Phitsanulok train station has a left luggage counter, so we dropped our bags there so we could explore and get dinner. Then we took the train (2nd class, AC sleeper this time) overnight to Chiang Mai. We got a pretty good sleep. The lights on the train stay on in 2nd class, but the curtains do a decent job of dimming them. I’d do it again. At 7am, everyone gets up so the train staff can flip the beds back to regular seat mode. Our train left on time and arrived on time. Looking at the info screen at the train station, the trains seemed to generally be on time. If they were late, it seems to only be by 5-10 minutes. Before our trip we heard a lot about late trains so this was a pleasant surprise!



Notable eating:

On the main street of Old Sukhothai is this [little hole in the wall place](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EtVCvCTbhixJvmNZA) selling the eponymous Sukhothai Noodles. For two bowls of noodles, a water, and a coke, I think we paid 120 THB. This was one of the most delicious meals we ate the entire trip.



**Chiang Rai**

**Jan 4-6**



We arrived at the Chiang Mai train station, and walked to bus terminal 3. We had bought bus tickets online in advance through [FairFair.](https://fairfair.co.th/en) We booked the VIP bus to Chiang Rai, which was comfortable and spacious. The bus AC was quite cold so wear a sweater! After the heat of Bangkok and Sukhothai, it was noticeably colder as we went north. The VIP bus has a washroom on board and so doesn’t stop, making it slightly faster than the regular bus. There was construction on the route so I think we were 20-30 minutes late arriving in Chiang Rai.



We checked into [Grandma Kaew House.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/27DujX9FSJQetm7w7) This place was cheap and cheerful, in a good location.



Things we did/places we visited:

* [Wat Huay Pla Kang](https://maps.app.goo.gl/AFFvYoVUTTpsFcBeA). This temple has a giant Guanyin statue on a hill that you can go inside of. Great sunset views from inside and outside of the temple. This temple was free, but you need to pay to take the elevator to the top. There is no option to take the stairs.
* [Baan Dam Museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SxXfGfYV4BmQ9eBs5) (The Black Temple) While this is called the Black Temple it is not a religious location. It is more of an art exhibition. I thought it was okay but not necessarily worth the price of admission, while my husband thought it was cool. It was designed by Thawan Duchanee, who was an interesting character.
* [Wat Rong Khun](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4dtH7C6W4ZEnQDvP8) (The White Temple) Beautiful! We enjoyed it here.
* [Rong Suea Ten Temple](https://maps.app.goo.gl/AMwngsp8E4MCoEjKA) (The Blue Temple). Free to visit. We came in the evening and it was lit up beautifully. There’s a small museum, but we weren’t able to visit as it was only open until 5pm although the temple is open later. Inside the temple was very quiet and serene while we were there.
* Coffee shops. The Chiang Rai region grows coffee, so we were able to get really incredible coffee basically everywhere. Our favourite was [1:2 Chiangrai](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rMecSD8BU8b5jYBF9). They have a few locations.
* Sunsets. We enjoyed some beautiful sunsets here. First at Wat Huay Pla Kang and then at [RTCR Rooftop Bar.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/t92VdWFuuLEAxX9k6)
* Markets. Chiang Rai has a few different night markets. They’re a good mix of food and shopping and we didn’t find them overly crowded or overly touristy. 



The temples listed above are not really close together. Some people recommend joining a tour or paying a private driver to see them all in one day. We opted to take Grab/Bolt between them and go at our own pace over two days, and I was happy with this choice. 



I could see us returning to Chiang Rai in the future to spend more time exploring the natural attractions outside of the city.



Notable eating: We had a fantastic meal at [Barrab restaurant.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XhP3DpnMufDNsGyK6) Very small place, indoor seating only. We were able to get in without a reservation, but those that came after us were turned away. Worth stopping by the day before and making a reservation if you can.

  


**Chiang Mai**

**Jan 6-11**



From Chiang Rai we took the VIP bus back to Chiang Mai. We stayed at [Tanita House](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sh1yhrtaZE4SaMCK9), which I highly recommend. It’s a quiet oasis in the busy city. While it’s not right in the confines of the old city, it’s quite close and overall I think the location was good. The owner is really sweet. Breakfast is included with bacon, eggs, and toast made to order.



Things we did/places we visited:

* [Wat Phra Lat](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GtDXDRNfTkmoXgfP6) \+ [Doi Suthep](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CWEAn3URY5K8UW9LA) via the [Monk’s Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/thailand/chiang-mai/doi-suthep-monk-trail?u=m&sh=ucre6w). We started with breakfast at [Basecamp Trail Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XeYEDi11P7fQZtkN9), before walking down to the trailhead, where we bought a national park entrance ticket. The trail was very steep and pretty challenging at times, especially the section after Wat Phra Lat. If you follow the path on AllTrails, the last section takes you on the road for a bit. It’s windy and steep, with no shoulder to speak of. If you zoom in on the map, you’ll see a side trail to enter the back way. We did this and it was quiet and shaded. Once we reached Doi Suthep, we relaxed and explored for a bit. We exited through the main entrance, which opens out to an area with some shops, food, and plenty of songthaews. We got a taxi back into the city from there instead of hiking back down. Unlike some other national parks in Thailand, you do not need a guide to explore  this park, as far as we can tell.
* [Zabb E Lee Thai Cooking School](https://maps.app.goo.gl/w6DZvgAE4QN5Tztj6). Highly, highly recommended! You get to cook and eat a 5 course meal. Our teacher Amy was super fun, friendly, and knowledgeable about food. The whole experience was extremely well organized.
* [Baan Kang Wat Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/F2sfQJmzQLZDwuoG9). Relatively large pedestrian-only craft market. We found some great souvenirs here. Very cute place to walk around, grab some food or a coffee and do some shopping.
* More temples! We spent the good part of a day exploring the city and exploring some of its more popular temples. I don’t have any particular suggestions, as there are many, and deciding which, if any, are worth stopping at depends on the traveler. 
* [Kalm Village](https://maps.app.goo.gl/u7BcsPcNWkgZWd7t5). This complex includes some small shops and museum exhibits. A nice place to take a break from the busyness of the city. While we didn’t have a chance to attend, it looks like they host some cools workshops and yoga classes.
* [Elephant Nature Park.](https://www.elephantnaturepark.org/) My partner loves elephants and wanted to see them while in Thailand. I spent quite a bit of time doing research to try and find a sanctuary we felt was ethical. I can definitely vouch for Elephant Nature Park. Ultimately, I think the only truly ethical living for elephants is in the wild. In the case of Elephant Nature Park, the elephants housed there are former working elephants who need somewhere to live out the remainder of their lives following the decline of the logging and elephant riding industries.
* [Doi Inthanon.](https://www.getyourguide.com/chiang-mai-l271/chiang-mai-doi-inthanon-park-with-kew-mae-pan-hike-day-trip-t655465/?ranking_uuid=9571b2d6-457f-4875-8668-50e6041547f0&_pc=1%2C2) This national park is tricky to get to without your own transportation, so we booked a tour to visit. Like many national parks in Thailand, you are restricted with the trails you can hike without a guide, so it’s convenient to book a tour for that reason as well. We picked this one in particular because it includes a hike on the Kew Mae Pan trail, which has particularly beautiful views.



Notable eating: [Dash Teak House.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tTumdJnwPhtbax6h8) Great food, cocktails, friendly service. We showed up without a reservation and only had to wait about 15 minutes. Also [สมบูรณ์ใจ SomboonJai](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yRHbrMDRGMbXL9oo8). We went here after visiting Baan Kang Wat. It was inexpensive and absolutely delicious. Great home cooked food.

  


**Khao Sok National Park**

**Jan 11-14**



We took a taxi to the Chiang Mai airport and caught a domestic flight to Surat Thani. We had booked a stay at [Monkey Mansion Jungalows](https://maps.app.goo.gl/f16zdRBfWYY71RUR6) and arranged in advance for them to pick us up from the airport. We booked the 3 night [classic package](https://www.monkeymansion-khaosok-jungalows.com/khao-sok-tours/classic-package/) and had a great time. There is an on site restaurant and breakfast and lunch was included in our stay, with dinner being billed separately.



Many people come to Khao Sok to stay in the overwater bungalows on Cheow Lan Lake. After reading really mixed reviews for all but the most luxurious options, I wasn’t sure it was worth the hype or the price tag. So we decided on the classic package that included a day trip to the lake, but no overnight. 



Day One

* Arrived at the resort and checked into our bungalow. This was our only accommodation in Thailand without air conditioning. This was actually not a problem since we were outside during the day doing activities, and in the evenings, the weather cooled significantly. Make sure to bring some warm layers if you stay here because the bedding was pretty minimal even after we asked for extra blankets! The bungalows are open air, with lots of room for small critters to get inside (for us, mostly geckos, and one monster bug). The shower here had great hot water and looked out into the jungle scenery - very cool!
* Had an early dinner, then left on the night hike. We were taken to the national park trailhead with a small group (myself, my partner, and one other), where we bought our tickets and met our guide. Our guide Mint was very knowledgeable about the park’s wildlife and helped us spot spiders, scorpions, and monkeys.

Day Two

* We were taken back to the trailhead in a small group (4 of us total) and met back up with our guide Mint. We did a half day hike along a different trail, again spotting many critters, including civet cats. We had a chance to relax at a beautiful swimming area in the jungle.
* After lunch, we went bamboo rafting down the river, in the same small group. This was peaceful and relaxing, with great views of the scenery. We stopped at a cool rock formation and had “bamboo coffee”.

Day Three

* This was the day of the Cheow Lan Lake tour. From what I can gather, no matter which tour company or hotel you book through, everyone ends up put into larger groups with tours led by national park guides. The exception being if you were to book a private tour. A mini van brought us from Monkey Mansion to the pier. From here, we were put into a larger group. We took a long tail boat to one of the overwater bungalow rafts where we had lunch. Then we were given the option to stay at the raft to kayak and swim, or to go on a hike. We chose the hike, but after the other hikes we had been on, it was pretty disappointing. Not much to see. I would choose the kayaking instead if I were to do it again. Then we went to see a cave, which people seemed to like but I’m a bit claustrophobic so it wasn’t my favourite! Overall the scenery at the lake was beautiful, but the organization of the tour was lacking.



Overall, I would recommend Khao Sok as a great destination for outdoorsy types who enjoy beautiful nature, physical activity, and who don’t need a lot of amenities. Most of the accommodations here are grouped around Khlong Sok village. This small village consists of one main road and exists exclusively to cater to tourists (Thai and international) who are visiting the park. The village doesn’t have much in the way of things to see or do, so we spent our down time relaxing at our accommodation when we weren’t doing activities.



On the day we left, we had booked a driver to take us to Donsak Pier to head to our next destination. We had arranged (for an additional fee) to have the driver stop at [Khao Na Nai Luang Dharma Park.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tWMuXCoGtyqv9S6g8) It was right on the way, so a nice little detour that I would definitely recommend. While we encountered other visitors, it was not busy at all. There’s a little stall at the bottom with snacks and drinks. I’d definitely recommend getting some coconut ice cream.

  


**Koh Phangan**

**Jan 14-18**



When we arrived at Donsak Pier, we got a bite to eat at one of the food stalls. It was fine, but not a great selection. I’d recommend eating elsewhere if you can. From there we took a Lomprayah catamaran to Thong Sala on Koh Phangan.



From there we got some lunch and then took a songthaew to our accommodation. We stayed at [Sand Terrace Beach Bungalows](https://maps.app.goo.gl/P7WQt4Fr5sCctahP7). This was by far the most expensive accommodation of the trip, but it was well worth it to be right on the beach. We were also close to some of the music venues we wanted to visit, so we were happy with the location.



Things we did:

* [Oxa Jungle Party. ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uVxK4AoGzuPowm7o7)Three stages (house, latin/commercial, techno). We saw Mat.Joe here and had a fun time. The crowd was mainly early 20s-early 30s foreigners. Pretty good vibes!
* [Retro Mountain Jungle Club.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7dTafm5pC79oDgZX8) Two stages. When we were there, the main stage was playing techno. The crowd was really fun and diverse. A good mix of locals and foreigners. You can get mushroom shakes and nitrous at the bars here if that’s your thing. 
* Hiked to the [Bottle Beach viewpoint.](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/thailand/surat-thani/bottle-beach-viewpoint-khao-baan-fai-mai-peak?u=m&sh=ucre6w) We got here by taking a songthaew to the trailhead, hiked uphill to the viewpoint, and then downhill to Bottle Beach. This is *definitely* the way to go. We saw some people coming up from Bottle Beach, but that direction is extremely steep and rugged. Going down wasn’t the easiest, but still much better than uphill. At the beach we were rewarded with beautiful views and plenty of space to enjoy. There are a couple small resorts and beach bars, but they are not too imposing on the beach area. From the beach we took a longtail boat to Chaloklum beach, and from there we took a songthaew back to our accommodation. 



In advance of our trip we read about the “taxi mafia” in Koh Phangan being the reason there is no Grab or Bolt. We used these apps often in the rest of the country and found them affordable and convenient. We came prepared to haggle for songthaews and to pay more than we had previously for transportation. That said, by the end of our time on the island, we were pretty tired of the songthaew rigamarole. 



While I know many will suggest that we should’ve rented a scooter, I’m glad we didn’t. Neither of us had driven one before, and an island comprised of hilly, windy, sometimes poorly maintained roads filled with drunk travellers didn’t seem like a great place to learn. That said, if you are looking to rent a bike, you’ll have a much easier time getting around. If you are traveling with a group, it might be worth considering hiring a minivan and driver at a daily rate and have them take you wherever you want to go. Splitting the cost, it would probably be cheaper and more convenient than most other options.



Notable eating: [Fisherman’s Restaurant and Bar.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qTEEZmdLipmLHsA49) Great food and ambiance in the back patio area. Pricey but worth it. Fantastic cocktails as well. No space the first time we tried to go, so we booked a reservation for the next night. We also had a delicious and inexpensive meal with really friendly service at [Lotto Bar & Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5PwsvPLq6xUtxouj7).



While we made the most of it, we both agreed Koh Phangan was our least favourite destination on the trip. We generally felt that we paid more for less, compared to elsewhere in Thailand. However we did choose this island because we wanted to listen to some house and techno in the jungle, and Koh Phangan did deliver on that front. Worth mentioning that the full moon party in Haad Rin was not scheduled during the time we were there. I think this was for the best as I understand the island can get quite overcrowded at those times. 

  


**Bangkok**

**Jan 18-19**



We left Koh Phangan on a Lomprayah catamaran back to Donsak Pier. This time we booked the combo ferry-bus ticket, so when we got off the boat at the pier, we were shuttled onto a bus that took us into Surat Thani Tapee Pier. You can also take the Lomprayah bus from Donsak directly to the airport or the train station. 



We chose to go to Tapee Pier because it seemed to us that that was the closest bus destination to downtown. That said, it was actually a bit out of the way still so we ended up getting a Grab into town. Because we had time to kill before our evening flight, we thought we’d go into Surat Thani Town, get some food, and explore a bit before heading to the airport. The bus ran late so we didn’t have much time after getting some lunch, so we took a Grab to the Surat Thani Airport. From there we caught a domestic flight to BKK. 



We didn’t have a lot of time between landing in BKK, and needing to be back at the airport the next morning for our flight home, so we opted to stay at [The Park Nine Hotel ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/K6ohKBMoTgC7zM2M7)due to its proximity to the airport. It is only a short drive away, and the hotel offers free hourly shuttle services to and from the airport. The timing of these worked out perfectly for us. 



Overall we had a great time and we are looking forward to returning to Southeast Asia in the future. We’re considering Vietnam next. Or perhaps Laos/Cambodia.

Well I got the book and a few others, a really good haul actually, and then I decided to try to find a nice cozy bar to get some cocktails and a little bit of food and read for a bit, and you know, like, journal. I used to do this with full on pint glasses of coffee in San Francisco in 1993.

It's pretty funny that I ended up at Spats, which is an old bar on Shattuck in Berkeley, in the University area. This is actually a cool freaking bar. And there is no one in here on a weeknight, just a bunch of Asian kids looking at their phones and ordering some Yakitori skewers, which are actually really good, and then leaving.

1r1mirx,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/1r1mirx/betrayal_trauma_worth_staying_26m_33f/,Betrayal Trauma. Worth staying? 26M 33F,"Hello everyone,

Not really sure what I'm hoping to achieve by writing this post. Perhaps a place to vent, a place to journal or perhaps to seek advise? For the past year, I have really been struggling with pain, grief, anxiety, trust issues, vigilance, and lowered self-esteem and worth. It comes and goes in waves. But lately, it has been terribly worse. Perhaps I deserve it for what transpired. Sorry if it's long. I'm just going to word vomit stuff out.

It started when I met my partner in beginning of last year. Everything was amazing. Three dates in, I realized I wanted a serious relationship with her and so, I asked if she was seeing anyone else and if she wanted, I'd love to be exclusive with her. She agreed. I guess that was my first mistake because perhaps three dates in was too fast and premature. Second, the circumstances in which it was asked was not ideal and I recognize was from a position of vulnerability from her side, it was post-intimacy. Both reasons she points out whenever we have a conversation regarding my feelings. I deeply regret this and have apologized for it. Anyways, I was elated. 

I continue to plan meaningful dates and am consistent with my intentions and effort. We learn more about each other, become more physically and emotionally intimate. Become more involved with each others personal lives. It wasn't until Valentines week that I noticed things that made me suspicious, we would spend time together and she gets a text from an unsaved number asking  ""want to have valentines dinner?"" She's on her phone a lot (work & business) when we're together, and I just so happened to glance at the notification previews as they came. My heart sank and I thought not again (I've been cheated on before), but then I thought ""nah, she wouldn't. She agreed to be exclusive"". So I gave her the benefit of the doubt and carried on. But a part of me was screaming to trust my gut. The more I think about it, the more my mind says that perhaps she's not being forthcoming and honest about things.

It's been a week and it eats at me. I kept thinking about it. Then I do the most stupidest thing possible that I am not proud of and I deeply regret it. I went back on the apps and met someone else. I went on one date with this person but I felt guilty and terrible the whole time, so I didn't want to pursue anything further. But guess what? Of course Karma came back with a vengeance and she found out subsequently because I also matched with her colleague who of course told her. And I was posted on are we dating the same guy.

It was rough and emotional but we had a difficult conversation regarding this. Ultimately, she forgave me and gave me a second chance. We stayed together. She even gave me the go ahead to date other people to get it out of my system, but I declined. I will forever be sorry and deeply regret it for the rest of my life. Next few days I try to make amends and repair things. I even told her that if she wanted to date other people too then by all means go ahead, but please communicate with me. She denies the need to and reaffirms that we're exclusive and that she's NOT dating anybody else. 

But one night as we were sitting together, she was on her phone again, she gets another text from the unsaved number. A photo of the other guy on vacation, telling her he missed her and wished she was there with him, she replies ""me too"", and flirting ""where is my kiss?"" Of course she sends a kiss face emoji. My heart sinks. I try not to let it get to me for the rest of the night but I felt heartbroken. The next morning, I decide that it was probably best we end things because of all the things that have happened. So, I leave her place and text her good bye and wish her luck with this other guy. But of course, she lies and convinces me to stay. She says that it was an ""old date that won't stop texting her"". And that she promised she would text him to ""end things"" indefinitely and to stop communicating with her. Of course I'm naive and I believe her. 

March goes by slowly and things are improving between us again. We go on more dates, spend more time with each other, etc. But here and there I would see messages like ""I'll be down in the south near you"" or ""I am free this weekend. Want to grab coffee?"" Part of me knew, but I chose to ignore them and believe her because it wouldn't continue to happen, right?... 

Well, of course one day as she was getting ready for our date, my suspicions got the best of me and I unfortunately snooped in her phone. Another one of the things I deeply regret doing and apologized for because I violated her privacy. But at the time, my gut was just screaming that something was not right.

Well, my suspicions were right. Not only did I find what I feared, but there were two additional guys she had been seeing and dating in the span of three months that we've been dating.... every time we were together and on a date, she would text him when I'm not looking...not only that, but apparently the main guy has been very low effort and doesn't even try. Yet she keeps going back and ending up in his bed! Then she wonders why every date feels like a sexual transaction, telling him that he should put more effort, and wonders if he even likes her. 

Additionally, I had found convos of her and some girls I dated in the past talking negatively of me. Gaining sympathy that we were exclusive and how I could do that to her.... but it seemed like we weren't?

I am shattered... we go on our date, and she can feel that something is off as I was silent the whole drive to the restaurant. She ask me what's the matter. I ask her if she's still seeing that guy. She denies of course. I press further, and she says that she called him last Wednesday to end things. But of course her texts says otherwise...they were on a date and went back to his place. I don't know what to do....we finish our date and end up back at her place. 

The next morning, I confess I know everything and apologized that I snooped on her phone. I am a ball of a mess. Bawling my eyes out and crying. I ask her to come clean and she does but she trickle truths me. I leave to get some space for the rest of the day and to think, but I ended up back at her place that evening.... even throughout the day they had been texting each other telling each other they're ""sad"" continuing to emotionally lean on him. Part of me wishes I had more self-respect and ended things and walked away then and there...but guess what??! I stayed...we became official beginning of April....what a fool, right?

Funny thing is and what hurts a lot too, is she said she loved me two weeks prior to me finding out...then goes to sleep with this guy.

I tried to keep it together and move on. Next two months were rough. I would get emotional and ask to talk about it at times but she would get angry and defensive, trying to justify her behaviour and the things that happened. She tells me I took her choice away of telling me instead of finding out by snooping on her phone...but what about my choice? How do I know she would have told me? She probably only regrets it because I find out...otherwise I feel that it would have gone on. Everytime, she minimizes and dismisses what she's done and her behaviours, and turns it back on what I did. She says, that it wasn't right of me to have asked for exclusivity so soon and in those circumstances. That her friends date multiple people, and that's the only way to find the best fit for her. That she was trying to get out of those dates while I was trying to get into others. Lying that the last two weeks leading up to me finding out, she was trying to end things, that nothing happened that they only went for dinner and didnt sleep with him, that if I had looked at the texts then I would know that it was mostly him reaching out and her reacting out of politeness, etc. Excuses, lies, and half-truths.

Week or two after, she tells me to essentially move on and forget it. Otherwise, we could never be together as she doesn't want to be in a never ending cycle of rehashing the past. But it's not that easy, right? Doesn't help that this guy is still continuing to text her. I finally ask her to block him after a few weeks. She does. But then one night I catch her looking at his blocked texts. I ask her why? And if she regrets ending things with him...She gets defensive and upset so I let it go...

Time passes after a month and I feel okay....we were out and she gets a message from guess who? Same guy with a different number.... emotions resurface and I mistakenly accuse her ""how long?"" Because I don't know what to think....

Anyways, weeks and months go by.....like I said..it comes and goes in waves. I get sad, become insecure and we have a fight about what's wrong and everytime, I try to explain what I'm feeling and that I feel stuck because of our history, and of course she minimizes and dismisses what she's done and turns it back on what I did. I feel terrible of course. 

Well, it's been a year now and I've forgiven her a while ago and have moved on....but what I'm having trouble is forgetting the events, what she's done, what I've done and what I turned myself into, going against my own values and beliefs, and well...the lingering feelings. My self-worth and esteem are not what it used to be.... I feel like trash....I keep thinking, that she settled for me. That I was the backup. That what did the other guys have that I don't? Because clearly all it takes from him was to ask her to come to his apartment and she would go willingly. That I made so much effort but it wasn't enough. Also to put my sexual health at risk. 

I just....I don't know....I'm lost. I wish I had the self-respect to walk away back then. I know I'm not innocent in all this and that the things I did were equally as damaging. I just...I don't know. I deserve it I guess. She's not a bad person. She's wonderful. Maybe all I need is time? Cuz time heals right? Is it worth staying? Making it work?

Alright. I did it and I sprayed it on my ankle.

Honestly.... I do not hate it. On my skin I can actually kind of smell the coffee. It smells like a very sweet maple-y coffee. BUT will it stay good or will the curry come through in a few hours. I will let you know.

Amore Cafe: not good right away but after 2 minutes I love this

Vietnamese coffee: smells perfume-y and the only part of the coffee that comes through is the acidic part and I'm not loving it. Im disappointed because I was looking forward to this one the most 

Follow: GAG smells like bitter bitter stale coffee grinds

Velvet coffee: Absolutely not. The ""velvet"" is really what comes through and it's like a cold sharp but mellow smell. Smells like something Gucci or Dior would make. Not a fan.

Tiramisu: LOVE. It is so soft but photo realistic. The marscapone smells light, and the coffee is sweet but not too much.

1r1mdg5,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenLevelingUp/comments/1r1mdg5/how_to_be_more_attractive_in_2025_the/,How to Be More Attractive in 2025: The Science-Backed Shoe Guide That Actually Works,"Look, nobody's going to tell you this, but your shoes are doing more damage to your attractiveness than you think. I'm talking about the vibe you're giving off before you even open your mouth. And here's what I found after going down a rabbit hole of style psychology research, interviewing fashion experts, and watching way too many breakdown videos: Most guys are walking around in shoe choices that actively repel people. Not because the shoes are ""bad,"" but because they don't match what social psychologists call ""contextual congruence."" Basically, you're wearing the wrong shoe at the wrong time, and it's costing you.

The science backs this up. Studies on first impressions show people make judgments about your socioeconomic status, personality, and even emotional stability within 100 milliseconds of seeing you. Your shoes? They're doing 80% of that heavy lifting. But the media, fashion magazines, and Instagram influencers have convinced you that you need 47 pairs of limited edition sneakers to be attractive. Total BS. You need four. That's it.

Here's the breakdown, straight from behavioral psychology experts, professional stylists, and evolutionary biology research on mate selection. No fluff, just what works.

## Step 1: Get White Sneakers (Your Social Safety Net)

White sneakers are the universal language of ""I have my shit together."" Research from the University of Kansas found that people make accurate personality judgments based on shoes 90% of the time. White sneakers signal conscientiousness and cleanliness, two traits that spike attractiveness ratings across all demographics.

**What to get**: Classic white leather sneakers like Adidas Stan Smiths, Common Projects, or even budget options like Greats or Koio. The key is clean leather, minimal branding, no crazy colors.

**Why they work**: They fit 80% of social contexts, from casual coffee dates to business casual environments. Style expert Antonio Centeno breaks this down in his book *Dress Like a Man*, explaining how white sneakers create what he calls ""approachability without sloppiness."" You look put together but not trying too hard.

**Real talk**: Keep them CLEAN. Dirty white sneakers send the opposite message. They scream ""I don't notice details,"" which is kryptonite for attraction. Get Jason Markk cleaner and use it weekly.

## Step 2: Dark Brown Leather Shoes (Your Adult Card)

You need at least one pair of dark brown leather dress shoes. Not black (too formal, too funeral), but brown. Walnut or chocolate brown specifically.

**What to get**: A pair of brown leather derbies or oxfords from brands like Meermin, Allen Edmonds, or Thursday Boot Company. Look for Goodyear welt construction if you're investing.

**Why they work**: Evolutionary psychologists have found that displays of ""resource acquisition ability"" increase male attractiveness significantly. Translation? Looking like you can show up to adult situations without embarrassing yourself matters. Brown leather shoes work for weddings, job interviews, nice dinners, meeting her parents, basically any situation where sneakers would tank your credibility.

Fashion historian G. Bruce Boyer talks about this in *True Style*, noting that brown shoes occupy a sweet spot between formal authority and approachable warmth that black shoes can't match.

**Pro move**: Get cedar shoe trees. They absorb moisture, maintain shape, and make your shoes last 3x longer. Women notice this kind of detail more than you think.

## Step 3: Casual Desert Boots (Your Wildcard)

This is your versatile middle ground, what style experts call your ""smart casual anchor."" Think Clarks Desert Boots or Blundstone Chelsea boots.

**What to get**: Suede or leather desert boots in tan, grey, or brown. Chelsea boots work too if you want something sleeker.

**Why they work**: According to fashion psychologist Dr. Carolyn Mair's research, footwear that bridges casual and formal contexts signals social intelligence. These boots work with jeans and a t-shirt or chinos and a button-up. They're the chameleon shoe.

Tim Ferriss mentions in his podcast with Derek Sivers how having ""context-flexible wardrobe pieces"" reduces decision fatigue while increasing your perceived competence across social settings. Desert boots are exactly that.

If you want to go deeper on style psychology and body language but don't have the energy to wade through multiple books and research papers, there's an AI learning app called BeFreed that pulls from resources like the style guides mentioned above, plus evolutionary psychology research and expert interviews on attraction. 

You tell it your specific goal, like ""become more magnetic and confident as an introvert,"" and it generates a personalized audio learning plan just for you. You can choose quick 10-minute overviews or switch to 40-minute deep dives with real examples when something clicks. The knowledge comes from vetted books, research studies, and expert talks in psychology, fashion, and social dynamics. Plus you can pick different voice styles, even a smoky, conversational tone if that keeps you more engaged during your commute or gym sessions.

**Avoid**: Anything too rugged or workwear-heavy unless you're actually on a ranch. You want refined casual, not lumberjack cosplay.

## Step 4: Athletic Shoes That Actually Fit Your Activity

Here's where most guys screw up: They wear running shoes to lift weights or basketball shoes to run. This signals you don't know what you're doing, which isn't attractive.

**What to get**: Shoes that match YOUR activity. Lifting? Get flat, stable shoes like Converse Chuck Taylors or Reebok Nanos. Running? Actual running shoes with proper support like Brooks or Hoka. Basketball? Court shoes with ankle support.

**Why it matters**: Dr. Jordan Shallow, a biomechanics expert, explains that wearing appropriate footwear demonstrates body awareness and self-care, both highly attractive traits. Plus, you'll perform better and look more competent doing whatever activity you're doing.

The app Nike Training Club actually has great guides on matching shoes to workout types if you need help figuring this out.

**Bottom line**: Looking like you know your way around a gym makes you more attractive. Looking like you wandered in wearing whatever was by your door does the opposite.

## Final Real Talk

Attraction isn't about having the most expensive shoes or the latest drops. It's about demonstrating awareness, context-reading, and the ability to present yourself appropriately. These four shoe types cover 95% of situations you'll encounter. Everything else is just consumerism marketed as necessity.

The goal isn't to impress everyone. It's to never accidentally turn someone off because your footwear screamed ""I don't pay attention to details."" Because whether we like it or not, people are judging. The research is clear on that. But now you've got the playbook to make sure those judgments work in your favor.

The sea called to him, uttering sweet songs of promise and peril, and he answered, fishing rod and bait in hand. There wasn't a day where he wasn't drenched in the sea or carried its scent with him. There would be times when I would visit him during the summer and he would just get inside his own house after fishing for a while. He wasn't at all a frail old man and he was probably more physically fit than other elderly people I have met, yet he did have his moments of weakness.

Our neighborhood was built along a cliff facing the water, so whenever my grandfather needed to get his fix of sea salt, all he would need to do is walk out his back door. I always lived down the block from my grandfather, so going to his house was only a matter of deciding whether or not to take two minutes out of the day to go and visit him. My parents never cared how long I went to his house. I could have been at his house for a year and they wouldn't care. But the amount of time he spent out at sea disturbed them. It wasn't unheard of to go to the beach by the cliff side. It was normal to play around in the sand, make sand castles, and watch them get wiped out by waves, mocking you with the slightest bit of sea foam that followed it. But something about the frequency and how he would talk about the sea felt unnatural. He was family though, and that was enough for my parents to trust him.

I remember the first time he took me out to the ocean like it was yesterday. It was in the summer and my parents were out of town for the night. My mom had to stay the evening shift at the museum and my dad's boss decided to give him overtime at the office. Sure his wife worked evenings often, but this was a fantastic opportunity to squeeze more work out of him like a soggy rag. I remember walking to my grandfather's house with a big smile on my face. I always loved going to his house. Though in hindsight, I feel he was a bit weird and off-kilter. But as a kid, he was possibly my favorite person to be around. He had a huge back yard that I would sometimes bring some toys with me to play in. There was this wooden fence with a gate that prevented me from accidentally falling off the cliff side and I would always try to take a peek over the fence. My grandfather, being the responsible babysitter my mother always relied on, always made sure to keep me from tipping over, and would sometimes instead have me sit on his shoulders to see the view of the vast sea that he visited almost every day.

He had this fire pit in his backyard that we used to make s'mores in at night. It had a shoddy setup of old metal foldable chairs, rusted by the wrath of the atmosphere. But despite that setup, we made it work. He would always tell stories of giant fish he wrestled with in the ocean and of maidens singing beautiful ballads to him. Every fish that he caught, there was a story behind it. Every wave he rode was an adventure. Every sound was a song. I would always look forward to listening to these stories and he would always be looking forward to telling one. This particular story was about how he saw this giant fish that he found swimming in the middle of the night. He didn't catch it yet, but he plans to go out tonight. I would always ask him if I could go with him, ever since I was four. Usually, he would say that I was too young. But this time, after he finished his story, he said, ""So kiddo, I told you this story because I might need some help catching this one. I think you are at the age where you can help me. Would you like to help me catch it?"" I was ecstatic. I practically fell out of my seat. ""Yes! Yes I do!""

""Alright, let's go!"" He picked up his fishing gear and started to leave towards the cliff side.

I jumped up from my seat and followed him with a huge grin on my face. We made it to the fence and went down the rocky steps formed by the cliff side. As soon as we made it to the boat, my grandpa took both oars and rowed with all his might. I asked if he needed help, but he assured me he got it. It took several minutes before we went out to the ocean away from land. I could see the entire cliff side from the water. 

My grandfather closed his eyes and took in the evening breeze. “The beauty of the ocean is the silence. There’s no arguments or interruptions, just the sounds of the waves. It feels safe. Almost like a blanket. And now, kiddo. I think you should be able to experience this with me, too.”

I couldn’t agree more. The ocean was peaceful. No wonder grandpa came out here so often. My grandpa stood up, threw his hook into the water, and sat back down. He then offered me the fishing pole. “The fish won’t catch itself.”, He said with a smile. I snatched it with excitement and almost started reeling in as fast as I could. My grandpa’s words stopped me, “Not yet, wait for a bite.”

“How will I know when the fish bites?”

“When it tugs on your fishing pole. You should also see the tip of it bend more. Focus on the rod itself.”

I then squinted my eyes and “focused” on the fishing rod harder. My grandfather laughed. “This isn’t a competition, Sam. Just feel the breeze. Save your energy for the fish.” 

I closed my eyes a bit and breathed in the sweet scent of the ocean. I felt the waves rock the boat ever so slightly and felt the soft breeze gently push against my face. It all felt still, safe. Suddenly, a yank from the fishing pole. I jumped up. My grandfather kept me steady. “You got him! Now reel! Reel! Pull away from the fish!”

I did as he asked, I gripped the fishing rod with iron resolve and pulled away from the fish as I furiously reeled the line in. It was hard, but luckily my grandfather was there to root me in the boat. I kept cranking the reel, my noodle arms wiggling from the stress I placed on them. “Hey grandpa! This must be a big one!”

“It must be to give someone as strong as you a problem!” He laughed at his own joke.

I pulled, I reeled, I yanked and cranked. It wasn’t budging. Suddenly, I felt my grandfather pick me up. I kept on reeling, and pulling with all my might. The fish flew out of the water and flopped around on the boat. My grandfather quickly picked up the creature and wrestled with it until it stopped. And there it was. In my grandfather’s arms was a striped bass. It was huge. The thing passed beyond his shoulders. He could take someone out with it. This was the fish of his legend.

“Nice catch, kiddo,” He said with a smile, still trying to get the fish to stay still. 

Once we gave the fish the time to stay still, he dropped the fish on the boat, looked at his watch and said, “Woah, look at the time. It is time for bed, kiddo. Do you want to do this with me again? I can get you your own fishing rod if you would like.” My eyes widened, “You mean it?”

“Yeah, why not?”

That was probably the happiest I have felt in a while. I got to live the adventures that my grandpa spoke to me about. “Yes! Please get me my own fishing rod!” My grandpa smiled and pat my head, “Sure thing, kiddo.” 

After a few hours of being out at sea, my grandpa took both oars at hand and rowed back to shore. Once we got back to the house, my grandfather told me to wait in the living room for dinner and so I turned on his old “flat screen” TV to \*Avatar the Last Airbender\*. He never wanted me to see him gut the fish, thought it would be too much for a ten year old to witness him cut open a fish carcass and watch as the innards spilled out. I could still remember the thick, metallic scent of fish meat intermingled with blood coming from the kitchen as he whistled the song, \*Beyond the Sea\*. His whistles kept in time with the harsh scraping sounds he made with the knife as he cut into the flesh of the fish. Once he finished dicing up the remains of the titan, he stored them in tiny little containers and kept them in the freezer. The next few days we had bass for dinner. I surely didn’t complain, mostly because I knew in my mind that I helped catch it.

For the rest of the summer, it became routine. Every afternoon, I would visit my grandfather and we would go out to sea. Then, when it would get dark, he would place a lantern on the floor of the boat and tell his stories out in the middle of the ocean. His stories seemed much more real when he told them out at sea. I felt that I could imagine them better. That I could put myself and his shoes and actually feel the light evening breeze at the sea that he would rave about. I could feel the rocking of the boat and even imagine what it was like to man a boat in the middle of a storm. It all just clicked. And whether or not we caught a fish didn’t matter much to us. It just felt right. Just to go out to the ocean felt worth it. 

By August, the fantasy was over. I had to cram my Summer Reading assignment before the school year started, so I stopped going out in the ocean with my grandfather. Instead, I would just read my book in his living room, alone. During the first few weeks of school, my time was so limited with homework and projects that I couldn’t shake the feeling that I had been neglecting my grandfather. Whenever he would ask me if I wanted to go out into the ocean, I would be so busy that I just had to say no. And I can still recall that every time I declined his offer, he looked as if he felt hurt. Like I had rejected him, rejected the sea. I felt a bit sorry for him, leaving this old man to go out to the sea alone again. So, I decided to go out with him for one day during the weekend. Homework and projects be damned, but I wanted to spend time with my grandfather for a little bit. So, the next time he asked, I gladly put my books down and went out with him.

Though this time I went out to the ocean it was different. It felt different. It felt alien. Like I wasn't supposed to be there. The wind felt sharper, more cold. The sea felt more rough than relaxed. My grandfather was stone faced the entire time he was rowing us out to sea. I would constantly ask if he was alright or if he was tired, and he would always answer that he was fine, that he felt great, even. He would ask me about school and I would tell him, though I still couldn't shake the feeling of something different that might happen. He pulled out his lantern and placed it in the middle of the boat. Then he stood up as if he were to tell me a story again. But this time it was different. This time, he got up and said, ""You know, the ocean here missed you Sam.” 

“What?”

“The ocean misses you. You were gone for too long. I could hear it calling to me. It was asking where you went.” 

I was puzzled. Why would the ocean miss me? I tried to force a laugh to see if my grandfather was joking. He wasn’t. He was dead serious. His face contorted with fury, “You think this is a joke? You abandoned our friend like that, and you think this is some sort of joke?” His voice escalated with every word that left his mouth. You could physically touch the scorching hot rage boiling inside of his chest. My throat dropped to my stomach. “G-grandp-?” 

“It’s not very nice of you to abandon our friend like that, Sam! And to laugh at her grief too? What’s wrong with you?”

The waves matched his fury and rocked us both violently as I held onto the side of the boat. My grandfather started to get closer to me. His giant hands snatched my shirt like two giant bear traps and tried to lift me up. I held onto the boat for dear life not knowing what he would do when he lifted me into the air. My ten-year-old strength failed me and he started to hold me by my shirt. He brought me close to his face. I could see his blood-shot eyes and the veins popping out of his neck. His breath smelled like an awful combination of coffee and rotten fish. Then he spoke through his gritting teeth.

“Do you hear her?”

“W-what?”

“Do you hear Carol?”

I shook my head. Then suddenly, something switched inside my grandfather. His veins were no longer bulging out his neck, his bloodshot eyes stared beyond me, but his vice-like grip remained tucking at my shirt. The waves also calmed down. Everything was still. The slightest breeze sent a chill down my spine. He slowly let me down and sat down in his seat, still staring into space. Then, realization kicked in. He looked at his hands in horror and looked at me. He reached out to me. “Kiddo…” His voice shook. “I’m-” 

I recoiled to the back of the boat. We stared at each other in silence; the only sound that was heard was the light rolling of the waves. Any slight movement my grandfather made, my grip on the boat tightened. He grabbed the oars and slowly started to row us back to shore, trying to make no sudden movements to startle me further. As we were slowly cruising towards the shore, the air felt sour. I felt sick, like I could hurl off into the infinite sea. Once we made it to shore, without saying a word, I jumped up and ran towards my house. I ran inside, ran upstairs to my room and shut the door violently behind me. 

I couldn’t sleep. As the night went on, all I could do was stare at the coat hanging behind my door, praying, hoping my grandfather wasn’t going to slam it open. The coat just hung there, and I could swear the sleeves were stretching and creaking their way towards me. I couldn’t move, I couldn’t get up. The sleeves started to slither on the ground towards me like snakes. The ends of the sleeves  reached towards me as it started to climb onto my bed. The claws of the coat were getting closer and closer, I think I could feel them pulling at my shirt, trying to make their way towards my neck, then suddenly, day broke. The coat was normal. My room was illuminated by the harsh, bright light shining through the window behind me. The birds chirping and the sound of the sea, beckoning me to come back to the waters. 

My eyes were wide open, but I still felt tired. I sluggishly got out of bed. I have never felt the weight of not sleeping until I got up that morning. My head was pounding, every move I made felt sluggish and I fought every urge I had to go back to bed. It was seven in the morning. I had school today. I got dressed, dragged my feet down the stairs and slowly made my way to the kitchen. I took out a box of Frosted Flakes from my cupboard and poured the cereal into my bowl as the golden, sugary grains made ringing sounds against the ceramic. I then dragged my feet to the fridge, pulled out a gallon of milk, and carefully poured the milk into the bowl, watching the grains drown in the liquid, completing my sugary soup. As I shoveled the cereal into my mouth, I brought all of my attention to the clock, seven-ten. I still have some time. My bus came by the house at eight-thirty, so I felt I had plenty of time. I shoveled more of the sugary substance drowned in milk as I made mental notes in my head about what I was missing. I’m clothed, and my backpack should be by my-. My backpack. I left it at my grandpa’s house. The sooner I realized it, the sooner I quickly dropped my spoon into my bowl and rushed out the door towards his house.

I stood there at his front door. I was frozen. The wooden titan loomed before me. I could see myself in the brass knob, pale and disheveled from a lack of sleep. Struggling to bring my hand towards the door to knock. Why am I so afraid? This was my grandfather. He would never hurt me. But, last night felt like an exception. Last night was the first time I ever feared the old man. Fear. That word and my grandfather even as a concept together felt like it would never be. Like water and oil – they never mix. But all it takes is a little shake. All it takes is a disturbance and the two can seemingly meld together.

I swallowed what fear remained of the old man and promptly knocked on the door. I waited a few minutes. Nothing, not a sound. I knocked on the door, louder this time. Nothing again. I tried to twist the doorknob. It was locked. I didn’t know what time it was now, or how long I was standing there. All I knew was I needed that backpack.

I rushed to the right side of the house and tried to open the giant wooden gate before me. It was locked. I hoisted myself over the fence and dropped over the other side into his backyard. It felt foreign. The grass blades of his back yard flowed in the wind and almost looked as if they were breathing or feeling for my presence. I slowly walked towards the back sliding doors of the house. As I drew closer, I was hoping my grandfather wasn’t staring before me or worse, waiting for me at the open doorway. I hid myself along the side of the house and looked towards the backyard. I found him. He was blankly staring off the cliff. He seemed to be out of it. I slowly tiptoed towards the sliding doors, keeping an eye on him so that he wouldn’t surprise me. I kept going, thinking about each step that I took, making sure that I didn’t make a sound. My eyes constantly shifted between pointing between two places, my grandfather and the wide open sliding doors.

I eventually made it inside and my nostrils were attacked with the metallic scent of blood and fish. I usually expected this smell from this house but this time it seemed stronger, like he recently gutted open a fish. I continued towards the living room where I left my backpack and there it was. I slowly made my way towards the backpack and headed straight for the front door before I heard the sliding doors shut followed by the feeling  like a quick rush of wind from behind me, bursting through his bedroom door. I quickly looked behind me. Nothing was there. The door was closed, and suddenly the house seemed darker. My attention was pulled toward my grandpa’s room. Illuminated by a small, dim, light. A voice in my head screamed, “Get out of there! What are you doing?” But my body seemed to move on its own. 

I slowly tiptoed my way towards his room. The smell grew stronger. The closer I got to the doorway, I swear I could hear something get louder. The sound of sobbing. I got closer and closer to the door as the sound got louder and the stench grew stronger, practically holding my nose in a chokehold. I held my breath and pushed onward and found my grandfather’s bedroom. In disarray. Books on the floor, pages torn out. Heads, fins, innards of fish strewn all over the floor. And above his headboard were the words:

I CAN STILL HEAR HER. HER SONG CALLS TO ME.

EVERY TIME I DON’T ANSWER IT GETS LOUDER.

THE SIREN GROWS RESTLESS.

THE SEA CALLS TO ME.

IT SPEAKS.

THE SEA SPEAKS

repeated over and over again written in rotting fish entrails and blood, some of the intestine was sliding of the wall and obscured the other messages. I could still hear the sobbing, even louder this time, easing its way out of his bathroom door to the right. I tiptoe closely to the door, careful to not stand on any loose floor boards as the sobbing gets louder and louder. I peek into the room and finally see him. His hands were drenched in the blood and mucus of whatever he just butchered, cupping his hands around his ears. 

“It won’t stop.”

“The song won’t stop.”

“I can’t stop it.”

“No matter what I do I hear her.”

My grandfather slowly curls onto the floor, uttering the words, “Make it stop… Make it stop….”

He kept sobbing. Though I was horrified by him, I couldn’t help but feel bad for him. I tried to extend my arm to him from the creek in the door. Before suddenly, the door creaked open. My heart ran to my stomach. My grandfather’s head bolted up and looked right at me. 

“You…”

I jumped back and ran for the door. I heard him scramble onto his feet and follow behind me, howling

“YOU DID THIS TO ME, YOU LITTLE SHIT!!!”

“YOU ANGERED HER—THE SIREN!”

“THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE YOUR PUNISHMENT, NOT MINE!!!!”

I burst through his bedroom door and scrambled down the hallway. I could hear his footsteps getting closer. I ran into the kitchen before he picked me up with my backpack and turned me around. I tried to slip out of the straps before his bear-like claws snatched at my neck, squeezing tight. I could feel the air getting trapped in my lungs, all the blood rushing to my head. My hands tried to pull his hands away from my neck, but nothing, they wouldn’t budge. My right hand rested on the bloody mess that was his countertop. I tried to feel around and—got it. His knife. Without a second thought I shoved the knife into his shoulder right. He howled in pain before letting go of me. I dropped to the floor finally taking in air again. My grandfather sobbed more wildly, holding the knife in pain. I raced for the front door. I heard my grandfather’s sobbing quickly turn to shouts of rage as his footsteps got louder behind me. I unlocked the door and ran outside, shutting the door behind me. As I ran away from his house and towards mine, I thought I may have heard a squeak on the floor and a thud against the door. 

I rushed towards my front door before being confronted with my mother. “Where were—”, She gasped. “What happened?” She quickly grabbed me by the shoulders to look at my neck, covered in whatever my grandfather was butchering. “What is this? What happened to you?” My heart sank to my stomach. Tears were welling up in my eyes. I sniffled and said, “There’s something wrong with grandpa.” My mother, no questions asked, rushed to the phone and called called nine-one-one. She stated on the phone that he fell. She then called work and told her that she was going to be home today, that something happened. She put the phone down after saying, “Thank you.” and quickly got me into the bathtub. 

For the rest of that day, all I could do was stare into space, imagining how safe the ocean was with my grandfather. Imagining better times while my mother washed the blood and mucus that used to caked my grandfather’s hands. There were times where she held down the vomit from the smell that came off of it. My father came out of his room and passed by the bathroom door before exclaiming, “Ugh, what is that awful sme—”. His eyes grew wide as he saw his wife, practically in tears trying to clean off their dead-faced son. “What happened?” My mother told him how she found me, and what I said. Horrified, he went to the phone straight away to call off from work. This call, unlike my mother's, ended in a screaming match. He promptly told his job that he quit and hung up the phone. For the rest of the day, he did whatever he could to help my mother. For the entire time I was home, I was silent, staring into space while my parents were trying something, anything to get any words from me. They would constantly ask what happened, where grandpa was, what he was doing. All they got from me was silence.

Later that day, my grandfather was reported missing. They suggest foul play since the first responders saw what I saw in the house and found a pool of blood with a streak resembling someone who slipped in it sitting right by his front door. They also noticed some bloodied footprints that led out to the door, and out to sea. The case was never solved though. My grandfather was never found and his house was condemned.

Ever since then, I have been doing fairly well in school. I was a top student for most of my academic career, and since high school, I had a certain draw to marine biology. I was always fascinated with the ocean, so the field didn’t seem too far away from what I knew as my safe place. 

I went to university and graduated with a masters in marine biology. Saying that I made my parents proud was an understatement. Later that week, everyone in my family was invited to my house for my graduation. I was happy to see who had shown up, cousins, uncles I haven't heard from in years came all this way to congratulate me. It felt nice, but I couldn't help but notice that there was always someone missing whenever my family hosted some of these events. After a while, I felt I needed some fresh air, so I went outside to the beach into our back yard to just stare out into the vast ocean that was behind my house.

My mother came out the back of the house to meet with me, and asked if I wanted to join the family. I said, “I just wanted to get away from the noise. It’s quiet out here.” She nodded her head, ""Well, don't stay out for too long, everyone is here for you."", ""I know. I will catch guys in a bit."" My mom kissed my forehead, told me how proud she was of me, and turned back to the house to join the rest of the family.

After I stood out there and gazed at the stars, I noticed that a rowboat appeared to my right. That was weird, I haven’t seen that before. There was something in me that compelled me to go in, so I went in. I rowed out to sea, out to the spot my grandfather and I went fishing. The waves were calming, reflecting the night sky while rocking the boat like a cradle. It felt safe. I closed my eyes and started to hear something. Whistling. I knew the whistling sounded familiar but I couldn’t put my finger on it. The longer I heard the whistling, it became clear to what tune it was whistling to.

For context my anxiety is pretty bad but I’m an absolute fiend for my morning coffee. I’m at a point where I’m willing to give it a solid go but would love to hear some experiences to encourage me along. ",1,1770780346.0,decaf,7,1.0,False
1r1mb83,https://www.reddit.com/r/evanston/comments/1r1mb83/advice_on_community_feel_relocating_to_evanston/,Advice on community feel - relocating to Evanston vs Wilmette,"Hoping you might share your thoughts and perspective on what it feels like to live in SE/NE Evanston versus SE Wilmette as a family with two young kids (1 + 4yrs) in public school. Are people friendly, is there an involved parent community at schools, is there any feeling of needing to keep up with the Jones?

Here's the wish list: we are hoping to find a home in a neighborhood that has a community feel, where you get to know your neighbors, with other families with young kids around. We'd like the neighborhood to not feel too urban (in the sense of lots of car traffic/on-street parking), and to be able to walk to the metra/restaurants/coffee/parks/the beach. We want to feel confident in the public schools. Parenting is hard enough and we are hoping to choose a neighborhood (but moreover town) that feels like a village despite its size (people out walking on your street, running into neighbors at coffee shops, ways to get involved/volunteer, etc) ... does that exist in Evanston or Wilmette??

We had zeroed in on NE Evanston near Central or SE Evanston near Main for this, but are also looking at SE Wilmette (we love Gillson and walking there would be a dream). Any of those that you would/would not recommend based on what we are hoping for... or any new areas you would add? 

How might you compare the Evanston vs Wilmette vibe, if you will?

Would be grateful if you could share any insights - thank you!

1r1m8cb,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1r1m8cb/worth_staying_betrayal_trauma_26m_33f/,Worth staying? Betrayal Trauma 26M 33F,"Hello everyone,

I'm sorry I deleted my previous post and keep reposting. I will leave this one. Just afraid that she or those she knows will see... sorry.

Not really sure what I'm hoping to achieve by writing this post. Perhaps a place to vent, a place to journal or perhaps to seek advise? For the past year, I have really been struggling with pain, grief, anxiety, trust issues, vigilance, and lowered self-esteem and worth. It comes and goes in waves. But lately, it has been terribly worse. Perhaps I deserve it for what transpired. Sorry if it's long. I'm just going to word vomit stuff out.

It started when I met my partner in beginning of last year. Everything was amazing. Three dates in, I realized I wanted a serious relationship with her and so, I asked if she was seeing anyone else and if she wanted, I'd love to be exclusive with her. She agreed. I guess that was my first mistake because perhaps three dates in was too fast and premature. Second, the circumstances in which it was asked was not ideal and I recognize was from a position of vulnerability from her side, it was post-intimacy. Both reasons she points out whenever we have a conversation regarding my feelings. I deeply regret this and have apologized for it. Anyways, I was elated. 

I continue to plan meaningful dates and am consistent with my intentions and effort. We learn more about each other, become more physically and emotionally intimate. Become more involved with each others personal lives. It wasn't until Valentines week that I noticed things that made me suspicious, we would spend time together and she gets a text from an unsaved number asking  ""want to have valentines dinner?"" She's on her phone a lot (work & business) when we're together, and I just so happened to glance at the notification previews as they came. My heart sank and I thought not again (I've been cheated on before), but then I thought ""nah, she wouldn't. She agreed to be exclusive"". So I gave her the benefit of the doubt and carried on. But a part of me was screaming to trust my gut. The more I think about it, the more my mind says that perhaps she's not being forthcoming and honest about things.

It's been a week and it eats at me. I kept thinking about it. Then I do the most stupidest thing possible that I am not proud of and I deeply regret it. I went back on the apps and met someone else. I went on one date with this person but I felt guilty and terrible the whole time, so I didn't want to pursue anything further. But guess what? Of course Karma came back with a vengeance and she found out subsequently because I also matched with her colleague who of course told her. And I was posted on are we dating the same guy.

It was rough and emotional but we had a difficult conversation regarding this. Ultimately, she forgave me and gave me a second chance. We stayed together. She even gave me the go ahead to date other people to get it out of my system, but I declined. I will forever be sorry and deeply regret it for the rest of my life. Next few days I try to make amends and repair things. I even told her that if she wanted to date other people too then by all means go ahead, but please communicate with me. She denies the need to and reaffirms that we're exclusive and that she's NOT dating anybody else. 

But one night as we were sitting together, she was on her phone again, she gets another text from the unsaved number. A photo of the other guy on vacation, telling her he missed her and wished she was there with him, she replies ""me too"", and flirting ""where is my kiss?"" Of course she sends a kiss face emoji. My heart sinks. I try not to let it get to me for the rest of the night but I felt heartbroken. The next morning, I decide that it was probably best we end things because of all the things that have happened. So, I leave her place and text her good bye and wish her luck with this other guy. But of course, she lies and convinces me to stay. She says that it was an ""old date that won't stop texting her"". And that she promised she would text him to ""end things"" indefinitely and to stop communicating with her. Of course I'm naive and I believe her. 

March goes by slowly and things are improving between us again. We go on more dates, spend more time with each other, etc. But here and there I would see messages like ""I'll be down in the south near you"" or ""I am free this weekend. Want to grab coffee?"" Part of me knew, but I chose to ignore them and believe her because it wouldn't continue to happen, right?... 

Well, of course one day as she was getting ready for our date, my suspicions got the best of me and I unfortunately snooped in her phone. Another one of the things I deeply regret doing and apologized for because I violated her privacy. But at the time, my gut was just screaming that something was not right.

Well, my suspicions were right. Not only did I find what I feared, but there were two additional guys she had been seeing and dating in the span of three months that we've been dating.... every time we were together and on a date, she would text him when I'm not looking...not only that, but apparently the main guy has been very low effort and doesn't even try. Yet she keeps going back and ending up in his bed! Then she wonders why every date feels like a sexual transaction, telling him that he should put more effort, and wonders if he even likes her. 

Additionally, I had found convos of her and some girls I dated in the past talking negatively of me. Gaining sympathy that we were exclusive and how I could do that to her.... but it seemed like we weren't?

I am shattered... we go on our date, and she can feel that something is off as I was silent the whole drive to the restaurant. She ask me what's the matter. I ask her if she's still seeing that guy. She denies of course. I press further, and she says that she called him last Wednesday to end things. But of course her texts says otherwise...they were on a date and went back to his place. I don't know what to do....we finish our date and end up back at her place. 

The next morning, I confess I know everything and apologized that I snooped on her phone. I am a ball of a mess. Bawling my eyes out and crying. I ask her to come clean and she does but she trickle truths me. I leave to get some space for the rest of the day and to think, but I ended up back at her place that evening.... even throughout the day they had been texting each other telling each other they're ""sad"" continuing to emotionally lean on him. Part of me wishes I had more self-respect and ended things and walked away then and there...but guess what??! I stayed...we became official beginning of April....what a fool, right?

Funny thing is and what hurts a lot too, is she said she loved me two weeks prior to me finding out...then goes to sleep with this guy.

I tried to keep it together and move on. Next two months were rough. I would get emotional and ask to talk about it at times but she would get angry and defensive, trying to justify her behaviour and the things that happened. She tells me I took her choice away of telling me instead of finding out by snooping on her phone...but what about my choice? How do I know she would have told me? She probably only regrets it because I find out...otherwise I feel that it would have gone on. Everytime, she minimizes and dismisses what she's done and her behaviours, and turns it back on what I did. She says, that it wasn't right of me to have asked for exclusivity so soon and in those circumstances. That her friends date multiple people, and that's the only way to find the best fit for her. That she was trying to get out of those dates while I was trying to get into others. Lying that the last two weeks leading up to me finding out, she was trying to end things, that nothing happened that they only went for dinner and didnt sleep with him, that if I had looked at the texts then I would know that it was mostly him reaching out and her reacting out of politeness, etc. Excuses, lies, and half-truths.

Week or two after, she tells me to essentially move on and forget it. Otherwise, we could never be together as she doesn't want to be in a never ending cycle of rehashing the past. But it's not that easy, right? Doesn't help that this guy is still continuing to text her. I finally ask her to block him after a few weeks. She does. But then one night I catch her looking at his blocked texts. I ask her why? And if she regrets ending things with him...She gets defensive and upset so I let it go...

Time passes after a month and I feel okay....we were out and she gets a message from guess who? Same guy with a different number.... emotions resurface and I mistakenly accuse her ""how long?"" Because I don't know what to think....

Anyways, weeks and months go by.....like I said..it comes and goes in waves. I get sad, become insecure and we have a fight about what's wrong and everytime, I try to explain what I'm feeling and that I feel stuck because of our history, and of course she minimizes and dismisses what she's done and turns it back on what I did. I feel terrible of course. 

Well, it's been a year now and I've forgiven her a while ago and have moved on....but what I'm having trouble is forgetting the events, what she's done, what I've done and what I turned myself into, going against my own values and beliefs, and well...the lingering feelings. My self-worth and esteem are not what it used to be.... I feel like trash....I keep thinking, that she settled for me. That I was the backup. That what did the other guys have that I don't? Because clearly all it takes from him was to ask her to come to his apartment and she would go willingly. That I made so much effort but it wasn't enough. Also to put my sexual health at risk. 

I just....I don't know....I'm lost. I wish I had the self-respect to walk away back then. I know I'm not innocent in all this and that the things I did were equally as damaging. I just...I don't know. I deserve it I guess. She's not a bad person. She's wonderful. Maybe all I need is time? Cuz time heals right? Is it worth staying? Making it work?

During a wine-fueled girls’ night, her friends poke fun at the “roommate” excuse, not buying it for a second, especially as Harry swoops in with effortless charm—stealing sips from her wine, brushing her hand, and leaving a soft, lingering kiss on her cheek before he heads out.

When Hermione’s flat is attacked, he finds himself with company again; her voice in his house, her tea on his counter, her presence steady in the nights that feel too large.

Harry loves his life. Sure, work as an Auror is hard but he has his best friend by his side as his flat mate.

A grieving godfather. A baby who wouldn’t sleep. A best friend who stayed.  
Hermione moved into Grimmauld Place with a spare wand and steady hands, thinking she’d only stay long enough to help Harry adjust to raising Teddy. Then weeks turned into months. Months turned into bedtime routines, Muggle playgrounds, baby socks in the laundry, and coffee-fueled mornings with soft looks across the table. Somewhere between teething nightmares and shared grocery lists, they accidentally built a home.  
Now Teddy’s nearly two, Hermione’s hiding a secret, and neither of them wants to say what’s already true:  
This doesn’t feel temporary anymore.

He nearly walked past without saying anything. They were at the coffee machine, waiting for it to finish, one hand braced on the counter. He offered a polite smile-the kind you give when you’re fairly certain you’ve spoken before. “Morning.” “Morning.” There was a brief pause. Not uncomfortable, just undecided. The sort where you weigh whether to add something personal or keep moving. He searched for a safe follow-up and came up blank. So he defaulted. “How’s it going?” They gave a small exhale that might have been a laugh. “You know. Emails.” “Yeah.” The machine beeped. They took their cup, nodded once, and left. He stepped forward to pour his own. For a second, he tried to place where they usually sat. The thought drifted off before it settled anywhere useful. It didn’t matter. The office was full of half-familiar faces. By the time he returned to his desk, he’d already stopped thinking about it. Moments after his awkward encounter with his coworker he sat down at his desk, a function he had repeated for so long his body function on autopilot. Booting up the computer, a multitude of pop ups flooded the monitor. He sighs. brilliant more work to deal with.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1r1m5si,https://i.redd.it/u91pvequ9sig1.jpeg,Reclaiming Vitality—Overcoming Mental Fatigue in Later Life,"Mental exhaustion in seniors often stems from the weight of significant life changes, such as retirement, loss of loved ones, or managing chronic health conditions. Unlike the physical tiredness we feel after a long day, mental fatigue can manifest as irritability, persistent ""brain fog,"" and a loss of interest in once-loved activities—common precursors to clinical depression.

The key to preserving mental energy and emotional health lies in balanced engagement. Over-stimulating a tired mind can lead to burnout, but complete isolation is even more dangerous, as loneliness is linked to a higher risk of cognitive decline and heart disease.

Core Strategies for Mental Resilience

The Power of Small Wins: Seniors should focus on ""mastery"" activities—learning a small new skill, like 10 words of a foreign language or a new card game. These small accomplishments release ""feel-good"" chemicals like dopamine that combat mental slump.

Low-Impact Movement: Exercise is a powerful natural antidepressant. Activities like Tai Chi, swimming, or a simple 15-minute daily walk can be as effective as some medications for lifting mood.

Cognitive Stimulation: Engaging the brain through puzzles, reading, or learning an instrument keeps neural pathways active, sharpening focus and concentration.

Predictable Routines: Establishing a daily schedule for meals, exercise, and sleep provides a sense of structure and control, which significantly reduces anxiety.

Connecting with Community

You don't have to navigate aging alone. Strengthening social ties is one of the most effective ways to protect against depression and sharpen the mind.

Where to find your community:

Local Senior Centers: These are hubs for low-cost fitness classes, book clubs, and social gatherings designed for your age group.

Volunteer Opportunities: 

Mentoring youth or helping at a food bank provides a powerful sense of purpose and social identity.

Intergenerational Programs: 

Programs that connect seniors with younger generations—such as community gardens or storytelling circles—offer fresh perspectives and reduce isolation.

Support Groups: 

Sharing experiences with peers facing similar challenges can reduce feelings of shame and isolation.

Digital Connection: 

If mobility is limited, use tools like Stitch for global online communities or attend virtual coffee mornings through local libraries.

Every one around me is telling me it's just anxiety. I'm just hoping for some advice or someone to talk to me please.

Heart disease runs on my deceased mother's side.

Last October 25 I went to a walk-in doctor because I was having pain in my leg and testicle for three weeks. The doctor put me on doxycycline (100mgs every 12hrs) in case it was an infection. I started the next morning and after a few days of taking it I noticed some concerning symptoms and I was getting worried. A swelling pain in the liver and sharp stabbing pain near my left kidney (these pains have returned intermittently but to a lesser degree), waking up to night sweats and an inability to fall back asleep. On the fourth day my mind went blank for a couple minutes and my heart started beating really fast. I was sent to the ER from urgent care with everyone telling me I was having a major panic attack. The ER doctor said I'm fine after running my blood work and said I can stop taking the doxycycline (total amount taken 700 mgs). He also got me an appointment for an ultrasound on my groin and a Holter monitor. I spoke with the ER psych and he sent me home with a script for an SSRI (escitalopram 5mgs week one 10mgs for two weeks then 15 mgs) that I've had before.

Two days later on the day of the ultrasound (which found nothing but a small cyst on the opposite testicle) I noticed my throat was a bit itchy. The next day my arms, legs and scalp became itchy and that lasted two days but with no apparent rash. I then started getting nerve irritations (left inner forearm near elbow, right armpit, cheeks, ear cartilage, and behind my eye) and burning in different parts of my body (tongue, lungs and groin) all through November. I also had a dry bumpy rash on my elbows that was preceded by some small papules on my left knuckles, both of which only got itchy when I scratched them or were exposed to water.  The testicular pain mostly subsided at this point. 

At the end of November one night I felt a faint cramping across my upper abdomen that lasted until the next morning when I ate. I made an appointment to see the same clinic doctor that same morning and he said that I probably had a minor allergic reaction. That evening I got a sudden dull pain in my upper left abdomen and a bit of confusion. The pain turned into a chronic sharp burning pain and I had chronic acid reflux and burping. It felt like an ulcer but I don't smoke or drink or do anything that would cause an ulcer. At some point I remember feeling a squeezing in my shoulders and jaw that lasted around 15-20 seconds. I went to Urgent Care again but nothing really came of the visit and the pain eventually faded.


2 WEEKS BEFORE THE NEXT PARAGRAPH

I was lying in bed one morning with a faint sharp tingling in my chest and jaw. The next few days there was an odd transient sensation (like a fluttering but not quite) behind my upper sternum. The rash returned on my right elbow for about a day during this time. By the end of the week my heart felt like it was being squeezed occasionally especially when my BP rose. I also felt constricted when lying on my sides. I went back to urgent care and got sent to the ER again. I would have liked to have gone a few days before but my dad is my ride right now and he thinks I'm a hypochondriac. I got an ECG and a blood test. After waiting to see a doctor he gave me an ultra sound on my upper abdomen to check for fluid around my heart but didn't see anything. then sent me to get my chest X-rayed. He came back and said everything looks fine on the bloodtests and xrays and told me to follow up with a walk-in clinic in a week. The past week my chest and stomach have been feeling tight intermittently.

The night I tried to post this I went back to the ER because my chest was feeling really weird all that day. I got another ECG and Blood test and again everything looked fine. I talked to a doctor there and she got me an appointment with Internal Medicine a couple weeks from now because I told her about the health issues my mother had before she died. I also talked to the ER psych again and he upped me to 20mgs of my SSRI, a dose I've taken before. I've had a cold the last few days and aside from a few faint symptoms and my resting BPM feeling higher I haven't noticed anything major.

16 DAYS SINCE LAST ER VISIT

I've mostly gotten over the cold/flu that I had
but the last few days I haven't been feeling great. My head, teeth/jaw and chest have been feeling funny. I went for a pretty long walk a few days ago and while I felt fine for most of it I noticed near the end that I had the taste of blood in the back of my mouth and after I got home and had some food I felt a pain in my upper middle abdomen. I did ten push-ups a day later and after doing them I felt the same pain in my abdomen and a burning in my chest. Today 
I went to the drug store and the whole time I was feeling a bit light headed.

I've got an appointment to get a family doctor in two days and my appointment with Internal medicine is a week later. Can any doctors here give me some advice on what I should tell/ask the doctor at internal medicine or what to expect? Is it okay if I take aspirin if I feel the symptoms coming back? As I don't want to be a nuisance, when should I go back to the ER?
Any advice is appreciated.",0,1770779479.0,AskDocs,1,0.5,False
1r1lzs0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1r1lzs0/i_dunno_maybe_it_was_my_fault/,I dunno. Maybe it was my fault.,"I need help deciphering our arguments, because now I worry I was the bad guy. 

He's a widower and single parent. He was pretty communicative about his limits, but only after they caused issues. I was never upset when his kid came first. I LOVED him and we were building a family together. Outside of childcare, I was always in his whirlwind. He was constantly filling his schedule and de-prioritizing the relationship. 

Our two major arguments were when he would get a last-minute window of time bc his MIL would take his son for the night. We'd agree to meet up, but communication about times and places always left me waiting. 

On his bday, he had a really stressful week that ended with a big test. He was spent and wanted to turn his brain off. I sent him bday spotify mix I worked really hard on, and he heart reacted it - nothing else. I know he was stressed, but I was kinda hurt by the low-effort response, so that probably set the tone for me. He later said ""well you didn't include any other text and just sent it by itself."" He went to a dinner and wasn't really in contact while I tried to plan \*my\* night. He waffled, saying ""I dunno, I have a friend in town I'd like to meet up with."" I asked if he wanted to fly solo, cuz his messages were coming so few and far apart and he didn't communicate he meant all of us. 

The dinner went way longer than intended, but he wasn't communicating about it. I tried calling and he declined the call and texted saying it was still happening. I wasn't trying to be obsessive. I just wanted to get ready and head in whichever direction.

He later said he just wanted to decompress with friends and not look at the phone. Which is fine, but when we were together, he was CONSTANTLY on his phone. I was invisible. Even when we were with his son in the park, he would sit on a bench and scroll. When he was with others, he'd stop communicating for hours, which was usually fine, but sometimes I needed responses and when I asked he said he was lost in those moments. 

Then he went to a bar by himself and said he'd come where I was after. The time changed but still wasn't clear. I could have already left and met him. He later said he had a stressful convo with his mom and wanted to decompress, but didn't say that in real time. I sat alone at the bar until midnight and he gave an ETA of 12:45am! By this time I had told him gently I was feeling out of the loop and he said he was afraid if he came it would ""be bad."" So he went home. He always seemed to think I was going to like, flip out on him. I just wanted to chat it out and move on. 

The next day, he said that he wanted  freedom and to not be burdened with making a plan. But I still felt like an afterthought. He said ""I didn't do anything wrong"" and ""the only thing I'm sorry about waiting so long to decide not to come."" I understood wanting freedom, but he also said ""maybe you were putting yourself in a place where you wanted to be hurt.""

Did I put too much pressure when he was exhausted? He was too exhausted to make a plan, because with a son, \*everything\* had to be planned. I empathized with that, but it felt disrespectful. I told him I would have gone anywhere he wanted or just to where he was.

He said this felt like ""control."" That I wasn't being proactive enough - I should have decided to go home when it became too late. 

Months later, he went to a concert with some people and asked if I wanted to come out after. Since I prodded a lot the other time, I didn't push and let him lead. I earlier said I was tired but then said I would have a coffee bc I wanted to come out. He said one of his friends wouldn't make it and I said ""oh I would have liked to meet them.""

He messaged during the concert and said it should end around 9:30. I figured he'd let me know when they were on their way somewhere else and I'd head out. Then didn't text me until 10:30 - when they arrived at their destination. I could have left earlier, but now it was late. He said everything from ""well you said you were tired"" to ""we didn't have a definite plan"" to ""it was chaotic after the concert, I couldn't really stop and text."" 

I told him I wasn't upset, but that we should table the convo since this miscommunication kept happening. Then he stopped responding. This is the part that actually upset me. I thought I was being mature saying ""I'm not mad, let's address this later.""

The next night, I tried to explain my POV. He got really upset and yelled at me for being ""lazy,"" and bringing my ""baggage."" He kept interrupting me and wouldn't let me explain my side. I told him I didn't poke because that stressed him out the last time. He said ""so you did the exact opposite?"" Nothing ended up being resolved really, but I did say I was sorry and would try to do better. 

Over the next few days, he spiraled and brought up all these things about how he hadn't been feeling growth, how he had to make ""concessions"" in the relationship. When I asked what those were, the example was that I wanted a facetime call every night, if only for 10 minutes, when he wanted to be able to wash dishes and talk on earbuds. I was like ""we talked about that weeks ago"" and he said I was dismissing him. All of these grievances came out of nowhere and blindsided me, which understandably made me emotional. Then my emotions were ""too much"" and he didn't feel like he could express himself because he would have to ""field"" my emotions (a phrase he used a lot). 

This entire thing broke a floodgate of feelings and issues he said he was having for a while that I never knew were happening. Like a failure to connect or tap into the deeper parts of me (meanwhile he playing phone games in bed or scrolling on the couch and often didn't look up at me for like a half hour at a time).

He'd also make big promises ""I'm going to come to every single one of your events"" and then every time an event came up, something else came up. When he came to finally meet my friends, he was quiet and cranky. He said he wanted to ""keep things loose"" which felt like he'd come if there was nothing better to do. When I told him it hurt, he got defensive, that he had so many responsibilities and people relying on him, ""do you think I wanna go to \[family picnic\] or some \[my\] event? I'd rather go to a baseball game by myself."" Yet I always came to his events, art shows, friend hangs, etc. 

I always asked if he really had the capacity for a relationship, and ge said I should gauge if what he could provide was enough. I wanted to believe he had the capacity, because he said he did, but he still failed to show up for basic relationship things. 

Maybe I put too much pressure, but it seemed like he could never be present or see how his actions affected me and just got defensive.

Now, 7 months after our BU, he's engaged to someone 13 years younger. After he said he was going to take time and reflect on his capacity and mental space. Ha!",1,1770779464.0,AvoidantBreakUps,0,1.0,False

Shout out u/RevolutionAlex for this amazing 1991 US MRE!!! Thank you man!

A long discontinued menu, much to my dismay after trying this amazing ration! These Meatballs, in my opinion, are far superior to today's modern Meatballs in Marinara Sauce found in Menu 8. 

Pics 1-3 show packaging and contents. Really, a very nice spread!

Pics 4-5 show a very unique spoon! Look at the details on that spoon! Crazy! I did not know they ever used spoons like that! A wonderful addition to my spoon collection!

Pic 6 shows the rancid caramels. Unfortunately these contain milk, so they don't hold up well! I did try one and had to spit it out. 

Pics 7-8 show that amazing Tasters Choice with the accompanying non-dairy creamer and sugar. A great cup of coffee!

Pic 9 shows the gum; it was very hard but tasted great and had a wonderful chew once softened!

Pics 10-11 show the chocolate covered cookie, crackers, and peanut butter! Putting some pb on that cookie was a pro move! Shocked the cookie was good, but so happy it was! Sometimes they are rancid at that age.

Pic 12 shows the Meatballs! These were fantastic! Were they a bit dry, yes, but for being 35 years old, crazy good. So flavorful, small hint of spice, rich gravy, and a very ""meaty"" bite! I would rather have these than the current Meatballs, which I like very much as well! You cannot believe how shocked I was at just how good they were. The beef is mixed rice to form the Meatballs. Pic 13 shows the clean bowl club trophy!

Pic 14 is one of my all time favorite ration components,  a freeze-dried fruit square! This one was Peach, and it was sweet, crunchy, and so satisfying! They made these in Peach, Pear, Strawberry, and Mixed Fruit, and I have been lucky enough to have tried them all, in perfect condition! What an experience! 

As you can see, I really enjoyed this MRE a lot! Thanks to u/RevolutionAlex,  I now have 2 more 1991 menus to eat and review, Chicken and Rice, and Beef Stew! Stay tuned folks!

1r1lxbx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r1lxbx,help me layout + furnish my living room / kitchen nyc apartment,"Hey all — just moved into a 1BR NYC apartment and would love help figuring out the layout and furniture choices for my combined living room / kitchen area.

What I’m looking for help with:

	•	Best layout for the space

	•	Couch size/style, rug size, coffee table suggestions

	•	Dining table size/shape + placement

	•	Where to mount the TV (wall vs media console, height, etc.)

	•	Anything else I’m missing that would make the space feel more intentional

Style goal:

Mid-century modern inspired — warm woods, clean lines, airy and calm. I’m trying to balance out some pretty awful dark cherry kitchen cabinets, so lighter tones, contrast, and smart material choices would be huge.

Furniture I’m considering (for scale reference):

	•	Leaning toward the Room & Board Weber sofa (86” x 42”)

	•	Also considering the Room & Board Metro (88” x 38”) if that fits the space better

Would love thoughts on which footprint works better for an NYC-sized living area.

Constraints / context:

	•	NYC-sized space (so scale matters)

	•	Open living room + kitchen sightlines

	•	Want it to feel cohesive, not cluttered

	•	Comfortable enough for everyday living, not just “looks good”

I’ll drop photos + a rough floor plan in the comments. Open to both specific product recs and high-level layout ideas.

1r1lvs7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r1lvs7,"[Acne] Has anyone experienced a sudden, persistent break out like this?","Hi all! I’m F24 and looking for any insight into how my skin might have deteriorated so quickly in such a short amount of time.

I went from oily acne prone but smooth skin to complete cystic, on entire face in 2-3 months. I’ve also had an outbreak of perioral dermstitis. I’m currently on accutane, but want to maybe understand what happened and how to prevent it in the future. I'm so sad I might have ruined my skin and might not be able to continue with the accutane due to other side effects.

**Retracing my steps:**

Apologies for the Novel lol.

I have always had oily, acne prone skin, and bad picking tendencies.

I first went to a derm a year ago regarding a few too many pesky pimples that scared me. Looking back it was literally nothing but I hated having any bumps and knew I was best at not picking my skin when it was clear. The derm diagnosed me with rosacea, and prescribed me clindamyacin+benzoyl peroxide cream. It burned my face day 2 so I stopped using it and kind of considered her a dud.

I continued using a gentle routine and occasionally BP or SA on spots with varying success.

My biggest focus was finding an SPF that worked for me: Any kind of chemical sunscreen would make my face flush and burn and break out. Zinc worked best, but it was heavy and often formulated with oils that caused CCs. I also struggled with removal- I had been double cleansing, once with oil, then again with regular face wash. I avoided washing my face in mornings to avoid stripping. I started a few vitamins and diet improvements hoping they would help my skin.

Eventually I just gave up on actives and just started using zinc cream on everything, and just washing at night and moisturizing. An spf I used over the summer was a suspect in causing a bunch of closed comedones, so I stopped using any spf once the UV hit 2 in my area.

September was also when I started feeling extremely stressed out due to a few different events in life, but they were silly and I didn’t expect them to change my life much. I also began a prescribed VitD supplement once a week.

In October of 2025, I experienced a break out of tiny red bumps all over my cheekbones. I thought it was rosacea type 2, panicked, immediatley went back to the derm (same one, she was just closest and covered by insurance)

She prescribed me Soolantra and metrogel. I was consistent with the Soolantra for 8 weeks but gave up when my skin barrier started feeling worse and I saw zero improvement, and an increase in cystic pimples.

My skin went down hill from there. My entire face erupted, despite keeping my routine extremely gentle, and the breakouts suddenly started leaving dark spot and red spots. This had never happened to me before.

I went back to the derm, who suggested either spirolactone or accutane. I chose to start the iPledge process with accutane because the idea of having to take spirolactone indefinitely seemed unappealing to me. However, I was also PETRIFIED of accutane. I spent the entire month long waiting period crying and stressed about my skin, and starting the drug. Obviously my skin did not improve lol.

I was given Clindamyacin for the POD, which has helped a lot. Did nothing for the acne though.

I’m now on 20mg a day and constantly second guessing my choice. I was so sick of my skin freaking out at everything and just wanted to nuke it, but now I’m torturing my entire body with this drug.

**Concerns:**

My rosacea makes my skin not tolerate so many things. I cannot use retinols or exfoliants because it just freaks my skin out. I can’t use chemical sunscreens. Anything vaguely comedogenic gives me closed comedones. It seems like accutane is my only option.

I have tried cutting all kinds of things from my diet as well, but realized I was losing weight I could not afford to lose. So restricting is not really a viable option. I thought accutane could be a workaround so I don’t have to cut out eggs or cheese or bread.

**Potential causes:**

Stress

Diet

Destroyed my barrier

B12? (I stopped the b12 when my skin got worse, but it did not improve after 2 months, so probably not)

High vitamin D dose? Or the deficiency?

Bad reaction to gentle products (S.Nature Rice Fomaing cleanser and Geek and Gorgeous Hydration Station)

**More background:**

I do not drink. I do not smoke. I don’t eat out more than 2x a month. I don't even drink coffee. I change my pillowcase daily. I use clean towels to dry my face. Clean hands for product application. Billions of pimple patches have been used. 6-9 hours of sleep a night, working on improving that. Zero drug use. I work out daily. Lots of yoga.

I got my hormones tested right before starting accutane as well, came back healthy and clean and whatnot. My thyroid is fine, all my blood work is fine other than Ferretin and Vit D which I take supplements for.

1r1lubj,https://www.reddit.com/r/FATTravel/comments/1r1lubj/raffles_sentosa_2026/,Raffles Sentosa 2026,"Being a huge fan of the Raffles, I've accumulated a lot of Accor points over the years. The Accor portfolio is pretty dismal, with the Raffles hotel being the only luxury property in their portfolio, and the majority of my trips are work-related, so I haven't had a chance to use the accumulated points.

I had a day between some personal travel and work travel in Singapore, so decided to blow my points on a stay at the new-ish Raffles Sentosa. The hotel opened in March or April 2025, and I've been itching at a chance to try the property.

[Pictures](https://imgur.com/a/eqdRucd)

The resort is on Sentosa island and has a very different feel that the classic [Raffles Singapore](https://old.reddit.com/r/FATTravel/comments/1imm42a/reviewama_the_raffles_hotel_singapore/) about 30 minutes away. Tons of green, open spaces, small buildings dot the property, and it feels more like a Bali or Maldives resort than something in Singapore. The closest comparison I can think of is my stay at the [Hoshinoya Bali](https://old.reddit.com/r/FATTravel/comments/1emcnr4/ama_hoshinoya_bali/). 

The hard product is amazing here. Each of the villas comes with its own pool, courtyard, separate living room and bedroom/washroom. Massive units with tons of privacy. Tons of green around the resort. It's like walking through a forest. The resort actually isn't huge, and it's often faster just to walk to reception via the walking pathes than wait for a buggies, that have to take a long winding path. There is a neat ""Rolls Royce"" buggy though, but the hand brake doesn't seem to work, and while my porter was getting my luggage, I decided to take a seat in the buggy. Immediately the buggy started rolling backwards. I jumped out and tried to stop the buggy before a massive accident. As it turns out - the buggies don't weigh that much, and I could easily stop it from moving. Crisis averted. Did get my heart rate pumping though.

For what it's worth, the Raffles Sentosa run independently from the Raffles Singapore. I asked the Sales Manager to see if we could also get corporate rates for Raffles Sentosa when it opened, but we were told the two properties don't interact much other than having the same branding. The snacks and coffee, tea are also from different brands. Raffles Singapore uses their own tea, while Raffles Sentosa uses a mass market brand. Both Raffles use Nespresso, but Raffles Sentosa also has bags of Bacha coffee. Classic Singaporean snacks greeted me as I entered the room - salted egg chips, a Sentosa Sling upon arrival, and a plate of baked goods and figs welcoming me to the suite.

The soft product. Well, that leaves a bit to be desired. I arrived around 11, and the only open restaurant was the Italian restaurant, that was still serving its breakfast buffet until 12. No A la Carte options, so I elected just to wait until 12:30 for lunch service. Fairly limited and expensive menu. Tried a beef tartare and their signature pasta. Decent, but not really worth the price. Didn't bother with dinner, just got a grab into Singapore proper.

Overall, worth a weekend staycation stay or something. The location is on Sentosa Island, so not super convenient to get to the rest of Singapore, but if you just want to relax and crash, it's well worth the visit. The property is less than a year old, so I hope some of the rough edges will improve with time, but I hope to return again in the future.",2,1770779053.0,FATTravel,0,0.75,False

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).

Im a home barista and I've been looking at competing in the New Zealand Brewers Cup. This took me down a rabbit hole and I discovered, albeit late, the Hario V60 Drip Assist. 

I love it. It's a great way to nail consistently repeatable coffee.

What it's really great at is controlling agitation. Agitation plays a massive role in the brewing process. Many people use a goose neck kettle to help control the flow of water - as do I! but gooseys can be a bit spenny, and you probably dont want to take them on the road or to the office. Step up the Drip Assist. 

For anyone who is struggling with getting consistent brews out of their v60, get one of these. 

I wrote a bit more about the drip assist at my blog, but the main dets are there and you don't actually need to go read it.

1r1lp36,https://i.redd.it/nbf8ypp46sig1.jpeg,I don't know if I'm brave enough to even try this after the horror stories.,"Followed 

I made a post asking about true coffee fragrance recommendations, and based of the comments I bought testers of all of them. 

My mistake:
Not reading reviews about the recommendations

I was recommended Followed.

I only waited a couple hours after posting to buy them all online, and then after I purchased them someone commented that I should read the horror stories about it first. Horror stories? Online it said coffee and maple how bad could that be?
Then I started reading the reviews on fragrantica, and then the discussions on here about it and immediately was filled with regret.

Can't wash it off. Smells like curry. Spray it outside. I had to leave it on the front porch. It stunk up my mailbox. Smells like maggie.

Some people reallh love it, some people really hate it. There is a review somewhere on this sub that made me die laughing. It had a breakdown of the day and they liked it in the beginning, but towards the end says ""I hate myself. I am spicy vegetables shame"".

So, I just got it today and there was no smell in my mailbox. No smell coming from the package. Good sign. When I took all of my minis out, that was when I smelled curry. Sweet curry. But very muchMaggie. I was going to use gloves to open it but since it wasn't super strong I figured I'd just open it without gloves. I held it up to my nose, and up close it 100% smells like maple syrup. But kind of a savory maple syrup. Not a hint of coffee though. 

And what that tells me is it will smell like maple syrup at first but the dry down is 100% going to smell like curry as time goes on, which is consistent with many reviews. The thing is, I wont know what it actually smells like until I put it on myself because it will mix with my body chemistry different than some peoples. But because of my initial sniff I don't know if I want to risk it and smell like curry, because many people have reported you cannot wash it off. And one girl mentions using bleach which worked. 

So... I don't know what to do. I might keep it incase I ever need something for self defense or revenge. I think unwashable curry is a solid punishment.

I started out with crab pots and think they're fantastic, and was hoping to give people some tips on how to use them right!

Time
-
The biggest thing with crab pots is that collecting them doesn't actually take any extra time. If you watch, time freezes briefly as you collect them, so if you're already going a direction anyway, the collection process is (basically - see Luremaster below) free! Most people are, unfortunately, placing them in areas(like the ocean) where they rarely go. A crab pot you never harvest is worthless!

The trick is to place them all the places you already like to go. Personally, I had the beach farm, so I just put all my buildings around the outer edge, so I could grab all of them as I ran the circle around my home! Another great place to put them is on the river in town; you can grab them as you run back towards the Cindersap Forest from Clint's. And if you like running through the cindersap forest regularly, you can fit loads of them down there, as well, and collect them as you collect forage! 

Another part is that they are hardly worth bothering with if you only have a handful! If you're collecting like 4, then you get like 4 unique items, which take up 4 inventory slots. If you have 40, then you get 40 items, but they stack into like 8 inventory slots! So, like, 5x more efficient, and it only gets better from there. 

Trash
-

Another part is...trash is amazing! Everyone tries to GET RID of trash, but for me, trash is one of the main ways I get iron and coal! On an average day I'm getting something like a dozen coal and iron ore! You do need a good bank of recycling machines, to be fair...but the main cost there is IRON - which you get back from the recycling! Talk about a good deal! Besides, by year 2, compared to buying stuff, you're basically getting like an average of 150 gold per trash you recycle, which is awesome. In time I am collecting my crab pots, I average about 20000 gold per hour - 25k with Book 'o Crabbing! 

But if you want a real tip for this? Lategame, Recycling Machines are one of the best uses for Hoppers. You can collect from them as fast as you can run(even with +2 speed from coffee and crab cakes AND +0.5 from the daily blessing), but you have to stop and run back and forth to fill them back up again, so hoppers can make collecting them upwards of 3x-4x faster. I have 25 hoppers rigged to 25 recycling machines, constantly processing trash. 

And I feel good that I'm sweeping the seas clean of garbage! Literally finished the community cleanup quest in 30 seconds, lol. 

Sashimi!
---

This part is REALLY important. Most crab pot products are cheaper than 75g each - which means you can turn them into Sashimi(Linus friendship recipe) and dramatically increase their price! Better still? This basically turns the Qi Cuisine quest into easy mode. Nowadays I literally just stockpile my fish, and whenever that quest comes up, I finish it instantly. Not to mention, basically unlimited food and energy!

Luremaster is Underrated
-
Oh, lastly, Luremaster is better than people think. Sure, sure, stuff like fishing for lava eels is great with Angler and Artisan. In a full day you can get like 150k gold. But Luremaster doesn't just save you the bait, it saves you the TIME it takes TO bait! In my testing, accounting for screwups, going slower from baiting, collecting the bait, and so on, Luremaster improved my collection times by 33-50%! Meanwhile, even with deluxe bait, I was managing an average of maybe 25% more profit - AND I lost some of that lovely TRASH! Which is actually more valuable than the majority of what you catch, even with Angler. 

---

Hopefully I've convinced some people to give crab pots a try! They're not for everyone - despite taking no INGAME time, it does really stretch out the length of a day to harvest them all - but for me, they're 100% worth it!

Just remember; you don't have to harvest them EVERY day for them to be worth it. If you leave them for a day or two...they'll still be there!",244,1770778506.0,StardewValley,37,0.96,False

College educated, fluent in English, sarcasm, and the occasional bad pun. Big fan of Suits because nothing says thrilling drama like corporate loopholes and HGTV. In the kitchen, I cook, bake, and argue with my oven over who’s the real master chef.

I don’t drink or do drugs. Unless you count caffeine, in which case I’m basically a bean addict. My nightlife is less clubbing till 2 a.m. and more building pillow fort empires and bingeing Netflix until cliffhangers leave me emotionally bankrupt. Basically, I’m a homebody with a 5-star rating on Yelp for snacks.

I lean conservative. Not here to debate politics, just putting it out there in case that’s a dealbreaker. Better to find that out before we bond over banana bread and binge-watching.

About You

You’re in your 30s, educated, and steady in your career. Bonus points if you can use there, their, and they’re correctly without breaking a sweat. You can hold a conversation that’s more than “hey” (plot twist, you’re actually interesting). You send memes that perfectly capture life’s chaos because sometimes a GIF says more than a whole paragraph.

You don’t smoke, do drugs, drink heavily, have tattoos, piercings, or kids. I like my drama like my Netflix, available on demand, not in real life. You’re thoughtful, communicative, and remember the small things, like my coffee order or which side of the blanket I hog.

Lastly, you live in the same country. Love letters are cute, but customs forms are not, and I’m not DHL Express. I don’t handle international returns.

**1. Photon Latency (Morning Light Timing)** Getting bright light (>10,000 lux) within 20 minutes of waking sets your circadian master clock via melanopsin receptors. I tracked this daily and the correlation with my afternoon energy levels was striking, especially on cloudy days when I skipped it.

**2. Caffeine Metabolism Window** My half-life is approximately 5.5 hours (normal CYP1A2 metabolizer). That means if I drink coffee at 2 PM, I still have \~50% of that caffeine competing with adenosine at 7:30 PM. Once I calculated my personal ""Caffeine Wall"" and stopped guessing, my sleep onset latency dropped from \~40 minutes to \~15.

**3. Chronotype Alignment** I stopped trying to be a ""Lion"" (early bird) and accepted I'm a ""Bear."" My cognitive peak is 9 AM – 12 PM, not 6 AM. Once I restructured my day around this reality instead of fighting it, everything changed.

**The Tool:** I built an app called **ARC** to track all three of these automatically. It runs a 15-question scientific diagnosis based on the Munich ChronoType protocol, identifies your type, and generates a ""Daily Trajectory"" you can follow.

The Circadian Compass gives you a real-time 24-hour ring showing exactly where you are in your biological day. Your peaks, your valleys, and your key intervention windows.

Me, my best friend and her boyfriend went on a vacation together, us three hang out a lot and it’s never been awkward or bad, we all get along and even went to a mini one day trip to a festival together so I thought this vacation will be great. It was, but he was really annoying all trip.

Both him and her tend to be very obsessed with how much money they spend which can be a really good thing but they made problems from such non issues, mostly him tho. Every time we ate or drank a coffee he only talked about prices and how expensive something was, even when it wasn’t, he would joke shame me for getting stuff more expensive and make like sassy comments at me all the time and then cover them up as a joke.

At the last day I even snapped at him. The “joke” he made was when he saw me put my left over money in my wallet and said “How do you only have 100 left, you started off your day with 600, I ONLY spend 100 and something”. He made comments less annoying than this all trip but I couldn’t take it and I yelled in front of everyone “Oh my god really? That’s awesome, well I spend more than that” and he went quiet for the rest of the night which was such a blessing.

I also own him 4€/4.90$ and he’s been holding it over my head all trip even tho I literally said multiple times that I will pay him back when we’re home asap because I didn’t have money on me on the trip that isn’t my breakfast money, and he genuinely wanted to take my breakfast money and leave me to starve just so I can pay him back!

He kept talking abt the money we all spend all trip and nothing else, I tried to change the convos to what we’re going to do that day, or how much fun the thing we are doing is but he kept switching it to how much money is being spend and it got on my nerves.

Of course being careful of how much money you spend is good and should be encouraged, especially with younger adults, but my god he made my whole vacation feel so tiring.

Also let it be known I didn’t even spend that much money that vacation, we weren’t at a fancy hotel or any fancy places, we just literally spend all our money on food and museums.

Thanks for reading, needed to let this out because I feel like I am going to snap at him, and that genuinely wouldn’t help anyone",4,1770777749.0,TrueOffMyChest,2,0.84,False

Nothing big. No branding. Just simple public meetups.

A couple of weeks ago after one of them, two people who showed up ended up staying back and talking long after everyone left. I didn’t think much of it.

Yesterday one of them messaged me saying they’ve been meeting regularly since, grabbing coffee, working on projects together, just enjoying each other’s company. Apparently it started because neither of them wanted to deal with dating apps anymore but still wanted to meet someone organically.

That honestly hit me.

When I first posted about doing these meetups, I wasn’t sure if anyone would even show up. I half expected it to flop. But seeing something small lead to real connection — even if it’s just friendship or something that grows slowly — feels meaningful.

I’m not trying to build some big thing out of this. I just think a lot of people are tired of swiping and awkward DMs and would rather meet in a normal setting.

If you’ve ever felt that way, I’m thinking of hosting another small one soon. Nothing intense. Public place. Casual vibe.

I wonder if anyone else has experienced this. It has been a couple months since I stopped drinking tea and coffee and it still has not improved my symptoms. I take the plant based iron supplements whenever I feel my symptoms are getting worse. I feel it initially helps but then my pica just gets worse again. I’m wondering if you guys have any suggestions? I do eat legumes often and it has not helped. If there is anyone else in a similar situation or has been in a similar situation, I would like to hear your opinions. I am not sure if being vegetarian is optimal.

for context, i've been into enneagram for a few years and i feel like im constantly rediscovering myself (i thought i was a 3 when i was really disordered in high school, for example). and i am confident that i am in the withdrawn triad, so i will try to write about myself with a questionnaire i've seen on here!

1. Tell me about your internal experience of yourself. What makes you, you?  
\- I am very interested in learning, and i love music, it's one of my favorite things. i am also very empathetic and justice oriented, i'm very involved with social justice in college. i'm also kind of shy, i tend to stick to smaller groups of people who i share common values/interests. and i am also autistic. i often feel very confused about myself, and when i try to ""soul-search"", i have a difficult time.

  
2. You just had a really good day. Describe it. It can be a real recent example or an aspirational one.  
\- I get to wake up late and spend some time in my bed, i love my bed. i can make my favorite breakfast (coffee and a bacon and egg breakfast sandwich), and i might have plans to see my friends later, who always make me happy. if i'm spending the day by myself, i get to spend the day outside in nature and reading/engaging in some sort of music.

  
3. If someone is upset with you, what is the typical reason for it? Give a recent example.  
\- the last time someone got upset with me, was last fall, and they basically told me i had no empathy and was a terrible person because i said the wrong thing (after realizing, i was extremely apologetic and did what i could to communicate with the person to understand why they were upset)

  
4. What are you like when you're stressed? What are your coping mechanisms? Give an example of a recent stressful situation and how you handled it.  
\- i panic, a lot, and often rely on my friends for guidance in the situation. it happened late last month, where i was terrified and relying on their advice in the heat of the moment, but after talking things out i felt better, and handled the situation calmly.

  
5. What pushes your buttons? What makes you angry? How does your anger manifest? Can you be openly angry with others?  
\- i can be openly angry with others but only certain to a point. it is often when someone i care about has been severely wronged, or there is a great injustice happening and nobody cares (in a school server, someone was sending racist messages and i was the only one who said anything, so i was very frustrated with the lack of action)

  
6. What’s your deepest fear? Why is that your fear?  
\- i genuinely do not know. i guess i don't want to be hated by everyone for a reason i don't know.

  
7. What types of memories cause you the most shame? What feelings cause you the most shame? What is it about them that causes you shame?  
\- not sure about shame, but i often think about previous social missteps when i was younger, which make me cringe

  
8. What is your relationship with pleasure? What gives you pleasure? Can you have pleasure when you want it, or do you have to earn it?  
\- i love treating myself with food (specifically fun coffee drinks) and do it often :)

  
9. What’s your relationship with authority? Think both abstractly and with specific authorities in your life, possibly your parents, boss, religious leader, doctor, or government figures? Are you an authority?  
\- i respect them, and if i see the authority figure as someone close to me i usually hold a lot of admiration, but i also don't have blind faith in anyone (i don't think!)

  
10. When your mind wanders, what are you thinking about?  
\- anything! usually big social things coming up, or right now, my job interview

  
11. You have a big decision to make. Describe how you decide what to do.  
\- i talk to the people around me and consider my own opinions on the situation, before moving forward. i might also do a tarot reading for myself

  
12. What’s your biggest flaw?  
\- i am really bad at sharing if i'm uncomfortable, and if i don't catch myself, i can sort of become someone who gets walked over

  
13. What makes you special? (Or, if you don't feel special, what at least makes you different from other people?)  
\- i'm not sure if i see myself as special, but i think i have a unique way of looking at the world.

  
14. How much of your mental energy is spent on thinking about each of the past, the present, and the future?  
\- i think quite a bit about the past and the future, but not often the present

  
15. You unexpectedly find yourself with a whole weekend with no obligations, and everyone else is busy. How do you feel about it? What do you do?  
\- i'd feel good! i'd just chill, even if i missed people

  
16. What’s your personal vibe/style/aesthetic? How cultivated vs natural is it, and how much time do you spend on it? Do you turn it on and off?  
\- i don't really think i have one, it's more of a mental/social aesthetic. i do find myself ""masking"" depending on social situations

  
17. Which of the following is the most like you? Explain. A) I know what I want, I go out and make it happen, and people won't stop me. B) I am content to be on my own and not draw too much attention to myself. C) I have to be responsible and dedicated, and I put others’ needs first.  
\- i think a mix of B and C, but mostly B

  
18. Which of the following is most like you? Explain. A) I dislike stress and negative vibes, and I may try to distract myself from my problems. B) I have strong feelings, get worked up easily, and am not afraid to show it. C) I don’t like to let my feelings show; they get in the way of being efficient and logical.  
\- a mix of A and C, but mostly because i don't know how to let my feelings show, so i just don't

  
19. Which of the following is most like you? Explain. A) I look to others for feedback and guidance and am willing to be flexible when needed. B) I am always aware of how things could be better, and I’m disappointed that they are not. C) Deep down, I am afraid people won’t give me what I need unless I make it worth their while.

My boyfriend and I grabbed some toast, a hard-boiled egg and coffee. The Jeep was already waiting to take us to the scuba rental shack.

My boyfriend Leni & I needed some solitude.  We heard the island had the latest in virtual reality and free massages.  We’d finally been able to afford it and it was nice to escape the doldrums of winter to the warm tropics.

I started to get curious when we didn’t reach  the underwater park in the time the guide book said.  Then I saw the blob on the beach.

Perhaps we have all read about beached whales in the news, but nothing can prepare one for the reality of this encounter.  We never really pause to think while we are reading how that smells or how the fluid oozing from it dispels sea life and mingles with the trapped seaweed under it.

“You knew this was here?”

I had a last minute cancelation and this week’s stranger was plucked from my ever-growing standby list. When I asked if they were available they said they would be happy to participate and wanted to know if they could bring their dog. I was totally down with that. I love dogs! They then followed up with “oh, it’s also my birthday!”

Being that it was also Super Bowl Sunday, I thought “birthdays, dogs and football! Now THATS a good day!”

I arrived at the Coral Cafe early, explained that a dog would be joining. So we grabbed a table in the patio. The waitress was very nice and asked if I’d like a coffee. Then she gestured to the empty seat and asked if “she?” like coffee as well. I told her that I didn’t know if I was meeting a man or a woman. She was obviously confused and a little interested. So told her about what I was doing. I had time, so I told her the whole story. She lit up and said “This is amazing! Do you mind if I check in on you to see how it’s going?” I said it was fine.

I don’t know if she told anyone else, but at least the waitress was now part of this with us!

Finally my stranger arrived. She had a little Wiener Dog in tow. The waitress popped back in to check and see if “we needed anything”. Since the birthday girl had just sat down, I said that we needed a minute.

I wished her a Happy Birthday and said that I was honored to celebrate her birthday with her. She smiled, said “thank you!” and introduced her dog (as any self respecting dog owner would). There were lots of pets, scritches and questions about the dog as it settled into “good dog” position under the table.

The waitress came back and we ordered. I got a side of bacon to share with the dog. Neither of us should’ve bee eating it, but A.) it was a special day and B.) it’s bacon…

The conversation flowed almost from the get go. She was charming, bubbly, and “Big Brain” smart. I’m pretty tech savvy, but at one point I said “wait, explain that like I’m 5..” when she was talking about her profession.

We talked, drank coffee, and bacon was shared. At points it felt as if we were old friends just catching up.

The bill came and the conversation quieted down. She had a big day ahead of her and I had Super Bowl Party to host. I split the last piece of bacon with dog and gave her a hug goodbye. She said “we should do this again.”

Past years I was able to sell off my pre-loved clothes and they're always of good condition.

This time, it's very difficult to sell my items. Even my coffee table. Not alot of interest. Is there any other platform I can sell off my clothes and other items?

I tried put on Facebook groups too, no interest.

I know there's some FB/IG accounts that does live selling of pre-loved but I would much prefer sell on my own

1r1kyjc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r1kyjc,"When Love Was a Lie, Power Became My Truth","Two days after surgery, Matthias finally show up.


I was joking around with one of the nurses when he walked in. The smile died on my face the moment I saw him.


""What the hell are you doing here?""


Matthias glanced at the bandage on my forehead, then let out this cold laugh. ""Calla's been worried about you for two days, and here you are putting on some act?""


Before I could even figure out what the hell he meant, he stormed over.


He reached out and yanked my IV line hardly.


The needle tore out of my arm and I sucked in a sharp breath from the pain.


Blood went everywhere. The nurse next to me let out a shriek and rushed to stop the bleeding.


Once it hit me what he'd done, I slapped him across the face as hard as I could.


""What is wrong with you? Did you die badly in a past life or something?""


""Are you completely blind? Can't you see the bandages on my head?""


When I first started at the company, that was when Matthias and I hated each other most.


He'd call me a stick-in-the-mud with no personality. I'd tell him he was worse than a thug.


Every conversation started with us basically cursing each other to go to hell.


The slap knocked his head sideways. He looked absolutely shocked.


He just stood there, speechless, but I wasn't about to let him off the hook.


After the nurse got my hand bandaged up, I stared Matthias down.


I was about to call security to throw his ass out.


Then another nurse rushed in and said something that made my blood run cold.


""Mr. Keane, could you sign here in the family section for Ms. Marchand?""


Before Matthias could say anything, I grabbed the clipboard.


""Sign what? He's not family.""


But when I looked at the form, the words stuck in my throat.


Right there in the spouse box was Matthias Keane's name.


Seeing my reaction, Matthias rubbed his forehead.


""Look, I know you're pissed about Calla, but her mom's dying. Her last wish is to see Calla get married.""


""Calla and I grew up together. I'm the obvious choice. After... after her mom passes, we'll get divorced.""


My hands were shaking as I pulled out my phone.


There it was - ""Hubby"" at the top of my contacts with Matthias's same old profile pic.


But in the company group chat, intern Calla Merrin had matching couple avatars with him.


【Getting married next month! You're all invited to the wedding! 】


She'd posted a picture but deleted it seconds later. Too late - I'd already screenshot it.


It was a wedding photo of them. Matthias looking at her like she hung the moon.


The group chat was going crazy, but I couldn't stomach reading any more.


I didn't have a single photo of Matthias and me together in my phone.


The doctor said the head injury left me with some complications.


I'd lost five years of memories.


I was still trying to wrap my head around apparently being married to my nemesis.


And now I'm looking at his wedding photo with someone else.


That's when a text popped up.


From my friend Jessi who works at city hall.


""Hey, about that background check on Matthias Keane you asked for. He got married a year ago.""


""Spouse is listed as Calla Merrin.""


""That certificate you showed me was fake - no official seal. Not legally binding.""


Reading that last line felt like someone drove a knife straight through my chest.


My head started pounding, everything getting fuzzy and painful.


All these leftover feelings crashed over me like a wave, making my nose sting with tears.


I was quiet for so long that Matthias must have thought I was giving in.


He frowned and stepped closer, like he was going to reach for me.


""You...""


Matthias looked completely lost, like he had no clue how to explain this mess.


Makes sense. We'd been enemies for so long, always at each other's throats.


No wonder falling for him seemed so damn ridiculous.


I took a deep breath. When I looked up again, my face was stone cold.


""Don't you know office relationships are against company policy?""


Chapter 2


Our last conversation ended with Calla calling.


Matthias was about to explain something to me when her sobbing pulled him away.


He rushed out with a quick ""Wait for me"" and never came back.


I handled my own discharge paperwork and packed up my stuff alone.


One of the young nurses felt bad for me and helped out, grumbling the whole time.


""He claims to be your family, but where is he when you actually need him?""


She was pissed on my behalf, but honestly, I didn't care anymore.


Lucky for me, I never change my passwords, so my phone still worked fine.


I found my new house address in my notes app and took a cab over.


On my way out after unpacking, the owner of the coffee shop downstairs called out, ""The usual?""


I said yes without thinking.


Before I knew it, I was holding two breakfast sandwiches.


Veggie wraps. I hate vegetables.


The second I walked into the office, a coworker teased me, ""Bringing breakfast for Keane again?""


Before he'd even finished talking, someone snatched them right out of my hands.


Calla's face lit up. ""Oh Evelina, you're the best! I absolutely love the veggie wraps from that place.""


Her fake-sweet tone made me frown.


I grabbed the wraps back and handed them to my coworker, raising an eyebrow.


""These are for you. Careful not to let the fake bitch contaminate them.""


He just stood there stunned, but before he could react, Matthias walked over.


First, he pulled red-eyed Calla behind him protectively.


Then he looked down at me.


""Just because Calla and I have the same taste in food, you're gonna take it out on her?""


The colleagues who'd been enjoying the drama went quiet after that.


They kept giving us weird looks, glancing between the three of us.


Makes sense - the two main players in this mess had already been the hot topic of the office since yesterday.


I stayed quiet too long. Someone was about to step in and defend me.


But before she could say anything, Calla started crying again.


All tears and trembling, looking absolutely pitiful. ""I didn't know you'd started liking that flavor too after I left.""


""When I saw the familiar packaging, I thought Evelina had brought them for me.""


Matthias shot me a warning look, then turned to gently wipe her tears.


I stared at the watch on his wrist, couldn't look away.


I'd seen the exact same one on the nightstand at home. The women's version.


By the time I snapped out of it, Calla was saying""If it bothers you, I can apologize.""


The fake sweetness was making me sick. Reminded me of those manipulative bitches I used to rant about for days.


I blinked and said, ""Then apologize.""


Calla choked on her words. Even stopped crying.


I smoothed out my expression and pointed to the name tag on my chest.


""You're an intern. Do you really want to mess with manager?""


""I know you're straightforward, but you don't have to be a complete bitch about it.""


I emphasized the word ""manager.""


According to company rules, Calla should've been fired.


Matthias took the fall for her, got himself demoted to save her job.


I sighed, couldn't understand why he was being so damn stupid.


Last night I'd stayed up reading through all our old text messages.


That's how I found out we'd been having some secret relationship for three years.


Matthias never once made us public.


Now watching him protect Calla like this, I had mixed feelings about the whole thing.


But I kept my face neutral and picked up a box, handing it to Matthias with a smile.


""Hey Matty, better get moving to your new desk.""


Chapter 3


I never thought about quitting.


After all, I wasn't the one who screwed up. No reason I should have to leave.


But when I was heading out after work, Matthias stopped me.


He looked conflicted, muttering to himself, ""Are you still mad? I didn't know you were getting discharged today.""


""I had no idea Calla was gonna post that wedding announcement in the company chat. It was an accident.""


I gave him a look and my mouth ran faster than my brain.


""You're so good at passing the buck, you should've been a politician instead.""


""Really treating people like they're idiots and don't know any better. Such an 'accident.'""


I hadn't been this sarcastic in ages. Matthias just stared at me, stunned.


He glanced at me, like something occurred to him. ""How's your injury?""


The back of my head was still wrapped in gauze. Couldn't see what was underneath.


When Matthias brought it up, I hesitated for a moment.


I didn't want him to keep bugging me, so I was about to tell him about the memory loss.


But then Calla came running over and grabbed onto his arm.


""You promised we'd go to dinner together. I've been waiting forever.""


Her attempt to change the subject was so obvious, but it worked on Matthias.


He told her not to make a scene, but his feet were already turning toward her.


Before leaving, he tossed me a box, looking like he wanted to say something but couldn't find the words.


I opened it. Inside was a necklace.


The diamond in the center was about the size of my pinky nail.


I snapped the box shut like it burned me. Just as I was about to chase after them, I saw Calla turn her head.


She casually showed off her hand, flashing a rock the size of a pigeon egg on her finger.


""I've been wearing the ring from when you proposed in front of my mom this whole time.""


""Mom said we should visit her together next weekend.""


I instinctively looked down at my own ring finger.


No ring. No tan line either.


They drove off, and I was still standing there like an idiot.


A coworker walked by and said hi.


""Finally gonna get rid of Calla Merrin, huh? Do you know how much trouble she's caused?""


I mumbled agreement, looking down at the papers I'd been clutching.


Calla had been assigned to Matthias's team as an intern.


Now that Matthias's authority had been transferred to me.


The first thing I did was terminate Calla's employment contract.


I thought about it for a moment, then sent Calla a message.


The next second, she sent back a photo.


That ring-covered hand holding a bouquet of roses, with the corner of a man's suit jacket barely visible.


I'd just typed back a question mark when Calla posted boldly in the company group chat.


""Don't understand why some people insist on trying to be a homewrecker.""


""I made that announcement specifically to warn certain people, but they're still hanging around.""


People started gossiping immediately, but I just laughed coldly.


If she wouldn't listen, then I didn't need to keep trying.


I blocked Calla.


She went quiet for a while, probably waiting for a response.


When my phone lit up again, it was Matthias who has been pissed off.


""Why did you block Calla? Can you stop being such a brat?""


When I didn't respond, he threatened me""Add her back, or I'll call you out in front of everyone.""


Matthias was counting on me not wanting to cause a scene over something so petty.


But I just sent him a few lines.


""Didn't the doctor tell you, as my 'family,' that I lost five years of memory?""


""Don't worry, you'll be joining your precious Calla soon enough.""


The next second, I texted my brother Noel Marchand.


""Your sister's getting screwed over at her own company. Time to come.""
