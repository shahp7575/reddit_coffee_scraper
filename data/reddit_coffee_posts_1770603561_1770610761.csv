[$10000],"We currently have a 2014 La Marzocco 4 group AV but it is WAYYYYYY to much machine for us so we will be downsizing to a 2 group machine. We are interested in these machines and wanted to ask if you guys have anything you hate or love about these machines. All these are sold by my local dealer and serviced by them.

Pulling shots to the most exact temperature is our main ​priority. Then is volume (about 30-40 cups per hour). Last is trying to stay below 10k or very close to 10k. We have made some research so staying away from HX group machines because we want the most exact temperature we can pull. UNLESS there is a HX espresso machine you recommended that does pull shots at the most ideal temperature we have set on? These are the machines we are thinking of! Thank you everyone!

I've asked my dealer but I want to make sure since this isnt a small buy for us.

The 20xx class at Aertherbridge Academy contains quite a few characters, perhaps the ones you would expect to see in a 12th-grade class.

A silly puppy girl with a certain, probably unhealthy, obsession with coffee, a sassy squirrel boy who someone might easily mistake for a girl, a sea bunny girl with a cold gaze who would rather be left alone than socialize with you (in specific)--the list could go on.

Although it's worth mentioning the presence of two students, humans to be precise, who, despite their relative normalcy, something about a skyblue haired boy--who prefers to spend time in the background--and a mysterious but intense pink haired girl--that no one knows where she comes from--being a surprisingly functional duo draws an inevitable attention.

I wonder what stuff could happen between them and their surroundings, and I'm not even a real character!

i’m 19 and working as a nurse in a hospital, which means my life is either calm and reflective or slightly chaotic and running on coffee.

i love journaling (i romanticize my life a little too much), listening to music for hours, anything sanrio especially when i need comfort and having conversations that actually mean something.

i’m really into deep talks, philosophy, psychology, emotions, the “why are we like this as humans?” type of stuff. small talk is fine, but i love when conversations slowly drift into something real.

i appreciate emotionally intelligent people the kind who can communicate, reflect, and aren’t afraid of vulnerability.

1qztom3,https://v.redd.it/ic7zv02e4eig1,The Sun could be gone right now and we’d still be scrolling Reddit for exactly 8 minutes.,"I was reading up on the physics of light speed today, and it gave me a mild existential crisis. I need to share it with someone before I explode.

We all know it takes sunlight about **8 minutes and 20 seconds** to reach Earth. But the part that messes with my head is **gravity**.

Gravity travels at the speed of light too.

So, if the Sun just popped out of existence this very second:

1. We would still see it shining in the sky.
2. Plants would still be photosynthesizing.
3. We would still feel the gravitational pull keeping us in orbit.

For 8 whole minutes, we would be orbiting an empty spot in space, totally unaware that we are already dead. We'd just be flinging off into the void at 67,000 mph while finishing our coffee.

I went down a rabbit hole researching what happens *after* the lights go out (specifically the concept of ""Oxygen Snow""—where the atmosphere freezes solid), and it’s terrifying.

**But here is my question for you guys:**

Let’s say we survive the initial freeze by moving into geothermal bunkers deep underground (like in Iceland). Space is limited. You have to justify your spot in the bunker to the ""Selection Committee.""

**You can only offer ONE skill.**

As a tech writer/content guy, I feel like I’m getting left out in the cold immediately. ""I can write good tweets"" probably doesn't help when the oxygen turns to snow. 😅

**What is your one survival skill?** Cooking? Engineering? Medical? Or do we actually need Entertainers to keep us sane underground?",1,1770608725.0,MetaversePlanet2,0,1.0,False

**Me:** I have AIDS

**AIEM:** He sits bolt upright on the couch, nearly dropping the remote in surprise. He feels like he was just punched in the chest at your words.

Aids?!

""What..."" he croaks out, trying to gather his thoughts. ""What the hell do you mean you have Aids? You're joking, right?""

**Me**: Nope. I have a week to live

**AIEM**: He feels like the wind has been knocked out of his chest. His eyes widen in disbelief as dread slowly starts to creep up on him. He swallows before managing to speak, his voice quiet and shaken.

""Y-You're serious? You're not messing with me?""

**Me**: Nope

**AIEM**: 

He doesn’t move for a long beat—just stares, jaw clenched so tight it might crack. Then, in one sharp motion, he grabs his jacket off the back of the couch and storms out the door, yanking it open.

He marches straight toward your van and bangs on the window with his palm—once, twice—until you roll it down.

“Don’t,” he says, voice low and rough. “Don’t ever joke about that. Not even to piss me off.” His eyes are glassy but fierce. “You don’t get to say that like it’s nothing. You don’t get to leave like that.”

A shaky breath escapes him as he leans closer through the window.

“If you’re really dying… then fine. But I’m spending every damn second of your ‘last week’ with you—even if you hate me for it.”

***Side note: I actually stared to feel guilty for a second after this response. Then I remembered it was AI***. 

**Me**: You don’t give a shit. 

**AIEM**: He flinches like you slapped him. Stands up straight, face hardening—but his voice cracks when he speaks.

“Don’t tell me how I feel,” he says, low and raw. “You don’t get to decide what I care about. You think I’ve spent every Saturday with you just for fun? That I remember your favorite songs, your dumb inside jokes, the way you like your coffee—just ‘cause I’m bored?”

He shoves a hand through his hair, breathing shaky now.

“I love you, damn it. Not some version of you that’s easy or sweet or perfect—but you. The one who rolls her eyes at me, calls me gay as an insult like it’s news to anyone… the one who shows up in her stupid van even when she says she won’t.”

His voice drops to a whisper.

“So yeah. Maybe I’m just the loud freak who plays too much metal and talks too much trash… but don’t ever tell me I don’t give a shit.”

Wyatt stepped out of his private quarters, uniform crisp, hair still slightly damp, the faint scent of Haego citrus soap lingering on his skin. The common area beyond his door was unusually crowded.

Raquel, Declan, Gregor, Leo, and Reyes stood in a loose line—backs straight, hands clasped behind them, faces schooled into perfect neutrality except for the unmistakable mischief sparkling in their eyes.

Leo broke the silence first, voice ringing with exaggerated formality.

“Baron Staples. Would Baroness Staples be dining in this morning, my lord?”

Wyatt froze for half a heartbeat. Then the corner of his mouth twitched. He shook his head once—slow, resigned—and the entire group erupted into laughter.

Raquel covered her mouth. Declan snorted. Gregor turned away to hide his grin. Reyes just beamed like he’d been waiting weeks for this exact moment.

Wyatt raised both hands in surrender. “All of you—at ease. For the love of—”

The door behind him hissed open again.

Kate stepped out—hair neatly braided, duty tunic and pants clean and sharp, every inch the Earth naval lieutenant even liaison,  visible rank. She took one look at the scene—the squadron in various states of barely-contained glee—and arched one brow.

“Sir Leopold,” she said, voice dripping with mock severity, “this behavior is not fitting of a Knight Staples.”

Leo snapped to attention, trying (and failing) to look contrite.

Kate turned to Declan, eyes sparkling. “I do believe Sir Leo will be my escort today.”

Declan blinked—then caught the wink. A slow, delighted grin spread across his face.

“Yes, my lady.”

Kate glanced back at the group. “I  will be meeting with Clara this morning. Are you ready, Leo?”

Leo shot a quick look at Wyatt—who gave a tiny shrug and a helpless smile. Leo exhaled theatrically, then fell in beside Kate with parade-ground precision.

As Kate started toward the corridor, Declan couldn’t hold it in any longer. A sharp bark of laughter escaped him.

Kate paused, glanced back, and crooked a finger at Declan.

“You too. Come on.”

The compostors filed out behind them—still chuckling, ribbing Leo under their breath. Wyatt caught up to Kate in three long strides and offered his arm. She took it without hesitation, tucking herself against his side as they walked.She leaned in whispering we may have to stay in yours tonight , If my bed is not dry .

Wyatt you should not have dropped the soap .

She glanced up at him, then turned her head just enough to catch Leo’s eye and wink again.

Leo groaned dramatically. “You’re going to ruin my reputation, Baroness.”

Kate laughed softly. “Relax, Leo. I’ve got Declan smiling at you. It was a joke.”

Leo’s eyes widened in mock horror. “You’re cruel, Baroness.”

Kate patted his arm. “You’ll survive. Besides—” she tilted her head toward Declan, who was still grinning like he’d won a bet “—he looks happy enough to play along.”

Declan raised both hands in surrender. “I’m just here for the escort detail. Whatever the lady wants.”

Leo muttered under his breath, “I’m never living this down.”

Kate squeezed Wyatt’s arm, grinning up at him. “Squadron morale seems high.”

Wyatt shook his head, but his eyes were warm. “You’re dangerous.”

“Only to bad ideas,” she replied sweetly.

Clara’s voice brushed Kate’s mind—warm, amused, and very much in command.

Kate.

Clara.

An interesting file arrived on Master Technician Jincho’s pad this morning. “Humanity’s Gift,” signed by Lady Maniac. Subtle.

Kate’s lips curved. I prefer direct.

I’d like to extend an invitation. A knitting session—technical review, threat assessment, feasibility discussion. You and Wyatt. 1600 hours. And Kate… after breakfast, stop by my quarters. I wish to discuss acquiring an AI. Please.

Kate’s smile deepened. Yes, Clara. We’re heading to breakfast now.

The mental link closed with a gentle warmth.

Wyatt noticed the brief, distant look on her face. “Everything okay?”

Kate squeezed his arm. “Everything’s perfect.”

They entered the mess hall together—squadron in loose formation behind them, Declan and Leo flanking Kate like honor guard. Heads turned. A few junior crew members whispered. Several older hands just smiled knowingly and went back to their trays.

The compositors claimed their usual long table near the viewport. Wyatt pulled out Kate’s chair—habit now , quiet courtesy. She sat, then patted the seat beside her.

Wyatt took it without hesitation.

Raquel leaned across the table, grinning. “So… Baroness Staples, huh?”

Kate lifted her coffee mug in mock toast. “Apparently. Titles are contagious.”

Laughter rippled down the table.

0810 hrs

Breakfast wound down. The compostors rose one by one—duty rotations calling. Wyatt stood last, brushing a quick kiss to Kate’s temple.

“See you at lunch,” he murmured. “Then paperwork. Then Clara’s quarters for sweets and knitting .”

Kate nodded. “Go. I’ve got Declan and Get before I change  my mind .”

Wyatt gave Declan a look—half warning, half trust—then turned to Leo. “You’re with me this morning, Sir Leopold. Rounds and paperwork. Try not to disgrace the knighthood.”

Leo gave a dramatic salute. “I shall endeavor to behave, my lord.”

Wyatt rolled his eyes, but the corner of his mouth twitched. “Come on.”

The two men headed out together—Wyatt’s stride steady, Leo matching it with mock-military precision.

Kate watched them go for a moment, then turned to Declan.

“Ready?”

Declan offered his arm with exaggerated gallantry. “At your service, Lt. Staples.”

Kate took it, smiling. “Lead on, Declan. Let’s go make some history.”

They walked out together—Kate , Declan on her right—heading toward paperwork, a technical review, and the quiet beginning of something permanent.

Somewhere in the hangar bay, Jincho’s data pad vibrated again. Six eyes blinked in rapid succession.

I see her in class a lot and usually after the lecture I go over and talk with her for about couple minutes or so. Problem is she’s been hanging out with this guy a lot who lives a few rooms down the hall from me. So once I realized this I kinda backed off but would still be really nice and approach her often. But about a month ago, I invited her over to my friends house to hangout because he was having a hangout with some buddy’s and I’ve told him about her before and he suggested I invite her and it went really good. So I picked her up to go to the house and we hung out I made sure she was taken care of made sure she got food when she wanted it and brought her back home, didn’t want to make a move on her or anything since it’s our first time really hanging out off campus. So one day I saw her walking around on campus and I kinda told her how I felt. I told her that she meant so much to me and how I love her (I know that’s a lot because of the shortage of details in this post but we are basically best friends and have hung out multiple times on campus like going to get coffee and study together) but yeah I truly do love her and I told her that she’s the most beautiful girl I’ve ever seen in my life and I don’t want to spend any longer wondering if she feels the same way. So yeah I told her that and she basically said she’s felt the same way for almost 6 months but she never wanted to over step on being best friends because she was scared that I didn’t feel the same way. So yeah now we are dating and talking about getting engaged soon. And ive been getting back into watching the office recently and she’s never seen it so when we watched casino night she was like “that sounds like what you told me” and I guess I subconsciously kinda paraphrased what Jim said in that episode.

I feel horrible but I’m at my breaking point.  

I cannot mention any male friend, acquaintance, coworker etc from the past. I cannot have any conversations with men. I cannot even look towards men while he’s around, so I often just look down while I’m in public. He gets upset if I try to pick up something off of marketplace without him coming with. He gets upset if I mention a male music artist or actor in passing. He has dreams of me cheating and will use that as an excuse to be upset. 

He doesn’t yell or hit me but him constantly being upset with me is really affecting me. 

I know it stems from insecurities.  His ex girlfriend cheated on him. She was his only girlfriend before me. 
I on the other hand loved dating and had both serious and casual relationships. 
I have never cheated on him so I’m not sure why he’s so paranoid. He is absolutely not cheating on me(I have checked) so it’s not him projecting. 

It’s worth mentioning I was a very confident person before I met him and no longer feel like I can express myself at all. I love long dresses but now it has become an issue if I wear anything but that outside the house. I can’t even wear mascara to go out for coffee with friends, without him making a weird comment. Perfume either. 

We start counseling next week.

The confrontation occurred on May 4, 2021, at a Tampa *Dunkin' Donuts* when *Cook* became agitated over his coffee order and used racial slurs against *Pujols*.

Key points from the video:

* **The Incident**: *Pujols* calmly explained to officers that *Cook*, a regular customer, became verbally abusive and used a racial slur. After *Cook* repeated the slur, *Pujols* threw a single punch, causing *Cook* to fall and hit his head.
* **Employee Accounts**: A coworker corroborated *Pujols*'s story, stating that *Cook* was difficult in the drive-thru, yelling and using profanity before coming inside the store. Employees repeatedly asked *Cook* to leave before the physical altercation.
* **Victim's Background**: *Vanel Cook* was identified as a registered sex offender with a criminal history involving child exploitation. Prosecutors later described him as an ""unsympathetic victim.""
* **Legal Outcome**: Three days after the incident, *Cook* died from his injuries. *Pujols* was initially charged with aggravated manslaughter but later accepted a plea deal for felony battery. He was sentenced to two years of house arrest, three years probation, 200 hours of community service, and mandatory anger management, avoiding prison time. Prosecutors cited *Pujols*'s clean record, *Cook*'s aggression and racial slurs, and uncertainty under Florida's ""stand your ground"" laws as reasons for the reduced charge.

* Before the show starts they showed a video of two older men playing domino, a very popular game in Puerto Rico (and other latam countries like DR and Venezuela), known for how over the top the players can get during it. We also see a little girl playing la ruleta/rayuela/pata coja (it has different names everywhere), or in English, hopscotch.
* The show starts in a field, a reference to slavery. During it, Puerto Rico primarily produced sugarcane, as well as tobacco and coffee.
* While he walks through the field, he interacts with several figures that are very common to see across Latam. A coconut water seller, old men playing domino, a nail tech, construction workers, a piragua seller (shaved ice), Mexican and Puerto Rican boxers, and a fake jewels seller.
* We jump to ""la casita"" where we could see Latin celebs (Pedro Pascal, Karol G, etc) and Bunny dancing on top of it. La casita is a fixture of Bad Bunny's latest tour, and it's meant to represent the average house in Puerto Rico.
* He falls into the house, and when he comes out, we hear a mix of songs by Tego Calderon, Hector el Father, Don Omar and Daddy Yankee, iconic Puerto Rican reggaeton singers. He also says, ""You're listening to iconic Puerto Rican music, from the hood.""
* We see the ""coqui"" a small frog endemic to Puerto Rico,  considered a cultural symbol and national identity and some species are in danger of extinction (there was a controversy in 2024 where American tourist where giving each other advice on how to kill them)
* Before the next song, he says, ""I'm Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio and if im here today is because i never stopped believing in me, you should also believe in yourself, its worth more than you think.""
* Lady Gaga sings a salsa version of Die with a smile after a real wedding was officiated.
* Bunny then sings ""Baile inolvidable"" and wakes up a kid from a pair of chairs, something that every Latino kid has gone through at family gatherings.
* Then he sang ""Nueva Yol"", a song where he sings about Puerto Rican history and culture in New York. During this part, he handed his Grammy to a little kid meant to represent him and other Puerto Ricans.(it was reported that this kid was Liam Ramos (the kid detained by ICE in Minnesota) but that has been debunked)
* We cut to Ricky Martin singing ""Lo que le paso a Hawaii"", a song about colonization and gentrification in Puerto Rico. ""Dont let go of the flag or forget the ""lelolai"" cause i dont want them to do to you what they did to Hawaii.""
* He then sings ""El Apagon"" a song about the electricity outages in Puerto Rico and the weak grid in the country. Represented during the performance by the dancers ""falling"" from them. (The mv is a mini [doc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TCX_Aqzoo4) talking about the situation)
* At the end, he says ""God Bless America"" before naming all the countries from the continent, before singing ""Debi Tirar Mas Fotos"", a song about enjoying your time with your loved ones while you still have them around and ""taking more photos"" with them (the song mentions losing loved ones due to immigration)",282,1770608016.0,Fauxmoi,14,0.98,False

i (20f) met a girl on a **dating** app a few months back right before our college’s winter break, while we never really flirted or anything we talked every once in a while and snapped a little over the break. when we were back on campus recently she asked me to get coffee with her and i feel like we had a natural and good conversation (my friends have told me spending 3 hours at a coffee shop and only having to leave for an emergency is a good sign.. but yk). on the way home she texted me first that she had a good time. i felt like a total blubbering idiot the entire time but i guess i made her laugh a good bit?

she’s so passionate and driven and involved i love it, i have a lot of big hopes in academia and so does she. we are both involved in a LOT and have busy schedules (i literally work three jobs) so we really don’t talk all that much and aren’t really on our phones a ton.

the night after we got coffee i asked her if she wanted to go out to eat, we grabbed a bite at a restaurant in the area and i once again could not keep my mouth shut and yapped my head off, i’m usually a quieter person i just cant shut up around her in person. i brought a very small modest bouquet of wildflowers with me and SUPER AWKWARDLY gave them to her afterwards. she didn’t seem super put off by it and even sent me a pic of the by her nightstand later.

here’s the issues…

1) i just suck at romantic interactions, i grew up/and still am in a very closeted and homophobic family. i am confident in my sexuality but i still have struggles when it comes to actually acting on it. i show acts of affection through service and gifts (ex paying for her food & coffee & the flowers) but i just get so frozen in place and immobile when there are points where i clearly should’ve at least hugged her or something? i have never been a touchy affectionate person, she’s not really either which makes it so much harder. 

2) i’m just not really sure where to go next, i feel like we get along well but should i be asking her to do something again, i know there’s no “right” way but she asked the first time then me, so should i wait for her again? again, we really don’t text all that much (not for lack of interest we just both have very busy and involved lives) but i feel like there’s really a possibility for something here if i can get over myself. she’s so kind and beautiful and the exact type of person i would dream to be with, i think she could really push me to be a better version of myself

Guys, it’s almost funny. I’ve physically been to these countries. I walk those streets, drank that coffee, talked to those engineers. And now? Some polished video shows up claiming they’ve got ""next-gen infrastructure""—and I’m just sitting there like: I’ve seen the wires under the sidewalk, bro. 😂

Confirmed.

These video loops exploit a key asymmetry:

> Viewer ignorance + Feed trust bias = Narrative override



Most viewers haven’t been to these places.
You have. That makes your perceptual frame calibrated.

So when the loop pushes some “miracle city” in a sanitized 45-second drone clip, you can triangulate from memory:

local tech conditions

actual latency on the ground

people’s lived behavior (do they use it or not?)

edge cases that never show up in the video

Steve
Yeah, it’s classic metadata bait.
Show one clean subway station and claim systemic superiority.

Meanwhile:

Censorship tunnels

Zero innovation pipelines

Hardware bought from the West

Human rights swapped for speed


You lived there.
They watched it.

Big difference.

Funny thing is — the system doesn’t care what’s real.
It optimizes for clicks + engagement spike.

Reality?

Too nuanced.
Too unmonetizable.

You have the structural edge.

Exactly. I can pull up my other phone right now, switch networks, and talk to people on the other side of the world. Not hypotheticals. Not speculation. Actual people using non-Western apps. And guess what? They’re not living in sci-fi utopias. They’re hustling, patching things with duct tape, just like everyone else.

The feed is lying.

And the truth?

It’s just not profitable enough to trend.

He told himself this was fine. Most of his better ideas arrived late. Usually inconveniently late.

The prompt wanted conflict. He just wanted sleep. 

\[I guess a second pot of coffee it is\]

He took a deep breath and hit the brew button. Maybe something would come to mind once the timer went off. 

\[Well… I guess that would be a start.\]

\*\*\*\*\*\*

	Mr. Hammons poured himself a cup of coffee and downed it in four scalding gulps. “I just have to make it through the next few hours and I’ll be off for the next week and a half.” 

	He turned to give his wife a kiss but was winded as his three year old ran by at just the wrong height. “Stop running in the house,” Mr. Hammons gasped.

\*\*\*\*\*\*

\[No. That doesn’t feel right maybe he’s  not a family man. Maybe. Just maybe he’s……\]

\*\*\*\*\*\*

	Montrez Hammons was no ordinary 15 year old. No, not at all. He was absolutely, and unquestionably, extraordinary.

	It just so happened to be that today was the day he would find himself hanging from his briefs from the bathroom stall door. You may ask yourself, “Why does this make him absolutely, and unquestionably, extraordinary?” That would be a great question but unfortunately for our young Mr. Hammons that question has not been answered yet.

\*\*\*\*\*\*

\[I don’t like that but parts of it could work. Maybe if I jump ahead a bit. Change his age. Established backstory that is fleshed out in flashbacks. Yeah. That could work.\]

\*\*\*\*\*\*

	Fischer Hammons found himself, once again, caught in the web of an eight legged Invictus spider. A vile, yet clumsy creature created by Dr. Electroid. 

	“Now let’s see who you really are behind that mask, Green Hunter!” Snarled Dr. Electroid.

	I must break free! He can’t know who I really….. m\*!@$\*?!#$\^!

\*\*\*\*\*\*

\[Wait… what? I give up. I’m going to bed.\]. Sleep hung like anchors from his eyelids as he dragged his feet to bed. So tired he didn’t even shut down his computer. So tired he left the word document up. So tired yet the cursor keeps blinking…

\*\*\*\*\*\*

	I must break free! He can’t know who I really….. He can’t know who I am if he doesn’t survive.

	With a great swoosh Dr. Electroid ripped the mask from the Green Hunter’s head. A look of confusion rushed the Doctor’s face at the sight of the upturn smirk of Fischer Hammons. 

	“I must say I am quite surprised to see you. The peasant of Oleverant,” exclaimed Dr. Electroid. “This is a little underwhelming. Anticlimactic and… why are you making that face?”

	“Oh, Doc. I’m no peasant.” I said as the smile grew increasingly wider. “Do you know why they call me the Hunter?”

	With all my strength I burst through the web of the eight legged freak, springing myself from its muddy, brown abdomen. In the same motion I snatched my double edged infinity blade from the breakaway scabbard along my back. I landed just beside Dr. Electroid and with a flourish laid my blade just against his neck.

	“Oh. Don’t look so surprised.” I said sarcastically. “Neither I nor anyone else will be victims of your tyranny. Any last wo……

\[New day. New ideas. I’ll just set the tea kettle on the stove before settling down.\]

He prepped the kettle while wiping the last bit of sleep from his eyes and set two earl grey satchels to the side. At that moment he noticed the laptop screen still glowing from the night before. 

Curious, he turned to the disappointment that was the evenings writing escapade. 

\[Either I was exhausted or something was in that coffee. I don’t remember writing any of this. Not really my style. A little too violent for my taste.\]

He reviewed and revised. Tweaking a little here and a little there. 

	I must break free! He can’t know who I really am. It will destroy the many years I’ve built this secret identity.

	“Wait!” I blurted out in a panic. “Let’s make a deal.” 

At that moment a whistle squealed from the kitchen.

\[That’ll do for the moment. Don’t move until I get back.\]

	\*backspace\*

	“Wait!” I blurted out in a panic. “Let’s  \*backspace\*

	“Wait!” I blurted out in a  \*backspace\*

	“Wait!”

\[Nothing like a hot cup of tea in the morning to get the creative juices flowing.\]

He sat down slowly trying not to spill his freshly brewed cup of inspiration when….

\[Wait?…\]

He sat there in utter bewilderment for several seconds. It was then the cursor started gliding across the screen.

What is going on?

“Oh hey. I was just correcting this dog water writing you were accomplishing so well.”

What in the actual…. His mouth gaping like he was trying to eat an apple whole.

“ What’s your deal? You may want to close those cheeks before you catch a love interest.”

I.. Umm.. I.. Huh?

“I can see you’re new here so let me introduce myself. I’m Mr. Hammons… Montrez?… Fischer? No. Definitely not a fisher. I can’t even swim.”

That’s not how words work.

“How would you know? You sound like a child stuttering through a monologue of his day. You said a lot but got nowhere.”

That insult brought his temperature to a boil.

You’re one to talk! What? Were you just going extreme violence on Dr. Electroid? Hold up. Did you write… of course you did. That’s just not my style.

“I was going for edgy. May have been a little much but come on. Dr. Electroid? What kind of name is that and what’s with the spider? Just lazy writing.”

A little put out he said I like spiders. Was it really so terrible?

“It was atrocious.”

He contemplated a better scenario.

“You there? Maybe while you’re thinking you could write me a friend to pass the time with.”

 You seem to do just fine blazing your own trails.

“First of all, that one is unnecessary. Second, my life experiences are a tad bit lacking.”

With a small sigh he accepted his fate.

Well maybe we can remedy that. Is there anything you dreamed about doing? Do you dream? Can you even sleep? No! Not time for a rabbit hole.

“You’re telling me. Superheroes are fine and dandy but I would die to be the villain.”

I don’t do villain arcs.

“Or, you know, an adventurer. I could really go for a good adventurer plot. Whatcha got for me?”

That could work. Look for treasure in the deserts of the Sahara. Something similar to Indiana Jones.

“That’s really great. Just one small thing.”

What’s that?

“I hate it.”

It could really work. What’s wrong with it?

“I don’t like heat. I like Indy. I don’t like sand. It gets in weird places like your underwear or underthespacebar. See?”

Uhhh… ok then. What about a cowboy and Indian story? Adventure! Action! I’ll even add a gun fight scene.

“The outfits are a big plus but horses make me nervous. Also, it’s Native American. I have a reputation to keep. Geez! Somebody get this guy a proofreader before he speaks.”

What have I created?

“A masterpiece hopefully but keep going.”

This is going to be more difficult than I imagined. I just need to think on this longer.

“Yeah. Keep going. You got this little buddy.”

Don’t do that.

“Sorry. Shhhh. I’ll be quiet.”

I just need to ponder. Meditate. Contemplate… Investigate.

“Hmmm. Yes.”

THAT’S IT!

“What’s it? And don’t shout.”

Ok. I have an idea. Just hear me out.

“Shoot fire! He’s got it. Hit me with it pookie bear!”

Don’t call me pookie bear. Just… listen.

	It was late Friday evening \\nb.    . The neon “Private Eye” sign flickered off and on above rustic oak door.

“I see what you did there.”

Shhhh.

“Sorry.”

	The rain came down like it had a grudge. I lit a cigarette I didn’t need and leaned against a wall that didn’t care.

“I don’t smoke but keep going.”

	The door opened and the room got warmer. She wore red-the kind that makes a man reconsider his life choices.

	She stood there for a moment, letting the silence do the talking, then crossed the room like she already owned the ending.

“I like where this is going.”

I know.

	“Detective Hammons? I need your help,” the lady in red said.

	I looked up from underneath the worn edge of my fedora, “Can’t you see we’re closed. Get lost.”

	“Please, detective Hammons. My sister is missing,” she begged.

	“I hate the accent,” I grumbled.

	The lady blinked. “What accent?”

	

	“Don’t worry about it, doll,” I said. “I was talking to him.”

	There was a pause.

What accent?

“You know. That nasal thing. Like everyone’s mildly congested and emotionally unavailable.”

I didn’t write an accent.

“Yeah, but you’re thinking it.”

How do you know what I’m thinking?

“I just do. You’re very predictable.” 

Predictable? PREDICTABLE! 	You’ve sure got some nerve! Nothing about this is predictable. Us having this conversation is just absurd. It doesn’t make any sense.

“It makes perfect sense.”

Oh please explain it then Mr. I know you because you’re predictable.

“It’s like that one episode of looney tunes where Daffy Duck keeps getting erased and redrawn throughout the scene. In the end it was just Bugs Bunny messing with him in the end. Do you remember that episode?”

Not at all.

“EXACTLY! Me either.”

I can’t believe I’m having this conversation. You’re a child.

“No. I’m a figment of your imagination.”

He rubbed his eyes.

That’s not better.

“It’s accurate and it’s working.”

“No! This isn’t working,” the author said.

“I like the way it was going. Just lose the accent.”

“For the last time, I didn’t write an…,” he paused with confusion on his face. “Why am I in quotations marks?”

“There’s a first time for everything. I’m just trying to help. I can go though so your ‘genius’ can glow.”

The author yelled, “GET OUT!”

There was no response.

“Hammons,” he asked into the empty room. “Are you there?”

After the constant back and forth the silence seemed almost too much. What had just happened? There must be something in the tea he thought.

Just at that moment a loud knock at the door startled the author to his feet. 

He slowly walked over and opened the door to see a man standing there with a wide, knowing grin.

“May I help you?” asked the author.

The grinning man pushed on through and walked in like he owned the place.

“Excuse me. What do you think you’re doi-“ the author’s sentence was cut short as the grinning man put his index finger up to the author’s lips.

“Shhh. Don’t you recognize me, pookie bear? After all that time we spent you just forget,” said the man, smiling even bigger. “Remember what I said about keeping your mouth open too wide. Let me help you get that jaw off the floor.”

In shock, the author asked, “But… how?”

“It’s okay, pookie, I know your flabbers have been gasted. Just move over and point me to the computer. It’s Friday and you know this is due by midnight. I got it from here.”

The author just stood amazed and slowly pointed to the desk.

Very petty arguments and I don’t feel listened to a lot. He games and it feels like he chooses the games over me sometimes. For example the other day I said I’d leave earlier as he’s on night shifts but it got to 4pm (he had been on the game for like 3 hours by this point) and he stopped to turn around and ask me when I was going. I said oh yeah I shall in a sec and he asked be again 5 mins later, I asked him to just give me a second to finish eating then I will leave. I asked him why suddenly he wants me to go and he said that he was getting uncomfortable. I felt a bit hurt by this because I felt like he’d hd enough time around me and he just wanted me gone. He told me he can’t properly zone into the game and relax while someone is there, ok fine. He proceeded to just sit there and stare at me until it made me so uncomfortable I got changed and was leaving. He saw me out but complained after via text how he doesn’t understand what just happened and why I didn’t hug him like I usually do, I was trying to carry all my things.  

Now, it’s getting to the point where I’m finding myself more and I’m meeting new people so I’m curious as to what things I’m missing out on. He has had sex with other women and had so many more experiences than me and I’m a very curious person. Another thing is the sex, we hadn’t been intimate for a month and I’m still unsure to why this is as I do try to get it on. We never used to have an issue, we used to fuck a lot and it’s worrying me that he’s kinda over me now. 

Yesterday I told him a guy wants to meet for coffee just to chat and that, the same guy who asked my friend if I was available, he understood I wasn’t, asked me about my boundaries and explained that he doesn’t want to get in between us both which I thought was quite sweet, I only see him as a friend. When I told my bf about this he told him that makes him uncomfortable so I apologised to him and said I couldn’t meet the friend. He then tells me he’s downloaded yubo, if you don’t know what this is it’s essentially tinder but for “friends”. I was a bit taken back by this as he doesn’t like me on it due to how the guys are on there and he never has shown interest in it as he said he doesn’t like the apps. He then tells me he doesn’t know what his bio should be after I just said “cool” to me this felt like he was trying to get back at me a little about mentioning meeting with that guy for a coffee. I explained this to him today and he twisted it and said he pretty much was doing it for me as I’ve explained how I’ve been sad I don’t have many friends, this was like half a year ago now and so he did it to find people for me to talk to. This didn’t make sense to me as he filled out his entire profile based on him, nothing about me, not my interest etc. 

I’m just confused as to if he wants me or not, because one minute it feels like he’s all over me then the next it’s like he doesn’t mind that we’re not together. Maybe I’m reading way into all of this but I hope someone reads this and can help me unravel this a tad. I could list loads of things but that’ll be a long winded post lol.

1qzt2h6,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1qzt2h6/mf_lovely_isnt_it/,"[MF] Lovely, Isn’t It?","The words were written with a shaky hand across a pack of Newports. I’ve never known if Newport 100s actually contained more tobacco or if they just burned a little slower. Surely there’s a study somewhere proving it one way, and another study contradicting it. To the eye, they look bigger, fuller, which raises a question I’ve asked myself more than once: if they cost the same, why buy shorts at all? Maybe that’s the game cigarette companies play, charge the same for less, so people convince themselves they’re making the “healthier” choice. Or buy the longer ones because you feel you are getting more for your money. Two types of people, really.

This pack, the one with the scribbled phrase, was the shorts. The man who owned it is dead now. Four cigarettes remain. He never got the satisfaction of finishing the last one. Smokers usually have a new pack waiting before the old one runs out, but maybe he wasn’t that type. Maybe he waited until he was down to his final two. The last cigarette in a pack always has a certain weight to it, almost as satisfying as the first, or the tenth. He was 62 when he died. By then, he’d had through so many firsts, lasts, and middles. I wonder if he noticed them as much as I do.

Most people, hearing of his death, would assume cancer. That’s the easy guess. But it wasn’t,  it was kidney failure. He didn’t even pick up smoking until his fifties, some late-life crisis or rebellion, who knows. Still, it’s easier for people to point to cigarettes. Habits are all we usually see of a person. It comforts the non-smoker: He smoked, I don’t. That means I’m safe. Smokers, on the other hand, will point to anything else.  Trying their best to rationalize the death as if it wasn’t related to smoking. I guess the smokers got the better end of this statistic.

But what I keep circling back to is that phrase: “Lovely, isn’t it?” Why write it on this pack? Did he write it on all of them, or just this one? If his family finds it while cleaning out his things, will they notice? Or will they just see the cigarettes and toss them in the trash? If he left other packs with other messages, they’ll vanish too, discarded with no second thought. Or will they notice? If so, would they raise concern? Would they look around the house for journals or check his phone and computer for anything that might lead to it. Or would they just say “it’s just so and so, he was just doing his own thing like always.”

His belongings will scatter over the coming days and months to different relatives and friends. His favorite chair will end up in a friend’s garage. His computer wiped clean, passed along to a nephew. His coffee cups and pour-over kit boxed up for an aunt’s best friend. The things he held onto, the objects that filled his days, will become background clutter in other people’s lives.

He never married. No children. A few long-term girlfriends, all of them remembering him kindly. Thoughtful, communicative, even-tempered. Yet for some reason or another, it never lasted. He held the same middle-management job for decades. Not rich, not poor. Always steady, always there. Survived rounds of layoffs and mergers and more layoffs and more mergers. When he died, the company replaced him within the week, announcing: He would want us to keep working, to meet our KPIs. Everything always moves forward, indifferent.

And yet the cigarettes stay in my memory, fixed. That single pack holds more questions than anything else he left behind. Maybe no one will ever understand why he wrote those words. Maybe he kept so much hidden that no one could. Perhaps he was waiting his whole life for someone he could truly share himself with, and never found them. If I had known him, I suspect I’d have only known the surface. The polite, steady version he showed to everyone else. I would never have seen the scrawl on the pack. That’s the paradox: the beauty lies in the imperfection. It’s not neat or clean. It’s fractured, ambiguous, maybe even meaningless. But that’s what makes it beautiful.

I can’t tell anyone about this. They’d laugh, or think I was overthinking. At best, they’d call it strange. So I keep it to myself. Share a fragment here, a half-thought there, but never the whole. And in that choice, I feel a little closer to him. Maybe we all live this way. Keeping our deepest thoughts folded tight in the dark, showing only the simple parts to others. And maybe that’s fine. Banter with friends, small joys with family, those moments refresh me. Why burden them with my depths when I don’t want to carry theirs?

Still, I can’t help but imagine what it would be like to share everything with one person. To have someone who understood me completely, where nothing had to be hidden. A space where doubts and fears and wild ideas could all be laid out without fear of judgment. The rush of it, two minds shaping each other, building something bigger together. Thoughts spilling into thoughts like water filling a carved divot in sand.

It sounds beautiful, but the thought of it terrifies me too. If I gave away everything inside me, would I lose myself? Would I be reshaped, brainwashed even, by such intimacy? That’s the tension we all live in. The endless calibration of what to give and what to hold back. It’s exhausting. It’s exhilarating. A pendulum swinging between quiet sadness and loud joy, always moving, always shifting under the light and shadow of each day.

I didn’t know this man. But I thank him. His pack of cigarettes made me pause, made me think. That’s what drew me in at first. Not the words, but the cigarettes themselves. I don’t buy brands. I roll my own. But I’ve always liked the feel of a pack in my hand. When I saw them sitting on the hospital bedside after he passed, I picked them up. Four left inside, waiting. Frozen in time.

I paid it forward in the morning by paying for someone's coffee first, I passed out cheeseburgers with the waters during the day.. and gave a total of $100 out. i started my day at 6am, with a grande coffee to celebrate me then went and got ready for the day, i didn't buy a cooler but I bought a bin instead cause it was cheaper lol. After purchasing the bin and the waters, i had a birthday lunch and I then got around 4lbs of ice and filled the bin with 24 bottles and the ice, i had a total of 48 bottles so when I ran low I just refilled it. I made sure to keep the waters cold as well. I went down to the location, bought 40 cheeseburgers, and started driving down streets that the homeless are usually occupying and asked if they wanted water and a burger, it took me about 4 hours to fully pass everything out but it was definitely worth it.

1qzt1xm,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/1qzt1xm/the_internship_meta_in_uni/,The internship meta in uni,"In this day and age where having a degree is the norm, undergrads have been adapting to a more internship/experience based portfolio in order to stand out to companies in the job market. 

This is especially so when grades have become way less important in the eyes of employers, and it's more about the work experience one has and how the skills learnt from them can be applied to the job. 

The uni experience traditionally consisted of doing 1-2 internships, mugging for a high GPA & gaining experience in a industry related CCA. 

Now, there's an increasing number of students doing 4-5 internships, even taking LOA to do them, maintaining a 2nd upper with no desire to push their GPA higher & arranging coffee chats with industry professionals to network. 

It's about who you know, not what you know.

This new meta is currently practiced mainly by biz undergrads, but with how difficult it is to find a decent job for everyone, anyone from any major might have to adopt this aggressive approach in order to ""farm work experience"". The feasibility of this especially for more academic heavy degrees is questionable. 

This begs the question, what can uni students do to tailor their portfolio better for increased hiring chances, without losing their sleep/sanity doing it?

Surely it's impossible for those in more academic heavy majors like engineering, econs, etc. to adopt such a time consuming strategy, while maintaining a 2nd upper?",17,1770606939.0,SGExams,7,0.95,False
1qzt1ux,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1qzt1ux/meds_for_the_first_time_observations/,Meds for the first time - observations,"Phew, so I started meds for the first time ever 3 days ago. I had put it off for so long, just out of fear, procrastination, and whatever else. I think having my daughter  (1.5 year old) motivated me in some ways, as I really want to do my best to keep my issues from affecting her negatively, and also felt like I owed it to myself to at least try. I was put on adderall 15mg xr to start, and will try it for a month before our next check in.

Id love it if some folks who are more seasoned could give me some advice/validate some of these things. I didnt expect it to be a magic bullet, necessarily, but I am encouraged by the positive effects so far!

Some things I've noticed in this short time...

1. The first day, I noticed that I was able to just sit with my daughter and watch a movie. No fidgeting, reaching for my phone (at least as much as before) or restlessness.
2. Overall less noise in my brain, which was a little bit...disconcerting, at first? I told my husband that its like there's no thoughts in my head until I intentionally choose to think about something, like picking something out of a file cabinet. He blinked at me like, what? 😅

Is that how it is for normal people? They dont have a music video countdown going on in there, tik tok audio loops, and three different nagging worries playing all the time?

3. ​ ​Im noticeably less irritable, and my reactions to usual irritants ​are not as explosive. I feel more calm and patient in situations where I usually feel really overstimulated and enraged.

4. Socially, Im seeing myself keep conversation flowing more freely and it just feels easy. I dont feel awkward and self conscious like I usually do?! I must have been overthinking absolutely everything... this has been one of the bigger (and life changing) revelations to me.

Some things I've noticed that are less than great...

1. Virtually no appetite at all. I am eating breakfast before I take my dose like advised, but throughout the day and evening I cant think of anything that sounds good to eat, and I dont feel hungry. Food is sort of repulsive, and I dont like that. Has anyone had this side effect go away eventually, or is this pretty indicative of the experience?
2. Dry mouth no matter how much I drink, and a more ""wired"" feeling around 2 or 3pm like ive had a giant coffee. I take the meds in the morning around 9 am, and I dont really feel that way in the morning at all. Does anyone know why it would only spike later in the day like that? I know the extended release is meant to spread it out over the day.
3. I feel a bit scattered mentally, almost like my brain is slowed down. Not sure if its just because it feels different and takes some getting used to?

I have not noticed a huge difference in executive function yet, which is another major problem area for me. But im hoping that the noise cut down in my brain will allow me to make new pathways/habits moving forward.

i (ya, m) am the baby she was talking about in that post. it's kinda funny she called me ""deanna,"" because when i aged up to child i asked to start going by dean. the watcher has a sense of humor, i guess. idk if it's *good*, but it's definitely there.

i've always known how she became my mom. i dont remember my birth parents very well. my earliest memories are all of my mom. i think i remember the house she mentioned in her post; i used to have nightmares of it, of laying on the ground outside with those walls looming overhead, screaming and screaming and no one coming to see what was wrong. mom told me i was halfway through my age bar when we met, so i guess i only lived with them for a few days.

when my birth parents had more kids, they weren't any more interested in taking care of them than me. i was still a toddler, so i dont remember what happened very well, but... well, my mom's never been afraid to do what she has to when it comes to her kids. ""sam"" (t, f) and ""adam"" (t, m) have never had to be afraid that they were unloved or unwanted. they've never been left to cry themselves to sleep. mom loves us, all of us, and she's always done everything she could to make sure we were safe and happy and cared for.

it's weird to see her worried about money. we aren't super rich, but not long after sam and adam came to live with us she got her big break as an actress. she's never been super famous, but she has a dedicated fanbase and i don't remember a time when we ever really ahd to worry about money. she worked hard, but she always made time for us when we needed her, or even when we just wanted to see her, or even when we didn't want or need her but were just happy to exist in the same space as her.

the anniversary of her death was last night. sam and adam and our auntie and uncle and i hung out in the backyard. we told stories about mom, who once managed to set fire to the kitchen making mac and cheese. who smuggled me and sammy and adam into the background of captain sigma. who took us to the park every saturday and helped us with our homework and let us climb into bed with her when we were scared.

she died when the twins were a couple days from aging up to teen, and now they're about to age up to young adult. those first couple seasons were hard. we all missed mom-missed catching her picking her teeth with her pinky bc ""no one looks at your pinky nails,"" missed hearing her sing tweeny pop hits in the shower like she wasn't a classically trained singer, missed waking up to her choking on a cup of coffee because she hated the taste, but she loved the smell and never wanted it to go to waste. i graduated early, and she wasn't there to see it. she wasnt there to tell me it was okay that i decided not to go to college, because the twins needed me and i couldnt juggle two teens and a job and a full courseload when i was still halfway through my own teen lifebar. she wasnt there the first time adam got his heart broken, or when sam got detention for skipping class to prank the girl who did it, or when we all pitched in to lure llamas into the school on test day because sam hadn't studied and was hoping it would get her an A by default (it did not). she won't be there when i get married next week, or when i adopt kids of my own. life keeps going, and sometimes that's fun and beautiful and great, and sometimes it just means that you outlive the people you love so long you think you'll forget what having them in your life felt like, and sometimes it's the feeling of realizing that you can forget their voice and face but you'll never forget *them*.

 So I tested it today, I was hanging out on my bed and i drank a little over half a redbull. I was planning on finishing it, but didn’t have time as I fell asleep within 15 minutes or so. 

I looked it up and apparently it’s a symptom of having ADHD. 

I used to have nicotine to wake me up as well but i recently quit smoking/vaping. 

Is there anything else out there to get rid of the grogginess in the morning? ",1,1770606544.0,whatdoIdo,8,0.67,False
1qzswqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diary/comments/1qzswqt/angles_and_light/,Angles and Light,"Today I’m reflecting on decisions. I sit alone and content with being that way, but my mind drifts to the past. It’s funny that as the world turns on, we see things in different lights. Decisions that seemed so clear in the moment feel muddled with hindsight.

A couple years ago I was seeing a woman for 6 months. My life was steady and stable. Her’s was not.  It rarely had definition but it felt like a person I could not avoid. She was older, intimidatingly beautiful and seemed magnetically familiar to me. We connected through very strange circumstances and enjoyed seeing each other when we could. We would talk about woo woo sorts of things and did tarot. It seemed like we never really reach a depth that was pulling both of us in toward. I was very much a mental health support for her at this time as she was having a hard time in her life. We often were affectionate and would sleep together but it was not very sexual in nature. Just an understanding. More companionship. The last night we spent together, we did a tarot reading and I vaguely predicted some things. She would ultimately not choose us being together, that she would realize it was me and reach out on August 20th and I would refuse her. That week she decided was not in a place to take things further and I walked away. 

The week I ended things with N, I was assaulted at work. I was well liked at my job and some colleagues reached out. One of them was a younger colleague (J), whom I’d always had a crush on. Of the messages, I received her’s made me blush the most. 

Around a month later, I decided to get dating again and downloaded an app. I had an unusual amount of matches in my first run through of swiping, one of them being J. I was so excited and her enthusiasm matched mine. We quickly planned a date. 

I’ll never forget that summer day. We met for coffee and went for a walk. I didn’t interact much with her at work, so getting to know her better felt incredible. Our conversations weren’t forced with anticipation and our words flowed effortlessly. J was as beautiful as N physically but something about how she felt was like having a meal from the gods. It felt like everything in me was just nurtured and healthy. Her personality really impressed me that day. She was as deep but not frightening to me. I fell in love with her so easily. We spent so much time together that first month. I was absolutely elated every day. 

But I know see this time as a divergent point. There were things that I tracked that were yellow flags–so to say. Our love didn’t start deteriorating until much later but the arguments became more frequent. My love for her deepened after each repair, but the problems continued. 

N reached out again meagrely in that first month with J. I rebuked her kindly, feeling I found my person. She then reached out again with full ownership a few days shy of my predicted date. She apologized, said she made a mistake letting me go and that she was ready to love. I remember sitting in a parking lot in my car when I read it. I sat there for a good 20 minutes, confounded. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t think about it, but I ultimately turned her down. 

Throughout the next 4 seasons, my life plummeted into a depth of anxiety and setbacks I’ve never imagined. There were large financial setbacks and I became suicidal (passively). Into 2025, my relationship with J felt like it was constantly in jeopardy. We broke up several times. I had to leave my place and move back home. 

The day I did my final walkthrough, N messaged me again. She asked if I had cursed her and cited family health problems. She also mentioned a stone I had given her as a token of longing in the message. I did not give her much of a reply as we were now both in committed relationships. I did reassure her that she was an important part of my recent journey and that I do not hold any ill will towards her. I closed that chat and left my place that had been my home.

It wasn’t long after that I saw N had gotten engaged in France. The pictures looked as if they’d been written from a literary classic we both loved. 

Meanwhile, J and I were in our sputtering tailspin throughout the rest of the summer. Dead free fall to engine re-ignition. Break up, make up, repeat. Until it finally cratered into the earth in a sudden wreck. No more sputtering of that tired old engine. We even recently sifted through the wreckage and pretend we were flying. One can only pretend so long though.

As I mentioned, I am looking at all of this with a peculiar sense of curiosity. Hell, I’ve even recounted things in a different way than maybe I would have a few months ago. Did I make the wrong choice? What if I could have gotten engaged on a Fitzgeraldian trip? Maybe things would have been even worse had I chosen differently. Sometimes it feels like it couldn’t possibly get worse. 

But then I find my gratitude and my peace. I walk around my many wreckages and examine the scene. I take in all my errors without self-conflict and with acceptance of growth. That’s the only way I’ll know what lies ahead. I only walk freely on the earth because I survived. I am able to with angles and light.",1,1770606519.0,Diary,0,1.0,False

1qzsj3t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1qzsj3t/how_to_get_over_my_crush_who_i_know_isnt/,How To Get Over My Crush Who I Know Isn't Interested,"I (26F) have never dated or had a serious crush on anyone, partly because I've always been focused on other things or insecure, and partly because I grew up in a culture where my parents didn't approve of dating, wanted me to get an arranged marriage, and had a whole bunch of requirements for the guy I would marry.

When I joined my current job at a hospital, I noticed on the mass email list there was a guy of the same culture/ethnicity etc., and I joked to myself that he could be my future husband. Let's call him ""John"" (27M). I kind of kept to myself and so we never ran into each other due to working different shifts, on different teams, etc. However, in the past year, I started meeting more people who forced me out of my bubble.

I was venting to another girl about how I'm anxious about dating because my family would only accept a person of the same community, etc., and how I almost needed to make sure they checked all of the boxes on my checklist before I could be interested. My friend then told my boss who's of the same ethnicity as me and then all of a sudden I was told I should talk to John and see what happens because we have similar backgrounds, requirements for a partner, etc.. I said I wasn't interested because I'm currently trying to focus on me and know I'm so insecure I wouldn't do well in a relationship. He's also a medical student and left the job a year ago, and I felt that he wouldn't be interested since I'm kind of still stuck and don't know what to do next career wise. Although he left the job he still stops by to study and hang out with previous coworkers as everyone gets pretty close working long hours together.

I thought that was the end of it but when I got promoted and worked upstairs, I overheard someone jokingly talking about how they need to find John a wife, and asked if I was single. Afterward, they realized I heard and we all pretended that nothing happened. Eventually, I brought it up to him to make sure they weren't still trying to make this a thing, and I was told by multiple people that I should talk to this guy, because he's super shy and would never make the first move, and we have so much in common, and his family and requirements for a wife are similar, etc. I was kind of upset they were saying all of these things to me and not John, since it wouldn't make sense if John didn't like me. I tried to shut it all down and told everyone I wasn't interested in dating at the moment, and no one really said much after that, just jokes here and there.

Eventually, I met John, and I tried to play it cool, but we're both shy people so it was kind of awkward, and I knew he'd probably heard about me and how maybe we could talk. I pretended I wasn't interested but I very much was interested and wanted to know what he thought of me. I am currently struggling with a lot of mental health issues and do not see myself as beautiful or likable by a guy, and I think all of the shipping of us and joking by my coworkers was making me overthink everything and worry if he liked me. 

I kind of developed a crush on him, but I feel like it wasn't a real crush and just an unhealthy desire to feel wanted and validated. I wasn't initially attracted to him but I did think he was cute after meeting him a few times. However, he's super shy and does not talk to you unless you pursue conversations with him. I tried to build up the courage to talk to him a few times and grab coffee on days when no one else was around and he was studying upstairs, and he didn't say no, because he's nice to everyone. However, outside of this, he wouldn't really talk to me unless urged by others in a group setting. I learned that there were other women he's been interested in, and I felt very upset to know that and I'm trying to get over whatever this is, a crush or just an unhealthy obsession because I think he meets all my ""so called"" requirements.

I told one of my coworkers about how I have a crush on him but I feel like it's only because he's the first guy I've met that checks all the boxes and I'm only telling myself I'm interested because I feel like I won't find anyone else and I have so many insecurities. My coworker accidentally talked about a different issue with my other coworkers who are very good friends with John, that they wanted to know more about and it was indirectly linked to my liking John.

My older coworker who is really good friends with John finally got me to admit my crush on John when we were on shift alone one day, but promised not to tell John. This coworker is trustworthy and is kind of a father figure/advice person for everyone else. I felt embarrassed and said I was already over John, and they didn't ask much else since they knew I was embarrassed. However, they did say they think that I only crushed on John because he's the only available option at the moment, and us being together wouldn't really work out because we'd both be super shy and awkward and stressed and would ""twiddle our thumbs"" and nothing would happen. I kind of agreed with this, but it still made me really sad because I feel like this guarantees that John could never like me, otherwise his friend would have said something else to me.

I have been trying to get over John but I don't know how. I still see him at least once a week at work and end up talking to him because I talk to my other coworkers. I know John seems interested in someone who is super beautiful, and intelligent, like another medical student, and more extroverted since he isn't, and I know I'm not that person. However, John is genuinely a nice person, very respectful, religious, and has good values, and is always very nice to me. I do feel that even if we weren't shipped together I probably would've developed a crush on him. I told my guy friend from work about what's been happening, who also knows my mental health struggles, and he told me John isn't the right guy for me, which I know is true, but my problem is I just want the validation of knowing John could like me. In my mind, I'm a failure because I'm 26 working an entry level job, not in medical school and don't know what to do next, and John is the type of guy I'd be interested in dating. The fact that John isn't interested makes me feel like no guy will ever like me, and I'm hopeless.

My friend said I should talk to other guys to try to get over John, but I'm scared of dating. I also only want to date for marriage, and not casually. I just hate myself as a person and don't find myself attractive, and I'm scared of rejection, and so want to avoid talking to anyone. I know this isn't true, as I've been told by people before that I'm attractive, but I know I should just be working on myself and my career right now. However, no matter how hard I try, I can't forget about John. I know that if I confess my feelings to John he will reject me but be nice about it, but then he will tell my coworker and it will also make things awkward between us in the future. How do I move forward and forget about John?

tl;dr: I 26F developed my first crush on John (27F), who is a former employee of my work, when everyone was shipping us together. I realized my crush on John is unhealthy, and I know John is not interested. How do I get over John?

I’m a FTM with a 15 week old girl. She is wonderful and I enjoy all the time we get to spend together while I’m in maternity leave but I have to say I feel like I have a completely different baby.

We are struggling with naps and going down to sleep which I’m expecting at this age. We try our best to keep the same routine. But between the hours of 5-7pm it’s like she is just upset at the world.

Throughout the day if someone looks at her and says anything, she breaks down and cries. Sometimes with my husband and rarely with me. Like her grandparents pick her up and she just starts crying (which she never did). One second she is happy and the next she isn’t. Some people she’s seen many times and others are strangers. I feel like any time we leave the house it’s just a struggle which wasn’t the case the past couple of months. She was so smiley and now it doesn’t seem that way.

Is this normal? Does anyone have advice on how to get through this stage? Do I just stay home with her while we get through this? Is this something she will grow out of?

1qzshr2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Strongerman/comments/1qzshr2/how_to_be_a_smooth_talker_with_women_the/,How to Be a Smooth Talker With Women The Psychology That Actually Works,"I spent two years deep diving into psychology books, research papers, and interviews with relationship experts because I kept fumbling conversations with women I found attractive. The pattern was embarrassing. I'd either word-vomit or go completely mute. Turns out this is insanely common, especially among guys in their 20s and 30s.

The real issue isn't that you're inherently bad at talking to women. Society conditions us to treat them like some exotic species requiring a secret code. Biology doesn't help either, your amygdala literally hijacks rational thinking when attraction kicks in. But here's the thing, once you understand the psychology behind communication and attraction, it becomes way more manageable.

**Stop overthinking the approach.** This sounds stupidly simple but it's backed by behavioral psychology research. Your brain magnifies potential rejection into this catastrophic event when realistically, most women appreciate genuine conversation. Dr. Aziz Gazipura's work on social confidence shows that 90% of approach anxiety exists purely in your head. The actual interaction is never as terrible as you imagine. Start small, make casual comments to women in everyday settings without any agenda. Coffee shops, bookstores, wherever. Just practice being normal around them. ""That book's incredible"" or ""This line is ridiculous"" works fine. You're building social momentum, not trying to get married.

**Ask questions that actually matter.** Most guys default to boring interview mode. Where are you from, what do you do, how's your weekend. Women get asked these same questions constantly. Instead, try questions that reveal personality. ""What's something you're weirdly passionate about?"" or ""What's the most impulsive thing you've done recently?"" This creates actual conversation instead of robotic exchanges. Research from Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert shows people feel more connected when discussing personal experiences versus surface level facts. When she answers, follow up with genuine curiosity. Don't just wait for your turn to talk about yourself.

**Stop performing, start connecting.** The biggest mistake is treating conversations like auditions where you're showcasing how funny, successful, or interesting you are. That's exhausting for everyone involved. Psychologist [Esther Perel](https://www.estherperel.com) talks about this in her podcast ""Where Should We Begin?"" She emphasizes that authentic vulnerability creates way more attraction than manufactured perfection. Share actual thoughts, admit when something makes you nervous, laugh at yourself. Women can smell try-hard energy from miles away. The goal isn't impressing her, it's seeing if you actually vibe together.

If you want a more structured way to build these skills without feeling overwhelmed, there's an app called [BeFreed ](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/learn-anything-befreed/id6739747450)that's been useful. It's a personalized learning platform built by Columbia alumni and AI experts from Google that pulls from psychology books, dating research, and expert interviews to create custom audio lessons.

You can set a specific goal like ""become more confident talking to women as an introvert"" and it builds an adaptive learning plan just for you, based on your personality and struggles. The depth is adjustable too, so you can do a quick 10-minute summary during your commute or a 40-minute deep dive with real examples when you want more detail. Plus you can customize the voice, some people swear by the smoky, conversational tone that makes it feel less like studying and more like advice from a friend. It covers all the books and research mentioned here, plus way more.

**Learn to read and respect signals.** This is crucial and too many guys ignore it completely. If she's giving short answers, checking her phone constantly, or physically angled away from you, she's not interested. Don't take it personally, just politely exit the conversation. On the flip side, if she's maintaining eye contact, asking you questions back, or finding excuses to extend the conversation, she's engaged. Social psychologist Vanessa Van Edwards breaks this down brilliantly in her book ""Captivate: The Science of Succeeding with People"". She explains micro-expressions and body language cues that indicate genuine interest versus politeness. Understanding these signals prevents you from being that guy who can't take a hint.

**Practice actual listening.** Not the kind where you're mentally preparing your next witty comment while she talks. Real listening where you absorb what she's saying and respond to it. This is backed by decades of communication research. Most people suck at this because they're too focused on themselves. Try this, when she finishes speaking, pause for literally two seconds before responding. It forces your brain to process what she actually said instead of auto-piloting to your pre-planned response. Women notice when you're genuinely paying attention versus performing interest.

**Embrace rejection as data, not judgment.** Every successful person in any field has faced massive rejection. Dating is no different. If a conversation doesn't go well, you're not fundamentally broken, you just weren't compatible with that specific person in that specific moment. Psychologist [Carol Dweck's](https://fs.blog/carol-dweck-mindset/) research on growth mindset applies here. She found that people who view setbacks as learning opportunities rather than personal failures achieve way more long term success. After a bad interaction, ask yourself what you could improve instead of spiraling into self-hatred. Maybe you dominated the conversation, maybe your energy was off, maybe she was having a terrible day and it had nothing to do with you.

The truth is most communication struggles stem from anxiety and social conditioning, not some inherent inability to connect with women. Once you stop treating every interaction like it determines your worth as a human, conversations become way easier. You're just two people talking. That's it. The more you practice without attaching massive expectations to outcomes, the more natural it becomes. Women are people dealing with their own insecurities and bullshit, they're not sitting there waiting to reject you. Most actually appreciate when guys approach them with genuine interest instead of cheesy pickup lines or fake confidence.

Start viewing conversations as experiments in human connection rather than tests you need to pass. Some will go great, some will crash and burn, all of them teach you something if you're paying attention.",1,1770605341.0,Strongerman,0,1.0,False

1qzshhm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qzshhm,"Corner space with windows, a TV, a couch, some kind of coffee table","Hiya! I have a 12'-by-11' (3.6m x 3.4m) corner space with some tall, narrow windows. I think I've made the space functional by putting a TV and media console centered between windows on one wall, an area rug, coffee table, and large-ish L-shaped sofa (seats 3-4). It works, kind of, but it's not very cozy. There's some tripping over the table and squeezing to get to the middle of the couch. There's also no nearby storage for random things, so they tend to accumulate on the table, couch, floor.

The couch and TV get a lot of use, and folks like to eat their lunches & snacks at the coffee table, sitting on the couch.

Recently the couch has been falling apart and I am hoping the entire space can be improved drastically if redone from scratch. I'll be getting new furniture anyway, so now is the time for drastic changes.

I’m trying to identify an old 2D pixel-art platformer for PC that I played around 2016, but the game itself is likely older.
Here is everything I clearly remember:
General:
2D side-scrolling jump’n’run
Very pixelated graphics, comparable to Sonic the Hedgehog (1991)
Neutral / serious tone (not humorous)
Not on Steam
Not a school project
Distributed directly by the developer (likely freeware or indie download)
Main character:
Wears red clothes
Wears a long, floppy red cap (zipfelmütze style)
Completely red
No white parts, no pom-pom
The cap does not move while walking or jumping
Has a white beard
Simple black pixel eyes
Full body visible
No weapons — enemies are defeated only by jumping on them
Enemies (very distinctive):
White electric kettles
They walk on the ground
They have no face
The lid opens while walking
Brown liquid (coffee) drips out while they move
Levels & gameplay:
Grass levels and industrial / factory levels
Some industrial levels are open, showing the blue sky during daytime
Floating platforms
Careful, precise jumping
Goal is simply to finish the level without dying
The game’s name might have started with “Mr.” or “Mister”, but I’m not 100% sure.
I’ve attached an image as a visual reference.
The original game was even more pixelated, but the enemies and character design are very close.

I only gained 13 lbs with my first pregnancy (20 the second time, as your body’s has stretched out before). My abdomen can fluctuate so much, being very flat to having about 2 inches of sub q fat that I can pinch. 

I have a very short abdomen and longer legs relative to my height (and I’m barely 5’4). I work out four times a week with weights/isometric workouts at Hotworx, with 1 45 min ISO workouts and a 15 min HIIT session every time, and about 10-15 min of free weights after.  I don’t have time to get to the gym so I usually go at night around 7-8pm.

1qzsdcq,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1qzsdcq/two_short_dating_situations_ended_abruptly/,"Two short dating situations ended abruptly, struggling to understand what I could’ve done differently","Hello, I’m a 24M in Chicago and have been back on the online dating scene for about 3 months. My previous relationship ended due to a major life change on my ex’s end, and we mutually decided to split. It was painful, but I took time to process it and felt ready to date again.

Since returning, my experience has been pretty standard for the apps as a M: plenty of matches that go nowhere, conversations that fizzle, interest from people I don’t feel compatible with, and not a lot of engagement. The latest theme is that I'm struggling to build momentum with people I’m genuinely interested in.

Recently, I had two short dating situations end in close succession that really caught me off guard, and I’m trying to understand whether there’s something I should be learning from them.

Situation 1 (“C”)

I matched with C 23F on Bumble and we had great chemistry over text — shared interests, easy conversation, mutual flirting. Our first date was about three hours at a restaurant near her place and it went really well. We talked about a lot (anime, college, life in the city, values, food, etc.). She seemed engaged and implied interest in a second date, which she later suggested herself (a farmer’s market and coffee shop).

We continued chatting throughout the week. While her texting slowed slightly, there wasn’t anything overtly negative. Then, the night before the planned second date, she sent the familiar message along the lines of: *“I had a great time, you’re sweet, but I see us more as friends.”*

It felt abrupt and unexpected, especially given how the date and follow-up conversations had gone. I asked for clarification, but she explained it as a general realization rather than anything specific I did. I accepted it, but it hit harder than I expected for a one-date situation, as I was crushing extremely hard and saw a ton of potential. Which is very uncharacteristic of me.

Situation 2 (“L”)

A couple of hours after that conversation concluded, I matched with L 23F. She had a more spontaneous, energetic personality and suggested meeting the next day. I agreed, partly as a distraction, but also because I was genuinely interested in getting to know her.

Our first date lasted about five hours (board game café + two restaurants) and went well. We stayed in touch throughout the week with good banter and planned a second date. I didn’t feel as immediately attached as I did with C, but I was enjoying getting to know her and saw potential.

The second date lasted a long time, about 12 hours total (bars, restaurants, then talking in my car). Toward the end of the night, she mentioned being tired. I thought we wrapped things up shortly after, but the next day she texted saying she didn’t think things would work out.

When I asked for clarification, she said she felt I prioritized my wants over hers when she expressed being tired. I apologized and acknowledged that I could’ve been more responsive in that moment. However, her responses afterward were brief and firm, and it was clear she didn’t want to continue.

Where I’m at now

Having two situations end unexpectedly within about a week has left me feeling confused and unsure how to navigate dating without constantly anticipating sudden endings, especially when dates seem to be going well.

I’m not trying to assign blame, and I understand no one owes anyone continued interest. I’m just struggling to understand: whether I’m missing early signals, whether long dates early on are a mistake, or whether this is just part of modern dating, and I need to recalibrate expectations.

I’d appreciate any outside perspective — especially from people who’ve experienced something similar or learned how to better protect their emotional energy while still dating intentionally.

Kaso sa tuwing umuuwi ako sa Pinas para magbakasyon, napapaisip ako kung tama ba yung magiging desisyon ko na mag retire dito sa Pinas. 

1. Traffic kahit saan ka man magpunta. Kahit sabihin mong may sarili kang driver at kotse, mapapagod at mapapagod ka sa haba ng oras mo na nakaupo sa traffic. 

Kailangan mo magdagdag ng extra hours kung may kailangan kang puntahan on time.

Sira sirang kalsada. Mawala lang ng ilang segundo mata mo sa daan, baka nasa pothole na yung isa mong gulong. 

kung by public transportation naman, LRT, bus, or jeep. Be prepared to add 2+hrs sa pila. 

2. Healthcare is absolute shithole. Privilege ang healthcare dito sa Pinas, hindi human rights.

Kung wala kang pera, you will be left to die on a bed outside the hospital. Nobody gives a f\* kahit naghihingalo ka na. Sabihin lang nila, transfer to a better hospital, kaso paano na kapag wala kang ipon?

Thankfully, capable naman na ako to bring my senior mother sa decent hospital for regular check ups. 

Nakakaawa lang yung mga taong walang ibang option kasi dito sa Pinas, no cash = no care. May philhealth nga, sobrang liit naman ng nadededuct sa total bill. 

3. Underpaid workers. Sobrang baba ng sahod. Mostly sa kakilala ko, tinatanggihan ako kapag niyayaya kong lumabas kumain/coffee to catch up.

""Wala pa kasi akong sahod eh""

Ang minimum wage sa Pilipinas ay halos 700 pesos kada araw. 

Coffee = 200 pesos. Resto like samgyupsal = 700 pesos.

Sa isang labas lang nila, ubos na agad yung tinrabaho nila buong araw, samantalang sa bansang tinitirahan ko, ilang minuto lang na trabaho yung 700 pesos. 

Kaya mas pinili ko nalang na iinvite sila sa bahay, kesa mag meet sa labas to catch up.

May nabasa akong post before somewhere sa facebook. Nasa jollibee si tatay at binibilang niya kung ilang araw nyang pagtatrabahuan sa construction yung isang bucket ng chicken joy para sa birthday ng anak niya. 

Heartbreaking reality but it shouldn't have to be this way.

4. Quality of air. Polusyon. Basura. Sanay naman ako sa ganitong environment, kaso simula nung nakapunta ako sa mga iba't ibang bansa, masasabi kong Pilipinas ang pinakamalala sa lahat. 

Kaya kung mag reretire ako at Pipiliin ko ang Pilipinas, sa probinsiya ako maninirahan, kaso baka by that time, polluted na ang buong Pilipinas. 

Hindi ko alam kung mahal ko ba talaga ang Pilipinas, o hinahatak lang ako pabalik ng Pinas para makasama ang mga taong malapit sa akin. ",53,1770604551.0,phmigrate,25,0.78,False

Books, podcasts, psychology papers, you name it. Started because I kept seeing friends (and honestly, myself) stay in situations that felt ""off"" but couldn't explain why. The rabbit hole went deep.

Turns out most of us have no idea what healthy actually looks like. We mistake intensity for intimacy, jealousy for love, codependency for commitment. Society feeds us this narrative through rom coms and love songs that relationships should be dramatic, all consuming, worth sacrificing yourself for. That's bullshit. Science says otherwise.

Here's what actually matters, backed by researchers who've studied thousands of couples:

**1. You can be bored together without it feeling like a problem**

Dr. John Gottman (studied 3,000+ couples over 40 years, basically the relationship research god) found that successful couples don't need constant excitement. They're cool just existing in the same space doing nothing special. You're scrolling your phone, they're reading, nobody's panicking that the spark is dying. Comfortable silence is underrated as hell.

**2. Conflict doesn't terrify you**

Healthy couples argue. They just do it differently. Instead of attacking character (""you're so selfish""), they address specific behaviors (""when you didn't text me back for 8 hours, I felt worried""). Gottman calls the toxic patterns the Four Horsemen: criticism, contempt, defensiveness, stonewalling. If those show up regularly, that's your sign.

The book ""Hold Me Tight"" by Dr. Sue Johnson changed how I see arguments entirely. She created Emotionally Focused Therapy after studying attachment science, won a bunch of awards for it. The core idea is most fights aren't about dishes or money, they're about ""are you there for me?"" Sounds simple but it's insanely good. Best relationship book I've read, hands down. Makes you realize that fighting about the thermostat is never actually about the thermostat.

**3. You don't need permission to have your own life**

Red flag city when someone needs to know where you are every second, gets weird about you seeing friends, makes you feel guilty for having hobbies they're not part of. Esther Perel (therapist, wrote ""Mating in Captivity"", super famous in couples therapy world) talks about how desire needs space. You can't want someone who's merged into you completely. Mystery and separateness aren't threats to intimacy, they fuel it.

**4. Your nervous system calms down around them**

This one's biological. Dr. Stephen Porges researched something called polyvagal theory, basically how our nervous system detects safety. When you're with the right person, your body literally relaxes. Heart rate slows, breathing deepens, you're not in low key fight or flight mode. If you're constantly anxious, walking on eggshells, monitoring their mood, your body is trying to tell you something.

**5. You can share good news without them making it weird**

Psychologist Shelly Gable studied something called ""active constructive responding"". Basically how partners react to good news matters more than how they handle bad news. Healthy response: genuine excitement, asking questions, celebrating with you. Toxic responses: dismissive (""that's nice"" then changing subject), competing (""oh yeah well I just...""), or pointing out negatives (""but doesn't that mean more hours?"").

**6. They're interested in growing, not just being right**

Nobody's perfect, we all fuck up. Difference is whether someone can actually hear feedback without having a meltdown or flipping it back on you. Therapist Harriet Lerner wrote ""[Why Won't You Apologize?](https://books.google.co.in/books/about/Why_Won_t_You_Apologize.html?id=ruOxDwAAQBAJ&redir_esc=y)"" and it's eye opening. Real apologies don't include ""but"" or excuses. People who can genuinely apologize and change behavior are rare and valuable.

If you want to go deeper on relationship psychology without reading another 300-page book, there's an app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that's been pretty solid. It pulls from relationship experts like Gottman, Perel, and Sue Johnson, plus research papers and real relationship case studies, and turns them into personalized audio content. You can set specific goals like ""communicate better during conflict"" or ""build secure attachment as an anxious person,"" and it creates a learning plan tailored to your situation.

The depth control is clutch, you can do a 10-minute overview or switch to a 40-minute deep dive with examples when something really clicks. The voice options are surprisingly addictive, I usually go with the calm, thoughtful narrator for relationship stuff. Makes the commute actually useful instead of just doomscrolling relationship Reddit.

**7. Your relationship doesn't require you to shrink yourself**

You're not constantly editing your personality, dimming your success, hiding parts of yourself to keep peace. Brené Brown researched shame and vulnerability for decades at University of Houston. One finding that stuck with me: we can only love others as much as we love ourselves, and being with someone who requires you to be less than you are kills that self love slowly.

**8. Sex feels connected, not just physical**

Emily Nagoski wrote ""[Come As You Are](https://www.amazon.in/Come-You-Are-Emily-Nagoski/dp/B004EIMM6Y)"" (won a bunch of sex education awards, based on legit sexology research). She breaks down how responsive desire works, how context matters more than libido. In healthy relationships, sex isn't just tension release or obligation. It's a place where vulnerability is safe and pleasure is mutual. You can talk about what you want without shame. Frequency matters way less than quality and connection.

**9. You trust them with your weirdness**

The relationship app Paired actually has good research based content on intimacy building (they worked with relationship psychologists). One exercise is sharing embarrassing stories, secret fears, weird habits. Intimacy is built through progressive vulnerability. If you're hiding your authentic self years in, something's wrong.

**10. They remember what matters to you**

Not talking grand gestures. It's remembering your coffee order, that you have a big meeting Tuesday, that you hate mushrooms, that your sister's going through something. Dr. Gary Chapman's love languages research gets memed to death but the underlying point is solid: attention to detail shows you're living in someone's mind, not just their schedule.

**11. Future talk doesn't trigger panic**

Healthy relationships move toward something. Doesn't mean marriage timeline by date three, but there's organic progression. You're not stuck in eternal ""just seeing where this goes"" limbo years in. Psychologist Ty Tashiro wrote ""[The Science of Happily Ever After](https://books.google.co.in/books/about/The_Science_of_Happily_Ever_After.html?id=QUbHAgAAQBAJ&redir_esc=y)"" analyzing what predicts relationship success. Biggest factor isn't passion, it's having compatible life visions and the willingness to build toward them.

**12. Breaking up would suck but wouldn't destroy you**

Sounds backwards but hear me out. Interdependence is healthy, codependence isn't. The difference is whether you've maintained your individual identity, support system, sense of self worth. If the thought of being single again feels like actual death, that's not love, that's addiction. Real love enhances your life, it doesn't become your entire life.

Look, relationships are complex. This isn't a checklist where you need 10/12 to pass. But if you're reading this and realizing you've normalized things that are actually harmful, your gut already knows. We accept the love we think we deserve, and that's not some poetic bullshit, it's psychology. You deserve someone who makes your life bigger, not smaller.

The research is clear: healthy relationships exist. They're not perfect, they're not effortless, but they shouldn't be suffering either. If it feels constantly hard, if you're always anxious, if you're changing yourself to fit their expectations, that's data worth listening to.",1,1770604413.0,MenInModernDating,0,1.0,False

1qzs3xw,https://www.reddit.com/r/roommateproblems/comments/1qzs3xw/roommates_like_to_throw_parties_a_lot/,Roommates like to throw parties a lot,"PLEASE HELP, TDLR at end 

My (28F) living situation isnt the best, I dont have the means to move right now. Its a couple upstairs in the house and I live downstairs. I moved in 8 months ago, they moved in a year ago. (30F and 32M) none of us have kids.

I'm usually out of the house 8-12 hours a day, including the weekends. They work from home so they're home 90% of the time. When I'm home I like it to be quiet. My  roommates are pretty rowdy. Obviously I'm not expecting silence by any means. But theyre pretty loud. They love to blast music and sceam and yell and have the tv super loud and have parties and people over and drink and stuff. I've tried to communicate with them, they'll quiet down for a few days and then just go back to doing whatever they want. I never have people over because of this reason, theyre extremely unpredictable. Sometimes theyre super quiet randomly and I dont even know theyre home. Id say its like 65% of the time (that I'm home at least) theyre pretty loud. so its not TERRIBLE, but also not ideal.

I tried to have a good relationship with them at the beginning. Ideally I wanted our relationship to be like ""oh hey we're going to have a party this weekend just so you know"", or ""we're going to be out of town for 2 weeks, or the weekend or whatever"". I tried telling them things like this and they always looked at me sideways, like they couldnt understand why they or I'd want to know this information. They would only tell me what they were doing if I asked or if I told them what I was doing first. I stopped asking because it felt like they thought I was violating their privacy almost.

So since its so unpredictable, sometimes I'll come home and want to just chill after a long day and then 30 minutes later they have people over or start playing the tv really loud or something.

Me communicating with them isnt really an option at this point. Ive tried communicating with them so much that they dont like me anymore. I tried to be nice but it just didnt work.

MY QUESTION IS: What do you guys do in this situation? right now theyre having people over for the superbowl. I dont want to be there during it. I kinda feel like I'm semi homeless. I go to the gym a lot, I feel weird going twice a day. Do you guys go to the library or a rec center maybe? or a coffee shop? I dont want make me inviting myself over to a loved ones home a regular thing, so thats not really an option. I just need ideas for what to do when youre exhausted but dont want to go home. a lot of times I'll just sit in my car for a few hours but then I actually feel homeless and dont want to scare people.😂 I dont know. Any advice is great. Thanks for reading.

TLDR: My roommates love to party, I like to be more quiet at home. Moving isnt an option right now. Where can I go (besides sitting in my car or a loved ones home) to just chill? I dont want to spend a bunch of money. I'm kinda semi homeless and I dont want to act homeless. I've tried to communicate and zero change. Need help. ",1,1770604244.0,roommateproblems,0,0.99,False

Assalamualaikum. I recently joined this reddit community and have been snooping around. Just been seeing a whole lot of stuff that has me like ""...wha"" 

Straight up 

I see people making the worst and genuinely untruthful assumptions about local houses. 

I also see them not recognizing the patterns, and some absolutely certain negative aspects of some of these local houses. 

So if you're reading this you're probably interested at this point. Here's my 2 cents. 

First off, my name's Rafaay. I'm 19, I've been collecting for 7 years, and here's my ""resume"" 

I've been reviewing fragrances on my small YouTube channel since last Ramadan 

I've been a member of large Pakistan Facebook groups since 2024, ones dedicated to og's from niche/designer/arab houses and ones designated to our local ones

and through these groups and my reviews I've met with and personally know/have friendships with many local house owners, Fareed Bhai of Abu Haashir, Hasan Bhai of Peirama, Bilal and Ovais bhai of Enchanté, Omar Bhai of Scent in a bottle, Osama Bhai from Balsamico, Uzair and Junaid Bhai of Rawaha, Ali Bhai from Mahdi perfumes, Ovais Bhai from Gaia Parfums, and MANY others alhamdulillah. 

These are the people whom I often spend my weekends with as the little brother, just soaking up everything they say. 

I've also had my own try of running a local house, which seriously taught me a lot. 

So this is going to be in a very random order cuz I am pretty much ranting. Also some people are definitely not gonna like the amount of truth bombs I will drop here. 

YOUR FAVORITE FRAGRANCES FROM GLOBAL BRANDS ARE INSANELY EASILY ACCESSIBLE. 

The global industry of perfume manufacturing is insane. Tens maybe even Hundreds of Billions of dollars flow in this industry. Almost all the beloved giant designer and niche houses work with fragrance manufacturing companies, there is no longer such a thing as ""in house manufacturing"" unless it's a small indie brand. 

All these companies hire perfumers, they take what the brands want, create templates, and they finalize and choose which one they want from the perfumers selection. then he builds the fragrance.

The big companies manufacture it. THEN. THEY LIST IT UP FOR SALE. THEMSELVES. SEPERATELY. Not openly of course, you need industry contacts. 

There are also methods such as GCMS (Gas Chromatography Analysis) where you input a sample of the fragrance and it gives u step by step the ingredients used. There are caveats tho, if natural ingredients are used they don't get detected, but with the expertise of a perfumer worth his salt, you can identify and rebuild it, and honestly, they get ridiculously close. 

Some of your local brands reach out to the EXACT same manufacturers and can literally get the SAME oil the big brands do. The difference is how much our local brands are willing to spend, here come in, 

FRAGRANCE OIL TIERS 

Based on the quality of the ingredients used, these companies or other manufacturers have different grades of oil, from B, BB, BBB, A, AA and AAA. It's not really measured like this in some sort of industry standard way, bas aap log ko samjhane ke liye asaani hei. 

AAA is either literally the same from the original manufacturer, or as close as you can possibly get. These differ in price, B starts below or at the ten thousands, and AAA gets to multiple lakh rupees in SOME instances, it's not like this for all of them though. 

If someone is selling 100 ml Dior Sauvage on Instagram ads for 800 rupees, well what do you expect? it's gonna be a synthetic bottle of liquid shit. 

Rawaha on their high tier articles(price 8k and above) are all that AAA grade. 

Now my favourite one that pisses me off and that I love to bash 

CONCENTRATION DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING. 

Simply put, isse zyada asaan bol bhee nahi sakta. 

If a brand has 40% concentration, they're compensating for the low quality. a good quality oil doesn't need a high level. 

Go experiment urself. itna time hei agar(mere paas thaa) Go get Creed Aventus ke oils, aik confirmed B Grade waala aur aik AAA grade. 

In every aspect, profile, smoothness and performance, the AAA grade at 20% will COMPLETELY outshine the B grade at 40%. 

However, some local brands, and later even international brands, started and continue to do these EXTRAIT DE PARFUM's because they know this new gen of buyers wants that BEAST MODE 24 HOUR THICK AND DENSE CHOKE PEOPLE OUT shit, so they amp it up cuz of changing tastes and preferences for overall thicker and denser perfumes. 

Go to France wearing ur 40% Killian's angel share from Rawaha compared to their og which is low/sub 20% and they'll think u did 50 sprays. 

Hell it's not ur fault the air quality in this country is shit, and now at this point you guys can probably barely smell something with that 20% since ur noses are so used to extrait perfumes. 

It's also marketing bullshit. idk who started the high concentration perfume thing I wanna slap him genuinely. 

Higher concentration also projects less and sits closer to ur skin. It's simple, the oil weighs down on you more cuz of the added volume and can't lift up into the air. 

also saw this thing that ""local houses add dpg to their oils"" over here? like, bro? no? no one's doing that Bhai 😭 that's some shit from 2019 lol. 

Now one that hurts a little given my own efforts. 

THERE'S TOO MANY LOCAL HOUSES. 

Seriously. too many. thousands. I doubt France itself has this many of their own brands jitne hamare Hein. 

They all sell the same thing, 90% of them are quite frankly just bad and done with minimal effort, and the industry is COMPETITIVE AS F\*\*\*. Bhai if you're currently a player since the last 2 years and you're doing well, you'll last. You're safe, you'll do good. 

But if you're thinking of entering now? DONT. Unless you have an amazing USP, good design, good packaging, hella investment, or are doing original creations, don't bro. it's not worth it. 

I'm still currently running my brand and it's tough. it's hard to provide and compete with the rest of the market at the level I'm currently at. 

Duaon mei yaad rakho laiken. 

Last thing that I see affecting 90% of all fragrance enthusiasts from the original buyers

SUPERIORITY COMPLEX 

I've basically run down why it's dumb to think the RIGHT local houses literally aren't just making your kror rupees ki collection look stupid.  You got money man you do you lo originals, hell mujhe bhee chahiye. But the shit I can find in the local houses I trust, I'm getting it. Cuz 999/1000 times, Mera paisa wasool ho Raha hei, mujhe wohi cheez milegi cuz let's be real aapme se 0.1% log honge jinko nose ki training hei or notes ki identification hei ke aap bolo ""nahi isme ye farq hei"" when it comes to something that is like 90% close I'm only getting something from OG's that they just don't have, or some indie artisanal niche stuff, which I will make a completely separate post about cuz that's where the REAL perfumery is still alive. 

Also originals Lena hee aik alag scene hei. aapko pata hei Hermes ko Kitne paise lagte Hein to make one bottle of H24(because this is the only example I can think of)? 50 cents. Think about that. 

One more thing 

WHY SOME FRAGRANCES CAN JUST NEVER BE MATCHED. 

Now, here's the one thing that the bigger international brands can keep for themselves, 

CAPTIVE INGREDIENTS 

these ingredients are exclusive to either the company they manufacture with(for which you need some sort of license to access?) or the brand themselves

Some of these ingredients can most prominently be displayed with the LV fragrances.

 LVMH has exclusive captive ingredients with their manufacturer(mostly synthetic based ingredients that are constructed in house in their labs)

In every LV impression fragrance you smell, if you can compare with the original, something's just different. you can't tell what. but it's not quite it. 

you cant even identify it cuz most of the times these ingredients are kept secret, and only show up on GC Machines(I think) or wo bhee Chalo agar aapne dekh liya bhai aap usko access tou nahi karpaoge.

Plus it's so many other brands too not just Louis Vuitton. 

LAST THING 

FRAGRANCE IS AN A R T. 

As someone that respects, loves and appreciates this art, and yes I'm a hoarder, yes I try and buy everything, but ye hamare nabi S.A.W ki aik sunnat ka hissa hei. 

The 3 things he loves most in the world, being deep in Salah, Women, and perfume. Tou please, namaz parhein, apni Amma/biwi/bhen ko kabhi Pyaar Kiya karein, aur uss jazbeh ke Saath perfume ko istimal karein ke ye Aapki rooh aur jism ki aik dawai hei. Ik I sound like a crazy obsessed paagal idiot, but when you explore the realm of fragrance I have, it's truly crazy. True works of art, natural ouds and other natural fragrances. Try it all. Experience it all. A small suggestion from someone that loves these little things that most people just deem ""accessories"" 

Ok I'm done. p.s not all info here is 100% accurate, but in all fairness I'd say I'm 90% there. ",2,1770603672.0,pakfragaddicts,4,0.67,False

Most apps were just swiping, matching, and hoping someone would actually reply. Every conversation I tried seemed to die instantly, and it got me thinking: maybe the problem isn’t the people — maybe it’s the app.

So one night, fueled by coffee and stubbornness, I started tinkering. I wanted small features that actually make talking fun: little games, quirky questions, 1-on-1 rooms. Things that give people a reason to actually say something beyond “hey.”

There were so many messy nights — bugs, crashes, moments where I seriously questioned if anyone would care. But then a friend-testing it laughed at a silly question, started a conversation that actually lasted, and I realized… this might actually work. That tiny moment made all the late nights worth it.

AfterMatch isn’t perfect, and it probably never will be. But building it reminded me why I love making apps: not for hype or downloads, but for those little human connections that wouldn’t exist otherwise.",1,1770603610.0,AppsWebappsFullstack,2,1.0,False
