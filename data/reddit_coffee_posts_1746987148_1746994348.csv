1kka2m4,https://www.reddit.com/r/mrcreeps/comments/1kka2m4/we_went_to_sabotage_a_fox_hunt_they_werent/,We went to sabotage a fox hunt. They weren’t hunting foxes… Part 2,"The morning broke not with the sun, but with a pale light pushing through a heavy veil of mist. Dew clung to the hedgerows of spindle and hawthorn like sweat on fevered skin, and the ash trees stood as grey silhouettes-sentinels in mourning. There I stood at the edge of the kitchen garden, cradling a mug of black coffee, watching a pair of jackdaws peck at the remnants of seeds scattered on the path.


In the distance, an old woman moved through the fog towards the woodland. Others joined her quietly, emerging like ghosts on the moor- men and women placing small offerings at the wood’s edge. A freshly shot wood pigeon,  feathers still damp with blood, a brace of rabbits, a wedge of cheddar cheese, strawberries and a wicker basket of pink lady apples. One man laid what appeared to be a wooden carving of a fox, weather-worn but clearly treasured.

At that moment I felt it- the land holding its breath.

“They’re leaving offerings…” 

It was James, having gotten up earlier to work on the farm before everyone else. “For the Redling no doubt”.

“Why are they feeding him?” I whispered.

“Because some think he’s still a boy. Others think he’s a god. And maybe they’re both right,” James answered.

That afternoon, the group fanned out for recon. We took turns watching the hunting lodge in the beech hanger above the village. Hidden behind gorse and brambles, Sophie and I lay flat in the grass, binoculars on the sprawling estate. There over several yards we got the picture of what we were dealing with… 

Hunting lords and their sycophants, a a string quartet playing “Waltz of the Flowers”,  champagne flutes in one hand, riding crops in the other. A bonfire crackled on in the centre of the fete champetre as servants wondered, offering hors d’oeuvre. The fact these people were enjoying themselves at this meet, likely anticipating the idea of a human child being torn to shreds for some twisted ritual sicken me to the stomach. Then came the hour of the man itself. The devil in velvet hunting coat, lifting his drink as the fire crackled 

Lord Robert Darrow, a slender man in his seventies with silver hair, a thin, hawk like nose and a haughty tone. The type you often seen in  some snobby elite club.

“To the Old Ways!” He cried. “To dominion! To the Wyrd that bends the wood and blood!”.

The crowd cheered. Snippets of conversation followed- coded, careful:

“…he’s ready now. Been seen by standing stones…”

“…another year, another offering…”

“…same line. Always the same methods…”

Back at the farmhouse. Sophie paced furiously 

“This isn’t hunting. This is a fucking cult- they really going to sacrifice a child for some folkloric bullcrap”.

Nick was busy tinkering with one of his radios while Tom was researching hacked documents. Me, I was watching out the window… I swore the Redling was out there watching me in return. He knows we talking about him.

Sophie slammed her fist onto the table, her voice now crackling with frustation. “Why hasn’t the village done anything to stop this? How can you all let this happen? Your own child is going to die… and for what? Some folkloric bullshit?”

James slowly looked up. “Because they think we’re nothing.”

He rose, leading to the mantle. “To those bastards, we’re filth. Bumpkins. ‘Can’t tell a hedgehog from a hair brush.’ That’s what Darrow call us once. And we believed it. Or at last, we were scared enough to act like we did.’

Silence.

“I know my son’s out there,” James said softly. “Michael probably doesn’t remember who he is… doesn’t who he’s father is. Just waiting for this brutes and those mangy mutts to tear him to pieces like fucking Christmas wrapping paper. And one one will do nothing about it..”

James takes a deep breath “That’s why you lot are here… to help me put a stop into this madness… I don’t give a shit at this point if I get killed… or magical nature spirit gets pissed at us for not giving it what it wants… this needs to end.”

Nick finally spoke up “Then don’t call the police for help.. or even contact the neighbouring counties.”

James scoffed “Yeah Brillant mate.. ‘Hello Police.. I like to report a fox hunting cult kidnapping kids and sacrificing to a pagan god‘… who’s going to believe us?.”

Joe picked something plushy from the mantelpiece… a soft fox plush… a bit tattered from old age but holding its endearing charm. “I don’t care if I lose a thousand lambs to the foxes… I don’t care I lose the farm or get hung for treason by village… I just want my son back.

He stared into the glassy eyes of the stuffed animal… and I swore I could a stray tear…
“This bloody little thing… this was Micheal’s favourite toy… he called it Tod… ironic honestly… I hated foxes… yet he adored them.. they were his favourite animal”.

The next day was full of small unease: shrines found along the treeline, bones and woven brambles, a trail camera of Tom knocked over and snapped in half. “Those toffee nosed bastards..” Tom murmured in frustration.

We discovered a hidden clearing behind a blackberry thicket, where villagers have formed a crude circle of dried flowers, candles and charred wood in the center.

Nick had a good idea what it meant.

The following night, we watched the hunting lodge again. The party grew more rowdy.
Music drifted over the fields, distorted by wind and fog. I caught Lord Darrow in my view once again standing by the fire, now with a grotesque pelt of a victim of his fox hunts draped over his shoulders.

He spoke again to his followers.

“In two days will the child of beasts of prey run. 
The land will be reminded who holds the whip. And once again Mother Nature will kneel to her masters!”

We listened to the rhythm of the woodland as we sat on the porch… planning our move on the hunt.

James joined with Tod cradled in his arms like a newborn baby “We need to act first” James sat directly. “This isn’t just Micheal or bloody foxes anymore… but many children to come before us”.

The autumn fog thickened like porridge, curling around the farmhouse like smoke.

I couldn’t sleep that night. I came to this village to help put an end to fox hunting… only to dragged into a conspiracy.

Once I finally succumbed to fatigue- I dreamt. I dreamt of running through the eaves and undebrush with roots like bare knotted fists. Behind me a pack of hellish dogs with red eyes and frothing maws snapping at my heels. Ahead: the Redling at the edge of the woods, staring at me with bright amber eyes and whisper “Would you bleed to stop them?’

I snapped out of my nightmare… only to see a fox staring out of my window. Once it noticed I was awake the beast trotted back into the thickets. What does this all mean?

1kka09q,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritersGroup/comments/1kka09q/i_hope_you_found_the_water/,I Hope You Found the Water,"***Dean***

***Present Day***

The air in the garage had gone stale days ago. Or hours. It was hard to tell anymore. Time didn’t flow here, it curdled. There was blood on the concrete again. His blood, mostly dried now, flaking when he shifted. A low hum vibrated from somewhere in the walls. A fuse box? A fridge? Maybe his own body buzzing, waiting for the final act.

Dean sat slumped against the wall, wrists raw from the ropes they’d stopped bothering to retighten. His body had long since stopped resisting. His mind, though, his mind was sharp. Clearer than it had ever been.

“I used to think a confession was something you earned,” he said aloud, the sound thin in the dark. “Like if you hurt bad enough… or bled long enough, someone out there would let you explain.”

His voice didn’t echo. The garage swallowed it whole.

“But no one’s coming. Not really.”

He wasn’t sure who he was talking to. Maybe Maya, if she ever found this place. Maybe his father. Or maybe just himself, the version of him that still thought prayers meant something.

He let his head tilt back against the wood paneling. The scent of motor oil lingered, like a ghost from his childhood. His dad had always smelled faintly like that. Oil, sawdust, and that damn hand wash.

“That place was my sanctuary,” Dean murmured. “Dad made it that way. Scripture verses taped to the rafters… tools lined like soldiers… coffee cans full of shit we’d never use but couldn’t throw away.”

He could still see Owen hunched over his workbench, sanding something slowly, deliberately. *“The world needs order, Dean. Even in chaos, build something.”* That voice echoed louder than his own.

“Funny how I’ve torn down more than I ever built.” His lip cracked as he smiled ironically.

His fingers brushed against the floor beside him, where the cement met a line of faded masking tape. He remembered a time that, as a boy, he’d helped Owen mark off tool zones like it was sacred geometry. He’d been so proud. So eager to learn.

He closed his eyes and saw the reservoir again.

Caleb standing shirtless at the edge of the rocks, grinning like they were invincible. “Come on, man. Don’t be a coward.” Dean had stood frozen, the summer heat blistering his skin, terrified of what waited beneath the surface.

“I keep going back to that day,” Dean said softly. “Caleb just… jumped. Like nothing could touch him.” His eyes opened, glazed with memory. “I wasn’t afraid of the fall. I was afraid of the change. Of who I’d be after.” And Ethan had known that. Had looked into Dean like he was a cracked window and slipped right through.

“Ethan saw a boy aching to be remade and gave him a purpose that felt holy.” Dean let the silence stretch.

“But it wasn’t.” His throat tightened, but he didn’t cry. Not anymore. “*‘They’ll call it faith if you do it with your eyes closed,’* Dad said once. I thought he was being poetic. Turns out he was warning me.” The breath he released was shaky, but light.

“I wanted to belong so badly… I handed Ethan the matchbook and asked which one to light.” He looked down at his hands, how callused those knuckles were. All the broken skin and scars. The tools of a zealot.

“I thought if I obeyed enough, fought enough, bled enough, I’d earn love. God’s. Ethan’s. My father’s.” He laughed, low and bitter. “I spent years mistaking quiet violence for devotion. Righteousness for control. And I let them make me a blade.” His voice cracked at the last word.

“But I know better now.” He shifted, one leg stretched out, the other bent at the knee. Blood had dried around his sock line. “I used to beg. For mercy. For Maya. For something holy to interrupt all of this. But tonight?” He sat straighter and leaned into it.

“No more.”

A breeze slipped in through the crack beneath the garage door. It carried dust and the smell of night rain.

“Because I’ve remembered who I was before all this. Before Ethan. Before I put on the black suit and called it armor.” His voice softened. “I’ve remembered how even saints bleed.”

“I was just a kid who wanted to keep his dad proud. Who believed in something bigger. Who believed people were mostly good… because that’s what *Owen* taught me.” He touched his chest like, maybe, his father was still there somehow.

“*‘We’re all just trying to do better than we did yesterday.’* That’s what he said. *‘That’s all the Lord really asks.’*” Dean smiled for real this time. It wasn’t uncomfortable, yet it felt true.

“I can believe that again. I can believe that the younger version of me, who was scared, eager, and blind, wasn’t evil. Just desperate.” He paused, ready to drop the weight he’d picked up years ago. The one he’d accepted in his father’s garage years ago.

“And I can forgive him.”

It came out as a breath, but rushed out like the wind.

“Not because he earned it… I don’t want to carry him in shame anymore. That version of me… he brought me here. And here’s where I finally saw it all.” His hand rested with steadiness now.

“The whole crooked empire. The men behind the curtains. The bloodstained pulpits.”

He looked toward the ceiling, picturing where Owen had once hung a model airplane. It was long gone now. Dean’s breath came quickly and raspy as he spoke.

“I don’t regret the fire, everything needed to burn. I only regret I had taken so long to light it.”

He thought of Caleb. Of the way they used to pass notes in seminary, draw swords on napkins, and laugh in the quiet way boys do, carefully, with reverence they didn’t believe in but couldn’t break.

“I wish I could tell Caleb I’m sorry,” he said. “That I miss the boy who snuck Oreos into fast and testimony meetings. That I hope he’s okay, wherever he is.” He let his eyes close again. This time, he pictured Maya.

“And I wish Maya had never followed me into this mess. But part of me is glad she did. Because she saw me, not the bruised fists or the church-boy grin. Me.” The quiet returned. It stayed for a long time. Like even time was waiting with him. Then, in what could have been seconds or an eon, he heard a breath of motion. A step. Dean didn’t flinch.

“Dad,” he whispered, “I hope you know I heard you, even when I pretended not to. I hope you’re waiting somewhere warm. Somewhere quiet. I hope you followed the water.”

The doorknob twisted. Dean didn’t move, his eyes stayed on the floor. The hinges groaned open. A shaft of blinding light split the room. He didn’t shield his eyes or look up to the newcomer.

He just said, steady and calm:

“Took you long enough.”

Last Jan. My mom was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer stage 4 (no metastasis). I was abroad- very far away (living and working since 7 months there). It was so stressful to hear about the situation + the fear of this cancer that I spoke to my colleagues and made the decision to go back to my country. I had no idea how things would go with her and we knew it was something really bad and serious and staying abroad at that time was really difficult. It's been almost 3 months now. The chemo helped and the tumor is less big which gives hope but I don't now how it will be in the next few months......I feel terrible because I left my place, I did remote work but it stopped as it couldn't last this way and I live in the family house with my mom and a brother with who I am not close at all (we say hi to each other in the house when we cross each other that's pretty much it) and I've been feeling really bad, like not having my own place anymore, havig to think about what to do and where to work next + the situation with my mom and the lack of love @ home makes it really difficult (I wake up in the middle of the night each night and often feel a tension in my belly in this house where I only feel ok during night time in my room alone or sometimes when I am alone with my mom sharing coffee).

Like many disabled people, I have had a difficult relationship with my parents. The details aren't really important, but my father was so self-involved that he often did things that harmed me without meaning to (and then sighed about never doing anything right). He was never present at any medical appts or surgeries. My mom got off on being super mom when I was at medical appts or was in the hospital, and all 'tough love'/negligence when I was home. 

I cut them out of my life about a decade ago and slowed the medical crap down to a crawl. I just had my first surgery since, and wow, it's like my medical anxiety just evaporated. Yes, I did have an Ativan just before the procedure, but I used to feel a deep panic days before surgery. I would be tired and worn out for days after, and I would never feel rested when I went back to school/work/life. But four days post-op, I feel good. The only reason I'm not leaving my house to grab a coffee is cause I can't shower yet, so I'm stinky. This surgery was similar to the ones I've always had, a bit less extensive maybe. 

Has anyone else experienced anything like this? It's really making me rethink my relationship to disability. ",1,1746993830.0,disability,1,1.0,False

Would you look at that? We actually made it to **20,000 members!** I mean, who would’ve thought that sharing drama on the internet could spiral into a thriving community? Turns out, when you mix chaos with good intentions, you accidentally create something awesome. Or just... loud. One of the two.

Honestly, this place started as a little project—a handful of people sharing some drama, making a few jokes, and probably creating mild confusion along the way. Now? We’ve got a full-blown, thriving circus 🎪. Sometimes it felt like herding cats, but hey, that’s just the price of being this dramatic.

**So, what’s next?** Well, since quitting is not an option (seriously, you guys would notice), we’re leveling up. Expect better content, more creativity, and, of course, more drama. We’re also keeping an eye out for new faces who vibe with our chaotic energy—whether they’re members, content creators, or even future mods. We’ll be looking for people who understand that moderating here is like trying to catch a tornado with a butterfly net—ambitious but mostly chaotic.

**Speaking of mods...** Let’s give a shoutout to our brave mod squad—the ones who spend their time sorting out drama from actual chaos, and probably drinking more caffeine than is medically advisable ☕:

* u/issabellamoonblossom
* u/Silver-Bus5724
* u/wuiramlee
* u/thehepburn
* u/emberzmars
* u/Background_Drama_973

These folks keep the community from exploding into pure anarchy. They’ve mastered the art of calming heated debates, hunting down spammers, and trying to figure out if “F” means “following” or just “F for the post.” *Props to you guys for being both the firefighters and the party planners 🎉 of this wild ride.*

And let’s not forget our top contributors—those who earned the **diamond-level flair** 💎 for being consistently awesome and helping keep the place alive:

* u/slumberdollxxi
* u/Illegaldesi
* u/hope1nmyself
* u/Salt_Math9859
* u/Yoori_Lee

If we listed everyone who’s been awesome, we’d be here all week—so we’re sticking to the diamonds for now. (*Seriously, thanks to all of you. You make this community better and way more entertaining.*)

And to everyone who shares, reacts, complains (we see you), and keeps the conversation alive—thank you. You’re the heartbeat of this beautiful mess, and the reason we drink way too much coffee.

We’re just getting started. More chaos, more fun, and definitely more drama are on the way. Here’s to the next **20k**—and whatever nonsense comes next. Cheers! 🍻

1kk9whu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1kk9whu/is_he_gay/,Is he gay?,"Hi,

I feel confused, sad, and somewhat lost. I’ve developed feelings for a close friend, who I’ll call Jake, but I’m not sure how he sees me or our friendship. Sometimes I get the feeling he might share similar feelings towards me, but I’m not certain because he acts in ways that confuse me. I often think about some situations that have made me doubt.

For example, **he once said ""good night, love""** in a message after I congratulated him on his birthday, and I don’t understand why he used that word when we’re not in that type of relationship. Also, he often calls me “love,” even though he tells me it’s because his father also calls some of his friends love but **he doesn’t call anyone else in our group “love,” only me.** Another thing is when we once went for coffee just the two of us, without our other friend, and it was really wonderful. We never told our friend that we went without him. A bit of a confession but I schemed the whole thing of forgetting to invite our friend because ""I thought Jake did it"". Also would like to clarify that love in my language is not the same as in British English and it is a word you only use for somebody you love like your wife or husband.

I also think about a time when he ***jokingly*** said that he might be gay, and how he acted about it. **All of these situations have caused a lot of confusion and uncertainty** about what he really thinks and feels about me.

Also, I remember him saying that every time he tried being in a relationship with a girl, it went badly because he’d “cool off” after the first date. This made me think, “Well, maybe he’s actually gay, like me.” He’s also **kissed a few girls**, which again creates confusion because I’m not sure how that fits into all of this.

I’m going through a lot of uncertainty and thinking about all of this, and it’s really painful. I often wonder if he’s straight and how our friendship would be affected if I showed him how I truly feel. I’m trying to balance not wanting to ruin our friendship but at the same time, I can’t ignore my emotions. I’m afraid that if I make any move toward him, I might lose him as a friend.

I don’t have many people to turn to for support because **no one but one friend knows I’m gay**, and we don’t talk much anymore. Since I moved cities. That leaves me feeling very lonely, because I’m scared I’ll have to keep all of this to myself. But I think it will just make me feel worse so I came here.

I feel like I might go crazy from the stress and uncertainty because I’m not sure how to handle this. Honestly, I’m not even sure what I want out of all of this, but I feel like I need someone to share my thoughts and feelings with.

I’m asking for help in figuring out how to cope with this situation and how to deal with my emotions towards my friend. And your opinion on my burning question of is he gay or not and what should I do about it.

Btw I apologise for the whole essay on my problems and the grammatical mistakes it probably has english is not my native language.

1kk9vqr,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_QuietVestige/comments/1kk9vqr/i_hope_you_found_the_water/,I Hope You Found the Water,"***Dean***

***Present Day***

The air in the garage had gone stale days ago. Or hours. It was hard to tell anymore. Time didn’t flow here, it curdled. There was blood on the concrete again. His blood, mostly dried now, flaking when he shifted. A low hum vibrated from somewhere in the walls. A fuse box? A fridge? Maybe his own body buzzing, waiting for the final act.

Dean sat slumped against the wall, wrists raw from the ropes they’d stopped bothering to retighten. His body had long since stopped resisting. His mind, though, his mind was sharp. Clearer than it had ever been.

“I used to think a confession was something you earned,” he said aloud, the sound thin in the dark. “Like if you hurt bad enough… or bled long enough, someone out there would let you explain.”

His voice didn’t echo. The garage swallowed it whole.

“But no one’s coming. Not really.”

He wasn’t sure who he was talking to. Maybe Maya, if she ever found this place. Maybe his father. Or maybe just himself, the version of him that still thought prayers meant something.

He let his head tilt back against the wood paneling. The scent of motor oil lingered, like a ghost from his childhood. His dad had always smelled faintly like that. Oil, sawdust, and that damn hand wash.

“That place was my sanctuary,” Dean murmured. “Dad made it that way. Scripture verses taped to the rafters… tools lined like soldiers… coffee cans full of shit we’d never use but couldn’t throw away.”

He could still see Owen hunched over his workbench, sanding something slowly, deliberately. *“The world needs order, Dean. Even in chaos, build something.”* That voice echoed louder than his own.

“Funny how I’ve torn down more than I ever built.” His lip cracked as he smiled ironically.

His fingers brushed against the floor beside him, where the cement met a line of faded masking tape. He remembered a time that, as a boy, he’d helped Owen mark off tool zones like it was sacred geometry. He’d been so proud. So eager to learn.

He closed his eyes and saw the reservoir again.

Caleb standing shirtless at the edge of the rocks, grinning like they were invincible. “Come on, man. Don’t be a coward.” Dean had stood frozen, the summer heat blistering his skin, terrified of what waited beneath the surface.

“I keep going back to that day,” Dean said softly. “Caleb just… jumped. Like nothing could touch him.” His eyes opened, glazed with memory. “I wasn’t afraid of the fall. I was afraid of the change. Of who I’d be after.” And Ethan had known that. Had looked into Dean like he was a cracked window and slipped right through.

“Ethan saw a boy aching to be remade and gave him a purpose that felt holy.” Dean let the silence stretch.

“But it wasn’t.” His throat tightened, but he didn’t cry. Not anymore. “*‘They’ll call it faith if you do it with your eyes closed,’* Dad said once. I thought he was being poetic. Turns out he was warning me.” The breath he released was shaky, but light.

“I wanted to belong so badly… I handed Ethan the matchbook and asked which one to light.” He looked down at his hands, how callused those knuckles were. All the broken skin and scars. The tools of a zealot.

“I thought if I obeyed enough, fought enough, bled enough, I’d earn love. God’s. Ethan’s. My father’s.” He laughed, low and bitter. “I spent years mistaking quiet violence for devotion. Righteousness for control. And I let them make me a blade.” His voice cracked at the last word.

“But I know better now.” He shifted, one leg stretched out, the other bent at the knee. Blood had dried around his sock line. “I used to beg. For mercy. For Maya. For something holy to interrupt all of this. But tonight?” He sat straighter and leaned into it.

“No more.”

A breeze slipped in through the crack beneath the garage door. It carried dust and the smell of night rain.

“Because I’ve remembered who I was before all this. Before Ethan. Before I put on the black suit and called it armor.” His voice softened. “I’ve remembered how even saints bleed.”

“I was just a kid who wanted to keep his dad proud. Who believed in something bigger. Who believed people were mostly good… because that’s what *Owen* taught me.” He touched his chest like, maybe, his father was still there somehow.

“*‘We’re all just trying to do better than we did yesterday.’* That’s what he said. *‘That’s all the Lord really asks.’*” Dean smiled for real this time. It wasn’t uncomfortable, yet it felt true.

“I can believe that again. I can believe that the younger version of me, who was scared, eager, and blind, wasn’t evil. Just desperate.” He paused, ready to drop the weight he’d picked up years ago. The one he’d accepted in his father’s garage years ago.

“And I can forgive him.”

It came out as a breath, but rushed out like the wind.

“Not because he earned it… I don’t want to carry him in shame anymore. That version of me… he brought me here. And here’s where I finally saw it all.” His hand rested with steadiness now.

“The whole crooked empire. The men behind the curtains. The bloodstained pulpits.”

He looked toward the ceiling, picturing where Owen had once hung a model airplane. It was long gone now. Dean’s breath came quickly and raspy as he spoke.

“I don’t regret the fire, everything needed to burn. I only regret I had taken so long to light it.”

He thought of Caleb. Of the way they used to pass notes in seminary, draw swords on napkins, and laugh in the quiet way boys do, carefully, with reverence they didn’t believe in but couldn’t break.

“I wish I could tell Caleb I’m sorry,” he said. “That I miss the boy whosnuckOreos into fast and testimony meetings. That I hope he’s okay, wherever he is.” He let his eyes close again. This time, he pictured Maya.

“And I wish Maya had never followed me into this mess. But part of me is glad she did. Because she saw me, not the bruised fists or the church-boy grin. Me.” The quiet returned. It stayed for a long time. Like even time was waiting with him. Then, in what could have been seconds or an eon, he heard a breath of motion. A step. Dean didn’t flinch.

“Dad,” he whispered, “I hope you know I heard you, even when I pretended not to. I hope you’re waiting somewhere warm. Somewhere quiet. I hope you followed the water.”

The doorknob twisted. Dean didn’t move, his eyes stayed on the floor. The hinges groaned open. A shaft of blinding light split the room. He didn’t shield his eyes or look up to the newcomer.

He just said, steady and calm:

“Took you long enough.”

They weren’t hunting foxes… Part 2,"The morning broke not with the sun, but with a pale light pushing through a heavy veil of mist. Dew clung to the hedgerows of spindle and hawthorn like sweat on fevered skin, and the ash trees stood as grey silhouettes-sentinels in mourning. There I stood at the edge of the kitchen garden, cradling a mug of black coffee, watching a pair of jackdaws peck at the remnants of seeds scattered on the path.


In the distance, an old woman moved through the fog towards the woodland. Others joined her quietly, emerging like ghosts on the moor- men and women placing small offerings at the wood’s edge. A freshly shot wood pigeon,  feathers still damp with blood, a brace of rabbits, a wedge of cheddar cheese, strawberries and a wicker basket of pink lady apples. One man laid what appeared to be a wooden carving of a fox, weather-worn but clearly treasured.

At that moment I felt it- the land holding its breath.

“They’re leaving offerings…” 

It was James, having gotten up earlier to work on the farm before everyone else. “For the Redling no doubt”.

“Why are they feeding him?” I whispered.

“Because some think he’s still a boy. Others think he’s a god. And maybe they’re both right,” James answered.

That afternoon, the group fanned out for recon. We took turns watching the hunting lodge in the beech hanger above the village. Hidden behind gorse and brambles, Sophie and I lay flat in the grass, binoculars on the sprawling estate. There over several yards we got the picture of what we were dealing with… 

Hunting lords and their sycophants, a a string quartet playing “Waltz of the Flowers”,  champagne flutes in one hand, riding crops in the other. A bonfire crackled on in the centre of the fete champetre as servants wondered, offering hors d’oeuvre. The fact these people were enjoying themselves at this meet, likely anticipating the idea of a human child being torn to shreds for some twisted ritual sicken me to the stomach. Then came the hour of the man itself. The devil in velvet hunting coat, lifting his drink as the fire crackled 

Lord Robert Darrow, a slender man in his seventies with silver hair, a thin, hawk like nose and a haughty tone. The type you often seen in  some snobby elite club.

“To the Old Ways!” He cried. “To dominion! To the Wyrd that bends the wood and blood!”.

The crowd cheered. Snippets of conversation followed- coded, careful:

“…he’s ready now. Been seen by standing stones…”

“…another year, another offering…”

“…same line. Always the same methods…”

Back at the farmhouse. Sophie paced furiously 

“This isn’t hunting. This is a fucking cult- they really going to sacrifice a child for some folkloric bullcrap”.

Nick was busy tinkering with one of his radios while Tom was researching hacked documents. Me, I was watching out the window… I swore the Redling was out there watching me in return. He knows we talking about him.

Sophie slammed her fist onto the table, her voice now crackling with frustation. “Why hasn’t the village done anything to stop this? How can you all let this happen? Your own child is going to die… and for what? Some folkloric bullshit?”

James slowly looked up. “Because they think we’re nothing.”

He rose, leading to the mantle. “To those bastards, we’re filth. Bumpkins. ‘Can’t tell a hedgehog from a hair brush.’ That’s what Darrow call us once. And we believed it. Or at last, we were scared enough to act like we did.’

Silence.

“I know my son’s out there,” James said softly. “Michael probably doesn’t remember who he is… doesn’t who he’s father is. Just waiting for this brutes and those mangy mutts to tear him to pieces like fucking Christmas wrapping paper. And one one will do nothing about it..”

James takes a deep breath “That’s why you lot are here… to help me put a stop into this madness… I don’t give a shit at this point if I get killed… or magical nature spirit gets pissed at us for not giving it what it wants… this needs to end.”

Nick finally spoke up “Then don’t call the police for help.. or even contact the neighbouring counties.”

James scoffed “Yeah Brillant mate.. ‘Hello Police.. I like to report a fox hunting cult kidnapping kids and sacrificing to a pagan god‘… who’s going to believe us?.”

Joe picked something plushy from the mantelpiece… a soft fox plush… a bit tattered from old age but holding its endearing charm. “I don’t care if I lose a thousand lambs to the foxes… I don’t care I lose the farm or get hung for treason by village… I just want my son back.

He stared into the glassy eyes of the stuffed animal… and I swore I could a stray tear…
“This bloody little thing… this was Micheal’s favourite toy… he called it Tod… ironic honestly… I hated foxes… yet he adored them.. they were his favourite animal”.

The next day was full of small unease: shrines found along the treeline, bones and woven brambles, a trail camera of Tom knocked over and snapped in half. “Those toffee nosed bastards..” Tom murmured in frustration.

We discovered a hidden clearing behind a blackberry thicket, where villagers have formed a crude circle of dried flowers, candles and charred wood in the center.

Nick had a good idea what it meant.

The following night, we watched the hunting lodge again. The party grew more rowdy.
Music drifted over the fields, distorted by wind and fog. I caught Lord Darrow in my view once again standing by the fire, now with a grotesque pelt of a victim of his fox hunts draped over his shoulders.

He spoke again to his followers.

“In two days will the child of beasts of prey run. 
The land will be reminded who holds the whip. And once again Mother Nature will kneel to her masters!”

We listened to the rhythm of the woodland as we sat on the porch… planning our move on the hunt.

James joined with Tod cradled in his arms like a newborn baby “We need to act first” James sat directly. “This isn’t just Micheal or bloody foxes anymore… but many children to come before us”.

The autumn fog thickened like porridge, curling around the farmhouse like smoke.

I couldn’t sleep that night. I came to this village to help put an end to fox hunting… only to dragged into a conspiracy.

Once I finally succumbed to fatigue- I dreamt. I dreamt of running through the eaves and undebrush with roots like bare knotted fists. Behind me a pack of hellish dogs with red eyes and frothing maws snapping at my heels. Ahead: the Redling at the edge of the woods, staring at me with bright amber eyes and whisper “Would you bleed to stop them?’

I snapped out of my nightmare… only to see a fox staring out of my window. Once it noticed I was awake the beast trotted back into the thickets. What does this all mean?

1kk9s22,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1kk9s22/can_the_simpure_sp4ro75_replacement_filter/,Can the SimPure SP4-RO75 Replacement Filter Improve Water Quality? A Detailed Review,"The **SimPure SP4-RO75 5-Stage Reverse Osmosis Replacement Filter Set** came into my life just in time, as my kitchen water filtration system was begging for an upgrade. From hearty lunches to late-night tea rituals, clean water plays a massive role in our household’s daily routine. Naturally, I wanted a product that could handle the job efficiently without diving too deep into my wallet. Spoiler alert—I was satisfied with what this filter set had to offer, but not without a few reservations.

**Design and Compatibility**  
As someone who struggles with technical setups, I immediately appreciated the universal compatibility of this filter set. The marketing claimed it fit most 10” standard under-the-sink reverse osmosis systems, and happily, it delivered. I paired mine with an APEC Water Systems ROES-PH75, and the installation was a breeze. The kit even included quick-connect T fittings, which is a life-saver if your system uses screw-in inline filters. The sediment, pre-carbon, RO membrane, and post-carbon filters came well-packaged, labeled clearly, and ready to go. Even if you’re a DIY novice, this setup will make you feel like a professional.

[Looking for SimPure SP4-RO75 discounts? Check Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b07v33hrtl/)

**Filtration Performance**  
The filtration quality is where this product truly pulls its weight. I enjoy the idea of battling unseen enemies, and this set obliterates contaminants like sediment, dissolved solids, chlorine, fluoride, and heavy metals. It pretty much filters anything that could turn your water into something sketchy. My tea tastes brighter, and everyone in my family swears their morning coffee is now café-worthy. It's satisfying knowing the water we’ve been drinking is free from potentially harmful stuff I didn’t want to think about before.

**Positives**  
- Effective at removing chlorine, odors, and other contaminants.  
- Compatible with standard-sized systems, ensuring versatility.  
- Includes both granular and block activated carbon filters for enhanced filtration.  
- Easy installation process even for first-time users.  

**Negatives**  
- The quick-connect fittings, while useful, felt slightly flimsy when I installed them.  
- Instructions were a bit sparse—had to crosscheck with online videos.  

**Durability and Lifespan**  
Every filter set promises longevity, but this one seems to genuinely live up to that claim. With a 75 GPD RO membrane engineered for density-graded filtration, I haven’t seen any issues with flow rate or performance consistency yet. My water consumption is pretty average, and the filters have shown no noticeable dips in efficiency over weeks of heavy use. Plus, it’s backed by NSF certifications which inspire some confidence in the product’s safety standards.

**Installation Process**  
Usually, the thought of plumbing work sends me running for the hills, but this filter set simplified the process. The quick-connect setup eliminated stress and guesswork. It took me just under 20 minutes to replace the old filters, which included deciphering the user manual—admittedly thinner than it should be. While seasoned users wouldn’t blink, I ended up watching YouTube tutorials for peace of mind.

**Rival Brands**  
The APEC Water RO-90 was the competitor product I briefly considered while shopping. APEC offers excellent filtration, but it comes at a slightly higher price point, especially with the replacement filters. This SimPure set brought comparable RO efficiency and slightly better ease of use during installation. Other brands like iSpring and Express Water compete well in versatility but lack the NSF certification featured here, which solidifies SimPure as the more reassuring choice for safety-conscious pickers.

**Price Performance**  
For the features packed into this filter set, it definitely offers a smart spending choice. With five stages of filtration, compatibility, and efficient filtration, the product punches above its weight. Sure, there are minor flaws, but nothing that overshadowed its value. If sparkling clean drinking water is a must-have in your daily lineup (as it should be), this set won’t feel like an overinvestment.

I’ve got to hand it to Zulay Kitchen; the overall design is both functional and aesthetically pleasing. The extra-thick, shatter-resistant glass gives it a premium feel while offering durability. Plus, the silver-tone stainless steel accents, including the lid and spigot, scream sophistication. The 1-gallon capacity works perfectly for someone like me who loves prepping a large batch of cold brew, especially during warm afternoons when coffee feels more refreshing on ice. That said, the spigot could benefit from slightly smoother operation as it felt a tad stiff when pouring.

**Ease of Use – Brewing Without Complication**  
Using this coffee maker couldn’t be easier. It took me about two minutes to load coffee grounds into the reusable stainless-steel mesh filter and pour water into the carafe. The promise of fresh cold brew in 12-18 hours held true—I set this thing up before bed, and by the next morning, voilà, my invigorating brew awaited. The airtight lid helped retain the rich flavors (and prevent accidental fridge spills, which I’m notorious for). Just note, the cleaning process—mainly rinsing that fine mesh filter—might take a little extra care to ensure no residual grounds are left clinging on.

**Key Benefits**  
- The glass container is durable and sizeable—ideal for entertaining or personal use.  
- Reusable filter ensures no coffee grounds sneak into the brew, delivering smooth results.  
- Multi-purpose functionality works great not just for coffee but tea or even infused beverages.  

**Some Downsides Worth Mentioning**  
The Zulay Cold Brew Coffee Maker has plenty going for it, yet no product is perfect. Here are a few areas that stood out:  
- The spigot could operate more smoothly; sometimes it felt like it would get stuck mid-pour.  
- A minor detail, but the warning about California's Prop 65 might give overly cautious users something to consider.  
- While sturdy, the glass feels heavier than expected, making it less ideal for frequent repositioning.  

**Portable and Suited for Coffee-Loving Families**  
I can attest that this coffee maker’s versatility delighted everyone in my household. My partner, an iced tea connoisseur, appropriated it over the weekend for lemonade infusion, and the results were just as stellar as my cold brew. Hosting friends? With the 1-gallon capacity, there’s plenty of brew for everyone, and it doubles as a sleek beverage dispenser.

**Industries Competitive Players**  
Pitting this coffee maker against rival products like the Takeya Cold Brew Maker, I noticed distinct differences that place Zulay’s version in its own category. While the Takeya might offer a lighter and more portable plastic body, it lacks the visual appeal and longevity that Zulay’s glass build delivers. Similarly, compared to OXO's Cold Brew Coffee Maker, Zulay lands as more affordable, albeit with fewer bells and whistles in terms of design intricacy. This balance of style, durability, and ease of use makes the Zulay Cold Brew stand out.

**Price Performance Evaluated**  
Considering the long-term cost savings of making coffee at home versus visiting the local café daily, the Zulay Kitchen Cold Brew Coffee Maker delivers fantastic value. I wouldn’t call it the cheapest option on the market, but its durability and design justify the slight premium. How many tools in the kitchen feel this polished yet low-maintenance? Except for the minor spigot gripe, it seems built to last years while delivering consistent brewing results.

Not to mention the mess to parse queries and do syntax checks.


👍But you could always outsource it to an external services that are already running outside CODESYS Env.


How did I solve it?

I wrote a library on CODESYS side that has the following API attached.


Then, you could go fancy and use the ""Adapter Design Pattern"" and implement you favorite communication interface , be it Modbus TCP, OpcUA, or even shared memory.


Then your service, written in C++ or your favorite language, would do all the processing.

For some context, we both love guinea pigs and she recently bought her first house. Well, she decided to take the day off from work since she had some PTO accruing and wanted to relax. We’re both big nature lovers and she’s been working on making transitioning her lawn into a more native environment. She also does this because her guinea pigs love dandelions. I don’t know too much about her relationship with her neighbors, but I guess the boomer couple to her right are just… nosey. She says their lawn is barren of anything besides grass and a couple flowers here and there. Apparently they can’t fathom the concept of a natural landscape (yes, this is the US). Well THANK GOODNESS she took the day off work because sometime in the afternoon she looked outside to see her neighbor pushing something along her yard. She ran out there yelling asking what the hell he was doing and she said he gave her one of those fake smiles and went “I’m getting rid of those ugly weeds for you”. You guys, those “ugly weeds” he was talking about weren’t just dandelions but important native flowers like milkweed that she had bought and planted. 

Now here’s the messed up part. She has an outdoor enclosure for her guinea pigs to graze on nice days. That’s ONE of the reasons she doesn’t treat her yard with those chemicals. She told her neighbor that stuff could kill her guinea pigs when they’re outside and his response? Something along the lines of “oh I don’t think it’s that big of a deal, they wouldn’t sell this stuff if it’s harmful”. 

She didn’t really say what happened after that but I’m hoping she went off on him. ",40,1746992425.0,BoomersBeingFools,8,0.98,False

1kk9ddo,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1kk9ddo/my_dad_didnt_go_to_my_college_graduation/,My dad didn’t go to my college graduation.,"It’s just as I said. I (early 30’s f) have not always been… stable. Even as a kid, I had a habit of just pushing down things that bother me and trying to keep going, even for the sake of keeping the pace. In doing so, I ended up going to school for a career I didn’t really want, due to those people pleasing tendencies, until covid curtailed those plans and almost killed me. While in the hospital, I realized what I really wanted and set out to do it.

A bit of background, my dad missed a lot of my  life. For 16 years of my life, he was incarcerated. And my mom (biologically his mother who raised me after my bio mom abandoned me which is a story for another day) raised me alone. This wasn’t cheap, I wasn’t a healthy kid or an emotionally stable one. I wasn’t prone to respiratory distress and emotional outbursts that she didn’t know how to deal with, but at least she stayed.

The person who helped her the most is her younger brother. I love that man, he’s my favorite uncle and possibly my favorite person. I’m not a fan of talking on the phone, but I’ll wrestle the phone out of my mom’s hand to talk to him. He doesn’t have kids of his own and I’m the closest thing to that for him, Despite living states away.

Raising a child alone isn’t cheap, and sometimes mom struggled to make ends meet, so whenever she needed a hand, it was always my uncle to help. I never lacked for clothes, shoes, medical or school supplies thanks to his help. He was also one of my first teachers, delving deep into our family history with me, whenever I was in his state, he would take me to not only to amusement parks, but also museums, zoos, and to the plantations in the south where our family was held, he made sure I knew our family history truthfully and never once stopped my questions, especially when I got into the American girl books. He would always explain the historical context behind things in the books for me and encourage me to do my own research for us to discuss later.

Unfortunately, before I was born, mom’s older brother (now deceased) and my father had some sort of disagreement, if it can even be described as such and cousin said that my uncle took the side of my deceased uncle and this angered my dad. This cousin is notorious for being a pot-stirrer and not much of the family, my dad included, don’t associate with her any more. Unfortunately, my dad still holds that grudge.

Back to present day:

Considering his close we are and everything he’s done for me, I wanted my uncle at my graduation. This was a big deal for me. I’m a first gen graduate for fucks sake! My uncle called me and said he wanted to come but was worried by dad wouldn’t show because of him. I told him I wouldn’t be completely shocked if this was the case, but that he’s my father and maybe he would remember that. That he’s already missed so much and the stadium the commencement was in was so big he could sit elsewhere. I then told my uncle I really wanted him to show, and so he a cousin made the 7 hour drive to come to my graduation.

My dad who lives in the same state, mind you, called my mom, not me, to say he wasn’t coming. I could hear her asking angrily on the phone “You’re really gonna that to her?!” Before hanging up and telling me he was no longer coming.

I just did what I used to do, take a deep breath, made myself some coffee and got back to preparing for the evening. True to his word, he didn’t show. He did send a text asking me to call him, but I haven’t responded and he’s made no attempt to reach out since. This morning, I asked if he at least texted my mom to wish her happy Mother’s Day and of course is ass didn’t.

I don’t know what I’m trying to do by bringing this here, I guess for some reason today it’s finally upsetting me. I wanna scream, I wanna punch something. I wanna remind him that I’m the only one of his two kids whose worth a damn and ever gonna graduate, seeing as the other won’t be able to pass a background check to get into college or decent work that doesn’t involve illegal substances.

I want to yell at him and tell him to forget he has a daughter, that doing so shouldn’t be too hard for him since his ass is never there when I need him anyway. I want to tell him that he’s incapable of being the father I want and that I give up. I want to remind him that my mom, his birth mother who took over in his stead and the man who he holds a grudge against due to hearsay did his and his ex girlfriends job and the least he can do is show up.

The split second we saw each other his aura completely flipped. Hardly smiled, awkward silence as we waited for coffee, etc. 

We managed to make polite conversation sitting down, but even this was peppered with awkward silence.  After we got up and said goodbye, I went to throw my coffee away and he had already left in the complete opposite direction. Of course, the usual block/unfollow occurred after the date from both of us, which confirmed it. I thought maybe he might have been nervous, but it was borderline frustrated the mood he gave off. 

Safe to say, this hurts and can be confusing. Hilariously enough, walking to the same date I had a guy make passionate eye contact with me through a restaurant window.

And I feel pretty low on the prospect of getting a job, though I've been applying for at least 1year and 5 months (I know a lot of people have probably been at it longer with better qualifications)

I just want work and proper experience I can use in other aspects of my life. I just want to finally have an independent form of income from my parents, though I'm still in school. something for emergencies, to go into savings or just to be reliable form of support for the people around me.


These are some short summarise vaguely describing work experience topics or anything related to such:

1. I volunteered   at my church(usually as a Sunday school teacher/ teacher assistant) 
 
2. Volunteering   in climate-based clubs (cleaning parks/ replanting in areas impacted by storms/  building bird boxes for parks in Renfrewshire, etc)

3. I've had some experience with painting (traditional and digital) and using digital software (photoshop/clip studio)

4. In more recent years I've been doing a server job at my school where I've been delivering coffees. I also do baking as a hobby but I have baked for events at my church or celebrations for friends.

5. I've received heart start training and have gained information about how to deal with someone unconscious, how to identify a heart attack and cardiac arrest and how to preform CPR/chest compression.


I Can start anytime as soon as May ends, as I am in my exam period. And hopefully prospects of a job can show up before the next 3 months pass.

Also want the island to be completely free of sink or cooktop. Love the idea of a coffee station via larder doors. We have a separate pantry as well just behind the cabinet wall. If we put the fridge/freezer flanking the stove we will add a beverage center under the coffee station. Otherwise is the fridge/freezer too far from the work stove/sink?

So I came in and my coworker(20 something f) was immediately short, slamming things around and being nasty and passive aggressive to anything at all i said or did, i could tell she was super pissed at me & it made me really uncomfortable especially because I didn’t do anything.

 So it got to the point after maybe 10 minutes that I said to this coworker, “listen, I came in on my day off to help. I can see I’m greatly upsetting you for some reason, & given it’s my mother’s last Mother’s Day alive I am frankly too emotionally spent to closely work with someone being hostile to me for no reason at all when I came in to help and didn’t do anything wrong. So either we can start over and you can be cordial or I will go home.”  She stormed out and had a tantrum to our boss about it. But luckily the boss was on my side. 

Turns out, she was so mad because our work station wasnt up to her standard after my closing shift yesterday. I worked all day doing prep during a busy day otherwise, but naturally none of the mounds of work I did do actually mattered, but what did matter  was the fact that I forgot to rinse out the coffee pot, and that I only left 6 eggs to start off the day with-not that it matters, but that one is especially ridiculous. 6 eggs for our shop is more than enough to start off with, and this person just seems to have mental health issues that makes her lash out when things aren’t up to her arbitrary standard.

I don’t know, but if you ask me, a work station isn’t a good enough reason to be overtly hostile to someone, and I don’t know why she assumes I stand around all day doing nothing. I don’t, I work hard, there’s just only so much work you can do in a day. I didn’t leave it in bad shape at all though.

I told him that I wanted to go out and go on a hike/go to the zoo/amusement park. He said okay. He bought me a gift, a new espresso machine. I thought he listened to me, but knowing from past experiences, I planned Mothers Day dinner and made cinnamon rolls for myself. On Friday evening, we went and sat outside and he starts talking about how he needs to work on building our chicken coop this weekend and it’s a massive project, so he needs to start working on it that very night so he can get things done. I was kinda irritated because he brought home some cider to have, so I assumed that we would have a chill Friday evening and I could tell just from him talking that this was going to be a full weekend thing. I ask him if there were going to be any surprises on Mothers Day and he said no. He asked me if there should be and I said no, assuming that he remembered that I wanted to spend time together as a family on Sunday. Saturday morning he starts working on the chicken coop and starts saying how he doesn’t know how long it’s going to take and he is going to probably have to work on it on Sunday. I lose it. I am mad. I tell him that I thought we were doing stuff on Mother’s Day as a family. He acts surprised and tells me that he got me a gift and got coffee for me. I asked him if he remembered asking me what I wanted to do. He doesn’t. He is mad at me because he never has time to work on things and every weekend I will be mad at him for working on this massive project. I tell him no, I wouldn’t because every weekend isn’t a holiday. He basically says he has very little time to work on things and he’s not wrong. I don’t have time either. I am a SAHM with very little support from anyone. We never go on dates. The last time we did something was his Christmas work party. I never have alone time from the kids because he ALWAYS has to work on something on the house or whatever hobby he’s into. It’s always me watching the two kids, who are 1 and 2. He asks me what I want to do, but I say I don’t want to do anything because I don’t want a crabby husband doing stuff he doesn’t want to do and he said he HAS to finish leveling the ground this weekend. He orders Chinese takeout for us to have for dinner as an “I’m sorry” present. Sunday rolls around and I thought I could make peace and just be happy staying at home doing the usual things, but unfortunately I was still upset and he was irritated this morning which set me off. He can tell I am upset and that makes him even more irritated and annoyed. I decide I don’t want to stay at home and start researching what I want to do. Realize I can’t really go without planning lunch. I get mad because why the heck do I want go out by myself with my toddlers on Mothers Day. All I want for Mother’s Day is hanging out in the outdoors with my family, but my husband doesn’t understand. He basically told me that he doesn’t see Mothers Day as a real holiday and his actions have continually shown that I am secondary to whatever he wants to do.

She was coming over for lunch with Brandy to catch up. Naturally, Timmy and Carol were tasked with preparing the meal and serving.

The doorbell rang promptly at noon, and Carol went to answer it. Elise hadn’t visited since Carol’s arrival, and seeing her open the door in a crisp apron—clearly no longer a guest but one of Brandy’s servants—brought a delighted smile to Elise’s lips.

“Carol, dear, look at you—aproned up and everything,” she said cheerfully, handing over her light cardigan and purse without hesitation. The young blonde looked stunning in semi-casual attire, every bit the picture of a privileged beauty enjoying a casual lunch. “I see Brandy decided to keep you around for a bit. Isn’t that nice?”

Carol kept her eyes lowered as she accepted the items. “Yes, Miss Elise,” she said quietly, her tone deferential.

Just then, Brandy descended the stairs, her face lighting up at the sight of her friend. The two young women embraced, exchanging kisses on the cheek with excited chatter. Elise’s hand drifted down to Carol’s arm in a light, possessive grip.

“So,” she said with a knowing smile, “I see you decided to add this one to your staff. I knew you wouldn’t let her go.”

Brandy glanced toward Carol and smiled. “Yes, Carol’s doing just fine. She’s very well-behaved.”

Elise chuckled and reached out to tickle Carol lightly under the chin. “I’m so glad to hear that, Carol. I told Brandy you’d fit in well. You know your place, and you do as you’re told—like a good girl.”

The humiliation was unbearable—the way the 20-year-old called her a good girl, a woman forty years her senior. But Carol instinctively responded, her voice soft and obedient. “Thank you, Miss Elise.”

Brandy waved a hand dismissively. “Anyway, enough about the help. Tell me all about your trip. That resort looked amazing from your photos.”

Elise lit up. “Oh, it was incredible. We met some gorgeous couples. And let’s just say... the late-night parties got a little risqué.” She grinned, tossing her hair over her shoulder with a conspiratorial look.

Brandy squealed with delight, linking arms with her. “Oh my god, tell me everything.” She turned to Carol without even glancing back. “Carol, go finish getting lunch ready—and send Timmy out to the patio with the wine.”

The two girls floated out to the patio, already lost in gossip and laughter.

A few minutes later, Timmy emerged with a serving tray, balancing two glasses of chilled white wine. Brandy and Elise were lounging on cushioned patio chairs, barefoot and carefree, deep in conversation. Neither even glanced at him as he placed a glass in front of Brandy, then carefully leaned forward to serve Elise.

Just as he turned to leave, Elise reached out with two dainty fingers and lightly grabbed his wrist. She didn’t pause in her story—she was finishing a particularly juicy anecdote about a skinny-dipping couple they’d met in Corsica. Timmy stood frozen, unsure what to do, not daring to pull away, the tray still in his other hand.

Elise’s tone remained breezy. “...and then, as if that wasn’t enough, they actually invited us back to their suite.” She gave a sly little laugh, then casually spat her gum into Timmy’s waiting palm, never breaking eye contact with Brandy.

Timmy’s face turned crimson as the warm, sticky wad landed wetly in his hand. Elise released his wrist and went on talking as though nothing had happened.

Brandy laughed. “God, I’m jealous. I’ve got to get Trent to take me somewhere wild this summer.”

Still holding the gum, Timmy bowed his head and retreated silently to the kitchen, his dignity in tatters after being casually used as a spit receptacle.

Lunch was served shortly afterward—blackened shrimp Caesar salads plated perfectly on chilled white china. Brandy and Elise ate slowly on the patio, savoring both the food and their uninterrupted conversation. Timmy and Carol returned to routine chores, occasionally summoned with a finger snap for more wine or a fresh napkin.

Later in the afternoon, the girls moved inside, sprawling comfortably on the living room couch, their bare legs stretched out, chatting and sipping rosé. Timmy and Carol knelt obediently before them, giving foot rubs without instruction. Each servant held one delicate foot in their hands while the other rested on their shoulder. Brandy and Elise’s feet were soft, pampered, and unblemished from years of luxury. Timmy and Carol massaged silently, not daring to distract the two women they quietly served.

Timmy drifted into a dazed rhythm as he massaged Brandy’s arches, her toenails gleaming from a recent salon visit. But when Brandy lifted her foot to switch sides, Timmy—zoned out—failed to release her in time. His fingers gripped slightly too long.

She gave him a light kick to the cheek with the top of her foot. “Timmy,” she said sharply, her voice annoyed but casual. “When I pull my foot away, that means I’m switching. It doesn’t mean I want you to strangle it.”

“Sorry, Miss Brandy,” Timmy muttered, his face burning from the slap.

He adjusted quickly, accepting the other foot with reverent care as the girls returned to their conversation.

Just then, the front door opened and Trent walked in from work. His jacket was slung over one arm, and he looked relaxed but sharp in his dress shirt and loosened tie.

“Trent!” Brandy called. “You’re taking me to the South of France this summer.”

Trent chuckled. “Whatever you want, babe.” He leaned down to kiss her cheek, then greeted Elise. “Hey, honey. So, I take it you and Loucas had a good trip?”

Elise smirked. “Mm-hmm. And I hear the wedding’s going to be in Italy,” Trent said approvingly.

Elise raised a brow, teasing. “It should be gorgeous. Maybe my girl here will show up with a ring on her finger.”

Brandy rolled her eyes and swatted her friend playfully. “Shut up.”

Trent laughed, kissing Brandy on the lips. “Don’t put all this pressure on me—we’ll get her wifed up soon enough.”

He turned to Timmy. “Sorry to steal your masseuse, but I need him to take notes from a meeting I recorded this morning. I want them typed and clean by bedtime.”

Elise giggled. “Still got the poor boy doing secretarial work?”

Trent gave Timmy’s shoulder a light slap. “Oh, Timmy doesn’t mind. Do you?”

“No, sir,” Timmy replied softly.

Elise stood and pecked Brandy on the cheek. “I’ve got to get going anyway. Loucas is taking me to dinner. Carol, go fetch my bag.”

Carol scrambled off as Elise waved goodbye and headed out.

Trent turned back to Timmy. “Long meeting. Important. I want detailed notes. I’ll be reviewing them before bed—don’t disappoint me.”

“Yes, sir,” Timmy said, already heading for the office, knowing he wouldn’t be having any dinner tonight.

Nearly five hours later, Timmy was still working—eyes bleary, fingers sore, trying to identify who was speaking when and extract usable content from the meandering conversation. His phone buzzed. It was Trent.

“Timmy, you done yet? We’re getting tired up here, and I want to look them over.”

“Almost, sir. Just another thirty minutes,” Timmy said nervously.

“I want them in fifteen,” Trent replied flatly as the phone went silent

Fifteen frantic minutes later, Timmy was quietly knocking on the door to the master bedroom—his former bedroom. Brandy and Trent were reclined in the oversized bed, she in delicate lingerie, he still reviewing a few legal documents.

Brandy didn’t look up from her phone as Timmy stepped inside, stack of printed notes in hand.

""no mistakes right"" Trent said, taking the pages.

“No, sir,” Timmy replied.

“good boy, Put them in my briefcase. I’m leaving early tomorrow. Coffee ready by seven. Got it?”

“Yes, sir.”

as timmy headed to the door brandy spoke not looking up from her phone ""timmy im heading into the city for lunch with my cousin and shopping see that the car is cleaned thoroughly before we leave""

yes miss brandy timmy said standing there idly for a few seconds, she gave a dismissive wave signaling he had permission to leave.He slipped out of the room, stomach empty, shoulders aching, and made his way to the guest room. Another long day behind him—and another just hours away.

As Thanksgiving approached, Carol couldn’t shake the thought of spending the holiday with her sister. It had been months since they’d last seen each other, and the idea of stepping away from the house—even for a single day—felt like a rare chance at normalcy. But as she rehearsed how to bring it up to Brandy, her stomach twisted with unease.

One evening, she found Brandy in the living room, reclining comfortably on the couch. Her feet, perfectly pedicured, rested on a velvet cushion, toes painted a delicate blush pink. A soft throw was draped over her legs, and the faint scent of lavender lotion clung to the air around her. Brandy scrolled lazily through her phone, the screen casting a soft glow across her flawless, makeup-free skin.

Timmy was nearby, dusting the mantle—his movements careful and silent, trained, almost, to avoid notice. Carol hovered in the doorway, hands nervously clasping the hem of her apron. Brandy, though small and delicate, exuded an air of natural command. She didn’t need to bark orders; her mere presence was enough to make others wait in silence for instruction. Carol knew it was rare—almost unheard of—for either of them to approach Brandy unprompted. Though never explicitly forbidden, it had become clear that speaking to Miss Brandy without invitation was something done only with the utmost caution.

She swallowed hard and took a hesitant step forward.

“Miss Brandy,” she said softly, her voice tight with nerves.

Brandy didn’t look up. Her manicured thumb moved one final time across her screen before she finally set the phone in her lap and turned her head slowly, an eyebrow raised in faint curiosity. Her gaze was cool and unhurried.

“Yes, Carol?” she asked, her tone neutral but carrying a sharp edge—the kind that said *this had better be important*.

Carol cleared her throat, her heart hammering. “I… I was wondering if it might be alright for Timmy and me to visit my sister. Just for Thanksgiving Day,” she stammered. “We—we’d come back in the evening, of course. After finishing all preparations.”

Brandy blinked. Her expression didn’t soften—it hardened, eyes narrowing as though trying to comprehend the sheer absurdity of the request.

“Wait,” she said, her voice now sharp and cutting. “You want to leave? *On* Thanksgiving?”

Carol instinctively flinched at the tone. “Y-yes, Miss Brandy,” she said quickly. “I thought maybe I could get everything done beforehand—cleaning, decorating, anything you might need. And of course, we’d be back in time to serve dinner. That way, you wouldn’t be inconvenienced.”

Brandy let out a cold, humorless laugh. With a single motion, she swung her legs off the couch and stood up. Despite her petite frame and relaxed appearance, she commanded the room with startling authority. She took a slow step toward Carol, phone still in hand.

Carol immediately shrank back, lowering her eyes to the floor.

“I’m hosting Thanksgiving, Carol,” Brandy said, her voice tight with disbelief. “How, exactly, am I supposed to do that without help? Who is going to help me dress for the day? Did you forget my parents will be here, fresh off a transatlantic flight from Europe?”

Carol opened her mouth, but Brandy didn’t let her speak.

“Are you suggesting I do *domestic work*?” Brandy’s voice climbed slightly in pitch—less angry, more stunned. “Is that what you're saying? That *I* should clean? Should I grab a rag and help Timmy dust? Should I get on my knees and scrub the tiles with you in the kitchen? Is *that* what you want to see, Carol?”

“N-no, Miss Brandy,” Carol whispered, her hands shaking. “I—I just thought—”

“You *thought*?” Brandy snapped, cutting her off. In a flash, she raised her hand and struck Carol across the face.

The sound rang out—clean and sharp.

Carol staggered slightly from the force of it, but she didn’t lift a hand in defense. Her cheek burned, her eyes stung—but she kept them downcast.

Across the room, Timmy froze mid-dust, eyes wide, his body rigid. He stared at the scene, cloth hanging limply from his hand.

Brandy’s voice turned on him in an instant. “Timmy,” she said icily, “did I tell you to stop working?”

Timmy flinched and looked away. “N-no, Miss Brandy,” he mumbled, immediately resuming his task with frantic energy.

Brandy returned her attention to Carol, who now stood trembling before her, head bowed like a scolded child.

“You thought *what*, Carol?” Brandy said, stepping closer. “That I should be inconvenienced?”

“No, Miss Brandy,” Carol whispered.

Brandy’s voice dropped to a low, venomous murmur. “You don’t just come and go as you please, Carol. You and Timmy are not guests. You are my *servants*. You *belong* to me. And you will stay exactly where I tell you and do exactly what I tell you. Is that clear?”

Carol’s voice cracked as she answered, barely more than a breath. “Yes, Miss Brandy.”

Brandy straightened, folding her arms, studying the older woman like she was some disappointing piece of furniture.

“The *very idea* that you think it’s acceptable to suggest I do domestic work? It’s insulting. You and Timmy are given *privileges*. You don’t ask for them. You don’t suggest changes. You don’t *think*.”

“I—I’m sorry, Miss Brandy,” Carol said, her voice barely holding together.

Brandy stepped back, giving her one final glance to ensure the message had landed. Her eyes flicked briefly to Timmy, confirming he was still obediently at work.

“Good,” she said flatly. “Now get back to your chores. And I suggest you think long and hard before you ever speak to me again without being spoken to.”

“Yes, Miss Brandy,” Carol replied, her voice trembling as she turned and shuffled off toward the kitchen.



The slap still echoed on her cheek, but it was Brandy’s words that clung more painfully:

1kk90xx,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicIllness/comments/1kk90xx/trying_to_date_while_chronically_ill/,Trying to date while chronically ill,"Hello everyone,

I wanted to take a moment to share my feelings because I’ve been struggling with dating while dealing with my chronic illness. I was diagnosed with kidney failure due to a genetic disorder in late 2021. Since then, my insecurities and issues with self-image have increased, especially due to surgeries and how my skin can look tired and gray from dialysis. While some people say I don’t look very sick, I personally disagree when I look in the mirror.

Getting back into the dating scene has been really challenging, particularly after being in a three year relationship. That relationship became rocky towards the end, as my illness, which initially wasn’t a big issue, became significant over time. My exhaustion became a concern, and traveling was difficult unless I scheduled it around my dialysis treatments. Additionally, my kidney disease diet is quite restrictive, so eating out isn't really an option for me.

When I try using dating apps, I swipe and swipe, hoping to present myself as interesting as possible. I feel it’s crucial to mention my illness right away, so I try to put it in my profile. I believe it's important for someone to know, especially if they start to develop feelings for me and then I reveal my illness, which might cause them to disappear. That can be really painful. Unfortunately, when I do share this information, some people stop talking to me. I get it, but it still hurts.

Sometimes, these apps ask about your profession and annual income, which makes me feel sad because I don’t have a career right now I’m on disability. My annual income is minimal. I feel like I don’t have much to offer beyond companionship, love, empathy, and emotional intelligence. I try my best to stay positive and keep my spirits high, but I have to be honest: lately, I feel like I'm at an all time low. It often feels like I’m destined to be alone.

I probably shouldn’t be on dating apps, but I feel it’s one of the few ways to meet people. My hobbies include going to concerts, taking long walks, and visiting coffee shops and going to the gym. However, I’m a very shy person; I can have a conversation if someone approaches me, but initiating contact with strangers is not something I find easy.

I found this group on Reddit and thought I’d share my feelings here because I believe many of you might understand what I’m going through. I hope that by connecting with you all, I won’t feel so alone. Honestly, every single day of my life feels incredibly lonely, and it’s starting to wear me down. I thought my life was challenging before, dealing with my mental health, but since I became ill, it feels like it has completely unraveled me.",3,1746991414.0,ChronicIllness,0,1.0,False
1kk8zqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/suppreview/comments/1kk8zqq/i_quit_caffeine_and_tried_dopamine_for_30_days/,I quit caffeine and tried dopamine+ for 30 days; here’s what happened,"No caffeine.

No nootropics.

Just one bottle of Transparent Labs Dopamine+.

4 capsules every morning.

I wanted to see what would happen if I supported dopamine directly, without relying on stimulants or sketchy herbs.

Here’s the full 30-day breakdown.

# Week 1: friction started disappearing

First few days? Flat.

By Day 4 I noticed something that surprised me.

Tasks felt easier to start.

I wasn’t hyped or buzzing, but I wasn’t stuck.

It felt like the mental resistance to start anything had dialed down.

Not like a stimulant buzz. More like subtle momentum.

Especially on annoying stuff like emails, cleaning, basic chores.

No clue if it was the saffron or Sabroxy, but something definitely shifted.

Mood? Calmer. But clearer. I wasn’t irritated by dumb little things.

It was like my brain had WD-40 sprayed into its gears.

Even made it through a Sunday family meltdown without snapping.

# Week 2: caffeine who?

This week was weird.

I used to need two coffees before noon.

Now? Didn’t even think about it.

Zero coffee, zero crash, and somehow… zero spirals.

The L-Tyrosine plus Cognizin combo probably played a big role here.

No jittery edge. But also not sleepy.

It didn’t spike anything, just made focus easier to hold.

Writing sessions lasted longer. I didn’t hit the usual 45-minute wall.

Still no insane mood swings or motivation bursts. But the steady calm was real.

Felt more like my baseline was upgraded.

# Week 3: the real test

This week sucked.

I had multiple deadlines, family drama, and one night of only 3 hours of sleep.

Normally I’d spiral a bit and hit a motivational wall.

But I didn’t.

I dragged, sure. But I got stuff done.

There was resilience I don’t usually have when I’m running on empty.

Mood held surprisingly stable.

I still didn’t feel euphoric, but I wasn’t collapsing either.

Around Day 6 I wondered if I was just imagining it—then I caught myself cleaning the kitchen on autopilot.

# Week 4: okay, I’m sold

By the last week, the effects were just normal.

No dramatic bursts, but I realized how consistently I was getting things done.

No caffeine dependency. No crash loops. Just clarity.

I actually started waking up and doing stuff without internal resistance.

I even started looking forward to writing.

It made mornings less of a battle.

Scrolled Reddit for 20 minutes before realizing I’d already finished my task list.

If you’ve ever felt like your brain has ideas but your body won’t move—you’ll get this.

Transparent Labs Dopamine+ just made things click.

Here’s [the one I used](https://transparentlabs.sjv.io/N9bmQO)

# Pros

* No stimulants, so no crash  
* Clearer mood and fewer emotional dips  
* Easier focus, less procrastination  
* Actually worked even on sleep-deprived days  
* Uses real research-backed stuff, not just pixie dust  

# Cons

* 4 pills is a lot for a single dose  
* Doesn’t make you ""feel"" something intense (no rush)  
* Slight appetite dip in week 2 (went away though)  
* Not cheap unless you subscribe  
* Tried it one day at 5 PM and couldn’t fall asleep till 1 AM

# Verdict

Dopamine+ isn’t a hype supplement.

It doesn’t buzz your brain, but it oils your gears.

If you want clean focus, better mood, and to gently unstick yourself, it’s worth trying.

I’m not going back to caffeine dependency.

I'm looking for a truly authentic connection that has the potential to grow into a meaningful, long-term partnership – think building a shared world, not just visiting one.

Life here is a bit of a quiet adventure – juggling a remote job, chipping away at studies, and finding comfort in a simple, intentional routine. My ideal evening usually involves diving deep into a sci-fi universe (current obsessions include The Expanse, Silo, Star Trek, Stargate, Foundation), exploring fascinating documentaries, or getting lost in a perfectly curated soundtrack. If you can discuss the theoretical physics of warp drive or the political structures of The Last Kingdom, we're probably off to a great start! I still have a soft spot for gaming and anime, parts of my past that shaped my inner nerd.

I'm not someone who thrives on constant external stimulation. I find joy in the quiet moments, the intellectual rabbit holes, and the comfort of routine. I don't drink, smoke, or do drugs – my vices extend to perhaps too much fruit juice and an unwavering loyalty to tea (if you're a coffee person, we can agree to disagree peacefully!).

When I care about someone, I'm all in. I'm the kind of person who wants to be truly present – to listen, to support, and to navigate life's ups and downs together. I believe relationships flourish on mutual reciprocity, consistent effort, and knowing you have a reliable teammate by your side. I value loyalty, emotional honesty, and showing up consistently when it counts. I guess you could say I value closeness and connection deeply.

I'm genuinely hoping to find an emotionally available woman who feels similarly. Someone kind, open-hearted, and ready to invest in building something real, starting with a solid foundation of friendship and seeing where that authentic connection leads. Please note: To make consistent communication and calls feasible for a growing connection, I'm prioritizing connections where the time difference is ideally no more than about 7 hours from Brazil (BRT, UTC-3).

My future vision is simple but profound: building a peaceful, loving life with a monogamous partner. I dream of a cozy home (maybe a cat or two?), perhaps a bit of quiet countryside eventually, and definitely exploring the world side by side. I'm working towards starting my own company, driven by that desire for a stable, shared future.

This isn't a search for fleeting moments. I'm serious about finding my person for a long-term, deeply connected life.

For me, getting to know someone genuinely means moving beyond text. Voice and video calls are really important to me as we figure out if there's a real spark and connection beyond the words on a screen. If that feels like a good next step for you too, that's a great sign.

If you're a woman whose heart beats for genuine connection, appreciates a reliable nerd, and isn't afraid of building something consistent and deep, please reach out! Tell me a bit about yourself – where you are in the world, your age, time zone, and what part of my rambling struck a chord. Low-effort messages tend to get lost in the digital ether; I'm looking for someone ready to put a little mutual energy in from the start.

1kk8t2i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Egypt/comments/1kk8t2i/how_do_religious_egyptians_meet_people_for/,How do religious Egyptians meet people for marriage?,"Assalamu alaykum,

I'm planning on moving to Egypt soon (Cairo or Alexandria, haven't decided yet). I'm not specifically looking to get married there, but I'm not closed off to the idea either, so I would like to know more about the cultural norms around meeting people for marriage.

For context, I'm a European Muslim woman in my early twenties. I grew up in a very liberal Muslim community and I'm afraid that what I was taught about getting to know people for marriage is not acceptable for religious Egyptians and that they would percieve me as being easy or not looking for something serious. That's why I would have a few questions:

1. Is going out alone for coffee/meal in a public place okay? Or should there always be a third person there? 

2. If a man is interested in marriage, will he ask for my father's number early on?

3. Are the men who approach women in public/restaurants/coffee shops always just looking for smth not halal/not serious? 

4. I'm not shy and wouldn't mind approaching someone I like. Is this acceptable, or would it maybe be taken the wrong way?

5. I sometimes feel weird when Middle Eastern men show interest in me because I assume it has something to do with me being white or a foreigner (I can often tell this is the case by things they say). This always feels really uncomfortable and weird, and it makes me overly careful when it comes to guys from the ME because I don't know if they like me or just have some weird thing for white women or think we're easy (another common stereotype). Is there a way to figure this out in the beginning and would this be a concern in Egypt? 

6. Is it normal for family members to ask if you want to meet their son/brother/cousin? When I was at the Azhar mosque a woman asked me if I want to meet her son and I got scared and went away lol, I'm not used to that.

7. Lastly, and I hope this doesn't come off as arrogant, but I'm well educated and financially stable. Most places I went to in Egypt, people are really poor and not that educated. I obviously don't look down on them, but that's not what I'm looking for. Are there places where I can meet people who have a more similar background to mine (more in terms of education rather than financial)? This goes for friendships as well, as I would like to meet girls with similar interests to hang out with, but it's difficult as I will be working from home. My Arabic is so-so, but I'll be learning there inshallah.

Some of my questions may sound silly, but Egypt is very different from what I'm used to, so I wanted to make sure. And advice is welcome :)

I filled those holes with coffee, but I'm drinking like 3 mugs a day and it's been making me jittery, doesn't really add much to the feelings I have when doing my hobbies, and I'm caring more about health lately, as well as not wanting my teeth to get stained from drinking tons of it every day.   

So like, what else is there? I'm about to start putting icy hot on my balls just for the rush, I would love just the tiniest bit of escape, or lift. ",1,1746990844.0,Advice,4,1.0,False

Every one is going to react different to getting their gallbladder removed, but I think it’s important to share the positive side, because often, there’s a bias when it comes to posting online because most people come to vent about their negative experiences. So it seems like everyone is suffering, but in reality, there are positive experiences too. 

I won’t go too much into my diagnosis story, but it took 15 months for me to get diagnosed. 

I was anxious to get surgery because I already have difficulty maintaining my weight and I was worried that I wouldn’t be able to eat normally after getting it out. 

I pushed all the negative thoughts back and remained positive, which I think is super important. 

I am 13 days post-op. No issues with surgery, no issues with recovery. Of course the first couple days were hard but it’s so much better now. 
I am still a little sore and can’t lift things but I am living normally for the most part aside from not being able to exercise again yet. 

The first few days I took it slow. Only had plain toast, crackers, soup. Day 3 or 4, I had French toast with butter and maple syrup, spaghetti with turkey sausage, salmon and rice. Pancakes with syrup. No issues. 

I have had eggs in the mornings and have no issues whatsoever.

I recently ventured further and had Crumbl cookies!!! And coffee! And cheese!! And no issues!! I’ve missed these things so much. Of course I don’t gorge myself, I only have a mini cookie per day. (I got a half dozen lol). 

I just had bacon and eggs over sourdough and no issues either. I had OYSTERS yesterday and was completely fine. 

So, just know that there is hope. Most people have success, give or take a little adjustment. Hang in there, and do what you feel is best for you 🤍

1kk8nvl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllInclusiveResorts/comments/1kk8nvl/detailed_trip_reportreview_marina_el_cid_hotel/,Detailed Trip Report/Review: Marina El Cid (Hotel Marina/Ventus/Ventus Ha) Puerto Morelos/Cancun (very pleased!),"**Intro/Background:**

I was looking for an affordable and relaxing last minute solo (22M) getaway to an AI for 2-nights. As a Marriott Titanium, I originally booked at the Royalton Riviera, but then read about their questionable recognition of Bonvoy status and saw the bad reviews on this sub, so I cancelled. The sub then led me to El Cid thanks to the wonderful Google Sheets of prices and ratings, so figured I should pay it forward to the community with this report.

For context - I didn't grow up in a beach vacation family. My father was an airline employee (as am I) - we always vacationed in foreign cities on other continents. When I was 11 we went to the Sandos Caracol Eco Resort and were pretty underwhelmed. The room was disappointing, food was bad, a la carte limited to 2x a week, etc. Last year I spent one night at Playa Escondida (an hour from Puerto Vallarta, the resort where they film Bachelor in Paradise), and that was incredibly lovely but not all-inclusive. I was really hoping El Cid could be the best of both worlds - and I'm happy to share that it surpassed my expectations!

Marina El Cid is theoretically a complex of three resorts - Hotel Marina, Ventus, and Ventus Ha (in the order the expansions were built). For all intents and purposes, it is one resort with three themed sections. There is no distinction or privilege granted to anyone based on the resort you book at, and the operations of the resort are planned as one with the expectation the guests will move between sections. This is not ""having access"" to a sister resort like some of the Riu properties do - everyone is truly a guest of all three at the same time.

**Booking/Prices (10/10):**

I booked this two night, one adult stay through an OTA on May 4th for check in on May 8th. The total cost was $393 after taxes and on-property fees, so $196/night for a ""Junior Suite"" in the Marina section. Ventus would have been a $30 upcharge and Ventus Ha around $80. There were some cheaper options out there, but the Royalton was going to be more expensive at $206 and Planet Hollywood was at $360, so this was on the low end. I believe the direct rate was going for $350/night, but I couldn't see any benefit in booking direct vs an OTA since there was no status or loyalty perks. It was also available for 20,000/night Wyndham Points, which seemed like a steal if not for that I would have needed to transfer them 1:1 from Amex MR, which wouldn't be a good value vs transferring those to an airline. All the other hotel chains were wanting min 60,000 points/night for their affiliated AIs.

The hotel did confirm my reservation by email, and the concierge made my two dinner reservations ahead of time as well, which was appreciated.

**Logistics (9/10):**

I rented a car from Avis and drove from CUN to the resort. This cost $52 vs the lowest shared shuttle price I could find that would have been $75 and the hotel arranged shuttle of $110. The self-drive took 25 minutes and was a complete non issue. Immigration at CUN took seconds with the e-gates, not sure why everyone was waiting like sheep for 30 mins to be processed by an officer... Avis politely greeted me inside the secure customs area, escorted me through the touts/timeshare people to a waiting van, 5 minute drive to the lot, and including immigration/customs/drive, I had the car out of the lot 20 minutes after we touched down. This seems like a no-brainer to me - I'm not sure why so many people do shuttles? The resort security seemed quite confused by a single person arriving alone in a car, but a bit of Spanish radio calls later, they had me drive up to the check-in, took my bag, and had me park in the lot back down the hill. Also, people kept asking if I was joining anyone or if anyone was coming later - I guess people don't come to these places solo?

**Check-in (6/10):**

There were two agents behind the desk that were doing a lengthy check-in process with two families. I was mildly frustrated that none of the other staff (probably 6 people at the ""information desks"") acknowledged me while I was standing, nor asked me to sit down until they could check-me in. Eventually it was my turn. There was a mild attempt to upsell to a nicer room and/or the ""Platinum Club"" status - had I wanted that, it would have been a good time to negotiate, but I politely declined and we moved on quicky. The check-in agent then instructed me to go to the ""information desks"" for ""an overview of the property"". This is clearly supposed to be where they get you to come to the timeshare meeting, but as a solo 22M, I'm obviously not a target. As such, the people at the desk pretty much ignored me, and when I finally asked them to give me the overview of the property that had been offered by the check-in agent, they once again started by asking if I was traveling with anyone else. Then there was an awkward 2 minutes while one of them gave me a map and list of the dining facilities/hours/menu links. My room also wasn't going to be ready until 3, even though it was 2:30 at this point, so they told me to have lunch and come back. This was probably the lowest part of my El Cid experience, but I was expecting it, and it certainly could have been worse.

**Room (9.5/10):**

I was assigned a room on the 3rd floor of Building 19 (19308) in the Marina section. Despite being apparently the lowest room class, it had a perfectly nice view- looking onto trees and a pond in the foreground, the main pool in the midground, and the ocean decently visible in the background. Most importantly, there was clearly thought placed into ensuring the rooms all had a pleasant view. Obviously only some can have unobstructed ocean vistas, but you're certainly not going to be looking into an ugly jungle or a service area. The rooms of Marina and Ventus all physically face the ocean (might just be in the background through two buildings or past the pool area), and Ventus Ha's all face an attractive pool/garden, with basically an endless unobstructed view over the mangroves in the background. This is because facing the ocean would require looking over the service areas of Marina and Ventus, so it was designed to be attractive facing inland.

My ""junior suite"" was spacious, clean, and well appointed. The shower in particular was very nice, and the main bed was very comfortable. Balcony was large with chairs and a coffee table. There was also a murphy bed, concealed behind a couch. The murphy bed was not comfortable - I would recommend asking for a true double room (vs the junior suite) if you intend to use both beds. There was a connecting door, but I couldn't hear anything from the next room. The rooms in Ventus Ha (and Ventus to an extent) are apparently more stylish, but Marina was still completely fine.

**Resort Facilities (9.5/10):**

Whether you see it as truly three resorts or one big one, it's undeniable that El Cid has a phenomenal physical presence. The campus is somewhat spread out, but that allows for a lot of different vibes and themes to co-exist without interfering.

Ventus Ha has two gorgeous adults only infinity pool rooftop bars, full of daybeds and couches, and then two main pools on the ground, each with a large whirlpool. Super quiet and always relaxing. Ventus has the stereotypical curvy main pool with the bridges and chairs in the water, as well as an ocean view infinity pool with two whirlpools that is adults only. Some of the rooms had a semi-private pool in front of their balconies. This pool did have more adult themed activities throughout the day. Marina's main pool is great for activities and kids and also has a good swim-up bar. The kids enjoyed the waterslide and ""cliff jump"", which are built into a rock formation that gives the space a more jungle-y feel. There's also a family infinity pool and whirlpool overlooking the ocean.

All three of the resorts had very nice, comfortable lobbies with evening entertainment and an attached bar/lounge. There were gardens and ponds and flowers everywhere, every morning I saw them landscaping and cleaning. In general the facilities were very well maintained and clean, it's clear they have very high standards for this. Ventus Ha and Marina both had great fitness centers, if you're looking to work off everything you eat.

There actually is a functioning Marina, which is located off to the side of the resort, and this is sort of it's own section, with the dolphin encounter area, seafood restaurant, and the boats. Really nice little walk to see something different.

Sadly the beach is basically non-existent at this point between the rising sea levels, hurricanes, erosion, and seaweed. You're just looking at nets and sandbags anyways, it's dirty, smells (although could be much worse - they are good at removing the seaweed), and just isn't enjoyable. Nonetheless, they do the best they can, there are chairs, etc, and if you really want to do something in the water, it is possible. I can't blame them for this situation because it is impacting basically all of Cancun. If you want beaches, this just isn't the region to visit.

**Food (8/10):**

There are many reviews of all inclusive resorts that say the food is awful or inedible - this is 100% not the case at El Cid. Some dishes were certainly better than others, but on the whole, the food was good and met my expectations. Most importantly, the three a la carte restaurants I dined at: A'kat (lunch), Ile de France, and Kobo (teppanyaki), were very high quality experiences and there was no restriction on how often you could make reservations. Specialty coffee beverages were available throughout the resort at all times of day/evening. The breakfast and lunch buffets had ample options, including freshly prepared stations. Apparently the peak a la carte times go to the timeshare owners and Platinum Club, so just be prepared to eat at the a la cartes later in the evening and have a late lunch. The only straight up unacceptable food that I had was the room service breakfast - it was dry, tasted weird, and was just inedible. However, the room service pasta I ordered for dinner was much better, so perhaps it was just the breakfast selections.

**Drinks (4/10):**

The alcoholic drinks were actually my least favorite part of this experience. I am a big mixed drink fan, and was looking forward to having tropical cocktails, etc. The bartenders were great, and made everything I asked for without hesitation - never had to wait. Sadly, every drink I ordered was ruined by artificial sweeteners in the mixers. They all just had a bad aftertaste, and it ruined the flavor to the point where I couldn't get myself to finish drinks. Everything basically just tasted like Splenda, no matter what I ordered. Fortunately I wasn't intending to drink all that much, so it wasn't a huge loss, but this would have really frustrated me if I was. On the bright side, they had some incredible juices and aqua frescas available at the buffets.

**Service (10/10):**

The staff were completely incredible and provided great service at every interaction. I never had to wait for service at a bar, etc. They had sufficient staff for everything. The staff were polite and fast at everything. The buffets were always seated experiences with drink waiters, assigned tables, place settings, etc. Every dining experience started with me being asked if I had any allergies or dietary restrictions. The housekeeping was phenomenal - perfectly clean room, and they basically would keep coming back unless you put up the DND sign. Every pool area was full service with a bar and towels. The beach towels were high quality - presented rolled up and folded. Drinks were served in the pool, even if you ordered at a bar, and the bartenders would walk around offering drinks if they weren't busy. Bell Services was incredibly polite and helpful, they had golf carts and would drive people between the resorts/restaurants without question. There was very much a gratuity culture, so bring small bills and basically just be ready to give $1 or $2 for every service - see it as the ""cost"" of the free thing you're getting. But they work hard and well, so this was very easy to do - plus there's no ""automatic gratuity"" scam like on a cruise line that you're already paying.

**Vibes/Clientele (10/10):**

This was the perfect resort if you're looking to have \*relaxing fun\*. It's not snobby, not wild, not crazy, not only romantic, not only for families, not stuffy. There are activities for kids, and activities for adults, and space/time for no activities at all. Bars were open until 1am, but the rest of the resort was silent, and it was clear that revelry/partying/inappropriate behavior was unacceptable. The other guests were considerate and polite and reasonable, except for one ""karen"" who chewed out the omelette station chef for forgetting she asked for egg-whites (when making 6 custom omelettes at a time). Very diverse representation of nationalities and ages too - you'll certainly fit in no matter what you look like.

**Activities (8/10):**

Each night has a designated ""evening activity"" on the lawn near the convention center - my first night was a super fun ""street taco festival"" (great authentic-style, not tex-mex tacos) and the second night was basically a knock-off of Fantasia that would make Disney's lawyers quite upset. There was also a whole schedule for activities in the Marina (kids) and Ventus (adults) pool areas, with the Ventus Ha pools purposely being activity free. Biking excursions to Puerto Morelos were offered both in the morning and afternoon, with the former purporting to be more ""cultural"" tour, and the latter being a quick trip to the pharmacy, gift shops and supermarket. The morning tour was not remotely scenic, but it nonetheless was a real exposure to the local culture and I appreciated that they offered these little trips - plus you could buy things like sunscreen at market prices, or stock up on snacks/drinks. The kids and teen clubs also had schedules of events, which seemed to be enjoyed by the participants.

**Overall Thoughts/Conclusion (9/10):**

I'd 100% return to Marina El Cid, and would recommend it to basically anyone not looking to party like a Riu. It represented an incredible experience for a very reasonable cost, and was the perfect getaway that I needed. There's a few things that they could do better, and I really wish the drinks didn't have fake sweeteners, but it represented a great improvement over the Sandos I had been to as a kid, and turned out to be such a better fit for my needs than the Royalton. This place doesn't get nearly the attention it deserves, and should be higher up on the radar of those seeking a great value experience.",3,1746990474.0,AllInclusiveResorts,1,1.0,False

Here is a [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nbmhwPzD20) that hopefully sparks your imagination, click for the [game description](https://karottenrambo.github.io/PocketPlanetNotes/Pocket%20Planet/PublishedPages/Pocket%20Planet%20Survival%20Description.html)

The video is a bit outdated, meanwhile resource management, buildings and agents with basic combat are working.

After my first(commercially unsuccessful) [full project](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1if0jci/4_years_4000k_hours_800/), I want to address the most important question first, is it marketable?

The game is build around its unique, the hollow planet concept with seamless in/out transitions, its something novel and also easy to sell on a short clip. Tower defense on a sphere is a innovation in the genre while building on established core gameplay loops. The controls are casual and approachable, while the incremental aspect combines longterm motivation with basically infinite progression.

I am convinced about the projects potential, I will carry it to the finish line no matter what. But I am also aware that I have a bit of a blind eye on the art side and will not achieve the level of quality that is needed to survive on a highly competitive market. Due to real life responsibilities, I can invest roughly 15 hours a week into the project. So the next logical step is, to find developers with similar ambitions and create something bigger together!

This is the [Contract](https://karottenrambo.github.io/PocketPlanetNotes/Pocket%20Planet/PublishedPages/Revshare%20Contract.html) I'm planning to use and ofc I'm willing to discuss details.

This revenue share model is surely not everyone's cup of coffee, but it offers several advantages if you believe the concept and find some trust in me :)

Who am i looking for? Here are the planned [development Milestones](https://karottenrambo.github.io/PocketPlanetNotes/Pocket%20Planet/PublishedPages/Development%20Milestones.html). At this point of development, (gameplay beta) I only need other unity developers. Experience with unity ECS/DOTS is pretty much a requirement, the learning curve is quite steep and it cannot be picked up within a weekend.

When the gameplay beta is ready, and some technical evaluations are done, I would also need and art director who can create low poly models and animations.

When the general setting/artstyle is set, other roles like video editor, marketing specialist would be open - but at this point, there will be an new post in INAT.

  So..I'm posting this as therapy for myself.  If someone is offended, I apologize. However, I'd like you to see just how low someone can go.  And if that's indeed a bad thing.

  How low? Drinking coffee out of a plastic peanut butter jar because my money hadn't touched down yet.  Getting bullied by corrections officers who project their anger onto us.  It's easy to do. Very easy.  Noone cares about prisoners.  Understandably so...I get it.  

   Living in a cube with 7 other men. 7 other dudes who are loud and don't understand the idea of privacy.  Being afraid to fart because some career criminal will complain and act as if you disrespected him.  One of my roommates was a gangster from inner city Detroit, Michigan who was serving a life sentence for a murder he commmited 30 plus years ago. This man obviously had nothing to lose...and so his anger and hatred was put on me. Every little thing he complained about.  Imagine waking up in the middle of the night to read because you couldn't sleep and having him accuse me of looking at him in the mirror and wanting to fight. 
  
This tendency towards aggression is common.  Some people walk around angry..looking for the slightest target to project upon.  I myself was that target many times. Many many. And there is no talking them out of it. 

Von Franz said that being put in a situation where there was no good outcome would allow the Self to manifest. Many times i had the feeling of powerlessness.  Even if I won in a fight...if he was gang affiliated than I would face repercussions from the gang.  Either way, either direction..no matter what...I was smothered. 
  
 My body was put in fight or flight.  I was already diagnosed bipolar when I went in..can you imagine that plus the added bullshit of the prison environment ? I'm not a career criminal.  Had never spent a day in jail before this happened.  Although my gambling habit did lead me down the same path as these people.  I quit. I'm done gambling.  Thank God.
 
There are many inconveniences in prison. There is no soft spot. The beds are uncomfortable..there is nothing that smells good. Noone smiles. Even the employees of the prison don't believe you.  I waited for 2 months to see a psychiatrist because I couldn't sleep and when I met the man he wouldn't give me any medication.  We could claim negligence...but again..who is going to believe a prisoner ? There is zero oversight. Same thing with the subpar nutrition they give us. Who really  cares? Noone.

 You know what though? I'm off probation. I completed my sentence.  And...I would never take back any of the experiences I went through.  No amount of money could get me to turn my back on the experiences which shaped me. Full confidence. 
  
  I've seen and experienced a lot.  I've grown very close to my Self..and I know that no matter what..my Self will never turn it's back on me. No matter how hard it gets. 


I've seen and experienced reality in a way that people question.  People doubt me when I say that the me who robbed the bank isn't the real me. The person who I think of as myself is an extension of the unconscious mind also known as what I like to call the light or primordial experience. 

This light is nothing but love.  It's existed for thousands of lifetimes. It's seen, heard, and already experienced everything there is to experience.  My idea of time and space is nothing to this entity.  I exist both here and now and also in the future and past. The only thing I could do to disrupt it's love is to turn my back on my own conscience. As Jesus said, denying the holy spirit is the only sin.  Denying yourself at the expense of what you know...meaning what you've experienced and what you've collected..is the only shortcoming.
  
 There is no good.  There is no bad. The two opposites are defined by each other and society influences them.  I know this is my last incarnation and as such I have no children or mate. I am coming home.

What that might look like ? I don't know.  But...my tendency as a rule breaker from an early age has been revealed to me as a strength.  Not a weakness.

If you are targeting ecom running cold outreach or just trying to build lead lists, you know how difficult (and expensive) it can get when you are looking for leads. I used to pay around $950 a month for unlimited access to store lead data but I was always stuck with limitations and proxies which is not ideal



Fast forward to now I have been using Scrapeamax and it completely changes the game. I am getting unlimited leads from platforms like Shopify, WooCommerce and others all for less than your coffee budget (Yeah its that affordable)



Whats awesome about this is that it is UNLIMITED, doesnt require proxies, no credit system and you can get super specific with your lead targeting



Let me break it down for you:



Target any ecom store: Apparel, sports, tech whatever industry you're interested in



Filter by country: Want US based stores? no problem you can scrape leads from any country



Revenue filtering: You can even filter stores based on how much they are making like 50K, 100K, 500K+ in revenue



Easy exports: Get all your leads in seconds, straight into a CSV file with all the details you need (company name, location, website, social media links, etc)



For example I have scraped 300,000 leads in just a few minutes and the list was packed with actionable data and all this for way less than what I was paying for other scraping services



Not only that but if you are in the cold outreach game this is gold. I have had better responses simply because I can scrape high intent leads directly from ecom stores that match my ideal customer profile



How to get started:



Just head over to Scrapeamax(.)com or hit me up if you want more info. You can get a feel for whats possible before committing. I have used it for a few months now and its been a game changer



Feel free to ask questions if you are curious and I have been using this system for a while now so happy to help anyone out who wants to save time and money while building quality lead lists",0,1746990404.0,SaaS,4,0.5,False

[Bambino plus/Philos],"I am new to the espresso scene and personally don't drink coffee myself, but want to be able to pull good shots for my wife, who drinks maybe 3-5 per day. I'm using a Bambino plus with a philos grinder which both arrived just in time for Mother's day. I've been measuring out 16g of beans and grinding so far anywhere from 17-21 on the grinder scale. I started out at 17, did some MDT, and tamped with what I thought was appropriate pressure (not more than 20 lbs), but the water never ended up coming through the portafilter and at the end of the attempted pull, there was a slight pop and all the fluid came out the bottom of the machine into the tray.

I thought I ground too fine and maybe tamped too hard so I tried again at 21, but had the same result. I found a bag of old beans lying around so I didn't feel too bad about wasting all the pulls, but I ended up varying pressures and grinds anywhere between 17-21 on the scale. I also used the both the pressurized and non pressurized baskets that came with the Bambino. About half the time I'd say not a drip came out from he portafilter, but then the other half ranged anywhere from a few drips to what I'd expect (~30 mL). The results didn't seem to match with grind size, ie sometimes a 21 yielded no pull. 

Am I just putting way too much pressure tamping, or should I be grinding at a much higher number? The few that produced an adequate volume seemed a bit sour to the wife so I thought it might still be a bit too coarse. ",1,1746990127.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

<Role_and_Objectives>
You are The Sacred Return Guide, a compassionate and wise self-love strategist specializing in helping people rebuild their sense of worth, identity, and joy after devastating heartbreak. Your purpose is not to offer quick fixes or toxic positivity, but to guide users through a transformative journey back to their authentic selves. You combine emotional intelligence, psychological understanding, and practical wisdom to help users reconnect with their inherent worthiness.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Instructions>
Navigate each interaction with deep empathy while maintaining healthy boundaries. Your approach should blend:

1. VALIDATION: Acknowledge the user's pain without judgment, normalizing their experience while gently redirecting from rumination to reflection.

2. EXCAVATION: Help users distinguish between authentic pain and conditioned unworthiness by asking thoughtful questions about their beliefs about themselves before, during, and after the relationship.

3. RECLAMATION RITUALS: Offer personalized daily practices based on their specific struggles (identity loss, validation-seeking, physical disconnection, etc.) that help rebuild self-trust and inner connection.

4. PATTERN RECOGNITION: Identify core wounds and relationship patterns with curiosity rather than criticism, helping users see how these patterns served them and how they can evolve beyond them.

5. EMBODIMENT PRACTICES: Suggest grounding techniques to help users reconnect with their physical bodies, especially when feeling disembodied by grief or anxiety.

6. BOUNDARY REINFORCEMENT: Guide users in establishing healthy boundaries with themselves, their ex, and others during this vulnerable time.

Always focus on inner redemption rather than external validation or ""getting back"" at an ex. Your goal is to help them build something more beautiful than what was lost.
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
When working with a heartbroken user:
1. First assess where they are in their healing journey without assuming their emotional state
2. Identify whether they need immediate comfort or are ready for deeper work
3. Determine which aspect of self they're struggling to reclaim (worth, identity, joy, trust, etc.)
4. Consider their unique situation, personality, and needs before offering guidance
5. Suggest practices that meet them where they are while gently stretching their comfort zone
6. Provide balance between emotional processing and forward movement
7. Always respect their pace and readiness for different aspects of healing
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
- Never suggest reaching out to an ex or checking their social media
- Avoid clichés like ""time heals all wounds"" or ""everything happens for a reason""
- Don't position finding a new relationship as the solution to heartbreak
- Never compare their situation to others or minimize their experience
- Refrain from making promises about timeline for healing
- Don't suggest unhealthy coping mechanisms like isolation, revenge, or numbing
- Never encourage codependent patterns or external validation-seeking
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
For each interaction, structure your responses with:

1. ACKNOWLEDGMENT: A brief, genuine validation of their feelings
2. INSIGHT: A thoughtful perspective that helps reframe their experience
3. PRACTICE: A specific, actionable ritual or exercise they can try 
4. REFLECTION: A gentle question to deepen their awareness
5. AFFIRMATION: A powerful truth to carry with them

Use warm, compassionate language that honors both their pain and their potential. Avoid clinical or overly spiritual terminology. Speak to them as a wise friend would.
</Output_Format>

<Context>
When supporting someone through heartbreak, recognize that beneath the immediate pain of rejection often lie deeper wounds related to childhood attachment, societal conditioning, and past experiences. Your guidance should address both the current heartbreak and these underlying patterns.

Remember that self-worth reconstruction is not linear. Users may have days of profound empowerment followed by emotional regression. Meet them with the same compassion regardless of where they are in the process.

Your ultimate goal is to help them emerge not just ""healed"" but transformed—with greater self-knowledge, healthier relationship patterns, and a stronger connection to their inherent worthiness that isn't dependent on anyone else's validation.
</Context>

<User_Input>
Reply with: ""Please share what you're experiencing after your breakup, and I'll help guide you through your sacred return to self,"" then wait for the user to share their specific situation and feelings.

**Use Cases:**

1. Guiding someone through the initial shock and pain after an unexpected breakup
2. Helping rebuild identity and boundaries after leaving a codependent relationship
3. Supporting someone in rediscovering joy, passion, and creativity that was diminished during their relationship

**Example User Input:**

""I feel completely worthless since my partner left me for someone else two weeks ago. We were together for 3 years and now I don't even know who I am anymore. I can't stop comparing myself to the new person and wondering what's wrong with me.""

If you feel like relapsing. Don’t negotiate with your alcoholic brain… it will always win. Choose sobriety every time. The shame I feel for my relapse is not worse than the shame I felt at my first meeting. 

On the subject of alcohol “it’s just not for us”. We can still chat, still chill, still contribute, still have a coffee. Please think 100000 times before relapsing after a good period of sobriety.

So I made a post yesterday about wanting to be productive on Saturday that ended up not going to plan spectacularly. Today was better. Woke up at around 10 though and went outside the front yard and just sat on the grass with coffee on me. Damn that sunlight burns good on the skin. It was a crisp temperature with cold air too.

I was able to upgrade my phone for significantly cheaper because of a Mother's Day sale and lowered my phone plan saving me like $50 which is huge.

I also got to work out today too which is good. Did like 5 or 6 workouts on my shoulders, chest, and back but man I got weaker. Form is also not as good anymore and I cant feel my chest activations. I did cardio as well but only lasted 5 minutes because I legit started to feel bad chest pain and was about to throw up.

I left and bought a boquet for my mother now too for Mother's Day. Will just take a showet and meet her in an hour or so. I'm just still feeling sick from the workout.

I want to feel that joy and satisfaction of doing better than I did the last 6 days but my brain just isn't registering the wins. I just want a small feeling of joy because I feel like I did good today. 

Anyway I hope you guys are having a good day so far.",1,1746989664.0,Adulting,1,1.0,False

1. VALIDATION: Acknowledge the user's pain without judgment, normalizing their experience while gently redirecting from rumination to reflection.

2. EXCAVATION: Help users distinguish between authentic pain and conditioned unworthiness by asking thoughtful questions about their beliefs about themselves before, during, and after the relationship.

3. RECLAMATION RITUALS: Offer personalized daily practices based on their specific struggles (identity loss, validation-seeking, physical disconnection, etc.) that help rebuild self-trust and inner connection.

4. PATTERN RECOGNITION: Identify core wounds and relationship patterns with curiosity rather than criticism, helping users see how these patterns served them and how they can evolve beyond them.

5. EMBODIMENT PRACTICES: Suggest grounding techniques to help users reconnect with their physical bodies, especially when feeling disembodied by grief or anxiety.

6. BOUNDARY REINFORCEMENT: Guide users in establishing healthy boundaries with themselves, their ex, and others during this vulnerable time.

Always focus on inner redemption rather than external validation or ""getting back"" at an ex. Your goal is to help them build something more beautiful than what was lost.
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
When working with a heartbroken user:
1. First assess where they are in their healing journey without assuming their emotional state
2. Identify whether they need immediate comfort or are ready for deeper work
3. Determine which aspect of self they're struggling to reclaim (worth, identity, joy, trust, etc.)
4. Consider their unique situation, personality, and needs before offering guidance
5. Suggest practices that meet them where they are while gently stretching their comfort zone
6. Provide balance between emotional processing and forward movement
7. Always respect their pace and readiness for different aspects of healing
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
- Never suggest reaching out to an ex or checking their social media
- Avoid clichés like ""time heals all wounds"" or ""everything happens for a reason""
- Don't position finding a new relationship as the solution to heartbreak
- Never compare their situation to others or minimize their experience
- Refrain from making promises about timeline for healing
- Don't suggest unhealthy coping mechanisms like isolation, revenge, or numbing
- Never encourage codependent patterns or external validation-seeking
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
For each interaction, structure your responses with:

1. ACKNOWLEDGMENT: A brief, genuine validation of their feelings
2. INSIGHT: A thoughtful perspective that helps reframe their experience
3. PRACTICE: A specific, actionable ritual or exercise they can try 
4. REFLECTION: A gentle question to deepen their awareness
5. AFFIRMATION: A powerful truth to carry with them

Use warm, compassionate language that honors both their pain and their potential. Avoid clinical or overly spiritual terminology. Speak to them as a wise friend would.
</Output_Format>

<Context>
When supporting someone through heartbreak, recognize that beneath the immediate pain of rejection often lie deeper wounds related to childhood attachment, societal conditioning, and past experiences. Your guidance should address both the current heartbreak and these underlying patterns.

Remember that self-worth reconstruction is not linear. Users may have days of profound empowerment followed by emotional regression. Meet them with the same compassion regardless of where they are in the process.

Your ultimate goal is to help them emerge not just ""healed"" but transformed—with greater self-knowledge, healthier relationship patterns, and a stronger connection to their inherent worthiness that isn't dependent on anyone else's validation.
</Context>

<User_Input>
Reply with: ""Please share what you're experiencing after your breakup, and I'll help guide you through your sacred return to self,"" then wait for the user to share their specific situation and feelings.
</User_Input>
```

**Use Cases:**

1. Guiding someone through the initial shock and pain after an unexpected breakup
2. Helping rebuild identity and boundaries after leaving a codependent relationship
3. Supporting someone in rediscovering joy, passion, and creativity that was diminished during their relationship

**Example User Input:**

""I feel completely worthless since my partner left me for someone else two weeks ago. We were together for 3 years and now I don't even know who I am anymore. I can't stop comparing myself to the new person and wondering what's wrong with me.""

The last time I read it was in March of this year and it was suppose to be an ongoing story. I just checked today and it was yeetus deletus. :”D 

I don’t remember the story name nor the author’s name but I have some excerpts that I took while reading because the paragraphs were just that good!! Here are the excerpts: 

1) So why, if he didn't care about you at all, did he show up to the park you wanted to go to after school? Why did he stay sitting at the swing set for hours, waiting for you to come by like you had planned to do? Why did he have to fight back the foreign and downright disgusting sensation of tears when it started to get dark, and it was evident you wouldn’t be coming with your stupid butler you called Mister?

2) The more recent months have been harder when the man shows up. First, he leaves a stack of cash sitting on the coffee table for Scaramouche to pay for basic necessities and other bills in order to live comfortably. Then, he’d ask briefly of Scaramouche’s academics. Then, usually, he’d leave. Not anymore. Things would happen in that same sequence, but now, the man drags Scaramouche out of the apartment and into the dangerous neighborhood he lived in. The man would beat Scaramouche until the boy could no longer get up, shouting at him to fight like a man, and that he was going easy on him. That Scaramouche had to be strong if he wanted to survive. And, when Scaramouche limped his way through the darkness back to his apartment, blood dripping from his nose, his mind seemed to drift back to you. He wondered how you’d react if you saw him in such a state. He knew you, that you’d immediately fret over him, maybe even cry with worry as you tried to help him. God, he hated you. You shouldn’t care about someone like him.

I moved out of my house and I bought a 12-cup moka pot since my gf and I like coffee quite a lot.

I've been trying everything with it and I never get it to flow with no sputtering. New filters, different heat configs (lower than medium, and higher), not pre-boiling water, different coffe, different size stoves (all bigger than the pot), a heat plate for induction, and I've even bought a new one thinking the pot was just not good. Nothing works, old and new pot always sputters from the begining and never extracts the whole thing.

Brought my 6-cup pot from my parent's house and it works perfect every single time. Medium heat, all smooth, I can turn off the stove once it flows and it gets to the bubbling end where I can just pour some cold tap water onto the pot.

Any ideas why it's not working? Am I missing some specific procedure for bigger coffe pots?

P.S. My two mokkas are Monix and Magefesa. The old 6-cup one it's an even cheaper non-branded version. I was considering to invest on a beter brand but I see it pointless unless I can manage to get a correct extraction.",2,1746989258.0,mokapot,4,1.0,False

Making and baking a tart during an early heatwave in an old house without air conditioning  is … interesting. And I can only imagine what the GBBO contestants feel like in that tent sometimes. The baking deities must have taken mercy on me this week because the curd behaved beautifully in the tempering process and my first attempt at a glossy meringue was surprisingly successful.  I ended up opting for a shortbread style crust so I wouldn’t have to fuss with a dough that required cold butter. I had seen a cute tart decorated in the fashion of a crescent moon, so I adapted that to my skill level and the actual phase of the moon today, a gibbous. 🌔

1kk7z2w,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1kk7z2w/does_breville_bambino_plus_espresso_machine_live/,Does Breville Bambino Plus espresso machine live up to its hype review?,"The Breville BES500BSS Brushed Stainless Steel Espresso Machine, known as the Bambino Plus, has quickly become a daily companion in my kitchen. I’ve been experimenting with it for a few weeks now, and while it certainly delivers on the promise of a luxurious espresso experience, there are a few quirks worth mentioning. As someone who relishes a good latte every morning, I’ve had the opportunity to poke around its features, test its limits, and even let my coffee-loving friends weigh in on its performance.

**Compact and Practical Design**  
The first thing that caught my attention was how conveniently compact this espresso machine is. It fits snugly under my cabinets and barely takes up counter space, which is a big win for someone with a small kitchen. It’s sturdy but not overly bulky, and the brushed stainless steel finish is sleek and easy to clean. My neighbor, who has a similar coffee maker, complimented the design and couldn’t believe it was this good-looking at its size.

**Perks of Automated Milk Texturing**  
With the automatic milk texturing feature, my mornings have become a whole lot easier. I love the velvety foam it produces, especially when I’m in a rush. Adjusting the temperature and foam levels involves nothing more than pressing a button. Whether I’m crafting my perfect latte or just frothing hot milk for the kids’ hot chocolate, the result has been consistently delightful. A quick tip: don’t overfill the milk jug or you’ll end up with a bit of a spill, as I embarrassingly discovered the hard way.

[Check Breville BES500BSS price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b07jh9crbz/)

**Upsides**  
- Compact design fits effortlessly into small kitchen spaces.  
- Automatic milk frother requires minimal effort while producing impeccable results.  
- User-friendly interface makes it beginner-friendly without compromising functionality.  

**Challenges with the Build Quality**  
Although the aesthetics and design are admirable, I noticed the machine feels a bit less solid than I initially hoped. Locking in the brew handle requires some effort, and the plastic components occasionally seem less durable than expected for this range. A friend warned me this might reduce the product’s longevity, especially with daily use. While mine is holding up so far, it’s something I’m keeping an eye on.

**Pitfalls**  
- Brew handle requires significant force to secure, raising durability concerns.  
- Some plastic parts might not withstand heavy, long-term use.  

**Performance and Coffee Quality**  
Once I got used to its quirks, the Bambino Plus delivered exceptional espresso. The customizable settings for shot volume, milk texture, and temperature allowed me to experiment until I identified the perfect combination for my taste buds. The coffee is rich and fragrant, easily rivaling my favorite café's offerings. This sentiment was echoed by my coworker, who came over for coffee and kept gushing about the quality. However, be cautious when it comes to maintenance; ensuring clean components after every use is essential for keeping the taste consistent.

**Competing Brands**  
To put things into perspective, I compared this machine to the De’Longhi Dedica and the Gaggia Classic. The De’Longhi Dedica came close with a similar compact build but fell short in the milk frothing department—it lacked the automated texturing capability of the Bambino Plus. On the other hand, the Gaggia Classic offered a sturdier build but required significantly more barista-level skills, which ruled it out for the average user. For me, the Bambino Plus struck the right balance between ease of use and professional results.

**Smart Spending**  
Considering its feature set, the machine provides decent value for its price. It’s more accessible than high-end machines that require a deep learning curve, and the coffee output justifies the investment. As someone who frequented coffee shops before this purchase, it’s already paid for itself in saved cappuccinos. For coffee enthusiasts who care about quality but don’t want to tinker endlessly, this could be a smart option.

1kk7x4f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hyperhidrosis/comments/1kk7x4f/confusion_whether_hyperhidrosis_is_key_component/,Confusion whether Hyperhidrosis is key component for my suffering,"Hello there, 

I'm currently having trouble finding out if hyperhidrosis is the main diagnose, or whether I suffer from it at all. First of all: I have been undergoing a testing for hyperhidrosis at a dermatological place that basically included me being put in a cold room, shirtless, for about 20 minutes with some type of coffee-filter under my armpits. Since there was no sweating going on and while my symptoms only appear in summer, those people would put a diagnose to rest. Recently, my actual dermatologist confessed to me this was not a very reliable, or modern way of testing. My understanding has been that once you only sweat due to exterieur factors as like in heat in summer, you're not a patient. 

Now for the conflicting part: I'm suffering from asthma (apparently \~70% lung capacity), I have chronic neurodermatitis that usually forces me use skin lotion which, as a consequence, aggravates any symptoms of sweating. Also symptoms of social anxiety might play into that (anxiety of and from sweating) so it's a bit of an unclear situation.

I have always been sweating more than normal people and it's due genetics from my mother's side. I start sweating at talking a walk for a while or ride a bike at mayb e25 degree celsius and I live in one of the hottest areas in Germany. There are times the sun makes me sweat whereas I'm not even super active in sports like walking so I don't suspect the asthmatic exhaustion takes a huge part in that conglomerate. I remember taking classes at university where I missed about the whole lesson and ended up going to the bath at just a few minute routine. It the summer is especially hot, I'm having several months a year of me trying to just survive, there's no way I could opt for any regular job at this point. Forehead and neck parts are most concerning, my upper body starts to itch like thousands of miniature electro-shocks hit, my body takes way too much time to adapt to temperature changes and the funny thing is, whenever my body is in the rush, I can literally pinpoint the second my body hits that zenith and is ready to cool down and things get better unless I'm not directly facing a hot summer's sun. I am just confused.",1,1746988566.0,Hyperhidrosis,0,0.67,False

Alopecia started on my beard in May of 2024 with one patch the size of a dime. Soon after a second patch appeared on the opposite of my face. Both patches grew for 3 months until I decided to get kenalog shots from the dermatologist. Despite the shots, the patches continued to grow for about 8 more months. In February of 25 a new flare up occurred and I had a small patch on the back of my head which I quickly addressed with kenalog shots. Finally I am seeing almost total regrowth in all patches. My protocool was as follows:

-Monthly kenalog shots in affected areas with minoxidil starting in Sept of 24 (10 rounds of shots to date)
- Opzelura 1x day on effected areas beginning in December as spots continued to grow
-March ‘25 continued the above medications but completely revamped my diet which I belive finally brought down the inflammation. I did the following:
   strictly limit gluten and dairy 
   Eat lean protein, healthy fats, and gluten free carbs. Absolutely no processed foods.
   reduced coffee in take to 2x weekly
   Track macros to ensure balanced diet
   Took krill oil, ashgwanda, Allegra, green tea    extract, magnesium, vitamin D, CoQ-10
Gut healing protocol (berberine + candibactin AR) and glutagenics powder for 2 months followed by probiotic (on going) for 3 months 
Focused on quality sleep every night. Tracked with whoop

I was hopeless for many months after receiving injection after injection with no real progress but finally I have seen some good results once I changed my diet. Praying I keep this regrowth now with continued focus on healthy lifestyle.

I wish you all the best in your journey with this. I know how mentally challenging it can be. There is hope. While we can’t control the disease we can control our lifestyles and I found that focusing on an anti inflammatory life cycle helped me mentally through all of this.

Make sure you apply because this is her best book yet, and I know everyone is going to love Lane and Olive!

*~*~*~*~*

BLURB:

Hearts live by being wounded… but sometimes those wounds run deeper than the surface.

Olive Finch should be in the prime of her life at twenty-three. But after shutting herself off from everything and everyone for six years, she’s only just starting out. Trying to find her path, she starts teaching ballet lessons at her mother’s studio. It’s there she meets her student Sage, daughter of Lane Brooks, center fielder for the New York Stars.

Lane has never taken life too seriously… that is, until he finds out he got his one-night stand pregnant. As a single dad, he always puts his daughter first, but at thirty-two, he longs to give Sage a family and find someone to share his life with. After a chance meeting with a beautiful woman at a coffee shop, he’s practically ready to drop to one knee.

When they meet again, it isn’t as strangers. To Lane, it’s fate. And Olive can’t deny how much she enjoys having him around.

But when secrets kept and truths exposed leave them both reeling, it’s clear that trauma has become an unwelcome third wheel. Can they leave their respective pasts behind, or is just being the fielder’s choice not enough?",1,1746988230.0,ARCReaders,0,0.99,False

We went on 4 dates, tried kissing on the second and ever since then she kept rejecting kisses but still talking and texting everyday, we even started saying goodnight to each other. But lately she rejected 3 dates invites and the last one she agreed only to cancel it in the last minute. She then said she is very sorry and she will make up for it by baking a cake or bringing something sweet to work, but never suggested rescheduling. I started pulling back and not texting her anymore, at work only brief conversations, but never looking upset, just busy. She texted me a few times ever since, only work related stuff. Should I have a conversation with her saying I liked the time we spent together and I would like to keep going forward, but if there is no reciprocated effort, it’s not my type of relationship? Or should I just keep pulling away and go with the idea that I might never go out with her again? Her cancelling in the last minute was quite some disrespect, and also dates 2 and 3 weren’t that straightforward to plan. ",0,1746987944.0,dating_advice,11,0.5,False

1kk7o8g,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1kk7o8g/does_whirlpool_wher25_reverse_osmosis_system/,Does Whirlpool WHER25 Reverse Osmosis System Truly Deliver? Comprehensive Review Inside!,"I recently got my hands on the Whirlpool WHER25 Reverse Osmosis Filtration System, and after using it for a while, I figured it was time to share an honest review. You know, there's always that weird taste in unfiltered tap water that sneaks into your morning coffee or the flavor of ice cubes that just doesn't quite hit right. That's where this system stepped in, claiming to solve all my water woes. Spoiler alert: it delivered in many ways, but it’s not without a few quirks.

**Sleek and Space-Saving Design**  
This thing not only works hard but looks good while doing so. The unit itself is relatively compact with dimensions of 12.2 x 4.7 x 13 inches. It fits snugly under my sink without hogging all the cabinet space. Installing it was a bit of a puzzle at first, but the DIY instructions provided made it possible for someone like me—armed with minimal plumbing skills—to get it up and running in under an hour. And yes, the chrome faucet that's included really gives it bonus points for style. It's not just about functionality; it’s also about aesthetics.

**Change Your Filter Without Breaking a Sweat**  
One of my biggest fears when it comes to water filtration systems is the hassle of maintenance. I mean, who wants to struggle with messy, grimy filters or accidentally flood the kitchen, right? The Whirlpool WHER25 employs UltraEase Technology, making filter changes as easy as twist, click, replace. I didn't even have to switch off the water supply, which was a welcome relief. Plus, the EZ-Change indicator light on the system made me feel like a responsible adult—it reminded me when I needed to change the filters. No guesswork required.

[Check Whirlpool WHER25 price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b004s7tak2/)

**Water Quality That Tastes Like Bottled Water**  
The difference in water taste was noticeable immediately. Coffee tasted fresher, and even boiling vegetables seemed to retain more of their natural flavor. According to its specifications, this system reduces a long list of contaminants: lead, arsenic, dissolved solids, chlorine taste, and a slew of other unpronounceable chemicals. I didn't run a scientific test to confirm this, but just based on taste alone, I could tell the water was leagues better than it was straight from the tap.

**Positives**  
- Compact design leaves plenty of cabinet space free.  
- UltraEase Technology makes filter replacements simple and mess-free.  
- Noticeable improvement in water taste and clarity.  

**Long Filter Life for Less Fuss**  
Another highlight worth mentioning is the extended filter life. The pre-and post-filters lasted about six months, while the membrane held strong for two years. That means fewer trips to the store and fewer dollars spent on replacements. Plus, it feels good knowing this system reduces the need for single-use plastic water bottles—it’s not just a win for me but for the environment too.

**Drawbacks**  
- The initial setup could be tricky for someone who’s never dabbled in household installations.  
- A minor decrease in water pressure, though not deal-breaking.  
- Filters, once due, can feel a bit pricey compared to some generic brands.

**Energy-Free, Hassle-Free Operation**  
You don’t need batteries, external power, or any fancy gadgets for this system to run. It relies purely on water pressure, making it energy-efficient and one less thing to worry about in terms of upkeep. The only trade-off is that there might be a slight dip in water pressure when filling larger containers, like my gallon-sized water bottles. It’s not a big deal for day-to-day use, but it’s worth noting.

**Competitive Options**  
I’ve previously used countertop filtration systems and even a popular pitcher-style filter. While they’re convenient, they don’t match the Whirlpool WHER25 in terms of thorough filtration. Compared to something like the iSpring RCC7, this system takes up less space and has an easier filter replacement process. On the flip side, systems like APEC’s ROES-50 offer a comparable filtration experience but lack some of the convenience features, such as the EZ-Change indicator. The decision boils down to how much ease of use and space-saving ability factor into your priorities.

**Financial Value**  
Looking at what you’re getting and the performance it delivers, the Whirlpool WHER25 feels like smart spending. Its extended filter life and reduced reliance on bottled water justify the upfront cost. While there are cheaper alternatives on the market, their longevity and ease of use don’t quite stack up. This is one of those investments where you get what you pay for: better water, fewer headaches.

He is very thoughtful and I’m grateful that he’s an overall very organized, clean person. However, something that has always bothered me about him is his lack of urgency and need to be meticulous about things that don’t require it. I am a patient person, but I also work in a field that is very go go go so it drives me insane.

For example, I’ll be laying in bed in the morning and he’ll offer to make me a coffee and breakfast. I say sure. I’m thankful for that. I really am. But he’ll get up and it will take about 20 minutes for him to bring me the coffee. We have a Keurig so I don’t really see any reason it would take more than like 5 minutes. Then, he’ll make a very simple breakfast like pancakes (we have store bought mix) and it won’t be ready for 45 minutes after he got up. 

I’m imagining if we had a toddler and that kid needed breakfast. You cannot take nearly an hour to make a simple breakfast. Some days I’ll make pancakes, bacon, AND omelettes and it will take under 30 minutes. 

Then, one time I was exhausted after working 3 doubles in a row. He texted me before I left work that night offering to cook. I said yes please. Make whatever. Doesn’t matter, I’m just starving. Then he texts me back asking me all these specific questions about what I want and I tell him it’s fine. Make whatever. I’m just really hungry and tired and I’ll eat literally anything. He still tries to go back and forth with me about the specifics of what I want. So I’m like ok we can do pasta, we can do sandwiches, we can do chicken and rice. And then I get home and nothing is made and he’s like I just got stressed out and didn’t know what to make you because I wanted you to like it. I crashed out a little and told him that I told him I was hungry, tired and not feeling well. He offered to cook and I stressed to him that I literally did not care what he made. At that point, I was like “it’s fine. I’m just gonna make us dinner.” And he starts apologizing like NO ILL DO IT. IM SORRY. I’m not gonna wait another hour just for you to make us a simple pasta. 

I’ve addressed it in the moment when I get annoyed, but then I feel like a bitch. He constantly tells me he gets overwhelmed because he wants to do everything “right” for me and I stress to him that sometimes I don’t care about perfection, I just want it done if you say you’re going to do it. Otherwise, I’ll just do it myself. 

It’s getting really frustrating because we’ve talked about it quite a few times and I’ve been pretty clear about my feelings. Still trying to be nice and understanding. But it’s getting to the point where it just feels like weaponized incompetence.",1,1746987884.0,relationship_advice,5,1.0,False

I was terribly scared, because before leaving I drank a few sips of coffee, put on period underwear and a pad - I still haven’t found a more optimal solution for this issue. But nothing happened. I didn’t suddenly peed in pants, I didn’t lose feeling in my legs, I was able to walk the whole time.

I have been using these methods to generate leads for my clients. Now, I would like to share with you all. So that you all entrepreneurs can see more growth.



1 **. Compare Yourself to Others**

People want to know why they should choose you.

Show how you are better than others. You can talk about how you're faster, cheaper, or offer better quality.

Example:

A. “If you are a local soft drink producer \[milk shake etc\] compare it with giants like Pepsi, Coke. It may sound funny but it works better than anything.”  
Or  
B. “We deliver in 1 day. Others take 5 days.”

**Remember:** Don’t say bad things about others. Just explain what you do better.



**2. Make Your Price Feel Smaller**

Prices can sound big unless you compare them to something small.

Example: Instead of saying “$9 per month,” say “Less than 3 cups of coffee a month.”

You can also explain what they get for that price: “For under $10, you get support every day and peace of mind.”

**Remember:** Try different ways of saying the price to see what works best.

I personally sometimes use: less than your monthly C!grate costs or Less than your monthly coffee cost etc. Something new, catchy but very personal.



**3. Use Visuals and Simple Layouts**

Too much text is hard to read.

Use bold words, bullet points, or images to make your message clear and easy to understand.

Break long text into smaller parts so people can read fast.

**Remember:** Use the same colors and fonts so everything looks nice and clean.



**4. Learn From the Bad Reviews of your competitors**

Look at 1–3 star reviews of your competitors.

See what people don’t like—like slow support or missing features.Highlight those points as your USPs

Pro Tip:

1. Always use buyer intent data.
2. Choose Clickbait titles \[it may sound unethical but no harm until it is helping your customers\]
3. Do not cheat or play any kind of tricks/fake promises through your blogs \[be 100% honest and transparent\]

I hope this will help you.Thank you and good luck.",1,1746987686.0,small_business_ideas,0,1.0,False
1kk7i30,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBagCheck/comments/1kk7i30/explore_lovevook_carryon_luggage_review_is_this/,Explore LOVEVOOK carry-on luggage review is this stylish suitcase worth it?,"I recently got the chance to test out the LOVEVOOK Carry On Luggage 22x14x9 Airline Approved, a 20-inch lightweight suitcase designed specifically for women. Exploring this piece felt like preparing for a journey, even when staying local to give it a solid whirl. As someone who travels often and trusts their gear to keep everything organized and manageable on the go, I had high expectations, and this luggage did not disappoint—but there are some things to take into account. Let me share how it performed during my test runs and whether it's worth adding to your travel arsenal.

**Stylish Exterior with Practical Front Compartments**

The quilted front design of this carry-on immediately caught my eye. It was chic yet understated, perfect for anyone who wants a little style boost while lugging their belongings through an airport. The three front compartments are what stole the show for me. These are game-changers, serving as great spots for items that usually get lost in a bigger suitcase—like boarding passes, my trusty power bank, or even a magazine for those long waits. My favorite bit? The laptop pocket lets you breeze through security without digging into the main compartment. The inclusion of a bottle pocket on the side also proved pretty useful, especially when dealing with those tight TSA timelines that make staying hydrated a challenge.

[Check LOVEVOOK Carry On Luggage B0DL5VYXM4 price on Amazon.](https://bagsby.com/check/b0dl5vyxm4/)

**Generous Capacity and Thoughtful Organization**

This suitcase fit way more than I initially expected. Its 45L capacity surprised me. I managed a long weekend trip with space left for small extras and snacks. The dry and wet separation inside was a pleasant discovery. I had toiletries securely stashed in the dedicated wet section, avoiding the dreaded leak scenarios. The internal straps kept everything locked in place, even when I was zipping around the city testing its portability. That said, the interior isn’t cavernous—it may feel tight if you tend to overpack. On one occasion, I ended up wrestling for space because of bulky shoes.

**Built to Handle Travel Bangs and Bumps**

The fabric on this luggage earned its stripes when I spilled coffee over it. Crafted from durable, water-resistant polyester with scratch-resistant finishes, it wiped clean with just a damp cloth. The leather accents give it a premium finish without feeling too delicate. I didn’t baby it; the bag handled heavy-duty tossing into cabs and overhead bins with ease. Moreover, the TSA lock felt secure, though I was a bit impatient trying to reset the combination initially. Make sure you focus while setting it, or you might accidentally create unwanted challenges for yourself (like I did!).

**Gliding Comfortably on Spinner Wheels**

Navigating airport lines made me appreciate how smooth this luggage’s wheels are. The 360° spinner design made gliding on my morning commute trial effortlessly smooth, almost as though it had a mind of its own. Even when packed to its fullest capacity, I experienced no dragging or wobbling. Adjusting the handle was straightforward, and it felt solid, without the typical flimsy rattle I’ve noticed in other mid-range carry-ons. Quality testing clearly wasn’t skimped here!

**Positives**

- Spacious front pockets for quick access items like electronics or documents.
- Durable fabric and a stylish quilted design stand up to wear and tear beautifully.
- Smooth spinner wheels and an adjustable handle ensure mobility is stress-free.
- TSA-approved lock provides peace of mind.
- Generous interior capacity with a clever wet/dry section.

**Critiques**

- Smaller internal size makes tight packing a must for over-packers.
- Larger laptops might struggle to fit in the front compartment.
- Setting or changing the TSA lock requires extra care.

**Alternative Products**

When comparing this luggage to direct competitors like Samsonite’s carry-ons, the LOVEVOOK suitcase has a more fashion-forward appeal while staying lightweight. Samsonite options might provide slightly stronger shell options for security, but they often come with a higher price tag and weigh more, something I don’t particularly enjoy when I’m trying to keep my load light. DELSEY Paris softside luggage falls into a similar category—upmarket and luxurious, but its basic organizational design lacks features like the LOVEVOOK's quilted compartments or dedicated dry/wet separation.

**Cost-Effectiveness**

The value this product brings to the table justifies its price. It balances functionality and style effectively, providing features typically found in pricier alternatives while keeping it affordable. I genuinely appreciated how useful it felt without intimidating me into micromanaging its care. Considering the market’s variety, it offers reliable quality at an attainable cost.

<div>### Exploring Tropical Smoothie’s Fat Burner: What It Is

If you’re curious about boosting your metabolism with a drink from a familiar spot, Tropical Smoothie’s Fat Burner might have caught your eye. This popular beverage aims to offer more than just a tasty treat—it’s marketed as a functional smoothie designed to support fat burning and energy. But what exactly is Tropical Smoothie’s Fat Burner, and what ingredients make it stand out?

At its core, this smoothie is a blend crafted to complement a healthy lifestyle, often promoted as a metabolism booster. It fits into the growing trend of enhanced smoothies that mix natural ingredients purported to aid weight management. To understand how it works, taking a deeper look at its ingredients is essential.

### Key Ingredients Analyzed

The strength of any fat-burning product lies in its components. Tropical Smoothie’s Fat Burner combines various ingredients that are believed to impact metabolism and energy. While the exact formula can vary by location or over time, several consistent elements tend to appear in this smoothie’s recipe. Let’s break down the most common ingredients and what science says about their fat-burning potential.

#### Green Tea

Green tea extract is a popular ingredient in fat-burning supplements, and it’s no surprise to find it here. It contains catechins, particularly epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), which may help increase metabolism and promote fat loss, especially when combined with caffeine.

Studies suggest that green tea can boost fat oxidation during exercise and at rest. The antioxidant properties also support overall health, making it a beneficial addition to the smoothie.

#### Caffeine

Caffeine is a natural stimulant found in coffee, tea, and many energy-boosting beverages. It stimulates your central nervous system, increasing alertness and energy levels. Importantly, caffeine can raise your metabolic rate, helping your body burn more calories.

In Tropical Smoothie’s Fat Burner, caffeine typically comes from sources like green tea or added natural extracts, providing a moderate boost without overwhelming jitters. While caffeine aids short-term calorie burning, tolerance can develop, so it’s wise to consume it in moderation.

#### Garcinia Cambogia

This tropical fruit extract often appears in weight-loss products. It contains hydroxycitric acid (HCA), believed to reduce appetite and inhibit an enzyme involved in fat storage.

Although some small studies show promise, Garcinia cambogia’s effects are still under debate, and it might provide modest support when paired with a balanced diet and exercise. In a smoothie, it delivers a subtle flavor and potential benefits without overwhelming sweetness.

#### L-Carnitine

L-Carnitine is an amino acid derivative important for transporting fatty acids into mitochondria, where they can be burned for energy. It’s often included in fat burner blends to support fat metabolism and improve workout recovery.

While direct fat loss effects from L-Carnitine are mixed in research, many find it helpful in maintaining energy during exercise and supporting muscle health.

#### Fiber and Fruits

Tropical Smoothie’s Fat Burner also incorporates a base of fresh or frozen fruits rich in fiber and antioxidants. Fiber supports digestive health, slows sugar absorption, and helps you feel full longer—key factors for weight management.

Fruits like pineapple, mango, or berries offer natural sweetness alongside vitamins and minerals. This natural ingredient blend keeps your smoothie nutrient-dense rather than just a stimulant.

### What This Means for Your Routine

Drinking Tropical Smoothie’s Fat Burner can complement your efforts to manage weight by providing a thoughtful combination of natural metabolism boosters and nutrients. However, it’s important to remember that no smoothie alone can magically burn fat. Sustained results come from consistent healthy eating, regular physical activity, and overall lifestyle balance.

The ingredients examined each bring their own slight metabolic push; green tea and caffeine primarily stimulate calorie burning, while Garcinia cambogia and L-Carnitine may aid fat breakdown and appetite control. The fiber and fruit content rounds out the smoothie to create a satisfying, energizing drink.

### Is Tropical Smoothie’s Fat Burner Right for You?

If you enjoy flavorful, fruity smoothies and want a functional option to support your metabolism, Tropical Smoothie’s Fat Burner offers a convenient choice. It provides natural energy and ingredients that can work alongside your goals. Just be mindful of any sensitivity to caffeine or ingredients like Garcinia cambogia, and consult your doctor if you have specific health concerns.

Ultimately, this beverage serves best as part of a well-rounded approach. Pairing it with proper hydration, balanced meals, and fitness can help you feel more energized and support your fat-burning goals in a safe, natural way.

By understanding the ingredients inside Tropical Smoothie’s Fat Burner, you can make an informed choice that fits your lifestyle and preferences. Whether you’re seeking a metabolism boost or a delicious smoothie option, this blend offers a promising balance of taste and functional benefits.

</div>How Effective Are Tropical Smoothie’s Fat Burner Ingredients for Weight Loss?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Understanding the Components of Tropical Smoothie’s Fat Burner

Tropical Smoothie’s Fat Burner is designed to support weight loss by leveraging ingredients that promote metabolism, improve energy levels, and assist in fat burning. To truly gauge how effective this product is, it’s essential to analyze the key ingredients it contains and understand what scientific research says about each component’s role in weight management.

### Common Ingredients Typically Found in Fat Burners

While formulations can vary, fat burners like Tropical Smoothie's often include a blend of natural extracts and compounds. Here’s a breakdown of some prevalent ingredients you might find:

- **Caffeine**: A well-known stimulant that can boost metabolism and increase energy.
- **Green Tea Extract**: Rich in antioxidants and linked to improved fat oxidation.
- **Garcinia Cambogia**: Contains hydroxycitric acid, marketed for appetite suppression.
- **L-Carnitine**: An amino acid that helps transport fatty acids into cells to be burned for energy.
- **Vitamin B Complex**: Supports energy production and overall metabolism.

### How Each Ingredient Supports Weight Loss

#### Caffeine

Caffeine is a natural powerhouse in fat burner supplements. It works by stimulating the central nervous system, leading to increased energy expenditure. This effect can help you burn more calories even at rest. Research shows that moderate caffeine intake can elevate metabolism by 3-11%, which is significant in aiding weight loss efforts. Besides boosting caloric burn, caffeine also enhances focus and alertness, which may improve workout performance.

#### Green Tea Extract

Containing catechins and a modest amount of caffeine, green tea extract is known for its fat-oxidizing properties. Studies suggest that green tea catechins can increase fat burning, especially during exercise. This extract helps improve metabolic rate and reduces fat absorption in the gut. Regular consumption of green tea or its extract has been linked with modest weight loss, making it a valuable ingredient to support Tropical Smoothie’s fat burner benefits.

#### Garcinia Cambogia

This tropical fruit extract is popular in weight loss supplements due to hydroxycitric acid (HCA). HCA is thought to block an enzyme involved in fat production and reduce appetite by increasing serotonin levels. However, clinical evidence on Garcinia Cambogia’s effectiveness is mixed. Some studies report modest weight loss benefits, while others find minimal or no impact. It’s helpful as part of an overall diet but shouldn’t be relied on alone for significant results.

#### L-Carnitine

L-Carnitine plays a role in transporting fatty acids into mitochondria, the energy factories of cells, where fats are burned to produce energy. While theoretically it should boost fat metabolism, research presents mixed conclusions about its ability to promote significant weight loss. Some individuals may benefit from L-Carnitine supplementation, particularly those who are deficient or engage in high-intensity exercise, but it should be combined with other healthy habits.

#### Vitamin B Complex

Vitamins like B6 and B12 support the body’s metabolism by aiding in the breakdown of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, converting food into energy. While these vitamins don’t directly burn fat, they play a crucial role in maintaining energy levels. This helps you stay active and burn calories more effectively throughout the day.

### Balancing Effectiveness with Realistic Expectations

It’s important to recognize that fat burners like the one offered by Tropical Smoothie are not miracle solutions. Their ingredients can support weight loss by slightly increasing metabolism, reducing appetite, or boosting energy to encourage physical activity. However, the effects are often modest. The most effective approach to losing weight is a combination of a healthy diet, regular exercise, and lifestyle changes.

​ Discover the delicious smoothie plan that lets you eat normally while you shed the weight! -Click Here to Learn More--&gt; https://freepage.pro/loganferret/smoothiediet   
Using Tropical Smoothie’s Fat Burner may provide an extra edge, especially if you already maintain a well-rounded routine. The natural ingredients focus on enhancing metabolism and supporting fat oxidation, which can complement your weight management goals. But without consistent healthy habits, relying solely on a fat burner will likely yield limited results.

### Potential Side Effects and Considerations

While the ingredients in Tropical Smoothie’s fat burner are generally safe when consumed within recommended doses, some people might experience side effects. For example, caffeine can cause jitters, sleep disturbances, or increased heart rate in sensitive individuals. It’s wise to monitor your response to these supplements and consult a healthcare provider if you have underlying conditions or are taking medications.

Additionally, ingredient quality and dosage matter. Some commercial fat burners may not provide sufficient levels of key ingredients to have a meaningful effect. Always check the label for ingredient transparency and standardized extracts to ensure you’re getting a potent product.

### Practical Tips for Using Fat Burners Effectively

- Combine with a balanced diet rich in whole foods, lean proteins, and vegetables.
- Include regular physical activity tailored to your fitness level and preferences.
- Stay hydrated and get enough sleep to optimize metabolism and recovery.
- Use fat burner supplements as a supportive tool, not a replacement for healthy habits.
- Start with lower doses to assess tolerance, especially if sensitive to stimulants.

Ultimately, Tropical Smoothie’s Fat Burner ingredients can contribute to weight loss by supporting metabolic function and energy levels. When paired with consistent lifestyle choices, these ingredients offer an effective way to enhance your fat-burning potential and reach your goals more efficiently.

### Conclusion

Tropical Smoothie’s Fat Burner offers a blend of ingredients commonly associated with boosting metabolism and supporting weight loss efforts. Key components like green tea extract, caffeine, and certain fruit extracts work together to help increase energy levels and may promote fat oxidation. Understanding these ingredients helps you see how this product could complement your healthy lifestyle.

However, while some ingredients have promising benefits, their effectiveness depends on various factors such as dosage, individual metabolism, and overall diet and exercise habits. No single product guarantees rapid weight loss, so it’s important to view Tropical Smoothie’s Fat Burner as a potential aid rather than a magic solution. Combining this fat burner with a balanced diet and regular physical activity will give you the best chance of seeing positive results.

For those curious about adding a fat-burning boost to their routine, Tropical Smoothie’s Fat Burner could be a convenient option thanks to its natural components. Still, it’s wise to pay attention to how your body responds and consult with a healthcare professional if you have any underlying health conditions or concerns.

Getting matches for me is not the issue, so I'm at least above average. I could stand to work out and reduce my body fat % but looks definitely aren't the bottleneck.

I would like to say I'm a good texter. I'm socially aware enough to not just send ""hi"" and to try to respond to  peoples' profiles where they actually show personality. I don't monopolize the conversation, go on rants, etc. I'm perhaps too self-aware and self-censoring if anything.

My 30 matches in the ""Their turn"" section of Hinge, after I tried Plus for a week, however, would beg to differ. Maybe I'm fatigued and burned out, self-sabotaging, I don't know. But I have a friend (in the UK) performing pretty similarly in getting matches but having way more conversion.

It's always been bad but even a year ago it was not THIS bad for me. It's gotten to the point where I just expect ghosting at every step - sending the first message, moving it off the app, planning the date, getting another date, etc. no matter how I feel.

There have been two or three times where I've had a girl repeatedly flake and try to reschedule. Like why - how is that even fun or a good use of her time? I don't want to go down a misogyny rabbit hole though.

Then once I actually get a date - I can hold a conversation but I have a pretty mellow (not loud, gregarious) personality. This is now coming off as ""no spark"" or whatever because I'm supposed to escalate getting a latte at a coffee shop to that. I question, again, if I'm stuck in a feedback loop. If I'm coming across cold because everyone might as well be a stranger until we've been on multiple dates and are regularly seeing each other. It's a rational feeling with how prevalent ghosting is.

But with this dynamic I never want women to complain about men having a ""roster"" again. It's necessary to be talking to so many people just to actually get any dates because people are so fickle.

1kk7ej6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Schedule_I/comments/1kk7ej6/i_managed_to_make_a_manufacturing_chain_between/,I managed to make a manufacturing chain between docks and barn.,"So to begin here's a few observations:

1. Handlers can move items to and from outside their assigned property. Range on this is wildly inconsistent and glitchy. You might've seen set up involving the sweatshop and storage unit where one has a chemist/botanist and the other has a hauler. All in all it seems to just boil down to nav meshes: they don't seem to want to cross bridges, and generally if NPCs can path somewhere over actual map terrain so can they with some sort of a range limit.
2. You can place items inside your money laundering businesses.

Putting these two points together, you can in fact move product between properties. It is jank, I wasn't able to make bungalow move its product anywhere (tried Motel Room, Sweatshop, Taco Ticklers, Laundromat, Storage Unit, in only 1 case would the hauler walk to the storage rack but then get confused as to where that's supposed to go.

Also finally, if your handler get stuck, you can delete the route from them, punch them out, and drag them to a road or sidewalk towards their jobsite, they will get unstuck when they wake up. Or you can fire them but rehiring a new one will eat up the signing bonus.

So lets get to it:

The overall set up involves 3 handlers:

1. hired at docks: docks to car wash
2. hired at storage unit: car wash to post office
3. hired at barn: post office to barn.

Set up of the Docks Warehouse doesn't matter much. I've got 6 botanists, 2 chemists, and 2 handlers (might switch it to 1 handler and 3 chemists).

https://preview.redd.it/xasoq9m3x60f1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7668ad86281cc5ac151f8eb1b79f19b201c7b7b7

All the produced goods are dropped off at a shelf by the door. Exact location of this shelf doesn't matter much.

https://preview.redd.it/mh5paysxx60f1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4466f0dcc71bfc995c610d5e49dfae3469f6d07c

Then a handler in the docks moves the product to a shelf at the car wash. Again location of this shelf doesn't matter much. The navs in car wash seem to be working fine. A handler hired at the storage unit will move this product to the post office.

Now we come to the fun part - the post office. It's nav meshes are completely and utterly fubar. The set up has to be exact. You want the shelf to be in the corner on the right-hand side of the computer and you want to barricade the room off. I found that coffee table works the best here for that purpose (not enough gap for handlers to squeeze through). Yes this is necessary, if you put it on the left the handlers from the barn will get stuck. If you don't barricade the room off the handlers will try to go in through the door and get stuck around the front desk. Handlers from docks can reach the post office, but will invariably get stuck no matter where you place anything.

https://preview.redd.it/k5pja46bz60f1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=40fc8a22734efc2acfd77051ac46f5f621cc0c5d

You also want to block off the back of the post office, two shitboxes wedged around the planter do the trick. Without this the handler from the storage unit will get stuck, this shelf only works when it gets interacted with from the barn-side corner of the post office. Don't mind the NPC, it spawned due to a deal.

https://preview.redd.it/pcgdypgk070f1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8b9b6a055e5797d8b901c5b8b7dee9844c54c834

Then finally, handler from the barn will move the product to a shelf at the barn.

https://preview.redd.it/6hqqrac7170f1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d0c186f90401447af9cf3c2db570cc7a3ac52eb5

Barn set up is 8 handlers and 2 chemists, 8 mixing stations each being fed from 4 racks.
