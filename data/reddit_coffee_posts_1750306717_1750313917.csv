Have you ever logged into your crypto wallet while sitting in a coffee shop or at the airport?

That moment is actually a big test of your wallet’s design — and how much it really protects you.

Protocols like Kerberos step in to silently prevent disaster: no passwords flying through the air, no fake servers pretending to be real ones. Just encrypted ticket exchanges that verify both sides of the connection.

This isn't something users often think about — but it's the kind of invisible defense that makes or breaks security on public networks.

We’re curious:

* How important is this kind of under-the-hood security to you when choosing a wallet?
* Do you prioritize transparency in how your wallet protects your identity and data?

North Bengal has always been Bengali — just not the kind you choose to acknowledge. Our identity doesn’t need your approval. It needs freedom from your gatekeeping. We’re not breaking away from Bengal — we’re breaking free from a system that erased Varendri history, ignored our development, and treated us as invisible.

1lf3j2i,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lf3j2i/flicker/,Flicker,"“Augh!” I cried, bringing my hands to my eyes in desperation.  The spray bottle fell to the ground and I followed soon after.  My rear landed first as I rubbed my eyes with my fingers.

Calming my composure, I sat there on the floor and attempted to sop up the window cleaner from my crying eyes with my sleeve.  It wasn’t even that much, just a few drops that splattered back at me from spraying it on the surface.

Taking a few deep breaths, I blinked my eyes a few times and brought them back to the glass door, reflecting the interior as if it were a mirror.  

Reflecting the idiot staring at it.

Sighing, I brought up my hand and gazed at my watch.  “*10:46 p.m.*” I thought to myself.  “*An hour and fourteen minutes left.*”

Suddenly, the building went black.  The door returned transparent, displaying the lights above the businesses across the street.  My heart rate began to increase as my whole body flinched.

As quickly as they turned off, the lights flashed back on.  The thumping from my heart was slowly returning to its normal pace.  “*They’ve got to get those damn lights fixed.*”

I sprawled myself onto the carpeted floor and let out a loud groan.  It echoed throughout the small, empty office building for a few seconds.  The lack of sound in the building was slightly off-putting.

Scrunching my eyebrows, I thought to myself, “*I better not develop a liminal space fear during this job.*”  I chuckled.  “*I’ll be filling up a mop bucket and get sent to ‘The Backrooms.’*”

Forcing myself to sit up once more, I attempted to rub the tiredness from my eyes.  I brought my attention back to the bottle of glass cleaner on the floor.  With a deep and exaggerated sigh, I grabbed the bottle and stood back up.

“*Sitting here on my ass isn’t going to pay the bills.*”



I spit out the spearmint toothpaste into my sink.  “Mom!” I exclaimed, leaning on the small counter.  “You don’t need to send me anything!”

“Magda, you’ve been without a conditioner for months.” the voice over the phone shot.  “Your hair is going to fall out!”  

“I’ll be fine.  Shampoo gets the job done.”

I looked at the ends of my hair.  A plant’s roots sprawled out from a single strand of my dry, brown hair.  “*I guess a conditioner would be nice.*” I thought to myself.  “*I’ll die before she finds out though.*”

I heard a thud on the other line, more than likely her hitting a table.  “You need to take better care of yourself.  If you keep neglecting your health, you’re going to have some major issues down the road.”

“Mom, it’s just conditioner.  It’s not that big of a deal.  I’m not going to die.” 

 “But your hair is.”  I sighed and pinched the top of my nose.  “I’m working as a pizza delivery driver and a night janitor, not a model.  How my hair looks doesn’t matter.”

There were a few seconds of uncomfortable silence.  I looked down at the tile floor, the white shade stained a slight gray tint.

“I just worry about you, rakkaus.” she continued, her tone now much more relaxed.  “You’re working so much and disregarding little health things.  I’m just concerned that you might start brushing off big health things down the line.”

I stayed quiet for a moment, ashamed of how annoyed I got with her.  “Alright mom.” I began, sighing.  “I’ll take the conditioner.  Just get me the cheapest one.  You need to save the money for mummo.”

She breathed a chuckle.  “You’ve always been such a grandma’s girl.”  I laughed a little, wiping leftover toothpaste from my mouth with my shirt.  “I think asking to save money for her medical bills goes beyond just being a grandma’s girl.”  “Don’t forget about all that you’re sending as well.”  “It’s the least I could do in exchange for her helping to raise me.”

“We both miss you.”  I could practically hear her smiling on the other end.

“Are you almost ready for work, rakkaus?” she asked, her voice kind.  “Oh crap.” I said, realizing the time on my phone.  “Yeah, I just have to get dressed.”

“Okay good.” she replied.  “Make sure you stay careful though.  There’s been several disappearances around that office building.”

I furrowed my eyebrows in confusion as I laid out clothes on my bed.  “How did you hear about that, mom?”  “Just by seeing some articles about the area.”

I stopped what I was doing and asked, “You saw a random article about my specific new job place from all the way in Finland?”  “...yes…” a quiet voice replied.

“Are you stalking my workplace again?”  The other line stayed silent for a few seconds.  “...no…”

“Mom!” I exclaimed, throwing my free hand in the air.  “I’m a grown woman, I can do research on the places I apply to myself.”

“Okay, okay.” she responded.  “I’ll stop.  I’m just scared about my baby all alone in America by herself.”  “I understand.” I replied.  “It just surprises me you’re still doing that from when I was sixteen.”

She giggled, “I was always a helicopter mom when it came to you getting a new job.”  “Was?” I questioned.  We laughed together.

“I’ll let you go now, rakkaus.” she sighed sadly.  “Have a great day at work.”  “Thank you mom.” I responded, a warm smile emerging on my face.  “Minä rakastan sinua.”  “Minäkin rakastan sinua.”

The smile on my face slowly vanished as I brought myself back to reality with the sound of the dial tone.  “*We’ll be together soon enough.*”



Yawning, I opened the glass door of the building, the same one that repelled window cleaner into my eye.  I glared at it harshly.

“Did the door do something to you, Ms. Mäkinen?” a voice called.  I looked in front of me at the smiling young man, his brown suit freshly pressed with no sign of a single wrinkle.  His usual attire.

“Oh, good evening, Mr. Crawford.” I replied, giving back a similar smile.  “Please,” he began.  “There’s no need for formalities.  You know I’m just Davit.”

“Then that means I’m just Magda.”  “Very well then.” he bowed his head slightly, his blond hair falling in front of his face.

“Now then,” he continued, gesturing behind me.  “The door?”  “Oh!” I laughed, my cheeks growing warmer.  “I-it’s nothing.  I just had some window cleaner splash back at me.”

He responded with a hearty laugh.  “Talking with you Magda, is the perfect way to end the day.”  His green eyes gleamed with excitement as he continued, “Being the boss’ son makes the day so boring with meetings and constant perfect professionalism and it gets tiring, you know?”

I nodded my head in agreement.  I had no idea what that was like.

“He wants to treat me like an important business man, but he makes me turn in my keys before I leave.”  “How come?” I asked, visibly confused.  He scratched the back of his head, “It’s probably because I always end up leaving something, so it’s probably an incentive to make sure I have everything before I leave.”

I laughed, “That’s more than likely it.”  He laughed with me.

“Well, would you allow me to walk you to your station?” he asked, moving to the side.  I gave him a look of confusion.  “You mean my corner in the garage with all the cleaning supplies?”

He laughed again, “I suppose so if you want to put it like that.”  I shook my head and smiled.  “There’s no need for that, Davit.  Thanks for offering.”

His smile suddenly dropped and he looked at me blankly.

Less than a second later, he returned to his happy and joyful attitude.  “All right then, Magda.” he started, giving me a wave.  “I’ll see you tomorrow.  Stay safe!”

I gave him a wave back and he was out the door.  

I walked across the small area with three couches that formed a ‘u’ shape with a short coffee table in the middle.  When I entered the garage, I was greeted by the sound of a saw.  Covering my ears, my eyes met those of the operator.  

“Sorry about that, little lady.” he said after he turned the saw off.  “I was finishing up some last minute cutting.”  “You’re alright.” I told him, my ears throbbing.

“You the new janitor?” he asked, looking me up and down, a slight smirk emerging on his face.  I was wearing a red, old shirt from a pizza chain I used to work at with hand-me-down flare jeans and worn out sneakers, so I have no clue what he was looking for.

“I am, I’ve been here a few weeks.” I replied, trying not to show how uncomfortable I was.  “Well,” he said, his eyes traveling around me again.  “You be careful around here.  Little ladies have gone missing.”  I gulped, “I’m aware.”

“Just telling ya.” he responded, walking closer.  “Don’t want none to take our little janitor.”  He gave me a smirk disguised as a smile as he placed a hand on my shoulder, close enough to my neck for his fingers to brush on it.

“The back door in here is unlocked just to let you know.” he informed me, with a sing-song voice, stepping away.  The door shut behind him with a loud thud.  I rolled my eyes and scratched the side of my neck.  “*Good thing I only work after everyone’s gone.*” I thought to myself.

Walking to my corner, I could immediately tell something was off.  “My damn apron is missing again!” I exclaimed, rushing toward the hook where I always put it after a shift.

“*That creep is probably the one who keeps moving it.*.”  I thought, opening up the cabinets containing various cleaning supplies.  I eventually found it on the floor in front of the mop bucket.  “*At least it wasn’t in a hard to find spot this time.*""



I sneezed, the sharp smell of bleach piercing my nose.  The bleach mixed into the water as I swirled the mop in the combination.  My eyes began to water, typical for this part of the job.  I used the back of my arm to wipe my tears, praying no bleach got on that part.

I flopped the mop onto the bathroom floor and it let out a splat.  After a few seconds of moving it along the tile, I had to lean against the wall.  My arms were already tired from scrubbing down the bathroom furniture and breakroom just fifteen minutes prior.  I let out a few deep breaths and moved my shoulders in a few small circles.

“Just another hour.” I said to myself.  “Another hour and I can rest.”  I took a quick swig of my water, my dry throat rejoicing.

Suddenly, the lights went out.  I jumped in fear as something poured on my shirt and pants.  The lights flickered back on, revealing the mysterious liquid was only water.

“Ah damn it.” I said, placing the water bottle on the sink.  I grabbed some paper towels and patted them on my shirt.  My eyes landed on an area on my pants.

“You’ve got to be kidding me.” I shot, staring at the bleached splatter on my left shin.  I attempted to rub it off with paper towels, but it made no difference.  I kept going, my face growing hotter and hotter with frustration and embarrassment.  

I threw the wet paper towel down on the ground and placed my back end on the door and braced my arms on my knees.  Taking a few shaky deep breaths, I attempted to calm myself down.  “They’re just jeans.” I told myself.  “Nothing to get worked up about.”  I picked the mop back up and continued to work.



The loud hum of the vacuum ran throughout the small building, drowning out any other potential sound.  It hurt my ears, as it had nowhere to spread in the small office.  I turned it off as I ran out of cord and had to change which outlet it was plugged into.  I switched off the light and the small office space became close to pitch black.  Thin lines of light seeped through the closed blinds.

A black figure interrupted the yellow and orange, walking along the outside of the window.  “*Wow,*” I thought, checking the time.  My watch read 10:37.  “*Someone’s doing overtime.*”  I chuckled to myself and moved the vacuum out of the room.  Luckily, I was almost done with vacuuming.  All that was left was the small carpeted area in front of the door.

I plugged the cord into an outlet beside the small table with a sign in sheet and a message that read, “NO CLASSIFIED DISCUSSIONS.”  I was still unclear as to what this business really did.

Standing back up, I looked at myself in the reflection of the door.  I was a mess.  My hair was scraggly, my jeans were stained with bleach, and the bags under my eyes were darker than usual.  I took a deep breath and let it out with an overly loud raspberry.

It went dark.

The lights had gone out only for a second.

But I saw it.

The newly pressed brown suit.

His bright green eyes now wide shrouded in shadow.

Staring at me.

Stalking me like prey.

The lights went back on and my reflection was all I saw.  “*Huh?*” I thought, my heart rate accelerating.  “*Was that Davit?*”  I backed away from the door slowly, not taking my eyes off of it.  “*Why was he staring in the building like that?  He could just knock if he wanted in.*”  I began to hyperventilate.  “*Was he staring at me?  And why like that?  Does he want to hurt me?*”  I walked away more quickly, trying to sort out my thoughts.  “*Why do I feel so scared?  He can’t come in here to get me, right?”*

My eyes shot open in realization.  At the same time, I heard thudding on the pavement heading in the direction of the garage.

I ran across the building to try and reach the back area.  Flinging open the door, I sprinted to the outside entrance, guided by a slight light illuminating the outline.

Just as I reached the handle, the door moved open.  I snatched it with my other hand and pulled with everything I had.  It closed.  My reflexes kicked in and I locked the handle.

As I reached for the deadbolts, I realized I didn’t hear anything.  One would expect him to be pounding on the door or trying to force it open, but there was nothing.  “*Is he still there?*” I sheepishly thought, hands glued to the doorknob.  Shaking, I brought my eye up to the peephole.

Nothing.  Even at night, the lights from the outside are still on so it wasn’t so dark as to not see anything.  I let out an uneven breath, trying to gain my composure.

A green eye stared back at me.  An eye devoid of any emotion or brightness.

An instant after, a loud pounding on the door commenced.  I flinched back in shock.  Breaking out of my trance of fear, I slid over the top deadbolt into the wall.  The thrashing’s target was changed to the door handle.  Within a few hits, the knob completely fell off.

“Magdaaaa.” a sing-song voice called out from the hole in the door.  “Unlock the door pleaseee.”

A shiver ran down my spine.  His voice was so condescending.  It was as if he was speaking to a small child, trying to lure it into a trap.  This man wasn’t Davit.  There was no cherry tone or laugh in his voice.  This was a monster.

“Magda!” it yelled, pounding the door harder than before.  I used this chance to sprint to the door I came through.  Before making it past the threshold, an object caught my eye on a workbench.  Sliding it into my pocket, I made a run for the entrance.

I breathed a sigh of relief as I saw the short distance I had to cross.  Ramming my body into the door, I jerked the handle down.  My shoulder began to pulsate with pain.  The door hadn’t opened, in fact the handle didn’t move either.  I yanked the handle up and down but it wouldn’t move.  Checking the deadbolt wasn’t locked either, I thought, “*It must’ve messed with the door before the lights flickered!*”

The lights went out.  They didn’t immediately turn back on as if they glitched.  They stayed off.  The entire building was left in darkness.  It dawned on me that there was a power control panel in the garage.  If the lights are off, he got inside.

I ran down the hall and went into the first office on my right.  Putting my back to the wall, I covered my mouth to silence my panting.  I rushed into my back pocket to retrieve my phone and what I grabbed from the workbench.  I just managed to dial 911 before the garage door opened and I sucked in a breath.  

“911, what’s your emergency?” the voice chimed on the other end.  “942 Carlswood street NE, building F.” I whispered quickly.  “There’s a man at my work trying to get me.  I don’t know what he’s going to do but my life is threatened.”  Before the operator could respond, I turned the call volume all the way down and slipped my phone into my pocket.  I prayed this was still being recorded.

“Magdaaaa.” it called again.  I held my breath.  “Are you hidinggggg?”  Its soft footsteps on the carpeted floor got louder and louder.  I stared at the ground, the hallway slightly illuminating the doorway.  Its shadow moved across and further down the hallway.

“You know,” it began, causing me to flinch.  “This is a small building.  Not many places to go.”

I peered at the edge of the door frame, my hand gripped tight on the object from the workbench.  Taking in a shaky breath, I clenched my teeth to keep them from chattering.

“Boo!”

Its head poked through the door, grinning from ear to ear.  Dark green eyes with dilated pupils looking deep into mine.  “I found yo-”

I plunged the tweezers deep into his right eye.  He screamed as blood erupted and streamed down his face.  Grabbing his jacket collar, I pulled him down to the floor and jumped over the flailing body.

I sprinted across the floor and into the office closest to the door.  Quickly grabbing the first chair I could find and running back, I swung the chair into the door.  The glass shattered, covering the ground.

“Get back here!” Davit yelled, charging at me.  “You’re mine, Magda!”  I turned and threw the chair at him, knocking him back down.

I hopped over the glass, making sure to pick up a shard, and ran out into the parking lot.  It wasn’t long until there was the sound of crunching glass behind me.  My efforts to run were futile because only a few seconds passed before I was pushed to the ground, knocking my shard out of my hand.

Davit turned me over to face him and sat on my torso.  Blood ran down his face and dripped onto mine.  He stayed there, panting and grinning.  I attempted to hit him but he grabbed my wrists.  He tightened his grip and I gasped, fearing they would snap.

“You’re so troublesome, Magda.” he remarked, tilting his head to the left to get a better look.  “I thought you would go down easy, but now I have tweezers in my eye.”  He laughed.  “I suppose I should’ve known better, considering you’re a poor street rat fighting for survival in the world.”

I wiggled my body around in an attempt to break free, tears forming in my eyes.  I glanced over at the shard of glass laying on the pavement.  Davit followed my gaze and frowned.  “Aw damn it.  Your only weapon.”

He grabbed both of my wrists with one hand and got the shard.  “I was going to keep you around, you know?” he said, his sick grin returning.  “You were going to be with me for a while.  It would’ve been so nice.”

He observed the glass in his hand, flipping it over and turning it.  “It really is a shame you turned out to be such a little chihuahua.”  He erupted in laughter before turning back to look at me.

“You know what would be hilarious?” he asked, his smile piercing the corners of his eyes.  “What if I kill you with the thing you thought would protect you?”

I felt my eyes widen with fear as he rose the shard in the air.  He swung it down, aiming for my left eye.  My hand had slipped out of his grasp and blocked.

I screamed as my hand was pierced, the bones fracturing and tendons tearing.  He pushed down more and I curled my fingers around it.  I shoved the glass away from my face, every second cutting deeper into my palm.

“Just die!” he cackled, putting more body weight into it.  Tears streamed down my face knowing I was just delaying the inevitable.  I was going to die here.

Davit looked up, something catching his attention.  Then I heard it.

Sirens.

“Cops?” he asked, frantic.  He glared at me, eyes burning with rage.  “You bitch-”

He was cut off,  blood spurting out of his mouth as I plunged the glass shard deeper into his neck.  His shaky hand reached up to lightly grab my arm, trying to push it away.  His hand slipped off, caked in a deep red.

He stared at me again, his eyes glazing over more with each passing second.  His mouth opened as to say something, but only blood pooled out, covering his neat suit.

Red and blue lights flashed across this body.  He slumped over to his left and fell on the ground with a splat.

I let out a breath I didn’t know was being held.  My breathing was shaky as I stared into the sky.  Not a single star.  Pure darkness.  If the sirens hadn’t gone off, would this be all I see?

Police officers and paramedics came into view.  Davit was taken off of me, careful not to remove the glass from my hand.  A woman crouched down to me and said something I didn’t retain.  I only had one thing on my mind.

“Can…” I began, trying to push the lump in my throat down.  “Can I c-call my m-mom?”  She looked at me in confusion while taking glances at my body.  I think she was checking for more injuries.

“I n-need..” I continued, eyes welling up in tears.  “I need to tell her I’ll be in Finland soon.”",1,1750313548.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Okay, so I have something super exciting to share with you all today! You know those moments when you scroll through social media and see a post that *just blows up*? Like, it gets all the likes, shares, and comments? Well, guess what? You can tap into that magic with some viral blueprints that are just *begging* to be borrowed! 🔥

I recently stumbled upon a treasure trove of insights in the **AI Content Vault**, and let me tell you, it’s like having a cheat code for creativity. Want to know how I plan to use them? Here’s a quick rundown:

1. **The Relatable Dilemma**: You ever notice how posts that tap into a common struggle can go viral? Maybe it’s about the *Monday blues* or the *perils of grocery shopping* – people love to nod along! Starting with a relatable scenario hooks your audience right away.  
   - Example: “Ever find yourself staring at your fridge, wondering why you bought half of this stuff?”

2. **The Eye-Catching Headline**: Seriously, headlines are like the glitter on a cupcake – they make everything better. A catchy line can make or break your post.  
   - Example: “5 Mistakes Every New AI Writer Makes (and How to Avoid Them!)”

3. **The Visual Appeal**: Don’t underestimate the power of visuals. A vibrant graphic or a meme can *speak* louder than words sometimes!  
   - Think about it: a funny gif or a killer infographic can amplify your message like crazy.

4. **The Emotional Connection**: Share your feelings, people! It’s like opening a little window to your world that can resonate with others. When you share a personal story, it’s like we’re all around the coffee table having a good chat.  
   - Did you ever have a project that flopped? Share the lessons; people love it, and it makes you more relatable!

5. **Know Your Audience**: This one seems obvious, but really understanding who you’re talking to can change the game. Are they looking for humor? Inspiration? Specific tips? Tailor your content accordingly.  
   - Questions to ponder: What keeps them up at night? What are their goals?

Now, I know what you’re thinking – “How do I even start?” Sometimes it feels overwhelming, but remember, it’s all about starting somewhere. Just dive in, pick one blueprint, and customize it to your unique style. 

And here’s the kicker: these blueprints won’t be up forever! I’m talking about hopping onto trends and adapting them before they fizzle out. It’s like catching lightning in a bottle! ⚡

So, as we’re all thinking about how to make the most of these blueprints, think about your style, your story, and how you can connect with your audience. Because at the end of the day, it’s about sharing *your* voice in a sea of content!

Alright, enough of my rambling! Can’t wait to see what you all come up with. And remember, let’s keep experimenting and sharing our wins (and flops) along the way! 🌟 What blueprints are you considering taking for a spin?",1,1750313374.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

I've been on this subreddit before but not much luck. Unfortunately most messages have about as much substance as the people behind them. I'm looking for long term friends and actual connections but I know that's a bit of a loaded request on here. I'm hoping we have things in common to talk about. A bit about me is I'm quite introverted. I enjoy a lot of quiet, creative hobbies like reading and journaling. I like old sitcoms and cartoons, I'm not huge on anime but I do read a few mangas. A quiet and slower lifestyle. I love visiting libraries, coffee shops, bookstores, thrift stores. It's a bit hard to find others like me because they're usually all hiding the same. I do love spending time with someone while just doing our own things, the company is very nice. I'll match your energy when it comes to messaging, I love to chat but I am shy at first. I'm pretty easy going but I am a bit of an old lady compared to most. I hope you know how to carry a conversation or show interest in it. If you're looking for a short conversation, I probably won't be a fun chat. Something a bit different to my other hobbies is I love paranormal and supernatural topics. I have some pretty odd, spiritual beliefs before we get to the conversation. I enjoy some video games but not huge on it. I love COD zombies, RDR2, Minecraft, The Sims, Infinity Nikki, and some others. I hope your message is a bit more than just a hi, hello. I'm 27 from Cali, open to anyone but keep it sfw. It would be great to make some girl friends, I hope I can find other women looking for genuine friends. It would be great if you're within a 6-8 hr time difference so its not so difficult but if we can make good friends, I'm sure we can make it work!

Here are some icebreakers:

* What do you enjoy watching?
* Do you believe in anything paranormal or supernatural?
* Do you collect anything?
* What's a deal breaker for you in a friendship?
* How do you like spending your time?
* Do you have any pets?",1,1750313209.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False
1lf3fsz,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lf3fsz/broke_up_2_hours_ago_because_he_wasnt_feeling_it/,"Broke up 2 hours ago because he ""wasn't feeling it"" 😀 Thoughts?","We had just met for lunch, and in the evening he called me out again for coffee and broke up with me.

According to him, he's not feeling it, and he was aware that he'd been selfish and neglectful in the relationship because he had gotten busy with work. He also admitted to me that he had always been like this, and that caused some of his past relationships to end (I had no idea about this trait).

But I've noticed his ""laziness"" for a while, and I will admit... I lost the spark for a brief moment a while back, and thus I was doing what I could to gain it back. Which I did. I communicated it with him, and he tried but every time he felt it would fall short.

We had been dating for 2 months, but we've only known each other for 3. I'm glad it ended quickly but I felt it was a bit unfair. I worked on it and I was finally finding a comfortable pace to come to terms with, and when I do, he tells me he's not been feeling it and now he wants to end it. I think I'm just bitter that he wasn't voicing it out, and when he became aware of it, he wanted to dip asap. 

He told me that it was him, and not me. And when I talked to him about what his future is going to look like now, he says he'll likely be single because the awareness of him being selfish is getting back at him. But I don't know if I want to believe that completely.

I'm not even angry because throughout all my relationships, I emphasize communication so much and I actually see it through and I tried my best too. I thought this was stable so I guess I felt a bit blindsided, but I think this boiled down to him not being as interested in me. 🤷🏻‍♀️

A shame because he was a great dude, but I guess he saved me from future frustrations because it would be difficult to continue being with someone who is lazy in a relationship. 

Sorry, I'm just a bit frustrated and wanted a channel to vent for a bit and perhaps hear a few similar stories to catch what it really means from his perspective?",1,1750313198.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

Sarah from accounting, her face pale, swore she'd seen herself buying coffee at the shop across the street. ""And the freakiest part,"" she'd whispered, eyes wide, ""it was smiling. A huge, unsettling grin, like it was about to unhinge its jaw."" We all laughed, chalked it up to stress or too much caffeine. But then, old Mr. Henderson from down the hall, a man who hadn't cracked a smile in two decades, told us he'd seen his exact double standing outside his window at 3 AM, just watching him. And Mr. Henderson, in a voice I'd never heard from him before, added, ""It had a smile that went from ear to ear.""

That's when the humor started to curdle.

It became a macabre game of ""who's next?"" The stories grew more frequent, more vivid. Always the same details: an exact replica, seen from a distance, completely still, and that damn smile. It wasn't a friendly smile, or even a malicious one. It was something else entirely – a vast, empty expanse of teeth and gums, stretched impossibly wide, like a tear in the fabric of reality itself. People started looking over their shoulders, double-checking reflections. Paranoia, you say? Maybe. But how do you explain an entire city gripped by the same chilling hallucination?

I tried to dismiss it, to rationalize. Mass hysteria, a viral urban legend. But then, last Tuesday, I was walking home from work. The streetlights flickered, casting long, dancing shadows. As I rounded the corner onto my street, I saw it. Standing under the lone, sputtering lamp in front of my house.

**Me.**

It was wearing my clothes, my jacket, even my slightly scuffed sneakers. Its posture was identical to mine – one hand shoved in a pocket, head tilted just so. But its face… its face was a landscape of pure, unadulterated horror. The eyes were my eyes, but dead, vacant. And the smile. Oh, God, the smile. It stretched, wider than any human mouth could possibly stretch, pulling the corners of its lips up towards its temples, revealing a glistening expanse of gums and teeth that seemed to go on forever in the dim light. It wasn’t a smile of joy or malice; it was a smile of utter, inhuman **comprehension**. Like it knew something I didn’t, something terrible and final.

It didn't move. It just stood there, watching my house, watching the very spot where I was about to be. I froze, my blood turning to ice. Every instinct screamed at me to run, to scream, to do anything but stand there and stare at the grotesque parody of myself. But I couldn’t. My feet were rooted to the pavement.

I don't know how long we stood there, two identical figures under the flickering streetlight, one living, one… an abomination. The silence stretched, thick and suffocating, broken only by the frantic pounding of my own heart. And then, as if an invisible string had been cut, it slowly, deliberately, turned its head. Its dead eyes met mine.

The smile widened, if that was even possible. It was a silent, terrifying acknowledgment. A greeting from the void. And in that instant, I knew. It wasn't just watching my house. It was watching for **me**.

I don’t know what it wants. I don’t know what happens when it finally catches you, when it decides its long vigil is over. All I know is that I haven't been able to sleep since that night. Every shadow is a potential threat, every reflection a doorway to that grinning horror. I check the locks obsessively, peer through the peephole before opening the door, and I never, ever look in the mirrors anymore.

Because sometimes, late at night, when the street outside my window is dark and still, I swear I can feel its gaze. And I know, with a bone-deep certainty, that it's still out there. Still watching. Still smiling that impossible, ear-to-ear smile. And I wonder, when it finally decides to make its move, will I even know it's not a reflection until it's too late?",1,1750313086.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

Filed under: Structural Grief | Narrative Holes | What Isn’t Written

The first time someone mentioned her, it was in a review.

“Compelling prose,” it said, “but an odd absence at the center. Who is the woman everyone’s reacting to, yet who never appears?”

I stared at that line for a long time.
Longer than I’d like to admit.
Because I hadn’t written a woman like that.
Not intentionally.
So I opened the manuscript again.
At first, everything seemed fine.
Characters where they should be.
Scenes paced, conflicts clear.
But then I noticed the shapes.
Whole conversations orbiting a missing voice.
Arguments that began mid-sentence.
Objects without origin stories—a scarf, a coffee mug, a song hummed in two separate chapters.
And then:

“She wouldn’t have let this happen,” one character muttered.
“She always said August was too quiet,” another whispered.
Both lines unprompted. Both lines unsourced.
I searched the manuscript for her name.
Nothing.
But the shape of her was there.
A negative space, pressed deep into the narrative like a body into memory foam.

I tried to write her in.
I gave her dialogue.
Backstory.
Even a name: Mara.
She didn’t stay.
Her scenes warped the pacing.
The font glitched—turned serif mid-sentence.
The dialogue tags detached, floated.
My writing software crashed twice.
By the third attempt, her words autocorrected to ellipses.
She became a parenthetical.
Then a pronoun.
Then nothing.

One night I printed a draft and laid the pages across my apartment floor, trying to trace her shape.
Chapter 3 collapsed without her.
Chapter 7 ended in silence.
Chapter 11 was just:
(They look at each other, but nothing is said.)
Her presence was a gravity well.
Everything bent toward where she wasn’t.

I found a voice memo in my notes folder. One I didn’t remember recording.
Just static.
And under the hiss: humming.
Familiar.
Almost warm.
When I tried to delete it, the file renamed itself:
“She Was Here.mp3”

Other things started shifting.
A receipt tucked into an old book. On the back, in a looping script I didn’t recognize:
Don’t forget the candles.
An old text draft, timestamped 3:14 a.m.:
Are you awake? I dreamed of her again. This time she spoke.
A single line, scribbled in my journal’s margin:
You didn’t fail to write her. You wrote around her.

In the final chapter, I had written:
“Everyone who mattered was there.”
But that sentence never sat right.
I deleted it.
Stared at the blinking cursor.
Typed something else.
Deleted it again.
Eventually, I closed the document.
Later that night, I woke to find a printed page on my desk.
I hadn’t touched the printer.
The text read:
“You built the story to fit her shape.
That’s why it holds.”
Beneath it, in faint type:
[Unwritten.]

I don’t try to name her anymore.
I know better.
Some stories don’t begin with a character.
They begin with a loss so precise
you can only write what surrounds it.
And sometimes, that’s enough.
Sometimes, the shape of what's missing
is the only thing
that makes the page

The literal only thing I did differently today was enjoy a relatively large cup of coffee today, let's say a Starbucks grande as an example. McDonald's brand. 🤷🏻‍♀️

-Coffee is a diuretic capable of lowering blood pressure.

-Topamax shouldn't be taken with Hydrochlorothiazide because it is also a diuretic and will lower your blood pressure which will result in your medication levels being higher, and lower your potassium levels at the same time.

-Google keeps saying that coffee isn't capable of doing the same thing as Hydrochlorothiazide regardless of the fact that they're both freaking diuretics.

I don't drink caffeine that often, and when I do it's minimal so today was definitely more than my body would normally get, and I got the same tingles that I got in the first month of being on this stupid medication. Wouldn't that mean it's safe to say that yeah the caffeine lowered my blood pressure and upped my medication levels and made me tingle again?! Am I crazy? What other reason would I be tingling again?

It’s flexible and comfortable, but it can also be isolating at times. Great company swag can help with that. Swag can also have a point. It’s about forging a connection, raising spirits, and demonstrating to your remote team that they are appreciated. Here are some thoughtful and fun [**remote team gift ideas**](https://www.socialimprints.com/corporate-swag) that can make a big impact.

**Stay Charged with Useful Tech**

Nothing ruins a workday more than a dead electronic device. **Branded portable chargers** are an ideal gift for the remote worker. They keep your team powered whether they are working from home, in a coffee shop, or while on the go. Go for slick designs that highlight your brand while staying lightweight and practical.

**Create Inspiring Workspaces**

Nothing makes it easier to focus and be productive than a neat desk. You might also want to consider **branded desk accessories**, such as custom mouse pads, pen holders, or even trendy notebooks. These small items will make your team feel more professional even from their makeshift home office. It also puts a little bit of your company’s personality into their world.

**Make It Personal**

Put a personal stamp on your gifts and show your team how much you care. Custom laptop accessories, including keyboard covers, webcam covers, or laptop sleeves, can add function while providing style. Having these items personalized with a name or initials gives them a personal touch and makes them feel special and known. It also demonstrates your company went above and beyond.

**Celebrate with Virtual Swag**

Have an online company event on the horizon? Don't miss the opportunity to send some **virtual event swag**. You can mail care packages beforehand with snacks, drink tumblers, or branded gear. And it makes everyone feel included and connected, despite the screen. Add a whimsical message or a note to bring it all together.

**Say “Thank You” Like You Mean It**

Gratitude goes a long way. Whether your team just scored a big win or could just use a little bit of recognition, **virtual employee appreciation gifts** can go a long way to help lift spirits. Be creative with things like wellness kits, coffee subscriptions, or even digital gift cards combined with a physical gift. It’s an easy and direct way to say, “We see your hard work.""

**Choosing the Best Swag**

If you’re choosing swag, focus on what would be useful. The **best company swag for employees** should reflect your brand while also serving a practical use on a day-to-day basis. Look at trends, colors, packaging - it all counts. And remember to factor in variety and inclusivity, too. Make each gift feel more thoughtful by giving options that are personal or by personalizing based on a recipient’s interests. Whether it’s eco-friendly stuff, products to keep you well, or tech gadgets, selecting the right swag shows you know and take care of your team’s needs.

**Wrapping It Up**

Just because you work from home doesn’t mean your team has to be disconnected. With the right swag, you can have an even  stronger culture, show appreciation, and bring some fun to their home workspace. Whether it’s **personalized laptop accessories** or branded portable chargers, your gifts can brighten their day and keep them motivated. Make swag meaningful, and your team will thank you!",0,1750312653.0,remotework,0,0.5,False

\~Joan\~

“This place is... wow,” I muttered as we entered the house, it had floor to ceiling windows, a fireplace and....well, it was perfect.

But something felt slightly off.

“So... how did you know about this place?” I asked Rhoda, who sat on the couch while I walked towards the window and stared down at the view of Spain.

“Well, this is one of Aaron's properties,” she chuckled. I nodded, then paused.

My stomach dropped. What?

“He doesn’t know we're here. I have the spare keys to the building. I mean, why ask when I can just walk in?” Rhoda said, glancing at me with a small smile on her face.

“This is Aaron's house?” I asked slowly. She turned around fully, raising a brow at me.

“Yeah, it’s his.” Her voice was quiet. ""What is it?""

I pinched the bridge of my nose, disbelief washing over me. The fuck?

“I can't believe you brought me to Aaron's house of all places,” I muttered. For God's sake, she knows what her brother was like and still she went ahead and brought me to his house?

Rhoda sat up straighter, her smile falling.

“Exactly why I said he has no idea we’re here. Jo, your feud with my brother is seriously getting ridiculous.”

“Oh, really? You think this is ridiculous?” I snapped, crossing my arms. “Have you forgotten the time we both landed in jail and he bailed you out, leaving me there to rot?”

Rhoda opened her mouth to speak, but I cut her off. “Or the time we crashed his party, and guess who got blamed for that? Me! He called me a bad influence, told me to stop dragging you into ‘bad things.’ He acts like I’m the villain in your life.” I gritted my teeth.

“Jo...” Rhoda trailed off.

“And now you bring me to his house? You really think I won’t get blamed for this too?” I asked. If I had known, I wouldn't have followed her.

Okay maybe, I still would have. I mean who would turn down a trip to Spain? But we would have booked a hotel room.

Not here. Not this.

Rhoda stood up and turned around the couch, walking towards me.

I’m wrong and I'm really sorry. I didn’t think. I just wanted us to enjoy our girls' trip, and this house is... well, it’s perfect.” She gestured around the house, but I barely glanced at it. “I should have talked to you about it. You’re right.”

I let out a sigh.

""What next?"" I asked and her shoulders sagged.

""Well, we could still stay here. He doesn’t know we're here. So...."" she wringled her fingers together.

""We could still leave if you want,"" she added.

""If he doesn't know we're here we could stay,"" I muttered. Well, he wouldn't just pop up in Spain now, would he?

Rhoda grinned, and I could see the relief on her face.

“We're not gonna stay inside all day now or are we?"" She asked, a glint in her eyes. I pursed my lips.

“Please tell me we’re going to see Barcelona,” She added as she grabbed my hand, and she nodded a little too fast.

“Of course! We would,"" I muttered as we dragged our luggage to the room were we would be staying.

Despite all that Rhoda had said, I still felt slightly uncomfortable. Knowing the house belonged to Aaron just didn't sit right with me.

And hell, I knew something was bound to go wrong. Wherever the man was concerned, something always went wrong.

After freshening up, we decided to explore the neighborhood. At least, we should familiarize ourselves with the vicinity since we'd be staying for a month.

“Tomorrow, we'll go see the Tower, yeah?,” Rhoda asked as we walked back after wandering through a few blocks.

I gave a small nod.

Rhoda sighed and tipped her head back, feeling the cool evening breeze wash over her face, she closed her eyes, a small smile playing on her face.

“It’s nice to breathe fresh air outside of New York,” she sighed. I glanced over at her and followed her lead, raising my head and staring at the dark sky.

Rhoda suddenly opened her eyes, and stared at me. I could see the mischievous glint in them.

“The first one back to the house gets a paid manicure at the fanciest salon in the city!” she said, and before I could process what she said, she darted off.

A laugh escaped me as I ran after her. But oh boy, the girl was goddamn fast.

Who knows? Maybe I would enjoy this trip after all.

We stumbled into the compound and Rhoda pushed the door open stepping in.

I followed after her but she stopped abruptly that I crashed into her back.

""What's it?"" I whispered as the color drained from her face.

She remained silent and I peeked at the inside from over her shoulder.

And there he was, in the living room, swirling a glass of something dark. Whiskey maybe.

His eyes were cold and his expression closed off as he finished the last of his drink, slamming the glass on the table.

I was surprised it didn't shatter. Rhoda shuddered lightly while a small frown crept up my face.

Aaron.

The devil had arrived.

# Caught In The Middle

\~Joan\~

Everywhere was silent. No one said a word, we just stared at each other. For a minute, or two?

But that did nothing to ease the hard expression on Aaron's face. His eyes just darted between us.

How is he here? How did he even know we were here? Rhoda had insisted he didn’t have a clue—she hadn’t even told him.

“Rhoda...” His voice was low and cold, just as it had always been. He wasn't one to talk much, but once he did, it carried a certain confidence. “Care to explain what you're doing in 'my' house, without my permission?”

Rhoda was silent. If I didn’t know her so well, I might’ve believed the man across from us wasn’t her brother. Seven years wasn’t much of a gap, but Aaron made it seem like a big deal.

He made everything seem like a big deal.

His gaze moved to me, and I mentally braced myself for what I knew was coming next.

“And you,” he muttered, his tone grew a little bit colder. I could practically sense his annoyance. “Still following my sister around, I see.”

“Okay. Before you get this all wrong, I had no idea this was your house,” I said quietly, elbowing Rhoda.

This was not the time for her to stay fucking silent.

“No idea?” He interrupted, standing up. And oh boy, the man was on the taller side.

His height could be imposing at times too.

""You want me to believe this wasn't your idea?"" He asked and I pressed my lips together.

There we go.

I drew in a deep breath, ignoring the annoyance already building inside of me.

“Like I said, I had no idea this house belonged to you until we were here,"" I muttered.

And Rhoda still remained silent.

""And whose idea was it?"" He asked, his eyes not leaving me.

""Maybe if you weren't such a controlling bastard, your sister would have told you we were going to use your house,” I bit out.

Okay. If Rhoda wasn't going to speak, I wasn’t going to keep silent and take the blame for something I knew nothing about.

Rhoda’s eyes darted from me to her brother. She dreaded him.

Aaron took a step toward me, his eyes grew darker. Rhoda raised her hand, stepping in front of me.

“Aaron, stop—please,” she said quietly. “She's right. This was my idea. Don’t take it out on her.”

She took a step closer to him while I took one step backward.

“You’ve always been trouble, Joan. From the very first moment I saw you, I knew you'd be trouble,” his voice had a chill to it.

I clenched my fists, resisting the urge to go all out on him. I was in his house after all.

“You know what?” I said after a while, taking a step forward and meeting his glare head-on.

“Fuck. You.” I raised my middle finger, thrusting it in his face before storming off toward the room where we’d kept our bags.

There was no way I was letting Aaron ruin the one vacation I’d had in a year. I was going to enjoy my trip—without his godforsaken, insufferably handsome face hovering around.

I yanked my clothes out of the closet, shoving them into my bag in quick movements.

I didn’t care that it was late; I would find a hotel and spend the night somewhere else, anywhere but here.

From the hallway, I heard Rhoda’s muffled yells—she’d finally shaken off the shock, but I didn’t care anymore.

“Aaron, don’t you dare! You can’t keep being a jackass to her every time she’s around!”

Her voice grew closer, footsteps approached as I zipped my bag shut, ready to leave.

The door swung open, and there they were—Aaron just standing there and Rhoda behind him, looking exasperated.

Their gazes flicked to my packed bag, and Rhoda’s eyes turned glassy as she took a step forward.

“Jo...” she whispered, her voice breaking.

I looked at her, ignoring Aaron completely.

“Just so you know,” I said calmly, “your brother is an asshole. And yeah, I’ll text you my address in the morning.”

I stepped forward, waiting for them to move out of my way.

Aaron’s voice stopped me.

“You’re not leaving at this time of night,” he said, not a statement, but an order.

I stared at him, hoping the daggers in my eyes could pierce him to death.

It would hurt Rhoda... But it was worth the try.

“No,” I said annoyed. “You don’t get to dictate what I do.”

His jaw tightened, and a flicker of something dark crossed his face.

“Try me, Joan. See if I won’t drag you back here myself. And trust me, it isn't something you'd enjoy,” he muttered, and somehow the threat sent warmth curling in my lower belly.

Damn him.

“You’re going to leave in the morning,” he continued. “I’m not letting you storm off in anger and end up getting murdered somewhere, not like it would affect me. And besides...” He glanced at Rhoda. “We still need to talk.”

With that, he turned and left the room. I blinked at Rhoda, stunned.

“Did he just threaten me?” I asked.

Rhoda stepped forward, throwing her arms around me.

“I’m sorry, Jo,” she whispered, her voice breaking slightly. “I never meant for this to happen. I shouldn’t have dragged you into this.”

I sighed, wrapping my arms around her.

“It’s not entirely your fault,” I murmured.

As much as I hated her brother, I couldn’t deny that he was disgustingly handsome.

“Just stay for the night,” Rhoda pleaded. “Please.”

I sighed again.

“Fine. I’ll stay,” I muttered. I wasn’t staying because of Aaron’s thinly veiled warning or the strange warmth his threat had sparked in me.

I was staying because Rhoda asked me to.

Not because of Aaron. Definitely not because of him.

# Before The Weekend

\~Aaron\~

I was an early riser... Or maybe that was the wrong word to use. I had insomnia, so sleeping was a problem.

Which explained why I was in the kitchen by 4 a.m., fully dressed in my usual outfit—a suit—brewing coffee. I walked into the sitting room, glancing at the windows. It was already dawn. The sky was glowing red, a warning of the day ahead.

Soon enough, the girls would be awake. Speaking of ""girls""... I took a sip of my coffee before walking toward the window, staring down at the quiet city, save for a few cars and early risers moving like ghosts through the streets.

I’d had a business meeting in Barcelona, which explained why I was in Spain. I was supposed to be finishing up by the weekend and returning to New York on Monday. I should’ve been thinking about work, logistics, my schedule. But I wasn’t.

No, I was thinking about what I’d come back to—my house invaded by my sister and her best friend.

Rhoda always had a streak of stubbornness in her, but it never flared into anything unmanageable. Until she met Joan. I had to give Joan credit for pulling Rhoda out of her grief after our parents died. But Joan didn’t stop there. She had a way of encouraging the wild, reckless side of my sister, feeding it like gasoline to a flame.

And the fact that Joan hated me? Well, that was just a bonus. I overheard her once telling Rhoda that I always looked like I had a stick up my ass. She’d go out of her way to ignore me or start an argument—anything to get under my skin.

And damn if it didn’t work.

I didn’t even realize how long I’d been standing there, staring out at nothing, my coffee growing cold. A movement in the house snapped me back. My body tensed, instinctively alert.

The house was big enough for all of us to avoid each other, but I could sense her. Joan. I wasn’t even looking, but I could feel her presence, the heat of her gaze boring into my back.

Closer, closer, until the room fell into that particular kind of silence that only she could create. I didn’t turn around.

She didn’t speak. She just moved past me, toward the fireplace, her movements slow and deliberate, like she had all the time in the world. I eventually turned and pinned her with a cool, assessing look.

Her ginger-red hair was piled into a messy bun on top of her head, strands escaping to frame her face. She closed her eyes, soaking in the warmth of the fire, her lashes dark against her pale skin. Those eyes, when they opened, were sharp and cunning—like a fox’s.

I moved to the island that separated the kitchen from the dining area, annoyed at myself for noticing things about her I had no business noticing. The quiet between us was thick, tense.

She stood, her movements unhurried, and walked toward me. Our eyes met—green on black—before she quickly glanced away. My gaze followed her, against my better judgment, lingering on the way her sleep shirt clung to her body, the curve of her legs in those damn shorts that barely reached mid-thigh.

She looked good in the morning, like she always did. Too good.

“If you’re done ogling me, move out of my way,” she said, her voice flat, eyes narrowed in a scowl.

I raised the mug to my mouth, taking a sip of bitter, cold coffee, eyes still on her. “This is my house,” I replied, matching her tone. “I can’t be in your way.”

Her scowl deepened, her eyes flashing with something sharper than anger. For anyone else, the look she gave me would have been enough to send them running. But not me.

She squared her shoulders, lifting her chin as if daring me to back down. I didn’t. She wasn’t tall enough to reach my height, not even on her best day, but she didn’t need height to hold her ground.

Fists clenched, lips flattened into a hard line, her whole body practically vibrating with the effort it took not to lash out. It didn’t take much to rile her up, especially if it was coming from me.

She let out a sharp huff, her gaze slicing away from mine as she moved around the island, heading for the kitchen. I didn’t turn to follow, but I knew exactly what she was doing.

Joan Madison wasn’t a morning person without her coffee. In that way, at least, we were alike.

My sister, Rhoda, appeared a moment later, her chestnut hair a wild mess, her eyes heavy with sleep.

I knew both girls slept in the same room and on the same bed. Leaving me wondering why Joan looked like that and Rhoda —like this.

She mumbled a groggy, “Morning,” as she brushed past me and stood next to Joan, who wordlessly handed her a mug.

Rhoda smiled, leaning into Joan’s shoulder as she took a sip. The sight nearly made me roll my eyes.

Rhoda turned to me, noticing that I hadn’t responded to her greeting. Her brow furrowed in confusion, and she just stared at me for a beat too long.

“We’re leaving today,” she said, her voice quiet but firm. My stomach twisted into a knot at her words. Joan didn’t even spare me a glance.

I checked my watch, taking a long stride toward the couch, my mind already racing. “Stay,” I said, my tone flat, almost indifferent.

Rhoda’s eyes widened in surprise, her sleepy expression disappearing as she processed what I’d said. “I’ll be leaving by the weekend,” I added, grabbing my suitcase.

I glanced at Joan, just long enough to catch her tense posture, before I turned back to Rhoda. She looked like she was caught between confusion and mild guilt, but Joan? Joan’s expression didn’t waver. If anything, she seemed more irritated.

Without another word, I headed for the door, suitcase in hand. I didn’t trust Joan. Not even a little bit. And I sure as hell wasn’t about to leave them here without keeping tabs on them.

I wasn’t that foolish.

# What Would You Do?

\~ Joan \~

I rolled my eyes as soon as he left, placing my mug on the counter. Rhoda huffed out a laugh, as she leaned on the island, a knowing smile tugging at her lips.

“He can be insufferable at times... But, he’s got a heart of gold,” Rhoda said, eyeing me from the side of her eyes.

I said nothing. Because I wasn’t going to agree with her that Aaron had a heart of gold.

Nope.

I was convinced he didn’t even have one,, to begin with. All I ever saw was his coldness, his need for control. How she could see past that, I didn’t know.

“You’re staying, right?” she asked, and I glanced at her as I rinsed the mug, trying to focus on something other than Aaron.

She shifted on her feet, as I stared at her from under my lashes.

“I mean, he’ll be gone by the weekend... that’s just two days away,” she added, a little too quickly. “We could have the whole building to ourselves,” she gushed, silently begging me to stay.

I swallowed nothing, dabbing my hands on a towel as I considered her offer.

As much as I wanted to leave to avoid Aaron's presence, the idea of just Rhoda and me, with no one else, was tempting.

“Rhoda, I...”

“Please...” Rhoda pleaded, clasping both of her hands together and giving me her best puppy eyes.

A tiny smile broke out on my face as hope lit up her eyes.

“I’ll be staying...” I said, watching her light up with relief. Her smile was so genuine it sent a pang through my heart.

“Just because the asshole is leaving,” I added, and she nodded, as if agreeing would make sure nothing could spoil our plans.

She tugged on my hair lightly before scurrying off to the room, muttering a few words as she left.

I shook my head, picking up her mug and rinsing it off.

As much as I adored her, Rhoda could be impulsive, living in her own world where everything works out. I, on the other hand, was always bracing for impact.

Rhoda was like family to me, and even though Aaron seemed bent on driving a wedge between us, we’d always been the kind of duo that bounced back, stronger than before.

That’s why I’d stay. For her. Not for him.

Oh yeah, I’m staying. As much as the house was beautiful, its owner was still a dickhead.

\---

We’d explored the city of Madrid, and just like in the papers, it was beautiful. But there was something about being there in person, that took my breath away.

The clock tower was beautiful and it explained why the citizens of Spain always flocked around it.

There was a certain magic to this place that made me forget, even if just for a moment, about everything waiting back at the house.

By the time we’d finished going around, seeing the Plaza Mayor, the royal palace, the El Retiro Park... it was already getting dark.

“It’s 5 p.m.,” Rhoda muttered, glancing at her phone. I stood, staring at the park, my body sweaty and tingling with exhaustion, but the excitement still strummed in my veins.

“We should head back,” I said, wiping my brow, but when I glanced at her, Rhoda was smiling mischievously.

“What is it?” I asked, narrowing my eyes at her. There was something off about that grin.

She looked down at her phone again, the excitement on her face was palpable and far beyond the thrill of sightseeing.

“Lucas is around. He asked me to meet him,” she said with a little laugh like it was the most casual thing in the world.

I stared at her like she’d suddenly lost her mind. “You’re kidding, right?”

I knew Rhoda had an ulterior motive when she picked Spain for our vacation. She’d been chatting with this stranger for the last two months, and I had a sinking feeling this trip had less to do with seeing Madrid and more to do with finally meeting him.

“It’s dangerous,” I said, my voice firmer now. Her smile faltered.

“He isn’t, Jo. He’s actually really friendly,” she muttered, but I rolled my eyes. It was always the friendly ones that turned out to be a psychopath.

“I’m coming with you then,” I said, digging into my bag and coming up with a pepper spray and a taser.

A few passersby gave us weird looks, but I didn’t care. Better safe than sorry.

“Jo, this isn’t New York. This is Spain, one of the safest places in the world,” she pointed out, eyeing the items in my hand. “You can’t come with me. It’s our first time meeting, and I want to make a good impression,” she insisted.

“Good impression that could lead to death? Hell no,” I snapped, shivers running down my spine as memories I’d pushed to the back of my mind tried to resurface.

“Jo...”

“I don’t want to seem like a third wheel between you and Lucas, but you barely know the man,” I said, trying to get her to see my point.

“Fine.” She huffed, and I sighed in relief—until she snatched the pepper spray from my hand. “But I’m still going prepared,” she smirked, stuffing the can into her handbag.

“No. You’re not doing this. We’ll go back home and replan—”

But she was already leaning in to press a kiss on my cheek. “Unfortunately, Jo, you don’t get to decide for me,” she muttered before sauntering off. Mumbling a 'see you at home'... And then, she was gone.

I didn’t follow after her. I just stood there, watching her disappear into the crowd, and realized she was right. I couldn’t decide for her. She was a grown-ass woman. Even if I had my fears and concerns, that was my burden to carry, not hers.

Still, the nagging sense of dread followed me all the way to the subway, the weight in my stomach growing heavier with every step. I boarded the bus that would take me back to Aaron’s house. I’d input the address into my GPS so I wouldn’t get lost, but now I kind of wished I had.

The compound was eerily quiet when I arrived, and I regretted not sticking with Rhoda. Being alone, especially here, suddenly didn’t seem like such a great idea.

I pushed the door open and entered. My breath caught in my throat. Aaron was home, leaning on the kitchen island with a glass of something dark in his hand.

His eyes, as black as the night outside, washed over me before moving behind me, searching for Rhoda.

I ignored the flutter in my stomach, that stupid, traitorous pulse that sped up every time he looked at me, and headed toward my room.

“Where’s she?” He asked, his voice just as cold as his personality.

I could have pretended not to hear him, just walked into the room and closed the door behind me.

But she was his sister. If anything happened to her, he needed to know.

“She went to meet the man she’s been chatting with for two months,” I said as dryly as I could, not even bothering to look at him.

I felt his eyes on me.

“What do you mean by that?” There was a new edge to his voice now, one that made my skin prickle.

I rolled my eyes. “Exactly what you heard.”

“She went to meet a stranger, and you couldn’t stop her or go with her?” I could already sense his annoyance and oh well, it woke mine.

I straightened up, turning to face him with plastering a dry look.

“Rhoda is a grown woman. She decided to meet with someone she’d known for two months. Who am I to stop her?” I asked.

He dropped his glass on the counter and straightened to his full height, stepping forward.

The space between us wasn’t much, and I knew he could cross it in two strides if he wanted to.

“She isn’t a fucking grown woman who can just wander around a city she barely knows at night,” he growled, his voice low.

I tilted my head to the side, a cold smile tugging at the corner of my lips.

“If you’re so worried about her, why don’t you call her?” I said lightly, acting as though the tension buzzing between us didn’t set every nerve in my body on fire.

Before I could process what was happening, he was on me, shoving me against the window, my back slammed into the glass as his hand wrapped around my throat—not hard enough to hurt, but enough to send a message.

His nose flared, the anger radiating off him in waves. And yet, beneath that, something else simmered, something darker, more dangerous. My pulse raced and I knew he could feel it.

“I should’ve gotten rid of you when I had the chance,” he said, his voice thick and dripping with venom.

His chest pressed into mine, his hips close enough that I could feel the heat of his body.

“Maybe then, you wouldn’t have influenced her so badly.”

“Let go of me, Thompson,” I said, my voice cool. Not giving away how I felt on the inside.

He smirked, it was dangerous.

His grip around my neck tightened before he suddenly released me and spun me around. I gasped as my body hit the cold glass again.

This time, it was face first. My palms flattened against the window.

Aaron's chest pressed against my back, his body heat seeping into me. His hands slid down my arm, then my waist. I could feel his rough fingers against my hip. He was close, too close, and worse... I wanted more.

“What would you do,” he whispered “If I took you right here, right now, against this window? Make you beg me to let you come?”

My stomach tightened. Irritation, annoyance, and desire coursed through me. I should have pushed him away, should have told him to get off me, but I didn't. I instead arched into him.

I am in a place in my life where everyone in my life is transitioning to new commitments, while I am still piecing my life together.

I realized that I need to start looking outwards and meeting new people. Fresh perspectives, new faces to build new friendships, and more. I have been in my own world for so long, and I need to push myself out there.

To be clear, I:

* Am an ENFJ
* Love to go to the gym and take part in physical activities
* Like to try new foods, cafes, and beers occasionally
* Watch movies, tv shows and anime. Occasionally plays PC games too
* Get into random fixations like bags, Japanese stationary, etc. (My YouTube feed may be the reason)
* Can speak Tagalog, basic conversational Japanese (will need more practice to get back)
* Am not on social media for long periods of time. Teach me memes, I'm getting old
* Listen to hip hop, r&b, edm, j-pop, k-pop

I am looking:

* For a friend to work out with at Fitness World, or people to do rec sports with
* For someone to play FPS games, and other stuff too
* To attend some clubs/raves occasionally with
* To visit coffee spots on a Saturday, or drink beers on Friday nights
* To hang out by getting lost while walking, or at the driving range, whatever. If you think of it, I'm likely down unless I tell you straightforward
* To talk about anime and manga with. Big points if you like Bleach and One Piece
* Late night conversations and food runs on Friday & Saturday nights
* Someone to direct me how to pose for photos (trust, I can't do this myself)

(And What Actually Helps),"If your hangovers have been lasting longer than they used to—you’re not imagining it. The “two-day hangover” is real, especially if you’re over 30. The reason isn’t just dehydration or a slower metabolism. It goes deeper than that.

Here’s what’s actually going on:

* **NAD+ gets wiped out.** Every time your body processes alcohol, it burns through NAD+, a molecule your cells use to detox, repair, and make energy. When you run low, everything slows down—recovery included.
* **Inflammation spikes.** Alcohol ramps up cytokines (inflammatory messengers), especially in the brain. That’s the foggy, anxious, low-energy feeling that can linger for days.
* **Oxidative stress overloads your system.** Your liver is working overtime to process acetaldehyde (the toxic byproduct of alcohol), and that produces a ton of free radicals—causing cellular stress and damage.
* **Mitochondria underperform.** These are your energy engines. Alcohol messes with their function, which is why you feel so drained even after sleeping.

This isn’t just a “hangover”—it’s a cellular traffic jam. And the older you get, the harder it is for your body to bounce back.

That’s why I started taking **NMN + Resveratrol** the morning after drinking (or honestly, even before). NMN helps restore NAD+ fast, and resveratrol turns on the genes that deal with stress and inflammation. It doesn’t just ease the symptoms—it helps *reverse* what caused them.

A 2-day hangover doesn’t mean you’re broken. It just means your recovery system needs support. And for me, that started with giving my cells what they were missing.

Not electrolytes. Not another coffee. **NAD+ support.** That changed everything.",1,1750312568.0,LongevityStacks,0,1.0,False

You don’t want to waste the snowy scenery, so you take your little horse—bundled up in a red knit hat—and set up camp right outside your farmhouse.

You wake up in the morning inside your cozy silver camper. The snow has just stopped, and the sky is clear. First, a freshly brewed cup of coffee, then a slice of pink cake. You pitch a tent by the pond and build a snowman with the fluffy new snow. From a wooden crate, you pull out two carrots—one for the snowman’s nose, and one as a treat for your horse. All around you, the white snow is dotted with green Christmas trees, red holly bushes, giant orange pumpkins, a bright yellow tent, and pink-and-green candy canes.

At noon, you enjoy a Lucky Lunch and some pumpkin soup, followed by a cozy nap in your windproof, thick tent. In the afternoon, you settle into a plastic chair by the small pond, beer in hand, fishing rod ready. As the sky darkens, you light a campfire to cook your freshly caught fish, some seafood from the crab pots, and corn and potatoes you grew yourself. A few toasted marshmallows would be the perfect finishing touch.

Before you know it, night has fully fallen. The stars on a winter night shine especially bright. You cradle a mug of warmed milk and search the sky for the elusive *Winter Star*.

I need some perspective.

A couple of months ago, I suggested a baby name to my husband that I absolutely loved. It’s from a culture different to ours, and when I brought it up, he instantly shot it down. He was really firm, saying something like, “I’m not naming my kid a different culture’s name,” and made it clear it was a no. I was disappointed, but I respected his opinion and dropped it.

Fast forward two months later — out of nowhere — he brings up the exact same name, except this time, he says he likes it. I was confused and said, “Wait, didn’t you say you didn’t like that name?” And he straight up denied ever saying that. Maybe he genuinely forgot, maybe he didn’t. I let it go, and part of me was happy that we finally had a name we both liked… or so I thought.

Then, while chatting, I casually mentioned to my husband that my mum didn’t like the name — but I wasn’t seeking permission or anything. I was just making conversation. His response? “Oh, my mum likes the name!” That caught me off guard. Because now I’m starting to feel like the only reason he’s suddenly on board with the name is because his mum is.

Yesterday, we were having coffee at his parents’ place, and the name came up again. His mum said, “Oh, I like that name — it sounds a lot like [my husband’s name]!” And now it’s all clicking in my head.

I can’t help but feel like the name only became acceptable the moment his mother approved it. And here’s the kicker: she’s had a history of being way too involved in our marriage decisions. I didn’t realise how much influence she had until later, and ever since then I’ve been trying really hard to set boundaries and keep decisions between me and my husband.

Now I feel totally turned off this name, even though it’s one of the only ones we both seem to agree on. I don’t want to feel like my son’s name was chosen because it sounded nice to his grandmother or reminded her of her son.

Am I overthinking this? Do I bring this up with my husband again? Do I push for another name even if we haven’t agreed on one yet? Or do I just accept it since we both (kind of?) like it?

Any advice would really help.

When I first had symptoms in 2021, they started with basically a severe ""panic attack"" type episode after a night of drinking that just never went away. However, after time and with metoprolol/ivabradine, I became basically asymptomatic after about 6 months. I've been more or less asymptomatic since that time (bar some exercise intolerance and occasional tachycardia if I drink too much or have coffee etc).

I've had a recent worsening of my symptoms despite staying on my medication - basically, I had another random ""panic attack"" episode in February and have had sustained 24/7 tachycardia and this horrible ""anxiety"" feeling in my chest the *entire* time since then. The tachycardia and other POTS symptoms (exercise intolerance, fatigue etc) are annoying but I can manage it with medication etc and confident I could get it under control over time and building my strength back up etc.

It's the 24/7 ""anxiety"" feeling in my chest that is killing me. It is so uncomfortable and unrelenting. Sometimes it will be manageable and I can go about my day and not think about it too much, other times it's worse and can be debilitating. I'll often have bad episodes at night before bed (which makes me think it might be histamine or adrenaline dumping), but also sometimes seems connected to food and exercise. 

Seeking anyone else who has experienced this and can offer any support/tips. I'm thinking it's either a symptom of MCAS (as antihistamines seem to help + it appears  to be diet related at times and i've had other symptoms develop at the same time (GI and skin issues)), or that I have hyperPOTS and it's part of that (have never been diagnosed with a type).

I was confused and said, “Wait, didn’t you say you didn’t like that name?” And he straight up denied ever saying that. Maybe he genuinely forgot, maybe he didn’t. I let it go, and part of me was happy that we finally had a name we both liked… or so I thought.

Then, while chatting, I casually mentioned to my husband that my mum didn’t like the name — but I wasn’t seeking permission or anything. I was just making conversation. His response? “Oh, my mum likes the name!” That caught me off guard. Because now I’m starting to feel like the only reason he’s suddenly on board with the name is because his mum is.

Yesterday, we were having coffee at his parents’ place, and the name came up again. His mum said, “Oh, I like that name — it sounds a lot like [my husband’s name]!” And now it’s all clicking in my head.

I can’t help but feel like the name only became acceptable the moment his mother approved it. And here’s the kicker: she’s had a history of being way too involved in our marriage decisions. I didn’t realise how much influence she had until later, and ever since then I’ve been trying really hard to set boundaries and keep decisions between me and my husband.

Now I feel totally turned off this name, even though it’s one of the only ones we both seem to agree on. I don’t want to feel like my son’s name was chosen because it sounded nice to his grandmother or reminded her of her son.

Am I overthinking this? Do I bring this up with my husband again? Do I push for another name even if we haven’t agreed on one yet? Or do I just accept it since we both (kind of?) like it?

Any advice would really help.

I am returning to work tomorrow and i forgot that I don’t know if im able to tamp shots. We really have to hustle at my work and I thought two weeks would be fine because im an idiot and I don’t think the np really knows how much I have to work. I’m panicking right now 😭. I wont stock heavy things and such but I was just informed hr might not even give me accommodations bc its elective surgery. So yay. I genuinely hate this job tho and am just trying to save more money for when I move into my apartment next semester of college. Although most of my expenses should be covered by my college fund. I genuinely just want to quit because I hate this job and everyone is going to hate me because im not going to be fast. I don’t want to hurt myself and im not going to risk it for stupid coffee. I have a shift tomorrow morning early so I can’t even call my surgeon and ask if tampong shots is okay and they most likely won’t give me accommodations anyways. I didn’t tell people at my work im getting a boob job because it’s humiliating I told them im getting back surgery. So if hr says no then they will all know that I got an elective surgery. Im so tired I just want to quit and never go back but they put out the schedule for the next 2 weeks and I like some of the people at my job. I genuinely don’t know what to do im so upset.

### Introduction: The Mirage of Digital Nomad Wealth

Wealth. The word alone conjures images of infinity pools, MacBooks perched on Bali beaches, and a bank account that laughs at rent day. But is this the real story behind the digital nomad curtain? Or just another mirage shimmering in the Instagram sun?

Let’s torch the illusion and dig into the truth. Are digital nomads actually wealthy—or just really good at looking the part?

**_🌍 Curious if you’re sitting on untapped nomad income? Find out in 90 seconds! [Check your potential.](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)_**

### Defining “Wealthy” in the Nomadic Context

#### Financial benchmarks: What counts as rich?

Wealth isn’t a one-size-fits-all suit. For some, it’s six figures in a savings account. For others, it’s the ability to order extra guac without sweating the bill. In nomad circles, “wealthy” can mean earning enough to live comfortably in Thailand—or scraping by in Switzerland.

#### Wealth beyond money: Freedom as currency

Here, freedom is the new gold standard. The power to choose your view, your hours, your life. For digital nomads, autonomy often trumps assets. You can’t deposit sunsets, but you can collect them.

### The Digital Nomad Archetype: Fact vs. Fiction

#### Instagram illusions

Scroll through #digitalnomad and you’ll see a parade of curated perfection. But filters don’t show the WiFi drops, the missed flights, the client ghosting. The highlight reel is just that—a reel.

#### The real faces behind the laptops

Most nomads aren’t influencers. They’re coders, writers, designers, hustling in shared spaces, not luxury villas. The real story is more coffee stains than cocktails.

**_✈️ Think you could thrive as a digital nomad? Diagnose your potential in 90 seconds! [Take the test.](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)_**

### Income Streams: How Digital Nomads Make Money

#### Freelancers, founders, and remote employees

The digital nomad economy is a mosaic. Freelancers juggling gigs. Startup founders running lean. Remote employees clocking in from time zones their bosses can’t pronounce.

#### Passive income: Myth or method?

Passive income is the holy grail. But most nomads are still chasing it. Affiliate links, dropshipping, online courses—few hit the jackpot. Most grind.

### The Geography Game: Earning Dollars, Spending Pesos

#### Geoarbitrage explained

Earn in strong currencies. Spend in weak ones. That’s geoarbitrage—a nomad’s secret weapon. It’s the difference between ramen nights and rooftop dinners.

#### Cost of living hacks

From Southeast Asia to Eastern Europe, nomads hunt for value. Rent, food, transport—every dollar stretches further in the right zip code.

**_🌐 Wondering if your income could stretch further abroad? Diagnose your digital nomad income now! [Check here.](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)_**

### Expenses: The Hidden Costs of Nomadic Life

#### Flights, visas, and insurance

Cheap flights add up. Visas cost more than you think. Insurance? Non-negotiable. The road is paved with receipts.

#### The price of constant movement

Moving every month isn’t just exhausting—it’s expensive. Deposits, luggage fees, new SIM cards. The meter’s always running.

### The Wealth Spectrum: From Broke Backpacker to Crypto King

#### Shoestring survivors

Some nomads live on a shoestring, stretching every cent. Hostel beds, street food, bargain buses. Adventure on a budget.

#### Six-figure nomads

Others rake in six figures, living large in penthouses or hopping continents on a whim. Both exist. Most fall somewhere in between.

**_🔥 Ready to see if you’re closer to broke backpacker or crypto king? Diagnose your nomad income potential! [Try it now.](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)_**

### Barriers to Entry: Who Gets to Be a Nomad?

#### Privilege and passports

Not everyone gets a ticket to the nomad show. Western passports open doors. Others face walls. Privilege is the unspoken passport stamp.

#### Skills and access

Tech skills, language fluency, and a reliable laptop—these are the new gatekeepers. Without them, the dream stalls at the gate.

### The Gig Economy Trap: Precarity in Paradise

#### Feast or famine cycles

Some months, the gigs rain down. Others, it’s a drought. Feast or famine is the gig economy’s dirty secret.

#### Chasing clients, chasing rent

The hustle never sleeps. Land a client, lose a client, repeat. Security is a mirage.

### Saving and Investing: Do Nomads Build Wealth?

#### Retirement plans on the road

Few nomads have 401(k)s or pensions. Retirement planning is DIY, and most are winging it.

#### Emergency funds and financial safety nets

Rainy day funds are rare. When disaster strikes, it’s often a scramble, not a safety net.

### Taxes and Legal Limbo: The Bureaucratic Wild West

#### Tax optimization or tax evasion?

Navigating taxes as a nomad is a labyrinth. Some optimize. Others just hope no one notices.

#### Banking headaches

Opening accounts, moving money, avoiding fees—it’s a full-time job in itself.

**_🌟 Want to know if your finances are nomad-ready? Diagnose your income potential in 90 seconds! [Check here.](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)_**

### Community and Connection: Social Capital as Wealth

#### Networks over net worth

Connections open doors. The right Slack group can be worth more than a fat bank balance.

#### Trading stability for serendipity

Nomads trade roots for randomness. Sometimes it pays off. Sometimes it stings.

### Burnout and Longevity: Can You Nomad Forever?

#### Hustle culture fatigue

The grind wears thin. Burnout is real. Not everyone makes it to year five.

#### The return home: voluntary or forced?

Many nomads eventually return home. Some by choice, others by necessity. The road isn’t always a one-way ticket.

**_🚀 Ready to see if you can outlast the burnout? Diagnose your digital nomad income potential! [Try it now.](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)_**

### Success Stories: Outliers or New Normal?

#### Millionaire nomads

They exist. They’re loud. But they’re not the norm.

#### The silent majority

Most nomads are quietly getting by, not getting rich. Their stories rarely make headlines.

### The Anti-Establishment Allure: Escaping the Rat Race

#### Rebellion against 9-to-5

Nomadism is a middle finger to the corporate grind. Freedom is the rallying cry.

#### The price of freedom

But freedom isn’t free. It costs security, routine, and sometimes, sanity.

### Technology as the Great Equalizer (or Divider)

#### Access to remote work

Tech opens doors for some, slams them for others. Not everyone gets a seat at the remote table.

#### The digital divide

Connectivity isn’t universal. The gap is real—and growing.

**_🌍 Wondering if you’re ready for the remote revolution? Diagnose your digital nomad income now! [Check here.](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)_**

### Wealth Perception vs. Reality: The Social Media Effect

#### Highlight reels vs. real life

What you see online is a curated fantasy. The reality is messier, grittier, more human.

#### The pressure to perform

The need to look successful is its own trap. Many nomads feel it. Few admit it.

### The Future of Nomadic Wealth: Trends and Predictions

#### Remote work revolution

Remote work is here to stay. The nomad tribe is growing.

#### Economic uncertainty

But the world is wobbly. Recessions, pandemics, and policy shifts can upend everything.

### How to Diagnose Your Own Nomad Income Potential

#### Self-assessment tools

Not sure where you stand? Tools exist to help you gauge your earning power and readiness for the road.

#### Planning your leap

Preparation is everything. Know your numbers before you book that one-way flight.

### Conclusion: Rethinking Wealth in the Nomadic Age

Wealth isn’t just money. It’s freedom, flexibility, and the audacity to live on your own terms. Digital nomads aren’t all wealthy—but they’re rich in ways that can’t be measured in dollars alone.",1,1750312168.0,NomadicLifestyleGlobe,0,1.0,False

1lf31s5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Finland/comments/1lf31s5/we_want_move_to_oulu_from_estonia/,We want move to Oulu from Estonia,"**Hi!**  
I'm an IT specialist from Estonia. I have a wife and a child. I'm 35 years old.  
My native language is Russian, but I also speak a bit of Estonian and fairly good English.  
In Estonia (Tallinn), we own a 3-room apartment. I earn around €3000–€4000 per month from freelancing (there’s still room to grow, and I believe I’ll be making even more).

My family and I are planning to move to Finland, specifically somewhere in the north — we’re considering Oulu (or Rovaniemi as a last resort).

**Reasons why we want to move:**

1. **The threat of war with Russia.** Yes, some might find this funny, but we’re genuinely concerned — we have a child and want to be farther away from Estonia. I understand that Finland also borders Russia, but at least Finland doesn’t treat Russians as terribly or speak as negatively about Russia as the Baltic states do (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania).
2. **Russophobia.** We are Russians born in Estonia. There is real russophobia here, and we don’t like it. I understand that there’s almost nothing in Russian in Finland, but we’re willing to learn the language.

**My questions for you, folks:**

1. Which northern cities would you recommend besides Oulu and Rovaniemi? We're specifically interested in the **north**; the south is not an option. We love the north (I could never live in a place like Spain). We're not afraid of boredom since we're more introverted, although a tiny village wouldn’t suit us either.
2. What can you tell me about **Oulu**? How safe is it overall, and are there any particular areas to be cautious about? Are there any dangerous neighborhoods?
3. What do people usually do in their **free time**?
4. What kind of **activities are available for children**?
5. If we sell our apartment in Estonia, we could get around €130,000–€150,000. I’ve seen that it’s possible to buy something decent in Oulu for that amount — is it true? We’d need housing of at least 75 square meters.
6. I own a **car** — how are things with car services there? Any issues?
7. Will **English** be enough for me for now? I don’t speak Finnish yet.
8. What are **schools** like for children?
9. How is the **nightlife**? I don’t like bars or clubs, but I often sit in the car at night working on my laptop. Is it possible to, say, grab a coffee at a gas station late at night?
10. This is very important — do you know how we could **legalize** our stay in Finland? What kind of income do we need? I’m not a salaried employee and my wife doesn’t work either.
11. Roughly how much **money per month** is needed for a family of three, assuming we buy our own home and don’t pay rent?

Please don’t try to discourage us.  
I know that every country has its downsides, but I’m sure Finland is a great country — especially since we’re neighbors, we have relatives there, and it’s easy to travel if needed.

Thanks in advance for your answers and sorry for the many questions — I’d just really like to get as much information as possible.",0,1750311718.0,Finland,21,0.27,False

Commit. Hard.
Six month subscription. ( https://rotation.coffee/ )
No brakes. No rearview mirrors.
Because once this momentum takes off, you’ll never see coffee the same again.

Subscribers already won.
You locked in early. You got the deal.
Now it’s time to double down.

To everyone still on the sidelines
Have a good life.
You will not be missed.

Month to month subscriptions will stay open at $40+ shipping. You will be taxed for not committing to 6 month prepaid.

But truthfully I’m done entertaining on the fence people. I don’t really care at this point.
I’ve proven this concept and my capability.
This isn’t some side project anymore

⸻

The Next Evolution Is Already in Motion

A la carte drops will return soon
Only once I lock roasters into direct auto shipments into Rotation HQ

Next release: Japan
It goes to subscribers first
Anything leftover? First come, first served for the public.

I’m building backend tools so subscribers can see and preorder drops before the world even hears about them. (In the next 60 days)

You’ll have 48 hours to preview and secure coffees like Acid Tokyo before launch. That means better decisions, no FOMO, and exclusive access because you committed. 

⸻

Why Subscriptions Matter

Your prepaid subscription isn’t just convenience.
it’s the ultimate qualify to see if you’re about it.
It gives me room to breathe, focus, and go all in
No second guessing. No unstable buying projections.
Just sharper sourcing, clearer road map, and great beans every time

⸻

What I Want to Build With You

This is bigger than drops

I want to host private coffee workshops. Fly out, meet roasters, brewers, renegades shaking up the industry
I want to gather 1000 beans from 1000 top roasters and blind taste them together.
No Q grader needed. 
Just real palates who care

Every dollar I make is going back into refining this beast until Rotation becomes a behemoth
In the future I want to PAY members to test,
review, make compelling content, and shape 
the future of coffee.
You drink. 
You get paid. 
You help build

I have the tools. The team. The black Amex
But I need A plus players who move like obsessive, not fair weather casuals.

⸻

Here’s Where It’s Going

Now that I have your shipping info, I’m sending bags straight from roasters to your doorstep
You decide what makes the cut
You shape the lineup

This isn’t a charity
This is a takeover
I want to dominate coffee in sourcing, 
in hardware, in influence
Then build shops across the country where the coffee is free, but only if you’re part of the movement.

Future Rotation gear/hardware equipment will be the clear choice for you to purchase not because it’s branded, but because it was built with your fingerprints on it.

⸻

Final Word

The industry’s stale
The leaders are lazy
And the time to take over is now

If you’re with me, lock in
If you’re not, don’t expect another invite

Thank you for the belief
Let’s make history

It’s been about 1.5 months, so still very early. He’s got a lot of green flags in that he’s easy to talk to, an open book who will answer any question I have with complete honesty, makes me feel super safe, reliable if you need a favor, and a gentleman on dates. BUT the one thing I am having a hard to wrapping my head around is his near constant need to start arguments over the most mundane things just so he can debate and “win them”. I mean nothing will end the argument, including telling him you’d rather not debate a particular topic. He will push and push and only stop when you say he is right. Point in case, he wanted to debate and argue about why it was wrong to put his foot on my coffee table. After explaining 10 different ways why an adult 30+ year old man should know better than to put his foot on someone else’s coffee table he just kept saying things like “your reasoning is wrong, you have to have things your way or the high way, that answer doesn’t make sense” etc. this isn’t the first time he’s done this either. Eventually I said, what do I need to say for you to please stop doing this? And he said I would have to tell him he is right. He claims he likes me for being smart/ intelligent and that he likes women with different opinions, but it’s starting to feel like he wants to prove to himself that he’s smarter than me but winning these pointless arguments through constant nagging until I give in an say how right he is. I’ve tried to avoid the debates but he gets mad at that too and says I’m shutting him down. I really like him but There’s no getting around this. It’s starting to tarnish my attraction to him and honestly I’m not sure if I should move on or hope he stops.

Hey everyone, my car was stolen late last night or possibly early this morning. I’m heartbroken. I parked it right on De Longpre Ave and N Detroit St in Hollywood (90046). 

It’s a black 2013 Infiniti sedan with South Carolina plates (MKD107). I parked it legally so no red curb, no driveway, and no street sweeping signs. 

I’ve already checked OPGLA, called multiple tow yards (including Hollywood Tow and All City Tow), and confirmed with LAPD that it hasn’t been towed. It was last seen around 8 pm on 6/18 and my Apple Maps still shows it parked exactly where I left it. It hasn’t moved since.

I’ve filed a stolen vehicle report, but I’m hoping someone in the community might have seen something or caught it on a Ring cam, security camera, or dashcam. Even just knowing what time it disappeared would help. If you live nearby or were in the area, please reach out if you saw anything at all, even if it feels small. 

You can comment or DM me. I’m just trying to piece together what happened and have some hope of getting it back.

To give a small background about me I'm a 26 year old male with autism whom currently still lives with my mother and step dad due to inflation being a problem and places costing more so until I can get enough to move out I'm stuck with them which is affecting me mentally. I always have to deal with them constantly treating me like garbage on a daily basis & even my little sisters want nothing to do with me either despite literally being there for them, helping out whenever I can buts it's apparently not good enough, same goes for my mother and step dad im also helping them out etc whenever I can as well and being there for them. On family gatherings or events none of my other relatives care about me nor want to have conversations with me when I've done nothing wrong to them yet it's how they treat me & They do nothing but ignore me & dismiss me. My mother is real strict about me doing literally anything such as eating foods, drinking drinks because she is one of those health/fitness freaks, like I get if foods & drink are unhealthy or whatnot but I'm approaching my 30s that can make my own life choices but yet my mother doesn't think so & my step dad is an actual POS of a person towards me for no reason. I've had to deal with him since he dated my mother back when I was around 12 or 13 but even still he just likes to treat me like  shit all the time and it doesn't help that he also screams as he's regular speaking voice so it makes it worse. He is in his mid 40s with 2 kids (my little sisters) & unemployed with literally no efforts of even getting one so he's constantly home all the time and everytime it happens he always likes to pump out rap music on Max volume and it pisses me off everytime because whenever I'm trying to watch TV or work on videos (yes, I'm striving to be a content creator) it's so loud that I can hear it from a whole separate I room I sleep in that's not attached to the main house as it's more so attached to the garage & even with headphones/earphones on still I can hear it which I'm honestly surprised that we haven't got a noise complaint yet from the neighbours but anyway my mother on the other hand loves to start drama with me constantly when I'm just having my coffees and teas which I like to sit outside for peace, quiet and to be away from everyone else. One time she started crashing out over me quitting a furniture delivery job I used to work at because of the amount of mistreatment I get from co-workers, customers and the job's contractors which could be a whole other post about but anyway I got bad to the point where my mother started to full on harassing me and getting aggressive with me because I wanted to get out of a toxic environment and the job I had was causing my mental health to decrease as I started to get more depressed and angry each day that I worked. Another she crashed out because I said that I don't like dogs (yes, I don't like them for various reasons & I know I'll most likely get hated for it) but anyway like before she started to harass me and become aggressive when I was simply stating my reasons calmly and cordial with her the whole time. There's also my older brother who also has treated me like complete garbage all throughout my childhood and lastly every single one of my family members has narcissistic tendencies which they like to use on me to get a rise out of me and to upset me on purpose and just a variety of other stuff but yeah I do apologise that this is a long post but I wanted to get that stuff off my chest what I deal with on a daily basis for years and because of that it has affected my mental health in a way where I just want to give up my life because I'm stuck dealing with this and with me having autism its gonna be hard for me to get a full time job without the worry of more mistreatment etc so I'm trying to make content as much as I can so I get out of this once and for all so i never have to worry about working a 9 to 5 again. I'm also manifesting everyday and night to be out of this situation and start fresh in my life. ",4,1750311042.0,malementalhealth,0,1.0,False

We got married really quickly after having met each other. It seemed like a perfect relationship in the beginning. And I know I have played a part in making him feel uncertain at times about our relationship.

Now it’s gotten to the point where the past several months we get in arguments that turn physical and they are progressively getting more physical. He is bringing up things that have happened in the past and he does it every time we argue. When we get in arguments he hides the car key, house key etc. so I’m unable to leave. He will leave me stuck at the house for 12+hours. There’s times that he will ignore me for days. He’s shut the power off to our house for hours, broken multiple phones, cut up my license.

When we end up talking it out it always gets brought up that I’m not fighting for him and I shut down. I know I do and I’ve been working on it. It is hard to not shut down though when I feel constantly attacked.

He didn’t like posts I was liking on social media so I got rid of all those accounts. I basically don’t talk to anyone including my family anymore. He said that I don’t set healthy boundaries with people.

He has said quite a few times that when I’m sleeping he has thought about stabbing me with a knife in the thigh. He made a comment once about how I might just be the next Gabby Petito.

Recently when we argue he has been saying “you know you’re not the only girl I can get” or tells me about how he goes to a coffee shop and someone gives him their number.

I guess I’m really just asking for advice. Do things get better? Can they? What would you do if you were in my position? I’m feeling very doubtful. I’m to the point that I’m so emotionally shut down and constantly in fight or flight mode.",2,1750310580.0,whatdoIdo,5,1.0,False

The store is designed to provide a comfortable space for customers to enjoy their coffee in a spacious setting.

The rooftop terrace offers a panoramic view of Bukhansan's slopes, as well as a photo zone where visitors can capture memories with the mountain as a backdrop.

I’m helping organize a private open house “event” at a studio space for location managers / scouts and guests in film / photography that require a short term rental (day / week / month rates). The “guests” for this event are coming from a well connected person in the film industry and they want the event to be as simple as possible with no bells & whistles - literally coffee, donuts, some background music, the space itself and any relevant specs for shooting. This very simple event makes me slightly uncomfortable as my background is in entertainment and events, and I feel like we should show a little more effort. So I would like to ask what actual location managers want to see / do / find out at an open house so I can make the best use of their time and help show how we are a good fit.

-It’s just over 10,000 sq ft, 14ft ceilings with a couple loading docks and a lot of power. It’s not a cool studio; it’s basically a big warehouse space but we will use some of the rental money to reinvest in the space (maybe it will be cool in 3 years)
-suitable for actual shooting or as art department prep / carpentry or even just prop storage (we were producing a bunch of stuff there previously but have pivoted)

The internet is buzzing about Java Burn, a powdered supplement you stir into your morning coffee, promising to boost metabolism, burn fat, and supercharge your energy. But with bold claims like these, the obvious question is: **Is Java Burn legit or just another weight loss gimmick?**

This honest, detailed review breaks down what Java Burn is, how it works, its ingredients, potential side effects, and whether real customers are actually seeing results.



# What Is Java Burn?

Java Burn is a tasteless, odorless powder designed to be mixed with your daily cup of coffee. Marketed as a natural metabolism booster, it claims to accelerate fat burning without requiring major changes to your routine.

Created by John Barban, a fitness and health expert, Java Burn is manufactured in the U.S. in FDA-approved, GMP-certified facilities. It’s only sold online and primarily through the official website.

# How Does Java Burn Work?

The core idea behind Java Burn is **nutritional synergy with caffeine**—enhancing the natural metabolic effects of coffee by adding targeted, fat-burning nutrients. On its own, coffee can stimulate the central nervous system, increase thermogenesis (the process of heat production in the body), and temporarily suppress appetite. Java Burn builds on this by introducing a carefully formulated blend of metabolism-supporting compounds.

Here’s how it’s meant to work:

1. **You add Java Burn to your coffee.** The powder dissolves instantly without altering the taste or texture of your drink. It’s designed for convenience—just stir it into your morning cup and go.  
2. **It activates thermogenesis.** Ingredients like green tea extract, L-carnitine, and chlorogenic acid work in tandem with caffeine to increase your body’s internal temperature slightly. This triggers thermogenesis, a process where your body burns more calories to produce heat.  
3. **Your metabolism speeds up.** As your body burns more energy—even at rest—you create a “metabolic boost” effect. This can help with fat oxidation, especially when combined with a calorie-controlled diet and physical activity.  
4. **Your energy and focus increase.** The addition of L-theanine and B vitamins helps smooth out the effects of caffeine, promoting calm alertness without jitters or crashes. This can improve mental clarity and help you stay active throughout the day.  

Java Burn is intended to be taken once daily, ideally in the morning, mixed with **hot coffee** for optimal absorption. Cold coffee can work too, but heat may aid in faster dissolution and activation of certain compounds.

# Java Burn Ingredients Breakdown

Java Burn combines several well-known, research-backed ingredients designed to work in synergy with caffeine. Here's a closer look at what’s inside:

* **Green Tea Extract** – This powerful antioxidant source is rich in EGCG (epigallocatechin gallate), which has been shown to enhance fat oxidation, especially during exercise. It also supports metabolic health and may reduce inflammation.  
* **Chromium** – An essential trace mineral, chromium plays a role in regulating insulin levels and stabilizing blood sugar. This can help curb cravings and prevent the energy crashes that lead to overeating.  
* **L-Carnitine** – Naturally produced in the body, L-carnitine transports fatty acids into the mitochondria where they’re burned for energy. Supplementing with it may enhance endurance and fat-burning capacity during exercise.  
* **L-Theanine** – Found in green tea, L-theanine promotes relaxation without sedation. It’s particularly effective when paired with caffeine, helping to smooth out jitters and improve focus.  
* **Chlorogenic Acid** – Present in unroasted coffee beans, this compound may inhibit fat accumulation and support glucose metabolism, aiding weight loss and overall metabolic function.  
* **Vitamin D, B6, and B12** – These vitamins are critical for energy metabolism, immune function, and hormonal balance. Deficiencies can lead to fatigue and metabolic slowdown.  

While the ingredients are backed by promising science, **the exact dosages are hidden in a proprietary blend**, making it difficult to fully assess their clinical effectiveness. Transparency in labeling would strengthen credibility.



# Benefits Claimed by Java Burn

According to its creators, Java Burn delivers a range of benefits by combining proven metabolism-boosting ingredients with your daily cup of coffee. The supplement is marketed as a simple yet powerful aid for those looking to lose weight, increase energy, and improve overall health—without radically changing their routine.

Here are the main benefits Java Burn claims to offer:

* **Faster Metabolism** Java Burn’s core function is to increase your resting metabolic rate. By enhancing thermogenesis and fat oxidation, your body is supposed to burn more calories—even when you're not working out.  
* **Increased Fat Burning** With compounds like green tea extract, L-carnitine, and chlorogenic acid, Java Burn aims to convert stored fat into usable energy. This effect may be more pronounced when combined with a healthy diet and exercise plan.  
* **Improved Focus and Energy** Thanks to the inclusion of caffeine, L-theanine, and B vitamins, many users report feeling mentally sharper and more energized throughout the day. Unlike sugary energy drinks or heavy stimulants, the formulation is designed to deliver a smoother, crash-free experience.  
* **Better Overall Health Markers** Ingredients like chromium and vitamin D may help regulate blood sugar, support cardiovascular function, and improve immune health—adding long-term wellness benefits beyond weight loss.  

While some users experience quick results, others report more gradual progress. **Java Burn isn’t a magic solution**, but when used consistently alongside a sensible lifestyle, it may offer meaningful support for weight management and energy.



# Potential Side Effects and Safety Concerns

Java Burn is generally safe for most healthy adults. However, some users report:

* Mild **jitters or headaches**, especially when combined with multiple cups of coffee  
* **Upset stomach** if taken on an empty stomach  
* **Insomnia** if consumed late in the day  

It’s not recommended for:

* People sensitive to caffeine  
* Pregnant or nursing women  
* Anyone under 18  

Importantly, Java Burn isn’t FDA-approved as a weight loss drug—but that’s typical for supplements. It is manufactured in FDA-registered facilities.

# Real Customer Reviews and Results

Customer feedback is mixed, but mostly positive:

* ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ *“Lost 8 pounds in a month with no change in diet. Just added it to my morning coffee.”*  
* ⭐⭐⭐⭐ *“Gives me energy without the crash. Haven’t lost a ton of weight yet, but feel better overall.”*  
* ⭐⭐ *“Didn’t do much for me after 3 weeks. Might just not work for everyone.”*  

Results seem strongest for people combining it with better eating habits and exercise.





# Pricing and Where to Buy

Java Burn is sold **exclusively online** through the[ official website](https://www.wiredaily.com/lp/java-burn-site/) and occasionally on Amazon. Here’s the current pricing structure:

* **1 pouch (30-day supply): $69**  
* **3 pouches: $117 ($39/pouch)**  
* **6 pouches: $204 ($34/pouch)**  

Bulk orders come with discounts and money-back guarantees. 





# Is Java Burn a Scam or Legit?

Let’s be clear: **Java Burn is not a miracle product**. It won’t melt fat overnight. But it's also not a scam. The ingredients are evidence-based, the company is transparent, and many users see tangible benefits.

The red flags usually associated with scammy weight loss products—hidden charges, fake celebrity endorsements, shady trial periods—don’t apply here.

That said, expectations need to be realistic. **Java Burn works best as a support supplement**, not a standalone solution.



# Final Verdict: Should You Try Java Burn?

# Pros

✔ Easy to use ✔ Natural ingredients ✔ Real customer results ✔ Works well with coffee

# Cons

✘ Not a magic bullet ✘ Slightly expensive ✘ Not for caffeine-sensitive individuals

**Bottom line:** If you're already a coffee drinker looking for a convenient way to boost your metabolism, Java Burn might be worth trying. Just don’t expect miracles—and pair it with smart choices if you want real results.

1lf2f3e,https://www.reddit.com/r/AffiGrowth/comments/1lf2f3e/whats_the_best_way_to_get_daily_tips_and_updates/,What’s The Best Way To Get Daily Tips And Updates In Affiliate Marketing?,"I used to scramble around Google for hours trying to find the latest affiliate marketing strategies, only to discover I was already weeks behind the trends. Turns out, the problem wasn't finding information—it was having the RIGHT information delivered to me consistently.

Get the whole story [on my blog](https://clintherman.com/whats-the-best-way-to-get-daily-tips-and-updates-in-affiliate-marketing)

## **3 Methods That Transformed My Daily Learning:**

• **Curated Newsletter Strategy** - Instead of subscribing to random marketing blogs, I focused on 3-4 industry-specific newsletters like Affilorama and Smart Passive Income. These deliver bite-sized, actionable tips directly to my inbox every morning. No more hunting for content—it finds me.

• **Social Media Intelligence Gathering** - I created dedicated Twitter lists following top affiliate marketers and set up LinkedIn alerts for specific hashtags like #AffiliateMarketing and #DigitalMarketing. The real-time discussions and case studies shared in these circles are pure gold. Plus, you often catch breaking news about program changes before they hit the blogs.

• **Strategic Podcast + Webinar Combo** - I listen to affiliate marketing podcasts during my commute (20 minutes of learning without extra time investment) and attend one live webinar per week for deeper dives. The Q&A sessions in webinars have solved more of my specific problems than any blog post ever did.

## **The Information Sources I Wish I'd Found Earlier:**

**✅ High-Value Newsletters:**
- AffiliateFix Newsletter (weekly industry updates)
- CJ Affiliate Blog (network insights from the source)
- ShoutMeLoud (blogger-focused affiliate tips)

**✅ Must-Follow Social Accounts:**
- Pat Flynn on Twitter (transparent income reports)
- Affiliate marketing Facebook groups (real discussions, not sales pitches)
- LinkedIn company pages of major affiliate networks

**✅ Learning While Living:**
- The Affiliate Buzz podcast (perfect for commutes)
- ClickBank webinars (usually free, always valuable)
- RSS feeds through Feedly (no algorithm interference)

## **My Current Daily Learning Routine:**

- **Morning (5 minutes):** Check newsletter roundup with coffee
- **Commute (20 minutes):** Listen to affiliate marketing podcast
- **Lunch break (10 minutes):** Scroll through curated Twitter list
- **Evening (15 minutes):** Read saved articles from RSS feeds

**Total time:** Less than an hour, but the compound effect is massive.

## **The Mistakes That Cost Me Months:**

**❌ Information overload** - Subscribing to 20+ newsletters meant I read none of them properly

**❌ Generic business content** - Following general marketing advice instead of affiliate-specific strategies

**❌ No application system** - Learning without immediately testing new strategies on my campaigns

**❌ Passive consumption** - Reading tips without taking notes or asking follow-up questions

**❌ Platform hopping** - Jumping between different learning methods instead of building consistent habits

The biggest shift happened when I realized that staying updated isn't about consuming MORE content—it's about consuming the RIGHT content consistently and actually applying what you learn.

## **What's Working in 2025:**

**Real-time updates beat outdated blog posts** - Social media discussions often reveal strategy changes months before they hit mainstream affiliate blogs.

**Community-driven learning** - Forum discussions and group chats provide solutions to problems you didn't even know you had.

**Expert direct access** - Live webinars let you ask specific questions about YOUR campaigns, not generic advice.

The key insight: Building a personalized learning system beats random information hunting every single time.

## **Discussion Time:**

**How do you currently stay updated with affiliate marketing trends?** Are you still Googling for tips randomly, or do you have a system?

**What's your biggest challenge with information overload?** Too many sources, not enough time, or struggling to find quality content?

**For experienced affiliates:** **What's your #1 resource for daily tips and updates?** I'd love to add new sources to my routine.

**Where do you get stuck?** Finding reliable sources? Creating a consistent learning habit? Applying what you learn?

Let's help each other build better information systems instead of drowning in content chaos.

**I keep meeting my birth mom but she doesn’t know it’s me**



She had me when she was FOURTEEN. And I (24M) was given up for adoption. My parents told me about her growing up. I still have the letter she wrote me that she asked if they could give it to me if they wanted.

It’s crazy reading it sometimes and knowing it was a literal child who wrote it saying she’s sorry she couldn’t be my mommy but she hopes I’m happy. She was open to having contact but we moved for my dad’s job when I was 11 and then it seemed impossible to find her.

But luckily I did.

She’s working at this small restaurant and I keep going but she doesn’t know it’s me. We talk sometimes. And she seems like a nice lady. Sometime when she says something like “do you want a refill, honey” or uses another term like that I wanna tell her. Idk why it makes me nervous. We talk sometimes and she seems really genuine. If it’s not super busy she’s more open to talking about random stuff. I literally drive 2 hours to come eat at this place just to see her. And it’s like she knows me already because I’m there once or 2 times a week for the past 3 months so she always says hi with a big smile.

But man if only she knew



**Comments**



**\[deleted\]**

*She didn't give you up out of spite, its a child who loved you. Please tell her, because I think for her this would be the biggest joy in her life. Giving up a baby while she leaves you a letter to meet? Hun.. she loves you, 14 or 80 a mothers love doesn't change. Otherwise she would have erased any way to contact her. It won't suprise me you're the biggest hole left in her heart. Because a mother is never whole when she lost a child who she loves.*

*If you're to scared, write a letter about yourself with a phone number or a mail. Or leave a babyphoto she would recognize with your name and phonenumber in an envelope with her name on it. Then you don't have to say ""i'm your son"". But take the step, because regret is more painful than the present. And every moment counts, the present is only thing you can change. You deserve her and she definitely deserves you.*

*Edit: would you please keep us updated? Otherwise there is a small hole in my heart :(*

**pilotmaxmom**

*I use to long for my daughter that was adopted. I would visit a neighborhood park, watching all the children to see if I might recognize something in a child that would tell me was mine. Years later, when my daughter was older I sought her out. We have had a wonderful relationship for the last 15 years. She was at that park. Found out she grew up 5 miles from me. She could be craving reconnection as much as I did. I wish you a fulfilled journey and much love.*



**Update - 5 days later**



Well… I did it I told her. And yeah it was pretty heavy. My heart was even beating fast. i kept trying to think how to tell her. Many of the comments on my last post here mentioned writing her a letter just how she wrote a letter for me. Originally that was the plan but for me it felt like I needed to say it.

Oh, really quick I wanna say thanks to everyone for their love and support. Mostly to all the birth parents out there who shared their stories with me. That’s what really helped push me to have the courage to confront her. It meant so much so thanks.

Everything happened day before yesterday btw.

I did wait for her to be done with her shift and that was when they were closing the restaurant already. And waited in the parking lot. We said hi when she saw me first but then I told her there was something serious that she needed to know. First told her sorry for keeping it from her this long. She didn’t react until I actually pulled out her letter.

And she started bawling from there. Like screaming and crying at the same time, and didn’t even have to finish the whole “I’m your son” speech. She just saw it and knew. It was crazy. Next thing I know she’s hugging me instantly but then she pulled back and asked if it’s okay to hug me. Ofc it is and we’re just there hugging an crying in the parking lot. It hit her hard though. Her legs gave out for a second so I had to actually hold her up while she’s still hugging me for a min.

What really got me was her saying to me look how big you got. also hearing her cry made me cry too. She went back to open the restaurant up (she wouldn’t take no for an answer) we had coffee, ate a slice of their pie inside and talked. Soooo many stuff we talked about. She told me the second time I came to the restaurant she got a feeling but for her it was hard believe it was me. So that feeling she had was pushed way down.

Because she told me for years after I was adopted she saw kids that would be my age and used to think they were me. Then she would be crying in public. It fucked with her mind a lot and made her depressed so she didn’t want to do the same when she saw me, getting her hopes up like that.

She says I look so much like my biological dad when he was younger though. We talked about him too. They stayed in contact with eachother incase I ever reached out to one of them so it would be easier to contact the other. I didn’t have hope about finding my biological dad since he was never mentioned so I’m glad they both planned for this future scenario. She told me about how they wanted to keep me. Especially my biological dad, he didn’t want me to be adopted. But he knew they had to because they were just kids. It took him a long time to get passed it after I was born she told me. That’s why he didn’t leave anything because he didn’t wanna believe he might not see me again.

We talked for hours. Til almost 2 in the morning (they closed at 11). She just wanted to know everything about me but her main thing was “am I happy”. Were my parents good to me. Did I have a happy childhood. And I did. I told her thank you for helping to give me this life. We both cried again. She cried the most. Everything was very emotional for her. Sometimes she would look really happy but then get sad again.

After my 18th birthday she was hoping I would find her that’s why she stayed in the same city. But since I didn’t she always thought maybe I resented her, wasn’t told I’m adopted, or maybe had decided it was better not to have her around. It made me feel bad for not telling her sooner. She told me it’s not my fault and I did right going at my own pace. Honestly she’s so sweet. The way she kept looking at me with the biggest smile, it made me emotional sometimes. Makes you think how can someone who’s been a total stranger ur whole life look at you with so much love. It’s wild. We learned so much about eachother. She asked me if we could have dinner soon to keep talking. And if at some point in the future if I’m interested come over to her house so I can meet her husband. That all sounded really great.

We exchanged numbers. After I left she sent a text telling me thank you for giving her this gift that she didn’t know if it would ever come.

My girlfriend came over and she hugged me while I cried. I wasn’t sad btw these were happy tears. Everything went better than I expected. There was still emotionally heavy stuff but I’m still glad that we got to open up to eachother



**Comments**



>OOP replying to a deleted comment She asked me if I wanted her to let him know. We don’t have to meet right away if I don’t want to but just so he’s aware. He’s been wanting to see me for a long time. I told her to tell him and we can meet up soon. My first actual meeting with her had me real pumped so I thought why not. I wanna see him too

**twitwiffle**

*It’s amazing to me how many of us, all around the world, in our cars, in bed, on break, at a coffee shop are all reading the same news and crying or smiling or feeling a welling up of joy at about the same time.*



**Update - 17 days later**



Lots of you asked to let you know how it goes meeting my biological dad and to say it was emotional….is an understatement. I’ve been feeling so many things since this all happened. We met a few days ago. Was originally supposed to be almost 2 weeks ago but shit kept coming up. Work and then I got sick (not covid) for days. But we made it happen. Tbh this was more nervous for me because I didn’t know anything about him. With my bio mom it was different because I watched her from far and got to know her a little before it came out. I asked my bio mom if she could be there too just because she knows him better so it was the 2 of us waiting for him at this park.

He was already crying before we even got to him. This guy is strong too so he pulled me in for the biggest bear hug and crying 😅🥲.

He told me he wants me to know that they loved me so much and he loves me. I lost count how many times he’d come back in for one more hug. This definitely got to him. And he kept saying thank you God a few times. Looking at my face. The feelings man, the feelings… We had so many of them. Hearing him tell me how much they love me even back then. It meant so much for me to hear that and ngl that had me holding him tight too.

I’m sure to everyone at the park it was weird seeing 3 crying people lol. My bio dad said he cried so many times just driving over here he didn’t think he had anymore tears until he saw us. When we were all sitting down it hit me that my bio mom was NOT lying when she said we look alike 😂 obviously he’s older but still holy shit the similarities.

He brought gifts too which was a surprise. It was really nice he told me I don’t have to keep them if I don’t want it but he felt weird not coming with anything and he’s wanted to give this to me for a long time.

One was a teddy bear holding a picture frame of him at the hospital holding me (he was 15 years old, it’s still crazy to realize that ). And then the other thing was a journal. The journal thing was stuff he said he started writing to me years after I was adopted. He was in therapy and that that helped him to cope thinking he would give them to me one day. His way of still feeling connected to me. I haven’t read everything yet but some of the pages were his thoughts and like if he’s talking to me. How he felt when they found out she was pregnant, then the adoption, everything going on in his mind when he first got to hold me as a baby. I didn’t even know he was at the hospital too.

It was not what I was expecting.. it really got me. I read some more of what he wrote last night that really got me crying. I’m sad to think how much this affected them emotionally for years. Also think it’s pretty sweet he wanted to write this for me. We talked about his own life which was pretty hard. His struggles with home life and the feelings he had about giving me up. Then he wanted to know everything about me. Basically with the same questions my bio mom had. I made sure they knew they made the right decision. Because my life was pretty great.

He looked like he wanted to cry when he knew that because that’s all they hoped for and it was something he always wondered about for years. My bio mom left a bit after we were more comfortable so we could talk more in private once it didn’t feel too awkward between us. From there he told me stories about how he met my bio mom. Sometimes he’d point out stuff he notice about me that reminds him of her or me and him having similar likes.

Example: I love eating mangos. I can eat them all day and that’s what I bought when we bought snacks at the park. He told me my bio mom was obsessed with mangos seven before she got pregnant, while pregnant she craved it even more.

Just cool info to know even if it’s random stuff lol. It’s still stuff we have in common and we both have lots. Both like hiking, playing pool, he was a swimmer in college and I was on a swim team in highschool, both love rock music. Especially 90’s. My bio dad was really open about sharing everything. Like he really was getting ready for this meeting. He hoped it would happen and he prayed everyday to see me again because he had so many things he wanted to tell me. Overall really good first meeting. I’m glad how it went. He’s open to the idea of meeting my parents. After I told them about all this because they definitely want to meet my bio parents again if I’m comfortable with that, obviously if my bio parents are too. Let’s see when that happens. Idk how it’s gonna feel for me. They’ve met eachother before I was even born but I never had them at the same place so that’ll be interesting lol.

Me and my parents met up yesterday to have breakfast so I could tell them everything. My mom was so happy how it went. She actually cried too whne i was telling them about both their reactions. My dad was proud because he knew how hard it was the months after finding my bio mom and not really wanting to make contact yet. I’m really happy to have their support because it’s hard not to feel guilty about wanting to know more my bio parents. They gave me a really good life so for a while it’s felt like maybe to them I’m showing them that wasn’t good enough for me and I’d rather have my bio parents. But they told me many times they want me to do this for me and the know how much I love them. And I really do.

Finding them and meeting them was hard. But it was so worth it to me. And seeing their reactions made it feel even more worth it. Still can’t believe it sometimes.

I’m just realizing this has turned into a long post, my bad haha. Writing this has been therapeutic tbh. Kind of thinking back to everything that’s happened. Feeling really grateful. Again wanna say thank you to everyone who has been on this journey with me. Everyone who sent me their own stories, their love, their encouragement. You guys have beautiful hearts and I’m happy I had somewhere to talk about all this and receive so much love back! Just wanna say to all the adopted kids out there, i wish you guys luck and that you find what you’re looking for. It’s not easy at all. I feel fortunate that things didn’t go badly or that my bio parents aren’t bad people. And to all the birth parents out there who made this sacrifice, thank you 🙏🏻 🙏🏻🙏🏻It’s because of you there are kids out there like me who got to have a great life with loving parents

We live in Cavite. We both work in Metro Manila.
We wake up at 4:00 am. We must leave the house on or before 5:30 am everyday, otherwise, we'd be late.

In his defense muna bago ko siya ib@ckst-a-b dito, he gets up first kasi maghuhugas pa siya ng pinagkainan namin the night before, which we couldn't do right after dinner kasi walang tubig 'pag gabi. Pagod na rin kami sa buong araw kaya mas gusto naming magpahinga na kaagad. He goes straight to bed, I go to my office kasi may responsibilities pa ako as a student. That means, ang pagod ko ay extended until midnight, kaya siya ang gumagawa ng gawaing bahay, except cooking. To compensate, I carry the responsibility of paying the bills and groceries, except for the mortgage. Para walang sumbatan, kasi for the past 3 years, siya nagbabayad ng tuition ko. And once na siyang nanumbat, and I don't want to experience that again.

I have been his backrider since our magjowa days. That was more than a decade ago. It has taken its toll on my body. Pagod na pagod na pagod na. Can't buy a car yet. Wala pa kaming pambili. Commuting is also more expensive than owning a car, and too tiring too! Kaya tiis lang sa Yamaha muna.

Going back, since nauuna siyang magising, I grab the extra minutes para matulog pa.

Para makaalis kami ng 530, dapat naliligo na ako by 5am.
4am to 5am should be enough time for him to drink his coffee, wash the dishes, and clean himself.

For many times over the years, ginigising niya ako ng 5:15. At sisigawan ng ""bilisan mo male-late na tayo"", sabay bagsak ng pinto.
Dinaan ko na sa masinsinang usapan, dinaan na rin sa iyakan, dinaan sa pag-boycott (nagko-commute ako), it would work for a time, pero babalik na naman sa treatment na parang alila ako sa bahay na nakikitulog sa kwartong may aircon.

Ano ang gagawin ko sa 15 minutes??? Hindi ako si Quicksilver!
Kanina, ginising ako eksakto 530!!
Ano ang gagawin ko? Papasok akong nakapantulog na may laway pa sa pisngi??
Remembering that I only have 200 left in my wallet, hindi ako makakarating sa Metro Manila at makakauwi sa Cavite kapag nag-commute ako.

So I told him hindi ako papasok. Pero dahil may trabaho akong nakabinbin na lahat urgent, nagtatrabaho ako ngayon sa bahay nang hindi bayad!

Lagi na lang kami nagmamadali!! Uubusin niya ang oras niya kaseselpon, tapos ako ang peperwisyuhin ng pangga-gaslight niya pag nagahol sa oras. Na kahit ang way niya ng pagmamaneho ng motorsiklo ay isisisi niya sa oras ng gising ko. Tapos kapag pinaandaran ko ng kamalditahan ko, hinuhubaran ko raw siya ng pagkalalaki niya. Tang!n@ talaga! AKO BA NAGDADRIVE??

Inasawa ko to dahil sobrang bait, pero habang tumatanda, sumasama ugali eh. For better or for worse, pero Lord panalangin ko lang naman ay tratuhin akong babae, hindi mason. Hindi ko na nga pinipilit na mabigyan ng bulaklak. Ako na nga ang nagyayaya magdate, at nagbabayad. Sariling sikap na nga lang ako dahil pati sa marital responsibilities, nagmamadali rin siya, pero Lord, gisingin man lang sana ako na para akong tao. 😭😭😭

Sana matapos na tong pag-aaral ko at maging abogado na ako para makabili na ako ng sasakyan. Ako ang magdadrive. Magmotor siya buong buhay niya.",0,1750309277.0,OffMyChestPH,30,0.38,False

By week 3 I felt i had adapted and was enjoying the background benefits but it wore off around 5 or 6pm and I sometimes had mini crashes around noon so I asked my doctor and he upped it to 40mg.

Well today was horrible I couldn't focus I was scatter brained I felt like I had 30 coffees even tho I didn't have any and I took my dose with protein and snacked during the day and stayed hydrate.

Is this going to get better? Do I need to use the water method for a month to go back down to 20mg or try 30mg until I can talk to my doctor again? Genuinely don't know what to do.

True work/life balance culture means accepting that life will always interrupt work. Whether you’re a parent or not, whether you’re remote or in-office, life doesn’t pause from 9 to 5. Real flexibility is about trusting people to deliver outcomes in the way that works best for them. I know that some WFH jobs themselves don't allow a lot of wiggle room for flexibility, but I'm not speaking to that here. 

Companies want AI and cutting-edge tech, but refuse to evolve workplace policies to match with either implementing RTO or remote policies that are meant to mirror the office. If someone works remotely and runs a midday errand or has their child home during summer, suddenly their commitment is questioned even though those same hours in the office include small talk, 4 coffee runs, and long social breaks. The double standard is exhausting. If you are salaried, what's wrong with making up the lost time after work hours to ensure deadlines are met? Let me be clear that I am not advocating for being away for hours during business hours, just pointing out the double standard. I know people have abused remote work, but someone could easily sit in office all day on Reddit and still have the same result: not delivering.

Most companies ignore the reality that women are often the default caregivers, navigating school closures, drop-offs, and impossible summer camp waitlists. & just because a job is remote doesn’t mean it’s flexible. True flexibility comes from trust to provide outcomes, not from being online at all hours, not from performative presence, and certainly not from surveillance culture. Trust is a two-way street. If you expect employees to answer emails after hours or stay on call, then trust them to take care of life when they need to. I promise they are more motivated that way & work twice as hard.

Flexible work exposed me to the cracks in the system and once you’ve seen what’s possible, it’s hard to unsee it. Once [you lose](https://www.reddit.com/r/MomsWorkingFromHome/comments/1le3fhz/comment/myd9y8r/) it, you feel helpless that most of the population probably won't experience it to push for it more.",22,1750309169.0,MomsWorkingFromHome,2,1.0,False

As his protege I learned far more than words could ever convey. Prone to rambling yet, the ramblings were always cohesive and always in a pleasant tone. 

“Just think! The ability to travel back to a day you were most happiest! A wedding day, your favorite sports team’s championship, a simple day in April! Imagine the happiness a single breath of the past could bring us!”

I found his enthusiasm and optimism contagious. Dr. Martel was tireless: “Forty years! I’ve been at this for forty years and I can see the finish line! Or in this case I guess you could say the… starting line.” He would always chuckle after that joke. Forty of his sixty-eight years on this earth he spent toiling with his obsession. After completing his doctorate, the Doctor began work immediately, never slowing down to marry, travel, or pursue other hobbies. “No time for that! Or, maybe I will have time.” Followed by another chuckle. 

The days became long and the complexity of the work far exceeds any project I completed since. It was a Tuesday in September when Dr. Martel screwed the last Phillip's head screw into the machine. The doctor took his goggles off for only a moment to wipe a tear that began the slide. 

“Well… it would seem we’ve done it my dear girl.” 

The machine (which he called the Eye of Chronos) was a portal-like structure with two large pointed ends that came ever so close to touching at the top of the machine. The jagged edges made the machine look straight out of a sci-fi film. The Eye was accompanied by a wristband that brought the user back to the portal when their adventure was at an end. The doctor explained that the structural layout of the machine meant absolutely nothing to the science behind it. “I mean… it just looks cooler this way!” 

I agreed. 

The memory of the purple light that enraptured the room found a home in my mind that still lingers to this day. The portal breathed and hummed, twisted and writhed, beckoned and enticed. The doctor, standing at the control panel of the Eye, turned to me as he strode towards the portal: “See you in no time!” this time I chuckled.

What felt like ten years was in truth merely ten seconds and there stood the doctor. His face, a source of brightness and comfort to many, was replaced by one that can only be described as hollow. His cold and broken voice echoes through my ears even now as I write these words: “Leave me.”

The next day I found The Eye of Chronos, his greatest creation, destroyed. The control panel was broken and unreadable. I searched for his notes, to find them burned and scattered about the room. Then I saw him, the man I learned so much from, sitting in his chair, dead. The autopsy revealed a heart attack, most likely from the physical strain and stress of his rampage. 

As for what he saw, I have only a note. I found it in his hand with my name written on the envelope that encased the note.

9/2/2058

I have set the course of the Eye to traverse to December 25th 1997. One of my favorite and most memorable christmases in my lifetime. One that truly captured a child’s wonder and amazement and the magic of that special holiday. Yes, there were other days that I felt more accomplished and maybe even happier however, none made me feel the way this day did. I remember the day fondly, my parents, siblings, and even grandparents were present. Many of the details of that day were lost to time. There was one moment however, that I will never forget. After all the gifts were opened, I sat under the tree wondering why Santa didn’t bring me my only gift I asked for. I resigned myself to next year’s festivities to receive the gift I so desperately wanted. Then, as if Santa had read my thoughts himself, a final gift was given to me by my mother. 

The joy, the tears, the love, were never matched in my lifetime. We all have that gift, that singular item that we all wanted when we were growing up. For me it was the newest game system from my favorite company.

A perfect moment for a test run.

I stepped through the portal to find my childhood home just as I remembered. The coffee table with the wooden coasters, the piano I learned to play at a young age, and of course the game system itself. However, an overpowering feeling descended upon me: an overwhelming sense of nothingness. My family was nowhere to be found. I searched the house, even stepped into my brother and I’s room to find it too, was empty. I walked to the window to look at the bird feeders my mother placed outside. There was no bird nor squirrel nor even an insect. The piano I spent so many long hours practicing at called to me. One key was all I could muster. The sound echoed through the house. 

Soulless. Void. Destitute. Do any of these words adequately describe this hell? I sat down on the same couch in the living room where I spent many happy hours playing video games and though I wanted to cry, I found I could not. A memory is a precious thing, we do all we can to protect them. Yet, in one swift moment, brought about by my own hand, I destroyed the greatest of them all. Try as I might, I could not recall the original day, the laughter and joy was replaced by… nothing. 

My dear girl, one final wisdom I have for you: Never try to relive a memory.

The memories of Dr. Martel, forever housed in my mind, remind of the dangers of obsessing over memories etched into our past. 

Rest in peace my teacher, my friend. ",3,1750309120.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

You wouldn’t know it unless you were lost or trying to disappear. Pines on both sides. So tall they blot out the sky. Nothing out there. No lights. No stations. Just dark and more dark.

Last week, I couldn’t sleep. Took the car out. Dumb idea, but whatever. Around 2 a.m., I hit that road. Just me, the trees, and the weird feeling something was about to break open.

Then I saw it. *A diner.*

Lit up like it was waiting. Red neon flickering *EAT*, chrome catching the moonlight, windows fogged like someone had just wiped them. The kind of place that looks better in black and white. And here’s the thing…it wasn’t there before. I’ve driven that stretch a hundred times. 500. There is no diner. There’s never been a diner.

But there it was.

I pulled in. Got out. The air felt... thick. Never really knew what that meant before, but I could feel it….in my throat…even taste it…Like everything had been dipped in syrup.

I walked through the door. Bell jingled.

Inside, it was quiet. Not empty, just quiet. A few folks scattered in booths. No one looked up. The jukebox was playing something that sounded almost like *Dream a Little Dream*, only warped. Like slower. Off. Like it was being played backwards underwater.

The waitress came over. She looked familiar. I couldn’t figure out why, and then I saw the nametag.

*Marni.*

I remember that name. Marni. How do I remember that name…? She poured the coffee without asking. I didn’t touch it.

*You shouldn’t be here.*

Her voice didn’t match her face. Too low. Too calm. Like it was dubbed in.

I looked around. The guy in the far booth was staring at his hands like he’d forgotten what they were for. Another was weeping, but softly, like it was a habit. The couple by the window weren’t moving at all. Just breathing. In sync. Perfectly. Perfect. Too perfectly. Perfect.

I started to feel cold. Like deep-in-your-teeth cold. Even though it was warm in there. Even though the windows were fogged. Then the jukebox skipped. Over and over. Just the same line.

*Dream a little dream of... dream a little dream...of… dream a little…*

That’s when I decided to leave.

There was no check. Just a receipt she’d slid across the table when I wasn’t looking.

I shoved a twenty under the mug, and out… I didn’t even stand. I just slid out the booth and backed toward the door.. No headlights followed. No sounds. Just the trees again. Like nothing had happened.

I don’t remember going to bed. I don’t remember waking up. I’m just here…having coffee…. Thinking about it.

I pull out the receipt. Instantly like, *what the fuck?*

Looking for advice in a sub that has helped in the past.,"As the title says. I think that I am writing this to see if anyone can see something that I am not.

My background is I am a 40 yo man married to a woman for the last 10 years and just this last fall adopted our foster son after a 5 1/2 year fight.

I am going to give the most detailed and concise of summaries about myself, my wife, and our marriage. Too often I see people giving clarifying information in comments and I want to lay out as much of it as I can because I think that our backgrounds and history are important to some for context. If you want to know what the ""incident"" was, just skip down to the incident.

 About me (40M)...

I grew up in a not so stable home. I am the oldest of 5 and had very high anxiety growing up due to moving around so much because my father was emotionally volatile and would get fired all the time. We moved from shitty farm house to shitty farm house. At one point I counted it up and it was something like 17 moves in Northern Indiana until the age of 16. My father was/is a college educated Business Construction Manager and burned every bridge at every company in the midwest at this point. My middle sister was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes when she was 3 and threw our live in chaos. We never had health insurance and our whole lives revolved around her health. We went bankrupt twice in my life. To cope, I poured myself into my academics, but it developed an anxiety in me that was damn near debilitating. Academics stopped being a joy for learning and became an obsession. One night when 13, my parents removed my homework and forced me to go to a bible study led by a lady of a recent church we started attending. It changed me. I started writing sketches, stories, music, and producing videos with my closeted friend (at the time) Zach and I finally felt like I was not burdened by my family. However, we moved away. I think it is because it was too hard for my Dad to not come off as dysfunctional when your close neighbors can see and hear it all the time. My family moved and I went to college. Got some scholarships and instead of pursuing Chemistry or something in videography, I chose Nursing. Those other majors had to much uncertainty with employment and insurance. They were majors for the well off. While I was at college my family fell apart. My father became more abusive and my parents just kind of gave up on my siblings. two moved in with their high school sweet hearts (1 is married and 1 divorced now) my middle diabetic sister got pregnant and then got pregnant a second time with twins by a local drug dealer. And then my parents just kind of let my little sister go (drugs, dropped out of high school, 3 babies with 3 different fathers). It was at college that a pastor told me I was abused growing up. I scoffed because we only got spanked, but as the years and stress of college wore on the layers of abuse started to shed. Some were spankings, but there were also a lot of beatings or spankings that started as beatings. Upon graduating I got a nursing job and got involved with a girl and finally had sex at 24. Things were looking ok until I found out this girl I was dating had been getting frequently SA'd at the Christian camp I worked at the summer before by a camp counselor that worked there. Everything came out including that her and I were sleeping together and I was expelled from the camp and basically told that my consensual sex was as bad as his sexual assault. This was devastating. My mother is a SA survivor. The first girl I ever dated confided in me that her father had raped her growing up. (This came out as we were about to have sex at 16, so yeah that really put a pin in having sex for 10 years). For me, sexual exploitation of someone is the most heinous thing and I was guilty of it. I became volatile at work and drank like a fish on y days off. I eventually did travel nursing in CA for a couple of years. As I was getting blitzed on my days off, I was sending money back to my brother to get through his senior year and into college. At this point he was the only sibling to still talk to me and we would talk about the abuse we suffered at the hands of our father (he got it way worse than I did ). A few years on I came back to Indiana. Kept drinking and got a job working with Burn patients. It was not only a hard unit to work on, but the unit was a toxic work environment the likes I have still never seen. However, things stated looking up. I found a church where there were people my age and I got involved working with homeless youth in Indianapolis on my days off. I also started getting off the sauce!!! It was also here that I met my wife.

About my wife (40F)...

My wife is the middle child of 3 sisters and came from a well to do family from the suburbs of Chicago. Her father was a former Master Card cyber security fellow and had been forcefully retired a few years before I met my wife. After his retirement, they moved to North Carolina and built their dream home with a heated pool and guest bedrooms for everyone to stay when they visit. My MIL is a breast cancer survivor. She got diagnosed when my wife was in middle school and her older and younger sisters acted out a lot at that time all the while she took care of her mom and didn't really get to experience all the joys of middle/high school because of it (much like me). Her family (unlike mine) suppress there emotions instead of letting them all out. She got involved with Christianity through camp one summer (her family are holiday Catholics) and she really developed a desire to serve. She worked with Burmese refugees in Indiana, relocating them and getting them settled. While she was doing this she was also leading classes for girls that had been sexually exploited and trafficked. Eventually the Burmese settlement job became too much and after a 10yo refugee girl was raped by a relative and my wife went with her through the abortion procedure, she broke and quit. At the time I met her at church, she was leading the youth group and working the finances of a local HVAC company.

About Us...

We first really met when someone got the bright idea to ask me to interview for a volunteer position with the youth. I apparently cussed a lot in the interview and my wife deemed me a ""No."" At the homeless youth place I was at, her and I had some overlap between my youth and her exploited girls. Eventually after a year or so of brushing into each other, I went on a retreat to a Monastery in southern Indiana, woke up and while drinking a cup of coffee told my friend Andy that I am going to ask her out on a date when we get back. So I did. It was awful. I was stumbling over my words and spilled tomato sauce on my shirt and I distinctly remember ending the night about some story I read about childhood cancer. JFC I don't know why she agreed to another one. Eventually (6 months ish) I told her I think that I love her. It freaked her out, but it was true. A few more months and I am driving around with a kid I was mentoring and told him that ""I am going to marry her, because she frustrates me and I cannot imagine not being frustrated by her for the rest of my life."" So, we ended up getting married a year and some months after we started dating. A month before our wedding I was unceremoniously fired from the Burn unit. As I said, it was a toxic place and I had apparently pissed someone off enough for them to deem me an ""immediate threat to patient safety for falling asleep (on night shift) at the work desk""....2 weeks after the cited incident. Regardless it sent me on a spiral. I felt like I had failed, that I was just like my father getting fired from all those jobs growing up, and I had failed my soon to be wife. HEr for her effort tried to pull me out of it, but I was impossible. We had fun at our wedding and a blast at the reception, but the next few moths were rough until I found a job. Lucky we lived in an apartment complex with many other young couples from our church so we had a community to get together with once a week and it was supportive and lovely. After a year, people started moving, we bought a house, and the church fell apart. My FIL found out that my MIL had developed lesions on her vocal chords from HPV she got 40 years ago while her and my FIL were on a break and he felt betrayed. He started drinking heavily and verbally abusing my MIL. I started going to counseling and seeing a psychiatrist for depression and anxiety while giving a failed run at grad school thinking it would fulfill me. My wife all the while did her best to keep everyone a float. She would come to me in tears saying she was lonely. I was on the wrong depression medications and could not have cared less. It sucked. Eventually through genetic testing I got put on the right meds, started seeing a counselor, and began looking into art again. We had left the church, but it was something still important to her, but I had been burned by too many Christian communities at this point to give it a go. The last 5ish years... 

We both had never cared about having our own genetic children, but want to have a family. I always knew I was going to adopt and I think she did too. then in August of 2019, a 16 month blonde little boy came to live with us. With him also came his 3 older half sisters in separate foster homes, but we were also heavily invested with. It had its ups and downs, but t was beautiful those first couple years.  I was doing well at my new job, my wife got a new job that paid a lot more so I went part-time and stayed home with our son most of the days. Then our sons bio father got out of prison and it all went pear shaped real quick. We got a visitation coordinator that sided with bio dad, hated us, and flat out lied in court. Our son started having severe emotional outbursts and at one point threw a dog antler and struck her above her right eye. My wife's older sister split from the family and cut off all communication with everyone including our nieces and nephews (this had a profound affect on my wife). A month later she called me in a panic because she thought she was having a stroke. I sped home from work and found her tied to a gurney losing her mind and having a psychotic break. Turns out she did suffer a skull fracture (ever so slight) from that antler incident. She got diagnosed with ""complicated migraines"" and gets fatigued a lot and has to lay down because her head hurts. Eventually (after 4 fucking years), it came time for the courts to determine if parents would get our son back. They deemed that ehre was not enough evidence (but there was) to reject parents rights for our son, but there was enough for all his half siblings. I lost it. Sank into a major depression the likes of which I had not seen in years. One of our friends said I had experienced a trauma response and needed to seek out someone that deals in Trauma based therapy. So I did. I began EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Re-processing) and going through my abuse stuff. I t was lifting the veil off so much stuff I had been struggling with and getting nowhere in therapy for years. We got an attorney to get a contested adoption and eventually got to an visitation agreement to allow us to adopt our son on our wedding anniversary last November and spent a week at Disney World (my son and I both had never been). It was fantastic.

The last month...

My wife likes to bring up my anger and a lot of times brings up my abusive father as a foundation for that fear of my anger. It is a very double standard situation as when I try to give her insight on things that I see, if I bring up her family it is a non-starter. My wife has been working longer hours and her job has been more stressful. Our sons bio mom is pregnant with his full blood brother and due this month and it is very confusing for him. (I mean she lost the first four but surely fifth one will be the one, right?) He has become increasingly more violent and destructive and unfortunately picked up on some of my bad habits. He doesn't like talking about his emotions so we have sought out a child psychiatrist for him. I have also sat down with him after I have lost my cool or not handled something gracefully and apologized and talked to him about it. I am continuing to do counseling and my wife keeps reading books and listening to podcasts on how to parent difficult children.

Three weeks ago, school let out but summer camps were not starting for another two weeks so I had my son the whole time those two weeks and they were a lot. I love my son, but it is impossible to get anything done with him around. He does not want to play by himself and always wants someone around due to abandonment stuff I think. My wife has been working later and longer because of work (TY you cheeto colored fuck and all your tariff fuckery). My son also likes to dump things out and destroy the house. My wife is also a naturally messy person and doesn't mind, but it brings me so much anxiety and I have tried to tell her that. I have told her for the longest time now that I know my wants for the house being clean are unreal, but there has got to be a compromise. The other thing that has been happening is that my son is destroying things in outbursts and my wife after reading all these parenting books and what not is very passive about them. She is also very passive about him cleaning up by himself because ""he needs someone there."" Anyway, I am not down for the destruction anymore and have started picking my son up and putting him in timeout. Its a labor (he is 4'4"" and about 100lbs) and he is so big that the destruction is massive. But he has found out that if I touch him or make him do something that he doesn't want to do, if he cries out for my wife she undermines me. I have told her to stop doing this. The marriage counselor SHE RECOMMENDED told her to stop doing this, but it continues.   

  
The incident...

Last weekend we took a respite case from DCS. 4 month old girl who was a victim of shaken baby syndrome. She was one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen. It broke my heart as much as it brought me so much joy. It was a rainy weekend, so we spent a lot of time inside. Saturday morning our son goes into a tirade throwing, kicking, smashing stuff while this 4 month old is around. I pick him up and put him on the stairs in timeout (aggressively, yes, harmfully, no). As I am walking by the stairs, he swings his leg and kicks me. I stare him down. He does it a second time I come by and I told him to knock it off. The third time I had it. He kicked, I kicked and caught him right under the thigh. I t was not a hard kick in the least, but it did make a loud ""clap."" Our son went down like a sack of potatoes accusing me of hurting him (I did not hurt him). My wife ran in and immediately accused me of kicking him to hurt him and packed him up and went to the library (again the undermining). They come back, he is cool again and the sweetness that I love about him comes back out.

Sunday morning (Father's Day of all fucking days) I wake up to my son slamming our bedroom door and screaming. I hear smashing and slamming and I eventually wake up with a ""WTF is happening right now?!"" I bolt over to our son (I do not know where my wife is) and pick him up and again aggressively (not harmfully) sit him in the hallway in timeout. At this point my wife appears asking what is happening (good fucking question) and the baby is at the foot of our bed. I no sooner sit back down on the bed and here comes out son running in our room hurling a box at me and where the baby is laying. I deflect it and bolt to him, pick him up and again aggressively sit him down with the added ""sit your ass down now and stay there."" He starts screaming I am a ""dumbasshole"" and my wife comes over as I am in his face and is pulling me back when she says ""I am going to call the cops about this abuse!""

I turned to her and said ""WTF did you just say?"" She takes our son and the baby downstairs while I am still processing what she just said. I come down and again ask her ""What did you say?"" She repeats it. I said ""Have you lost your god damn mind?"" She doubles down. I am befuddled. I told her ""knowing everything I went through, knowing everything we have seen, you are seriously accusing me of abuse?"" She said yes. I told her she has completely lost the plot, got dressed and left the house for the rest of the day. I spent father's day alone walking around downtown, receiving texts from my friends and family about ""Happy Fathers Day!"" When I got home the house was completely destroyed (toys, food, furniture, etc), I immediately went to my office. I texted my wife I do not feel safe around her anymore and that I want everything on record or with a third party. I told her that that was a hell of a thing to say to me. I told her I am not doing shit this whole week. I am not helping transport to camps, I will clean my dishes I use and do my laundry, but everything is on her this week because I am done. 

I have emailed our marriage counselor saying that I d not think that we need to be doing this anymore as apparently it has meant nothing. And I hate her. Oh God I hate her and I do not know if I can forgive her. Through text messages she has told me she needs to ""protect our \[son\]."" I have never hit our son out of anger or for the purpose of hurting him. I have never spanked our son though many of my friends think I should. I however know the slippery slope it can be to spank and then beating because of how my dad beat us and I do not want to do that. She told me that my anger is the problem. I told her I agree I have anger, but at no point did I lose control of myself in dealing with our son. Was I intense? yes. Was I out of control? no. And on the times I have felt out of control I have left. I told her she grew up in a household that expressed no emotions and instead drowned themselves in alcohol and food. Her family is ""emotionally constipated"" and do not know how to let out their emotions and so when others do it is wrong. She wants me to swear I will not touch our son. I said I promise I will never touch our son if I am out of control. She has said it is her fear of what could happen and not wha I have done. WTF?

I am at a loss and do not know if there is a way forward from this for me. I have made a lot of mistakes in our marriage and she herself has admitted that the coping mechanisms she has developed to deal with it through the years are a problem with trusting me, but that is as far as it goes. Mush like her trait of ""being messy,"" her coping skills that are holding us back from moving forward are something I just need to ""get over."" I have told her with the way she treats me, if the genders were reversed you would call me a misogynist. I am the one that cleans the house because I am the one that has a problem with it and she doesn't like to do it. I am the one that needs to cook dinner because I am the one at home. If I want intimacy and have asked for it, forget it. She wants sex after days and weeks of having no meaningful conversation. I am tired of paying for the debt I accrued at the beginning of our marriage with no end in sight. I am reflecting on all this and wondering ""is it going to be different in 5 years? 10 years?"" All the things I like about her have nothing to do with ""her."" I like her family. I like the trips we take. I like the experiences we have had. But her, what is it I like or enjoy about her now. I told myself I would never be in a loveless marriage and yet I think that I am in one. I also do not want to stay in a marriage with her so long and miserable that I start to believe such horrible things about her. We are both flawed. We have both made mistakes. I just do not see much of a future I think if I am honest with myself. And divorce feels like failure.

Lastly, I do feel like that her head trauma from the antler really affected her. When I look back, that is when she started checking out and disengaging. Idk, just a thought and an observation others have seen.

Any thoughts or insights are welcome. I do hope I am painting an even picture here. I do not want it to come off like I am not to blame for any of this. I am trying to give it as straight as I can.

When I do go on dates, I have a nice time with people, but we usually decide we are better off as friends. I also get put off when guys talk about open relationships or want to talk extensively about their kinks (I have none) or when conversations just become about whether we're going to hook up later. I'm not really interested in talking about those things and I do not find myself spending much time thinking about them.

I totally get the need for service animals—they’re important and should always be welcome. But when it’s just someone’s pet tagging along, I can’t help but wonder: do we really need to bring dogs into spaces where food is being made or sold?

It feels like we’ve blurred the line between loving our pets and respecting shared spaces. Why is this becoming so normal? Is it about convenience, or are we just forgetting that some places aren’t meant for animals?

As a dog owner, I’m curious to hear other thoughts, especially from people who bring their dogs to these places. Why do we do this? And is there a better way to balance our love for dogs with basic hygiene and respect for others?",41,1750308439.0,SLO,17,0.86,False

This is going to be an essay so strap in.   

5 years ago I met a guy through socials. We chatted normally. He said he reached out because he knew me through child hood and hasn’t seen me in decades. I admitted I didn’t remember him so he doubled down and said my name sounds familiar but he doesn’t actually remember me. So I was like all good, we continued chatting. Reminiscing on some individual childhood memories, since we grew up in the same area, we talked a lot about what it was like back then. We sent memes related to the topic etc. it was natural, didn’t feel forced and he was genuinely sweet and had a great vibe. 

He started to show an interest, telling me how he’d never met a girl like me, how beautiful, sweet and funny I was and he just couldn’t get me out of his head.  But I was in a relationship then so I told him, and that because he professed his like for me I had to step back to not disrespect my partner. So he respected my boundaries and just chatted casually. I’d barely respond and sometimes take weeks to reply because I wasn’t interested. But he was persistent so in the least I chatted to him as a friend.

He kept up the communication for 5 years on and off. later after not speaking often for a bout 2years he reaches out consistently again. He finds out I’m single and he wants to connect so we talk. He had now moved to the states and I was in NewZealand so all our chats were electronic. A year goes by, things have been going amazing, our connection and feelings deepened and we spoke everyday for a year. Phone, texts, FaceTime etc. 
we both now want to meet. He offers to come to NZ but I’d never left the country so I thought it would be more fun to go to the states instead. We organise the trip and everything we will do. The excitement becomes overwhelming. We start speaking even more and connecting on a more sexual communicative level. He says all the things he wants to do to me and I him. We can’t wait. 

Finally!! I get to the states and he picks me up. We hug but I immediately notice he’s shy and awkward about PDA, no biggie I don’t push or sweat it. We get on a ferry and I see him sort of nervous and pondering something. He takes my hand and leads me outside to show me the view. I Immediately get butterflies knowing that would have taken courage for him to do. 
We get to our destination, he realises he locked the car keys in the car. He apologises so much and how he needs to go back home to get the spare. I have to wait at the ferry terminal for 3 hours. I’m totally okay. Even though I was tired, I’m so easy going and not once did my mind even go to any negative emotions. I hug him and say “okay baby I’ll just watch a movie and make calls to my family so they know I arrived so take your time”. He seems okay as he leaves. The whole time he checks in with calls and text. Apologising still and giving me his ETA. 
When he gets back I see his mood shifted. He looks annoyed and his vibe is tense so I chalk it off to him being tired from the days/nights events. I try to just change the subject to other small talks. 

We get to our hotel. He picked me up at 9am and we get to the hotel at 1am so I know we are both exhausted at this point. He gets my bag and immediately gets more annoyed because it’s heavy and has to pull it through rubble. I offer help and he shrugs me off with a weird “it’s fine”. 

We get to the hotel. Nice hot shower, finally able to relax and he starts getting touchy. We kiss and cuddle and then we go to sleep. He starts heating up and seduces me the whole night so I give in. It was nice and passionate. We hold each other and fall asleep entirely. 

Now the trip is 3 weeks. I was worried that it may be too long and too much for a first meet and I was correct. 

Around day 6 of our trip I start to get frustrated at the lack of physical affection. We’ve spoken about our love languages and I told him mine was physical touch. Just hand holding, cuddles or a random kiss here and there and he said he couldn’t wait to show me that affection. He’s even been practicing laying on his back so I could cuddle on his chest when we were finally together. He did non of that. He was so very distant, I’d bring it up multiple times over the trip and he would say he’s just not used to affection and he’s finding it harder than he thought. Coupled with his body language and being cold and lost in thought all the time I started to feel like he might not be attracted to me. These thoughts became confusing because everyday he’d wake up and get me my favourite coffee that he’s come to learn I love. He’d drive to the cafe chain I said I like to get it. He’d wash my laundry without me asking, make sure I ate and would ask if I’m okay consistently but didn’t want to touch me; kiss, hug, cuddle or hold hands, forget the intimacy. so I was really confused most of the time. 

After I decided to let the whole affection thing go all together he started with another attitude that became annoying to me. He’s obsessed with the gym. Which I knew as we talked about gym this and gym that all the time. Now full disclosure I’m on the fatish side and I’m very happy with my looks and very comfortable and confident in my body, fat, skinny or whatnot, I’ve always been like that. I have a good figure just not the snatched waist. I noticed that he may have had a problem with my weight just because what and how we ate he tried to controll all the time. I go to the gym 3 times a week and was looking forward to working out more with someone who could coach me and even told him the trip will a good way to develop discipline and good habits. But He tried to project his extreme workout ethics on to me immediately, taking the fun out of it. which if done positively I’d absolutely love and follow, feeling encouraged and motivated. But it was the opposite. He negatively pushed me everyday and always found a way to bring up working out. Once we went on a hike and he expected me to have a mountain lion’s climbing skills just because I said ‘I like hiking’ lol. Instead of motivational encouragement, he mocked me all the way up by saying things like “look even that old lady is passing you” and “why did you say you hike when you can’t” all whilst refusing for me to turn back or take breaks. I made it to the top and I was actually happy despite the negative connotations. And he calmed his ass down too at the finish line. 

Another issue that arose was because I was wanting foods outside of his ‘norm’ or budget or whatever (which I wasn’t aware of at the time, only suspected later), he started to say that I’m too “soft” and “fancy”. I could see him start to freak out when I suggested eating out. I offered to pay but his pride wouldn’t let him so I would actually just tell him “let’s go to the supermarket and get something from the hot food section” or “I’ll have what you’re having” and if permissible at our accomodation I would love to buy groceries and cook in etc. because he planned all the hotels and I know it was financially draining for him so I tried so hard to be mindful, accomodating without offending him. But all that didn’t matter. He would get mad randomly and highly stressed, anxious and overthink (like I could actually see the overthinking happening). This drained me so I started to distant myself a little by going out on walks a lot and just socialising with random people. 

One night at a resort we went to around week 2 he was so awkward, cold and distant I decided you know what I’m not going to feel low about myself because of your attitude, at this stage we only slept together 3 times all of which I initiated. So I dressed up, put make up on and spotted two women at the restaurant outside our hotel window. I went and asked if I can join them. They were so lovely and for the first time the entire trip I had so much fun. We ate, drank and hung out for hours. They both got up to go to the bathroom when I felt a hand on me. It was him. For the first time he had this look of lust, pride and adoration for me. He asked to take me somewhere and took my hand. I said goodbye to the ladies and he held my hand leading me to a beautiful sunset area. It was so romantic and he was so affectionate. I felt seen for the first time. He took me back to the hotel and he couldn’t wait to go inside. He kisses me and held me and then made love to me twice that night. I had a flicker of hope, maybe because we were at a resort, didn’t need to spend money and he didn’t have to plan anything except relax for 3 days, that he was finally calm. 
The day we leave the resort his mood starts to change again. He goes back to no affection, random subtle weight comments and back to “I’m just not used to this level of affection.” At this point I wanted to go back to New Zealand and I tell him that he’s been making me feel like shit for a majority of the trip. He apologises and he tries to accomodate my feeling but something just holds him back. We go to a different state and stay the last holiday time with his friends. They were so lovely. Constantly complimenting me, telling him how he’s so lucky to have found a kind, beautiful and intelligent woman. This made me so sad that it was others that were saying this and not the man I’m attracted to. These were things he said to me all the time when he was courting me before the trip. 
Days go by, still no intimacy, but he’s continuing to make sure he takes me every where, most of our touring he insisted on involved no big financial waste and a lot of walking, so at this point I confirm he has really been stressing about money. So I decide to do in home dinner nights where I organise and cook for him and his friends as a thank you for everything. He’s so happy. He loves the food and couldn’t stop boasting about how happy he was. On those night I’d go shower after dinner and come out to him having light candles etc and ‘asking’ if he can make love to me to show me that he’s thankful. It was out of the norm to be asked but I found it it very cute. We have a really good last couple of days of our trip. He starts showing a cute side to him. He even says he doesn’t want me to leave on the day back to NZ and I start to feel emotional too. 
I get back to NZ , we talk all the time as well. I ask him what he wants and where this is going. He says he needs time. I’m the first woman he’s ever been this close to and spent this much time with and it was hard for him. he’s not ready to make me his girlfriend, that he’s never had a GF and it’s a very big deal to him because once he does it, he wants to marry that person. I feel sad and try to give him time. I also ask if we can talk about why he acted certain ways on the trip. He dodged it multiple times and refused to talk about it. He just said finally to shut me up I felt ‘I have demons I have to work through’. A few months things start to get awkward again as all he asks me about is if I went to the gym. So I decided to end things because I’m not going down a road of having to feel like I can only get love from him when I live up to his expectations of a healthy weight. 
We don’t speak for 4 months because I don’t reply to any of his messages or answer random calls he makes.  But he continues to insert himself in to my life by liking almost all my stories particularly gym or meal prep post. Recently He reaches out to me again with hi how are you so for some reason I respond back with good and yourself? and immediately he asks how is the gym going? I’m pissed off and triggered all over again. I let him go because if it’s really about my weight, he now has a chance to go find his ideal type. Which is no problem for him because he’s very good looking, tall and kind. But yet he keeps coming back to me. I feel like I’m going crazy trying to figure out what his issues are and if I’m not reading the room correctly.
