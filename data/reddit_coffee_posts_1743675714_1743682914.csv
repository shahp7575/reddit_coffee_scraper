1jqgssp,https://www.reddit.com/r/justpoetry/comments/1jqgssp/a_life_without_meaning/,A Life Without Meaning,"Steam rises, curls, then fades away,  
like every dream, like every day.  
I sip my coffee, dark and deep,  
and ponder life‚Äîwhat do we keep?

A cog within the grand machine,  
replaceable, unseen.  
No mark remains when I am gone,  
just whispers lost in time‚Äôs cold dawn.

Perhaps my children, strong and bright,  
will carry forth my flickering light.  
Yet they, too, will fade to dust,  
like all before, like all of us.

Then grandchildren‚Äîyes, build for them!  
Shape their world, light their flame.  
But time‚Äôs cruel hands will claim them too,  
as history swallows all we do.

The weight is heavy, thoughts unkind,  
a futile chase, a weary mind.  
Yet in my hands, this warmth I feel‚Äî  
a cup of coffee, rich and real.

The future‚Äôs mist, the past is set,  
but in this moment, I forget.  
No need to chase eternity,  
but live this breath, and let it be.

Not for a legacy, not for a name,  
not for a world that forgets the same‚Äî  
but for the joy within this cup,  
for now, for me, and that‚Äôs enough.

1jqgng7,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewParents/comments/1jqgng7/i_just_feel_like_a_failure/,I just feel like a failure,"Im just so frustrated and overwhelmed and I feel like a complete failure.
I have a 3month old baby, and it‚Äôs just exhausting. And nothing at all like I expected, which is in no way the baby‚Äôs fault, I think she is doing quite okay - it‚Äôs just me I feel like I fail at every single thing I try, and I just sit here and cry.

I can‚Äôt get the baby to nap at all during the day - and I‚Äôve tried everything. 
Rocking, swaddling, going for walks with her in the pram, dark room, holding her, setting her down, wearing her, white noise, quiet, driving her around in the car, whatever. I‚Äôve tried every single thing I‚Äôve been able to google or every advice I‚Äôve gotten but nothing works.. So she is awake from 8am to 9pm every day. And the health visitor keeps telling me that it‚Äôs important she sleeps and I MUST make her sleep.
This has been an issue since she was 6 weeks old.
And then she just screams all evening because she is tired, and only when she starts screaming am I able to make her sleep after about 30 minutes by swaddling, rocking her while walking and singing (and no this doesn‚Äôt work at any other time - she will fight sleep so hard). And I feel like I‚Äôve tried every wake window time that exists.
And I feel myself getting upset with her that she doesn‚Äôt sleep, but I can‚Äôt be upset with her she is just a baby. So I just cry instead.

On top of that she hates tummy time, she will scream bloody murder if I try to put her on her side or her tummy. Which is yet another thing the health visitor keeps exclaiming is a problem. I try every day and so many things to make her enjoy it more.

I can‚Äôt take her out of the house for anything other than walks or she gets overstimulated and will cry all day instead of just in the evening. Though we do go baby swimming and to sensory and song play at the church (I‚Äôm not religious they just host) still every week, because I think it‚Äôs important that we do get out. But I hate those days, because she just cries and cries and cries all afternoon and evening.

I also didn‚Äôt produce enough milk to breastfeed in the beginning and had to supply with bottles. Since then she doesn‚Äôt want to breastfeed anymore because the bottle is easier, so I pump, but since she never sleeps, it‚Äôs hard to keep up with, so my supply is dropping, and I dont produce enough now. And while it‚Äôs not supposed to be a big deal, it‚Äôs just another fucking thing I‚Äôm failing at.
We just went through a period of 3 weeks where she had stomach issues and would scream 6-7 hours a day and nothing could be done to comfort or settle her. 
But we found out she was oversensitive to caffeine, so I had to cut that out. (Which means no coffee, no chocolate, no coke etc etc.)
It‚Äôs getting better and she hasn‚Äôt cried that much or had that much stomach issues for the past 5 days, and she smiles more now.
But that was another issue, and my first though was that I‚Äôm not even sure I want to give up my chocolate for the baby - and then having this though made me feel like crap and again a failure as a mom (because who prefers chocolate over their own baby?) 

I rarely make dinner, and the house is a mess - especially since I have 3 dogs as well, so it needs cleaning or at the very least vacuuming every single day. But i just dont have time‚Ä¶ so Thats another thing I‚Äôm failing at.
And I just feel myself getting upset with the dogs, even though they don‚Äôt do anything wrong, and they‚Äôve been my family for years, I‚Äôve had 2 of them since I moved away from home, and the third one was my dads I got after he passed away last year.
So I also feel like I‚Äôm failing as a dog parent.

My husband is gone Monday-Saturday from 4am to 8pm, not because he has too (he is hired to work 37hours a week) but because they‚Äôre just so busy and he likes what he do.
And sundays he is tired, but he does help with the baby, while I try to fix the house and get ready for another exhausting week.
Yes we can say he should help more, and honestly I thought he would, but he has always worked long hours, and I didn‚Äôt expect to fail at everything, so I didn‚Äôt think it would be that big a problem when I got pregnant.

I just don‚Äôt know how to do this, and I just cry because nothing is going well. And it makes me wonder if all of this will ever be worth it..
And then I wonder if it‚Äôs PPD, but the doctor says it‚Äôs not, since I can still see optimistically on the future, still look forward to things etc etc. 
Instead he thinks it‚Äôs just my adhd brain that‚Äôs messing with me, because I can no longer just do whatever I feel like in the moment. And exhaustion so I should sleep when the baby sleeps (which is not great advice, when the baby never sleeps)

Sorry I don‚Äôt actually need advice I think, unless someone can teach me a magic trick to make the baby fall asleep.

I just needed to vent.

(Also sorry if the language isn‚Äôt 100% clear - English is not my first language)

1jqglil,https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/1jqglil/seeking_handson_collaborators_for_an_oss/,Seeking Hands-On Collaborators for an OSS Tokenization Experiment,"Hey r/solana,

I'm the founder of [repo.trade](http://repo.trade), and I wanted to reach out directly to the r/solana community. After months of building, we've created a system that lets open source developers **tokenize their github repositories** in a way that generates sustainable support without compromising on open source values. We've built this on top of Solana üéâ!

First, some validation: We received an honorable mention at Colosseum's RADAR Hackathon üèÜ and presented at SuperteamDE Demo Day in Berlin earlier this year üá©üá™

Right now, I'm specifically **looking for developers** who:

* Maintain active open source projects
* Already have a small but engaged community around their work
* Are interested in exploring new sustainability models for OSS

This isn't about selling you on anything - quite the opposite. We're looking for thoughtful collaborators who can help us refine this approach by going through the actual process of tokenizing a repository. Your feedback and experience would be invaluable in shaping how this evolves.

The system creates **engagement tokens** that community members can use for things like voting on feature requests or exclusive access, while **generating ongoing revenue** for maintainers through liquidity provision and trading fees on a Raydium Pool. What makes it different is that it's not about fundraising but about creating aligned incentives between developers and their communities.

If you're curious about experimenting with this approach or have questions about how it actually works in practice, I'd love to connect. We're still early and learning, and **direct collaboration with experienced Solana developers with Open Source repositories and a community is exactly what we need right now.**

Feel free to DM me or comment with questions. I'm happy to discuss the mechanics, limitations, or potential use cases. If you've read all the way to here, I owe you a coffee - this is not legally binding üòÉ",1,1743681779.0,solana,1,1.0,False

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it‚Äôs time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero‚Äôs journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can‚Äôt even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don‚Äôt wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

1) Maida and Sugar aren't bad foods,: the internet trend of classifying food as bad and good needs to stop , there aren't necessarily bad and good food, Maida and sugar both carbs are necessary fuel for the body, but as is with any food excess could be detrimental, so combine you parotta with protein of your choice add some fiber on the side and you have a nice balanced meals. Remember Dosage is what matters

2) Getting wet or not drying your hair causes fever : No it doesn't, 

3) Herbal medications don't have side effects : They do have side effects, the misconception arises from the fact that there's less research on them

4) Mixing curd and non veg is bad : It's not, mix anything and everything , and eat according to your taste , ( but not pinneapple in biriyani) 

5) Immunity boosters and Detox : anything claiming to boost immunity and detoxify your is a sham and if you have a healthy liver it does both, so avoid alcohol and smoking and have two unsweetened cup of coffee for liver health.

That's all, hope you have a healthy life..

1jqgeyi,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/1jqgeyi/the_awkwardness_in_having_an_almond_mom_who_also/,The awkwardness in having an almond mom who also shames you if you're diagnosed with an ED (possible TW),"Having a parent who's obsessed with diet and weight loss is bad. Having a parent who shames you if you're diagnosed with an ED is bad. But having both at the same time in the same parent??? It's awkward and also ironic.

When I lost weight at 16 years old I came from a slightly overweight BMI but had always been ""the fat kid"" almost everywhere (probably because I'm short and BMI looks higher). I went from >!BMI \~25.3!< to >!\~20!< in >!8-9!< months by first quitting junk, sweets and snacking, and then >!counting calories and eating less!<. It was all congratulations, and my mom complimented me a lot: my legs, my face, my stomach, and my habits and willpower. Then, when I felt I was obsessing and my physical health suffered, I asked for help. And because I was a minor I had to be with one of my parents during the sessions with the ED doctor. **Suddenly, the compliments turned into shaming.** *""You have an eating disorder"", ""You can't have sucralose with your coffee, doctor says you have to add sugar"", ""These are your yogurts \[flavored and with added sugar\] and these are mine \[low fat and sugar free\]"",* and saying *""It's because she has an eating disorder""* whenever someone complimented me in front of her.

But the weird thing came when I got discharged. When we were driving to the city where I studied, we stopped at a restaurant and I ate a bit of the bread basket. She and my father said>! *""\[My name\], don't eat so much bread, bread is very fattening, it has a lot of carbs!""* !<and that was the moment I thought all the worries about my ED was all a farce. And the next day, while she was helping me move into my dorm, she said>! *""\[My name\], don't get used to keep sweets around, you look good now""* !<(great warning about Freshman 15 but I still had it). And for years, she still started arguments because I had an ED (even thought it was all mental, I didn't even need the nurse, I wasn't underweight and still got my period!!!), but at the same time, she complimented me whenever I lost noticeably and scolded me when I was eating ""too much"" or had ""bad stuff"". Nowadays she almost forgot about my ""ED past"" but a few weeks ago asked me why I developed it. I just said *""Insecurities""* even thought it much more complex.

Last time she said something triggering... today. For context, I gained from >!BMI \~21.4!< to >!\~24.7!< in about >!3-4!< months because I stopped working and had issues with binge eating, that's why I am seeing a dietitian. And from January to nowadays I've lost to BMI \~23 and still working towards more (but in a healthy way). And a few hours ago she said >!*""How soon you got back your figure!""*!<. I joked and said>! *""Did I lose it?""*!< and she said (kinda ashamed) *""Oh no, I mean, you were heavier during Christmas""* (not because of Christmas but around that time, for context). I just said it was normal because I lost my job (which was all day standing). But it's kinda weird. **She shamed me for the same things she was congratulating me and is again doing, just because I asked for help and got a diagnosis.** What is the logic? Is just the medical diagnosis(TM) that makes it a burden, but if there's no diagnosis (because there is no evaluation) then the same behaviors and even a weight loss to a low BMI (not yet, just wondering) are not only fine but expected and complimented? To be fair it's not something that hurts, that's why I don't worry about it and don't even try to talk to her about this (she has her issues). But it's... ironic, contradictory and hypocritical.",3,1743681240.0,EDAnonymous,1,1.0,False

It‚Äôs raw. It‚Äôs real. It‚Äôs not against spirituality‚Äîbut it is against performance, erasure, and the weaponization of pity: 

The system is my shepherd, I shall not trust it.
It leads me beside broken promises,
It gaslights my soul.

It prepares a clipboard before me
in the presence of judgmental smiles,
And an invoice in the name of mercy.

My cup overflows with shame I never asked for,
And yet‚ÄîI drink,
Because there is no water in the desert of approval.

Surely pity and PR shall follow me
all the days of my pain,
And I shall dwell in the brochures of righteousness
as long as I am useful
and white
and tragic
and quiet.

But I will not bow.
I will not perform my grief in your sanctuary.
I will not become your redemption story
told over coffee by people who can afford insurance.

My body is not a miracle.
It is a ledger of debt unpaid
by every system that said ‚Äúcome to us‚Äù
and then made me prove I deserved to be here.

Blessed are the boundary-holders,
the no-sayers,
the women who walk out of the church
with their heads high and their pain intact.

Amen‚Äîand fuck you.

Amber and Trent were saying they've sent messages, told her she needs to do this or that ... and I can imagine the tone of those messages ... But if you actually Love Anna then why not take a more caring approach (not ""give in"" üôÑ) but just show some kindness and care and say Hey I know things haven't been great between us but we'd love to have you over or see you or go for a coffee or whatever?? ... at the family graduation thing yes you could see that Anna was very closed off but Amber didn't miss an opportunity to make digs at her either so how was that helpful? ... right after Amber asked her what she'd been up to she just had to point out that She was making the effort to have a conversation  ... Just Stop ... I do think Anna was being honest and genuine when she said that nothing she does is ever good enough and I'm sure she feels that to the depths of her soul ...

your kids never stop being your kids so I firmly believe there's more responsibility on the parents to bridge the gap, show love and acceptance and lead with compassion and understanding  ... adult kids share in that and ""should"" give the same in return but some aren't always capable at the time for whatever reason so it's up to the parents to reach out and show that no matter what that child is loved ... and didn't Amber listen to her counselor when he was standing up for Anna and talking about her attachment issues and that she didn't create them, they came from the rough start she had in life? ... to me that says it's very obvious Anna needs some extra care ...

Week 2: Still good, until that 9am class hits you hard on Tuesday morning.

One month in: You skip one online class. Then another. You say you'll catch up on the weekend but go party instead.

Midterms: Your roommate reminds you they exist. Suddenly you realize you're way behind on everything. You spend nights cramming, somehow pass, and promise to do better.

A few weeks of peace. Then second midterms come. Same panic, same late nights at the coffee shop.

Finals: Pure survival mode. You're watching lectures at 2x speed, making study guides, and barely sleeping. But you pass.

Then you tell yourself next semester will be different. Spoiler: it won't be.

I'd love to make a connection with the program and also get the inside scoop about the program to make sure it's not malignant (I doubt it is, but you never know).

The first three months were amazing, and we both fell really hard for each other. But looking back at it we should‚Äôve given it a bit more time for her to process the whole cheating heartache. Anyways, in November she started getting drier, and one day towards the end of the month, she told me that she was emotionally numb and couldn‚Äôt really feel anything (due to finally getting hit with the fact that she had been betrayed by her ex), but I wasn‚Äôt ready to give up on this and her, so i kept trying to keep her happy and be there for her in every way possible. I drained myself trying to keep everything in place with no expectations from her in return. But in the second week of December, she finally had enough and told me that it was unfair for me and that it had to stop, hearing this made my heart shatter, and I had an empty feeling for days but I had no other choice than to respect her decision. We stopped being something romantic after that but we kind of became best friends and we texted all day long. This was hard on me aswell because I still had very strong feelings for her but as previously stated I had no other choice and wasn‚Äôt ready to lose her as a person. 
Now, in the last week of december, I ran into her at the same coffee place, sitting with her friend and a bunch of guys, seeing this didn‚Äôt bother me, but she thought it did, and as soon as she got home, she called me while crying and apologising for everything, she said that she didn‚Äôt feel right sitting with them and they were her friend‚Äôs friends,and that she realised that she still had feelings for me. I was overjoyed hearing this, and we met the next day, kicking off again going into another honeymoon phase. However, this time it did not last as long as we started fighting really badly over little things after a few weeks, and then we fought for one last time and broke up. The confusing part about this was that I thought that she was the one who dumped me, and she thought that I was the one who dumped and abandoned her.
After this breakup, I was heartbroken but I decided to move on with my life, and (I know this was immature of me but I decided to find a rebound).
A few days later, a girl approached me and asked for my number, and we started talking. I talked to her for only three days, and then I realised what I was doing was wrong, I still loved the previous girl, so I blocked this girl. And amazingly the same day a few hours later, my ex reached out to me to resolve an issue, where we did resolve it, but then we switched the conversation to the breakup and she asked why I abandoned her, and I was startled hearing this, because I had felt that I was the dumpee previously. We both decided to try to fix things, but she asked if I had talked to anyone during the days we weren‚Äôt together, I knew admitting to it would‚Äôve ruined my chances with getting her back so I lied and said that I didn‚Äôt. We tried fixing things for the whole of February, and because of different opinions on the breakup, we fought everyday but then in March, we sorted everything out, and termed this as a fresh start. Everything was getting back to better, but we had our fights, and she would term me as immature in every fight, and that she would breakup if I didn‚Äôt get mature, it was as if she was emotionally moving on from me. Then towards the end of march, we met after a fight to resolve it, when she asked to check my phone, and during seeing my dms with a friend, she found screenshots of me talking to this girl in January. She asked what this was, and I tried lying that I was fooling my friend that I was moving on, however the number i was texting was actually my cousin (there was no proof of the chat, as we had talked on disappearing messages). Then after lying to her continuously, I admitted to lying and told her that I deserved to be dumped now, and she did exactly that. She texted me later, that she would forgive me if I told her the truth. And I did tell her the truth this time, but she thought there was more to it and I was hiding more things, she claimed that I still talk to that girl and I was cheating on her, and I tried clarifying but it didnt work. Now it‚Äôs been a few days since the breakup, and I‚Äôm sitting in regrets, heartbreak and Ive learnt my lesson. I miss her and I know what Ive lost, and I have promised myself that I will never lie again, but that doesn‚Äôt stop me from drowning in regrets right now. I wish that I had come clean to her, and told her right when she asked me, instead of continuing the act. I know what I‚Äôve done is wrong, but what I‚Äôm more concerned for is what she must be feeling like. I saw first hand how getting cheated on broke her inside once, and now even though I didn‚Äôt cheat, she thinks I did, and she must feel the exact same way, and I hate myself for bringing that feeling of doubt upon her",1,1743679796.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I used to use a Moka pot and even using supermarket ground coffee, I seemed to get a much nicer coffee from that than the bean to cup machine. The coffee just seems flat or acidic. I've tried using the same brand whole beans that I used the ground version of for my moka pot, but they taste awful. I've also tried some beans bought online from wonky coffee and exhale (I'm in the UK). Still no decent coffee is coming out this machine. The only drinkable coffee is heavy milk based drinks eg. Cappuccino. Yet in product reviews, people rave about it. Are they only used instant coffee and don't notice how bad it tastes? Are bean to cup machines just terrible? Or am I doing something wrong? 

It's quite a simple machine and the only variable is the grind size. You can't change the temperature of the water.

I'd be very grateful for anyone's input, particularly if you've had the same machine. I feel like I have a waste of money taking up space on my counter at the moment. ",1,1743679673.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

Maybe some of you can relate.

So I had this client who suddenly decided they didn't want to pay anymore, loved my work, but just didn't want to pay. Instead of following our contract's 60-day notice period, they just announced one day that they didn't want any more invoices or work. But get this, they then asked me to do MORE work after saying that!

Then came the ambush meeting. They invited me to a coffee catch-up but it was just to nitpick my services and manufacture reasons to break the contract. 

Classic move, right?

I'll admit, I was initially very hurt. Exceptionally Angry. Frustrated. All those emotions we feel when someone tries to screw us over. 

I started spiraling, taking it personally, questioning my work.

But then I had this moment of clarity: A contract is a contract. This isn't about me as a person, it's just business. They made a commitment, regretted it financially, and were trying to weasel out. Nothing more.

I remembered reading about how all these business titans we admire, Branson, Musk, Disney, they all faced massive failures and setbacks. Bankruptcies. Exploding rockets. Getting forced out of their own companies. What made them succeed long-term wasn't avoiding these problems but how they handled them: as data points, not personal catastrophes.

So I pulled myself together, documented everything, and wrote a calm, professional email referencing the specific contract terms they'd agreed to. No emotional language, no accusations, just facts.

The funny thing? 

As soon as I removed the emotions, I felt in control again. Whatever happens next, I know I'm handling it professionally.

Anyone else dealing with clients trying to pull similar stunts? If so, how do you keep your emotions in check when business gets messy?",8,1743679491.0,Entrepreneur,2,0.9,False

**The Problem:** After pulling a shot, I consistently have a noticeable layer or pool of water sitting right on top of the coffee puck in the portafilter. The puck isn't drying out like I see in videos.

**My Setup:**

* **Machine:** Breville Barista Touch (Brand New)
* **Grinder:** Built-in conical burr grinder
* **Basket:** I've tried both the dual-wall double basket and (more recently) the **single-wall double basket**. The problem happens with both, but I'm focusing on the single-wall now.

While I work on nailing the dose weight and grind size, is there any *other* common reason why a **brand-new machine** would consistently leave pooled water, especially with a **single-wall basket**? Could the severe underdosing / potentially very coarse grind I was using *cause* pooling rather than just a super fast, messy shot? Or is this wet puck almost certainly just a symptom of not having the basic dose/grind dialed in correctly yet?

I haven't been able to get a ""dry"" puck yet and want to ensure I'm not missing something obvious before spending hours dialing in the dose/grind perfectly.

Thanks so much for any insights or advice!",1,1743679039.0,BrevilleCoffee,2,1.0,False

I remember when you kissed my forehead
The vibration made by my nerves could have shaken an earthquake to it's bare bones, stifled the conceited effort nature cracked the earth with, in it's swollen fingers 
This is not a love letter
Though your lips worked together so up close and personal trying to deliver it
I almost believed it was considering the address was scribbled so eloquently
In the warm glow left behind above my brow where you had stamped the postage 
Secondly the envelope that encased your tongue admittedly made me stumble my own script
As I replied return to sender in my mind as I didnt feel worthy of the gesture as written
Sometimes I am able to speak pathically in response to these things, but that only happens in coffee shops or restaurants when I'm focusing on not trying to do it
In moments like these there are fractures in reality where open minds can understand me
Only most do not understand themselves deep enough to know what is happening, and just question why I am staring at them so intently from across the room before they get self conscious and get up to leave after informing a manager on duty that I am making them uncomfortable 
I'd like to remind you again, this is not a love letter
That is I mean, unless you want it to be
Trying to get in those last words is usually thwarted by being asked to please pay my tab and not come back anymore 
At least the manager understands the depth as they pander an apology from their pineal gland and send,
a kiss on the cheek to me while escorting me out the door
Word on the street is that a smile is worth it's weight in gold
This explains my financial instability while making my face appear old
A wrinkle in the time it takes to make eye contact and then look away
Your mailing address is stained inside my memory
You cant blame me if I stole your wallet because I'm not even a decent pickpocket
Maybe you should be more cautious when you airdrop your thoughts into the ether
Because no matter how intimate you caused this pause in time to be
In order to relay vibrational waves of your vernacular through my bowl of electric meat jelly
This was never intended to be a love letter
While it may be a coincidence the post office was closed
My reasoning for showing up at your home
And having to explain this to the police
Was that although I may be a good mind listener
I'm not by any means a good fucking mind reader

Like feeling like my brain is coated with sludge and not able to work as efficiently as it should.  Went in to work yesterday and it was actually a nice distraction, even tho at work I used to go in the bathroom every hour to hit my juul lol.  

This morning I'm kind of going through it.  Having my coffee and hitting my juul first thing in the morning... sigh.  This is probably the time when I've missed my vape the most.  I just put on the patch, since I don't sleep with it on.   It's helped a little, but I will probably have a piece of gum once I'm done with my coffee.  I have been a bit constipated too lately, sorry for the tmi.  

Please if you are considering quitting, use the patch!!!! I tried to quit for about a day in September, and I only used the gum.  My vape was constantly on my mind, I want to vape I want to vape I want to vape.  Always.  But with the patch and the gum, I don't have that anymore.  It is such a massive difference, and is what has made quitting this time bearable.

I have felt the cravings the the urges and the muscle memory of going to reach for my vape after eating or while in the car.  And I have said omg I really wish I had my vape right now.  But truthfully I do not actually want it.  I want to be done with it forever, even tho the addiction makes me feel like my vape is a dear friend I'm losing lol.  I'm kind of feeling all over the place this morning.  

I'm hoping that over the rest of the week and the weekend I can find a bit more stability in my vape sobriety and maybe not have to use all 100% of my brain power to stay off it.  And then hopefully I can resume all the normal things in my life I've had to forgo in trying to quit.

I told him, in a loud carrying voice, that I would be out in a jiffy, while settling myself down to a long lingering bath. The music I toned down. Bitter experience had taught me that admirers of my music were a select group and that detractors were often vocal (in a non-musical way). Bertram was open to visitors, convival if that's the word. But not in the morning. Not while in the bath. Not to Lord Proudfoot.

The last night had been long. Parts of it were, so to speak hazy. The sky was no longer dark when I returned, or was returned to the flat. Jeeves had looked fatherly, but a trifle disapproving as he undressed me, noting the red stains on the old collar (or what had been a collar in better days) and the unsteady walk of the young master. So, what was noon to Lord Proudfoot was more in the lines of a bleary-eyed morning to me. And I certainly needed the bath after last night.

There's nothing like a couple of eggs, done just right, with a cup of coffee and a brace of toast to set you right after a late night. I could feel parts of the night filtering back to me as I tamed the runny yolk and downed the coffee. The exact details escaped me, but I could recall some gin of the best sort, some of that heady music the new places on the West End love, and a black cocktail dress. Later parts of the night (or early morning, if strict accuracy is required) were more hazy, but I could recall the dress lying on the floor and heavy breathing.

As I wiped the last morsels from my mouth and sighed, I could hear a loud stamping without and Jeeves respectful firm voice,""I fear, your Lordship, that Mr Wooster is unavoidably detained. A matter of the utmost urgency..."" There was an oath (the sort that is removed from books of the fruitier sort) and the door opened unceremoniously. The last and the noblest of the Proudfoot clan burst in.

""Proudfoot, old man,"" I said with a feeble attempt at a nonchalant air. His face seemed red and he seemed unable to speak. I heard loud breathing and all evidence seemed to point to it coming from the Proudfoot chest. ""Long time no see"", I added to break what seemed to me to be an awkward silence. Jeeves hovered around the door, coughing like a sheep and looking gently remorseful.

""You ---"", he uttered another of those unspeakable words, but this time it was one more suited to the dockyards. Ignoring the rampaging elephant in the room is all very well, and the stiff upper lip is what makes the Woosters the Woosters, but I felt that the time had come, perhaps to ask him gently what the devil he meant.

Jeeves cleared his throat. ""If I may intervene sir"", he said, as if he was discussing an obscure poet of the eighteenth century, ""His lordship appears to be under the impression that you spent last night in his bedroom."" I was flabbergasted. Bertram is known to spend his nights in his own bed, in nightclubs, occasionally even in what are called houses of ill repute, but the Proudfoot establishment is one I give a wide berth.

Old Proudfoot didn't seem to believe in explanations. He expressed a desire to wring my neck, but before he could delve into the details, his mind seemed to wander, and he opined that he wanted me boiled alive. I tried to impress on him the trifling practical difficulties associated with these actions, and he seemed impressed with my way of thinking, for he expressed his opinion that shooting would do the trick.

""Hate to contradict you, old top"", I said with an attempt at nonchalance, ""but I was in Soho all night."". ""And why would I be in your bedroom anyway?"". He expressed his desire to consign Soho to the netherworld before asking me not to test his patience. ""My wife, don't attempt to deny it, was once engaged to you"", he said, pompously. I could have told him that this was true of half of London's fairer sex, but I felt the hour for glib repartee had passed.

""I was at at my country seat last night"", said Proudfoot. ""And when I arrived this morning, I saw my wife in bed..."" ,here words failed him and his face went crimson. ""Horrifying"", I said. ""The lax twentieth century. Modern women. A century ago, and she would have got up at dawn, and had your brekker ready, and sat at the hearth eagerly awaiting your return."" Jeeves said something poetic about a housewife plying her care.

""None of your cheek!"" he shouted, though I failed to see what that part of the anatomy had to do with it. ""I say her lying in bed"", I said. ""And she was..."", he paused uncertainly here, ""only partly dressed, and on the bed was this tie"". Here, he dramatically flourished a Drones club tie, with a jaunty B.W on it. ""Forgot to dress completely, did we"", he said with a sneer.

I stared at the tie in dismay. Had I ......no, it was impossible. I hadn't worn my Drones club tie last night. In fact, I never wore it on my sojourns to what Victorian writers call the seamier side of London. Anonymity was Bertram's motto on these occasions. A few earlier escapades having made their way to my Aunt Agatha's disapproving ear, my modus operandi these days relied heavily on the incognito.

While I tried to explain this, Proudfoot was most perplexing. He appeared unable to follow my train of thought, instead saying something irrelevant about a horsewhip. My palms started sweating and I could feel the old heart begin to thump, when there was a gentle cough.

""If I may interrupt, your Lordship"", he said bowing ever so slightly. ""I believe I can shed some light on this unfortunate situation."" Proudfoot said something about light being damned, but Jeeves' respectful tone seemed to strike some chord in him, and he listened. Jeeves turned to me. ""Sir, I hope you remember the minor disagreement we had regarding the purple ties that the Drones club committee had, unadvisedly, in my opinion, approved last month?"", he asked. I nodded. The memory rankled. I had scored what I considered a rare and historic victory in that skirmish, with Jeeves giving in, almost without a fight, with a humble ""Very good, sir"".

""I regret to say, sir"", said Jeeves with an apologetic cough, ""that a few days later, I was remiss in forgetting your instructions about the purple tie. "" I stared at him. My mind had been occupied with various other matters like a racehorses and cards, but come to think of it, I hadn't seen that tie for ....Jeeves was speaking again, ""I took the liberty of presenting the tie to my friend Gilbert, mistaking it for certain unwanted items of clothing you had asked me to dispose of earlier."" Proudfoot was having nothing of it. ""Gilbert, my foot!"", he exclaimed. ""A likely story. I don't know any Gilbert!"" he said his face now bypassing red and settling at magenta.

Jeeves was unwavering. ""I regret to say"", he said, in a soft gentle voice, as if announcing a death, ""that my friend Gilbert is very well known to your lordship, though your Lordship may know him better by his surname. He is employed by your Lordship,"" he continued, almost in a whisper ""as gentleman's personal gentleman. ""Your Lordship"", he continued, unnecessarily, I felt, ""may know him better as Brown.""

Proudfoot stood still for a moment. I noticed, not without some satisfaction, that the magenta had faded from his face, replaced by a pallor that made Jeeves offer him some brandy. ""I am sure there is some perfectly innocent explanation"", he murmured gently. ""A certain degree of disarray of the clothes is not uncommon in the state of sleep"", he added, adding something about the sweet innocent sleep that nourishes life. ""Disarray is not the word I would choose"", murmured Proudfoot darkly. ""But what is your proof?"" he asked, suddenly suspicious.

Jeeves produced an elegant piece of notepaper. We read, ""Received, two purple Drones club ties, in good condition, two black trousers."" And under a scrawly signature, the words Gilbert Brown. Old Proudfoot sank into an armchair. In a last, feeble attempt, he asked ""Why would you collect a receipt for clothing you give away?"" ""Before I entered Mr Wooster's employment"", Jeeves said, ""I was in the Duke of Chiswick's employment. There was a somewhat disagreeable situation regarding the Duke's clothes which had been given to the gardener. The clothes were later found in a summer house in the Duke's grounds in the company of one of the kitchen maids. If the gardener hadn't been found hiding in a tree near the scene, in a state of undress that was most unsuited to the winter cold, the Duke could have experienced some degree of embarrassment.""

As Proudfoot trudged to the door, Jeeves added, ""May I suggest to your Lordship, that knocking at a door before entering, is a habit which if cultivated, often saves much embarrassment. When I was in the employment of the Duchess of ..."", his voice trailed off as the door clicked shut. ""Poor Brown, ""I said. ""I believe he may be in for a rough time."" ""I fancy not,"" said Jeeves. ""I took the liberty of telephoning him shortly after I saw the socks in his Lordship's hands. ""Brown, though an excellent man in many ways, has a weakness for the ladies. I first met him when he was a gardener in the employment of the Duke of Chiswick.""

""After his uncomfortable winter night up the tree, he gave up gardening....."", Jeeves voice trailed off as he shimmered away to the kitchen to make tea.

This goes back to the 1980s when America would give us 'string loans'... that is... they loan us $X but it can only be used to buy American products.

There was a time when in a supermarket big loooong aisles full of US stuff.  

Over the years we started to quietly replace them with local products so that we didn't those loans.  

We also started buying from other islands so that we had stuff from T'dad and of course, China.

Just before Trump did his tariff thing I looked at where my stuff came from.

Okay, everything that plugs in comes from China.  Almost all my clothes come from China.

Now, my groceries.

I buy local stuff and stuff that comes from T'dad and every where else.  Like this yogurt I use on my cereal comes from France, the other from Spain and the cereal is Jamaican.   The coffee is Jamaican and I use Lasco instead of coffee mate.

The kind of flat breads/wraps i use are made in Jamaica as are the vegetables, soup, porridge, chocolate... in fact... I read labels before purchase.

if you look on the roads we have Toyota, Sukuzi... I haven't seen a US car since some years ago this Dodge.

I think Jamaica is not going to suffer very much because we wisely moved to standing on our own.

Unlike traditional lattes, which use espresso, a matcha latte is crafted using matcha, which has a unique, rich flavor profile due to its distinct processing and high antioxidant content.
Matcha itself is made from shade-grown tea leaves, which are carefully dried and ground into a fine powder. This process preserves the vibrant green color and high concentration of nutrients, including L-theanine, which is believed to provide a calming effect. The combination of matcha and milk offers a balanced taste‚Äîearthy yet slightly sweet, with the natural umami of matcha complemented by the creaminess of milk, whether it‚Äôs whole, almond, oat, or any preferred alternative.
The preparation of a matcha latte starts with whisking matcha powder with hot water, creating a smooth and frothy mixture. This matcha concentrate is then poured into a cup, and steamed milk is gently added. The result is a frothy, smooth drink with a beautiful green hue, often topped with a thin layer of foam.
A matcha latte is not just a visually appealing beverage but also offers numerous health benefits.

So I, 20 F have an older sister 33 F, Lisa. Me and her have the same mother but different dads. She and i used to be very close, when i was little. She was 13 when i was born and from what my parents told me, she was obsessed with me from the start, carrying me around, dressing me up and playing with me. As i got older, she got more busy with her studies, leaving our hometown for university but still sending me letters every now and then, telling me she misses me. From my perspective, she was a happy person, who loves her family and me. But as she started dating her now husband 33 M, she started to change, growing a bit distant. I was the first to notice and started to feel uncomfortable around her but was too scared to tell her, as I didn‚Äôt want to cause drama and of course still loved her. I started resenting her now husband, as i thought he was the reason she changed. I told my parents about my feelings and they told me to give it time, which i did, but my feelings didn‚Äôt change, my doubts grew. But i pushed it away and cheered her on, she finished her studies, got engaged and married and i was happy for her. I observed her with her husband and she really seemed to love him, as did he. They rarely fought, seemed to have the same dreams for their futures and had a strong and stable relationship. Of course that was only from my perspective, i of course asked her how she was doing and how life is going whenever we texted or met up, she would usually say that everything is good and that she is alright. If she did have a fight with her husband, she would come to my parents and of course they would welcome her with open arms and be there for her. As she later got pregnant with her daughter, my niece, 4 F, i was really excited. But then the first big problem came up. She wrote a letter to our mom. I haven‚Äôt read it myself but our mother told me what it said. To sum it up, my sister wrote to my mom about how she didn‚Äôt want to see her, about how she wasn‚Äôt a good mother to her. I was distraught at that, since I didn‚Äôt know that Lisa felt like that. When i asked her, she would say, she‚Äôs fine and she didn‚Äôt seem to hold any resentment towards our mother, she didn‚Äôt let anything show. I asked our mom for more details and it is not my place to share too much but i can give you some insight: our mom was a single mom ever since my sister was a toddler, her ex husband was a slacker, who didn‚Äôt take good care of their family, his sisters and mother would always put our mom down, not approving of her and my mother was fed up, so she asked for a divorce. Since she was a single mom, not receiving much financial support from her ex husband, she had to work a lot, not being able to make a lot of time for my sister, which, as a kid, was hard for her to understand. Her ex husband apparently told my sister a lot of bad things about our mom too. And our mom had depression and went through some tough times, which my sister sadly became a passive part of. While i was upset with my sister, i also tried to understand her point of view, i was also sad because our mom grew quiet and regretful. She of course accepted my sister‚Äòs request, still upset that she might not be part of her daughters or granddaughters life. When the baby was born, my sister reached out to reconnect, putting up rules for our mom, saying that she would tell our mom, when she wanted to meet up and where and our mom accepted every request, even starting to change her entire personality, to accommodate my sisters requests. That went on for four years, my sister reaching out, when she wanted to meet up, which wasn‚Äôt a lot, but our mom never complained and always tried to make time, to see her granddaughter and daughter. My sister then got pregnant again, with my nephew 1 M and we were all excited. When Lisa was in Labour, our mom was there for her and i watched my niece while everyone was at the hospital with Lisa. I thought that things finally got better, that we could at least remotely go back to how things were, of course i was glad, that my sister was going to therapy to work through her childhood traumas and i just had to accept the fact that she would never be the same person from my early childhood. But every now and then, i noticed some passive aggressive remarks from her. Just to give you an example, we were at a big family gathering once and i was seated close to my sister and her family, my niece asked if i would play a game with her, of course i said yes and sat down with her, as my parents walked past and i asked them if i could later during the meal sit with them and some family members, to have a chat, as I usually would just sit on my phone during such gatherings and wanted to avoid that. My sister overheard my question and went ‚Äûyou don‚Äôt have to play with (niece‚Äòs name), if you don‚Äôt want to.‚Äú of course I immediately said, that that is not what i meant and only later i understood, how much my parents were walking on eggshells around my sister, accommodating to all her requests and wants, not saying anything that could upset her, even if it should have been said. My parents were scared to be thrown out of Lisa‚Äòs life again, so they changed completely around her. But that didn‚Äôt go well for too long. One time my parents were at my sister‚Äòs, having coffee, suddenly my dad asking my niece, how she would feel about them picking her up from daycare and getting some ice cream, to which my niece excitedly replied with yes and jumping around. My dad of course then added, that my niece would have to ask her mom, to make sure she was on board with that, but my sister didn‚Äôt reply. Our mother later told me, how my sister shot daggers at our mom for the rest of the afternoon, before sending her a message the next morning on how my parents didn‚Äôt seem to respect her boundaries, putting her on the spot and not accepting her requests, about how she wanted to call the shots on meet ups or when my parents would be allowed to pick up their grandkids. My mother cried the entire day, my dad tried to resolve the issue, telling my sister how he was the one, who asked my niece about getting ice cream and how she wasn‚Äôt fair to our mom. My sister then cut my parents off and my parents cut her off. Our mother said, that she was tired of walking on eggshells around my sister and that she was tired, that she couldn‚Äôt see her grandchildren that often, though we are living quite close to my sister. I was torn, I didn‚Äôt want to lose contact to my sister and niece and nephew but I didn‚Äôt want to seem like i was backstabbing my parents, by keeping contact to her. Even though my parents told me that they would not be upset with me if i kept contact to Lisa, it didn‚Äôt feel right to me. She changed so much, but not for the better and after what she did i knew i would not be able to look her in the eyes anymore. So i made the tough decision of cutting her out of my life as well. She tried to contact me for a while, but i responded with short and emotionless messages and did not text her at all anymore, she then stopped as well. I still see her in public sometimes, as we live pretty close to her but i do not talk to her and still cry myself to sleep sometimes because i feel terrible. AITAH?",1,1743677938.0,AITAH,6,1.0,False

like every dream, like every day.  
I sip my coffee, dark and deep,  
and ponder life‚Äîwhat do we keep?

A cog within the grand machine,  
replaceable, unseen.  
No mark remains when I am gone,  
just whispers lost in time‚Äôs cold dawn.

Perhaps my children, strong and bright,  
will carry forth my flickering light.  
Yet they, too, will fade to dust,  
like all before, like all of us.

Then grandchildren‚Äîyes, build for them!  
Shape their world, light their flame.  
But time‚Äôs cruel hands will claim them too,  
as history swallows all we do.

The weight is heavy, thoughts unkind,  
a futile chase, a weary mind.  
Yet in my hands, this warmth I feel‚Äî  
a cup of coffee, rich and real.

The future‚Äôs mist, the past is set,  
but in this moment, I forget.  
No need to chase eternity,  
but live this breath, and let it be.

Not for a legacy, not for a name,  
not for a world that forgets the same‚Äî  
but for the joy within this cup,  
for now, for me, and that‚Äôs enough.

1jqfb3p,https://www.reddit.com/r/gachagaming/comments/1jqfb3p/in_what_ways_has_gachas_been_a_positive_influence/,In what ways has Gachas been a positive influence on you?,"Throughout this sub, talks of gachas being predatory and causing addictions is brought up often. But I want to ask the opposite. How has gachas been a positive influence on you?

I'm a normie that played a couple of gachas before Genshin (Love Live and Valkyrie Crusade), though Genshin is the only one that I've stuck to for more than a year. Although I've played Genshin since 2.0, it was only this year that I really got into other gachas and explored this space. This year, I've tried games such as Blue Archive, GFL2, ZZZ, and WuWa. Though Genshin is the only one that has really stuck to me and has continued to create a positive influence on my life. Maybe because I'm just such a normie that doesn't understand the hate the game receives...

But anyways, here's a list of positive effects gachas has had on me.

**1. Regulating spending**

As crazy as it sounds, gachas has helped me stopped spending as much money. Before I really committed to Genshin, I was someone that would go buy lunch everyday, or randomly decide to not wanna cook dinner so I'd end up ordering takeout. Gachas made me realize that it's so not worth it. I'm in Canada and the typical takeout nowadays is like $15... I can get an entire battlepass for $15! And that $15 is a one time thing per patch! Rather than multiple times a week that adds up! I get way more enjoyment from Genshin, and look forward to it everyday, compared to a $15 dollar meal that gives me like 10 minutes of enjoyment, that I could've gotten simply by just cooking a meal myself!

**2. Helped me quit Caffeine**

This also is part of cutting my spending because I used to spend $2 everyday for a cup of coffee... Then I opened my third eye and realized a Welkin costs around $6... So for $6, I can get 3 days worth of caffeine, or for $6 I can get a welkin to enjoy getting primos for a month... Hmmmm... Exactly

**3. Life is basically doing dailies**

Dailies in gachas are just a slow grind that takes small amount of time in our day to progress our account. But doing this habit throughout gacha, has made me realize that this is no different than how real life is. We build habits that if we were to do everyday, would reward us similarly to gachas. A single daily doesn't amount to much, but doing dailies everyday for a month? There'll be significant progress.

**4. Not as desperate for partners**

With the existence of the internet, society is more lonely than ever. Everyone has experienced loneliness at some point or another, and in my case, I've experienced it a lot as I have moved a lot for school and family circumstances. I've ended up dating bad people, getting into situationships, getting super intoxicated at bars/clubs in order to find anyone just to not be lonely... But now, I'm less desperate as gacha waifus offer me a substitute over toxic relationships. I understand that it's not a replacement, but in the meantime, waifus help me be less desperate and help me have healthier standards for partners.

**5. Reducing game time**

Gachas helped me spend less time playing video games overall, as I can get the same enjoyment of progression through short daily play. Throughout high school, I would spend hours playing League of Legends and neglect school work and almost failed. When I finally worked my ass off and made it university, gachas helped regulate my screen time, where I was playing no more than 30 minutes a day, so I ended up studying for the most part and ended up getting straight As and scholarships.

**6. Regulating sleep**

I'm the type of person that lives in the moment and I hate sleeping. If I'm awake, I'm always finding something I enjoy doing and I would end up just not going to bed at all. Gachas give me a reason to want to go to bed, because I know that when I wake up tomorrow, I would've had my stamina bar filled and I can look forward to doing my dailies. Sleep is that thing I do now because it refills my gacha staminas lol.",22,1743677654.0,gachagaming,31,0.77,False

my friend idris recently shared this wild story from his first job, and i‚Äôm still shook.

idris was 17 when he started at this grimy call center. back home, he‚Äôs got a whole crew of geese in his yard‚Äîhe‚Äôs obsessed with them, treats them like pets, and has a favorite named blinchik (russian for ‚Äúpancake‚Äù). he brought a little wallet-sized photo of blinchik to work, just to keep his spirits up in that depressing dump. but his boss, dave, saw it and flipped out. dave had this hardcore rule: ‚Äúno personal items on your desk. it‚Äôs about professionalism.‚Äù meanwhile, his own desk was a trash heap‚Äîold mugs, random figurines, even some rusty fish statue. idris says dave had these weird ticks: he‚Äôd go from passive-aggressive whispers to fake-nice vibes in a heartbeat. total oddball.

anyway, dave clocked the goose photo and went nuclear. he made idris rip it to shreds in front of everyone, muttering about ‚Äúrule-breaking.‚Äù idris, just a 17-year-old kid, froze‚Äîhe had no clue how to stand up for himself back then and just did it. he says he almost cried but held it together so he wouldn‚Äôt look weak in front of the team. blinchik‚Äôs photo was toast, and dave smirked like he‚Äôd just won something.

idris wasn‚Äôt letting it slide. dave want me to obey? I‚Äôll maliciously comply with him. next day, he rolled in with nothing‚Äîno pen, no notepad, no headset. when dave asked what the deal was, idris hit him with, ‚Äúyou said no personal items. i‚Äôm waiting for the company to hook me up.‚Äù dave lost it, but idris doubled down: ‚Äúit‚Äôs your rule.‚Äù the team jumped in‚Äîhalf of them stopped bringing their stuff too, and the whole operation tanked. customers were raging on the phones, calls were dropping, and dave was scrambling to make everyone ‚Äúwork normal.‚Äù eventually, he caved and mumbled, ‚Äúfine, bring what you need, just keep it lowkey.‚Äù idris came back with a fresh blinchik photo and slapped it on his desk. dave didn‚Äôt say squat.

but it gets crazier. a couple weeks later, dave tried to fire idris for ‚Äúinsubordination.‚Äù idris, now sharper, had recorded the whole ‚Äúno personal items‚Äù freakout on his phone (legal where we‚Äôre at) and sent it to hr with a rundown of dave‚Äôs hypocrisy. hr didn‚Äôt axe dave, but they gave him a slap on the wrist, and he chilled out. then the real bomb hit.
turns out dave had been skimming cash from the petty cash box for years‚Äîsmall grabs, but steady. idris says he cooked up the rule obsession to keep everyone stressed and off his trail. he‚Äôd snag money from the drawer‚Äîsupposedly for coffee, paper, office junk‚Äîand mark it as ‚Äúoffice needs.‚Äù it added up to a hefty chunk, though no one‚Äôs dropped an exact number. his weird mix of passive-aggressive jabs and over-the-top strictness kept newbies like idris too spooked to dig deeper. that photo meltdown? idris figures dave was just flexing to throw everyone off his scent.

dave got busted when a senior coworker noticed the ‚Äúoffice expenses‚Äù weren‚Äôt lining up. they canned him, and later even filed charges. idris says he‚Äôs still stoked about how he accidentally took down a crook by playing dave‚Äôs own dumb game. blinchik‚Äôs still chilling in his yard with the rest of the geese, honking at anyone who steps too close.
so, reddit, what‚Äôs the call? is idris the king of payback

The alarm rings, but your body feels like lead, your mind foggy, and your motivation nonexistent. Sound familiar? If you‚Äôre wondering how to wake up early and energized or how to wake up quickly when tired, you‚Äôre not alone.

Several factors can make mornings tough: poor sleep quality, disrupted circadian rhythms, mood imbalances, or even dehydration. Then there‚Äôs sleep inertia, that sluggish, groggy feeling that can last minutes or even hours, making it hard to start the day.

Many people turn to coffee or energy drinks for a quick fix, but those come with side effects like jitters and crashes. The better approach? Improve your sleep quality, hydrate properly, and develop a consistent routine. Here‚Äôs how.

# Start with Hydration

After 8+ hours without fluids, dehydration can leave you feeling groggy. Even mild dehydration affects mood, focus, and energy levels.

* Solution: Keep a glass of water by your bed and drink it immediately upon waking. Cold water can boost energy and alertness.
* Bonus: Staying hydrated throughout the day supports digestion, brain function, and steady energy levels.

# Get 10 Minutes of Morning Sunlight

**Sunlight boosts serotonin, which improves mood and alertness.**

* Solution: Open your curtains as soon as you wake up or take a quick walk outside. If that‚Äôs not possible, bright indoor lighting can help.
* Bonus: Regular morning sunlight exposure resets your body clock and improves sleep quality.

# Use a Light Alarm Clock

Waking up to natural light feels refreshing for a reason. Light alarm clocks mimic sunrise, making it easier to wake up naturally.

* Budget Pick:¬†Philips Wake-Up Light Alarm (\~$35‚Äì$40)¬†‚Äì Simulated sunrise, multiple brightness levels, natural sounds, and an FM radio.
* Mid-Range Option:¬†hOmeLabs Sunrise Alarm Clock (\~$45‚Äì$50)¬†‚Äì Gradual brightening before your alarm, nature-inspired sounds, and multi-color LED options.
* Premium Choice:¬†Hatch Restore Smart Sleep Machine (\~$120‚Äì$130)¬†‚Äì Sunrise simulation, calming sleep sounds, and customizable bedtime routines.

# Boost Energy with Exercise

A 2019 study found that morning exercise enhances cognitive performance and reduces fatigue. Another study showed that high-intensity workouts help shake off sleep inertia faster.

* Solution: Try a short cardio session, yoga, or even stretching to get your blood flowing.
* Bonus: Regular morning workouts improve sleep quality at night.

# Meditation & Yoga: Mindful Mornings

Breathing exercises and meditation increase oxygen levels and circulation, reducing fatigue.

* Solution: Try deep breathing, guided meditation, or gentle stretching.
* Bonus: These practices reduce stress, improve focus, and set a positive tone for the day.

**Meditation Exercises to Try:**

* 1-Minute Deep Breathing¬†‚Äì Quick energy boost anytime.
* 10-Minute Relaxation Meditation¬†‚Äì Great for reducing stress.
* 30-Minute Ocean Visualization¬†‚Äì Helps with creative thinking.

**Quick Yoga Routines:**

* 3-Minute Midday Stretch¬†‚Äì For an energy boost.
* 10-Minute Morning Flow¬†‚Äì To wake up muscles and improve flexibility.

# Morning Journaling: Cut Stress by 20%

Journaling fosters clarity, reduces stress, and promotes mindfulness.

* Solution: Spend 5 minutes jotting down your thoughts or practicing gratitude.
* Bonus: A gratitude-focused mindset improves well-being and reduces stress.

# Eat a Balanced Breakfast

Skipping breakfast can lead to fatigue and decreased focus.

* Solution: Aim for whole grains, lean proteins, nuts, and low-sugar foods.
* Bonus: Avoid overeating, too much food can cause sluggishness.

# Cold Showers: A Shock to Wake You Up

Cold water (below 70¬∫) stimulates your nervous system, making you feel instantly alert.

* Solution: Try a quick cold shower or splash cold water on your face.
* Bonus: Cold exposure boosts endorphins, improves circulation, and enhances mood.

# Caffeine: Use Wisely

While coffee can help, too much can lead to energy crashes.

* Solution: Limit intake to 1-2 cups before mid-afternoon.
* Bonus: Staying hydrated with water can prevent caffeine dependency.

# Good Sleep Hygiene: The Key to Waking Up Refreshed

* Consistent Sleep Schedule: Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day.
* Cool Room Temperature: A cooler bedroom promotes better sleep.
* Reduce Screen Time: Blue light disrupts melatonin production.

# Final Thoughts

Waking up early and feeling energized starts with small, sustainable habits. Whether it‚Äôs drinking water, stretching, or a morning journal entry, consistency is key.

If you‚Äôre looking for how to wake up quickly when tired or how to wake up in seconds, try splashing cold water on your face, taking a brisk shower, or doing some light stretching. Build a morning routine that works for you and stick with it, your energy levels will thank you.

Everything annoys me. Then I have to wake everyone else up, so they can do their shit and not one of them seems to care if they never woke up. I'd love that. Just sleep until I'm done sleeping and not giving a fuck. Although, I can't say what's in their heart or their motivation.

The house is a mess, I filled the water pitchers and ice machine before I went to bed and they're of course empty. Trump is president making everything worse and it just keeps happening. My boss is dumb as shit. It's hot as fuck again.

I can't see a damn good thing in the morning and I dwell on everything bad. I try not to. It's not just the morning, but it's worse in the morning.

Hurrah! It's been a dream since visiting family there as a kid, but current realities being what they are, it is now time to shit or get off the pot, as a beloved Scottish relative of mine would say. Thanks to that selfsame relative, I'm now in the unusual and fortunate position of being a (confirmed) UK citizen with a UK passport.

How ‚Äî and more importantly, where ‚Äîwould you advise a non-spring chicken single adult to go about starting a brand new life in bonnie Scotland?

As is so often the case when it comes to Scotland, geography is the major problem. Glasgow would be the obvious move since that's where I've spent the most time, and for better or worse I do love it, but nevertheless there's a big difference between a curated tourist visit and actually moving there, and anyway I don't have my connections there anymore, since my friends have rudely fucked off to London, the tossers. The presence of cosmopolitan city life, gay people, and decent coffee are pluses for me, which would seem to make Edinburgh an even more obvious choice, but I worry Edinburgh might be too fancy, expensive, and upwardly mobile for a scruffy, unambitious little miscreant like myself. Basically, I'm trying to find a cheap 'n' cheerful landing place where I can acclimate a bit and find some basic work and accommodations ‚Äî I'm not above service work or getting cozy with roommates ‚Äî while still having some access to the more cosmopolitan, foreigner-friendly circles of Scottish society. So maybe somewhere that's within an hour or two of one or both of those cities, ideally through excellent train or bus access, and it'd be a big bonus if there's decent unis around too, as I'm hoping to retrain in... something... when my head stops spinning.

1jqf3i4,https://i.redd.it/drsie3gjklse1.jpeg,My first decaf - EVER!,"As I posted before, I think my caffeine was getting out of hand at 3 x 3 cup Mokas before lunch :)

Someone suggested I try defaf, which I have never ever tried before in my 56 years of life, and I was expecting awful coffee that I would just have to put up with. I think my mind was set to when decaf was seen (in supermarkets) as just catering to a wied minority need and no thought was put in to taste or anything else.

I purchased Decaf Espresso from Square Mile as I am a fan of their tastes, particularly red brick although that seasonally changes, so I thought at least it would have a chance of being somewhere near acceptable.

Standard method for me - 3 cup Bialetti, aeropress filter, fill to the valve and basket top (about 19g) , 1.2 grind on Ode Gen 1.

To be honest, I was like an excited little kid waiting to see what happened. The Moka brewed exactly as it usually does, a little more crema-esque  perhaps but still that clean engine oil colour I love. Taste: Wow. Just as extracted, same consistency and mouth feel. Exactly what I want in a cup! I ruin it with a dash of milk and a spoonful of sweetner which I suspect gives it more of a samey feel as regular coffees and there's some subtle flavour differences but I suspect they are just variances of bean to bean type.

I would definitley say that for me, with this taste in coffee and brew style, decaf has no compromises. Apart from ¬£2 a bag more! I may end up with one regular and 2 decaf now!",6,1743676910.0,mokapot,2,0.87,False

My response to learning this was, ""and yet there were no signs?""

I came back to it, because I just love these characters, and needed to finish and post it.  This is my fourth story writing about Kate and Rick and their future together with kids. I ""Always"" use the Time Travelers story minus the Senator thing. Just a little easier to write it that way as I'm more familiar with Kate as a cop.**

**Not even sure if there's any interest in this kind of story, but it was important for me to finish and get it posted. Anyone that has read my stuff knows that everything I write comes from my love of these two characters, and their love story.**

**I believe that Kate Beckett would have been a phenomenal mother, using her own moments with her mother, and the regrets she has of lost time with her, and channel them to her daughter.**

**Someone once wrote a review complaining that I put too much of myself in my stories. Okay, Yeah, I do. I love these two characters, and I will never apologize for the way that I view them or write about them. As always, I don't acknowledge season 8, so all my stories reflect their marriage in season 7 and beyond.**

**For anyone that has issues about my using Castle as Kate's last name, I view simply as she keeps Beckett at work and Castle Always at home. Especially with a family where you would want continuity.**

**I hope you like this mother, daughter moment, and I hope I did it justice. Thanks for reading.**

It was a crisp autumn day, with the leaves lightly blowing over a well-worn path. Kate Castle loved this kind of day and loved being with her daughter Lilly (aka Flower). They were making one of their many sojourns thru the cemetery on their way to visit Joahnna Beckett's grave. She was carrying the blanket, and coffees, and her daughter was carrying a bag of bear claws. Kate had made this journey so many times thru her life, many of them alone and with a broken heart, where she sat and sobbed for hours while talking with her mother.

As time passed and her family grew, she found that it didn't hurt anymore, or at least not as much. It was always wonderful to sit and talk with her mother while with her daughter, and Lilly having her mother's middle name always has seemed to be closest to her mother the most. Her boys Jimmy and Royce liked to come, but Flower was the one that initiated many of their visits.  She had found that the last couple of visits had been about girl talk more than stories about her mother, as Lilly had heard many of those already. They would talk in the quite and sacred ground of her mothers grave, as if them being among her somehow allowed her mother to channel and surrond them in her warm embrace.

They both turned to look at the gravestone.: Johanna Beckett underneath that was: Vincent Omnia Veritas, and underneath that was, Feb 4th, 1951-to Jan 9th, 1999.

""Hi Mom... Love you,"" Kate whispered.

""Love you so much Grams,"" Flower said.

Looking at her mother's stone always gave her a mixture of love, sadness, and regrets, too many regrets to mention. Being here with her daughter however gave her a warm feeling as if she was channeling her mother's love for her and giving it to her daughter. So many lessons of what to do and what not to do. Kate had a laundry list of what not to do and used many of those examples of her failures in trying to help her daughter navigate her teen years.

Kate handed the coffees to Lily and proceeded to lay the blanket down. Kate took the coffees back, and they both plunked down on the blanket and started to munch on their pastries and drink their coffee.

Kate looked at her beautiful daughter and smiled, ""You going to tell grams about being selected MVP of your conference?"" Lilly was the center for the freshman basketball team at Marlowe Prep. She was only 15 and a half but was already 5ft. 7 inches.

""Mom, she already knows,"" Lilly chided her mother.

""What,"" asked Kate, ""Can't a mother be proud of her daughter?"" Kate had already let 1PP know that she was putting in her papers for the 30 years on the force. She would be close to 54 by then, and it's not like they needed the money with how successful Ricks writing career has been. She wanted to spend more time with her husband and kids, in what was their formative years as teenagers. Not one to just sit around, she had told downtown that she could do remote work from home on new training procedures for recruits, and other programs she'd been trying to push thru for years, but she didn't need to still work 10-12 hour shifts to get that done. Plus, she'd grown tired of all the political bullshit down at 1PP, as she was never a political animal.

""Mom, can I ask you a question?"" Lilly asked.

""Of course, Baby, you know you can always ask me anything.""

""How many people have you brought here with you?"" Lilly inquired.

Kate thought for a moment and said, ""Well, obviously grampa, then your father, and you kids. Thats it.""

Talking while her mouth was full of bear claw Lilly asked, ""When did you bring daddy out?""

Kate always found it amusing that her daughter still called Castle daddy.  Usually, kids stop saying that as they become teens, thinking it embarrassing to call a parent that. Kate knows she stopped really early, but Lilly was such a daddy's girl and was never embarrassed about either her nick name Flower or calling Castle daddy. Kate found that so refreshing. It absolutely amazed Kate on how comfortable her daughter was in her own skin. Flower lacked a lot of the insecurities that come in the early years of being a teen. She always felt that her husband had a lot to do with that. His praising and constant reaffirming their decisions and letting them always know that their mom and dad had absolute belief in them. She hoped that was the reason anyway.

Kate mused for a second over Flowers question then said, ""The year of our engagement. I asked him to meet me out here.  He was working on his next book, and I was at work, I was still a detective then. When I showed up, I saw him already waiting for me, with a beautiful bouquet of lilies.""  Lilly saw her mom tearing up, ""Then as we stood at her grave, he asked me if he could talk to her, and of course I said yes. He knelt in front of her grave and I could hear him talking to her. When he got up, and he turned around and he was crying.""  Kate had tears rolling down her face now. Her daughter knew how much her parents loved each other, but it always amazed her just how much. Kate continued, ""I asked him what he said to her, and he said, ""I thanked her for raising a beautiful person, and to thank her for allowing me the chance to have her in my life."" Lilly reached over and hugged her mother, as Kate was crying.

""Love you mom.""

""Love you too Flower... Your father has turned me into such a sap as I get older."" She chuckled as she wiped the tears from her eyes. 'You know...I never really liked being here with grampa. We grieved in different ways. I would talk to my mom about things like relationships, and work, and my drive to find her killer, and I didn't want to do that with Grampa around. So, your dad and you kids are really the only ones that I don't mind being with, but you'll always be my favorite companion Baby.""

""You're my favorite too Mom... Did you know that all my friends, and Jimmy's and Royce's too, think that you and dad are the best parents ever. Every single one of them. They all complain about their own parents, and say they wish their parents were more like you and daddy.

Kate looked at her daughter with such disbelief, ""How can they say that. It's not like your dad and I don't argue. I don't think were any better or worse than any other parent.""

""Oh, please mom, your biggest argument is daddy putting too much garlic in the Alfredo sauce, or what movie to watch.  My friends come over and see you always touching each other, if your cooking, daddy has his arms around your waste or you're kissing his cheek. When you watch movies, your head is on his shoulder or he's massaging your feet or you're running your hands thru his hair. All my friends see that. The other day Melissa got so tired of watching her parents argue day after day, that she screamed at them that she wished the Castles were her parents, and that she was sick of their arguing.""

Kate was flabbergasted at what her daughter was telling her. She never really paid attention to what Castle, and her did. Kate thought to herself, 'Great, now Melissa's parents are going to hate us."" Her daughter continued.

""Daddy came up behind me the other day on his way to his office and gave me a kiss on the cheek. I had just heard Melissa's story about what she said to her parents, and I had her thoughts running thru my mind.  So, as he walked away, I said Daddy, do you ever notice how much you and mom are affectionate with each other? Why do you think that is?"" and he said, ""I don't know Flower, I think it's just our way of telling each other 'Always."" Then he walked away, and I didn't understand what that meant. Do you know?""

As soon as she heard what her husband said the tears came again. ""Daughter, you seem hell bent on making your mother a sobbing mess today."" Kate trying to regain her composure as she looked at her daughter, waiting for some answer, Kate started to pull of her wedding ring. She gave it to Flower and said, ""Look inside the band Baby, and what does it say?""

Flower took her mom's ring and inside she saw a beautiful one scripted word *Always.* She looked back at her mother and said, ""Is this on Daddy's too?"" Kate nodded.  ""I take it that it has great meaning?""

Kate smiled, and Flower saw her mother look to the sky as Kate said, ""Baby, that's our word, and our word only. It's one word with so much meaning. I love you, I'll be there for you, you have my heart, I'll stand with you till the end.  It's a loving warm embrace wrapped around us in just that word, and I remember to this day, and I will till the day I die, every single moment it's been said to me...You know, the first time he said that to me, he had just beaten up a trained killer who had his gun sights on me. While they were bandaging his hand, in the med unit I told him thanks for having my back in there, and he said Always. I remember thinking at the time that he just might have said I love you. I treasure that word with my whole heart. I was in another relationship at the time, which to this day I regret, but even then, our partnership meant everything to me. So that's the best way I can say it, and if you ask your dad, he will say the same thing, only better."" Kate laughed thru her tears.

""Mom, can you tell me how I'll find my always person?"" Flower asked.

""Thats going to be tough to answer Flower. The best way I can think of is to tell you about things I wish I'd done differently. I've got more regrets that the average person, I think.""

Flower smiled and asked, ""You mean, stuff like Rebel Becks?""

Kate huffed, ""Your father told you about that?""

Flower laughed, ""Some stuff... not all.""

""Well, when you get a little older, I'll tell you about your father riding a horse thru Central Park.""

Lilly giggled, ""Was he naughty Mom?""

""Very naughty daughter,"" Kate laughed, then turned serious, ""Flower, you're going to have a really tough time, because you are not only gorgeous (Kate had on more than one occasion at Policeman Benefit Fund gatherings or Castle's book promotions, taken Lilly with only to have some model executives try to talk to her about modeling. When Kate would see that, she would let them know in no uncertain terms, that they would be leaving in a body bag if they ever came near her again), but you also have your father's personality, and your kind to a fault. With your looks and your personality, you're going to have to beat off the attention of boys and later men.""

Flower lowered her head and let her long curls fall over her face as she turned beat red, ""Mom, will you stop that.""

Kate laughed and said, ""You not thinking that you're beautiful only lends credence to what I'm saying. Flower, you're going to have to sift thru a lot of boys that want nothing but sex with you. When I was young, I know that I had urges when I would see a handsome boy, and I'm here to tell you that I had sex at a young age, but I'm also here to tell you that I regretted it almost always the next day. At the time, it was all about pushing boundaries, I was always looking to not conform with the normal, but as I've grown older and become a mother, I see how my actions were my way of lashing out at my parents. I wanted freedom, I wanted to shed my shackles, and experience life. I'm not especially proud of myself for those moments and I caused my mom and dad a lot of grief, that I wish I could take back, especially since my mom died just a few years later. So much time wasted... and I wish every day that I could have spent more time with her. Time is never promised to us, and I learned that the hard way. So, make your time count. The one thing I have to say about your dad, and I is we were great friends before we formed a relationship. I think that friendship is a great starting point in forming a better foundation for your Always person. ""

Kate continued, ""There are certain things that I've learned over time Flower, on what makes for a great partner in life, that potentially could lead to your Always. Of course, it's great to have a handsome boyfriend, well-built is always nice too,"" Kate chuckles, ""But a relationship without mutual respect, without an understanding of who you really are, and what your goals in life are, is doomed to fail. That I can say with all certainty. As you get older, and you find your passion in life career wise, you will also need a partner that respects your career choices, and supports you in any way he can, and that advise goes as much for you as him. Thats the biggest reason why your dad and I complete each other.

""Did that happen to you mom?"" Flower asks.

""Yes baby, too many times. When Gramma died, I got rather self-destructive. You already know about grampas drinking, and well... I went out and let's just say I did anything I could to stop feeling the pain of her loss. I'll never regret getting my motorcycle or my tattoo, but there are many things that I'm ashamed of. After I became a cop, I set out to never fall into that trap again. I was and still am to this day in a male dominated field and getting respect has always been difficult. Even knowing what I knew to be true, I still got into relationships where my partner at the time thought less of my job than his. One was with an FBI agent who I was with for 6 months. I thought maybe he could be the one, then he takes a job and moves to Boston and excepted me to follow with total disregard of my job."" (Kate thinks to herself the total hypocrisy of that statement considering what she did to her husband and the DC offer. Just another regret she has and thanks the stars for her forgiving man).

""I had another one with a Doctor, that went on for about 9 months while your dad was my partner. He was a good man who helped many people all over the world, and it was nice for a while, but one of our biggest arguments other than he was so jealous of your father, was the fact that he could never understand why I would go out at all hours of the night to go to crime scenes, or stay late and do paperwork. He went out of the country many times, plus he was on call a lot at the hospital. We had many dates and times that were cancelled, and I accepted that for the most part, but if I broke a dinner date or time alone with him, he would be furious. He could not understand that incomplete or tardy paperwork could lead to the District Attorney probably losing a case and sending a criminal back on the streets. When I tried to explain this and say that he takes off all the time his response was ""But I save lives Kate."" Kate sighed with this next revelation, ""I already had strong feeling for your father then, that I fought constantly, so that and his indifference to my job were what eventually led me to break up with him. When your father first started to follow me around I couldn't wait to get rid of him, but as time went on I realized how much he respected me and my job.""

Lilly jumped in and said, 'He thought you were extraordinary, right mom?""

Kate blurted out, ""Lilly Johanna Castle, have you been reading Heat Wave after being told to wait until you were a little older?""

Flower lowered her head and looked up at her mother thru the hair falling over her eyes, ""Maybe a little?""

Kate gave her stern look, but couldn't help giving her daughter a smirk, ""I don't suppose that you skipped over pate 105?"" Kate looked at her daughter and saw her face flaming red.

""I might have causally looked it over...Skimmed would be a better word mom.""

Kate couldn't help but laugh, ""Oh, you are so busted!""

Flower giggled, ""Interesting reading mom. Nikki and Rook really getting it on.""

""You, daughter of mine and apparently smut reader, will not be telling this to your father anytime soon, otherwise he will burn all his books, and lock you in the room until you are 25, maybe even 30.""

""Mums the word mom!""

Kate getting back on topic said, ""The last thing that I will tell you baby about finding your always. Your dad and I fell in love each other, and a lot of it started because of our mutual respect that we had. We were and are partners in all things, and that is how in my opinion how a relationship works. Hand in hand in all things. To be able to count on someone thru thick and thin, is how you will find your always. It might not be a straight path Flower, and you might kiss a couple of frogs along the way, but if you keep in mind what I say, you will stand a better chance, of finding your one and done Baby. I believe with all my heart that you'll find your always. Your just too good of a person not to.""

Lilly slides over and lays her head against Kate's shoulder and lets her caramel-colored hair fall over Kate. Kate wraps her arms around her daughter and looks back at her mother's grave and says to herself, ""I finally got it mom, what it's like to have family and be loved. I think you'd be so proud of me, and you would adore Castle. I just love him so much, and I'm so sad that you can't be here in person, but I know your still watching over us, and I love you."" Kate kisses her daughter on her head, and Flower looks up to her and says.

""Hey Mom, is that scene in Heat Wave just made up?""

Kate smiles and says, ""Yes daughter, your dad and I were just friends when he wrote that book, so just his imagination."" As Kate gets up and starts to leave, she turns around and looks at her daughter and giggles, ""Buuuttt we did recreate the scene many times after we got together, plus added a few more.""

""MOM!"" Flower laughed.

Then Kate starts to laugh, then they both double over and laugh until they have tears.

Lilly, still reeling with laughter says, ""I can't believe what just came out of your mouth.""

Kate trying to regain her composure blurts out, ""I'm such a bad mother, and I'm so going to hell for that!""

Lilly embraces her mother and giggles, ""You're the best mom, you just have naughty thoughts.""

Kate with her arms around her daughter gives her a kiss on her head, and she starts to think of all the times she came here in grief and pain, and absolute desolation. Never in million years thinking that she could have this, and then a charismatic, annoying, man-child, writer, came into her life and turned her whole fucking world on its head, and gave her a life that she never thought possible. Kate kisses her daughter again and backs away swiping at the renegade tear that fell.

""You okay Mom?"" Flower asked.

""I'm fine Baby, I think it's time to go home before your father sends out the national guards. He can get a little overprotective sometimes. He tells me it's just because he loves his girls so much.""

Flower laughed and said, ""Last week I was late from practice by an hour, and I forgot to text daddy, and when I walked into the loft, he said that he almost put out an amber alert for me. So, I know how he gets, but you want to know something mom? I wouldn't want it any other way.""

Kate grabs her daughter's hand as they make their way out of the cemetery and looks at her daughter and says, ""Me neither Flower.  I'm just crazy about him you know.""

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ear mites are tiny parasites that can cause big problems for your feline friend. If you suspect your cat might have ear mites, it‚Äôs essential to know how to identify the signs and symptoms. This knowledge can help you seek timely treatment, ensuring your cat stays healthy and comfortable.

### Recognizing Common Symptoms

Several clear symptoms indicate your cat might be suffering from ear mites. Watch out for the following:

- **Frequent head shaking:** If your cat is constantly shaking its head or tilting it to one side, it could be an indication of ear discomfort.
- **Excessive scratching:** Pay attention to how often your cat scratches its ears. An uptick in scratching can hint that something isn‚Äôt right.
- **Dark or foul-smelling earwax:** One telltale sign of ear mites is the presence of dark, crumbly debris in the ear. This can resemble coffee grounds and often has a strong odor.
- **Redness or inflammation:** Look for signs of redness or swelling inside your cat‚Äôs ear. This is often a sign of irritation caused by the mites.
- **Behavioral changes:** Pay attention to general behavior changes. If your cat seems more irritable, anxious, or withdrawn, it could be dealing with discomfort from ear mites.

### Visual Cues to Look For

It‚Äôs essential to observe not just the behavior but also the physical state of your cat‚Äôs ears. Here are some visual cues that can help you confirm if ear mites are the issue:

- **Dirty ears:** Check if the ear canal looks dirty or has a lot of build-up. Ear mites thrive in dirty conditions, making this a significant visual cue.
- **Swollen ear flaps:** If the ear flap (pinna) appears swollen, it might be a sign of inflammation due to mites.
- **Scratches or wounds:** Notice if your cat has developed any scratches or wounds around its ears from excessive scratching.

### Identifying Ear Mites with a Visual Inspection

To diagnose the presence of ear mites, it might be helpful to perform a simple visual inspection. Here‚Äôs how you can do it safely:

1. **Find a well-lit area:** Ensure you have good lighting to thoroughly inspect your cat's ears.
2. **Calm your cat:** Make sure your cat is comfortable and calm. You might want to have someone help you hold the cat gently.
3. **Examine the ear canal:** Use a flashlight to look inside the ear canal. Look for any signs of the dark ‚Äòcoffee ground‚Äô debris that might indicate ear mites.
4. **Seek Professional Help:** If you see signs of ear mites or are unsure, contact your veterinarian for a confirmation and treatment options.

### Behavioral Patterns Associated with Ear Mites

Sometimes, your cat‚Äôs behavioral patterns can reveal the presence of ear mites. Here are a few patterns to observe:

‚Äã Got a Question About Your Pussy? Click Here for More Expert Advice --&gt; https://twocrazycatladies.com/cat-symptom-checker/ref/loganferret/   
- **Restlessness:** If your cat suddenly becomes restless or agitated, especially at night, it could be due to discomfort caused by ear mites.
- **Increased grooming:** You may notice your cat grooming its head and ears more frequently, trying to alleviate irritation.

### Importance of Early Detection

Early detection of ear mites is crucial. If left untreated, ear mites can lead to more severe health issues, such as ear infections or even deafness. Therefore, if you notice any of the above signs, do not hesitate to reach out to your veterinarian for a thorough examination.

Remember, your cat relies on you for its health and comfort. Knowledge is your best ally in keeping your feline friend safe from pests like ear mites. Always be vigilant and proactive to maintain your cat's well-being.

Effective Treatment Options for Ear Mites in Cats: A Step-by-Step Guide
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Ear mites are tiny parasites that can cause a lot of discomfort for your feline friend. They often thrive in the warm, dark environment of a cat's ear, leading to symptoms like itching, irritation, and even infection. Understanding how to effectively treat ear mites in cats can ease their suffering and restore their comfort. Here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide to help you through the process.

### Recognizing the Symptoms

Before starting treatment, it's crucial to identify if your cat has ear mites. Look for these common signs:

- **Intense scratching:** Cats may scratch at their ears frequently due to irritation.
- **Head shaking:** You might notice your cat shaking its head often to relieve discomfort.
- **Dark debris:** Check for dark, coffee ground-like debris in the ear canal, which is a sign of ear mites.
- **Odor:** An unpleasant smell coming from your cat's ears can indicate an infection.

### Step 1: Visit the Veterinarian

If you suspect ear mites, the first step is to visit your veterinarian. They can confirm the presence of mites through an ear examination. A vet's diagnosis is essential, as symptoms can often mimic other issues like infections or allergies.

### Step 2: Administer Treatment

Your vet will likely prescribe treatment options, which may include:

- **Ear drops:** These are the most common remedy. Follow the vet's instructions on how to apply them effectively.
- **Topical treatments:** Sometimes, topical medications can be applied to the skin to eliminate mites.
- **Oral medications:** In severe cases, oral medications might be advised to kill the mites throughout the body.

### Step 3: Clean the Ears

Cleaning is an essential part of the treatment process. Here‚Äôs how you can do it safely:

- Use a vet-recommended ear cleaner. Avoid alcohol-based products, as these can irritate the skin.
- Gently massage the base of the ear while applying the cleaner. This helps to break up debris.
- Allow your cat to shake its head‚Äîthis helps remove loosened wax and debris.
- Use a cotton ball or gauze to wipe the outer ear, but avoid inserting anything into the ear canal.

### Step 4: Treat the Environment

Ensure that your cat's environment is free from ear mites as well. These pests can survive off their host. To limit the risk of reinfestation:

- Wash your cat's bedding and toys regularly in hot water.
- Vacuum carpets and upholstered furniture to remove any possible mites or eggs.
- Consider treating other pets in the household, as ear mites can be contagious.

### Step 5: Follow-Up Care

After treatment, a follow-up visit to the veterinarian is advisable. They will check if the ear mites are completely gone and can suggest further steps if necessary. Monitor your cat for any recurrence of symptoms. If scratching continues, it may indicate a different issue.

### Maintaining Ear Health

Once you've overcome the ear mite issue, maintaining your cat's ear health is crucial to prevent future infestations:

- Regular ear checks: Inspect your cat's ears on a weekly basis.
- Routine cleaning: Clean your cat's ears as needed, typically every few weeks, using a vet-approved cleaner.
- Healthy diet: A balanced diet supports your cat's immune system, which can help keep mites at bay.

By following these steps, you can effectively treat and prevent ear mites in cats. Quick action, combined with proper care and hygiene, will help ensure your furry friend remains healthy and comfortable.

### Conclusion

Recognizing and addressing ear mites in cats is vital for their overall health and well-being. By identifying the signs of ear mites, such as excessive scratching, head shaking, and dark debris in their ears, you can take swift action to alleviate your feline friend's discomfort. Observing these symptoms, combined with visuals like the telltale dark crusty layers in the ear canal, can help you make informed decisions about your cat's care.

Once you've confirmed the presence of ear mites, following a structured treatment plan is essential. This involves consulting your veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and using prescribed treatments to ensure the mites are eliminated effectively. Home care is also important; maintaining a clean environment and regularly checking your cat's ears can prevent future infestations. Additionally, being mindful of your cat's interactions with other pets will also reduce the risk of re-infestation.

By staying proactive and informed, you can protect your cat from the discomfort of ear mites. Remember, a healthy cat is a happy cat, and taking these preventive and treatment steps will ensure your feline companion enjoys a quality life without the irritation of ear mites. Education is key, so keep an eye out for future articles that will help you stay informed about your cat's health needs. Your cat depends on you, and together, you can ensure they are free from these pesky pests!

Chart Context (4H ‚Äì Bitstamp):

Yesterday‚Äôs tariff news from Trump triggered a quick fakeout rally to $88,000 ‚Äî right into the strong sell zone ‚Äî followed by a sharp 6% dump. Classic manipulation.

Today we‚Äôre seeing a modest recovery. Price bounced strongly off the $82,000 area where thick buy walls are stacked. Price is climbing, but with low impulse so far.

‚∏ª

What to Watch Today:

‚Ä¢ Sell wall still active between $84,800‚Äì$85,000
‚Ä¢ Strong support remains at $82,000‚Äì$82,600
‚Ä¢ Break above $85K could lead to $86,800 and retest of resistance
‚Ä¢ But if sellers hold the line, we might revisit the $81.5K‚Äì$82K zone again

‚∏ª

TL;DR:

The market is still reacting to macro headlines, but limit buyers below are defending strongly. Watch how price reacts near $85,000 ‚Äî it‚Äôs the key zone of the day.

1jqesd9,https://www.reddit.com/r/kdramarecommends/comments/1jqesd9/plotdriven_romantic_kdramas_with_female/,Plot-Driven Romantic Kdramas with Female Protagonist,"I just finished Undercover High School, and I'm looking for recommendations for dramas that are similar to it (in that it has a fun, mystery-filled plot outside of the romance) but that are more romance-forward than it (so that the romance is still a main focus of the drama). **I want to find a Kdrama that focuses on romance, is still driven by a non-romance plot (preferably with a mystery!), focuses on a female protagonist who is capable/intelligent and fun to watch, and has a unique/interesting premise. I also don't want it to be a military or medical drama, and I would prefer the main characters to be in their 20s/30s.**

What I liked about Undercover High School:
- interesting/exciting plot concept (undercover spies! treasure hunt! conspiracy!)
- romance between characters who work together to complete their mission (fun romantic escapades!)
- high stakes (actually scary antagonist, characters driven by clear motivations, Good vs Evil showdown)

What I disliked about Undercover High School:
- the story revolves around the male lead's goals, and the romance plot is secondary‚Äîto the point where the male lead sometimes seems like he cares more about his mission than the female lead
- inconsistent tone (serious and then comedic and then scary and then romantic and then back to slapstick, without enough weight given to any of it)
- the female lead's story is extremely secondary to the male lead's (I prefer stories that revolve around a female POV character anyway, but it was frustrating that it always favored the male lead's arc and not the female lead's)
- kinda short (I miss 16-episode dramas! Not huge into the 80+ episode C-dramas, but I like more than 12)

Unfortunately, I've been watching Kdramas since 2014 and feel like I've seen all the best ones. I've struggled to find a Kdrama that I've really LOVED in years. 

Here's a list of Kdramas I've seen that I think fit into this category perfectly:
1. Sungkyunkwan Scandal (my FAVORITE Kdrama of all time. It has it all: a fun and sweet romance, a large cast that, though it is large, consistently has well-rounded and clearly motivated characters whether main or side character, a mystery permeating the whole show, political conspiracy, philosophical questions and moral implications, action scenes with the best character of all time [Moon Jae Shin, played by Yoo Ah-In], and a female protagonist who moves the plot forward and is incredibly likable)
2. Chicago Typewriter (another of my favorites of all time, coincidentally also with Yoo Ah-In‚Äîthis one loses points because it does favor the ML over the FL in terms of amount of POV time/it is fairly slow, but the story is beautiful, the romance is tightly woven throughout, there are clear stakes, and the FL is capable and fun to watch)
3. Lovely Runner (a newer one I've seen but incredibly well done‚Äîone of the best Kdramas I've ever watched. The romance is precious and ""giggle-and-kick-you-feet"" worthy, the premise is exciting and creates high stakes, the mystery is intriguing and keeps you on the edge of your seat, and the FL is capable and fun to watch)
4. Strong Woman Do Bong Soon (this is one that I used to be OBSESSED with and have since become rather critical of. It has the same problem with tone issues as Undercover High School has, but the plot and romance are both strong, and neither one overpowers)
5. 100 Days My Prince (the thing I love about this drama is the female lead! She is capable, interesting, has clear motivations, and is able to think her way through things. The high stakes missing crown prince plot is exciting, and I really grew to love the side characters)

Each of those dramas is one of my absolute favorites. Here is a list of kdramas I've seen and loved but aren't as tight, interesting, or balanced as the others:
- Extraordinary You (honestly deserves to be in the earlier list but falls flat for me because the FL becomes a sobbing mess like halfway through. I wanted her to keep her spark and keep going instead of relying on the ML to do things!)
- Hwayugi/A Korean Odyssey (LOVED everything but the ending!)
- Healer (fell flat for me after the reveal)
- Kill Me Heal Me (somewhatttttt problematic premise but I used to be obsessed with this)
- Secret Garden (used to be my absolute favorite; love the enemies-to-lovers meet-ugly dynamic that gets flipped on its head; would probably say this is too slow for me nowadays)
- W (LOVED the first half of this drama but felt like it fell flat during the second half)
- Tale of the Nine-Tailed (I honestly don't remember why, but I didn't finish this one, which most likely means it dragged somewhere? I remember liking the romance in this one though)
- Run On (not the most exciting premise ever but one of my favorite relationships in a kdrama ever)
- Moorim School (this drama is somewhat absolutely ridiculous and honestly focused a LOT on Lee Hyun-woo's character, but I honestly ate it up bc Lee Hyun-woo and Seo Yea-ji had such incredible chemistry)
- Extraordinary Attorney Woo (very unique, very well done, connected with the main character)

A list of Kdramas I've seen and liked:
- It's Okay Not to Be Okay
- He Is Psychometric (made me cry for hours)
- Goblin/Guardian: the Great and Lonely God (a must!!)
- Moon Lovers: Scarlet Heart Ryo
- Crash Landing On You (an absolute BEAST of a Kdrama, but I'm not huge on military dramas!!)
- Mr. Sunshine
- What's Wrong with Secretary Kim?
- Coffee Prince
- Rooftop Prince
- Doom at Your Service
- Suspicious Partner
- Her Private Life
- Touch Your Heart

List of Kdramas I've seen but was fairly neutral about:
- Romance is a Bonus Book
- Tempted
- The King's Affection
- Monstar
- Moonlight Drawn by Clouds
- While You Were Sleeping
- Melting Me Softly
- Scholar Who Walks the Night
- K2

- Heirs/Inheritors
- Love from the Star
- Gu Family Book

- Oh My Ghost
- Flower Boy Next Door
- Flower Boy Ramen Shop
- Rookie Historian Goo Hae Ryung
- Love Alarm
- My Demon
- Memories of the Alhambra
- Start-Up
- The King: Eternal Monarch


And, finally, Kdramas I absolutely dislike:
- Cheese in the Trap (literally makes me feel sick to my stomach when I watch it bc the FL just lets stuff happen to her and the ML is lowkey abusive to her)
- Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol (actually very much liked this at first but the twist grossed me out and the final like three-four episodes were AWFUL)
- Hwarang (a very interesting premise, but the FL starts off as a very cool character and then turns into a sobbing mess with no more plot relevance like 3 episodes in, in favor of the ML's story)
- Boys Over Flowers (I know this one is like The Drama that every other drama makes references to, but I have always hated the dynamic in this show)
