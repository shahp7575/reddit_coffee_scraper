I wanted to let you know about an all Female comedy showcase at The Stand on April 16, 2025 at 7:00pm! We’ve sold out our last three shows and expect this one to be no different. We hope to see you there! 



**Fembots Comedy Show By Human Female Comedians**

Featured in The New York Times, Fembots is a stand-up comedy showcase hosted by “AI generated” female comedians Emma Rogers, and Maria DeCotis featuring a line up of the funniest comedians in this simulation. The show will explore the hilarity of AI sex robots and the not so subtle misogyny of their male creators. Hosts will investigate the audience's relationship with AI while delivering a killer line-up of real, human women comedians.



“We wanted to make fun of the long history and inherent misogyny of gynoids, sex robots, and artificial intelligence. Look no further than the sex robot ‘Sweetheart’ created by Clayton Bailey in 1983 who not only was a sex aid with 36C’s and a voice synthesizer but also a functioning coffee machine. She’s every man’s dream! ” - Host Emma Rogers

1jwa812,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1jwa812/pizza_shop_owners_delivery/,Pizza shop owners (delivery),"I’m a bakery owner, but I’m asking pizza shop owners because this seems to be the type of restaurant that has the delivery model on lock. Are you still doing in house delivery or are you using door dash, etc?  Or both? I’m interested in adding phone order delivery to my bakery on the weekends and possibly through the lunch rush on weekdays. We make donuts, coffee, breakfast sandwiches, hot and cold lunches and obviously all the pastries you would expect from a bakery. 

We have customers begging us for delivery on a daily basis. We’ve considered DoorDash, etc but the online model would mean we’d have to reject a lot of orders as we run low on product throughout the day. It would really benefit customers to have an employee talk to them about their options as we sell out of flavors/items throughout the day. How profitable have you found having an in house delivery person? Are people even willing to place phone orders anymore?",1,1744322881.0,smallbusiness,1,1.0,False

1jwa7em,https://i.redd.it/09389u89z2ue1.png,I built a little tool called **WinPilot** — a universal AI Copilot for Windows,"The idea was simple:  
I was tired of alt-tabbing into ChatGPT every time I wanted help writing a SQL query, command, reply, or block of code.

So I made WinPilot:
- Press a hotkey (Ctrl + Alt + W)
- It captures your app, selected text, focused content, and a screenshot
- Sends it to GPT or Claude
- And returns the suggestion in a beautiful little popup — which can paste right back into your app

It’s like a Copilot... but everywhere on Windows 😄

Built with:
- .NET 8 + WPF
- Win32 hotkey manager
- OpenAI + Claude support (with image input)
- Fully local context parsing
- Open source and customizable

Today I am at 6ish DPO (maybe more, maybe less) and I've been having cramping, a bit of nausea, a headache, stomach issues, and pelvic pain.

Are you looking for a math nerd with an rbf but soft inside?

I am a recent applied Mathematics graduate in Texas. Currently in search of something for my field while I work at a coffee shop. 

About me:

I am a very straight forward person who enjoys things being clear. Improving at things and doing things efficiently is something I really enjoy doing. I have a somewhat dry/sarcastic/witty sense of humor and can enjoy dark humor. For those interested, I am an INTJ.

I am a nerd (as shown by my major). My hobbies include building, painting, and playing Warhammer 40k. I also enjoy gaming (mainly PC). My favorite game series is monster hunter. Recently I have been playing marvel rivals, Minecraft and monster hunter wilds.

My favorite music is 2000s/alt rock like breaking benjamin, sleep token, and three days grace.

I enjoy reading fantasy and sci-fi books. I recently got done with the abolethic sovereignty novels and really loved it.

I am not religious and I am left leaning.
 
I work out semi regularly at home. Mostly calisthenics: pull ups, push ups, sit ups, ...

Some things I am looking for:
You are between 22-26 and are in the US. Preferably close to Texas.
Someone interested in getting to know each other first.

Models I have painted and bonus memes:

1jwa11c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jwa11c/love_is_so_complicated/,Love is so complicated 😭," (If she find this post I’m cooked)

I promise, the backstory is important. This is a long one so get some popcorn.

I met her 9 years ago and it was quite literally love at first sight. Like honestly I just loved everything about her - her laugh, her smile. Everything. To me she was perfect. And I was lucky because she felt the same way about me (I had no idea of course).

Every day over the course of 2 years I fell harder and harder, but she ended up moving on. We were really really close friends. One of her friends told me she liked me while she was also there, but (me being young and stupid) just laughed it off and pretended like it was nothing.

But it wasn’t nothing. I went to bed and she haunted me dreams, I just couldn’t get her out of my head. Eventually though, I think I accepted somewhat that we were just going to be friends and it wasn’t worth me perusing anything more. I never lost feeling though. They never left.

We were really close friends for the next year (year 4 of our friendship now) and then I ended up moving school. This meant we didn’t see each other much for year 4 and 5. Then she moved to my school, and that was that. She was back in my life again as if nothing had changed.

Over the next 2 years, we didn’t talk much however. She was looking to find her own place at the school and I was trying to develop as a person, learn more about myself etc..

But in the 7th year, we started travelling together and talking more. I became friends with her new friends, and we got pretty close again. 

We stayed close for a while, until now. Half way through year 9. We hit 10 years in 6 months.

I caught feeling for her all over again. And I confessed (or so I thought). I asked her to be my valentine this year, which she said yes too. I was honestly ecstatic. I couldn’t believe it. I was playing badminton that night with my best friend and I couldn’t play half the time bc my knees were shaking so bad, and he was just laughing at my (I love my bro 😭). Anyways - I sent her a little text like “it wasn’t long, but happy valentines!!” And I assumed she’d text me back like “yeah lol, glad we did this” or SOMETHING idk. 

What I didn’t expect was to be left on delivered for a week. And then I saw her in person and she didn’t even want to talk to me. Like she was just so so cold. And then I tried making conversation, she put in her headphones. We got off the underground, she walks in the opposite direction and doesn’t say goodbye (she basically ran away). And then I text her like “are we still friends? I’m sorry if I made it awkward..” and she just goes “why wouldn’t we be” like wtf?? And anyways, after that I end up deleting the text (this is now 12 day later or smth). 

But the real kicker is what happens after.

She stays cold for a bit, and then all of a sudden BAM!!

She’s asking me to play badminton with her, downloading apps I’ve been recommended, stalking my music listening, sending me song recommendations, texting me all day, asking to join me at a concert I mentioned and then going with me. 

One of the songs she recommended was a song about a person not texting back and the other person getting mad, and how the person that didn’t text back made a mistake and regrets it.

sounds like a pretty intentional choice icl..

And now she’s gone from being this super cold person to texting me back in seconds and trying to make plans.

So I asked if she wanted to get coffee with me, which she said yes to. I had a whole plan where we could walk there and I’d get her coffee and we could sit in the library (we both like going to the library to chill) and then I’d ask her to be my girlfriend and all would be well.

And then she cancelled, and rescheduled for a day later. Fair enough, something came up (her reason was very valid). 

Then, on the day we were meant to go, she says “can I bring my bsf” (also f btw). I tell her sure if she wants, and then she says “it’s fine I won’t invite her”. Not one hour later and she cancels again bc of another (fairly valid) reason.

I don’t care about the cancellation, but what I do care about is that she took time that I’d made for us, and then made it a group hangout session. Like the fact that she even asked that.

At this point I don’t even know if she likes me.. I mean she’s giving some of the most mixed signals possible. Hell, almost every time we talk she brings the conversation to like, if I’ve dated anyone before and who (never dated :(…  ) and ex’s and love or how good it would be to have a caring partner or stuff like that.

I’m kind of at the point where I just want to confess to get it off my mind, I know that’s a little selfish though. What do you people think? Hoping anyone can give me advice (I’m so close to breaking down with all of this and other stuff on my mind rn..).

Please help. Like from all of this even, do you think she like me.

Thanks, sorry for the long post..

By, we are the ppls!","*Buckle up, buttercups. This one’s a doozy.*

Today, in what can only be described as a plot twist even movie writers would reject for being *too dramatic*, former-President-turned-something-else Donald J. Trump pulled off a stunt so wild, so bananas, that people across the globe collectively dropped their toast.

Here’s what happened:

While everyone was sipping their Wednesday morning juice (coffee for the grownups), news broke that **Trump had secretly launched a new economic “deal” that broke actual international rules**. Yep, the same kind of rules countries politely agree to follow so no one ends up in a Monopoly board fight.

We’re talking about *free market economy* rules — the kind that say “Hey, let’s play fair!” But instead of playing fair, Trump went full chaos-mode and pulled what experts are calling “a surprise trade-backflip wrapped in a loophole burrito.”

The international community? Not amused.

One official said, “This is like if someone showed up to a chess match and started playing Hungry Hungry Hippos.”

Meanwhile, kids everywhere were like:  
“Wait, Trump? Again? Didn’t he have his turn already?”  
Yes. Yes he did. But like that one kid at recess who insists on being the line leader *again*, he’s baaaaack.

**In summary:**

* Trump did a thing.
* The thing broke important grown-up rules.
* The world gasped.
* Economists cried.
* Somewhere, a bald eagle shed a single tear.

We’ll keep you posted as more news rolls in. But for now, go finish your homework, hug your pets, and remember: international economics is weird, but honesty isn’t.

As a newbie, everyone welcomed me and gave me some small tips, but also warned me about certain coworkers. For some context, the workers are sorted into 3 groups: 1. tech people, 2. people who work with the media and 3. people who record interviews and live shows. Tech and media (which I am in)  people always work together,, but the third group is sometimes in contact with us.  I think it's also important to add that all of our shifts change on a weekly basis. 
Anyways, as I started meeting people in the company, everyone warned me about this one tech guy who I will be referring to as Chris. They said he's rude, arrogant, a shitty coworker who is sometimes late for his shifts, who doesn't cover for others even if they cover him etc. 
After I was done with my training and started my first official shift, I noticed my mentor crying. After asking them what happened, they told me they just had a huge fight with  Chris. After knowing that and hearing all of the bad things about him I started disliking him even if I didn't meet him yet at the time. 
A few days later I had my first shift with Chris. He was super polite, nice, joked around with me and after like 30 minutes of talking we discovered we liked the same music, movies, art styles, used to go out at the same clubs, caffees, pubs... 
For a second I was confused why everyone hated him, but I had my guard up, just to be sure. A couple of months later, every time we were working the same shift we'd have coffee of tea on our break. He seemed like a very nice guy who's funny, intelligent, eloquent, caring. Just a sweet, sweet person. He would smile very brightly when we would work together, got me coffee multiple times a day, snacks...
But during one shift me and Chris were on break and our other two coworkers (40f and 35m) sat with us and they started literally bullying him, insulting him and saying some nasty things after everything he would say. Chris's shift ended and I stayed with the other two coworkers. After he left they told me to stay away from him that he's not a good person, lies pathologically, is a huge asshole. 
My problem is that I am so calm around him, we really clicked well. I am just falling for that man more and more with every shift. 
After I commented how Chris is really nice to me and how I enjoy his company, the 2 coworkers were kind of disgusted because they though he is trying to hit on me, which I don't think is the case. The only thing I've experienced that could hinted that this is true is when we were talking about social media and I told him that I am a full-time golf while I'm not at work, because it would be very unprofessional me to have like black lipstick while working with the media and important government people, and he asked to see a pic of me. I pulled up my Instagram profile and he told me that I look older than I am plus a lot of compliments. While I was showing him my IG, he said something like ""didn't you have a pic of you in Florence?"". I did. I had a picture from Florence but I posted that on another social media platform that I never mentioned or showed anyone from work. So that was just weird, I guess. Also, when we talked about some pubs in my town, we realised that we both love one certain place and he mentioned that we could go together there if I want to. One time we also talked about how bigger age differences between couples are more accepted in our country nowadays than they were 20ish years ago.

1jw9poa,https://www.reddit.com/r/texas/comments/1jw9poa/texas_triangle/,Texas Triangle,"""...we all hate Dallas..""

""...it's a thing that the two cities hate each other...""

The first statement is true. Houston is obsessed with Dallas, while Dallas never even gives Houston a second thought.

Also, Houston only likes to talk city limits, while Dallas talks DFW. FYI, San Jose has a significantly larger population than San Francisco, but no one really cares about San Jose. San Antonio's population is larger than Dallas, but San Antonio is not seen as much of a powerhouse in Texas, though it excels in beauty and is a big tourist attraction, with lots of history.

Comparing metros, Houston's population is very diverse, but DFW is economically more diverse. Right now the price of a barrel is \~ $57. And dropping. And will drop more if we have a recession. My understanding is that the price needs to be $60 or more for the producers to thrive. Houston will say they're diverse, with medical cited ad nauseum, but the fact is that Houston lives and dies on the price of West Texas Intermediate. Not to mention that the O & G industry, which is still the lifeblood of Texas, is destined to decline going forward. More companies are moving their HQ to DFW than Houston (Austin had the most in 2021). DFW is the second-largest data center market in the United States. DFW is also emerging as a significant hub for AI research, with all the big names here.

I used Gemini's Advanced AI to find the number of $1 billion developments in progress or announced in DFW. I stopped counting at $35 billion, most of them mixed-use. The biggest chunk in Houston is infrastructure, the priciest being the I-45 expansion. Yes, DFW has lots of infrastructure plans, the biggest being a $9 billion upgrade for DFW Airport, 3rd busiest in the world by passenger traffic in 2023. Dubai displaced it, now 2nd busiest on Earth after Atlanta. In 2023, DFW Airport had more nonstop flights than any other airport in North America. Alliance in the Fort Worth area is a business hub. McKinney just announced a new airport.

The Texas Stock Exchange (TXSE) is coming to downtown Dallas, joining the The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. As of 2023, the median household income in Dallas city is $67,760 v.$62,894 in Houston city. Dallas is a city for business. And yes, H-E-B is expanding big-time in DFW. Again, AI tells me there are 11 more in development or announced, in addition to the ones already here. They're building one on LBJ in the city limits of Dallas (the first) which will be about 15 minutes away from my home.

I love to cook, so a great grocery store is important. My Central Market is Lovers Lane, about 15 mins. away, just past the flagship Whole Foods on Greenville Ave. I've never understood how DFW can have 6 Central Market locations while Houston has just one.

Dallas is known for shopping, especially luxury and high-end, if that's your thing. Spread all around the metro. I'm reading that the premiere mall in Houston, The Galleria, is declining a bit. I just saw it's becoming a ""hood mall."" Eataly Dallas in NorthPark is three floors of Italian food. The butcher shop is unbelievable. And there's produce, wine, sweets, pantry items, coffee, you name it. I went there recently after 6 p.m. on a Friday night and it was packed, a line at one of the restaurants.

It's also a fact that when retailers, USA and around the world, low- and high-end, decide to enter Texas, they almost always come to Dallas first.

As for theme parks, Dallas tops Houston. Universal Kids Resort is coming to Frisco. Six Flags is spending a fortune in upgrades and new rides. Splash Island at Hurricane Harbor, next to Six Flags, is undergoing a significant expansion. And a second deck park (after Klyde Warren Park in Uptown) is under construction near the zoo, in southern Dallas.

Houston does have the edge on dining choices, by virtue of the fact that in the metro, it's the big dog. But if we're talking Michelin, Houston dominates Dallas, but Austin has more than Houston. Where I live there's a significant restaurant scene in Richardson, featuring many restaurants and coffee houses with Asian and African menus. There's an Ethiopian coffee house about ten minutes away that I've been meaning to visit. Supposed to have great pastries. Sara's Market & Bakery in Richardson is 11 mins. away per Google Maps. Mediterranean mecca. Spotless, with store-made pita wraps. Since the clientele is mostly Muslim, they don't offer pork. Who cares, because their butchers are some of the best in DFW. PRIME beef, minutes away. Competitively priced. 

There's been idle talk about how pretty the cities are. Neither has much natural beauty at all, though Houston is greener. But in ""driving around"" terms, Dallas is definitely cleaner, more organized than Houston. And it has sidewalks. I had a buddy who lived in Houston. We went to breakfast at a well-known, homegrown chain inside the loop (ITL). Montrose area. The building was a bit run-down. The only parking was across the street in an unmarked, unsigned, unpaved vacant lot. No sidewalks, no defined spaces, just grab what you can in the dirt and gravel. Inside the loop.

He lived off Westheimer. I knew to turn when I saw a big, black building, a 24-hr XXX store. His apartment was next door to a psychic and a funeral home.

Gritty is OK for TV shows, that's it.

And we have FORT WORTH, where I was born. Cowtown is exploding. You just might run into Taylor Sheridan. He's been filming there again recently. It's population recently passed Austin, soon to be 1 million on its own. When that happens, and Austin has a million, Texas will have 5 cities with a million, more than any other state.

You want laid-back, chilled, no pretense? Head on over to Fort Worth, whose museums beat the hell out of Dallas. Check out The Kimbell and The Modern. Then go west to Goldee's Barbecue, best in the state.

Fort Worth doesn't even like Dallas. They say Fort Worth is where the west begins. (There's literally a line in-between the 2 cities where the topography changes.) And Dallas is where the East peters out.

While you're on the Fort Worth side, head on over to Possum Kingdom lake, home of cliffs and some of the clearest, cleanest water in Texas. Go horseback riding. Take a hike. Go bass fishing. Drink a frosty mug of beer. PK is just one of dozens of lakes in or near DFW.

Austin is a darling. I lived there once for a year. But it's too Wonder Bread for me. And the traffic is horrific, and I don't mean the drivers. How can you speed when you're stuck in stop-and-go? It is beautiful, but the most expensive big city in Texas to live. It's a great place to visit, but I wouldn't want to live there.",0,1744321523.0,texas,4,0.5,False

I am really curious how many calories were all doing (i know it depends on activity level, weight, age and height).

I'm 5 ft 5, 29 years old and started at 290lbs currently 281lbs. I've been yoyoing the same 20lbs since I lost the initial weight. I try to keep it at 1600cal a day but it's so hard some days. I feel like 1800 is my sweet spot but unless I'm working out hard and burning like 300+ calories then I see no change. Im focused on protein and making sure I hit my goal with that in my calorie limit. Curious to know how many calories others are doing and seeing success. I want to be a 3-4x a week gym girlie lifting weights but so far it's about 2, *maybe* 3 on a good week. On the other days I'm too busy to workout at home (need to improve on this too!). I can't believe another year has passed and even though I try so so hard not much changes. The only plus is that metformin is working to get A1C down to stable levels but no extra weight loss from that. 

Any tips on feeling full eating less? Suppressing appetite? My weak spot is having a sweet treat with my daily coffee. I tried to cut it out and then binged on cookies today. I tried making keto desserts to have with my coffee but I legit cannot just have 1 cookie and be done, I know they're there and I must devour them. Aside from this I can do okay. Any suggestions?

Moro em SP, tenho 154cm, mulher e tenho medo de pegar uma moto muito pesada (mas pelo menos faço acad kkkk) ou que não consiga dar pé, eu já estou em busca das motos pra poder sentir e até o momento consegui apenas a chopperzinha (consigo por os 2 pés inteiramente no chão) e curti muito a sensação nela, me passou segurança pelo peso e alcance do chão.

Porém encontrei as Dafra Horizon 150 e 250 (curti as duas) e fico em dúvida se elas poderiam me atender tão bem quanto a chopperzinha, no sentido de serem leves, dar pé, economia e manutenção. (acho que meu maior medo é manutenção e segurança). 

Gostaria de dicas e recomendações pra primeira moto (intruders n curti, nem estilo coffee). 

A que eu mais me apaixonei foi a Horizon 250, achei uma por 10k, 6000km rodados, 2014... A chopperzinha encontro de 8k a 12k dependendo do ano. O que fiquei em dúvida nessa 250 é que vi muitos falarem de ser injetada e isso deixar mais caro, ela não tem uma versão carburada? ou só a 150? é tão terrível assim a moto ser injetada?

He's my best friend or he used to be. But Alexandre has always had a problem, ever since I can remember, his balls are really big, you must be wondering how that is. I remember when I was in school his uniform pants would show, I don't know if that's an egg or a penis. If it's a penis, poor woman he picks up. I never really noticed, I think it's gay.

The class would make fun of him, they'd say ""look at that man with the balls"", he's really fed up with life and I could see that he felt sad, sometimes he'd skip class. Time went by and he started to lose his shyness, when we were going to have sex around here, he'd tell me, I have a technique for talking to women, every time he's going to flirt with a woman, he puts his hands on his waist, both hands and leans forward.

He says that they can't maintain eye contact for long, they look at his balls, at that big balls in his pants, and from what I can see, there are some who like it, the older women, I've seen an older woman smile brightly to talk to him.

I thought it was funny, I said that Alexandre is awesome, and yesterday I invited him to play a game here at home, my mother was in the kitchen making coffee, and we were playing, until he said he was going to go to the kitchen for a bit, he wanted to talk to my mother, my mother is a very nice person, she likes to talk.

And I saw that it was taking a long time, something wasn't right, I snuck out of the room, when I got to the kitchen I saw Alexandre with both hands on his waist and this time he was leaning forward, look, I'm not kidding, it looked like he was throwing his dick on the table, a devilish sight to see, that dick leaving marks on that poor guy's pants.

I looked at my mother and saw that she was in shock, the same reaction as seeing a ghost, I screamed right away, I said ""Alexandreeeee, get out of my house!"" and he jumped, he even stuttered when he started talking.

But he saw that he was wrong and went home, but he kept sending messages as if nothing had happened, saying he refused the coffee, right, you can't deny that, I asked my mother what he was saying to her.

She said he didn't say anything, he put his hand on his waist, she thought he was armed, with a knife or even a gun, she said she froze because she thought he was going to do something bad to her and that little by little he was leaning forward.

Neither of us made it out alive.,"So I’ve been living in Portugal for 5 years now and yeah, I’ll admit it, my Portuguese is basically nonexistent. I can order a coffee. I can say “bom dia” with confidence. That’s about it.

Now I’m applying for citizenship. And to qualify, I need a certificate from a Portuguese language class. Sounds doable, right?

But here’s how it actually goes:

• The class is **every weekday at 7AM** (a war crime, honestly).

• I work online and only speak English, usually sleep around **3–4AM**, wake up at 11.

• First rule of the class: **Camera ON. Whole time. Four hours. No exceptions.**

• Teacher? Fully Portuguese-speaking. No English. No sympathy. Just straight high-school-teacher energy.

• Me? Dead-eyed, sitting on Zoom, trying to look alive so I don’t get marked absent.



And so, in my wisdom, I brought in an AI note taker. I figured:

*“Okay, if I can’t understand her, the bot can. It’ll transcribe and translate everything. Genius.”*



NOPE.



The AI note taker joins the call, hears the teacher, and basically panics.



>“Language detected: Portuguese.”

>“Translation unavailable.”

>“Confidence level: 0.0003%”

>“User is quiet. Possibly unconscious.”



I wasn’t unconscious, I was just spiritually not present. There’s a difference.



And the bot? Useless. No translations. No help. Just vibes.



I’m holding my eyes open like I’m in a hostage video. The class is flying past me. Grammar, verbs, pronunciation drills, it’s all noise.



Then it happens.



The teacher **suddenly asks me a question**.

Simple stuff, like:



>“Quantos anos você tem?” (*How old are you?*)



Now, if you don’t speak Portuguese, that’s literally a day-one question. I should’ve had it.



But my brain was buffering.

AI note taker? Still pretending it doesn’t know Portuguese exists.



I freeze.

No answer.

Dead silence.



The teacher blinks slowly, looks directly into her webcam, and hits me with this line:



>**“Sem certificado Simu.”**

>(“No certificate Simu.”)



With **huge eyes.**

Like she just sentenced me to exile. My friends were laughing out loud. 🤣



At that point I was thinking,

I brought AI bot in for help. Instead, it sat next to me like,

>“Yeah, I have no clue either, bro.”

First, I’m really into (live) music, mostly alternative/indie, but also other kinds. What are venues/coffee places/bars to visit solo? 

Second, I also like dancing (on alternative but also electronic music), but as an outsider it’s difficult to figure out what would be a good place to go to dance alone/where it would be easy to meet people. 

Third, I would like to keep working out during my stay here. At home I go to the gym and do crossfit, but individual drop ins are quite expensive. Would there be another way to go about this and work out in SF?

## Key Features Analysis

The best keyboard covers offer a combination of durability, precision, and tactile feel to ensure optimal protection and usability.

**material Quality:** The material used in a keyboard cover determines its durability and resistance to wear. premium keyboard covers are typically made from high-grade silicone or TPU (thermoplastic polyurethane).Silicone offers excellent versatility and a soft touch, while TPU provides superior tear resistance and transparency. High-quality materials also ensure that the cover does not yellow or degrade over time, maintaining its appearance and protective properties.

A key factor in evaluating material quality is its thickness. Thicker materials generally offer better protection against spills and impacts but can also affect the tactile feel of the keys. The optimal thickness strikes a balance between protection and pleasant typing. Many high-end keyboard covers incorporate antimicrobial properties to further enhance hygiene and prevent the growth of bacteria and germs.**Precision Fit:** A precise fit is crucial for ensuring that the keyboard cover stays securely in place and does not interfere with typing. The cover should be designed to perfectly match the contours of the keyboard, with accurate cutouts for each key and function button. A loose or ill-fitting cover can shift during typing,leading to errors and frustration.

Advanced manufacturing techniques, such as laser cutting and 3D modeling, are employed to achieve a high degree of accuracy in the fit of the keyboard cover. Some manufacturers offer custom-fit options, allowing users to specify the exact model of their keyboard for a tailored fit. This level of precision ensures that the cover provides complete protection without compromising the functionality of the keyboard.

**Tactile feel:** The tactile feel of a keyboard cover considerably impacts the typing experience. A good cover should provide a comfortable and responsive feel, allowing users to type accurately and efficiently.Thinner covers tend to offer a more direct feel, while thicker covers can dampen the key presses and reduce tactile feedback.

Textured surfaces can improve grip and prevent the cover from feeling slippery. Some premium covers incorporate raised edges around the keys to enhance tactile feedback and guide finger placement. The best keyboard covers are designed to minimize any disruption to the typing experience, allowing users to maintain their typing speed and accuracy.

**Transparency and Visibility:** Transparency is an important consideration, especially for keyboards with backlit keys. A highly transparent cover allows the keyboard's backlighting to shine through clearly, ensuring that the keys remain visible in low-light conditions.Opaque or tinted covers can obscure the backlighting, making it difficult to see the keys.

High-quality TPU materials offer excellent transparency without compromising durability. Some covers incorporate additives to minimize glare and reflection, improving visibility in brightly lit environments. The level of transparency should be balanced with the cover's protective properties to ensure optimal visibility and protection.

## Core benefits

Using a keyboard cover offers tangible benefits that improve your computing experience.

**Enhanced Protection:** The most obvious benefit of a keyboard cover is the protection it offers against spills, dust, and crumbs. Accidental spills, such as coffee or juice, can cause irreparable damage to a keyboard, leading to costly replacements.A keyboard cover creates a barrier that prevents liquids from reaching the sensitive electronic components beneath the keys. This is especially valuable in environments where food and drinks are frequently consumed near computers.

Dust and debris can accumulate between the keys, affecting their responsiveness and possibly causing malfunctions. A keyboard cover keeps dust and crumbs from entering the keyboard, maintaining optimal performance. Furthermore, the cover protects the keys from wear and tear, such as fading or scratches, extending the lifespan of the keyboard.

**Improved Hygiene:** Keyboards are notorious for harboring bacteria and germs due to their frequent contact with hands. cleaning a keyboard can be a time-consuming and challenging task. A keyboard cover provides a smooth,non-porous surface that is easy to wipe clean with a disinfectant. Regular cleaning of the keyboard cover helps to prevent the spread of germs and maintain a hygienic computing environment.

Some keyboard covers incorporate antimicrobial properties to further inhibit the growth of bacteria. These covers are particularly beneficial in shared workspaces or environments where multiple users have access to the same keyboard. By reducing the risk of bacterial contamination, keyboard covers contribute to a healthier and more sanitary computing experience.

**Noise Reduction:** some keyboard covers, particularly those made from thicker materials like silicone, can dampen the sound of typing. This can be especially beneficial in quiet environments, such as libraries or shared office spaces, where excessive typing noise can be disruptive. The noise-reducing properties of a keyboard cover can create a more peaceful and productive working environment for both the user and those around them.

The degree of noise reduction depends on the thickness and material of the keyboard cover. Thicker covers generally offer greater noise dampening,but they can also affect the tactile feel of the keys. Choosing a cover with the right balance of noise reduction and tactile feedback is essential for maintaining a comfortable and efficient typing experience.

## FAQs Section

**How do I clean a keyboard cover?**
Cleaning a keyboard cover is a simple process. first, remove the cover from the keyboard. then, use a soft, damp cloth to wipe the surface of the cover, removing any dust, spills, or debris. For tougher stains or grime, you can use a mild detergent diluted in water. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the cover. Make sure the cover is completely dry before placing it back on the keyboard.

**Will a keyboard cover affect my typing speed?**
The impact of a keyboard cover on typing speed depends on the thickness and material of the cover, as well as the user's typing style. Thicker covers can dampen the tactile feedback of the keys, which may initially slow down typing speed for some users. However, many users adapt quickly to the feel of the cover and experience little to no impact on their typing speed. Choosing a cover with a thin profile and a comfortable tactile feel can help to minimize any potential reduction in typing speed.

**Are keyboard covers reusable?**
Yes, keyboard covers are designed to be reusable. They can be easily removed and reattached as needed for cleaning or replacement. high-quality keyboard covers are made from durable materials that can withstand repeated use and cleaning. With proper care, a good keyboard cover can last for many years, providing long-lasting protection for your keyboard.

I put on a bunch of weight from 2022 to the middle of last year then finally decided to do something about it. 

I went into this last year wanting to lose weight fast. I am now more subscribing to the idea that it’s going to take the time it’s going to take. 

Some bits and pieces relevant to what I’m about to share. I’m a woman, in my early 30s, five foot three. Up until about six weeks ago when I started gym my only exercise was walking. I was walking pretty much every day up until September and then it went to only on weekends - that’s when I started maintaining weight. 

I’m on about 1400 calories and aim for about 100-160g of protein a day. I also recently have started to focus on fiber intake as well. 

Part of what motivated me to join the gym was that it felt a bit safer than walking around my neighbourhood early morning. I have an exercise bike I can use but I generally don’t enjoy using it and spend the whole time watching the clock.

I will say that my primary motivator to join the gym was not necessarily directly to lose weight. I was more interested in lifting as a new hobby as I had been watching lots of Jeff Nippard etc. I probably was more focused on strength and toning than on the benefits for weight loss. 

So now that’s out of the way, here’s what I think has been working for me for my 6 week 2.2kg loss:
- strength training - this is something I’m sure most of us in this community already know and is not a point of difference. Muscle “costs more” to maintain energy wise so I’m increasing my TDEE above the levels I was at accordingly.
- I go to the gym around 5-6 times a week for strength training, so my body is moving far more frequently regardless. Even taking into account the walking from equipment to equipment, standing, etc. that’s an extra 1000 or so steps I’m doing each day. Not a lot, but more discreet movement. Standing for longer. 
- structure to my days - I thrive on structure and so this has been a self-motivating loop in that sense. My day is now sort of book ended I guess.
- I get up for gym an hour earlier than I go so I can wake up properly and have a coffee before a session. I find that if I get up and go straight to gym I’m more likely to encounter demand avoidance from myself. If I have a slow start to my day where I can watch some YouTube and have a coffee, not so much.
- another note on structure to my days, I’ve started eating basically the same breakfast and the same type of lunch each day. I don’t expend mental energy on deciding these anymore. Dinner is the only meal that’s I guess my wild card. Breakfast is generally oats and fruit, lunch is a protein and a huge serve of some frozen veggies. 
- slower dieting that is less restrictive. I can eat what I want. 
- when I have a “cheat” meal or not very calorie friendly meal I never try to compensate with my next meal. My next meal is just what it would’ve been. I don’t cut back on eating elsewhere to make up for calorie dense meals. This is a psychological thing I think.
- I have an abundance of sweets in the house - this is also a psychological thing. There’s no scarcity so I don’t really think about having sweets to be honest. Weird brain stuff lol. I have a block of chocolate in my fridge that I got 2 months ago that I’ve not even cracked the fourth row of. This took a lot of training and I will say I think a big thing is no matter what I have a sub 100 calorie ice cream at the end of the day no matter what. 
- in relation to above - there’s nothing I’m not allowed so I don’t need to have things immediately when I crave them. 
- tracking and weighing my food. The weighing of food is pretty food specific to be honest. I weigh when I’m doing meal prep so the calories are as accurate as possible. I weigh things like potato, bread, spreads, oats. I don’t generally weigh my greens. I weigh salmon, but if I’m using a packet of chicken breast in meal prep I just divide the weight on the packet by 4 and move on with my life. 
- most days I do around 10000 steps on top of any gym session.

Anyway I wanted to share because I find being in this community very motivating. Hopefully in the next 6 weeks I’ll have another cool update. ",2,1744320556.0,loseit,0,1.0,False

I’m posting this with a heavy heart and a lot of hope. Last month, my 9-month-old Dalmatian Reggie was hit by a car. It was a horrible freak accident and we’ve been living in crisis mode ever since. Reggie suffered two broken legs and lost one of his paw pads. He’s been through so much already, but he’s a fighter.

The vets have been amazing, and Reggie is slowly on the road to recovery. But we’re now looking at over **£15,000** in total costs, and our insurance only covers £4,000.

Here’s a breakdown of where the rest is going:

– **£6,000** for surgery to repair ten broken bones

– **£1,200** for the emergency care and hospital stay

– **£2,000** for dressing changes and ongoing wound care

– **£1,000** for x-rays, medication, and rehab therapy

We’ve set up a GoFundMe to try and raise the rest. If you can spare anything, even the price of a coffee, it would mean the world to us. And if you’re not in a position to give, just sharing the link would help more than you know.

Reggie is the most loving, playful pup and he’s got his whole life ahead of him. We just want to give him the chance to run again.

Thank you for reading and thank you for any help — from the bottom of our hearts. [https://gofund.me/98ae5e0a](https://gofund.me/98ae5e0a)",0,1744320461.0,KindVoice,1,0.5,False

Marea was the first property I looked at and the drive up in the property and the office/community area are truly beautiful and inviting with a great entrance. Starbucks/Dunkin Donuts just outside the complex, the pool and pool area are fantastic with a zero sloping dramatic entry into the pool and a young vibe all around the area. The walk with the associate to the apartment and common areas was impressive and the owners really put thought and money into to making the property nice and high end. The actual apartment was a bit of a strange shape, but spacious with higher end stainless quality appliances, super flooring, closeted stackable washer and dryer, a great looking surface on the large island in the kitchen, will do 9-16 month leases, amazing grill area, pickleball court, the staff were true professionals, fob entry, young people by the pool, dog walk, tons of storage space, a cool modern bathroom and balcony. The only issue would be that there are outside walkways into the apartment that I don’t prefer for the heat, elements, safety and aesthetics. When leaving the apartment complex there was another issue; in that the complex is across from a jail, transfer station, bail bondsmen shops, and after exploring the area it didn't seem like an area there would be many young professionals having drinks and partying at night and definitely no nightlife close to the apartment complex. Rating: 8+

Magnolia Square: was truly a newly built elite luxury apartment: As I drove up to Magnolia it was magnificent and elegant. I met the sales rep and he was so knowledgeable, impressive and easy going; just a GREAT guy. There is gated parking in a real high end parking garage (looked like where I’m from the Boca Raton Mizner Park parking) and not outside/exposed to the elements parking with all closed easy access/secure access with fob or your phone. There is a really amazing shopping plaza attached and around the apartment complex with restaurants and shops you could walk to. The common area was beyond amazing with a massive golf simulator, video games, pool tables, a speak-easy card room, indoor wood shuffleboard, a salt water resort type pool/lap pool, private cabanas, sauna and steam rooms, 4 story elevators all indoor up to your apartment, a incredible fitness center with spin machines, indoor pet grooming on site, car care center with vacuums and air filing, 100% smoke free community, one of the most beautiful pool areas I’ve ever seen, an art gallery, coffee/bottled water area, clubhouse with a lounge and work space area that looking quiet and inviting. The one bedroom apartment was 773 sq ft, 2 sinks in bathroom, granite countertop, walk-in pantry, huge walk in bedroom closet, , built in beverage cooler, brand new stainless appliances, full size wash and dryer, massive kitchen island, wood plank flooring. Just truly the best of the best and the top of the food chain apartment I have ever toured. The location is great as well and very close to my new office. Rating: 9+

Orchid Run: This is the sister property to Magnolia and we were there early for our tour reservation. The representative was really kind and gave me great information about the area and was very familiar with the property. Orchid is about 10 years old, but shows nicer than its age. Very pet friendly, 100% smoke free community, gated entry, massive theatre in common area, small but nice reading room, coffee bar in the same common area, alright fitness center with cardio equipment, hammocks at pool, pool was very dirty though and the shower area was rusted from neglect or age, billiard tables, valet trash service 5 days a week just outside your door, car parking outside to the elements, 1 parking space for every unit (unless you have a second signer), apartment was a bit dated and needed upgrades, older but well kept black/stainless appliances, carpet in bedroom rest of apartment was wood looking vinyl tile, nice kitchen island waiting for 2 stools, full sized washer and dryer, huge living room area with balcony, well designed apartment, just 1 sink in bathroom, 9’ ceiling. Was a nice property, but definitely needed to have a facelift as you can see the signs of age and probably the best value as it was the least expensive of all the apartments I saw today. Good location with quality food and coffee shops around the area. Rating: 7+

My partner, lets call him Barry, and I have been together nearly two years. 

We are poly and Barry had another partner when we met. At the beginning it was honeymoon phase intense. After not too long into the relationship he'd regularly dirty talk about others during sex. All fun and exciting and new to me and he would try to mesh things with me and his other partner. After a couple months things ended with his other partner 

Barry was constantly looking for others for foursomes/threesomes and I was busy working out another connection I'd made but ended up needing to call it off because she was looking for monogamy. My partner and I had our first foursome with another couple he had found. Barry then wanted to do it again within a few days and I was like ""yeah we can see if they are free."" Barry was also about to be working away for 2 months. Later on, I looked at the calendar and realised I was due to be on my period on the day we were gonna meet. Also, I get really bad mood swings and pms and needed some closeness before Barry went away. So I told Barry this. 

Barry was all nice and understanding at first. Said he wasn't there to push on my boundaries. That he also wanted closeness. I said ""yeah, this is all exciting and we can have them more regularly in future, but as it's all new and you're going away. I just wanna pace it a bit at first."" He was all good and understanding and sweet but then said he felt something had been snatched away. I mentioned this hurt and he said he was only sharing a feeling and it wasn't based in reality but from pain from previous experience.

When he was away the girl from the foursome asked if I'd like to meet them while Barry was away. I mentioned this to Barry as had no idea how I felt. I said ""I'm more than happy to wait until you're back as we were in this together."" Barry said it was ok but he might end up resenting me for not finding as many people for us to sleep with (I'd been busy with work etc) I ended up not meeting them while Barry was away anyway as timings clashed.

Barry and I went to various play parties together and I ended up being the one introducing us to multiple people and lately it's all me initiating and meeting people and he doesn't do that at all now. One of these people we've had a threesome with and went to another party with and others where things didn't work out. Barry also saying constantly how unsupported he feels. I have done hours of art work and twice spent half a day tidying his house (beyond the usual you cook I wash up 50/50 set up) and writing to do lists and suggesting things to help which are all rejected. Barry is very appreciative in the moment but keeps saying he feels unsupported still. 

I start to notice that the 100% of our 1:1 time involving talking about others is starting to make me feel a bit objectified so I mention this. Barry understanding and agrees but it doesn't really change. I end up with another partner. Whenever I so much as look at or talk about another person Barry tries to shoe horn his way in, says it's hot says he wants to be involved sexually. Sometimes before I even know if I even like the person. I told him not to do this until ive gotten to know the dynamic with a person I'm dating and I can ask them. 

While having sex Barry tried to dirty talk about someone else I'm dating and I said no I don't have their consent. Barry said of course consent is paramount but you could make something up, it doesn't have to be real what you've done. I said ""no, it doesn't feel right."" All good, all nice. But then Barry doesn't say a word later on when we go for a drive. Then later that night very sulky and says he feels self destructive and that it's like noone cares about him.

The constant dirty talk when it's just us one on one is still a bit much for me (btw Barry is welcome to date or find group sex outside of me but hasn't or finds it difficult) so I mention I need some one on one focus. Just occasionally. Even if it's only for 10% of our sex life and we still talk about others 90% of the time. As I'm starting to forget what it's like to just...be desired. Like I'm viewed as part of a puzzle piece rather than a whole person. Barry initially is nice and understanding again. In a few days time says that as I have other partners he feels shut down about it and worries group stuff is diminishing. (I literally two days before had brought someone round his house for a potential threesome. It didn't end up happening but I can't control that they had to get a train home just as things started heating up) 

I said to Barry, hey can you please use I feel statements correctly when sharing feelings? I have history of SA and maybe sensitive to feelings being put onto things when I change my mind or say no? (In fact I had asked for this back after the snatched away comment) I said that ""my request for one on one time and things that make me feel emotionally safe being framed as a loss to you is painful."" Barry was understanding and agreed and said he could see how someone using that language and timing could be manipulative. Then he said he wasn't, though. 

Then he also said: 

""I can't control how you choose to see things""

""There are two realities, yours and mine. If I accept yours, that what I'm saying is manipulative, then I'm really vulnerable here. Do you see how vulnerable I am?""

""I do SO much for you!? I make you cups of tea and coffee in the morning. I ask if it's ok to hold your hand of course I respect consent! I'm burning myself out making sure you feel safe!""

""Having to have a window for when and how to share feelings is new to me. Normally I can discuss feelings with people who understand how feelings work""

""Feelings are just data, has no one told you that?""

My nervous system has come to life. A deep pit in my stomach started to feel vaguely sick. A realisation of sorts. What do you think? 

TLDR partner has said ""I feel like some thing's been snatched away"" ""I feel like something's shut down"" or sulked when I've said no to sexual things. When I try and talk about it he says he was just sharing a feeling and can't control how I choose to see things. Worry I'm an object to him. Am I over reacting? ",0,1744319866.0,Advice,2,0.33,False

He picked up coffee and magazines from a nearby café. But when he returned home, he was shot twice at point-blank range on his own front steps.

His killer? A 27-year-old serial killer named Andrew Cunanan, who was already on the FBI’s Most Wanted list.

What makes this case especially disturbing is that Cunanan had murdered four other men in a span of just three months—each killing growing more brutal. The victims included an ex-lover, a prominent real estate tycoon, and a cemetery caretaker whose truck he stole to travel across states. By the time he reached Miami, he was hiding in plain sight—living just miles from Versace’s mansion.

Despite intense investigation, no clear motive was ever confirmed. Some claimed Cunanan and Versace had crossed paths years earlier in the San Francisco gay scene, but that connection remains murky.

Eight days after killing Versace, Cunanan died by suicide on a houseboat—only a few blocks away from the murder scene.

What do you think:
	•	Was this a targeted killing with a hidden motive?
	•	Or did Cunanan choose Versace purely because of his fame?
	•	Why did he stay in Miami for two months without being noticed?

This case still leaves a trail of questions—and shows how obsession and fame can become a deadly combination.",1,1744319625.0,u_kant19888,0,1.0,False

Experince With Dating Someone That Is Not Your ""Type?""","Hello all. My girlfriend and I have been together for only about a month now. I knew when we started dating she was not my ""type."" At first it did not bother me as she's really sweet and treats me right. Loves me for all my quirks you know the works. However, now im past the honeymoon stage, I am having second thoughts.

Our hobbies are different to say the least. She is not into video games as much as I am, she does not at all like anime unlike me, she's super OCD and picky about her food and can't stand me eating somethings, like she refuses to kiss me after I drink coffee or eat sushi, she rarely eats vegetables, lots of meat and cheese. She eats like a toddler sometimes. Overall, that just seems very picky to me and childish. Maybe because I am ovely modest or just very low matenince about a lot of things, I do not know. 

I can't stand her music we both have VERY different music tastes. She's a Sabrina Carpenter, One Direction, Cardi B, rap girl. I don't have a problem with the first two I just can't stand Cardi B or the ""hot girl"" slutty rap she listens to often, just really really irks me. I like everything musically really, but NOT that. She does not really like anything I do musically.

She really likes me and I feel bad for not liking her as much as I did earlier, she kept telling me ""oh you can dump me because of me not being your type or differing career ideas,"" etc. Her and I have talked about her not being my type before, but I feel like a hypocrit for going back on my word. I also would like to work overseas for my job and she wants to stay close to home.

Ultimetly, I want some advice on the whole matter. I do not have a lot of realtionship experince, and maybe they have just been ovely romanticized for me and they are not what I was expecting. What are your experinces with dating someone that is not your ""type"" do you regret it? Was it worth it? Not entirely sure if I am just being selfish and shallow or what.

1jw8qw3,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1jw8qw3/hr_coffee/,[HR] Coffee,"The coffee tasted strange this morning, Jacob thought.

He woke up today as he did every morning, to the sound of his alarm at 7:30. Brushed his teeth, showered, fed the cat. He made coffee—black, no sugar—and sat at the window of his small apartment reading a book. Screens are just terrible after waking up, he always said.

But the coffee tasted off today.

“Strange” he thought, and got himself dressed to go to work.

He worked at a high end accounting firm down by the old town, about 10 to 15 minutes by car. He would have preferred to walk but in this economy you take what you can.

He lived on the edge of the suburbs, a quiet cul-de-sac in a medium-sized town somewhere in the Midwest. Not big enough to feel crowded, not small enough to feel forgotten. His place was a slightly overpriced two-story rental with a white painted porch and a lawn he mowed every Sunday. The neighbor across the street, old Mr. Harrison, always gave him a little wave when he backed out of the driveway. He was a retired fireman and a veteran of the Vietnam war. A tough breed, they don’t make them like they used to. This morning, Mr. Harrison wasn’t on the porch. His rocking chair was there, though, slightly swaying. Maybe it was the breeze.

The road to work was always the same, meticulously routed to spend as little time in the car –a 98’ Toyota Paseo with always broken AC- as possible; past the school with the rusted swing set, the gas station with the broken “S” in its sign—AVER MART now. At the corner, turn right past the Methodist church on Roosevelt Str. And go past the shuttered ice cream parlor that still had the “SUMMER SPECIAL” sign taped to the window from two years ago.  Once you see the flagpole that flew the sun-faded stars and stripes flapping lazily in the still air, turn left and then smooth sailing all the way to office.

Really smooth sailing today, in particular. The town was always rather quiet but today seemed especially quiet, he barely saw cars on his 10 minute drive – it only took him 8 minutes this time. At a red light, he glanced at the car next to him. An old woman stared ahead, expressionless. She didn’t blink. Her knuckles white on the steering wheel. The light turned green. She didn’t move.

He drove on. “Who lets these old people drive?” he thought.

The office building was part of a newer strip of development—brick-and-glass facades- built from a repurposed steel manufacturing plant. A little too clean, a little too sterile, but what other use is for these old buildings here in the rust belt. He parked out back in his reserved spot a few lanes down and walked in through the glass doors.

Inside, the lobby was quiet, not unusual this early in the day. Fluorescent lights hummed overhead, the carpeted floor damp from a recent mop. There was no receptionist at the front desk,—coffee break, maybe, or cigarette break, most likely. The bowl of butterscotch candies was full. He almost took one, then didn’t.

He pressed the elevator button. It lit up with a soft ding.

He stepped out.

The office was the same: beige walls, soft carpet, distant chatter from the far conference room. Cubicles stretched in every direction like beige monuments to tedium. The hum of old computers and clicking keyboards formed a kind of dull background music that never changed. The scent of printer toner, pine scent freshener and the overbearing smell of rose cologne, Karen from accounts receivable. A bubbly old lady but she never figured that cologne needs to be discovered, not announced.

A few coworkers passed him in the hall. He nodded. One of them, an eager and young intern—her name was Clara if he remembered correctly—smiled in that half-hearted, tired way people do on Mondays. He reciprocated.

His desk was tucked in a corner under a flickering fluorescent light. He’d put in a maintenance request two weeks ago. The light still flickered.

He booted up his computer. It whirred with the slow agony of age. His monitor was one of those old blocky ones with a faint greenish tint. They were supposed to have upgraded last year, but the order got “delayed.” At least, that’s what the email had said. He’d never followed up.

He checked his inbox. The usual spam from corporate; a memo about printer toner etiquette, an invitation to this month’s birthday cake celebration in the break room — even though it was always vanilla sheet cake, and no one really liked cake anymore.

Just as he began to work through the expenses spreadsheet of the last quarter, someone stopped by his cubicle.

“Hey man,” said Tom from two rows over. Middle-aged, chubby, balding, firm handshake but always wore the same navy blue tie. “You catch the game last night?”

Jacob blinked.

Tom always asked that. Every Monday.

He smiled politely. “Nah, missed it. How’d it go?”

“Total blowout,” Tom said. “Refs were blind. Same old story.”

Jacob chuckled, and Tom slapped the edge of the cubicle wall with a grin before heading off toward the break room to loiter around the water cooler.

Jacob returned to his spreadsheet. The numbers didn’t feel quite right, but he couldn’t say why. Row C kept blinking red, even though there were no formulas in it. Probably a formatting error. He made a note to fix it later. He was really tired today and just wanted the day to fly by so he could get home, watch some TV and eat yesterday’s leftovers – pizza from the local Italian place, great stuff. Maybe he didn’t sleep well. Or maybe that coffee had gone bad and wasn’t as strong. It did taste pretty strange.

About ten minutes passed between fiddling with Excel and the thought of reheated leftovers.

“Hey man,” Tom said, his voice breaking the buzzing of the dying fluorescent light and catching Jacob off guard.

He looked up.

“You catch the game last night?”

He stared at him.

Same tone. Same posture. Same navy tie.

He hesitated. “No... like I said earlier, I missed it.”

Tom blinked. Smiled like nothing was strange at all. “Total blowout. Refs were blind. Same old story.”

He slapped the cubicle wall again. Then walked away.

Jacob stood still for a few seconds, trying to make sense of the interaction that just transpired.

The buzzing light overhead seemed louder now. The numbers on his spreadsheet had changed. He hadn’t touched them. Did he touch them? Was Excel acting up again? I swear Excel is so garbage.

God, what was in that coffee? Why was it so strange?

He stared at the flickering screen, his unkempt unshaven reflection staring back at him from the screen and its low brightness that tired the eyes. He needed to clear his head. He walked out of his cubicle and headed toward the break room for a quick trip to the water cooler. Maybe that would help with the tiredness, dehydration is a fickle thing.

The hum of the office faded as he walked down the hallway, past the open cubicles, past the photocopier whirring away in the corner. He reached the break rooms and the water cooler and grabbed a paper cup, filling it up as the cold water splashed over the edges. He took a slow drink, trying to steady his mind, but that nagging blurred feeling still lingered in the back of his head. He grabbed a handful of ice cold water and rubbed his eyes, trying to focus.

He threw away the crumpled paper cup and walked back to his cubicle. As he sat down at his chair a voice startled him.

“Hey man,” Tom said, as if nothing had changed.

“Catch the game last night?” Tom asked, the question cheerful, repetitive.

Still holding to the cubicle wall with his hand.

Still wearing that damn navy tie.

 “You already asked me that,” Jacob said.

 “What?” Tom asked, confused. “No, I didn’t. We didn’t talk about the game.”

“Are you messing with me, Tom? Is this some kind of prank?” Jacob asked.

Tom furrowed his brow, the smile fading into genuine confusion. “Prank? What are you talking about? I’m just asking about the game.”

There is now way this was happening, he was either still dreaming – which he hoped he wasn’t because that means instead of dreaming of a nice lady with an even nicer cleavage he is dreaming about Tom and his stupid navy blue tie -or they were messing with him. He had just spoken to Tom, the same question, the same conversation, perhaps the boys over at accounts receivable thought it fit to mess with old Jacob to kill time since it was a slow day.

“Are you sure you’re not pranking me?” Jacob repeated “Because I am really not in the mood”

Tom looked genuinely puzzled. “I’m not pranking you, man. I’m just asking about the ga-.”

“Look. how about we talk about the game later, ok buddy?” Jacob quipped, not letting Tom finish his sentence “I am kind of feeling unwell at the moment.”

“Alright then man, see you later” Tom said as he took his leave.

As Tom left Jacob’s line of sight he pinched himself hard in the arm just in case. He wasn’t dreaming thankfully. If this was a prank it was sure a lousy one. He melted into his chair, his fingers hovering over the keyboard.

Yet as he stared at the screen, he was again unable to focus on the work in front of him. The numbers blurred together, and the rows of data seemed to shift, rearrange themselves into shapes he couldn’t understand and coiling around his head, brain and soul, suffocating him. He felt the need to take a deep breath, and then another, and another and -

It was Tom.

“Hey, man,” Tom said, his voice friendly, almost unnervingly normal, grasping the same spot in the cubicle wall and still wearing that fucking navy blue tie.

“Catch the game last night?”

 “WHAT the FUCK do you WANT Tom!” Jacob snapped, his voice came out sharper than he intended, cracking under the pressure.

“Is this how you get your kicks? Cause I am not having a swell time right now so this whole charade can just end already. I did not watch the damn game, alright? You happy? Can we just stop with this stupid inside joke at my expense”

Tom blinked.

“Total blowout. Refs were blind. Same old story.” He said without missing a beat. He chuckled, slapped the cubicle wall and left.

Jacob was furious. He got up from his chair ready to grab Tom by that stupid navy tie and choke him till he turned purple. But as he got up from his chair a sudden bout of nausea overwhelmed him. He felt dizzy and collapsed back to his chair.

 “Catch the game last night?”

“Catch the game last night?”

“Catch the game last night?”

“Catch the game last night?”

“Catch

the game  

last

night?”

Tom’s voice echoed in his head and it felt like a ticking clock, each repetition growing louder and more unbearable, that terrible cacophony squeezing his temples.

He blinked, rubbing his eyes, but nothing seemed to sharpen. The more he tried to force his focus, the more distant everything became, his eyes blurring as if he was crying so hard so hard for so long he went blind.

What was happening? What is this nightmare?

The thought hit him suddenly, like a jolt to his chest: I’m sick. That was it, wasn’t it? He was just sick. Maybe it was the flu, or some bug he had picked up. The exhaustion, the dizziness, the weirdness of the office—it all made sense now. He’d just catch it, stay home for a couple of days, and it would all pass. He grabbed his forehead and he felt it hot, a relief washing over him.

That must have been why the coffee tasted so weird.

He picked up his briefcase and left his cubicle. He glanced around the office on his jog back to the elevator, looking out for Tom, and felt it more and more difficult to make heads or tails of the environment around him. His coworkers seemed still like corpses, or conversations seemed to lag between the sound coming out of mouths and the movement of the lips. What a nasty bug he must have caught, he thought. This is all because some people don’t know how to wash their hands after they go to the bathroom.

He walked back to the elevator, down to the reception – which was still gone- and left a note that he would be away from office on sick leave for today and he would call tomorrow to inform them when he could come back in.

He pulled out of the office parking lot, the tires screeching faintly on the cracked, gray asphalt. He mustered up all his remaining courage and strength to drive back home. It felt like that’s all he could manage, one foot in front of the other, or in this case, one turn of the wheel after another. The road was quiet, empty save for the few cars that occasionally passed him, their headlights cutting through the dim early evening light.

The heat inside him was relentless. His chest burned, a low feverish ache that was becoming harder to ignore. His fingers gripped the wheel, slick with sweat, but his mind wasn’t entirely on the road. It was hard to focus, harder still to make sense of anything. He glanced in the rearview mirror. The reflection didn’t seem quite right.

Was it mirrored? Was it  always this way? Is this why they call it mirrored?

He couldn’t place it, but his eyes lingered on his own face for a moment longer than they should have. His skin looked off, as if drooping off his face. His gaze delayed in its movements.

He blinked.

The car ahead of him swerved suddenly, a sharp movement that snapped him out of his fever induced thoughts. He jerked the wheel instinctively, narrowly avoiding hitting the car, and his heart raced, a familiar jolt of adrenaline. For a moment, his hands tightened on the wheel so hard it turned his knuckles white, but when he looked back up at the road, something was different.

The car he just avoided—no, it wasn’t a car anymore. It had changed. A shape, a blur of motion in his peripheral vision. He couldn’t make heads or tails of that shape. When he turned his head to look directly at it, it was gone. He shook his head, rubbing his eyes, trying to clear the fog in his brain.

He tried to focus on the road again, but the further he drove, the stranger everything felt. The streetlights cast unnaturally bright or dim light that warped in odd ways, bending around impossible corners.

Why was it dark? It’s still early evening and its summer. It’s as if the world itself were hesitating to continue existing.

Jacob glanced around at the world that seemed to fold in itself. Existence seemed to only continue around him and everything a few meters away from him felt like it was slowly disintegrating.

He passed by a man. He was standing still, facing the street, his posture unnervingly rigid. He was completely still, as though frozen in place. Jacob’s car slowed without him even realizing it, his eyes locked on the figure. The man didn’t blink, breathe, move. He was frozen, like a statue.

Jacob blinked, and the man wasn’t there anymore. The sidewalk was empty. These fevers hallucinations were getting really strong.

He turned his focus back to the road, his hands gripping the wheel even tighter now. The burning in his body grew, and his vision was starting to swim. The lights of the street stretched unnaturally, turning into glowing orbs that seemed to melt and drip away into the pavement.

The turn to his apartment came. The heat in his body felt unbearable now, his skin slick with sweat, his head throbbing so loud it felt like a second heartbeat in his ears. He stepped out of the car with shaky legs, his feet unsteady on the concrete.

It was blurry outside.

He stumbled to the front door and opened it. The keys missed the hook by the door and clattered to the floor. He barely noticed. He kicked off his shoes, stumbled up the stairs, peeled his shirt off halfway to the bedroom and when he made it in he collapsed on the bed.

It was dark outside.

The bed was cool. That was good. He needed cool. The fever was roaring now, and his skin felt tight. He lay on his back, sweat already soaking into the sheets. His eyes stared up at the ceiling fan, its blades turning slower than they should’ve. Or maybe his eyes were just behind.

He blinked. Once. Twice.

The ceiling looked different. No, the fan—*was* there a fan?

It didn’t matter.

There was nothing outside.

The mattress felt cold. Too cold. He grabbed his forehead. He was freezing. He tried to cover himself, but couldn’t feel the sheets anymore. Couldn’t feel the pillow either.

He squeezed his eyes shut again, tried to remember work, the car ride, anything from earlier today. But those memories were hazy. They didn’t *fit* anymore. He remembered coffee this morning, but he couldn’t remember the taste. Did he have coffee?

He sat up.

The bed was gone.

So was the room.

His mouth opened, but no sound came out. Not even breath. He put a hand to his chest. No rise, no fall. But his thoughts kept coming. Faster now. Too fast.

He shook his head.

His job, Tom, the break room, the cooler, he remembers that. Tom, Tom, who was that again?

His name. His name. What was his name, he couldn’t remember.

A memory flickered of eating a sandwich. Turkey. No. Ham. Or—?

What did a sandwich taste like?

What does anything taste like?

His hands were shaking. Or maybe they weren’t.

The white around him began to shimmer. Just barely. Like static beneath the surface. Patterns. Equations. Too fast to read.

He stepped back. Or thought he did. No weight in his legs. No legs. No floor. Only the idea of motion.

He looked at his hands. They weren’t shaking anymore. They weren’t anything anymore.

He wanted to scream, but forgot how.  
No lungs.  
No throat.  
Just the rhythm of panic, looping quietly in a mind with nothing to anchor it.

Where was the door?  
Did this place have a door?  
Did it ever?

What is this place.

It’s so dark.

He searched for a shape, a sound, a color. Found a telephone ringing. It wasn’t his. It wasn’t anywhere. The sound was just present, like it had always been ringing. What’s a telephone.

Then silence.  
Total.

No ears, no hum, not even the sound of blood.

He remembered his mother’s voice. Then forgot the word “mother.”  
Remembered wind.  
Then forgot what it moved.

A number drifted across the dark. Just one.  
3.  
It dissolved.  
Another.  
7.

He tried to count.  
The numbers slipped away.  
Each one took a piece of him with it.

He felt it now—  
Not fear, not pain—  
Just the fading warmth of thought as it drained into the cold, vast cosmos.

Some last corner of him asked: *What was before this?*  
But the question didn’t finish.  
There wasn’t time. Or language. Or memory.  
Just a flicker of consciousness in the endless void of space.  
A mathematical possibility only in theory, come true.

A blink.

And then—

No more Jacob.

Only one last coherent thought before it was snuffed out.

1jw8nvb,https://www.reddit.com/r/SciFiStories/comments/1jw8nvb/i_got_a_job_interview_with_the_government_day_01/,I got a job interview with the Government: Day 0-1,"

I was fresh out of college when I arrived home to an official looking envelope taped to the front door with my name and address on it, but no return information except a Post Office Box in Washington, D.C. I was a little scared at first, who wouldn't be to see something like that? By the time I had walked inside and hung my keys up and removed y shoes, however, my curiosity was already beginning to take over. I unsealed the piece of mail carefully and found a letter inside. It was an invitation to a job interview.

There wasn't a whole lot of information about the nature of the work, but I was definitely intrigued. There was also a packing list and instructions to meet at a small, private airport not far from where I was living. I continued working my dead end job, flipping previously frozen burger patties until the night before the date on the letter approached. I packed the pair of black pants and dress shirt carefully into a case alongside a new pair of black, steel-toed boots along with the rest of the items on the list. I left my car, taking a cab to the address I had been given.

I saw other people lined up at the small pedestrian gate where a man who looked uncomfortable in plain clothes waited, holding a clipboard. He took a quick headcount when I approached, but didn't open the gate yet. There were three more arrivals and then he finally took action. He opened the mesh barrier and stepped outside.

“When I call your name step forward.” he bellowed.

We all did as instructed, and the man checked our licenses against the information on his paper, handing our cards back afterward.

“Alright, everyone, follow me.” he called out again. He had the tone of a Drill Sergeant. His pace, and the way he carried himself matched as well.

He led us into a hangar and then took our bags, having each of us fill out a tag to wrap around the handle. He loaded the luggage while we filed up the stairs and onto the small aircraft, each of us finding a seat. The man boarded and retracted the staircase and then closed the door behind him, he turned to us and handed out safety cards, but said nothing. Moments later he was strapped into the seat next to the door, and pressed the intercom button.

“We're ready to go.” he said.

The plane's engines started up and we started moving onto the tarmac. We took off a few minutes later, and I yawned as my ears popped shortly after that. The flight wasn't very long, and I was surprised to find us in the middle of a blazing hot desert. From the landing strip, we were bused into a small town and directed into the lobby of a hotel where we each had a room reserved in our name. The place was nicer than anything I could have afforded, even had a bar and restaurant attached to the building.

I made my way there after dropping my luggage in the room and cleaning up a little bit. I wasn't the only one who settled at the counter. I recognized a few faces from the plane and bus ride. I approached one of the strangers after I got my drink.

“Is anyone sitting here?” I asked, motioning toward the stool next to the man, who looked to be just a little older than me.

“Nope.” he replied, picking up a glass of dark beer, taking a sip from it.

“Do you have any idea why we are here?” I pressed, hoping that the other man would know something that I didn't.

“I got the same letter you did, I think.” he answered plainly.

I realized he wasn't that interested in talking to me and quietly went to a table, where I sat alone until I needed another drink. Once I got a decent buzz, I returned to the room rented in my name and surfed the channels on the television until I passed out. The next morning, the phone beside the bed rang, rousing me from my sleep. When I answered, the man at the front desk informed me that the shuttle would be arriving in a half an hour. I took a fast shower and shaved, then dressed in the black clothing and boots as the letter had instructed.

I joined the others outside the lobby, and moments later, the bus from the day before pulled into the loading area. We all settled into the first open seat we came to, and as soon as the last passenger sat down, the driver closed the doors and started the engine. The ride from the hotel took a couple of hours through the blank, dry desert. We pulled off of the main road and onto a narrow dirt track, our bodies bouncing a bit as we went over dips and bumps. We stopped at a large gate. The fence around the place was tall and topped with concertina wire.

The man who emerged from the guard shack was wearing a military uniform, and checked the driver's identification card before entering the building and doing whatever he needed to do to open the way for us. There were squat buildings a little bit past the fence, and as we continued forward, I could see larger structures and even a paved road. It was that cluster of structures that proved to be our destination, where a pair of men wearing suits stood in the sweltering sun. To my surprise, they didn't seem to be sweating as I approached them.

Once everyone had gotten off of the bus and formed a line, we were escorted inside where even more suit-clad men and women waited. One of them finally spoke up.

“I'm sure you're all curious as to what exactly you are doing here. First of all, let me introduce myself as General Richard Kemp. I wanted to be the first to congratulate you on your selection for this new and exciting project.” an older man in the dark blue suit said.

“What *is* the project?” one of my fellow passengers interjected.

“I'm not exactly qualified to answer that, but I can promise that by the end of the day, you will understand our purpose here.” the Officer replied.

We were split into smaller groups, arranged seemingly at random, and my cluster of people were led into one of the other buildings. This one looked like a warehouse on the inside. The floorspace was dominated by large metal shelves which held large plastic cases.

“What's all this?” the same person who had questioned the general asked our stone-faced escort.

“Some of it is replacement parts, other bits have already been upgraded, and are just waiting to be de-commissioned and repurposed.” he told us.

We followed him to the back wall where a rather large office space had been built, each of us taking a seat at a long table. The man didn't say much else, instead, he drew our attention to a television on a rolling stand, which was connected to a device I had never seen in person before, which was a VCR. The man pressed some buttons, and a moment later he started a video. The scene that we saw was impossible. It was New York at some point after World War Two, but something was off about the footage.

Red banners with white circles and familiar, black symbols in the center of them hung from the buildings. The man being driven down the middle of the street in the convertible was also familiar, and even if I hadn't known his name, I would have recognized his hairstyle and the small, distinct mustache above his lip.

“What the hell is this?” one of the other people in the room, a mousy looking woman with cat's-eye glasses and short hair spoke up, her voice quivering with emotion.

“This is what we are here to discuss.” a voice on the other side of the room replied. All of our heads turned toward the woman. I hadn't heard her come in, and I don't think anyone else had either.

“Things like this and others have been averted by the work we have been doing here, and our division has recently gotten funding to expand, which is why we reached out to you, and the others that were brought here today. You are among the tops of your respective classes and fields, and that is the kind of talent we are looking for.” the woman said, making her way to stand by the screen.

“My name is Christine Delson. I am one of the administrators here at Project Wheatley.” she introduced herself after a long moment of silence.

We were shown more footage, and given a long speech about the timeline, most of which went over my head. I was never a good physics student. My talents lie elsewhere, and for a moment, I began to question why I had been tapped to be a part of the project. We sat through a couple of more videos of things that never happened. The Titanic making a successful journey was one, Lee Harvey Oswald being stopped before JFK's assassination, another. We were given a bunch of paperwork to sign, mostly saying we wouldn't discuss what we had seen that day while under contract.

We were then herded through another door which took us outside, following the woman to another large building. Mrs. Delson hesitated at the door, turning to address us once again.

“What you are about to see is extremely sensitive, classified information.” she said, then turned and entered a six digit code on the keypad.

There was a click and she pulled the door open. We stepped into what appeared to be an empty warehouse, the only thing inside a lift, the wire cage around it painted a bright yellow. She opened the gate and motioned for us to step onto the platform, and so we did. When she joined us, she entered another code before the thing began to move, nearly silently lowering us into the concrete shaft. The descent was almost uncomfortably long, but eventually we stopped. The walls in the hallway were tiled, as was the floor.

“Stay close, it's easy to get lost down here.” the woman told us as she opened the gate and stepped forward.

I heeded her advice, as did the other people in the group, staying practically on her heels as she led us through a series of twists and turns before finally approaching a large set of rolling double doors. Those began to open automatically as we drew closer, revealing the room behind. A rush of cool, dry air slammed into us, and that was just the beginning of the surprises. The large, underground room looked like something out of a big budget Hollywood movie. There were rows of large computers, and monitors mounted above these, each one showing a different string of data.

“This room is where we probe for and discover aberrant events in the timeline.” she proclaimed with pride in her voice, making a grand gesture around the space.

My eyes followed her hands, scanning the people and equipment in the room, until I saw something that piqued my interest. I didn't even realize that I was moving, until I was close enough to the mechanical exoskeleton to touch it. I had to restrain myself from doing just that.

“Beautiful, isn't he?” a deep, male voice came from behind me, causing me to jump a little bit.

I turned to see a tall man with a smile on his face.

“Sorry, yes, it's gorgeous.” I stammered.

“Unfortunately, we are having some problems with the pilot interface.” he told me.

“What's the problem?” I asked.

“Do you work here?” the man countered.

“Not yet...” I confessed, feeling the heat creep up from my collar into my face.

“Oh, you're one of Mrs. Delson's recruits. She won't be happy that you wandered off. I think they are in the other room now.” he chided me, and then led the way to the appropriate doorway, scanning a card to allow me access.

I found the group and caught up just as she was explaining exactly how they rectified the things that shouldn't have happened, but once again, my brain checked out, instead marveling over the machine I had seen moments before. The next part of the tour was more up my alley, however. There were mechanical suits in various states of fabrication and calibration. The things she said here connected with me in a way her other speeches hadn't and I was excited at the prospect of working at the place after we headed back to the office.

We were once again separated and interviewed one by one before being dismissed to sit on the bus and wait for the others. There were already a few people sitting in the seats when I boarded. A few of them were talking quietly, but it was hardly audible from where I chose to sit. Eventually we were driven back to the hotel where the man we had met at the airport waited for us outside of the lobby. Some of us, myself included, were given small yellow envelopes, while the others were sent to their rooms empty handed.

“Don't open those until you are back home.” the man said, before turning and walking away without any further explanation or instruction.

I went back to my room long enough to tuck the small parcel into my suitcase and change into less formal, dark clothing. I returned to the bar that night, ordering food before I spent some time getting a little more than buzzed. I paid for that as I had a violent headache and my stomach rejected everything that even remotely resembled food or even coffee. The ride back to the airport and the flight itself didn't help matters and I got sick on the tarmac before I could get into the cab that carried me the rest of the way home.

I didn't open the envelope until the next day. Inside was an identification badge with a magnetic strip on the back, along with instructions of what to pack, and what time and day to return to the small airport. I quit my dead end job, and began cleaning out my refrigerator and pantry, as well as the cupboards. I sold my furniture except for my bed, and when the day came, I moved that to the curb, putting a 'Free' sign on it.

I boarded the plane along with a few other familiar faces, optimistic about the future.",1,1744318808.0,SciFiStories,0,1.0,False

When I try to buy green tea at non-Asian stores, it sometimes gets confusing.

1jw8llz,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1jw8llz/difficulties_in_conversation_with_my_autistic/,Difficulties in conversation with my autistic partner,"Hello! :)

  
My partner and I really love each other deeply. But one issue—at least for me—in our relationship is how we have conversations. We're in a long-distance relationship and only see each other on every weekend because my studies and her apprenticeship don't allow us to move in together without one of us having to commute for hours. So during the week, we talk on the phone and share how our day was and what's new. And that's where the problem lies.

This doesn't always happen, but it does often—and it also depends on her mood. She has autism and borderline personality disorder.

A specific example:  
Today I spontaneously went to get a piercing with my two best friends from university. I'm super happy with the result and of course, I wanted to tell my partner about it afterward.  
If I said to someone else, ""I got a piercing,"" they’d probably respond with something like, ""Oh cool, where? I didn’t know you were planning that! Did it hurt?"" or maybe  something jokingly, like, ""You idiot, gave in to one of your impulses again?"" And from there, the conversation would naturally continue and go in some direction.

But when I tell her something like that, she just says, ""Oh cool,"" like it’s totally insignificant (even though she doesn’t *mean* it that way)—and then says nothing else.  
What am I supposed to say to that? I have to carry the conversation myself and come up with something else to elaborate on. But it feels like I'm talking to a wall that just gives a signal that it's listening.

So then I tell her a bit about how we decided to do it and that I got a helix piercing. And of course, I only mention the basics, expecting that the conversation will evolve naturally and we’ll dive deeper into the details and events. After all, I’m talking *with* someone—I don’t want to be giving a monologue.

Then I asked her, “Aren’t you curious what the others got pierced?” and she said, “Of course I am.” So I told her what they got, and then she said, “Ah, okay,” and again—silence. No “Did it look good on them?” or any comment connected to that.  
That makes it really hard for me to keep the conversation going.

Of course, I’ve brought this up with her before. But then, she just forces herself to ask questions. Like she’ll go, “Which piercer did you go to?” and I’ll say which one, and then she’ll ask, “What did you do afterward?” again without responding to what I said.

That was just one example of how it *sometimes* is. And I want to make it very clear that it's not always like that. Many conversations are absolutely wonderful—we talk for hours, share everything, start on one topic and end up somewhere completely different, go on tangents, interrupt each other, have discussions and differing opinions - all the things that make conversations fun and engaging.

But when it’s not like that—and I have the need to share my thoughts because it was an awesome day—then I get stuck, and that really weighs on me.  
There’s so much I haven’t even told her because it didn’t come up naturally.  
She doesn’t even know which ear I got the helix in, or that while we were eating ice cream in front of a café afterwards, there was a baby staring at us curiously and one of my friends gave it a sticker sheet—because she’s writing a poetry book for her boyfriend and puts a sticker after every poem.  
Or that we teased our other friend for half an hour because she says ""Kafää"" instead of ""Kaffee"" coffee (and the other one says ""Karooootn"" instead of ""Karottn"" carrot). - (we are Austrian with slightly different dialects)  
Sure, I *could* have said all those things how they happened from start to finish—but then it wouldn't have been a conversation, just me reading a letter out loud.

This really gets to me sometimes. It’s exhausting and demotivating. Even though the other half of our conversations are amazing and full of variety—*this* part is missing.  
And it’s not like she’s not interested in what I have to say.

Other than that, our relationship is really great.  
We do so many things together on our weekends—go to concerts, to subculture group meetings, go hiking, swimming, shopping, on random road trips, or out to eat.  
Cuddling and kissing her, giving each other back massages—that’s the most wonderful thing I can imagine. She’s incredibly talented in giving comfort , always knows what to say when I’m down, she’s creative, can draw and write poetry beautifully, and she’s absolutely gorgeous.  
And our love is healthy and mutual—we’re very considerate of each other, trust in each other and often give each other small gifts just because (she’s actually better at that than I am :D).

So why am I writing all this?  
First, to get it off my chest. Of course, I’ve talked to friends too, but I’m not a very articulate person and often can’t express things the way they sound in my head—especially when it comes to emotions and wishes. And that really frustrates me because expressing and discussing emotions openly is really important to me.

Second, because I need advice.  
Are there ways to make these kinds of conversations smoother?  
What can I do? What can she do?  
Can you relate to this problem? Do you know this kind of situation?  
Please tell me everything and ask as many questions as you want!  
Do you have any book suggestions or websites I can check out to learn more about this topic?

Our relationship is really important to me, and I want it to strengthen and improve. :)  
I’m so thankful to everyone who reads this and leaves a comment—even if it’s just a small remark or not directly related to what I’ve said.  
I want to talk about this. <3",1,1744318648.0,autism,1,1.0,False

35 male from San Jose, Seperated looking to start dating again. Have kids, but not full time. Looking for a normal mature woman for a little physical and emotional connection.

I’m educated and work in a field with majority males ( don’t worry, not a tech bro) so I don’t interface women often. I’m 5’8, full head of hair and told that I’m handsome often. I’m weight and height proportional, muscular but not a total gym rat. Don’t have a body type but do require weight and height proportionate, slightly chubby is fine. I am a sucker for super pretty faces. Any height is fine including taller.

I’m a nerdy gear head that loves machines as well as food and coffee. I’m a man’s man but very emotionally intelligent. I also love to be in the kitchen, whether it’s cooking or baking. Also coffee, I love coffee and matcha. 


Hoping to take it slow and swap pics, and if there’s a connection, meet for coffee. 

Let me know more about you!

Twilly: Le Charme D Orphee


I was invited as a guest of a friend. Overall it was a fun day and nice to get some items at a really great discount.  I am a guy, who isn’t really into too much fashion. I really like Hermes items that are whimsical and fun. The colors on the silk are gorgeous too.  The silks are the only thing I’ve bought from Hermes so far.  We saw sooo many people with the white bags. It was like a parade. We just followed it in reverse to get to the event. 

We got there about an hour before our start time which I thought was perfect. Once the 30 minute mark hit there were so many people lined up. Not that it truly mattered as they did let the whole group in.  It was very organized and it was easy checking my bag and jacket. 

We were able to watch the group before us finish up shopping. It’s fun to see everyone with the bags just PACKED full of orange boxes, clothing , silks ect. The security staff did have to be a little stern with some people who were trying to go back and shop after their group time was over.  

First half was all the men’s RTW, all the woman rushed passed to get to the shoes! Like I mentioned, I am not much into fashion. I also dislike shopping. I can look at a rack of clothes and know nothing is of interest.  Later in the day, as my friend was trying on shoes, a woman asked if I could try on some clothes to see if they would fit her husband.  It was a sweatshirt, and a denim jacket.  (I am ready for the hate with this upcoming hot take) IMO, they felt uncomfortable and stiff and I would find something better at another store. I am also a little biased as I do make some of my own clothing.  I, personally, cannot justify the price of some of the RTW ! 🤷🏻‍♂️

My next section I looked at was the ties. The gentlemen working there was so sweet and very helpful. I ended up selecting this really fun tie with ghosts on it. I normally don’t wear yellow, but I liked the different color. And it seems I was in a yellow silk mood as I also picked this twilly.  My ghost tie is going to be so cute next to my dragon tie ! 

I also overpassed the shoes. I love to garden and my favorite shoes are my Crocs (💀💀💀💀). They are waterproof and I don’t need to worry about them getting dirty. I literally wear my crocs whenever I go into Hermes. It’s great.  I also wish they added more fun colors to the mens shoe line. The woman’s leather sandals have such gorgeous colors. Give us men some color love. We all don’t want to wear gray/blue/brown. 

The staff were really great. From the gentleman in the ties, and the woman who was working at the bag charms. She complemented my “me-made” shirt.  I even gave her the pattern # for her to sew herself. 

The event was so well organized and orderly. The view from the checkout line was gorgeous. It’s a shame all the staff couldn’t enjoy it. Their backs were to it as they needed to ring people up all day. I just wish we got boxes with our silk items as I use the boxes when I wear my pieces out. I just put them away when I’m done before I spill coffee on it :) 

TLDR; First sale, male customer. Overall good time. Not interested in RTW but enjoy the silks.",21,1744318533.0,TheHermesGame,4,1.0,False

 I asked a girl to hang out after she said she was seeing someone a year ago so I tried to reconnect according to friendly advice. And said girl was barely responsive on Instagram after I asked her out, got her number, hoping that it was an excuse for how much she sucks at texting on Instagram but it's different on WhatsApp, (hint it wasn't)

My friend told me the girl likes to be courted with fancy gifts and flowers and my ice cream date approach was low effort (granted I bumped into the girl aka Jodie for the sake of this story, buying Ice cream and I thought it'd be a cute way to ask) and I told my friend that doing all that is something I can absolutely do ONLY if there's a certain degree of interest on the other end reciprocated i.e trying to get to know each other or even better friendly. But I barely get replies, feeling like I'm begging for attention or even just being friendly. But anyway will ask the women, do a good number of you like to be courted and wooed with flowers from guys who you barely know in order to get attention or do you start low-key before the big stuff comes in?

But for me personally I just said I don't mind doing the courting but if the person isn't interested in even an ice breaker date like coffee or lunch or ice cream, no 5 start Michelin restaurant super date will make them notice you or want to be close. So that's my gut telling me this Jodie girl is probably not someone I should try to connect with because she just doesn't seem interested in me at all and I feel like I'm doing all the heavy lifting.",1,1744318359.0,dating,8,0.67,False

A genuine connection. I’m not chasing labels or rushing into anything just open to something built on trust, depth, and presence. If it turns into a relationship, great. If it becomes a meaningful friendship, that’s just as valuable.

A bit about me:

By day, I’m a coder. I also have a master’s degree in nuclear physics and I’m preparing for my PhD which means lots of studying and a few late-night brain farts (GRE & TOEFL). Life can be intense, but I balance it with calm moments and simple joys.

I love long conversations over coffee, night walks, and getting lost in the quiet parts of a city. I prefer the hidden alleys where the real stories live.

One day, I will ride a motorcycle across Europe. The back seat’s open. maybe you’re the right kind of adventure?

Still planning my first tattoo, but first, I’m working on getting in shape. Got any ideas or cool ink stories? I’m all ears.

What I’m looking for:

Emotional maturity. Calm, kind energy. A connection where we can be real, not perform. I’m not into surface-level stuff. Just looking for someone who enjoys depth, curiosity, and the kind of quiet that doesn’t need to be filled.

Sipping my coffee and looking through deep space telemetry. I came to an outstanding conclusion while flipping through those dense stacks of graphs. I knew when I approached what I know now and yet, as if in defiance or maybe delusion, I expected my actions to overturn the reality of the situation. I traced the colored lines with my eyes, nodding slowly as I sip deep from my steaming mug. The truth is, I don’t understand any of it. 

As it has always been, science is for minds bold enough to grapple with confusion and come out better for it. In that moment however, I seemed to recognize bewilderment, acknowledging it with indifference as I receded into my subconscious, dreaming of what the patterns might have meant. I’ll leave the space charts to the Buff Scientists and stick to reporting, stick to the facts. 

The fact of the matter is we have the best of the best working in their respective fields. That being said, the IT Department would like me to remind everyone to use non-networked and firewalled computers when investigating suspicious links.

There have been sightings of a sasquatch on floor 15, complete with blurry photographs and mass hysteria. This reporter decided to get to the bottom of these claims. In my efforts I located the source of this internal mystery. Join me next week as I interview Henry, our reclusive accountant, who says “I’m just tired of being photographed every time I use the copier.” 

In an effort to prove the existence of Mole Men and other subterranean cryptids, the Investigators have uncovered a massive underground network of geothermal chambers. Though these spelunking grounds are ripe with possibility, some have already lost contact with HQ and likely won’t return for a while, if at all. I recommend utilizing the buddy system in any attempt to locate an entrance to the hollow earth in these caves. 

In light of recent outcry, the powers that be have seen fit to introduce new faculties to support those who, in the past, have felt less than considered. These improvements are said to include: A garlic free dining area, improved moonlight containment infrastructure, and 12 ft doorways, among many others. These integrated solutions require policy-level approval and will take time to actualize.

First post here. I’ve really enjoyed this community so far. Thank you all so much for your thoughtfulness.

I often obsess about my coffee intake (has to do with my own associations to autonomy and dependency), and I’m wondering if anyone else thinks critically about this.

I know coffee is going to be a part of my day (likely everyday), and I’m likely to drink more coffee when I see more clients (I generally see 20-25 per week). I work one late day and teach one night class for a total of two late days. This generally means that for those days I have at least one cup of coffee well past noon. 

I try to ritualize my coffee intake- especially in the morning with a fresh grind. I also try to take walks to coffee shops in order to get some exercise with a midday cup. On average, I have 3 cups per day. 

I also have a child under two, and my wife also works full time, so I try to remind myself that it’s okay and reasonable to be tired. For the same reason, I try not to beat myself up if I compulsively reach for an extra cup. 

The self-soothing ritualized idea around the coffee has helped me obsess less about the  intake overall. Still, I realize the physiological effects are real, and of course sleep can be affected.

Does anyone else think a lot about coffee? I do also try to be curious about my energy level around counter transference with patients (I.e. it’s reasonable that some clients are inherently energizing vs. fatiguing).

You can make it taste different by changing the fruits. You can make it more fatty by adding more chocolate or pecans. You can make it have more protein by adding more protein powder or by adding more yogurt. It's very forgiving also, in the sense that you can play with it to make it fit to your taste and budget.

I usually make this for dinner every night. So to make it more filling I add coffee and as much sugar free jelly I want. All in all, you can have a VERY filling meal for less than 500 calories that is VERY high in protein and as LOW in carbs as you want. You just have to play with it.

Last year, their travel agent steered them to a luxury culinary experience, mostly Michelin rated restaurants, which is \*decidedly\* not their thing. So my husband and I have been tasked with food research and planning this time around. Grateful for the opportunity--and don't want to fumble and ruin my good reputation LOL.Looking for your experienced thoughts on my tentative plan. I'll do separate posts for each trip leg, with brief activity notes for context. Looking for authentic, reliable, and delicious meals. Nothing touristy (popular is fine, if quality hasn't suffered, but we are not on the Instragram circuit); locals spots always a bonus. Note: They love Italian food but are not adventurous (or even, really, curious) eaters. ANY feedback, suggestions, alternates, etc welcome! Thanks in advance!

* *have a strong list of street food by neighborhood*
* *assume gelato/tiramisu throughout as appetite allows*
* *open to a Roscioli sub anywhere if I could get a non-cellar res*
* *mid-30s to mid-60s, fit/active*



Day 1:

early morning arrival from Atlanta - drop bags at St. Regis (Castro Pretorio area)

coffee and pastries for survival

stroll and eat street food until room ready or earliest lunch res at Da Gino al Parlamento (or similar classic place)

settle in and try not to nap

walk for early dinner at Ai Tre Scalini (continuous service hours, so we can eat very early evening and then crash)

if they think we feel up to it, a welcome-to-Rome sunset ""nightcap"" at The Court Palazzo Manfredi (would need res, so may be dicey with jetlag)



Day 2:

breakfast at hotel

9:15-12:15 Vatican tour

lunch near Vatican (Hosteria Dino & Tony or *Osteria Nuvolari* Via Ombrello or *Bonci* Pizzarium--too crowded by 12:30?) OR 12:30 at Armando al Pantheon (have the res but will be a wild sprint to make it in time)

hotel rest and reset

shopping stroll then aperitivo and dinner in Trastevere (at Checco er Caretterie or Enotecca Ferrara)



Day 3:

pastry and coffee breakfast--can be anywhere--or a rooftop breakfast (e.g. Terrazza Les Etoiles, Hotel Dianna Roof Garden)

Big Bus Hop On/Hop Off 24 hour pass - no tours or specific plans as of yet (will almost certainly do something - Borghese, Colosseum... open to your opinion of one great thing--doesn't have to even be one of the big landmarks, as no one is big history buff and I am only art buff)

street food snacking all day (""lunch"")

late afternoon hotel reset

early evening Via Condotti/ Via del Courso windowshopping stroll

aperitivo - place TBD

dinner at Da Francesco (have res) or Armando al Pantheon (have res)



Day 4:

breakfast at hotel or pastry + coffee breakfast nearby

check out for 12:25 train to Florence

# ALT-ƎRNCORE:  The Almost Album

A retrospective look at what might have originally been on tap from the controversial rapper, Eminem, before the infamous 2003 leaks. 

   As most long-time fans of Eminem do from time to time, I found myself thinking about the disappointment that was *Encore* the other day. Coming on the heels of the Big Three, and with the pre-eminent rapper, Marshall Mathers, at the top of the rap game, *Encore’s* shockingly scattershot and seemingly uninspired track list left many fans at the time in a shocked state of disbelief. As a long-time fan of Em’s since he first broke on to the scene with 1998’s *The Slim Shady EP*, I can attest to the dejected state of the fanbase upon the album’s release in November of 2004. It was a dismal time for fans, to be sure. The final product was on a level so clearly beneath his previous offerings that it had many at the time expressing their disappointment on rap message boards, some literally believing that the release was a fake, a troll; the level of denial was so deep, some thought that the real follow-up to *The Eminem Show* was still to be released in the weeks that followed … but as the weeks passed, it became more and more apparent that what we were left with was Eminem’s first dud, leaving fans to wonder just how this could have happened.

The infamous leak, which happened in December 2003, eleven months prior to the release of *Encore*, was massive news at the time, and was no doubt an even bigger drain on Eminem’s creative process. Long before the dawn of social media, word of the leak trickled out to the fans only through interviews and wild rumours that spread online. It’s no doubt difficult for his younger fans to appreciate the depth of the impact of this leak; at the time, Em was the biggest artist in the world, at the very peak of his fame, and his rabid fanbase were foaming at the mouth to hear what the creative genius would offer up next. But then the leak happened…and whatever Em had been cooking up was dashed, leaving the embattled artist scrambling to cobble together something to release in its place. Eminem said of the experience years later:  ""Five or six songs leaked from the original version of *Encore.* So I had to go in and make new songs to replace them. In my head I was pissed off: ’Oh well. Songs leaked. Fuck it. I’m just going to take a bunch of fucking pills and go in there and have a party with myself.’ I’m sure the more pills I took, the goofier I got.” It’s clear from his words here that whatever vision he initially had was lost; Em was prepared to phone the rest in, and call it a day. And that’s exactly what happened.

Even though half the album remains peak Em in fine form, one can’t help but wonder what might have been if all those painfully mediocre tracks hadn’t been plopped in the middle. What might we have heard instead had the those leaks never happened? While it's always interesting to consider how the three bonus tracks later released as part of a supposed “Deluxe edition” could improve the seemingly uninspired album, the track lists fans usually put forth are often about the same; sub those three in for your least favourite of the cornier tracks (Big Weenie, Rain Man, My 1st Single, Puke, Ass Like That) and there’s no denying you’ve got a much better listening experience.  Some like to discredit this notion, insisting Em wanted to give us all of the lack-lustre tracks that plagued this offering, or that these songs weren’t intended as part of the main course, but I don’t believe that, nor does history really support the notion. Regardless, this has been done to death, and it is more interesting to consider what kind of album Em had originally envisioned before any of the leaks had occurred.

This essay is a look at what might have been, which I explore through an in-depth lyrical analysis of his creative output in 2003-2004; the leaked tracks, songs released on *Encore*, as well as the Invasion mixtapes which seemed to be dropping every other month in the wake of *8 Mile*, and which offer clues to Em’s mindset and possible creative direction. So, when Em took to the studio to begin recording his fourth major-label studio album, he had a mighty task ahead of him: when you’ve just put out three acclaimed albums, a holy trinity of sorts, and are currently enjoying the view from the top of the rap game, just what do you do for an encore?

**Ǝ**

First of all, and most importantly, if we take a closer look at some of this work’s predominant themes and  his other lyrical content during this era, it seems very improbable that his original vision for *Encore* included any of the anti-beefing sentiments expressed in *Like Toy Soldiers*, as the leaked tracks show that Em was still in a very combative state of mind. I think people have it backwards when they suggest *Like Toy Soldiers’* presence on the track list meant that the diss tracks would not have been included on the album. The content of the leaked tracks suggest he was more than willing, if not eager, to bring the 2002/2003 beefs with Benzino and Murder Inc to the masses on his first studio album since The Eminem Show. It is the opinion of this writer that LTS was actually an artistic afterthought brought on by the 2003 leaks that irrevocably altered *Encore* forever. Make no mistake, *Like Toy Soldiers* is a good song, a mature take on the very real dangers of beefing and surely one of the highs on the *Encore* we got. But again, this speculative essay is about the album Marshall Mathers was originally inspired to make… which was a very different beast.

While Em may not have planned to pick any new fights per se, *Encore* was surely going to be his cockiest album to date, with more than its fair share of braggadocios bars, and plenty of egging on of rivals in the rap game to challenge his skill and dominance, and that of his label, as it would be the first album where he could showcase his new label mates. I think he was still riding the high of those 2003 beefs and felt very much at home having fallen back into something like ‘battle rapper mode,’ his old comfort zone\*\*.\*\* This after putting out three highly acclaimed album that had already cemented his legacy as a rapper and lyricist of the highest order; also Em was still riding the wave of superstardom that *8 Mile* had brought him. I believe when a 2017 Eminem recalls on “Walk on Water” a point in his career where he had the world by the balls, licking out his palm - this was surely that moment. Em was brimming with confidence in those days. I remember when those Invasion mixtapes were dropping, Shady Records was at it’s absolute peak and literally everything Em touched was dope as fuck: (*“I got 50 Cent, I got G-Unit, D-Twizzy in this bitch, with Obie Trice, so watch what you say ‘fore you call our name, cuz you say one more thing, it wont be nice!!*”) Those truly were the days to be an Em fan. (*“Bring Daddy his Oscar…we’re gonna shove it up Ja Rule’s ass!”*) He was on top with the much anticipated follow-up to *The Eminem Show* finally on the way, and fans couldn’t wait to hear what he would have to say next. I think it’s honestly difficult for some fans, who came to Em later in his career, to truly appreciate just how huge he was at this exact moment in time - which is a big part of why the *Encore* he delivered was such a disappointment to many. However, getting back to Em’s headspace when he began these recording sessions, it’s clear he intended to deliver a very different album that the scattershot and goofy one we got.

The leaked *Monkey See Monkey Do,* awesome though it may be, unfortunately sounds like it was intended only as a promo track, one he likely planned to drop in the months leading up to the album release, but it gives a vivid peek in to his headspace at the time, and it was like nothing Eminem fans had ever heard before. I always loved this track, particularly where he mentions his wish for someone like Nas or Jay-Z to come at him so he can dust off his chainsaw (*“and give 'em the surgery that he came for”*). Of course, the song goes on to say that he's got a list (*“that just ain’t Ja”*) that he’s going to read off come April, and that he’ll be shooting more than just paint balls (trust me!), a reference to fictional scenes in *8 Mile*, and frankly, one of the more intriguing lines of his career.The leak also unveiled both *We As Americans* and *Love You More*, two high quality tracks that would have clearly made the final cut and likely would have been centrepieces on the album (more on these later). On *Bully* and *Can-I-Bitch*, we get another hint on the type of content Em might have wanted on the album. On the former, he addresses the beefs with Ja Rule and Benzino just as he did in *Like Toy Soldiers,* but the tone is not so conciliatory and his verbiage is notably *not* in the past tense, as it was on LTS. It’s very clear that on *Bully*, Em is still firmly in beef mode, though perhaps a slightly more restrained version than we heard on some of the posse cuts the Invasion mixtapes gave us. As toned down as it may be, Em still sounds dead serious with his promise to have anyone killed in Hailie’s name should this beef ever cost him his life.This after mentioning too that if Ja doesn’t quit while he’s ahead, someone from G-Unit could kill him. Interestingly, in *Bully* Em also mentions Suge Knight for the first time (referencing his control over Irv Gotti), a line which is obviously in direct opposition to the one we ended up getting on *Like Toy Soldiers*: “*I went my whole career without mentioning* \[Suge\],” where he mentions the hip-hop mogul without mentioning him at all. By contrast, it’s pretty clear that *Like* *Toy Soldiers* is a sanitized and tonally different version of *Bully*, one which he likely wrote after deciding *Encore* would no longer present a continuation of the beefs of the previous year.*Ricky Ticky Toc* would have further helped to set that cocky tone had it been included on the main album, but sadly was likely another track to be axed once the concept changed. *“Once you call my name out things will never be the same, they should have never let us get a foot in this game*” sounds like a foreboding warning to anyone/everyone in the wake of Em’s TKO beefs of 2002/2003. Em is making an example of both Ja and Benzino here; let the quick work he made of them be a warning to anyone else with their eyes on the prize. Right after mentioning how far the beef with Benzino went, Em tells us he wants more: *“I’m waiting for that next beef, I’m cocked, locked and loaded, I’m ready to go so bad I’m going bananas”* all but confirms Em’s desire to stir shit up on this album. Soon after these bars, he’s quick to assert his dominance over any would-be challengers: *“Egos aside, 'fore I bruise 'em all. Swallow your pride ‘fore I step on it with shoes you call Nikes, Earthlings, how do you like these? You gotta love ‘em, look at the bottom of em, they’re like cleats. Stompin’.*” The vintage Nate Dogg hook on Encore’s second track, *Never Enough*, also speaks to the originally intended flavour of the album: “*no matter how many MC’s I eat up, it’s never enough.”*

**Ǝ**

So, just how beefy was *Encore* going to be, that’s the question. I think the answer is…pretty beefy.  *Can-I-Bitch* is a decidedly more playful diss track, this time aimed at Canibus. A creative tour-de-force to the tune of Slick Rick’s *Children’s Stories*, Em has finally devoted an entire track to Canibus, and even if it is a bit silly, it’s still a fun ride (in the Rapmobile). In the track, he also sneaks in quick jabs at Jermaine Dupri and the Pet Shop Boys, the latter having penned a song about Em’s allegedly homophobic lyrics in [2002.So](http://2002.So) as some names begin to pile up here, are we perhaps seeing some of this supposed “list” of Em’s? Was he perhaps planning to respond in typical Eminem fashion to some of those who had dissed him during his rise to the top? A few of the name of this supposed Shit List: Ja Rule. Benzino. Canibus. Jermaine Dupri. Suge Knight? (Pet Shop Boys, lol?). Who else might have been on this list? Perhaps some would just get the odd bar, others entire tracks. Are there more diss tracks from this period stashed in the vault which didn’t see the light of day because they were shelved when the concept changed? Most certainly. A more aggressive track aimed at Canibus perhaps? Probably. Considering how aggressive *Monkey See Monkey Do* sounded, I’d like to think he recorded more aggressive bars than we got with *Can-I-Bitch* and *Bully*, perhaps some savage battle rap-style bars to finally eat up Canibus once and for all.On another one of the leaked tracks, Em rides Ja Rule some more, this time with D12, on *Come On In.* Em touches on the sport of hip-hop and his preference to keep it on wax, but hints once more that if you push him, he might take it further: *“I’d much rather lift a pencil than a pistol when I’m pissed now, but it all depends on just how far it gets took on the mic, cause I’m telling you right now, you’re not gonna like it.”*  Given Em’s apparent creative direction, there is little doubt this was likely to be the D12 cut on the  project, in the place of the mediocre *One Shot 2 Shot*. Clearly, Encore is about as ‘gangsta' as Em has ever sounded on an album; not his style per se, but one fans were happy to hear from as he was righteously pissed after having heard Hailie’s name on that Ja track.The swagger he had during this period was truly something else. The outro on *Monkey See Monkey Do* further solidifies how cocky and confident he was feeling, hence the desire to brings these beefs to the fore as a part of the album experience.There is little doubt beef and battling were at the top of his mind in ‘04, and fittingly so considering the world had just been introduced to his origin story in the Oscar-winning 8 Mile. At the end of *Monkey* he speaks to anyone who might want to step into the ring against him and the rest of the Shady camp: *“We ain’t just talking to one person. We talking to every-motherfucking-body who wants to bring it, cuz we bringing it to anybody who wants to bring it. So bring it. Don’t pick up the ball if you don’t wanna play, man. It’s all fucked up now. The fuck I’m suppose to do now? Huh? The fuck I’m suppose to do?*”  The Diddy reference at the end also speaks to Em’s apparent boredom at the top, asking what else he’s got to prove, or do, besides defend the throne upon which he sits. Any challengers? I believe this is exactly where Em’s head was at for those initial *Encore* recording sessions. Was it hubris? Perhaps. Would it have made for an entertaining album? [Absolutely.  ](http://Absolutely.Now)

Now, let’s consider *We As Americans*. If this track hadn’t leaked, not only would it have been included on *Encore*, it would have been hailed as one of the best tracks on the album, but what’s more interesting is that it would have made him a poster boy for the Second Amendment, whether he intended it or not. In the song, Em is referencing his gun charges and subsequent probation, while questioning how he’s supposed to protect himself in the meantime. With his bare hands? Yeah, right. Later in the song, joking or not, he mentions the need to have a couple of concealed carries tucked away. We as Americans. We have to protect ourselves….by any means. With this song’s inclusion, the album takes on a *very* different tone indeed, especially in the absence of much of the silly filler. 

Notably, on the D12 track, there’s also talk about the possibility of taking rap beefs past the mere swapping of verses: *“…and that’s when it just happens and I snap then it’s a wrap, then it’s a scrap and it isn’t rap, is it?* *Hip-hop isn’t a sport anymore when you gotta go and resort back into that shit. Maybe I’m old fashioned but my passion is to smash anyone rapping without having to slap him. Believe me, I’d much rather lift a pencil than a pistol when I’m pissed now, but it depends on just how far it gets took on the mic.” \*gun shots\**  Add to that *We As Americans’* likely placement in-between the two skits that mention a supposed gun purchase by Em (which he denies making), and it seems to further solidify the notion that Em was trying to say at least \**something\** about gun rights. On the other hand, the mass shooting at the end of *Encore* adds a whole different dimension to the theoretical gun politics of this almost album. There is no doubt that the album was going to be a vastly different experience, and the other leaked gem is yet further proof of that.

The darkest track on the album, *Love You More*, adds another layer here. While the song is notable for the brutal honesty and dark imagery in the lyrics touching once more on his tumultuous relationship with Kim, those lyrics aside, that the song begins with the two of them in some Bonnie ’n Clyde-type scenario, cocking their guns and shooting them in unison…again, just imagine the original tone of this would-be album right now. This isn’t toilet humour, this isn’t gay put-put golf, and this isn’t puppet dog beefs….this *Encore* that Eminem wanted to give us was clearly something else entirely, and it would have no doubt been another very strong entry in his catalogue. Interestingly, on this (the real?) *Encore* (or something like it), Em also seems to have largely traded the dissing of pop stars heard on previous releases for more focused attacks on rappers and rivals in the industry; a refreshing change, as any Eminem fan would agree. Back once more to the possible promo track, *Monkey*: “You pussies think I went soft cuz 8 Mile, when I come back I’ll be shooting more than just paint balls” does not sound like the words of an artist about to give us a scattered and cheesy album bordering on self-parody.  On the contrary, Em sounds hungrier than ever and ready to feast on rapper's corpses.

So, the evidence is there to suggest *Encore* was going to be Em’s most combative album to date, cocky and sure of himself in a way we hadn’t heard before on a studio album - braggadocios as all hell with a classic trilogy under his belt, a biopic to his name, and the release of 50 Cent’s debut album *Get Rich or Die Trying* pushing Shady Records further into the spotlight as rap’s preeminent label. All things considered, it seems *Encore* was going to be a portrait of a rapper (‘slash actor’) at the top of his game, playing king of the castle with his competitors, while flaunting the success and dominance of his label. He was going to stomp on Ja in solidarity with 50; he was addressing the Racist tapes and airing his beef with Source magazine owner, Ray Benzino, who had accused him of trying to steal and destroy hip-hop culture; he would tell us more of his origin story in Detroit and bring us deeper into his dark and complicated relationship with Kim; he would address his gun charges and his suspended 2nd amendment rights, all in the wake of superstardom so immense that it was threatening his right to privacy more than ever before.  And by the end, in the final song/title track *Encore/Curtain Down,* he reminds everyone that his legacy has been a positive contribution to the culture as he helped bring hip-hop to a larger audience, reaching new ears around the world. So, anyone that tells you *Encore* was supposed to be the cheesy, uninspired mess we got, since he was all drugged out at the time, just doesn’t have all the facts: *Encore* was going to be dope as fuck. But then the leak happened.

**Ǝ**

When I consider the apparent gun politics of ALT-ƎRNCORE, at first it seems quite pro 2nd Amendment (based mainly on the lyrics from *We As Americans*), but when you consider this hypothetical track list on the whole, it ends up sounding almost like an argument against guns, a cautionary tale perhaps (which lines up with the axed *Like Toy Soldiers*, but with a different, darker tone entirely). Now, whether this was intended, we may never know, but let’s look at the events on the album:  you got a rapper, embroiled in beefs that got very personal the previous year, who states he’d rather keep it on wax, cuz that’s the sport of hip-hop upon which he was raised.  But if history has told us anything, it’s that when things get heated in rap beefs, shit can happen. So on first listen, we’re wondering where this is going? Clearly he gets his hands on a gun or two, as we hear on *We As Americans* and *Love You More.* Perhaps listeners were supposed to be wondering just how ‘gangster’ Em was going to be as the album played out, but then when you get to the end of the album, he keeps the battles on wax like the battle rapper he is, and instead, in a surprise ending nobody saw coming, we get Eminem going all Mandalay Bay on his own fans in a mass shooting/suicide to end his career (Reminder, for those that may not know: at the time, *Encore* was rumoured to be his last album; a working title of ‘The Funeral’ had even floated around the web). No matter which way you look at it, there’s no doubt guns were a part of some kind of album narrative here.

But what happened happened, and it would result in the first real blemish on Em’s discography. Not only had two standout songs leaked, but the others had revealed too much of the intended direction and general flavour of the album, something which I’m sure he’d hoped to keep close to his chest. But the cat was out of the bag, and so…Em abandons all tracks that were leaked, as well as some others that were written for the album (*Ricky Ticky Toc*) and goes the other way. He writes *Like Toy Soldiers*, a decidedly more introspective look at the beefs where he takes the high road instead, officially squashing the beef and then gets to work on trying to fill out the rest of the album. Unfortunately, lacking any real direction in the absence of what had been taken from him, he replaces much of it with the tracks that *Encore* tends to be remembered for, the goofier ones, and while still fun, the tone of the album is what suffers the most and we end up with something rather directionless and seemingly uninspired. To be fair, half of Encore truly remains a classic, while the other half…not so much, as Eminem himself has stated many years later: ”I’m cool with probably half that album,” he said of the album in a 2017 interview. Indeed, there’s some peak Em on Encore. The album just lacked that certain feel, that mood, the polished product we’d come to expect from Marshall which he’d delivered on each of his previous releases.

And so, as I said at the top of this long-winded essay…the other day I got to wondering just what *Encore* would have sounded like if we’d gotten the album Em had originally intended to make had those “*oh so notorious tracks”* not leaked in December 2003. Just what does *Encore* look like in that alternate timeline, the one where that friend of Em’s brother Nate (as the rumour went at time) didn’t steal a CD full of tracks intended for big bro’s next album… right off Nate’s coffee table when he wasn’t looking (yes, that was really the rumour).

The evidence strongly suggests, and this essay further demonstrates, that it would have been a very compelling follow-up his massively successful trilogy. So…how do you follow-up SSLP, MMLP and TES? What DO you do for an Encore?? By asserting dominance and playfully gloating about being the best, of course. So let’s take a look at what might have been, and as you do, know one thing for certain: this hypothetical track list is, without a doubt, a lot closer to how the album was initially intended than what we got. This proposed track list is a sort of Best Guess, based on what we know, and some of what we got, with a couple of fictional, but highly likely, vault tracks that were shelved thrown in for good measure. So buckle in to the RapMobile, and enjoy this timewarp back to the year…2004.           

Eminem has been in the studio for the past year. No tracks ever leaked and the last thing we’ve heard from Em via the label was his *8 Mile OST* contributions *Lose Yourself*, *8 Mile*, *Rabbit Run and Love Me*. People with their ear to the streets (read: paying attention to the internets) had heard the mixtapes and were treated to *The Sauce* and *Nail in the Coffin* as well as *Bump Heads, Hail Mary, Doe Rae Me,* and *Go To Sleep* in the past year or so as Em, 50 and D12 went at Ja Rule, Murder Inc, and Ray Benzino, co-owner of the Source magazine, with a certain ruthlessness fans hadn’t seen before in Em’s career. Clearly a lot had happened since the Eminem Show, and he had a lot to get off his chest…

**Ǝ**

The New Year hits, it’s 2004. You turn on the radio to your local hip-hop station and hear the deejay talking about a brand new song from Eminem that he’s about to debut, a promo track from the latest Shady Records mixtape, this time hyping Em’s follow-up to TES. The rumoured title…is ENCORE.

The beat drops, you hear Em laugh:\*

*“Heyo, Fifty…what I tell you? We ain’t even have to say shit. They did it…ha ha!”Monkey See, Monkey Do, don’t ever make the first move, just let ‘em come to you…”*

The internet is all atwitter - before Twitter -  about the upcoming Em album to be released in April. Many people (the masses) have never heard him talk this way; hoping high calibre rappers would come at him so he can dust off his chainsaw? He’s got a million bucks for anyone who gets on a track and spanks them? No doubt many, fans included, are hearing about the beef with Ja Rule/Benzino here for the first time too. 

And so, without further ado, I bring to you… the track list as it was (hypothetically, of course) intended to be. For reference below, I’ve included all relevant lyrics from various songs that help illustrate what I believe is Em’s initial creative direction for the album, many that made it onto Encore and some that didn’t. As an addendum to the track list, I’ve also listed main topics and ideas from each song that made the ALT-ƎRNCORE track list, which I believe further demonstrate the rather cohesive themes that appears to hang over this mysterious body of work. While much of the bones of this almost album are very much present in parts of the *Encore* we got…the true flavour of Em’s intended direction for the album truly come into focus with the inclusion of the excluded tracks which allows this listener to view the works through a fresh, much darker lens…

First dates can be like job interviews with cocktails — a little nerve-racking, full of first impressions, and hopefully with a better dress code. But worry not, my charming friend — if you want to make her feel comfortable, keep the vibe exciting, and boost your ""I want to see him again"" score, I’ve got you covered with **50 creative, thoughtful, and fun first date ideas** that will have her smiling, laughing, and low-key wondering how she got so lucky.

Let’s dive in 👇

**⭐️ Making a Great First Impression**

1. **Be on time.** Not just fashionably — actually on time. Respect is attractive.
2. **Dress like you care.** You don’t need a tux, but a clean, stylish outfit says *“I tried.”*
3. **Give a genuine compliment.** Something thoughtful like “You’ve got an amazing smile” works better than “You look hot.”
4. **Smile and make eye contact.** Instant charisma points.
5. **Put your phone away.** She should feel like she’s the most interesting thing in the room — because she is.
6. **Hold the door open.** Chivalry isn't dead; it just needed a rebrand.
7. **Smell nice.** Subtle cologne = game changer.
8. **Ask questions, then really listen.** Show you care about what she’s saying — not just waiting for your turn to talk.
9. **Be positive.** No complaints about your ex, your job, or traffic.
10. **Laugh (even at her cheesy jokes).** It's all about good energy!

**💬 Making Her Feel Comfortable**

1. **Pick a public place for the first hang.** A coffee shop or cute park is low-pressure and easygoing.
2. **Let her choose the vibe.** “Would you rather grab sushi or walk around the botanical garden?” – options = comfort.
3. **Don’t over-interrogate.** This is a date, not a background check.
4. **Respect her boundaries.** Physical, emotional, conversational — all of them.
5. **Keep your hands to yourself (unless she initiates).** Slow and steady wins the race.
6. **Be warm, not weird.** Flirty, not creepy. There's a difference.
7. **Make her laugh without trying too hard.** A clever observation > forced dad joke.
8. **Don’t brag.** Confidence is quiet. Bragging is insecure in a tuxedo.
9. **Mind your manners.** “Please,” “thank you,” and not interrupting — simple stuff that matters.
10. **Share a little about yourself.** Vulnerability builds trust (but don’t trauma dump).

5. **Do a Mini Photo Booth Scrapbook Together** Every booth you see, take a strip. Later, make a mini scrapbook and give her a copy.

  


  




**❤️ Making Her Like You (for You)**

1. **Be authentically yourself.** The real you > the ""perfect"" version.
2. **Talk about your passions.** Passion is magnetic. Whether it’s music, cooking, or UFO documentaries — let it shine.
3. **Share funny stories about your life.** Vulnerability + humor = connection.
4. **Be playful.** Tease her (lightly), make bets, create inside jokes.
5. **Give her space to be herself.** Let her talk, be silly, and show off her own personality.
6. **Be curious about her.** Ask about her dreams, her favorite books, her childhood dog.
7. **Show empathy.** Listen to her struggles, not just her wins.
8. **Don’t try to ""win"" the date.** You’re not performing, you’re vibing.
9. **Make her feel safe.** Whether it’s walking her to her car or watching how you treat the waiter.
10. **Drop subtle hints that you're looking for something real.** If that’s your vibe — make sure it shows.





**🔁 Building That “Can’t Wait to See You Again” Energy**

1. **Do a spontaneous activity.** “Hey, wanna grab gelato before we head home?”
2. **End the date at a scenic spot.** Beach, city skyline, quiet overlook — vibe it out.
3. **Take a cute selfie together.** Frame it like “we need to remember this moment!”
4. **Make her a playlist afterward.** Bonus if you subtly include a song you both liked that night.
5. **Text her that night.** “Had a blast tonight. You’ve got an amazing energy.”
6. **Mention a fun second date idea.** “Next time, we need to try mini-golf. I’m terrible, but I bet you’re worse.”
7. **Leave her wanting more.** End the night before it drags. Always better to exit with the energy still high.
8. **Compliment her again before leaving.** “You made tonight really special.”
9. **Give a warm hug.** Maybe a kiss — *if* the vibe feels right and it’s mutual.
10. **Follow up the next day.** Not a love poem — just a thoughtful check-in: “Still smiling about last night.”

# Final Tips: The Real Secret Sauce 🥂

Dates aren’t about perfection — they’re about **connection**. So take the pressure off. Be a gentleman with a side of fun, stay present, and remember: she’s probably just as nervous as you are. The goal isn’t to impress her by being someone else. It’s to **show her why the real you is unforgettable**.

Now go out there, make her laugh, learn something new, and maybe, just maybe… start the best story of your life.",1,1744317074.0,PsychicLasVegas,0,1.0,False
1jw7zhu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1jw7zhu/venting_and_looking_for_advice/,Venting and looking for advice,"Hi all,

Been going through it with gastritis, I wanted to talk about my experience so far and hopefully get some insight from others and not feel so alone in this. January 2025 I went to the ER with burning nausea in my stomach, shortness of breath, and light headed. They did CT scan and blood work and all looked good. Later went to my PCP and was given omeprazole and was doing pretty good aside from slight nausea for 3-4 weeks. Until March came around, I had a massive fare up. I couldn’t sleep, couldn’t eat, and heart rate was very high leading me to go back to the ER again. Again, they did CT scan and blood work and everything was fine. I was given Pepcid and Maalox Max instead and again was doing a little better but was still pretty nauseous and now extreme anxiety so I went and scheduled my endoscopy. 

My endoscopy showed mild reflux esophagitis, non erosive gastritis, negative for celiac and negative H. Pylori, and was given pantoprazole. I went all in with the low acidic whole foods diet - no coffee,  soda, alcohol, gluten, or chocolate. Also I’ve tried bone broth and aloe Vera juice in the morning and fish oil which seemed to help. I am finally able to eat full meals but I am still experiencing on and off nausea, random anxiety (even when I’m not having anxious thoughts), and now my chest and throat are tight. Zyrtec and propranolol seem to help but it could be placebo at this point. 

I don’t overuse NSAIDS or drink alcohol, I wasn’t stressed during the initial flare up, negative for celiac and H. Pylori so I’m at a loss for what’s causing this. My GI is testing me next for gallbladder issues but other than that I won’t go back to my GI until July so I feel like I’m on my own to figure this out. I feel like being on PPIs since January are giving me anxiety and histamine issues. I also have a vacation coming up in two weeks and it’s making me more anxious and I’m worried about what I’m going to eat on the drive (18 hours). 

If you’ve experienced this and found light at the end of the tunnel I would love to hear some good thoughts! Any advice is welcome also :)",1,1744317063.0,Gastritis,1,1.0,False

I have never written anything on here, you are my last resort, I have no idea what to think.

For context, I (23F), Danny (19M), Paul (21M) and Theo (22M) have all been recruited last september as apprentices in a carpentry workshop. In my country, we apprentices go to school on certain weeks to pursue education in woodworking alongside our employment in order to get our degree. We four all attend the same school, although not always at the same time and Paul and Danny are in the same class.

At the start of september, Danny stroke us as a very friendly dude. He's coming from the Ivory Coast, has a very strong accent, learned our language two years ago and he stutters very badly, making communication difficult for him. Despite his struggles, the team has seemingly always been respectful of his difficulties and we would always give him the time to finish his sentences without being interrupted and would teach him about our language and culture from time to time. 

The atmosphere was great between us four and our managers. Paul and Danny started to get pretty close, always cracking jokes at one another. We all worked together well, were started to build some friendships and we would laugh through the days. Then Danny suddendly backed away from all of us. He stopped eating our meals then stopped coming with us for lunch. He stopped changing in the locker rooms, stopped having coffee or a break in a breakroom with the rest of us. He stopped joking, checking on us, talking to us and saying 'hi' in the morning. He would only ever interact with the managers or would answer, visibly very annoyed, when directly asked something. We thought he was going through something and because we knew he was very secretive we didn't want to push the issue, thinking it would get better. It did, a little. He started to talk to Theo again, when me and Paul weren't present. But for us two, it's like we've never existed at all, and worse because he will avoid to look at us at all cost. Between us and Danny, nothing happened that could explain this. Nothing that I can recall or interpret this way. We, I, might have done something but I can't figure out what.

I'm entirely lost here. I remember Danny being the sweetest man, laughing all the time, giving compliments on everyone's work, tossing ducktape at me everytime he went by, checking my injury for himself when I got hurt on a construction site... He seemed to be growing a lot of confidence around Paul, I once noticed his stutter disminishing when talking to him. He's a damn good worker too, I would take a lot of advice from him. But now he's gone and I miss him and the joy he used to bring to the workshop. At the same time, I'm also very frustrated by his behaviour which is on the edge of disrespectful at times. 

Then I remember this one morning. He had stopped talking to us by then but he entered the breakroom and gave me his radiant smile, like nothing was wrong, like he had forgotten he was supposed to dislike me. I never saw it since.

I know Danny has had the thoughest life you can think of. I don't much of it, but he's missing a piece of his ear and has the deep shining eyes of the ones who have had the roughest journeys to flee their country. He's a warrior, and one with scars, no doubt. I don't think I can ever imagine what his thoughts might be like, but maybe you guys can help a little.

Thank you for anyone who might read this (not sure it will ever be read lol) and sorry for the English mistakes you might have encounter.

I’ve been experimenting with making good-quality ice cream at home. Recently, I found out that my favorite ice cream shop in Berlin uses condensed milk (Kondensmilch) in their recipes, and I’m really interested in trying it myself.

However, I’ve only been able to find the sweetened versions or the small shelf-stable bottles made for coffee. I’m specifically looking for a fresh, unsweetened milk concentrate—something closer to regular milk but with higher protein and carbohydrate content. I believe that’s what the ice cream shop is using.

Does anyone know where I can buy this kind of fresh condensed or concentrated milk in Berlin (or Germany in general)?

Thanks in advance for your help!

Hey! I’m a 32-year-old guy from Michigan—athletic build, green eyes, brown hair, 5'10"". I work a weird hybrid schedule that makes my hours a little unpredictable, but I’m flexible and can make time for the right person.

When the weather’s nice, I’m all about hiking, kayaking, and anything outside. When it’s not, I’m into coffee, cuddles, binge-watching shows, and getting lost in a good book. I’m laid-back, sarcastic (in the fun way), and big on physical touch—definitely the affectionate type when I’m into someone.

I’m looking to connect with someone who’s fun, consistent, and flirty with a good sense of humor. No expectations or pressure—just open to seeing where things go, whether it’s a new friend, a close connection, or something in between.

If you love the outdoors, can dish out sarcasm as well as you take it, and enjoy physical affection, I’d love to hear from you. Let’s trade laughs, banter, and maybe a few secrets.",1,1744316403.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

Also for the first time in my career, I'll be working in a downtown area in a major city.

Unlike previous jobs where I could easily carry things in from the parking lot (e.g., a backpack and an open tote), I'll likely alternate between commuting on public transit and driving/parking downtown. Both involve a bit of a walk to my desk.

Because of this, I'm thinking it'd be best to carry a single bag – something that can ***comfortably*** (for me) hold my laptop, electronics, water bottle, coffee thermos, other bits and bobs, and some kind of lunch container. Waterproofing would also be great.

I have a variety of bags already ([Filson 256](https://www.heddels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/filson-256-classic-briefcase-review-worn-out-beige-bag-recumbent.jpg) briefcase, [Visvim 20L](https://www.blueowl.us/cdn/shop/files/2024_08_Product_Visvim_Cordura20LBackpackinCharcoalLambskin_1415_grande.jpg?v=1724789634), [South2West8 Sunforger briefcase](https://img02.shop-pro.jp/PA01125/017/product/74315724_o1.jpg?20140423111143), [1733/Willian Ellery tote](https://williamellery.co/cdn/shop/files/DSCF6563.jpg?v=1734021378&width=990)), and they're all nice, but I feel they all have some sort of deficiency - too small, lack of organization, backpack isn't the most professional, single strap/briefcase is too uncomfortable for longer amounts of walking).

I'm also considering picking up a ULA Daylight for a trip, and while may not be ideal either, it might also be a good option due to the capacity, comfort, and waterproofing.

So, what do you carry to work? What kind of bag do you use? How do you bring food/drink to the office?",4,1744316266.0,ManyBaggers,16,1.0,False

Once the vertigo run was finished  I desperately began searching for my next high to fill the empty void  that left and remembered I really loved the Jessica Jones show so I begin a deep dive into her comics only to realize how little there actually are.

Adore Alias and I was incredibly hyped for what came next. And what came next? Some questions don't have answers. Pulse barely packed a punch for me. Really like Bendis he's great but you can't start your character out in the Max universe then go into the mainline run like that cause the waterdowing of it all was just wow like discovering this new favorite drink of yours and feeling like you're on top of the world then someone takes the alcohol out of said drink. Sure it's still the same drink taste wise. But does it really feel like the same drink? 

Ranting I know. Pulse and Blindspot are alright 

I know she has the Jessica Jones run that released with the show and the Defenders miniseries run of like ten issues but that is literally it. 

And I know, I know she's a main like supporting character in a lot of avenger books but I don't really give two shits about that cause the story isn't focused on her. 

  
Call this a rant or cry for help whatever , don't have anyone else to talk about this with. First thing I see when I wake up is my 26 volumes off Hellblazer and the realization that Jessica doesn't even have enough solo stories to fill 3 volumes of that. It's sad but I'm just disappointed that marvel doesn't seem interested in doing anything with her character. 

The reason I keep bringing up Hellblazer is cause we got another run that's actually pretty incredible? Love Spurrier's take on Constantine and it came out of nowhere. it's like 20 plus issues now, sure it got cancelled midway through but it's here. We actually have three new Hellblazer volumes released in the last five years and that's just nothing short of incredible. Why can't Jessica get another Alias run?

Is this what I heard about when you discover that one character who you just latch onto but is simply too niche to solo projects? Blind spot was released five years ago now and that was only six issues. I just crave more of her and her world, her place in the marvel universe. 

Heard a story about this  Simone run off hers where Jess' struggles with alcoholism is censored and replaced with a coffee addiction. wow. Some people are just better suited to mature brand. Cause what do you mean you can't show a character having problems of addiction? It's pathetic

Gonna post this now as is cause I've been keeping the page open for a solid hour now and adding little thoughts to it. Need to get back the work at hand.

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. I won’t bring any drama into your life. 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. I am seeking a woman that is in her late 20s thats 25+ please to early 30s  please. Maturity is a big thing for me in someone too. 

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy that loves talking on voice chat. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use bad language vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love o have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test. I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I don’t work at the moment please be okay with all of this from the get go I’ve had terrible trouble trying to find suitable jobs but I have got plans for the future for things I’m not lazy or anything like that. I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work as I said. 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe.

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

1jw7imh,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1jw7imh/ashamed_of_my_parents/,Ashamed of my parents,"Absolutely ashamed of my parents. (Advised to seperate into paragraphs, sorry for the confusion haha)

This is going to be a very long story over several months so I’m so sorry for that. (Also charlotte if you read this. Love you and thank you for being my background noise while I work) I’m told I’m a bad story teller so please bear with me through this. Context for the people in this story: me (m26) mom (f45) dad (m48) sister (NB25) brotherA (m13-14) brotherB (m11). 

So this has a long backstory but let’s just start with where everything juicy started about 8 months ago. So during some of my own life turmoil I got a call from my father who decided to share that he has asked my mother for a divorce. This was a bit stunning but it’s honestly something I expected earlier in life and had been told that it was discussed multiple times growing up. So let’s cram some facts in here. For the next two months since learning that he came home from working out of state I learned a lot about why the divorce was finally asked for and was taken far enough to share with their children. I learned that dad had been sneaking back to the home state (a 6+ hour drive usually) to see someone he dated in high school. Let’s say Megan (F45). So he was caught on these dates by my sister occasionally which is wild to me. But, none the less, he has been sneaking back to our area and seeing this lady who I guess he had a pining love for. 

Now there’s a lot to unpack here.  The reason dad used to justify his cheating and ridiculousness is that FIFTEEN+ YEARS ago my mother cheated on him (unclear how far but a hotel room has been mentioned) but again. 15 years. You decided to stay with her and grow your relationship and family beyond that event. So I don’t see that as valid that 15 years later you cheat and cause all this. 

But back in track. So for these two months there was a lot of back and forth between my parents where my mother wanted to work things out and my father would keep her attention like he’s waving bait on a hook in front of a fish. But of course this was also met with crazy behavior by him where he began to stalk my mother. Tracking her location, phone calls, texts and even getting my younger brothers to tell him where she was going and who she spoke to on any given day. This was insane to me. There were cameras in the house one POINTING AT THEIR BED. So he could make sure she slept alone. When he’s the one sleeping with another woman???? 

So we get to a holiday. This holiday I have some obvious resentment for my father and have no interest in talking to him so I keep my distance. However I personally end up across the table from him where the first thing he says to me is “your job must be treating you well. You’re looking a little fat in the face”. This is obviously where I started having my own personal problems with him. So I left the event and we’re going to speed this story through another month of constant back and forth “we’re gonna work it out”. “We’re not working” you get the gist. 

So before we get to the next holiday my mother decides to make a surprise trip to see my father while they’re on a working it out kick. (Keep in mind Megan lives HERE((she did recently sell her house at this event time and was supposed to be moving to the west coast))) so my mother leaves and I help admittedly get her out of the house past cameras and such without him seeing. She is an hour away when he finally realizes she’s coming to him. He begins to gaslight her and tell her that he needs her at home because he has people coming to assess the house for XYZ blah blah. Making things up suddenly that could be handled without her on sight. So. She gets there. And it begins.  

She reaches his camper and we start the red flag list. 
#1 the door is unlocked. My father has never been a person to leave a door unlocked especially when he’s gone to work. That’s why I myself have to check doors are locked before bed. 
#2 there is a set up of laptop wires and computer equipment on the couch. My father does not do tech and his job is construction based. Manual labor. But who does…?  Megan is a work from home person. Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. 
#3 there is a coffee machine. This may seem small to you but I can tell you my father DOES NOT drink coffee. Never has. 
#4 the place is strangely clean.  Now I’m not proud of this but my personal cleaning habits that I used to have (I have improved thanks to my boyfriend) are a reflection of my father’s habits. He is not a clean man. 
And finally #5 she reaches the bedroom. Where there are obvious signs that both sides of the bed are in use. IE; messy bed both sides, water bottles both sides and the final nail. The women’s underwear and clothing in the dirty hamper and closet.   So this is the first BIT blowup of all of this. She tells him they need to talk. Now I also want to remind you my mother left here at 1AM and did not sleep because she had to get their teen children ready for school and in bed the prior night while also freaking out about this trip(which she traveled with a dog because no one could watch it). It is now roughly 9AM and she is heading to his job site.  She gets there and gets out of her car. And into the driver seat of his truck and locks the doors and rolls the windows down. 
Now this is obviously explained form her perspective but how I was told is that they talked through the window and he denied her being there. Then said she was there a few days ago. Then suddenly she left last night. Then this morning  etc etc. you get the point. So after the conversation he apparently starts yelling at her and she unlocks the door and he gets in the truck as she is already walking away. Now we’re proud. This is good. Proud of you mom. Stand your ground. 

Well, That didn’t last long. I’m gonna give you a fake date range for this.  So let’s say this all happened on May 1st. She leaves to get a hotel and sleep and then drive home.  Before she can keep that mindset he ends up blowing up her phone and she ends up at his motorhome. Spends a night. Spends another night. Then May 4th arrives. There is a weather event that ends up making it to where she cannot come home. So she ends up staying there for an additional 5 days.  And this is where I get mad at my mom and am tired of this.  Because she should have left. On “May” the 8th is her son’s birthday. 13-14 both of his parents miss his birthday as he has been bounced around for the last week between my sister and my grandmother to help get them to school and otherwise.  I don’t need to go into how mad this made me and disappointed. My mother never missed her children’s birthdays. It’s something I always remembered is that she was always there. For all of us. But this ridiculousness had gotten so out of hand that she lost her sense of priorities. 

Now this bandaid lasted roughly a week. Maybe two before I started getting texts from my dad that he wanted to talk. He called me while I was at work and I told him if he needed to say something he could call me when I’m not at my work (brag context but I’m working on starting my own business so I’m very busy and don’t want that kind of drama to be brought into my work life) so that text exchange continued for 2 days when he finally just typed out what he wants to say and sends it to me (surprise) while I’m at work around 9AM. I’m gonna attach the texts to the comments for a lot of these exchanges coming up. But he basically said they’re no longer working to resolve their problems and that I should check in on her and keep contact with her to make sure she’s safe.  So I wait roughly two weeks of hearing all this extra context from my mother, sister and other family members.  So I’m gonna spit out a bunch of stuff that is going to really cloud your view of who is the “bad” guy here. But it’s the truth. And then I’ll say what I said to address the situation. 

1. my mother did step out confirmed 16 years ago now. 
2. My father had been seeing this woman for close to a year by this point and she is now living down near his work site and has rented an apartment which he has slowly moved into with her. 
3. My mother has received a gift of ONE article of clothing and a necklace from a mystery man. Who she cut off and then mystery man messaged my father which is what he(dad) says is what actually started all of this. 
4. I was given information that my dad doesn’t want to stay with her and is just dragging her along intentionally because it’s cheaper than getting a divorce. 
5. Through both of these sides of the events the Facebook has been LIT UP with passive aggressive posts. Woe is me. And I’m the innocent party posts and crap. This lead me to muting and deleting my father and muting my mothers posts. 

I think that’s most of it. now. I sent a text to my father because while all this has happened, I’m an adult. I don’t really feel the effects of what is happening other than the obvious drama and emotions anyone would experience. But the main problem I have is that my mother has been open and honest with me. Every time something happened, if I was told something that she hadn’t told me she would be honest and tell me it was true(we will get to one of those soon) while my father would never take responsibility for his behavior and his actions all while acting this way. In front of a 14 and 11 year old.  This drove me crazy. And there was a specific snapping point for me that he said something in form of my younger brother (14) that I just wasn’t going to tolerate seeing anymore. So I sent him a message trying to hold him accountable for him actions. Not blaming him, not hating on him, and in my opinion. It was a very level and non hostile message. (Again attached below) in response to my message I received a deflecting message, a blaming message and no accountability taken for the actions that I was trying to make him aware of what he is portraying in front of impressionable young men and a public audience of his family and others on Facebook. all of which is just saturated in, lies and miss direction. (Also attached below) now also in that message, he mentioned a few things that my mother did some of them are too far and should not be actions that anyone ever takes. However, after nearly 6 months of manipulation abuse and just overall lies, I see how she reached to that point. 

Now I talked to her about that and she admitted that what was stated did occur and she admitted that she regrets it. And I don’t think there’s much more to it beyond that because yes it did occur, but she is taking accountability for her actions and being a responsible adult in the face of pure adversity for someone that she has been with and married for nearly 27 years. Now my message to my father ended all contact with him. I have not had any contact with him since which is where we’re going to jump around a little bit for the next two months so over this time. They began divorce proceedings, he was served with papers, they both retained lawyers, some of those proceedings happened, and there were settlements beginning to be agreed on there was already some divisions of property where my mother took some of her own stuff and set up her own bank account, her own phone plan and all of this stuff. I was very proud of my mother, which is a weird thing to say about your own mother, but I grew up with my father and we had some very deep talks about how he was abusive. He was manipulative. He didn’t treat her well from what I saw growing up and I think that really stuck with her, but I think it was necessary. 

So with all of that context, you are basically caught up to today as of today my mother has taken it upon herself to announce to me that my father has approached her instead of her approaching him and requested that they try to work things out, and she has accepted because she believes that him approaching her instead is going to mean a world of difference for their future. Now, at this time, I have started to take care of myself. I am trying to be healthier and I’m trying to have less drama so maybe I was a little blunt, but it was just my mother and I(until now) and I told her that she is stupid. That I love her and that I will be here for her in the ways that I can, as a son can be for their mother, but that her accepting another opportunity to let him back in and harm her is absolutely ridiculous, and that I am disappointed that she would accept that from him. 
After all of the motivation that she put up in all of the progress that she had made to finally be independent and not allow him to treat her that way all because he came crawling back because he was starting to realize through these court proceedings how much he was going to lose. Because he was going to lose a lot. He was the primary income. He was going to have to pay child support she was going to get the home so that the boys had a stable place to live in because he is out of state. He will not be able to continue to take care of them in any other way except for Financially. All because he realized how much he would lose, he came crawling back, asked for another chance and her tender heart caved. Now, like I said, it’s her decision and I respect that she has the decision to make those choices about her life, but I’m allowed to be disappointed in those and i’m allowed to keep my own boundaries up over this because I have cut him off and we are now reaching another holiday which we host (my boyfriend and I) at our house and I have set clear boundaries that he will not be allowed on our property. and I think that really hurt her and she tried to justify him being there because he wanted to be there for his family and for the boys. But truly, I told her no, and that he will not be allowed to attend, and that if he attends he will be asked to leave. We aren’t having the holiday on the actual holiday so they can still do their own thing, but this one is ours and we are hosting it and I have set that boundary and that’s where I stand.

I know that was a lot, but that’s the full story so far as of today that is parts one through three of the story so I guess I’ll update this when the next thing happens
