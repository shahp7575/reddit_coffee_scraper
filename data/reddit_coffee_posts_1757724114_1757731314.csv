I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

1nfm03o,https://www.reddit.com/r/WomenDatingOverForty/comments/1nfm03o/finally_i_pulled_the_plug_and_quit_dating_apps/,"Finally, I pulled the plug and quit dating apps FOR GOOD","Jeez I feel so good. 

 I am one of the countless people that have been complaining about dating apps for years. I would regularly take breaks, sometimes up to 6-7 months, but always with the intention of going back because I genuinely believed I could find love there. I kept attributing my lack of success to contingent factors and changed my selection method countless times. Until now.

After 5 years of use, I have finally this unshakable clarity that love on dating apps is simlly never going to happen. Imo, dating apps have faced the same process of enshittification of most social media. Also check out [ this video ](https://youtu.be/7J1lxTwvzZE?si=pgreb30BchI3sHfo).

If i think about how during all these years I had hundreds of dates, it's INSANE that none of them led to a real lasting relationship. I only experienced endless disappointments over and over again. 

These are the only ones I considered having relationship with before they showed their true cards: 

• a love bomber who behaved super weirdly, with massive hot and cold cycles that destroyed my mental health at the time. I remember the first date after my divorce, I was so clueless and actually believed that that man was looking for love on the apps. It took me a year to get over that psychopath.

• a (secretly) married man with a family in another city;

• a man who brought me to expensive dinners and trips cosplaying a relationship, but when I refused to spend the after dinner at home having sex and suggested an actual activity he ghosted me live, in the middle of a Saturday night. This one was probably the grossest one after the married man. I am horrified with his lack of emotional intelligence. 

 I'm not even mentioning the countless pointless dates that over the years became more and more low effort and meaningless and just a complete waste of time. The last actual date i had i was bored to death because he couldn't even manage to ask me a question.

My mental sanity really took a toll. Because getting your hopes up and then being hit by the disappointment over and over again is just so soul destroying. It would affect my mood in subtle and pervasive ways that it is impossible to quantify. I wish I could have a graph of the emotional turmoil, and the times without apps were the most emotionally stable and joyful ones.

The last interactions are what made all this frustration click into a deep, irrevocable sense that I am so very done with this shit.

 One man invited me to meet up at a subway station. I mentioned I'd prefer a plan and he was unable to come up with one. I was too exhausted to do the emotional labor so I unmatched. The other one asked me out for a ""quick coffee."" In the past I would have gone, but this time around I know that it will be a complete waste of time. 

After these last poor interactions, I realized how little enthusiasm I was having and how, even if i seemed to like them from their profiles, I could not keep up with this BS anymore. 

I am sure there are some good men out there, but all the energy, work, time and psychological damage of going through all the shitty ones is just simply not worth it.

I am feeling already a deep sense of peace i haven't felt in a long time. I know deep down that I will never regret deleting my profile. 

I had obviously thought of getting off of them for the longest time, but never truly believed that I was done. 

At this time around, I feel this strong sense of revulsion for the apps and simultaneously joy for a new chapter of my life. I feel even more motivated to meet more new people in real life. My goal is to make more friends. What I really crave is real human connection. I realized that when I feel connected to friends my desire for a romantic relationship goes through the floor. 

I feel this wave of compassion for myself, for all the times that I believed I was the problem. Look at me, a bright, kind, funny, intelligent woman so full of life and love to give. I deserve love, not this shit.

Do i feel lonely? Yes. Do I want to find love? Yes. Do I feel sad about not coming home to a loving partner? Absolutely. YET, all of these sad feelings are only massively amplified and made worse by dating apps use.",5,1757730554.0,WomenDatingOverForty,0,1.0,False

I’m researching the habits of Australians when it comes to takeaway coffee and reusable cups. Whether you use a reusable cup every day or never have, I’d love to hear your perspective.

I'm exploring an idea for a collapsible reusable coffee cup that’s more compact than most existing designs and made from biodegradable materials — something easier to carry and better for the environment.

The survey takes less than 3 minutes, and is open to Australian residents only.  
There’s an optional email field at the end if you’d like to hear about the idea or take part in future prototype testing.

Thanks so much — your insights are invaluable!

In yhe past few years the hitting has died down mostly because I chose to spend most of my time outside my house , but recently it has become a little much . I was having an argument with my mom about television usage when my grandmother wants to watch and it got heated . Most of it was her yelling at me but then she started swinging . I kept raising my hands as she yelled at me to put them down , she hit me twice once being a half slap half punch in the face and another in the stomach. The entire time she was getting mad calling me an animal and saying I am trash. Two days later I accidentally fall off my bed and of course she comes asking what happened with an angry tone . Embarrassed I spend the next couple minutes lying saying I didn’t know . She then gets mad and reaches for my phone . I yank it towards me as she starts yelling for me to give her the phone , eventually in the struggle I drop it between the bed and the wall , she asks me to retrieve it a couple times to each time I respond “how “. She then yells at me and says to not call her mom as she calls me an animal and trash again . I genuinely can’t remember if she hit me anytime during this . Arguments with my dad go a little better when I’m at his house . He usually yells and threatens to do big things like throw coffee at me or his shoe , often only slaps me a couple times when I try to speak . I’m asking Reddit what should I do ?

# Characteristics Of French Roast

French roast coffee is **very dark**. It has a rich brown color. The beans look almost black. This darkness means a bold taste. **Light coffee**is not like this. French roast is different. It is strong and deep. Many people love this rich color. It makes the coffee look **strong and intense**.

The aroma is smoky. It is very unique. The scent is **bold and robust**. It fills the room quickly. Some say it smells like **burned wood**. Others think it smells spicy. This aroma makes people feel cozy. It is warm and inviting. Many find it comforting. The scent is a big part of its charm.

# Flavor Profile

French roast coffee is known for its strong taste. It has a rich bitterness that some people love. The acidity is lower than other coffees. This makes it smooth on the tongue.

The beans are roasted dark. This gives the coffee smoky undertones. Imagine a campfire with its deep, warm smell. That’s how this coffee feels in your mouth.

Despite its bitterness, there are hints of sweetness. You may notice caramel notes in each sip. These flavors balance the strong taste. It’s like a hidden treat in every cup.

# Comparisons With Other Roasts

Some time in the 2000s, society started to shift toward widescreen (16:9). At first I didn't like it, it was much more straining on the eyes, having to constantly look left and right, and not be able to see all the information in one go.

I said at first. But do I like them now? Well... no. I still feel the same about them as I did in the early 2000s. Whenever I look at a 4:3 aspect ratio screen, I feel instantly relaxed. I can see all the information I need without having to strain my eyes. I feel like someone has just brought me a nice warm coffee and put a blanket over my lap. I feel at home.

In fact, this goes deeper for me. It's symbolic of how society has become as a whole. Always looking for bigger and different. Never content. Always looking for the next shiny thing. Never satisfied with what we've got. But we've forgotten to enjoy simplicity.

I get to my closing shift today at 1:30, joke around with the openers and clock in, it's all good. I wonder where my shift coworker might be but I have orders so I just think they'll be late, 'cause they have been in the past. So by the time like four rolls around I've kinda given up on the fact that my coworker will come in, that's annoying of course but I can handle it. That's about the time when some pastry distributors come in and leave some of their wares. And so now I'm thinking that i need to put them away in the fridges. When I have a chance to do so I realize that the fridges are full and that I'll have to rearrange the hell out of everything so that everything fits. That's when I really start to get angry about my coworker not being there. Coffee orders I can handle, rushes i can handle. This sort of stuff is better done by more than one person and I can't do it all with ease so there I am making coffee after coffee after matcha after coffee while boxes of pastries hang out in the background waiting to be put away. Then at about six, my coworker frantically calls me, they're a gen z er, to call someone is against their nature, they then text me if I'm okay and that oh they forgot that they had a shift and they hadn't seen the schedule and ""oh do you want me to cover the rest of the shift?"" And by this point i'm tired and hungry and could use the time to rest and eat so I say yeah, sure. They even have the balls to say ""could you punch me in, i'm like five minutes away"". Then I lose track of time doing orders and finding space for pastries. Then I look at my phone again and there's a message saying that ""oh i don't think it'd be worth it to punch in when i'm only gonna work two hours"" I'm both flabber and gasted at the temerity of this and can only answer with a ""dude are you serious?"" And they reafirm the fact that they are serious. I just let it go because I had other stuff to do and when I had the time I screenshotted the conversation and sent it to the boss. I punched out at 9 when I'm usually done by eight sharp. Then when I got home my cat had puked on my bed. That was the real cherry on the top of an already shitty day.

Most of us spend more time planning a weekend trip than planning the work we’ll do for decades.
A career isn’t a single big decision—it’s a series of small, deliberate choices.
But how often do we stop and check if we’re actually moving toward a destination we want?

Here’s a simple Career Compass exercise you can try:
Grab a piece of paper and jot down honest answers to these 4 questions:
	1.What kind of work makes you lose track of time?
	2.Which problems in the world would you love to help solve?
	3.What type of people or culture bring out your best?
	4.What does “success” mean to you beyond money or job titles?

Then pick one small action you can take this month to move closer to those answers.
It might be exploring a new skill, setting up a coffee chat, or just researching a field you’ve been curious about.

Direction matters more than speed.
A small step on the right path beats running fast in the wrong one.

What about you?
Which of these four questions feels most important for where you are in your career right now?
I’d love to hear your thoughts or experiences.

However, the guy I am interested in suggested a coffee date for the second date after our first date which was at a bar (which was only at a bar due to timing and him canceling the original date which was coffee). I’m not concerned about him spending a minimum amount on me, but it feels like he’s being very low effort, hence why I rejected it and texted him on my feelings about it.

Here’s some context and I may or may not have discussed with him:

1) He said I’m the only one he’s dating, but I remember seeing a Hinge notification on his phone on the date (I didn’t bring it up).

2) While I agree my reaction is partly due to my experience of guys making elaborate lies when in reality they just wasn’t interested, but when he cancelled the original first date, it was due to an issue with the door at his home. He then suggested that I come over to his place or do another FaceTime with coffee. This made me feel like he just wants something casual and I wanted either reschedule or I’m not going to continue with him. But we did meet up for the only date so far, which was the bar.

3) After he suggested a coffee date for the second date, I made a suggestion for an activity that wasn’t expensive (it wasn’t cheap either, but later on during the day, I said it was only $30 per person since I saw it cheaper directly on the website and it was an activity based on something he liked), he then didn’t respond until I decided to cancel it since I did not hear back from him by a certain time today.

4) He then came clean about not being crazy about the price because of it being something he liked but not that much. So then I rip the band aid about how I felt he was being low effort. I sent a long message on the details saying the dates so far were low effort, that i didn’t mind the first date being low effort, and that it makes me feel like I’m only worth a small amount of money and time.

Anyways, long story short, I think I’m living in a prison instead of a home?? I can’t use my phone for more than an hour a day, I’m yelled at for playing one singular game—“It’s what’s making you aggressive and hateful!”—sir, ma’am, it’s a game about princesses and fashion 💀.

Also someone at school decided to lie to my counselor and say I was spreading sexual rumors even though it’s well-known that I’ve had traumatic experiences with rumors in the past? Yeah that happened. I also literally heard my mom scream at me saying she wished I was never born and that I’m only good for causing problems. I give up at this point, I’ve been living off of studying, coffee, excess melatonin, cutting, and memes for the past few days if I’m being totally honest 😀.

1nflq0o,https://www.reddit.com/r/folklore/comments/1nflq0o/la_sombra_loba_of_puerto_rico_written_by_me/,La Sombra loba of Puerto Rico written by me,"Long ago, in a quiet town tucked between the hills and forests of Puerto Rico, life was gentle. The coquí sang every night, and the children ran barefoot through the streets. And yet, as the elders always said:

“Even in the sweetest land, the darkest teeth may bite.”

The town did not know peace for long. For one day, a beast came. Not fully man, not fully wolf, but something in between. Eyes like fire, teeth like knives, claws that could tear both flesh and soul. They called it… the Wolf Demon.

No one knew from where it came. Some said it was a curse. Others whispered it was a spirit denied rest. But all knew it killed without mercy: children, women, men—no one was safe.

The elders spoke its name quietly: José.

José, they said, had once been kind, gentle, a man who loved animals more than anything. Birds, dogs, even the smallest insect—he tended them all. But one day, he ventured into the forest, and the forest claimed him. Wolves, or spirits, or some dark hunger—nobody could say. His family never came searching. They thought he had left. They forgot him.

And the townspeople soon learned that forgetting a kind man can awaken monsters.

They tried to stop it. They tried their guns, their knives, their prayers. Nothing worked. Nothing.

Then came Jesús. A man who did not tremble. A man who did not flee. The townsfolk whispered: “He walks with courage, or perhaps with madness.”

Jesús forged a sword from silver—the only thing that could harm the beast. And one night, when the Wolf Demon appeared in the square, dripping blood, eyes burning, claws ready, Jesús stepped forward.

“Beast,” he said, voice steady, “I give you one chance. Leave this town… or face me.”

The creature roared, a sound that shook the stones and froze hearts. It charged.

Silver met fur. Steel bit flesh. The townspeople cowered, hiding behind doors, their prayers trembling in the night. And all the while, the elders whispered:

“Even the fiercest storm can be faced, if courage shines brighter than fear.”

Blow after blow, strike after strike—they fought. Pain burned in the beast, but rage burned brighter. Claws swiped, teeth snapped, and still Jesús did not falter. Until, with one final swing, he cut the beast’s arm from its body. It collapsed, blood dark as coffee staining the cobblestones.

Jesús held the silver sword high. “If you are only a beast,” he said, “then this is your fate. But if a man remains inside you, a mind, a soul—then leave, and never return.”

The creature’s breathing shook the night. Its eyes, wild yet glimmering with something human, locked onto Jesús. Slowly, a clawed finger pointed at him, trembling.

And it spoke in Spanish, voice rough but familiar:

“No olvides… la deuda de la sangre.”
(“Do not forget… the debt of blood.”)

Then it turned, disappeared into the forest, swallowed by shadows and silence.

The town never forgot that night. They said sometimes you could hear a cry carried on the wind, half sorrow, half rage. And always, the elders would whisper:

“Remember the debt of blood. Remember the kindness that was forgotten. Remember the teeth that guard what men have lost.”

Years passed. Jesús grew old, gray, his hair like silver threads. He sat in his yard, watching the line of trees where the forest began. One warm evening, his granddaughter came running.

“Abuelo,” she asked, “why are you out here?”

Jesús smiled faintly, eyes fixed on the horizon. “I am admiring nature. You know… sometimes the most beautiful things… can hide the greatest fear.”

Her eyes widened. “You mean the wolf creature? The one you fought? Did you kill it?”

Jesús stayed quiet a long while. Then he said, voice low, calm, full of weight:

“No. Let’s just say… it’s never truly over.”

The girl followed his gaze. The trees whispered. A shadow moved. And for just a heartbeat, it seemed the forest itself held its breath.

Jesús’s hand tightened around the silver sword across his lap. Moonlight gleamed on its edge. His eyes never left the dark line of wilderness.

The elders say, to this day: the beast still roams, watching, waiting, and the debt of blood… is never forgotten.

And so the story is told, night after night, in every village, by every fire:

“Even in the sweetest land, the darkest teeth may bite. Courage may shine, but the forest remembers… and the debt of blood is never done.”

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Pumas UNAM vs. Mazatlán FC: A Clash of Claws and Coffee IV Drips**

The Liga MX Apertura 2025 returns from its FIFA break with a pivotal encounter: Pumas UNAM visiting Mazatlán FC at Estadio El Encanto. The stakes? Survival of the fittest in the Play-In race. Let’s dissect this with the precision of a surgeon and the humor of a stand-up comic who’s seen too many overtime matches.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Who’s the Favorite?

The bookmakers have spoken, and they’re as clear as a ref’s whistling in a penalty box. Pumas are the favorites across the board, with decimal odds hovering around **2.1** (implied probability: \~47.6%). Mazatlán, meanwhile, sits at **3.5** (\~28.6%), while the draw is priced at **3.3** (\~30.3%). Adjusting for vigorish, this suggests Pumas are the team to back—but not without caveats.

The key stat? **Pumas have never lost to Mazatlán in Liga MX history**, with six wins and five draws in 11 meetings. Recent form? Pumas have taken **nine points from their last three games** (all wins at El Encanto), while Mazatlán has just **one victory all season** (a 2-1 opener against Puebla). If you’re betting on Mazatlán, you might as well be betting on a sloth to win a sprint—adorable, but statistically improbable.

---

### News Digest: Key Players and Plot Twists

Pumas enter this clash with a five-game unbeaten streak, bolstered by stars like **Keylor Navas** (goalkeeper, former Real Madrid legend) and **Aaron Ramsey** (midfield maestro, still waiting for his “Mexican miracle” moment). The team is also rumored to be pursuing **Chimy Ávila**, a striker whose smile is as wide as his shot on goal.

Mazatlán? They’re the definition of a team “clawing” (*arañar*, as the article puts it) for relevance. With six poin

1nfleu7,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nfleu7/everyone_on_campus_sleepwalks_at_233_am_i/,Everyone on Campus Sleepwalks at 2:33 AM. I Followed Them to Find My Best Friend:,"Cambria never existed, that’s what they want you to believe.

But I watched her die.

Now they’re coming for me.

I might already be gone by the time you read this, but it doesn’t matter, I need to tell you the truth.


Cambria and I met during freshman orientation at Forester University, both pretending not to be scared.

She wore a Misfits shirt four sizes too big and duct tape around her boots — not for style, but to “hold the nightmares in” according to her.

We bonded over cheap coffee, obscure metal bands, and our mutual hatred of small talk.

Most nights we would put on some music and do our best impression of being rockstars or stay up late and watch horror movies together.

She and I would take turns reading Lovecraft and Ligotti stories in deadpan British accents to see who could make others laugh the hardest before bed. 

Cambria wasn’t just my best friend; she was the only person who ever made me feel like I mattered. So, when she disappeared, I knew something was horribly wrong.


The university claimed she’d gone home for a “family emergency” but the problem with that excuse was that Cambria didn’t have a family. 

She had no parents, no siblings…only me.

I called, I texted, and I even emailed her professors, but nothing ever came of it. 

Her student email? 

Gone. 

The login screen just said: “User not found.”

When I checked her dorm, someone else was living there — a girl who insisted she’d been there the whole semester.

I went to campus police, but they told me that if she went home due to a “family emergency”, there was no point in investigating. 

No one seemed to be that bothered by her disappearance and what was once hot gossip on university campus eventually quieted.

It was like she’d been surgically removed from the world — and my memory was next.


One night, I lay in bed, rereading the last text Cambria ever sent me repeatedly:

“I’m looking into something I found here on campus. I’m going under to fight it. If something happens to me don’t go looking.”

Was this about the sleep study she talked about signing up for on campus? 

I remembered her telling me about it once.

“I thought maybe they could help me shut the nightmares out for good.” 

That was her reasoning for participating.

We used to joke about our sleep paralysis demons like they were nothing more than late-night hallucinations.

But now? I’m not so sure.


A few weeks after she vanished, I saw them walk for the first time.

I remember waking up to the sounds of beds creaking — one after another, slowly.

All down the hallway in sync.

Confused, I crept to my door quietly and cracked it open to see students filing out of their rooms — maybe fifteen, maybe twenty — moving in complete silence.

Their eyes were half-lidded; arms limp at their sides. They had that eerie weightlessness you see in the movements of sleepwalkers — like the body’s running on instinct instead of thought.

Their footsteps clacked in a soft, dragging hush across the linoleum as I tried to process what exactly I was witnessing.

Jenny, one of the girls from down the hall, passed my door. 

Her lips moved, barely audible.

“Vel-kirash...”

It sounded like a breathy, nonsensical syllable…not like a word.

I wanted to step out and speak but I stood frozen in the dark, watching them walk in unison down the stairs until they disappeared into the dark…


The next morning, it was just like any other day on campus.

I casually asked around to see if I could get a better understanding of what I saw.

“Did you have any weird dreams last night?”

I received some blank stares, a few laughs, and a lot of questionable looks.

No one seemed to remember anything about the events of that night.

Everyone seemed to think I was the crazy one.

However, I did receive a lead from a random person on campus who told me to check out the campus sleep study. It was apparently Forester’s “best-kept secret”.


I searched the university archives and found the sleep study — sort of.

I found it tucked away under an archived projects folder in the psychology department. It was called, “The S.S.M. Protocol — “Sleep State Manipulation.” and it was supposedly terminated two years ago.

There were no names of any participants listed, but the folder was labeled “Group C.” 

I couldn’t shake the thought — C for Cambria?

The only name tied to the project was Dr. Isaac Trenholm, one of Cambria’s professors. 

His faculty page was gone.

The only result I could find was an old PDF titled: “On Induced Conscious Dissonance During REM Cycles.”

It was forty pages of dense medical jargon, but one paragraph stood out:

“In a guided hypnagogic state, the mind can be gently urged with the word “Vel-kirash” (translation: to hollow the vessel so the womb may be filled) to accommodate a second tenant. Dream entities cannot enter the waking world unless the mind is first emptied as it is only dangerous when paired with autonomy. A lucid mind can be a prison — or a doorway. We are simply…opening the door.“

There was that word again.

Vel-kirash. 

What was Dr. Trenholm talking about? 

What was he hoping to accomplish with this?

I thought about the text message Cambria sent me and how she could have known something was wrong with the sleep study. 

She didn’t just fall into this, she volunteered to go under to stop whatever it was they were doing. 

But it cost her everything.


That night, at 2:33 am, the beds creaked in a dreadful domino-like rhythm as the students got out of bed and began walking.

Instead of watching, I followed closely behind this time.

The procession moved past the quad toward the faculty buildings, their bare feet slapping softly against the pavement. 

My heart pounded as I mimicked their pace behind a tall boy from my statistics class. 

His head lolled slightly as he walked, his jaw slack as he whispered under his breath:

“Vel-kirash…vel-kirash…”

They stopped at a locked maintenance gate on the east side of campus. 

A student stepped forward and pressed her palm flat against the metal. 

The gate creaked open slowly and they walked inside.

I froze at the entrance,  the air seeping out was sour and carried a faint chemical sting that burned my nostrils.

One of the students turned her head towards me. Not all the way — just enough that her half-open eyes brushed over me. 

For the first time, I thought I saw recognition flicker there. 

“Vel…” she breathed.

My pulse spiked as I stepped back too quickly. I panicked and tripped over my own foot, the sound echoed, causing every head in the group to turn at once.

Their eyes glinted in the dim lamplight; dozens of slack faces locked onto me.

I bolted, my footsteps thudding across the concrete as I ran. 

Behind me, their murmurs swelled into a chorus of chanting. 

It chased me across the quad, growing louder even though I didn’t dare look back.

By the time I reached my dorm, the chanting had stopped — but I didn’t dare close my eyes.

I never took my eyes off the hallway the rest of the night.


I saw them walk three times before I followed. 

I told myself I was gathering information, but really, I was just afraid. 
 
I wasn’t ready to go where she went, not yet.

However, my mind was made up.

The longer I waited, the more I felt her slipping away, like the world was actively forgetting her.

I was terrified that if I waited too long, I wouldn’t even remember who I was trying to save.

That’s what motivated me to practice in my room until I could mimic the limp limbs and shallow breathing of the unconscious mind.

I practiced in the mirror, swaying with my eyes cracked just enough to see — until I couldn’t tell where pretending ended and becoming something hollow began.


At exactly 2:33 a.m., when they rose from their beds to sleepwalk, I slipped into the already full hallway and joined them.

No one looked at me.

We moved together, barefoot — a slow procession of blank faces through the dark.

Outside the campus, the air was dense like underwater pressure.

The lamplight didn’t stretch as far as it should’ve across the quad as we passed the fountain toward the old biology lab.

Its windows were boarded, and chains were wrapped around the doors where a “DO NOT ENTER” sign hung crooked, the red ink sun-bleached into pink.

One of the students in the front of the pack reached out and touched the chain.

There was no rattling, no snapping, it simply fell apart, causing the doors to swing open on their own.

Inside, we passed through narrow, decaying corridor as the doors shut behind us.

Fluorescent lights hummed and flickered overhead. One buzzed so violently it blew out — and stayed dark for a full minute.

In that darkness, I felt the breath of one of the students upon the back my neck.

When the light returned, the hallway was unchanged, but I couldn’t stop shaking.

Symbols covered the walls — spirals, slashes, intersecting circles. 
 
One had been scratched out violently, gouged deep into the plaster.

Then came the stairs.

A narrow, concrete stairwell slick with condensation and no railings led us down.

Every step echoed like we were walking inside a throat.

A flickering light above us died again, and in that moment of darkness, I heard a voice echo faintly from inside the pipes:

“Vel-kirash...”

The syllables bounced off the walls strangely. It was as if they were being spoken in reverse.

When the light came back, everyone continued walking without reaction.

The walls shifted gradually from cinderblock to smooth, cold stone as we traversed across the uneven floors.

And then...we reached the lab.

Or maybe it was never just a lab.

At the center of the room stood Cambria, her breath ragged. 

In front of her was Dr. Isaac Trenholm, chanting in a language that felt older than words.

She wasn’t restrained; she chose to be there.

Maybe she thought if she gave herself willingly, she could stop him from taking someone else.

But whatever she’d hoped to fight…was winning.

The others stood around with their eyes closed, not watching, but chanting.

Each word that escaped their lips tightened the noose around her heart.

The carved symbols on the walls pulsated a sickly green in time with their chants.

The thing inside Cambria was not merely emerging — it was consuming her from within.

Her lungs convulsed. 

Something slithered beneath the skin of her ribcage, pressing against her heart.

Spider silk like tendrils entwined with her blood vessels, siphoning the life from her body as she twitched involuntarily.

I watched through squinted eyes as her muscles spasmed in a desperate attempt to let out a scream that she couldn’t. 

She silently mouthed a desperate “help me” from her cracked lips.

I wanted to cry out her name and tell her I was there but instead, I watched in horror.

Her eyelids fluttered in anguish as something tore free.

Dr. Trenholm staggered forward as the cracking of Cambria’s skull filled the chamber, his face shining with sweat. 

His lips trembled with joy as the creature, slick with afterbirth, tore itself free.

Trenholm exhaled a sigh of relief as it emerged from her skull, its skin thin, translucent, and showing twitching veins.

Tears dripped from the corners of her eyes and down her cheeks as its limbs moved in all the wrong ways, jerking violently.

Her fingers twitched and curled into a fist, then opened like a flower wilting in fast-forward.

For a second, her eyes cleared — no longer glassy but wet with terror. 

She looked at me, mouthed my name — and for a moment, she was there. 

Then she was gone.

The creature’s mouth twisted into a terrible imitation of a smile, but it wasn’t a face built for warmth.

And then, a barely audible whisper:

“Don’t wake up...”

The words pierced me, a desperate plea, and a warning all at once.

The creature’s head snapped toward me with impossible speed.

Its vacant, half-formed eyes locked onto mine, and I felt a cold click inside my chest.

I couldn’t stop the scream.

“Get her!” Dr. Trenholm commanded, pointing at me.

I didn’t think, I just ran as fast as I could.

I sprinted through the dark, lungs burning, the air thick with blood and chemicals.  

Claws scraped against concrete behind me, gouging deep into the walls.  

Emergency lights flickered, casting warped shadows as I ran.

My chest tightened as the sound of footsteps dragging softly but deliberately just out of sight grew louder behind me.

All the students from earlier…they were hunting me as well.

I could hear the creature’s movements close behind. 

I turned to see its limbs dragging and then snapping forward unnaturally fast like watching stop-motion in real time.

It let out a wet, gurgling rattle as it pounced, its ice-cold claws grazed my shoulder.

I twisted away, my shirt ripping as I felt warm blood drip down my back.

The students were practically breathing down my neck but the adrenaline coursing through me wouldn’t let me stop.

A door ahead shimmered faintly and desperation made me sprint for it with everything I had. 

I slammed into it with all my weight and finally burst out into the cold night air. 

I kept running beneath flickering streetlamps that buzzed and sputtered like they were dying. 

Every step I took felt heavier, the world around me tilting just slightly off balance.

My heart hammered like a frantic drum as I collapsed onto the cracked sidewalk, gasping for air as I dared to look back. 

The building loomed behind me, its boarded windows like dead eyes.

Somewhere inside, the creature still waited.

I know the truth.

I know what I saw.

I never went back, and I’ve been running ever since.

I found her…and I failed her.

I wonder if she was still in there.

If her last feeling was pain… or if she was already gone — carved out, emptied like a house no one remembers living in.


It’s been a week now and I’m at a bus station three states away typing this.

My friends say they don’t remember me. 

Not just Cambria — me. 

One of them even asked who I was before hanging up.

Last night, at the motel I stayed at, I thought I saw someone standing across the street watching me.

I shut the blinds, locked the door, wedged a chair under the knob…and still, I heard it. 

At 2:33 a.m., the faint shuffle of bare feet against the floor…and a harsh whisper through the vent:

“Vel-kirash.”

I don’t know how much longer I can run before they take me back underground, before I forget why I was running at all.

If you’ve ever dreamed of stairs that only go down — don’t follow.

Please. 

For me. 

For Cambria.

 The steady hum of the jet's engine filled the luxurious cabin.
 Seated in the opulent, cream-leather chair, Marco Donato's fingers moved swiftly across the keys of his laptop.
 His eyes—dark grey—were locked on the screen, his expression sharp and focused.
 In his mid-twenties, Marco's entire presence radiated dominance. His tall, muscular physique filled the seat with an effortless grace, his black hair styled just enough to maintain a hint of messiness, giving him a charming look.
 The dim lighting of the jet’s interior cast sharp shadows across his face, emphasizing the stern line of his lips.
 He typed out a quick message to his family, and just then, the door to the cabin opened softly.
 Gino, his trusted right-hand man, entered. A hulking figure with an athletic build, Gino always bow to Marco, though he carried the strength of a man not easily intimidated.
 Gino bowed his head slightly in respect. ""Boss, is there anything you would like?""
 Marco didn’t look up. ""Just wine,"" he replied in a low, authoritative tone, his eyes never leaving the screen.
 Without another word, Gino nodded and exited the room, leaving Marco to return to his work. Minutes passed, the only sound being the quiet clicks of the keyboard and the occasional flick of Marco’s eyes as he reviewed his messages.
 Moments later, the cabin door opened again, this time revealing the hostess. Her figure was flawless, her uniform tailored to show off her curves.
 She carried a tray with a glass of fine red wine, approaching Marco slowly.
 The hostess leaned forward to set the glass on the table. The neckline of her blouse slipped down slightly, revealing a generous glimpse of her cleavage.
 Marco's eyes flicked toward her for a second.
 He saw the attempt—the practised seduction so many women tried around him—but he remained indifferent.
 His gaze shifted away immediately, showing not a hint of interest.
 With a subtle, dismissive wave of his hand, he gestured for her to leave.
 The hostess's face faltered for a brief moment, disappointment flickering in her eyes, but she quickly recovered her professional composure.
 She straightened up, flashed a forced smile, and exited the cabin.
 Alone once more, Marco took a brief sip of the wine, his focus still on the laptop. The message was ready.
 ""Landing in Ashwood City tomorrow. Be prepared.""
 He sent it, closing the laptop with a quiet click.
 Leaning back in his seat, Marco allowed a small smirk to curl his lips as he turned his gaze toward the jet window. The world outside was a blur of clouds and distant lights, but his mind was already in Ashwood City.
 ""Well,"" he murmured to himself, the smirk growing slightly, ""I'm back home... away from work and back to being surrounded by curvy beauties.""
 The anticipation of returning to the city, with all its familiar comforts and sexual temptations, stirred something within him.
 There were always people waiting—eager, desperate, or simply willing to do anything to gain his favour. And Marco liked being in control.
 He watched as the clouds below cleared, revealing the city’s twinkling lights in the distance.
 Ashwood was near. His smirk remained as he leaned forward to finish his wine. Thirty minutes until landing.
 And once he touched down, Ashwood City would be his playground once more.
 ---
 Outside the Shh... Café, Delilah stood outside, admiring the steady stream of customers who walked through the doors.
 The breeze rustled her long, auburn curls as she adjusted her leather jacket, a smirk playing on her lips.
 Her curves were effortlessly accentuated by her fitted jeans and low-cut top, her confidence evident in every step she took.
 Inside, the café was cosy, filled with the aroma of fresh coffee and pastries.
 The soft, cosy jazz music played in the background as patrons sipped their lattes and chatted in low murmurs.
 From the outside, it looked like any other popular café in Ashwood City. But Delilah knew better.
 Her deep hazel eyes scanned the room.
 Helen stood behind the counter, gracefully pouring an espresso shot into a cup while Ruby cleaned tables, her quick, playful smile drawing appreciative glances from some of the regulars.
 They were both stunning women in their own right, but it wasn't just their looks that made them stand out—it was their identities beneath the surface.
 Delilah's heels clicked softly against the wooden floor as she made her way inside, waving at a couple of familiar faces.
 ""Busy day,"" she said, her voice low but sweet as she passed Ruby.
 Ruby responded with a small smile.
 Meanwhile, Delilah continued walking until she reached the counter, then leaned casually against it, watching as more customers filtered in.
 Some were just there for a quiet cup of coffee, but others... others had a different reason for visiting.
 She waited until the café had settled into a slow rhythm before casually tapping a button hidden beneath the counter.
 A soft click echoed from behind one of the bookshelves, and with a low whirr, a section of the wall slid open, revealing a hidden passage.
 Without a word, Delilah motioned for Helen and Ruby to follow her.
 The three women stepped inside, and the wall closed behind them with a faint hiss.
 The hidden room was a stark contrast to the cosy atmosphere of the café.
 It was a large space filled with expensive weapons, training equipment, and sleek leather chairs that encircled a large table.
 The faint glow of fluorescent lights illuminated the walls, casting long shadows across the room.
 Delilah walked to the centre, her fingers trailing along the cool surface of the table. ""They come for the coffee,"" she began with a sly smile, ""but they stay for the service.""
 Helen crossed her arms and raised an eyebrow. ""And by 'service,' you mean...""
 ""Executions,"" Delilah said simply, her smile widening.
 Delilah had recently hired Helen for her experience working in cafés, but more importantly, for her secret identity as a renowned hacker.
 Delilah continued with her head held high, ""Most of our regulars are clients. They need someone taken care of, and that’s where we come in.""
 Ruby chuckled softly as she joined her. ""And to think people just assume we're running a quaint little café.""
 Helen glanced around the room, her expression unreadable for a moment as she processed everything.
 Then, with a slow nod, she relaxed her stance. ""I guess I'm in,"" she said, her voice steady. ""I’ve worked with worse.""
Chapter 2
 The aroma of freshly brewed coffee still lingered on Delilah’s clothes as she entered her small apartment.
 As soon as she stepped inside, the scent of something delicious hit her nose.
 She inhaled deeply, savoring the scent of spices and herbs that made her stomach growl with hunger.
 After a long day at the café, it was exactly what she needed.
 With a tired sigh, she dropped her bag lazily by the couch, her shoulders slumping in relief. She moved toward the kitchen, following the irresistible smell, already guessing who the culprit was.
 She rounded the corner into the kitchen, and found her aunt, Mary Flynn.
 Mary stood over the stove, stirring a pot of what smelled like her famous chicken stew.
 Her aunt’s graying hair, always tied back in a neat bun, gleamed under the kitchen lights.
 Despite her age, Aunt Mary had the energy of someone half her years and the warmest smile that could melt any stress away.
 Mary glanced up and smiled warmly when she saw Delilah. ""I knew you wouldn’t be cooking tonight, lazy girl,"" she teased, reaching up to peck Delilah on the cheek.
 Delilah chuckled, leaning into the kiss. ""You know me too well, Aunt Mary. I was going to cook… eventually.""
 Her aunt laughed heartily. ""If I left it to you, you’d starve yourself before getting a meal ready. Someone has to keep you fed!""
 Delilah grinned, unable to argue. She quickly washed her hands and moved to help. ""Okay, okay, I admit defeat. Let me at least help finish this up.""
 Together, they worked in comfortable silence, the only sounds in the kitchen being the bubbling stew and the clatter of dishes as Delilah set the table.
 After a few more minutes, they were done, and Delilah carried her plate to the dining room, her stomach rumbling in anticipation.
 They both sat down, the dining room filled with the smell of the delicious food.
 Delilah took a bite, humming in satisfaction as the flavors danced on her tongue. Aunt Mary’s cooking never disappointed.
 As they ate, Aunt Mary glanced at Delilah, a thoughtful look on her face. There was a pause before she spoke.
 ""Delilah, there’s something I need to tell you,"" she began, her tone gentle but serious.
 Delilah, mid-bite, glanced up curiously. ""Go on,"" she said, chewing on a piece of chicken, too lost in the delicious meal to sense the gravity of her aunt’s words.
 Mary smiled softly, then took a deep breath. ""I’ve found a suitor for you. A good match.""
 The words landed like a bombshell.
 Delilah froze, her spoon suspended in mid-air, eyes wide with shock.
 For a moment, it felt like the room had gone completely silent, as if the air itself had stilled in disbelief.
 ""A… suitor?"" Delilah repeated, her voice barely above a whisper, her mind racing.
 She hadn’t expected this.
 She glanced at Aunt Mary, who was watching her closely, waiting for a reaction.
 The very word, Suitor made Delilah’s stomach twist.
 ""He's a nice guy,"" Mary said, her voice warm and encouraging. ""And very handsome.""
 Delilah blinked and let out a small sigh, trying to collect her thoughts. ""Aunt Mary,"" she began slowly, ""I don’t think—""
 Mary interrupted, her expression shifting from playful to concerned. ""Delilah, I’ve noticed how you've been avoiding men. I understand after... everything."" Her voice trailed off, eyes clouded with memories.
 Delilah looked away.
 She knew her aunt was thinking of her parents' death and the awful events that followed—the men she’d dated who had proven to be untrustworthy, leaving scars deeper than she liked to admit.
 But not all men are like that, Mary believed. Not every man is like what you’ve faced, she wanted to say, but the words hung unspoken between them.
 ""I’ve been thinking about your future a lot, you know,"" Mary continued, her tone softening as she reached across the table to hold Delilah’s hand. ""With your parents gone, it’s fallen on me to make sure you’re looked after. I may not be around much longer myself.""
 Delilah’s head snapped up. ""Oh goodness, Aunt! Don’t talk like that. You’re not going to die of old age anytime soon."" She squeezed her aunt’s hand affectionately. ""You’re still young and full of life.""
 Mary chuckled, but the seriousness in her eyes didn’t waver. With a playful smack to Delilah’s hand, she added, ""If I’m so young, then hurry up and get married while I’m alive, rather than waiting until I’m gone.""
 Delilah sighed, shaking her head but smiling faintly. She knew how much Mary cared, but this wasn’t what she wanted—not now, not like this.
 ""You’re my only family, Delilah,"" Mary continued softly. ""I just want to know you’re happy and with someone who’ll take care of you. The suitor I found for you... well, his family has already approved. They think highly of you.""
 Delilah pulled her hand away gently, returning her focus to her food. She picked up her spoon again, hoping to steer the conversation elsewhere, but her aunt wasn’t letting this go.
 ""Aren’t you at least interested in knowing about him?"" Mary asked, her voice laced with curiosity.
 Delilah didn’t even look up. ""No.""
 Mary’s lips pressed into a thin line as she reached for her phone, pulling up something on the screen. ""Well, maybe seeing him will change your mind."" She turned the phone toward Delilah, showing a photo of the man she was talking about.
 Delilah’s instinct was to look away, to avoid whatever trap her aunt had set, but as her eyes caught a glimpse of the man in the photo, her heart did a strange flip.
 He was handsome—no, more than handsome. He was striking, the kind of man who could stop traffic with just one glance. His black hair was short but styled in that perfect, effortless way that suggested both discipline and rebellion.
 His deep, dark grey eyes, almost charcoal, stared back with an intensity that made her breath catch in her throat.
 There was something about his sharp, firm features, the coldness of his expression, and the athletic build that hinted at power and control.
 Delilah gulped, suddenly feeling uncomfortably warm.
 She quickly set down her spoon again, her appetite vanishing under the weight of the image before her.
 ""He was handsome four years ago,"" Mary said with a knowing smile, ""but he’s even more handsome now.""
 Delilah finished the last bite of her food hastily, her mind spinning.
 She picked up her plate, pushing back her chair as she stood. ""I’ll think about it,"" she muttered, heading for the kitchen.
 Behind her, Mary’s playful voice followed. ""Is that a yes?""
 Delilah paused, half-turning with a shrug. ""Maybe a yes.""
 She didn’t need to see her aunt’s face to know that her response had made her beam. Mary, ever the optimist, would take any sliver of hope and run with it.
 ""Thank the stars!"" Mary exclaimed, her voice light with happiness.
 Delilah escaped into the kitchen, setting her plate in the sink.
 Her hands gripped the edge of the counter as she took a deep breath, trying to regain control of her racing thoughts.
 The image of the man was etched in her mind, those deep grey eyes haunting her. She could feel her pulse thudding in her chest, the unwelcome flutter of attraction tightening her stomach.
 But no. This wasn’t happening. She wasn’t going to let herself fall into another situation where emotions clouded her judgment.
 She had no reason to trust anyone, let alone someone like him—handsome or not. She had dealt with enough to know better than to let herself get tangled in a mess of love, or worse, marriage.
 She had managed to avoid every suitor her aunt had thrown her way before, and she would do the same this time.
 Delilah wasn’t ready to give her heart to anyone, especially not someone who looked like they could break it without a second thought.
 With a firm nod to herself, she washed her plate and resolved not to be swayed, no matter how cold and calculating—and devastatingly handsome—he appeared to be.
Chapter 3
 Later that night, Delilah lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, unable to sleep.
 Every time she closed her eyes, the memories of her parents’ death resurfaced—flashes of their lifeless bodies, the sound of their voices silenced forever.
 She clenched her fists, trying to push the thoughts away, but they only grew louder in the silence of the night.
 Finally, she couldn’t take it anymore.
 She slid out of bed, grabbed her handbag, and made her way quietly toward the door.
 Delilah knew she had to be careful.
 Her aunt, Mary, was usually a light sleeper, but tonight, Delilah hoped she’d be resting deeply in her room.
 As she tiptoed through the hall, she paused when she saw the faint light coming from the living room.
 Heart racing, she peeked around the corner and saw Mary on the couch, snoring softly.
 ""Close call,"" she muttered to herself, quickly ducking into a nearby corner to stay out of sight.
 Delilah waited, holding her breath as Mary shifted slightly in her sleep.
 Once she was sure her aunt was in a deep slumber, Delilah made her move.
 Slowly, she edged toward the front door, careful not to make a sound.
 After what felt like an eternity, she slipped outside, the cool night air hitting her face as she quietly shut the door behind her.
 She walked quickly down the dimly lit streets, her destination clear.
 The club was a place where she could forget, if only for a few hours. It was her escape from the trauma that haunted her daily—the memories that refused to let go.
 The club, Eclipse, was tucked away in a part of the city where privacy was the norm, and nobody asked questions.
 The bouncer at the door gave her a familiar nod, and she returned it with a small smile.
 Inside, the air was thick with the scent of alcohol and the pulse of music.
 The atmosphere was electric, filled with people dancing, drinking, and letting loose.
 As Delilah walked through the crowded space, she exchanged a brief greeting with the club manager, a man she had known for years.
 He gave her a knowing look but didn’t say much, as always respecting her privacy.
 ""I’ll be in the dressing room,"" Delilah said in passing, her voice calm.
 In the dressing room, Delilah changed into her pole dancing outfit—a slinky, shimmering piece that clung to her curves and moved with her body.
 She added the final touch: a mask that hid her identity.
 At night, she became someone else entirely—someone confident and bold.
 By day, she was the owner of a small café and a skilled hit woman. By night, she was the sexy pole dancer who steals the spotlight.
 Once dressed, she stepped onto the stage, the lights dimmed just enough to create the perfect atmosphere.
 The music began, and Delilah moved with grace, her body swaying effortlessly around the pole.
 Men in the club were mesmerized, as always, unable to take their lustful gaze off her.
 Her movements were a distraction from the pain she carried, from the memories that plagued her.
 Among the crowd, a new presence entered—Marco Donato and his right-hand man, Gino.
 Marco had returned to the city early, lying to his family that he wouldn’t be back until the next day.
 He wanted one last night of fun before facing his responsibilities, and Eclipse was the perfect place for that.
 As Marco’s gaze landed on Delilah, his interest was immediately piqued.
 She moved with a confidence that caught his attention, her beauty and skill undeniable.
 Leaning back in his seat, Marco smirked and signaled to Gino, who approached him without hesitation.
 ""I want her for a private lap dance,"" Marco whispered, his eyes still locked on Delilah.
 Gino nodded and made his way over to the club manager.
 It didn’t take long for the message to be delivered—Marco Donato was a VIP, and no one in the club would dare refuse him.
 The manager quickly agreed, knowing full well what Marco was capable of if he didn’t get what he wanted.
 Delilah, unaware of the exchange, finished her performance and made her way back to the dressing room to change.
 She planned to slip out and return home before Mary noticed she was gone, just like she always did.
 But before she could leave, the club manager approached her.
 ""Delilah,"" he began, his voice a mix of urgency and hesitation, ""I need a favor.""
 She arched an eyebrow, already sensing where this was going. ""Not tonight, I’m heading home.""
 ""It’s important. This client… he’s a VIP. If we don’t keep him happy, he could bring the club down. Please.""
 Delilah sighed, crossing her arms over her chest. ""I’m not interested in doing lap dances tonight. You know that.""
 ""I know, but this is different,"" he pleaded. ""It’s someone important. You understand what that means, right? Just one lap dance. That’s all he’s asking for.""
 She narrowed her eyes, weighing her options.
 The club had been good to her, and she didn’t want to cause trouble, but she also didn’t like the idea of being pushed into something she wasn’t in the mood for.
 After a few moments of silence, she let out a long breath.
 ""Fine. One lap dance,"" Delilah finally agreed. ""But that’s it.""
 The manager breathed a sigh of relief. ""Thank you. I owe you one.""
 Delilah returned to the dressing room and changed into her lap dance outfit—a sleek, form-fitting number that highlighted her every curve.
 Once ready, she followed the manager to the private room where Marco waited.
 As she entered, her confidence remained firm.
 She had done this before, and she would do it again.
 This was just another dance, another night where she could forget the past—even if just for a moment.
 Then, the door clicked shut behind her, sealing her inside with Marco.
 The room was dimly lit, bathed in a soft, seductive glow.
 Marco sat comfortably on a plush leather chair, his eyes gleaming with anticipation. His gaze shifted from her masked face to the outfit that clung to her like a second skin.
 Delilah’s lap dance outfit was designed to turn heads—sleek and daring, made of black lace and leather.
 A plunging neckline revealed just enough to leave a man wanting more, while the corseted waist cinched her figure, emphasizing her hourglass silhouette.
 The fabric hugged her hips before giving way to thigh-high stockings held by garter straps, leaving her legs exposed, toned, and ready for the performance.
 The look was completed with high heels that clicked softly as she approached Marco, her mask hiding the emotions beneath her confident exterior.
 Marco’s eyes darkened with interest as he took in every detail.
 He had seen many women dance before, but something about this masked woman felt different—there was an air of mystery about her, a seductive presence that drew him in.
Chapter 4
 Delilah wasted no time. She moved slowly, circling Marco as if she were stalking a prey.
 The music playing softly in the background set the rhythm, but it was her own confidence that controlled the dance.
 Her hips swayed, her body moved fluidly, each motion designed to captivate. She leaned in, letting her hands gently graze his shoulders before pulling back just enough to tease.
 Marco watched her every move, mesmerized by the confidence in her technique. She was unlike any dancer he had encountered before—there was no hesitation, no doubt.
 She knew exactly what she was doing.
 Delilah didn’t need to rush. She took her time, letting the anticipation build, as her fingers traced along his chest and then drifted away, always keeping a careful distance.
 Her lap dance was flawless, a combination of smooth, sensual movements and calculated control.
 She bent forward, her chest grazing his face as her hands trailed down his arms, then smoothly straddled his lap without missing a beat.
 Her body rocked gently against him, her breath steady, and her movements perfectly timed with the pulse of the music.
 The air between them crackled with passion.
 He leaned back slightly, his eyes following her every motion, his hands itching to touch her, but knowing better than to disrupt the performance.
 There was a silent understanding between them—this was her show, and he was merely the spectator.
 Delilah let her hips move against him smoothly, her body arching as her hands slid down her own sides, teasing but never giving too much.
 Her masked face remained mysterious, but her confidence told Marco everything he needed to know—this woman was sexy.
 As the lap dance continued, Delilah’s moves grew bolder, her body pressing closer to his in slow, tantalizing rhythms.
 She expertly shifted her weight, leaning in just enough to feel the heat between them but never breaking the boundary she had silently established.
 She spun around, her back now against his chest as she moved, arching her spine as her hands ran through her own hair, enhancing the allure of the dance.
 Marco’s breath hitched, but he kept his composure, watching as she continued to move with a confidence that commanded the room.
 Afterwards, Delilah finished with a final, teasing swirl of her hips before standing up, leaving Marco still in his chair, his gaze following her every step.
 Without a word, she gave a small nod, signaling that the dance was over.
 She walked to the door, her heart steady, intending to leave the room. But just as her fingers brushed the door handle, she felt a sudden, firm grip on her wrist.
 In one swift motion, Marco yanked her backward, pulling her toward him. The force of the movement was strong, almost calculated.
 Delilah stumbled slightly, but she quickly regained her balance, her eyes narrowing behind the mask as she was brought face to face with Marco once more.
 There was no fear in her—only surprise, mixed with irritation.
 No one had ever dared to touch her without her permission.
 Marco’s dark eyes gleamed with something dangerous, something intrigued, as his hand reached up slowly.
 With a deliberate, almost teasing slowness, his fingers touched the edge of her mask, tracing the delicate material.
 His other hand still held her wrist, keeping her close. He leaned in slightly, his breath warm against her skin.
 Delilah’s heart raced, but she remained composed. She had been in worse situations than this.
 Still, she felt the heat of the moment, the tension between them intensifying. She met his gaze with a steady glare, daring him to continue.
 Then, with a single, fluid motion, Marco slipped the mask from her face.
 For the first time that night, Delilah’s identity was exposed. Her face, usually hidden, was now revealed to him.
 Her piercing eyes, high cheekbones, and full lips were framed by a cascade of auburn hair that tumbled down her shoulders.
 Marco's breath hitched for a moment as he took her in, his grip on her wrist loosening but not letting go.
 His expression shifted, as if he hadn’t expected the woman behind the mask to be quite this captivating.
 Delilah remained silent, her face now unreadable.
 She wasn’t the type to be easily rattled, but she couldn’t deny the ripple of something unfamiliar coursing through her.
 Marco leaned closer, his voice low, his lips curving into a smirk. ""I don’t know who you are,"" he said softly, his eyes never leaving hers, ""but I have a feeling we’ll be seeing each other again.""
 Delilah raised an eyebrow, her lips twitching with a hint of a smile—one that didn’t quite reach her eyes.
 Without a word, she yanked her wrist free from his hold, stepping back with her usual confidence.
 She didn’t need to respond to his comment. She had made it clear that she was not interested in seeing him again.
 She turned, walking toward the door again, her heart still steady.
 This time, Marco didn’t stop her. He simply watched as she exited the room, the door closing softly behind her. His gaze lingered on the door for a moment, before a dangerous glint flashed across his eyes.
 ""Gino,"" Marco called out, his voice cutting through the silence.
 The door opened almost immediately, and Gino stepped inside, his imposing frame filling the doorway.
 He looked at Marco, waiting for instructions.
 ""I want to know everything about that dancer."" Marco’s tone was sharp, leaving no room for doubt. ""Who she’s, where she’s from—everything.""
 Gino nodded, his expression unreadable. ""Understood.""
 Without another word, Gino turned and exited the room, closing the door quietly behind him.
 Marco leaned back in his chair, the smirk on his face growing wider. His hand drifted to his crotch, fingers brushing against the fabric of his pants, where a noticeable bulge had formed. Then, a wave of satisfaction rolled through him.
 ""She’ll be mine,"" he muttered to himself, his eyes narrowing with intent. She wasn’t just any ordinary dancer, and he would claim her, body, and soul.",1,1757728664.0,u_HeadWriting4825,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Oakland Athletics vs. Cincinnati Reds: A Tale of Two Teams, One Disastrous Commute**

The Oakland Athletics (-120) and Cincinnati Reds (+100) collide in a clash that’s as thrilling as watching a toddler play chess—everyone’s moving pieces, but nobody’s checkingmate. Let’s break this down with the statistical precision of a spreadsheet and the humor of a ballpark hotdog vendor who’s seen it all.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Math Class You Didn’t Sign Up For

First, the numbers. The Athletics, 67-80 on the season, are a team that’s mastered the art of *almost* good. Their .280 batting average in their last 10 games is respectable, but their 4.76 ERA? That’s the equivalent of a leaky faucet in a hurricane. J.T. Ginn (3-6, 4.95 ERA) takes the mound, a pitcher whose ERA is so high it could double as a coffee table for exhausted relievers.

The Reds, meanwhile, are 74-72 with a 3.91 ERA, and their starter, Brady Singer (13-9, 3.98 ERA), is a human metronome of consistency. His 8.7 strikeouts per nine innings? That’s the baseball version of a “Do Not Disturb” sign. The implied probabilities from the odds (Athletics: 54.5%, Reds: 50%) suggest the market sees Ginn’s woes as a problem only a 10-run over/under (set at even money) could solve.

### News Digest: Injuries, Power, and a Side of Whiffs

Oakland’s Jacob Wilson (.319 AVG, 12 HRs) is their offensive spark plug, but the A’s as a team are like a fireworks show with a dud fuse—lots of pop, but inconsistent ignition. Their 57-34 record in games with ≥8 hits proves they can dominate when they connect, but their 28th-ranked 4.82 ERA? That’s a door left unlocked for opposing lineups.

The Reds, however, are the anti-fireworks: steady, reliable, and slightly less likely to set your TV on fire. Elly De La Cruz (.266 AVG, 19 HRs) is their offensive engine, but their real secret weapon is their pitching staff, which ranks 14th in ERA and 10th in WHIP. Singer, with his circus-tent command (

ChatGPT
Memórias salvas cheias
Você disse:
Rufus said that would make.... Ta errado?
O ChatGPT disse:
A frase “Rufus said that would make...” pode estar correta ou não, dependendo do contexto, mas isoladamente ela parece incompleta. Vou detalhar:

Estrutura:

“Rufus said” → passado de “say”, está correto.

“that would make…” → “isso faria…”, também correto gramaticalmente.

Problema:

A frase termina em “make”, que normalmente precisa de um objeto ou complemento: “make sense”, “make a cake”, “make him happy”, etc.

Sozinha, sem complemento, a frase fica incompleta e não transmite a ideia completa.

✅ Exemplo correto e completo:

“Rufus said that would make sense.” → Rufus disse que isso faria sentido.

“Rufus said that would make him happy.” → Rufus disse que isso o deixaria feliz.

Se você quiser, posso te explicar quando usar “would make” versus “will make” em frases como essa, porque muita gente erra aí. Quer que eu faça?

Você disse:
Make some...
O ChatGPT disse:
Ah, agora entendi! Você está perguntando sobre a frase “make some…”. Novamente, ela não está errada, mas precisa de complemento para ficar completa.

Como funciona:
“Make” = fazer, criar, produzir.

“Some” = indica uma quantidade indefinida de algo.

Exemplo completo:

“Make some coffee.” → Faça um pouco de café.

“Make some noise.” → Faça barulho.

“Make some changes.” → Faça algumas mudanças.

Se você escrever só “make some”, a pessoa vai ficar esperando “make some what?” (fazer o quê?). É como deixar a frase no ar.

Se quiser, posso te dar uma lista das combinações mais comuns com “make some” para memorizar rápido e usar em inglês natural. Quer que eu faça?

Você disse:
Rufus said that would make some toothpast fir his mother.
O ChatGPT disse:
A frase que você escreveu:

“Rufus said that would make some toothpast fir his mother.”

tem alguns erros pequenos, mas a ideia é compreensível. Vamos corrigir passo a passo:

“toothpast” → deve ser “toothpaste” (com e no final).

“fir” → deve ser “for” (preposição correta).

A frase está no passado indireto, então está correta usar “would make”.

✅ Frase corrigida:
“Rufus said that would make some toothpaste for his mother.”

Se quiser, posso te explicar por que usamos “would make” aqui e não “will make”, porque muita gente se confunde. Quer que eu faça?

Me de um post para o reddit, comunidade da techreestart. Quero falar de como resolver dores de quem ganha pouco. O poste precisa ser iterativo, organico. Nao quero que vc use termos sintéticos e artificiais, use um linguajar profisdional de mentor, sendo um escritor. O poste precisa chamar a atenção e atrair pessoas para se interessar em migrar para TI. Nao precisa focar no questão idade 
O ChatGPT disse:
Beleza, vou estruturar o post no tom profissional, humano e envolvente, como se fosse você escrevendo diretamente para a comunidade. A ideia é trazer reflexão, autoridade e ao mesmo tempo criar interação orgânica. Aqui está uma sugestão:

Como sair da dor de ganhar pouco e recomeçar na tecnologia
Muita gente vive um ciclo que parece sem fim: trabalhar muito, receber pouco e ainda sentir que não tem perspectiva de crescimento. Essa é uma dor silenciosa que corrói a motivação. E a primeira reação costuma ser pensar que o problema é só o emprego ou o chefe. Mas, na verdade, é algo mais profundo: a falta de um caminho claro de evolução profissional.

A área de tecnologia vem se mostrando, ano após ano, um dos espaços mais abertos para quem busca crescer de forma consistente e ser valorizado pelo que sabe entregar. Não importa de onde você começa, mas sim como você se posiciona, o que você aprende e como aplica esse conhecimento. A diferença de salários entre áreas tradicionais e TI pode ser de múltiplos, não apenas porcentagem. E esse salto é justamente o que muda a vida de quem hoje sente o peso de trabalhar duro e ganhar pouco.

O ponto é: ninguém resolve essa dor da noite para o dia. É preciso foco, disciplina e estratégia. Mas é perfeitamente possível. Já vi pessoas saírem de empregos que mal pagavam as contas e, em poucos meses de preparo direcionado, estarem atuando em tecnologia, conquistando estabilidade e liberdade.

Quero abrir essa conversa aqui com vocês:
👉 O que mais pesa hoje na sua realidade de ganhar pouco?
👉 Você já pensou em migrar para tecnologia como alternativa real?
👉 Quais barreiras você enxerga no caminho?

Compartilha sua visão nos comentários. Muitas vezes, é no diálogo que surgem os primeiros passos de uma virada.

Quer que eu prepare também uma versão mais curta e impactante desse post, para ser usada como primeiro disparo (teste de engajamento), e essa versão longa você usa como follow-up?

Você disse:
Nao quero que vc voloque diretamente tecnologia no titulo. Desenvolver a história para mostrar a tecnologia no final. As vezes, so de ver esa palavra ja desistem
O ChatGPT disse:
Perfeito, entendi. A ideia é não espantar logo de cara quem tem resistência com a palavra “tecnologia”, mas sim conduzir a narrativa até que a pessoa perceba por si que TI pode ser o caminho. Aqui vai um post nesse estilo:

Quando o salário não acompanha o esforço
Existe uma dor comum a muita gente: trabalhar duro, dar o máximo todos os dias e, no fim do mês, ver que o salário mal cobre as contas. É como correr em uma esteira — você se cansa, mas não sai do lugar. Essa sensação mina a autoestima e cria a impressão de que não existe saída.

O problema é que muitas pessoas acabam se conformando. Aceitam que “é assim mesmo” e seguem no automático. Mas existe sempre uma escolha: continuar no mesmo ciclo ou buscar algo que abra novas possibilidades de crescimento e reconhecimento. Essa decisão nunca é fácil, mas é justamente ela que separa quem muda de vida de quem continua preso ao mesmo cenário.

Eu já vi histórias de pessoas que estavam nessa situação e decidiram buscar um caminho diferente. Não tinham vantagem financeira, nem tempo sobrando, mas encontraram um espaço de aprendizado acessível, construíram um novo conjunto de habilidades e, pouco a pouco, foram reposicionando suas carreiras. O resultado? Salários que multiplicaram em poucos meses e, mais importante, a sensação de estarem no controle da própria trajetória.

Esse espaço existe — é real, concreto e está crescendo todos os dias. Ele se chama tecnologia. Talvez você nunca tenha considerado de verdade, ou talvez até tenha pensado que “não é para você”. Mas o que posso afirmar é: com método, foco e acompanhamento, qualquer pessoa pode entrar e encontrar seu lugar.

👉 Quero saber: você sente hoje que o seu salário não faz jus ao seu esforço? O que você já pensou em fazer para mudar isso? Qual seu maior medo ao pensar em migração de carreira?

Hey! I've had some success here and am looking to give it another chance! About me I'm 30 and in central time. Usually on weekday afternoon, and evenings. Also on weekends all day. I'm chill, just someone looking to make really good connections with people over games or shared interests. I really appreciate people who share their own interesting experiences, no matter how large or small. I feel like as I get older, my opportunities to make really close connections is waning which is sad, but I'm hoping to make an effort to not let that happen. Maybe this just means the friends I make now are just that much better? One thing you'll find out about me is I tend to wax poetic.

I'm REALLY into the finals (lets STEAL that mfin cash)

overwatch, i can flex but do best at tank or damage!

looking to play more ffxiv (roll dailies with me? or shit lets just start new characters)

have been known to do a little trolling on valorant (i'm very low ELO, i play unranked)

peak (climber likes peak, water is wet)

will be picking up bf6

MINECRAFT (maybe ill invite you to my SMP server if we vibe!)

and am always looking for your suggestions. Truthfully, I've been playing so much finals lately if you have a suggestion for a game, I would gladly take it. I'm kind of at a point where I would really appreciate someone introducing me to a new game! I'm really into silly games, or games where I can be silly. If we get along and you wanna play farming sim and literally just farm potatoes, count me in.

Even if we don't game together, we can just hang on VC and coexist. Tell me about the books you're reading, your interests and passions. I'll tell you about my current fascinations like analog horror and 90s computing and technology aesthetic (uhh i can explain), non-fiction topics (lots of leftists propaganda), scifi, medieval fiction, and more. I love coffee, running, and climbing, and laughing at the most mundane shit. For some reason I really like unflattering front-facing pictures of animals, so if you wanna get on my good side that would be a safe bet!

All I ever wanted in life was to be loved. Someone to confide in, to trust—someone to share my feelings with and find a sense of peace. That was all I asked of the world: the chance to have that. But life had other plans. I was dealt the wrong hand, and I’ve spent years trying to play it.  

I shouldn’t blame the world or other people. Most of my struggles came from my own self-sabotage. Reaching out felt like climbing a mountain, small talk like navigating a minefield. Conversations never lasted beyond the briefest of pleasantries. I’d freeze, my words drying up, and the moment would slip away.  

All I wanted in life was to be loved.  

And for a while, I thought I’d finally found it. But I left something behind over there—something I know I’ll never get back. And something else followed me home.  

—

It started with a trip to Europe. After five gruelling years of law school, l'd stumbled into a job at one of the most cutthroat corporate firms-the kind where the paycheques numbed the soul-crushing hours. Will, my best friend, had been there two years already, a golden boy with a knack for charming clients and a salary that funded his taste for single malts and bougie clubs. He took me under his wing, teaching me the unspoken rules of""real law"": how to bill ruthlessly, schmooze judges, to understand and break the rules.

By the time we'd saved enough to fund this trip, we'd both become experts in burying ourselves in work...and little else. 

At the time, Europe sounded exciting. But as the departure date loomed, the idea of leaving home filled me with dread. I’d never been outside my hometown except for the occasional family event—and even those had stopped once I moved out.  

Will was different from me. He thrived on adventure, on new experiences. He had a charisma that drew people to him, a way of making even the most mundane conversations feel alive. I, on the other hand, was content to stay in the background, observing rather than participating.  

Somehow, we balanced each other out. I’d research the history and culture of a place, and he’d turn that knowledge into an unforgettable experience. It was a dynamic that worked, even if I often felt like the wet blanket of the pair.

We landed in London and spent weeks exploring the British Isles. We shared the driving and the costs, stayed in separate rooms whenever possible, and did practically everything together. Separate rooms were a necessity with Will—he had a knack for finding companionship wherever we went.  

I didn’t mind. He didn’t need my approval or encouragement. I was just happy for him. He tried to include me, of course, introducing me to women he thought I’d like. But every time, I’d freeze. The moment I opened my mouth, the conversation would fizzle out. ‘I’m good,’ I’d say, and that would be the end of it.  

I should have asked him to stop, but it made him happy to try. He always gave me the ‘first pass,’ as he called it, but they usually ended up with him. I didn’t mind. I was there to have a good time in my own way.  

After a heavy night of drinking, we made the flight over the channel and landed in the Netherlands. Once we were in our hotel sanctuary, Will suggested a detour. I was immediately suspicious. He’s always been spontaneous, but this felt different. There was a glint in his eye, a mischievousness that made me uneasy.  

By the time we found ourselves in Amsterdam’s Red Light District, it was too late to back out. The neon lights buzzed overhead, casting a garish glow over the narrow streets. Will was in his element, weaving through the crowd with effortless charm. I felt like an ice cube in a furnace.

I wanted to retreat to the safety of my hotel room, but Will wouldn’t let me. “No time like the present,” he cooed, slinging an arm around my shoulders in that familiar, reassuring gesture. “You just need a little confidence.”  

I cringed at the thought.  

The place was an assault on the senses. The bass from the music thrummed in my chest, each beat reverberating through my bones. The air was thick with the mingling scents of cologne, perfume, and the acrid tang of cigarettes and vape smoke. Sweat, alcohol, and something darker—something primal—hung in the air. The streets pulsed with life: tourists and locals, customers and vendors, all moving in a chaotic rhythm. And then there were the others—the men and women in the windows, their expressions calculating, their presence both alluring and unsettling.  

I wanted to run, to hide. This was too much for me. I turned to Will, my voice trembling. “We shouldn’t—”  

Will grinned, his arm still draped around me, and gestured with an open hand as if presenting an exhibit of carnal desires. “Take your pick,” he said, his tone light but insistent. “I’ll cover the cost.”  

“Will, I… I can’t.”  

“That’s not what you said last night.”  

My stomach churned. The night before reaching Amsterdam was hazy, blurred at the edges. But the throbbing, sickening ache in my head the next morning was all too clear.  

Will steered me further down the street, his grip firm but friendly. “You said it yourself—you just need to get your ‘cherry popped,’ and you’d get that little boost you’ve always needed.” He smiled, his eyes gleaming with mischief. “And I, for one, agree wholeheartedly. So here we are.”  

The protest died on my lips. He was right. He was always right. I’d never taken the steps others seemed to manage so effortlessly. All I wanted was a way forward, and here was my best friend, offering me exactly that.  

I hesitated, then finally smiled. The buzzing lights no longer felt oppressive; instead, they seemed to pulse with possibility. The assaulting scents faded into the background, replaced by a strange, newfound clarity. I took it all in once more, my resolve hardening.  

I let myself get swept up in the illusion. The women’s calculating stares lingered on me—cold, appraising—but I forced myself to believe they were glances of desire. Deep down, I knew it was transactional. They didn’t want me. But in that moment, I let myself pretend. I smothered the warning voice in my head and leaned into the heat rising in my chest, the liquid fire in my veins. The music, the smells, the dizzying lights—they all blurred into a single, intoxicating hum. For once, I didn’t fight the hunger I’d always buried.  

It felt… good.  

Then Will’s arm slipped off my shoulders, and reality crashed back in. My safety net was gone. I turned to see him already deep in conversation with a woman leaning in a doorway. She was striking, dressed in shimmering, barely-there clothing that glinted under the neon. My face burned at the brazenness of it all, but Will looked perfectly at ease, spinning some charming story as she bit her lip and laughed.  

Before I could protest, she tugged him towards a dimly lit doorway. He flashed me a grin over his shoulder, pressed a wad of notes into my hand, and mouthed, “On me.” Then he vanished inside, leaving me alone.  

The street was once again too bright, too loud. Beautiful bodies brushed past me, laughing, flirting, living. I stood frozen, the crumpled cash damp in my palm, feeling like a troll dragged blinking into daylight—ugly, out of place, and painfully seen.  

I began to wander the district, unmoored but oddly expectant. The loss of Will’s presence gnawed at me, yet curiosity bloomed in its place—a slow, creeping thing. The women in the windows watched me pass, their offers sharp and transactional, but I shook my head politely each time. I let myself stare though, feeding that fragile ember of excitement. When I lingered too long outside a bar or club, I forced myself onward. A rhythm took hold: walk, pause, observe, catalogue, repeat. Step by step, the district’s chaos began to feel almost… hypnotic.

Time blurred. Will’s absence should have worried me, but the rhythm numbed it. My earlier dread dissolved into complacency, as if the neon-lit streets had cast a spell. I wove through crowds with murmured apologies, my feet carrying me deeper into the labyrinth, until I stumbled upon a narrow alleyway at the district’s edge.  

And there she was.  

The most striking woman I’d ever seen.  

She stood tall—nearly six feet, just inches shorter than me—her posture poised and effortlessly elegant. Her jet-black hair was swept into an intricate pattern, strands catching the amber glow of the streetlights like threads of silk. Her face was a masterpiece: full lips painted a decadent red, cheekbones sculpted as if from marble, and eyes so dark they seemed to swallow the light around them. Her dress was simpler than the others-a sleek, plunging gown of midnight velvet that clung to her curves, shimmering faintly as she shifted, like starlight caught in ink.  

When our eyes met, hers softened. Not with pity, but with a warmth that felt exclusive, as if she’d been waiting for me alone.  

I drifted towards her, my senses flooding. Her perfume was intoxicating—jasmine and vanilla, spiced with something darker, richer, like aged cognac. It wrapped around me, warm and heavy, as she tilted her head in invitation. Her breath hitched, just slightly, as I stepped closer, and I caught the faintest flush on her collarbone. The fabric of her dress whispered against her skin as she shifted her weight, her hips curving in a way that felt both accidental and deliberate.  

“Hello,” I said, the word trembling.  

Her smile bloomed, bright and disarming. “A pleasure to meet you, Lieverd,” she purred, her Dutch accent softening the edges of her words into silk. She took my hand, her touch startlingly warm, and brushed her thumb over my knuckles. “I am Sable. And who has wandered into my little corner of the night?”  

“Sam,” I breathed.  

“Sam,” she repeated, my name a caress on her tongue. Her fingers circled my palm, slow and deliberate. “And what brings you to my doorstep, hm? The street is full of beautiful distractions tonight.”  

My throat tightened, but not from fear—from a rush of adrenaline, of possibility. “None of them… none of them are you madame.”  

Her laugh was low, musical. “Flatterer.” She leaned in, her scent deepening, and for a heartbeat, her lips grazed my ear. “Call me Sable. No need for madame—unless you’d like me to play the role?”  

I flushed, stammering an apology, but she squeezed my hand, anchoring me.  

“Don’t fret, Sam. Shyness is… refreshing.” Her gaze dropped to my lips, then back up, holding mine. “Tell me—are you looking for company tonight?”  

I nodded, wordless.  

“Good.” Her fingers laced with mine, tugging me gently towards the arched doorway behind her.

The club’s interior unfolded like a forgotten parlour from another century—opulent drapes, gilded mirrors tarnished with age, and the faintest trace of candle wax lingering in the air. Her heels clicked rhythmically against the wooden floor, each tap a metronome counting down to the fantasy I’d conjured in a thousand lonely nights. She glanced back, her smile a promise, and in that moment, I’d have followed her into hell itself.  

The clamour of the Red Light District dissolved as the door sealed behind us. My eyes clung to her—the sway of her hips, the way her gown caught the candlelight like liquid shadow. The room was small, intimate, dominated by a four-poster bed draped in burgundy silk. She turned the key in the lock with a soft click and my pulse thrummed in my ears.  

She sat me at the edge of the bed and knelt before me, her hand brushing my knee. “I can feel your desire, Lieverd,” she murmured, her voice a sweet caress. “But before I grant you the pleasure you seek, I must be certain you’re worthy of it. Can you afford to taste what I have to offer?”  

I fumbled for the cash Will had given me. My pockets were empty. Panic surged. “I—I don’t have it. I think… someone took it—”  

I looked down, shame burning through me like a fever. My legs twitched, desperate to bolt, to escape this folly. “I… I have to go. I’m sorry.”  

Her finger grazed my lips, silencing me. “Oh, Sam,” she murmured, her voice a velvet balm. “I know this is new for you. But I’m here to guide you. To ease you.”  

Her gaze held mine, steady and unflinching. There was no anger, no impatience—only a quiet, aching sympathy. She *saw* me. Saw the panic clawing at my chest, the fear tightening my throat. And she didn’t recoil. She understood.  

At that moment, I felt something I hadn’t in years: seen. Not judged. Not pitied. Just… seen. It was as if she’d peeled back every layer of my awkwardness, my self-doubt, and found something worth holding onto.  

Her hand lingered on my shoulder as she rose, her touch warm and grounding. “Lie down,” she said softly.  

I obeyed.  

She drifted to a mahogany cabinet, lighting candles as she went. The first flame caught the jasmine incense she’d set alight—thick, honeyed smoke pooling in the air. “You’re searching for something **Lieverd**,” she said, more to herself than me. From the cabinet, she withdrew a small carved box, its wood blackened with age. “Something *more* than this.”  

The lid creaked open. Inside lay a bronze bowl, its edges etched with symbols I couldn’t decipher, and a slender mallet. She placed the bowl beside the bed, the metal glinting dully. “Breathe deep.”  

I inhaled—jasmine, vanilla, the musk of her perfume—as she struck the bowl. A low, resonant hum flooded the room, vibrating in my ribs, my teeth. The sound coiled around me, pulling me deeper into the mattress.  

“Let it *take* you,” she whispered. Another strike, the tone sharper now. My limbs turned liquid, my thoughts syrupy. The candles blurred into halos, her silhouette a dark smudge against the gold.  

“Good,” she purred. A cool palm pressed to my forehead. “Now. Just let go.”  

The last thing I remember is her smile—tender, almost maternal—as the world dissolved into warmth. 

—

I awoke in my hotel bed, the sheets tangled around me. My head felt light, as if a vice I hadn’t noticed had finally loosened its grip. Exhilaration buzzed under my skin, electric and unfamiliar. Memories of the night before flooded back—soft whispers, the warmth of her body against mine, the way her hands had traced patterns I’d only dreamed of. Passion. Pleasure. Connection.  

Is this what it feels like?  

I fell back onto the pillows, a grin spreading across my face. For the first time in years, I felt… whole. The world seemed brighter, sharper, as if I’d been living in black and white until now.  

My phone buzzed on the nightstand. A single message from an unknown number:  

**“I hope you had a wonderful time, Lieverd.”**

My chest tightened. I wanted to reply, to thank her, to ask if I’d see her again—but I stopped myself. This wasn’t about her. Not really. Sable had been the spark, but the fire was mine. For the first time, I felt a flicker of confidence, a lightness in my step. She’d given me a glimpse of what I could be, and I wasn’t going to let that slip away.  

I wish I could have held onto that feeling, bottled it like a rare perfume. I wish I could have kept it close, a talisman against the grey monotony of my old life. But the light she’d ignited never burned as brightly ever again.  

—

The conversation with Will was a blur of backslaps and crude jokes. He congratulated me in that blokish way of his, grinning like we’d just won a bet. “Soon you’ll be pullin’ as much as me!” he crowed, jabbing my ribs. I cringed at his theatrics but let him revel in it. I spared him the details—to his disappointment—but he could tell I’d changed. My silence felt lighter, my posture less hunched.  

We were supposed to leave Amsterdam the next day, diving back into castles and museums. But the thought of it left me uneasy. I told myself it was just a break in our rhythm, but when I tried to replan our route, my fingers froze over the map. In the end, I surprised us both.  

“Let’s stay a few more days,” I said.  

Will blinked. “You want to stay?” He shrugged. “I’m down. There’s still cafés. Hookah bars. Plenty to see.”  

The words slipped out before I could stop them. “Or we could hit the Red Light again?”  

Will laughed, grabbing my head in a playful headlock. “Christ. You’re pussy-drunk, aren’t ya?”  

I flushed but didn’t deny it.  

He shrugged. “Look, there’s cheaper ways to get laid, but if you need the confidence boost…”  

“I’ll pay this time,” I said, sharper than I meant to. The truth about the stolen cash hovered on my tongue, but I swallowed it.  

Will studied me, then smirked. “All good, we’re here for fun.”  

—

That night, the district felt different. At first, I revelled in it—the garish neon, the bass thudding through the cobbles, the way the fog clung to the streetlamps like smoke. I let myself be swept up again, chasing that fleeting high. For a moment, it worked: the lights blurred into a kaleidoscope, the laughter of strangers fizzed like champagne in my veins, and I thought, ‘This is it. This is living.’ 

I let Will go on his merry way, slipping into the bright street alone. The air hummed with possibility, the pavement slick with rain and neon. I’m ready, I told myself, feigning confidence. But then, slowly, the cracks began to show.  

The music grew tinny, the neon too harsh—like stage lights peeling back a facade. The women and men in the windows still smiled, but their eyes glazed over me, their pitches rehearsed and hollow. One woman winked, her red lips curving into a perfect crescent, but it didn’t reach her eyes. Another man leaned against his doorway, muscles flexed, but his stare drifted past me to the next potential customer.  

My earlier excitement curdled. The district wasn’t alive—it was a machine, grinding through the same motions night after night. The smells turned cloying: stale beer, cheap perfume, sweat. Even the air felt thicker, pressing down on my chest.  

I tried to force it. I Lingered outside a club where a brunette in a sequined dress beckoned. Her laugh was too loud, her touch on my arm too practiced. “Come inside, handsome,” she purred, but the words rang flat.  

I pulled away, muttering an apology, and stumbled back into the street. The crowd jostled me, their voices sharp and grating. A tourist spilled his pint, the beer foaming over my shoes. Someone shoved past, yelling into their phone.  

First, the district had felt like an assault—neon claws raking my eyes, bass throbbing like a migraine, strangers’ laughter sharp as broken glass. I’d recoiled from its chaos, drowning in sensory noise.  

I then thought I understood this place. The garish lights became a beacon, the crowds a pulse I could ride. I’d returned chasing that high, convinced I could master the chaos, make it mine.  

Now? The illusion crumbled. The district wasn’t alive—it was a facsimile, a wind-up toy spinning in decay. The women’s smiles were chipped veneers, the men’s banter scripted and stale. Even the air reeked of desperation, cheap perfume masking rot. That ""magic"" I’d felt? It had never been here. 

It wasn’t like her.

My throat tightened. I fumbled for my phone, the screen glaring in the dark. Before I could second-guess myself, I typed:  

**“Are you there?”**

The reply came seconds later, as if she’d been waiting:  

**“You know where to find me.”**

I pushed through the crowd, shoulders hunched against the predatory stares, the hissed offers, the grasping hands. I was no longer prey—I had a purpose. When I broke free of the throng, she stood there, waiting.  

Sable.  

The sight of her hit me like a drug. The world sharpened, the noise dimmed, and everything clicked into place. She wore a gown of black lace, the fabric clinging to her curves, the neckline plunging to reveal the soft swell of her chest. Rain glinted in her hair, slicking it to her shoulders like ink. Her smile was a siren’s call.  

“Sam,” she breathed, and my knees buckled.  

I stumbled towards her, drunk on the sound of my own name. She turned, leading me inside without a word.  

The room was unchanged—candles flickering, jasmine incense thickening the air. I stared at the bed, my throat dry, pulse roaring. Behind me, the lock clicked.

“You’ve returned, Sam,” she said, her voice a purr. “But you know I can’t repeat our… arrangement without payment.”  

“I’ll pay!” I blurted, fumbling for my travel card. “For last night. For tonight.”  

Her gloved hand slid down my arm, warm even through the silk. She plucked the card from my trembling fingers. “Good, **Lieverd**.”  

The endearment liquefied me. I swayed, heat pooling in my chest.  

She pulled out the carved bowl once again and struck it, the tone reverberating the room and into me. I quivered at the sensation as she approached me again.

She cupped the back of my neck, her grip firm. “*Breathe*,” she commanded.  

I obeyed, inhaling jasmine, vanilla, her.

“Now,” she whispered, lips grazing my ear. “*Taste* me.”  

I fell into her, and the world dissolved.  

—

I awoke in my bed yet again. A swell of pride filled the hollow where Sable had drunk her fill. My body hummed with the ghost of her touch, every nerve still singing. The memories of the night swirled—slippery, fragmented. A gasp. A shudder. A moan. But when I tried to grasp them, they dissolved like smoke, leaving only her face: Sable, fully clothed, those red lips curved in a smile. Her voice lingered, a phantom whisper: ‘Think of me.’

And I did. 

But as the morning wore on, the glow faded. The memories felt like a dream half-remembered—edges blurred, colours bleached. The fuzzy blurring bled into my vision, the colours of the hotel room fainter than before. 

—

Will cornered me over my morning coffee, his brow furrowed. “You plotted the next stop yet?”  

“Not yet,” I said, too quickly. “We’ve only just arrived.”  

“Sam. We’ve been here five days.”  

The words landed like a punch. **Five days**? I’d have sworn it was two. Three, at most. My hands tightened around my mug. “That can’t be right.”  

Will’s laugh was brittle. “You serious? Did you smoke half of Amsterdam? I told you not to smoke too much.” His smile faltered at my silence. “You good Sam?”  

Smoke? The dread pooled in my gut, like ice-water trickling down my spine. But I forced a grin. “Midday. We’ll leave by midday.”  

He hesitated, then clapped my shoulder. “You tell me if… y’know. If anything’s off.”  

“Nothing’s off.”  

But as he left, the lie curdled. I pulled out my phone, thumb hovering over Sable’s number. The last message glared up at me:  

**“You know where to find me.”**

Outside, the rain began to fall—soft, relentless—and with it, the faintest whisper of jasmine lingered in the air.

I almost heard a whisper from the pattering on the window. “*Hello, Lieverd*.” 

—

I picked a destination at random, my thoughts syrupy and scattered. We packed haphazardly, then hauled our bags down to reception. The female concierge—bright-eyed, polished—smiled as we stepped off the lift. “Checking out?”  

Will leaned on the counter, launching into his usual flirtations. His voice grated—teeth clicking, lips smacking—like nails on a chalkboard. I clenched my jaw, fighting the urge to snap.  

“Will that be card or cash today, sir?” The concierge was staring at me, her smile strained.  

“Hm?”

“Cash or card?” She asked again.

I blinked, swearing that Will and her were mid conversation.

“Card.”  I mumbled in feign confidence.

I fumbled with my wallet, fingers trembling. My travel card felt heavier than usual. I tapped it against the machine, typed my PIN.  

\**Declined*.\*  

“Wrong account,” I muttered, I tried again.  

\**Declined*.\*  

“Perhaps another card?” she suggested, too politely.  

Will shouldered me aside. “Let me.” He slapped down his card.  

\**Approved*.\*  

The machine chirped cheerfully.  

“Enjoy the rest of your trip!”  

—

In the lift, Will eyed me. “Your account empty or somethin’?”  

“No. You didn’t need to do that. I had it.”

“Sam—”  

“I’ll pay you back!” The words came out shrill, echoing off the mirrored walls.  

Will raised his hands. “Alright. Chill.”  

The doors opened to the garage. Will dragged his suitcase out, the wheels screeching. I braced myself against the lift frame, my head swimming. The air smelled faintly of jasmine—or was it petrol? My knees buckled, but I caught myself, nails digging into the metal door.

By the time I reached the car, my shirt clung to me with a strange cold sweat. We drove out of Amsterdam in silence.

—

The drive was uneventful. Will tried to lighten the mood with his usual banter, but my responses were clipped, distant. He sensed the tension but didn’t press—just filled the silence with jokes and anecdotes. I let him talk, my mind elsewhere. Five days in Amsterdam. The thought gnawed at me. What had I done?  

When I finally asked Will, careful to keep my tone casual, he shrugged. “You seemed… different. Like you’d found your stride. You went out on your own, came back late. Honestly, I was proud of you. Breaking out of your shell and all that.”  

But there was a flicker of concern in his eyes.  

Later, I checked my travel account. The card had been locked—flagged for suspicious activity. My stomach dropped, but relief followed when I saw the balance. The funds were lower than I’d expected, but not drained.  

Then I scrolled through the transactions.  

Ten charges, all around €400. One double charge of €800. No meals, no souvenirs, no museums. Just a single, repeated payment to an unnamed account.  

I told Will about the discrepancy. “The bank flagged it as fraud. Must’ve been an online scam.”  

He frowned. “You sure? Wasn’t all that good ass you were probably buying?”

I suppressed an angry response.

“It’s fine,” I lied, avoiding his gaze. “They’ve unlocked the card now.”  

He didn’t push, but I caught the doubt in his silence.  I punctuated the end of the conversation with a notification that I transferred the funds for the hotel.

As we left Amsterdam behind, the landscape blurred into a monotony of lakes and canals. The beauty felt hollow, like a postcard I’d seen too many times. I reached for my phone, thumb hovering over the messenger app almost instinctively. My heart stuttered when I saw the unknown number.  

I typed:  

**“Hey.”**

The cursor blinked, mocking my hesitation. I added:  

**“How much did I spend with you?**”

The reply came faster than I expected.  

**“You certainly liked my company. It was quite a number of times.”**

I frowned.  

**“My memory is hazy. Did we do any drugs?”**

**“We did not. I only did as you purchased. I made you relaxed.”**

**“Then why is it so hard to remember?”**

**“My methods are… unique.”**

I stared at the screen, my mind racing. What had she done to me? I tried to claw back the memories—fragments of candlelight, her voice, her touch—but they slipped through my fingers like smoke.  

A tone suddenly rattled through me, vibrating deep in my chest, a pleasant hum that left my limbs heavy and my mind adrift. The scent of jasmine and vanilla flooded my senses, pulling me into a haze of elation. I blinked, disoriented, as the world sharpened back into focus. Will had stopped at a petrol station to fill up. I must’ve fallen asleep.  

I checked my phone. Another message waited.  

**“*****Lieverd*****, I help people unwind. Guide them into a state where their thoughts quiet, their bodies listen. It’s all about letting go, surrendering to what they truly need.”**

My stomach twisted. Below her message, a reply I didn’t remember sending:  

**“I see.”**

The conversation continued:  

**“If you’ve been dissatisfied with our sessions, I offer a partial refund. If you truly want it,Lieverd.”**

Another unrecognised reply:

**“No, it’s okay. Thank you, Sable.”**

**“Thank you,** ***Lieverd***\*\*.”\*\*

The panic that had gripped me moments ago melted away. That name-*Lieverd*\-sent a shiver of warmth through me. I couldn’t help but smile, my earlier fears suddenly forgotten.  

The car door swung open, jolting me from my thoughts. Will slid into the driver’s seat, tossing a bag of crisps into my lap. “Ready to go, sleepyhead?”  

I looked outside and saw Will had definitely finished fuelling up. I nodded and laid back in my seat, suddenly desperate for the sense of calm I just lost.

—

I lay awake in my hotel room, staring at the ceiling, the dim glow of the bedside lamp casting restless shadows along the walls. Through the thin partition, I heard it again—a soft, breathy sound of pleasure. Will’s room. Another conquest. Another night of indulgence.

I exhaled sharply and rolled over, seeking some refuge from the indecency unfolding just a few feet away. But there was no escape—not from the sounds, not from the thoughts creeping in at the edges of my mind. I reached for the pillow, pressing it over my ears, but it did little to drown out the reminder of what I was missing. Or worse, what I wanted.

A thought tickled the edges of my mind. Just one simple message—that’s all it would take.

No. She wouldn’t do that. She was busy with other clients.

I tried to shut out the voice urging me to try, to give in.

But before I could silence the impulse, my phone was already in my hand, a message sent.

**“Hey, I know it’s late and you’re probably busy, but can we talk?”**

I waited, shaking my head at the stupidity of it.

Then—message read. My body tensed.

The typing bubbles began to bounce. My grip tightened around the phone as if it were a lifeline.

Her reply came.

**“What is it,** ***Lieverd***\*\*?”\*\*

My pulse quickened. **“I know it’s stupid, but… can you send me a photo of your beautiful face? Just so I can remember you?”**

Message read. The knot in my stomach pulled tighter.

A long, agonising pause. My leg twitched, restless.

The bubbles danced again. I held my breath.

And then, there she was.

Her sculpted face filled the black void of my phone, framed by waves of perfect hair. Her narrow eyes, dark with unspoken promises, seemed to draw me in, daring me to press my lips against hers. Her mouth hung open slightly, teeth grazing her lower lip, leaving the faintest imprint of pleasure.

Slowly, my eyes drifted downward.

The gentle rise of her chest, the soft swell of flesh teased by the low-cut dress. Shadows played across her skin, hinting at what lay just beyond sight—just out of reach.

My excitement grew.

**“Beautiful as ever, Sable. But… I’m lonely tonight. Can I see more?”**

The wait was longer this time, time itself stretching, taunting me. I stared at the blinking cursor, anticipation curling around my ribs.

Had I been too bold? Did I sound desperate? Was I just a creep?

The thoughts piled on themselves, turning excitement into gnawing anxiety. The knot twisted tighter, my breath coming in shallow gasps.

Then—her reply.

A link.

**PayPal.**

**“I only ask for a small donation, Lieverd. Then you may see what you desire.”**

My mind wrestled with the implications, the unspoken transaction. But as I read her message again, the fear, the doubt—all of it melted away. A slow, familiar exhilaration replaced it, spreading like warmth through my veins.

**“Must I? I only ask for one picture.”**

**“If you truly desire it. Yes.”**

A new image appeared.

Statuesque beauty.

The scandalous curve of her dress hugging every perfect line, her body pressed into pleasing shapes, the soft swell of her flesh offering silent invitation. One hand rested just below the fabric’s edge, suggestive—an unopened door to something forbidden.

My breath caught. My lips parted unconsciously.

I scrolled up. My thumb hovered over the link.

And I clicked.

—

I woke at dawn, tangled in sweat-damp sheets, my clothes strewn like roadkill across the floor. The air was thick with the scent of shame and stale arousal.

But as I dressed, hands trembling, I couldn’t suppress the grin.

The memory of her photos burned brighter than reason.

I scrolled back through the messages. A blur of text filled my vision—lines and lines of words I didn’t remember writing. My pulse quickened as I searched for what truly mattered. The images. The proof. The treasures I had been given.

But they were gone.

Nowhere in the wall of text.

Panic crept in. I switched to my photos, my fingers unsteady. Nothing. No trace of her, except for a single picture—her face, smiling, serene.

No. That wasn’t right. I had them. I *saw* them.

I flipped back to the messages, my desperation mounting. Had she deleted them? Had I? Was this some kind of mistake?

I scrolled faster, my breath quick and shallow, the vivid memory of her body already slipping away. The warmth, the shape of her, the invitation in her pose—it was dissolving, like a dream upon waking. The more I tried to grasp it, the more it faded, crumbling to dust in my mind.

Then, at the very top of the screen, I froze.

The unknown number had a name now.

**Your Love—Sable.**

I stared at it, my skin crawling with something nameless before forming into a loving caress. I wanted to type, to beg for the pictures back, to ask her what was happening. My thumbs hovered over the keyboard, but my breath hitched as my eyes caught her final message.

**“Sleep well,** ***Lieverd***\*\*.”\*\*

A smile consumed me, I drifted into the feeling.

“Hey!”

Will’s voice yanked me back into the present, and I gasped, blinking hard. The phone screen blurred before me. My grip was slick with sweat.

*What?*

The thought hit like a slap. I wasn’t in my hotel room. I was in a car.

Will was staring at me, frowning. “Yes?” I managed, my voice hoarse.

“Am I turning here or not?”

“Turning…?” The word barely made sense.

“Yeah, navigator,” he said, impatient. “What’s the map say?”

I stared out the window, my stomach twisting. The road stretched ahead into the unknown, endless and empty. The buildings were unfamiliar. The street signs meant nothing.

I didn’t know where we were.

I didn’t know how I got here.

The panic gripped me, cold and merciless. I swallowed hard, forcing out an answer.

“Left.”

Will nodded, flicking on the indicator. “Alright then.”

The car turned.

And I had no idea where we were going.",2,1757727512.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke.

1nfkwyt,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1nfkwyt/thinking_about_transferring_my_phd/,Thinking About Transferring my PhD,"Hey! I’m 23, from the US, doing a PhD in biomedical engineering in Australia. 

The deal looked amazing at first: I can finish in 3 years, build something with my advisor and then spin it out (AI for CPR(for paramedics and laypeople)), and I’d have a PhD by 26.

 I have a super chill supervisor who likes me, and the best funded project in the lab. Idea was: graduate, spin out the tech, then move back to the States for startups/medtech leadership.

BUT, after getting here it’s not what I thought:
1. The project isn’t in the field I actually want (I’m way more into neurotech).
2. Nobody in my lab has startup or neurotech experience.
3. Uni isn’t a target school, so it’s hard to find ambitious cofounders.
4. Honestly, I don’t feel passionate enough about this project to commit 5+ years without stalling my career (small market, lots of regulatory)
5. I don’t get as much equity as I thought. 

I have a couple options:
	1.	I got in & deferred UCSD to F26. I’d finish the year here, then transfer & build non-invasive neurotech there. Way better network, cofounders, VC, etc. I’d finish this year here, then transfer. 
But, would have to pay out of pocket, and don’t get PhD. 
	2.	Transfer to a better Australian uni (accept year-round & can do PhD in just 3 years, already have visa), find a neurotech advisor, and build something more aligned. But take a risk on advisor & would have to start all over, find grants etc. 
	3.	Just finish my PhD where I am, network well online (at least having 2-5 coffee chats/week). Find an external supervisor with neurotech startup experience who wants to join. Pivot the project to something more neurotech.

Any advice? How much am I missing out by not going to a top university? How valuable is having a PhD for medtech startups?",1,1757727276.0,PhD,0,1.0,False

Previously: I was very sick about two weeks ago. I had tested negative for Covid but all the symptoms matched up. Extreme tonsillitis and pharyngitis, UR congestion, fatigue, headache, all the works. Some near syncope (ringing ears, lightheadedness, blurry vision), tachycardia, and hot flashes showed up as my other symptoms faded. This is while doing basic tasks like climbing stairs or washing dishes. I’ve had these new symptoms on and off ever since and have been having severe reactions to caffeine. I had a moment at work where an energy drink made me feel plain end-of-the-world ill, all I could do was sit and stare at a fixed spot and take careful breaths. 

Currently: Last night I had a weird moment where I felt very lightheaded and off. I had dull chest pain in the center, was woozy, couldn’t think straight, headache. I tried to hydrate and eat, but afterward it progressed into more chest pain, shortness of breath, cold sweat, palpitations. I’m no stranger to panic attacks, but this did not feel like one at all. I’ve coached myself through more of them than I can count, and this was entirely different. I almost asked my dad to take me to the ER. I did some square breathing and after another 30 minutes of hell everything but the headache and chest ache went. Drove home. 

Today I was still fairly intolerant to my morning coffee. I had an episode of palpitations and shortness of breath. My chest pain is now in one little spot, upper right. It’s slight when I’m just breathing but sharper when I swallow or burp. It feels like the circulation in my hands is poorer, but that could’ve been the cold on the unit today. 

Family background: History of heart disease/ attacks from maternal grandmother. 
My mother is still being treated for micro-clots all over her body caused by long covid. Unrelatedly, she just told me she had been diagnosed with mitral valve prolapse at my age, but they had dismissed it as a misdiagnosis later in her life when her symptoms subsided. 
My cousin was recently hospitalized twice. First time her PCP found a saddle PE, and that ER visit led to first thrombectomy due to clots clogging her entire calf. It ended up refilling and she had to have a second thrombectomy. 

What should I do? My PCP’s appointments got messed up so I’m expecting a call back tomorrow. I had shortness of breath and palpitations when I had diagnosed Covid years ago, but not in weird episodes like this. Lung inflammation? Cardiovascular concern? Pure hypochondria?

I’m 33, based in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne, and also happy to meet around the CBD or Geelong. By profession I’m an engineer and photographer, and I also do photo editing. Photography is a big part of my life—I love capturing moments and creating memories. Outside of work, I enjoy sport shooting, exploring new places, and going for drives. I’d describe myself as romantic, caring, and someone who genuinely invests time and energy to make people around me feel happy. I’m in a healing phase after separation, so I value kindness, good energy, and authentic connections.

Physically, I’m of 175 height and average build, well-presented, and active. I can share more details and photos once we connect.

What I’m Looking For
I’m open to meeting women of different  backgrounds, though I do find myself especially drawn to white women and blondes. That said, personality, warmth, and a good vibe mean more to me than looks alone. I’m open to friendships, casual outings, or something that could grow into a long-term relationship if we connect deeply. Ideally, I’d love to meet up in person—coffee, a photoshoot, a drive, or a casual day out.

What I Offer
If you’re looking for someone thoughtful, romantic, and genuine, that’s me. I bring creativity through photography (happy to do professional or casual shoots for you), adventure through drives and day trips, and consistency through time, energy, and effort to keep you smiling. I’m also grounded, responsible, and fun to be around, so you can expect a mix of stability and excitement.

I'm one of those people who doesn't ever say anything - it's just coffee, it's not gonna ruin my day - but I started wondering if the problem is that I have a complicated order that is too much of a PITA to make as ordered. I usually get this:

Iced Shaken Espresso:
Grande, blonde
No classic
1 pump pumpkin sauce
4 shots
Light pecan cold cream
Light cinnamon

Usually I can taste the Signature espresso pretty clearly (but sometimes I didn't think I'm getting the 4 shots, either), and I think I got oat milk a few times? This is a very high volume store in a large city, so this is about as complicated as I get. 

I usually order 15-20 minutes early from the train. 9x/10 any food I may have ordered is (no longer warm) ready and the drink is usually not. I'll sometimes ask the barista to please check if someone else picked it up, or if it's in queue. But a lot of time time, even though I order ahead by a good margin - more than the amount of time the app says I need - I usually end up walking through the store, clocking no drink, and going in to the office for a bit before I can get back to Starbucks.

Indeed. *(to self in low tone)* Maybe a little too much. \**pause and awkward throat sounds\** Ah, however there are a few discrepancies within your application. For instance, it said that you are train in Q-Cell and PhotoSnap? *\*Pause\** You fail to mention which version you are trained in on your resume though. *\*Pause\** Oh, 2020s version…there been at least 2 reversions out since then, but that can be overlook somewhat. You said you are a fast learner, so if hired that skill would be put to the test right away. *\*flips though papers sounds\**

Your most recent job work that you have written down, states that you’ve had 10 years’ experience of working with school children, correct? So I’m assuming you where a teacher before coming here? *\*pause\** Oh, a substitute stand in. *\*pause\** I’m not quite familiar with that lingo, what exactly is that? *\*pause\** Oh so, basically like a babysitter without the pay but more responsibility. *\*chuckles\** I understand. At least you have the qualifications time management, along with CPR should the need present itself here. *\*flipping sounds\** Mmmm hmm, that looks good, that is nice.

However the most concerning piece in your resume is this gap.

*\*Pause\**

Oh, you took a break to take care of a sick relative? How **very** noble of you. *\*pause\** Oh, I’m sorry to hear that. Mmm, yes well.  As you can see, it’s quite a big gap however. *\*flips papers.\** Yes, Yes, I’m sure.

I can see from your education piece you look good on paper but I’m sorry, \*chuckles\* you see, I’m not interested in hiring some errand boy if you will. If I wanted to hire you to get me my morning coffee you wouldn’t be sitting there staring at me, and you would already have my drink in your hand, handing it to me already. (\*to self\* *Among other things*.)

Mmm, well, I guess all that is left of this interview is to ask if you have any questions for me Miss. Smith? \*short pause\* Oh that’s an interesting one. We are the leading firm here and we are hoping to make changes in the way of thinking for the future and better the quality of life for everyone. That is the goal here at Mr. Jerkins and Sons. Might you have any other questions for me? *\*pause*\* Oh well,  as much as I would like to do charity work, we are not that type of work, and to be honest before I even became the head of this company I would have  been just as desperate as countless others before you with the other difference being that I’m sitting in this spot and not that one, Miss. Smith. So no, I do not think that we here at Mr. Jerkins and Sons would be a good fit for that.

Any other questions you would like to ask ? No. Well. *\*typing sounds\** I do thank you for your time I do believe we will give you a call in a couple of days. You can see yourself out now. *\*pause\** I said you can see yourself out, unless you have something else to discuss with me.

*\*footsteps and typing sounds fade out/ spilt here if adding NSFW piece\**

1nfknfk,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1nfknfk/my_coworker_always_leaves_helpful_notes/,My coworker always leaves “helpful notes”,"There is a woman in my office who has made sticky notes her entire personality. She does not talk to people directly. She does not send emails. She does not walk up and say, “Hey, can we chat about this?” Instead, she communicates exclusively through neon squares of paper.

And they are never nice reminders. They are always loaded with judgment.

“Please remember to clean up after using the microwave. Some of us care about hygiene.”

“Don’t forget to cc the right people next time. It saves me a lot of trouble.”

“Your stapler is too loud. Please be mindful.”

Every single one ends with a smiley face, as if that erases the sting.

At first, we thought it was quirky. Then it became constant. I once came back from lunch to find a note stuck to my monitor that said, “Your screen is too bright and it is distracting me.” This woman sits on the other side of the room. She had to physically stand up, walk across the office, and place that note on my computer instead of simply saying something out loud.

She has left notes on the fridge, on the microwave, on the coffee pot, on people’s chairs, even once on a coworker’s lunch bag that said, “Please don’t bring strong smelling food. It makes the office unpleasant.”

The wildest one was when she left a note taped to the bathroom mirror that said, “Some of us would appreciate it if you flushed more thoroughly.” Nobody admitted to being the target but we all knew she had crossed a line.

Our manager refuses to step in. He says things like, “At least she’s detail oriented” and “Better than her bottling it up.” Meanwhile the rest of us are stuck in a silent war zone where every brightly colored square feels like an accusation.

It is exhausting. I am half-tempted to start leaving sticky notes on her desk that say things like, “Please stop being unbearable. :)”

I think my coworker confuses Post-it notes with communication and somehow makes a stack of paper squares more stressful than a performance review.",202,1757726479.0,TrueOffMyChest,82,0.98,False

If you’re patient, kind, and a little cheeky, I’ll probably find you way too distracting in the best way possible.",1,1757726097.0,IntrovertDating,4,1.0,False
1nfkhsc,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1nfkhsc/is_it_stupid_that_i_still_feel_bad_after_my/,is it stupid that i still feel bad after my boyfriend (18M) of two years made me (18F) feel dumb on a womens day?,"i feel so stupid writing this but i guess i just need to let it off my chest because ive never talked about it with anyone. so this years national womens day was on saturday and my boyfriend of two years (hes my first boyfriend and im his first girlfriend) asked me on monday if id like to go to the cinema with him. and when i tell you i was literally the happiest girl in this whole world... the excitement came from the fact that somewhere deep i always dreamed of like typical date when i dont need to worry about anything expect how i look, it can be stupid but idk as a girl it was my dream since always. and even tho weve been together for a while we never actually been on a real date before and i kinda get it because he live in a small town where theres nothing much to do (but im ngl even stupid coffee just because would be nice but whatever) and i live a quite minute from him (something about 20 km) but we both got drivers license last year and i really never expected too much but i just thought that now he got chance to do something nice. yeah and anyway... he told me to chose the movie and i was a little bit like ehhh... but okay he wants me to be satisfied with it or something i wont complain about some stupid fact. so i asked him in which one cinema because theres a few nearby us. he told me that he thought about one from the nearest three, so i chose one from those he said, it was the only place where they played flow at the time which was the movie i was really courious about because im a little bit keen on movies. he responded with ""okay"" and we never spoke about that again. the whole day and whole week i was thinking only about saturday and how excited i am because trust me, i really was. then finally, the saturday arrived... he told me that he can pick me up and drive me off later what was very nice of him. i was getting ready and i felt just so special, i couldnt stop smiling and i was so excited. i actually didnt remember the last time that i got THAT excited. and i felt so, like, girly you know, like oh my god im getting ready to go on my first  DATE with my manly boyfriend!!! so i did my makeup more pricesely, i put on some cute skirt with equally sweet top, i even did my hair what i dont usually do. and yeah, he drove to my place, he gave my mom flowers(!!!) and i felt like the luckiest girl on this planet. he parked at his place because we both needed to use the bathroom and he told me that we should buy something to drink and he offered a walk to the store instead of the car. and i thought it was so cute and also i thought that we were about to go to one of the supermarkets that was more near his home but no. we started walking to the one that was a more away than the others. and i started to get a little bit nervous if we will be there on time but i really didnt want to think about anything that much at the time. and after a while, when we got our drinks and walked out of the shop, the movie was supposed to start in about 15 minutes, mind you that we still needed to go back to the car(which was about 20 minutes walk) and drive there for about 25 minutes what was especially weird because my boyfriend really DESPITES being late anywhere... and with that thought the light bulb went on. i realised that we actually arent going anywhere. and with every single step on our way back i was more and more just dissappointed. we came back and he saw that something was wrong but when he asked whats the matter i just couldnt say anything because i just felt so stupid. we went to his room and i asked him are we going anywhere and if no if he could give me some of his clothes so i could change. so i did and then we started watching something but i dont really remember what because i couldnt stop thinking about this whole situation. i was so miserable tbh. and i asked him if we will watch the flow one day together which he replied sure. and after that i asked him just of the curiosity why we didnt eventually go to the cinema as he said and he told me that hes not quite sure but it was a little bit far and maybe we should have gone. and if i remember that correctly i told him all right but he could just at least say that we arent going and he was something like you thought that we are going? and i was like yes?? and he started apologizing so much and he even started crying actually pretty hard and i just felt so bad for him. and he really looked like he cared at the moment. and he told me that he was so sorry for all of that and he feels ashamed what i really saw. i saw that he needed to calm down so we sat for some time and then we cuddled because i really tried to comfort him

and im not upset with the fact that i havent seen this movies but at the fact that he didnt even tried to do anything even a little bit special on this day, he didnt plan anything. idk cinema is not working out for you? of course no problem we can do something different. 

and i dont know... its been months but sometimes i still think about this day especially when i cant sleep. and believe me i really dont look that much at the money because the only thing that matters to me is the effort but i know that lets just say that he has good financial situation and money is not a problem but he still couldnt do anything? even me with no money always made sure to make him special even on normal days. and i really saw that he was ashamed but i doesnt change how stupid i felt and still feel when i think about this. maybe if i didnt care that much i wouldnt be so dissappointed but as i said i really dreamed of something like that. and he was quite surprised that i thought we were going? what was supposed to make me think that we arent going? im aware of how stupid it can everything sound for some people but it made me really sad and dissappointed because he could just say that. sometimes i think i expect too much from other people and maybe my standards are too high but i just wanted to feel special on my day.

i think i just needed to tell someone about this as i said in the beggining but how do you feel about this situation? how can i stop thinking about this? do you think my expectations are too high? im aware that maybe i should talk with him about this but i just would feel stulid bringing it up randomly after 6 months. and i keep in mind fact that its our first relationship and we need to learn ourselfs all the time but sometimes i feel hes hearing but not listening to me.",0,1757726036.0,relationship_advice,8,0.43,False
1nfkhqu,https://www.reddit.com/r/sunheadprime/comments/1nfkhqu/night_moves_1_of_2/,Night Moves (1 of 2),"“It’s going to happen, Jack. Nothing we can do about it. The wheels are already in motion. Higher-ups tell me I need to release the staff by the end of the week.”

“Then ‘AM 640 - Talk of the Town’ becomes what, exactly?”

Ron sighed. “Another DJ-less, auto-programmed, adult easy listening station.” 

“Aww, Christ on a bike,” I said. “They’re stealing the soul of this industry. Our Arbitron numbers grew last ratings cycle.”

“Late stage capitalism at its finest,” he said, leaning back in his chair. It squeaked as if it had something to add. “All the companies are cutting costs. Dying industry and all.”

“Feel like I’m surrounded by death these days.”

Ron leaned forward on his elbows. With a deep breath, he started speaking in a quiet, measured tone. “When I was knee high to a grasshopper, had an old boss named Terrence ‘Dials’ Pullman. Man used to drop pearls of wisdom like a clam Santa Claus. The lesson that always stuck with me was, ‘When the Chief calls for war, the braves grab their hatchets,’” he said with a sigh. “Chief BrightStar Radio called for war. I’m just grabbing my hatchet.”

I slumped. My mind raced. I’d just renewed the lease on my apartment, for God’s sake! I passed up a job in Santa Fe last month because I had a good feeling about this gig. Now? Now I was about to be another unemployed radio DJ. Worse, an unemployed DJ lacking a massive, loyal audience to support his transition into a podcast host.

“Wanna smoke? I know you gave ‘em up, but….”

“Yes,” I said without hesitation. I’d given them up about a year ago to help save my golden pipes. If I were going to be the voice of Night Moves Radio, the local, overnight call-in show for the Valley, I felt like it was important to treat my instrument better than I had in the past. What a waste.

Despite the no-smoking signs throughout the station, Ron knocked out two Marlboro Reds, tossed me one, and offered a light. The return of smoke to my body was not welcome. The first puff made my mouth tingle, and that sent a message to the rest of my body that a smoke attack was incoming. I started hacking instantly.

I remembered why I’d quit these.

“That’s your good sense fighting your worst instincts,” Ron said. 

“Me all over,” I said, hacking in between each word. “Can I tell the audience?”

Ron exhaled a cloud of smoke. I watched it float up and dissipate as it hit the nicotine-stained ceiling. Obviously, this wasn’t his first office smoking session. “Gotta keep it under our hat for now. I know it ain’t easy, but as a personal favor to me, can you pick up your hatchet?”

I nodded, took one last cough-fueled pull before putting the butt out on the bottom of my shoe. A powerful desire to leave the office seized me. Despite knowing it wasn’t his call, Ron had just laid me off. If I hung around, I was liable to make an unpleasant situation worse.

Ron sensed it. “Sorry to be the bearer of shit news, Jack. I hate it too.”

“Still gotta grab that hatchet, right?”

He pointed his smoke at me and shot me a small smile. “Attaboy.”

As soon as the door closed behind me, I threw up two middle fingers and mouthed a string of phrases not fit for public consumption. Or so I thought. While I stood there, mouthing a curse into the wild, I heard a shoe squeak behind me.

“You feeling okay, Jack?”

It was Manny, our vending machine guy. There was no way he didn’t see me just silently lose my shit. I plastered on a smile and turned to face him. “Manny! How goes the wonderful world of vending?”

“Same shit, bro. Seriously though, you good?”

“Office drama. You know how that goes.”

“Hell yeah, I do. Charlie, this dude at my job, is always pissing me off. It’s like, if you don’t want someone eating your food, put your name on the bag, bro. Whatever. He’s got bigger issues than that,” Manny said, miming injecting a needle into his arm. “He left, like two weeks ago, and ain’t come back.”

“Common in your industry?”

“Strange shit happens all the time in this job. Some dudes can’t hang. Like, check this out. Last week, I stopped to grab a Slurpee, and I heard this guy….”

“Manny, your nose is bleeding,” I interrupted. He touched his face and rolled his eyes. I handed him a tissue.

“Third time tonight, man.”

“Must be the dry air,” I said, glancing at the clock. “I’ve gotta run. Feel better, man!”

I left Manny and made my way to the studio. The place wasn’t much to look at, but it felt lived in. These walls looked jaundiced. The carpet was gritty in spots. There was an odd funk we couldn’t air out. But it was home. In the middle of the room sat two consoles where my amazing and loyal producer Daphne and I worked. Off in the corner was a small booth where our intern sat and screened calls.

Daphne saw my face and instantly knew. She was livid. Hell, I’d never seen her angrier. “Did Ron give you the whole chief/brave thing?” With my positive response, she rolled her eyes. “Such bullshit. You know he’s keeping his job, right? Actually, he’s getting a small pay bump.”

I placed my piping hot coffee mug near the console. “Everything’s coming up Milhouse for him, huh?”

Daphne didn’t hear me. The mug held her attention. If I had a dime for every time she “gently reminded” me not to put my coffee mug near the equipment, I wouldn’t have to worry about losing this job. I removed my mug, leaving only a faint brown ring of coffee where it once stood. Without asking, she handed me a paper towel.

“How did you find out about Ron’s raise?”

“Cathy in HR is a horrible gossip. Plus, I confirmed it online. BrightStar is doing this to twenty-five AM stations across the country.”

“On the plus side, we’re on the cutting edge of modern radio strategy,” I said, cleaning up my little mess. “AI is going to make the world a better place, ya know?”

“AI can eat my ass,” Daphne said.

“I think it’s programmed not to do those sorts of things.”

“That’s why it’ll never take off,” she said in a huff. “Uneaten asses.”

A nerve-breaking burst of high-pitched static shot out from the speakers in the studio. I jumped and nearly dropped my coffee. Daphne would’ve killed me. She slapped the speaker with her palm, and the noise stopped. The jolt not only hurt her hand but also caused the overhead lights to strobe for a few seconds before they stilled.

“You okay?”

“Fine. I’d cut this hand off if it’d save this place. I don’t have a backup plan, Jack.”

“Outside of selling tasteful foot pics, I don’t either.”

“To continue this depressing news streak, how do you want to handle today’s show? I have a killer suggestion that might just bring out the weirdos tonight.”

Call-in shows are notorious for crank callers. Crackpots are a dedicated bunch. We keep a blacklist of people who’ve burned us. Most of the time, it’s racists or edge-lords. Ollie, our fabulous intern, has gotten fantastic at catching dog whistles in the pre-screenings. 

They’d come to us about two months ago and instantly became integral to the running of the show. Ollie dreamed of being an on-air talent and was willing to do the grunt work to get there. I was hoping we’d be able to hire them for the show post-school. Barring a miracle, that wouldn’t be happening now. I hate the modern world.

“Let’s let the weirdos have the run of things tonight,” I said. “You have any red meat for them?”

“Boy, do I,” Daphne asked. “But you sure? We’ve had some unhinged callers lately. Something in the air, maybe.”

“More unhinged than normal?”

“Way more than normal, boss,” Ollie said, walking into the room. “One guy swears he’s a werewolf sent here by God to rid the world of stray cats and Belgian people. He also hates trans people. Mentions it every call…then tells me I have a sweet voice.”

“Is trans hatred part of his godly mission, too?”

“That seems to be more of a personal belief than a mission from God. He saves his true ire for ‘those filthy waffle eaters. ’”

“The other night, a caller told me there are clues on how the world’s going to end hidden on the back of cereal boxes,” Daphne said.

“Oh, Frank?” Ollie said, their face beaming. “He’s nice, but I think he has a vendetta against Cap’n Crunch for some reason.”

“Maybe the good Cap’n got promoted over him,” I offered. 

“Story as old as time. Cap’n got to sail on the SS Guppy and Frank got nothing,” Ollie said. Based on our confused glances, they filled us in. “The SS Guppy is Cap’n Crunch’s ship. Fun fact, he sails the Milk Sea, his first mate is Seadog, and his rival is barefoot pirate Jean LaFoote.”

“How do you know all of this?” Daphne asked, dumbfounded.

Ollie shrugged. “ADHD, a love of cereal lore, and unlimited internet access as a kid.”

I laughed. “I needed that.”

“Did you need it because of the whole, ya know,” Ollie dragged their thumb across their neck. I nodded. Ollie sighed. “I heard earlier. Sucks a big dong.”

“A freakishly huge one. Ripley’s level huge. ‘Feel-it-in-your-lungs’ huge.” Ollie and I both gave Daphne a sideways look. She shrugged. “Am I wrong here?”

“No, but give me the name of the ‘lungs’ dude,” Ollie joked.

I glanced up at the clock. It was game time. “Screw it. Tonight, we let the freak flags fly.”

“Ron won’t be mad?” Ollie asked.

“What is he going to do? Fire us?”

“Hell yeah,” Daphne said. “Let’s get crazy. I have a hot story that’ll bring’em out, too.”

“Hands in,” I said, getting everyone to do our pre-show huddle. “We’re bruised, we’re battered, and we’re going to be unemployed in a week, but we’re good people. Let’s do the best show we can tonight. Night Moves on three - one, two, three.”

“Night moves,” we all said in unison before splintering off to get started with the broadcast. 

I took my seat and heard the sultry voice of Bob Seger starting off the show. I placed my cans on, cleared my throat, and leaned into the microphone, waiting for Daphne’s signal. After a beat, she pointed at me.

“It’s eleven o’clock in the Valley that never sleeps. It’s time for Night Moves with Jack Mann. I’m here to guide you down this dark path, past the witching hour, and on to the moment the sun’s first rays catch our eyes. Hope you had a good day, but good days make for bad radio, so let’s hear some gripes, concerns, stories, and scares. Daphne, how are things in your neck of the woods this evening?”

“Hanging in there.”

“Best we can do in these uncertain times.”

“That said, Jack, do I have a wild story to share with you tonight.”

“Love it. Hit me,” I said.

“The other day, I was browsing Reddit, and found a local legend that I thought might be fun to kick us off.”

“This is from Reddit, people, so take it with a grain of salt.”

“The saltiest of salts,” Daphne said. “But have you heard about the South Street Wanderer?”

“I have not. Ollie?” I said, glancing at them. Ollie shrugged their shoulders. “Zero for two on us knowing about the South Street Wanderer, Daph.”

“It’s the Valley’s own local ghost legend. Apparently, all along South Street, people report seeing a figure lurking in the shadows at all hours of the day. It doesn’t hide, but it avoids people…until it doesn’t.” Daphne played a “shocking music” sting to underline her tale. 

I chuckled. “What happens then?”

“Promises to warn you about a potential future disaster…IF you spread the word about the encounter. I don’t know how he keeps track, though.”

“So, he hides from people unless they agree to be his hype man?”

“It would seem so.”

“Why would he want that?”

“His mixtape ain’t gonna sell itself, Jack,” Ollie said, an assassin sniping a joke from the mic we kept in the call screening room.

“Phones don’t answer themselves, Ollie,” Daphne said. As she did, the lights in the studio flickered but stayed on. Given our run of luck, the power going out and us not being able to broadcast would be par for the course. Thankfully, something out there loved us, because the power stayed flowing.

“I liked it, Ollie,” I said, nodding to the call screen booth.

“I have to admit that the Wanderer’s mixtape is fire. Not a coincidence, considering that people complain about burning sensations after they speak with him.”

“Wait, what?” I asked. “He gave them an STD?”

“Didn’t read that, thank God. People report that after hearing their predictions, they sometimes get a burning sensation in their chest. Others say they get a pain like an electric shock. A few have mentioned getting days-long headaches, oozing rashes, violent nosebleeds, and nightmares.”

“Not ideal, but who wouldn’t exchange a migraine for future safety? And honestly, is there anything worse than a rash?” I asked.

“The other reported effects are bleeding from pores, coma, and death.”

I waited a beat. “Still not as bad as itchy skin, right?”

Daphne laughed. “I’d rather itch than bleed from my eyes or, ya know, die. A coma, though, sounds nice. Coma dreams have to be wild. A brain free from the waking world might produce some interesting insights.”

“Maybe how to make radio more lucrative,” I said. Daphne grinned and shot me a look. I was out of fucks to give. 

The lights above us flickered once more. Again, the power held. I looked at Daphne, who shrugged. She started jotting something down and held up a pad of paper with her message: BrightStar already not paying the power bill? 

I stifled a laugh. “So, Valley dwellers, have any of you interacted with the South Street Wanderer? Know someone who has? Hell, if you are the South Street Wanderer and want to tell your side of the story, we’re ready to hear you out.”

“But don’t give us any predictions. My skin is already in awful shape, can’t add bloody pores to the equation.”

A few seconds later, the phone calls started coming in. Ollie, ready to go forward with the weirdos, was quickly talking to callers and jotting down brief messages for both Daphne and me to see. On my screen, it read: “Line 1: Joe saw s.s.w. at 7-11.” I glanced over at Ollie, who was grinning from ear to ear.

“Oh, we’ve got a live one here. Joe on line one says he saw the South Street Wanderer getting a Slurpee at 7-Eleven. Did I get that right, Joe?”

We all waited for Joe to speak up. When noise started coming from the other end of the phone, it was heavy breathing. All of us have been in this game long enough to have a good guess about what this guy was up to. Typically, we hang up. Today? Today we’re gonna ride it out.

“Joe, sounds like you have your hands full.”

“Sorry, sorry,” came a panicked-sounding voice on the other end. “I’m out walking my dogs. But yeah, I saw that guy at 7-Eleven, like two days ago. Well, outside the 7-Eleven. On South Street and Washington.”

“What was he doing?” Daphne asked.

“Hiding on the side of the building.”

“He wasn’t getting a Big Bite hot dog?”

“No,” Joe said with a slight chuckle. “At first, I thought he was a homeless dude. There’s usually a few guys there asking for cigarettes. They’re harmless. The thing I saw, though, made my blood run cold.”

“Why?”

Joe sighed. “Something felt off. He was in the shadows, but the area directly around him was like, like, darker than the rest of the night. And there was a fog around him. Almost like he was standing in a storm cloud.”

“What was he doing?”

“Watching. Not just my actions, but also my thoughts. My memories. He was…Biscuit! No! Drop it! Sorry, my dog got into some trash.”

“So it was an eerie vibe or….”

“I mean, yes, but more than that. I could feel him in my brain. Not physically, but supernaturally. Felt like he was trying to get my attention without speaking.”

“Thank God he wasn’t in your mind, Jack,” Daphne joked. 

“God has no home there,” I said.

“It’s not a joke,” Joe said, his voice firm. “Especially when I heard a voice I didn’t recognize inside my brain.”

“I’ve had that before. Recently, actually,” Daphne said. “You sure it wasn’t your conscience playing tricks on you?”

“No,” Joe said definitively. “I know it sounds crazy, but he was there. I heard another voice that wasn’t mine. And I wasn’t even drunk or high.”

“What was the voice saying?” I asked as I jotted down a note on a notepad. I flashed it to Daphne. It read: This going somewhere?? She nodded ‘yes’ and I let the man ramble.

“It was all gibberish at first. Like spinning a radio dial, looking for the right station.”

“AM 640, the voice of the Valley,” I expertly chimed in.

“Right,” Joe said, nervously laughing, “just half words, foreign words, blips and beeps until it found the right sounds and delivered the message.” 

“Which was?”

“He asked if I wanted to know the future. Without thinking, I said ‘sure’. Like you said earlier, Jack, why pass up that chance?”

“Great minds think alike,” I said.

“He just kept repeating the same thing. ‘No survivors.’”

“Cryptic,” I said.

“I had a flight to catch the next day. After I heard that, well, I canceled it.”

“Wait, a random voice in your mind made you cancel a plane flight? Aren’t you worried about the cost of changing plans?” Daphne asked.

“Of course,” Joe said. “Who can honestly afford that? But, like, when something weird gives you a sign, take it. My life is worth more than a plane ticket, ya know what I mean?”

“What happened to the flight?”

“Engine failure. Had to land right after takeoff. Everyone was okay, but I know in my bones if I had been on the plane, it would’ve crashed.”

Ollie started waving their hands to get my attention. I glanced down at the call screen. “Joe, hold on. We have another person who swears they saw this thing at the 7-Eleven, too. Greg? You there?”

“Bro, bro, bro, this guy is spitting the truth! This thing is always hanging out there.”

“Really?” I said, my internal bullshit detector going off. “You’ve seen this too?”

“Bro, this thing flippin’ loves taquitos.”

There it was. A crank call. I knew it was coming. We all did. “What flavor taquito?”

“Uh, ya know, regu… I love you, Emily Sanders! Flip-flop flu!” Greg said before the sound of a phone hanging up.

“Taquito flavors always trip up the weirdos,” I said.

“This isn’t a joke,” Joe spat. “This thing is real. It gets inside you and, like, hacks your brain. Sometimes, I’ll hear a voice that isn’t mine. See things that aren’t in the room. It, like, uses me now. It sees and hears through me. He’s probably using me now to get to you. To your audience.”

That thought chilled me. My week was already shitty. I didn’t need to add “becoming a ghost figure’s personal camera” to the list. I didn’t believe Joe, but the man spoke with such conviction that it gave me pause. Looking at Daphne’s face, she agreed. Cementing that opinion, she again hit the shocking music sting.

I held back my laughter. From inside their call screening room, Ollie did not. Their guffaws didn’t come across on the air, but the general feeling did. 

This guy was full of it.

“Let’s hope that’s not the case,” I said. “Does he have any messages for us?”

“You don’t want me to answer that,” Joe said. “People, stay away from this thing. Don’t look at it. Don’t engage. It’s probably a dem….” The phone line went dead. 

“Not at all ominous,” Daphne chimed in.

“Think that is probably a good time to take a break. You’re listening to Night Moves on AM 640,” I said, pulling my headphones off as we went to commercial. I glanced over at Daphne. “Banger to start out with, Daph. Great job finding this story.”

Ollie burst into the studio and yelled, “The lines are jammed! Apparently, our ghoul is well known and super active in the community.” 

“Maybe he’s running for office. Sounds like an ideal politician,” I said. “Minus the evil stuff.”

“Actually, even with the evil stuff, he’s an ideal politician,” Daphne countered.

“South Street Wanderer 2028!” Ollie proclaimed. “We could sell T-shirts!”

Daphne stood up. As she did, her whole body shivered. She rubbed her arms, warming herself. “I won’t miss the arctic temps in the studio, that much I promise you.”

“I’m warm, actually. You really feel cold?”

“Not to break up the climate crisis in the studio, but Daphne and I were talking pre-show about, well, maybe sending me out on assignment.” 

“To where?”

“We’re not that far from South Street,” Ollie said. “I could go down there. Do a man on the street segment. Assuming you wouldn’t mind handling the phones while I was gone, Daph.”

“Ollie, no matter what your position is at a radio station, you never stop answering phones,” Daphne said with a smile. “I like you heading down there. Shows moxie. Maybe you’ll catch something. Cause a sensation. Then we really can sell T-shirts.”

“Save the show,” Ollie said hopefully.

“I think the only thing that can save the show now is divine intervention,” I said, raining on the parade.

“So send young Ollie down to the street. What do we have to lose?”

“We could lose Ollie,” I said.

“Small price to pay for fame,” Daphne said. “Kidding, of course.”

“I could be radio’s own DB Cooper,” Ollie said. They turned to me. “I can handle myself, though. Trust me, when you’re in my situation, you need to know how to throw hands, Jack.”

I sighed. “I’d rather not send our lovely but eager colleague off to meet with a potential monster,” I said. “Buuuut, if Ollie is okay, I wouldn’t say no to it either.”

Ollie laughed. “Odds are, it’s a bust. I can’t imagine this thing always hanging around the 7-Eleven, right? Maybe the clerk talks about it? Or, more likely, a drunk or two might have some things to ramble on about.”

“You said to unleash the weirdos,” Daphne said. “Drunks qualify. Especially 7-Eleven drunks.”

“You come back if any of them have a message about your future or if you get a headache. Deal?”

Ollie’s face lit up. They squealed and did a little happy dance. Daphne and I laughed. Ollie was a good kid and would make an amazing radio personality one day. Why not give them a chance to add to their reel? In this economy, in this business, the next gig could be elusive. Especially to unknown talent.

“We’re back in two,” I said, glancing at the clock. “Let’s get through some of these calls and see where we are at the top of the hour. If we’re flagging, Operation Taquitos starts.”

The next hour was a mixed bag of callers - some genuine, some fake, some off their meds. The topic remained the same, though. Despite their demeanor and mental state, anyone who dealt with this thing had similar stories: they heard a voice, received an offer, and either ignored it or took it. If they agreed, their reward was a cryptic message, minor aches and pains, and really horrid vibes. 

“And you say the pain just stopped?”

“Oh yeah,” another Wanderer victim said. “About a week after it happened, I didn’t feel anything.”

“Didn’t feel like another person in your head?”

“H-E double hockey sticks no,” the caller said with a laugh. “That guy’s as loony as an outhouse rat.”

Turns out, tons of people in the Valley knew about the Wanderer. This mythological monster was far more well-known than our show. A common refrain callers felt the need to add was, “Never heard your show before, but…” That was humbling. 

I’d never heard of the legend before Daph had brought it to me. Apparently, I was the only person in the Valley who hadn’t, because our call volume was the heaviest it’d ever been. Way more than the nacho bomb incident of ‘23 - and that garnered local news coverage. Even with that bump, our steady audience was fleeting.

Tonight, though, it felt as if the whole town was listening.

“I guess I’m just confused about why everyone calls him the wanderer when he doesn’t seem to do too much wandering.”

“It’s because his Instagram account is all travel pictures,” Daphne said. “I’ll say this, the ghoul knows how to frame a shot.”

“Ollie says someone on Line 3 can explain the wanderer stuff. Let’s hear what a pro has to say. Cindy, line three, welcome to Night Moves. Our phone screener says you have some scholarly information about the Wanderer you’d like to share?”

“I didn’t want to go on the air, but whatever,” Cindy said. “You guys need to stop talking about this. The more attention you give it, the stronger it becomes.”

“Classic narcissist. You sure he’s not my ex?” Daph joked.

“This isn’t funny. The Wanderer seeks specific individuals it can use to spread its sickness. It knows when people talk about it. Your show is making a dangerous situation worse.”

“Sickness? Are you talking about headaches and nosebleeds?”

“Things get worse. Infinitely worse if it gets too strong,” Cindy said. “You guys have no idea what you’re doing. This thing is ancient and evil. It exists to spread misery.”

“Then it absolutely is my ex,” Daphne joked. “Doesn’t it help people avoid catastrophe, though? Can’t be all that bad.”

“That’s a trick. It tells you something bad will happen, but provides zero specifics. The previous plane crash caller is a good example of this. No survivors…of what? The guy took it to mean his flight, but if I had heard ‘no survivors’ and didn’t have a trip planned, what would that mean to me? Could be anything.”

“But the flight had engine trouble,” I said. “So the Wanderer was right.”

“No, it wasn’t. No one died on the flight.”

“What a bastard that ghoul is not killing off a plane full of people,” Daphne said. Her tone was jokey, but her face wasn’t. Daph had pretzeled her body and was leaning close to the mic. Something about this caller was getting under her skin - like this was a personal attack.

“I’ll grant you that the engine trouble was an amazing coincidence, but the message wasn’t uniquely prophetic because nothing ultimately happened. The caller was safe. The plane was safe.”

“Because the Wanderer told him it’d be. Jack, am I crazy? Cindy here doesn’t seem to be saying much of anything.”

“To a true believer like yourself, I can see that being the case.”

That was the splinter under the fingernail for Daph. She sighed, laughed, and attacked. “True believer? I just read about this the other day,” Daphne said. “I’m just not willing to dismiss it because one rando crazy bitch has a theory.”

“Whoa,” I said. “Let’s relax….”

“I’m used to true believers getting upset. It’s okay,” Cindy said. It looked like Daphne was ready to pounce. I balled up a piece of paper and threw it at her. It bounced off her console and broke her concentration. I wagged my finger at her, and she leaned back in her chair. Her claws retracted.

“Cindy, what were you saying?”

“This isn’t a theory. It’s a scientific fact. Think about it like this: let’s say something incredible happens to you - good or bad - but you don’t understand why it happened. Lacking concrete information, our brain fills in the information gaps with belief. It’s how conspiracy theories bloom.”

“You saying all our callers are conspiracy theorists?” Daphne asked.

“Or that the world isn’t flat,” I countered.

“We all can fall under the sway of good stories,” Cindy said, ignoring my joke. “That caller believes that had he gone on the plane, it would’ve crashed. How does he know that? He doesn’t. But it’s an emotional truth…and that’s enough for some of us. Actual proof requires facts. Belief requires only hope, and hope is nothing more than positive thoughts.”

“Why does the Wanderer bother with that at all?” I asked.

“It lies to gain your trust. That’s a seed planted in your mind. Some people won’t water the seed, so it never germinates. But others will. They’ll tell people about this incredible thing that happened to them. Each conversation gives the Wanderer strength. More of a hold on the person’s mind. By the time the seed blossoms, the victim’s ready to be used for the next stage,” Cindy said. “Jack, it’s called the Wanderer because its evil wanders to every mind that’s open to its message.”

“So our show is an evil super-spreader event?” Daphne asked. “What happens when it gets strong? What’s the Wanderer’s purpose?”

“Chaos. Death. Destruction. It uses its victims. Some will spread their gospel. Some will enact their violence. Some will stand aside as it happens. Each role plays a part in their evil plans.” 

“Didn’t realize we had such a large contingent of evil listeners,” Daphne.

“We’re all capable of evil. You asked about its purpose. Best I can tell is that the Wanderer exists to end us all. It infects people and allows them to act on their worst impulses.”

Cindy’s words hung there for longer than I’d normally allow. What started as a fun, goofy topic had moved into a horrifying place. We were all processing this strange left turn into genuine concern. I had a bunch of other questions, but the next sound I heard was a dial tone. 

Daphne hung up on Cindy. “New age woo woo kook pranking us. Probably surrounded by crystals. They’re worse than wine moms.”

“Well, Cindy, I appreciated the insight.”

“Gonna run right out and buy one of her crystals? Ward off bad juju?”

“Maybe I’ll get one for the studio. Keep the peace,” I said. Daphne’s right eyebrow raised, and she narrowed her eyes at me. I laughed. “Saturn is in retrograde, the moon is waxing gibbous, and you’re listening to Night Moves on AM640. Back in….”

The door to the studio slammed open. Daphne and I both turned to see a familiar face standing there. Manny. The bloody tissue was still wadded up in his nose. His eyes looked glazed. When he moved, he looked like a puppet on marionette strings.

“Manny? What the hell….”

“Keep going,” he said as he smiled widely. Too wide. Joker-level wide. “Keep talking.” It sounded like his voice, but it wasn’t his voice. It was flat. Monotone. Lifeless. His whole body turned toward Daphne. She clutched a pair of scissors. “Keep going.”

He coughed. The hacking unleashed two gushing streams of blood from his nostrils. 

Daphne screamed. I took us to commercial and rushed over to Manny. But something in her scream must’ve snapped Manny out of his trance. His whole body relaxed…until he saw the blood streaming from his nose. He pinched the bridge and tilted his head back to staunch the flow.

“Jesus Christ and his disciples,” Manny said. “Not this again!”

“Manny, what the hell?”

Panic crossed his face. “How did I get here, dog?” he said, confused. “Why the fuck am I bleeding so much?”

The door kicked open again to reveal a pissed-off Ron. His face was red with rage. But his eyes showed fear. As soon as he saw Manny, he grabbed him by the shirt and started shaking him. Manny screamed and pushed Ron back. Before it could come to blows, I slid in between them and broke them up.

“Chill! Chill!” I yelled. They finally relaxed after exchanging a few choice words. I put my hand on Manny’s shoulder and looked him dead in the eyes. “What’s going on?”

“I dunno, bro. Last thing I remember was driving to my next stop, listening to the show. Then you were here talking to me.”

“He’s gotta go,” Ron said. “Never come back here, you hear me, boy?”

“Who the hell are you calling ‘boy’, old man?”

“Enough!” Daphne screamed. “Ron, we’ve got it handled. Go back to the office and have another smoke or ten.”

Ron looked at me. I nodded. The intrusion was unexpected, but I had a handle on it. He straightened out his shirt, ran his hand through his slick, thinning hair, and nodded to us all. He gave Manny the finger and walked out. 

“Man, fuck that fool.”

“You feeling okay?” I asked. “You’re kinda freaking everyone out.”

“To be real with you? Not really. I think…I think I’m going to go home sick. I’m, ugh, I’m sorry, dog. Didn’t mean to break up the party. Show’s been fire tonight, though.” He turned to Daphne. “Sorry, Daph. I didn’t mean nothing by it. Honest.”

“Feel better, Manny,” Daphne said. She didn’t drop the scissors.

Once the studio door shut, I expected the vibe to shift. It didn’t. Doom hung in the air. Even when Ollie entered from the call screening room, everything still felt heavy. I glanced up at the clock and saw we had thirty seconds to air.

“Maybe we should change topics?” I suggested.

I work as a software developer. I don’t smoke or drink. Most evenings are simple-coffee, a good soundtrack in the background, and something worth watching. I’m introverted at first, but once I’m comfortable I’m talkative, loyal, and consistent. I actually show up.

What I’m into: anime and K-dramas with heart (Naruto, Demon Slayer, and anything honest), story-driven movies, late-night playlist rabbit holes, quiet walks, stargazing, museums and cafés over parties, and a clean all-black aesthetic. I used to game a lot; now it’s just Genshin once in a while. I daydream about Japan, Norway, and Switzerland, but I’m just as happy with a calm weekend at home.

What I’m hoping for: someone kind, steady, and open to building something slowly sharing small day-to-day things, swapping songs, laughing at scenes we pause, making little plans we actually follow through on. Long distance is fine if the effort matches; if we click, I’m open to closing the gap.

You don’t need a fancy opener. If this feels like your pace, just say hi and we’ll see if it works.

I’m autistic and I cannot handle change for the life of me. My mum has dementia and my step dad is making things very hard for me. Name calling me such as “fcking twat, waste of space, useless” and just snapping at me. He’s not a bad guy deep down but his mum died 3 years ago and he hasn’t been the same since and he’s getting worse. It makes me very scared. Earlier I made the decision of moving out to my dad’s house 350 miles away for my sake of me being able to study in a quieter environment. He got mad since I can’t get a job which means I can’t provide money for the house he’s staying in with me and my mum. I came down and told my mum and she accepted my decision however was fuming at my step dad for driving me out. He said he’ll move out as it’s not fair I do, I said no cause then who will take care of my mother. I got upset and cried and he cried too, he doesn’t cry, EVER. He’s a very “cold” and kept to himself so knowing he’s crying because of me confused me, he told me he doesn’t want me to leave. I went for a walk and he decided he’ll pick me up to go for coffee. He never takes me for coffee and when we sat down he begged me to stay. Again he never begs people so I was very freaked out. When I got home he offered to take me to my friends house as I’m staying there for the night. He won’t stop messaging me saying “plz don’t go” and everything. It scares me when someone so stable changed and acts like this and I’m not sure why. My mum told me when he got home he was so upset she hasn’t seen him like that since his mother died, I didn’t know I had this effect on him. So why did he treat me like that and drive me away, name calling me then get upset. My mums not stable and now with him not being stable when he’s always fine is freaking me out so badly. He told me “I’m selfishly praying everything goes bad for you at your dad’s house so you move back here”. He NEVER says stuff like this ever I can’t believe it! With everything going on I thought I was gonna throw up, I felt like colour was draining from my face and I was dizzy I just don’t know what came over me. I go back from my friends house to home tomorrow and I’m scared how he’s gonna be. My dad thinks he’s weird and wants me out quick as possible but he’s not weird he just needs help. I’m so upset I can’t describe it, aside from him I love my mother to bits. She got really upset when she had to kick my brother out because him and my step dad didn’t get along. They say I’m the light of the house and he talks to me more than my mum, when we get along we get along really well. But we’ve  been arguing and when we argue it’s really bad. I don’t wanna leave my mum and I’m crying so much, im gonna miss her so badly. I  told them for their peace of mind I’ll be gone for a few months to see how it is then I’ll be back. I now feel like I’m dreaming and this isn’t my reality and I can’t get out of it. I’ve been dissociated before but never this badly. How can I do my online degree starting October with all this going on? Why treat me like this then when I wanna leave make me feel bad for leaving? In very scared I’m gonna lose my mind and not be able to come back. ",1,1757725634.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False

1nfkbkt,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/1nfkbkt/m4f_30_nynorthern_nj_fairytale_chaser_seeks_true/,M4F [30] NY/Northern NJ - Fairy-Tale Chaser Seeks True Love,"Call me delusional, but even after all this time (and disappointment) I’m still adamantly chasing after true love. The kind that they only write about in children’s stories and fairy tales, the kind that the world beats your head over and over saying it doesn’t exist. 

It’s the kind of love where you look into their eyes, gently touch their hands, and you know everything will be alright.

It’s the kind of love that thrusts you out of bed to care for them if they’re sick. 

It’s the kind of love that’s worth waiting a lifetime for, patient and faithful, that will always be there for you, despite the rain and storm clouds. 

Someone who is sort of a loner, always on the outside, never quite fitting in, not because there is something wrong with them, but because they are prudent about whom they choose to give their time to. 

Someone who isn’t afraid to give or receive love and effort, with gratitude and appreciation. 

Someone who is kind, open-minded, intelligent, honest, loyal, and respectful. 

Someone who could be your best friend and have three-hour long discussions with, pouring each other’s souls into one another. 

Someone who is whole and healthy–mentally, spiritually, and physically–content and self-loving, who chooses a partner not as a means to fulfill their needs, but as a mutual amplifier for the goodness that resides within them. 

I know that I am not all there yet, and maybe no one ever is, but I’m willing and determined to improve with the right person. 

Idealistic rambling aside, there are of course practical considerations we must go over. 

My philosophy is that love is a conscious choice, a deliberate action, based on consistency, honesty, and communication. While I still do believe in “attraction at first sight”, I have learned that attraction can grow based on time spent together. I will admit most people do not fit my personal ideal of what I find attractive, and I recognize I may not be most people’s first choice, either. 

Physical Appearance: I am tall and ethnically East Asian. I was born and raised on the East Coast. Right now, I am not filtering based on inherent physical characteristics (outside of body modifications such as noticeable tattoos/piercings), although I shamefully admit that I do not find Asian accents attractive. 

I will not entertain long-distance relationships. Firstly, because I believe being able to get to know someone in person, in a three-dimensional sense, is important (which means willingness to date in-person is a requirement). Secondly, speaking from experience, distance poses significant risks financially, emotionally, and time-wise that are difficult to overcome. Right now, anything longer than an hour drive to meet is my limit. Perhaps that will change in the future, or perhaps you can provide such a good argument to convince me otherwise. But don’t count on it. 

Personality-wise, I am an introvert. I do not like loud spaces or crowds. I prefer spending time in nature, or at a coffee shop, or at a bookstore. Some may call me boring; I prefer introspective. I have a deep appreciation for art and literature (as an icebreaker, what is a book you’ve read this year that has made the biggest impact on your life, and why?), and am less interested in popular media or gaming. I do not like to engage in politics, and would consider my beliefs closely aligned with agnosticism/spirituality/Buddhism. Just because I do not have many activities, doesn’t mean I’m not willing to spend time with the right person. 

I work full-time. I have a graduate degree. When getting to know someone, I value deep, meaningful conversation and lengthy texts. 

Dealbreakers: Non-monogamy, substance use, bigotry. 

While there are valid explanations as to why I am still single after all this time (pride and avoidant personality disorder), I do believe part of the reason is that what I am searching for is quite rare. I don’t believe most people share my criteria to feel fulfilled and happy in a relationship. Whether that is a sunk-cost fallacy, I do not want to settle for anything less, even if it means I will never find a life partner (I would be fine alone). 

Is this a fool’s errand? Perhaps. But all us fools can do is keep trying. Even a broken clock is correct twice a day.

I only wanted a small amount, as I was only cooking for myself, and ended up using my electric kettle, a jar, and a stick frother.

I didn't really expect it to work, but it ended up working like a charm!!! It was a bit thinner than I would have preferred, but I am thinking that was probably due to not cooking it down to thicken.

No sugar-free syrup, wrong milk, forget the espresso shot... whatever. I’d just drink it and move on.

But now?
That same drink that used to cost $5.41 is pushing nine bucks.
And somehow the quality has gotten worse.

The last time I ordered, they forgot to add the sugar-free vanilla. Again. And this was one of those mobile orders where you’re already out the door before you notice. So I hit up chat support and got my money back, which took about 30 seconds. No drama. They didn’t even question it.

So I’ve made a personal policy:

If Starbucks charges premium prices, I’m going to start expecting premium consistency.
If the drink isn’t made right, I ask for a refund. Every single time.

I’m not doing this to be petty. But if a $9 drink tastes off, why should I pay the price for their rushed barista training or overworked staff? I’m not going to “just deal with it” because I’m afraid of being that customer. I’m paying like I’m at a craft cocktail bar... so yeah, I expect it to be made right. It's about principle, not just the money.

So far?
Every complaint has been refunded.
No resistance. No attitude.

Makes you wonder how much of their profit model depends on customers not speaking up.

Anyway, here’s a photo from my last order where they left the syrup out entirely... again.
