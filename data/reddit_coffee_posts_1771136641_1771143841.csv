I want to drive around Da Lat, is it possible with a 50cc? (alone or with someone on my back)

 

I saw that the terrain is full of mountains and I am afraid a 50cc wont do it.

I don’t want to rent any bigger bike, even through it would be much more comfortable, I don’t want to spend any more coffee money and rather drive legally.",1,1771143583.0,VietNam,0,1.0,False

For the past few years I’ve noticed that the vibe of every place I walk into (coffee shops, restaurants, stores) is off. No greeting, little to no eye contact from cashiers, monotone and no one ever says bye when I leave an establishment. This isn’t even about customer service but just weird vibes on a human to human level. I got ice cream today and from the time I walked in to the time I checked out none of the two associates said a word to me except for bye when I finished paying. Not a hello, not even a verbal acknowledgment when they gave me samples I asked for just handed me the spoon. Interactions like these happen very frequently. 

It makes going out a lot less enjoyable. Has anyone experienced this? If so, has it changed how often you go out? It just makes me want to stay at home cause after experiencing so much it really does put a damper on my mood. ",1,1771143485.0,DoesAnybodyElse,0,1.0,False

1r59a0f,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingthruit/comments/1r59a0f/micro_scenes_additional_details/,Micro- scenes Additional Details,"The Highsmith Integration Guide: Refining the Micro-Scenes
 
This guide provides the technical bridge between Patricia Highsmith’s Lesson on Silent Manipulation and your 10-Week Micro-Scene Behavioral Drills. At a master's level, these revision prompts are designed to scrub your prose of ""obviousness"" and replace it with high-stakes psychological subtext.
 
 
 
 
 
I. General Implementation Guidance
 
To ""Highsmith"" your micro-scenes, follow these three narrative commands:
 
1. Manage the Void: If a scene feels flat, remove the character's dialogue and replace it with a Strategic Silence. Observe how the other characters in the scene rush to fill that silence with their own fears or assumptions.
 
2. Monitor the Physical Tell: Never tell us a character is lying or angry. Instead, show us the Internal Friction. Describe the character's jaw tightening, their muscles tensing, or their breathing becoming ""maniacally controlled"" while their surface remain perfectly polite.
 
3. Leverage Affective Alignment: Use a Close Third Person perspective to filter the environment through the character's pathology. If the character is a sadist, describe the victim's pain as a ""curious pattern"" or a ""geometric shift"" rather than an emotional tragedy.
 
 
 
 
 
II. Weekly Highsmithian Revision Prompts
 
Apply these specific prompts to your existing micro-scene drafts to deepen the psychological subtext.
 
 
 
Week 1: The Pathological Liar
 
Prompt: Apply ""The Vacuum."" In Scene 1.1 (The Stolen History), remove the last sentence of Elias's dialogue. Let Sarah fill the silence with her own empathetic assumption about his ""pain."" Show Elias watching her ""create"" the rest of the lie for him.
 
 
 
Week 2: The Grandiose Narcissist
 
Prompt: Apply ""Maniacal Politeness."" In Scene 2.1 (The Interrupted Triumph), emphasize Julian's physical monitoring. While he redirects the conversation, describe the ""maniacal precision"" with which he cuts his steak—a physical manifestation of his need to ""cut"" Clara's success.
 
 
 
Week 3: The Machiavellian Architect
 
Prompt: Apply ""Strategic Silence."" In Scene 3.1 (The Silence), describe the silence not as a lack of sound, but as a ""physical weight"" Marcus places on the room. Focus on how the silence forces Ben and Sarah to become more extreme in their behaviors.
 
 
 
Week 4: The Opportunistic Thief
 
Prompt: Apply ""Aesthetic Appropriation."" In Scene 4.1 (The Justified Taking), describe the silver thimble as if it were a missing piece of Lenore's own body. When she slips it into her pocket, don't focus on the ""theft,"" but on the ""aesthetic click"" of her identity finally becoming whole.
 
 
 
Week 5: The Covert Narcissist
 
Prompt: Apply ""Weaponized Vulnerability."" In Scene 5.1 (The Public Sigh), ensure Helen's ""martyrdom"" is perfectly polite. She shouldn't complain; she should ""maniacally protect"" the hosts from her own sadness, which—ironically—makes her sadness the only thing anyone can talk about.
 
 
 
Week 6: The Sadistic Provocateur
 
Prompt: Apply ""Epistemic Control."" In Scene 6.1 (The Surgical Insecurity), use the close third person to describe the boy's trembling hand as a ""fascinating specimen."" Remove any ""guilt"" from Victor's POV; he is a scientist, and the boy's fear is merely data.
 
 
 
Week 7: The Unscrupulous Social Climber
 
Prompt: Apply ""Mirroring."" In Scene 7.1 (The Accent Shift), have Thomas literally adopt the posture and rhythm of the Duchess's breathing. Show the moment his own ""core"" disappears as he becomes her perfect, silent reflection.
 
 
 
Week 8: The Paranoid Tyrant
 
Prompt: Apply ""The Void."" In Scene 8.1 (The Loyalty Trap), have Silas remain silent after David enters the room. Let the ""void"" of Silas's silence pressure David into a defensive monologue that reveals a secret David wasn't even hiding.
 
 
 
Week 9: The Resentful Saboteur
 
Prompt: Apply ""Maniacal Politeness."" Before Gregory sends the anonymous email in Scene 9.1, write a 50-word interaction where he is ""chillingly kind"" to Claire, offering her a coffee or a compliment. The ""Silent Manipulation"" is the gap between the kindness and the strike.
 
 
 
Week 10: The Moral Nihilist
 
Prompt: Apply ""Affective Alignment."" In Scene 10.1 (The Flat Transgression), ensure the prose is devoid of ""human"" words. Describe the fire not as a tragedy, but as a ""conversion of matter."" Force the reader to experience the scene's physics, not its morality.

1r599q9,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChristianSocialism/comments/1r599q9/are_you_looking_what_is_perfection_of_human_life/,are you looking what is perfection of human life ?,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

if you want to see Actual Purpose of human life then see this link : ( triple w ( d . o . t ) asitis ( d . o . t ) c . o . m  {Bookmark it })

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",1,1771143358.0,ChristianSocialism,0,1.0,False
1r599ls,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1r599ls/vday_letdown_pay_for_your_own_dinner/,Vday Letdown= Pay for your own dinner,"\*\*TL;DR;\*\* : I put in some effort for Valentine’s. She put in none. We have dinner planned for the day after vday. I’m not paying.

—

Am I wrong for suggesting we split the check for valentines dinner? Hear me out.

My girlfriend (33F) and I (38M) have been together since last August. We agreed “let’s not go crazy for our first vday but we can do something for each other” agreeing we don’t need to spend a ton of money etc. We did plan however to go out for a nice dinner together on Sunday. Ok. Vday arrives, we meet for coffee and plan to make brunch together.

I’m a loverboy. I like giving little gifts, showing I care, acts of affection and so on, so I showed up to coffee with some inexpensive flowers. She appreciates, says her gift didn’t work out- apparently she’d planned on taking some sexy photos with her Polaroid for me but she was unexpectedly out of film. Ok bummer to miss out on that but no biggie lol.

We get coffee, go to the grocery store for brunch supplies and a home goods type store where she gets some things for her new apartment that she moved into this week. Before we shop I surprise her with another small gesture I’d already gotten- her favorite candy bar hehe omg s’cute whatever. We go back to her new apartment, I help with a couple things around the place. “Big” reveal- she discovers a card I got her including a note that I’ve set up a massage appointment for her. Not expensive but just thinking of her, wasn’t going to get her nothing, she’s been stressed/sore, etc.

Now it’s lunch time and we decide to just go get tacos. Not making brunch together anymore ok that’s fine. We go back to her apartment, I hang some shelves, art, a mirror, curtains, set up a bed frame for her etc. (ps: earlier I helped clean her old place some and move the last her things).

Now it’s getting to dinner time and we planned to make it together- she’s not hungry. Wants to just have a bowl of cereal or something. Allllright. I forgot to bring an overnight bag so I go back home to get one and eat by myself. Getting bummed on how the day is turning out.

Now I get back to her place, I’ve showered, she’s showered, I think oh boy finally we get to \~do something together\~. She lets me in, I change into something cozy, she’s already laying on the bed. I join her. We cuddle up, she starts falling asleep. Ok change gears I go to the bathroom, I come back she says “sorry I’m so tired”. That’s ok, I turn off the main light. I get in bed facing each other, she rolls over and turns the lamp off, pitch black. I try to keep her awake, talking, caressing, she falls asleep. Awesome!

So anyway I’m laying here in the dark typing this while she’s sound asleep, replaying the day like “damn, nothing? Like at all? Not even an effort?” I would have thought she’d want to at least have sex which is mutually beneficial and after helping her all day and giving her gifts even if they’re not grand, nothing from you whatsoever….anyway I’m not paying for dinner tomorrow. Am I wrong for that? I don’t expect much but I’m not going to spoil anyone. Am I some kind of jerk over here or something jeez.",1,1771143346.0,relationships,1,0.67,False

1r598qa,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChristianCringe/comments/1r598qa/are_you_seeking_where_is_goal_of_life/,are you seeking where is goal of life ?,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

if you want to see Actual Purpose of human life then see this link : ( triple w ( d . o . t ) asitis ( d . o . t ) c . o . m  {Bookmark it })

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",1,1771143257.0,ChristianCringe,0,1.0,False
1r598pu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlAnon/comments/1r598pu/first_lie_and_hiding_cans/,First lie and hiding cans,"I see a boundary with my husband last June. I told him I know I can’t make him quit drinking but I do not want to EVER be around him when he’s drunk and I don’t want him to drink at home. Drinking at home is his weakness. He would drink all day long from when he finishes his coffee if it didn’t bother me. 

So he started having a couple beers on his way home from work. Then a couple more when he would pull over at his lookout spot up the street. Over the last few months it has turned in to 4-6 beers a day again on average. Before he gets home of course. Then if I’m gone with the kids he will drink more. On the weekends suddenly he has no problems running in to town to grab something wet need (30+ minutes each way) because he will grab some beer while he’s out and then just try to drink as much as he can before he gets home.  

Them he started hiding the cans…. He stashes them somewhere and throws them away at the gas or something. 

I called him out on it the other day and we finally actually talked about it tonight. 

He SWEARS he only drinks 3 a day. 

The thing is, he is really weird about truth and lies. Like he thinks ANY lie, whether it’s a small white lie to save someone’s feelings or whatever is absolutely not ok. That’s been one of the things I’ve always really respected him for. Like you can always trust that he is telling the truth.

But now he’s just flat out lying to my. It’s so weird and part of me thinks he thinks he’s actually telling the truth but then I KNOW I shouldn’t question myself and I KNOW he’s lying because I started keeping a very close count of his daily drinking habits. I just check his truck when he gets home and he doesn’t notice. I know that can’t go on forever and I’ll be done with it now that I’ve basically told him anyway.

Buy seriously what the hell, it’s so awkward hat this truthful guy is making up the dumbest lie. The second hand embarrassment is real. But also I’m so mad because this just seems like a dead end. There’s no fixing it. Ughhh 

Who else had the most truthful husband/wife before they decided to start lying all the time and covering their tracks? ",1,1771143256.0,AlAnon,1,1.0,False
1r597bf,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1r597bf/everyone_sees_someone_different/,Everyone sees someone different.,"He’d lived in the building for six years, long enough to know every name on every mailbox and which ones stuck when you tried to open them. The foyer carpet was frayed and grey, worn thin in the middle where everyone cut across it instead of following the faded pattern. The metal mailboxes were set into the wall like the ones at the post office—narrow, dented, and always a little colder than they should be.

​Most days he worked from home in 3F, tucked behind two monitors and a headset that pinched his left ear. Resetting passwords for people who couldn’t remember their own mother’s maiden name wasn't a career, but it paid the rent and kept him in decent coffee. It was quiet. He liked quiet. On the days he had to go on-site, he always came back around the same time—early evening, when the foyer usually buzzed with people checking mail, chatting, waiting for the lift. It made the building feel alive.

​The first time he saw her, she was standing beside Mike from 2B.

​He’d come down the emergency stairwell—narrow, concrete, lit by fluorescent tubes that flickered no matter how often the maintenance guy replaced them. “Cheap bloody ballasts,” the maintenance bloke had spat once, wiping grease onto a high-vis vest that had seen better decades. “Swap the tubes, swap the starters, doesn't matter. This building just eats 'em.”

​When he pushed open the heavy fire-door into the atrium, he saw Mike leaning against the mailboxes, Tigers scarf looped around his neck. And beside him stood a woman he didn’t recognise—young, maybe mid-20s like him, with a red velvet scrunchie in her hair.

​He assumed she must be Mike’s daughter.

​Mike spotted him. “Hey, mate! You catch the Tigers game last night?”

​He nodded. “Yeah. Rough third quarter.”

​Mike groaned. “Don’t remind me. Total collapse.”

​The woman smiled—soft, like she already knew him. Something about her face tugged at him, a half-formed memory he couldn’t chase down.

​“This is Alice,” Mike said.

​“Nice to meet you,” he replied.

​“You too,” she said.

​He walked past them, heading for the stairwell again—he never used the lift—and the whole way up, her face stayed with him. By the second floor, he was annoyed at himself—just another brain-fog moment from staring at code all day. By the time he reached the third floor, the tightness in his chest had settled into a dull, familiar ache he could blame on the stairs.

​Eight days passed before he saw her again.

​He hadn’t seen Mike since that night, which was strange—the Tigers had played over the weekend, and Mike usually hunted him down to complain. But the foyer had been quiet all week. Fewer footsteps in the hall.

​On Thursday afternoon, he came back from a client meeting and found Janice from 2D standing by the lift, chatting with the same woman—except she wasn’t wearing the red scrunchie anymore. This one was yellow, patterned with tiny flowers.

​Janice waved him over. “Oh, hello love! You’re back early.”

​“Meeting finished quicker than I thought.”

​Janice beamed. “This is Betty. My new bridge partner. We’ve been practising all week.”

​Betty gave him that same soft smile. The tug in his chest returned, sharper this time. Janice was in her seventies. Betty looked his age.

​“Aren’t you a little young to be playing bridge?” he asked.

​Janice giggled. “Oh, you young men are such flatterers.”

​He blinked. “I… wasn’t—”

​Betty tilted her head. “We’ve met before, haven’t we?”

​The question hit him harder than it should have. He opened his mouth, then closed it again. “I don’t think so.”

​Her smile didn’t change, but something in her eyes did—a flicker, like she knew something he didn’t.

​“Well,” she said, touching Janice’s arm, “we should get going. Tournament on Sunday.”

​Betty’s gaze lingered on him a moment too long. Then she ushered Janice toward the lift. He took the stairs. He didn’t look back.

​After that, the building didn't just feel empty—it felt discarded. The usual rhythms were gone. No muffled TV news through the doors, no smell of overcooked onions. The frayed carpet stayed undisturbed, and the mailboxes began to vomit junk mail—vibrant flyers for pizza places that nobody was ordering from.

​The maintenance guy was still there, but he looked smaller, his mop bucket trailing a grey, sour-smelling wake. “Bins are empty again,” he muttered, not looking up. “Like nobody’s even eating in this place.”

​Upstairs, the hallway felt longer. The air was thick and stale. He found himself listening for the mundane sounds of neighbours—a muffled TV, a microwave beep—but there was nothing but the low, electric hum of the corridor lights.

​He got home later than usual that night. The building felt like a tomb, the silence so heavy it made his ears ring. When he buzzed himself in, the elevator gave that familiar, too-loud BING on the fourth floor, but the doors opened to an empty hallway.

​He didn't wait to see if they’d close. He took the stairs two at a time, his breathing ragged in the concrete echo of the stairwell.

​His apartment felt wrong before he even turned the light on. It wasn't just dark; it was occupied. The air held a faint, impossible trace of floral perfume. He fumbled for the switch, his heart hammering against his ribs like a trapped bird.

​The light flooded the room, and there it was.

​A light blue scrunchie sat dead-centre on his coffee table.

​He didn't want to touch it, but his hand moved on its own. The fabric wasn't just warm; it felt lived-in. A sick realization crawled up his throat—this wasn't a warning. It was a marker.

​Then he heard it. A soft click. The sound of a door opening. His bedroom door.

​He turned. 

She stood in the doorway.

​He tried to find the name Mike had used, or the one Janice had cooed, but they were gone. All he could see was the way her smile fitted her face perfectly—too perfectly—like a mask that had finally stopped itching.

A name popped in to his mind.

“Rosie.”

​“You’re finally home,” she said.

​The scrunchie slipped from his hand.",1,1771143107.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

(Part2) below

Gerran was twenty, lean and strong in the arms and shoulders, the kind of build that came from working long days. His face held a striking, almost delicate beauty — the sort that made people look twice to be certain of what they were seeing. His hair was light and uneven from sun and weather, he often would tied it back. Those eyes were ice-blue — clear, direct, and difficult to ignore when they fixed on someone. His movements were quick, sometimes careless, as though his body reacted before thought finished forming. His voice carried easily in a group, warm and youthful, with laughter that came fast and often. A sword hung at his hip, worn from use.

Alec, at eighteen, carried a quieter presence. He was lean, but there was a contained strength in the way he held himself, as though every movement had already been considered before it happened. His hair was dark — almost black — catching a warm brown when the light struck it. It was just long enough to fall into his eyes, but too short to tie back. His eyes matching his hair, deep, steady, difficult to read. His movements were deliberate, steps placed with a quiet precision. His sword was well-kept and clearly used, the grip smooth where his hand fell. He did not demand notice, yet people noticed him all the same.

the world quiet around them — fog pooling low and pale in the half-light.

Alec was tending to his horse’s hoof, prying a stone loose with the blunt end of a stick. The gelding shifted and snorted softly.

“Easy, boy. Nearly got it,” he murmured.

From a few strides away, Gerran yawned, stretching lazily in the saddle.

“You ever notice how Malrick always gives us first watch? I swear that man’s allergic to dawn.”

Alec smirked without looking up.

“Maybe he just likes the peace and quiet when you’re not around.”

“Yeah? Well, peace and— SHIT—!”

Gerran’s mount launched forward; he rolled clean off the back in a clumsy tumble, legs flying, hitting the ground belly-first with a solid thud.

Alec’s gelding spooked at the same moment, jerking its hoof out of his hands. The pull sent Alec hard onto his backside.

Gerran slowly pushed himself to his feet, brushing dirt off his front, confusion written all over his face.

“What the hell was that all about? All I know is we’re in trouble if the commander sees our horses ru—”

A blur of grey crashed through the fog — the creature’s jaws opened wide, a cavern of muscle closing around Gerran mid sentence and wrenching him clean off the ground.

“Shit! Gerran!” Alec shouted

“Spit him out, you bastard!” Alec already moving — to his feet, sword sliding free in an instant.

Half inside the creature’s mouth, Gerran thrashed — fists hammering against the slick walls of flesh. He then shoved his arms outward, bracing against the tightening muscles that dragged at him, every instinct screaming not to let go. The pressure crushed his chest, the air squeezed from his lungs.. The creature turned — massive, hunched, still trying to swallow Gerran— now fixed on Alec.

Alec lunged first, blade flashing as he closed the distance. Heat radiated from its body — a reeking blend of rot and damp hide that clung to the air. He swung for the leg, cutting deep into the creature’s flesh. As he shifted his weight to press the advantage, his boot slid on a root slick with blood hidden beneath the fallen leaves, his balance faltering as the ground betrayed him. He barely had time to regain his balance before the creature lunged at him.

He raised his sword just in time, catching enough of the creature’s lunge to blunt the worst of it — but not stop it. The remaining force slammed into him, a claw raking across his chest, splitting the leather like tearing bark and leaving a burning line beneath. Pain flared white-hot. He stumbled back, breath locked in his throat, one hand pressed against the shallow gashes that burned beneath his armour. It wasn’t deep, but it bled like hell.

The creature lunged again. Alec advanced, gritting his teeth, and swung the blade biting deep into the other front leg. blood spattered across the ground, the strike dropped it to its knees, one last swing opened the throat with a wet, tearing sound, and the creature collapsed to the ground.

Alec staggered back, dripping in its hot blood. The heat rolling off the carcass was choking; the smell hit like a fist — sour, burnt, and wet. He gagged hard, bile rising as he stumbled toward the body.

“Gods!” he rasped, choking on the smell.

Gerran’s body sagged half out of the creature’s mouth, still fighting, Alec dropped his sword, grabbed Gerrans legs, and pulled, gagging on the stench. The creature’s saliva slicked everything, warm and stringing, making it hard to get a grip. He slipped, cursed, pulled again.

Gerran came free with a sick, wet noise. They slid a few feet in the muck, the slime turning the ground like ice beneath them.

Alec lay there, chest heaving, trying to breathe through the stench and not gag.

Then Gerran coughed hard spitting up bile… and started laughing.

Alec turned his head slowly, eyes wide in disbelief.

Gerran wheezed between bursts, glancing over and spotting the blood seeping through Alec’s torn leathers.

“How the hell are we still alive?”

He had one hand pressed to his forehead, laughing the words out like a madman. Each breath hitched between disbelief and exhaustion.

He kept laughing — gagging between breaths — as though the absurdity itself were the punchline. Alec blinked, stunned… then a rough, disbelieving sound escaped him — something between a cough and a laugh.

Back at the camp men slow to wake.

Lounging around the fire, half-dressed, brewing something that passed for coffee.

Malrick had just caught Obsidian and was slowly walking her back toward camp, letting her pick at the grass as they wandered.

Then — chaos.

Two horses burst through the fog, they thundered through the camp in a blind gallop — hooves pounding, iron shoes striking sparks off stone. A pot of water went flying, steam hissing as it hit the fire. Men shouted and dove aside, bedrolls trampled under heavy hooves. One horse clipped a post and snapped a washing line, clothes whipping through the air like startled birds. The other kicking up mud — that landed squarely in the morning stew.

The men moved at once, snatching up whatever hadn’t been trampled — clean cloth, half-dried shirts, anything that wasn’t mud-soaked. No one bothered chasing after the runaway horses; everyone already knew who they belonged to, and they could guess well enough how it happened.

Malrick and Obsidian both snapped their heads up toward the commotion from camp. The grey and bay geldings, reins flying, eyes wide, charging at a flat gallop straight through the camp.

For a split second, his brain refused to register it. Then— “What the fuck…” he mouthed under his breath

Without a second thought, he threw the lead rope over Obsidian’s neck, simultaneously swinging onto her back in one practiced motion.

“Shit! Hurry up, girl, after them!”

Obsidian lunged forward, hooves tearing at the soft earth as they shot after the fleeing pair.

Behind him, the men in camp groaned in irritation, muttering about ruined breakfast, and how they’d have to wash everything all over again. Their complaints faded into the fog as Malrick urged Obsidian onward.

Moments later, the trees broke open into a clearing. He reined in hard, snagging the runaway geldings. They were trembling, slick with sweat, the air around them thick with panic.

“Hells,” he breathed, scanning the tree line. “What had you running so scared?”

He clicked his tongue and muttered, “Let’s go find those idiots before they get themselves killed.”

Turning back toward camp with the boys’ horses in tow, he caught the sound of men still grumbling over the mess left in the geldings’ wake.  Malrick didn’t slow; their noise fell away as the the forest closing in again, fog coiling between the trees. Somewhere ahead, carried on the damp air, came laughter — uneven, breathless, and unmistakably theirs.

For a second he’d pictured the worst; the boys’ laughter turned that fear into blind anger. How could they be this careless with their horses? They were obviously doing something stupid and spooked them in the process. He thought to himself, they’re lucky the horses didn’t step on their reins and cut their tongues or broke a leg. When I get there, those boys are gonna wish they were dead.

As he rode upon the boys, the scene unfolded before him — the two of them sprawled in the filth, slick with blood and some kind of slime, beside the carcass of a beast he’d never seen before. His anger faltered, replaced by a stunned, reluctant relief. For once, the danger had been real. He exhaled slowly, reining in beside them

Then the smell it hit him.

He grimaced, pulling back slightly. The air was thick with — rot, bile, and the off-smell of blood the boys were rolling in. Obsidian snorted, tossing her head, ears flicking back in protest.

“Gods above,” Malrick muttered. “Is that stench your fear… or that thing?” He choked, gagging against the smell.

He shook his head. “Well, lucky for you, I found your horses. Seems they’re the only ones with enough sense to run — smarter than their riders, at least.”

He exhaled with a sigh. “I swear, you’ve got two brain cells between the two of you, and they’re both fighting for third place.”

Alec pushed himself up, slipped back into the mud, and let out a grunt of pain, clutching his chest.

“Two brain cells, huh! That’s generous” Gerran grinned. “Last week when you asked for something, you said, ‘So which one of you idiots has the brain cell today?’”

Alec gave a breathless laugh, palm pressed to his chest — blood seeping through torn leather.

“Some things never change, Commander. Looks like it’s my turn again.”

Malrick sighed, swung down from Obsidian. Mud squelched under his boots as he jabbed a finger toward them.

“I galloped halfway to the border expecting to drag back corpses — and instead I find you two rolling in beast guts.”

Gerran raised a hand in a lazy salute.

“Gotta keep you on your toes Commander.”

Malrick pinched the bridge of his nose.

“One of these days, you two be the death of me.”

“Oh, don’t worry — we’re definitely working on it,” Gerran shot back.

Alec barked out another laugh, and even Malrick let out a quiet chuckle.

“Right, up — both of you. If you can still laugh, you can ride.”

Then he paused, looked back over his shoulder, and couldn’t help the final jab.

“On second thought, keep your stink to yourselves. I’m not about to punish your horses by handing them back to you.”

He pointed toward the river with the reins.

“The river’s that way. Go wash up before you return to camp and stink everyone out.”

Both boys groaned in protest.

“Commander, it’s freezing,” Gerran complained.

“Aye,” Alec added, dragging himself upright with a grunt. “Pretty sure there’s ice floating down the river.”

Malrick snorted at Alec’s comment. “Maybe the cold will shock some sense into the two of you.”

The boys muttered something under their breath that sounded suspiciously like a sarcastic remark. From where Malrick stood, he could almost hear the pop of an exaggerated eye-roll as they helped each other to their feet.

Malrick shook his head, watching them go, he muttered to himself.

“Bloody idiots.”

The boys trudged toward the river, slick with slime and blood. Ribbons of mist rose from the water, twisting pale and thin in the dawn light.

Alec hissed through his teeth as he bent to rinse the blood from his chest. The gashes stung sharp against the icy water. “Shh, gods”

Gerran chuckled beside him, flicking a handful of water in his direction. “what’s wrong, princess? can’t handle a little cut?”

Alec splashed him back, half laughing, half grimacing.

“Keep it up and I’ll drown you next.”

“After all that?” Gerran smirked. “You’d miss me.”

Malrick watched the pair bicker and splash like children, their laughter echoing across the water. He let out a small chuckle. Legging up on to his horse turning toward camp, nudging her into a slow trot to fetch a bar of soap — and the only spare set of clothes the boys owned.

As the camp came into view, Malrick slowed Obsidian to a walk, handing the reins of the boy’s horses to a pair of men by the fire.

“Here unsaddle them, and turn them out” he said, “and for gods’ sake, wash their legs — unless you want to smell that stench every time the wind shifts.”

The men groaned but obeyed, muttering about “bloody orphans, we always have to clean up after them” as they led the horses toward the river.

Malrick swung down, landing with a soft grunt, and crossed to the supply tent. He pulled out a clean cloth, a jar of salve, and a roll of bandage.

He paused, staring down at the items, and shook his head.

“Why do I care so much about those two idiots?”

Obsidian flicked an ear toward him, as if he had asked her the question.

Malrick sighed and glanced her way.

“Don’t start with me. Someone’s gotta patch them up before they fall apart.”

Obsidian snorted as if to say you always do.

Malrick packed the satchel with bandages, soap, and clean sets of clothes before heading back toward the river.

The boys looked up as he approached, shivering, lips blue from the cold. “Took your time, Commander,” Gerran muttered through chattering teeth.

He tossed the bar of soap toward them. “Try using that for once,” he said, voice even now. “And use the soap on your clothes too—wash them properly, ring them out, and here are your dry ones.” Malrick set the satchel of clean clothes down on the riverbank.

“When you’re done there, Alec, I need to see to that wound of yours”

The boys worked in silence, too cold to crack jokes, scrubbing at the grime as the river carried streaks of blood and mud downstream. A few paces away, Malrick crouched beside the carcass, a strip of cloth tied over his nose and mouth to blunt the stench radiating from it. How in the gods’ names did they not smell this coming? he thought, grimacing beneath the fabric. Still, duty was duty. He steadied his charcoal and began recording the creature in his Book of Beasts — the curve of its jaw, the barbed ridges along its spine, the colour of its eyes before they dulled. The book was more than his own record now; it held the stories and sightings gathered from every village along the border — what people had seen peering from the dark forest, whispered over fires, or sworn to in fear. He’d ask the boys later for what he couldn’t see: how it moved, how it sounded.

Gerran wrung out his shirt with shaking hands, teeth still chattering.

“Gods, I can’t feel my fingers,” he muttered.

“Me too,” Alec said quietly. “Let’s hurry up so we can get back to the fire.”",1,1771142335.0,fantasywriting,0,1.0,False

I think you’d have had to see my dream to understand how creepy this movie was but I’ll try to explain it the best I can

The movie was called David. It was about this man who wakes up in a forest and the movie is only shot in one perspective of a wide shot (so no close ups or anything, almost like a platformer game) the movie is mostly silent but takes place in the day

We follow David as he traverses this weird forest I don’t know if he was trying to escape the forest or if he was trying to find something but the scariest part of the dream was what kept spawning behind him, I don’t have much knowledge on cinematic shots so you’ll have to try to imagine this with my bad descriptions

But David will be wondering the forest and behind him random things will just spawn in but he can’t see them, only the viewer sees them and it’ll be like these creepy looking sheep with black beady eyes but they’ll just vanish, then there’ll be another cut with the sheep drinking in a diner drinking coffee and just watching David in the forest and then it disappears

Then sometimes there will be these feral looking children, and sometimes there will be so many of them that they almost mesh together to form a weird shape, David sees none of this, David is oblivious to everything and the silence of the movie makes it scarier

You then see David on horseback still traversing the forest until he comes across a note saying “happy birthday David” and the movie ends, I think there’s more to it that I forgot while sleeping but it’s the scariest shit ever, I even dreamt of a viewer saying the movie takes place in the day but the atmosphere makes it feel like night, fuck man, I wish I could watch that

I don’t know if this dream will sound as creepy to you guys, maybe it feels like that to me because I just woke up but man",1,1771142313.0,Dreams,0,1.0,False

She’s obsessed with “saving” and finding ways to get free stuff  like signing up for free food samples using different fake names and emails. She's by no means poor and earns far more than me or even my parents who we live with. The kitchen and groceries are mostly stocked by them, and my siblings and I occasionally chip in with snacks or fruit. Everyone generally sorts out their own meals, but my mom sometimes offers to cook extra portions.

My sister constantly rummages through the kitchen, cooking meals for herself using whatever ingredients my parents bought. While they say they don’t mind, I feel she is exploiting their generosity. Snacks and fruit I buy often disappear because she packs them for work. She says she’s just “eating healthy” by having her home-cooked vegetable meals, but when the fridge is empty, she’ll eat anything.  
  
Further contradicting her money-saving and healthy eating tendencies, she would splurge readily on cafe foods like cakes, desserts and coffees for herself and has a habit of eating half portions of snacks and drinks leaving leftovers in the fridge for ages until they spoil or someone else finally throws them out.  
  
When she does buy groceries and snacks, she labels it as her or keeps it in her room, only adding it to the shared pantry when it’s expiring or she doesn't like it. 

I've confronted her over her contradictory behavior and that she is freeloading and called her a selfish miser. However she says everything in the common area is fair game for consumption and I should be responsible to keep food in my own room which is ridiculous because my room is not a pantry and Im not planning on buying fridge just to store my food.

This is a win, I guess?","I'm 32 and, for various reasons, never celebrated Valentine's Day with anyone. My longest relationship ever was around 2.5 years but long-distance, so we didn't really do anything. My next longest relationship lasted a bit less than a year but started somewhere in late February, so it was after V-day. Besides these two, I've only ever had situationships or one-sided pursuits that never materialized into anything. 

Throughout my life, even until last year, this used to really bother me. I would start to question my worth, why I never get to experience things that other people take for granted, etc., and that would start to turn into a self-hating meltdown of sorts. 

This year, I kinda feel differently about it...

1. In recent months, I've been much more open to talking to people about my life. Not in a trauma dumping way, but just in a very honest kinda way. This led to a revelation around Christmas time when I found out that many people just pretend to have happy families because they think that's how Christmas is ""supposed to be"". I think it's a similar case with Valentine's Day too... I'm sure there are many couples who are genuinley happy, but **there's also so many more who are just pretending to be happy.** I look at my own brother and his wife. They should've never been married in the first place because they are incompatible. They've both stuck it out for social performance reasons. I don't talk to my brother but, every year, my mom tells me about how his wife is the one making plans and pressuring him to do something on V-Day, just so she has loads of pictures to show people 🙄
2. I recently posted about finally reaching some semblance of secure attachment ([post link](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD_NSCommunity/comments/1qzhjyb/achievement_unlocked_secure_attachment/)). Now that I feel much more secure about my own self-worth outside of relationships, it hit me that... **I don't need to prove anything to myself anymore.** For all this time, V-Day was one of those many things that I felt I ""didn't have access to"". My desire to celebrate it with someone was less about actually wanting to experience it but more about wanting that proof or validation of self-worth, to tell myself that ""I finally got to experience this. Now I'm worthy."" Sort of as proof that, if I'm getting the same experience as everyone else, then, finally, I'm good enough. This year, that deep desperation just... isn't there. other people celebrating Valentine's Day? Cool. It feels almost like people celebrating Lunar New Year or Hanukkah or something else that is relevant for them, but not for me. There's no self-worth attached to it anymore. 

I've also been sick this weekend, so I ended up spending most of the day in bed. But I feel like, even if I wasn't sick, I would've treated it as just any other Saturday. Get some nice coffee, go outside if the weather is nice, cook myself a nice meal, and play my favorite video games. Oh, and spend A LOT of time with my younger parts, nurturing them, and doing stuff that makes them happy. Over time, I've learned to prioritize them at the level that people prioritize their external kids. Weekends are for spending time with ""the kids"".

1r58uin,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1r58uin/aitah_for_leaving_out_one_of_my_friends_on_a/,AITAH for leaving out one of my friends on a friendgroup trip?,"I apologize in advance as this needs some lore to make sense, so this will be a longer one. A few years ago, I went on a trip to my family holiday home, with a few of my girlfriends, for a week. Overall we had a great time, but I realized that one of my friends (who I'll call Dolly) is extremely difficult to live with. Not because she isn't fun etc, but I could compare living with her to be like having a child needing to be supervised. I never previously realized what she is like because I've only had the occasional sleepover with her, which was all fine, but this was very different. 

 I'll give some examples of things she did while on the trip:

1. I had explained that the home is old, so ants are a problem, please don't leave food out. So... She leaves a plate out with food on it on the kitchen table multiple times. I gently remind her to please not do that. She gets mad and remarks how I've left a cup of coffee (which was empty) on the table outside... Anyway. 

2. We came home from the beach and she put her soaked and sandy bikini and towel on the light colored carpet in the lounge, until I realized it was there and told her to move it, which was like an hour later. 

3. She left the stovetop on and forgot about it after making herself food. She would've left the house with it still on.

4. We all went out drinking one night and on the walk home she was shouting about how drunk she was (we were a couple of young girls travelling alone, we didn't want possible dodgy people to know we were maybe a little vulnerable at that moment) but after asking her to shush and telling her she could've been making us a target, she didn't.

5. When we got to the house, she put a fitted sheet on her bed but not a topsheet. I didn't know until the last day which meant I had to then wash the entire douvet. She said she didn't put a topsheet on because she couldn't find one so she didn't think it needed one. There was multiple in the cupboard. The same cupboard she got the fitted sheet from.

So yeah. Some of those were legitimately dangerous, some were maybe not a big deal. But eitherway, we all realized a week away together wasn't a good idea. 

Now here's where I might be the AH. Fast-forward a few years, we decided to plan another trip, same place, but with all our male and female friends together. At this point Dolly is now living in the UK. Everyone in the gc acknowledged the trip idea and said they'd let me know if theyd make it later on. Dolly asks if she should fly to the country I'm in for the trip, I say she can, but I don't expect her to. 

Fast-forward again a few months before trip time, and everyone confirms that they're coming except Dolly. I know I should've maybe reached out and directly asked her if she was coming or not, but deep down I hoped she wouldn't come. Again, I don't dislike Dolly, but I did avoid bringing the trip up in the original gc. I actually ended up making a completely different gc for the trip specifically, with everyone but Dolly in it.

Trip time. We go, we have a good time. We all post about it on social media and I probably should've blocked Dolly from seeing my stories so it didn't feel so in her face. She's now back living in the same country as me, but neither of us have reached out to see eachother. If I text her or anything I get very generic replies. I genuinely did love her as a friend but we didnt suit eachother when it came to travelling together. I'm pretty sure our friendship is over but I'm aware it was my choices that lead to that.

I’m 28, currently living in Mandaluyong for work but I go home to QC on weekends. Ideally looking for someone nearby — proximity makes consistency easier.

I’m a General Manager for a fitness studio (three branches), so weekdays are mostly work mode. Disclaimer: I manage the studio, I’m not the ultra-fit coach 😂

Personality-wise? Extrovert. Kaladkarin. Can handle a room. People usually say I look intimidating at first, but I promise I’m just structured, not scary.

Green flag: I genuinely try to see things from your perspective. I communicate how I feel in a reasonable way — no guessing games.  
Red flag: I get anxious and jealous sometimes. Not in a toxic way, but in a “I know I’m not irreplaceable and that scares me” kind of way. Working on it.

Outside work:

* Hiking girl (first half of the year is mountain season)
* Big reader (I have more books than shelf space)
* Speakeasy bars > loud clubs (I don’t drink much)
* Dinner dates > coffee dates

I’m looking for something intentional. Someone I can nurture and grow with. I want a constant who is also serious about building something stable.

Preferences:

* Around my age or early 30s
* Taller than 5’7 (I’m a tall baby)
* Humorous, friendly, neat, decent
* Working professional

I’ll be honest — I’m not that confident in dating these days. I have insecurities like anyone else, and sometimes it’s hard not to wonder if someone will see beyond surface-level attraction. But I’m willing to show up and try.

Start with something better than “hi.” if you think we'll vibe. 

P.S. Contrary to popular belief, I don’t want to girlboss at home. I do that enough at work. I’d actually love to be taken care of sometimes.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Does his dynamic with Paul feel authentic and layered?

• Do Robert and Lewis receive enough page time and development to feel significant?

Blurb

Paul is broke, directionless, and terrified of becoming invisible.

When he lands a position at Livanse — a company known for its structure, hierarchy, and rapid advancement — it feels like salvation. No degree. No connections. Just discipline and the promise of growth.

Paul had no degree.

No connections.

No impressive résumé.

Just overdue rent and a quiet fear of staying small forever.

Every evening he met his best friend Bill at a cheap café near the bus stop. The tables were scratched. The coffee tasted thin. But it was theirs.

Bill worked as a warehouse loader.

Long shifts. Heavy boxes. Unstable pay.

“My boss is a good man,” Bill once said, staring into his cup. “He apologizes every time payroll is late.”

“And is it ever on time?” Paul asked.

Bill smiled faintly.

“No.”

Respect didn’t pay rent.

Eventually, Paul found something else.

A company called Livanse.

High salary. Structured growth. Clear hierarchy.

The contract looked ordinary.

He signed it.

⸻

Ground Floor

The interview room was blindingly bright. High ceilings. Five people in tailored suits.

They asked about pressure.

About authority.

About loyalty.

About conflict.

Paul answered carefully.

He needed this.

“We appreciate your time,” they said in the end. “You have been selected.”

He was inside.

⸻

At first, everything felt manageable.

His supervisor, Robert Gindelberd, appeared calm and professional.

Paul worked quietly. Tried not to stand out.

Then he made a mistake in a report.

He didn’t notice it.

Robert did.

The next day, Robert addressed him in front of the entire team.

“A calculation error,” Robert repeated loudly. “In a company built on precision.”

The room fell silent.

“Perhaps numbers are too ambitious for you.”

Heat flooded Paul’s face.

“With respect,” Paul replied, louder than intended, “I corrected it before it caused damage.”

Silence.

Robert stared at him.

“Office. Now.”

⸻

Inside the office, the door shut.

Robert’s fist struck the desk.

“You think this is debate? This is structure. You either fit into it… or you disappear.”

The phone rang.

Robert answered.

“Yes.”

A pause.

“Yes. Understood.”

He set the receiver down.

“You’ve been reassigned,” he said calmly.

“To the First Floor.”

No explanation.

Just movement.

⸻

First Floor

The elevator opened to softer light. Wider desks. Cleaner air.

Sterile.

A short, elegant man approached.

“Paul, correct?” he asked warmly. “I’m Lewis White. Welcome.”

Work here was different.

Sharper.

Paul reviewed reports from employees below. Four per day. Faster pace. Higher standards.

Lewis never shouted.

He refined.

“Efficiency isn’t effort,” he explained. “Find contradictions first. Memorize patterns. People repeat themselves.”

Paul improved quickly.

He started analyzing instinctively.

Even outside work.

Especially Bill.

⸻

Bill eventually left the warehouse.

“My boss was kind,” he said one night. “But kind doesn’t fix payroll.”

“So you left.”

“I chose survival.”

Soon after, Bill joined Livanse.

“I mentioned you,” he admitted at the café. “Everything moved fast after that.”

“Structure,” Paul replied calmly.

“There it is again,” Bill muttered. “That tone.”

They let it go.

On the surface.

⸻

The elevator doors began opening mid-shift more often.

New faces.

Quiet transfers.

Advancement without celebration.

It became routine.

Paul stopped reacting.

Months passed.

He felt himself changing.

He no longer defended.

He evaluated.

Lewis once approached him.

“Your friend is performing exceptionally well. He may surpass you.”

The words lodged under Paul’s skin.

Later, during a review, Paul said lightly:

“Speed without depth isn’t sustainable.”

Bill stiffened.

Lewis watched.

⸻

At the end of the month, metrics were displayed.

Bill’s name was near the bottom.

One of the lowest.

“Rapid growth masks instability,” Lewis said calmly.

After the meeting, Bill approached.

“What happened?”

“You were inconsistent,” Paul replied evenly.

“You sound different,” Bill said.

Paul almost reacted.

Instead, he asked quietly:

“Coffee?”

“Not today.”

⸻

That night, Paul couldn’t sleep.

He replayed the meeting.

Bill’s face.

His own tone.

He couldn’t remember raising his voice.

That disturbed him more than the argument.

When did I stop defending him?

⸻

The next morning, Lewis stood beside his desk.

No smile.

“Join me.”

Inside the office, Lewis spoke evenly.

“You handled yesterday too directly.”

“I was honest.”

“Honesty without control becomes instability.”

Instability.

“We observe ambition,” Lewis said. “But we eliminate volatility.”

“It won’t happen again,” Paul replied.

Lewis’s faint smile returned.

“That’s what I needed to hear.”

⸻

Two days later, Paul was called in again.

Bill was already inside.

Lewis placed a folder on the desk.

“There is an opening on the Fourth Floor.”

Silence.

“Only one of you may advance.”

The folder slid forward.

“A termination recommendation would create the vacancy required.”

“And if we don’t?” Bill asked.

“You remain here.”

No threat.

Just structure.

Bill looked at Paul.

“We’re not doing that.”

Lewis turned.

“And you?”

Paul’s mind was clear.

Too clear.

He remembered the warehouse.

“Respect doesn’t pay rent.”

Bill had said that.

“This isn’t personal,” Paul said quietly.

“It’s structural.”

Bill stared at him.

“You’re choosing this?”

“I’m choosing movement.”

Silence.

“I won’t sign it,” Bill said.

Paul reached for the folder.

His hand didn’t shake.

Not because he felt nothing.

But because feeling no longer dictated direction.

He signed.

⸻

Outside the office, nothing had changed.

Same desks.

Same light.

Same quiet.

Bill walked past him without speaking.

Paul stood still.

Waiting to feel something overwhelming.

Regret.

Triumph.

Anything.

What he felt instead was something colder.

Relief.

And that frightened him.

Because it meant—

The system hadn’t broken him.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

There was something about him—calm, confident, with a smile that seemed to light up the room.

Our eyes met, and I felt a flutter in my chest. I decided to take a chance. “Hey… I don’t usually do this, but you seem… interesting,” I said, smiling.

He laughed softly, the kind of laugh that made your heart skip a beat. “Interesting, huh? I like that,” he replied, sliding into the seat across from me.

We talked for hours. He told me stories about his life, and I shared mine. I learned he was a trans man, and straight—but the conversation didn’t feel heavy or awkward. Instead, it was full of warmth, teasing, and those little sparks that made me lean in just a little closer than necessary.

There were moments when our hands brushed, and a shy smile would pass between us. Every laugh, every shared glance, made my chest feel tight in the best way. By the time we left the café, I realized something simple but profound: romance isn’t always about fireworks—it’s about feeling seen, heard, and alive when you’re with someone who truly catches your heart.",0,1771141053.0,transteens,1,0.33,False

Oh my god, she is an amazing texter and we connected in an instant. So we both were excited and had a Valentine's date together. I brought her chocolates and a Valentine's balloon, we got coffee and played a videogame at her place. She's so gorgeous and kind and we both want a 2nd date. Scheduling is kinda rough since I work a lot and I have to drive 50+ miles to see her, but it is what it do.

We kissed at the end of the date!!!

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

1r58dy3,https://www.reddit.com/r/livingfromtheend/comments/1r58dy3/stop_trying_to_speed_up_manifestation_its_already/,Stop Trying to Speed Up Manifestation (It’s Already Done),"Your manifestation has already happened.

That statement challenges almost everything the modern manifestation industry teaches. People are told to “speed it up,” “raise vibration,” “repeat for 21 days,” or “do it for 68 seconds.” But what if speed was never the issue?

What if manifestation has **always been instantaneous** and the only confusion has been about understanding how it unfolds?

Let’s break this down step by step.

  


**Your Manifestation Has Already Happened**

In the instant when you assume a state with genuine feeling, something decisive occurs.

Neville Goddard described it with surgical precision: the **bridge of incidents** forms completely in consciousness instantaneously.

The waiting? That is an illusion.

While someone is repeating empty affirmations and wondering when it will work, reality has already reorganized itself. People are executing roles they don’t even know they’re playing. Doors open and close in response to a dominant state of consciousness.

Every person encountered is “yourself pushed out.”

The teachings may use different language:

* Abraham calls it *the vortex.*
* Joe Dispenza calls it *the collapse of the wave function.*
* Vadim Zeland calls it *the space of variations.*

But they are pointing to the same principle:

**Everything completes itself instantaneously in consciousness before it appears in the physical.**

The bridge already exists. Now you are walking across it.

Stop looking for signs.

You are the sign.

  


**The Billion-Dollar Confusion**

The manifestation world has built an empire promising faster results:

* 24-hour techniques
* Miraculous scripting
* Revolutionary acceleration methods

But manifestation never needed acceleration.

It has always been instantaneous.

The real question was never about speed.

It has always been about understanding.

Neville Goddard revealed this decades ago. He called it the **bridge of incidents,** the series of events orchestrated by the universe connecting your current state to your desired state.

Here’s what most people miss:

The bridge does not take time to be built.

It forms in the moment you establish intention through assumed feeling.

  


**The Bridge of Incidents: Built in the Instant of Assumption**

Imagination is not fantasy.

According to Neville, imagination is the workshop of God operating through man. When you imagine with feeling, you are not pretending. You are activating the fundamental creative power of existence.

Manifestation happens on two planes simultaneously:

1. **The invisible causal plane** \- where everything occurs instantaneously.
2. **The visible physical plane** \- where events unfold sequentially through time.

Neville called the causal realm the *fourth dimension,* not a distant mystical place, but the realm of consciousness where past, present, and future coexist in the eternal now.

In that dimension, your intention doesn’t travel.

It simply is, complete in the moment of conception.

When someone affirms “I am rich” with genuine feeling, the bridge of incidents is already completely formed in consciousness.

The time required to cross it physically may vary.

But the structure already exists integrally.

You are not waiting for manifestation.

You are crossing the bridge.

  


**Divine Orchestration: How the Universe Rearranges Itself**

When the bridge forms, the universe mobilizes in ways beyond logical comprehension.

* A thousand people may play roles.
* A casual elevator encounter becomes pivotal.
* An unexpected email shifts direction.
* A sudden plan change across the world affects your outcome.

These are not random events.

They are precise links in a causal chain.

Neville taught that your assumption, even if initially false, if persisted in with feeling, will solidify into fact.

What’s rarely emphasized is this:

Solidification begins instantly.

Not after 21 days.  
Not after reaching a certain vibration.

In the exact moment of assumption with feeling.

If consciousness is the substance from which all experience emerges, then a change in consciousness produces a corresponding change in experience not as a possibility, but as a mathematical certainty.

The universe has no choice but to reorganize.

  


**All Teachers Are Saying the Same Thing**

Across traditions, the same truth appears:

* Neville Goddard - *Bridge of incidents*
* Abraham Hicks - *Universal orchestration / the vortex*
* Florence Scovel Shinn - *Strange channels of abundance*
* Joe Dispenza - *Quantum synchronicities*
* Vadim Zeland - *Space of variations*

Different vocabulary.

Same mechanism.

The moment genuine intention is established, the universe reorganizes itself to deliver the result through means the conscious mind could never architect.

The techniques differ:

* Neville uses sensory imagination.
* Abraham focuses on emotional alignment.
* Florence works with affirmations and decrees.
* Dispenza uses meditation and elevated emotion.
* Zeland emphasizes reduction of importance.

But all converge on one truth:

The critical moment is when intention is established with emotional conviction.

Everything else is commentary.

  


**Assume the Feeling of the Wish Fulfilled**

Neville’s operational formula is precise:

Assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled and observe the route that your desire takes to fulfill itself.

Assume.

Not wait.  
Not deserve.  
Not prepare.

Assume.

To assume is to occupy a state of consciousness with its own vibrational signature, thought patterns, and behaviors.

When you assume “I am rich,” you are inhabiting the psychological state of wealth.

Each state magnetizes its own confirmation.

The external world is not independent.

It is yourself pushed out.

People, circumstances, open doors, closed doors, all reflect your dominant state of consciousness.

When you change state, the frequency shifts.

People feel impulses to contact you.  
Opportunities appear.  
Resources emerge.

This is what Neville called **divine compulsion**.

Others believe they are making independent decisions.

But they are responding to shifts in your field of consciousness.

  


**Living in the Present: The Operational Mechanism**

Manifestations often arrive when someone is completely absorbed elsewhere.

The check arrives during an engaging project.  
The call comes during a hobby.  
The opportunity appears mid-conversation.

This isn’t coincidence.

Total presence deactivates resistance.

When you enter flow, deep work, creative immersion, full engagement, the conscious mind stops interfering.

This is **active presence**.

Sitting and waiting is passive presence.  
Being so immersed you forget you were manifesting, that is active presence.

Manifestation loves an attention vacuum.

It fills the space when the conscious mind is occupied.

The present moment is the only place power exists.

Past and future exist only as memory and projection, both happening now.

Without anxiety, there is no resistance.

Without resistance, manifestation flows like water down a mountain.

  


**The Biggest Saboteur: Overthinking**

The hyperactive mind has become the greatest saboteur of instantaneous manifestation.

Observe the obsessive cycle:

* Morning affirmations.
* Checking for signs at breakfast.
* Analyzing every interaction.
* Revising scripts at night.
* Listening to subliminals while sleeping.
* Waking to see if something changed.

This is not manifestation.

It is neurosis disguised as spirituality.

Excess effort transmits a message:

“I don’t have this.”

If someone truly believed something was theirs, they would not spend 16 hours trying to convince themselves.

The paradox is clear:

Manifestations often arrive when obsession is dropped.

Not the desire, the control.

  


**The Law of Detachment and Least Effort**

Neutral intention is key.

Order your desire the way you order coffee:

Calm. Natural. Undramatic.

Excess emotional charge complicates.

Nature demonstrates this law effortlessly:

* The seed does not struggle to become a tree.
* The river does not strain to reach the ocean.
* The sun does not force itself to rise.

The most powerful processes occur without apparent effort.

You can only receive what you don’t desperately need.

Wanting lightly allows movement.

Needing desperately creates paralysis.

  


**Walking the Bridge**

Once the bridge of incidents forms, there is one main direction: forward.

Yet many people:

* Walk halfway.
* Doubt.
* Sit in the middle.
* Turn back to try a new method.

They were meters from the other side.

Inspired action rarely looks related to the desire.

A random call.  
An odd impulse.  
A casual conversation.

The logical mind dismisses it.

But the bridge works through ordinary Tuesdays, small decisions, minor delays.

Not fireworks.

Not spectacle.

Just steady crossing.

  


**The Present: From Prison to Portal**

The present moment once seemed like a prison, something to escape.

Now it reveals itself as the portal.

Each fully inhabited moment is a step on the bridge.

You are not waiting.

You are crossing.

Every breath.  
Every choice.  
Every thought sustained with feeling.

Manifestation is not a future event.

It is a present process.

  


**The Final Synthesis**

Manifestation has always been instantaneous.

In the moment genuine intention is established, consciously or unconsciously, the bridge forms completely.

The destination becomes inevitable.

Only the crossing time varies.

Anxiety dissolves when this is understood.

You stop checking for signs because every moment is a sign.  
You stop accelerating because the perfect speed is already set.  
You stop doubting because the process never stopped.

Your only real choice is this:

Will you cross the bridge consciously, trusting each step?

Or will you sit in the middle, questioning whether bridges work?

The bridge already exists.

Keep walking.

1r58dcy,https://i.redd.it/dg3bj9di0mjg1.png,We All Lived Here Before - Chapter 1: The Architect,"This is Chapter 1 of [We All Lived Here Before](https://a.co/d/0caA5bHn), my debut horror novel now out on Amazon. If the story pulls you in, the full book is available in eBook, paperback, and hardcover.

# Chapter 1: The Architect

The call button lit up at 1:47 AM, silent as always. Room 247. I'd checked on Hal Pemberton forty minutes ago—vitals stable, sleeping the restless half-sleep of the dying. The morphine pump wasn't due for another hour. I finished charting and headed down the corridor, my shoes making soft percussion against linoleum under the fluorescent lights.

After eight years in hospice, I find the night shift comforting. The dying don't need cheerfulness at two in the morning. They need presence, and I'm good at being present.

Hal's door stood slightly ajar. I'd closed it when I left—I was certain of that. The hall light cut a wedge across his floor, illuminating the wheels of his portable IV stand, the corner of his bedside table where a water pitcher sat next to a photo of his late wife Margaret. I pushed the door wider.

 He sat upright in bed.

This shouldn't have been possible. Stage four lung cancer metastasized to his spine. Three months ago, when he'd arrived at Cascade Springs, the oncologist gave him weeks. That was twelve weeks ago. But here he sat, rail-thin frame perfectly vertical against the pillows, bald head catching the dim light from the hallway, those piercing blue eyes fixed on something in his lap.

""Mr. Pemberton?"" I kept my voice low, gentle. Sometimes the dying wake confused, frightened by their own bodies betraying them. ""Are you in pain?""

He didn't look up. His hands moved across a sheet of paper—the back of a menu from yesterday's dinner, I realized. His gnarled fingers, age-spotted and trembling from the Parkinson's that had complicated his final months, held a pen with impossible steadiness. Drawing. He was drawing with the precision of an architect at a drafting table, each line perfectly straight despite hands that shook when he tried to hold a coffee cup.

I moved closer, checking the morphine pump out of habit. Not due for another fifty-three minutes. The dosage hadn't been adjusted in two days. I glanced at the chart hanging from the foot of his bed, flipping through today's notes. No breakthrough pain medication. No sedatives. Nothing that would cause hallucinations or the kind of delirium I'd seen in terminal patients when the cancer reached their brains or the medication cocktail became too much for failing kidneys to process.

""The load-bearing walls,"" Hal said suddenly, his voice clearer than I'd heard it in weeks, ""are constructed from femur. The long bones, you understand. They have the tensile strength. The compression capacity."" He continued drawing without looking up, adding details to what I could now see was an architectural blueprint. ""The buttresses are rib cage. Curved, you see. Beautiful, really. The acoustics are perfect. Sound travels through bone differently than through stone or steel. Everything resonates.""

I pulled the visitor's chair closer to his bed, sat down so I could see his face. His eyes remained fixed on the paper, but they weren't glazed or distant. This wasn't the morphine dreams I'd seen in Sarah Chen six months ago, before she died describing impossible cities in her final delirium. This was different. Hal was lucid. Terrifyingly lucid.

""Mr. Pemberton,"" I said carefully, ""what are you drawing?""

""I don't know."" His pen never stopped moving, adding crosshatches to indicate texture, measurements in the margins written in his engineer's shorthand. ""I've never seen this building. But I built it. I know I built it. I can remember the weight of the bones in my hands. The way we fitted them together. The sound they made when we set them in place."" He finally looked up at me, and the fear in his eyes made my chest tighten. ""I worked on the 747 program for forty years, Elena. I know aircraft. I know aluminum and rivets and stress points on wings. I don't know this. How do I know this?""

The drawing was remarkable. Even with my limited understanding of engineering, I could see the mathematical precision. Structural elements that supported each other in ways that looked impossible but somehow made sense. The building rose in a spiral pattern, walls curving inward and upward, creating chambers that nested inside one another like a nautilus shell.

""Have you been reading about architecture?"" I asked, knowing the question was absurd even as I said it. Hal could barely hold a book anymore. His daughters had stopped visiting. He spent his days sleeping or watching the news with the sound off, occasionally asking for ice chips.

""I've never been an architect."" His hands started shaking now, the pen rattling against the paper. The spell, whatever it was, was breaking. ""I built planes. I understand aerodynamics and metal fatigue and how to calculate fuel-to-weight ratios. I don't understand this."" He grabbed my wrist suddenly, his grip surprisingly strong for a dying man. His fingers felt like bird bones wrapped in parchment, but they held on with desperate urgency. ""How did I build this, Elena? How do I remember building this?""

I should have pulled away. Professional boundaries. But something in his eyes stopped me—not aggression or confusion, but a plea for witness. He needed someone to confirm this was happening, that he wasn't disappearing into dementia.

""I don't know,"" I admitted, which was the truth. In eight years of hospice nursing, I'd seen terminal lucidity, the brief return of clarity before death. I'd seen patients rally for a final goodbye, speak languages they'd forgotten since childhood, remember people they'd claimed not to recognize for years. The brain, failing, sometimes opens doors that stayed closed in health. But this was something else.

Hal released my wrist and went back to drawing, filling in details with mechanical precision. I watched his hands move—those Parkinson's-trembling hands that couldn't hold a fork steady, now drawing lines that would make a draftsman weep with envy. It was as if something else guided them, something that knew exactly what it was doing.

""Tell me about it,"" I said, falling back on my training. Active listening. Create space for the patient to process their experience. ""Describe what you're drawing.""

""A city."" He added what looked like windows—no, not windows. Openings. Deliberate gaps in the bone structure that would allow air flow. ""Underground. It has to be underground, you see. The surface was too dangerous. Predators. We needed to go deep, where the stone would protect us."" He paused, pen hovering. ""We. I keep saying we. Why do I keep saying we?""

The fluorescent lights hummed their constant note, that sound that lives in every hospital corridor, every hospice facility, every place where the lights never fully turn off because death doesn't keep business hours. I could smell the familiar mix of institutional cleaner and hand sanitizer, and underneath it, the sweet-sick smell that clings to the dying no matter how often we change their sheets. The building settled around us, pipes ticking, the ventilation system breathing.

""The walls curve for a reason,"" Hal continued, his voice taking on a lecturer's cadence, that tone he must have used when training new engineers at Boeing. ""Straight walls create stress points. Curved walls distribute the load. And bone, you see, bone already knows these shapes. Femurs curve. Skulls curve. Ribs curve. We weren't imposing geometry on the material. We were following what the material already knew.""

I leaned closer to examine the blueprint. The details were extraordinary. Cross-sections showing how the bones interlocked. Annotations about weight distribution. Calculations for the square footage of each chamber. This wasn't the fantasy architecture of a fevered mind—this was engineered. This was meant to stand, to bear weight, to house people.

""How many stories?"" I asked.

""Levels,"" he corrected absently. ""We called them levels, not stories. Thirty-seven levels. Spiraling down. The lowest level touches the aquifer. We needed water, you see. Everything we needed had to be inside. Once you went down, you stayed down. The surface wasn't safe.""

""When did you build this?"" The question felt absurd, but he'd spoken of it in past tense, as if it were memory rather than imagination.

Hal's pen stopped. His hands began trembling again, the shake he couldn't control. He looked at the blueprint, then at his hands, then at me. ""I don't know. I wasn't... I didn't..."" He pressed his palms against his eyes. When he spoke again, his voice was smaller, older, the voice of a seventy-eight-year-old man dying of cancer. ""I'm going crazy. The cancer's in my brain. It has to be in my brain.""

""Your last MRI was clean,"" I reminded him gently. ""No metastases to your brain. Dr. Okoye went over the results with you last week.""

""Then what is this?"" He thrust the paper at me. ""I'm remembering things I never learned. Building things I never built. Speaking—"" He stopped, his breath catching.

""Speaking what?""

He opened his mouth, and words came out that weren't English. Not Spanish, not French, not any language I recognized from the hospital's translation services. The syllables were harsh and guttural, ancient-sounding, consonants that seemed to come from the back of his throat. He spoke three words, maybe four, then stopped, his hand flying to his mouth as if he could catch the sounds and push them back in.

We sat in silence for a long moment. His breathing was ragged, the rattle of fluid in his lungs more pronounced now that he'd been sitting up for so long. I should encourage him to lie down, to rest. I should document this episode in his chart. I should page Dr. Okoye, even at this hour, because something was happening that fell outside the normal parameters of dying.

Instead, I took the blueprint from his hands and studied it more carefully. The paper was covered in his engineer's handwriting, precise and measured. Measurements in meters, not feet. Ratios expressed in numbers that felt wrong to my American eye. The whole thing read like it had been designed by someone using a different system, a different framework of thought.

""The acoustics,"" I said, pointing to an annotation. ""You mentioned the acoustics are perfect. Perfect for what?""

Hal looked at the blueprint like he was seeing it for the first time. ""For singing. For the voices."" He touched the paper with one trembling finger. ""We sang while we worked. It was important. The resonance helped us. Helped the bones settle into place. Sound and bone, you see. They work together. The marrow... the marrow remembers the songs.""

My skin prickled. This was beyond terminal lucidity, beyond the strange poetry that sometimes emerged from dying minds. This was specific, detailed, impossible knowledge. I thought of Sarah Chen, six months ago, describing cities made of bone while the pancreatic cancer destroyed her from the inside. I'd dismissed it as morphine dreams, the kind thing families tell each other when their loved ones start talking about the afterlife or the dead come to visit.

But Sarah had been on morphine. Hal wasn't.

""Mr. Pemberton, I need to ask you something. Have you talked to other patients here? About... about building? About bones?""

He shook his head slowly. ""I don't talk to anyone. My daughters don't visit. Margaret's been dead five years. I just sit here and wait."" He looked down at his hands, at the drawings scattered across his lap. ""I didn't mean to draw this. I woke up and my hands were moving. Like they remembered what to do. Like they'd done this before.""

I gathered the papers carefully, shuffling through them. There were three sheets in total, all covered in the same precise architectural renderings. Buildings that spiraled downward. Chambers connected by corridors. And on every sheet, in the corner like a signature, the same symbol: a spiral pattern that hurt to look at, the way optical illusions make your eyes try to follow a loop that never resolves.

""I'm going to keep these,"" I said. ""Document them. Is that all right?""

Hal nodded. ""I don't want them. I don't want to remember this."" But his hands were already reaching for another piece of paper on his bedside table, the pen clicking in his grip. ""I can't stop. Even when I close my eyes, I see it. The city. The bone city. And I remember..."" His voice cracked. ""I remember being there. Not visiting. Not as Harold Pemberton, Boeing engineer, husband of Margaret, father of three. I remember being part of it. One of the builders. One of thousands. We were—"" He stopped, his whole body going rigid.

""Mr. Pemberton?""

His eyes had gone distant, unfocused. For a moment I thought he was having a stroke, a seizure, something medical that I could understand and treat. But his vitals were stable. His pupils responded when I shone my penlight. He was there, present in his body, just looking at something I couldn't see.

When he spoke again, his voice had changed. Not louder, but layered somehow, as if he were speaking in harmony with himself. ""We weren't always what we are now. We were something else before. Something older. We lived underground, built our cities from ourselves, from what we left behind when we died. Every bone a brick. Every body a contribution. We were—""

""Mr. Pemberton."" I touched his shoulder, grounding him. ""You're at Cascade Springs. You're in your room. It's 2:15 in the morning.""

He blinked, and his eyes cleared. The normal Hal returned—frightened, dying, alone. ""I'm sorry. I don't know what... I didn't mean to..."" He slumped back against his pillows, suddenly exhausted, the energy that had kept him upright draining away. ""I'm so tired, Elena. I'm so tired and I can't stop remembering things I never knew.""

I helped him settle into a more comfortable position, adjusted his oxygen, checked the morphine pump even though I knew it was fine. Basic nursing tasks, things I could do with my hands while my mind tried to process what I'd just witnessed. Hal's breathing evened out, the rattle in his lungs finding a rhythm. His eyes closed, but his hands kept twitching, fingers tracing invisible patterns on the blanket.

""Try to rest,"" I said, though I knew it was useless advice. How do you rest when your mind is filling with memories that aren't yours? When you're building cities in your sleep that never existed in your waking life?

As I moved toward the door, Hal spoke one more time, his voice already thick with approaching sleep. ""The spiral. It's important. The pattern. It's how you... how we..."" He trailed off, the words dissolving into unconsciousness.

I stood in the doorway, the blueprints clutched in my hands, and looked back at him. In the dim light from the hall, he looked like any other dying patient—frail, small, disappearing into the white sheets. Just an old man whose body was giving up after seventy-eight years of carrying him through life. Nothing remarkable. Nothing impossible.

Except for the drawings. Except for the languages he shouldn't know. Except for the absolute certainty in his voice when he said he'd built something he'd never seen.

I pulled the door partially closed and walked back to the nurses' station, my mind cataloging details the way I'd been trained. Document everything. Note any unusual behaviors. Be specific, be clinical, be thorough. But how do you document this? How do you chart ""patient demonstrates knowledge of extinct languages and architectural principles from pre-historical periods""?

The hall was empty, the other patients sleeping or resting or waiting out the long hours until dawn. I sat down at my workstation and pulled out my personal journal—not the official patient charts, but the notebook I kept for myself, where I recorded the things that mattered beyond vital signs and medication schedules. Every hospice nurse has one. A place to remember the last words, the final gestures, the small dignities and defeats that happen in the hours before death.

I started to write about Hal, about the drawings, about the impossible precision of his hands when they should have been trembling. But as I wrote, something else rose up in my memory. Sarah Chen. Six months ago. The week before she died.

Sarah had drawn too. I'd found the sketches in her room after her daughter Jennifer came to collect her things. Abstract patterns, I'd thought at the time. The wandering lines of a mind coming untethered. But now...

I opened my desk drawer, pulled out the folder where I kept copies of things that mattered. There, tucked between condolence cards and memorial service programs, were three sketches Sarah's daughter had left behind. Photocopies, not the originals. I laid them next to Hal's blueprints.

The same spiral pattern. The same architectural precision. The same impossible curves that suggested depth, underground structures, chambers spiraling downward into earth.

My hands went cold.

Two patients. Six months apart. Different cancers, different demographics, different everything. Harold Pemberton, white, male, seventy-eight, retired engineer. Sarah Chen, Chinese-American, female, sixty-seven, librarian. Nothing connected them except this: they were dying, and in dying, they were remembering the same thing.

I thought about calling Dr. Okoye, but what would I say? I had drawings and a dying man speaking in tongues. I had my own unease, the prickling certainty that something was wrong, but no medical basis for that certainty. In hospice, we see strange things. The dying brain does strange things. Terminal lucidity is documented. Deathbed visions are common across cultures.

But this felt different.

I looked at the drawings again, really looked. The spiral symbol in the corner of each page seemed to pulse in my vision, an optical effect of staring too long at intersecting curves. I blinked, rubbed my eyes. When I looked again, the feeling persisted—the sense that the pattern was trying to show me something, teach me something, pull me somewhere.

I closed the folder and locked it in my desk drawer. 3:17 AM. The night stretched ahead, full of other patients who needed checking, other medications to dispense, other small comforts to provide. The work of shepherding the dying through their final days, their final hours. It's what I'd chosen. What I was good at.

But as I made my rounds through the quiet halls, checking on Mrs. Kowalski in 251, adjusting Mr. Johnson's pillow in 239, I couldn't shake the image of Hal's hands moving with impossible precision. Couldn't unhear those words in a language that had been dead for millennia.

Proto-Indo-European, I realized later, after I'd googled the phonemes I could remember. The reconstructed ancestor of most European languages, a dead tongue that no living person should be able to speak fluently because we only know it from linguistic reconstruction, from piecing together fragments.

No one speaks Proto-Indo-European. No one living.

But Harold Pemberton, retired Boeing engineer, dying of lung cancer, had spoken it as naturally as if it were his first language.

I returned to room 247 at 4:30 AM to check his vitals one more time before the shift change. He was sleeping peacefully, his breathing shallow but regular. The pen had rolled off his lap onto the floor. His hands lay still on the blanket, those bird-bone fingers finally at rest.

On his bedside table, another drawing. He'd started it in his sleep, the pen marks trailing off into nothing as unconsciousness claimed him. But the first few lines were there, unmistakable: another chamber, another level of the spiral city, descending deeper into earth.

I picked up the paper carefully, added it to my collection, and stood watch over him in the predawn darkness. Outside, Bellingham was beginning to wake. Coffee shops opening, early commuters starting their cars, the world going about its ordinary business. But in room 247, something extraordinary was unfolding—a dying man remembering a life he never lived, building cities with bones, speaking the languages of the dead.

And I was the only one who had seen it. The only witness to whatever was happening in Harold Pemberton's failing mind.

I didn't know yet that this was only the beginning. That in the weeks to come, more patients would start drawing, start remembering, start speaking in voices that weren't quite their own. I didn't know that Sarah Chen's last words to me—""You'll remember too. We all will""—were prophecy, not delirium.

All I knew, standing in that darkened room at 4:43 AM, was that something impossible was happening. And as a hospice nurse, as someone who had dedicated her life to understanding death, I was going to document it. I was going to bear witness.

Even if no one believed me.

Even if I didn't quite believe myself.

The sun rose over Cascade Springs at 6:52 AM, and I went home to my empty rental house, fed my cat Bones, and lay awake staring at the ceiling. In my mind, I kept seeing those spirals, those impossible buildings, those bones fitted together with cathedral precision.

And I kept hearing Hal's voice, layered and strange, speaking words from the depths of human history: \*We weren't always what we are now.\*",1,1771140039.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

I'm writing this at 2 AM because I can't sleep. Again. 

I just realized I've spent the last 5 years making excuses. ""I'll start eating better next week."" ""I'll join a gym after this project."" ""I don't have time for meal prep."" Sound familiar?

Meanwhile, I'm exhausted by 2 PM every day, I've gained 30 pounds, and I can't remember the last time I felt genuinely \*good\* in my own body.

Here's what hit me tonight:

I spend more time researching which Netflix show to watch than I do researching what I put in my body. That's insane.

So I'm done. Not in a ""January 1st resolution"" way that dies by February. I mean actually done with the excuses.

My reality check stats:

Sleep: 4-6 hours a night (mostly terrible quality)

Water intake: Maybe 2 glasses a day (mostly coffee)

 Exercise: Does walking to my car count?

Vegetables: Um... do fries count? (I know they don't)

Energy level: 3/10 on a good day

What I'm committing to:

I'm not going to pretend I'm going to transform overnight. No crash diets. No ""I'll work out 2 hours every day"" BS that lasts 3 days.

Starting small and realistic:

1. Week 1-2:Fix my sleep schedule (7-8 hours, no screens 1 hour before bed)

2. Week 3-4:Drink actual water (goal: 6-8 glasses daily)

3. Week 5-6:Add one real vegetable to every meal

4. Week 7-8:Move my body 20 minutes a day (walking counts)

1r583zx,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrivacyCompass/comments/1r583zx/best_cheapest_vpn_services/,Best Cheapest VPN Services,"Look, I spent $47 on a VPN last month. Not because I'm rolling in cash. Because I made the rookie mistake of clicking ""subscribe"" on a monthly plan without checking the math.

Three days later, I discovered the exact same service costs $1.99 per month if you commit for two years. Same servers, same encryption, same everything—just $23.88 instead of nearly $600 over two years.

Yeah. I felt like an idiot.

So I spent the last month digging through pricing schemes, testing budget providers, and wading through Reddit threads where people actually tell the truth about cheap VPNs (unlike most review sites that just regurgitate marketing copy). And here's what nobody tells you upfront: the VPN industry's pricing model is designed to confuse you into overpaying.

But some budget options are genuinely solid. Others are cheap for a reason—as in, they're logging your data and selling it to advertisers cheap.

Let me show you the difference.

# The Real Cost of ""Cheap"" VPNs in 2026

Monthly plans run $9-16 on average. Sounds reasonable, right?

Here's the trap. Those same providers charge $2-4 per month if you lock in for a year or two. We're talking 75-87% discounts just for committing upfront. According to recent VPN pricing analyses, long-term subscriptions can drop costs from $12.99/month down to as low as $1.99/month—that's the same service for literally one-sixth the price.

And I'm not talking about sketchy no-name providers. NordVPN, Surfshark, ProtonVPN—all the ones Reddit actually trusts—play this exact pricing game.

But here's where it gets interesting. Not everyone should buy a 2-year plan. Sometimes monthly actually makes sense (I'll explain when). And there's one provider that charges the same rate whether you pay monthly or commit for a decade, which sounds insane until you understand their business model.

# What Makes a VPN ""Cheap"" Without Being Garbage?

Before we dive into specific providers, let's establish what separates a legitimate budget VPN from a privacy nightmare dressed up as a deal.

**The non-negotiables:**

`AES-256` encryption or equivalent. Anything less and you might as well browse without a VPN—it's security theater. This is the same standard banks use, and there's a reason for that. Look for VPNs that use AES-256, the current standard in encryption, to ensure your data is properly protected.

`WireGuard` protocol support. As of early 2026, this is basically table stakes. OpenVPN still works, but WireGuard is faster, more efficient, and has a cleaner codebase that's easier to audit. WireGuard is now a mature, secure networking tunnel that has become the industry standard for modern VPN connections. If a provider doesn't offer it, they're behind the curve.

Actual no-logs policy. And I don't mean marketing fluff—I mean independently audited by a third party who published their findings. Too many ""no-logs"" claims evaporate the moment law enforcement shows up with a warrant.

Kill switch that actually works. I tested this by intentionally disconnecting mid-session. Some VPNs took 3+ seconds to cut traffic, which is enough time to leak your real IP address to whatever you're accessing. That defeats the entire purpose.

**The nice-to-haves that separate good from great:**

Unlimited simultaneous connections (or at least 5+). Because protecting one device in 2026 is like locking your front door while leaving all the windows open.

Servers in at least 50+ countries. More locations = better speeds and more unblocking options for geo-restricted content.

30-day money-back guarantee. Basically a free trial if you're willing to jump through the refund hoops.

Now let's talk about what you actually sacrifice when you go budget.

# The Tradeoffs: What You Lose (And What You Don't)

I tested seven budget VPNs over the last month, connecting from coffee shops, airports, and my apartment in three different cities. Here's what actually matters versus what's just marketing noise.

**Speed:** This one surprised me. Surfshark, already mentioned under the cheap category, also gets nods from users who love its ease of use, and in my testing it hit 450 Mbps on a WireGuard connection—that's faster than some ""premium"" providers charging three times as much. Budget doesn't automatically mean slow anymore.

**Server count:** Yeah, cheap VPNs usually have fewer servers. Mullvad operates a measly server network compared to our top-pick VPNs with 700+ servers located in 49 countries. But unless you need a server in obscure locations like Uzbekistan for specific geo-unblocking, this rarely matters for everyday use.

**Streaming:** This is where budget options struggle. Netflix, BBC iPlayer, Disney+—these platforms wage constant war against VPN IPs. Premium providers can afford to constantly refresh their IP pools. Budget ones? Hit or miss. We tried several Mullvad servers outside the U.S., and every single one of them was blocked by those streaming platforms.

**Customer support:** Don't expect 24/7 live chat. Most budget providers offer email support with response times measured in hours, not minutes. If you're tech-savvy enough to troubleshoot basic connection issues yourself, this won't bother you. If you need hand-holding, pay more.

**The stuff that doesn't change:** Encryption strength, privacy policies, protocol options—these are the same whether you pay $2/month or $12/month within the same provider's tier structure. You're not getting ""worse"" security by choosing a long-term plan. You're getting the exact same service for less money because they want predictable revenue.

# The Absolute Cheapest: What $2/Month Actually Buys

Let's cut through the marketing and look at what you actually get at different price points in early 2026.

|Provider|Monthly Price|2-Year Price|Devices|Servers|Key Differentiator|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Surfshark**|$15.45|$1.99/mo|Unlimited|3,200+|Best all-around value ✅|
|**PIA**|\~$12|$1.98/mo|Unlimited|1,000s|Proven no-logs (court-tested)|
|**PrivadoVPN**|$10.99|$1.11/mo|10|300+|Absolute cheapest 🔥|
|**NordVPN**|$12.99|$2.99/mo|10|8,200+|Best speeds & features|
|**ProtonVPN**|$9.99|$2.99/mo|10|17,800+|Swiss privacy jurisdiction|
|**Mullvad**|€5 (\~$5.38)|€5 (\~$5.38)|5|700+|Same price always ⚡|
|**CyberGhost**|\~$13|$2.03/mo|7|11,000+|Huge server network|
|**IPVanish**|$12.99|$2.19/mo|Unlimited|2,400+|Great for torrenting|

*All pricing verified as of February 2026*

Here's what jumps out from actual testing, not spec sheets:

**Surfshark** is the Reddit darling for a reason. Surfshark is another top VPN that Redditors recommend as it provides quality services for budget-friendly prices. Unlimited devices means you can protect your laptop, phone, tablet, smart TV, and your paranoid friend's devices all on one account. The `CleanWeb` ad-blocker actually works (blocks about 80% of ads in my testing), and the `MultiHop` feature routes your connection through two servers instead of one if you're feeling extra paranoid.

But—and this is important—Surfshark's monthly price is absurd at $15.45. Only commit if you're going long-term.

**PIA (Private Internet Access)** has something most budget VPNs don't: a proven track record. A lot of Redditors choose PIA for its customizable encryption options and its proven no-logs policy, backed by court cases. They've been subpoenaed multiple times and literally had nothing to hand over because they weren't logging. That's not marketing—that's court documents you can read yourself.

The downside? The interface feels like it was designed in 2015. Because it basically was. If you care more about function than form, this won't bother you.

**PrivadoVPN** is the actual cheapest at $1.11/month, but you're committing to 27 months upfront ($30 total). The catch? PrivadoVPN is the cheapest VPN on this list, with prices of just $1.11 per month for a two-year subscription ($30 upfront for 27 months' coverage). Smaller server network (300+), less name recognition, and limited streaming support. Great for basic privacy on public WiFi. Terrible if you want to unblock international Netflix libraries.

# Mullvad: The Contrarian Choice That Makes Zero Business Sense

Mullvad charges €5 per month. Every month. Forever.

No discounts for annual plans. No promotional pricing. No ""lock in now before rates go up."" Our price hasn't changed since, well, ever! We're still offering privacy at the same rate as when we launched in 2009. Same €5 they charged in 2009, adjusted for currency fluctuations.

This is either the worst business model ever conceived or the most honest pricing in the VPN industry, depending on your perspective.

Here's why some people swear by Mullvad: You can sign up without an email address. You can pay by literally mailing them cash in an envelope. Mullvad is one of those VPNs that seems to have been founded out of a deep, abiding belief in the right to privacy. It's the only paid VPN you can sign up for without an email address, it lets you pay by sending an envelope of cash. They accept cryptocurrency at a 10% discount because it costs them less to process. Their apps are fully open-source. They've passed multiple third-party security audits.

This is a VPN built by privacy nerds for privacy nerds.

The tradeoffs? Still, being unable to access streaming sites like Netflix, Hulu, Disney+ and BBC iPlayer eliminates a popular use case for many VPN users. Streaming is terrible—basically every major platform blocks their IPs. Customer support is email-only and slow. The server network is small at 700+ locations.

But if your threat model is ""I don't want my ISP, government, or random coffee shop hackers seeing what I do online"" rather than ""I need to watch UK Netflix from Kansas,"" Mullvad is unbeatable at its price point for actual privacy.

**When Mullvad makes sense:** You're paying month-to-month anyway (€5 beats $10-15). You prioritize verifiable privacy over streaming. You don't need 24/7 support. You're comfortable with slightly more technical setup.

**When it doesn't:** You want to unblock streaming services. You need a massive server network. You prefer yearly commitments for the discount (because Mullvad doesn't offer one).

# NordVPN: Is ""Premium"" Really Worth 50% More?

NordVPN costs $2.99/month on a 2-year plan. That's technically budget territory, but it's 50% more expensive than Surfshark or PIA.

So what do you actually get for that extra buck fifty per month?

**Speed.** Holy crap, the speed. I ran the same test on the same Frankfurt server at 2 AM (when my ISP actually delivers advertised speeds) across five VPNs. NordVPN: Killed traffic in 0.2 seconds. Nothing leaked. NordVPN hit 450 Mbps download consistently—every single test landed between 445-455 Mbps. That kind of consistency is rare. Surfshark bounced between 320-455 Mbps, which is still good but unpredictable.

**Features.** The `Threat Protection Pro` feature blocks malware, phishing attempts, and intrusive ads at the network level. Surfshark is a no-logs VPN that has had their no-logs status confirmed by a third-party audit—both providers have been audited, but NordVPN's feature set is deeper. Dark Web Monitoring scans breach databases for your email. Meshnet lets you create your own encrypted network. None of this is essential, but it's nice.

**Streaming.** According to this best cheap VPN Reddit, Surfshark prices start at a low $2.49/mo, but Many Reddit users indicated that NordVPN provides the fastest speeds necessary for a buffer-free streaming experience. In my testing, NordVPN unblocked Netflix US, UK, Japan, and Canada without breaking a sweat. BBC iPlayer worked flawlessly. Disney+ didn't even flinch.

**The catch:** You only save money on the 2-year plan ($80.73 upfront). The monthly plan is $12.99, which is highway robbery for basically the same service you can get elsewhere for less. And after your 2-year promotional period ends? After the introductory discount ends, a one-year NordVPN Basic plan renews at around $139.08 per year, which is significantly higher than the initial discounted price. Set a calendar reminder to cancel and shop around before auto-renewal hits.

>**Real talk:** If you need reliable streaming and don't mind paying an extra $1.50/month averaged over two years, NordVPN delivers. If you're just protecting your connection on public WiFi and don't care about Netflix Japan, save the money and go with Surfshark or PIA.

# ProtonVPN: The Switzerland Card

ProtonVPN costs $9.99 monthly (best among major providers) or $2.99/month on a 2-year plan. Proton VPN is a highly regarded VPN provider that features in many of our guides. It focuses mainly on privacy.

The pitch: Based in Switzerland (outside Five Eyes/Nine Eyes surveillance alliances). Run by the team behind ProtonMail (which Edward Snowden uses). Open-source apps audited by third parties. `Secure Core` routing that bounces your connection through privacy-friendly countries before exiting to your destination.

This is privacy theater that's actually backed by Swiss privacy laws, which are legitimately strong.

In my testing, speeds were competitive with NordVPN (380-420 Mbps on WireGuard). Streaming worked for most major platforms. The free tier offers unlimited bandwidth (rare among free VPNs), making it actually useful for testing.

**The weird part:** Proton VPN is another oft-mentioned and trustworthy secure VPN service in Reddit circles, but some Reddit users report it's slower than Mullvad despite Mullvad having fewer servers. I didn't experience this, but enough people mention it that it's worth flagging.

**Choose ProtonVPN if:** Swiss jurisdiction matters to your threat model. You want the peace of mind that comes with true privacy-first engineering. You might use the free tier before committing to paid.

**Skip it if:** You're purely focused on getting the cheapest option that works. Surfshark offers similar speeds and features for $1.99/month vs $2.99/month.

# The Free VPN Trap (And Why 28% of People Still Fall For It)

Despite security risks, 28% of users rely on free VPN options. That number should terrify you.

Free VPNs make money somehow. The options are:

**Selling your browsing data to advertisers.** Congratulations, you just paid a VPN to spy on you better than your ISP could.

**Injecting ads into your browsing sessions.** Those banner ads on websites that don't normally have them? Yeah, your ""free VPN"" is modifying HTML in transit to monetize your traffic.

**Using your device as an exit node.** Some free VPNs turn your connection into part of their network, meaning other users' traffic routes through your IP address. Enjoy explaining to your ISP why your connection is torrenting North Korean propaganda at 3 AM.

**Mining cryptocurrency on your device.** Less common now, but it happens.

**Selling premium upgrades aggressively.** This is the *least* sketchy option, but most free tiers are deliberately crippled (500 MB/day data caps, 1 server location, speeds throttled to dialup levels) to make the free experience miserable enough that you upgrade.

Many free apps track usage or browsing patterns to serve ads or insights. That's the opposite of private. The entire concept of a ""free privacy tool"" is contradictory unless there's a sustainable business model behind it.

**The one exception:** ProtonVPN's free tier. It's genuinely free (no data caps), genuinely doesn't log or sell data, and exists as a loss leader to get you into their ecosystem of paid products (ProtonMail, ProtonDrive, ProtonPass). Speeds are deliberately throttled and you only get access to a handful of server locations, but it's legitimate.

Every other free VPN I tested in early 2026 violated at least one of my privacy red flags. Most violated multiple.

# Monthly vs Long-Term: When Each Actually Makes Sense

The VPN industry desperately wants you to commit to multi-year plans. If you opt for the longest subscription period, which is usually two years, your average monthly cost for a VPN connection might drop by up to 70% compared to the monthly subscription price. But there are legitimate scenarios where monthly makes more sense.

**Go monthly if:**

You're traveling for 1-3 months and need temporary privacy. Paying $30-40 total beats dropping $80-100 upfront for two years of service you won't use.

You're testing multiple VPNs before committing. Even with money-back guarantees, some people prefer to just pay month-to-month for a few providers, test them in real-world scenarios, then commit long-term to the winner.

You're not sure you'll even like using a VPN. Some people find the speed trade-offs annoying or discover they don't actually need one for their threat model.

You have the cash flow to absorb $10-15/month but not $80-100 upfront. Yeah, the math says long-term is cheaper, but if that upfront payment would stress your budget, monthly is fine.

**Go long-term if:**

You know you'll use a VPN consistently. If you're committing to always-on VPN usage (smart in 2026), locking in $2-3/month for two years is a no-brainer.

You want the absolute lowest per-month cost. VPN pricing depends heavily on how long you're willing to commit. Monthly plans typically cost $9-$16, while long-term subscriptions can drop to $1.59-$4 per month. That's genuine savings, not marketing trickery.

The provider offers a solid money-back guarantee (30+ days). You can test for a month, decide if you like it, and refund if not. You've basically converted a long-term plan into a risk-free extended trial.

**The math nobody talks about:** Even if you only use a 2-year VPN subscription for 6 months before canceling, you've likely spent less than buying 6 individual monthly plans. Surfshark at $1.99/month for 24 months is $47.76 upfront. If you cancel after 6 months, you've spent $47.76 for 6 months of service—that's $7.96/month effective rate. Still way cheaper than the $15.45/month they charge for monthly plans.

# Security Red Flags: When ""Cheap"" Becomes ""Dangerous""

Not all budget VPNs are created equal. Some are genuinely good value. Others are privacy nightmares disguised as deals.

Here's what I watch for:

**Logging policies that contradict themselves.** ""We have a strict no-logs policy!"" (Homepage) vs ""We may collect connection timestamps, bandwidth usage, and IP addresses"" (Privacy policy, page 47). If you have to hunt through legal documents to understand what they log, assume they log everything.

**Jurisdiction in countries with mandatory data retention laws.** A Chinese VPN company claiming they don't log is asking you to trust them more than their own government. Same with any country that legally requires ISPs to retain user data—VPNs operating there are subject to the same laws.

**Outdated encryption protocols.** If `PPTP` or `L2TP` are offered as options in 2026, run. PPTP was cracked over a decade ago. It's security theater. WireGuard post-quantum encryption (launched in January 2026) is designed to resist future quantum computing attacks—this is where the industry is heading, not backwards to protocols from 2005.

**No independent audits.** Anyone can claim ""military-grade encryption"" and ""strict no-logs policy."" Paying a third-party security firm to audit your infrastructure and publish results? That costs money and requires confidence in your own systems. Providers who skip this step are asking you to trust their marketing.

**Unlimited free tiers.** I mentioned this earlier but it bears repeating: truly free, unlimited VPNs with no strings attached don't exist. Someone is paying for those servers, and if it's not you, you're not the customer—you're the product being sold.

**DNS/IP leaks.** I test every VPN with `ipleak.net` and `dnsleaktest.com` before recommending it. Shocking how many ""cheap"" providers leak your real IP or DNS requests, completely defeating the purpose of using a VPN. Our native IP address from Belgrade was concealed, and only the US IP and DNS addresses came up in the results—this is what a working VPN looks like in testing.

>**Quick test:** Connect to your VPN, visit `ipleak.net`. Your real IP address should be completely hidden and replaced with the VPN server's IP. If you see your actual location or ISP, the VPN is leaking and worthless.

# The 2026 Threat Environment (Why This Matters More Now)

VPN pricing discussions usually ignore the elephant in the room: the actual threats have gotten sophisticated as hell.

With cyber attacks in the U.S. reaching 859,532 reported incidents in 2024 – a 144% increase since 2018—this isn't theoretical anymore. And the attack vectors have evolved beyond script kiddies with Wi-Fi Pineapples at Starbucks.

**AI-powered phishing** is disturbingly good in 2026. I'm talking attacks that analyze your writing style from public social media posts and craft emails that sound exactly like your boss or your bank's fraud department. A VPN won't stop you from clicking a malicious link, but it prevents the attacker from immediately geolocating you or linking the click to your real IP address.

**Quantum computing** isn't breaking encryption overnight, but WireGuard post-quantum encryption (launched in January 2026) is designed to resist future quantum computing attacks. The ""harvest now, decrypt later"" threat is real—bad actors are collecting encrypted traffic today with the assumption they'll be able to crack it in 5-10 years when quantum computers mature. Providers adding quantum-resistant key exchange aren't being paranoid; they're being realistic.

**ISP surveillance and data selling** is legal in most jurisdictions. Your ISP sees everything. They know you visit medical websites, they know you torrent files, and they know you stream 4K video at 8 PM every night. They package this metadata and sell it to advertisers. A VPN breaks that surveillance, but only if the VPN itself isn't also logging and selling your data—which brings us full circle to why choosing a trustworthy provider matters more than saving $1/month.

**Man-in-the-middle attacks on public WiFi** remain the easiest way to intercept credentials. One of the most common attack vectors in 2026 remains the man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack. Coffee shops, airports, hotels—any public WiFi is essentially handing your traffic to whoever's within radio range and knows how to use Wireshark. VPNs encrypt that traffic end-to-end, making interception useless.

But here's what VPNs *don't* protect against: phishing, malware, social engineering, account takeovers via credential stuffing, or any attack that doesn't involve intercepting network traffic. Does a VPN protect against malware? No, it doesn't. A VPN encrypts data in transit. It does not scan that data for malicious code. A VPN is one tool in a larger security strategy, not a magical force field.

# My Actual Recommendations (By Use Case)

Forget generic ""best overall"" rankings. Here's what I'd actually choose based on specific scenarios.

**Best for broke students/people on tight budgets:**

`PrivadoVPN` at $1.11/month if you're okay with basic functionality and fewer servers. Protects your dorm WiFi traffic, prevents ISP snooping, gets the job done. Just don't expect to unblock region-locked streaming reliably.

**Best for families/households with tons of devices:**

`Surfshark` or `PIA`. Both offer unlimited simultaneous connections. Protect your laptop, phone, tablet, smart TV, partner's devices, kids' devices—everything on one account for $1.99-2.00/month. The per-device cost becomes absurdly cheap.

**Best for streaming addicts:**

`NordVPN` at $2.99/month. Yes, it costs 50% more than the cheapest options, but it consistently unblocks everything and maintains fast-enough speeds for 4K without buffering. If you're paying for multiple streaming services anyway, an extra $1.50/month to access all their regional libraries is nothing.

**Best for privacy purists:**

`Mullvad` at €5/month. No email required, cash payments accepted, open-source apps, multiple security audits, based in Sweden (strong privacy laws), proven commitment to not logging. Streaming sucks but privacy is bulletproof.

**Best for month-to-month flexibility:**

`ProtonVPN` at $9.99/month. Best monthly rate among reputable providers. Unlimited free tier if you want to test first. Swiss jurisdiction. Can cancel anytime without feeling locked into a long contract.

**Best overall value (my pick):**

`Surfshark` at $1.99/month (2-year plan). Unlimited devices. Fast WireGuard speeds. Works with most streaming services. Independently audited no-logs policy. Strong kill switch. The cheapest plan costs $1.99/month when buying for two years—it's the sweet spot of price, features, and trustworthiness.

**What I'm actually using right now:**

NordVPN. I signed up during a Black Friday deal at $2.99/month for two years. It's not the absolute cheapest, but the speed consistency and streaming reliability won me over after testing seven providers. I set a calendar reminder for 22 months from now to reassess before auto-renewal kicks in at the higher standard rate.

# The Fine Print Nobody Reads (But Should)

**Auto-renewal is always enabled by default.** That promotional $2.99/month rate? Once your initial term ends, NordVPN renews your subscription at a higher standard rate if the auto-renewal is still enabled. Set a calendar reminder for 1-2 months before your term expires. Cancel, shop around for better deals, or negotiate with your current provider.

**Money-back guarantees usually exclude monthly plans.** Most 30-day guarantees only apply to annual/multi-year subscriptions. Monthly plans are often final sale. Read the terms before assuming you can test risk-free.

**""Military-grade encryption"" is marketing fluff.** It doesn't mean anything specific. The military uses whatever encryption currently works for their threat model, which changes over time. AES-256 is standard across basically every reputable VPN in 2026, regardless of price.

**Server count numbers are often inflated.** ""10,000+ servers!"" sounds impressive until you realize they're counting virtual servers (multiple IPs on the same physical hardware) and spreading maybe 2,000 actual machines across different cities. What matters more: server locations (countries/cities covered) and whether they're RAM-only (data wiped on reboot) versus hard disk-based (logs could theoretically be retained even if policy claims otherwise).

**Jurisdiction matters more than marketing admits.** A VPN based in China claiming they'll protect you from Chinese government surveillance is comedy. Same with US-based VPNs claiming immunity from NSA subpoenas. Geography is destiny when it comes to legal obligations.

# When You Shouldn't Waste Money on Any VPN

Real talk: You might not need a VPN at all.

**Skip the VPN if:**

You only browse HTTPS websites on trusted home WiFi. Modern HTTPS already encrypts your traffic end-to-end. Your ISP can see you're visiting `reddit.com` but not which specific posts you're reading. For most people's threat models, that's sufficient.

You're trying to hide from nation-state surveillance. If the FBI/FSB/MSS/Mossad wants to track you specifically, a commercial VPN won't stop them. For individuals seeking anonymity, Tor (The Onion Router) is generally safer than a VPN. Tor is purpose-built for this; VPNs are not.

You think a VPN makes you ""anonymous"" online. It doesn't. Browser fingerprinting, cookies, login credentials, payment information—these all identify you regardless of IP address. A VPN hides your location, not your identity.

You never use public WiFi and your ISP doesn't throttle or monitor traffic. Some countries/ISPs just don't care what you do online. Lucky you—save your money.

**Actually need a VPN if:**

You regularly work from coffee shops, airports, hotels, or any public WiFi. This is the #1 legitimate use case. Public WiFi is essentially a free-for-all for packet sniffing.

Your ISP throttles certain traffic (torrents, streaming, etc.) or injects ads into web pages. Some ISPs are absurdly invasive. A VPN breaks their ability to inspect and modify your traffic.

You access geo-restricted content regularly. Legal gray area, but practically useful. Streaming services, regional pricing on games/software, accessing content only available in specific countries.

You live in a country with significant internet censorship. VPNs (especially ones with obfuscated servers) can bypass most national firewalls. Though if you're in China or Russia, do proper research on which ones actually still work.

# The Bottom Line: Don't Overpay, Don't Cheap Out on Security

After testing, comparing, and obsessing over VPN pricing for a month, here's what I learned:

**The cheapest reputable VPN is PrivadoVPN at $1.11/month.** But ""cheapest"" and ""best value"" aren't the same thing.

**The best value is Surfshark at $1.99/month.** Unlimited devices, strong security, independently audited, fast speeds, works with streaming. Surfshark is one of the few VPNs that competes with the very best while remaining very affordable. That extra 88 cents per month buys significantly better features and reliability.

**The best monthly rate is ProtonVPN at $9.99/month.** If you refuse to commit long-term, this is your best option among trustworthy providers.

**Free VPNs are almost always a trap.** If the service isn't charging you, it may earn money from your data, your attention, or both. The one exception is ProtonVPN's free tier, which is legitimately free but deliberately limited.

**Long-term plans save 75-87% versus monthly.** Even if you cancel early, you'll likely still spend less than buying monthly for that same period.

**Set a calendar reminder before auto-renewal hits.** Promotional pricing ends, renewal rates spike. Reassess yearly.

Stop overpaying for VPNs. But also stop trusting ""free"" or sketchy ultra-cheap providers with your actual privacy. The sweet spot in early 2026 is $2-3/month from a provider with independent audits, proven no-logs policies, and actual transparency.

Your data is worth protecting. Just don't pay $600/year to do it when $24/year accomplishes the same thing.",1,1771139095.0,PrivacyCompass,0,1.0,False

I mean I talked with someone the other day(and my verbal outpour is like sectioned into smaller bricks? idk how to explain this but its like segmented differently)

but that person said my talking was off. Like. Sometimes, i if i dont drink coffee, if im chill, yk all that and everythings fine for whatever reason(not depressed just chill so not bipolar?) then I just talk real long and flowy but now my mind is just shorter words like :yes, ok. no."" made a stupid post. Thingis, I also made like 50 comments today and for the past few days on reddit(i will go through delete that all). Was sort of late on an assignment but hey i was a bit productive? So thats fine. my mental health feels good but its not like elated or anything

anyone else? Genuinely so I got diagnosed with autism symptoms but how do i get re-assessed without sounding like I might have munchausens? Cause the autism bit makes sense.. or did.. but I dont think I have any symptoms of that anymore? Like i feel perfectly neurotypical but now my brain is just fuzzy and fuzzing up higher.

So the main issue is, how do i bring up to a new psych that im not sure if i was diagnosed right? Can autism cause this idk? and I was worried about something bad sounding on there so thats partially why I didn't want to go and ask for clarification or a second opinion. Also everything probably is fine. Its also 2 am again and im wide awake like WIDE AWAKE I was tired for 10 minutes and now not and then earlier I had some depressing thoughts(so not like mania or hypomania) per google's criteria.

And if it were why doesnt that ever last more than like 2-3 days? Also reason its probably not bipolar: i can just make my brain calm by jut forcing myself to relax all the muscles in my body

i can feel every single thing my skin is touching",1,1771139074.0,BipolarReddit,3,1.0,False

1r581zg,https://www.reddit.com/r/rSocialskillsAscend/comments/1r581zg/how_to_become_instantly_more_attractive_the/,How to Become Instantly More Attractive: The Psychology That Actually Works,"Look, we've all been there. Standing in front of the mirror, wondering what makes some people just magnetic while the rest of us feel invisible. I've spent way too much time down this rabbit hole, reading research papers, psychology books, and watching hours of body language experts dissect what actually makes someone attractive. And here's what blew my mind: most of what we think makes us attractive is dead wrong.



The biggest game changer? It's not your face, your clothes, or even your body. It's something way simpler, and it takes exactly 3 seconds to implement. I'm talking about eye contact with a genuine smile. But not the fake, nervous grin you flash at strangers. The real deal that actually reaches your eyes and makes people feel seen.



Before you roll your eyes thinking this is basic advice, hear me out. Because the science behind why this works is actually wild, and most people completely butcher it.



 Step 1: Master the 3-Second Eye Contact Rule



Here's the thing about eye contact. Most people either stare like psychopaths or dart their eyes away like scared rabbits. Both kill your attractiveness instantly.



Research from the University of Miami found that maintaining eye contact for 3.3 seconds hits the sweet spot. Any less, you seem uninterested or nervous. Any more without breaking, you enter creepy territory.



But here's the real trick: when you make that eye contact, you need to genuinely smile at the same time. Not a mouth-only smile. A real smile engages your whole face, especially your eyes (those crow's feet are actually attractive because they signal authenticity).



Dr. Paul Ekman, the psychologist who literally wrote the book on facial expressions, calls these ""Duchenne smiles."" They're impossible to fake consistently because they involve muscles you can't consciously control. People's brains are wired to detect authentic vs fake smiles in milliseconds.



Why this works: Eye contact triggers oxytocin release in both you and the other person. It's the same chemical released during hugging, sex, and bonding. You're literally creating a chemical connection in 3 seconds.



 Step 2: Fix Your Posture (It's Not What You Think)



Everyone says ""stand up straight"" but that's not the full picture. What actually matters is open body language.



Amy Cuddy's research at Harvard (yeah, the power pose lady) found that how you hold your body doesn't just affect how others see you, it literally changes your hormone levels. Open postures increase testosterone and decrease cortisol, making you feel more confident, which then makes you appear more confident.



Here's what open posture actually looks like:



 Shoulders back but relaxed (not military rigid)

 Arms uncrossed

 Taking up space without being obnoxious about it

 Head level, not tilted down at your phone



The crazy part? People can detect your posture in their peripheral vision before they even look at your face. Your body is broadcasting your confidence level 24/7.



Pro tip: Before entering any social situation, do this for 2 minutes: stand like a starfish, arms and legs spread wide. It sounds stupid but it genuinely changes your brain chemistry. Or just stand in a wide stance with your hands on your hips. The physical space you take up signals to your brain that you're in control.



 Step 3: Slow Down Your Movements



Attractive people move differently. They're not rushed or jerky. There's a deliberateness to their movements that screams confidence.



Vanessa Van Edwards from the Science of People analyzed thousands of hours of TED talks and found that the most liked speakers used smooth, controlled gestures. Frantic or repetitive movements made people seem nervous or untrustworthy.



In practice:



 Slow down your walking pace by about 10%

 Use controlled hand gestures when you talk

 Don't fidget or touch your face/hair constantly

 Take your time when reaching for things



This isn't about being slow or lazy. It's about being intentional. When you rush through movements, you signal anxiety and low status. When you move with purpose, people perceive you as more attractive and competent.



 Step 4: Listen Like You Actually Give a Damn



Real talk: most people are terrible listeners. They're just waiting for their turn to talk. If you want to become instantly more attractive, become someone who actually listens.



Dr. John Gottman spent decades studying what makes relationships work. His research found that active listening is one of the strongest predictors of attraction and relationship success.



Here's how to actually do it:



 Put your phone away (seriously, even having it visible on the table reduces perceived empathy by 30%)

 Ask follow-up questions about what they just said

 Paraphrase back what you heard (""So what you're saying is..."")

 Don't interrupt or try to top their story with your own



The psychology here is simple but powerful. When people feel heard, they feel valued. And they associate that good feeling with you.



Bonus: Read ""Never Split the Difference"" by Chris Voss. He's a former FBI hostage negotiator who breaks down listening techniques that are insanely effective. The book won't just make you more attractive, it'll change how you handle every conversation. His technique of ""mirroring"" (repeating the last few words someone said) is genuinely wild. People will talk for hours if you just mirror them occasionally.



If you want a more efficient way to absorb these insights, there's an app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that pulls from psychology books, research papers, and expert interviews to create personalized audio learning based on your goals. You could set a goal like ""become more charismatic as an introvert"" and it'll build you a custom learning plan with episodes you can adjust from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives. 



The voice customization is surprisingly addictive, you can pick anything from a smooth, calming tone to something more energetic. It's useful for when you're commuting or at the gym and want to keep learning without the effort of reading. Plus it connects insights from different sources like the books mentioned here, so you're getting a fuller picture of what actually works in social psychology and attraction.



 Step 5: Develop a Signature Scent (But Not Cologne)



This one's going to sound weird, but stick with me. Smell is the sense most closely linked to memory and emotion. But most people screw this up by drowning themselves in cologne or perfume.



Rachel Herz, a neuroscientist at Brown University, found that personal scent (your natural smell mixed with subtle product scents) is way more attractive than heavy fragrances. Your goal isn't to smell like a department store. It's to smell clean with a subtle signature.



The strategy:



 Use an unscented or lightly scented body wash

 Find ONE subtle signature scent (essential oil, light cologne, or even a specific laundry detergent)

 Layer it so it's barely detectable but consistent



When people smell that scent later, even without you there, it triggers memories of you. It's subconscious attraction building.



Try the app Scentbird if you want to test different scents monthly without committing to full bottles. Or honestly, sometimes the best scent is just good hygiene plus quality fabric softener on clean clothes.



 Step 6: Master the Art of Strategic Touching



Touch is powerful but most people either avoid it completely or use it creepily. There's a middle ground that massively increases attraction.



Research from the University of Mississippi found that light, appropriate touch during conversation increases likability by up to 40%. But the key word is appropriate.



Safe, non-creepy touches:



 Light touch on the forearm when making a point (1-2 seconds max)

Tap on the shoulder to get attention

 High-fives or fist bumps after shared wins

 Guiding touch on the lower back when navigating through crowds (only if you already know the person)



Do NOT:



 Touch without reading the room first

Touch intimate zones (face, neck, knees, inner arms)

 Hold touch for too long

 Touch repeatedly in the same conversation



The science: appropriate touch releases oxytocin and dopamine. It creates a sense of trust and connection. But inappropriate touch does the opposite, triggering cortisol and putting people on guard.



 Step 7: Tell Better Stories (Stop Being Boring)



Nobody wants to hear a play-by-play of your day. Attractive people know how to craft stories that create emotional resonance.



Matthew Lieberman, a social neuroscience professor at UCLA, found that stories that make people feel something activate the same brain regions as if they experienced it themselves. That's the secret.



Story structure that works:



 Start with the emotion or the weird detail, not the setup

 Use sensory details (what things looked, sounded, smelled like)

 Build tension with a problem or conflict

 End with either a resolution or a cliffhanger that invites conversation



Bad story: ""So I went to the store yesterday and bought milk. Then I came home.""



Good story: ""I'm standing in the grocery store checkout line, and this woman in front of me is arguing with the cashier about expired coupons from 2019. Everyone's getting uncomfortable, right? Then out of nowhere...""



See the difference? One's forgettable. The other makes people lean in.



Check out ""Storyworthy"" by Matthew Dicks. This guy teaches storytelling for a living and his techniques are ridiculously practical. The book will change how you communicate permanently.



 Step 8: Get Your Digital Presence Together



Like it or not, people are googling you. Your online presence is part of your attractiveness now.



MIT research found that people form impressions from social media profiles in under 50 milliseconds. That's faster than conscious thought.



Clean up your digital footprint:



 Update profile photos across platforms (use photos where you're genuinely smiling, in good lighting)

 Remove or archive drunk/cringe posts from your college years

 Post occasionally about things you're passionate about (hobbies, causes, interests)

 Don't overshare or post 10 times a day



The goal isn't to be fake. It's to be intentional about what you're broadcasting to the world.



Hot take: If your Instagram is all selfies or all memes, it's working against you. Show variety. Show depth. Give people something interesting to ask you about.



 Step 9: Build Competence in Something Visible



Attraction isn't just about looks or charm. It's about being interesting. And interesting people are competent at something specific.



Dr. Angela Duckworth's research on grit found that people who develop deep competence in one area are perceived as more attractive across the board. It signals discipline, passion, and depth.



Pick something and get visibly good at it:



 A physical skill (climbing, martial arts, dance)

 A creative pursuit (photography, music, writing)

 A knowledge domain (cocktail making, coffee brewing, philosophy)



The key word is visible. People need to be able to see or experience your competence. It gives them something to admire and creates natural conversation opportunities.



Resource: Try the app Skillshare or Masterclass to dive deep into something that actually interests you. Don't pick something because it sounds impressive. Pick it because you're genuinely curious. That authentic interest is what makes it attractive.



 Step 10: Stop Seeking Validation



Here's the paradox: the more you need people to find you attractive, the less attractive you become. Desperation is repellent. Confidence is magnetic.



Mark Manson covers this perfectly in ""The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*ck."" The people who are most attractive are the ones who've stopped caring so much about being attractive. They're focused on their own growth, their own interests, their own values.



The mental shift:



 Stop checking how many likes your posts get

 Stop fishing for compliments

 Stop shaping your personality based on who you're talking to

 Start making decisions based on what YOU actually want



This doesn't mean become an asshole who doesn't care about anyone. It means your sense of worth comes from within, not from external validation.



When you genuinely stop needing approval, something weird happens. People want to give it to you more. It's backwards but it's real.



The crazy thing? All of this compounds. The 3-second eye contact thing might seem small, but when you layer it with better posture, intentional movement, genuine listening, and authentic confidence, you become a completely different person. Not fake different. Genuinely more attractive different.",1,1771138889.0,rSocialskillsAscend,0,1.0,False

1r57xvw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Datingat21st/comments/1r57xvw/how_to_text_men_without_overthinking_3_psychology/,How to Text Men Without Overthinking: 3 Psychology Tricks That Actually Work,"I spent way too much time overthinking texts. Like, dissecting every word, asking friends ""does this sound desperate?"", waiting exactly 47 minutes to reply because the internet said so. Exhausting.

Then I found Matthew Hussey's texting breakdown and honestly, it changed everything. Not in a manipulative ""trap him"" way but in a ""finally understand how men's brains work"" way. Studied relationship psychology from experts, podcasts, research, and realized we've been doing this all wrong.

Here's the thing. Most texting advice is garbage. It's either ""play hard to get"" (outdated) or ""be yourself"" (too vague). The real secret? Understanding what actually makes someone want to keep talking to you. And it's simpler than you think.

**Create intrigue without being confusing**

Men respond to curiosity. Not mystery for mystery's sake but genuine intrigue. Instead of ""hey what's up"", try something specific that references your last conversation or throws in something unexpected. Like ""just tried that coffee place you mentioned. verdict: life changing OR overhyped?""

This works because it shows you were listening AND opens an actual conversation. The brain loves unfinished loops. He's gonna want to know your verdict.

Matthew Hussey breaks this down perfectly in his book *[Get the Guy](https://www.amazon.com/Get-Guy-Learn-Secrets-Mind/dp/0062241761)*. He's a legit relationship coach who's worked with thousands of women, and this book is basically the bible for understanding male psychology without playing games. The texting chapter alone is worth it. Makes you realize how much we overthink the wrong things. I highlighted like every other page because it felt like someone finally explained the unspoken rules.

**Use the ""curiosity gap"" technique**

This one's sneaky good. When you're wrapping up a conversation, drop a hint about something interesting without fully explaining it. ""Gotta run, about to do the most chaotic thing I've done this month"" or ""just had the weirdest conversation with my neighbor, tell you later.""

Sounds simple but it plants a seed. He's gonna wonder. And wondering = thinking about you. It's basically how Netflix cliffhangers work. Our brains hate unanswered questions.

I learned this from Esther Perel's podcast *Where Should We Begin?* She's a psychotherapist who gets into the nitty gritty of desire and attraction. One episode talks about how anticipation is MORE powerful than satisfaction in keeping interest alive. That stuck with me. We're so focused on giving perfect responses when really, leaving room for imagination does more work.

**Match energy but add slight challenge**

This is where most people mess up. They either mirror someone completely (boring) or act totally disinterested (confusing). The sweet spot? Match his investment level but add just a bit of playful pushback.

If he sends ""wanna hang this week?"", don't just say ""yes sure."" Try ""depends, what'd you have in mind? better not be another coffee date"" with obvious playfulness. Shows you're interested but you also have standards. Guys respect that way more than immediate availability.

*[Attached](https://www.amazon.com/Attached-Science-Adult-Attachment-YouFind/dp/1585429139)* by Amir Levine explains this perfectly through attachment theory. It's a psychology book that breaks down why some people are anxious texters and others are avoidant, and how to communicate with different types. Super eye opening. Made me realize half my texting anxiety came from not understanding my own attachment style. This book basically taught me that having needs and expressing them isn't needy, it's healthy. Total mindset shift.

If you want to go deeper on dating psychology but don't have time to read a stack of relationship books, there's [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450). It's a personalized audio learning app that pulls from books like the ones mentioned above, plus dating expert insights and research, and turns them into customized podcasts based on your goals.

You can type something like ""I'm an overthinker and I want practical strategies to feel more confident in dating"" and it builds a learning plan just for you. You control the depth too, from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with examples. Plus you get a virtual coach you can chat with anytime to ask questions or get book recommendations. Way easier than trying to piece together advice from ten different sources yourself.

Real talk though. These aren't manipulation tactics. They're just understanding basic human psychology. We all want someone who's interested but not desperate, engaging but not overwhelming, confident but not cocky. Texting is just one tiny way that shows up.

The biggest thing I learned? Stop treating texts like they're make or break. They're not. They're just... texts. The right person isn't gonna disappear because you used the wrong emoji. But understanding these small psychology principles definitely helps you show up as your most attractive self instead of your anxious overthinking self.

1r57ql0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrivacyCompass/comments/1r57ql0/best_vpn_apps_for_android_phones/,Best VPN Apps For Android Phones,"Last week my phone connected to a coffee shop WiFi and within seconds I got a notification from my banking app. Suspicious login attempt. Same network I was on.

Wasn't some hypothetical scenario from a cybersecurity blog.

Real. Happening. Right then. And I had zero protection running because I thought ""who's going to intercept my traffic at a random café?"" — which is probably what everyone thinks until someone with a cheap packet sniffer and way too much spare time decides your session looks interesting.

So yeah. That's when I actually started testing VPNs on my Android properly instead of just installing whatever had the flashiest ads.

# What Actually Matters for Android VPNs in 2026

Most reviews tell you about ""military-grade encryption"" like that phrase means anything to normal humans browsing Reddit at 2 AM. Here's what actually matters when you're picking a VPN for your Android phone, based on my testing across 15+ providers through late 2025 and into early 2026.

**Speed.** Not theoretical maximum throughput. Real-world performance when you're switching between WiFi and 4G, when you're streaming video, when your phone decides to update 47 apps simultaneously in the background.

**Battery drain.** Because a VPN that tanks your battery by 20% daily isn't a privacy solution, it's a dealbreaker. Modern protocols like `WireGuard` make a massive difference here — I measured anywhere from 2-8% extra drain depending on the provider, compared to the old `OpenVPN` days when VPNs could eat through 15%+ of your charge.

**Android-specific features.** GPS spoofing (yes, some apps check your actual GPS location, not just IP). Split tunneling so you're not routing your banking app through a server in Romania when it triggers fraud alerts. Kill switches that actually work when your connection drops, not three seconds later after your real IP has already leaked.

And here's something nobody talks about: **how the app behaves when your phone goes to sleep.** Some VPNs reconnect instantly when you wake your device. Others sit there spinning for 8 seconds while your traffic flows unprotected.

# The Speed Tests Nobody Shows You

I ran these tests in December 2025 on a Samsung Galaxy S24, 500 Mbps home connection, same Frankfurt server across all providers at 2 AM local time when my ISP actually delivers what they promise.

|VPN Provider|Download (Mbps)|Upload (Mbps)|Reconnect Time|Consistency^(1)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**NordVPN** (`NordLynx`)|462|338|1.4s|🔥 Excellent|
|**Surfshark** (`WireGuard`)|394|312|2.1s|✅ Good|
|**ProtonVPN** (`WireGuard`)|381|289|1.8s|✅ Good|
|**ExpressVPN** (`Lightway`)|368|301|2.3s|⚠️ Variable|
|**PIA** (`WireGuard`)|356|294|1.6s|✅ Good|

^(1) How much speeds varied across 30 tests over 3 days

But here's what that table doesn't show. NordVPN's speeds were absurdly consistent — every single test landed between 455-468 Mbps. Surfshark bounced around more (340-420 Mbps range), and ExpressVPN sometimes hit 410 Mbps, other times crawled at 280 Mbps with no pattern I could identify.

And reconnect time? That's how long it takes when you unlock your phone after it's been sleeping for an hour. NordVPN clicked back on before my thumb left the fingerprint sensor. ExpressVPN took over 2 seconds, which doesn't sound like much until you're standing on a train platform trying to pull up your ticket and your connection is just... spinning.

# NordVPN: Fast, Polished, Slightly Expensive

If someone put a gun to my head and said ""pick one VPN for your mom's Android phone,"" I'd pick NordVPN. Not because it's perfect (it's not), but because it's the least likely to cause confused phone calls.

The Android app is stupid simple. Big blue button. Press it. You're protected. Everything else is tucked away in settings where beginners won't accidentally break things, but power users can still tweak protocol selection and configure split tunneling.

**What impressed me:** The `NordLynx` protocol. It's their implementation of `WireGuard`, and it absolutely screams on Android. I tested it against six other VPNs in late 2025, and NordVPN consistently delivered the fastest speeds with the most stable connections. When I switched from WiFi to 4G while walking down the street (classic Android scenario), NordVPN reconnected seamlessly. Others dropped for 2-3 seconds.

The kill switch actually works. I tested this by manually disconnecting mid-torrent (don't @ me) and watching what happened. NordVPN killed my connection in 0.2 seconds. Nothing leaked. Surfshark took 3+ seconds and leaked my IP on 2 out of 10 tests. That three-second gap? Long enough to expose your real identity to whatever you're doing.

**What annoyed me:** The ""Pause VPN"" function. Why does turning off the VPN require two taps instead of one? I have no idea why they thought this was a good UX decision, but it's baffling. Also, the kill switch requires some fiddly configuration on Android if you want it to play nice with split tunneling — the settings interfere with each other in ways that aren't immediately obvious.

>**Real talk:** At $3.39/month on a 2-year plan, NordVPN isn't the cheapest option out there. But the performance gap between NordVPN and budget alternatives is noticeable enough that I'd rather skip two coffees per month than deal with stuttering video streams and random disconnects.

Streaming worked flawlessly. Netflix, Disney+, BBC iPlayer, Hulu — all unlocked without errors during my testing in early 2026. I connected to servers in 12 different countries and never once got the dreaded ""you seem to be using a VPN"" message.

**Pricing:** $3.39/month (2-year plan), $12.99/month (monthly)  
**Devices:** 10 simultaneous connections  
**Android trial:** 3-day free trial + 30-day money-back guarantee

# Surfshark: Unlimited Devices, Aggressive Pricing

Here's Surfshark's killer feature: unlimited simultaneous connections. You can protect every device you own — your phone, tablet, laptop, smart TV, your partner's devices, your kid's tablet — all on one subscription.

At $1.99/month for a 2-year plan, it's the best value if you're covering multiple devices or splitting the cost with family.

**The GPS Override feature.** This is *chef's kiss* for Android. Most VPNs only change your IP address. Apps with location services can still see your real GPS coordinates. Surfshark's GPS Override actually spoofs your GPS location to match your VPN server.

I tested this with several location-based apps. With GPS Override enabled, Surfshark successfully tricked apps into thinking I was in New York when I was actually sitting in my apartment in Berlin. Without this feature, those same apps would show my IP as New York but my GPS as Germany, which triggers security flags.

But (and this is important), GPS Override requires enabling Developer Mode on your Android device and selecting Surfshark as a mock location app. The setup takes about 90 seconds and Surfshark's app walks you through it, but it's still an extra step that might intimidate less technical users.

**What works:** The `CleanWeb` ad blocker is genuinely useful. Blocked most banner ads, many video ads, and a surprising number of trackers during my testing. Not as aggressive as dedicated ad blockers like uBlock Origin, but solid for a built-in VPN feature.

Split tunneling (they call it `Bypasser`) is straightforward. I routed my banking apps through my regular connection while keeping everything else through the VPN. Worked perfectly, no disconnects, no weird behavior.

**What doesn't:** The kill switch isn't enabled by default. This is a massive oversight for a security product. I get that they probably don't want to confuse new users, but come on — the kill switch should absolutely be on by default, with an option to disable it if needed.

Connection speeds are noticeably slower on distant servers. Local connections (Germany to Netherlands) were stellar — 390+ Mbps consistently. But when I connected to servers in Japan or Australia, speeds dropped to 180-220 Mbps. Still usable, but NordVPN maintained 300+ Mbps on those same distant connections.

**Pricing:** $1.99/month (2-year plan), $15.45/month (monthly)  
**Devices:** Unlimited simultaneous connections  
**Android trial:** 7-day free trial + 30-day money-back guarantee

# ProtonVPN: Privacy Nerds' Favorite

Swiss-based. Open-source apps. Audited no-logs policy. `Secure Core` servers that route through privacy-friendly countries. If you're the type of person who reads privacy policies for fun, ProtonVPN is your jam.

The free tier is actually usable, which is rare. Unlimited bandwidth, no ads, no data caps. You're limited to 10 free server locations and you can't manually choose which one (the app picks the fastest available), but for basic privacy protection without paying anything, it's the best free option I've tested.

**What sets it apart:** Transparency. ProtonVPN publishes regular audit reports, their apps are fully open-source so security researchers can examine the code for vulnerabilities, and they're based in Switzerland which has strong privacy laws and isn't part of the 5/9/14-Eyes surveillance alliances.

The `NetShield` ad blocker (paid plans only) uses DNS filtering to block ads, trackers, and malware. During testing it blocked more threats than Surfshark's CleanWeb — I deliberately visited known malicious domains and NetShield caught every single one before they loaded.

**Performance:** Solid but not stellar. ProtonVPN's speeds were consistently good (380 Mbps average on nearby servers), but they occasionally dropped to 280 Mbps for no apparent reason. The `VPN Accelerator` technology helps with distant connections — I saw 60% speed retention on Australian servers versus 40% without it.

Connection times were fast. The app connected in under 2 seconds consistently, and reconnections after sleep were nearly instant.

**The downsides:** The Android app can feel cluttered if you're not familiar with VPN terminology. Lots of options, lots of settings, and while power users will appreciate the control, beginners might find it overwhelming compared to NordVPN's streamlined interface.

And here's my biggest gripe: the free tier is genuinely excellent, but the paid tiers get expensive quickly if you want all the features. The Plus plan starts at $2.99-3.99/month, which is competitive. But if you want the full Proton ecosystem (VPN + encrypted email + cloud storage + password manager), you're looking at $9.99/month for Proton Unlimited.

**Pricing:** FREE (limited), $2.99/month (Plus, 2-year), $9.99/month (Unlimited)  
**Devices:** 10 simultaneous connections (paid plans)  
**Android trial:** Free tier unlimited time + 30-day money-back (paid)

# The Battery Drain Reality Check

Every VPN drains your battery. The question is how much.

I ran battery tests on a fully charged Samsung S24 with Android 14, same usage pattern (2 hours browsing, 1 hour streaming, 3 hours standby), WiFi connection:

|VPN Provider|Protocol|Extra Drain vs No VPN|Hourly Rate|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**NordVPN**|`NordLynx`|\+6% over 6 hours|\~1% per hour|
|**Surfshark**|`WireGuard`|\+7% over 6 hours|\~1.2% per hour|
|**ProtonVPN**|`WireGuard`|\+8% over 6 hours|\~1.3% per hour|
|**ExpressVPN**|`Lightway`|\+5% over 6 hours|\~0.8% per hour|
|**PIA**|`OpenVPN`|\+12% over 6 hours|\~2% per hour|

ExpressVPN's `Lightway` protocol showed the lowest battery impact, which aligns with their marketing claims. But here's the catch: it's also the most expensive option at $6-8/month even on long-term plans.

**The protocol makes all the difference.** PIA using `OpenVPN` drained battery twice as fast as modern alternatives. When I switched PIA to `WireGuard`, the drain dropped to 7% over 6 hours — much closer to the pack.

>**Pro tip:** If battery life matters more than absolute maximum security, use `WireGuard` or your VPN's custom implementation (`NordLynx`, `Lightway`). On mobile data instead of WiFi, expect battery drain to increase by 40-60% because your 4G/5G radio consumes more power maintaining the encrypted connection to distant cell towers.

# Features That Actually Matter on Android

**Kill Switch:** Blocks all internet traffic if your VPN disconnects. Sounds basic, but many VPNs implement this poorly. Android 7+ includes a built-in kill switch called ""Always-on VPN"" that works with any VPN app:

1. Go to Settings → Network & Internet → VPN
2. Tap the gear icon next to your VPN
3. Enable ""Always-on VPN""
4. Enable ""Block connections without VPN""

This forces all traffic through the VPN or blocks it entirely. Some VPN apps have their own kill switch implementation that's faster (NordVPN's killed traffic in 0.2 seconds versus Android's native \~1 second), but the system-level option works as a backup.

**Split Tunneling:** Routes specific apps through the VPN while others use your regular connection. Perfect for:

* Banking apps that block VPN connections
* Local streaming services that don't need protection
* Games with strict anti-cheat that might flag VPN usage

Surfshark's `Bypasser` and NordVPN's split tunneling both worked flawlessly. I routed my banking app, local news site, and weather app through my regular connection while everything else went through the VPN.

**GPS Spoofing:** Only available on Surfshark (and a few lesser-known providers). Changes your actual GPS coordinates, not just your IP. Useful for location-based apps that check GPS independently of your network connection.

Setup requires Developer Mode, which might void warranties on some devices and definitely voids my ability to recommend it without massive disclaimers. Proceed with caution.

# What About Free VPNs?

Short answer: ProtonVPN's free tier is the only one worth using.

Long answer: I tested 8 free VPN apps from the Google Play Store in late 2025. Six of them showed ads, three collected browsing data (buried in their privacy policies), two leaked my IP address during disconnect tests, and one tried to install a sketchy ""security scanner"" that my phone flagged as potential malware.

Free VPNs make money somehow. Usually by:

* Showing you ads (annoying but relatively harmless)
* Collecting and selling your browsing data (defeats the entire purpose)
* Injecting tracking scripts (actively harmful)
* Severely limiting speeds/data (unusable for real work)

ProtonVPN Free is the exception because it's funded by paid subscribers. You get unlimited bandwidth, no ads, and the same privacy protections as paid users. The limitations are server selection (you can't choose) and speed (free servers are slower because everyone's using them).

If you absolutely need free VPN protection, use ProtonVPN Free. If you see ads in your ""free"" VPN app, uninstall it immediately.

# The Reddit Consensus (Based on 100+ Threads)

I spent way too many hours reading VPN discussions on r/VPN, r/privacy, and r/Android through 2025 and early 2026. Here's what the community actually recommends:

**Most Recommended:** NordVPN gets praised for performance and reliability, though some users complain about aggressive marketing. Surfshark gets love for value and unlimited devices. ProtonVPN is the privacy purist's choice.

**Frequently Warned Against:**

* Betternet: Limited servers, questionable data practices
* HolaVPN: Uses peer-to-peer architecture (your bandwidth gets sold to other users)
* Any free VPN with ads: ""If the product is free, you are the product""

**Common Complaints:**

* VPNs that don't work in China despite claiming to (most don't in 2026)
* Kill switches that leak for several seconds
* Apps that auto-connect on startup with no way to disable it
* Customer support that copies/pastes unhelpful responses

The recurring theme: Redditors value transparency, hate marketing BS, and will absolutely roast you if your no-logs policy gets contradicted by a court subpoena.

# Current Pricing Reality (February 2026)

VPN pricing is intentionally confusing. Monthly plans are expensive to push you toward annual contracts. Here's what these services actually cost right now:

|Provider|Monthly|1-Year Plan|2-Year Plan|Best Deal|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**NordVPN**|$12.99|\~$4.49/mo|**$3.39/mo**|2-year (74% off)|

|**PIA**|$11.99|\~$3.33/mo|**$2.19/mo**|2-year (82% off)|

Notice the pattern? Monthly plans cost 4-7x more than long-term commitments. This is deliberate — VPN companies want annual subscribers because monthly users churn constantly.

**All of them include 30-day money-back guarantees.** So you can commit to a 2-year plan, test it for 29 days, and get a full refund if it doesn't work for you. Several include Android-specific free trials (NordVPN: 3 days, Surfshark: 7 days).

# My Actual Recommendation (No BS)

**If you want the best overall Android VPN:** NordVPN. Fastest speeds in my testing, rock-solid reliability, features that actually work. Worth the slightly higher price.

**If you're on a budget or covering multiple devices:** Surfshark. Unlimited connections + GPS spoofing + aggressive pricing = excellent value. Just turn on the kill switch manually after installing.

**If privacy matters more than speed:** ProtonVPN. Swiss jurisdiction, open-source apps, audited no-logs policy. The free tier is genuinely usable if you need temporary protection.

**If you prioritize battery life:** ExpressVPN. Lowest battery drain in my tests, but you pay a premium for it.

And honestly? The gap between these top options is smaller than the marketing makes it seem. NordVPN is maybe 15% faster than Surfshark. Surfshark costs 40% less than NordVPN. ProtonVPN is 10% more transparent than both.

Pick based on what you actually need. Fast speeds for streaming? NordVPN. Protecting 8 devices on a tight budget? Surfshark. Maximum privacy with verified credentials? ProtonVPN.

# Things I Learned Testing 15+ VPNs

Some VPNs auto-reconnect after your phone sleeps. Others sit there spinning for 10+ seconds while your traffic flows unprotected. This matters way more in real-world usage than theoretical maximum speeds.

The ""number of servers"" metric is mostly marketing fluff. NordVPN claims 9,000+ servers. Great. But I only need fast, reliable servers in the 5-10 locations I actually use. A VPN with 500 well-maintained servers beats one with 5,000 overcrowded ones.

Customer support quality varies wildly. ExpressVPN's 24/7 chat actually helped me troubleshoot a connection issue at 3 AM. Surfshark's support copied/pasted articles from their help center that didn't answer my question.

No VPN works 100% reliably in China anymore. The Great Firewall got upgraded significantly in 2025, and even VPNs with obfuscated servers struggle. If you absolutely need to bypass Chinese censorship, you need dedicated solutions beyond consumer VPNs.

# The Bottom Line

My Samsung S24 has had NordVPN running continuously since December 2025. Fast, stable, hasn't leaked my IP once in 2+ months of testing. Battery drain is minimal (maybe 1% per hour extra). The app doesn't randomly disconnect when I switch networks.

But your needs might be different. Maybe you're protecting 6 devices and need Surfshark's unlimited connections. Maybe you're privacy-focused and want ProtonVPN's Swiss jurisdiction and open-source apps.

The VPN you actually use beats the theoretically perfect VPN you never install.

Pick one from the top three. Install it. Enable the kill switch. Test it for a week with the money-back guarantee. If it works for your usage pattern, keep it. If not, try another.

Your coffee shop network traffic is probably fine 99% of the time. But that 1% where someone's running a packet sniffer? That's when you'll be grateful you spent $3/month to avoid explaining to your bank why your account got drained from an IP in Russia.",1,1771137738.0,PrivacyCompass,0,1.0,False

Is the premium worth the labor savings?,"I’m currently running the numbers on switching our fleet (12 heavy pieces of yellow iron and about 15 pickups) from the standard ""gas station every morning"" routine to a dedicated mobile fueling service.

Right now, my guys are burning about 30–45 minutes every single morning just getting fuel. Between driving to the station, waiting in line behind other crews, filling up 30-gallon tanks, grabbing coffee/breakfast, and then finally getting to the site, we are losing serious billable hours. When you multiply that 45 minutes by 15 guys at their hourly burdened rate, the ""cheaper"" pump price is actually costing me a fortune in lost productivity.

I’ve been looking at **Ricochet Fuel** to come in overnight and top everything off right on the grade. They quoted me a service where they hit the excavators, the skids, and the trucks so when my crew shows up at 7:00 AM, they turn the key and go. No stops.

The per-gallon price is obviously higher than the street price, but on paper, the labor savings should wipe that out easily.

Has anyone used their specific wet hosing service in Texas or the Southwest? Is the service reliable enough that I don't have to worry about a crew showing up to an empty tank? I’m trying to figure out if the ""convenience fee"" is actually a net gain for a fleet my size.",1,1771137702.0,EmergencyPowerPrep,0,1.0,False

So I’ve tried to gently guide him and let him know what I do like so that way he’s not wasting his time or money. For the past few holidays, he’s purchased me cheap bouquets in plastic wrap from grocery stores. I told him I’d prefer a small houseplant because it would last longer and they are around the same price. For the past 2 years, he hasn’t bought a single houseplant for me. As a reminder for this Valentine’s Day, I told him not to buy me flowers. This morning, there are no flowers- there is a coffee mug with a stuffed animal in it and a candle that he ran to get at the drugstore down the street this morning. Im not thrilled because I told him before that I don’t like these little knickknacks that end up as clutter. But I say thank you anyway. I read the card he gives me and he mentions that he “promises to give more affection” because he’s not the most affectionate person. He didn’t hug or kiss me all day today. When afternoon rolls around, I mention that he didn’t give me a valentines hug or kiss like he said he would in the card. He flips out and say I’m ungrateful and critical of his valentines gift. I don’t want to fight so I spend the rest of my day alone in my room with the door shut. We haven’t spoken since. I planned on making us a special dinner but I decided not to because what’s the point? I am convinced that my husband must hate me. ",2,1771137697.0,Marriage,2,1.0,False
1r57q5s,https://i.redd.it/e8mx3b1ptljg1.png,Should I use all of my GB to make HS,"(photo of lioness unrelated to question)

I have about 70-100 GB and could get more. So my question is

Would it be worth it to use all of my GB on energy items (Coffee beans, Energy Boosts, and Roasted Lambs) to make HS and then sell the resulting itmes?

Would that be a net gain or nest loss? 
Let's say
1x Coffee Bean = 3GB
1x Hyena Butter = 100SB
5x Energy Boosts = 10GB
1x Roasted Lamb = 3 GB

a total of 16.1 GB

Which should translate to between 120-180 HS

Which would equal 2-3 Buffy Balls

Which would equal to 40-70GB if I wait long enough



So basically. Is 16GB worth 40GB + Months of waiting",3,1771137696.0,lioden,1,1.0,False
