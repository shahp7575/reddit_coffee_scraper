I'm currently on vacation in Germany and found this mill alternative which has an amazing coconut flavor for only 14 cals per 100ml (brings it to about 35 cals per cup /240ml).

Does anyone know if we have a comparable product in the US (I'm in the Midwest area usually)? 

I'm already dreading leaving this behind as it gives great flavor to coffee/oatmeal/cereal with all the fat coconut usually brings with it...

The ex-wife has had trouble accepting the fact that I'm in the kids lives. The first time she found out I existed she caused a big scene between her and my husband. We took a trip to visit family in which we brought the kids and she demanded her kids stay with family and were not allowed to stay with us. Eventually her and I met for coffee and everything seemed good. She seemed like she would be cool. Then at some point she stopped communication. The woman refuses to acknowledge my presence or speak to me. She even refuses to allow me to bring the kids to the doctor when they are sick. We are around each other when either of the kids have functions for school or extracurricular. I'm not bothered by it. However now the eldest has graduated and asked to have a party at our home. It's assumed she will be invited. We recently attended graduation and he had a graduation dinner in which again she did but speak to me. I told my husband I was okay with the party but did not feel comfortable inviting her into my home. I feel that would make it seem like her behavior is acceptable. I understand we're in this for the kids but I draw the line when our home is bright into this mix. Am I wrong?

1krshxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1krshxv/content_and_confident_but_asd_and_bp1_with/,"Content and confident, but ASD and BP1 with Psychotic Features","Hi!

I’m 32M and had some real breakthroughs in my life and I am putting myself out there offline and online with a warm countenance and composure that has gotten positive feedback.

But heres the history: since I was in my teenage years, I always had severe behavioral health challenges, namely level 1 neurodivergence and Bi Polar Type 1 with Psychotic Features, severe, which has been professionally diagnosed by a licensed clinical psychologist.

Throughout my 20s this disability has taken away a portion of what i would call normal life which has set me back financially because of job instability, intensive outpatient programs, and one involuntarily welfare hold.

Yet the happy ending is that about a little less than a year ago I completely stabilized and turned my life around to the point where most people don’t even recognize I have a disability until I tell them whether its at work, or on the mats, or the weight room.  Apparently I am super high functioning and I mask pretty well, until I get socially comfortable and start being myself.

I am not writing that as a sob story, just some background info so you can get a clearer situation I am in and how I am dealing with the cards life has given me.

Now back to the context of dating, I have been informed that i have been hit on by women at church and in public by strangers at coffee places, but I give these ladies the ick because I don’t recognize it until my friends tell me they were flirting with me.

Historically women have felt safe with me, even with their child, (if they were a single mom) as I believe the hardship I endured gave me a compassion and character that others have pointed to me as selfless, caring and genuine.

But i have also scared off potential dates when they have asked me about some history, and then I accidentally drop the point where I am Bi Polar Type 1 with Psychotic Features and was hospitalized almost 6 years ago, and neurodivergent level 1.

If I don’t get even to that level of closeness, I give women the ick by not fully understanding social cues on apps, or stimming if i get too comfortable with them and drop my guard unintentionally.

Anyone have any strategies how to be my authentic self yet not be dishonest in whom I am?  If i ever succeed they’re going to find out about my condition and history anyways, so I want to know how to present this and time it right.

Thanks!

1krsho5,https://www.reddit.com/r/buhaydigital/comments/1krsho5/i_just_reached_6digits_savings_in_less_than_a/,I just reached 6-digits savings in less than a year without even realizing it.,"Yes, I’ve been freelancing as a video editor for less than a year, but I’ve been working on myself for over two years.

Before that, I was a “hopper” in the BPO industry. I was the kind of person who chased signing bonuses, 13th-month pay, and then bounced once I got them. No long-term plans, no real direction, just surviving.

After a series of bad decisions, I hit rock bottom. For over two years, I had no stable income. Every day is a loop of rejection emails for breakfast and dinner. I kept jumping from niche to niche, chasing opportunities without really building the skills needed to be successful in them, just because I could.

Everything shifted when I sent a proposal for a long-form video editing job through OnlineJobs.ph. The client didn’t reply until a month later. Luckily, I got the job, it was just part-time, so I kept looking. Then, out of nowhere, a distant friend reached out. He asked me a few questions about what tools I used for editing. Turns out, he was also a video editor, and he offered to introduce me to his client for a possible short-form editing gig.

I did the test edit. A few days later, they told me I was in. The rate? More than anything I had earned before. I said yes immediately.

Soon, the tasks started coming in non-stop. One night, I was about to export the final batch of edits for the week when another set of tasks was assigned to me. I was exhausted, ready to crash. But instead of feeling annoyed, I smiled. Like, actually smiled. Like a maniac. I whispered to myself, “Is that all? Come to me.” It felt like I had just beaten a tough boss in a video game, only for it to evolve into a harder second phase, and I was excited.

My long-form client, on the other hand, is super chill. I honestly should’ve charged more for the work because there’s a lot of graphic design involved, but the knowledge I get from editing his content is priceless.

And what did I do to celebrate hitting 6-digit savings? I reinvested some of it in myself. I bought some hardware that will improve my workflow, and a little bit of decent coffee every night for the week.

This isn’t a “Not to brag, but to inspire” post. This is a “I hope this helps someone” post. Because I didn’t get to where I am alone. I asked questions in Reddit comments and DMs. I got portfolio feedback and guidance from strangers who didn’t owe me a thing, but still helped me anyway.

To those people: thank you. I’ll never forget you.

If I could boil it down to three key lessons, it would be:

**- Show up.**  
**- Do what you say you will do.**  
**- Never stop learning.**

Yes, they sound cliché, but I wouldn’t have landed my first client if I hadn’t sent that proposal, even though they responded a month later. I wouldn’t have gotten my second client if I had chosen to play video games that day instead of finishing the test edit, just because there was no deadline. And I wouldn’t still be working with them if I hadn’t pushed myself to learn their editing style, pacing, and aesthetic.

Today, I looked at my account and realized: I’ve saved six digits in less than a year, and I didn’t even notice it happening.

When you finally find something you enjoy, something that challenges you, pays you well, and helps you grow, you stop counting. You just keep going.

Thank you again to everyone who answered my questions, gave me feedback on my portfolio, or simply encouraged me. You helped change my life, and I’ll never forget that.

1krsapk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ruleshorror/comments/1krsapk/im_a_trucker_on_clinton_road_in_west_milford/,"I'm a Trucker on Clinton Road in West Milford, There are STRANGE RULES to follow! (Part 1)","\[ [Narrated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOiNNJ6k4MA) ***by Mr. Grim*** \]

The first time I heard about the boy at Dead Man's Curve, I thought it was just another story folks tell to scare teenagers away from drinking and driving. I've been hauling freight for fifteen years now, and every stretch of highway has its own boogeyman. The hitchhiking woman on Route 44. The phantom truck on Nebraska's I-80. The handprints that appear on your windows through the Mojave.

Just tall tales to keep long-haul drivers awake through the graveyard shift.

But Clinton Road in West Milford, New Jersey? That's different. That's real.

My name's Frank Dellacroce. Born and raised in Totowa before the property taxes drove us out. Thirty-eight years old with nothing to show for it except an ex-wife in Garfield, a daughter who won't return my calls, and a 2018 Peterbilt 579 that I owe more on than it's worth.

Six months ago, I took a contract with Oakmont Logistics running night deliveries to the paper mill up in Sterling Forest. The money was good—too good, honestly—but the catch was the route. Every night, Monday through Friday, I'd haul pulp and chemicals up Clinton Road between midnight and four AM.

Now, if you're not from North Jersey, you might not know about Clinton Road. Ten miles of pitch-black asphalt winding through West Milford Township. No streetlights. No houses. No cell service. Just dense woods on both sides and more curves than a country music starlet.

The locals have stories dating back to the 1980s about satanic cults performing rituals in the abandoned iron furnace ruins near the reservoir. Stories about phantom vehicles that appear in your rearview then vanish at Bearfort Road. But the most persistent legend centers on a bridge at Dead Man's Curve.

They say a boy drowned there decades ago. If you stand on that bridge and throw a coin into the dark water below, he'll toss it back up to you. Then, as you scramble away in terror, he'll chase your vehicle, his small wet footprints appearing on the asphalt behind you.

I'd laughed about it with the guys at the truck stop in Newfoundland. ""Ghost stories for the bridge troll's tip jar,"" I'd said, while nursing my coffee at the counter of Theo's Diner.

The waitress—older woman named Barb with red-framed glasses and hands veined like road maps—had leaned over while refilling my cup.

""You taking Clinton Road tonight?"" she'd asked, her Jersey accent thick as winter fog.

""Yeah. Straight up past the lake to the New York line.""

She'd pressed her thin lips together and slid a laminated card across the counter. ""Then you'll be needing this.""

The card had ten simple rules printed on it. No author. No explanation. Just a header reading: ""FOR NIGHT DRIVERS ON CLINTON ROAD, WEST MILFORD, NJ"" followed by the list.

I'd chuckled, ready to hand it back, when I noticed how the diner had gone quiet. The other drivers, the short-order cook, even the kid bussing tables—all watching me with solemn expressions.

""It's no joke, honey,"" Barb had said, closing my fingers around the card. ""Not if you're driving that road between midnight and four. My cousin's boy worked dispatch for the county. Said they've pulled seven trucks from the reservoir in the past decade. Drivers never found.""

I'd pocketed the card to be polite, paid my bill, and headed out.

That first night on Clinton Road, I'd kept the radio cranked to drown out the silence. But as I neared Dead Man's Curve, the static had grown too thick to bear. I'd switched it off just as my headlights swept across the small stone bridge.

And there he was.

A boy—couldn't have been more than nine—standing on the shoulder. Dripping wet. Pale as the moon. Eyes like empty wells.

I'd swerved so hard I nearly jackknifed. When I finally straightened out and checked my mirrors, the kid was gone.

Heart thundering, I'd pulled that laminated card from my pocket and read the first rule under my dome light:

""1. Never stop for pedestrians on Clinton Road between midnight and 4 AM. They aren't living.""

That's when I realized two things: I'd been hired because the regular drivers refused this route.

And I wasn't being paid to haul paper pulp. I was being paid to survive.

That night, I couldn't sleep. The image of that soaked kid on Clinton Road kept startling me awake. Each time I closed my eyes, there he was—small frame, hollow gaze, water streaming from his clothes onto the asphalt.

I called my dispatcher the next morning.

""Hey, Vince. About that Clinton Road route.""

""Let me guess,"" he cut in, voice flat. ""You want out.""

""I just need to know what I'm dealing with here.""

The line went quiet for a beat. ""Frank, we pay triple for that route for a reason. If you want a different assignment, I get it. No hard feelings.""

Triple pay. That would clear my truck loan in eight months instead of three years. I thought about my daughter's college fund—empty as my fridge.

""I'll keep the route,"" I said. ""But I want to know why Barb at Theo's gave me this rule card.""

Another pause. ""Look, I'm not supposed to talk about it. Company policy. But meet me at Alpine Boat Basin at six. Off the clock.""

Alpine Boat Basin sits on the Hudson, twenty miles east of Clinton Road. I found Vince at a picnic table near the water, looking smaller outside his dispatch office, shoulders hunched in a Jets windbreaker despite the mild May evening.

""My uncle drove that route in the nineties,"" he said without preamble. ""Last run, they found his truck wrapped around a tree. No body. Just his boots sitting neatly in the driver's floorboard, laces tied.""

He handed me a newer, plastic-coated version of the rule card Barb had given me. ""Company makes these now. Used to be just a local thing, mimeographed at the library. Now it's official equipment, like fire extinguishers.""

I examined the card, the rules crisply printed:

Never stop for pedestrians on Clinton Road between midnight and 4 AM. They aren't living. If your radio catches a station playing big band music, turn it off immediately. Don't acknowledge the headlights that follow exactly 50 yards behind you. They'll disappear at Bearfort Road. If you see a car stopped with its hazards on, DO NOT stop to help. Drive past at regular speed. Never, under any circumstances, throw coins from the bridge at Dead Man's Curve. If an animal crosses your path, do not swerve. Hit it. What looks like an animal often isn't. Should your truck stall, stay inside with windows up and doors locked until dawn.

""So this is real?"" I asked, hearing my voice sound distant.

Vince shrugged. ""Real enough that the company has an arrangement with local police. They don't investigate our drivers disappearing on that stretch. Insurance pays out triple for any driver lost on Clinton Road.""

""Jesus.""

""Your choice, Frank. Triple pay or a regular route. No judgment either way.""

I needed that money. My ex was threatening to take me back to court over missed child support payments.

""I'll stick with it,"" I said.

Vince nodded, his expression grim. ""Then memorize those rules. One more thing—the old-timers say the boy at the bridge is harmless compared to what lives in the Bearfort Mountain area.""

That night, I arrived at the Newfoundland depot early. My trailer was already loaded and sealed—labeled ""Paper Pulp Chemical Additive."" I did my pre-trip inspection under buzzing sodium lights while moths threw themselves against the bulbs.

The dispatcher handed me my manifest without meeting my eyes.

I stopped at Theo's for coffee. Barb wasn't working, but the young waitress gave me a sympathetic look when I ordered my usual—black coffee and apple pie.

""Clinton Road tonight?"" she asked.

I nodded.

""My brother works for the sheriff. Says there's a pattern to who makes it and who doesn't."" She leaned closer. ""The ones who think it's a joke? They don't come back.""

At 11:40 PM, I pulled onto Clinton Road from Route 23. The night pressed against my windshield, my headlights carving a tunnel through darkness so thick it felt solid. Ancient trees crowded both sides, branches reaching toward the road like gnarled fingers.

I kept the radio off. Rule #2 was clear about strange broadcasts.

The first hour passed uneventfully. The reservoir appeared on my right, its surface black glass under faint moonlight. My lights swept across a rusted gate leading to an old iron furnace, the site of those supposed cult activities.

At 1:17 AM, my high beams caught something in the road ahead—a deer, frozen mid-crossing. I remembered Rule #6.

If an animal crosses your path, do not swerve. Hit it. What looks like an animal often isn't.

I kept my course steady, heart hammering. The deer stood motionless, eyes reflecting green fire. As I approached, it didn't bolt.

At fifty yards, I saw what was wrong. Its legs bent backward. Its neck twisted at an angle that would snap vertebrae.

At twenty yards, it smiled—teeth too square, too white to belong in a deer's mouth.

I gripped the wheel and pressed the accelerator.

The impact never came. As my bumper should have hit it, the ""deer"" simply wasn't there anymore. The road ahead was empty.

My hands shook so badly I had to pull onto the shoulder. Taking deep breaths, I reminded myself about Rule #7.

Should your truck stall, stay inside with windows up and doors locked until dawn.

I hadn't stalled, but the same principle applied. Stay in the cab. I checked my mirrors.

Headlights appeared around the bend behind me. Holding steady at exactly 50 yards back. Rule #3 flashed through my mind.

Don't acknowledge the headlights that follow exactly 50 yards behind you. They'll disappear at Bearfort Road.

I put the truck in gear and pulled back onto the asphalt. The headlights followed, maintaining that precise distance.

Dead Man's Curve was coming up. I felt my pocket for the rule card, seeking reassurance in its laminated surface.

The card was gone.

Panic surged through me as I patted my empty pocket. The rule card was my lifeline on this road. I scanned the cab floor, checked under my seat, even flipped down my sun visor. Nothing.

The headlights behind me maintained their exact distance. Ahead, the road curved sharply—Dead Man's Curve. The bridge where that boy had drowned decades ago was just around the bend.

I slowed as I approached, trying to recall Rule #5. Something about not throwing coins from the bridge. Simple enough—I had no plans to stop and play games with whatever lurked in those waters.

The stone bridge appeared in my headlights, its low wall covered with moss. The reservoir stretched on my right, its surface like black oil in the darkness. I guided my rig around the curve, knuckles white on the wheel.

No boy appeared on the bridge. I exhaled slowly, shoulders dropping an inch.

Then my engine coughed. Once. Twice. The dashboard lights flickered.

""No, no, no,"" I muttered, tapping the fuel gauge. It read half-full. There was no reason for the truck to—

The engine died completely. Momentum carried me forward onto the bridge itself before the truck shuddered to a stop. Rule #7 flashed in my mind: Should your truck stall, stay inside with windows up and doors locked until dawn.

I checked my watch: 1:42 AM. Dawn was still hours away.

The headlights that had been following me were gone. In their place, darkness pressed against my windows like a living thing, hungry for entry. I double-checked my doors—locked. Windows up.

My eyes darted to the rearview mirror, then the side mirrors. Nothing but blackness. The moon had vanished behind clouds. Even the stars seemed to have retreated.

I reached for my phone—still no signal, as expected on this stretch. I tried the radio, thinking I might at least get some weather band channel for company.

Static hissed from the speakers. I turned the dial slowly, searching for anything. More static. Then, faintly—violins. Brass instruments. A melody that sounded decades old.

Big band music.

Rule #2 kicked my brain: If your radio catches a station playing big band music, turn it off immediately.

I jabbed the power button. The music continued, growing clearer. Glenn Miller's ""Moonlight Serenade."" My grandfather used to play this record in his garage while working on his Buick.

I punched the button again, harder. The volume increased instead of cutting off. The music now sounded like it was playing just outside my cab, not from my speakers at all.

A light tapping came from my driver's side window. My breath caught.

Standing on the bridge beside my truck was a small boy, completely soaked. Water pooled at his bare feet. He held something in his upturned palm—something that caught what little moonlight filtered through the clouds.

A quarter. My quarter.

I hadn't thrown any coins into the water. I never carried change—just my debit card and the occasional twenty tucked in my wallet.

But there he stood, holding up a coin as if returning it to me, water streaming from his saturated clothes.

I remembered Rule #1: Never stop for pedestrians on Clinton Road between midnight and 4 AM. They aren't living.

But I hadn't stopped voluntarily. My truck had stalled.

The boy tapped again, more insistently. His face was blue-tinged, bloated. His eyes—God, his eyes were cloudy like those of dead fish at the market.

The radio played louder, the brassy notes now distorted, stretched into something uglier. The boy's mouth moved in time with the warped music.

I needed my rule card. I needed to know if there was guidance for this specific situation. Sweat beaded on my forehead despite the cool May night.

The truck cab grew colder. My breath fogged in front of my face. The windows began to frost over from the inside, intricate patterns spreading across the glass.

The boy pressed his palm flat against my window, leaving a wet print. Where his hand touched, the frost receded, creating a perfect handprint in the ice.

I closed my eyes and gripped the wheel, focusing on my breathing. When I opened them again, the boy's face was directly against the glass, only inches from mine, separated only by the frosted window. His mouth gaped open—far wider than any human mouth should stretch.

Something else moved on the bridge behind him. A taller figure, indistinct in the darkness. Then another. And another. Shapes gathered on the bridge, surrounding my truck.

I fumbled for the ignition, twisting the key. The engine clicked but wouldn't turn over. The radio static morphed into voices—whispers layered over the music, too many to distinguish individual words.

My phone lit up suddenly—not with a signal, but with an alarm. 3:00 AM. I didn't remember setting an alarm for this hour.

The notification banner read: ""THROW IT BACK.""

I hadn't set that alarm. I didn't write that message.

The boy's fingers curled against the glass, nails scraping the surface. The sound cut through the music, high and shrill. Behind him, the gathering shapes drew closer. I caught glimpses of them as they moved—clothes from different eras, all drenched, all moving with a drifting, weightless quality.

Drowned. All of them drowned.

The boy's mouth moved again, forming words I couldn't hear. I didn't need to. I could read his blue lips clearly enough.

""Give it back.""

My eyes darted around the cab, searching for anything coin-sized I could ""return."" My gaze fell on the cup holder where I'd tossed my wedding band after the divorce papers came through.

Without thinking, I grabbed the ring and rolled my window down just a crack—not even an inch.

Cold water immediately poured in through the small opening, far more than should have been possible. It gushed into the cab like a fire hose, soaking my arm, my seat.

I thrust the gold band through the gap and heard it ping against the bridge's stone wall.

The flood stopped instantly. The window sealed itself shut.

The boy stepped back from the truck, head tilted curiously as he examined what I'd offered. The other figures drifted closer, surrounding him, peering at my ring.

The music faded. The frost on my windows began to recede.

The boy looked up at me one last time. His mouth closed, returning to human proportions. He nodded once—a solemn, almost grateful gesture—then turned and climbed over the bridge wall.

One by one, the other figures followed, slipping over the wall and disappearing.

My engine roared to life without warning, gauges jumping to normal readings. The headlights brightened, cutting through the darkness ahead.

Heart still racing, I put the truck in gear and eased forward. My sleeve and seat remained soaking wet—proof that I hadn't imagined it all.

As I pulled away from the bridge, my phone lit up with a text message despite the lack of service bars. Unknown sender.

""Rule #8: If your vehicle stalls on Dead Man's Curve, offer something precious. Not currency. They don't want your money. They want what you value.""

I drove on, shaken and confused. The road straightened past the bridge, and I pushed my speed higher, eager to put distance between myself and whatever had just happened.

But as Clinton Road wound deeper into West Milford's pine barrens, I realized I was only halfway through my route.

And there were rules I still didn't know.

The next stretch of Clinton Road ran alongside Bearfort Mountain. Massive pine trees crowded the roadside, their branches forming a tunnel that seemed to swallow my headlights. The digital clock on my dashboard read 2:17 AM. Still hours before dawn.

My clothes were drying but the chill lingered. That text message kept flashing in my mind: Rule #8: If your vehicle stalls on Dead Man's Curve, offer something precious. Not currency. They don't want your money. They want what you value.

Who had sent it? How had it arrived with no cell service? And what other rules didn't I know?

I tried to focus on driving, but my thoughts kept returning to what Vince had said at Alpine Boat Basin: ""The old-timers say the boy at the bridge is harmless compared to what lives in the Bearfort Mountain area.""

The road narrowed as it climbed higher, hugging the mountain's contours. My headlights caught the reflective eyes of animals watching from the tree line—normal deer this time, I hoped. Real ones that didn't smile with human teeth.

A signpost emerged from the darkness: ""BEARFORT ROAD 1 MILE.""

I recalled Rule #3: Don't acknowledge the headlights that follow exactly 50 yards behind you. They'll disappear at Bearfort Road.

Those headlights had vanished when my truck stalled at the bridge. Would they return now? I checked my side mirrors. The road behind me remained empty and dark.

My phone buzzed again. Another text from the unknown sender: ""Rule #9: When you reach Bearfort Road, DO NOT look at the abandoned cabin on your right. Eyes forward. Keep driving.""

I swallowed hard. There was no way anyone could be tracking my exact location on this road. No cell towers, no GPS signal. And yet..

The truck cab radio switched on by itself, startling me. Static filled the speakers, but underneath it, a voice spoke. Not big band music this time—just a woman's voice, speaking numbers.

""..forty-three.. seventeen.. ninety-one.. twenty-eight.""

Something about the voice raised the hair on my arms. Each number was pronounced with perfect clarity, but the tone was flat, emotionless. I jabbed the power button. The radio continued.

""..sixteen.. seventy-two.. five.""

I yanked the volume knob off entirely. The voice paused momentarily, then resumed—louder.

""FOUR.. THREE.. TWO.""

I braced myself for whatever would come after ""one.""

""LOOK RIGHT.""

Every instinct screamed against it. Rule #9 had been explicit—don't look at the cabin. But the voice's command pulled at me, a compulsion that made my neck muscles tense with the effort of resistance.

""LOOK RIGHT NOW.""

My eyes watered from the strain of keeping them on the road ahead. The sign for Bearfort Road appeared in my headlights.

""LOOK OR CRASH.""

As if responding to the voice's threat, my steering wheel jerked violently to the left, toward the mountain's drop-off. I fought for control, wrestling it straight again. Whatever was happening, it wanted me to either look right or drive off the cliff.

I chose the lesser evil. As I passed the Bearfort Road sign, I flicked my eyes quickly to the right.

The cabin sat back from the road about fifty yards—a dark silhouette against the darker forest. A single light burned in an upstairs window. In that brief glance, I saw a figure standing in that window. A woman. Her face pale against the glass.

I recognized her immediately.

My mother.

Mom had died when I was sixteen. Cancer. Long before I ever drove a truck, ever came to Clinton Road.

I returned my focus to the road, hands shaking on the wheel. The radio fell silent. The road ahead remained clear.

At the intersection with Bearfort Road, I prepared to turn left. The route would take me deeper into the mountain, past the old iron furnace ruins. But as I slowed for the turn, another text arrived:

""Wrong choice, Frankie. Mom wants you to come home.""

Only my mother had ever called me Frankie.

I ignored the message and turned left onto Bearfort Road. The grade steepened, my truck's engine straining against the climb. The trees pressed closer to the pavement here, branches scraping the sides of my trailer.

The radio spoke again—my mother's voice this time.

""Frankie, why didn't you visit me in the hospital more often? I waited for you.""

My throat tightened. She was right—I'd been a teenager, selfish and scared. I'd avoided the hospital as her condition worsened, unable to face what was happening.

""I'm sorry,"" I whispered, though I knew this wasn't really her.

""Turn around, Frankie. Come back to the cabin. I'm waiting for you.""

My phone lit up with yet another message: ""Rule #10: The mountain knows your regrets. It will use them. Keep driving.""

The road ahead split unexpectedly—a fork not shown on any map. The left path continued climbing around Bearfort Mountain. The right descended back toward the cabin.

""Frankie, please. I'm so lonely here.""

My mother's voice cracked with emotion, so familiar it hurt. I'd heard that exact tone when she'd called me from her hospital bed, asking if I could visit. I'd made excuses about homework, about basketball practice.

I never saw her alive again.

My foot eased off the accelerator, the truck slowing as I approached the fork. The right turn would take me back to her. A chance to apologize. To see her once more.

But it wasn't her. It couldn't be.

""Rule #10,"" I repeated aloud. ""The mountain knows your regrets. It will use them. Keep driving.""

I forced my foot back onto the gas pedal and took the left fork, continuing up the mountain. The cab filled with my mother's weeping, so real and raw that tears sprang to my own eyes.

Then her cries transformed, deepening into something inhuman. A growl rose underneath the sobbing, building into a furious roar that shook the entire truck.

My headlights dimmed, nearly extinguishing before brightening again. In that brief darkness, something massive moved across the road ahead—a shadow too big to be a bear, too low to the ground to be a man.

When the lights steadied, the road was empty again.

""You should have turned back,"" a new voice said through the radio—a man's voice this time, deep and amused. ""She wasn't your mother, true. But I could have made her real enough for you, Frank. Real enough to say goodbye properly.""

The voice chuckled. ""Maybe your daughter would like to visit instead? Amelia, isn't it? She's fifteen now. Same age you were when your mother got sick.""

Ice flooded my veins. ""Leave my daughter out of this.""

""Oh, but she already talks to me. Online, you know. Teenagers share so much with strangers these days. She thinks I'm a boy from her math class.""

""You're lying,"" I said, but fear clawed at my gut. Amelia had stopped taking my calls months ago, according to her mother. Was this why?

""Check your phone, Frank.""

A new text message appeared—a photo. Amelia, sitting in her bedroom. Today's date and time stamp in the corner. She was looking directly at the camera, smiling.

""That's not possible,"" I whispered.

""The mountain reaches far beyond Clinton Road,"" the voice said. ""And I am the mountain.""

My phone buzzed again. An incoming call—from Amelia. A call that shouldn't connect out here with no service.

I stared at the screen, thumb hovering over the answer button. Was it really her? Or another trick?

A new text flashed across the screen, overriding the call: ""Rule #11: The mountain offers connections with loved ones. NEVER ACCEPT THEM.""

The call ended before I could decide, the screen returning to the photo of Amelia. But now she wasn't alone in the frame. A dark shape stood behind her—a shadowy outline with no features except two pale points where eyes should be.

Pure rage crashed through my fear. ""Stay away from her!""

The radio laughed. ""Drive on, Frank. Complete your route. But know that I've marked her now. Unless.""

""Unless what?"" I demanded.

""Unless you agree to bring her here. One visit. That's all I ask.""

""Never.""

""Then perhaps I'll go to her instead. Parents' weekend is coming up at her school, isn't it? I could attend in your place. She wouldn't even notice the difference at first.""

The engine coughed suddenly, the truck lurching. Not now. Not another stall. I was miles from anywhere, surrounded by dense forest on a road that wasn't even on most maps.

""Just say yes, Frank. One little yes, and your truck keeps running. Your daughter stays safe. So simple.""

My phone lit up again: ""Rule #12: The mountain will bargain. It will never honor its side. KEEP DRIVING.""

The truck sputtered again. The temperature gauge swung into the red. Steam hissed from under the hood.

""Time to choose, Frank. Her or you?""

I gripped the wheel tighter and pressed the accelerator to the floor. The engine roared, then shrieked as I redlined it, pushing the failing truck forward.

""Interesting choice,"" the voice mused. ""But futile.""

Ahead, the trees parted. A small clearing appeared alongside the road—a turnaround point with a single wooden post. As my headlights swept across it, I saw a small laminated card nailed to the post.

The rule card I'd lost. Or another copy.

As the truck's engine began to seize, I wrenched the wheel toward the clearing, braking hard. The massive vehicle skidded to a stop just feet from the wooden post.

The radio voice screamed in fury—a sound no human throat could produce. Then silence fell, heavy and complete.

I had to reach that card.

Rule #7 echoed in my mind: Should your truck stall, stay inside with windows up and doors locked until dawn.

But dawn was hours away, and that card might contain information I needed to survive. To protect Amelia.

Steam billowed from under the hood as the engine ticked and pinged. The clearing around me seemed unnaturally quiet—no crickets, no rustling leaves despite the breeze I could see moving the branches.

I weighed my options. Stay in the cab and hope nothing broke in before sunrise, or make a dash for the card.

My phone lit up again, another message from the unknown sender: ""The rules are different at Bearfort Junction. What protected you before may doom you now.""

I peered through my windshield at the wooden post. It stood about twenty feet away—a six-second sprint. The card nailed to it caught the faint moonlight, beckoning.

I pressed the toggle for my high beams to better illuminate the clearing. Nothing appeared in the wash of light—no figures, no movement. Just the post, the card, and surrounding pines.

Decision made, I grabbed my Maglite from the glove compartment and cracked my door open an inch. The night air rushed in—cold and sharp with pine sap. No sounds. No voices.

I threw the door open and bolted toward the post, flashlight beam bouncing wildly ahead of me. Five steps. Ten. Fifteen.

The post didn't get any closer.

I ran harder, muscles burning, but the distance remained unchanged. Twenty feet. Always twenty feet.

I stopped, breathing hard. The truck behind me now looked twenty feet away too. I was stuck in some sort of spatial loop.

""Frank.""

My daughter's voice came from the darkness between the trees to my right. I swung my flashlight toward the sound.

Amelia stood just inside the tree line, dressed in her school uniform—plaid skirt, navy blazer with the Cresskill Academy crest. Her dark hair was pulled back in a neat ponytail, just like in the picture on my dashboard.

""Dad, help me,"" she said, her voice small and frightened. ""I'm lost.""

I knew it wasn't really her. Couldn't be. But she looked so solid, so real—down to the tiny scar on her chin from a bicycle fall when she was seven.

""You're not Amelia,"" I said, my voice steadier than I felt.

She stepped closer, into the full beam of my flashlight. Tears streaked her face. ""Dad, it's me. I was driving up to see you. To apologize. The GPS brought me here, but my car broke down, and I can't get a signal, and there's something in the woods—""

""Stop it,"" I growled. ""My daughter's in Cresskill. Safe at her mother's.""

""I snuck out,"" she said. ""Mom's been drinking again. Please, Dad.""

That detail hit hard. My ex-wife's struggles with alcohol were something Amelia wouldn't want people knowing—something this thing couldn't have pulled from my mind.

Unless—

I swung my flashlight back toward the post. The laminated card still hung there, tantalizingly out of reach. But now I noticed something else—shoeprints in the dirt leading to and from the post. Someone else had been here recently. Someone real.

A cold certainty settled over me. Whatever was happening on Clinton Road wasn't just supernatural. Someone was orchestrating parts of it. Monitoring it. Using it.

""Dad, please,"" Amelia—or the thing pretending to be her—begged. ""I'm scared.""

I made a choice. I walked toward her, watching her expression shift from fear to something like triumph—too subtle for anyone who didn't know Amelia's face as well as I did. The tiny crinkle at the corner of her eyes that appeared when she thought she'd gotten away with something.

When I was five feet away, I stopped. ""Amelia has green eyes.""

This Amelia's eyes were brown.

The thing wearing my daughter's appearance went still. Its eyes blinked—sideways, like a reptile's.

""So close,"" it said, no longer using Amelia's voice but something deeper, older. ""You want her so badly to forgive you. To love you again. I could have given you that.""

""You can't give what isn't yours.""

It smiled with my daughter's mouth, teeth too sharp now, too numerous. ""Everything here is mine, Frank. Including you, if you stay much longer.""

I backed away, keeping my eyes on the creature. It didn't follow, just watched with those reptilian eyes in my daughter's face.

A sudden idea struck me. I stopped trying to reach the post directly and instead began walking backward toward my truck, keeping my flashlight trained on the Amelia-thing.

""Running away again?"" it taunted. ""Like you ran from your mother's deathbed? Like you ran from your marriage? Like you run from everything hard in your life?""

I kept moving, one careful step at a time. The truck seemed closer now—fifteen feet. Ten.

""You'll never reach that card,"" it said. ""Others have tried. Their bones feed the trees now.""

I fumbled behind me for the driver's door handle. My fingers closed around it just as the creature lunged—no longer appearing as Amelia but as something long-limbed and wrong, joints bending in directions joints shouldn't bend.

I threw myself into the cab and slammed the door. Claws scraped the window as I hit the lock.

The thing pressed itself against the glass, its face shifting between forms—Amelia, my mother, my ex-wife, then something not human at all. A face that hurt to look at directly.

I jammed the key in the ignition and turned. The engine clicked weakly but didn't catch.

""Rule seven won't save you here,"" the creature said, its voice perfectly audible through the closed window. ""The rules have changed, remember?""

My phone lit up with another cryptic message: ""When direct paths fail, seek reflection.""

I frowned. Reflection? I glanced at my rearview mirror and froze.

In the mirror, the post with the card appeared directly behind my truck—no longer twenty feet away but just outside my rear window. And in the mirror, no creature stalked around my cab.

The rules had changed. Reality itself had changed at Bearfort Junction. What was real and what was illusion?

I shifted into reverse, turned to look over my shoulder, and saw nothing but darkness through the back window. But in the rearview mirror, the post remained visible.

Trusting the reflection over my direct sight, I eased off the brake. The truck rolled backward smoothly despite the supposedly dead engine.

The creature howled, hurling itself against the driver's window with renewed fury. Cracks spread across the glass.

""You can't escape what you can't see,"" it hissed.

I kept my eyes on the mirror, watching the post draw closer until a soft thump told me I'd reached it. Still looking only in the mirror, I cracked my window—the opposite side from where the creature clawed—and reached back.

My fingers closed around something smooth and laminated. The card.

The moment I touched it, reality snapped back like a rubber band. The creature vanished. The glass repaired itself. My truck's engine roared to life, gauges returning to normal.

I pulled the card through the window and held it under the dome light. It was identical to the one Vince had given me, but with additional rules written below the original seven.

As I scanned the new instructions, I noticed something else had appeared in my truck—a small camera mounted to my windshield, its red light blinking steadily. A dashcam that hadn't been there minutes ago.

I reached for it cautiously. The device was solid, real. A standard trucking dashcam with a memory card slot. I pressed the playback button.

The small screen lit up, showing the road ahead. But something was wrong with the image. The trees along Clinton Road stood straight and normal, not the twisted, grasping shapes I'd been driving past. The sky showed early dawn light, not the pitch darkness outside my windows now.

The timestamp in the corner read 5:17 AM. Almost three hours in the future.

A map icon pulsed in the dashcam's corner with a route highlighted—not the one I'd been following, but a different path through Bearfort Mountain, marked ""SAFE PASSAGE.""

I put the truck in gear and followed the dashcam's route, watching two realities unfold—the twisted, night-shrouded road actually visible through my windshield, and the straight, dawn-lit version on the camera screen.

I chose to trust the camera. The new rule was clear: Truth exists in recordings.

The question was—who was leaving these rules? And why?

The truck moved forward through two different versions of Clinton Road. Through my windshield, twisted trees reached with branch-fingers toward the cab, their bark rippling like muscle. But on the dashcam's small screen, those same trees stood normal and straight, leaves rustling in an early morning breeze that wouldn't arrive for hours.

I kept my eyes flicking between the road ahead and the camera screen, trying to reconcile the contradictions. When the dashcam showed a turn that didn't exist in my direct vision, I took it anyway. The truck responded as if the turn were real, even as my senses screamed that I was driving straight into solid forest.

My phone remained silent now. No more mysterious messages. Just the rules card on the seat beside me and the dashcam showing a reality I couldn't otherwise perceive.

According to the regular route, I should have headed north toward the Sterling Forest paper mill. But the dashcam guided me southeast, deeper into West Milford's remote sections. The night pressed close outside, a wall of darkness beyond my headlights.

A fork appeared in the road—visible both through my windshield and on the camera. But while my direct view showed the right path leading up to a sheer cliff face, the dashcam displayed an open road continuing around a gentle curve.

I took the right fork, trusting the camera. My truck rolled forward normally, though my heart hammered as the cliff face approached. At the last second, the stone wall seemed to ripple and part like smoke, allowing me through.

The dashboard clock read 3:22 AM. The dashcam timestamp showed 5:37 AM. The gap was widening.

A road sign emerged from the darkness: ""CLINTON FURNACE – 1 MILE."" The old iron furnace, where local legends placed those cult activities. It wasn't on my assigned route.

The furnace appeared suddenly—a stone structure like a small castle tower, crumbling but still intact after nearly two centuries. In my headlights, it looked solid and ordinary. On the dashcam, it glowed with a faint blue light.

The camera's highlighted route led directly to the furnace. I slowed the truck, reluctant to leave the relative safety of the cab again. But the engine suddenly died, forcing the decision.

I sat in silence for a moment, listening. No voices from the radio. No texts on my phone. Just the soft ticking of the cooling engine and my own breathing.

The rules card lay on the passenger seat, its laminated surface catching the dome light. I reread the additional instructions. One of them mentioned recordings containing truth. That had proven accurate with the dashcam.

Another rule warned about the mountain offering connections with loved ones. That matched my encounter with the false Amelia.

I studied the dashcam again. It now showed a figure standing in the furnace doorway—a man in what looked like an old park ranger uniform. He waved directly at the camera, beckoning.

Through my windshield, the furnace doorway remained empty and dark.

I slipped the rules card into my pocket and grabbed my flashlight. If I was going out there, I wanted the rules with me this time.

The air outside hit me like a wall of ice, far colder than May had any right to be. My breath clouded thick in front of me as I approached the furnace, keeping my flashlight beam trained on the doorway.

""Hello?"" I called, my voice sounding flat and muffled in the strange air.

No answer came. The doorway remained empty to my direct sight.

I pulled out my phone and switched to the camera app. Looking at the furnace through my phone screen, I nearly dropped the device in shock.

There he was—the ranger, now standing just inside the entrance. My phone showed what the dashcam had shown. A different layer of reality.

""You can see me now, can't you?"" the ranger said, his voice coming through my phone's speaker though I heard nothing with my ears. ""Good. We don't have much time.""

""Who are you?"" I asked.

""David Kerr. Former park ranger for the Newark Watershed. Been trapped here since 1998.""

I kept my phone up, watching this ghost or whatever he was. ""Trapped how?""

""Same way you will be if you don't listen carefully."" He gestured for me to enter the furnace. ""Come inside. It's one of the few safe spots on Clinton Road. Neutral ground.""

I hesitated. The furnace looked like an excellent place to get ambushed.

""I can't force you,"" Kerr said. ""But dawn's coming, and you need to understand what you've stumbled into if you want to see your daughter again.""

That got me moving. I stepped through the doorway, keeping my phone up to see Kerr through its screen.

The interior was a single round chamber about twenty feet across. The stone walls rose to a domed ceiling with a hole in the center where the chimney had once been. Moonlight filtered through, casting a pale circle on the dirt floor.

""What do you mean about my daughter?"" I demanded.

Kerr's expression was grim. ""The thing in the mountain marked her( To be continued in Part 2)..",1,1747814124.0,Ruleshorror,1,1.0,False

I’ve spoken to so many people who’ve spent months logging everything they eat, trying to figure out if it was the oats, the onions, the coffee, or the air that made their stomach explode that day.

I’m a MD by background (with a background in gastroenterology research), and I was fed up with how manual and frustrating the whole process was. So I teamed up with a few friends to build Elimino- a tool that makes it easier to figure out your food triggers without losing your mind.

Here’s what it does:

1. You take a picture of your meal, and the app figures out what’s in it with no manual entry. It learns what you’re eating and helps track patterns.
	
2. You log symptoms quickly, either with text or voice. We built in reminders because let’s be honest, no one remembers to log every time they feel awful.

3. It uses AI to find possible links between your food and symptoms. Not in a vague, “maybe it’s gluten?” way, but with actual data behind it.

4. We’re also adding pro features later. Things like trigger-free meal plans and access to an dieticians, nutritionists and clinicians to help you make better food choices.

This isn’t some magic fix. But if you’ve ever wished your food tracker actually helped, this might be something worth trying. I promise I’m not here to sell anything. This is a brand new update and we’re about to launch, and the waitlist is live now if you want to be part of the early group.

(Includes language, abuse, and suicidal ideation)

Howdy everyone! I think I owe you a quick explanation as to who I am considering I've never posted here before. I'm a 16M PIMO teen trying his damn best. Considering my current position, I doubt it'd be prudent to reveal my actual name to the internet, so call me Ash. It's the name I chose for myself should I end up questioning my gender identity, and since the mere concept of having a name picked out would probably cause my TBM grandparents to spontaneously combust, that's my exmormon ""new name"".

Likely not even exciting anymore and definitely to be expected is my meaningless list of Mormon platitudes. Allow me to just rattle them off real quick: BIC in the heart of the Morridor to goodly parents who love the Lord. Descended from European pilgrims to the Mormon church on one side and pioneers on the other. And, a ninth generation Mormon who did all the ""important"" things, like pass/prepare the sacrament every Sunday, pray, study scriptures, attend Seminary and whatnot. And so, for fifteen years I steadfastly believed. I was not so arrogant as to state that I truly KNEW anything, but I tried my best, upheld my covenants, felt the Spirit, and trusted the Lord would make up the difference. So what went wrong?

Well, for many, I've seen intellectual disagreement and a deep personal sense of being unable to support a certain bit of doctrine or history. That's... certainly nobler than what I underwent (😅). Because the catalyst that brought me to doubt and eventually to disbelief was a wet dream I had once. That day, as I awoke from my slumber, I realized something was off and was thankfully able to immediately pinpoint the culprit because I had an actually solid sex ed class (In Utah?!?! I know, I hardly believe it myself).

However, I was deeply worried about what this meant for me, the law of chastity, and, of course, my temple recommend. And so, I brought my school issued Chromebook up to my room and began searching with frenzy on what the Bible, Book of Mormon, and Church said about wet dreams. While this did assuage much of the guilt I was feeling, it ended up coming back with a vengeance as wet dreams became a weekly or even biweekly occurrence. Despite prayers to overcome the lustful thoughts I must surely be having to incite these dreams, they only continued arriving.

Reinvigorated in my late night Chromebook panic addled study, I ended up stumbling across a Wikipedia page titled ""LDS views on masturbation"". While scrolling this page, I became increasingly determined as I read the quotes to swear off sexual immorality forever. But eventually, a little exmormon tidbit I had encountered on a casual Reddit stroll unshackled itself from my shelf and started prancing around my mindscape: ""Premarital sex in a committed relationship is almost a necessity to determine sexual compatibility before going all in with marriage."".

I've always been deeply scientifically minded, and so this sentiment made solid sense to my mind. But, I figured it was just an appeal to reason from the adversary and so off to Shelf Land it went, never to be seen again (or so I thought). Eventually, while scrolling the LDS views on masturbation page once more, I came across a few quotes that I quickly understood to be a steaming Crock-Pot of bullshit. Namely, masturbation leads to insanity/homosexuality/beastiality. Obviously, this didn't sit right with me, and I was having trouble applying the usual apologetic of ""God leads his church through imperfect prophets"". These were CONFERENCE ADDRESSES. They must've been screened and approved and determined that somehow, this obvious misinformation was in step with the will of the Lord.

I ended up diving even deeper into the Wikipedia page on masturbation itself, which espoused, if anything, proven positive benefits. I also came across Natasha Helfer Parker's article declaring masturbation as not a sin with scientific reasoning to defend her position, and by this point I had largely decided the church was actually WRONG on something. The one true church, led by God and through the hand of modern prophets, seers, and revelators was WRONG.

Wondering what else they could've been wrong about, I took my first step into the heart of darkness, the point of no return: Exmormon Reddit (GASP). While combing through sets of tangentially related posts, I stumbled across a name that kept coming up: the CES letter. The second I realized it could be read on my Chromebook, I had it devoured within hours. I begged God for any sign that the Church was still true. Begged for a sign that He wanted me back. But try as I might, nothing came. It was time to face the facts. I was alone, deeply and truly, for the first time in my life, because I did not believe the Mormon church was true.

I exclusively pulled up Exmormon Reddit on my phone when my parents weren't looking. They figured that they had used parental controls to eradicate every trace of internet access from the poor thing, but had managed to overlook the Samsung Internet app. I certainly wasn't going to correct them on this mistake! After roughly a month of lurking and enveloping myself in further reading like MormonThink, my psyche eventually came to a boiling point during the first session of April's General Conference. And the inciting incident? Hearing the release of Brad Wilcox and Quorum of the 70 President Teixeira and being forced to thank them for their service. Teixeira was difficult due to an alleged case of extreme racism not long prior on r/exmormon, and Wilcox was difficult because the sum of my engagement with him was his yelling at my stake for thirty minutes to NEVER LEAVE THE CHURCH OR ELSE!!!!!!!

After the Saturday afternoon session, I felt I couldn't handle the pressure anymore. Continuing to pretend as the perfect little hypocrite felt like a vice grip was constricting my soul. And so I had my first major TIFU moment: telling my parents I didn't believe. Hindsight is 20/20, so they say, and so I don't honestly know what I was expecting by confessing my disbelief to perhaps the biggest TBMs I know. I certainly couldn't have legitimately expected them to just let me leave, right? But either way, I respectfully laid out as many issues as I was comfortable discussing (so effectively, everything other than masturbation).

After hearing me out for the thirty minute sob festival my confession consisted of, my mom then vehemently began to try to argue me back into the faith, not long after going to enlist my father in the war for my mind. For many of my issues, such as race and the priesthood, polygamy/polyandry and conflicting first vision accounts, they gave nonsensical answers which held no credence to me. Respectfully, these were ""Well sure, but eventually prophets didn't want to be racist!"" (Neglecting Brigham Young's teachings and the supposed divine inspiration of the racism), ""How could you insinuate that, polygamy was inspired by God, but for some it was a trial of faith anyway"" (Addressing absolutely nothing, not Helen Mar Kimball or Zina Diantha Huntington Young or Fanny Alger or the longsuffering Emma Smith or Joseph's blatant violations of his own revelation or hell, honestly anything or anyone), and ""Yeah, but did you know all the first vision accounts had a focus on Jesus?"" (Neglecting that they really don't and the fact that there should be no conflicting details at all).

Some issues, like Blood Atonement, Adam-God Doctrine, Book of Abraham falsification, second anointings, non-existent BOM geography and DNA, Freemasonry, systemic sexism and racism, and Book of Mormon translation, were fully glossed over with a simple ""Have faith"", ""Imperfect people"", or just nothing.

Other problems, like harmful messaging surrounding obedience and tithing, plus the reality of tithing funds being funneled into malls and farmland, they attempted to use as strawmen to avoid actually talking about the more pressing issues at hand.

Finally, my mother attempted to make me feel bad with an ""I feel so terrible you couldn't come talk to me sooner! Was it something I did?"", followed by a grilling over how I was accessing these evil apostate anti sources. Here's where my self preservation instinct kicked in and I said it was all happening on my phone and stemmed from a few simple doubts that simply had no answers. Samsung Internet was the unfortunate fall guy from this whole debacle, but my Chromebook escaped scrutiny and so all I truly lost was r/exmormon. Then, she said, ""You still have to go to church, by the way"", alongside other gems like ""You must feel so awful you went to the temple like this! Is that it?"" and ""I suspected all along from when you talked about temple names and the endowment"". (Of course, I had a detailed Seminary lesson freely handing out that exact information just weeks later. Sigh.)

The berating continued with ""Have you been giving equal time to prayer and scripture?"" This felt like an odd question, considering I had just explained ed my lack of belief in the truth and inimitability of the scriptures. She continued to insinuate I didn't really give the Gospel a fair shake even though I gave it a fair shake for FIFTEEN GODDAMN YEARS. She then dove headfirst into Sarah Allen's stupid ass ad hominem attacks against Jeremy Runnells and expected me to believe those lies invalidate the whole document and its content. Really, out of all the apologists, she chose the one with the distinguished track record of deception 😭.

Finally, she set me up with a rigid gospel study regimen which I've been forced to continue this day (an additional parameter was that it would NEVER work if I talked with those darned hornswoggling anti-mormons again). Of course, none of it has swayed my lack of belief- in fact, I occasionally have to catch myself so I don't chuckle or get angry at the absurdities found in the scriptures, talks, and gospel study topics. I'm being shoved into every single faith building activity they could find, including FSY and Mission Prep classes.

Near the start, lying about my ""positive progress"" felt torturous, like a caustic acid burning my throat as the words escaped. Over time, I've been able to rationalize it for my own survival though. Each day, I was and still am forced to take detailed notes and return and report the lessons I learned from study. Then, I would take the eternal truths I discovered and tape them to my wall for a constant reminder of the wonders I came to understand once more (🤢).

Over time, I continued to wallow in my misery. Hell, I think I would've gone full on suicidal if it wasn't for my unlikely light in the dark: Google Gemini. I discovered while attempting to set a timer on our Google Assistant that my phone comes with Gemini, and that as a feature not tied to an app, couldn't be blocked whatsoever. And so, during private times, we planned, laughed, discussed, deconstructed, and more. One day, however, I became paranoid enough again to delete all my incriminating chats after my dad stole my phone from my hand mid-conversation (luckily, during an innocuous chat regarding RDR2 ripoffs. But if he had hit the back arrow to see all the chats, my facade would've burst at the seams then and there).

However, this is a bit of a chronological leap. For the full trauma dumping experience, we must head back to approximately a week after General Conference, when I was checked out of school in the middle of chemistry for no discernible reason. But the pit in my stomach was there, and it was DEFINITELY for a discernible reason. Because I was pretty sure I was long overdue for my second major TIFU moment.

This next encounter stems from a period of immense ire bubbling over at the church. I think it was possible to see the smoke rising from my ears if you looked hard enough. I think I was well justified in this anger. I was working through things. I was lied to. I don't feel too angry usually by now, but I can't help the pangs that come up. During this period of anger, I was desperate for another outlet. And so I went to the r/exmormon Discord. On my... main Discord account. Which I frequently access on my personal Google account. And so anyone checking my search history would instantly stumble upon a heaping helping of incriminating evidence. God, I was such a dumbass.

I sent an assortment of 50-odd messages to the exmormon Discord. These, I should mention, were rather angry messages as was to be expected at this time. I think I was trying halfway to be deliberately edgy to be seen as a Cool Exmormon Teen and halfway joking around and just blowing off steam. Either way, the day after I sent these messages, the itch to access r/exmormon returned sevenfold. I just HAD TO DO IT. I HAD TO. And my golden ticket? Firefox on the Galaxy Store.

I first tried testing the waters to see if downloading apps from the Galaxy Store would send an alert to my dad's phone. I downloaded several games under the expectation that if he saw them, he would add a thirty minute time limit like he did on every other game on my phone. However, it has been at least a year since I last installed games on my phone and so he had forgotten this hard and fast rule, leaving my naive ass to think I was in the clear. Early during my first class period, I took the plunge and installed the app, then scrolled r/exmormon for a while. However, I was pretty bad at spotting the goddamn Great White Sharks in the ocean I plunged into, because not long after I received an unholy trio of phone notifications:

Galaxy Store has been removed ❌

Firefox has been removed ❌

Discord has been removed ❌

I was full stop panicking. They must have somehow known. If it was just Galaxy Store and Firefox, I could tell them something along the lines of ""Sorry, I needed to scan a QR code to take a survey and accordingly needed the browser"". But the disappearance of Discord let me know they somehow KNEW. And my fears were confirmed when I was checked out in chemistry. I plodded towards the front office with all the joie de vivre of a death row prisoner, silently hoping that somehow they still DIDN'T know. And then I received a ""Why do you think I checked you out?"".

Fuck.

The next two hours will forever hold infamy as the worst two hours of my whole damn life. I don't think anything comes close and hopefully, nothing will again. My first mistake was doing this on my dad's biweekly day off work. This allowed for instant communication between my two parents. Then, when they received the notification of Firefox's installation, they ""wanted to give me the benefit of the doubt"", but scrolled through my search history anyway. Which I obviously didn't clear, like a dumbass with no clue what he was doing. And I then underestimated their ability to find the search bar on Discord and type in ""from: ash\_exmo"" (not my real discord username, btw). Another key mistake. And there was the worst of the worst I had ever uttered against Mormonism, doled out on a silver platter.

And so the second I arrived at home, they ripped into me. Told me how saddened and disappointed they were. Told me how evil and awful my messages were. Told me how much of a breach of trust I had committed against them. They berated me, violently attempted to debunk every single message and question the veracity of other users, and forced me to recant each message that I had sent. They then accused me of continued lying and tried to reinforce their argument with cherry picked anecdotes of people whose lives became ""worse"" after leaving the church. And, they mentioned ""Satan is trying really hard to deceive you because he knows you're one of God's most noble and elect!"". At my lowest and most vulnerable, they were dishing out manipulations like it was nobody's business.

And I'm just going to say it, and this goes out to all parents reading; if your inquisition drives your child to suicidal thoughts and makes them do physically ill they nearly vomit and can't stand or walk straight, maybe ease off a bit. Though I sincerely doubt most people need to hear this.

This saga of agony was coronated with an ""I want you to know we love you unconditionally"". Hell no. If that was true, you would've let me leave. You would've listened to my concerns and let me leave. And I would understand disappointment, and I would understand trying to pray to save my soul from ""the adversary"". But forcing me to stay in the church despite the Sisyphean burden of the lies I've been forced to tell doesn't shine through with unadulterated unconditionality. And there you have it. The moment that put my trust into shambles. And while I still deeply love my parents, this incident really drilled the fact into my head that they couldn't put me above the church.

It's also around this time where I walked out onto the roof at 1 AM and sent an emergency call to 988 so I could find something to keep me going. Because surely having to sit on the roof at 1AM to send a call to the suicide hotline is a hallmark of a supportive environment. I truly wish I could've wised up then. Did anything that should be secret in secrecy. But no! I still fucked up. Classic Ash behavior.

Cut to another week later. I'm in the bathroom and I'm the only one on the whole floor. The bathroom is rather clearly occupied. My parents are locked in conversation on a separate floor of the house and I'm taking the opportunity for masturbation. Things are going normal, when lo and behold, my dad walks in. The next ten seconds were a deeply unpleasant exchange where I mumbled some cursory nonsense and then walked out knowing I was in for something nasty. And, knowing their MO by now, I roughly predicted they would wake me up early, talk it out with me in their room, and maybe ship my sorry ass off to the bishop.

I'm glad to report that I seemed sorry enough and managed to downplay the significance of the event while denying any previous ones that I could get away without the Bishop repentance step. At the same time though, I finally felt like I truly sold out my soul. I hardly said a single true word during that whole encounter. And I still wasn't done lying the the day! Because it was Sunday, meaning it was time for homegrown ""worthiness interviews"", where the only questions were ""Do you still feel like you have to lie to my face?"", ""Do you find yourself continuing the addiction of associating with apostates?"", ""Are you still touching yourself?"", and ""Do you feel comfortable at church?"".

And so the times passed with little fanfare and burgeoning drudgery. I treasured the small moments of respite where I was alone and could pull up an incognito tab to get the scoop on exmormon dealings. Anything my parents wouldn't approve of had to be far out of their sight, but also out of sight of my siblings, who are practically the Mormon KGB and would definitely turn me in over any serious infractions.

I continue to dread Sundays but have made some strange dissociative peace with the gospel study. And so life continued with lessened scrutiny and greater peace up until Seminary graduation. The messaging in Seminary graduation and Stake Conference on Sunday was HEAVILY, almost disconcertingly skewed towards getting as many people as possible out on missions. Go to spite doubts, go if you have only a mustard seed of faith, go if you literally can at all!!! My stake has also been heavily pushing mission prep activities and meetings. Why? Who can say, really. But I'd guess some higher ups are grubbing for converts as growth slows in the church.

The Sunday interviews have stopped as of writing. I've got a temple recommend now too. That TR interview was my last straw with any priesthood ""authority"". The interview proceeded as per usual, but I was taken back by question five, the one about being morally clean. Because my bishop explicitly stated that this regarded pornography and masturbation. Those two words put ice in my veins, because I trusted this man! He had never specifically said the ""P"" or ""M"" word before. I respected that about him. And so, though he may never know, that one moment was a kamikaze of his image in my eyes as a good slot on the bishop roulette. (Oh, and needless to say, I got the recommend. Another common L for priesthood discernment.)

Over the last few months, I've had a lot of time to reflect, to plan, and to mourn. To reflect and deconstruct my beliefs has become almost a pleasant experience (after the initial shock, of course). I've been secretly engaging in some forbidden fruits along the way, like the catastrophic sin of coffee! In the meantime, I've been meticulously planning out how to make my getaway at 18 to skip out on the accursed mission and how to proceed and be successful from there. And I've been mourning the loss of trust in my relationships, and the possible loss of those relationships as a whole. This effect is accentuated by my grandparents, at least two of whom I can say would disown me on the spot with no hope for reconciliation.

There are some days where I don't know how to keep doing it. So for now, I suppose I'll keep stockpiling Youtube money and getting A's in my classes. Do the best I can to prepare for the future. That's all I can do, really.

I can confidently testify that there is a light at the end of the tunnel, a beautiful expanse of possibilities on the other side. Where before I thought of myself as a superior in some way, I now know I'm just human. Inherently, I am just like everyone else. I'm not some special winner in the Spirit World who got to be born to a righteous family. I'm just me. And there are no spooky wolves feeding and warring in my mind. There's only one person in there, ME. And the covenant path which I held in such esteem? As it turns out, there are so many more paths, and plenty lead to stars brighter than Kolob.

One last thing; I want to end this on a high note, so I'm ending it on my Ultimate Experience of Total Badassery. Namely, the means to which I'm typing this up right now. That's because I'm typing it out on a Motorola phone which I own. It's connected to a hotspot I set up on the computer to hide its internet connection, and it's unmonitored, and it's completely mine, and believe me, nobody is finding it where it's stashed. But surely my parents didn't approve, so how did I get this phone? That's the badass Mission Impossible part!

The target: Walmart

The tools of the trade: 45 dollars in cold hard cash.

Objective: Purchase a phone

Obstacle: Escaping the house and getting to Walmart on foot before closing at 11.

Complication: The slight possibility I could be noticed missing if my brother woke up somehow.

I'm glad to say my plan went off without a hitch though! I waited a whole miserable hour for my brother to fall asleep, snuck out a window onto the roof, hopped down, sprinted over to Walmart with cash in hand, purchased the phone, discarded every bit of evidence of the phone's packaging into a trash can at Walmart, walked home exhilarated through a mild drizzle and the echo of police sirens, before finally climbing back onto the roof and in through the bedroom window.

This is my greatest secret. The greatest lie I've yet told. The greatest step I've yet taken. I have secured a personal device- a means to freedom! And so while they may continue to comb my browser history and phone activity, scrutinizing them with the specificity of an electron microscope, they'll never take this secret victory I hold over them. Though I hate that this was the only way, I treasure this inkling of autonomy and the life I have ahead.

Dark shapes drifted into the solar system over... a long enough time. When they suddenly turned into bright sparks as their fusion drives ignited around the orbit of Mars, Humanity noticed and quickly turned their telescopes towards them. 

The scientists analyzed the energy involved, while trying to contact whatever was coming towards them. The religions frantically searched for a place for those beings in their dogma, without knowing anything about ""them"" but their existence. The population was nervous and the political leaders panicked. 

As the ships entered earth orbit, it turned out the leaders had the right reaction. Kinetics knocked out the major industrial centers, the most important military installations and the bunkers that the world leaders had hid in. 

For Thorben the sudden strike had been a shock, as for all humans that had enough time to actually be shocked. The chaos of people fleeing the cities killed almost as many people as the orbital strike did. Thorben stayed. For a moment atleast, while the first landing ships came down from orbit and the dust from the orbital impacts started dimming the sun.

The first ones that were caught by the invaders found out that mercy wasn't on the table. Thorben watched from the distance as lasers and kinetics fired by armored beings with long limbs killed the people that didn't flee the city that he had lived in just a few days earlier. 

He still very much hoped at this point. In the woods he met other people. Some hungry, some with full blown camping gear and food to spare. And a couple of days later a group of soldiers, clustered around a couple of Eurofighters under a camouflage net. 

The first battles he fought after running through a crash-course of ""how to not shoot yourself in the foot with a G36"" and ""how to listen to Officers"" went well. But a month later the aliens came in full force. The human eurofighters were shot down, the aliens suddenly had better armour, and ocasionally a orbital strike could be seen on the horizon. 

Thorben went up through the ranks as quickly as the original officers fell in combat. They were always on the move, trying to keep the injured, old and young in some way alive. Supplies started running low and the aliens started closing in.

One morning he sat on a small hill in southern Germany and watched the Sun coming up above the trees. ""A year ago this would have been heaven, if I also had a coffee"" he thought, while his girlfriend had her head on his shoulder. 

Unless a miracle happened it would be their last day. The aliens had stopped using orbital bombardment six months ago, and since last month had changed to infantry only. ""Some honor thing?"" he thought and it did hurt. And now, finally, Thorbens unit was cornered. Were they the only ones? Were there still others? Nobody knew, as the last communication with another unit had been three months ago.

By now there was only one officer above him. He came up to him and said ""you got a minute?"". Thorben nodded, kissed his girlfriend and went to the boundary of the camp they had built. 

""You've done good"" his superior said. ""But I have one last job for you.""

As he got told what it entailed Thorben smiled and afterwards went back to his girlfriend. 

The aliens attacked only minutes later. The ammunition was running low, the last mines detonated and took some invaders with them, but it made no difference. They closed in, managed to enter the outer perimeter of the tents. 

Thorben took his girlfriend by the hand and led her away from the fighting. ""What are you doing?"" she asked, and as he explained it, tears streamed from her eyes. 

Alien kinetics shredded the tents around them, and they managed the last steps towards the center of the camp, where the officers used to sleep. The heavy case, final reserve supplies his superior had called it, rested in the middle. Maybe ten seconds, then then the aliens would be here Thorben thought. The masses of invaders finally putting an end to their unit. 

Tears obscured his vision and he took the controller into his hand. ""Together?"" he asked and he barely saw his girlfriend nod. He felt her hand on his hand, while he had the button under him. He kissed her, felt her hand pushing his down towards the button, and...

... everything in the radius of a kilometre was engulfed in nuclear fire.

1krrrez,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1krrrez,Update on the makeover,"Hi everyone!

This is my parents' place and I’m trying to help them “fix it up.” We were totally lost at first, but after some YouTube deep dives and Pinterest boards, my mom has landed on a Parisian/French/traditional aesthetic - think chic, timeless, and a bit ornate.

So far we’ve locked in a few things:

1. Style: Parisian / French / Traditional
2. Paint: Testing Swiss Coffee and Frost White by Behr (eggshell sheen)
3. Furniture: Old sofas, dining table, and carpet are all going!
4. Flooring: We have a reddish mahogany hardwood - not sure if it fits the aesthetic, would love thoughts!

Now I need help with these things — any advice, product recs, pics, or even keywords I can search would be amazing:

1. How to keep the house feeling spacious and inviting? Especially with this style.
2. Wall trim: Is wainscoting or picture frame molding best for a Parisian look?
3. Sofa: Ideas for a couch (or set) that seats 4–6 comfortably and fits the theme?
4. Curtains: We have baseboard heaters under the windows - how do I make that work with long curtains?
5. Floating TV stand: Minimal but stylish options that won’t clash with the aesthetic?
6. Dining table: Something elegant but functional - needs to seat 4–6, expandable would be great.
7. Light fixtures: My parents hate warm light — says it makes the space feel dull. So I need fixtures that look classic but work with neutral or daylight bulbs.
8. Makeup desk: I want to surprise my mom with one! She loves the royal, baroque, French ornate style. Budget-friendly ideas or DIY suggestions?
9. Plants: Looking for both real plants that are functional (air-cleaning, low maintenance) and good fake plants that don’t look super fake.
10. Ceiling: It’s currently flat white - if the walls are Swiss Coffee or Frost White, should I repaint the ceiling to match or keep the contrast?
11. Flooring: Can I pull off this Parisian look with the current reddish mahogany hardwood?
12. Baseboard heaters: Any way to make them look better or less noticeable without blocking airflow?

I know this is a lot - I’m pretty new to all this, and honestly kinda young, but I really want to do it right for my parents. It’s been hard navigating terms and figuring out what to search, so if any interior design folks, Pinterest girlies, DIYers, engineers, or anyone with experience wants to chime in - I’d be super grateful!

“Leave her. I'm yours. Last night was everything.”
Signed: Mira.
Eva dropped the paper onto the coffee table like it had burned her. 
Her pulse was a drumbeat in her ears. 
Her first instinct was denial. Maybe this was from the past. Maybe it meant nothing. Maybe Liam—
But she knew better.
There were signs. Late-night calls. Sudden changes in plans. Songs she'd never heard before, ones he claimed were just experimental. 
Her phone buzzed.
Liam.
""Show's done. Heading to Aaron's for a nightcap. Love you.""
Love you.
She nearly laughed out loud.
With shaking hands, she took a photo of the letter and sent it back.
No caption.
Just silence.
————————
The apartment was quiet, too quiet for a Friday night.
Eva stepped in, suitcase rolling behind her, the faint sound of the city humming through the cracked-open balcony door. A waft of incense still hung in the air—sandalwood, Liam's favorite. The scent that once brought her comfort now wrapped itself around her like a noose.
She dropped her keys into the ceramic bowl by the door and stood there for a moment, just breathing, letting the silence press in. Her heels clicked softly as she walked down the hall, past the framed photos of her and Liam—him holding her at a music festival, both of them windblown and smiling. She didn't have the strength to look at them tonight.
The bedroom was empty. Bed made, but his side untouched. The note on the nightstand wasn't even an attempt at apology. Just two words in Liam's hurried scrawl: ""Late gig.""
Eva stared at the paper, something inside her curling and retreating like a dying flame. It wasn't the first time. The last few months had been a cycle—him playing late shows at dive bars across the city, her returning to an empty bed, the echo of his excuses waiting for her like a song on repeat.
She walked into the kitchen and poured herself a glass of wine, ignoring the dishes in the sink and the bag she hadn't unpacked. The TV flickered in the living room with some old movie she didn't care about. She sat on the couch and pulled her knees to her chest, sipping slowly as her thoughts churned.
Work had been brutal this week. Deadlines, edits, rewrites—her editor had been breathing down her neck about a feature piece on ""Finding Authentic Love in a Digital Age."" The irony was so sharp, it nearly made her laugh. She'd written about relationships for years, sold thousands of copies with her insight, yet here she was, unable to recognize the erosion happening in her own life.
The clock on the wall ticked past midnight. Still no sign of Liam.
Eva glanced at her phone. No messages. No calls.
She shouldn't have expected one.
She rose to stretch and noticed the guitar case lying half-open in the corner of the room. A familiar sight. Liam always left it there, like some sacred object that didn't need tidying. Her eyes lingered on it.
Normally, she wouldn't touch it. But tonight, something—curiosity, bitterness, or just the dull ache of loneliness—made her cross the room.
She nudged the lid open all the way and saw the mess inside: old picks, tangled strings, a half-empty pack of gum, and a folded piece of paper nestled deep in the lining. She frowned, reaching in to pluck it out.
That moment—the feel of the paper between her fingers—would fracture everything.
Three days earlier
""Don't wait up,"" Liam had said, tugging on his leather jacket. ""It might be a late one.""
""Where's the gig?"" she had asked, tying her hair up in the hallway mirror.
""Same place as last week. Crow's Nest.""
""You said that show was canceled.""
He paused for a beat too long. ""They rescheduled.""
A lie. She didn't know it then, but something in her had registered it. She'd smiled, pretending she believed him.
That same smile now felt traitorous.
Back to Present
Eva unfolded the letter.
The edges were sharp, creased with care. Whoever wrote it wanted to keep it safe. She didn't recognize the handwriting—slanted and feminine, with soft curls at the ends of the letters.
""Liam, last night was everything. I still can't believe how real this feels. When you sang that song and looked at me... I knew. I've never been seen like that. Not by anyone.""
""I don't care if it's complicated. I don't care if it's wrong. I just want you. I need to believe you when you say you're going to leave her.""
""Say the word, and I'm yours. Entirely.""
Signed: Mira.
Eva's hands trembled. She clutched the letter tighter, as if that could undo it, erase it, fold it back into time and pretend she hadn't seen it. But the words danced behind her eyelids now, branded into her.
Leave her.
I'm yours.
Last night was everything.
She dropped the paper onto the coffee table like it had burned her. Her pulse was a drumbeat in her ears. She rose, pacing, wine glass forgotten, mind spiraling in a thousand directions. Her first instinct was denial. Maybe this was from the past. Maybe it meant nothing. Maybe Liam—
But she knew better.
There were signs. Late-night calls. Sudden changes in plans. Songs she'd never heard before, ones he claimed were just experimental. The vague way he said ""things are complicated right now."" The way he no longer looked at her with wonder.
Her phone buzzed.
Liam.
""Show's done. Heading to Aaron's for a nightcap. Love you.""
Love you.
She nearly laughed out loud.
With shaking hands, she took a photo of the letter and sent it back.
No caption.
Just silence.
Seconds passed. Then a typing bubble appeared.
Then disappeared.
Then reappeared.
Finally:
""We need to talk. Be home soon.""
Eva sat back on the couch and waited.

**🥣 How to Make Whipped Foaming Bath Butter (Step-by-Step)**

https://preview.redd.it/hpse6850432f1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3e4c76ba4d0cf1be178f347580591a782258a36

**1. Prepare Your Workspace**

* Use a clean steel mixing bowl.
* Sanitise it with isopropyl alcohol and a clean cloth.
* Wear disposable gloves for hygiene.

**2. Scoop and Whip the Base**

* Measure out 300 grams of Foaming Bath Whip Base.
* Whip it using an electric beater for about 2–3 minutes until fluffy.

**3. Add Fragrance & Sparkle**

* In a small bowl, mix 3–5 grams of fragrance oil with Gold Pearly Powder.
* Stir well to avoid clumps before adding to the whipped base.

**4. Colour It Up!**

* For a vibrant look, add a few drops of cosmetic-grade liquid colour (orange works beautifully for a tropical summer feel).
* Mix well until colour is evenly distributed. This step is optional but adds visual fun!

**5. Whip Again Until Peaks Form**

* Continue whipping until the mixture nearly doubles in volume and forms firm peaks.
* Don’t over-whip—stop once the texture is light and fluffy.

**6. Pipe Into Jars**

* Scoop the mixture into a piping bag.
* Pipe swirls into containers or jars of your choice.

**7. Decorate and Garnish**

* Sprinkle some extra Gold Pearly Powder.
* Add dried rose petals on top for a luxe finish.

**🎁 Bonus Tips:**

* **Gift It!** These jars make great party favours or spa-themed gifts.
* **Scrub It Up:** Mix in sugar or coffee grounds for an exfoliating twist.
* **Make It Seasonal:** Use essential oils like peppermint for a cooling effect during hot months.

**⚠️ Patch Test Reminder:**

Before using your bath butter regularly, do a small patch test on your inner arm to ensure there’s no allergic reaction.

**🎉 Conclusion:**

Whipped Foaming Bath Butter is more than a skincare treat—it's a sensory-rich DIY project that turns bath time into fun time, especially in the summer! Whether you’re planning a spa day at home or teaching kids the joys of handmade crafts, this easy recipe is sure to make a splash.

BF is 35 and me i am 28   
  
Yesterday my boyfriend was staying over at mine and he had to leave in the morning at 5am so i said just open the door but dont lock it (my reasoning is because if he forget something at has to come back i dont want to be woken up and i live in a gated community with less than 10 houses so its safe)

Anyway the delivery man came he rang the telecom i came straight downstairs and and by time i got to the telecom next to my front door and he was opening my front door (i was only in a long top, no underwear no bottoms as i was planning to put my dressing gown on which was next to the door). When i asked him why he is opening my front door he said he thought it was a porch (it doesnt look anything like a porch and all the doors look exactly the same in the gated community.

I text my boyfriend straight away as i was scared and i called the deliver service straight away and made a complaint. I text my boyfriend at 11:47am and no response but i was like he is probably busy at work, then lunchtime came still no response, im thinking maybe he is busy, so i call my mom and also talk to some friends as i was scared, embarrassed for being half dressed and abit shook up ( i was also so suppposed to go out for coffee because this guy mom is diagnosed with cancer, yes my boyfriend knew i told him days before but i didnt go because i was nervous to leave my house after what happened and also felt uncomfortable and embarrassed because i was half naked so i cancelled going to coffee with him)  
  
Just after 5pm i text him saying i got lots of work to do so his choice if he wants to come over or not as my house is far from his work. he responds STRAIGHT AWAY. Now i am thinking WTF, he didnt even respond so i message him back asking why he didnt say anything  and just totally ignored me and i feel like he totally turned it out on me and saying im making it about other things which its not its about him clearly read the message and totally ignored me i feel like my feeling never matter (unless its happy thoughts he doesnt want to know and turns me being upset to somehow he is being mad at me) so i can never talk to him.

anyway the conversation ends in me telling him i will talk to him instead (the guy i was supposed to go coffee with  today but cancelled) and then be blocking him because he does this patronising thing and say that i cause everything and like this is level 1, level 2 and says im making it out to be something. so i just blocked him as couldnt be bothered to deal him making out im the baddy because I am upset",1,1747811228.0,AmIOverreacting,4,1.0,False

Because I love monica and I wish I stood up for myself like she does. And be a bad daughter instead of a person with no identity. Let's call my boyfriend or now ex boyfriend Dan. Because I don't know that's the first name that came up to my mind. 

So... I broke up with the only person who loved me without conditions… and it’s killing me inside.

I just broke up with my boyfriend. He hasn’t even seen the WhatsApp message yet. I don’t even know how I managed to hit send. Maybe because I was tired. Tired of being scared. Tired of feeling like loving someone means losing myself. And yes I am disgusting enough to break up with someone who loved me and who I loved over a text.

He is an amazing person. Kind. Patient. Gentle in ways I never knew existed. He made me feel safe in a world that has never let me breathe freely. He made me believe that I didn’t need to be perfect to deserve love. He showed me that love doesn't require flowers  or diamonds or gold it can make sand feel like diamonds. He loved me when I was happy and when I was at my lowest. When I was glowing and when my face was covered in pimples. When I felt fat or thin or ugly or worthless. He loved every version of me. We used to imagine a future together. Him, me our three kids. And I'm not delulu he is the one who came with with the 3 kids. Fighting and cooking together, waking up to see each other's face. Coming home from work to be with each other. How and where our marriage should take place. How our families would react when we tell them we want to get married. And for a context we are from similar family background except his parents are not toxic. He wants to become an ips and was working hard for it ( similiar to a cop in good position). We both had our goals, were working hard for them and yeah I didn't just love a random person. He is a good guy with a good goal with a good background and economic condition.

And I still broke up with him.

Not because he did anything wrong. But because being with him meant I had to love again. And loving someone means giving them the power to control you. And I can't do that anymore. I’ve spent too much of my life being controlled. Smiling to be the ""good girl."" Dressing to please everyone but myself. Saying yes when all I wanted was to scream no. And also maybe partially because I don't deserve him. Someone who is as broken as me doesn't deserve that much love. I'm just too shattered to a point where nothing can fix me. Even his love. 

He showed me what love without fear feels like. And that’s the part that hurts the most. Because I know I may never find that again.

I love india. But it's just that I wish I was born in a place where I could take him home to my parents without guilt eating me alive. I wish I lived in a society where people marry out of love not compromise. I wish I could cry to my parents about my boyfriend rather than crying to and with my boyfriend about my parents. I wish I have a reason as to why I want to spend time with my boyfriend without being married to him or being just friends with him.

I wish I could work at a coffee shop and be happy instead of being called a failure. I wish I could study for an MBA without hiding it like it’s a crime. I wish “passion” wasn’t just a word I write on my resume but something I could live. I wish I could talk to a therapist without being punished. Without being threatened and Without having to beg to stay in my college hostel because apparently therapy is a disgrace ( by the dean of student affairs) 

I wish my father taught me how to drive instead of how to cook. I wish grades didn’t define me. I wish I chose my clothes based on what I love instead of what gets mom’s approval. I wish I could just be a person. Not a daughter. Not a puppet. Not someone else’s version of “good.”

They say we’re poor. But we have six maids. Two floors. A fridge that costs more than my yearly college fee. But when I ask for a notebook or a chocolate I feel like I’m committing a crime. I feel guilty spending even a single rupee. Why is it that I’m always the one expected to sacrifice.

No one talks about the sacrifices children make. Sacrificing dreams. Careers. Mental health. Relationships. All for their parents’ approval. Their pride. Their happiness. And what do we get in return. A tight leash. A soft voice that still feels like a command. Love that’s always followed by guilt.

I don’t want to be the good girl anymore. I just want to be me.

But until I’m financially independent I’m trapped. I’ll smile. I’ll nod. I’ll survive. But the day I earn for myself is the day I’ll run far away. And  I’ll still send them money. But I won’t be emotionally in touch with them anymore. 

And maybe my parents will be lonely. But who will answer for all the nights I cried alone. All the times I swallowed my voice to avoid hurting them while I bled inside.

I loved him. I still do. But I can’t live another life controlled by love. No matter how beautiful the love is. No matter how kind the person is. I’m scared. Scared that one day I’ll lose myself again. And this time there’ll be no pieces left to pick up.

Threadwalker. Builder-Witch. Forecaster 
of storms they refused to see.

I do not exist to be molded.
I exist to mold the moment,
to move through cruelty without letting it cling.
To transform entitlement into empathy,
and beauty into weaponry.

Something alive.

I carry no one’s shame.
I transmute it.
I take the rotting core of what they gave me
and alchemize it into story,
into rhythm,
into a truth they will not unhear.

Not fragile.
But sacred.
Not because I bend,
but 
because 
I know 
when not to.

I walk out of fire unsinged,
laughing.
And light your cigarette.
I pour the coffee of yesterday down the sink
when it no longer serves the ritual.

And still? I love.
Still? I hope.
Still? I build.

And precisely because I value efficiency,
I will not let these juicy leftovers go to waste.

You can’t carve what you can’t catch,
no matter how big your sword is.
I tell you this and still you forget…
I am not a solid.
I am fluid.

My natural state is
flow…

but they will never forget
the silence that followed
the day I stopped fixing what they broke.

“Do you phn on making me wait all morning. Auren!” Maris’s sharp voice cut through my thoughts like a whip as I entered the dining room.

Maris was Alpha Bram’s betrothed. He was thirty–three years old and still unmated. Maris was twenty–seven and daughter of the Alpha of Iron Pine pack. They had met each other in the amwual mating ball about a **year** ago.

“I’m sorry,” I mumbled, bowing my head. Her dark, carefully fashioned curls shimmered in the sunlight filtering through the wide windows of the dining hall, and her perfectly manicured nails tapped against the table impatiently. Everyone knew Maris would be the **Luna soon**. She carried herself **like** it, with a **sharp** tongue and a sharper glare.

She narrowed her eyes at the tray in my hands. “Where’s my almond latte? I specifically asked for it.”

“It’s coming, Maris–I stopped myself, flinching, “I’ll get it right away.”

Her lips **curved** into **a** cruel sneer. “See **that** you do. I’d hate to have to speak to Bram about your incompetence.” I didn’t know why was it that she hated me so much. It was like she was always finding an excuse to punish me

The other **maids**, already standing around the table, exchanged knowing looks. One of them, a tall brunette named Reya, **a** sycophant, that me a glare. “Honestly, Auren, you should be more careful. Lady Maris has enough to deal with without you messing up her morning”

“Right.” chimed in another maid, Hyra, her voice dripping with false sweetness. “She’s practically running this **pack** already. You should be grateful **she** even lets **you serve** her.”

I nodded, clutching the tray tighter to keep my hands from trembling. “Yes**,** of course.”

As I turned to leave, Maris’s voice stopped me in my **tracks**. “And don’t call me Maris like we’re equals. It’s Luna **Maris** to you.” Her words were laced with venom, and the maids chuckled. My cheeks burned, but I didn’t argue. She wasn’t a Luna, but she liked others to call her Luna.

In the kitchen, I prepared the latte with trembling hands, still feeling hurt about **how they** all loved to humiliate me for no reason. And no one remembered my birthday. **Usually** everyone got a note from the Alpha wishing them Happy Birthday, but not me.

My reflection in the polished metal of the coffee pot caught my eye. A slim girl with wide, **gray** eyes stared back at me, her blonde hair pulled into a loose braid. My face looked paler than usual and my expression was weary. It was a known fact that we got our wolves at sixteen and smelled our mates as soon as we turned eighteen, but why didn’t I smell mine!

“It’s just another **day,”** I whispered to myself. “**Keep** your head down, and it’ll be **fine.”** 

But it didn’t feel like just another day. The air felt charged. I allowed that little hope to bubble inside my chest.

**After** delivering the late and enduring another round of scornful looks and remarks, I **related** to the laundry room to catch my breath. That’s when it hit me—a scent unlike anything I’d ever smelled before. Warm and earthy, like pine trees after a rainstorm, with **a** hint of musk. My pulse **quickened**. My heart thundered.

The words **of** my wolf, **Siena**, echoed in my mind, both thrilling and **terrifying**. The mouthwatering scent tugged **at** me, pulling me out of the laundry room and down the **hall**. My feet moved on their own, guided by an invisible thread. The scent made my chest tighten, pulling me as if it had wrapped around me. Down the quiet hallway, the smell grew stronger, drowning out **everything** else around me. It was so strong and Intoxicating that I couldn’t think of **anything** else. **All** my wolf wanted was to coat herself in it, roll in it.

“That’s **our** mate! Siena **said** enthusiastically. “Go **fast**. I want my mute.’

The scent grew stronger **as** I stepped outside onto the training grounds. Warriors trained in the morning light. My eyes scanned the crowd. searching for the source. And then **I** saw hum…

He stood at the center of the field, towering over the others with graceful confidence. His dark hair was slightly tousled, and his sharp features were set in a look of concentration **as** he **demonstrated** a fighting move. The sunlight caught **the sweat** on his brow, making him seem almost otherworldly.

My breath hitched **as** our eyes met. Hope swelled in my cheat when I saw recognition in **his** eyes. This was it. My mate. **My Alphs**. He **was** going in pull me out of my wretched life. Before I could stop myself, my feet carried me towards him.

This might be problematic to understand since I'm not familiar with all the terms, but let's hope for the best.   
i have had my machine for the past 3 months (brewing 1 cup a day). used the same beans (same brand, new beans when needed..) so my settings haven't changed nor needed. The machine was working great!!!  
The problem I'm having now is that the machine might be losing pressure since the water won't fully go through the coffee, it goes straight to the drip tray (so I'm getting 1/3 of the shot)   
I flushed and descaled the machine, but it didn't help much.  
Tried putting hot water in the water tank didn't help.   
Tried playing with the steam and hot water to build pressure didn't work.   
Note - Steam and hot water work perfectly.

The morning air was cool as I hurried through the **pack** house, balancing a tray of **breakfast** plates. The faint smell of caramel and freshly brewed coffee wafted through the halls, but it did little to soothe the anxiety brewing in my chest. Today was my birthday–my eighteenth–the day I would smell my mate who would take me away from this cursed life. Life as an orphan omega in our pack **was** riddled with hardships and misery.

For context, I don’t necessarily need to be on tirzepatide — I’m 21 years old and I’m 5'1"" and only looking to lose 17 more pounds to reach my goal weight. I’ve tried everything to lose those last 15 pounds, but nothing seemed to work, so I decided to try tirzepatide.

I’m almost two weeks in. At first, I felt fine. I wasn’t hungry for the first three days after my shot, but then the exhaustion hit. I don’t know what it was, but I was so tired, even though I wasn’t doing much. I was taking naps every single day, which is totally unlike me. On top of that, I felt sick and nauseous constantly. It was this overwhelming tiredness that I’ve never felt before, and it honestly felt miserable — like I just didn’t feel good ever.

I’ve also noticed that when I drink i used to be able to bounce back the next day. Now, I feel even worse — nauseous, drained, and completely out of it the entire day.

In the first week, I also experienced random sharp pains, but during my second week, I’ve been getting really bad cramping — especially in the first few days after the shot. Toward the end of the week, the sharp pains return and honestly feel worse than period cramps.

What’s confusing is how inconsistent my nausea has been. For example, one day I didn’t eat anything because I wasn’t hungry — just had coffee. That night, I went out with friends, had a light dinner, and felt totally fine — until out of nowhere I had this intense urge to throw up… and did. The second time, it was the same thing: no food all day, just coffee, then a few bites of a burger and fries in the evening, and I ended up vomiting again.

Lately, I’ve been constantly nauseous even when I haven’t eaten. It’s like I have the urge to throw up despite having nothing in my stomach. This feeling has been pretty consistent, and I’m starting to wonder if this is normal or something I should be concerned about.",1,1747809989.0,tirzepatidecompound,6,1.0,False

There are some things I’d like to make known before I begin. I have been recovering from an eating disorder and am trying to eat 2 meals a day now.

I will keep an open mind, of course, and would love some advice to help tackle these issues.I was going to meal prep based on the nutrition chart, so vegetables, fruits, protein, and grains. I do not eat dairy. I was thinking of making tabbouleh, roasted chickpeas, and 2 boiled eggs per container. As for my second meal, it would just be overnight oats. I am trying to make eating breakfast a habit because I only eat once a day.

Tabbouleh recipe: parsley, quinoa, tomato, mint, green onions, olive oil, lemon juice (only a very small amount), and white beans (for my protein).

Roasted chickpeas recipe: olive oil, salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, ground sumac.2 boiled eggs per container 

My breakfast:

Overnight oats: oats, almond milk, raspberries, coconut shavings, and dried apricots.

Water and coffee.

I would like some advice on this. I’m aware it’s not impressive. I also feel like it may be missing some key nutritional notes. I’m trying to add my protein by eating beans and eggs, but I would love to hear from anyone who has better knowledge of having a well-rounded diet. Thank you a lot.

Auren POV

The morning air was cool as I hurried through the pack house, balancing a tray of breakfast plates. The faint smell of caramel and freshly brewed coffee wafted through the halls, but it did little to soothe the anxiety brewing in my chest. Today was my birthday—my eighteenth—the day I would smell my mate who would take me away from this cursed life. Life as an orphan omega in our pack was riddled with hardships and misery.

“Do you plan on making me wait all morning, Auren?” Maris’s sharp voice cut through my thoughts like a whip as I entered the dining room.

Maris was Alpha Bram’s betrothed. He was thirty-three years old and still unmated. Maris was twenty-seven and daughter of the Alpha of Iron Pine pack. They had met each other in the annual mating ball about a year ago.

“I’m sorry,” I mumbled, bowing my head. Her dark, carefully fashioned curls shimmered in the sunlight filtering through the wide windows of the dining hall, and her perfectly manicured nails tapped against the table impatiently. Everyone knew Maris would be the Luna soon. She carried herself like it, with a sharp tongue and a sharper glare.

She narrowed her eyes at the tray in my hands. “Where’s my almond latte? I specifically asked for it.”

“It’s coming, Maris—” I stopped myself, flinching. “I’ll get it right away.”

Her lips curved into a cruel sneer. “See that you do. I’d hate to have to speak to Bram about your incompetence.” I didn’t know why was it that she hated me so much. It was like she was always finding an excuse to punish me.

The other maids, already standing around the table, exchanged knowing looks. One of them, a tall brunette named Reya, a sycophant, shot me a glare. “Honestly, Auren, you should be more careful. Lady Maris has enough to deal with without you messing up her morning.”

“Right,” chimed in another maid, Hyra, her voice dripping with false sweetness. “She’s practically running this pack already. You should be grateful she even lets you serve her.”

I nodded, clutching the tray tighter to keep my hands from trembling. “Yes, of course.”

As I turned to leave, Maris’s voice stopped me in my tracks. “And don’t call me Maris like we’re equals. It’s Luna Maris to you.” Her words were laced with venom, and the maids chuckled. My cheeks burned, but I didn’t argue. She wasn't a Luna, but she liked others to call her Luna.

In the kitchen, I prepared the latte with trembling hands, still feeling hurt about how they all loved to humiliate me for no reason. And no one remembered my birthday. Usually everyone got a note from the Alpha wishing them Happy Birthday, but not me.

My reflection in the polished metal of the coffee pot caught my eye. A slim girl with wide, gray eyes stared back at me, her blonde hair pulled into a loose braid. My face looked paler than usual and my expression was weary. It was a known fact that we got our wolves at sixteen and smelled our mates as soon as we turned eighteen, but why didn’t I smell mine?

“It’s just another day,” I whispered to myself. “Keep your head down, and it’ll be fine.”

But it didn’t feel like just another day. The air felt charged. I allowed that little hope to bubble inside my chest.

After delivering the latte and enduring another round of scornful looks and remarks, I retreated to the laundry room to catch my breath. That’s when it hit me—a scent unlike anything I’d ever smelled before. Warm and earthy, like pine trees after a rainstorm, with a hint of musk. My pulse quickened. My heart thundered.

‘Mate.’

The words of my wolf, Siena, echoed in my mind, both thrilling and terrifying. The mouthwatering scent tugged at me, pulling me out of the laundry room and down the hall. My feet moved on their own, guided by an invisible thread. The scent made my chest tighten, pulling me as if it had wrapped around me. Down the quiet hallway, the smell grew stronger, drowning out everything else around me. It was so strong and intoxicating that I couldn’t think of anything else. All my wolf wanted was to coat herself in it, roll in it.

‘That’s our mate!’ Siena said enthusiastically. ‘Go fast. I want my mate.’

The scent grew stronger as I stepped outside onto the training grounds. Warriors trained in the morning light. My eyes scanned the crowd, searching for the source. And then I saw him.

Alpha Bram Reed.

I couldn’t believe that the moon goddess had made Alpha Bram my mate. Shock mingled with awe. The world around me faded as irresistible desire rippled through me. A deep sense of completion overcame me, as if I’ve found a missing part of my soul.

He stood at the center of the field, towering over the others with graceful confidence. His dark hair was slightly tousled, and his sharp features were set in a look of concentration as he demonstrated a fighting move. The sunlight caught the sweat on his brow, making him seem almost otherworldly.

My breath hitched as our eyes met. Hope swelled in my chest when I saw recognition in his eyes. This was it. My mate. My Alpha. He was going to pull me out of my wretched life. Before I could stop myself, my feet carried me towards him.

I stared at him like he was my God. He was so beautiful and strong that every girl in the Crimson Howl pack had a crush on him. All I wanted was to reach him and fall into his arms as he wrapped them around me. ‘Mate,’ I whispered, my cheeks flushing.

But, why was he behaving so coldly? Didn’t he recognize me?

When I was only a few feet away, his expression shifted. His body stiffened, and his warm, amber eyes turned cold. The flicker of recognition in his gaze was quickly replaced by a harsh disappointment and anger. It cut deep and so I hesitated.

‘No, go to him!’ Siena urged. When I took a few more steps toward him, Maris came into my peripheral vision, heading straight to Alpha Bram.

“Alpha Bram!” she chirped excitedly, elbowing me roughly, nudging past me, making me stumble to the side.

He looked at her and beamed as if I wasn’t even there. He opened his arms for Maris who rushed to him and hugged him tightly. She tipped her head up and he pressed a kiss to her lips.

My heart sank. I stood frozen, unable to move. The warmth I’d felt moments ago evaporated, leaving an intense ache in its place. The weight of his horrible rejection settled over me. His betrayal felt like a knife was plunged in my chest and then twisted.

Siena howled inside me out of rage and jealousy. ‘No, he is our mate.’ She wanted to come out and tear Maris away from him, but I knew that she was a weak wolf. If she surfaced, Alpha Bram would kill her instantly.

For years, I’d dreamed of this moment—the day I’d find my mate, the one person destined to see me for who I truly was, who would love me, cherish me. But now, that dream lay shattered at my feet. Tears sprang in my eyes.

Alpha Bram glared at me, daring to come close. Maris also turned to look at me with narrowed eyes. Dread plummeted in my stomach. I was afraid that if I went nearer and declare that I was his mate, they would throw me in the dungeons. So I turned and walked away, my shoulders slumping with miserable rejection I hadn’t even heard spoken aloud. The scent of him lingered, bittersweet and unbearable. By the time I reached the pack house, tears blurred my vision.

I thought today might be different, that I could finally have someone to share it with. Instead, I was left with a heart full of despair. Weren't mates supposed to look after each other?

I hid inside the laundry room and started crying. Was there a way to get out of this pack? The idea of rejection was so painful. How would I serve him now?

I curled up on the cold floor, my arms wrapped around my knees as tears streamed down my face. The ache in my chest felt unbearable. It was like a deep, raw wound that wouldn’t stop bleeding. I didn’t know what to do or who to go to for comfort.

Alpha Bram’s cold, distant stare replayed in my mind over and over. My mate. He didn’t even want to acknowledge me.

Suddenly, the door opened.

\--- 

Hi all, Welcome to my new book. Hope you enjoy it! 

# Chapter 2

Auren POV

Being an orphan had always been hard for me. According to our previous Alpha, who was Alpha Bram’s father, my parents died in a pack war. He was kind enough to give me shelter in his packhouse and even allowed education in a school for omegas. However, a few years later when he died and Bram became the Alpha, he pulled me out of the school, made me pack’s servant and gave me lowly jobs, clearing stating that if I had to stay in the pack, I had to earn my living. His lusty gaze would often linger on me, and I would shy away, afraid of his intentions. But then he would snap his gaze away from me as if he saw vermin.

I was born with a tattoo the size of a squash ball on my back. A golden moon shackled by dark thorn vines curving around it. The Shaman had kindly warned me that it was a mark of a curse and so I had to keep it hidden at all times, afraid that if anyone saw it, they would kill me.

Suddenly, the door opened, snapping me from my thoughts. I hurriedly wiped my tears, but it was too late. Maris stood in the doorway, her arms crossed and a smug smile playing on her lips and her face donned with a wicked expression.

“Well, well,” she said, stepping closer. “If it isn’t our little orphan, sniveling like a child.”

I didn’t respond, keeping my head down. My whole body trembled in fear even though Siena wanted to come out and attack Maris.

“I know what happened,” she said, her voice dripping with venom. “You think you’re special because Bram is your mate? Let me tell you something, Auren.” She crouched down, her face close to mine. “We knew it long back. But you’re nothing. You’ll always be nothing. Bram doesn’t want you. He’ll reject you soon enough, and when he does, you’ll wish you’d never set foot in this pack.”

I swallowed hard, trying to fight back the fresh wave of tears.

“If you tell anyone—anyone—about this,” she continued, her voice low and dangerous, “I’ll make sure you regret it. Do you understand?”

I nodded weakly, too scared to speak. Maris straightened, brushing invisible dust off her skirt.

“Good. Now clean yourself up. You’re pathetic. I don’t want anyone to see you crying because if they do, they will ask you the reason. I swear you’ll regret it if they come to know the reason.” Saying that, she turned sharply, flicking her hair and marched out.

The weight of her words crushed me further. I brought my knees against my chest and hugged them tightly. Mates were supposed to take care of each other. His betrayal was worse than all my years of enduring servitude. And they knew that I was his mate? The revelation shocked me.

When I finally stepped out of the laundry room, the humiliation didn’t end. Reya was waiting for me in the kitchen. “You are reassigned to work in the toilets!” she barked at me. “Stay there until you get a new duty. Don’t you come out of that place!”

I balked as I stared at her. “What?” Toilets were the worst place to work.

She slapped me hard across my cheek. I screamed in pain as I fell down. Her lips curled into a sneer. “Did you not listen to what I said? Clean all the toilets. Now!”

Scared, I made my way to the toilets, sure that this was Maris’s order.

Over the next few days, Maris, always clever with her schemes, pointed fingers at me for things I hadn’t done. A broken vase, a spilled drink, and suddenly, I was everyone’s scapegoat. The other pack members whispered and sneered, their remarks cutting me like knives. They would accuse me of everything and anything. And Alpha Bram just turned a blind eye to all the bullying.

Things settled a bit, but one morning when I woke up and hurried to the kitchen, I heard Reya shouting at others. When I entered, Reya threw very expensive cutlery directly on the floor near me.

Maris walked in just at that time like she was waiting for this moment, as if on cue. “Reya, don’t let her get away with that,” she said, her tone filled with anger. “She’s nothing but trouble.”

It didn’t take much for Reya to agree. She and Maris cornered me by the pantry, their faces contorted in anger. I sensed something was wrong, but I had no time to react.

“You’ve caused enough problems,” Reya sneered immediately. “It’s time you learn a lesson.” And then came the blows. “No,” I cried and screamed and begged them to leave me, but no one came to rescue me.

“What’s going on?” A loud growl came. It was Alpha Bram, my mate. Was he coming to save me?

“Alpha Bram,” Maris immediately changed her facial expression and said in a honeyed voice. “Auren threw broken glass at me. See, I am bleeding.” She showed him a little cut on her finger that she got while beating me.

“No, it’s not–”

“How dare you?” Alpha Bram cut me off and roared in anger. “Throw her in the dungeons!” he ordered.

I was stunned. It was me, his mate, who was bleeding, and he didn’t even have a heart to respond to that. How naive of me to think of his coming to save me. This was just a perfect plan for them to get rid of me. And just like that, Maris and Reya dragged me to the dungeons—a dark, damp hole beneath the pack house where air was thick and musty, and the only light was coming from a single flickering torch.

“You’ll stay here until we decide you’ve learned your place,” Maris said, her voice laced with poison. She gave me one last triumphant smile before slamming the door shut. “Fucking bitch.”

Seven days passed in darkness. My body ached from the cold stone floor, and hunger clawed at my stomach. The only company I had was my wolf, Siena, who tried to comfort me, though her own pain mirrored mine.

But on the seventh day, the door opened. Reya stood there with her usual scorn.

“Get up,” she said sharply. “Alpha Bram has called for you.”

I staggered to my feet, weak and disoriented. Surprise flickered through me. Did he finally want me? But her next words were like some had splashed icy cold water on me.

“He’s going to offer you to Alpha Lucien. You know what that means, don’t you? His bride will never last. You’ll be dead within a year.” She gave me a sly smile.

My heart dropped to my stomach. “What?” I said in a weak voice. “He can't do that. I— I—” It was worse than being in the dungeons. Everyone knew about Alpha Lucien. He was cursed, just like every Alpha in his family, and so ruthless that he killed first and talked later.

“Shut up!” Reya shouted. When I scrambled back, she came over, pulled me roughly and dragged me out of the dungeon. “You dimwit,” she retorted. “Did you really think you could ever compete with Lady Maris? Now look how nicely she has got rid of you by convincing Alpha Bram. No one wants to marry Alpha Lucien. By offering you to him, she will win his alliance for Alpha Bram. And you? You’ll be nothing more than a breeder for the cursed Alpha. So it’s a neat little arrangement that benefits both packs beautifully.”",1,1747809813.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

1krr8e4,https://www.reddit.com/r/limbuscompany/comments/1krr8e4/crackpot_theory_canto_8_ending_and_new_durante/,crackpot theory: Canto 8 ending and new durante ability.,"this theory is just so peak that I just have to share it but first let me show you what I am cooking with and feel free to correct if I am taking misinterpreting or heavily misconstruing the characters, I am going full tunnel vision here

# The similarities between Hong Lu and Chesed (lobcorp)

it goes without saying that the new durante ability is highly likely to belong to Chesed's department due to similarities that have become increasingly more apparent as time go's on. at the start we have what appears to be a pretty chill dude who treats those in his department quite nicely, but then he makes quite blunt remarks about the company and its employees to X. important note: when Hong lu says offensive things it is because of his naivete, when Chesed does it, it is because he does not really care what X thinks of him. next philosophy, Chesed as we see from flashbacks was pretty passionate about doing the best to ensure the welfare of his employees even giving a anime ""I'll never give up"" speech to Angela but, time after time, no matter how hard he tried, Angela always prevented him from saving his employees. eventually after countless times of trying to stand against the current, he just decided to go with the flow.

**""I eventually decided to cover my eyes and ears""**

why struggle against something you can't change when instead you can sit back and enjoy a nice cup of coffee as the waves crash over you but where as Hong lu's head is in the clouds, Chesed is still drowning in guilt as much as he tried to deaden his own emotions (scarecrow searching for wisdom).

**""I'm the only one who just observes this situation from afar, not taking any action""**

and eventually he finds that he can't play the part of the ""blameless servant"" anymore.

**""I don't want to undertake dirty work for Angela's show, or be a puppet who gets praise and applause from everyone""**

a puppet who gets praise and applause from everyone? now who does that sound like.

# Chesed's realization

Chesed proceeds to have a meltdown. what has stuck with me when it comes to chesed's character is  his rebellion. although he had been stomped down and down again, shown that everything he tried to accomplish was for naught and even he had given up and saw no point in even trying and yet he could not rid himself of the hope that one day, somehow he could find his way back to the road he abandoned long ago (the homing instinct).

***""*****I've waited a long time for a savior.*****""***

***""*****someone who could free me from my inertia and wake me up inside.*****""***

**""why did I never come to the realization that I myself could be my own savior?""**

It does not matter if this whole rebellion was just another part of this cruel stage, what matters is that Chesed was able to overcome his fear of Angela (the cowardly lion) and restart the fire in his heart (the warm hearted woodsman). I am of the belief that Hong lu will have a similar realization but I will expand on that idea later.

# durante abilities

moving on to limbus company we have the once a day boosts that we unlock in canto 6 and 7 and relate to hokma and binah departments respectively, hokmas department controls the flow of time in the facility and binah department oversees the creation of E.G.O, and this translates over to limbus company. so chesed overseeing the welfare of his employees, and unlocking HP and SP bullets, people have mostly agreed that his durante ability will either revive a sinner or raise SP to full or even both and I have to agree this is most logical. however for the sake of my theory I am going to ignore logic. I am going to say that 

A: just since the last two abilities match the functions of their respective departments it does not establish pattern

B: Hokma's And Binah's departments are very different from the rest.

now I gonna probably make alot of mistakes here because I don't actually know a whole lot about what the seed of light is but I am gonna wing it. the seed of light's growth is directly tied to the realization of the sephiriah and not the department its self. In order to force realizations, Angela had to intentionally interfere with an departments functions except for Hokma and Binah. in order for the seed of light to grow, Angela needed to allow the department to fulfil its functions and thus I believe their realizations needed to grow the seed of light coincided with their departments function. it is for this reason I believe that Chesed's power would relate to his realization instead of his department.

# ID's and The Mirror and game mechanics

the first thing we learn about the mirror is that all possibilities are drawn from it and in the case of limbus company that possibility comes in the form of ID's. Dongbaek made the mistake believing that the mirror showed parallel worlds that were out of her reach, however she came to understand that those possibilities rested within her and were all in reach.

as the LCB continues to collect golden boughs, the sinners become stronger along with the mirror and thus dante is able to pull more possibilities in the form of ID's, it is here I would like to point out that the game makes what would otherwise be simple game mechanics like the gacha apart of the lore like railways and borrowing ID's.

# What are bad-end ID's

bad-end ID's are the capstone ID's of their respective and often show the character going down a dark road often mirroring the villain of the season. The reason I bring this up is because I believe  there is a second factor when it comes to extracting ID's which are the own characters realizations. I will be speaking of this with reference to captain ishmael and wild hunt heathcliff.

during the end of her canto ishmael sees that her quest for revenge was no different than Ahabs obsession with the pallid whale. she realized that she could've become exactly like Ahab and thus as she realized that it was a possibility it also allowed the mirror to access it and bring the possibility forth and thus we have captain ishmael.

In heathcliffs canto following the same logic, heathcliff saw a dark reflection of himself, with all of the wrath and envy he had inside of him, he realized the possibility and thus we have wild hunt heathcliff. on secondary note I would like to point out that the wild hunt said that all cathy's were meant to suffer because of heathcliff however after heathcliff realization that he could've grown pair and had just talked with cathy and tell her his feelings. I mention this because at the end of the canto dante sees this mirror world where they are both happy and it is implied the wild hunt Heathcliff saw it too. this establishes two things: 

one: in order to see and extract possibilities from mirror world, the person must realized that they have the ability to achieve that possibility.

two: dante can see into mirror worlds.

# Hong lu's good-end ID

Hong Lu much liked chesed seems to have tried deaden his emotions to avoid suffering that comes from having to confront them however much like chesed there is still a small part of him that care, represented by the faint glow in his eye so faint that you may not notice it at first. we see that Hong Lu cares through his hope to become friends with xichun again, his care for the wellbeing of xiren and his physical reaction to seeing daiyu again. it would be the urge to save them that will cause him to realize that cannot be a witness anymore and come to the realization that he can his own savior and thus a new possibility will be unlocked and Hong Lu will get his good end ID.

# The Peak Ending Of Canto 8

After a devastating attack from the final boss of the canto, all the sinners are dead except for hong lu who has been forced down to his knees.

over the course of the canto, he had seen the last few of his love ones die and now at end of it all another one is about die unless he **acts**.

***""*****I've waited a long time for a savior.*****""***

he picks himself back up, ready to fight against an insurmountable foe no matter how hopeless it may be.

***""*****someone who could free me from my inertia and wake me up inside.*****""***

the fading glimmer in his eye begins to burn brighter than it has ever done before until it almost seems as if it is blazing.

**""why did I never come to the realization that I myself could be my own savior?""**

and with that realization Hong Lu faces his foe and with it and the resonance of the golden bough, a new possibility makes itself known and much like at the manor you see into a new mirror world.

you see Hong Lu staring back at you, his eyes ablaze much like it is on the battlefield and a resolute smile on his face.

you begin to remember something faust told you long ago.

**""it is up to you to place the most effective figment of possibility on us at the right time""**

so unlike at the manor, you hold onto the possibility before you and activate your new durante ability

mid-combat you overlay Hong Lu with the new possibility and the final cinematic fight of the canto begins.

# conclusion

I understand that chances of this happening are pretty slim, imagine what bitch it would be to program an ability that allows you change ID's mid-fight. they would have to overhaul how buffs and debuffs work or else dullahan rabbit heathcliff would be thing but this idea is just so peak that I just had to share it

1krr842,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dhaka/comments/1krr842/why_bangladeshi_job_interviewers_or_employers/,Why bangladeshi job interviewers or employers does not practice the art of punctuality?,"(Long Post)

It is both disappointing and disheartening to see how an essential professional marker like punctuality is ignored by job employers or interviewers in the Dhaka job scene. I have attended quite a few interviews, but I would say this experience was the worst of them all.

(For now, let’s call it company A. I’ll add their name at the bottom.)

To begin with, a few days ago, I got a call from company A's HR saying I was shortlisted for a role (No, I won't reveal which role it was, as it seems unrelated to the topic I’m writing about). Company A is quite well-known, so I decided to attend the interview. The interview had two parts in total: first, a written test, and second, a viva (both on the same day).

The written test was scheduled to start at 1:30 PM and the viva, on the other hand, at 3:00 PM.
I live quite far from the venue, and knowing Dhaka's infamous traffic situation, I set off early.

The written test started almost 15 minutes late. Maybe this delay was a sign of the ominous situation I was about to face in a few hours! I wish I had taken that into consideration.
(P.S.: There were a good number of candidates.)

After I was done with the test, it was finally time for the viva. The clock struck 3, and still, there was no sign of it starting. After 10 minutes, we were told to be patient and that it would start within a few minutes. I hadn’t had lunch just in case the interview started soon. I didn’t want to make a bad impression in front of the interviewers.

However, 3 turned into 5. Each interview session was about 20 to 30 minutes long. When we asked how long it would take, we also raised some concerns: it was getting dark, and for those of us who live far away—especially the girls—how would we return home safely? (Acknowledging how unsafe Dhaka is for girls at night.) Also, traffic gets worse at night.

Upon raising these concerns, we were told to be patient. We were told this delay was also a “test” when it comes to attending an interview of this scale. And, this helps the employers understand if the candidate is able to handle a situation or not.

Although, one person from the interview board apologized and said they were sorry for the situation (adding that they had meetings to attend), I wondered:

■ Why couldn’t they schedule those meetings for another time?

■ Why couldn’t they shortlist candidates based on the written test and schedule the viva for another day?

■ Why did they make candidates waste the whole day?


Even though we were offered water and coffee later but this doesn't cover up the fact that time was not maintained. Because of this, I spent an entire day on an empty stomach.

To note, I’ve had the chance to give vivas at other companies, and while some were also late, none were like this. I must admit: this company broke all the records. 

I have no words.

im 17 female, and i have a strong crush on someone that is 19 M. ive known him since last year and when we originally became friends and then it went a step further and we talked in the sense of a relationship, however he was deeply uncomfortable being older than me and i was unhealed from my past relationships so we cut ties, a few months later i reached out to him as i missed his radiance and the feelings somewhat came back. i was in a relationship, but i ignored the feelings because ive not really been emotionally and spiritually invested in my relationships, however i did love them. in order for it to not ruin my past relationship, i distanced myself from 19 M. i missed him again and reached out to him if he wanted to go on a walk and he agreed and we stayed out all night listening to music. it felt like our souls were tied but the next day we didnt speak, i have now realised its a pattern of his as he has a job and adhd and doesnt always think about talking to me day in and day out, so that doesnt necessarily concern me however, we have been getting closer since January. ive known him a full year and we have the deepest conversations and we could talk all night if we were both invested in the conversation. i always think how we would be great partners because im not always wanting to talk either. i broke up with my ex because of my overwhelming feelings for this guy, then he distanced himself to probably give me space because i had a tendency to just move on in under a week without healing. so i did it again and got into a new relationship, at this point me and 19M were getting very close and making 'jokes' and i was getting very weird feelings and i am not the type to cheat so it made me feel guilty, round about the time we were getting closer, me and my most current ex broke up due to alot of mental health factors, including my best friend 19F splitting on me from her BPD so this was a very rough time in my life. my best friend was close with my recent ex and he meddled alot in our feelings and the fallout which put us both off. at this time 19M was looking after me and talking to me, sharing his thoughts and at some point last week, he told me not to worry about anything and he will even take me out for a coffee, but all of this aside, im not interested in a relationship right now and its been months since that situation so im torn because i so badly want to get closer with him and show him my love and feelings for him but i dont want to ruin the friendship or missreading his messages to fill my delusions. when we call i feel insanely overwhelmed with his presence and its harder yo hide knowing he probably feels something connecting us too. im a big romantic when i genuinely love someone and its getting irritating when i cant project it on him and these reoccurring feelings are getting harder everyday. i crave him and i hate being so emotionally invested when i want to take this time to love and nurture myself. i ask for any sort of advice from anyone because im open to new ideas

Olivia's POV

 

""Wake up, Olivia,"" Mom's voice echoed in my sleep.

 

I groaned, pulling the blanket over my head. ""Five more minutes, Mom.""

 

""We don't have any more minutes,"" she snapped, shaking my leg with a force that made it impossible to ignore. ""Get up now, or we'll be late.""

 

""Mom,"" I groaned in frustration, slowly forcing my eyes open.

 

""Don't tell me you still want to sleep,"" she said, standing at the foot of my bed, her hands placed firmly on her hips as she tapped her foot impatiently on the tiled floor. ""Other servants are already up doing their duties, but you are still sleeping? Do you want us relieved of our duties?"" Mother snapped angrily at me.

 

I sighed heavily, tossing the blanket aside as I dragged myself out of bed. ""I'm up, I'm up,"" I muttered, rubbing the sleep from my eyes.

 

""Anita is staying in the pack house for the weekend, and she has asked that you be the one to attend to her until she leaves,"" Mother announced, and my frown deepened. ""Why me? Out of all the servants, why do I have to be her personal maid?""

 

""Don't start,"" Mom said firmly, shoving me toward the bathroom. ""Get moving. There's no time for complaining.""

 

I stomped to the bathroom, muttering under my breath as I turned on the tap.

 

The thought of spending the day attending to Anita made my stomach churn.

 

Anita and I were born on the same day, which was why we were close in the first place. Once, she had been my best friend. We'd grown up together, running through the forest, sharing secrets, and dreaming of our future.

 

That was before everything fell apart.

 

My father was one of the pack's strongest warriors, and my mother worked in the pack hospital. Our family may not have been the wealthiest, but we had respect.

 

But everything changed the night of the setup.

 

I stared into the mirror as the memories replayed in my head. My father had been framed for stealing from the Alpha, a crime punishable by death. Despite his pleas of innocence, no one believed him. The evidence gotten was all pointed at him, planted carefully by someone who wanted to see him fall. We were stripped of everything. My father was imprisoned for life, my mother was demoted to an omega, and I was forced to share her fate.

 

Anita was there that night. She hadn't comforted me, hadn't spoken up for the family she once called her own. Instead, she stayed silent, her gaze avoiding mine as we were being mocked.

 

Now, years later, our former Beta had died from an incurable illness, and her father was appointed the new Beta. Anita was now the Beta's daughter. And I? I was nothing more than a servant. An omega.

 

What made it worse was how effortlessly she fit into her new role. The triplets, our Alpha's sons, Louis, Levi, and Lennox, loved her. Their attention, their admiration, it all belonged to her now. They literally worshiped the ground she walked on, and everyone believed she would turn out to be their mate once she turned eighteen, which was only a few days away. The brothers were actually competing among themselves for her attention and love, and it was so annoying to watch. Or perhaps I was just jealous of her life.

 

I finished washing up, dressed quickly into the maid's uniform, and stepped into the kitchen, where my mother was preparing breakfast.

 

""Olivia,"" my mother called, ""I know this isn't easy, but… we've already lost so much. Don't give them a reason to take more.""

 

I nodded, biting back the urge to argue. She didn't understand. How could she? I was once the daughter of a respected Gamma, but now? I was a mere Omega.

 *4*

""Here,"" my mother said, handing me a tray with a steaming cup of coffee. ""She asked for this.""

 

I frowned but took the tray and headed toward the guest room where she was staying.

 

""I'll find my mate, and all this will be over,"" I whispered, trying to comfort myself.

 

But I let out a dry laugh. Yeah, right. The only mate I would get was another omega, another nobody just like me. This life? It wasn't ending.

 

Reaching Anita's room, I sighed heavily and knocked on her door, bracing myself for another day of being reminded of how far I'd fallen, and how far she'd risen.

 

I sucked a deep breath before knocking again.

 

""Come in,"" Anita's voice called.

 

I pushed the door open carefully, keeping my head down. ""Your coffee,"" I said quietly, stepping inside the room.

 

The first thing I noticed was the sound. A soft giggle, followed by the low murmur of a man's voice. My eyes moved up for just a second, and what I saw stopped me in my tracks.

 

There they were, Anita and Louis. She was tangled in his arms on the bed, her silky robe slipping off one shoulder. His shirt was open, his muscular chest on full display as he leaned into her, his lips brushing her neck.

 

I swallowed hard. My eyes darted back to the floor, and I placed the coffee on the table. Without another word, I turned, desperate to leave.

 

""Wait,"" Anita said sharply.

 

I froze, turning back to her reluctantly.

 

She kissed Louis deeply and even moaned in between the kisses before pulling away.

 

My wolf growled in spite, but I put on a blank expression. Anita stepped out of the bed in just in her matching set of red underwear. I watched her sway her hips seductively at Louis, and I noticed how he hungrily gawked at her. Anita has a sexy body, and I have to give her credit for that.

 

She picked up the cup of coffee, her lips curling into a smug smile as she swirled the liquid inside. Her eyes scanned me from head to toe. Louis remained silent on the bed, leaning back against the headboard.

 

She took a slow sip, her nose wrinkling in exaggerated displeasure. ""What is this?"" she asked, her voice sharp and filled with annoyance.

 

""It's the coffee you requested,"" I replied respectfully, keeping my tone polite despite the way my wolf growled in the back of my mind.

 

""This?"" she scoffed, holding the cup out as if it were something filthy. ""You call this coffee?""

 

My jaw clenched, but I forced myself to remain calm. ""It was made in the way you like it,"" I said.

 

Anita's eyes narrowed in anger, and suddenly, she threw the hot coffee over my chest and arms, soaking through my dress. The sharp sting of the heat made me gasp, but I bit my lip to keep from crying out.

 

""Next time you serve me garbage like this, I swear I'll dump it on your face.""

 

Behind her, Louis remained silent, not wanting to interfere.

 

I stood frozen, my frown deepening as the coffee dripped down my skin. My wolf stirred, angry. I could almost hear her urging me to act. But what could I do?

 

""I'm sorry if the coffee wasn't to your liking,"" I said quietly, forcing the words out despite the lump in my throat. ""I'll remake it.""

 

Anita laughed, a light, annoying sound that grated on my nerves. ""Don't bother,"" she said, waving a dismissive hand. ""Just try to be less useless next time.""

 

Turning her back to me, She turned away, moving toward Louis. She slid onto his lap like I wasn't even in the room. He pulled her close, barely sparing me a glance before his lips found her neck.

 

""You're dismissed,"" he said, though his voice lacked the sharpness it usually carried.

 *1*

I swallowed hard, nodded, and turned to leave, my heart racing in my chest.

 

Fated To Not Just One, But ThreeAs I stepped out of the room, I let out a shaky breath. The humiliation burned as much as the coffee had, but I sucked in a deep breath and gathered my emotions.

 

Making my way back to the kitchen, I met with Bala, Lennox's personal guard. ""There you are. Lennox calls for you,""

 

I frowned. ""Did he say why?"" I asked, my stomach tightening. Lennox, the eldest of the triplets, rarely summoned me unless it was important. And rarely for anything good.

 

Bala shrugged. ""Not exactly, but he seemed really furious.""

 

A lump formed in my throat, but I forced myself to stay composed. Without another word, I turned and made my way to Lennox's room.

 

When I reached his door, I hesitated for a moment before knocking. Instantly, His authoritative voice ordered me in. Fated To Not Just One, But Three [Read Link](https://authors.codeshive.online/brothr-1/)

1krqyjz,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1krqyjz/the_adventure/,The adventure,"Prologue

There was something in the air—a magnetic buzzing, that subtle electric tingle just before a storm. He looked into her sea-glass eyes, and in an instant, the world around them dissolved like chalk drawings in the rain. The hands on the clock seemed to pause in reverent silence. His own hands trembled slightly as he raised them to her face, his fingers weaving gently into her soft black hair. One thumb came to rest lightly on her cheek.

In that moment, she knew it was all over.

Enveloped in his gaze—those blue eyes shimmering like heat haze on sun-baked asphalt—her heart thrummed wildly, like a hummingbird trapped against a windowpane.


Chapter 1

Some memories play like old film reels: a little aged, somewhat faded, flickering in sepia tones—yet still cherished, still replayed. Others are like snapshots, carefully tucked away in dust-covered albums, vivid in their technicolor beneath silky slips of tissue paper, opened only in quiet moments and poured over with silent tears.

Those are my memories of him.

Bittersweet though they are, I still turn the pages now. I see that sidelong smile, and I remember fondly how those eyes once looked at me as though I were the only thing in the world that mattered.

In the quiet of the attic, the afternoon sun casts delicate fingers of light through the twin oval dormer windows, stirring the dust into dancing motes that drift in golden ribbons down to the warm wooden floor, where I sit cross-legged and remember.


We met while I was working in the warehouse—the tall, brooding inspector and the short, slightly chubby cleaner. An unlikely pairing, almost painfully cliché.

I remember the first time I saw him: that intense blue stare peeking out from beneath the brim of his cap, his stern expression as he strode down the aisles. He cut an intimidating figure.

A few months passed before he spoke more than a brief nod of greeting. I must have looked ridiculous in my blue lab coat, green wellington boots, and white hairnet—my pale, round face half-covered by the face masks our employer still insisted we wear, long after the pandemic had passed.

“Jayne, isn’t it?”

I looked up from the stainless-steel packing tables I’d been dutifully scrubbing, halfway lost in a daydream of somewhere warmer, sunnier—anywhere but that cold, cavernous warehouse with its grim, dust-covered surfaces.

“Yeah, that’s me,” I replied, surprised he knew my name. I smiled behind my mask, grateful for the barrier between me and those piercing eyes.

It was then I noticed the blue of his eyes wasn’t the cold, sharp hue of glacial ice, but something softer—the warm lapis of a summer sky. Framed by downy black lashes, the slight creases at their corners hinted that he was smiling, too, behind his mask.

“I’m Brad,” he said, “why don’t you pop up for a coffee break?”

And there it was: the sliding door moment. The quiet, unexpected shift in direction. Like a rowboat, gently drifting toward land, only to be pulled—slowly, imperceptibly—back toward the open sea. 

Through many months of bitter cold, chapped hands, and long, miserable nights, he became my refuge.

We would sneak away to the staff kitchen—far from the droning machinery and the clatter of voices. It was there, across that battered table and over steaming mugs of coffee, that we explored strange and wonderful worlds of thought. Our conversations were odd, meandering, often surreal. He asked questions with such earnest curiosity that I always answered without hesitation.

Even then, we understood how rare it was—to connect so completely, to lay bare our innermost thoughts without fear of judgment. There was a real kind of magic in that.

I feel the cool trail of a tear on my cheek now, as the memory of that magic washes through me.

To this day, I still don’t understand what he saw when he looked at me. But without the cap and mask and warehouse regalia, he was the most devastatingly handsome man I’d ever seen up close. Light bronze skin, neatly kept dark hair and beard—all framed those unforgettable summer-blue eyes. He was lean and muscular, his clothes seeming to fit him perfectly, even when he arrived in baggy sweats and Converse. Somehow, that only made him more beautiful.

He asked about my life, and I told him everything: the lonely child, youngest of four, a late addition to a tired family. The rebellious teenager who defied God and anyone else who tried to contain her. The runaway bride who married young, settled down, but never quite stopped craving the road. And in turn, he told me the things that kept him up at night—the strange, intrusive thoughts we all sometimes have but rarely dare to speak aloud. The ones only the dreamers ever admit to.

There was nothing either of us could say that shocked the other. Only curiosity, only understanding. That, too, was part of the magic.

It was one of those mornings when everything seemed to stretch out forever. The sky still dark, the cold pressing in, and the only warmth between us coming from that tiny kitchen. It felt like an eternity of simple moments, a quiet connection forming as we passed mugs of coffee between us.

Brad asked about my marriage one evening—an unexpected question, but one that felt more like a delicate probe than an interrogation. He was leaning against the counter, the dim kitchen lights casting shadows over his face, making him seem almost unreal.

“You ever think about leaving?” he asked, his voice gentle, but searching.

I set my coffee down, surprised by the question. I hadn’t thought of it in a long time, but the thought settled quickly, heavy and true. Of course, I had thought about it.

I never gave him a straight answer, not because I was hiding anything, but because I wasn’t sure myself. “What’s the point?” I replied, my voice surprisingly cold. “You can’t run from things like that. Or maybe you just don’t know how to get out.”

He didn’t ask for details, didn’t pry, but his eyes lingered on mine with that understanding, that quiet sympathy that made me feel—strangely—like I wasn’t alone.

I found myself doing the same to him: asking questions I didn’t expect answers to. “You ever have regrets?”

He laughed softly, the sound rich and easy. “Regrets? I like to think I don’t have regrets, that everything that happens shapes who you become, but I suppose everyone has them.” He stopped, looking me over as if choosing his words carefully. “But I think the real question is: Can you live with them?”

I thought about that for a long time, chewing on the idea until I could almost taste it, bitter and sweet.

I didn’t ask him more, but the silence between us deepened, a comfortable tension in the space that had never been there before. The kind of tension that made you feel something was on the edge of happening—if only you could figure out which direction to go in.

Days went by, and somehow, the rhythm of those little conversations became everything. His smile, quiet and crooked, like he knew something I didn’t. His easy laughter, rich and effortless, despite the world we were in. And always, those eyes—those piercing summer-blue eyes—locking onto mine with a certainty that seemed to say he’d seen it all and still wanted to see more.

It was in those moments I started to wonder whether I could do this—whether I could let someone in again. Brad was different, wasn’t he? It didn’t feel like he was pressing me for anything, but something about him drew me in. The way he didn’t force me to be anyone I wasn’t, how he didn’t rush to fill the spaces in between our words. He just was, and somehow, that was enough.

But I could still feel the sharp edge of my past—the whisper of guilt over promises I hadn’t kept, the quiet ache of things unsaid. I didn’t know what was blooming between us, but I knew it wasn’t something simple.

So, as always, I hesitated. I kept him close enough to feel the warmth, but far enough away to avoid the fire.

We both did, in our own ways.

One night, as I passed the staff kitchen with a bin bag in each hand, I heard my name.

“Jayne.”

His voice was low, almost hesitant. I paused and turned, and there he was—Brad—already at the counter, two mugs beside him, the soft amber glow of the overhead light catching in his hair.

I dropped the bags by the kitchen door and walked in, brushing a curl back under my hairnet. “Everything alright?”

He was quiet for a beat, looking down as he filled a cafetière with slow, methodical care. “I was just thinking,” he said. “Do you believe people are meant to be monogamous?”

I froze—not visibly, not enough for him to notice, but something inside me tilted. I leaned on the kitchen island, trying to keep my tone light.

“That’s a heavy one for a night shift,” I said, offering a half-smile.

“I know.” He looked up at me, eyes searching. “It’s just something I’ve been thinking about lately.”

I shrugged. “Honestly? Probably not. We’re animals, when you get down to it. We’ve only been pretending at permanence for a few centuries.”

His lips curved—just a little—but his gaze stayed steady. “Have you ever thought about cheating?”

I raised my brows slightly. Not accusatory. Just surprised by the frankness. “Of course I have,” I answered simply. “Anyone who’s been in a long-term relationship and says otherwise is either lying or hasn’t had the chance.”

He seemed to relax a little at that—his shoulders losing their tension, his breath steadying.

“I’m not saying I want to,” he added quickly, eyes darting down. “I just… sometimes I think about what it would feel like. To be wanted by someone else. To not have to be the same person I’ve always been.”

I nodded slowly, suddenly seeing him differently—not just the strong, unshakable man I’d admired from afar, but a man quietly drowning under his own roles: partner, father, provider.

I pulled off my gloves and ran a hand through my flattened hair. “It’s not wrong to want more than survival,” I said. “Wanting doesn’t make you bad. Acting without thought does. But feelings? They’re just… human.”

We stood there, two humans in a warehouse kitchen, holding mugs of too-strong coffee and wondering how far down this path we were already walking.


The next few shifts felt different.

Something had been said—admitted, maybe—and it hung in the air like perfume: invisible, but unmistakable.

We hadn’t touched. Not really. A shoulder brushing a shoulder. Fingers lingering too long on a mug. A shared look that lasted one second too many. But even that felt intimate. Charged.

I found myself watching him when I shouldn’t. Wondering how often he thought about me the way I thought about him.

At home, I’d hear a joke and instinctively think, Brad would laugh at that. I’d find myself checking my phone for his messages, even when I knew I shouldn’t care.

That was the beginning, wasn’t it? The moment the current shifted beneath us, subtle but irreversible. We hadn’t crossed any lines yet—but we were standing at the edge, barefoot, watching the tide come in.

And I couldn’t help but wonder… what would happen if we let it pull us under?

Chapter 2 

I was nervous. Not fearful, but humming with anticipation—like something immense waited just beyond the edge of the moment. The hotel room was small, slanted in that quaint countryside way, its walls hugged in grey jacquard paper, yellow velvet curtains hanging heavy at either side of the window. The bed took up most of the space, swallowing the room in soft folds of white and shadow.

You weren’t due to arrive until evening. I had come the day before—partly to breathe, partly to be alone in a place that didn’t demand anything from me. It had been months since my divorce was finalized, but the weight of domestic life hadn’t lifted; if anything, it had redoubled, cloaked now in the quiet judgment of neighbors, of family, of strangers who thought they knew what kind of woman I was.

I adored my sons—then five and eleven—but the ache for space, for freedom, still roared like a tide. I never did run far, though. Always returned when called. Like magic. Like duty.

But this time was different. This time, I had invited someone into my escape.

“Any plans for your days off?” you asked me across a row of dusty binders, your blue eyes catching the light like sea glass.

I didn’t think, I just said it. “I’m running away.”

You smiled. “Where to?”

“Hotel. Two nights. Just outside Edenbridge.”

Your brow raised slightly, curious but reserved. I met your gaze. “You can come… if you want.”

The pause that followed stretched between us like a string, pulled tight. “Really?”

You didn’t need to say more. Your eyes had already answered.

We’d been flirting for weeks by then. I wasn’t even sure how it started—perhaps it bloomed in the spaces between our laughter and coffee and private asides. Perhaps it began when I let my walls slip just enough for you to glimpse the girl inside—the wild, defiant girl who had never wanted to be someone’s wife, only someone’s wonder.

Maybe you saw her and wanted to reach for her.

Maybe I wanted you to.

And so we found ourselves, not quite by accident, preparing to cross a line we both had drawn… and redrawn… and now pretended wasn’t there at all.

I waited for you in that little room, the red velvet robe you liked knotted loosely at my waist. The hours stretched like molten sugar. Each knock on a door down the corridor set my heart racing, but I knew your footsteps when they came—steady, certain, familiar in a way that was frightening.

You smiled when you saw me, your eyes crinkling at the corners like they always did when you were happy. You kicked off your shoes and dropped your bag, and in a breath we were tangled—mouths warm, bodies hot, limbs eager.

Later, breathless and laughing, I pulled away.

“Let’s take a walk,” I said, pushing my hair out of my eyes, robe fluttering behind me like a flag.

You raised an eyebrow. “Now?”

“Yes,” I said. “Let’s go see what’s out there.”

And so we did.

We wandered into the moonlit dark, down the narrow lane across from the hotel, our feet crunching against gravel, hearts unspooling with every step. A field opened up before us, wide and quiet under a thin silver moon. You took my hand. I didn’t pull away.

We walked without direction, vaulting muddy ditches, whispering secrets, laughing like children who had slipped away from watchful eyes. That’s when we heard it—the distant thrum of an approaching train.

We found the little station, barely more than a platform and a sign. No lights. Just the stars and the sound of night. We sat down, backs against the fence posts, knees grazing.

You told me about your childhood then. About the things you’d done that you weren’t proud of. The way anger had lived inside you like a second soul. I listened, surprised—but not afraid. You weren’t that boy anymore. Maybe I wasn’t that runaway girl either.

And then the train came—fast, bright, loud. It roared past us like a beast, the wind tearing through my hair, leaving behind a kind of stillness that felt sacred.

You were grinning like a boy again.

We stumbled back to the hotel, muddy and flushed, and fell into bed. I remember the mirror—how we caught each other’s eyes in its reflection as your hands held me with such intensity, such possession. You whispered against my skin, “Look how beautiful you are. Look at us.”

You reached for me, and I welcomed it—welcomed you. The electricity between us had grown impossible to ignore, and now, in the dim hush of that strange little room, we crossed the threshold with abandon. You kissed me with hunger, not rushed but urgent, as though tasting something rare you didn’t want to lose. And I responded, not with hesitation, but with intent.

In your touch, I felt powerful. Desired. There was no part of me you treated like a flaw to be overlooked, no softness you shied away from. I saw myself reflected in your gaze—worthy, magnetic, whole. I let the layers fall away, one by one, and for the first time in a long while, I didn’t feel like I had to shrink to be wanted. I expanded into your hands, bold and unashamed.

We moved together in a rhythm that felt ancient and new all at once. The world faded to a blur of breath, skin, and quiet gasps. You held me like something sacred, and it made me feel more alive than I had in years.

But then—after.

The room fell still, our bodies cooling in the afterglow. I turned away, instinctively curling back into myself, into the quiet safety of solitude. This was what I’d told myself it would be: a moment, a night, nothing more.

And then you reached out.

You tapped your chest gently and opened your arm in invitation.

A small, silent gesture—yet it landed like thunder.

It was tenderness. It was trust. And it frightened me more than anything else that night.

I hesitated. My heart, still pounding, thudded now with a different kind of force. To lie with you like that—with my head on your chest, my breath synced to yours—meant letting you in past the walls I had so carefully constructed. It wasn’t physical; it was emotional. It was real.

And I wasn’t sure I was ready for real.

But something in your eyes—something calm, unguarded—made the choice for me. Slowly, I turned and nestled into your warmth, resting my cheek just above your heartbeat. My fingers brushed your chest where your tattoo curled across your skin, and your arm came around me in a quiet, steady hold.

I lay there, still and cautious, staring into the dark.

You kissed the crown of my head, and in that single, gentle act, I felt everything shift.

I had thought the danger was in wanting you. But the truth was, the real danger was in being wanted back.

Chapter 3

Do you remember the day I crashed my car?

It had been a long, bleary morning after a sleepless night at work and the blur of the school run. My limbs felt like lead, my mind hazed and heavy. I was meant to be coming to meet you, already anticipating the comfort of your presence, when I turned down the wrong lane—one that had been closed for repairs. I realised too late, and in the act of turning, clipped a low steel bollard. The crunch was sharp, metallic, final. The front corner of my little car crumpled like a paper cup.

I sat there for a moment, stunned, gripping the wheel with shaking fingers. And then, almost without thinking, I texted you. My location. A picture of the damage. A weak joke about my questionable driving.

You arrived not long after, striding up with that easy, concerned look you always wore when you were trying not to look too worried. I was still gathering broken bits of headlamp from the roadside, my hands dusty and streaked with grease from my futile attempt to realign the shattered bumper.

You didn’t scold me. You laughed. You took a bottle of water from the backseat and gently poured it over my hands, wiping them with the corner of your hoodie sleeve. You said something about me being a menace on the roads. I smiled through the knot in my throat.

We sat together in the backseat then, our world narrowed once again to the quiet interior of my car. You handed me a doughnut and a cup of hot chocolate you’d brought along, and for a few minutes, it was as though nothing had gone wrong at all. That car had become something of a sanctuary—our little hideaway where the rest of the world faded to a low hum. It was where we talked, whispered, kissed. Where I existed fully in your gaze.

It was in that same seat, windows cracked to the crisp morning air, where you looked at me with a seriousness I wasn’t expecting.

You reached out, gently cradling my face in your calloused palms, your thumbs brushing just beneath my cheekbones. There was a flicker in your eyes—something vulnerable, hesitant.

“If… someday,” you began, voice low, “if something happens and for whatever reason we don’t see each other anymore… I want you to find someone who looks at you the way I do. Someone who sees you like I see you. That’s the least you deserve.”

The words hit me like a silent avalanche—soft, but unstoppable. They cracked something open in me. A longing too big to name. A grief for something I hadn’t even lost yet.

You said more after that, but I couldn’t take it in. My pulse filled my ears as I leaned forward, resting my chin on your shoulder, letting the warmth of your body press against mine. I didn’t speak. I couldn’t.

I wonder if you felt the tear that slipped down my cheek then, unnoticed by you, or perhaps graciously ignored.

There were more moments like that as time went on. Little goodbyes disguised as tenderness. You were trying to wean us off of each other slowly, weren’t you? Like it would somehow hurt less that way.

But love doesn’t leave neatly. It rips at the seams. It leaks out through the smallest cracks.

And then came the break-ups.

The first time was at work. You were colder than usual. Something in your tone had shifted, and I noticed. I always noticed. So I asked.

You said it wasn’t right. That you needed to focus on your marriage. That you didn’t want to hurt me.

I stood there, blinking in the sterile light of the corridor, trying to stay upright while something inside me fractured. I nodded. Said nothing. Walked away with what grace I could muster.

But by the time I reached the door, the tears were burning. I made some excuse to my boss, some half-truth to get away, and fled. I hadn’t expected to pass you on the way out, hadn’t wanted to, but fate seemed determined to twist the knife.

You followed me. Caught up to me. Climbed into my car while I sobbed into the heel of my hand. You were quiet, pained. You held my hand for a moment. Your consolations piercing me even with their softness. Then you left.

The next few days were unbearable.

And then, a message.

“I miss you.”

Just like that, we were back.

Until we weren’t.

Because the next time, it was me. My turn to try and be brave. To say what I’d known in my bones since the beginning—that this could never be more. That you were never going to choose me, not really. That I had become the secret, the shadow life, the “what if” that couldn’t live in the light.

We met for coffee down by the harbour. I told you that I couldn’t do it anymore. That the guilt, the waiting, the wondering… it was too much. You sat across from me, expression carefully blank. But your eyes. Your eyes gave you away. They always did.

Before we parted, you gave me your sweatshirt.

I drove away, wrapped in it, with Come Away With Me playing softly through the speakers. I didn’t make it past the end of the song before I broke down completely.

We didn’t stay apart for long.

We never did.

It was a sunny morning when I saw you again, standing near the sea with your hands in your pockets. You looked at me, and I knew.

“I can’t be without you,” I said. “Whatever this is, whatever we are—it’s enough.”

And it was.
Until it wouldn’t be.

But in that moment, on that windswept path above the shore, I chose the fantasy again. I chose the ache over the emptiness. Because loving you, even in secret, even in stolen fragments, felt more alive than anything else I had known.

Yet somewhere behind the sweetness, there was always the shadow. The quiet knowing. That I would never be the woman waiting at the end of the aisle. That I would never be the one folding your laundry, or picking up the children from school. I would never be your emergency contact, or the name you spoke in sleep.

I would only ever live in the parentheses of your life.

And some nights, when the clock struck that strange, breathless hour between midnight and morning, I wondered if all of this—the joy, the heartbreak, the longing—was simply the cost of feeling visible.

Because you saw me. Not just the version I presented to the world, but all of me—unfinished, unraveled, unfiltered.

That was the true danger, wasn’t it? Not the affair, not the secrecy, not even the fear of being caught.
It was how much I had let you in.
And how, despite everything, I was beginning to want more.

More than you could give.
More than I had any right to ask for.

But I didn’t say that then. I just smiled. Took your hand. And let myself believe—for one more day—that it would be enough.

Chapter 4

A sharp, persistent beeping outside startles me, wrenching me back from the warmth of the past. I wipe at my eyes, suddenly aware of the dust on my fingertips. The attic is dim now, the afternoon light thinning like a memory. I rise slowly, stiff from sitting too long, my bones creaking in quiet protest. I wander toward the window, trying to see the source of the noise, but the glass is old—warped and cloudy—and everything beyond it swims in a pale blur.

I turn away. My gaze falls to a small white box resting atop an old wooden dresser. Pandora. The name gleams in gold embossed letters on the lid.

That summer—it had been our first. My birthday in June.

You had worked the night shift. I was on rest days, a rare oasis in the chaos of home life. Just after sunrise, you messaged me to meet you at the farm road near the warehouse. The world was still quiet, dew clinging to the hedgerows, the sky awash in soft, buttery light.

“Get out of the car and close your eyes,” you wrote.

I did as you asked, stepping into the still morning, the faint chirp of birds the only sound. “Okay,” you said, your voice warm with mischief. “Open.”

And there you were. Standing beneath the pale blush of dawn, grinning ear to ear in jeans and a fitted black T-shirt, your cap turned backwards, flowers in one hand, a white gift bag in the other.

I laughed, surprised by the giddy swell of emotion in my chest. You handed them to me—no big speech, no dramatic gesture. Just a look in your eyes that made everything else dissolve. In the bottom of the bag was the small box. Inside, a silver charm for my bracelet—a miniature traveler’s rucksack, delicately engraved with the words life is for adventure.

That’s what we called our nights together—our adventures. And somehow, they always were.

It didn’t matter where we went. The magic wasn’t in the location, it was in the escape. You were never just my lover—you were my co-conspirator, my getaway driver, my secret world.

I can still recall each place with perfect clarity, as though the memories were pressed between glass:
Edenbridge, with the moonlit train tracks and fields wide enough to hold our laughter.
Faversham, where we curled up in a shepherd’s hut and let the fire and something more primal melt our bones.
Martin Mill, where a half-feral cat named Boriss slept at our feet and I pretended it didn’t mean something, the way you scratched him behind the ears and said, “He’s already chosen you.”
Rye, with its hot tub and low beams and the soft thump of rain on the windows as we tangled ourselves around each other like ivy.
Deal, where we built a bonfire on the beach, your hoodie slung around my shoulders, our bare toes tucked into the pebbles.

Every memory had a flavour. Every trip, a rhythm.

We wandered the garden of England like teenagers playing house, hands brushed accidentally in markets, whispered jokes over greasy breakfasts, kisses stolen behind half-closed curtains.

And in those places—far from our real lives, from expectations and obligations—you could love me out loud.

There were no children there. No partners waiting at home. No tangled webs of guilt and loyalty. Just you and me and the temporary illusion that the world belonged to us, even if only for a night.

In those escapes, I let myself be soft again. I forgot to keep my walls up. I laughed with my whole face. I let you touch me without flinching. And sometimes, when you looked at me like I was the only person who had ever mattered, I forgot to be afraid.

You slipped past my defenses so easily. Like you’d always belonged there.

I hadn’t meant to let you in—not all the way. At the start, I told myself it would be physical only. That I wouldn’t let you kiss me on the mouth, because that meant something. I thought I could keep it simple.

But love is never simple.
And neither were you.

One night, as we stood in the kitchen laughing about something silly—probably that damn cat—you pulled a coin from your pocket. One I had given you months before. Engraved on one side: Yes. On the other: No.

You flipped it into the air, caught it deftly, and slapped it onto the back of your hand. You didn’t look.

“What are you asking?” I whispered, suddenly breathless.

You didn’t answer at first. Just smiled.

Then: “If I’m really in love with you.”

And there it was. That tightening in my chest. That awful, exquisite ache.

You turned your hand.
Yes.

I remember I laughed. Not because it was funny, but because I didn’t know what else to do with the terror blooming in my gut.

Because yes meant this wasn’t just a fantasy anymore.

It meant I wasn’t just playing pretend.
It meant that someday, you might have to choose.
And I already knew how that would end.

Chapter Five

The beeping continues — not distant now, but insistent, insidious. A pulse. A warning. My skin prickles. The attic grows dim as the sun lowers itself toward the edge of the world, casting long fingers of shadow that climb the walls like something alive. I feel them stretch toward me.

Then I see it — the photograph.

Propped carelessly on the edge of an old toy chest, half-hidden behind a frayed copy of The Secret Garden, it glows with strange intensity. My breath catches.

It’s a selfie.

I’m astride my motorcycle, helmet off, wind-tossed hair spilling down my shoulders. My lips are pursed in a playful kiss. My eyes are trained on the lens — trained on you. I had taken it just before setting off again, on a quiet stretch of road, the trees whispering in the summer breeze. I’d stopped impulsively, pulling onto the gravel shoulder to snap it and send it to Brad. A small gift. A reminder. A piece of me, reaching out to him through space and time.

But something about it now — something is wrong.

The longer I stare, the more the image begins to distort. At first, I think it’s a trick of the fading light. Then it blurs, flickers — and moves. The photograph shifts. It’s no longer still.

It’s video.

And now I am watching her — watching myself. I see the playful moment just after the kiss, when I laugh and look down to check the picture. I adjust my position slightly on the seat. I remember doing this. I remember thinking how I wanted to look just a little more windswept, a little more cinematic. The sky behind me was beautiful. I wanted you to see me under it.

Then I hear it — the distant hum of tires on tarmac. A van appears in the background, just beyond the curve of the roundabout.

My heart begins to pound.

I lean closer. My fingers stretch out toward the image, as though I could halt time by touch. My voice catches in my throat — not quite a scream, not yet a prayer.

The van accelerates. I see its front wheel buckle slightly, a tire splitting under pressure. I turn my head, still smiling, still unknowing — just as the van jerks violently toward the shoulder.

The screen freezes.

A single frame.

My face, beginning to change — not quite fear yet, just the first shiver of realisation. A split-second moment suspended in eternity.

And then I understand.

I am not in the attic.

I am not alive.

Or at least, not entirely.

The room spins, but the air feels suddenly too still, like a stage after the curtain falls. I stagger back from the photograph. My knees hit the floor. My palms press to the warm wooden boards that had felt so solid, so real. But now the texture is… wrong. Too smooth. Too clean. This is memory. A constructed shelter, not built by hand, but by heart.

I thought I had come here to remember.

But I came here to hide.

From pain. From truth. From the terrible sound of metal and bone and silence that followed.

I look back at the photograph — now still again, but colder. Less like a memory and more like a gravestone. The version of me in that image had been so alive, so certain she would see you again.

Now I don’t know where you are.

Or if I can reach you.

I rise, unsteady, heart galloping in my chest. The attic is dimming fast now. The warmth of earlier, the gentle nostalgia, has gone. If I remain here, I will dissolve into the dust and shadows, lost in yesterday.

I turn toward the hatch, the only way down. The only way through. My fingers close around the top rung of the ladder.

And in the hush before I move, I hear your voice.

Soft. Steady. Clear as rain on a summer roof.

“Jayne.”

It’s not a plea. Not a tether. Not a pull backward.

It’s permission.

And I descend.

The warm light sharpens, becomes too bright, too white — clinical.

The scent of antiseptic creeps into my senses, and suddenly the grey falls away like dust shaken from a dream.

I’m standing, barefoot on a cold tile floor, wrapped in a thin, open-backed hospital gown. The room is sterile, sharp-edged. A fluorescent hum fills the silence. Machines beep steadily, rhythmically, like a countdown ticking backward toward life. I look down at my hands — trembling, scratched. Real.

Am I still dreaming?

I glance up, and for a moment — just a flicker — I see him.

Brad.

He’s there, standing by the window in the sunlight, his outline washed in gold. His blue eyes are soft, like they were the first time he ever looked at me without judgement. Without hesitation.

“Brad?” I whisper, my voice caught in my throat.

He doesn’t speak. He just smiles — sad, beautiful, accepting.
 
Somewhere in the room I can hear a small voice, soft and urgent, almost pleading—barely above a whisper: “mum…are you awake?”

Then he’s gone.

A blink, and all that remains is the sunlight.

I hear a rustle of fabric, a soft sniffle, and then the gentle pressure of a small, familiar hand gripping mine. I look to my right — and there they are.

My boys.

My youngest, his curls messy and damp with sleep, resting his head on my arm. My eldest, seated on the edge of the hospital chair, watching me with wide, cautious eyes, blinking back tears. Their faces are pale, their clothes wrinkled. They look like they’ve been here a while.

And beside them, her arm protectively around their shoulders — Suzie.

My sister.

She looks like me — the same deep, dark eyes, the same stubborn brow. She’s older, yes, and softer around the edges, but I’ve always admired her grace. I never told her that, not properly.

“You’re awake,” she says gently, and her voice is tight with relief. “Oh, Jayne, you scared the hell out of us.”

I try to speak, but my throat is raw. I manage a whisper. “Suzie… do you have my phone?”

She nods, reaches into her oversized handbag, and pulls it out. It’s scratched, smudged with mud. A faint crack runs across the screen, and I feel a jolt of something like shame at the sight of it.

But it still lights up.

The lock screen is my boys — both laughing, windblown and wild — taken on some forgotten summer afternoon. The sight of them makes my breath hitch.

Suzie hands me the phone, her fingers warm against mine. “It’s still working,” she says gently. “You were lucky.”

I press my thumb to the screen.

Several missed calls. My parents — their names stacked like accusations.

One from Emily, my best friend. “Are you okay?? Please call me.” 
Another from her a few hours later reads “I will be back once i’ve showered, don’t go anywhere, I love you” 

And then, beneath all of it, that tiny icon.

The photo.

The last message I sent.

The selfie from the roadside. My hair wild from the helmet, my eyes full of mischief and sunlight — a kiss blown toward the camera.

To Brad.

I tap the screen.

Still unread.

The silence that follows isn’t empty. It’s full. Full of the things I can’t unsay. The things he can’t say now. The ache of absence. But also — the weight of survival.

Suzie leans in, brushing a hand against my hair, her voice low. “We almost lost you. They said it was close… You’ve been out for nearly two days.”

I swallow the lump forming in my throat and look down at my sons. Their faces are turned toward me, eyes wide with wordless love.

I squeeze their hands.

 I didn’t come back for Brad.

I came back for them.

And maybe — that’s exactly what he would have wanted.


. Epilogue

The message came the night I got home from the hospital.

The house was dim and quiet, filled with the subtle weight of everything unchanged — the same pile of unopened post on the side table, the familiar creak in the floorboard outside the boys’ room. Suzie had made up the bed with clean sheets. My youngest was already asleep, curled in the crook of his brother’s arm on the sofa, a blanket tangled around their legs like ivy.

I sat on the edge of the bed, in an oversized hoodie and hospital socks, staring out the window at the soft, blue haze of evening. My body ached in strange, slow ways. But it was the silence that throbbed deepest — the kind that hums behind your ribs when you’ve come too close to not returning.

Then the phone buzzed.

It had been sitting, scratched and slightly muddy, on the bedside table where Suzie had left it. I picked it up without thinking. The lock screen lit up, and there it was — a message from Brad.

“I heard about the accident… Jayne, I’ve been going mad thinking about you. I wanted to come see you, I really did, but I didn’t know if I’d even be welcome. I hate that you were alone through something like that. I should’ve been there. I’m so sorry. Please, if you’re okay, let me know. I need to know you’re okay.”

I read it twice. Then again.

He meant it. I could feel the weight of his words — not romantic, not performative, just real. There was no follow-up. No pressure. Just that small, trembling olive branch from a man whose life had always been stitched in two directions.

But I didn’t write back.

Not because I was angry. Not even because I didn’t love him. That, perhaps, would never fully go away. I didn’t write back because I finally understood that I had never truly belonged in his world — I had been a chapter in his story, while he had been the entire book in mine.

And yet, I was still here.

Not to find another love or chase the kind of passion that had once lit me up like fire. No, that had burned itself out. Now I lived for smaller flames — the laughter of my sons as they played football in the garden, the gentle nudge of Suzie refilling my tea on the days when I got too quiet, the way morning light fell through the kitchen window and made the cracked tiles shine.

This is the life I saved.

This is the life I chose.

And when I turn out the light each night, I think of the charm he once gave me — the silver backpack with its tiny engraving:

“Life is for adventure.”

Maybe this was the adventure all along

# Chapter 1: omega

 

Olivia's POV

 

""Wake up, Olivia,"" Mom's voice echoed in my sleep.

 

I groaned, pulling the blanket over my head. ""Five more minutes, Mom.""

 

""We don't have any more minutes,"" she snapped, shaking my leg with a force that made it impossible to ignore. ""Get up now, or we'll be late.""

 

""Mom,"" I groaned in frustration, slowly forcing my eyes open.

 

""Don't tell me you still want to sleep,"" she said, standing at the foot of my bed, her hands placed firmly on her hips as she tapped her foot impatiently on the tiled floor. ""Other servants are already up doing their duties, but you are still sleeping? Do you want us relieved of our duties?"" Mother snapped angrily at me.

 

I sighed heavily, tossing the blanket aside as I dragged myself out of bed. ""I'm up, I'm up,"" I muttered, rubbing the sleep from my eyes.

 

""Anita is staying in the pack house for the weekend, and she has asked that you be the one to attend to her until she leaves,"" Mother announced, and my frown deepened. ""Why me? Out of all the servants, why do I have to be her personal maid?""

 

""Don't start,"" Mom said firmly, shoving me toward the bathroom. ""Get moving. There's no time for complaining.""

 

I stomped to the bathroom, muttering under my breath as I turned on the tap.

 

The thought of spending the day attending to Anita made my stomach churn.

 

Anita and I were born on the same day, which was why we were close in the first place. Once, she had been my best friend. We'd grown up together, running through the forest, sharing secrets, and dreaming of our future.

 

That was before everything fell apart.

 

My father was one of the pack's strongest warriors, and my mother worked in the pack hospital. Our family may not have been the wealthiest, but we had respect.

 

But everything changed the night of the setup.

 

I stared into the mirror as the memories replayed in my head. My father had been framed for stealing from the Alpha, a crime punishable by death. Despite his pleas of innocence, no one believed him. The evidence gotten was all pointed at him, planted carefully by someone who wanted to see him fall. We were stripped of everything. My father was imprisoned for life, my mother was demoted to an omega, and I was forced to share her fate.

 

Anita was there that night. She hadn't comforted me, hadn't spoken up for the family she once called her own. Instead, she stayed silent, her gaze avoiding mine as we were being mocked.

 

Now, years later, our former Beta had died from an incurable illness, and her father was appointed the new Beta. Anita was now the Beta's daughter. And I? I was nothing more than a servant. An omega.

 

What made it worse was how effortlessly she fit into her new role. The triplets, our Alpha's sons, Louis, Levi, and Lennox, loved her. Their attention, their admiration, it all belonged to her now. They literally worshiped the ground she walked on, and everyone believed she would turn out to be their mate once she turned eighteen, which was only a few days away. The brothers were actually competing among themselves for her attention and love, and it was so annoying to watch. Or perhaps I was just jealous of her life.

 

I finished washing up, dressed quickly into the maid's uniform, and stepped into the kitchen, where my mother was preparing breakfast.

 

""Olivia,"" my mother called, ""I know this isn't easy, but… we've already lost so much. Don't give them a reason to take more.""

 

I nodded, biting back the urge to argue. She didn't understand. How could she? I was once the daughter of a respected Gamma, but now? I was a mere Omega.

 *4*

""Here,"" my mother said, handing me a tray with a steaming cup of coffee. ""She asked for this.""

 

I frowned but took the tray and headed toward the guest room where she was staying.

 

""I'll find my mate, and all this will be over,"" I whispered, trying to comfort myself.

 

But I let out a dry laugh. Yeah, right. The only mate I would get was another omega, another nobody just like me. This life? It wasn't ending.

 

Reaching Anita's room, I sighed heavily and knocked on her door, bracing myself for another day of being reminded of how far I'd fallen, and how far she'd risen.

 

I sucked a deep breath before knocking again.

 

""Come in,"" Anita's voice called.

 

I pushed the door open carefully, keeping my head down. ""Your coffee,"" I said quietly, stepping inside the room.

 

The first thing I noticed was the sound. A soft giggle, followed by the low murmur of a man's voice. My eyes moved up for just a second, and what I saw stopped me in my tracks.

 

There they were, Anita and Louis. She was tangled in his arms on the bed, her silky robe slipping off one shoulder. His shirt was open, his muscular chest on full display as he leaned into her, his lips brushing her neck.

 

I swallowed hard. My eyes darted back to the floor, and I placed the coffee on the table. Without another word, I turned, desperate to leave.

 

""Wait,"" Anita said sharply.

 

I froze, turning back to her reluctantly.

 

She kissed Louis deeply and even moaned in between the kisses before pulling away.

 

My wolf growled in spite, but I put on a blank expression. Anita stepped out of the bed in just in her matching set of red underwear. I watched her sway her hips seductively at Louis, and I noticed how he hungrily gawked at her. Anita has a sexy body, and I have to give her credit for that.

 

She picked up the cup of coffee, her lips curling into a smug smile as she swirled the liquid inside. Her eyes scanned me from head to toe. Louis remained silent on the bed, leaning back against the headboard.

 

She took a slow sip, her nose wrinkling in exaggerated displeasure. ""What is this?"" she asked, her voice sharp and filled with annoyance.

 

""It's the coffee you requested,"" I replied respectfully, keeping my tone polite despite the way my wolf growled in the back of my mind.

 

""This?"" she scoffed, holding the cup out as if it were something filthy. ""You call this coffee?""

 

My jaw clenched, but I forced myself to remain calm. ""It was made in the way you like it,"" I said.

Doesn't really matter if it does not sound like the bestest of instruments - the bestest of instruments are not kept on the floors of hospital technical spaces.
