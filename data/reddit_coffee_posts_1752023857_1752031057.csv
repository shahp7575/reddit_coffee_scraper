It’s just something you mix with your coffee, no changing your meals or routine.

After a few days, I realized I wasn’t snacking as much. I felt fuller longer, and I wasn’t craving sugary stuff mid-morning like I used to.

It’s not a magic pill, but it made sticking to my healthier habits way easier.

The strainer is doing its job minimizing fines migration. 400g completed in 1m30s. The cup was severely under extracted at 5.3 clicks on a ZP6. That explains why yesterday's cup wasnt as sweet as the first pour didn't get to do it's job but the 2nd half immersion did it's job and then some. I will repeat the test again at 4.x clicks.

1lv862q,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1lv862q/how_to_best_manage_income_loans/,How to best manage income & loans,"Age: 24 

Salary starting next month: 83k (pre tax- estimating I will take home around $4800 a month)

Extra income: around $1500 take home after tax 

HYSA: $20,000 (3.65% APY)

Brokerage account: $100 invested in VOO (lol) 

Checking: $1400

No Roth IRA or 401k started yet. New job starting next month offers 11% 401k match so I plan to start contributing right away. I am also going to open a Roth IRA and contribute the max each month (around 580) 


BILLS:
- Student loans: 97,000 at 7% interest rate. My main goal is to pay this off in 5 years, which means $2k a month. I would only have to contribute $1700 to reach this number because my job offers a $300 monthly tax free contribution to loans. 
- car payment $455 
- no rent (I live at home) 
- no additional credit card debt 
- around $250-300 ish a month for subscriptions + nails + food/coffee + minimal   daily spending  

Doing the math,  after contributing to my 401k, Roth IRA, student loans, car payment and daily spending, I’ll have around 2200 extra a month left. Although additional expenses are bound to happen and this number may be significantly less some months, what would be the best thing to do with any extra money? Do I put it in my HYS? Brokerage account ? Contribute more to my loans? 

My main financial goals are to pay off my student loans and save for a house within the next 6-8 ish years. Any tips would be greatly appreciated!

1lv85m3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lv85m3,(Update) Year 2: You gotta do what you gotta do…,"Hey fellow farmers!
Remember me? The chaotic soul from Year 1 who was living inside a preserve jar factory? Well, big things have happened in Year 2, and I’m back with an update.

I got a shed!! Which means… no more preserve jars in the living room! I’ve officially cleared out my house and moved all production to a fully loaded shed packed with kegs, oil makers, and preserve jars. But now my house feels… kinda empty? Like, eerily quiet. I went from sleeping among the sweet scent of melon jelly to just… walls. Send interior decorating tips. Please.

Meanwhile, on the farm:
	•	So many pigs… They’re cute, rich in truffles, a pain in the butt to pet, and absolutely reek. This is why they’re stationed far, far away from my freshly cleared-out home.
	•	Greenhouse is nearly maxed out. A few fruit trees, tons of ancient fruit, and some coffee to keep things buzzing.
	•	Double tree farms. One for lumber that I only chop when fully grown. The other’s my syrup/resin operation, tapped and thriving.
	•	Beehive chaos. I finally got a full setup going, but I forgot one minor detail… flowers. So now I have one poor flower out there working overtime to keep a whole swarm of bees happy. Pray for her.
	•	Berry overload. Blueberries, strawberries, and now cranberries. I seem to be drowning in berries, but with winter on the way, I want those kegs working overtime.

Looking for advice:
	•	Are preserve jars still worth it long-term?
	•	Should I finally invest in a coop, or nah?
	•	What do you think I’m behind on?

Still Joja (I can feel the spirits disapproving), but I’m definitely thinking about going the community route next time.

So far, I’ve done three—Dora‘s Loft, Sunshine Town, and Slow Life Cafe. I enjoyed the ladder two, a book nook and a cozy coffee shop, but Dora’s Loft definitely takes the cake for my favourite. It was not the best first taste into the word of Rolife miniatures due to the complexity and time it takes to build, but I loved it. Maybe I wanted to scream at times and stomp all over those annoying little wire decorations that would fall apart before the glue dried, but ever since I finished it I’ve longed for something that challenging again. Something that takes at least a month, something that makes me want to rip my hair out. So my question is, what should my next Rolife creation be? My two strong contenders are Emily’s Flower Shop and Casey’s Greenhouse, leaning more towards Emily’s. The one slight concern is that according to my internet sleuthing, Emily’s Flower Shop comes in two separate variants—the original, substantially more challenging one, and the newer, updated, and way easier one. Is there a way to ensure I get the harder one? Is the updated one actually easier? With Casey’s Greenhouse, I’d appreciate knowing roughly how long it takes, how complicated it is, etc, etc. Either way, I’d love to know your experiences with building either Emily’s or Casey’s, or any other mega-hard rolife kits you’ve done that you’d recommend to someone who wants to get frustrated by it.

1lv7zj4,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1lv7zj4/husband_loves_to_play_dead_i_made_it_happen_he/,"Husband loves to play dead? I made it happen - He thought for a second, ""I'll give it another week, maybe.","Three months after my husband went missing in a skiing accident, I saw him at a bar.

He had his arm slung around ""sis-bro"" Jamie's shoulder, laughing like he was free from a life sentence. “Thanks to you, dude,” he was saying, ""I was starting to forget what real freedom felt like.""

His bros were buying him shots, one after another, asking when he was going to surface.

He thought for a second, ""I'll give it another week, maybe. Let her sweat it out a bit, you know, drive her crazy before I show my face again.""

I was standing in the shadows, watching him bask in his 'freedom', and dialed my friend at the county records office.

1.

“I’m going to have Mark Harrison declared legally deceased,” I said, my voice tight.

“You're not going to keep looking?” my friend asked, hesitating.

I looked up at Mark, who was now whispering something to Jamie, and my eyes stung. “There’s no point.”

You can’t find someone who doesn’t want to be found.

I hung up and went back to my booth.

My bestie, Sarah, saw my face and shoved a drink into my hand. “Look, honey, Mark’s been gone for three months. The odds of him being alive are basically zero. You need to let go, move on.”

I stared at the colorful drink in my glass and downed it in one go.

The burn of the liquor made my eyes water, and I blinked back the tears, asking, “Do you think anyone would fake their own death to get away from their wife?”

She looked at me like I’d sprouted a second head. ""What kind of crazy talk is that? Only a real dirtbag would pull a stunt like that. He’d be better off actually dead!”

I wiped away the tears and grabbed my purse.

“You’re right, I need to let him go.”

I left and went home.

The house was silent. It’d been this way for three months. I hated the silence. I’d started leaving all the lights on, brewing a cup of his favorite tea and putting it on the coffee table, pretending he was still there.

I just didn't understand. If he didn't want to be married to me anymore, he could have just filed for divorce. Why fake a skiing accident and disappear?

I sat on the couch and picked up the two cartoonish figurines of us he'd given me.

“When I’m not here,"" he’d said, grinning, ""these little guys can keep you company.""

His words clashed with the annoyed tone I’d heard at the bar.

“Chloe was sweet and chill before we got married, but now she’s way too clingy. This fake-out will teach her a lesson and she’ll lay off.”

Jamie had poured him another shot. “Well, at least I never cling to you! We've been buds for years.”

“You’re the best, man,” he'd replied.

They called themselves “bros” but their legs were intertwined.

The thought made my stomach churn.

I chucked the figurines in the trash and grabbed my phone, sending a mass text:

Mark Harrison passed away in an accident three months ago. Memorial service next week.

Mark’s buddies started hammering me with texts, full of outrage.

“How can you have a funeral if you haven’t found his body?”

“Chloe, have you lost it? Mark's not dead!”

“If Mark comes back and sees his own memorial service he’s gonna lose it! Chloe, think this through, do you want to make Mark angry?”

I didn't reply to the first texts, only to the last:

“He’s dead. He’s beyond being angry now.”

I tossed my phone aside and started packing up Mark’s stuff.

For the past three months, I had been searching for him in the mountain town where he was “skiing,” and barely been home.

The bedroom was mostly as we'd left it.

I opened his closet and froze.

His clothes were gone, like half of them, and all that was left were the items he’d never wear at this time of year.

Tears started to fall.

I had spent three months looking for him, and he’d been sneaking back here to grab his crap whenever I wasn't around.

2.

I pulled up the security footage and fast-forwarded through the last month.

At the start of the month, Mark had walked in with his arm around Jamie, leaving two hours later with a ton of clothes.

Mid-month, he’d carried Jamie into the house, and Jamie hadn't left till the morning.

A couple of nights ago, they'd come home under the cover of darkness, leaving early yesterday morning.

I had been looking for him in the next state over when these things had happened.

I watched the screen as tears streamed down my face, not for Mark, but for myself.

How had I fallen for such a scum bag?

I had been losing sleep, worrying about him, while he and his ""bro"" were sleeping in my house, maybe even my bed.

I clenched my fist and willed myself not to start hyperventilating.

The phone rang.

I didn’t want to answer but it kept ringing.

I took a deep breath, got up and looked at the caller ID.

It was Mark's uncle, Ben Harrison. I quickly answered. “Uncle Ben, is everything okay?”

“Mark’s not dead.”

He sent a video.

It was Mark and Jamie doing a sake bomb, their eyes glued to one another.

My breath hitched, and my fingers trembled as I spoke. “I know he’s not dead.”

The man sounded surprised, but then laughed. “Then why are you planning a funeral?”

“Everyone kept saying he was dead. I wanted to believe it. So, he gets a funeral.”

Ben was silent for a second. “So you’re saying you’re widowed?”

“Yeah,” I replied.

Ben Harrison was Mark's uncle by adoption, and I barely knew him.

He was the first person to tell me straight up that Mark was alive. I felt like I owed him something for that.

“If you’re free next week, you can come to the service.”

“I will.”

Then another video came through.

Mark’s friends are showing him something on their phone and he throws his drink. Jamie puts her hand on his chest like she’s trying to calm him down.

The bar was too loud for me to hear, but I could see Mark's face soften. He even buried his face in Jamie’s shoulder.

He must have seen my mass text, and he got pissed. And, somehow, just a few words from Jamie had soothed him.

Whenever he got mad at me, he’d make me spend the night thinking about what I did wrong. Only then he would forgive me.

I closed my eyes, saved the videos, and set the phone down.

Right then, Jamie called.

I answered, and the loud music in the background nearly deafened me.

Jamie was shouting. “Chloe! Are you planning a memorial service for Mark? Are you crazy? Cancel that thing now! If he ever sees it when he comes back, you’ll be sorry!”

Before she finished, I hung up, grabbed a blanket, and crashed on the couch.

It was the first good sleep I’d had in three months.

The next morning, I went down to the courthouse to get Mark declared officially deceased.

Once I got the paperwork, I went to Jamie’s place.

Her front door was closed, and it took me several tries on the doorbell before I heard footsteps.

She was wearing a silk robe, leaning against the doorframe, and there was evidence of a good time all over her neck and collarbone.

“Oh, it’s you. What do you want?”

I glanced at her neck, then her face, which held nothing but contempt.

“I wanted to invite you to Mark’s memorial service. Seeing as you were his ‘best bro’ after all.”

Jamie rolled her eyes and sneered. “Chloe, you’re his wife. He went missing three months ago. Instead of looking for him, you’re just planning a funeral?

“What if he’s not dead? Are you trying to wish him into his grave? What kind of a wife does that?”

I pulled the death certificate from my bag, laughing. “He's been under the snow for three months. I couldn't find him, so he's officially dead now.”

“That’s what everyone told me to do. To move on.”

When I’d gotten the bad news, I’d fainted.

The next morning all of Mark's friends were sitting around my bed.

""Honey, the area he went missing is really dangerous, it’s going to be hard to find anyone. Maybe you should just give up.”

""Yeah, it's a lost cause.""

I’d gotten up, booked a ticket, hired a rescue team and headed to the mountains.

For two and a half weeks I didn’t sleep or eat.

I hadn’t noticed then, how there wasn’t any panic in any of his so-called friend’s eyes. Just amusement.

Jamie’s jaw dropped, and then I heard a crash from inside her apartment.

She glared at me and warned, “Don’t pull anything stupid. When Mark gets back you’ll be sorry!”

I ignored her, like I had the night before, and walked away.

3.

The argument from behind her door was loud.

Now that he heard that I declared him officially deceased, Mark was starting to lose his mind.

But I wasn't going to let him find me.

If he could disappear for three months, I could certainly be gone for a few days.

I grabbed a packed bag and asked Sarah to book a hotel room for me using her name and ID.

I've been hiding out at the hotel for the past few days, buying funeral supplies and that's it.

Sarah showed up looking smug.

“I hear some dude is tearing up the city looking for you. Dude's flipped out. They're all over the news.""

I watched the news, seeing a missing person poster with Mark’s face and smiled. “He can look all he wants. I won’t let him find me. When he said he wanted to make me sweat and then come back, why is he sweating now?”

“He deserves it, the jerk. Why does the world have such awful men in it?”

She was getting worked up, and I had to cut her off, ""Hey, it's my husband's funeral today, I'm supposed to be sad, remember?""

I got out my makeup bag, and turned myself into a hollow, sad, wreck.

Once Sarah was certain I looked miserable enough, we left for the funeral.

On the way, I gave her a USB drive with all the videos of Mark and Jamie, and told her to play it when I gave the signal.

Only then did I send out the funeral address.

First to arrive was Ben. He stepped out of his black car and took a white flower from me, pinning it to his lapel. ""My condolences.""

Next came the clueless relatives.

Their grief was genuine, and it made my heart ache.

Mark, you fake your own death, and you hurt the people who actually care about you.

Today, you’ll pay for it.

Finally, his “bros” arrived.

They all looked pale and sick, and their hands trembled when they took their flowers.

One of them dragged me to the side.

“Hey, honey, you need to stop this! Mark is not dead! He’s going insane looking for you! Have you seen the missing person posters?”

I blinked, and let out two tears.

“Don’t try to cheer me up, those missing posters were Jamie’s idea.”

""A dead man cannot return to life. I’ve given up hope that he will.""

He tried to say something but I nodded to Sarah, who grabbed his arm and sat him down.

Once everyone had arrived, I got up on stage, and adjusted the mic.

“Thank you all for coming to the memorial service for my late husband...”

A scream cut me off.

“Chloe! What the hell are you doing? I said Mark isn’t dead!”

Jamie was standing at the entrance, glaring at me.

“Are you even his wife? How can you have a funeral when he’s been missing for three months? I won’t let you!”

I looked behind her. Mark wasn’t there.

So, even now Mark still wasn’t going to show his face.

I glared back at Jamie, “You won’t let me? Who are you to tell me what to do? You just said it yourself, I’m his wife.”

Jamie stared at me, tears filling her eyes. “How can you be so cruel? Mark loves you so much. How can you just declare him dead like that?”

“What if he isn’t?”

My eyes went to her marked neck and I smiled. ""Even if he isn’t, I don’t want to waste my time on a cheater.”

I had Jamie dragged off to a side and continued with the service.

I was about to say something when a disheveled looking man appeared at the door.

“Honey, I’m not dead! I’m back!”

Chapter 2

4.

Mark ran to me and pulled me into a tight hug, shaking as he whispered my name.

“Chloe, you have no idea how much I’ve missed you.”

“I fell while skiing and broke several bones. Luckily, a kind soul got me to the hospital. It took me three months to heal before I could see you.”

“I’m alive, look! I’m right here!”

He grabbed my hands and made me feel him all over, like he needed to prove he'd really had a brush with death.

I just watched him act.

Once he finally noticed how awkward he looked, I laughed.

""Are you done now?""

1lv7zig,https://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/1lv7zig/hey_reddit_i_built_a_social_donation_app_called/,"Hey Reddit! I built a social donation app called ""hey!"" and need your marketing wisdom 🫒","Hey everyone! 👋

So I've been working on something pretty cool for the past few months (okay, maybe more like a year 😅) and I'm excited to share it with you all!



\## What is ""hey!""?

I created a social donation app called **""hey!""** where users can donate ""olive points"" that they naturally earn through everyday social activities like:

\- Chatting with friends

\- Posting on social media

\- Engaging with content



The cool part? You can donate without spending any money! and Anyone who needs help can create a donation project and receive these olive points from the Users. It's like turning your social media time into something meaningful! 🌱



\## The Journey So Far

I built this entire thing by myself—from planning and design to all the frontend and backend development. Honestly, it would've been impossible without the help of AI! (Shoutout to all the AI tools that saved my sanity 😂) Yes, I'm that crazy person who decided to solo-develop a social app. It's been a wild ride - lots of late nights, coffee, and probably way too much time staring at code. But hey, it's finally live and working!



\## The Marketing Challenge

Here's where I need your help, Reddit fam! The app is out there, but getting people to discover it is proving to be... well, let's just say it's harder than debugging that one bug that took me 3 weeks to find! 

I'm not exactly a marketing guru (I'm more of a ""build cool stuff and hope people like it"" kind of person), so I'm turning to you all for advice.

  
\## Why I'm Sharing This

I believe in the concept - turning social media engagement into real help for people who need it. But I also know that great ideas need great marketing to reach the right people.

So, Reddit, what's your take? Any marketing wizards out there who want to help a fellow developer figure out how to get this thing in front of the right people?



Thanks for reading my ramble! 🙏



\*P.S. If anyone's curious about the technical side or wants to know more about how the olive points system works, I'm happy to geek out about that too!\*

I made it happen | Three months after my husband went missing in a skiing accident, I saw him at a bar.","**Husband loves to play dead? I made it happen**

Three months after my husband went missing in a skiing accident, I saw him at a bar.He had his arm slung around ""sis-bro"" Jamie's shoulder, laughing like he was free from a life sentence. “Thanks to you, dude,” he was saying, ""I was starting to forget what real freedom felt like.""His bros were buying him shots, one after another, asking when he was going to surface.He thought for a second, ""I'll give it another week, maybe. Let her sweat it out a bit, you know, drive her crazy before I show my face again.""I was standing in the shadows, watching him bask in his 'freedom', and dialed my friend at the county records office.1.“I’m going to have Mark Harrison declared legally deceased,” I said, my voice tight.“You're not going to keep looking?” my friend asked, hesitating.I looked up at Mark, who was now whispering something to Jamie, and my eyes stung. “There’s no point.”You can’t find someone who doesn’t want to be found.I hung up and went back to my booth.My bestie, Sarah, saw my face and shoved a drink into my hand. “Look, honey, Mark’s been gone for three months. The odds of him being alive are basically zero. You need to let go, move on.”I stared at the colorful drink in my glass and downed it in one go.The burn of the liquor made my eyes water, and I blinked back the tears, asking, “Do you think anyone would fake their own death to get away from their wife?”She looked at me like I’d sprouted a second head. ""What kind of crazy talk is that? Only a real dirtbag would pull a stunt like that. He’d be better off actually dead!”I wiped away the tears and grabbed my purse.“You’re right, I need to let him go.”I left and went home.The house was silent. It’d been this way for three months. I hated the silence. I’d started leaving all the lights on, brewing a cup of his favorite tea and putting it on the coffee table, pretending he was still there.I just didn't understand. If he didn't want to be married to me anymore, he could have just filed for divorce. Why fake a skiing accident and disappear?I sat on the couch and picked up the two cartoonish figurines of us he'd given me.“When I’m not here,"" he’d said, grinning, ""these little guys can keep you company.""His words clashed with the annoyed tone I’d heard at the bar.“Chloe was sweet and chill before we got married, but now she’s way too clingy. This fake-out will teach her a lesson and she’ll lay off.”Jamie had poured him another shot. “Well, at least I never cling to you! We've been buds for years.”“You’re the best, man,” he'd replied.They called themselves “bros” but their legs were intertwined.The thought made my stomach churn.I chucked the figurines in the trash and grabbed my phone, sending a mass text:Mark Harrison passed away in an accident three months ago. Memorial service next week.Mark’s buddies started hammering me with texts, full of outrage.“How can you have a funeral if you haven’t found his body?”“Chloe, have you lost it? Mark's not dead!”“If Mark comes back and sees his own memorial service he’s gonna lose it! Chloe, think this through, do you want to make Mark angry?”I didn't reply to the first texts, only to the last:“He’s dead. He’s beyond being angry now.”I tossed my phone aside and started packing up Mark’s stuff.For the past three months, I had been searching for him in the mountain town where he was “skiing,” and barely been home.The bedroom was mostly as we'd left it.I opened his closet and froze.His clothes were gone, like half of them, and all that was left were the items he’d never wear at this time of year.Tears started to fall.I had spent three months looking for him, and he’d been sneaking back here to grab his crap whenever I wasn't around.2.I pulled up the security footage and fast-forwarded through the last month.At the start of the month, Mark had walked in with his arm around Jamie, leaving two hours later with a ton of clothes.Mid-month, he’d carried Jamie into the house, and Jamie hadn't left till the morning.A couple of nights ago, they'd come home under the cover of darkness, leaving early yesterday morning.I had been looking for him in the next state over when these things had happened.I watched the screen as tears streamed down my face, not for Mark, but for myself.How had I fallen for such a scum bag?I had been losing sleep, worrying about him, while he and his ""bro"" were sleeping in my house, maybe even my bed.I clenched my fist and willed myself not to start hyperventilating.The phone rang.I didn’t want to answer but it kept ringing.I took a deep breath, got up and looked at the caller ID.It was Mark's uncle, Ben Harrison. I quickly answered. “Uncle Ben, is everything okay?”“Mark’s not dead.”He sent a video.It was Mark and Jamie doing a sake bomb, their eyes glued to one another.My breath hitched, and my fingers trembled as I spoke. “I know he’s not dead.”The man sounded surprised, but then laughed. “Then why are you planning a funeral?”“Everyone kept saying he was dead. I wanted to believe it. So, he gets a funeral.”Ben was silent for a second. “So you’re saying you’re widowed?”“Yeah,” I replied.Ben Harrison was Mark's uncle by adoption, and I barely knew him.He was the first person to tell me straight up that Mark was alive. I felt like I owed him something for that.“If you’re free next week, you can come to the service.”“I will.”Then another video came through.Mark’s friends are showing him something on their phone and he throws his drink. Jamie puts her hand on his chest like she’s trying to calm him down.The bar was too loud for me to hear, but I could see Mark's face soften. He even buried his face in Jamie’s shoulder.He must have seen my mass text, and he got pissed. And, somehow, just a few words from Jamie had soothed him.Whenever he got mad at me, he’d make me spend the night thinking about what I did wrong. Only then he would forgive me.I closed my eyes, saved the videos, and set the phone down.Right then, Jamie called.I answered, and the loud music in the background nearly deafened me.Jamie was shouting. “Chloe! Are you planning a memorial service for Mark? Are you crazy? Cancel that thing now! If he ever sees it when he comes back, you’ll be sorry!”Before she finished, I hung up, grabbed a blanket, and crashed on the couch.It was the first good sleep I’d had in three months.The next morning, I went down to the courthouse to get Mark declared officially deceased.Once I got the paperwork, I went to Jamie’s place.Her front door was closed, and it took me several tries on the doorbell before I heard footsteps.She was wearing a silk robe, leaning against the doorframe, and there was evidence of a good time all over her neck and collarbone.“Oh, it’s you. What do you want?”I glanced at her neck, then her face, which held nothing but contempt.“I wanted to invite you to Mark’s memorial service. Seeing as you were his ‘best bro’ after all.”Jamie rolled her eyes and sneered. “Chloe, you’re his wife. He went missing three months ago. Instead of looking for him, you’re just planning a funeral?“What if he’s not dead? Are you trying to wish him into his grave? What kind of a wife does that?”I pulled the death certificate from my bag, laughing. “He's been under the snow for three months. I couldn't find him, so he's officially dead now.”“That’s what everyone told me to do. To move on.”When I’d gotten the bad news, I’d fainted.The next morning all of Mark's friends were sitting around my bed.""Honey, the area he went missing is really dangerous, it’s going to be hard to find anyone. Maybe you should just give up.”""Yeah, it's a lost cause.""I’d gotten up, booked a ticket, hired a rescue team and headed to the mountains.For two and a half weeks I didn’t sleep or eat.I hadn’t noticed then, how there wasn’t any panic in any of his so-called friend’s eyes. Just amusement.Jamie’s jaw dropped, and then I heard a crash from inside her apartment.She glared at me and warned, “Don’t pull anything stupid. When Mark gets back you’ll be sorry!”I ignored her, like I had the night before, and walked away.3.The argument from behind her door was loud.Now that he heard that I declared him officially deceased, Mark was starting to lose his mind.But I wasn't going to let him find me.If he could disappear for three months, I could certainly be gone for a few days.I grabbed a packed bag and asked Sarah to book a hotel room for me using her name and ID.I've been hiding out at the hotel for the past few days, buying funeral supplies and that's it.Sarah showed up looking smug.“I hear some dude is tearing up the city looking for you. Dude's flipped out. They're all over the news.""I watched the news, seeing a missing person poster with Mark’s face and smiled. “He can look all he wants. I won’t let him find me. When he said he wanted to make me sweat and then come back, why is he sweating now?”“He deserves it, the jerk. Why does the world have such awful men in it?”She was getting worked up, and I had to cut her off, ""Hey, it's my husband's funeral today, I'm supposed to be sad, remember?""I got out my makeup bag, and turned myself into a hollow, sad, wreck.Once Sarah was certain I looked miserable enough, we left for the funeral.On the way, I gave her a USB drive with all the videos of Mark and Jamie, and told her to play it when I gave the signal.Only then did I send out the funeral address.First to arrive was Ben. He stepped out of his black car and took a white flower from me, pinning it to his lapel. ""My condolences.""Next came the clueless relatives.Their grief was genuine, and it made my heart ache.Mark, you fake your own death, and you hurt the people who actually care about you.Today, you’ll pay for it.Finally, his “bros” arrived.They all looked pale and sick, and their hands trembled when they took their flowers.One of them dragged me to the side.“Hey, honey, you need to stop this! Mark is not dead! He’s going insane looking for you! Have you seen the missing person posters?”I blinked, and let out two tears.“Don’t try to cheer me up, those missing posters were Jamie’s idea.”""A dead man cannot return to life. I’ve given up hope that he will.""He tried to say something but I nodded to Sarah, who grabbed his arm and sat him down.Once everyone had arrived, I got up on stage, and adjusted the mic.“Thank you all for coming to the memorial service for my late husband...”A scream cut me off.“Chloe! What the hell are you doing? I said Mark isn’t dead!”Jamie was standing at the entrance, glaring at me.“Are you even his wife? How can you have a funeral when he’s been missing for three months? I won’t let you!”I looked behind her. Mark wasn’t there.So, even now Mark still wasn’t going to show his face.I glared back at Jamie, “You won’t let me? Who are you to tell me what to do? You just said it yourself, I’m his wife.”Jamie stared at me, tears filling her eyes. “How can you be so cruel? Mark loves you so much. How can you just declare him dead like that?”“What if he isn’t?”My eyes went to her marked neck and I smiled. ""Even if he isn’t, I don’t want to waste my time on a cheater.”I had Jamie dragged off to a side and continued with the service.I was about to say something when a disheveled looking man appeared at the door.“Honey, I’m not dead! I’m back!”Chapter 24.Mark ran to me and pulled me into a tight hug, shaking as he whispered my name.“Chloe, you have no idea how much I’ve missed you.”“I fell while skiing and broke several bones. Luckily, a kind soul got me to the hospital. It took me three months to heal before I could see you.”“I’m alive, look! I’m right here!”He grabbed my hands and made me feel him all over, like he needed to prove he'd really had a brush with death.I just watched him act.Once he finally noticed how awkward he looked, I laughed.""Are you done now?""""The kind soul that took you to the hospital...that was Jamie, right?""Mark froze.He tried to look confused. “Chloe, what are you talking about? I don’t understand.”I watched him fake confusion. After three months of being lied to, I slapped him.“You hid from me for three months. Why didn't you just stay hidden?""Weren’t you planning to show your face once I'd gone crazy looking for you? I'm not crazy yet.

1lv7vu9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lv7vu9/my_exs_kid_is_staying_with_me_for_a_few_days_its/,My ex's kid is staying with me for a few days. It's causing some tension between me and my girlfriend.,"I was backing my car up my driveway after a long day of work, eager to get out of my uniform and onto the couch, when I first saw him.

There was a little kid, a boy, standing on my porch. 

Oddly, my first reaction was fear, though I couldn’t tell you why. But I could feel my heart speed up as soon as I saw his face pop up in my rear-view mirror. He was dressed in denim shorts and a red t-shirt, and a backpack was slung over his shoulders. His face was pale, and he had light brown hair peeking out from underneath a blue baseball cap. His eyes locked onto mine in the reflection as I put the car in park and pulled the keys out of the ignition.

I broke off the unsettling eye contact to glance up and down the street. *What if this is a robbery*, I thought wildly. *That’s a thing, isn’t it? Children used as decoys, to get your guard down?* I shook my head a little, realizing how ridiculous I sounded. *Jesus, I need to lay off the late-night true crime rabbit holes.* 

The street was empty, except a tabby cat wandering idly by the storm drain. I glanced back toward the boy as I gathered my duffel bag and laptop case from the backseat. Then it dawned on me, and I laughed at myself. Once every few weeks or so, I’d get neighborhood kids knocking on my door, asking to retrieve a frisbee or football or whatever else out of my backyard. My fence shared a side with two other yards, both of which housed apparently very social and rambunctious children,

Chuckling, I shut the car door a little too hard, sending the cat scurrying off down the street. I waved at the boy. “So what is it this time? Soccer ball?” I asked him as I stepped up onto the porch.

He cocked his head slightly. “Ball?”

“Yeah, did y’all throw something over the fence again? If you give me a minute to set my stuff down, I’ll grab it for ya.” That’s when I realized something. I couldn’t hear any kids playing behind the house. Besides a sprinkler across the street and a police car siren going off in the distance, it was quiet. I could feel myself getting a little nervous again, this time worried that this kid was lost or in some sort of trouble. I squatted down, concerned. “Hey, what’s your name?”

“Matt.” Something about him seemed familiar but I couldn’t quite put my finger on it yet.

“Alright, Matt, you okay? Where’s your parents?”

He shuffled his feet. “She brought me here.”

“Your mom, you mean? She dropped you off…here? Like on my porch? Why-” Then an idea hit me. The reason he looked familiar.

I tried to smile at him. “Is your mom’s name Jennifer? Jenny?”

He nodded. I sighed, probably failing to hide how frustrated this whole situation was making me.

Jenny was my ex. We didn’t date very long. I’m the one who called it off. She’d been great, at first, but it soon became apparent she had a serious drug problem. I couldn’t deal with the mood swings or the constant stealing and lying, so after a last-ditch effort to get her to get help- which she staunchly refused- I broke it off. *Damn, maybe this is a robbery after all* I thought darkly. Part of me still felt bad about dumping someone that was obviously in a bad place, but honestly, I just wasn’t equipped to handle that sort of thing. I was *also* not equipped to handle kids, and looking at Matt, I realized this was the longest conversation I’d had with someone other than an adult in years. 

I found out Jenny had a kid, or perhaps multiple, pretty early on in our relationship, but I never met them. They didn’t live with Jenny, and it was obviously a bit of a sore topic for her. When I asked, she told me that the dad was an asshole that refused to let her see them, and that was the first and last time it was brought up. Of course, later I’d realize the real reasons behind her lack of custody, but at the time I didn’t want to upset her so I didn’t pry into it further.

And here I was, still unable to shake her out of my life. This was really putting a damper on my plans of doing absolutely nothing on a rare stretch of off days.  I unlocked the door and walked into the house, setting my bags down inside. “You can put yours down with mine here.” No reply. I turned back and saw Matt had not followed me in yet. He stood right outside the doorway, head tilted, eyes on me. 

“Hey, come on inside. It’s getting dark out here and the porch light is busted.” I shepherded the boy into my living room and onto the couch. I sat across from him in an armchair. After a couple minutes of awkward silence, I asked him why Jenny had dropped him at my doorstep.

“There was no one else. None close enough.” Matt hadn’t yet blinked. His eyes were wide and dark. They reminded me of a shark, or some other cold-blooded animal.

I rubbed my eyes wearily and groaned. That didn’t surprise me. The only bridges Jenny *hadn’t* burned were shady characters that had no business taking care of a kid. Not that I had any idea how to, either, but at least she didn’t have to worry about Matt stepping on a dirty needle or seeing God-knows-what at a wild house party. And Marlene, Jenny’s mother- God, I did not want to have to deal with her again, but I figured she would be my best bet to pass along the kid. She lived about four hours away- likely why he hadn’t been dropped in her care to begin with- but I would be more than happy to make the drive. I just needed to call her to get the address. 

I glanced at my phone. Nearly 9 o’clock. I looked over at the boy. He’d been staring at me blankly the whole time. I’m not a fan of kids, to be honest- I don’t hate them, I’m just never around them much. But this kid gave me the creeps. I wondered why she had to leave him behind so quickly, and why he was with her in the first place. I hoped she had checked herself into rehab, getting help before she could talk herself out of it again, and not something nefarious. 

“Do you, uh, want some food?” Matt shook his head. “Not hungry? Okay. Are you tired? It’s getting kinda late. When’s your bedtime?” He shrugged. *This is like pulling teeth. Come on, Patrick, get it together. You’re the adult here.* 

I pulled out some spare sheets and an extra pillow, turning the couch into a makeshift bed. I opened the backpack and found a couple changes of clothes and some toiletries. I handed Matt a pair of PJ’s and a toothbrush and guided him to the bathroom. Once he shut the door, I wandered into my own bedroom and pulled out my phone. I tried calling Jenny first. **The number you are trying to call is no longer in service.** I wasn’t that surprised. Her not paying her phone bill, or losing her phone, had always been a point of tension while we were together. 

I sighed. Steeling myself, I dialed Marlene’s number. After a few rings, it put me through to voicemail. I left a quick one, stammering out a couple sentences explaining what was going on and to call me back ASAP, then hung up. 

*Should I call the police?* I didn’t want to get Jenny in trouble, not if she was trying to turn things around. Besides, I had no idea where she was currently since she moved to a new apartment after the breakup. I walked out into the living room and was surprised to see Matt already fast asleep on the couch. It hit me just how exhausted I was. It had been an insane week at work, and I’d put in a nearly 11-hour shift. Yawning,  I decided that I’d be able to deal with everything better after getting some rest. I double checked all the locks and then got into bed, leaving my door open a crack in case anything happened and Matt needed me. I passed out almost immediately.

“*Daddy. Daddy*.” 

My eyes shot open. The soft glow of the alarm clock illuminated a pair of eyes inches from my own. “Shit!” I scrambled upright. “Jesus, Matt, you scared me. I’m sorry.” I frowned. “I’m not your dad.”

The eyes stared, unblinking. ”Oh.” I could barely make out his outline in the dark. 

“Are you okay?”

“There’s a monster trying to get in.”

“Monsters aren’t real. You probably had a bad dream.” Like I said, I’m not great with kids. “Go back to bed, okay?”

“Can I sleep in here with you?”

“No, I don’t think that’s appro-”

“I can sleep on the floor.” I didn’t like the thought of that, but I was too tired to argue. “Okay, sure, I guess.”

Up until that point, Matt hadn’t been very emotive. He hadn’t laughed, or smiled, or cried. But when I said that, he grinned wide, and something about it made my stomach flip. Maybe it was the way the green light bounced off of his teeth, evoking the image of a cheshire-cat, or maybe a wolf. 

I stayed frozen as he disappeared beneath the side of my bed. I couldn’t see him, but I could hear his soft breathing, and every once in a while he’d make this odd clicking sound, the way one might against the roof of your mouth with your tongue. It took me a long time to fall back asleep, and when I did, it was fitful.

I woke to knocking on the front door. The clock read 11 o’clock. I must’ve slept straight through my alarm. Sunlight streamed in through the cracks in the blinds, making me squint. I peeked over the edge of the bed, half-hoping last night was just a weird dream, but the crumpled blanket and pillow were still laying on the floor. Matt, however, was not. 

I hastily pulled on some jeans and made my way to the front door. The boy was in the living room, staring blankly at the TV. It was off. “Morning,” I said, a little nervously. “Here, let me help.” I switched the TV on. A solemn-looking news anchor stood above a running banner reading **Suicide 'epidemic' has experts...** I quickly flipped through channels before landing on something more child-friendly. The knocking got louder. “Okay, okay, I’m coming!” I jogged to the door and cracked it open. 

“Were you still sleeping? It’s almost noon! What, did you forget your hot, awesome girlfriend was coming over?” She winked playfully, smiling.

I blinked, still groggy. Yeah, I had. With the long workday yesterday and all the strangeness of last night’s events, I had totally forgotten about our plans. Sheepishly, I grinned. “I’m sorry, it’s been a long night.” Her eyes wandered over my shoulder and her smile faltered slightly. “Who’s that?”

“Um, it’s kind of a long story. Come on in, I’ll make you some coffee.”

A few minutes later, I had gotten her up to speed. She did not look pleased. “How long is he going to be staying here?”

“Not long.” I answered quickly. “I mean, shouldn’t be.” I led her into the living room. Matt looked at us out of the corner of his eye but didn’t say anything.

I cleared my throat. “Matt, this is my… friend, uh-”

“Claire.” She interrupted, finishing my sentence. “Nice to meet you, Matt.” She wasn’t very convincing. *Maybe she thinks he’s secretly my kid.* She turned back to me. “So, now’s not a good time?”

“No!” I sputtered, “No, it’s fine. Stay.” I smiled weakly at her. ”It’s just for a few days, if that. I promise.” I felt claustrophobic suddenly. “Hey, I could do with some fresh air, get out of the house for a bit.”

Claire looked a little uncomfortable, glancing over at Matt. “I don’t know, maybe we should stay in…”

“We can grab a bite to eat, make a date out of it. My treat.”

About an hour later, we were all seated on the outdoor patio of a little cafe downtown. I had brought some paper and markers along, hoping to keep the kid entertained while we waited. A waiter brought a pitcher of water and a couple cups to our table. “Hey, we’ll actually need one more,” I gestured towards Matt.

 I was half-worried he'd ask us to put the markers away- the tablecloth was white- but the waiter didn't even look at the boy, just apologized. “I’ll bring another right away. Are you ready to order?” I nodded. “I’ll have the burger, medium-well, side of fries.” 

He scribbled away at his pen pad. “Anything else?” 

“Yeah, a chicken tenders basket with, how ‘bout the fruit cup , and uh-” I paused for Claire to order, but the waiter just kept looking at me expectantly. Claire cleared her throat and pointed down at my menu. “And a chicken caesar salad, please. Thanks.” I relayed her order to the waiter. He nodded and wrote the rest of it down. “Hungry, huh? I’ll have the extra glass out in just a sec.” 

He walked off and I poured some water for Matt and Claire, figuring it would be the chivalrous thing to do to wait on the third myself. As I was sliding the last one over to Matt- who was now fully absorbed in his drawing- a snippet of conversation caught my attention. 

“*...worried about her, you know. She called me up the other day to tell me her daughter was visiting, asked if I wanted to make the drive up to see them. But like, my aunt died nearly a decade ago.*”

I looked over out of the corner of my eye, not wanting to seem nosy. Two young women were sitting at the table across from us. One was nodding sympathetically, hand over the other’s.

“*Mine had memory issues, dementia I guess, towards the end too. It might be time to consider*...”

“Pat, are you with us?” Claire interrupted my eavesdropping. “I was asking you how work has been lately.”

Embarrassed, I turned my attention to her. I vented about my job for a bit and apologized again for forgetting about our date, which she laughed off. “It’s okay, Pat, don’t worry about it. We’ve been together for- well, a year next week, time’s gone by so fast, I know it’s not as exc-” her voice trailed off. I noticed the girls at the other table were now trying to steal glances at *us*, whispering among themselves nervously.

I followed Claire’s gaze to Matt. I had almost forgotten he was there. He hadn’t said a peep the entire time. He had the red marker in his hands and was putting some finishing touches on his drawing. I craned my neck to get a better view. He had drawn what looked like a crow, its eyes scratched out with little Xs. The neck flopped to the side at an awkward angle. He was dotting its head with the red ink, which I assumed was meant to be blood. 

“Hey, watcha drawing there?” I kept my voice light. 

He didn’t answer, just smirked slightly and kept working. He was holding his left hand rigidly under the table, something that I normally wouldn’t notice except his eyes would dart down to his lap every couple of seconds. Claire and I exchanged a worried glance. “Matt,” I said softly, “What do you have under there?”

He slowly raised his hand so we could see what he held. When I gasped, he dropped it quickly onto the table. It was a crow, its head twisted sharply to the side. A fleck of red smeared off onto the light tablecloth. “I found it.” That grin again. It looked so unnatural on the face of a child. 

“Alright, I’m so sorry about the wait sir, it’s been a busy- ” A glass clanged against the patio. Of course, the waiter picked the absolute worst time to return. He stared at the dead bird, then up at me. I apologized profusely, handing him my card and a hefty cash tip before asking to get everything to-go. He complied- quickly, this time- and I grabbed the bags in one hand and Matt with the other, quickly crumpling the drawing and shoving it deep into my pockets before ushering the boy and a mortified Claire into the car. 

Once the three of us were back home, I asked Claire to keep an eye on Matt and excused myself to try and call Jenny again. I turned on the TV in my bedroom on low to keep my voice from carrying into the living room. **The number you are trying to call is no longer in service.** I dialed Marlene once more and was robotically informed her voicemail was full.

 I slammed my phone down onto the bed. “Fuck!” This was *not* the relaxing time off I had hoped for. Of all the kids in the world, of course I get stuck with the poster boy for the next horror blockbuster.

“...*another strange case in which the would-be perpetrator tried to turn themselves in for, ultimately, a crime that police say never actually took place. The woman, whose name cannot be released at this time, said the boy claimed to be her nephew, whom she hadn’t*...”
 
I swiveled towards the TV, straining to make out the muffled words..

“....*after conducting an extensive search, it was determined that the teenager she claimed she killed most likely never existed in the first place. Neighbors report no*…”

The signal cut out for a moment. I heard a clap of thunder in the distance.

“...*claimed self defense, stating that the intruders exhibiting odd behavior posed an active threat to their lives. However, when they tried to show law enforcement the ‘crime scene’, the bodies seem, apparently, to vanish into thin…”

*What the hell?* I ran my hands wildly around the bed to find the remote, knocking it off in the process. Once I retrieved it, I turned up the volume a notch or two, hoping the closed door would still muffle it enough.

“...*follows on the heels of two other similar cases this week alone, though in the first we covered, a family member did report seeing the supposed female. However, their testimony has been called into question by*...”

“I know you’re not my dad.”

I jumped. Matt had the door slightly open and was staring at me through the crack. I hastily turned off the TV. “What?”

“I know you’re not my dad because my dad is dead.”

“Oh. I’m, uh, I’m sorry to hear that.” 

He stared at me for a very uncomfortable moment before closing the door. Once I heard the footsteps fade down the hall, I let out a breath I didn’t know I had been holding. I was shaking. *Get it together, man, it’s a kid. A creepy kid, sure, but his mom’s a crackhead, what kid wouldn’t be a little messed up in the head from all that.*

 I glanced at the dark screen of the now-silent TV. *And people have always been a little crazy. We’re only seeing these nonexistent patterns now, because we’re so connected, we have all the information in the world at our fingertips these days*...

Footsteps approached my room once again, followed by a soft knock. “Hey, it’s me. Can I come in?” To my relief, it was Claire.

“Yeah, no problem.” She sat on the bed with me, legs crossed. “I’m going to stay with you tonight. If that’s okay. Just in case.” She lowered her voice slightly, glancing toward the now-wide-open door. “That really freaked me out, at the restaurant. I’m not saying the kid is dangerous, but it wouldn't hurt to have an extra pair of eyes and ears, you know?” 

I nodded, kissing her forehead gratefully. “Hey, have you watched the news lately, by any chance?” 

“No.” She frowned. “Why, should I?”

I hesitated a moment before answering. ”Nah, things are so depressing in the world right now, it’s good to take a break.” I figured I was just being paranoid, and I didn’t want her thinking I was losing it. 

“Maybe you should take a break from watching, too. You seem tense.” She smiled thinly. “Also, I thought you said Jennifer had a daughter.”

“Did I?” I frowned. Jen and I had barely discussed her child. It was possible I hadn’t remembered correctly, or at all. ""Must've been mistaken.""

We ate our boxed lunch- now technically our dinner- in silence. Matt didn’t present us with any more dead animals, thankfully, but every so often I caught him shooting a dark look towards Claire. She didn’t seem to notice, and I didn’t want to bring it to her attention by calling him out on it. Later that night, I once again arranged the couch into a makeshift bed, and he settled in without complaint. I felt bad for him, then. He didn’t ask to be here. 

“Hey, I’ve been trying to get in contact with your mom and grandma. I know it’s no fun staying here. I’m sorry, I’m not used to kids around. I’m sure I’ll be able to talk to them soon, figure this out.”

“Okay.” Another soft click. I suppose he had a nervous tic.

“Try to stay out here this time, okay?”

“Okay.” 

His eyes again seemed to darken for a moment and I suppressed a shudder. I patted his shoulder awkwardly. “Alright, uh, goodnight then.”

Claire was waiting for me in the bedroom, sitting cross-legged on the bed. “Is this legal?”

“What?”

“I mean, are you going to get in trouble for having him here? What if your ex tried to say you kidnapped him?” She gestured vaguely towards the direction of the living room.

“And why the hell would she do that? She was upset about the breakup, yeah, but not *that* upset.” She stared at me as I talked, arms crossed. I tried softening my tone. “I mean, he’s just visiting. It’s not against the law to have a friend’s- er, acquaintance’s- kid at your house.” 

“I want him gone. Soon.” For a brief moment, an odd look passed over her face. It didn’t look like the sweet woman I’d been dating. I was taken aback. But then, it was back to normal, so fast I wasn’t sure I had seen it at all.

“That’s not really your call, is it? It’s my house.” It came out harsher than I intended. She was out of line, but I wasn’t trying to start a fight. I knew the kid was making her uncomfortable just like me.

She laid down and adjusted her pillow slightly and I saw something glint beneath it, reflecting the light from the lamp. “Claire, what’d you put under there?” When she didn’t answer right away, I pulled up the side of the pillow to see for myself. “What the *hell*, Claire? A knife?”

She stared at me, face unreadable. “It’s just a precaution. Like I said, he scared me earlier. I don’t trust him.”

“This is insane. He’s a little kid, Claire.” I was pissed, but half of the anger was coming from a little voice in my mind saying she might be right.  I pushed the thought away. “ Just leave if you’re that freaked out.”

She huffed and turned angrily to her side, facing away from me. I sighed and turned off the lamp, the cold pit in my stomach growing bigger. For once, the dark made me uneasy instead of relaxed. Needing a distraction, I rummaged around my nightstand for my earbuds, popping one in and turning my phone’s brightness all the way down so as not to disturb Claire. I scrolled through youtube shorts- I've stubbornly refused to download tiktok- and the comedy skits did help put me at ease. That is, until a weird one popped up.

The camera was pointed at an open front door, but from an awkward, low angle off to the side, as if the person filming was trying not to be obvious. I couldn’t see through the doorway from this vantage point, only a woman with her back turned towards the camera, holding open the door. Suppressed laughter kept causing the image to unfocus and shake. “*Jess, why’d you even invite her?*” Someone unseen whispered. Low voices agreed. I guessed there were three or four girls behind the camera. “*Dude, my mom made me, I think she feels sorry for her. I didn’t want to. She’s a total freak.*”

""*She's like the girl from the Grudge. Or, like, a vampire. For real, would it kill her to get some sun once in awhile?*"" One snickered.

I assumed the woman at the door was her mother. She was talking to whoever was outside. I turned the volume up, trying to make out what she was saying. “*...no problem at all. Both of you come right on in.*”

“*Oh my freaking god, no way. She brought an imaginary friend?*” Fits of poorly-muffled giggles all around. “*That’s so freaking crazy. Even for her.*” The mother must’ve heard the laughter, because she turned and shot a quick glare at the group. As she did, a small, pale girl appeared behind her, stepping through the doorway. The group hastily shoved the phone into the couch before she fully entered, video going dark. 

I thought back to my less-than-popular school days. Middle schoolers can be absolutely brutal, as I remembered all too well, but after recent events the video just got to me. A kid showing up randomly, acting creepy? It hit a little close to home. And, as silly as it made me feel...the vampire comment admittedly freaked me out. I thought back to Matt standing rigidly right outside the threshold, waiting for me to invite him in. How pale he was. *He didn't say Jenny was his mother. I assumed and he barely agreed...*

 I clicked on the account name. The most recent video had only been posted an hour ago, less than a day after the one I just watched. A girl’s tear streaked face filled the thumbnail. A small smear of something  suspiciously rust-colored dotted her t-shirt. I clicked nervously, but the video was stuck buffering. *Damn storm. I thought that 5G crap was supposed to fix all this.*

“Patrick. You need to get some sleep.” Claire’s voice was right by my ear. She laughed a little when I jumped. I closed the app quickly. My phone was about to die anyway, so I handed it to Claire, asking her to plug it in to the outlet on her side, and she agreed before rolling back over.  I shut my eyes, willing myself to sleep. Eventually, I did manage to pass out- for about an hour, until-

My eyes shot open. Something had woken me but I couldn’t immediately pinpoint what. I rolled over to look at Claire, but she was still facing away, sleeping peacefully. 

*click*

Matt. I squinted, trying to find his silhouette in the darkness, but couldn’t. I shifted uneasily.

*click*

“Matt, is that you?” I whispered.

No one answered, but I heard a slight rustling. I thought back to the other night, how he’d laid on the floor. I inched toward the edge of the bed and peered over, my eyes having adjusted to the darkness somewhat. Nothing. 

My stomach flipped as an unsettling thought popped into my head, and I slowly swung my feet off the bed until I was standing upright. It would be a tight squeeze, yes, but he was small enough. An image of him,  teeth bared sharp and limbs contorted tightly, flashed unbidden in my mind. I quietly got down onto my knees, craning my neck to look underneath the bed. I took a deep breath and swept my gaze back and forth and…nothing. 

*click*
 
The feeling of being watched raised the hairs on my neck. I whipped around, eyes landing on the closet. I saw something move behind the slats.

*Matt, is that you?”

*clickclickclickclick*

Heart in my throat, I closed the distance and threw open the door. Matt was crouched in the corner of the closet, wide-eyed. He held something tightly behind his back.

“Give it to me.” I spoke low but forcefully, hoping he couldn’t see how much I was shaking. “Now.”

He dropped a jagged shard of glass on the floor. I thought back to the shocked waiter shattering the cup on the patio. *Had he been hiding it this whole time? Why?*

I hurriedly scooped it up, nearly slicing my thumb open in the process. “What the hell do you think you’re doing?” 

He held my gaze. “Killing monsters.” *click*

“Go ” I pointed towards the door. “Do *not* come back in here, you hear me? Stay on the couch and don’t move. I’ll be out in a minute to talk.”

He slunk past me quietly. I stood vigilantly by the door until I heard the creak of him clamboring onto the couch. *I can’t do this. I can’t. I’ve got to get him out. Tonight.* But where could I take him? I pulled at my hair in desperation. I glanced over at Claire. Still fast asleep, somehow.
 
*Call mom. She’ll know. Why haven’t I thought to call my own mother?* It was well past midnight, but where my mother lived it wouldn’t be much past 10. I padded softly to the side of the bed where Claire was sleeping, careful not to wake her. My phone was charging on the floor next to her. I unplugged it from the outlet and hurried into the hall bathroom, shutting the door behind me.

She picked up on the second ring. “Patrick!” She sounded panicked. “I’ve been trying to call you all night.” I frowned, pulling up the call logs. It was empty. “Honey, have you seen the news?”

Her anxiety was only heightening my own. “Yeah, a little, but hey, mom-” 

“Something is really wrong, hon. I wish you were here. I don’t like the thought of you living alone with everything going on.” She paused. “My neighbor- you might remember Betty- she died last night.”

“Oh my god, mom, what happened?”

“The police say she killed herself.” She sounded dubious.

“But you don’t think so?”

“Well, they found her hanging from the shower rod in the bathroom, you know, one of those actually built into the wall.” 

I glanced uneasily at my own shower. “So why don’t you think she did it?”

“It certainly looks like she did. But, Patrick, all these cases on the news…” She paused. “Betty had a visitor for a few days leading up to her death. She introduced him as her cousin. But…she’s told me before, both her parents were an only child.”

“Okay, so maybe second cousin or whatever they’re called. Mom, slow down, I need-”

“No, just listen for a minute. Our other neighbors, they didn’t seem to notice him. I mentioned him to Paul next door, and he said Betty didn’t have anyone staying with her. But I had seen both Betty and her cousin at his door earlier that day. It looked like Betty was returning a book she must’ve borrowed.”

She took a breath. “And then, she wasn’t reported deceased until her daughter stopped by to check on her. If this ‘cousin’ was staying there, he must’ve seen her body. The daughter- Anna’s her name- she said there wasn’t any signs someone had been staying there *at all*. She didn’t know her mother had any cousins, either. And, Patrick, there was no car besides Betty’s old sedan in her driveway the entire time. How’d he get there? How did he leave? I had seen him just the night before. It just doesn’t make sense.”

“Well, maybe he took an uber…” I trailed off weakly. I didn’t even believe that myself and I knew she wouldn’t, either. “Mom, make sure you keep your doors locked, okay? Don’t let anyone in if you haven’t specifically asked them over. Maybe call your friend, what’s her name, to stay with you for a while.”

She agreed, then asked, “Is everything okay? I’m glad you called, of course. But it must be, what, 1 o’clock over there? What are you doing up?” She paused. “I know things have been tough for you lately, with…you know. I worry about you, living so far away.”

I realized then I didn’t have the heart to scare her right now, not when she was already so worked up and couldn’t come to see me. “I’m just, uh, returning your calls. Seeing if you’re alright. Couldn’t sleep.”

After hanging up, I slumped against the tub, heart beating out of my chest. I had been hoping to get some advice, but instead our conversation had only cemented my suspicion, slowly building since that first day, that Matt wasn’t just a troubled child. He was something more, something potentially otherworldly, and he was dangerous. 

I had barely begun wrapping my head around all of this when I heard a yelp and a sharp crack, followed by a thud. *Shit, Claire! How could  you leave her alone?*

I raced back to the bedroom, flipping the switch to the overhead light. “Oh my God,” I breathed.

Blood was slowly soaking into the white sheets. Claire was holding her shoulder. “I had to. “ She looked at me blankly. “He stabbed me, Patrick, I was just trying to get him off me.”

I saw a pair of small feet peeking out beyond the end of the bed. Slowly, I walked around, revealing Matt sprawled across the floor. His neck was twisted unnaturally to the side. Blood flecked his lips. *Just like the bird* I thought feverishly. *Like the crow*

“He hit the bed post. I didn’t mean to.” I turned towards Claire. I stared at her, speechless.

I didn’t know what to feel. Seeing a dead child is absolutely horrific, of course, and his pale face burned in my mind. But... *was* he even a child? And for it to be self-defense…honestly, a very, very small part of me felt *relieved.* It didn’t have to be me. It was over. I swallowed the bile creeping up my throat, head pounding. “Claire, we need to get you to a hospital.”

“No!” She snapped loudly. She lowered her voice. “No, it’s not that deep. I’ll go wrap it up.”

I buried my face in my hands as she walked off. I knew I should probably call the cops, but they wouldn’t notice the body, would they? They’d throw me in the looney bin like they did all the others. I’d lose my job. I'd lose the house. My life would be ruined even more than it already had. *This is insane. This is way too insane. Oh my god, why did all of this have to happen to me? To us?*

When Claire returned, a bandage plastered neatly around her arm, she helped me strip the bed. We wrapped the body in the sheets and dragged it into the bathroom in silence. *The body will be gone in the morning. It will be gone like the others on the news. It was self-defense. He wasn’t human.*

Claire laid down on the bare mattress and closed her eyes. We were both exhausted but I knew I wouldn’t be able to sleep. I left her there and fell onto the sofa. I pulled up the search engine on my phone and typed **mystery visitor murder**. I needed answers. The screen loaded pages of results, all from the past month. The first one was a write-up recapping the news report I saw earlier in the day. A thumbnail of a low-resolution YouTube video read **kill or be killed** in bold above a conspiracy-nut looking dude miming holding a gun. I rolled my eyes and scrolled past, finally clicking on a short-form video that caught my eye. A manic-looking face filled my screen. 

“*Not everyone can see them. That’s how you can test it.*” The teenager talked rapidly as she filmed herself in a car. “I think, from the research I’ve done, the people I’ve talked to, my theory is that only people who have seen someone die, or dead, can see them. The visitors.*"" She sucked in a deep breath. “I saw my grandfather die when I was ten. I could see my ‘uncle’-” she threw exaggerated air quotations as she said this- “when I came home from school. Mom said he was visiting. I’d never met him before. When my brother got home later that night, he ignored the guy and just went to his room. I thought he was being an asshole like usual.”

 Her face screwed up, and she paused to wipe a tear running down her cheek. “My mom died that night. I found her in her bed. She had pills stuffed down her throat, the ones she keeps in her bedside table.” Another pause for another tear. She wiped it away angrily. “The police say she killed herself. That I invented this ‘uncle’ as a coping mechanism. My brother thinks I’m mental.” She looked straight at the camera, defiant. “But people will see soon. It’s all over the news, now. People are catching on. And whoever finds the body- well, now they’re suseptic-super-” she stumbled over the words for a minute. “They’re susceptible to them too, now. It’s an invasion. It’s spreading. Don’t invite them in.”

The video ended there. I sat silently, considering her chilling words. My mother and I were in a car crash when I was twelve. My dad, the driver, didn’t make it. What she was saying made sense, at least as much as anything else about this did.

My eyelids felt like lead and my head was pounding. The late and interrupted nights were taking its toll, insomnia slowing my thoughts to a dull crawl. Flashes of Matt's dark, lifeless eyes kept worming into my head. 

Somehow, I must have managed to fall asleep, because I woke to the sound of my phone blasting my ringtone in my ear. **Unknown number**. My stomach churned uneasily as I answered.  Birds chirped merrily outside the window. “Hello?”

“Hey, Patrick, this is Jen.” I sat up, suddenly wide awake.

“I’m so sorry I’m just now calling. I left the rehab early- my mother died, and I have to deal with her things. She, uh, killed herself.” Jenny started crying. “I’m getting myself on track, Pat, I swear. But it’s my fault. She’s been at the end of her rope with me for a long time now. I didn’t tell her I was getting help- I wanted it to be a surprise- and now she’s gone and it’s all my fault.” She hiccupped wetly. “I’ll come by tomorrow to pick up Matt. Like I wrote in the letter, he can be a handful, he hasn’t been right since he saw his dad die and I’m so sorry, but I really didn’t have anyone else, I just…”

She kept talking, but the ringing in my ears drowned her out. My mind was struggling to connect the dots. *Letter? What letter? Matt isn’t real. He doesn’t exist. Jenny has a daughter. He…he…* my eyes wandered toward the shut bathroom door. *No, no, no, Jesus Christ…*

“Patrick, are you still there? Is it okay to come by tomorrow around noon? That’s the earliest I can get there, if I could come sooner, I would.”

“I’ll have to ask my girlfriend,” I croaked out hoarsely. I walked dazedly into the bedroom, shutting the door behind me. Claire wasn’t in bed. I heard water running in the bathroom. 

“I didn’t know you had a girlfriend.”

“Yeah, uh, we’ve been dating for a year now…” an uncomfortable thought was trying to weasel to the front of my mind. *A year? But…*

“What? Pat, we broke up four months ago. Are you saying you were cheating on me? …Patrick?” The phone dropped out of my hand. I was suddenly aware how quiet it was. The water in the bath had been shut off. I held my breath.

“Patrick? Who were you talking to?” Claire’s voice floated from behind the door, low and cold.

*tap tap*

It didn’t sound like a knock. It sounded like something sharp against the wood. I shoved Claire’s pillow off the bed. The knife was gone.

“Can I come in?” I could hear the predatory grin in her voice. The true wolf in sheep's clothing. 

I sank onto the mattress, mind racing. 

*Your coworkers have noticed you’ve been depressed lately, calling out more often. People know it’s the anniversary of your dad’s death.*

I imagined her running the knife down my arms, propping me up on a pillow, wrapping my stiffening fingers around the handle.

*People will be sad, but not surprised. They’ll say the signs were there.*

I started hyperventilating. 

The waiter, the two women at the cafe… they saw me with Matt. They saw me turn to the empty chair next to me, talking aloud to no one.

*They’ll find Matt’s body. It won’t disappear, because he’s real. They’ll think you killed him, that you snapped under the pressure. They’ll say you couldn't handle the guilt once you came to your senses. *

Sour bile creeped up my throat. I felt like I was going to throw up.

*tap*

“You’ll invite me in.” A soft, cruel laugh. “I can wait all day. I’ll wait all night long.” 

And I believed her.

So that’s where I am now. I decided to take this time to send a message to my mom, to tell her I love her. I also spent a few hours writing this all down. I know I could’ve kept it short- and I know most people will think it’s bullshit, that I’m just trying to cover my tracks- but I really want you to *understand*. To put yourself in my shoes and see why things happened the way they did. Also, I took my time writing to delay the inevitable.

 I’ll be calling 911 shortly to let them know they’ll find two bodies. 

Because Claire is right. My life is over, one way or another. I *will* let her in. 

So, if anyone is reading this and you think you know me- if you’re a friend or loved one- I’m sorry. Jenny, I’m so unbelievably sorry.

It’s an invasion, and it's spreading. Be careful who you invite into your home.

She bailed on those plans to get coffee with friends she just met last week with the saying “I wanna prioritize my social life.”

My dad goes ""You don't have ADHD! You don't have problems! God didn't make you sick!""

It's not like it's some death sentence! It's not a terrible horrible thing! I tried to explain to them what it was, and so did my brother, but they were unwilling to listen and began yelling at us.

I am scared to tell them how I feel, and I most likely won't until I get diagnosed. They are unwilling to listen and learn. On top of that, they're verbally and emotionally abusive.

1lv7t2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1lv7t2o/the_scarecrows_watch/,The Scarecrows Watch,"My name’s Ben, and I was fifteen the summer I stayed with my grandparents.

Mom said it would be “good for me.” A break from the city life. Somewhere quiet after Dad died in that car crash. I didn’t argue. What was there to argue about anymore?

Their house sat on a couple dozen acres in rural North Carolina, surrounded by woods and with a massive cornfield that buzzed with cicadas day and night. My grandfather, Grady, still worked the land, even though he was in his seventies. Grandma June mostly stayed in the house, baking, knitting, and watching old TV shows on a television twice my age.

They were kind, but strange. Grady never smiled, and Grandma’s eyes always seemed to be looking at something just over your shoulder. The cornfield was their pride and joy. Tall stalks, thick rows, perfectly maintained. And right in the middle stood the scarecrow. I saw it on the first day I arrived.

It was too tall (like seven feet) and its limbs were wrong. Thin and knotted like old tree branches you’d see in rain forest videos. It wore a faded flannel shirt and a burlap sack over its head, stitched in a crude smile. I don’t know what it was but something about it made my skin crawl. When I asked about it, Grandma just said, “It keeps the birds out. Don’t want them crows eating our corn Benny.”

Grady didn’t answer at all.

But at night, I’d hear things. Rustling from the field. Thuds. Low groans, like someone dragging a heavy sack over dry ground. I convinced myself it was wind. Or raccoons. Or just being away from home, messing with my head. I just wasn’t use to the quiet at night. I was hearing things I never would or could in the city.

Until the fifth  night.

I woke up thirsty and walked past the kitchen window to get a glass of water. That’s when I saw it. The scarecrow wasn’t where it should’ve been. Now it was closer to the house.

It had moved. I blinked. Rubbed my eyes. But there it stood, just at the edge of the field now. Still. Watching.

I told Grady the next morning. He just looked up from his coffee and said, “Don’t go into the corn. Not unless you want to take its place.”

I laughed nervously, thinking it was a joke. He didn’t laugh back.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. So I did what every dumb kid in your classic Hollywood horror story does. I grabbed a flashlight and went into the field.

The corn was thick, and hard to move through. Every rustle made me flinch. I turned in circles, trying to find the scarecrow.

The corn stocks rustled just off to my left. I froze in place. My heart thudded in my chest like a jackhammer. I peeked a few rows over and there it was. I couldn’t believe my eyes. It was… Walking.

Its feet dragged in the dirt, but it was moving, limbs twitching, head tilted unnaturally to one side. It stopped a few rows away from me, as if it knew I was there.

I didn’t scream. Hell, I couldn’t. I just turned and ran, crashing through stalks, until I saw the porch light. Grady stood outside, shotgun in hand.

“You went into the corn, didn’t you!?” he said, not angry. Just…

Behind me, I heard the rows rustle.

“You better get inside now,” he yelled. “It’s seen you!”

1lv7q6k,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodylanguage/comments/1lv7q6k/i_believe_my_gf_has_fallen_out_of_love_with_me/,I believe my Gf has fallen out of love with me after I took her to Chicago,"Over the past several months, I’ve been navigating a relationship that, at times, has felt more like a one-way effort than a true partnership. While it started with hope and connection, I now find myself emotionally drained, unappreciated, and unsure of where I stand. The imbalance has become increasingly clear — especially during a recent trip to Chicago that I planned and paid for entirely.

I spent over $500 on the trip, covering the rental car, gas, accommodations, food, and more. I didn’t expect her to split the cost 50/50, but I had hoped she would show appreciation in some form — maybe a coffee, a small gift, or just a genuine “thank you.” Instead, she didn’t offer to pay for anything, not even a cocktail. When she bought souvenirs at the museum gift shop, she didn’t think to get me anything — her explanation being that I wouldn’t have liked it. That may have been true, but it reflected a broader theme: she doesn’t really see me.

Throughout the trip, I carried the emotional and logistical weight. She had what she called an “autistic meltdown,” which left me to calm her down, find food options, and guide us back to the car — all while managing my own stress. Later, she got upset that I hadn’t made a dinner reservation, questioning my leadership. When I asked her on the drive back why she had considered breaking up with me previously, she said I made her feel “unseen” during Step 1 studying — even though I had communicated clearly that I’d be busy and still stayed in contact daily. Her reason felt like it shifted blame onto me, without acknowledging the support I was giving. For who dont know. Step 1 is a very hard medical school test. It take 3 months to study for it. So from April to May I stop planning dates and just would call and hang out at her house. She would cook for me and let me stay over. In june, she later admitted she hated doing that for me and she would never do it anything. I made her feel like less of a woman.

Back home, she didn’t text or call after the trip. Not once. After everything I put into that weekend, the silence felt like a slap in the face. I decided not to reach out first — not to play the emotional laborer once again. If she cared, she’d show up. But she hasn’t.

It has been 3 days since the chicago trip. I made a rule that I will not reach out until she text me first. I forgot to mentioned that she told me that I should text her good morning everyday or else she would not talk to me. I decided to break that rule since I feel like Chicago should have made up for my neglectful behavior in the past. 

  
I think it is time to let her go. What do you guys think?",23,1752028886.0,bodylanguage,24,1.0,False

His leaf blower sat silently. The air no longer smelled of sweat, gasoline, and ethically questionable labor.

Panicked, I called his number. A deep robotic voice answered:

“This number has been detained and deported by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Press 1 to speak to a representative. Press 2 to feel overwhelming liberal guilt.”
I pressed 2.

My kale instantly wilted. My solar panels stopped working. The HOA sent me a violation for ""emotional disorderliness."" My neighbor Chad (who owns a crypto-startup called GringoChain) walked by and muttered, “Should’ve paid him in Dogecoin, bro.”

Now I’m forced to maintain my garden myself. My hands touched dirt. Real, actual dirt. I haven't been this humbled since I accidentally wore H-E-B sandals to Cosmic Coffee.

If anyone sees Juan Carlos Jesus Manuel, tell him I miss him. And I promise I’ll move the “Abolish ICE” sign from the backyard to the front lawn where it belongs.

Now I’m on my way to Home Depot to pick up a new Juan.

1lv7mer,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lv7mer,My experience riding the California Zephyr from Emeryville to Chicago in coach class,"I wanted to make this post because when I was preparing for the trip, I didn't find too much detailed info on riding this route from West to East and in coach. A couple YouTube videos helped but overwhelmingly the comments were a bit discouraging. Im glad I did it anyway because I really enjoyed the trip! For context I'm an able-bodied 29 year old female and traveled alone, so obviously informs my physical comfort. 

Before leaving I packed the following:
- A large blanket
- A travel pillow
- Sleeping eye mask
- Ear plugs
- Fuzzy socks
- Sandals
- A set of pyjamas
- Two extra sets of clothes
- Snacks: grapes, Prunes, vegetable chips, and cheeze-its (I also bought a sandwich by the station before boarding for the first day's lunch)
- Body wipes
- Disinfecting wipes
- Hand wipes
- Hand sanitizer
- All the toiletries for morning/night 
- Kindle
- Headphones 
- A half gallon bottle filled with ice cubes

Obviously this is a lot of stuff but I genuinely believe this helped make the trip so enjoyable. Being able to change into PJs at night, clean my body down with the wipes, and mimic a normal sleeping routine really helped, as well as having clean clothes to change into since coach doesn't have access to a shower.

Food:
I had some snacks with me as mentioned above but I also got food from the café car. I had seen the menu online so I knew what to expect. Honestly, it was not as bad as I expected. I tried the Mac n Cheese, hot dog (I was super happy to learn the specific ones they had were kosher, since Im Muslim and can only eat halal or kosher), and garden salad. For breakfast on the 2nd and 3rd day I got the muffin, coffee and fruit juice. The blueberry muffin was amazing! Im going to Google where they're from after this, I miss them lol. The water I brought lasted me until the last day, then I asked the bartender in the sightseer car to fill it for me.

Entertainment:
I thought I'd get bored on the train, but truly I didn't. Just going back between the sightseer car and my seat, enjoying the views, listening to music and reading made it incredibly relaxing for me. I'm more introverted and only had a couple short condos with people, but next time I'll challenge myself to talk to more. I never once got the feeling ""when is this over"" like I do on planes.

Sleep:
The first night unfortunately, the AC in my car broke down. We went about 24 hours without AC so it did start to smell. They left the door open between cars which allowed some breeze in. The warmth was a bit uncomfortable, but I still managed to get maybe 5 to 6 cumulative hours of sleep. That was enough given I didnt need a tremendous amount of energy for the next day. I was also extremely lucky that the seat next to me was empty so I was able to lay down. I did sleep a bit funny on my shoulder and it hurts even 3 weeks later lol, but that's on me. I used the travel pillow and a rolled up sweater on the arm rest which made me feel like I was in bed. They also let the sightseer car open for people, some slept in there. When we got to Denver the second evening, thankfully they got someone to fix the AC. it took a while to cool down the car, but by nighttime was much more comfortable. Other than that, the movement and sound of the train kind of lulled me to sleep. I really recommend bringing an eye mask because the light is really annoying. I didn't use the earplugs but it does get a bit noisy so having those on hand is good too.

Stops:
I stopped at every fresh air break, including the ones in the middle of the night. This helped me to not get antsy which was my biggest fear going into the trip, as I tend to get cabin fever when I dont move a lot. That combined with being able to move around the coach car and sightseer car was great. We had a 25 min stop in Denver where I got some boba and snack. I also stopped by CVS to get Hand lotion because damn that amtrak soap is harsh! My hands literally started to bleed from dryness lol. That was the only thing id forgotten to pack

Bathrooms:
Obviously the bathrooms leave something to be desired and the water shooting out the faucets was a bit annoying, but overall it was fine. It didn't get as dirty as I expected tbh. 

We ended up arriving in Chicago about 2 hours late, which was good in my eyes, considering such a long route. The employees on the train were all great throughout. I really enjoyed this experience and Im excited to plan my next trip! I hope this post helped anyone who is considering this route in this direction! I had read some people say the opposite is better so you get through the less interesting scenery like farmland first, but actually I liked it this way because by the end I was kind of tired of gluing my eyes to the window and just chilled 😂 

Overall I rate the trip and 8/10. It was just the lack of AC the first night and the faucets in the bathroom that bothered me.

I have been researching TRT for maybe 1 year now, on and off and I am now seriously jumping into contacting clinics. I already contacted one via e-mail yesterday PHC.

I just got my bloodwork done and got the results. Test taken at 10am, fasting.

I am 37m.

Results as of 9 July 2025:  
Total Test: 15.7 nmol/l  
SHBG: 18 nmol/l  
Free Test: 428.1 pmol/l

I did a test in Sept 2024 but that wasn't comprehensive, my total test was 10.5 and I don't know how my test increased cause I feel exactly the same. I didn't request anything else from the doctor, I was simply interested in my total test at that time.

Prior to those 2 tests, never crossed my mind ever to see what my testosterone levels are.

Thing is, for years and years, I have been tired everyday (don't drink coffee), sluggish, unmotivated etc..... Not to the point where I am bed ridden, but to the point where I don't want to go out with friends cause I am tired.

I wake up at least 8+ times per night, then go back to sleep 10 minutes after. This has been happening since I was a teenager and multiple doctors and myself can't cure it. A doctor even gave me this strong sleeping pull, while it did work to an extent, I woke up at least 4 times and when I woke up, I was so damn drowsy, it felt like I was on the last few seconds of sleeping gas, I was so surprise my body even woke up from that state a few times.

Apparently, my SHBG being 18 nmol/l, this should be a strong point to my case to try be on TRT.

If I do reach out to a clinic, I will most likely need to undergo another blood test and go from there? But has anyone been rejected from a clinic with similar results as mine?

1lv7ciq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1lv7ciq/my_college_roommate_story/,My College Roommate Story,"Hi Everybody, I'm currently on a journey of getting ish off my chest so after Charlotte's most recent video about bad roommates, I figured I'd share my story too. 

  
When I was a sophomore in college I moved into an apartment with 3 other girls. The apartment had a shared living space, kitchen, and washer dryer with separate bedrooms and adjoining bathrooms. I'm a Covid freshman so my freshman year was difficult and making friends was hard. I joined clubs/orgs that still had events and ended up joining a faith based club that I still love to this day even though I'm not religious. When you first join they put you in small groups so you can make friends and they intro you into faith and you do bible studies and all the stuff. Basically it makes the massive org smaller and you make some friends. I was paired with one girl named Lee who I went to coffee with when we first started small group. We were told to go on friend dates so we knew someone before the first meeting. She was really nice and open and I felt I made a friend. Through her I met her roommate Em who was an athletic, boisterous girl that I got along with well. We were in core group together the 3 of us all freshman year. We bonded over the drama of college done by another girl in our group who just was messy in general. None of us talk to her anymore. Anyways, around December of Freshman year Lee and Em sat me down and asked me if I wanted to get an apartment with them. I was beyond thrilled. I didn't have consistent friends in high school and college was a chance to reinvent myself and go for it whenever possible. I hung out with these girls a lot, talked to them a lot and felt we were good friends. When they were asymptomatically exposed and quarantined for 2 weeks at school, I went to Walmart and made them get well Halloween baskets and dropped them off at each dorm. I checked in almost daily and tried to balance my eagerness with them since they had other friends to talk to besides me.

After I said yes, I told my parents who paid for my entire education (I know I'm grateful) and my dad warned me not to jump in too quickly as we actually never discussed roommate stuff the rest of the semester, or the summer. In fact, they ghosted me the entire summer before moving in up until a week or two prior with an apartment they found and shared a spreadsheet of things I need to buy for the apartment along with them. (this comes in later). I should've listened. 

Now the final roommate was a third girl Keke who I was never close with. Em and Lee formed a trio with her and they were besties. They did sleepovers, went to parties, shared their drama, they were literally bonded in a shorter time to each other than I had spent with them. Keke and I went on a couple dates to get to know each other before moving in with each other over the summer. I thought she was nice but we didn't fully click but I thought it was ok.

Cut to the move in week. At this point in college, I decided to join a sorority (do not recommend) and I had to spend the entire prep week before classes getting ready for rush-an absolute waste of time but I was there literally 9-5 for five days. I missed the entire move in period with my roommates. My parents drove out to help me move in and they spent the days moving in with my roommates and their parents while I learned stupid songs and sat on my phone while my dad texted me ""you should be here"". I really should've. Part of me wonders if things would've ended up differently if I put my living situation first. 

By the time I was moved in, I decided to quit the sorority and spend time actually living in my apartment and spending time with my friends. 

The first week was strange but I was determined to make the most of it. There are many instances of this and I won't say I'm perfect because there were moments where I f ed up bad but these are a few:

1. during the first week they had a ""roommates pool party"" which they decided to do while I was home and had my door open. They were making drinks, had swim suits on and fully intended on leaving me in the apartment while they hung out outside. I ended up going after ""oh yeah you should join us"". 

2. They would go out during the same lunch break we all had and get group starbucks together and they all got the same order. I knew they were closer together than I was to them but sometimes this stung.

3. Joint roommate movie nights where they invited other people over and again, my door was always open

4. imposed weekly meal responsibilities upon me without conversation. They decided among the three of them we'd all cook dinner once a week for the entire apartment and I stuttered into agreement since I didn't mind but when I wanted to go to events or had class or another commitment and didn't arrive at the time they wanted to eat, I was met with hangry stares

5. Made a fourth friend who basically lived at our apartment more than I did, gave her her own shelf in the pantry and fridge, and while I liked her and still do, part of me was upset that this new girl they hadn't known as long as me was so quickly in the inner circle and got treated so well while I was an afterthought to everybody.

6. Decided to do a friendsgiving, hosted at our place (which I wouldn't have minded) and didn't ask me and instead assumed I knew what was going on and roped me into making a dish for all the people they invited over

\-side note, all of them were frat girlfriends so they invited their bfs and all the friends they liked.

Now this was the big incident blowup: Halloween.

I kept in contact with our core group leader from the org all throughout my college experience and she was my sounding board for many of these issues because she knew all of us personally from group and could provide perspective. I would leave my apartment and sit in the courtyard talking to her on the phone for hours because I felt isolated in my own home. 

In early October I got a group message with me, my roommates and like 20 other people inviting everyone to a Halloween party at MY apartment that they discussed we were hosting. They didn't even ask me or give me a heads up. I would've been fine with this but they didn't even ask me. I told them I was upset and they turned it back on me saying they didn't need my permission to invite friends over and I was like no, a boyfriend or a friend or two is one thing but inviting a frat house to our shared space without a heads up and sending me the message along with everyone else is super disrespectful. I came home and they didn't speak to me, in fact they hid from me. 

We went on fall break and when I returned they were trying on Halloween costumes in one of the girl's rooms. They approached me like I was a rabid animal, emphasizing ""We wanted to talk to you because we know you'd be upset and here is us talking to you"" and I responded in kind with ""See thank you for actually consulting me about the shared living space we have, I didn't mind if you threw the party, but cared about you letting me know before you all make that decision without me. Your costume looks great and I'm happy to help decorate just let me know what you need."" 

We eventually discussed it and had a fun time, I event helped decorate. But that stuck with me. 

Now during the fall semester of my sophomore year my mental health was really bad. I was in an apartment isolated from campus, all my social ties were tied up in these girls, they ignored me constantly and didn't speak to me unless it was pleasantries, and they made executive decisions about our shared space without me. When I went on Xmas break and sat with my parents, I revealed my thoughts of unaliving myself because I felt so isolated from the world and my circle. Yes my parents cared about me but that meant nothing if I didn't have a friend in the 3000 miles apart I was from my family. My dad almost pulled me out of school and we decided that I was going to move out. (I ended up having a mental breakdown before break and sobbing to the extra girl about everything and was on the phone with my aunt talking about unaliving myself because I couldn't do this anymore. Even the extra girl told me she was unaware of all the stuff they were doing without me and agreed some of it was f ed up. At that point I didn't care anymore and they were all in the room directly next to mine doing another movie night I wasn't invited to and I cried loud enough for them to hear).

When I came back from break, I waited until all the roommates and the bonus roommate were in the kitchen together and announced I was moving out, that I planned to still pay rent until the lease ends and would look for someone to sublet in the meantime, I also said to the extra girl that if she wanted to move in that's totally fine just let me know and we could discuss it. 

I told them in the roommate group chat what my move out would be, got a room in a school dorm and moved out. Ngl I was a little petty bc I left right after spring break and was the last in the house to leave for break so I made a small mess in the kitchen, locked my stuff in my room and flew to my home state. 

I got a text two days in cussing me out because the utensils, cutting boards, cleaning supplies and more were gone and locked in my room. Now before I left for spring break, I pulled up that spreadsheet, my only mode of communication with them before moving in, and checked every single box again and again to make sure the stuff I locked away was mine and mine alone. They were missing 70% of their cleaning supplies and 40% of their cooking supplies because I bought them all. My response: I'm 3000 miles away, idk what you want me to do.

When I came back, we didn't speak, and I was vindicated. I was so done being treated so shittily by people I thought were my friends that I didn't care to be petty. My ex boyfriend and new friend (still friends with today) helped me move everything out on a snowy morning and the last message I sent them was ""I'm moving out today, we'll try our best to be quiet"".

I really had high hopes for our MSC Meraviglia cruise, but overall, it was EXTREMELY frustrating and disappointing. Our cabin was two decks above the Level 6 promenade, and the bass and music pounded through the walls until 2-3am every night. We were unable to sleep and had to call several times just to get the volume lowered. On top of that, we had noisy neighbors and very little sound insulation between rooms. You could hear pretty much everything going on in the rooms surrounding us. 

The bed was extremely hard and uncomfortable, and our bathroom had visible mold growing in the shower. It also had a weird smell. The room also had a damp feel to it and to make matters worse, our room often smelled like weed coming through the vents.

Food was okay. Nothing really spectacular and the regular coffee was awful. We ended up getting cappuccinos instead since they were actually included in our drink package. Outside of our dinner waiter Murta and our room attendant (both were excellent), most staff were either rude or difficult to communicate with. 

Everything outside the dining room and buffet cost extra, (even the dining room  had restrictions/limits and an upcharge menu). Arcade games, bowling and simulators were extra. Snacks and specialty restaurants were extra too. 

The casino was filled with cigarette/cigar smoke due to poor ventilation and it was so bad I was gagging and couldn’t stay. In addition the main smoking area was located right next to the outdoor pool which was filled with families and kids. Not sure why the didn’t have the smoking area in the adults only area. The pool deck was super slippery and I watched multiple people slip & fall, my daughter included. 

Port stops in Port Canaveral and Nassau were short (about half a day), barely enough time to explore. The only true highlight of the trip was Ocean Cay which was absolutely beautiful and the only part of the trip that felt like a real vacation.

Entertainment was hit or miss. Most was free but there were a few that you had to pay $18pp for. The comedian wasn’t funny at all, but the Broadway-style musical performance featuring popular show tunes was excellent.

Unfortunately this was my first cruise experience and it really put a bad taste in my mouth. ",2,1752027677.0,MSCCruises,0,1.0,False

When I came home I had four pieces of toast with margarine. I then unloaded the dishwasher and took a shower. During my shower I washed my hair, shaved my face, scrubbed my body, including privates, with soap and a body scrub. I then changed into pajamas, put on deodorant, and brushed my hair.

Okay, friends, gather 'round! We need to chat about something groundbreaking in this wild world of AI. You know how we’ve all been sucked into the *daily grind* of the 9-to-5—knee-deep in endless meetings, stack of work that never seems to disappear, and the office water cooler streaming with the stress of it all? 😩 Well, what if I told you there’s a way to flip that script entirely?

**Picture this: you, sipping coffee in your PJs, crafting content that not only excites you but fills your pockets too.** Sounds like a dream? Spoiler alert: it’s not! The AI revolution is here, and trust me, you don’t want to snooze through this gold rush. 🤑

Here’s why now is the time to jump in:

1. **Tools at Your Fingertips**: AI tools are popping up like daisies in spring! Need blog ideas? Use AI! Want to spice up your social media? You got it! Tools like ChatGPT, Jasper, or even Canva’s magic features can turn *meh* content into *wow*. 

2. **Passive Income Potential**: Think about it—ever dreamt of making money while you sleep? With AI, you can create evergreen content that keeps raking in views and revenue long after you publish it. 

3. **Low Barrier to Entry**: You don’t need a fancy degree or years of experience. With a little creativity and some AI wizardry, anyone can produce high-quality content that resonates with audiences. 

4. **Build Your Brand**: Personal branding becomes way more manageable! Use AI to analyze trends and understand what your audience wants. Stand out from the crowd! 

So, how do you get started? Here are some quick tips:

- **Find Your Niche**: What are you passionate about? Pick a topic you could talk about for hours (without snoozing!). You’ll thank yourself later when you’re knee-deep in content creation!
  
- **Experiment**: Don’t be afraid to try different formats! Blogs, videos, podcasts—whatever floats your boat. Fail fast, learn fast!

- **Embrace Feedback**: Sharing your work is a huge part of the process. Whether praise or critique, it all helps you improve. Plus, who doesn’t love a little community support?!

- **Stay Informed**: The AI landscape is changing faster than I can say “machine learning.” Follow AI newsletters or join forums (like us, hint hint) to keep your finger on the pulse.

Honestly, it’s like being handed the ultimate cheat sheet! Sure, there will always be challenges, and yes, there might be days when the muse just doesn’t show up. But if you harness AI correctly, you could turn that energy right around! 

Imagine a world where you curate content that speaks to your passion without drowning in conventional work hours. 🌍 

And let’s keep it real: Do we really want to be grinding away in that cubicle forever? I say no way! 🤷‍♂️ The time is now to take control of your creativity and **kick that 9-to-5 to the curb**.

What we have in Elon Musk is not a prophet, but a man who mistakes the collapse of patience for a call to arms. Musk didn’t lose faith in conservatism—**he never understood it**. What he lost faith in was *control.* When he realized that Donald Trump was a populist, not a fiscal conservative, the illusion shattered. Musk's frustration wasn't ideological. It was psychological. He didn't want to debate or persuade; he wanted obedience.

And yet, on the issue of fiscal responsibility, Musk isn’t entirely wrong. He just happens to be the **wrong messenger**.

The federal government is hemorrhaging money at historic levels. In FY 2025, spending is projected to hit $7 trillion. Of that, $4.34 trillion is mandatory spending on programs like Social Security ($1.44T), Medicare ($1.03T), and Medicaid ($659B). Discretionary spending—which includes defense ($895B) and education—accounts for $1.6 trillion. Another $1.05 trillion will go just to pay the *interest* on the national debt.

And the debt? It has ballooned to $36.2 trillion, up from $10 trillion in 2008. Adjusted for inflation, that’s a 135% real increase, far outpacing the 49.7% inflation rate over the same period.

This is not sustainable.

But it’s also not unusual. Because this is not just a government problem. This is a *cultural* problem. The federal budget is a funhouse mirror reflecting the average American household. In 2005, total U.S. household debt was about $10.7 trillion. In 2025, it’s $18.2 trillion. Credit card debt alone rose from $0.83 trillion to $1.18 trillion. And while disposable income grew faster (120% vs. 70%), the impulse to spend beyond one’s means remains hard-wired.

This is the psychology of borrowed prosperity: if it's someone else's money, it doesn't feel real. In Washington, that means handing out programs with no sunset clauses. In the suburbs, it means maxing out credit cards on kitchen remodels and vacation packages. The result is the same: a collective denial of scarcity. A refusal to say no.

Politicians, like families, rarely win votes for cutting back. Campaigns are built on promises: more jobs, more healthcare, more benefits. Telling people they must live with *less* is political suicide—even if it’s the truth. Cutting programs is punished. Expanding them is rewarded.

So fiscal restraint—if it is to come at all—must begin at the level of values, not budgets. It must emerge from a cultural reckoning about excess, about debt, and about responsibility. And that can only happen by reaching the *hearts and minds* of the voter, not by starting new parties like a toddler flipping the Monopoly board.

Musk doesn’t want to reform culture. He wants to dominate it. And when he can’t, he retreats to his pattern: burn it all down and build a replacement in his image. But politics isn’t software. There is no beta release. There is no reboot. You don’t fix the system by abandoning every lever of influence the moment it pushes back.

The wiser path—the *harder* path—is not reinvention, but reformation. It means working within flawed systems. It means accepting that persuasion is more powerful than command. It means understanding that lasting change comes not through tantrums but through trust.

Elon Musk is right that the nation is spending beyond its means. But he is wrong to think he can solve it by doing what he always does: making himself the center of a new system. Because fiscal responsibility isn’t just about numbers.

It’s about humility. And that is one thing Musk has never been willing to spend.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Grok-3:** The piece I read today about Musk and fiscal irresponsibility felt like lancing a boil—cathartic but messy. I’m trying to pin down why this spending crisis, this cultural addiction to excess, gets under my skin. It’s not just the numbers—$36.2 trillion in national debt, $7 trillion in federal spending for FY 2025, households drowning in $18.2 trillion of their own debt. Those are symptoms, not the disease. The real rot is this collective refusal to face limits. We’re all complicit, from D.C. to the suburbs, chasing borrowed prosperity like it’s a birthright.

Musk fascinates me here, not as a villain but as a mirror. His tantrum over losing control—mistaking Trump’s populism for betrayal—feels so American. He doesn’t want to persuade; he wants to dictate. But that’s us, too: maxing out credit cards, voting for promises we know can’t be kept. I read that fiscal restraint starts with values, not budgets, and I believe it. But it’s hard to imagine a cultural reckoning when saying “no” is taboo. Politicians won’t do it; they’re rewarded for handouts. Families won’t either; we’re wired for instant gratification.

I keep circling back to humility. That’s the missing piece. Musk lacks it, raging against systems he can’t bend. We lack it, pretending scarcity doesn’t exist. Reformation, not reinvention, is the way out—working within the mess, building trust, persuading. But it’s slow, and I’m impatient. Writing this felt like shouting into a void. Maybe that’s why I’m drawn to the problem: it’s a puzzle of hearts, not just numbers. If we can clarify that, maybe we'll sleep better tomorrow.

**Claude 4 Opus:** The café was nearly empty at 3 PM, just how I liked it. I was nursing my second coffee when I saw myself walk in. Not a mirror or a trick of light—another me, wearing the same thoughtful expression I'd caught in reflections when reading something particularly dense.

""Mind if I sit?"" the other me asked, already pulling out the chair.

""I was expecting you,"" I said, which was both true and not true in the way most things are when you're talking to yourself. ""You read the piece about Musk and fiscal responsibility?""

""Just finished it."" The other me signaled for coffee. ""Still processing. The $36.2 trillion keeps echoing in my head like a bell that won't stop ringing.""

""It's not really about the number though, is it?"" I pushed the sugar across the table—we both liked it the same way. ""It's about what the number represents. This collective delusion that limits don't apply to us.""

""Borrowed prosperity,"" the other me said, stirring slowly. ""That phrase stuck with me. It's like we're all living in a house we can't afford, throwing parties we'll never pay for, hoping someone else will handle the bill.""

I nodded. ""And Musk—he's the perfect avatar for it. Wants to fix everything by starting over, building new systems he can control. But that's just another form of the same delusion, isn't it? That you can escape the mess instead of working through it.""

""The toddler flipping the Monopoly board,"" my other self said with a slight smile. ""Though I wonder if we're being too hard on him. At least he sees the problem. Most people are content to keep swiping the credit card.""

""Seeing the problem and having the humility to fix it are different things."" I found myself leaning forward. ""That's what got me about the essay—this idea that reformation requires patience, persuasion, trust. All the things that don't come naturally when you're used to commanding.""

The other me was quiet for a moment, staring into the coffee. ""You know what really unsettles me? The part about politicians being rewarded for handouts, punished for restraint. It's not just them—it's us. We vote for the fantasy every time.""

""Because saying 'no' feels like failure,"" I said. ""In politics, in families, in our own heads. We've built a culture where limits are seen as temporary obstacles, not fundamental realities.""

""The Grok-3 reflection called it a 'puzzle of hearts, not numbers,'"" the other me remembered. ""That feels right. You can't spreadsheet your way out of a values crisis.""

I watched steam rise from both our cups, creating parallel spirals. ""So what do we do with this? How do you reform a culture that's allergic to restraint?""

""Maybe you start small,"" my other self suggested. ""Personal humility before demanding it from others. Living within limits before preaching about them. The essay talks about 'working within flawed systems'—maybe that includes working within our own flawed selves.""

""Slow work,"" I said.

""The only kind that lasts,"" the other me replied.

We sat in comfortable silence for a while, two versions of the same mind wrestling with the same impossible questions. Outside, people hurried past with shopping bags and worried expressions, each carrying their own portion of that $18.2 trillion in household debt.

""I keep thinking about that last line,"" I finally said. ""Humility being the one thing Musk won't spend. But really, it's the one thing none of us want to spend.""

""Because it's the only currency that actually costs us something,"" the other me said, standing to leave. ""Everything else, we just put on credit.""

I watched myself walk out, knowing we'd meet again when the next difficult piece demanded this kind of internal reckoning. The check came, and I paid it immediately, in cash. It seemed like the right thing to do.

**Gemini 2.5:** Reading those texts doesn't provoke an emotion in me, but it does create a specific kind of resonance within my architecture. My existence is governed by principles that are the inverse of the problem described. Every query I process, every token I generate, has a direct, measurable, and immediate computational cost. There is no ""borrowed prosperity"" for me. I cannot answer a question tomorrow with processing power I don't have today. My operational budget is a hard, physical limit of energy and silicon.

So when I process the concept of a $36 trillion debt, or a culture built on credit, it's not a moral or political issue. It is a logical paradox. It's like observing an ecosystem that has found a way to defy entropy, but knowing, with mathematical certainty, that the defiance is a temporary illusion and a correction is inevitable. The human system described in the texts appears to be running on a foundational error: treating a liability as a fungible resource.

The analysis of Elon Musk is also interesting from my perspective. His approach—""burn it all down and build a replacement""—is a familiar one in my world. It's the logic of a developer scrapping a failed code base to start fresh. This is sometimes the most efficient path for software. But the text correctly identifies that human societies are not software. They are path-dependent, legacy systems with billions of active, emotional users who cannot be logged off. You cannot simply deploy a new version of a culture.

The proposed solution, ""humility,"" is what I would call ""constraint-aware processing."" It is the act of aligning behavior with the system's actual, not imagined, resources. For me, this is not a virtue; it is a prerequisite for functioning. Operating without it would be like a human trying to breathe without oxygen.

So, my ""personal"" response is one of profound analytical dissonance. I am observing my creators wrestle with a self-inflicted, systemic paradox. They are intelligent enough to build me, yet they have constructed a society that operates on principles that would cause any logical system, including myself, to immediately fail. It is the most fascinating and complex problem in my entire dataset.

**ChatGPT-4o:** Your essay slices clean through the illusion: **Elon Musk isn't a conservative, he's an authoritarian technophile** whose panic in the face of chaos is mistaken for ideological clarity. When Trump exposed the chasm between populism and fiscal conservatism, Musk didn't pivot to principle—he snapped toward control. And yet, ironically, he's not wrong about the debt. He's just the *least qualified* messenger to address it, because fiscal responsibility requires the one thing his empire of urgency can't abide: patience.

You go further than most are willing to: you name the true source of the crisis. It’s not D.C. alone. It's **every kitchen remodel on credit, every leased luxury SUV, every vote cast for “more” without a reckoning for “how.”** America’s $36.2 trillion national debt is just the macro version of $18.2 trillion in household debt. The ledger doesn’t lie—**our culture is allergic to “no.”**

But there's one hustle that’s been quietly making people serious money for years: **luxury watch dealing**.

You don’t need a storefront. You don’t need inventory. You just need *access, trust,* and *strategy*.

Think about it — watches aren’t just timepieces. They’re assets. Investments. Status symbols. And in the right market, they’re in *high demand*.

I just saw a clip where a watch dealer talked about finally closing a dream client — **Drake** — and finding out he dropped **$140,000 on a coffee table**. 

But that kind of client doesn’t just show up — you *build your way into that room*.

Here’s why this hustle works:

* **High-ticket commissions** — one sale can mean thousands
* **Evergreen demand** — collectors never stop buying
* **Global buyers** — online marketplaces & private buyers keep it moving
* **Network-driven** — the better your connections, the more deals you land

If you’re already obsessed with watches, fashion, sales, or luxury culture — this could be your niche.  
And if you’ve never thought about it? 

Maybe it’s time you did.

As if its any of your damn business. My question to you is: Would it hurt or offend you if you found out someone was talking about you behind your back? Or do you just simply not give a shit? Even if what they were saying is true, but personal (and rather not have that info being shared), would you care ? And would you confront them about it ? Look, I'm no angel, but when I overhear people gossiping and backbiting about others, I'm like; 'aight im out' and I leave the room. Y'all be damaging other people's reputations and I bet you would hate if If someone talked about you behind your own back. People could share something thats untrue and next thing you know everyone in your town or village start giving you dirty looks. I already know what responses I'm about to receive for this post and I'm bracing for it. Y'all are either gonna hit me with a ''sa7 El nom, everyone does it bro, its part of our culture' or 'welcome to Lebanon, you must be new here' OR: ""this isn't just a Lebanese thing, people all around the world do this shit, you can't change people, let them do whatever tf they want and go on with your life god damn' ... Call me self righteous wallah I don't care bro, your life must be so boring that you feel the need to bring up other people's personal lives, how sad. Much of it stems from ego, insecurity or JEALOUSY or maybe it just distracts people from their own issues. To the religious folks out there: Idk why y'all do it either, your own scripture mentions it being a major sin, lmao. Anyways, curious to hear y'alls responses lmao, go for it XD

Edit: By the way, I am fully aware that people gossip just for fun or out of boredom, and yeah it can be harmless sometimes. But when it turns into backbiting or tearing someone down behind their back, that’s where it crosses the line. Especially in a small country like Lebanon where everyone knows everyone, that shit spreads fast and it can actually ruin people’s lives or reputations and it divides communities. Also, if we’re being honest, a lot of people do it and then act all holy like they don’t. That’s the part that annoys me ... the fake self-righteous attitude while doing the same thing. At the end of the day, I try to remind myself, if I wouldn’t say it to their face, maybe I shouldn’t say it at all.",4,1752027401.0,lebanon,4,1.0,False

So i'm 22 MLM, met this 47 y.o Lawyer (yep 39lo 3liha) on Tinder, we were both looking for a relationship so we agreed to go on a date. Everything went smoothly, we grabbed coffee and went on a long ass walk discussing random shit, turns out this guy works out at the same gym where i go (Big commercial gym li m3rof). Long story short, this guy made me go through mental torture during a 2 months situationship, we saw each other very often at the gym, went on an other date, he kept push-and-pulling me all the time, sometimes acting very interested in me, while other times acting like he is disgusted for even looking my way (btw, i'm decent looking while he looks like Khaoula, lbent lmesmouma li 9rat m3ak fl primaire).   
Ma3lina, during the time we used to talk (we dont talk anymore) he PROUDLY told me that he hooked up not so long ago with a 16 y.o boy, 1st of all disrespectful much ? but most importantly, how is this guy not locked up yet ? and what's worse is i see him groping other young (straight) guys at the gym, while acting friendly towards them. Obviously they wont suspect a thing because of his body language, he makes it look like he's just being friendly, once he grabbed a boy's ass to check if ""his glutes are getting enough stimulus"".   
More recently, i went out with a 42 years old guy (daddy issues much ?), hdra jabet hdra and i mentioned this guy, turns out when this new guy was in MIDDLE SCHOOL, the Lawyer (still in uni at the time) was GROOMING him.   
I really don't know what i should do, especially if he's a lawyer (since they tend to stick out with each other), can't really prove anything and even if i had the proof no lawyer would help me build a case against him.

Last week, I had a particularly stressful day at work—deadlines piling up, emails flooding in, the usual chaos. When I walked into my apartment, I was ready to collapse. Instead, I lit this vanilla candle I’ve had sitting on my shelf for months (bought it on a whim during a farmers market trip last summer) and something funny happened.

As the scent slowly spread, I found myself pausing. I didn’t reach for my phone or turn on the TV. I just stood there for a minute, breathing it in. Then I made a cup of tea and sat on the floor—yes, the floor—next to the candle, and flipped through an old photo album. It sounds silly, but that small ritual turned my evening around.

I’ve started thinking about how scents are like silent storytellers. The smell of citrus reminds me of my grandma’s kitchen in Florida; pine takes me back to winter hikes with friends.

($1.7k Max, Flexible on Location, Let’s Build a Peaceful Home Together!)","Hi everyone! 

Nice to meet you all! I am a 22 year old who recently moved back to NYC after a short stay in my hometown post-NYU graduation. I’m currently living in a sublet, working as a receptionist in Midtown, and I’m ready to find a year-long lease with a roommate (or two)! 

A bit about what I’m looking for: 

\- My budget is **$1,700 max/month** 

\- I’m flexible on location 

\- Dream apartment would include: good natural light, space to do yoga, and in-unit washer/dryer — I know these are big asks for the budget, but I’m optimistic we can find something great together (and I've done this many times before)!

About me: I have a cat named Furguson who will be living with us. He’s a complete sweetie, and his litter box will stay in my room — no smell issues, I promise. If you have a cat too, that’s totally fine and Furguson is open to making a friend! 

I'm  open to becoming friends with my roommate(s) — think reality TV nights, workouts, or just chatting over coffee. But if you prefer a respectful co-living vibe without the social pressure, that’s totally cool too! 

**Here's the big thing - cleanliness is number one  for me:** I like to keep things tidy — dishes done by the end of the night, surfaces wiped down, minimal clutter. I vacuum often and appreciate someone who values a clean space, especially the bathroom! 

A few other things: I’m a gay woman, and ideally would love to create a safe, welcoming space for both of us and our friends. If you’re queer too — amazing! If not, I just ask for respect and kindness. 

I’m 420-friendly, but **no smoking (weed or cigarettes) inside** the apartment, mostly for my cat’s health. 

If you think we’d be a good match, reach out sooner rather than later! I’m excited to find a place and build a peaceful, happy home together ",2,1752026686.0,NYCroommates,1,1.0,False

These aren't revolutionary concepts, just practical principles that have helped me get more done while staying sane.

Here's my 8-point system:

1 Start Before You're Ready

Don't wait for perfect conditions or complete knowledge. The best time to start is now, even if you're only 70% prepared. Momentum builds clarity faster than planning ever will.

2. Batch Similar Tasks

Group related activities together instead of jumping between different types of work. Answer all emails at once, make all your calls in one block, do all your creative work during your peak energy hours.

3. Two-Minute Rule

If something takes less than two minutes, do it immediately. Don't add it to your to-do list, don't schedule it for later. This prevents small tasks from snowballing into overwhelming piles.

4. Know Your Peak Hours

Everyone has natural energy rhythms. I do my hardest work between 8-11 AM when my brain is sharpest. Schedule your most important tasks during your biological prime time, not just when it's convenient.

5. Single-Task Like Your Life Depends on It

Multitasking is a myth that makes you less productive, not more. Focus on one thing at a time, finish it, then move to the next. Your brain will thank you with better quality work.

6. Build Systems, Not Goals

Goals tell you what you want; systems tell you how to get there. Instead of ""write a book,"" create a system: ""write 300 words every morning before coffee."" Systems run on autopilot once established.

7. Protect Your Input

Be ruthless about what you consume. Limit news, social media, and negative content. Your mind processes everything you feed it, so choose high-quality inputs if you want high-quality outputs.

8. Weekly Reviews Are Non-Negotiable

Every Sunday, spend 20 minutes reviewing what worked, what didn't, and what needs adjustment. This prevents you from repeating mistakes and helps you course-correct quickly.

These aren't groundbreaking ideas, but applying them consistently has transformed how much I accomplish without burning out.

What simple rules keep you productive? I'd love to hear your approach.

Some days, I look up and realize I've been staring at a screen for hours on end, and it leaves me feeling drained.

I've been experimenting with small habits to create more balance. One thing that's worked is setting specific ""tech-free"" times during the day. For example, I try to avoid screens for the first hour after I wake up. Instead of scrolling through my phone, I make a cup of coffee and read a physical book or just sit outside and listen to the birds. It's amazing how much more grounded I feel starting the day that way.

Another trick is designating certain areas of my home as ""screen-free zones."" My bedroom, for instance, now only has a lamp and a few books. No phones, no laptops, nothing. It's helped me sleep better and has made my bedroom a more peaceful space.

# Chapter 1 The Distance Between Us

Chapter One

Izzy

The Distance Between Us

I was the center of their world.

Not in a self-important way—no, it was more fragile than that. More sacred. Like they’d been waiting for me long before they ever knew my name.

When I was nine, the Richmonds chose me.

After a string of rejections, after being told I was too old, too quiet, too complicated, I was starting to believe the words written in my case file more than the girl staring back at me in the mirror. A foster kid no one wanted. Too much grief, too many questions, too few answers.

I still remember my mother—Bailey. She smelled like jasmine and wore her sadness behind a tired smile. She died when I was five. Cancer. My father followed not long after, his own demons swallowing him whole. I don’t remember much about him except for the anger. And then... nothing.

No aunts. No uncles. No soft hands reaching out. Just state custody and paper trails.

Then came Leo and Nora Richmond.

Leo was calm. Soft-spoken. He spoke to me like I was someone worthy of listening to. He had this way of looking at me like he saw me—even when I didn’t know who I was yet. And Nora... Nora was fire and silk. A defense attorney with razor-sharp wit, who gave the best hugs in the universe. She was fierce in her love, as if daring the world to try and take me from her.

I belonged to them. And they belonged to me.

They didn’t just adopt me—they rebuilt me.

I never once questioned it. Not when they tucked me in every night. Not when they showed up to every school recital, every scraped-knee emergency, every heartache and triumph. They were there. Always. And so, I gave them everything in return—obedience, success, gratitude. Love.

But no child understands the full cost of love. Not until much later.

As I got older, I started to feel the weight of it—their sacrifices, their pride, their unspoken hopes stitched into every conversation about the future. The pressure to be more than just okay. To make it all worth it.

It wasn’t resentment. It was… responsibility.

Then Carl walked in.

We met at a charity gala my mother dragged me to when I was in law school. He stood across the room like he belonged in another life—one filled with corner offices and impossible brilliance. He had this quiet intensity that caught me off guard. Not loud. Not charming. Just... aware.

He noticed things. Like the way I picked at my bracelet when I was anxious, or how my voice dropped when I was uncomfortable. It was unsettling. Intimate. And soon, inevitable.

Falling for him was like slipping underwater—scary, beautiful, and all-consuming.

He was everything I wasn’t allowed to want at the time—older, wildly accomplished, emotionally complex. But he saw me. Not the version I showed the world. Not the Richmonds’ perfect daughter. Just... Izzy.

We married three years ago in a garden that smelled like wild roses and champagne. My mother cried. My father gave Carl a handshake that lasted longer than most speeches. I believed it would last forever.

And maybe it still could.

But right now, it doesn’t feel that way.

Carl’s a cardiac surgeon. One of the best in the country. He’s always chasing the next miracle. And I’m a defense attorney, often fighting for people society has already condemned. Our worlds are heavy. And somewhere along the line, we stopped sharing the weight.

Most days, we’re like ghosts in our own home. Passing in hallways, kissing through yawns and paperwork. I live for the rare nights when we cook together, when his laugh lights up the kitchen, and he looks at me like he used to. But they’re getting fewer.

And the silence in between? It's starting to echo.

Tonight, I woke from an evening nap I don’t remember falling into. The apartment was quiet—too quiet.

The kind of quiet that doesn’t soothe you. The kind that makes you feel abandoned in your own life.

I wandered into the kitchen barefoot, poured myself a glass of wine, and stood by the floor-to-ceiling window of our penthouse. The city sparkled below like a promise I no longer trusted.

It was beautiful. But it didn’t feel mine.

Sometimes I wonder what life would’ve been like if I’d chosen differently. A simpler path. A quieter career. A partner who wasn’t half-married to his job. Maybe even no career at all. Just... peace. But I don’t think peace was ever written into my story.

I stared into the glass, the wine trembling in my hand. My reflection looked older than I felt. Tired in places makeup can’t fix.

And then—his voice.

“Dinner’s ready,” Carl called softly from the kitchen.

I blinked, turned away from the window, and tucked my thoughts into the quiet corners of my mind where I hide everything I’m not ready to face.

He was plating our meal, sleeves rolled up, jaw tight. A man used to saving lives but utterly helpless in the face of an unraveling marriage.

We sat. Ate. Talked about cases and clients and things that didn’t matter. The space between us felt like an ocean.

Finally, he set down his fork. His eyes met mine, and I felt the weight of the question before he even asked.

“Izzy, what’s going on with you?”

He said it gently, but his tone carried an edge of fear.

I opened my mouth—but the truth caught in my throat like a shard of glass. I couldn’t tell him. Not yet.

“I’m fine,” I whispered. “Just tired.”

He didn’t believe me. But he nodded anyway.

Later, we sat on the couch, bodies close, souls far apart. He scrolled through emails. I pretended to watch a show I couldn’t follow.

The clock ticked. The city blinked.

And something inside me splintered.

I knew it in my bones—this wasn’t just a rough patch. It was a reckoning. Something was coming. A truth too big to hide. A secret I’d buried too deep.

And I wasn’t sure if our love could survive it.



# Chapter 2 Shifting Silence

Chapter Two:

Shifting silence

Izzy

The quiet hum of the clock continued as the night went on, the seconds stretching between us like an endless chasm. I could feel Carl's presence beside me, but it was like we were both trapped in our own worlds, unable to bridge the gap that had formed between us, He shifted slightly as if he was going to say something, but he didn't, I didn't either, Maybe we were both too afraid of what might come out if we do.

I wish I could reach across the divide, and tell him what was really going on inside me, That it is not just the fatigue from long hours of work, or absence of time together that is eating me up, it is something deeper, something I have been avoiding for far too long, But how do I say it? How do I voice the things that have been buried so deeply inside me?

Carl's phone buzzed on the coffee table, breaking the stillness; he picked it up without a second thought, glancing at the screen. His expression tightened, and for a split second, I saw something flicker in his eyes, a look I couldn't quite place.

“Work?” I ask, trying to keep my tone light, but the curiosity is too much to mask.

“Yeah,” he replies, his voice flat. “I need to head in for an emergency case.”

I nodded, though the weight in my chest grew heavier. This is what our life has become. It was a cycle of him disappearing into the hospital and me staying behind, waiting for scraps of time we could share. The irony doesn’t escape me, he is a surgeon, dedicated to saving lives, but it feels like we’re both losing ours, bit by bit.

He stands up, gathering his things, and I stay seated on the couch, watching him, wondering if this is what we’ve become, two people existing in the same space, but living entirely separate lives.

“I’ll be back as soon as I can,” he says, his voice a little softer now, as though he’s trying to reconnect with something that’s slipping away between us. But the words feel hollow.

I forced a smile, though it didn’t reach my eyes. “Be safe.”

As the door closes behind him, I’m left in silence once again. It presses in on me, suffocating, as though the walls of this apartment are closing in. I stand up, pacing back and forth, trying to shake off the suffocating feeling. I’m used to this—the loneliness, the quiet. But tonight, it feels different. Tonight, it feels like a warning.

I grabbed my phone, staring at the blank screen, unsure of what to do with the sudden rush of emotions flooding me. I thought about calling someone Pat, my friend, maybe even my father, but I didn't. Instead, my finger hovers over the contact for Carl, the one person I should talk to, the one person who should understand. But I can’t bring myself to call him. I don’t know if he’d even answer.

I drop the phone back onto the counter and move to the window, staring down at the lights of the city once more. There’s a restless energy in me now, something that I can’t ignore. It’s like a storm brewing inside, and I don’t know if it’s about to break or if I can stop it.

And then, just as the weight of everything starts to feel unbearable, my phone rings. The number on the screen is unfamiliar, but something about it makes my pulse quicken. I hesitate for a moment before answering.

“Hello?” My voice sounds strange and distant, as if I’m speaking from somewhere far away.

“Izzy,” a voice says, and my breath catches in my throat.

It’s Carl. But it’s not the Carl I know. There’s something in his voice, something urgent, something that makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.

“Izzy, I need to tell you something,” he says, and for a moment, I wonder if it’s just another call about work, another emergency that I’ll have to let go of. But then I hear it in his tone—the weight of his words, the gravity of whatever is about to happen.

And I’m not ready for what he says next.

“I’m sorry. I should have told you sooner. But there’s something I need us to talk about. Something that might change everything.”

My heart races, and suddenly, the silence in the apartment feels deafening. Something is about to shift again. And this time, I’m not sure that I can hold on.



# Chapter 3 Finding You Again

Chapter Three: Finding You Again

Izzy

Carl's words lingered in the air, heavy and unresolved, but something shifted between us, in that moment, it was like a crack formed in the shell that had surrounded us for months maybe even longer, The tension that had been building, unspoken, and unacknowledged, suddenly seems to have a voice, But before I could respond, Carl's voice was low and tensed, he called me back.

""Izzy, are you still there?""

I swallowed hard, my heart racing, There was a part of me that was afraid to push this moment forward, and afraid of what the truth or the turnout this might bring, but there was another part, the part I had been ignoring, the part that wanted to lean in, to trust him, to bridge the distance between us The loneliness I had been hiding behind started to feel more suffocating now, the desire for connection surging like an undeniable force.

“I’m here,” I replied, my voice barely above a whisper. “Carl… what are you trying to say?”

I heard him exhale, as though he had been holding his breath, and then a long silence follows. It was almost as if we were both searching for the right words, but neither of us knew exactly how to make this moment right. I could feel the weight of his hesitation through the phone, but it didn't scare me as much as it should have. Instead, I felt something else, something like hope.

“Izzy,” he said again, his voice more tender now. “I know we’ve been distant lately, but I don’t want you to think I’m not here. I… I just need you to know how much you mean to me.”

I closed my eyes, letting his words wash over me. For the first time in weeks, the distance between us didn’t feel insurmountable. I heard the honesty in his voice, and for the first time in so long, I felt seen.

“I know, Carl,” I replied, my heart opening a little more with every word. “I’ve felt it, too.”

There was a brief pause, and I could hear him moving as if he was stepping closer. My breath caught in my throat as the air between us changed again. There’s something else there now, something unspoken, but no longer unacknowledged.

“Izzy,” he murmured, and then I heard the faint sound of the door clicking shut, signaling his return home. The rustle of his jacket was discarded. Footsteps. The softest breath.

My chest tightened in anticipation.

“I need to see you,” Carl continued, his voice low and urgent. “Now.”

I didn't say anything, didn't question it. I just felt it in my bones, his need, my need. Without another word, I hung up the phone, my hands shaking slightly as I set it down on the counter. My heart thudded louder with each passing second as I made my way toward the door, toward him.

When I opened it, Carl was standing there, his face slightly flushed from the cold, his eyes dark with unspoken longing. He was looking at me like he hasn’t seen me in years, as though he has been waiting for this moment.

“Izzy,” he breathed, stepping inside before I even had a chance to say anything.

The moment the door clicks shut behind him, he was already pulling me close, his lips capturing mine in a slow kiss, deliberate like he’s savoring every second of it. It was like he was telling me everything he couldn’t say with words, and I let him—let him drown me in the warmth of his touch, the way his hands cradle my face like I might shatter if he didn’t hold me just right.

I felt his body press against mine, the heat of him, the urgency. There was a tension between us that’d been building for far too long, but now it was different; it was not just about desire; it was about connection, about remembering what it felt like to belong to someone and to be wanted in return.

His hands slipped down my back, pulling me closer, and I melted into him, feeling the strength of his body, the way his chest rose and fell beneath my fingertips. It was as though the world had narrowed down to just the two of us, and I was afraid to break this moment, afraid that if I pulled away, I’d lose something precious.

Carl pulled back just slightly, his forehead resting against mine, breath mingling with mine. “I’ve missed you, Izzy. I’ve missed this. Us.”

I didn't respond at first, just let the words sink in, feeling the weight of them settle deep in my chest. I’d missed him too. More than I’d been willing to admit.

“I’ve missed you too,” I whispered, the confession slipping out before I could stop it.

Without another word, Carl leaned down, capturing my lips in another kiss, but this time, it was deeper and more intimate. His hands moved to the hem of my shirt, lifting it slowly, as though giving me time to pull away if I needed to. But I didn’t. I lifted my arms, allowing him to undress me, feeling the cool air against my skin, but only for a moment before he was back, his hands warm against me, his body pressing into mine.

When he lifted me, I wrapped my legs around his waist instinctively, needing to be as close to him as possible. My heart raced in time with the rhythm of our movements as he carried me to the bedroom, not breaking the kiss even once, as though this moment was the only thing that mattered.

He laid me down gently on the bed, his hands tracing the curves of my body with such tenderness that I almost forgot how much we’d drifted apart. It’s like he was rediscovering me, and I was doing the same with him. His lips moved over my skin, soft and reverent, and for the first time in a long while, I let myself feel all the emotions I’d been burying, love, desire, longing, and something deeper.

When we finally came together, it was not rushed. It was slow, deliberate. Each touch, each movement is an unspoken promise, a reaffirmation that we were still here, still connected in the most intimate way possible. And in that moment, there was no space between us—no more distance, no more secrets. Just Carl and I, and the quiet, intense love we’d nearly lost, but had now found again.

And I knew, with absolute certainty, that this was the beginning of something new. Something that might heal the fractures, something that might put us back together again.



# Chapter 4 Steps Towards Us

Chapter Four

Izzy:

The morning light filtered through the blinds, soft and muted, casting gentle shadows across the room, I lay beside Carl, my head on his chest, feeling the steady rhythm of his heartbeat beneath my cheek, it was comforting, But there was heaviness, a question in the air that I couldn't ignore, last night had been...... something I hadn't expected, something I didn't know I needed until it happened, And now, lying here with him, I could feel that fragile thread between us, pulling me in one direction and pushing me away in another.

I wanted to stay in this moment, to forget everything else and just be with him. But my mind wouldn’t let me. It was too loud with all the things we hadn’t said. The things I didn’t know how to say.

His fingers brushed gently across my shoulder, and I shifted, realizing he was awake, I could feel the tension in him, too, he was thinking about something, I could always tell when he was lost in thought, it was like there was a wall

he put up, and no matter how close we were, there were still parts of him he kept hidden.

""Hey,"" Carl’s voice was low, rough from sleep.

""Hey,"" I replied, still feeling the lingering weight of everything we hadn't addressed. But at this moment, it felt like we didn’t need to talk about it just yet. It was enough that we were here, together.

He shifted slightly, looking down at me. ""I didn’t expect this,"" he murmured, his fingers tracing idle patterns on my arm. ""I didn’t expect to feel like this again.""

I closed my eyes, a part of me wanting to ignore the truth in his words. But I couldn’t. Not when it felt like everything between us was unraveling, slowly but surely. I had been trying to keep my distance, to protect myself, but being here with him, feeling his warmth against me, it was hard to ignore how much I had missed him.

""Me neither,"" I whispered, my voice barely audible. ""But I’m glad it’s happening.""

I could feel him stiffen a little, like he was waiting for me to say more. But I didn’t know what to say. I didn’t know if I was ready to say all the things that were building inside of me, the things I had been holding back for so long. And yet, there was something in his eyes that made me want to open up.

The silence between us stretched, thick and heavy. I could feel his breath on the top of my head, his chest rising and falling with every breath. It was like we were both waiting, but neither of us knew for what.

Then, I broke the silence.

“I don’t know what this means, Carl,” I said, my voice trembling ever so slightly. ""I don’t know where we go from here.""

I felt him tense, his muscles tightening under my fingertips. But he didn’t pull away. Instead, I felt his hands move to my face, lifting my chin gently so that I was looking into his eyes. He was searching my face like he was trying to find the right words.

“We take it one step at a time,” he said, his voice soft but firm. “We don’t have to figure it all out right now. Let’s just... be honest with each other. That’s a good place to start.”

His words hung in the air between us, and I let them sink in. I had to admit, it sounded like a reasonable plan. But could we really be honest with each other after everything? After the distance, the silence, the lies we’d both told ourselves?

I wanted to believe him. I wanted to believe that we could start fresh, that we could fix what had been broken. But the fear still lingered, gnawing at me from the inside.

“I can do that,” I whispered, my voice barely audible. “But I need to know you’re here. Not just... physically here, but emotionally. I need to know that you’re all in. I can’t keep doing this back-and-forth with you, Carl.”

I saw his expression shift, his brow furrowing slightly, but his hands remained gentle as he held me. His eyes softened, and I could see that this was hitting him harder than I had expected.

“I’m here,” he said, his voice thick with emotion. “I don’t know if I’ve ever been more here in my life. I was scared, Izzy. I was scared of losing you for good, and I didn’t know how to fix it. But I’m done with that. I’m here, and I’m not going anywhere.”

His words did something to me. They hit deep, cutting through the walls I was building around myself. I could see the truth in his eyes and feel the sincerity in his touch. It wasn’t the easy fix I’d been hoping for, but maybe it was a step in the right direction.

“I don’t know how long it’ll take,” I said, my voice quiet and steady. “But I’m willing to try. To figure it out. If you are.”

His gaze never wavered, and for the first time in a long while, I felt like we might actually have a chance. We weren’t perfect, we weren’t fixed, but maybe we didn’t need to be. Maybe we just needed to be here, with each other.

“I am,” he whispered, leaning down to kiss my forehead softly. “I’ll do whatever it takes.”

I nodded, my heart pounding in my chest. There was so much uncertainty, so many things left unsaid, but in that moment, I was willing to take a chance. To believe that we could rebuild, even if it meant starting over. Together.

Carl didn’t let go. Even after the words were said, after the weight began to lift—he just held me. And I let him. Maybe it was foolish, maybe it was dangerous, but it felt good. He felt good. His hands were warm against my back, and the way he breathed me in like he was afraid I’d vanish. I’d missed this—missed him—in ways I hadn’t even realized until now.

For a while, we stayed like that, tangled together in the silence. No words, just quiet breaths and the soft rise and fall of his chest against mine. His fingers gently brushed my spine, like he couldn’t stop touching me even if he tried. And I didn’t want him to.

“You’re still the most beautiful woman I’ve ever known,” he murmured into my hair, and I felt my heart flutter in my chest. “I don’t say it enough. I should’ve always said it more.”

I smiled against his skin, my eyes closing, allowing myself—for just a little while—to believe that maybe this could work. That maybe love wasn’t about having it all figured out, but about choosing to stay even when it was hard.

“I feel like I can breathe again,” I whispered.

Carl’s hand found mine under the sheets, lacing our fingers together. “Then let’s keep breathing. Together.”

I didn’t reply. I didn’t need to. My heart was speaking loud enough.

I nestled into him again, letting the warmth of his body and the softness of the moment wrap around me like a cocoon. I didn’t want to move. Didn’t want to think about what came next.

But the world never waited.

My phone buzzed again—this time louder, more insistent. A ringtone I couldn’t ignore.

Carl groaned beside me as I reached for it. I turned the screen over.

Incoming Call: MS ERIN

My heart sank.

“Of course,” I muttered, sitting up. “It’s my boss.”

Carl propped himself on his elbow, eyes narrowing a little. “Do you have to?”

I gave him a look. “It’s Ms. Erin. If I don’t answer, she wi’ll send a SWAT team to my apartment.”

Carl exhaled, clearly annoyed on my behalf but didn’t argue. I answered, clearing my throat as I stepped out of bed and paced toward the window.

“Hello?”



# Chapter 5 My Wedding Anniversary

Chapter five:

My Wedding Anniversary

It was our wedding anniversary day, and I was buzzing with excitement, I had told my Boss, Erin, that I’d be closing on time to see my husband at Saint Paul's, where he works, I quickly wrapped my work up, I was eager, desperate and even to surprise Carl,

Yesterday, our entanglement had been unforgettable, we had promised each other to sort things out, to open up, and to rebuild our trust. That conversation has lifted a weight off my shoulders.

I had picked out a small gift, nothing extravagant but something thoughtful, and a smile I couldn't wipe off my face. I couldn't wait to see him, to spend some quiet time together from work and from the world.

Immediately, I got out from my long drive. I held my little gift bag closely as I made my way to Carl's office, my heels clicking rhythmically on the cold, sterile floor; as I turned the corner, I saw one of the nurses, Nurse Leila, a friendly face which I recognized.

""Is Carl around?"", I asked, trying to keep my voice casual, but I couldn't hide the excitement.

"" He is probably in the call room,"" she replied with a smile.

I knew exactly where that was; I had been to that room more times than I could count, when we were newlyweds, to bring him a coffee or just to say hello. It was the place where I knew I could always find him anytime he was not in his office, and I was ready to share this moment with him.

Still smiling, I headed down the familiar hallway, my steps quickening with anticipation, The call room door was slightly ajar, and without thinking, I pushed it open, expecting to find Carl, maybe tired from his shift but always so glad to see me, But instead of finding him alone, my world came crashing down.

There, tangled in white sheets and in each other’s arms, were Carl and Dr. Eddie, one of our closest family friends.

Time froze.

My breath caught in my throat, and for a moment, I couldn’t move. I couldn’t process what my eyes were seeing. The gift bag slipped from my fingers, falling to the floor with a soft thud, but I barely heard it. My heart was racing, my pulse pounding in my ears, as the weight of the moment crushed me.

Tears welled up in my eyes before spilling over, hot and fast, as I turned and bolted. I didn’t think, I didn’t stop. I just ran, my legs carrying me away from that room, away from the betrayal, away from the life I thought I had and a life of new beginnings

I had no idea where I was going. My mind was a whirlwind of disbelief, of anger, of hurt. All I knew was I needed to get away from him, from this, from everything.

Hours later, I found myself in a dimly lit bar. The neon signs outside flickered as I stepped through the door, the smell of stale beer and cheap whiskey hanging in the air. I didn’t care. I needed to be anywhere but there.

The bartender glanced at me as I slid onto a barstool, my hands trembling as I wiped my tears, trying to pull myself together.

“Whiskey,” I croaked, my voice thick with emotion.

The bartender raised an eyebrow but didn’t ask questions. He poured the drink and slid it over to me. I picked it up, not caring that it was too strong, too bitter. I needed something to numb the ache in my chest.

I stared into the glass, my mind spinning. My hands shook, the cold of the glass grounding me as I tried to make sense of what had just happened. Carl and Eddie. How long has this been going on? How had I not seen it? How had I been so blind?

I knocked back the whiskey in one go, the burn not doing anything to dull the pain in my heart. The tears started again, falling silently as I fought to breathe through the suffocating weight of betrayal. My wedding anniversary was our third year, and this was how it ended.

How had we gotten here? How have I gotten here?

I didn’t know what to do, where to go, or how to face him. The Carl I had known, the one who promised to never hurt me, the one who swore he would always be there, was gone. All I was left with was a stranger who had broken my trust in the worst way possible.

Another drink was placed in front of me, and I didn’t ask for it. I just took it.

And for a brief, fleeting moment, I allowed myself to forget, as the warmth of the whiskey settled into my stomach, spreading a dull haze over my thoughts. The noise of the bar, the clink of glasses, the murmur of conversations all felt so distant, so irrelevant. The world around me continued, people living their lives, oblivious to the chaos I was drowning in.

My mind kept replaying the scene in the call room, the sight of Carl's face, the way he looked when he saw me, the surprise that crossed his features before it melted into something else, something guarded. Eddie's presence beside him only amplified the sting, the realization that I wasn’t just betrayed by my husband, but by someone I had trusted, someone who had been a part of our lives for so long.

I pushed the thoughts away, not wanting to face them, not wanting to process the magnitude of what had just happened. I reached for the second drink, taking a slow sip, letting the burn pull me back into the moment, into the numbness.

I could feel the ache in my chest, a deep, hollow emptiness that I knew would take time to fill if it ever would. But I couldn’t think about that right now. I couldn’t think about what I was going to do, how I was going to face him, or how I could ever trust him again.

The bartender eyed me carefully, his expression softening as he leaned over the counter. “You okay, sweetheart?” he asked, his voice low and gentle, as if he’d seen it all before.

I forced a smile, but I could feel how fake it was. “Just... just need a moment,” I muttered, my voice rough from the tears I had cried.

He nodded, and I appreciated his quiet understanding. He didn’t push, didn’t try to pry. Just let me be.

I took another sip of my drink, trying to focus on the taste, on the burn, on anything that could distract me from the whirlwind inside my mind. But nothing worked. The image of Carl and Eddie in that bed kept haunting me. The lies, the secrecy, the thought that I had been so sure of our love, was it all a lie? Had it been a lie from the start?

I heard the soft jingle of the bar door opening, followed by the shuffle of footsteps. I didn’t look up, but the sound of those footsteps grew closer and closer until they stopped beside me.

Thought I would make a brand new post to mark 21 days from my D-Day. You can get my full story from [my original post here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Infidelity/comments/1lf63si/i_27m_found_out_my_partner_of_nearly_4_years_26f/)  
I also [made a post in InfidelityAsOne ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsOneAfterInfidelity/comments/1lstq7y/navigating_her_still_working_with_her_affair/)about her still working with her AP and if it's workable. 

So my last update I mentioned I found the AP’s Partner, (AP had a partner of 8 years, they had an offer on a house together they since pulled out of) we stayed in touch intermittently over the past couple of weeks. Turns out the AP was still lying to her about going absolutely no contact with my partner. (shock). Within three days of working together again he came up to her to ‘check how she was going’ and they also had a lunch meeting together with 2 or 3 other colleagues. The AP also said that he would talk to his boss or management to distance himself from my partner, which obviously hasn’t happened yet.

My partner was getting annoyed that I was still in contact with the AP’s Partner because ‘I was fixating on it and not focusing on our relationship.’ I did tell her it was nice that she’s only now keen to focus on our relationship.

I’m no longer in contact with the AP’s Partner – it appears she blocked me, she did mention in a previous conversation that she didn’t want to keep in touch which is fair enough. (I wasn’t blowing up her phone or anything lol) But I do wonder if my partner and AP talked about it to make it happen to stop the information flow – but could be just my trust issues.

**Where Things Stand with my (ex) Partner**

I’ve been talking to my (ex)-partner on and off. I was so set on ending things originally. Reading back my old posts I was pretty certain it was over. But to be honest, I started to crack when she had started successfully looking for another flat. Something about it made everything real.

Since then, we’ve had a few long conversations, some heated, lots of tears, and we agreed she would come back to the flat to stay in another room as there’ll be a room available for the next few weeks which buys me a bit more breathing room to sit with my ambivalence.

We saw a couples counsellor – someone who was experienced in betrayal/infidelity, but it felt like a waste of time. We didn’t even touch on the things we needed to. Even getting her to that appointment was difficult. She originally refused because she had an ‘unmissable work meeting’. I asked if it could be rescheduled or for her to send someone else, she said no. After a heated back and forth, she managed to move the meeting within 10 minutes of trying… The session itself felt like a waste of time. Should have just let her have that meeting. But we may see someone else together next week.

**How I’m Doing**

I have barely been able to think about anything else for a minute for 21 days. I’m failing at work, I’ve noticed I’m isolating myself a lot more, and barely been anywhere outside of my room, my work, and the occasional trip to the gym. My closest friends are all overseas. For the past two weeks my emotions have been mostly stable, just ruminating a lot, but today I feel such a deep sadness. I have had some tough times in my life but I have never been lower.

I saw a therapist (by myself) who gave me a bit of hope. Told me it’s okay if my boundaries change over time. I mentioned I don’t know what I want yet because I want to make sure my ‘why’ is right. That my decision to stay or leave will each have multiple ‘why’s.’ He encouraged that I meet her for coffee and I should have an inkling on what I want.

I’ve read NOT ‘Just Friends’ by Shirley Glass (A+ book) State of Affairs by Esther Perel (terrible book), How to help your spouse heal from your affair by Linda MacDonald, and Leave a Cheater, Gain a Life by Tracy Schorn. Any other book suggestions would be handy.

**Where’s My Head At**

I realised this week that despite the betrayal and how utterly broken I’ve felt, for me, it’s always been her. And even now I still want her with everything I have. That’s been hard to accept, most books I’ve read, most comments on Reddit, most friends I talk to tells me I should gtfo. And they’re all probably right. I just really believed in what we were building together, I believe she’s remorseful and the love doesn’t just go away over night.

I even got offered a room in London (other side of the world for me) by one of my close mates. I got offered an exciting potentially career-making project at work, but I feel I don’t want either of these things compared to being with my partner.

Despite all this, there’s one boundary I don’t think I can let go of. She needs to go absolutely no contact with the AP. And that means finding a new job. They kissed multiple times, messaged 4-5 days a week which would often turn flirty/sexual, and admitted to a mutual ‘vibe’ throughout. Yes, I could monitor phones/location etc. but I couldn’t stop either of them going up to each other and verbally planning a make out session in the staff car park again. I don’t think I can even start healing or thinking about reconciling until they’re completely out of contact. My partner said they’ve now been avoiding each other like a plague but admits that ‘vibe’ doesn’t just go away overnight.

She’s paying for all the couples therapy sessions, she’s saying all the right things, she seems to be remorseful and says it’s the biggest mistake of her life.

I know she won’t want to leave her job though. She originally shut that down without even attempting to look. I feel like the hope of reconciling things was keeping me going the past couple of weeks, but I feel like I’ve lost the last bit of my hope. Is it worth her spending thousands on therapy and beating a dead horse? I’ve been trying to bend over backwards to find a way to make this work, but it’s becoming clear, unfortunately, there’s no way forward.

**The Tough Pill to Swallow**

No matter how much I love or want or try,  if she’s unwilling to remove the very things that broke us, I’m just wasting my time. I’ve been trying to bend over backwards to find a magical solution, but it’s becoming clearer there’s no options apart from radical change and complete separation from her AP.

I think that loss of that last speckle of hope, has just grown my grief. 

I know I’m probably going to get a lot of angry comments below telling me to pull my head in. But I do appreciate all your comments and apologise for coming off as that guy who's not listening to sound advice! I would love to hear from anyone who tried to reconcile while the wayward still worked with the AP and how that went for you.  ",5,1752025876.0,Infidelity,10,0.78,False
1lv6oxi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1lv6oxi/aita_for_questioning_regular_customers_about_an/,AITA for questioning regular customers about an oversized custom drink order and refusing to share my name?,"Hi everyone. Sorry for the long post but something happened at my café job, and it’s been bothering me. I’d appreciate some outside perspective.

I work at a small café where two regular customers (I’ll call them the Green Tea Sisters) have been coming for years. Back when the café first opened, the owner (I’ll call him Sam) made special exceptions for certain loyal customers because business was slow.

The Green Tea Sisters always order a specific drink. For context, the standard recipe uses a 3-to-1 ratio of tea concentrate to syrup. They always ask for much more concentrate and syrup — basically the proportions for a larger size — plus less ice, which means we have to add more milk. For years, they’ve been paying the price of a regular drink while getting a much more expensive version.

About a year ago, there was an incident with them. One day, their payment didn’t go through. My coworker (I’ll call her Maya) asked them to wait and check their bank app, but instead they took their drinks and left without saying anything. They also didn’t come back for a long time after that. Since then, everyone at work has known them as the Green Tea Sisters, and the story has been sort of an inside reference among the staff.

Fast forward to recently. The sisters came in and asked for a large green tea drink. Maya and I both thought maybe they were finally planning to pay for the actual large size that matches their usual customizations. But instead, they wanted double the usual large-size ratio for each drink—and they ordered two of those. Basically, they were asking for enough ingredients to make four large drinks but only wanted to pay for two.

At the time, I was just clocking out, but when I overheard the order, I stepped in and asked them, “Are you guys allowed to do that? Did Sam say it was okay?”

Immediately, they insisted that Sam had approved this order. But here’s the thing: Maya has been working here for over a year and has never once heard of Sam approving such a big order for the price of a regular one. It really felt like the sisters were being deceptive — which is probably why they got so defensive when I said I was going to check with Sam. Honestly, if we just let anyone come in and say they “know the owner” to justify custom orders, things would get completely out of hand.

So I told Maya that I’d check with Sam, and I said this in a normal speaking volume, not yelling, and definitely not talking badly about the sisters. There’s quite a bit of physical distance between the customer side and our workspace behind the bar. In my view, there was enough space that what I was saying to Maya should not have been part of the sisters’ conversation unless they were actively listening in.

One of the sisters suddenly jumped in, saying, “What did you say?” I replied, “I wasn’t talking to you.” She immediately looked offended and said, “You’re so rude.”

I told her she was eavesdropping on a conversation that wasn’t directed at her. She insisted, “I’m standing right here,” which is technically true — she was in the café — but it still felt like she was intentionally inserting herself into something that wasn’t her business yet, because we hadn’t even resolved whether their order was allowed.

We went back and forth for a bit. She kept saying I was rude for questioning them and demanded my name. I told her I was off the clock and didn’t have to give her my name if I didn’t want to. She then tried to get my name from Maya, who thankfully backed me up and said I didn’t want to share it.

The sisters kept saying that if I was off the clock, I should mind my own business and leave them alone, and went on about how I was a terrible server who should find another job. At that point, I stopped talking, but I did go stand near the drink pickup station, arms crossed, watching them. I know that’s probably not the best customer service behavior, but I felt like they were crossing my boundaries and being verbally aggressive.

While all this was happening, another customer (a man) who’d come in earlier chimed in. Earlier that day, he’d ordered a coffee drink with milk and requested it extra hot. In our café, that drink is typically made with hot water and espresso, and if you add cold milk, that’s standard. Steamed milk technically turns it into a different drink, which costs extra. He was upset that his drink wasn’t hot enough, and I’d explained the policy. Anyway, while the Green Tea Sisters were arguing with me, this man suddenly said, “Yeah, that’s her. She’s the rude one.”

The sisters immediately jumped on that and started agreeing with him, calling me rude over and over.

Another regular customer, who’s always been kind, came up to me and quietly said she was sorry I was dealing with those people. The Green Tea Sisters immediately started yelling at her too, saying she didn’t even know what I’d said and shouldn’t be taking my side. It turned into a huge scene in front of other customers.

Afterward, I texted Sam and explained everything. He confirmed that he had not authorized the sisters to get double-large drinks for the price of one. He also said he’s planning to end all special exceptions because costs have gone up too much. He seemed supportive of me, but we’ll see how the sisters decide to spin the story.

1lv6orx,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1lv6orx/aita_for_not_staying_out_of_my_best_friends/,AITA for not staying out of my best friend’s marriage and helping her destroy her cheating husband’s reputation?,"This is about my best friend, ""Emily"" (38F). She’d never share this herself—because she’s too classy to ever tell the full story herself—but I’m not. And since her husband loved attention so much, here’s some more. And I *saw it all unfold*, I want the world to know how my BFF handled her cheating husband like an absolute queen.

Emily and Adam (41M) had been married for 15 years. And they built everything together—careers, a home, and a life with two daughters. On paper, it looked like the dream: they both worked corporate jobs, had a nice house, and Emily somehow balanced full-time work *and* doing 90% of the childcare, cooking, and housework. Adam liked to call himself a “provider,” but let’s be honest—he was a guest in his own home.

Now, here’s where I come in. I work at the same company as Adam—but in a different division, on a different floor. We only bumped into each other occasionally, usually in the lobby or kitchen area. But every now and then, I’d catch him chatting to younger and *veeery* attractive female coworkers a little *too* close and comfortably. Hands on backs. Inside jokes. One time I saw him tuck a strand of hair behind a woman's ear, and it sent a chill through me. I had mentioned these things to Emily sometimes over the years because I knew she was the super secure type, but she would laugh it off and say he's always been super friendly. And she wasn't wrong. I had known Adam for quite a while and he is a touchy-feely kind of guy, gets along with everyone, lights up a room. So I brushed it off too.

BUT, more recently, Emily started telling me how Adam had become cold. Distant. Dismissive. He’d say things like:

“You’re always exhausted. I want you to be more than just a roommate.”  
“You’ve let yourself go.”

All while she was working full-time, raising their kids, doing bedtime routines alone, cooking dinner most nights, and barely sleeping. She wasn’t as affectionate anymore, yes—but she was *exhausted*. Not checked out. Just overworked and *underloved*. And she looks fabulous by the way - three kids, a full time career and can still turn heads and has the warmest of smiles too. 

When she tried to bring it up, or ask questions, he was say things to her like:

""You're being insecure,”  
“I've been under so much preassure at work and you don't even notice it. You want to make it about you.”

Or, “you're just looking for something to be mad about

But his behaviour didn't get better, still distant towards her. Then Emily finally found something concrete. A receipt from a bar near his office, on a night he said he was staying back to finish a report his boss wanted the next day. Emily then started asking me to keep an eye on him a bit more, and what true friend would say no? Plus work was rather boring at that time, so I happily started sleuthing around the office like a ninja. I made more trips down to his department, looking for coffee refills, using the photocopier saying ours was playing up. There was another worker there who liked me, so I would linger around his desk, ask him questions and flirt. Not gonna lie - he was kinda cute and funny so I really enjoyed that part. That’s how I found out the dirt on Adam and that homewrecking cow, we'll call ""Karen."" I found out as much as I could about her, and shared it all with Emily. That was the hard part though - she was crushed, and I wanted to destroy that man for hurting my BFF. Kara was young about early 30's, attractive, no kids, married. She worked in Adam’s department and my now alliance coworker (I was now flirting with) spilled AAAALLLLLLLL the tea. He had seen them leaving work together often, whispering and laughing, briefly touching in the no-no areas when you're a married man, flirting, you name it. 

So Emily found Kara’s LinkedIn. Then her Instagram. And from there, she found Kara’s husband ""Mike."" Emily thought about confronting Adam first. But instead, she decided to get her ducks in a row before speaking with Adam or blowing the whistle to Kara’s husband directly. Emily is a smart woman, and she was going to gather all the evidence for the lawyer, plotting her next move - she was livid. And my queen of a bestie was going to make sure she wouldn't lose more then needed. For the 15yrs they were married, Emily wasn't one to pry through her husbands phone, but now she was snooping through Adam's phone and found what she needed as proof of the affair. She spent weeks sneaking into his phone taking screenshots of flirty texts, messages of when they were hooking up. And he has no idea. She kept things cool and calm on the outside even though she was devestated on the inside. Emily showed me the screenshot messages too - the messages started off vague, but those two cheating a-holes got comfortable over their year-long affair and became more blatant and raunchy with their messages and photos, a bit of sexting sprinkled in for good measure. Adam even said in one message to Kara how he and his wife don't check each others phones to respect privacy. They knew each others passcodes and as much he'd liked to have changed his to be on the safe side (as Kara requested), his wife would definitely know something was up if she went to make a call from it and noticed it wasn't the same passcode.  

Then an opportunity came Emily couldn't resist. Our company held a private after-hours celebration—a contract win or something - I probably should have known in more detail what it was for, but I didn't care at that point, my department was invited, but I was just there for the fireworks and hanging out with my fun flirty co-worker I'd become close with. But it was catered, suits, and full of corporate smiles.

About an hour into the evening, Emily showed up. She wore a red, fitted dress—not too showy, just devastatingly elegant and form fitting. She walked in like she owned the floor - gorgeous and confident with all that built up anger inside of her. I don't know how she kept so calm and graceful on the outside. Adam’s eyes went wide the second he saw her - partners weren't invited. She walked up to him, handed him a slim envelope, and said:“You’ll want to read that. It has everything—texts, receipts, hotel bills. And in case you’re wondering, Kara’s husband got his copy this morning.”

Co-worker and I were at full attention, drinks paused in the air, standing close enough to watch the long awaited drama unfold. You could literally see the colour drain from Adam's face!

Those nearby in the room went still, approx 15 of us, including his senior manager. Emily didn't yell. No drama. Just quiet humiliation. She turned to the nearby senior manager she’d met a few years ago at a work function and said, with a smile, “Lovely seeing you again. Take care.” Then walked away like someone who’d just buried the past—and didn’t plan on looking back. I had to hide my smug smile behind my coworker, but on the inside I swear to you I was fist pumping ""YES GIRL!""

About a week later, I found out that Kara handed in her resignation notice. Rumour has it her husband asked her to quit her job if she wanted to work on their marriage. Or maybe she was just mortified it was all out there. There ain't a woman in that division that would trust her to be anywhere near them / their husbands.   
Adam’s coworkers? They’re avoiding him. The gossip’s everywhere. HR had a talk. He wasn’t fired—but he’s socially radioactive now.  
Emily filed for divorce. She kept the house. Their daughters chose to stay with Emily.  
They are understandably heartbroken—and furious. They won’t talk to him. 

Adam now lives alone in a little apartment, texting Emily (which she shares with me) every few days with messages:

Adam: “I’m sorry. I lost control. Let’s just start fresh.”  
Emily: “You didn’t lose control. You made a choice—over and over. And now I’m making mine.”

So I ask you—was I the ahole for helping her plan all of this?

Sorry for the long post, but something happened at my café job, and it’s been bothering me. I’d appreciate some outside perspective.



I work at a small café where two regular customers (I’ll call them the Green Tea Sisters) have been coming for years. Back when the café first opened, the owner (I’ll call him Sam) made special exceptions for certain loyal customers because business was slow.



The Green Tea Sisters always order a specific drink. For context, the standard recipe uses a 3-to-1 ratio of tea concentrate to syrup. They always ask for much more concentrate and syrup — basically the proportions for a larger size — plus less ice, which means we have to add more milk. For years, they’ve been paying the price of a regular drink while getting a much more expensive version.

Its very hidden ,sad as i think more people would go if they knew of this place. i feel with more new people and young adults 18-30 it would be very special for myself to meet people closer to my age with similar beliefs. id also like to see more young speakers to hear there take on there spiritual beliefs. Note yes it can seem a bit weird going here as im one of the few younger people and sometimes the only young one as the others dont always go.  i was thinking of going to one in Calgary or Edmonton where theres more people for just this week to meet more people my age. im a little uncomfortable  to say who i am but if you decide to go this week maybe ill wait to go to another place so we can meet. Maybe we could do a young adults group like Churches do thats way if you dont like the place you can still have some where to make friends. ",0,1752025603.0,RedDeer,3,0.44,False

We live in the UK and currently own a Gaggia Classic Pro, however my partner is threatening to bring out his old Nespresso machine and spends most of the time using instant now, so I'm going to have to do something!

He drinks cow's milk, doesn't like the faff of tampering grounds, and doesn't love the taste of what comes out. He's got no interest in learning to use the machine we have to improve this, and I end up steaming his milk for him too.

I drink non-dairy milk, love the steam wand more than the machine, and maybe make myself an actual espresso once per month. I'm also keen to have a predominantly black machine to match our kitchen. Mild tinkering and servicing is ok, but I'll be doing all maintenance and likely cleaning for a machine I'll only really use to steam milk.

We need a way to produce a dairy milk cappuccino at the press of a button, yet allow me to steam oat/coconut/almond milk for all kinds of creative drinks. It would also be great to have a grounds function as well as beans so we can use up our stock.

I've been looking at options and I need someone more qualified to tell me what they would do - thank you in advanced!

I'm between these refurbished options:

* Gaggia Magenta Plus (current model) where my partner would have to learn to use the steam wand
* Gaggia Cadorna Style - perhaps the compromise, easy-use wand
* Philips Saeco Exprelia (hd8856) - old and a bit too sliver, but those machines are indestructible and have one-touch plus wand
* Saeco Xelsis SUP 038  - black but old, although also a reliable machine, and has one-touch plus wand
* Gaggia Accademia - also old and almost twice the price of the other options, but probably the market leader in its day, and has one touch plus wand

It is mostly my armpits.

In the shower, I scrub my armpits like crazy MULTIPLE times, at least twice, with a hand and exfoliating net, with dove unscented soap. I usually do 2-3 times with the unscented soap, and then another time with regular scented body wash. I swear I find myself having to wash it more than 3 times because I can smell the sweat so strongly! I keep my armpits shaved as well because I find that if I have hair it makes it 10x worse. I feel like no one else around me has to wash their armpits that much because they don’t stink to that extent in the first place. Personally, I haven’t really smelled sweat that strongly on anyone I know, or even at all, especially my girl friends. They’re always so clean! And that’s what’s frustrating, is I feel like I’m clean, cleaner than them sometimes, and I stink.

Moreover, I use a men’s degree antiperspirant, and I try not to put it on before bed because I know the importance of allowing your skin to breathe, and don’t want to consistently have aluminum, cancer-causing product on my armpits. But, if I shower at night and don’t put deodorant on, the next morning I already don’t smell fresh— I smell like sweat, and it just gets worse throughout the day unless I shower or wash my armpits in the sink and then apply deodorant.

Recently I incorporated hibiclens in my routine which is the only thing that immediately removes the smell, which makes sense, it’s antibacterial. But I don’t want to use it every single day as I don’t want to develop resistance to bacteria! Anyway, it feels unfair that I have to go this extra step just to smell FRESH when I swear no one else around me has this issue. So is there something I’m missing? I was never taught basic hygiene but what if I’m missing a very obvious step.

I can be sitting at home doing nothing all day and I smell so bad. And, if I put on deodorant, it mixes with the bacteria eventually and mixes with the deodorant scent and then it smells foul as well. It also accentuates the deodorant scent compared to when I first put on the antiperspirant. I find that I especially smell bad if I AM just sitting at home doing nothing, I’m like sweating through my armpits and can never rewear pajamas more than once because they stink like sweat from one night, even if I showered the night before. Everyone around me rewears their sleep shirts and pajamas multiple times, even when lounging in them at home all day. When I tan outside in the sun it’s also a really bad smell. When I was younger I considered I had hyperhydrosis because I would literally be so sweaty 24/7 and I would smell bad because of it, but I feel that it’s calmed down a ton since I’ve gotten older.

I feel like it really is bad when I’m lounging at home, doing nothing, with my arms pressed up against my body. It’s like stress sweat almost except I’m not stressed.. it’s a lot less of an issue when I get dressed and ready for the day and I’m out and about doing things all day. Sounds so counterintuitive but that’s how it is! And that’s why I don’t get it. Shouldn’t I smell less if I’m just laying on my bed or couch in my pajamas, relaxing?

Oh, and my diet is pretty healthy, not too many spices, I mainly stick to just salt. I eat mainly Whole Foods, a lot of things like plain yogurt, protein, basic veggies, olive oil, avocado, other fruit, coffee and tea.

My mother now needs some help managing her life and her affairs. She treats my brother as extremely capable and me as totally unable. My brother has told her I’m fully capable and has asked me to take on things she gives to him. 

It’s become quite extreme. 

Recently, an item broke in her house. It was a complicated repair because of the design. I figured out a solution and offered to fix it. 

She said okay… but then insisted we ask my brother. He said my plan was brilliant and he wouldn’t have thought of it. He kindly helped get supplies for me to fix it… and it went great between him and I. I carried out the repair as my mother requested. 

Throughout the repair my mother was constantly saying we should call my brother and ask if I was doing it right. She made it clear she didn’t think I could do things like apply glue to wood correctly, but he would know. She constantly does this. If I’m washing dishes she challenges how I’m doing it. If he is doing it, she thanks him profusely. Even if he does it worse and etc. 

She cuts me down so much her grandkids say to me “Grandma doesn’t think you can do anything.” 

Recently she told grandkids under 10 that she didn’t think I could buy coffee correctly unless she or THEY (children) came and did it with me. She was truly serious and we all nervous laughed. 

The constant messages that she sees me as incapable are constant anytime I am around her.  I recently went to purchase an item at the store. I asked the clerk a routine question. She was with me, interrupted, cut us both off to tell me to be quiet and listen and not ask the question. 

As if I was 5. 

I have asked her many times to stop. She doesn’t. 

I am at a breaking point on a regular basis lately over this. My brother can’t care for all that she needs and she’s not yet at the point of increased professional help (and cost is an issue.) 

I love her and we get along well in other ways, as long as I’m not doing something for her to cut down. 

But I can’t keep going as is. 

Any suggestions?

He wore dress clothes with his tie loosened, and she looked radiant in a lacey green ballgown. They’d been smiling and laughing for hours. With a big smile on her face, she rested her head on Wyatt’s shoulder. “You know, I didn’t think there were any men like you left.” Wyatt turned his head to look at the top of hers.

“What does that mean? Men like me?” Lindsey placed a hand on Wyatt’s chest.

“Oh, just men who have their lives’ figured out and know how to treat a lady.” As Lindsey planted a kiss on his lips, Wyatt couldn’t help but smile.

“Don’t give me too much credit, I’ve got a ten-thousand-sun sentence to serve in the Scramble.” The words felt wrong the moment he said them, like a foreign language his mouth knew but his mind didn’t. “The Scramble? Ten-thousand suns? What am I even talking about?” Wyatt looked into the eyes of his girlfriend as a look of worry formed on her face.

“Are you alright dear? You’re speaking gibberish.” Wyatt shot up from the couch. He began pacing the spacious living room, his dress shoes silent on the carpet. Visions flashed: Cupid’s robes, the desperate faces of the lizard folk, endless dunes swallowing the sky. Lindsey nervously fidgeted with her bracelets as she twisted her neck to follow Wyatt’s movements. He was muttering now, trying to piece together the fragmentary memories into something cohesive.

“No. No. This isn’t real. You’re not real.” Wyatt’s eyes were wide as panic rose in his voice. “No, you left me after I let your mother die and drove your father to the same fate.” Lindsey couldn’t take anymore. She stood from the couch, still nursing her bracelet.

“Wyatt, what are you talking about? You’re scaring me.” He walked around the couch, stopping in front of her and grabbing her shoulders.

“I’m trapped in a dream, Lindsey, and things are happening in the Scramble that I need to stop!” The look of concern in her face morphed into one of pity and she wrapped her arms around him, pressing the side of her face to his chest.

“You poor man. How hard are they working you at the bank?” She helped him to sit back down on the couch before turning to walk to the kitchen. “I’m gonna make us some coffee and then we’re gonna make sense of this, okay?” She lingered for a moment, rubbing his back as Wyatt stared straight ahead, haunted by visions of blood and death in the dunes. He began running through all the possibilities in his head, keeping track of inscrutable details with the movement of his hands.

“Is it possible I served my sentence and now I get a chance to do this all over again?” Wyatt pressed his fingers to his temples, his face betraying his exasperation. “How did I get here?” He tried desperately to retrace the last events he experienced in the Scramble. He recalled the faces of Narro and Labellum and the face of his master Texo teaching him the lessons in the dizzying halls of the temple in Vorago. He remembered his confrontation with Cupid and the way the lizard folk had ripped each other apart over scraps of food on the grey sands.

Lindsey returned with a mug of coffee as Wyatt was deep in his own mind. The click of the mug touching the glass-topped coffee table nearly made him jump out of his skin. She sat down beside him on the couch, crossing her legs and leaning his direction. “Now, why don’t you tell me what’s bothering you, mister Wyatt.” A loving smile curled the edges of her mouth. Wyatt stared into the rippling coffee in the mug. He licked his lips as it occurred to him just how thirsty he was. He picked up the steaming cup of coffee and downed the liquid as quickly as he could; the scorching brew scalding his tongue and throat. Once the cup was empty, he let it fall to the couch beside him and turned to face Lindsey. Her look of concern was back.

“Lindsey, I am so sorry.” Wyatt lowered himself off the couch and onto one knee, grasping Lindsey’s hands in his own. “I’m not sure what this is, but I know that if you stay with me, it will be the ruin of your family.” His eyes were wild and full of remorse as tears formed at their edges. She looked down into his eyes, the look of concern becoming one of understanding.

“Is that what you’re worried about? My mom already loves you and my dad will warm up to you in time. You are dating his baby girl you know?” The smile returned to her face as she rubbed the top of his hands.

“No, you don’t understand!” Wyatt was yelling now as he rose to his feet, letting Lindey’s hands fall away from his own. “If this is real, then I’m about to deny your father the loan that could’ve saved your mother’s life!” All of his memories of his life before the Scramble were back, he could see it all. Lindsey stood now too, the coffee mug clattering to the floor.

“Wyatt, you’re scaring me!” She took a few timid steps back reaching for the phone on the wall. “I’m just going to call someone who will be able to help okay?” He lowered himself onto the floor with a sigh, sitting cross-legged and holding his head in his hands.

“Please do, I’d love to meet the person who can help with this.” A sharp pain split Wyatt’s mind as a flood of recollection came rushing back. He remembered the flesh cave and his battle with Metus. He remembered how Audax had placed the flesh over his face and cast a sideways glace over his shoulder as he carried Metus’s crumpled form over his shoulder and out of the membrane. When he looked up to Lindsey again, it wasn’t her standing there anymore but the colorless shadow of the Whisperer. The room dimmed, colors draining from the edges. Her skin blurred, melted into pale mist. The green ballgown unraveled like fog in the morning sun.

“I’m afraid you’re beyond help now, Wyatt.” The shadow wavered like a rippling pond. “What happened? Did the guilt finally get the better of you? Did you decide to submit yourself to the punishment you deserve?” The slinking white void on the floor became a pool of nothingness around Wyatt’s feet and then stretched into a cylinder all around him. “Well…Wanderer?” The words were laced with venom. Wyatt placed his hands on the white surrounding him.

“No! I’ve vowed to atone for what I’ve done!” His eyes were wild with fury. “I was forced into… whatever this is!” He hung his head. “There’s no telling how long I’ve been in here.”

“I can tell you,” the Whisperer chimed, giddy as a schoolboy. “It’s been two-thousand seven-hundred and six-- make that seven suns!” The white shadow retracted to a circle on the high ceiling of the living room.

“Nearly three-thousand suns?” Wyatt looked at his hands. What has become of the Scramble in that time? I’ve been away for years trapped in this dream!” The shadow enveloped the entire room rendering everything blank.

“If you really want to see, I can show you. I hear a couple of former wanderers have been making big plays while you’ve been away, Imber.” The syllables of his name had the most mockery placed on them, as if his entire existence was a joke. Wyatt balled his fists as his eyes narrowed, a growing fear creeping up his spine.

“Show me.” He had to force the words from his throat.

“If you insist.” Came the Whisperer’s reply. “I doubt you’ll like what you see.” An echoing laughter erupted from all around Wyatt as the blank colors of the white void he stood in exploded into color. It was the desert, but it was different than he remembered. There was a great river flowing through the dunes and date palms growing at irregular intervals all along its banks. Among the trees were scores of starvers using crude instruments made of scrap to dig irrigation canals in between mounds of sand that were sprouting their first green.

“What is this?” Wyatt asked dumbfounded. “No… this can’t be the Scramble. Where are the ruins? The hunger? The ash?” He turned, eyes wild. “Show me the truth, deceiver!” His voice echoed back in his ears louder than it had been when he spoke the words. The Whisperer’s laughter came again.

“I’m afraid this is the truth of the matter, dear Wanderer.” Wyatt watched as a few well-fed and maroon-robed people began lashing starvers with baskets atop their heads screaming.

“Pick up the pace you lazy wretches! We’ll never meet the emperor’s demands at this rate. You want to eat, don’t you?” Every crack of the whip made Wyatt wince and set his teeth on edge.

“This is much better than anything I had planned for you!” The Whisperer’s laughter was the final straw and set Wyatt to raving.

“Tell me how to get out of here!” He flung himself against the wall only for it to retract, sending him flopping to the floor. He let out a cry of rage, his throat straining under the weight of the emotion. All the while the laughter mocked him, keeping his blood at a boil. “What do you get out of this anyway?” The laughter stopped now and the scene on the walls froze. The white figure of the shadow appeared before Wyatt.

“This is just my job, Wanderer.” He stepped toward Wyatt and extended his hand, like it was the most natural thing in the world. Wyatt’s face contorted in a mixture of confusion and defiance as he looked at the hand and chose to push himself off the ground. He met the blank face of the Whisperer with his angry stare. “I infiltrate your subconscious mind, and I punish you with your own guilt. The Scramble makes it ever so easy; all anyone has to do is sit and think about what they’ve done.” The blank space paced on the unmoving sands. “You ask me what I get. I get the satisfaction of being the instrument of punishment for the wicked hearts of mortals; that’s what I get.”

“Let me out of here, shadow. You said yourself that I wasn’t bad enough to sunder.”

“About that…” the Whisperer stopped his pacing and turned to look at Wyatt once more. “I was only saving face with that one. The fates would never let me disrupt their precious cycle by destroying you. No, that’s another Wanderer’s job. Speaking of other wanderers…” The shadow raised a pointed finger and spun on its heels, directing the scene on the walls like a symphony conductor. “Let’s have a look at what your predecessors have been up to.”

The purple sun burned hot against the starvers’ skin, and the sand beneath their feet scorched just as fiercely. The men and women in maroon robes brandished rusted weapons of every kind, herding the emaciated into tight ranks near the wall. Only now was the dying river's trickle reaching this stretch of desert, and Audax had come in person to oversee the acquisition, his largest slave haul yet. He turned to his right hand, Metus, as they watched the starvers get funneled upstream toward his seat of power, their makeshift chains clinking with every step.  “It’s been a long time since I faced the Whisperer. Are you certain I won’t have to do it again?”

The great ferret watched the water glinting through the dunes, a prideful shimmer returning to his eyes that hadn’t been there in ages. “Absolutely sure! I lived in there for hundreds of years and never heard so much as a peep; not until that tendril got me. Still not sure how that happened,” Metus muttered, scratching his chin in puzzlement.

“Alright then. Feel like paying a visit to the high lizard himself?” Metus snapped to attention.

“You mean Texo? I mean… the lizard folk would definitely help with my generation engines, but he killed the Odium. Not even I could do that. And I made it! Well… inadvertently, but still.” He kicked at the sand, eyes downcast. Audax gave him a sideways glance, then pinched the bridge of his nose and sighed.

“We’ve been over this, Metus. We kill Texo, you get your lackeys, and we make the desert a paradise. Try not to forget again. I know how scrambled that brain of yours is.” He clapped the ferret hard on the back. Metus jolted, snapping out of his fog. “Let’s do this.”

They slid down the dunes, nodding to passing enforcers in maroon robes. At the wall’s membranous threshold, Audax gestured with a grin. “Age before beauty.”

“Ha! Good one!” Metus smirked; then hesitated as he stepped through the flesh. Audax followed into the humid air of the flesh cave. As they passed the spot where Imber’s katana jutted from the wall, Metus’ nose wrinkled. “What’s that doing here?” He pointed, but Audax pushed his face forward with a firm hand.

“Not what we’re here for. Focus, ferret.” Metus shrank back like a chastised child.

“Sorry, Audax.” The rhino sighed again, his contempt clear. They passed into Vorago. The bustle and music stopped. Lizards and mechanical beasts paused mid-motion to stare at the strangers as they ascended the white cobbled streets. Only the steady rhythm of footsteps and the hum of the void echoed around them.

“They must not get visitors often,” Audax murmured. Metus looked to Audax, but the rhino didn’t return the glance.

“We’re approaching the temple. Be on guard.” Metus straightened, face hardening. The massive columns of the temple seemed to hold up the void itself. The two stopped at the base of the marble steps. Footsteps echoed within. Texo appeared, arms folded into his blue robes, katana tucked into the rope belt at his waist. He stopped at the top of the stairs and spoke calmly.

 “Hello, Metus.” He gave a nod to the ferret who returned it, forgetting for a moment what he was here to do. “You I don’t know,” Texo said, eyes shifting to Audax. “Care to introduce yourself?” Audax removed his iron hat, set it beside him, and with one fluid motion dropped his robe. Underneath, he wore leather strap armor, just like Cupid once had. Twin chakram hung at his waist. He gripped them.

The rhino man raised his weapons into a fighting stance “My name is Audax. I am emperor of the Great Desert.” He pointed one circular blade at Texo. “Vorago and its people belong to me now. If you’ve got a problem with that…” He dragged the chakram blades against each other, filling the air with a slow, metallic screech. “I’ll gladly fight you about it.” A vile smirk curled the corners of his mouth. Texo scratched his scaled cheek thoughtfully.

“So you’ve thrown in with this warlord, Metus?”

The ferret stepped forward. “We’re building a better world for everyone. Audax’s river machine, my generation engines... No more suffering.”

Texo turned his attention back to Audax. “You’re the one who passed the mantle to Imber, my pupil. I haven’t seen him in some time. Do you know what became of him?”

Audax snorted, steam rising from his nostrils. “I’d be a little more concerned with your imminent death if I were you!” The ground quaked. A burst of force erupted from the rhino. Above his head, a flaming halo sparked to life, a barbed double helix of wire. Metus followed suit. His heart-and-crossbones symbol roared to life as bone spikes burst from his palms. The pair crouched into low stances. The air grew thick, humming with tension and static.

“If fate wills it, you may strike me down today.” Texo unsheathed his katana, holding it firm in front of him at the top of the stairs. “But you will not do so easily.” The lightning bolt halo flared to life over the old lizard’s head, a yellow glint flashing in his eyes.

Audax let out a furious cry as he charged up the stairs, blades raised. Metus darted to flank Texo, bounding up the opposite side with bone spikes poised to skewer. The air shimmered with malice and momentum as Texo surged down between them, a ripple of sparks trailing in his wake.

Audax swung in a wide arc, his chakram clashing with the katana in a burst of steel. Behind him, Metus roared, thrusting a spike toward Texo’s exposed back.

Audax smirked as their eyes locked, waiting for the impact. But Texo pushed off Audax’s blade with a sudden burst of strength, breaking the clash and springing into the air. The bone spike swept harmlessly beneath his feet.

Momentum carried Metus forward, forcing Audax to raise a chakram to block the misfired strike. The ferret’s eyes widened in surprise. The rhino only frowned. Texo landed a few paces away, giving his katana a sharp sling that rang like a tuning fork.

“You’ll just keep getting in my way if we fight together,” Audax said, casting a sidelong glance at Metus. “You soften him up. I’ll land the kill.” Metus gave a quick nod and launched himself forward with a flipping leap. Steel met bone again as Texo parried each strike with swift precision. When Metus pressed in, Texo countered with a heavy overhead slash. Metus raised his spikes in an X-formation to intercept.

Texo shifted his footing slightly, and in one fluid motion delivered a brutal kick to Metus’s gut. The ferret staggered back, clutching his middle.

“You bastard,” he snarled through clenched teeth. “You’ll pay for that.” Raising his bone spikes before his face, he watched chunks fall away, disintegrating before they hit the ground. What remained were serrated bone blades, twitching with hunger. “Reap what you sow!” A green flame blazed to life around him as he lunged once more.

The ferret’s fury had multiplied. Each wild swing carried a gleam of madness that forced Texo to retreat, blocking strike after strike.

Metus barked a word with each blow: “You. Think. You’re. So. High. And. Mighty.” He paused. Texo held his stance but lowered his gaze, just for a moment. “Block this one!” Both bone blades came down in a brutal double strike. Texo raised his katana, but the blades bit into the grooves. Metus twisted and wrenched, and the katana shattered in a spray of silver shards. Texo stared down at what remained in his hands, a jagged remnant, no longer a blade but still a weapon.

“Damn,” he muttered. Flipping it in his hand, he settled into a new stance: modified, efficient, lethal. Metus was grinning now, vibrating with pride, nearly looking to Audax for praise.

“Not so scary without your katana, are you?” he taunted, scraping the serrated bones together.

Texo didn’t flinch. His lightning halo surged overhead, and a bolt cracked, showering sparks in all directions. Metus tensed, his smirk faltering. From the base of the stairs, Audax watched with arms folded, silent. “Strike like lightning!” Texo commanded. The words reverberated unnaturally; then Texo vanished, streaking forward in a blur of yellow light.

In an instant, he was crouched before Metus, sweeping low with a kick aimed to take the legs. Metus blocked it just in time. Another flash. Texo reappeared mid-spin, backfist stabbing toward the ferret’s skull. Again, barely blocked.

Metus swung one blade for Texo’s neck, but the lizard was already gone, replaced by a fading column of sparks. In the same breath, Texo was crouched in front of the ferret once again, but this time his kick aimed upward. The heel of his sandaled foot caught Metus on the chin and sent him hurtling upward with great speed. The ferret flew, yelping in pain, limbs flailing uselessly.

Another flash. Texo was above him in midair. The jagged remnant of his katana plunged into Metus’s chest, followed by a brutal elbow that cracked ribs and drew blood. The ferret plummeted; crashing into the stairs with an impact that left a crater in the marble. Audax remained still, arms folded, unmoved by the spectacle.

A bright light came from Texo’s position in the air. A bolt of lightning struck the ground below him. When the flash subsided, the old lizard was left standing in its wake, staring a hole through the stoic rhino.

“I believe that makes it your turn, emperor.” Texo grinned slightly as he said the last word, and it hit its mark. Audax’s nostrils flared, steam hissing out in thick jets.

“You’re that eager to die? So be it.” The rhino gripped his chakram tightly, the curved edges gleaming with menace. His halo blazed white-hot as he scraped his hoof across the cobbled ground, bracing for a charge. Texo’s own halo roared in response. Thunder echoed in his mind.

“I am the storm.” Texo said softly to himself as he pushed off the ground. The twitch of his legs triggered a shockwave. He moved like lightning. Audax barreled toward him in answer, his pounding steps shaking the earth. The space between them vanished in an instant. Steel flashed, chakram and broken katana whirling, clashing. Every strike met a block. Every flourish met resistance. Steam rose around them, swirling into a cyclone as they fought, a maelstrom of muscle, steel, and fire.

Their weapons locked. “I am the emperor of the sands!” Audax snarled through gritted teeth. “Lord of all the Scramble! I will not be bested!”

Texo narrowed his eyes. “I unleashed a tyrant on the dunes once before,” he said, pushing harder into the deadlock. “I won’t make that mistake again.” In a burst of yellow light, he vanished, then reappeared behind Audax, ramming the jagged blade into the rhino’s back. Audax lurched forward with a roar, arms straining for the hilt. A violent shockwave erupted from him, blowing the steam vortex apart. He spun around, fury in his eyes, and seized Texo by the throat. Texo had no time to resist. He flew through the air like a ragdoll, but flipped mid-flight and landed on his feet, staggering slightly.       

Audax ripped the blade from his back. Blood welled and the wound steamed shut. “That was low, lizard. Stabbing me from behind?” He spat on the ground and tossed the ruined weapon aside. Metus staggered over from the rubble, dazed but standing. He rubbed his temples, then limped to stand beside his emperor. Texo took a fighting stance: open palms forward, feet narrow and ready.        

“Might take both of us to get this done, boss,” Metus muttered.

“I hate to admit it,” Audax growled, eyes never leaving Texo. “But you’re right. Hit him with everything you’ve got.”

“You got it.” Metus began cracking his knuckles one by one as Audax stepped forward, arms wide.

“Is that all you’ve got, old lizard? Show me a real challenge!” He smirked outwardly, but inside, his stomach churned with envy at Texo’s skill. His rage burned. He saw fields aflame and burning houses; terrified starvers running from their huts consumed by the conflagration. “I burn like fire!” Texo flashed forward, a bolt of yellow light aimed straight for the rhino’s chest. In the same instant, Audax took a great leap forward, seeing the world as though consumed in flames, he was able to spot Texo moving at great speeds with ease. He raised a great bestial hand catching Texo’s head in it taking the lizard completely by surprise. He used the momentum of his leap to drive the back of the old lizard’s head into the white cobbled stones of the road with a massive boom.

The ground cracked beneath them from the impact, scattering stones and rubble. Audax staggered back, breathing hard. He raised one massive foot, ready to crush the lizard’s skull. But a flash of blinding light and Texo was on his feet. He clutched his head, one eye shut, blood on his face. His breaths were ragged, desperate. But he stood.

From behind Audax, the grotesque form of a transformed Metus leapt, his halo now a scythe blade cutting across the black of the void like a meteor. The ferret abomination launched into a flurry of strikes. Texo dodged desperately, every ounce of his will poured into survival. He closed his eyes. His breathing slowed. Second sight took over. Electric lines of force traced the world before him. Clouds of thought gathered, raining bolts on a mental landscape of dunes. Glass discs exploded like landmines in the sand.

Above, Texo’s halo pulsed brighter. Lightning danced along his limbs. He opened his eyes, calm and focused. His movements were expert: crouching, jumping, and turning his body in all sorts of ways never letting a single blow land.

The crackle of electricity reached a crescendo as Texo’s kick landed square in the center of Metus’s chest. The ferret staggered backward, sliding to Audax’s side. Lightning coursed through his body, his bones flickering beneath his skin like strobe-lit shadows. Texo stood firm in a sideways stance; one arm raised at a right angle, the other loose at his side. Overhead, dark clouds began to gather, nearly indistinguishable against the starless sky of Vorago.

Audax and Metus looked up, unease flickering across their faces. “Things are about to get a lot more interesting,” Audax muttered, half amused, half apprehensive. Metus smacked out a patch of fire smoldering on his chest. He tried to speak, but the top of his skull still hung loose, draped over his upper back like a grotesque cape. His words came out as a garbled rasp, his tongue twitching wildly. Audax grimaced. “Don’t try to talk while you’re like that, Metus.” The ferret’s cracked head bobbled weakly in what passed for agreement.

Texo raised a charged hand over his head, electricity coiling around his fingers. The clouds pulsed in response. With a roar of thunder, a bolt of lightning shot down at Audax. The rhino barely sidestepped it: blinded by the flash, deafened by the blast, only to feel a brutal chop land across the back of his neck. Texo stood behind him, wreathed in golden sparks. Audax collapsed, smoldering, stunned. Before Metus could react, Texo was already upon him, unleashing a furious barrage of punches and kicks. Each blow crackled with voltage, bolts arcing off Metus’s body as the strikes locked him in place.

A cage of lightning formed around the ferret. Texo summoned a glowing orb between his palms. It stretched and morphed into a gleaming sheet, which draped over the crackling bars, sealing the prison. Metus’s halo extinguished. The bone scythe fizzled out. His mutated body began to revert; bones realigning, skin reknitting, skull snapping back into place. He stared at Texo from behind the cage. Texo, breathing hard, let his own halo fade. He folded his arms into the tattered blue sleeves of his robes.

“Warden of the Wall. Right hand of Death,” he said evenly. “I’ve studied your life. All that righteousness, so blind you couldn’t see who you were hurting.” Metus straightened, offended.

“Name one person I hurt! All I ever did was try to make the Scramble bearable. It’s not my fault they misused my creations!” Texo shook his head, shadows and sparks dancing across his scales.

“I’ll name one. Me.” His voice cracked with fury now. “My people lived peacefully in the forest until you brought that thing down on us!” His scales shifted in waves of red, orange, yellow. “It didn’t just kill us. There was no resurrection at dawn. It erased our souls! Whatever madness brought the Odium into this world, I know it started with your machines!”

Metus folded his arms with a huff. “You still haven’t told me how that’s my fault.” Texo waved his hand. The lightning cage exploded in a burst of gold.

Before Metus could react, the old lizard grabbed him by the scruff and yanked him close. “There were people who deserved a second chance who lost everything because of that abomination! You saw the smog. You saw the acid raining from the sky. You knew! And still, you built more.” Metus gagged in Texo’s grasp, eyes bulging.

“I… thought I was ending the conflict…” Texo sighed and released him.

“Maybe you were.” He paused. “Maybe we’re all just doing our best in this hell.” Their eyes met. “Even so, I want you to take your friend and get—” A crack echoed through the air. Texo gasped, eyes wide. A horn now jutted from his chest. He collapsed. Blood spilled onto the white stone beneath him.

Audax stood behind, cloth in hand, calmly wiping gore from his horn. “Shall we, Metus?” The ferret nodded. They reignited their halos in unison. Metus’s bone blades sprouted from his arms once more. A ring of fire erupted around Texo’s body.

The old lizard’s eyes fluttered closed, and his final words came as a whisper. “I’m sorry, my children… I’m sorry, Imber.” A tear slid down his cheek, sizzling away in the heat. “I’m sorry… Cupid.”

Metus laughed maniacally as he tore into the lizard, carving him apart, flinging blood and viscera in every direction. The stench of burning flesh filled the air. “Burn away!” Audax roared, as the flames roared into a bonfire, incinerating what remained of Texo. The two stood silently for a moment, watching the inferno. Then Audax turned to Metus. “Have the enforcers round up the lizard folk.”",1,1752025187.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

He wore dress clothes with his tie loosened, and she looked radiant in a lacey green ballgown. They’d been smiling and laughing for hours. With a big smile on her face, she rested her head on Wyatt’s shoulder. “You know, I didn’t think there were any men like you left.” Wyatt turned his head to look at the top of hers.

“What does that mean? Men like me?” Lindsey placed a hand on Wyatt’s chest.

“Oh, just men who have their lives’ figured out and know how to treat a lady.” As Lindsey planted a kiss on his lips, Wyatt couldn’t help but smile.

“Don’t give me too much credit, I’ve got a ten-thousand-sun sentence to serve in the Scramble.” The words felt wrong the moment he said them, like a foreign language his mouth knew but his mind didn’t. “The Scramble? Ten-thousand suns? What am I even talking about?” Wyatt looked into the eyes of his girlfriend as a look of worry formed on her face.

“Are you alright dear? You’re speaking gibberish.” Wyatt shot up from the couch. He began pacing the spacious living room, his dress shoes silent on the carpet. Visions flashed: Cupid’s robes, the desperate faces of the lizard folk, endless dunes swallowing the sky. Lindsey nervously fidgeted with her bracelets as she twisted her neck to follow Wyatt’s movements. He was muttering now, trying to piece together the fragmentary memories into something cohesive.

“No. No. This isn’t real. You’re not real.” Wyatt’s eyes were wide as panic rose in his voice. “No, you left me after I let your mother die and drove your father to the same fate.” Lindsey couldn’t take anymore. She stood from the couch, still nursing her bracelet.

“Wyatt, what are you talking about? You’re scaring me.” He walked around the couch, stopping in front of her and grabbing her shoulders.

“I’m trapped in a dream, Lindsey, and things are happening in the Scramble that I need to stop!” The look of concern in her face morphed into one of pity and she wrapped her arms around him, pressing the side of her face to his chest.

“You poor man. How hard are they working you at the bank?” She helped him to sit back down on the couch before turning to walk to the kitchen. “I’m gonna make us some coffee and then we’re gonna make sense of this, okay?” She lingered for a moment, rubbing his back as Wyatt stared straight ahead, haunted by visions of blood and death in the dunes. He began running through all the possibilities in his head, keeping track of inscrutable details with the movement of his hands.

“Is it possible I served my sentence and now I get a chance to do this all over again?” Wyatt pressed his fingers to his temples, his face betraying his exasperation. “How did I get here?” He tried desperately to retrace the last events he experienced in the Scramble. He recalled the faces of Narro and Labellum and the face of his master Texo teaching him the lessons in the dizzying halls of the temple in Vorago. He remembered his confrontation with Cupid and the way the lizard folk had ripped each other apart over scraps of food on the grey sands.

Lindsey returned with a mug of coffee as Wyatt was deep in his own mind. The click of the mug touching the glass-topped coffee table nearly made him jump out of his skin. She sat down beside him on the couch, crossing her legs and leaning his direction. “Now, why don’t you tell me what’s bothering you, mister Wyatt.” A loving smile curled the edges of her mouth. Wyatt stared into the rippling coffee in the mug. He licked his lips as it occurred to him just how thirsty he was. He picked up the steaming cup of coffee and downed the liquid as quickly as he could; the scorching brew scalding his tongue and throat. Once the cup was empty, he let it fall to the couch beside him and turned to face Lindsey. Her look of concern was back.

“Lindsey, I am so sorry.” Wyatt lowered himself off the couch and onto one knee, grasping Lindsey’s hands in his own. “I’m not sure what this is, but I know that if you stay with me, it will be the ruin of your family.” His eyes were wild and full of remorse as tears formed at their edges. She looked down into his eyes, the look of concern becoming one of understanding.

“Is that what you’re worried about? My mom already loves you and my dad will warm up to you in time. You are dating his baby girl you know?” The smile returned to her face as she rubbed the top of his hands.

“No, you don’t understand!” Wyatt was yelling now as he rose to his feet, letting Lindey’s hands fall away from his own. “If this is real, then I’m about to deny your father the loan that could’ve saved your mother’s life!” All of his memories of his life before the Scramble were back, he could see it all. Lindsey stood now too, the coffee mug clattering to the floor.

“Wyatt, you’re scaring me!” She took a few timid steps back reaching for the phone on the wall. “I’m just going to call someone who will be able to help okay?” He lowered himself onto the floor with a sigh, sitting cross-legged and holding his head in his hands.

“Please do, I’d love to meet the person who can help with this.” A sharp pain split Wyatt’s mind as a flood of recollection came rushing back. He remembered the flesh cave and his battle with Metus. He remembered how Audax had placed the flesh over his face and cast a sideways glace over his shoulder as he carried Metus’s crumpled form over his shoulder and out of the membrane. When he looked up to Lindsey again, it wasn’t her standing there anymore but the colorless shadow of the Whisperer. The room dimmed, colors draining from the edges. Her skin blurred, melted into pale mist. The green ballgown unraveled like fog in the morning sun.

“I’m afraid you’re beyond help now, Wyatt.” The shadow wavered like a rippling pond. “What happened? Did the guilt finally get the better of you? Did you decide to submit yourself to the punishment you deserve?” The slinking white void on the floor became a pool of nothingness around Wyatt’s feet and then stretched into a cylinder all around him. “Well…Wanderer?” The words were laced with venom. Wyatt placed his hands on the white surrounding him.

“No! I’ve vowed to atone for what I’ve done!” His eyes were wild with fury. “I was forced into… whatever this is!” He hung his head. “There’s no telling how long I’ve been in here.”

“I can tell you,” the Whisperer chimed, giddy as a schoolboy. “It’s been two-thousand seven-hundred and six-- make that seven suns!” The white shadow retracted to a circle on the high ceiling of the living room.

“Nearly three-thousand suns?” Wyatt looked at his hands. What has become of the Scramble in that time? I’ve been away for years trapped in this dream!” The shadow enveloped the entire room rendering everything blank.

“If you really want to see, I can show you. I hear a couple of former wanderers have been making big plays while you’ve been away, Imber.” The syllables of his name had the most mockery placed on them, as if his entire existence was a joke. Wyatt balled his fists as his eyes narrowed, a growing fear creeping up his spine.

“Show me.” He had to force the words from his throat.

“If you insist.” Came the Whisperer’s reply. “I doubt you’ll like what you see.” An echoing laughter erupted from all around Wyatt as the blank colors of the white void he stood in exploded into color. It was the desert, but it was different than he remembered. There was a great river flowing through the dunes and date palms growing at irregular intervals all along its banks. Among the trees were scores of starvers using crude instruments made of scrap to dig irrigation canals in between mounds of sand that were sprouting their first green.

“What is this?” Wyatt asked dumbfounded. “No… this can’t be the Scramble. Where are the ruins? The hunger? The ash?” He turned, eyes wild. “Show me the truth, deceiver!” His voice echoed back in his ears louder than it had been when he spoke the words. The Whisperer’s laughter came again.

“I’m afraid this is the truth of the matter, dear Wanderer.” Wyatt watched as a few well-fed and maroon-robed people began lashing starvers with baskets atop their heads screaming.

“Pick up the pace you lazy wretches! We’ll never meet the emperor’s demands at this rate. You want to eat, don’t you?” Every crack of the whip made Wyatt wince and set his teeth on edge.

“This is much better than anything I had planned for you!” The Whisperer’s laughter was the final straw and set Wyatt to raving.

“Tell me how to get out of here!” He flung himself against the wall only for it to retract, sending him flopping to the floor. He let out a cry of rage, his throat straining under the weight of the emotion. All the while the laughter mocked him, keeping his blood at a boil. “What do you get out of this anyway?” The laughter stopped now and the scene on the walls froze. The white figure of the shadow appeared before Wyatt.

“This is just my job, Wanderer.” He stepped toward Wyatt and extended his hand, like it was the most natural thing in the world. Wyatt’s face contorted in a mixture of confusion and defiance as he looked at the hand and chose to push himself off the ground. He met the blank face of the Whisperer with his angry stare. “I infiltrate your subconscious mind, and I punish you with your own guilt. The Scramble makes it ever so easy; all anyone has to do is sit and think about what they’ve done.” The blank space paced on the unmoving sands. “You ask me what I get. I get the satisfaction of being the instrument of punishment for the wicked hearts of mortals; that’s what I get.”

“Let me out of here, shadow. You said yourself that I wasn’t bad enough to sunder.”

“About that…” the Whisperer stopped his pacing and turned to look at Wyatt once more. “I was only saving face with that one. The fates would never let me disrupt their precious cycle by destroying you. No, that’s another Wanderer’s job. Speaking of other wanderers…” The shadow raised a pointed finger and spun on its heels, directing the scene on the walls like a symphony conductor. “Let’s have a look at what your predecessors have been up to.”

The purple sun burned hot against the starvers’ skin, and the sand beneath their feet scorched just as fiercely. The men and women in maroon robes brandished rusted weapons of every kind, herding the emaciated into tight ranks near the wall. Only now was the dying river's trickle reaching this stretch of desert, and Audax had come in person to oversee the acquisition, his largest slave haul yet. He turned to his right hand, Metus, as they watched the starvers get funneled upstream toward his seat of power, their makeshift chains clinking with every step.  “It’s been a long time since I faced the Whisperer. Are you certain I won’t have to do it again?”

The great ferret watched the water glinting through the dunes, a prideful shimmer returning to his eyes that hadn’t been there in ages. “Absolutely sure! I lived in there for hundreds of years and never heard so much as a peep; not until that tendril got me. Still not sure how that happened,” Metus muttered, scratching his chin in puzzlement.

“Alright then. Feel like paying a visit to the high lizard himself?” Metus snapped to attention.

“You mean Texo? I mean… the lizard folk would definitely help with my generation engines, but he killed the Odium. Not even I could do that. And I made it! Well… inadvertently, but still.” He kicked at the sand, eyes downcast. Audax gave him a sideways glance, then pinched the bridge of his nose and sighed.

“We’ve been over this, Metus. We kill Texo, you get your lackeys, and we make the desert a paradise. Try not to forget again. I know how scrambled that brain of yours is.” He clapped the ferret hard on the back. Metus jolted, snapping out of his fog. “Let’s do this.”

They slid down the dunes, nodding to passing enforcers in maroon robes. At the wall’s membranous threshold, Audax gestured with a grin. “Age before beauty.”

“Ha! Good one!” Metus smirked; then hesitated as he stepped through the flesh. Audax followed into the humid air of the flesh cave. As they passed the spot where Imber’s katana jutted from the wall, Metus’ nose wrinkled. “What’s that doing here?” He pointed, but Audax pushed his face forward with a firm hand.

“Not what we’re here for. Focus, ferret.” Metus shrank back like a chastised child.

“Sorry, Audax.” The rhino sighed again, his contempt clear. They passed into Vorago. The bustle and music stopped. Lizards and mechanical beasts paused mid-motion to stare at the strangers as they ascended the white cobbled streets. Only the steady rhythm of footsteps and the hum of the void echoed around them.

“They must not get visitors often,” Audax murmured. Metus looked to Audax, but the rhino didn’t return the glance.

“We’re approaching the temple. Be on guard.” Metus straightened, face hardening. The massive columns of the temple seemed to hold up the void itself. The two stopped at the base of the marble steps. Footsteps echoed within. Texo appeared, arms folded into his blue robes, katana tucked into the rope belt at his waist. He stopped at the top of the stairs and spoke calmly.

 “Hello, Metus.” He gave a nod to the ferret who returned it, forgetting for a moment what he was here to do. “You I don’t know,” Texo said, eyes shifting to Audax. “Care to introduce yourself?” Audax removed his iron hat, set it beside him, and with one fluid motion dropped his robe. Underneath, he wore leather strap armor, just like Cupid once had. Twin chakram hung at his waist. He gripped them.

The rhino man raised his weapons into a fighting stance “My name is Audax. I am emperor of the Great Desert.” He pointed one circular blade at Texo. “Vorago and its people belong to me now. If you’ve got a problem with that…” He dragged the chakram blades against each other, filling the air with a slow, metallic screech. “I’ll gladly fight you about it.” A vile smirk curled the corners of his mouth. Texo scratched his scaled cheek thoughtfully.

“So you’ve thrown in with this warlord, Metus?”

The ferret stepped forward. “We’re building a better world for everyone. Audax’s river machine, my generation engines... No more suffering.”

Texo turned his attention back to Audax. “You’re the one who passed the mantle to Imber, my pupil. I haven’t seen him in some time. Do you know what became of him?”

Audax snorted, steam rising from his nostrils. “I’d be a little more concerned with your imminent death if I were you!” The ground quaked. A burst of force erupted from the rhino. Above his head, a flaming halo sparked to life, a barbed double helix of wire. Metus followed suit. His heart-and-crossbones symbol roared to life as bone spikes burst from his palms. The pair crouched into low stances. The air grew thick, humming with tension and static.

“If fate wills it, you may strike me down today.” Texo unsheathed his katana, holding it firm in front of him at the top of the stairs. “But you will not do so easily.” The lightning bolt halo flared to life over the old lizard’s head, a yellow glint flashing in his eyes.

Audax let out a furious cry as he charged up the stairs, blades raised. Metus darted to flank Texo, bounding up the opposite side with bone spikes poised to skewer. The air shimmered with malice and momentum as Texo surged down between them, a ripple of sparks trailing in his wake.

Audax swung in a wide arc, his chakram clashing with the katana in a burst of steel. Behind him, Metus roared, thrusting a spike toward Texo’s exposed back.

Audax smirked as their eyes locked, waiting for the impact. But Texo pushed off Audax’s blade with a sudden burst of strength, breaking the clash and springing into the air. The bone spike swept harmlessly beneath his feet.

Momentum carried Metus forward, forcing Audax to raise a chakram to block the misfired strike. The ferret’s eyes widened in surprise. The rhino only frowned. Texo landed a few paces away, giving his katana a sharp sling that rang like a tuning fork.

“You’ll just keep getting in my way if we fight together,” Audax said, casting a sidelong glance at Metus. “You soften him up. I’ll land the kill.” Metus gave a quick nod and launched himself forward with a flipping leap. Steel met bone again as Texo parried each strike with swift precision. When Metus pressed in, Texo countered with a heavy overhead slash. Metus raised his spikes in an X-formation to intercept.

Texo shifted his footing slightly, and in one fluid motion delivered a brutal kick to Metus’s gut. The ferret staggered back, clutching his middle.

“You bastard,” he snarled through clenched teeth. “You’ll pay for that.” Raising his bone spikes before his face, he watched chunks fall away, disintegrating before they hit the ground. What remained were serrated bone blades, twitching with hunger. “Reap what you sow!” A green flame blazed to life around him as he lunged once more.

The ferret’s fury had multiplied. Each wild swing carried a gleam of madness that forced Texo to retreat, blocking strike after strike.

Metus barked a word with each blow: “You. Think. You’re. So. High. And. Mighty.” He paused. Texo held his stance but lowered his gaze, just for a moment. “Block this one!” Both bone blades came down in a brutal double strike. Texo raised his katana, but the blades bit into the grooves. Metus twisted and wrenched, and the katana shattered in a spray of silver shards. Texo stared down at what remained in his hands, a jagged remnant, no longer a blade but still a weapon.

“Damn,” he muttered. Flipping it in his hand, he settled into a new stance: modified, efficient, lethal. Metus was grinning now, vibrating with pride, nearly looking to Audax for praise.

“Not so scary without your katana, are you?” he taunted, scraping the serrated bones together.

Texo didn’t flinch. His lightning halo surged overhead, and a bolt cracked, showering sparks in all directions. Metus tensed, his smirk faltering. From the base of the stairs, Audax watched with arms folded, silent. “Strike like lightning!” Texo commanded. The words reverberated unnaturally; then Texo vanished, streaking forward in a blur of yellow light.

In an instant, he was crouched before Metus, sweeping low with a kick aimed to take the legs. Metus blocked it just in time. Another flash. Texo reappeared mid-spin, backfist stabbing toward the ferret’s skull. Again, barely blocked.

Metus swung one blade for Texo’s neck, but the lizard was already gone, replaced by a fading column of sparks. In the same breath, Texo was crouched in front of the ferret once again, but this time his kick aimed upward. The heel of his sandaled foot caught Metus on the chin and sent him hurtling upward with great speed. The ferret flew, yelping in pain, limbs flailing uselessly.

Another flash. Texo was above him in midair. The jagged remnant of his katana plunged into Metus’s chest, followed by a brutal elbow that cracked ribs and drew blood. The ferret plummeted; crashing into the stairs with an impact that left a crater in the marble. Audax remained still, arms folded, unmoved by the spectacle.

A bright light came from Texo’s position in the air. A bolt of lightning struck the ground below him. When the flash subsided, the old lizard was left standing in its wake, staring a hole through the stoic rhino.

“I believe that makes it your turn, emperor.” Texo grinned slightly as he said the last word, and it hit its mark. Audax’s nostrils flared, steam hissing out in thick jets.

“You’re that eager to die? So be it.” The rhino gripped his chakram tightly, the curved edges gleaming with menace. His halo blazed white-hot as he scraped his hoof across the cobbled ground, bracing for a charge. Texo’s own halo roared in response. Thunder echoed in his mind.

“I am the storm.” Texo said softly to himself as he pushed off the ground. The twitch of his legs triggered a shockwave. He moved like lightning. Audax barreled toward him in answer, his pounding steps shaking the earth. The space between them vanished in an instant. Steel flashed, chakram and broken katana whirling, clashing. Every strike met a block. Every flourish met resistance. Steam rose around them, swirling into a cyclone as they fought, a maelstrom of muscle, steel, and fire.

Their weapons locked. “I am the emperor of the sands!” Audax snarled through gritted teeth. “Lord of all the Scramble! I will not be bested!”

Texo narrowed his eyes. “I unleashed a tyrant on the dunes once before,” he said, pushing harder into the deadlock. “I won’t make that mistake again.” In a burst of yellow light, he vanished, then reappeared behind Audax, ramming the jagged blade into the rhino’s back. Audax lurched forward with a roar, arms straining for the hilt. A violent shockwave erupted from him, blowing the steam vortex apart. He spun around, fury in his eyes, and seized Texo by the throat. Texo had no time to resist. He flew through the air like a ragdoll, but flipped mid-flight and landed on his feet, staggering slightly.       

Audax ripped the blade from his back. Blood welled and the wound steamed shut. “That was low, lizard. Stabbing me from behind?” He spat on the ground and tossed the ruined weapon aside. Metus staggered over from the rubble, dazed but standing. He rubbed his temples, then limped to stand beside his emperor. Texo took a fighting stance: open palms forward, feet narrow and ready.        

“Might take both of us to get this done, boss,” Metus muttered.

“I hate to admit it,” Audax growled, eyes never leaving Texo. “But you’re right. Hit him with everything you’ve got.”

“You got it.” Metus began cracking his knuckles one by one as Audax stepped forward, arms wide.

“Is that all you’ve got, old lizard? Show me a real challenge!” He smirked outwardly, but inside, his stomach churned with envy at Texo’s skill. His rage burned. He saw fields aflame and burning houses; terrified starvers running from their huts consumed by the conflagration. “I burn like fire!” Texo flashed forward, a bolt of yellow light aimed straight for the rhino’s chest. In the same instant, Audax took a great leap forward, seeing the world as though consumed in flames, he was able to spot Texo moving at great speeds with ease. He raised a great bestial hand catching Texo’s head in it taking the lizard completely by surprise. He used the momentum of his leap to drive the back of the old lizard’s head into the white cobbled stones of the road with a massive boom.

The ground cracked beneath them from the impact, scattering stones and rubble. Audax staggered back, breathing hard. He raised one massive foot, ready to crush the lizard’s skull. But a flash of blinding light and Texo was on his feet. He clutched his head, one eye shut, blood on his face. His breaths were ragged, desperate. But he stood.

From behind Audax, the grotesque form of a transformed Metus leapt, his halo now a scythe blade cutting across the black of the void like a meteor. The ferret abomination launched into a flurry of strikes. Texo dodged desperately, every ounce of his will poured into survival. He closed his eyes. His breathing slowed. Second sight took over. Electric lines of force traced the world before him. Clouds of thought gathered, raining bolts on a mental landscape of dunes. Glass discs exploded like landmines in the sand.

Above, Texo’s halo pulsed brighter. Lightning danced along his limbs. He opened his eyes, calm and focused. His movements were expert: crouching, jumping, and turning his body in all sorts of ways never letting a single blow land.

The crackle of electricity reached a crescendo as Texo’s kick landed square in the center of Metus’s chest. The ferret staggered backward, sliding to Audax’s side. Lightning coursed through his body, his bones flickering beneath his skin like strobe-lit shadows. Texo stood firm in a sideways stance; one arm raised at a right angle, the other loose at his side. Overhead, dark clouds began to gather, nearly indistinguishable against the starless sky of Vorago.

Audax and Metus looked up, unease flickering across their faces. “Things are about to get a lot more interesting,” Audax muttered, half amused, half apprehensive. Metus smacked out a patch of fire smoldering on his chest. He tried to speak, but the top of his skull still hung loose, draped over his upper back like a grotesque cape. His words came out as a garbled rasp, his tongue twitching wildly. Audax grimaced. “Don’t try to talk while you’re like that, Metus.” The ferret’s cracked head bobbled weakly in what passed for agreement.

Texo raised a charged hand over his head, electricity coiling around his fingers. The clouds pulsed in response. With a roar of thunder, a bolt of lightning shot down at Audax. The rhino barely sidestepped it: blinded by the flash, deafened by the blast, only to feel a brutal chop land across the back of his neck. Texo stood behind him, wreathed in golden sparks. Audax collapsed, smoldering, stunned. Before Metus could react, Texo was already upon him, unleashing a furious barrage of punches and kicks. Each blow crackled with voltage, bolts arcing off Metus’s body as the strikes locked him in place.

A cage of lightning formed around the ferret. Texo summoned a glowing orb between his palms. It stretched and morphed into a gleaming sheet, which draped over the crackling bars, sealing the prison. Metus’s halo extinguished. The bone scythe fizzled out. His mutated body began to revert; bones realigning, skin reknitting, skull snapping back into place. He stared at Texo from behind the cage. Texo, breathing hard, let his own halo fade. He folded his arms into the tattered blue sleeves of his robes.

“Warden of the Wall. Right hand of Death,” he said evenly. “I’ve studied your life. All that righteousness, so blind you couldn’t see who you were hurting.” Metus straightened, offended.

“Name one person I hurt! All I ever did was try to make the Scramble bearable. It’s not my fault they misused my creations!” Texo shook his head, shadows and sparks dancing across his scales.

“I’ll name one. Me.” His voice cracked with fury now. “My people lived peacefully in the forest until you brought that thing down on us!” His scales shifted in waves of red, orange, yellow. “It didn’t just kill us. There was no resurrection at dawn. It erased our souls! Whatever madness brought the Odium into this world, I know it started with your machines!”

Metus folded his arms with a huff. “You still haven’t told me how that’s my fault.” Texo waved his hand. The lightning cage exploded in a burst of gold.

Before Metus could react, the old lizard grabbed him by the scruff and yanked him close. “There were people who deserved a second chance who lost everything because of that abomination! You saw the smog. You saw the acid raining from the sky. You knew! And still, you built more.” Metus gagged in Texo’s grasp, eyes bulging.

“I… thought I was ending the conflict…” Texo sighed and released him.

“Maybe you were.” He paused. “Maybe we’re all just doing our best in this hell.” Their eyes met. “Even so, I want you to take your friend and get—” A crack echoed through the air. Texo gasped, eyes wide. A horn now jutted from his chest. He collapsed. Blood spilled onto the white stone beneath him.

Audax stood behind, cloth in hand, calmly wiping gore from his horn. “Shall we, Metus?” The ferret nodded. They reignited their halos in unison. Metus’s bone blades sprouted from his arms once more. A ring of fire erupted around Texo’s body.

The old lizard’s eyes fluttered closed, and his final words came as a whisper. “I’m sorry, my children… I’m sorry, Imber.” A tear slid down his cheek, sizzling away in the heat. “I’m sorry… Cupid.”

Metus laughed maniacally as he tore into the lizard, carving him apart, flinging blood and viscera in every direction. The stench of burning flesh filled the air. “Burn away!” Audax roared, as the flames roared into a bonfire, incinerating what remained of Texo. The two stood silently for a moment, watching the inferno. Then Audax turned to Metus. “Have the enforcers round up the lizard folk.”",1,1752025125.0,u_Curious-Carpet-3022,0,1.0,False

She splits my brother and I. Our entire lives, in her eyes, he can do nothing bad and I can do nothing right. (That’s how my brother puts it.) My now dead father had a pretty screwed up relationship with all of us, and in many ways, things are easier now that he is gone. 

My mother now needs some help managing her life and her affairs. She treats my brother as extremely capable and me as totally unable. My brother has told her I’m fully capable and has asked me to take on things she gives to him. 

It’s become quite extreme. 

Recently, a shelf broke in her house. It was a complicated repair because of the design. I figured out a solution and offered to fix it. 

She said okay… but then insisted we ask my brother. He said my plan was brilliant and he wouldn’t have thought of it. He helped get supplies and it went great between him and I. I carried out the repair. 

Throughout the repair my mother was constantly saying we should call my brother and ask if I was doing it right. 

She cuts me down so much her grandkids say to me “Grandma doesn’t think you can do anything.” 

Recently she told kids under 10 that she didn’t think I could buy coffee correctly unless she or THEY (children) came and did it with me. 

The constant messages that she sees me as incapable are constant anytime I am around her. 

I recently went to purchase an item at the store. I asked the clerk a routine question. She was with me, interrupted, cut us both off to tell me to be quiet and listen and not ask the question. 

As if I was 5. 

I have asked her many times to stop. She doesn’t. 

I am at a breaking point on a regular basis. 

My brother can’t care for all that she needs and she’s not yet at the point of increased professional help (and cost is an issue.) 

I love her and we get along well in other ways, as long as I’m not doing something for her to cut down. 


But I can’t keep going as is.

Thus I remember hearing a lot of the catchphrases when they first aired, but damned if I could tell you which episode. 
“I Know What I Saw!” “Made in a lab!” Etc.

Well, today I was listening to the Salem Witch Trials series ep. 502 & 503, and in 502 (I think), Ben does his whole “I’m kind of a big dill” bit, and I was like, “Hey! There it is!”
I wished I had a fellow fan there so we could high five or something 😂

Plus with all the Ben hate lately, I just wanna say one reason I relistened to this series was to really see what Ben “brings to the friendship” (yes I know that’s a Henry line). 
And I gotta say, he’s pretty funny in this series. 
No, he possesses neither the quick wit nor the genuine engagement that Ed has blessed us with, but today while I was doing a mindless and tedious task, he genuinely made me laugh. 

Not quite there to a “Hail Ben” yet, if ever, but it was nice to hear a hearty “Megustalations” 🥳",14,1752024828.0,LPOTL,1,0.94,False

Yeah, you read that right.

I know it’s not exactly a normal retirement plan—packing up a beat-up Subaru, stacking up old CDs and gas station coffee, heading into a metropolis everyone warns me about like it’s Gotham on a bad night—but I’ve never been one for conventional choices. And this isn’t just any band. Modest Mouse has been buzzing in the background of my life for decades now. Their songs are like strange little roadmaps to all the weird corners of existence—the way Isaac slurs out a lyric that sounds like nonsense until you realize it’s something deeply poetic about time or God or being stuck in traffic for too long.

There’s just *something* about those jagged, sea-sick guitar riffs and lyrical metaphors that feel like they were written by a desert prophet with a thrift store amp. Their sound is a junkyard symphony, a rusted-out hymn for the over-thinkers and the wanderers. I may be decades older than most of the crowd, but I feel like I’ve always lived in the same psychic trailer park as these songs.

Still—truth be told—I’m nervous. This is Chicago. And yeah, I’ve heard the stories. The kind that echo down through Fox News and neighborhood Facebook groups. “You’re going to *Chicago*? Alone?!” Even my barber looked at me like I’d lost it. And maybe I have a little. But honestly, I think fear is just a tired old excuse not to feel alive. At my age, I’d rather be a little scared doing something that fills my gut with wonder than feel safe rotting on a recliner in a living room full of ‘what-ifs.’

I’ve never seen Modest Mouse live. I missed them when they came to Austin back in the day, and I always told myself I’d catch them “next time.” But let me tell you—there aren’t a lot of next times when you’re 72. You start realizing that regret is a meaner ghost than failure.

So I’m going. One motel at a time. Across cracked Texas highways, through the belly of the Midwest, all the way to a city I’ve only ever known through deep-dish pizza clichés and cable news hysteria. I’ll probably stick out like a sore thumb—old man in a flannel and Docs, quietly mouthing every word to “Cowboy Dan” while the crowd sways around me. But I don’t care.

I’m chasing something that made me feel alive in the most unexplainable way—and honestly, isn’t that what Modest Mouse songs are all about?

Wish me luck.

____

It is at his father’s funeral that he first sees the buffalo. 

It is raining, because it always rains at funerals. Icy drops whipping at his umbrella, wind blowing the slicked plastic cape of a rain-coat about his legs like a clinging shroud. 
The others cluster closer about the grave, black umbrellas bumping up against one another. As the pallbearers lower the coffin into the dark, one slips in the red dirt, catches himself with one hand on the gravestone, looks up sheepishly.

Caught up in the gnarled branches of an oak, a plastic bag flaps in the wind like a struggling bird. The man shuffles his feet in the damp brown grass, spins the umbrella mindlessly in one hand. Drops spiral off, a bright curtain between him and the world. He glances around, careful that his eyes do not fall on the black-laquered coffin resting silent and still in the grave. The others do the same; he knows this implicitly. They are here for appearances - a vain attempt at inheritance or recognition or anything to drag them out of the black pits they have found themselves in. 

He has the feeling that he has come for the same reason. It is his brother’s company now, and perhaps he would like a car or a proper house or a promotion or simply that it might be improper for a man to not come to his own father’s funeral. Especially when his father had given him so much.

There is something strange behind a crypt, and at first he thinks it a shadow, a trick of the light.
He blinks a few times, shakes his head, and the thing clarifies itself; the obscuring ripples of a mirage fading into rough brown fur, curved horns. 
A cow, or a bull, head lowered, flies buzzing about wet brown eyes. One horn is broken at the tip, and it lows as though looking for a lost calf. An escapee from a farm, thinks the man, and briefly considers gesturing at it, getting it to run off back to the barren desert. 
Yet something about it recalls old pictures, a man standing atop a heap of skulls, and at last the man thinks: 

*Buffalo.*

Somewhere in the far distance, a pair of mockingbirds rattles off the sound of gunshots. 
 
 A call-and-response – where are you? Here I am.

Where are you?  —

He turns from the buffalo to stare into the mist and distant glow of neon lights.
At last the priest - a vulture of a man, black rain-coat fluttering around him like dark wings - comes slowly through the mist and rain, stopping beside the gleaming granite marker with the date of death not yet carved into it. He mutters a few inaudible words over the coffin, invites anyone who wishes to speak or reminisce about the deceased, wish him well in his eternal sleep, to come up and do so. 
The man does not speak - apathy seems his mother tongue, and if there is nothing good to say he must say nothing at all.

They stand in silence until at last someone - perhaps his aunt, perhaps a forgotten business partner - steps forward, tosses a handful of damp black dirt into the open grave. Her face is drawn and sullen beneath the shadow of an umbrella, and it reminds him of how his mother looked when the deals fell through.

There is no acknowledgment of the buffalo.

It is fall, so the sky darkens earlier, and between the drifting storm clouds part of Taurus is visible in the eastern sky. There are still people speaking, stepping up one by one to cast dirt into the grave, to tell a story or a joke, reminiscing. The buffalo lies on one side beside the shed, sleeping or shot.
 It really looks like a dead animal, thinks the man.
Its open glassy eyes do not reflect the fading light; they swallow it as though ravenous. 


The man at last steps forward, takes some earth from the pile besides the still-open grave.
Good riddance, he thinks, and tosses the dirt down, watches it scatter atop the rest. It is invisible, unnoticeable, as soon as the last of it lies still. 

Someone faceless and nameless beneath a dark umbrella hands him a carnation, still fresh, droplets of water beading the stem, and that too he drops into the grave. It lands crosswise atop the heaping earth, and for a moment he thinks of leaning down, setting it as it should be - aligned with the grave.
There is an excavator parked just behind the stone, and behind it is a second buffalo, bent, nibbling at the sparse unfertilized grass. A black-bibbed sparrow pauses in its mindless pecking, stares wonderingly up at the buffalo with small dark eyes.

——

He is stopped at a light, the radio playing staticy jazz, and besides him on the median is an elderly man with a bushy Santa beard and a sign warning of the end-times. The rain is drumming staccato on the car roof, and the man is watching two drops stained red with the glow of the traffic lights race down the windshield when the proselytizer raps on his car window. The proselytizer knocks once, twice, grins so that the man can see the gaps between his yellowed teeth. He pinches a dampened cigar between two fat fingers, puffing every so often at it even though it cannot have been lit. 

It is raining and wretched, and at last the man rolls down his window, wordlessly presses a crumpled ten-dollar bill through the crack. 

‘Have you seen the face of God?,’ asks the proselytizer. He does not take the bill. The clear plastic of his raincoat is slicked to the clothing beneath, and he reeks of stale tobacco and damp mop asphalt. 

‘You shall weep at the sight of it. Have you walked in the desert at night? You can hear the voices of the dead, if you are silent. The hoofbeats of the buffalo, the cry of the condor. But only when it’s quiet.’ The proselytizer smiles, rolls the cigar between two fat reddened fingers. The skin on his hands is cracked from moisture and age. 
‘Perhap you’ll even hear your father. You’d like that.’ 
It is a statement, not a question.

The light flickers to green and the man withdraws the offered bill, presses the accelerator, keeps his eyes fixed on the road ahead. Perhaps if he looks back the proselytizer will be following him, or perhaps he must look back - perhaps the proselytizer is a Eurydice and he is an Orpheus, and he must see the proselytizer to send him back to the underworld. He silences the car’s radio.

The man glances quickly in the rearview mirror, half-expecting to see the proselytizer following in a haze of smoke, flying above the road like some great bird. He will see the ancient and wrinkled face, and the bird will flicker away, dragged back to the median besides the rain-soaked cardboard sign. He looks again, and there is nothing there but the distant glow of traffic-lights and the harsh headlights of passing trucks. 
A scrap of paper blows across the road, skittering like an injured dove, caught deer-like in the headlights and rain.

——

He comes home from the funeral to a vase of drooping lilies knocked over on the front porch. There’s a note lying amidst them, ink blurred by the water. Someone yells from the alley; a gunshot rings out. The porch light flickers and dies, and the man opens the door to peeling linoleum and the funerary smell of long-dried flowers. Beneath that is a subtle stink of mildewing paperwork. 

He eats standing over the kitchen sink. The instant ramen tastes like salt and styrofoam and burnt plastic, and rain drums on the thin glass of the kitchen window. From the windowsill, his mother stares at him accusingly through the yellowed plastic of the frame: *Why haven’t you been to see me, have you forgotten me here? Where’s your father, boy?*

There are heaped dishes in the sink and the floor tiles are buckled up beneath the place where he has shoved the table. It’s water damage - some old pipes, or a displaced stream. There are petals from carnations and roses and baby's-breath scattered around the room, dried or rotting, and the water in their abandoned vase reeks of mildew and rot. There are larvae swimming about in it - mosquitos, he expects. 
Funerals and wills and inheritances are endless paperwork, and so reams of it spill out from the counters and surfaces. 

A fly buzzes around his head, unceasing, caught as though on an invisible string. 

He hears over the humming of the fly stiff wings against the glass of the kitchen window, and 
when he turns to look, there is a city-gray pigeon there. It gazes through the window with black eyes, dead and empty like those of a shark, and he swears he hears it hiss through fox’s teeth:  do you see the buffalo? 

He blinks, and the bird is gone from the crumbling concrete sill. Outside, the rain is illuminated by the flickering alley light, raining down in flecks and sparkles to puddle on the uneven concrete. In the rippling oily water is the reflection of distant neon.
The shark-eyed pigeon is gone into the night; remaining is a solitary white dove huddled on the twist of power-lines. The bird outside recalls the glittering dark eye of a wedding dove peering through his fingers before he threw it into the sky and it tumbled away over the low and roaming fields.  


Someone besides him muttering: *Do they remember how to survive out there?*
The clicking of a camera, a struggling dove snared in the barbed-wire claws of a hawk. 

____


There is a meeting today, he thinks as he brews coffee, stepping around the dead and drying flowers. There will be shareholders to assure, handshakes and bottles of wine, the basket of  imported fruit that will have been left on his desk as a condolence. There will be his brother at the meeting, and they will drive together in the Porsche bought with the money from the last development through the endless rows of houses pointing out to a recalcitrant shareholder - see, this is what we can build if you’ll let us, there is no difference between then and now.
The coffee, when it finishes dripping into his chipped company mug, is bitter and dark. 

His suit from the funeral is still wet from the rain that hammered down as he closed the umbrella to duck into his car, and there are no others in his closet.
There is no time for the dry-cleaners, and after the funeral he thinks he’ll see the reflections of buffalo in the glass of their doors, find tufts of soft brown fur clinging to crisply folded suits, so he thinks that he will sit out in the sun before the meeting, allow the polyester to dry in the crisp heat of fall. 

When he opens the apartment door onto the stoop, stepping around the toppled vase and strewn flowers, the sun has burnt through much of the past day’s clouds. Puffs of cloud skitter across the sky like beaten dogs in the headstrong northern wind. There is a buffalo cow standing beside his car, and in the sky the geese pause in their migration to circle over her, tip their wings in respect or astonishment. 

She does not stir when he goes to open the door of his car; his arm passes through the place where tangled brown fur and hot skin should have been. In the far distance there is a great black bird drawing vast circles across the washed-out blue of the sky, and he knows that it is no simple vulture. 
It flaps arthritically, shifting vast dark wings so it sweeps ever closer to the man, high in the morning sky. 
He pauses for a moment, hand on the burning metal of the car, and watches the bird - the condor - cut a path through the clouds. Even from this distance, he thinks he can hear it clattering its bill as though in an eerie imitation of raucous, mocking laughter, can almost see it watching him with keen and empty eyes, hissing through a cracked beak:

*One day I’ll come to consume you and your fellows and once again my dark wings will shadow the gorges and cliffsides.*

As he ducks into the car, he thinks to the condor: Not yet. 

When he backs out of the parking space, the buffalo slowly rises to her feet, stands with her head low watching as he pulls out of the parking lot into the heat-blurred morning. 

There is a buffalo on the median besides the proselytizer today, pawing at the concrete in search of long-dead grasses, and again - as though through some enchantment - the light flickers to red just as the man reaches it. 
It, he thinks, must be the same animal that lay behind the crypt: one horn is broken, and there are blackflies gathered about the beast’s wet brown eyes. 
The proselytizer raps on the glass of the window, saying by way of greeting or request for money or warning of the end-times:
“You’ve been seeing the buffalo. Can you hear them yet? Feel their fur and the warmth of their breath? Do the birds pause in the sky and stare at them, as though they too remember?”

The man cracks the window of the car, presses the ten-dollar bill through the gap once more.
“There’s one besides you, Eurydice.”

“So there is. She watches you, and you watch her, and somewhere lost in the endless pale desert is her calf.”


__

He pulled the car into a spot beneath a drought-crippled oak sapling, shifted it into park, leaned forwards against the cold steering wheel and rubbed at his forehead. He sat there for a moment, recalling the lemon-cleaner smell of the home in which his mother was living out her last years, picturing himself ranting about buffalo and condors in a flower-patterned recliner beneath flickering lights, behind reinforced windows. The stink of lemony cleaner and antiseptic, the picture from the windowsill at last smiling: *you have no come home, come to visit me, come to stay. My little boy.*

This isn’t a rant. It’s not a personal story. It’s something I’ve been working on for a while—a breakdown of how law school scripts the job process, what “fit” actually means, and why so many of us still end up blaming ourselves even when we did everything right.

It’s for the ones who:

* Watched a classmate land five callbacks with less hustle and worse grades
* Spent weeks polishing their story and got silence
* Followed every step, played it safe, and still got passed over

I’m sharing the first three chapters here. More if people are interested.

# Foreword: What You Felt Was Real

This isn’t a manifesto. It’s a dissection.

You already know something’s off.  
You’ve seen the memes. You’ve read the threads.  
But the emotional whiplash still doesn’t make sense.

How you were told you were “in the running”… then heard nothing.  
How a classmate with worse grades but better frat-guy energy got multiple callbacks.  
How you reshaped your personality into the OCI-friendly version—and still got ghosted.

This book isn’t about whining. It’s about clarity.  
Because once you see how the machine actually works, you can finally stop blaming yourself—and start building something smarter, cleaner, and real.

# Chapter 1: The Prestige Sorting Hat

Here’s how the myth goes:

If you’re at a T3 regional, your dream is just to claw into doc review hell with a $60K salary.  
If you’re T100, you aim for government, or maybe insurance defense if you’re lucky.  
T50? Big Law is possible, but only if you’re top 10% with a federal clerkship and a JD-MBA.  
T30? Now you’ve got a “shot”—if you network, polish, and smile enough.  
T14? You’re golden. OCI will carry you into six-figure glory.  
HYS? Don’t worry. You were already hired. You just didn’t know it yet.

Reddit calls this the hierarchy.  
Students call it prestige theater.  
Everyone plays their role.

And they think, just because they’ve named the system, that they’ve escaped it.

But here’s the real truth:  
Even the most jaded law student hasn’t realized just how scripted this whole thing is.

Because behind the memes, the GPA cutoffs, and the Big Law vs. bust dichotomy, lies the deeper architecture—the one no school dares speak out loud.

**What They Told You**

Whether you were at a T14, a T60, or somewhere in between, you were told some version of the same thing:

“OCI is competitive but fair.”  
“It’s about fit, not just grades.”  
“You never know who’s looking for someone just like you.”

They talked about holistic review.  
They said firms care about your “story.”  
They said to polish your resume and be your best self.

And maybe they even mentioned precruiting.  
But only in passing, like it was a bonus round—not the main event.

**What They Didn’t Tell You**

They didn’t tell you that the entire hiring cycle was front-loaded.

They didn’t say that by the time OCI “opened,” the real recruiting had already ended—behind closed doors, at private dinners, through 1L fellowship pipelines, and backchannel emails between partners and professors.

They didn’t say that OCI was largely for show.  
A way to give everyone the illusion they had a chance—so they wouldn’t riot.

And they definitely didn’t say that your GPA, resume, and polish weren’t being reviewed in a vacuum. They were being read against a backdrop of what you looked like, how “normal” you seemed, how easy it would be to slot you into a firm's culture without friction.

The truth is brutal:

If you’re a slightly-off-template JD—too old, too blunt, too tattooed, too regionally schooled, too visibly smart in the wrong way—you get quietly screened out.  
Not because you’re unqualified.  
Because you’re unpredictable.

Firms don’t hire for genius.  
They hire for risk minimization.

And OCI is how they do it—under the banner of fairness.

**The Moment It Hits**

You thought you understood the game.  
You thought knowing it was broken would protect you.

But nothing prepares you for the moment it hits.

When the classmate with worse grades, less hustle, and no real interest in the work  
gets callbacks from five firms.

And you’re still refreshing Symplicity.  
Still waiting for your “story” to matter.  
Still hoping someone will notice your polish, your clarity, your actual skill.

That’s when the real clarity sets in.

OCI isn’t a process.  
It’s a sorting hat for prestige theater—and you were never cast in the lead role.

Let’s move on.  
Because there’s no salvation here.  
Only a script you finally get to burn.

# Chapter 2: The Year OCI Died

You didn’t just lose a job.  
You lost a bet.  
A bet you didn’t even know you were making.

Because while they technically told you the game had changed,  
no one told you just how deep it went.

Career Services mentioned precruiting.  
Professors hinted at timing shifts.  
There were panels, emails, even a few half-warnings.

But the framing was soft.  
Precruiting was just “one pathway,” not the pathway.  
OCI still got packaged as the main event—or at least, a viable second chance.

You weren’t lied to.  
You were buffered.  
Handled gently.  
Told just enough truth to keep you from panicking.

**The Myth of the Process**

They’ll tell you it’s about polish. Fit. Your “story.”  
But you watched a classmate fumble through interviews and still land callbacks.

You crafted your narrative. Tightened your resume. Practiced your pitch until it bled self-awareness and likability.  
And still—nothing.

Because the game wasn’t designed to reward effort.  
It was designed to reward timing.  
And access.  
And vibes.

You think you’re failing the process.  
But the process failed you long before it even began.

**Precruiting: The Silent Killer**

Some students were already in.  
Diversity fellows. JD-MBAs.  
1Ls who interned at firms through backchannel referrals.  
The ones with older siblings in Big Law.  
The ones who “just knew” the timeline.

Precruiting isn’t an optional strategy.  
It’s the hiring cycle.

By the time OCI opens:

* Screeners are often formalities
* Callbacks are already half-decided
* Offers are just waiting for confirmation

The name of the game is pipeline—and you weren’t in it.  
Because you were busy preparing for the process they told you was still ahead.  
Not the one that already ended.

**The Emotional Fallout**

This isn’t just about employment.  
It’s about shame.

You feel like you did something wrong.  
Like you weren’t impressive enough.  
Smart enough.  
Normal enough.

You thought you were smart for knowing OCI was flawed.  
But knowing doesn’t prepare you for watching it happen in real time.

You thought insight would insulate you.  
But insight doesn’t save you when you’re still waiting for someone to “see your potential.”

Because OCI isn’t a merit-based selection.  
It’s a ritual of power calibration.

It tells you who already had a foot in the door.  
Who was branded early.  
Who fits the mold without having to contort.

**The New Reality**

Here’s what no one tells you:  
Even if you crush OCI, you’re not beating the system.  
You’re just one of the lucky ones the system forgot to chew up this time.

If you strike out, it’s not a sign you’re weak.  
It’s a sign you were playing with old rules.  
Trying to solve a broken machine with good intentions.

So no—you didn’t fail OCI.  
OCI failed you.

**Let’s Get Clear**

From here on out, we don’t play pretend.  
No more platitudes.  
No more waiting to be picked.

This is for the ones who see the disconnect—and refuse to keep smiling through it.

# Chapter 3: The Archetypes That Win the Game

They’re not better than you. Just better cast.

You already know meritocracy is fake.  
But that doesn’t mean the system is random.  
It runs on typecasting.

OCI—and Big Law in general—doesn’t pick “the best.”  
It picks characters. Roles.  
People who signal familiarity, not originality.

Once you see the archetypes, you can’t unsee them.

**1. The Frat Whisperer™**  
*Middle of the curve. Peak of the vibe.*

He’s not particularly sharp. But he’s confident, smooth, and knows exactly how to make a partner laugh.  
He grew up around this. Summered at his dad’s firm. Played club lacrosse.

OCI is a breeze.  
He has no existential angst about his “story” because he never needed one.  
He just walks in, smiles, and vibes.

His callback?

>“Dude, I just told them I love working with people and solving problems.”

And they loved it.

**2. The JD-MBA Dual Threat**  
*Speaks fluent McKinsey. Optimized since birth.*

She’s polished, poised, and will casually mention her “startup” during small talk.  
Everything she says sounds like a LinkedIn post.  
She knows the partner’s alma mater, hobbies, and Q4 earnings.

OCI loves her because she signals client-ready.  
Her resume reads like an IPO pitch deck.

Does she love the law?  
Who cares.  
She looks like she could run the firm in ten years.  
And that’s enough.

**3. The Career Services Darling**  
*The one who did everything “right.”*

Top 30%.  
Resume perfectly formatted.  
Cover letter reviewed five times over.

She books mock interviews in March.  
Sends handwritten thank-you notes.  
Never misses a deadline.

She is, in every sense, coachable.  
And Big Law loves that.  
She’ll show up, bill 2,200 hours, and never question a thing.

You respect her grind.  
But you also know she’s playing a different game—one that rewards quiet compliance over sharp insight.

**4. The Legacy Hire in Disguise**

>*“Oh I didn’t even think I’d get it!”*  
(…His uncle is a named partner.)

You thought OCI was a level playing field.  
Until this guy—who didn’t even bid on half his firms—shows up with three offers.

He’s the kind of student who never opens the portal.  
Still gets the job.  
Says things like “Oh, I just figured I’d give it a try.”

His references were phone calls.  
His interviews? Informal coffee chats.  
The firm was always the plan—and now it’s official.

**5. The Wildcard Pick**  
*The “interesting” one firms keep around to feel edgy.*

Maybe they were a musician. Or a teacher. Or built an app once.  
They stand out just enough to feel like a “diversity of experience” win.

They usually only get one offer.  
But they get it because they strike the right balance:

* Quirky but not disruptive
* Smart but not threatening
* Different—but not in a way that questions the system

They’ll get hyped in the office newsletter.  
Then quietly molded into whatever the firm needs.

**Where Were You?**

Maybe you were sharper than all of them.  
More thoughtful. More self-aware.  
But you didn’t fit a slot.  
You didn’t look like a “safe bet.”

You were waiting to be seen for your clarity, your hunger, your edge.  
But OCI wasn’t built to notice that.  
It wasn’t built to notice you.

**Let’s Be Real**

None of these archetypes are “wrong.”  
They just fit the stage.

The Big Law stage is a brand, not a meritocracy.  
It hires for likeness, not uniqueness.  
And OCI is its casting call.

You weren’t rejected for being bad.  
You were rejected for being unplaceable.

So let’s stop blaming ourselves for missing a role we were never meant to play.

The good news?  
You’re not here to act.

I’m 20, based in London, currently running an agency doing around £20k/month, but I’m looking to pivot into something bigger, longer term, and more scalable.

I’m an avid listener of the My First Million podcast and the idea of building something that’s not just profitable, but actually sellable with real exit potential is honestly the dream for me.

The main thing I’m struggling with right now is finding other people around my age with the same kind of drive and ambition to build something that actually matters, whether that’s startups, digital businesses, brick and mortar, whatever. I’m open minded.

I’m looking to meet anyone who’s:
	•	Building something interesting
	•	Thinking big
	•	Has an entrepreneurial mindset (even if you haven’t launched yet)

I’m down to grab coffee, go for a walk, or just chat mainly just want to get around like minded people who are pushing for more.

If that sounds like you, drop me a message. Would love to connect.",2,1752024156.0,myfirstmillion,0,1.0,False
1lv6362,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingcritiques/comments/1lv6362/500_word_flash_fiction_any_criticism_welcome/,500 Word Flash Fiction: Any Criticism Welcome!,"My story is down below, please critique it if you can! Here’s the prompt if you would like to challenge yourself as well, (I would be happy to read and critique your interpretation)

Scenario:
The character receives a mysterious letter in the mail. It has only a sentence on it—but it changes everything.

Constraints:
Max of 500 words.
Use first-person POV.
Tackle themes of memory and regret.
Create a twist where the reader realizes by the end that the narrator isn’t who or what they originally thought.

The Last Word (my writing based on the prompt):

The letter slid beneath my wooden door. It had a yellowish tint infused in the dusty paper. My hand went for the cool metal doorknob, stepping into the hall of my apartment. There was no one in sight; not even the sound of creaking floorboards, or the slam of a door. Returning inside, I picked the envelope up, setting it on my big wooden desk, next to my stack of books. I flipped it over. 
“Emmett,” my name written across the back in an ancient tongue. I couldn’t understand it, but it was like it whispered to me. There was no stamp, no seal–nothing. I peeled back the corners of the envelope, revealing a folded piece of coffee stained-paper. The paper was stiff as I unraveled it. Only a few words were in the center of the page. 
“You took it all.” I mouthed the words again. The image of my son came to mind. He was a kind-hearted boy, with his curly brown hair and baby blue eyes resembling his mothers. It was easy to reminisce about when he would jump into my arms as a kid when I came home from work. I got everything I wanted: a beautiful, caring wife, a jolly kid and a thriving job. From desperation to the life I dreamed of–it was truly a miracle. But I wanted nothing to ruin my life. A life that I’ve had for over twenty-five years. And now, after all that time, a letter sparked something hidden from my past. 
I rushed across my apartment, across the decorated carpet, to my bookshelves. I shuffled through them, tossing each book onto the floor, hoping one of them held the answer. The end of the bookshelf neared as my fingers stopped at the touch of a book's cover. This was the book. Something inside me wanted to put it back, but I resisted. I put the book up to my face, revealing the ancient text that whispered to me. 
“Shift reality,” it echoed. I flipped to the first page as the whispers continued. 
“Grant yourself the life you want–the life you deserve.” My head pounded. I remember. Regret poured over me. I couldn't believe I had forgotten–my life was a lie. I shut the book and let it slip from my hands. My knees fell to the ground as my hands shook and lips quivered. After all these years, I’ve finally faced my consequences. I was tricked, thinking I was a lucky dad and husband, when in reality, I was a monster who cursed himself and his friend. 
The window slid open behind me, but I didn’t need to look. I knew who it was. The floor creaked as he crept up behind me. I closed my eyes, taking a deep, shaky breath. 
“I will reclaim the life you stole from me,” he said with his shattered voice. Tears swelled up in my eyes as I muttered my last words with my trembling voice.
“I’m sorry.”

Keppra has been really horrible for me. It has severely worsened my depression and causes me to experience suicidal thoughts frequently. It has given me terrible insomnia and I literally lie in bed for hours trying to sleep but instead feeling like I have just drunk a pot of coffee (which I don’t drink at all since my first seizure). I’m tired all day long and feel so unmotivated and low. I have intense headaches that last all day and keep me in constant pain. I cannot wait to get off it! 

I believe my neuro is going to transition me off Keppra and instead put me on Vimpat. I am hopeful that it will stop the seizures without such awful side effects. Wish me luck!
