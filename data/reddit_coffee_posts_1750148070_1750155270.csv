I’ve been wondering — are there any *active*, casual social groups for suburbs where folks meet offline for things like: 

* ☕ Coffee hangouts
* ⚽ Sports or casual games
* 🎬 Movie nights
* 🍻 Pub evenings

Not dating, not super formal networking — just a bunch of people getting together to hang out, relax, and meet new faces.

If there's already a group/subreddit/Telegram/Discord doing this, please point me in the right direction 🙏

But if not... would anyone be interested in starting something like this? I’d be happy to take initiative, maybe set up a space (like a subreddit or group chat) and maybe coffee next weekend?

1ldjcd9,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1ldjcd9/the_divorce_prescription_novel_celine_tate_found/,"The Divorce Prescription novel Celine Tate found out her husband, Adam Alvarez, was cheating on her.","Chapter 1

Celine Tate found out her husband, Adam Alvarez, was cheating on her.

The other woman was a college student.

Today was Adam's birthday. Celine had spent the whole day preparing a special dinner for him. Just then, his forgotten phone buzzed with a text.

She picked it up and saw a message from the college student. ""I fell while grabbing the cake. It hurts so much… Sobs…""

Attached was a photo—no face, just legs.

The woman wore pulled-up white socks with black round-toed shoes. She pulled up her blue-and-white skirt just enough to reveal her long, flawless legs.

Her fair knees were visibly reddened from the fall. The youthful vibrancy of her figure, paired with her coy words, carried an air of forbidden allure.

Rumor had it that wealthy businessmen tend to favor this type when choosing a lover.

Celine's grip on the phone tightened until her knuckles turned white.

Soon, another message came. ""Mr. Alvarez, meet me at Elysian Hotel tonight. I want to celebrate your birthday.""

It was Adam's birthday, and his mistress had planned a celebration for him.

Grabbing her handbag, Celine headed straight for Elysian Hotel. She had to see this woman with her own eyes.

…

When Celine arrived at the hotel, she was ready to storm in.

But before she could, she spotted her parents, Hayden Tate and Lucy Garcia. Shocked, she approached them. ""Dad, Mom, what are you doing here?""

The two froze for a moment before exchanging glances. Their eyes flickered as they said, ""Oh, Celine, your sister's back from abroad. We came here to drop her off.""

Carly Tate?

Through the gleaming floor-to-ceiling window, Celine spotted Carly inside. She froze instantly.

Inside, Carly was wearing the same blue-and-white skirt from the photo. So, the college girl was her sister.

Carly had always been a stunner, hailed as Mercity's ""Scarlet Rose"". Her legs, in particular, were the stuff of legends. They were the most beautiful in all of Mercity. Men practically worshiped her.

Now, those famous legs had ensnared Adam.

Celine almost laughed at the absurdity of it. She turned to her parents. ""So I'm the last to find out.""

Hayden's face twisted awkwardly. ""Celine, Mr. Alvarez never liked you.""

Lucy chimed in, ""Exactly. Do you know how many women in Mercity would kill to be with him? Better your sister than some stranger.""

Upon hearing that, Celine clenched her fists. ""I'm your daughter too!""

With that, she spun on her heels to leave.

Just then, Lucy's voice rang out behind her. ""Celine, tell me something. Has Mr. Alvarez ever touched you?""

Celine froze mid-step.

Hayden said sharply, ""Don't act like we owe you anything. Back then, Mr. Alvarez and Carly were the It couple in everyone's eyes. We only asked you to marry him on Carly's behalf after he fell into a coma from the car accident.""

Lucy gave Celine a disdainful once-over. ""Look at yourself, Celine. Three years as a housewife, running around after your husband. Meanwhile, Carly's a lead ballerina now—a true swan. You? You're just a frumpy little duckling. Be reasonable and give Mr. Alvarez back to Carly.""

Those words felt like a knife to Celine's heart. She blinked back her tears and turned to walk away.

…

By the time Celine returned to the villa, it was already dark. She had given the housekeeper, Sofia Dotson, the day off. The house was empty, with no lights on, leaving it cold and desolate.

Celine sat alone at the dining table in the darkness.

The table was set with a feast, but the food had long gone cold. Her homemade cake sat untouched, with the words ""Happy Birthday, honey"" scrawled across it.

Celine stared at it, her eyes stinging. It all felt like a cruel joke, just like her life.

Adam and Carly had always been the It couple in their circle. Everyone knew that Carly, the Scarlet Rose, was Adam's heart and soul. But three years ago, a sudden car accident left Adam in a coma, and Carly vanished without a trace.

The Tate family had brought Celine from the countryside and forced her to marry the comatose Adam.

When she found out that the man lying in that hospital bed was Adam—the man she had always loved—she didn't hesitate. She married him without a second thought.

After the wedding, Adam remained in a coma for three years. During that time, Celine took care of him tirelessly, never leaving his side. She gave up going out and socializing. Her sole focus was on his recovery.

She became a housewife dedicated to nothing but him. In the end, her devotion brought him back to life.

Celine lit the candles on the cake with a flick of the lighter.

The dim glow flickered, casting her reflection in the mirror in front of her. She looked at herself—the housewife in her dull black-and-white dress. She was lifeless, boring, and unremarkable.

Meanwhile, Carly had flourished into a lead ballerina. She was young, vibrant, and beautiful.

Celine was the ugly duckling, while Carly was the swan.

After waking, Adam had abandoned the ugly duckling and returned to the swan.

So, her sacrifice for the last three years had been for nothing.

Adam didn't love her, but she loved him with all her heart.

It was said that the one who fell in love first was always the loser in the relationship. And today, Adam had made her lose everything.

Her eyes filled with tears, and she blew out the candles. The house plunged back into darkness.

Just then, headlights pierced the night as Adam's Rolls-Royce Phantom sped up the driveway and parked on the driveway.

Celine's heart skipped a beat. He was back. She had thought he wouldn't return home tonight.

Soon, the villa's front door swung open. A tall, handsome figure stepped into view, bringing with him the chill of the night air. Adam was home.

The Alvarez family had long been royalty in Mercity. Adam, the heir to the Alvarez family, had been a business prodigy since childhood.

By 16, he had earned dual master's degrees from the prestigious Haffard University. By the time he reached adulthood, his first company had made waves on Finance Street. Now, he sat at the helm of Alvarez Group, crowned as Mercity's wealthiest man.

Adam strode in with his long legs. His voice was low and pleasant but distant. ""Why didn't you turn on the lights?""

With a flick of his hand, he turned on the wall light.

The harsh light made Celine squint. When she opened her eyes again, she looked at Adam.

He was wearing a hand-tailored black suit, every inch the picture of perfection. His perfect proportions and regal air made him the object of desire for many women.

Celine glanced at him. ""It's your birthday.""

Adam's face was a mask of indifference. His eyes lazily swept over the table. ""Don't waste your time. I don't celebrate birthdays.""

Celine sneered and asked, ""You don't celebrate birthdays, or you just don't want to celebrate it with me?""

Adam barely spared her a glance, as if he didn't want to waste time on her. ""Think whatever you want.""

Without another word, he turned and started toward the stairs.

This had always been their dynamic. No matter how hard she tried, she couldn't get close to him.

Celine stood up and. Looking at his indifferent back, she said, ""Today is your birthday. I'd like to give you a birthday gift.""

Adam didn't stop or turn to look at her. ""I don't need it.""

Celine smiled again. ""Let's get a divorce, Adam.""

Adam had already placed one foot on the stairs when he suddenly paused. He spun on his heel, his deep eyes locking onto her.

Chapter 2

Celine looked at Adam. Her voice was soft but unwavering as she repeated, ""Let's get a divorce, Adam. Do you like this birthday gift?""

Adam's expression remained indifferent. ""Are you suddenly asking for a divorce because I didn't spend my birthday with you?""

""Carly's back, isn't she?"" Celine asked.

At the mention of Carly, Adam's lips curled into a sneer. He stepped toward Celine with long strides. ""Are you bothered by her?""

As the youngest business mogul in Mercity, Adam exuded a powerful presence built from his wealth, status, and influence. As he advanced toward her, Celine instinctively took a step back. Her delicate back hit the wall.

At that moment, the world around her seemed to darken. Adam had already closed the distance, placing one hand against the wall beside her, trapping her between his solid chest and the wall.

He looked down at her with a mocking smile. ""Everyone in Mercity knows that Carly is the one I'm going to marry. Didn't you know that when you schemed to become my wife? You didn't mind back then, so why are you bothered now?""

Celine's face turned pale.

Yes, Adam was supposed to marry Carly. If it weren't for the accident, she would never have had the chance to marry him.

She would never forget the day he woke up. When he saw it was Celine beside him, the disappointment and coldness in his eyes were unmistakable.

Since then, they had slept in separate rooms, and he had never touched her.

He loved Carly.

Celine had always known that, but…

She looked deeply at Adam's face. Slowly, it began to merge with the image of the youthful boy he had once been.

""Adam, do you really not remember me?"" Celine thought.

It seemed that only she had stayed in the past.

Never mind. She would take these three years as her fulfilling her misguided love.

Celine pushed down the bitterness and pain in her heart. ""Adam, let's end this platonic marriage.""

Adam suddenly raised an eyebrow. ""Platonic?"" His deep voice was full of mockery.

He reached out and cupped her chin. His thumb brushed over her soft lips, pressing against them in an almost teasing motion. ""So that's why you want a divorce? You want to have sex?""

Celine's face flushed bright red, like a tomato.

That wasn't what she meant.

Now, his thumb was pressed on her crimson lips, rubbing with a malicious yet seductive force. Celine hadn't expected such a flirtatious side from a man so hot and refined.

He was actually playing with her lips with his finger.

Adam had never been this close to Celine before. She always hid behind those oversized black-framed glasses, wearing plain clothes, making herself look like an older woman.

But up close, Adam noticed how small her face was. Beneath those glasses, her features were delicate and striking, and those eyes were mesmerizing.

Her lips were soft, too.

Where his finger pressed, the red faded for a moment, then returned with a slight bounce. Her lips were not just soft but tender as well. It was an enticing sight that made him want to kiss her.

Adam's eyes darkened. ""I didn't expect you to have such strong desires. Do you long for a man in you?""

Suddenly, a loud slap echoed in the villa. Celine had slapped him hard across the face.

Adam's head jerked to the side.

Celine's fingers trembled with anger. She had been too humble in her love, allowing her heart to be trampled. How dare he humiliate her like this?

Furious, she said, ""I know you've never let go of Carly. Now I'll make it easier for you. I'll return the position as Mrs. Alvarez to her!""

Adam's expression instantly turned icy, like a sheet of frost had fallen over his handsome face. He had never been slapped before—not by anyone.

He stared at her coldly. ""Celine, you thought you could just marry me when you wanted and divorce me when you felt like it? What do you take me for?""

Celine sneered. ""A plaything, of course.""

Adam couldn't believe what he heard.

Celine fought back the pain in her heart and lied, ""You're just a plaything I took from Carly. Now I'm tired of playing with you. I want to throw you away.""

Adam's expression grew darker. ""Fine, Celine. You want a divorce? Alright. But don't come crawling back to me, begging to get back together!""

With that, he stormed upstairs and slammed the door to his study.

Celine seemed to lose all her strength. Her delicate body slowly slid down the wall. She crouched on the carpet, wrapping her arms around herself.

""I won't love you anymore, Adam,"" she swore in her mind.

…

The next morning, Sofia entered Adam's study.

Adam sat at his desk, reviewing documents. He was well-known for being a workaholic.

""Mr. Alvarez,"" Sofia called out.

Adam didn't look up. Sofia could tell that he was in a bad mood. The air around him seemed to freeze.

She carefully placed a cup of coffee on the table. ""Mr. Alvarez, Mrs. Alvarez made this cup of coffee for you.""

Adam's hand holding the pen faltered. The cold expression on his face softened slightly.

Was Celine trying to make peace?

To be fair, she was a good wife. She cooked according to his preferences, hand-washed his clothes, and took care of every detail of his daily life.

Adam picked up the cup of coffee and took a sip.

Celine definitely made this. It was exactly how he liked it.

Still, he was angry. She had slapped him last night, and that anger would not be easily soothed. A cup of coffee wasn't going to fix this.

Adam asked, ""Did Celine realize her mistake?""

Sofia looked at him with a strange look. ""…Mrs. Alvarez has left.""

Adam froze, his eyes snapping up to meet Sofia's.

Just then, she took something out. ""She left with her suitcase, Mr. Alvarez. She asked me to give this to you before she left.""

As Adam took the paper and opened it, the words ""Divorce Agreement"" jumped out at him.

Adam was left speechless. He had thought she was trying to make peace.

Sofia hesitated. ""Mrs. Alvarez said you should finish the coffee and sign the papers as soon as possible.""

Adam glared at the cup of coffee. ""Throw it out! All of it!""

Sofia thought he was enjoying the coffee earlier. Why didn't he like it anymore?

However, she didn't dare voice her thoughts. She quickly grabbed the coffee and left the room.

Adam's face darkened. He scanned the divorce agreement and realized Celine agreed to leave with nothing—no alimony, no property.

He sneered bitterly. She certainly had some nerve. She didn't want a single dime from him. What could a country girl like her possibly expect to live on without money?

He remembered how, three years ago, she had done everything she could to become his wife. Wasn't it all about the money?

Then his gaze fell on the reason for the divorce written by Celine in neat handwriting. ""The husband's health does not allow him to fulfill his marital duties.""

Adam was rendered speechless. His face flushed with rage.

This damned woman!

He grabbed his phone and immediately dialed Celine's number.

The phone rang a few times before her clear, calm voice came through. ""Hello?""

Chapter 3

Adam pressed his thin lips into a hard line. ""Celine Tate, get back here now!""

Celine chuckled. ""You want me to come back just because you say so? We're divorced, Adam. I'm not going to put up with you anymore.""

Adam gritted his teeth. ""I'm giving you one more chance to rewrite the reason for the divorce.""

Celine's smile widened. ""Is there something wrong with what I wrote? You've been awake for half a year now, but in all this time, you haven't even held my hand.

""You were in a coma for three years. Although your health seems fine now, I seriously doubt your manhood is working. You should see a doctor. I sincerely hope you can regain your masculinity soon!""

Adam was speechless. The veins on his forehead were visibly pulsing.

This woman had really lost it!

""I'll show you how capable I am in bed one day, Celine Tate!"" he gritted out.

""Sorry, you don't have that chance anymore.""

""Celine!""

A couple of beeps sounded, and the call was abruptly disconnected.

Adam seethed in rage. But before he could vent, all he heard was the busy tone.

Celine Tate!

…

Celine had already arrived at her best friend, Robin Smith's apartment.

When she hung up, Robin burst into laughter and gave her a thumbs-up. ""That was perfect, Celine! He's probably so mad right now he might burst a vein.""

Celine felt that it was because she had been too humble in the past that he had come to see himself as so superior.

People should love themselves before loving others. It was crucial to prioritize one's happiness.

Robin added, ""When Carly found out Mr. Alvarez was in a coma three years ago, she left him right away. But now that he's awake, he's going after her again. Honestly, it's better to be rid of a man like him.""

Celine unwrapped a piece of candy and popped it into her mouth. The sweet taste seemed to mask the bitterness in her heart. ""Robin, that's the difference between being loved and unloved.""

The one who was loved could act without fear, while the one who was unloved always remained cautious and insecure.

Robin glanced at Celine, who had already eaten a whole bunch of candies. She pulled Celine to her feet. ""Cheer up, Celine! When you let go of one tree, you'll realize you've gained a whole forest. I'll hire eight escorts and throw you a singles' party tonight!""

Celine laughed, pressing her forehead.

At that moment, Robin reached up and took off Celine's black-framed glasses. She tossed them straight into the trash.

""My glasses!"" Celine went to retrieve them.

Robin stopped her. ""Celine, you're too used to wearing those glasses from all your academic work. You should learn from Carly and dress yourself up beautifully.""

Celine remembered how her parents called her an ugly duckling while Carly was the swan.

It seemed that it wasn't just her parents who thought so. Adam probably saw her as an ugly duckling too.

Robin pulled Celine out the door. ""Come on. I'm taking you out for a full makeover—hair, nails, outfit, everything. I want Adam and the others to open their eyes and see just how beautiful you are!""

As they were leaving, Robin suddenly remembered something. ""By the way, Celine, you really don't want any of Mr. Alvarez's money?""

""I have my own money,"" Celine replied.

""Well, then you're leaving that money to Carly. She'll probably thank you.""

Celine was rendered speechless.

""Where's the card Mr. Alvarez gave you?""

Adam had always been generous and had given Celine a gold-plated black card, but she'd never used it.

Celine pulled the card out of her purse and said with a wink, ""Mr. Alvarez can foot the bill for our shopping today.""

…

Club 1996 had long been the playground for the wealthy elite of Mercity, where the rich heirs and socialites spent their money without a second thought.

That night, the DJ kept the music going, and the crowd danced wildly.

In one of the luxurious booths, Adam sat in the center, wearing a black shirt and black pants. His sleeves were rolled up to reveal his muscular forearms and a watch worth millions. He looked every bit the hot, aristocratic figure that had women in the club constantly looking his way.

Sitting beside him was his good friend, Benjamin Goodwin—the heir to the Goodwin family—along with a few other trust fund babies.

Benjamin laughed loudly. ""What's this I hear, Adam? Celine wants a divorce?""

The others joined in the laughter.

""Who doesn't know how much Celine is in love with you, Mr. Alvarez? She even wanted to marry you when you were in a coma,"" one of them said. ""There's no way she'd leave you now!""

""We should make a bet to see how many days Celine can resist before reaching out to Mr. Alvarez,"" another chimed in.

Benjamin said, ""I bet she won't even last a day. She'll probably send Adam a message any minute now. Haha!""

Adam's face, however, was shadowed and stern, showing clear signs of anger. He pulled out his phone and opened his chat with Celine.

The last message was from the night before. Celine had sent him a picture of a bowl of chicken bone broth with the message, ""Honey, even though your bone density is fine now, you still need to drink more chicken bone broth. Remember to come home early.""

As he scrolled up, there were daily messages from Celine. He had never replied. Not once.

But tonight, there was nothing from her, and Adam felt a surge of frustration in his chest.

Just then, a notification pinged, signaling the arrival of a new message.

Benjamin immediately chimed in, ""I knew it! Celine's messaging Adam right now!""

The notification pinged repeatedly as several messages came through in quick succession.

Everyone burst out laughing. ""I knew Celine couldn't hold back, but I didn't expect her to be so eager.""

Benjamin urged, ""Adam, quick, check what she's saying. She must be crying and begging you to get back together with her.""

Adam's eyes twitched. She had messaged him?

If she wanted to make peace, why all that hostility earlier? Wasn't she the one acting tough this morning?

The moment Adam opened the message, he froze.

Benjamin read it aloud. ""Dear VVIP, your card ending in 0975 has been charged 800 dollars at Dazzling Nails.""

Everyone went silent, staring in confusion.

Adam scrolled up and saw a series of transaction messages.

Celine had spent two thousand dollars at Urban Glow Salon, 86 thousand dollars at Chanel, and 24 thousand dollars at Louis Vuitton.

There were no messages asking for reconciliation, just notifications of her spending.

The group was dumbfounded. It felt like Celine had slapped them all across the face.

Adam's face darkened as he slammed his phone onto the table. It wasn't the money that bothered him. It was that she had gone straight to spend his money after their divorce.

The woman who had been so obedient and dependent on him for the past three years suddenly seemed to have shown her true colors.

Benjamin muttered, ""What's she playing at, Adam? She's getting her nails and hair done and went shopping for clothes. Is she trying to dress up like Carly?""

""Carly's the Scarlet Rose of Mercity, while Celine is just some country bumpkin. No matter how hard she tries, she'll never match up to her.""

""A swan is a swan, and an ugly duckling will forever be an ugly duckling. It will never turn into a swan.""

The group continued laughing at Celine.

At that moment, a commotion broke out in the club. Everyone's attention was focused on one place.

Someone gasped, ""You guys, look! An angel!""

Chapter 4

Celine had arrived.

After a full day of splurging at the mall, Robin whisked her off to Club 1996 for the ultimate single-woman celebration.

What Celine didn't expect was to run into Adam and his group. Naturally, she also heard their mocking remarks about her.

She recognized the people in the luxurious booth. They were part of Adam's social circle. Benjamin, in particular, was one of Adam's closest friends.

Back when Adam and Carly had their high-profile romance, everyone in the group adored Carly. Benjamin even treated her like Adam's wife.

In the past three years, Celine had never been able to integrate into their group. They made no effort to hide their disdain for her.

They'd slapped labels on her like ""desperate replacement bride"", ""ugly duckling"", and ""country bumpkin"".

When a man didn't love her partner, his friends wouldn't respect her either.

Robin's temper flared immediately. ""I'm going to tear their smug faces off!"" She started rolling up her sleeves.

Celine grabbed her arm firmly. ""Let it go, Robin. I'm divorced now. They're not worth the energy.""

Noticing Celine's calm and indifferent demeanor, Robin managed to rein in her frustration. As more and more eyes turned to Celine, calling her an angel, Robin's mood brightened. ""Let's go. Time for a singles party!""

Robin marched them to a luxury booth on the other side of the club. She waved her hand dramatically. ""Bring me all your male escorts!""

Back at Adam's booth, Benjamin and the other scions were still mocking Celine when they suddenly felt a sharp, icy gaze land on them.

They looked up to see Adam at the head of the booth, lazily lifting his sharp eyes to glance at them. His gaze was cold, displeased, and full of warning.

At once, the laughter froze on their faces. None of them dared to say another word about Celine.

Benjamin glanced at Adam. Even though Adam had never spared Celine a second look, she had tirelessly taken care of him for three years. Clearly, Adam still had some shred of sentiment left for her.

Just then, a wave of excitement rippled through the crowd. ""Such a beautiful angel!""

Angel? Where?

Benjamin followed everyone's gaze and immediately widened his eyes in surprise. ""Holy crap! That really is an angel!""

The others around him were equally mesmerized. ""When did an angel arrive in Mercity? And how come we've never seen her before?""

Benjamin tugged at Adam's sleeve. ""Adam, look at that angel!""

Adam was no stranger to women. He'd seen all types, from slender to curvy, so he wasn't interested in that ""angel"".

However, Celine's booth was directly across from his. The moment he looked up, his eyes landed on her.

Celine had ditched her thick-rimmed glasses, shedding her usual dullness and rigidity. Her tiny face was as fair as snow. Her naturally striking features exuded a fresh, otherworldly elegance. With her silky hair cascading over her shoulders, she looked like a living, breathing angel.

Adam's gaze lingered for two full seconds.

Benjamin was clearly thrilled. ""What do you think of that angel, Adam?""

One of the scions remarked, ""Mr. Alvarez won't be impressed. His type is more of a sweet beauty like Carly, not this cool, angelic vibe.""

""Yeah, but check out her legs! Those could definitely compete with Carly's,"" another added.

Celine, in a rare departure from her usual conservative style, was wearing a chic, short tweed dress that showed off her legs for the first time.

Her legs were perfectly toned, proportionate, and tantalizing. These were the kind of legs that made men's imaginations run wild. They were just as captivating as Carly's.

Adam glanced at the ""angel"" for two seconds and couldn't shake the feeling that this woman looked strangely familiar. He felt like he had seen her somewhere before.

Just then, a group of male escorts filed into the room, each one tall and hot. They lined up right in front of Celine.

Robin grinned. ""Celine, pick eight.""

Since Celine was celebrating her newfound freedom from a disastrous marriage, she decided to go all out. ""You, you, you… Stay.""

Benjamin was counting under his breath. ""One, two, three… eight. Did she just pick eight escorts at once?""

One of the scions chimed in, ""Why spend the money? All she has to do is ask, and we'd happily volunteer for free.""

Laughter erupted around the booth.

At this moment, Adam's phone buzzed again. It was a new transaction message. He picked it up to see what Celine paid for this time.

But this time…

""Dear VVIP, your card ending in 0975 has been charged 500,000 dollars at Club 1996 for eight escorts.""

Adam frowned at once. He reread the words ""eight escorts"" twice before snapping his gaze back toward the angel across the room.

The angel who had just splurged on eight escorts was actually Celine!

Adam was rendered speechless.

Eight escorts surrounded Celine and started pouring drinks for her one after another. ""Ladies, let's play a drinking game.""

Robin happily replied, ""Hell yeah! Let's do it!""

Celine lost the first round. An escort leaned in and held a glass to her lips. ""Here, let me help you drink.""

She took the drink, but the other escorts weren't having it. ""Why him? You drank his drink but not ours? Let us feed you too!""

Celine was feeling a little overwhelmed by the eager attention.

Across the room, Adam's sharp eyes narrowed dangerously. His chiseled jaw tightened as he stood and headed straight for Celine's booth.

Benjamin was taken aback. ""Adam! Where are you going?""

Celine was sipping her drink when a strong, defined hand reached over and grabbed her delicate wrist. He lifted her off the couch as easily as if she were a child.

Shocked, she looked up and was met with Adam's handsome face.

Celine froze for a moment, then quickly struggled to pull her wrist free from his grip. ""Let go of me, Adam!""

Adam's face was cold as he forcefully dragged her away.

Robin jumped to her feet. ""Hey! Adam! What are you doing? Let go of Celine!""

Benjamin and the scions who followed Adam were stunned, their faces filled with disbelief. They all wondered if they were hearing things.

""Celine? The angel is… Celine?""

""Is this the same Celine we've always known? The ugly duckling? She's actually gorgeous?""

Benjamin froze in place as he watched Adam drag the stunning figure away. ""Damn… Celine turned into a freaking angel the moment she ditched Adam.""

…

Adam's grip on Celine's wrist was unyielding. His strong hand was like an iron shackle. No matter how hard she fought, she couldn't break free. His long strides forced her to stumble along behind him.

""Let go of me, Adam!"" she shouted.

Just then, Adam swung his hand, and Celine's delicate back slammed into the cold wall. Her vision went dark as his tall, imposing figure pressed in, trapping her against the wall.

Danger flared in his eyes as he growled, ""Do you think I'm dead, Celine Tate? You're actually out here flirting with other men?""

Chapter 5

Celine frowned. ""What do you mean by flirting?""

Adam gritted his teeth. ""You're dressing like a slut!""

What? A slut?

""You better explain, Adam Alvarez!"" Celine snapped.

Adam lowered his gaze, eyeing her short dress. ""Your thighs are practically hanging out. Is that how desperate you are for people to look at your legs?""

Sure, her dress was a little on the shorter side, but Robin had chosen the dress for her.

She had said, ""You never show your legs, giving Carly the chance to flaunt hers. Tonight, let's show everyone who really has the best legs in Mercity.""

Celine raised an eyebrow. ""Seems like you were looking at my legs, Mr. Alvarez.""

Adam froze.

Celine leaned back against the wall, her posture lazy yet elegant. She slowly lifted her right leg and brushed her crystal heel against his ankle.

Adam stood there in tailored black slacks that highlighted his long legs, exuding an air of cold elegance and restraint.

From his ankle, Celine slowly trailed upward along his calf in a teasing, deliberate motion. It was both a seduction and a provocation.

Adam gave her a cold look. ""What are you doing?""

Celine smirked. ""Mr. Alvarez, whose legs do you prefer—mine or Carly's?""

Adam's gaze lingered on her, captivated by the delicate features of her face, which radiated an almost ethereal beauty. She looked like an otherworldly angel, yet here she was, boldly tempting him.

He'd noticed her beauty last night, hidden behind those black-framed glasses, but he hadn't expected her to be so striking.

However, there was something familiar about her face.

Celine's bright eyes sparkled with mischief. ""Has Carly ever tried to seduce you with her legs, Mr. Alvarez?""

Adam's breath hitched. He leaned closer to look at her. ""Celine, are you really such a slut? You think about men all day and even hired eight escorts!""

He avoided answering her question about Carly. That was perhaps the most polite way for a man to protect a woman.

His relationship with Carly had been a grand love story from their youthful, carefree days. Carly must have seduced him at some point. That was the only way to explain why she lingered so vividly in his memory.

Carly was truly blessed to have such a cold-hearted man remain devoted to her for so long. Adam must have never used a word like ""slut"" to describe her.

Though Celine was smiling, her eyes remained as cold as ice. ""Yes, Mr. Alvarez. There's an issue with your manhood. Since you can't satisfy me, I have to go find someone healthy. Let's get divorced already. If one man doesn't work, I'll find another who does.""

She said he had issues again! This woman was unbelievable!

Adam gripped her delicate jaw. ""Is this some sort of provocation? Are you so desperate to find out if I have issues?""

What?

Celine froze.

Adam leaned in close, his lips hovering near hers with an almost teasing proximity. Yet his words were icy and detached. ""Don't kid yourself, Celine. I'll never touch you. The one I love is Carly.""

The one he loved was Carly.

He didn't even need to say it. Celine already knew. Still, hearing it stung her heart. It wasn't a sharp pain, but a dull, relentless ache that spread in countless tiny waves.

Just then, a sweet voice rang out. ""Adam.""

Celine looked up only to see Carly standing there.

Carly, the renowned Scarlet Rose of Mercity, was a beauty with ruby lips and pearly teeth. Years of dance training had given her a graceful, supple figure.

Seeing her, Adam instantly released Celine and strode toward Carly. He lowered his gaze to meet hers. His eyes were filled with a warmth Celine had never seen before. ""You're here!""

Carly nodded before glancing at Celine. ""And this is?"" Carly didn't recognize her at all.

But Celine would never forget Carly.

The truth was, Celine and Carly were neither full nor half-sisters. Hayden wasn't Celine's biological father. He was her stepfather.

Once, Celine had a happy family. Her father, Aaron Tate, and her mother, Lucy Garcia, had been devoted to each other.

Aaron loved her dearly. He would lift her high into the air every day. ""My little Celine is going to grow up so happy.""

Then, one day, he was gone. His brother, Hayden, moved in with his daughter, Carly, into Aaron's house, and Lucy became Carly's mother as well.

Lucy remarried Celine's uncle. From then on, her affection was directed solely toward Carly, not Celine.

When Carly scored 99 on an exam and Celine scored 100, Lucy punished her. ""Why can't you let Carly shine? Do you always have to outdo her?""

When Carly fell ill, her hair was shaved off for chemotherapy. She cried that she looked ugly. Lucy immediately shaved Celine's head. ""You need to become ugly with Carly. That way, she'll stop crying.""

Night after night, Lucy, Hayden, and Carly would cuddle together, their laughter spilling out into the hallway. Celine would stand outside, crying while clutching the doll that Aaron had bought her. ""Mommy, I'm scared.""

Eventually, Carly started calling Lucy ""Mommy"". Lucy was thrilled, but Carly said, ""Mommy, you can only have one daughter.""

On a rainy day, Lucy drove Celine to the countryside and left her there.

Little Celine chased the car while sobbing. ""Don't leave me, Mommy! I'll be a good girl. I'll listen to you. I'll let Carly have everything! I want a hug, Mommy! I'm scared!""

Clutching her doll, she fell heavily into the mud. She watched helplessly as Lucy drove away, disappearing from her sight.

Celine would never forget Carly.

At this moment, Benjamin rushed over. ""Carly, she's your sister. She's Celine!""

Carly froze in disbelief. ""You're… Celine?""

Celine knew Carly had always looked down on her.

As children, Carly had bested her at every turn. She had always been outstanding. Later, she even dated Adam, the heir to the Alvarez family.

Raised in a life of luxury and affection, Carly became proud and untouchable.

Benjamin was once again stunned by Celine's exquisite beauty. He murmured, ""I didn't expect Celine to look this stunning.""

Carly's childhood memories of Celine were vague because she had never paid much attention to this unloved sister. But wasn't Celine the ugly duckling from the countryside?

Carly stepped closer. Her gaze swept over Celine with thinly veiled disdain. ""Celine, I didn't expect you to doll yourself up like me.""

Celine was rendered speechless.

Well, Carly could think whatever she wanted as long as she was happy.

Celine straightened her slender back and smiled without saying a word. The corridor lights cast a soft glow on her delicate, ethereal face. She was no longer the same little Celine from before.

Just then, Carly spoke up. ""Celine, I heard you and Adam are divorcing. Can't survive without a man, huh? Resorting to male escorts to fill the void? If I were you, I'd get a job.""

Turning to Adam, she added in a condescending tone, ""Adam, Celine has taken care of you for so long. You should at least help her find work. Maybe as a housekeeper.""

Adam's gaze flickered to Celine.

Benjamin interjected, ""Carly, every job requires qualifications. What's Celine's education level?""

Carly seemed to remember something amusing. She raised her chin with a smile and said, ""She dropped out of school when she was 16.""

1ldjbci,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1ldjbci/the_divorce_prescription_novel_celine_tate_found/,"The Divorce Prescription novel Celine Tate found out her husband, Adam Alvarez, was cheating on her.","Chapter 1

Celine Tate found out her husband, Adam Alvarez, was cheating on her.

The other woman was a college student.

Today was Adam's birthday. Celine had spent the whole day preparing a special dinner for him. Just then, his forgotten phone buzzed with a text.

She picked it up and saw a message from the college student. ""I fell while grabbing the cake. It hurts so much… Sobs…""

Attached was a photo—no face, just legs.

The woman wore pulled-up white socks with black round-toed shoes. She pulled up her blue-and-white skirt just enough to reveal her long, flawless legs.

Her fair knees were visibly reddened from the fall. The youthful vibrancy of her figure, paired with her coy words, carried an air of forbidden allure.

Rumor had it that wealthy businessmen tend to favor this type when choosing a lover.

Celine's grip on the phone tightened until her knuckles turned white.

Soon, another message came. ""Mr. Alvarez, meet me at Elysian Hotel tonight. I want to celebrate your birthday.""

It was Adam's birthday, and his mistress had planned a celebration for him.

Grabbing her handbag, Celine headed straight for Elysian Hotel. She had to see this woman with her own eyes.

…

When Celine arrived at the hotel, she was ready to storm in.

But before she could, she spotted her parents, Hayden Tate and Lucy Garcia. Shocked, she approached them. ""Dad, Mom, what are you doing here?""

The two froze for a moment before exchanging glances. Their eyes flickered as they said, ""Oh, Celine, your sister's back from abroad. We came here to drop her off.""

Carly Tate?

Through the gleaming floor-to-ceiling window, Celine spotted Carly inside. She froze instantly.

Inside, Carly was wearing the same blue-and-white skirt from the photo. So, the college girl was her sister.

Carly had always been a stunner, hailed as Mercity's ""Scarlet Rose"". Her legs, in particular, were the stuff of legends. They were the most beautiful in all of Mercity. Men practically worshiped her.

Now, those famous legs had ensnared Adam.

Celine almost laughed at the absurdity of it. She turned to her parents. ""So I'm the last to find out.""

Hayden's face twisted awkwardly. ""Celine, Mr. Alvarez never liked you.""

Lucy chimed in, ""Exactly. Do you know how many women in Mercity would kill to be with him? Better your sister than some stranger.""

Upon hearing that, Celine clenched her fists. ""I'm your daughter too!""

With that, she spun on her heels to leave.

Just then, Lucy's voice rang out behind her. ""Celine, tell me something. Has Mr. Alvarez ever touched you?""

Celine froze mid-step.

Hayden said sharply, ""Don't act like we owe you anything. Back then, Mr. Alvarez and Carly were the It couple in everyone's eyes. We only asked you to marry him on Carly's behalf after he fell into a coma from the car accident.""

Lucy gave Celine a disdainful once-over. ""Look at yourself, Celine. Three years as a housewife, running around after your husband. Meanwhile, Carly's a lead ballerina now—a true swan. You? You're just a frumpy little duckling. Be reasonable and give Mr. Alvarez back to Carly.""

Those words felt like a knife to Celine's heart. She blinked back her tears and turned to walk away.

…

By the time Celine returned to the villa, it was already dark. She had given the housekeeper, Sofia Dotson, the day off. The house was empty, with no lights on, leaving it cold and desolate.

Celine sat alone at the dining table in the darkness.

The table was set with a feast, but the food had long gone cold. Her homemade cake sat untouched, with the words ""Happy Birthday, honey"" scrawled across it.

Celine stared at it, her eyes stinging. It all felt like a cruel joke, just like her life.

Adam and Carly had always been the It couple in their circle. Everyone knew that Carly, the Scarlet Rose, was Adam's heart and soul. But three years ago, a sudden car accident left Adam in a coma, and Carly vanished without a trace.

The Tate family had brought Celine from the countryside and forced her to marry the comatose Adam.

When she found out that the man lying in that hospital bed was Adam—the man she had always loved—she didn't hesitate. She married him without a second thought.

After the wedding, Adam remained in a coma for three years. During that time, Celine took care of him tirelessly, never leaving his side. She gave up going out and socializing. Her sole focus was on his recovery.

She became a housewife dedicated to nothing but him. In the end, her devotion brought him back to life.

Celine lit the candles on the cake with a flick of the lighter.

The dim glow flickered, casting her reflection in the mirror in front of her. She looked at herself—the housewife in her dull black-and-white dress. She was lifeless, boring, and unremarkable.

Meanwhile, Carly had flourished into a lead ballerina. She was young, vibrant, and beautiful.

Celine was the ugly duckling, while Carly was the swan.

After waking, Adam had abandoned the ugly duckling and returned to the swan.

So, her sacrifice for the last three years had been for nothing.

Adam didn't love her, but she loved him with all her heart.

It was said that the one who fell in love first was always the loser in the relationship. And today, Adam had made her lose everything.

Her eyes filled with tears, and she blew out the candles. The house plunged back into darkness.

Just then, headlights pierced the night as Adam's Rolls-Royce Phantom sped up the driveway and parked on the driveway.

Celine's heart skipped a beat. He was back. She had thought he wouldn't return home tonight.

Soon, the villa's front door swung open. A tall, handsome figure stepped into view, bringing with him the chill of the night air. Adam was home.

The Alvarez family had long been royalty in Mercity. Adam, the heir to the Alvarez family, had been a business prodigy since childhood.

By 16, he had earned dual master's degrees from the prestigious Haffard University. By the time he reached adulthood, his first company had made waves on Finance Street. Now, he sat at the helm of Alvarez Group, crowned as Mercity's wealthiest man.

Adam strode in with his long legs. His voice was low and pleasant but distant. ""Why didn't you turn on the lights?""

With a flick of his hand, he turned on the wall light.

The harsh light made Celine squint. When she opened her eyes again, she looked at Adam.

He was wearing a hand-tailored black suit, every inch the picture of perfection. His perfect proportions and regal air made him the object of desire for many women.

Celine glanced at him. ""It's your birthday.""

Adam's face was a mask of indifference. His eyes lazily swept over the table. ""Don't waste your time. I don't celebrate birthdays.""

Celine sneered and asked, ""You don't celebrate birthdays, or you just don't want to celebrate it with me?""

Adam barely spared her a glance, as if he didn't want to waste time on her. ""Think whatever you want.""

Without another word, he turned and started toward the stairs.

This had always been their dynamic. No matter how hard she tried, she couldn't get close to him.

Celine stood up and. Looking at his indifferent back, she said, ""Today is your birthday. I'd like to give you a birthday gift.""

Adam didn't stop or turn to look at her. ""I don't need it.""

Celine smiled again. ""Let's get a divorce, Adam.""

Adam had already placed one foot on the stairs when he suddenly paused. He spun on his heel, his deep eyes locking onto her.

Chapter 2

Celine looked at Adam. Her voice was soft but unwavering as she repeated, ""Let's get a divorce, Adam. Do you like this birthday gift?""

Adam's expression remained indifferent. ""Are you suddenly asking for a divorce because I didn't spend my birthday with you?""

""Carly's back, isn't she?"" Celine asked.

At the mention of Carly, Adam's lips curled into a sneer. He stepped toward Celine with long strides. ""Are you bothered by her?""

As the youngest business mogul in Mercity, Adam exuded a powerful presence built from his wealth, status, and influence. As he advanced toward her, Celine instinctively took a step back. Her delicate back hit the wall.

At that moment, the world around her seemed to darken. Adam had already closed the distance, placing one hand against the wall beside her, trapping her between his solid chest and the wall.

He looked down at her with a mocking smile. ""Everyone in Mercity knows that Carly is the one I'm going to marry. Didn't you know that when you schemed to become my wife? You didn't mind back then, so why are you bothered now?""

Celine's face turned pale.

Yes, Adam was supposed to marry Carly. If it weren't for the accident, she would never have had the chance to marry him.

She would never forget the day he woke up. When he saw it was Celine beside him, the disappointment and coldness in his eyes were unmistakable.

Since then, they had slept in separate rooms, and he had never touched her.

He loved Carly.

Celine had always known that, but…

She looked deeply at Adam's face. Slowly, it began to merge with the image of the youthful boy he had once been.

""Adam, do you really not remember me?"" Celine thought.

It seemed that only she had stayed in the past.

Never mind. She would take these three years as her fulfilling her misguided love.

Celine pushed down the bitterness and pain in her heart. ""Adam, let's end this platonic marriage.""

Adam suddenly raised an eyebrow. ""Platonic?"" His deep voice was full of mockery.

He reached out and cupped her chin. His thumb brushed over her soft lips, pressing against them in an almost teasing motion. ""So that's why you want a divorce? You want to have sex?""

Celine's face flushed bright red, like a tomato.

That wasn't what she meant.

Now, his thumb was pressed on her crimson lips, rubbing with a malicious yet seductive force. Celine hadn't expected such a flirtatious side from a man so hot and refined.

He was actually playing with her lips with his finger.

Adam had never been this close to Celine before. She always hid behind those oversized black-framed glasses, wearing plain clothes, making herself look like an older woman.

But up close, Adam noticed how small her face was. Beneath those glasses, her features were delicate and striking, and those eyes were mesmerizing.

Her lips were soft, too.

Where his finger pressed, the red faded for a moment, then returned with a slight bounce. Her lips were not just soft but tender as well. It was an enticing sight that made him want to kiss her.

Adam's eyes darkened. ""I didn't expect you to have such strong desires. Do you long for a man in you?""

Suddenly, a loud slap echoed in the villa. Celine had slapped him hard across the face.

Adam's head jerked to the side.

Celine's fingers trembled with anger. She had been too humble in her love, allowing her heart to be trampled. How dare he humiliate her like this?

Furious, she said, ""I know you've never let go of Carly. Now I'll make it easier for you. I'll return the position as Mrs. Alvarez to her!""

Adam's expression instantly turned icy, like a sheet of frost had fallen over his handsome face. He had never been slapped before—not by anyone.

He stared at her coldly. ""Celine, you thought you could just marry me when you wanted and divorce me when you felt like it? What do you take me for?""

Celine sneered. ""A plaything, of course.""

Adam couldn't believe what he heard.

Celine fought back the pain in her heart and lied, ""You're just a plaything I took from Carly. Now I'm tired of playing with you. I want to throw you away.""

Adam's expression grew darker. ""Fine, Celine. You want a divorce? Alright. But don't come crawling back to me, begging to get back together!""

With that, he stormed upstairs and slammed the door to his study.

Celine seemed to lose all her strength. Her delicate body slowly slid down the wall. She crouched on the carpet, wrapping her arms around herself.

""I won't love you anymore, Adam,"" she swore in her mind.

…

The next morning, Sofia entered Adam's study.

Adam sat at his desk, reviewing documents. He was well-known for being a workaholic.

""Mr. Alvarez,"" Sofia called out.

Adam didn't look up. Sofia could tell that he was in a bad mood. The air around him seemed to freeze.

She carefully placed a cup of coffee on the table. ""Mr. Alvarez, Mrs. Alvarez made this cup of coffee for you.""

Adam's hand holding the pen faltered. The cold expression on his face softened slightly.

Was Celine trying to make peace?

To be fair, she was a good wife. She cooked according to his preferences, hand-washed his clothes, and took care of every detail of his daily life.

Adam picked up the cup of coffee and took a sip.

Celine definitely made this. It was exactly how he liked it.

Still, he was angry. She had slapped him last night, and that anger would not be easily soothed. A cup of coffee wasn't going to fix this.

Adam asked, ""Did Celine realize her mistake?""

Sofia looked at him with a strange look. ""…Mrs. Alvarez has left.""

Adam froze, his eyes snapping up to meet Sofia's.

Just then, she took something out. ""She left with her suitcase, Mr. Alvarez. She asked me to give this to you before she left.""

As Adam took the paper and opened it, the words ""Divorce Agreement"" jumped out at him.

Adam was left speechless. He had thought she was trying to make peace.

Sofia hesitated. ""Mrs. Alvarez said you should finish the coffee and sign the papers as soon as possible.""

Adam glared at the cup of coffee. ""Throw it out! All of it!""

Sofia thought he was enjoying the coffee earlier. Why didn't he like it anymore?

However, she didn't dare voice her thoughts. She quickly grabbed the coffee and left the room.

Adam's face darkened. He scanned the divorce agreement and realized Celine agreed to leave with nothing—no alimony, no property.

He sneered bitterly. She certainly had some nerve. She didn't want a single dime from him. What could a country girl like her possibly expect to live on without money?

He remembered how, three years ago, she had done everything she could to become his wife. Wasn't it all about the money?

Then his gaze fell on the reason for the divorce written by Celine in neat handwriting. ""The husband's health does not allow him to fulfill his marital duties.""

Adam was rendered speechless. His face flushed with rage.

This damned woman!

He grabbed his phone and immediately dialed Celine's number.

The phone rang a few times before her clear, calm voice came through. ""Hello?""

Chapter 3

Adam pressed his thin lips into a hard line. ""Celine Tate, get back here now!""

Celine chuckled. ""You want me to come back just because you say so? We're divorced, Adam. I'm not going to put up with you anymore.""

Adam gritted his teeth. ""I'm giving you one more chance to rewrite the reason for the divorce.""

Celine's smile widened. ""Is there something wrong with what I wrote? You've been awake for half a year now, but in all this time, you haven't even held my hand.

""You were in a coma for three years. Although your health seems fine now, I seriously doubt your manhood is working. You should see a doctor. I sincerely hope you can regain your masculinity soon!""

Adam was speechless. The veins on his forehead were visibly pulsing.

This woman had really lost it!

""I'll show you how capable I am in bed one day, Celine Tate!"" he gritted out.

""Sorry, you don't have that chance anymore.""

""Celine!""

A couple of beeps sounded, and the call was abruptly disconnected.

Adam seethed in rage. But before he could vent, all he heard was the busy tone.

Celine Tate!

…

Celine had already arrived at her best friend, Robin Smith's apartment.

When she hung up, Robin burst into laughter and gave her a thumbs-up. ""That was perfect, Celine! He's probably so mad right now he might burst a vein.""

Celine felt that it was because she had been too humble in the past that he had come to see himself as so superior.

People should love themselves before loving others. It was crucial to prioritize one's happiness.

Robin added, ""When Carly found out Mr. Alvarez was in a coma three years ago, she left him right away. But now that he's awake, he's going after her again. Honestly, it's better to be rid of a man like him.""

Celine unwrapped a piece of candy and popped it into her mouth. The sweet taste seemed to mask the bitterness in her heart. ""Robin, that's the difference between being loved and unloved.""

The one who was loved could act without fear, while the one who was unloved always remained cautious and insecure.

Robin glanced at Celine, who had already eaten a whole bunch of candies. She pulled Celine to her feet. ""Cheer up, Celine! When you let go of one tree, you'll realize you've gained a whole forest. I'll hire eight escorts and throw you a singles' party tonight!""

Celine laughed, pressing her forehead.

At that moment, Robin reached up and took off Celine's black-framed glasses. She tossed them straight into the trash.

""My glasses!"" Celine went to retrieve them.

Robin stopped her. ""Celine, you're too used to wearing those glasses from all your academic work. You should learn from Carly and dress yourself up beautifully.""

Celine remembered how her parents called her an ugly duckling while Carly was the swan.

It seemed that it wasn't just her parents who thought so. Adam probably saw her as an ugly duckling too.

Robin pulled Celine out the door. ""Come on. I'm taking you out for a full makeover—hair, nails, outfit, everything. I want Adam and the others to open their eyes and see just how beautiful you are!""

As they were leaving, Robin suddenly remembered something. ""By the way, Celine, you really don't want any of Mr. Alvarez's money?""

""I have my own money,"" Celine replied.

""Well, then you're leaving that money to Carly. She'll probably thank you.""

Celine was rendered speechless.

""Where's the card Mr. Alvarez gave you?""

Adam had always been generous and had given Celine a gold-plated black card, but she'd never used it.

Celine pulled the card out of her purse and said with a wink, ""Mr. Alvarez can foot the bill for our shopping today.""

…

Club 1996 had long been the playground for the wealthy elite of Mercity, where the rich heirs and socialites spent their money without a second thought.

That night, the DJ kept the music going, and the crowd danced wildly.

In one of the luxurious booths, Adam sat in the center, wearing a black shirt and black pants. His sleeves were rolled up to reveal his muscular forearms and a watch worth millions. He looked every bit the hot, aristocratic figure that had women in the club constantly looking his way.

Sitting beside him was his good friend, Benjamin Goodwin—the heir to the Goodwin family—along with a few other trust fund babies.

Benjamin laughed loudly. ""What's this I hear, Adam? Celine wants a divorce?""

The others joined in the laughter.

""Who doesn't know how much Celine is in love with you, Mr. Alvarez? She even wanted to marry you when you were in a coma,"" one of them said. ""There's no way she'd leave you now!""

""We should make a bet to see how many days Celine can resist before reaching out to Mr. Alvarez,"" another chimed in.

Benjamin said, ""I bet she won't even last a day. She'll probably send Adam a message any minute now. Haha!""

Adam's face, however, was shadowed and stern, showing clear signs of anger. He pulled out his phone and opened his chat with Celine.

The last message was from the night before. Celine had sent him a picture of a bowl of chicken bone broth with the message, ""Honey, even though your bone density is fine now, you still need to drink more chicken bone broth. Remember to come home early.""

As he scrolled up, there were daily messages from Celine. He had never replied. Not once.

But tonight, there was nothing from her, and Adam felt a surge of frustration in his chest.

Just then, a notification pinged, signaling the arrival of a new message.

Benjamin immediately chimed in, ""I knew it! Celine's messaging Adam right now!""

The notification pinged repeatedly as several messages came through in quick succession.

Everyone burst out laughing. ""I knew Celine couldn't hold back, but I didn't expect her to be so eager.""

Benjamin urged, ""Adam, quick, check what she's saying. She must be crying and begging you to get back together with her.""

Adam's eyes twitched. She had messaged him?

If she wanted to make peace, why all that hostility earlier? Wasn't she the one acting tough this morning?

The moment Adam opened the message, he froze.

Benjamin read it aloud. ""Dear VVIP, your card ending in 0975 has been charged 800 dollars at Dazzling Nails.""

Everyone went silent, staring in confusion.

Adam scrolled up and saw a series of transaction messages.

Celine had spent two thousand dollars at Urban Glow Salon, 86 thousand dollars at Chanel, and 24 thousand dollars at Louis Vuitton.

There were no messages asking for reconciliation, just notifications of her spending.

The group was dumbfounded. It felt like Celine had slapped them all across the face.

Adam's face darkened as he slammed his phone onto the table. It wasn't the money that bothered him. It was that she had gone straight to spend his money after their divorce.

The woman who had been so obedient and dependent on him for the past three years suddenly seemed to have shown her true colors.

Benjamin muttered, ""What's she playing at, Adam? She's getting her nails and hair done and went shopping for clothes. Is she trying to dress up like Carly?""

""Carly's the Scarlet Rose of Mercity, while Celine is just some country bumpkin. No matter how hard she tries, she'll never match up to her.""

""A swan is a swan, and an ugly duckling will forever be an ugly duckling. It will never turn into a swan.""

The group continued laughing at Celine.

At that moment, a commotion broke out in the club. Everyone's attention was focused on one place.

Someone gasped, ""You guys, look! An angel!""

Chapter 4

Celine had arrived.

After a full day of splurging at the mall, Robin whisked her off to Club 1996 for the ultimate single-woman celebration.

What Celine didn't expect was to run into Adam and his group. Naturally, she also heard their mocking remarks about her.

She recognized the people in the luxurious booth. They were part of Adam's social circle. Benjamin, in particular, was one of Adam's closest friends.

Back when Adam and Carly had their high-profile romance, everyone in the group adored Carly. Benjamin even treated her like Adam's wife.

In the past three years, Celine had never been able to integrate into their group. They made no effort to hide their disdain for her.

They'd slapped labels on her like ""desperate replacement bride"", ""ugly duckling"", and ""country bumpkin"".

When a man didn't love her partner, his friends wouldn't respect her either.

Robin's temper flared immediately. ""I'm going to tear their smug faces off!"" She started rolling up her sleeves.

Celine grabbed her arm firmly. ""Let it go, Robin. I'm divorced now. They're not worth the energy.""

Noticing Celine's calm and indifferent demeanor, Robin managed to rein in her frustration. As more and more eyes turned to Celine, calling her an angel, Robin's mood brightened. ""Let's go. Time for a singles party!""

Robin marched them to a luxury booth on the other side of the club. She waved her hand dramatically. ""Bring me all your male escorts!""

Back at Adam's booth, Benjamin and the other scions were still mocking Celine when they suddenly felt a sharp, icy gaze land on them.

They looked up to see Adam at the head of the booth, lazily lifting his sharp eyes to glance at them. His gaze was cold, displeased, and full of warning.

At once, the laughter froze on their faces. None of them dared to say another word about Celine.

Benjamin glanced at Adam. Even though Adam had never spared Celine a second look, she had tirelessly taken care of him for three years. Clearly, Adam still had some shred of sentiment left for her.

Just then, a wave of excitement rippled through the crowd. ""Such a beautiful angel!""

Angel? Where?

Benjamin followed everyone's gaze and immediately widened his eyes in surprise. ""Holy crap! That really is an angel!""

The others around him were equally mesmerized. ""When did an angel arrive in Mercity? And how come we've never seen her before?""

Benjamin tugged at Adam's sleeve. ""Adam, look at that angel!""

Adam was no stranger to women. He'd seen all types, from slender to curvy, so he wasn't interested in that ""angel"".

However, Celine's booth was directly across from his. The moment he looked up, his eyes landed on her.

Celine had ditched her thick-rimmed glasses, shedding her usual dullness and rigidity. Her tiny face was as fair as snow. Her naturally striking features exuded a fresh, otherworldly elegance. With her silky hair cascading over her shoulders, she looked like a living, breathing angel.

Adam's gaze lingered for two full seconds.

Benjamin was clearly thrilled. ""What do you think of that angel, Adam?""

One of the scions remarked, ""Mr. Alvarez won't be impressed. His type is more of a sweet beauty like Carly, not this cool, angelic vibe.""

""Yeah, but check out her legs! Those could definitely compete with Carly's,"" another added.

Celine, in a rare departure from her usual conservative style, was wearing a chic, short tweed dress that showed off her legs for the first time.

Her legs were perfectly toned, proportionate, and tantalizing. These were the kind of legs that made men's imaginations run wild. They were just as captivating as Carly's.

Adam glanced at the ""angel"" for two seconds and couldn't shake the feeling that this woman looked strangely familiar. He felt like he had seen her somewhere before.

Just then, a group of male escorts filed into the room, each one tall and hot. They lined up right in front of Celine.

Robin grinned. ""Celine, pick eight.""

Since Celine was celebrating her newfound freedom from a disastrous marriage, she decided to go all out. ""You, you, you… Stay.""

Benjamin was counting under his breath. ""One, two, three… eight. Did she just pick eight escorts at once?""

One of the scions chimed in, ""Why spend the money? All she has to do is ask, and we'd happily volunteer for free.""

Laughter erupted around the booth.

At this moment, Adam's phone buzzed again. It was a new transaction message. He picked it up to see what Celine paid for this time.

But this time…

""Dear VVIP, your card ending in 0975 has been charged 500,000 dollars at Club 1996 for eight escorts.""

Adam frowned at once. He reread the words ""eight escorts"" twice before snapping his gaze back toward the angel across the room.

The angel who had just splurged on eight escorts was actually Celine!

Adam was rendered speechless.

Eight escorts surrounded Celine and started pouring drinks for her one after another. ""Ladies, let's play a drinking game.""

Robin happily replied, ""Hell yeah! Let's do it!""

Celine lost the first round. An escort leaned in and held a glass to her lips. ""Here, let me help you drink.""

She took the drink, but the other escorts weren't having it. ""Why him? You drank his drink but not ours? Let us feed you too!""

Celine was feeling a little overwhelmed by the eager attention.

Across the room, Adam's sharp eyes narrowed dangerously. His chiseled jaw tightened as he stood and headed straight for Celine's booth.

Benjamin was taken aback. ""Adam! Where are you going?""

Celine was sipping her drink when a strong, defined hand reached over and grabbed her delicate wrist. He lifted her off the couch as easily as if she were a child.

Shocked, she looked up and was met with Adam's handsome face.

Celine froze for a moment, then quickly struggled to pull her wrist free from his grip. ""Let go of me, Adam!""

Adam's face was cold as he forcefully dragged her away.

Robin jumped to her feet. ""Hey! Adam! What are you doing? Let go of Celine!""

Benjamin and the scions who followed Adam were stunned, their faces filled with disbelief. They all wondered if they were hearing things.

""Celine? The angel is… Celine?""

""Is this the same Celine we've always known? The ugly duckling? She's actually gorgeous?""

Benjamin froze in place as he watched Adam drag the stunning figure away. ""Damn… Celine turned into a freaking angel the moment she ditched Adam.""

…

Adam's grip on Celine's wrist was unyielding. His strong hand was like an iron shackle. No matter how hard she fought, she couldn't break free. His long strides forced her to stumble along behind him.

""Let go of me, Adam!"" she shouted.

Just then, Adam swung his hand, and Celine's delicate back slammed into the cold wall. Her vision went dark as his tall, imposing figure pressed in, trapping her against the wall.

Danger flared in his eyes as he growled, ""Do you think I'm dead, Celine Tate? You're actually out here flirting with other men?""

Chapter 5

Celine frowned. ""What do you mean by flirting?""

Adam gritted his teeth. ""You're dressing like a slut!""

What? A slut?

""You better explain, Adam Alvarez!"" Celine snapped.

Adam lowered his gaze, eyeing her short dress. ""Your thighs are practically hanging out. Is that how desperate you are for people to look at your legs?""

Sure, her dress was a little on the shorter side, but Robin had chosen the dress for her.

She had said, ""You never show your legs, giving Carly the chance to flaunt hers. Tonight, let's show everyone who really has the best legs in Mercity.""

Celine raised an eyebrow. ""Seems like you were looking at my legs, Mr. Alvarez.""

Adam froze.

Celine leaned back against the wall, her posture lazy yet elegant. She slowly lifted her right leg and brushed her crystal heel against his ankle.

Adam stood there in tailored black slacks that highlighted his long legs, exuding an air of cold elegance and restraint.

From his ankle, Celine slowly trailed upward along his calf in a teasing, deliberate motion. It was both a seduction and a provocation.

Adam gave her a cold look. ""What are you doing?""

Celine smirked. ""Mr. Alvarez, whose legs do you prefer—mine or Carly's?""

Adam's gaze lingered on her, captivated by the delicate features of her face, which radiated an almost ethereal beauty. She looked like an otherworldly angel, yet here she was, boldly tempting him.

He'd noticed her beauty last night, hidden behind those black-framed glasses, but he hadn't expected her to be so striking.

However, there was something familiar about her face.

Celine's bright eyes sparkled with mischief. ""Has Carly ever tried to seduce you with her legs, Mr. Alvarez?""

Adam's breath hitched. He leaned closer to look at her. ""Celine, are you really such a slut? You think about men all day and even hired eight escorts!""

He avoided answering her question about Carly. That was perhaps the most polite way for a man to protect a woman.

His relationship with Carly had been a grand love story from their youthful, carefree days. Carly must have seduced him at some point. That was the only way to explain why she lingered so vividly in his memory.

Carly was truly blessed to have such a cold-hearted man remain devoted to her for so long. Adam must have never used a word like ""slut"" to describe her.

Though Celine was smiling, her eyes remained as cold as ice. ""Yes, Mr. Alvarez. There's an issue with your manhood. Since you can't satisfy me, I have to go find someone healthy. Let's get divorced already. If one man doesn't work, I'll find another who does.""

She said he had issues again! This woman was unbelievable!

Adam gripped her delicate jaw. ""Is this some sort of provocation? Are you so desperate to find out if I have issues?""

What?

Celine froze.

Adam leaned in close, his lips hovering near hers with an almost teasing proximity. Yet his words were icy and detached. ""Don't kid yourself, Celine. I'll never touch you. The one I love is Carly.""

The one he loved was Carly.

He didn't even need to say it. Celine already knew. Still, hearing it stung her heart. It wasn't a sharp pain, but a dull, relentless ache that spread in countless tiny waves.

Just then, a sweet voice rang out. ""Adam.""

Celine looked up only to see Carly standing there.

Carly, the renowned Scarlet Rose of Mercity, was a beauty with ruby lips and pearly teeth. Years of dance training had given her a graceful, supple figure.

Seeing her, Adam instantly released Celine and strode toward Carly. He lowered his gaze to meet hers. His eyes were filled with a warmth Celine had never seen before. ""You're here!""

Carly nodded before glancing at Celine. ""And this is?"" Carly didn't recognize her at all.

But Celine would never forget Carly.

The truth was, Celine and Carly were neither full nor half-sisters. Hayden wasn't Celine's biological father. He was her stepfather.

Once, Celine had a happy family. Her father, Aaron Tate, and her mother, Lucy Garcia, had been devoted to each other.

Aaron loved her dearly. He would lift her high into the air every day. ""My little Celine is going to grow up so happy.""

Then, one day, he was gone. His brother, Hayden, moved in with his daughter, Carly, into Aaron's house, and Lucy became Carly's mother as well.

Lucy remarried Celine's uncle. From then on, her affection was directed solely toward Carly, not Celine.

When Carly scored 99 on an exam and Celine scored 100, Lucy punished her. ""Why can't you let Carly shine? Do you always have to outdo her?""

When Carly fell ill, her hair was shaved off for chemotherapy. She cried that she looked ugly. Lucy immediately shaved Celine's head. ""You need to become ugly with Carly. That way, she'll stop crying.""

Night after night, Lucy, Hayden, and Carly would cuddle together, their laughter spilling out into the hallway. Celine would stand outside, crying while clutching the doll that Aaron had bought her. ""Mommy, I'm scared.""

Eventually, Carly started calling Lucy ""Mommy"". Lucy was thrilled, but Carly said, ""Mommy, you can only have one daughter.""

On a rainy day, Lucy drove Celine to the countryside and left her there.

Little Celine chased the car while sobbing. ""Don't leave me, Mommy! I'll be a good girl. I'll listen to you. I'll let Carly have everything! I want a hug, Mommy! I'm scared!""

Clutching her doll, she fell heavily into the mud. She watched helplessly as Lucy drove away, disappearing from her sight.

Celine would never forget Carly.

At this moment, Benjamin rushed over. ""Carly, she's your sister. She's Celine!""

Carly froze in disbelief. ""You're… Celine?""

Celine knew Carly had always looked down on her.

As children, Carly had bested her at every turn. She had always been outstanding. Later, she even dated Adam, the heir to the Alvarez family.

Raised in a life of luxury and affection, Carly became proud and untouchable.

Benjamin was once again stunned by Celine's exquisite beauty. He murmured, ""I didn't expect Celine to look this stunning.""

Carly's childhood memories of Celine were vague because she had never paid much attention to this unloved sister. But wasn't Celine the ugly duckling from the countryside?

Carly stepped closer. Her gaze swept over Celine with thinly veiled disdain. ""Celine, I didn't expect you to doll yourself up like me.""

Celine was rendered speechless.

Well, Carly could think whatever she wanted as long as she was happy.

Celine straightened her slender back and smiled without saying a word. The corridor lights cast a soft glow on her delicate, ethereal face. She was no longer the same little Celine from before.

Just then, Carly spoke up. ""Celine, I heard you and Adam are divorcing. Can't survive without a man, huh? Resorting to male escorts to fill the void? If I were you, I'd get a job.""

Turning to Adam, she added in a condescending tone, ""Adam, Celine has taken care of you for so long. You should at least help her find work. Maybe as a housekeeper.""

Adam's gaze flickered to Celine.

Benjamin interjected, ""Carly, every job requires qualifications. What's Celine's education level?""

Carly seemed to remember something amusing. She raised her chin with a smile and said, ""She dropped out of school when she was 16.""

Celine Tate found out her husband, Adam Alvarez, was cheating on her.

The other woman was a college student.

Today was Adam's birthday. Celine had spent the whole day preparing a special dinner for him. Just then, his forgotten phone buzzed with a text.

She picked it up and saw a message from the college student. ""I fell while grabbing the cake. It hurts so much… Sobs…""

Attached was a photo—no face, just legs.

The woman wore pulled-up white socks with black round-toed shoes. She pulled up her blue-and-white skirt just enough to reveal her long, flawless legs.

Her fair knees were visibly reddened from the fall. The youthful vibrancy of her figure, paired with her coy words, carried an air of forbidden allure.

Rumor had it that wealthy businessmen tend to favor this type when choosing a lover.

Celine's grip on the phone tightened until her knuckles turned white.

Soon, another message came. ""Mr. Alvarez, meet me at Elysian Hotel tonight. I want to celebrate your birthday.""

It was Adam's birthday, and his mistress had planned a celebration for him.

Grabbing her handbag, Celine headed straight for Elysian Hotel. She had to see this woman with her own eyes.

…

When Celine arrived at the hotel, she was ready to storm in.

But before she could, she spotted her parents, Hayden Tate and Lucy Garcia. Shocked, she approached them. ""Dad, Mom, what are you doing here?""

The two froze for a moment before exchanging glances. Their eyes flickered as they said, ""Oh, Celine, your sister's back from abroad. We came here to drop her off.""

Carly Tate?

Through the gleaming floor-to-ceiling window, Celine spotted Carly inside. She froze instantly.

Inside, Carly was wearing the same blue-and-white skirt from the photo. So, the college girl was her sister.

Carly had always been a stunner, hailed as Mercity's ""Scarlet Rose"". Her legs, in particular, were the stuff of legends. They were the most beautiful in all of Mercity. Men practically worshiped her.

Now, those famous legs had ensnared Adam.

Celine almost laughed at the absurdity of it. She turned to her parents. ""So I'm the last to find out.""

Hayden's face twisted awkwardly. ""Celine, Mr. Alvarez never liked you.""

Lucy chimed in, ""Exactly. Do you know how many women in Mercity would kill to be with him? Better your sister than some stranger.""

Upon hearing that, Celine clenched her fists. ""I'm your daughter too!""

With that, she spun on her heels to leave.

Just then, Lucy's voice rang out behind her. ""Celine, tell me something. Has Mr. Alvarez ever touched you?""

Celine froze mid-step.

Hayden said sharply, ""Don't act like we owe you anything. Back then, Mr. Alvarez and Carly were the It couple in everyone's eyes. We only asked you to marry him on Carly's behalf after he fell into a coma from the car accident.""

Lucy gave Celine a disdainful once-over. ""Look at yourself, Celine. Three years as a housewife, running around after your husband. Meanwhile, Carly's a lead ballerina now—a true swan. You? You're just a frumpy little duckling. Be reasonable and give Mr. Alvarez back to Carly.""

Those words felt like a knife to Celine's heart. She blinked back her tears and turned to walk away.

…

By the time Celine returned to the villa, it was already dark. She had given the housekeeper, Sofia Dotson, the day off. The house was empty, with no lights on, leaving it cold and desolate.

Celine sat alone at the dining table in the darkness.

The table was set with a feast, but the food had long gone cold. Her homemade cake sat untouched, with the words ""Happy Birthday, honey"" scrawled across it.

Celine stared at it, her eyes stinging. It all felt like a cruel joke, just like her life.

Adam and Carly had always been the It couple in their circle. Everyone knew that Carly, the Scarlet Rose, was Adam's heart and soul. But three years ago, a sudden car accident left Adam in a coma, and Carly vanished without a trace.

The Tate family had brought Celine from the countryside and forced her to marry the comatose Adam.

When she found out that the man lying in that hospital bed was Adam—the man she had always loved—she didn't hesitate. She married him without a second thought.

After the wedding, Adam remained in a coma for three years. During that time, Celine took care of him tirelessly, never leaving his side. She gave up going out and socializing. Her sole focus was on his recovery.

She became a housewife dedicated to nothing but him. In the end, her devotion brought him back to life.

Celine lit the candles on the cake with a flick of the lighter.

The dim glow flickered, casting her reflection in the mirror in front of her. She looked at herself—the housewife in her dull black-and-white dress. She was lifeless, boring, and unremarkable.

Meanwhile, Carly had flourished into a lead ballerina. She was young, vibrant, and beautiful.

Celine was the ugly duckling, while Carly was the swan.

After waking, Adam had abandoned the ugly duckling and returned to the swan.

So, her sacrifice for the last three years had been for nothing.

Adam didn't love her, but she loved him with all her heart.

It was said that the one who fell in love first was always the loser in the relationship. And today, Adam had made her lose everything.

Her eyes filled with tears, and she blew out the candles. The house plunged back into darkness.

Just then, headlights pierced the night as Adam's Rolls-Royce Phantom sped up the driveway and parked on the driveway.

Celine's heart skipped a beat. He was back. She had thought he wouldn't return home tonight.

Soon, the villa's front door swung open. A tall, handsome figure stepped into view, bringing with him the chill of the night air. Adam was home.

The Alvarez family had long been royalty in Mercity. Adam, the heir to the Alvarez family, had been a business prodigy since childhood.

By 16, he had earned dual master's degrees from the prestigious Haffard University. By the time he reached adulthood, his first company had made waves on Finance Street. Now, he sat at the helm of Alvarez Group, crowned as Mercity's wealthiest man.

Adam strode in with his long legs. His voice was low and pleasant but distant. ""Why didn't you turn on the lights?""

With a flick of his hand, he turned on the wall light.

The harsh light made Celine squint. When she opened her eyes again, she looked at Adam.

He was wearing a hand-tailored black suit, every inch the picture of perfection. His perfect proportions and regal air made him the object of desire for many women.

Celine glanced at him. ""It's your birthday.""

Adam's face was a mask of indifference. His eyes lazily swept over the table. ""Don't waste your time. I don't celebrate birthdays.""

Celine sneered and asked, ""You don't celebrate birthdays, or you just don't want to celebrate it with me?""

Adam barely spared her a glance, as if he didn't want to waste time on her. ""Think whatever you want.""

Without another word, he turned and started toward the stairs.

This had always been their dynamic. No matter how hard she tried, she couldn't get close to him.

Celine stood up and. Looking at his indifferent back, she said, ""Today is your birthday. I'd like to give you a birthday gift.""

Adam didn't stop or turn to look at her. ""I don't need it.""

Celine smiled again. ""Let's get a divorce, Adam.""

Adam had already placed one foot on the stairs when he suddenly paused. He spun on his heel, his deep eyes locking onto her.

Chapter 2

Celine looked at Adam. Her voice was soft but unwavering as she repeated, ""Let's get a divorce, Adam. Do you like this birthday gift?""

Adam's expression remained indifferent. ""Are you suddenly asking for a divorce because I didn't spend my birthday with you?""

""Carly's back, isn't she?"" Celine asked.

At the mention of Carly, Adam's lips curled into a sneer. He stepped toward Celine with long strides. ""Are you bothered by her?""

As the youngest business mogul in Mercity, Adam exuded a powerful presence built from his wealth, status, and influence. As he advanced toward her, Celine instinctively took a step back. Her delicate back hit the wall.

At that moment, the world around her seemed to darken. Adam had already closed the distance, placing one hand against the wall beside her, trapping her between his solid chest and the wall.

He looked down at her with a mocking smile. ""Everyone in Mercity knows that Carly is the one I'm going to marry. Didn't you know that when you schemed to become my wife? You didn't mind back then, so why are you bothered now?""

Celine's face turned pale.

Yes, Adam was supposed to marry Carly. If it weren't for the accident, she would never have had the chance to marry him.

She would never forget the day he woke up. When he saw it was Celine beside him, the disappointment and coldness in his eyes were unmistakable.

Since then, they had slept in separate rooms, and he had never touched her.

He loved Carly.

Celine had always known that, but…

She looked deeply at Adam's face. Slowly, it began to merge with the image of the youthful boy he had once been.

""Adam, do you really not remember me?"" Celine thought.

It seemed that only she had stayed in the past.

Never mind. She would take these three years as her fulfilling her misguided love.

Celine pushed down the bitterness and pain in her heart. ""Adam, let's end this platonic marriage.""

Adam suddenly raised an eyebrow. ""Platonic?"" His deep voice was full of mockery.

He reached out and cupped her chin. His thumb brushed over her soft lips, pressing against them in an almost teasing motion. ""So that's why you want a divorce? You want to have sex?""

Celine's face flushed bright red, like a tomato.

That wasn't what she meant.

Now, his thumb was pressed on her crimson lips, rubbing with a malicious yet seductive force. Celine hadn't expected such a flirtatious side from a man so hot and refined.

He was actually playing with her lips with his finger.

Adam had never been this close to Celine before. She always hid behind those oversized black-framed glasses, wearing plain clothes, making herself look like an older woman.

But up close, Adam noticed how small her face was. Beneath those glasses, her features were delicate and striking, and those eyes were mesmerizing.

Her lips were soft, too.

Where his finger pressed, the red faded for a moment, then returned with a slight bounce. Her lips were not just soft but tender as well. It was an enticing sight that made him want to kiss her.

Adam's eyes darkened. ""I didn't expect you to have such strong desires. Do you long for a man in you?""

Suddenly, a loud slap echoed in the villa. Celine had slapped him hard across the face.

Adam's head jerked to the side.

Celine's fingers trembled with anger. She had been too humble in her love, allowing her heart to be trampled. How dare he humiliate her like this?

Furious, she said, ""I know you've never let go of Carly. Now I'll make it easier for you. I'll return the position as Mrs. Alvarez to her!""

Adam's expression instantly turned icy, like a sheet of frost had fallen over his handsome face. He had never been slapped before—not by anyone.

He stared at her coldly. ""Celine, you thought you could just marry me when you wanted and divorce me when you felt like it? What do you take me for?""

Celine sneered. ""A plaything, of course.""

Adam couldn't believe what he heard.

Celine fought back the pain in her heart and lied, ""You're just a plaything I took from Carly. Now I'm tired of playing with you. I want to throw you away.""

Adam's expression grew darker. ""Fine, Celine. You want a divorce? Alright. But don't come crawling back to me, begging to get back together!""

With that, he stormed upstairs and slammed the door to his study.

Celine seemed to lose all her strength. Her delicate body slowly slid down the wall. She crouched on the carpet, wrapping her arms around herself.

""I won't love you anymore, Adam,"" she swore in her mind.

…

The next morning, Sofia entered Adam's study.

Adam sat at his desk, reviewing documents. He was well-known for being a workaholic.

""Mr. Alvarez,"" Sofia called out.

Adam didn't look up. Sofia could tell that he was in a bad mood. The air around him seemed to freeze.

She carefully placed a cup of coffee on the table. ""Mr. Alvarez, Mrs. Alvarez made this cup of coffee for you.""

Adam's hand holding the pen faltered. The cold expression on his face softened slightly.

Was Celine trying to make peace?

To be fair, she was a good wife. She cooked according to his preferences, hand-washed his clothes, and took care of every detail of his daily life.

Adam picked up the cup of coffee and took a sip.

Celine definitely made this. It was exactly how he liked it.

Still, he was angry. She had slapped him last night, and that anger would not be easily soothed. A cup of coffee wasn't going to fix this.

Adam asked, ""Did Celine realize her mistake?""

Sofia looked at him with a strange look. ""…Mrs. Alvarez has left.""

Adam froze, his eyes snapping up to meet Sofia's.

Just then, she took something out. ""She left with her suitcase, Mr. Alvarez. She asked me to give this to you before she left.""

As Adam took the paper and opened it, the words ""Divorce Agreement"" jumped out at him.

Adam was left speechless. He had thought she was trying to make peace.

Sofia hesitated. ""Mrs. Alvarez said you should finish the coffee and sign the papers as soon as possible.""

Adam glared at the cup of coffee. ""Throw it out! All of it!""

Sofia thought he was enjoying the coffee earlier. Why didn't he like it anymore?

However, she didn't dare voice her thoughts. She quickly grabbed the coffee and left the room.

Adam's face darkened. He scanned the divorce agreement and realized Celine agreed to leave with nothing—no alimony, no property.

He sneered bitterly. She certainly had some nerve. She didn't want a single dime from him. What could a country girl like her possibly expect to live on without money?

He remembered how, three years ago, she had done everything she could to become his wife. Wasn't it all about the money?

Then his gaze fell on the reason for the divorce written by Celine in neat handwriting. ""The husband's health does not allow him to fulfill his marital duties.""

Adam was rendered speechless. His face flushed with rage.

This damned woman!

He grabbed his phone and immediately dialed Celine's number.

The phone rang a few times before her clear, calm voice came through. ""Hello?""

Chapter 3

Adam pressed his thin lips into a hard line. ""Celine Tate, get back here now!""

Celine chuckled. ""You want me to come back just because you say so? We're divorced, Adam. I'm not going to put up with you anymore.""

Adam gritted his teeth. ""I'm giving you one more chance to rewrite the reason for the divorce.""

Celine's smile widened. ""Is there something wrong with what I wrote? You've been awake for half a year now, but in all this time, you haven't even held my hand.

""You were in a coma for three years. Although your health seems fine now, I seriously doubt your manhood is working. You should see a doctor. I sincerely hope you can regain your masculinity soon!""

Adam was speechless. The veins on his forehead were visibly pulsing.

This woman had really lost it!

""I'll show you how capable I am in bed one day, Celine Tate!"" he gritted out.

""Sorry, you don't have that chance anymore.""

""Celine!""

A couple of beeps sounded, and the call was abruptly disconnected.

Adam seethed in rage. But before he could vent, all he heard was the busy tone.

Celine Tate!

…

Celine had already arrived at her best friend, Robin Smith's apartment.

When she hung up, Robin burst into laughter and gave her a thumbs-up. ""That was perfect, Celine! He's probably so mad right now he might burst a vein.""

Celine felt that it was because she had been too humble in the past that he had come to see himself as so superior.

People should love themselves before loving others. It was crucial to prioritize one's happiness.

Robin added, ""When Carly found out Mr. Alvarez was in a coma three years ago, she left him right away. But now that he's awake, he's going after her again. Honestly, it's better to be rid of a man like him.""

Celine unwrapped a piece of candy and popped it into her mouth. The sweet taste seemed to mask the bitterness in her heart. ""Robin, that's the difference between being loved and unloved.""

The one who was loved could act without fear, while the one who was unloved always remained cautious and insecure.

Robin glanced at Celine, who had already eaten a whole bunch of candies. She pulled Celine to her feet. ""Cheer up, Celine! When you let go of one tree, you'll realize you've gained a whole forest. I'll hire eight escorts and throw you a singles' party tonight!""

Celine laughed, pressing her forehead.

At that moment, Robin reached up and took off Celine's black-framed glasses. She tossed them straight into the trash.

""My glasses!"" Celine went to retrieve them.

Robin stopped her. ""Celine, you're too used to wearing those glasses from all your academic work. You should learn from Carly and dress yourself up beautifully.""

Celine remembered how her parents called her an ugly duckling while Carly was the swan.

It seemed that it wasn't just her parents who thought so. Adam probably saw her as an ugly duckling too.

Robin pulled Celine out the door. ""Come on. I'm taking you out for a full makeover—hair, nails, outfit, everything. I want Adam and the others to open their eyes and see just how beautiful you are!""

As they were leaving, Robin suddenly remembered something. ""By the way, Celine, you really don't want any of Mr. Alvarez's money?""

""I have my own money,"" Celine replied.

""Well, then you're leaving that money to Carly. She'll probably thank you.""

Celine was rendered speechless.

""Where's the card Mr. Alvarez gave you?""

Adam had always been generous and had given Celine a gold-plated black card, but she'd never used it.

Celine pulled the card out of her purse and said with a wink, ""Mr. Alvarez can foot the bill for our shopping today.""

…

Club 1996 had long been the playground for the wealthy elite of Mercity, where the rich heirs and socialites spent their money without a second thought.

That night, the DJ kept the music going, and the crowd danced wildly.

In one of the luxurious booths, Adam sat in the center, wearing a black shirt and black pants. His sleeves were rolled up to reveal his muscular forearms and a watch worth millions. He looked every bit the hot, aristocratic figure that had women in the club constantly looking his way.

Sitting beside him was his good friend, Benjamin Goodwin—the heir to the Goodwin family—along with a few other trust fund babies.

Benjamin laughed loudly. ""What's this I hear, Adam? Celine wants a divorce?""

The others joined in the laughter.

""Who doesn't know how much Celine is in love with you, Mr. Alvarez? She even wanted to marry you when you were in a coma,"" one of them said. ""There's no way she'd leave you now!""

""We should make a bet to see how many days Celine can resist before reaching out to Mr. Alvarez,"" another chimed in.

Benjamin said, ""I bet she won't even last a day. She'll probably send Adam a message any minute now. Haha!""

Adam's face, however, was shadowed and stern, showing clear signs of anger. He pulled out his phone and opened his chat with Celine.

The last message was from the night before. Celine had sent him a picture of a bowl of chicken bone broth with the message, ""Honey, even though your bone density is fine now, you still need to drink more chicken bone broth. Remember to come home early.""

As he scrolled up, there were daily messages from Celine. He had never replied. Not once.

But tonight, there was nothing from her, and Adam felt a surge of frustration in his chest.

Just then, a notification pinged, signaling the arrival of a new message.

Benjamin immediately chimed in, ""I knew it! Celine's messaging Adam right now!""

The notification pinged repeatedly as several messages came through in quick succession.

Everyone burst out laughing. ""I knew Celine couldn't hold back, but I didn't expect her to be so eager.""

Benjamin urged, ""Adam, quick, check what she's saying. She must be crying and begging you to get back together with her.""

Adam's eyes twitched. She had messaged him?

If she wanted to make peace, why all that hostility earlier? Wasn't she the one acting tough this morning?

The moment Adam opened the message, he froze.

Benjamin read it aloud. ""Dear VVIP, your card ending in 0975 has been charged 800 dollars at Dazzling Nails.""

Everyone went silent, staring in confusion.

Adam scrolled up and saw a series of transaction messages.

Celine had spent two thousand dollars at Urban Glow Salon, 86 thousand dollars at Chanel, and 24 thousand dollars at Louis Vuitton.

There were no messages asking for reconciliation, just notifications of her spending.

The group was dumbfounded. It felt like Celine had slapped them all across the face.

Adam's face darkened as he slammed his phone onto the table. It wasn't the money that bothered him. It was that she had gone straight to spend his money after their divorce.

The woman who had been so obedient and dependent on him for the past three years suddenly seemed to have shown her true colors.

Benjamin muttered, ""What's she playing at, Adam? She's getting her nails and hair done and went shopping for clothes. Is she trying to dress up like Carly?""

""Carly's the Scarlet Rose of Mercity, while Celine is just some country bumpkin. No matter how hard she tries, she'll never match up to her.""

""A swan is a swan, and an ugly duckling will forever be an ugly duckling. It will never turn into a swan.""

The group continued laughing at Celine.

At that moment, a commotion broke out in the club. Everyone's attention was focused on one place.

Someone gasped, ""You guys, look! An angel!""

Chapter 4

Celine had arrived.

After a full day of splurging at the mall, Robin whisked her off to Club 1996 for the ultimate single-woman celebration.

What Celine didn't expect was to run into Adam and his group. Naturally, she also heard their mocking remarks about her.

She recognized the people in the luxurious booth. They were part of Adam's social circle. Benjamin, in particular, was one of Adam's closest friends.

Back when Adam and Carly had their high-profile romance, everyone in the group adored Carly. Benjamin even treated her like Adam's wife.

In the past three years, Celine had never been able to integrate into their group. They made no effort to hide their disdain for her.

They'd slapped labels on her like ""desperate replacement bride"", ""ugly duckling"", and ""country bumpkin"".

When a man didn't love her partner, his friends wouldn't respect her either.

Robin's temper flared immediately. ""I'm going to tear their smug faces off!"" She started rolling up her sleeves.

Celine grabbed her arm firmly. ""Let it go, Robin. I'm divorced now. They're not worth the energy.""

Noticing Celine's calm and indifferent demeanor, Robin managed to rein in her frustration. As more and more eyes turned to Celine, calling her an angel, Robin's mood brightened. ""Let's go. Time for a singles party!""

Robin marched them to a luxury booth on the other side of the club. She waved her hand dramatically. ""Bring me all your male escorts!""

Back at Adam's booth, Benjamin and the other scions were still mocking Celine when they suddenly felt a sharp, icy gaze land on them.

They looked up to see Adam at the head of the booth, lazily lifting his sharp eyes to glance at them. His gaze was cold, displeased, and full of warning.

At once, the laughter froze on their faces. None of them dared to say another word about Celine.

Benjamin glanced at Adam. Even though Adam had never spared Celine a second look, she had tirelessly taken care of him for three years. Clearly, Adam still had some shred of sentiment left for her.

Just then, a wave of excitement rippled through the crowd. ""Such a beautiful angel!""

Angel? Where?

Benjamin followed everyone's gaze and immediately widened his eyes in surprise. ""Holy crap! That really is an angel!""

The others around him were equally mesmerized. ""When did an angel arrive in Mercity? And how come we've never seen her before?""

Benjamin tugged at Adam's sleeve. ""Adam, look at that angel!""

Adam was no stranger to women. He'd seen all types, from slender to curvy, so he wasn't interested in that ""angel"".

However, Celine's booth was directly across from his. The moment he looked up, his eyes landed on her.

Celine had ditched her thick-rimmed glasses, shedding her usual dullness and rigidity. Her tiny face was as fair as snow. Her naturally striking features exuded a fresh, otherworldly elegance. With her silky hair cascading over her shoulders, she looked like a living, breathing angel.

Adam's gaze lingered for two full seconds.

Benjamin was clearly thrilled. ""What do you think of that angel, Adam?""

One of the scions remarked, ""Mr. Alvarez won't be impressed. His type is more of a sweet beauty like Carly, not this cool, angelic vibe.""

""Yeah, but check out her legs! Those could definitely compete with Carly's,"" another added.

Celine, in a rare departure from her usual conservative style, was wearing a chic, short tweed dress that showed off her legs for the first time.

Her legs were perfectly toned, proportionate, and tantalizing. These were the kind of legs that made men's imaginations run wild. They were just as captivating as Carly's.

Adam glanced at the ""angel"" for two seconds and couldn't shake the feeling that this woman looked strangely familiar. He felt like he had seen her somewhere before.

Just then, a group of male escorts filed into the room, each one tall and hot. They lined up right in front of Celine.

Robin grinned. ""Celine, pick eight.""

Since Celine was celebrating her newfound freedom from a disastrous marriage, she decided to go all out. ""You, you, you… Stay.""

Benjamin was counting under his breath. ""One, two, three… eight. Did she just pick eight escorts at once?""

One of the scions chimed in, ""Why spend the money? All she has to do is ask, and we'd happily volunteer for free.""

Laughter erupted around the booth.

At this moment, Adam's phone buzzed again. It was a new transaction message. He picked it up to see what Celine paid for this time.

But this time…

""Dear VVIP, your card ending in 0975 has been charged 500,000 dollars at Club 1996 for eight escorts.""

Adam frowned at once. He reread the words ""eight escorts"" twice before snapping his gaze back toward the angel across the room.

The angel who had just splurged on eight escorts was actually Celine!

Adam was rendered speechless.

Eight escorts surrounded Celine and started pouring drinks for her one after another. ""Ladies, let's play a drinking game.""

Robin happily replied, ""Hell yeah! Let's do it!""

Celine lost the first round. An escort leaned in and held a glass to her lips. ""Here, let me help you drink.""

She took the drink, but the other escorts weren't having it. ""Why him? You drank his drink but not ours? Let us feed you too!""

Celine was feeling a little overwhelmed by the eager attention.

Across the room, Adam's sharp eyes narrowed dangerously. His chiseled jaw tightened as he stood and headed straight for Celine's booth.

Benjamin was taken aback. ""Adam! Where are you going?""

Celine was sipping her drink when a strong, defined hand reached over and grabbed her delicate wrist. He lifted her off the couch as easily as if she were a child.

Shocked, she looked up and was met with Adam's handsome face.

Celine froze for a moment, then quickly struggled to pull her wrist free from his grip. ""Let go of me, Adam!""

Adam's face was cold as he forcefully dragged her away.

Robin jumped to her feet. ""Hey! Adam! What are you doing? Let go of Celine!""

Benjamin and the scions who followed Adam were stunned, their faces filled with disbelief. They all wondered if they were hearing things.

""Celine? The angel is… Celine?""

""Is this the same Celine we've always known? The ugly duckling? She's actually gorgeous?""

Benjamin froze in place as he watched Adam drag the stunning figure away. ""Damn… Celine turned into a freaking angel the moment she ditched Adam.""

…

Adam's grip on Celine's wrist was unyielding. His strong hand was like an iron shackle. No matter how hard she fought, she couldn't break free. His long strides forced her to stumble along behind him.

""Let go of me, Adam!"" she shouted.

Just then, Adam swung his hand, and Celine's delicate back slammed into the cold wall. Her vision went dark as his tall, imposing figure pressed in, trapping her against the wall.

Danger flared in his eyes as he growled, ""Do you think I'm dead, Celine Tate? You're actually out here flirting with other men?""

Chapter 5

Celine frowned. ""What do you mean by flirting?""

Adam gritted his teeth. ""You're dressing like a slut!""

What? A slut?

""You better explain, Adam Alvarez!"" Celine snapped.

Adam lowered his gaze, eyeing her short dress. ""Your thighs are practically hanging out. Is that how desperate you are for people to look at your legs?""

Sure, her dress was a little on the shorter side, but Robin had chosen the dress for her.

She had said, ""You never show your legs, giving Carly the chance to flaunt hers. Tonight, let's show everyone who really has the best legs in Mercity.""

Celine raised an eyebrow. ""Seems like you were looking at my legs, Mr. Alvarez.""

Adam froze.

Celine leaned back against the wall, her posture lazy yet elegant. She slowly lifted her right leg and brushed her crystal heel against his ankle.

Adam stood there in tailored black slacks that highlighted his long legs, exuding an air of cold elegance and restraint.

From his ankle, Celine slowly trailed upward along his calf in a teasing, deliberate motion. It was both a seduction and a provocation.

Adam gave her a cold look. ""What are you doing?""

Celine smirked. ""Mr. Alvarez, whose legs do you prefer—mine or Carly's?""

Adam's gaze lingered on her, captivated by the delicate features of her face, which radiated an almost ethereal beauty. She looked like an otherworldly angel, yet here she was, boldly tempting him.

He'd noticed her beauty last night, hidden behind those black-framed glasses, but he hadn't expected her to be so striking.

However, there was something familiar about her face.

Celine's bright eyes sparkled with mischief. ""Has Carly ever tried to seduce you with her legs, Mr. Alvarez?""

Adam's breath hitched. He leaned closer to look at her. ""Celine, are you really such a slut? You think about men all day and even hired eight escorts!""

He avoided answering her question about Carly. That was perhaps the most polite way for a man to protect a woman.

His relationship with Carly had been a grand love story from their youthful, carefree days. Carly must have seduced him at some point. That was the only way to explain why she lingered so vividly in his memory.

Carly was truly blessed to have such a cold-hearted man remain devoted to her for so long. Adam must have never used a word like ""slut"" to describe her.

Though Celine was smiling, her eyes remained as cold as ice. ""Yes, Mr. Alvarez. There's an issue with your manhood. Since you can't satisfy me, I have to go find someone healthy. Let's get divorced already. If one man doesn't work, I'll find another who does.""

She said he had issues again! This woman was unbelievable!

Adam gripped her delicate jaw. ""Is this some sort of provocation? Are you so desperate to find out if I have issues?""

What?

Celine froze.

Adam leaned in close, his lips hovering near hers with an almost teasing proximity. Yet his words were icy and detached. ""Don't kid yourself, Celine. I'll never touch you. The one I love is Carly.""

The one he loved was Carly.

He didn't even need to say it. Celine already knew. Still, hearing it stung her heart. It wasn't a sharp pain, but a dull, relentless ache that spread in countless tiny waves.

Just then, a sweet voice rang out. ""Adam.""

Celine looked up only to see Carly standing there.

Carly, the renowned Scarlet Rose of Mercity, was a beauty with ruby lips and pearly teeth. Years of dance training had given her a graceful, supple figure.

Seeing her, Adam instantly released Celine and strode toward Carly. He lowered his gaze to meet hers. His eyes were filled with a warmth Celine had never seen before. ""You're here!""

Carly nodded before glancing at Celine. ""And this is?"" Carly didn't recognize her at all.

But Celine would never forget Carly.

The truth was, Celine and Carly were neither full nor half-sisters. Hayden wasn't Celine's biological father. He was her stepfather.

Once, Celine had a happy family. Her father, Aaron Tate, and her mother, Lucy Garcia, had been devoted to each other.

Aaron loved her dearly. He would lift her high into the air every day. ""My little Celine is going to grow up so happy.""

Then, one day, he was gone. His brother, Hayden, moved in with his daughter, Carly, into Aaron's house, and Lucy became Carly's mother as well.

Lucy remarried Celine's uncle. From then on, her affection was directed solely toward Carly, not Celine.

When Carly scored 99 on an exam and Celine scored 100, Lucy punished her. ""Why can't you let Carly shine? Do you always have to outdo her?""

When Carly fell ill, her hair was shaved off for chemotherapy. She cried that she looked ugly. Lucy immediately shaved Celine's head. ""You need to become ugly with Carly. That way, she'll stop crying.""

Night after night, Lucy, Hayden, and Carly would cuddle together, their laughter spilling out into the hallway. Celine would stand outside, crying while clutching the doll that Aaron had bought her. ""Mommy, I'm scared.""

Eventually, Carly started calling Lucy ""Mommy"". Lucy was thrilled, but Carly said, ""Mommy, you can only have one daughter.""

On a rainy day, Lucy drove Celine to the countryside and left her there.

Little Celine chased the car while sobbing. ""Don't leave me, Mommy! I'll be a good girl. I'll listen to you. I'll let Carly have everything! I want a hug, Mommy! I'm scared!""

Clutching her doll, she fell heavily into the mud. She watched helplessly as Lucy drove away, disappearing from her sight.

Celine would never forget Carly.

At this moment, Benjamin rushed over. ""Carly, she's your sister. She's Celine!""

Carly froze in disbelief. ""You're… Celine?""

Celine knew Carly had always looked down on her.

As children, Carly had bested her at every turn. She had always been outstanding. Later, she even dated Adam, the heir to the Alvarez family.

Raised in a life of luxury and affection, Carly became proud and untouchable.

Benjamin was once again stunned by Celine's exquisite beauty. He murmured, ""I didn't expect Celine to look this stunning.""

Carly's childhood memories of Celine were vague because she had never paid much attention to this unloved sister. But wasn't Celine the ugly duckling from the countryside?

Carly stepped closer. Her gaze swept over Celine with thinly veiled disdain. ""Celine, I didn't expect you to doll yourself up like me.""

Celine was rendered speechless.

Well, Carly could think whatever she wanted as long as she was happy.

Celine straightened her slender back and smiled without saying a word. The corridor lights cast a soft glow on her delicate, ethereal face. She was no longer the same little Celine from before.

Just then, Carly spoke up. ""Celine, I heard you and Adam are divorcing. Can't survive without a man, huh? Resorting to male escorts to fill the void? If I were you, I'd get a job.""

Turning to Adam, she added in a condescending tone, ""Adam, Celine has taken care of you for so long. You should at least help her find work. Maybe as a housekeeper.""

Adam's gaze flickered to Celine.

Benjamin interjected, ""Carly, every job requires qualifications. What's Celine's education level?""

Carly seemed to remember something amusing. She raised her chin with a smile and said, ""She dropped out of school when she was 16.""

So not only is it brewing coffee that has had literally zero resting time, it apparently didn't have a good ventilation option, so it'll fill the house with the roasting smells/smoke (roasting smells don't necessarily start nice, being more grassy/vegetal to begin with, and smoke is not good, like, ever).

Of course it used proprietary pods of green beans, because why not make a bad idea worse.

1ldj8ex,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1ldj8ex/broke_up_and_am_broken/,Broke up and am broken,"So me (28F) had been dating this guy (27M) for almost a year. He had gotten out of a toxic relationship as he claims because she lied to him, cheated on him. We started talking because of this. He opened up one day and I tried to make him feel better about it because I had been in a similar situation before.
After a couple of months, he told me I wish I’d found you before. Then a few weeks later told me he liked me. I didn’t feel anything as such for him, never saw him romantically. I told him clearly as well that I’m not ready, I got out of a relationship too and don’t see him that way. He constantly did things for me that showed me he actually cared, was very gentlemanly, would take care of little things, say the right things so I fell in love. Naive. He had some traits I didn’t like such as taking a cigarette box from the smoking zone which wasn’t his, commenting on someone’s body type, etc which were against my values, but with time idk why I ignored these. I’ve always been kind, nice and supportive to him and he’s never told me he has a problem with anything with me. 
We work at the same workplace. He used to come up to my desk 4-5 times to talk. I noticed he started doing the same with this other girl and I told him I didn’t like it. My instincts told me something was off as he was playing with her hair clutcher, putting it in her nose. I told him 3 times over several incidents (once he went on a break with her despite knowing I wasn’t okay and hurting, once when I came back alone from a break he was playing UNO with her). I very clearly stated I didn’t like it and he kept doing it so I told him I’m done with him. He sent some sorry texts and that he won’t talk to anyone at work anymore. For 2 days I noticed he didn’t get up from his seat but didn’t talk to me either. I wanted him to.
I have anxiety issues and I wanted to clear things although I know y’all will judge me that no self worth etc. but I was shocked and actually still can’t accept it. 
So I went and talked to him and he said sorry, he didn’t realize it would be that big of a deal and he didn’t think it through. My stupid ass accepted that but didn’t stop questioning things. The next day I saw he had added her on Instagram and I asked him why after all this? He said he didn’t know and she was added before. I was sure she wasn’t because I checked the followers following (I was paranoid) and he constantly kept lying to my face and wouldn’t accept it. I asked him to leave again that day and was heartbroken. The next day he came over and said I was wrong, I’ll take accountability etc and will fix this. Still didn’t accept that he added her. I texted her from his acc and found out he had deleted texts. He also accepted that he met her once for coffee, that too only when I said I’ll directly ask her so if there’s anything else I need to know just tell me now. He told me he only texted her that she was cute but I spoke to the girl and saw the desperate messages he sent her like - you must be tired of doing the assignments, let’s meet. He asked like 5 times. The girl wasn’t interested but went to meet because she needs help from him at work. She even asked him what’s going on between you two to which he replied I don’t wanna talk about it. 

After all this happened, I constantly sent him paragraphs to let him know how he hurt me and he kept telling me I never meant to, not intentionally. I’ll do anything. He didn’t mean it, lied again about something and said to me I’m just bad energy for you and hope we cross paths someday and you can see I’m not this person, I’m better. 

I haven’t spoken to him since but I keep spiraling constantly and thinking about everything. I can’t sleep at nights, my heart feels heavy and like i would pass out. Can someone help getting over it? I’m trying walking, reading books, hanging out with family etc, nothing seems to be helping. I can’t think about anything else. I’m broken.",1,1750154632.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

1ldj6y2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SCPSecretLab/comments/1ldj6y2/entrance_zone_researcher_rooms_miscellaneous/,Entrance Zone Researcher Rooms + Miscellaneous suggestions,"I think that the doors to the researcher rooms should be openable. It would not only be a good lore drop but also could provide keycards/weapons that doesn't exist naturally at many other places.

Personally, I would like it to be a room with a desk and a desk chair facing the door, with a computer (either on or off). There would be bookshelfs with books, papers and keycards. For the door, it would be nice if it could be opened with a Scientist keycard, to avoid Guards taking the possible keycard. There could also be a body of a scientist body somewhere with an obvious cause of death (eg, shot in the head, decapitated, etc.) Of course, there would be a camera in one of the corners so that SCP-079 could look inside.

I'll give a few suggestions on what items could be inside:

* Major Scientist Keycard, bookshelf + desk (for a little bonus).
* Radio, desk (to contact security).
* First Aid Kit, wall (to heal).
* Quarter, desk (due to a possible coffee machine, suggestion #1).
* SCP Document, bookshelf + desk (lore, suggestion #2)

  
**Suggestion** \#**1**, Coffe Machine:

Either:

1. A big, bulky machine that, if someone puts a quarter in, pours a (styrofoam) cup of coffee. Are in the hallways in LCZ and EZ. Gives a reason to get quaters.
2. A coffee-making machine in the research rooms, pouring coffee in a mug. Usually found on desks in LCZ, HCZ and EZ. A few could be found broken on the floor to signify a struggle (that produces no coffee).

The coffee made in the coffee machines should give a small boost in energy with a slight blur. The effects should dissipate after a minute and should only slightly boost eachother (20% first time, 10% time second time, 1% third time, etc.). Basically a bad version of SCP-207.

There must be a few rooms with the coffee machine, and preferably in the Light Containment Zone and Entrance Zone to avoid exploitation.

  
**Suggestion** \#**2**, SCP Document:

An A4 piece of paper that has a short part of the official article. Has a change to spawn on all desks through LCZ to EZ. Document could be about:

* SCP-173
* SCP-049
* SCP-096
* SCP-079
* SCP-106
* SCP-939

or any SCP in the SCP boxes.

Could also be signed or approved by a researcher or agent.

  
**Suggestion** \#**3**, SCP-178:

This is an intressting game mechanic that would allow Spectators, as SCP-178 specimens, communicate with living players. The Spectators would be ""walking"" infront or ""standing"" somewhere where the player would see. It should only be proximity chat and can only

SCP-178 could be found randomly on the floor in LCZ or in a containment box. Someone can also only wear them for a minute before a cooldown happenes because the player becomes disturbed by what they see/can't take seeing with 3d classes and need time to put them on again.

Possible lore: SCP-178 was moved to Site-02 due to the shutdown/budget cuts of Site/Facility-X. It was decided by the researcher (name) to keep it in a standard SCP containment box.",1,1750154480.0,SCPSecretLab,0,1.0,False

1ldj46p,https://forms.gle/SDGZs1Xm3njWunGV8,Interesting Study on Maladaptive Daydreaming,"**Ever acted out your daydreams? Or do you daydream at all? Is it pleasurable? Distressing? Or maybe... both?**

Have you ever found yourself lost in a world so vivid it almost feels real? A story so intricate and absorbing that you catch yourself pacing, whispering lines, moving your hands as if you were actually *there* in your mind’s creation? If this resonates with you, you might be brushing up against the phenomenon known as **maladaptive daydreaming**—an emerging psychological construct that sits at the curious intersection of fantasy and dysfunction.

🎓 **About Me:**  
Hi, I’m **Arya Jade**, a postgraduate student in **Clinical Psychology** at **Christ University, Bangalore**. My current research dives deep into a topic that is as mysterious as it is relatable:

>

This isn’t just an academic curiosity. For many, maladaptive daydreaming isn’t mere zoning out. It is an intricate, emotionally loaded experience that can last for hours, involving imagined characters, elaborate plots, and sometimes even ritualized physical movements to enhance the fantasy. People may laugh, cry, or act out scenes in private. And while it can be deeply pleasurable, it can also interfere with daily life, academic functioning, relationships, and emotional health. The line between creativity and compulsion becomes blurred, and that is where the science comes in.

🌱 **You’re eligible if:**  
✅ You're aged between **18–30**  
✅ You’re **comfortable with English**  
🌍 Open to participants **from anywhere in the world**

🕒 **What’s Involved:**  
Just a **5 to 10 minute** online survey  
Completely **anonymous** and **voluntary**  
No identifying information is collected  
You’re free to **exit anytime** with no strings attached

🔍 Through this research, we’re hoping to uncover how patterns of excessive daydreaming are related to **empathy** (our ability to understand others) and **rumination** (our tendency to overthink or dwell). Are people who daydream more likely to empathize with fictional or real-world suffering? Or does their emotional energy get stuck in internal loops? These are the questions that might help refine how we understand not just maladaptive daydreaming, but also broader mechanisms of mental health in young adults.

💡 **Why Participate?**  
📖 You’ll get **free access** to the final research paper  
🧘 We’ll share **helpful wellness resources** and curated **memes**  
🎶 You’ll receive a **custom playlist** based on the study’s theme

1ldj40j,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ldj40j/the_alarm_part_1_every_night_it_starts_at_313_am/,The Alarm – [Part 1]  Every night it starts at 3:13 A.M.,"**Day One**

It started at 3:13 A.M.

The day after my 30th birthday — and it hasn’t stopped since.

I was asleep when I heard it. A burglar alarm outside my window. Not loud enough to jolt you upright, just enough to burrow in — like a mosquito whining inside your skull.

**EEEEEEEEEE—EEEEEEEEEE—EEEEEEEEEE**

That first night, I rolled over, buried my head under the pillow, hoping the security company or some neighbor would shut it off. But instead, it kept on going. Nudging me awake. Relentless.

It didn’t stop until exactly 6:00 A.M.

Silence.

I hadn’t slept a wink. My train left at seven. Coffee. Shower. Suck it up.

One night of broken sleep was doable. Brush it off and move along.

But when it happened the next night — I’d had enough.

**Day Two**

**3:13 A.M.**

**EEEE—**

I grabbed my headphones. Noise-canceling. Listened to forest rain.

Didn’t matter. The alarm was still there, invading my headphones like an unwelcome guest.

Same tone. Same volume. Same outcome: no sleep.

You don’t realize how much you need it… until it’s taken away.

⸻

Later that morning, I called the city council.

“I don’t know where it’s coming from,” I told the clerk. “Somewhere south of my apartment. Every night for the last two days. From 3:13 A.M. to 6:00 A.M.”

They were sympathetic — at first. We’ve all had bad nights. Barking dogs. Car alarms. Noisy couples.

But when I asked if anyone else had complained?

“Sir,” she said flatly. “We’ve checked. There are no alarms on record.”

“What — no one else hears it?”

“We have nothing logged in the system.”

They needed an address. I was on my own.

⸻

I passed out at my desk. Missed a critical Zoom call. Tanked a huge contract. Got chewed out by my boss.

“That was unacceptable,” he hissed.

What was I supposed to say, other than “please don’t fire me” under my breath?

Time to take action. I checked into a hotel across town.

Fresh bed. Clean slate. Giant yawn. No alarm.

\_\_\_\_\_

**Day Three**

**3:13 A.M.**

Shit.

I slapped my phone off the nightstand in disgust. Convinced I was being stalked by a sound, and I was its prey.

Now what?

I stuffed towels under the door and climbed into the bathtub, trying to soundproof the room with a makeshift coffin of sheets.

Somewhere in the dark, a thought came:

If I superglued my ears shut… would it finally stop?

I told myself I was joking. I wasn’t sure I believed it.

⸻

**Day Four**

**2:45 A.M.**

I lay awake, watching the digital clock tick down. Each glowing white number pressing into my chest.

**3:13 A.M.**

Fuck. Again.

I felt like a target. Someone using that alarm to hollow out my brain.

I stood on my balcony — city skyline in my sights.

Where are you coming from?

Where would I even start?

I grabbed my phone. Hit the pavement. Started walking to find the source.

**4:58 A.M.**

Nothing.

Over an hour of chasing shadows. Every corner. Every alleyway. It was like the sound moved. Made me go in circles.

Bus stop. I collapsed onto the bench. Too exhausted to stand. Too exhausted to move.

Hoping a Greyhound would collect me and take this all away.

⸻

**Day Five**

Fired.

Train ride home. Box of belongings. Crushed dignity.

I stared blankly out the window until a sticker on the train wall caught my eye:

**DON’T FOLLOW THE TONE**

My stomach twisted.

Was this a joke?

I leaned in. Someone had scribbled numbers beneath the sticker:

**11.670 MHz**

It felt like a prank. Some new kind of scam.

But when I Googled it… it was real.

A shortwave frequency — listed on a few ham radio sites.

And it had a name:

**“The Murmurs.”**

What the hell was that?

I downloaded a tuner app, just to check it out. You could scan live bands from across the globe — crackling dispatches from container ships, mountain men in their huts.

But 11.670 MHz was odd.

Officially, it belonged to a religious broadcaster in Moldova.

But instead of a sermon, a voice was saying this:

…DON’T FOLLOW THE TONE… DON’T FOLLOW THE TONE…

Same words of warning, caught in a loop.

Female. Urgent. Husky, like she smoked.

⸻

What was I even doing?

I needed to fix my life. So I got off two stops early, to clear my head and walk. I breathed deep. The chilly breeze scraped my lungs — a decent distraction.

And then I saw the store.

Second-hand electronics. A dusty ham radio in the window.

If the warning was real, I wanted to know more.

Bought a shortwave radio. Guy behind the counter gave me a crash course.

That night, I set up my balcony like a watch post. City lights blinking in the distance. Radio tuned. Antenna high.

My résumé could wait.

⸻

**Day Six**

**3:13 A.M.**

The alarm screamed.

**Click.**

The radio lit up. A green LED blinked. Then came the voice:

“This is The Murmurs with an Emergency Broadcast. If you’re hearing this — stay inside. The tone is active. I repeat: we have an active tone.”

I grabbed the mic.

“Hello? I can hear it. Please. I haven’t slept. I don’t know what’s happening.”

**Silence.**

“You’re not supposed to be on this channel.”

“I saw the sticker. The numbers. I’ve been hearing it for days.”

“That was a mistake.”

“It’s ruining my life. How do I stop it?”

“You’re not ready. Don’t come back.”

**Click.**

Silence swallowed the signal. Her voice replaced by the alarm knocking against my skull.

“Jesus…”

None of this felt real.

I stared at my radio and listened to it hum.

That should’ve been the end. Her instructions were clear.

But tomorrow, I’ll be back. 3:13 A.M. Waiting for the hum.

But if anyone else has heard it…

I was debating whether to write this. I guess I'll give this a shot.



My father died at the age of 90. He left this world on Friday (June 13, 2025) last week, I think. (Or maybe early June 14, I'm not sure). I decided not to go that day because I was thinking of visiting him on June 15 (Father's Day). I already saw him last Saturday (June 7). He was sleepy. When the nurse woke him up, he looked at me and my mother, but didn't talk so much. The nurse held his hands and said they were cold. I thought that maybe he was cold because it was cold that day, and the room was cold. I guess I was denial that it was a bad sign to come. I was hopeful that he would get better.



Actually I did get a phone call from his case manager on June 6. They said he was able to go home next week but that they need him to be in the hospital for a few days before the discharge. They also added great news that he didn't need dialysis anymore. He was on dialysis for three times a week for about a month.



I enjoyed the visit on Tuesday, June 3, because he was alert and was speaking with us. I saw that the nurses removed the IV with antibiotics and that he was moved to a room far from the nurses station. I thought that meant that he was getting better. The nurse even said that he ate all his breakfast that morning.



I wish I had visited him on the 8th, 10th, and 12th of June. But due to the protests in Downtown Los Angeles, it made commuting to the hospital even longer. It took about 2 to 4 hours to get to the hospital by bus before the protests happened. I couldn't burden any family members with a vehicle to ask for a ride. It was just too expensive to get a paid ride, like taxis, ride share.



I just wish the first hospital could have sent my father to a better hospital closer to home, but they didn't. He was admitted to the first hospital on April 22 for an emergency. He was in the ICU. It was a shock to see him there with a breathing mask and unconscious. I was sure he was going to pass away in a matter of days. But he did pull through in the first hospital for almost 3 weeks. I always wonder if he would be alive if he had stayed at the first hospital.



The second hospital was for long term care. He was there for most of May and almost two weeks of June. I just wish he had fought harder to live. I think he gave up toward the end. He wasn't eating his breakfast on Thursday, June 5, and Saturday, June 7, that I noticed. He just drank his water, milk, and sometimes coffee.



I do feel guilty for not visiting him the week of June 8 to 13. I was already tired and drained from the commute. I don't know how my mother mustered the energy to go visit him on the 11th and 13th, but she did.



I just keeping re-playing the moments on April 21 the day before he fell ill. He was fine on April 21. I remember him finishing his lunch. He went to the kitchen. I was in the kitchen and got his tray to wash the dishes for him. Then he went to rest on his bed.



I don't know how I got to write this long. LOL Anyway, he was 90. I remember he said he was going to live until 100. I so wish he did live to 100, but it didn't unfortunately.



I wish I could hug him in the hospital, but it was difficult. I only got to stroke his hair, head, and wipe the hair from his forehead. His gray hair was long. I wish I had cut a lock of his hair to keep as a memento. When he was well at home, I kept asking him if he wanted a haircut. He kept saying no. I guess he didn't want to sit in one place.



I still have his clothes and sneakers in my room. The clothes that he was supposed to wear when he was discharged from the hospital. I kept debating whether I should have brought the clothes. In my mind, I was afraid of jinxing it. I kept thinking if I brought the clothes, he wouldn't be able to come home. Unfortunately, that did happen. But he had asked for his clothes and sneakers. I found myself hugging his track jacket for the past few days. I imagine hugging him whenever I hugged the jacket.



I also regret not taking recent photos and videos of us as a family. I can remember his voice right now. But I'm afraid that as time goes by, I'll forget the sound of his voice. I do have photos of him in the past. We don't have any recent photos of us for the past decade! Well, except for his ID.



I just wish he were here well and healthy at home lying on his bed and watching tv. If not watching his tv, reading his book, or reading the online newspapers on the internet which he did every night.



I miss him so much. :(",1,1750153938.0,u_pauleywauley,0,1.0,False

Me and a couple of friends are looking to get into flipping items for fun and hopefully a bit of profit. We’ve got a shared budget of about $500 to start with, and we’re mainly planning to use platforms like Facebook Marketplace, OfferUp, Craigslist, etc. We’re not expecting to get rich or anything, but we want to learn the process, have fun, and maybe make $20+ per flip.

We’ve already done some research (mainly scrolling through flipping subreddits and YouTube) and have seen some people recommend things like small kitchen appliances (air fryers, coffee machines), tech like AirPods, and stuff like that. But we’re still not totally sure what the safest and most reliable items are, especially when you’re just starting out and trying to avoid risky or slow-moving stuff.

So I wanted to ask the community:",0,1750153628.0,Flipping,0,0.25,False

Here's My Results so Far...,"So about 3 weeks ago, I watched Can Eye's YouTube video, showing off the ViralVue software. It's a Chrome extension, that shows various Amazon Influencer information, kind of like SortioX. So, you will see if your video is placed or not, whether the upper carousel is full or not, yada yada.

But the paid versions give more info. For example, you can see just HOW many Influencer videos are on each product. For example, if there's 84 videos, it's probably not worth your time. One video I used to be placed on in the top carousel now has 1015 videos!!

The other thing it does, is comb through your on site videos, and search for active and upcoming Creator Connections campaigns. That's awesome. For me, it just found 8 campaigns, only one of which has made something in 2 weeks ($22). But I stay in niche, and I already found most relevant campaigns manually. I bet this feature could be great for people with more videos (I only have 250), and spread out over wider niches.

In the end, I don't know if it's worth it for me, but it has given me a lot more data to think about, such as the total revenue for the last 30 days. That lets me know whether or not to even bother with a video. So, it's a cool tool, but I wish it didn't cost so much. I am paying $71 per month currently, but I will probably stop the subscription, unless it finds me some campaigns that my videos do well on.

1ldiwlo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ldiwlo/i_think_i_was_living_with_a_narcissist_i_feel/,i think i was living with a narcissist. i feel disgusted i was around her for so long. i want revenge.,"lived with her for 3 years. she started by building trust with me and using triangulation to place seeds of doubt in everyone. she was pitting other 2 girls against each other, while building trust with me. when there were 3 of us, she pitted me and the other girl against each other til we hated each other. i didn’t realize at the time she was, cause i truly was unaware of most of the drama at the time. i always felt confused about whats going on.

she then started to make moral comparisons/gaslighting to make me feel like my perception of things is distorted and i might also be partially bad. this worked on me, i started to second guess  myself and if my reactions were because i’m just mean and sensitive, and that the other girl that hated me and was mean to me but not the other girl for a reason, if i’m creating some of the problems.

this was 1.5 years into it, and the first time she truly got in my head. it kicked in this obsessive need for clarity in me. moral clarity and a need to figure out the “problem” and fix things.

a lot of these things i did, i didn’t realize at the time, but i felt the need to ask a bunch of questions to the narcissist. she hinted at me being un empathetic, so i just felt like asking her, “who do you think is most to least empathetic out of the three of us?” she said her, me, other girl. i said i’m not sure who. i don’t even know anymore what empathy is or what makes someone empathetic or not. what is your definition of empathy? she just said idk or brushed it off i think.

i asked her why she keeps telling me the things other people are saying behind my back. asked her if shes done with the drama too, why doesn’t she put her foot down? i got frustrated and told her, the other girl tried to talk about you to me once months ago, i shut it down and she never did it again, i protected her from being a target. then i, not purposely this was genuine at the time, fed her an excuse. i asked if shes scared of the other girl and is afraid of conflict. she said ya, i realized i’m an extreme people pleaser. she, a couple weeks later she told me she purposely flipped one of our roommates against the other by feeding her a complaint, she said “i know shes playing both sides and im not gonna let that happen” she said she did it to protect the both of us from the drama/being targeted. 

i also at some point asked her what traits she values, like top 5 or 10. i remember cooperation, self-respect, respect, honesty, security, forgiveness, fairness were some of the ones she threw around. i remember her answers seemed much more similar to mine than i thought. honesty seemed off to me. i said “don’t u believe ur an extreme people pleaser? doesn’t that kinda contradict highly valuing honesty?” she tried to justify but then just said “my personality is different back home”

she also, despite saying she hates the other girl, would always say “maybe” when she invited us to hang out with the friend group. she would say maybe even at times she knew she wouldn’t go. i asked her why not just say no. she said - i like when people don’t have expectations of me. i asked her if she feels bad that others can feel let down. she just said no.

then we had winter break and i was away from both of them for a month. i felt calm. when i came back and she talked about the drama with me i had a completely different approach. instead of fixating on it, i just said i’m proud of the times i did try to openly shut things down. i cant change the past or dwell on things, this has all been too confusing, i’m just gonna look forward now. i still feel bad for the other girl, even though she shit talked me, shes insecure about alot of things and easily triggered - shes been hurt alot, hope she gets better. 

about 2 weeks later, she started playing hot and cold with me. this did also somewhat work on me, i started feeling like a burden and i was overwhelming and then i kept snapping out of it. the other girl did the same and then towards the end was away a lot and living with her boyfriend. she would hide in her room, snap at me out of nowhere, give me minimal responses. then switch to telling me something shes going thru and saying i’m the only one who knows, or no one else know how to help her. i thought she must be going thru things and i felt bad for needing boundaries. she also, i now realize, would flip to “hot” the minute i decided to leave her alone and hang out with my other friends. 

one time she tried to “win me back” by being super sweet and buying me coffee and i called her out right away, “are you only doing this because you feel bad cause u were annoyed with me” she denied “omg noooo i’m so sorry you felt that way, not at all! awwww i feel so bad” this was the creepiest thing i’ve ever seen. her response, it felt like not human. like, there wasn’t a smooth transition from her reaction to my call out and her response. im not sure how to explain but it felt like she flipped on a lightswitch. her tone/inflection was exaggerated, a tone ive never heard from her before or heard anything similar. 

i recently realized its the same exact tone i use in storytelling. shes pointed out multiple times how i “use tons of voices” when speaking. its a specific tone shes heard alot from me, and a couple times from my mom. its how my family speaks/jokes - its purposely exaggerated for a joke, and wouldn’t normally use it. like ex. my uncle will ask “be honest, am i crazy” ill use that tone and say “yaaa, i think so, but thats ok” i noticed she used my jokes alot with her friends, her boyfriend and her friends will say something funny she said to me, and it was always my joke. 

the last year, once it was her and i only, she hid from me almost the entire time. she would randomly stop, talk to me like normal, and i talked to her like normal. i guess i just thought she was going thru something and it didn’t bother me. she tried to have her boyfriend stay over, i’m guessing to recreate the buffer. he flew back and forth, 30 days total between 60 days. last time it happened i said this is too much. he never came again. she distanced again. 

last week before i moved out, she for the first time in a while tried emotional dumping with me again. told me how all the drama really affected her, she thinks shes broken, she cant feel her emotions, and she feels guilty for some things she did. i talked to her about it, let her feelings have the solo stage, she said “i like that im not taking the easy route and im reflecting back on things”

then when she was bringing it up again, i talked from my perspective. she didn’t like that i said she was just trying to protect herself or labeling myself as a target. i asked her if X girl was really as bad as we thought?” she said “no shes full of hate blah blah drama addicted” i asked “weren’t u guys just too sides of the same coin though?  u both played along. u both were just protecting urself from being the target in different ways”

the very last thing. 5 days before i moved out. she was all sweet and reading a book. i was doing homework. it was quiet. she said “im going to bed, goodnight” she went in her room. left the door a bit open. called her mom+ boyfriend on speaker phone. then that lightswitch feeling happened again. she started wailing. saying we all ruined her, why am i punishing her, whats wrong with me, she needs serious help now. thats when i saw it all immediately. 

i saw her tactics to tell me off in a way where i cant push back/indirect, she tried to shut down my side and push her guilt to me, she knew i am hyper vigilant and would listen, she knew i feel bad for others despite their actions, she knew i sometimes put others feelings above my own. i was and still am disgusted by her now. she tried to test how im feeling twice before i moved out. she said “brooo (old roommate) is texting me fuck ew shes at graduation visiting” i just responded “go say hi” and she tried to talk once and i just gave her minimal and seemed sad i guess i was mourning a bit the care and energy i put into the relationship. i moved out, texted her basic stuff, she gave me minimal response. its been a month and she hasn’t texted me at all. trying to keep peace since lease isn’t broken yet. 

i’m not gonna talk to her unless she reaches out first. if she reaches out first, i don’t know what ill do. part of me wants revenge. i kinda want her to play victim again, i want to pretend i believe her and ask more questions so i can get more of a story out of her, and i want her to try to paint the other girl as the villain and just screenshot it and send it to that girl. im pissed, her and i hated eachother at the end and blocked eachother on everything. i dont know if its worth it, i dont think she can provoke me anymore. she disgusts me. i feel nauseous thinking my 2 cats were living there. thats what gets me the most. they didnt like her.",1,1750153347.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Had this wild coffee chat last week that's been stuck in my head...

Met this founder naming him (Sam )who built an AI tool that turns text into visual content. Went from zero to $4K MRR in under a year with 86% profit margins. The crazy part? He's thinking about walking away from it.

**Here's what happened:**

Sam threw up a landing page in early 2024, got 400 people to pre-pay for something that didn't exist, then built the whole thing in 3 weeks. Total revenue is almost $90K with monthly costs under $200.

In December, he posted ONE piece of content on social media. Result? 1 million views and $30K in revenue that month.

The guy has 240K free users, barely does any marketing, and converts 30-35% of visitors to signups. He's basically sitting on a goldmine and doesn't even realize it.

**Plot twist:**

I happen to work with someone who was desperately looking for exactly this - a profitable AI tool with massive untapped potential.

Made an introduction.

**Two weeks later:**

Sam texted me: ""I'm already working on my next idea, and knowing my business is with someone who actually enjoys scaling? Best outcome possible.""

The new owner is loving their first acquisition and already planning expansion. Same business, totally different energy.

**The thing is:** Good profitable businesses don't stay available long. And founders ready to move on deserve someone who appreciates what they built.

In their third year of marriage, Emma's wedding certificate was accidentally ruined by spilled coffee.

When she went to the county clerk's office to replace it, the clerk typed a few keystrokes and looked up with a puzzled expression. ""Ma'am, your marital status shows as single.""

She froze, certain she'd misheard. ""That's impossible. My husband and I got our license right here three years ago.""

The clerk checked again, her expression growing increasingly awkward. ""The system confirms you're single, but Mr. Chase is listed as married..."" She hesitated. ""His spouse is registered as another woman—Stella Reed. Do you know her?""

Emma's mind exploded with white noise, her ears ringing sharply.

Everyone knew Emma and Dominic Chase had grown up together. She was his first love, the one he'd protected fiercely since childhood.

And Stella Reed?

She was the replacement Dominic had found during the two years Emma studied abroad—someone to fill the void when he missed her too much.

\---

Emma clutched the coffee-stained fake marriage certificate as she numbly got into her car.

Her phone vibrated twice, and Dominic's message appeared on the screen.

\[Baby, I ditched a billion-dollar deal, bought your favorite roses and that strawberry cake you love, just so I could come home early to be with you. I miss you so much. Do you miss me?\]

She stared at the message and let out a hollow laugh that quickly dissolved into tears streaming down her cheeks.

For three years, he'd asked her that same question daily, expressing his supposed devotion.

But all along... he'd been legally married to someone else behind her back.

She remembered when they were children, how Dominic had fallen from a ten-foot tree trying to retrieve her kite, breaking his arm but still smiling as he handed her the kite, saying, ""Don't cry, Em. It doesn't hurt.""

She remembered her fifteenth birthday, when he stood in the rain outside her house all night just to be the first to wish her happy birthday when she woke up.

She remembered her eighteenth birthday celebration, when he rented an entire amusement park and knelt beneath exploding fireworks, saying, ""Emma, when I turn twenty-two, will you marry me?""

She remembered when she left to study abroad, how he'd pressed her against the airport wall, his voice trembling: ""Two years. I'm only giving you two years, and then I'm coming to bring you back.""

During those two years overseas, he video-called almost daily.

Once when she was too busy with essays to answer for three days, she discovered he'd been hospitalized for alcohol poisoning.

Through the screen, his bloodshot eyes pleaded: ""Baby, I can't live without you.""

She always reassured him: ""I'll be home soon. Just wait a little longer.""

The day she returned, she didn't tell Dominic, wanting to surprise him.

Instead, when she pushed open the door to his private club room, she found him passionately kissing a girl whose profile looked strikingly similar to her own.

Her bag dropped with a thud, and she fled.

Dominic chased after her like a madman. When she wouldn't answer his calls, he bombarded her with messages. When she refused to see him, he stood in the rain outside her apartment, explaining over and over.

""It's not what you think!""

""I missed you so much these years when you wouldn't let me visit, so I found someone who reminded me of you...""

""I swear, we just hugged and kissed, nothing more!""

""Emma, I was wrong, but I truly love you to the point of insanity...""

Finally, after he stood in the rain for three days and nights, collapsing with pneumonia and still refusing to leave the hospital, her heart softened, and she forgave him.

Afterward, he treated her just as wonderfully as before.

Until after they married, when she discovered his assistant had been replaced by Stella Reed. That ""replacement"" he claimed to have sent away.

He explained again: ""Her parents are sick, and they struggled adjusting to the city life. She begged to come back to North Bay...""

""She applied for my assistant position without my knowledge.""

""She's exceptionally qualified and passed all the selection rounds. I can't just fire her without cause.""

So Emma tolerated it again.

Never imagining that her tolerance would turn her into the butt of a cosmic joke.

As her car pulled into their gated community, Emma's tears had dried.

She took a deep breath, about to push open the front door when she overheard Dominic talking with his friend in the living room:

""I just came from the hospital. Stella's fine, just some minor scrapes. You should stay home with Emma, don't worry.""

Dominic lounged on the sofa, his black shirt unbuttoned at the collar, long legs crossed. He frowned and extinguished his friend's cigarette, his voice low and cold: ""How many times have I told you not to smoke in my house? Emma hates the smell.""

""Fine, fine, you obsessive husband,"" his friend teased. ""But I really don't understand—if you love Emma so much, why did you insist on marrying Stella? Honestly, is she more than just a replacement to you?""

The air stilled for several seconds.

Then Dominic's deep voice broke the silence:

""What if she is?""

""I used to think she was just a stand-in until Emma returned. Then I wouldn't need her anymore.""

""But after sending her away, I dreamed about her almost every night.""

""Eventually I couldn't stand her not being near me, so I brought her back as my assistant.""

""I can't live without Emma, but Stella... I can't let her go either.""

""Emma gets my public devotion, while Stella stays in the shadows with a marriage certificate as compensation. What's wrong with that?""

His friend sighed. ""Aren't you afraid Emma will find out? With her personality, if she ever discovers this, you could die at her feet and she'd never look back.""

Dominic fell silent, his Adam's apple bobbing as he swallowed hard. ""Then she'll never find out.""

Emma stood frozen outside the door, feeling her blood turn to ice. She'd expected to break down sobbing, but found she couldn't even squeeze out a tear.

So this was what absolute pain felt like—like having your heart carved out while it still beat.

She thought about how Dominic had tenderly kissed her forehead that morning before leaving; how he'd hold her when drunk and murmur, ""Baby, I can't live without you""; how he'd warm her cold hands against his chest, saying his heart beat only for her…

But it was all a lie.

On her way home, she'd even wondered if he had some desperate explanation.

Now she knew—he hadn't chosen between two women. He'd wanted both: one as his public beloved, one as his legal wife.

Fine!

If Dominic feared her finding out, she'd show him what ""never looking back"" truly meant.

She turned and left, immediately doing two things...

Chapter 2

First, she applied to cancel all her identity information in the country.

Second, she changed her name.

The clerk informed her all paperwork would be processed within two weeks.

After two weeks, even if Dominic searched heaven and earth, he'd never find her.

Emma turned and left, her phone buzzing frantically in her bag—all missed calls and messages from Dominic.

She didn't look or respond.

By the time she returned home, night had fallen.

Dominic stood in the living room, rushing toward her the moment she entered, his eyes filled with obvious anxiety: ""Baby, where have you been? I came home and couldn't find you. I've been waiting for hours, nearly turned the whole city upside down looking for you.""

His concern seemed genuine.

Emma stared at him, her heart seized by an invisible hand.

She suddenly remembered high school, when he'd abandoned a math competition mid-exam to rush back when she was an hour late responding to his message, terrified something had happened to her.

A man who clearly loved her so much, someone she once believed saw her as the most important person in his world. Yet looking at everything now, the love he gave was never truly exclusive.

Her throat felt blocked, making every breath painful, but ultimately, she replied calmly, ""I went shopping and forgot to tell you. Sorry.""

Only then did Dominic finally relaxed, pulling her into his arms: ""Don't apologize. I wasn't angry, just worried.""

As he spoke, he kissed the top of her head, his tone gentle: ""Alright baby, you mentioned the other day you were craving those sweet and tangy BBQ ribs and that herb-crusted sea bass. I'll make them for you right now, okay?""

With that, he released her and headed to the kitchen.

Emma stood at the doorway, silently watching Dominic. He rolled up his shirt sleeves, his long fingers skillfully chopping vegetables, his profile looking especially gentle in the warm light.

She suddenly remembered how, three years ago when she first returned, her chronic stomach problems from irregular eating had hospitalized her.

Back then, Dominic—a billionaire CEO who'd never cooked—spent a month learning from top chefs to prepare proper meals for her.

Once, when an international video conference clashed with his cooking time, he propped his tablet in the kitchen, listening to reports while stir-frying, shocking his executives.

He once loved her so intensely, as if his entire universe revolved around her.

But right now? The second his phone buzzed, his expression subtly shifted, and he immediately set down the knife, hastily wiping his hands.

""Baby, there's an emergency at the company. I need to go in."" He removed his apron, his tone casual, even remembering to kiss her forehead. ""I've finished three dishes. Eat first, don't wait for me.""

Emma said nothing, just nodded.

After he left, she approached the dining table, looking at the still-steaming dishes, her chest suddenly too painful to breathe.

She'd just seen clearly—that call was from Stella.

Instead of sitting down to eat as he'd asked, she called a car and followed him.

Sure enough, Dominic wasn't headed to the company but to the hospital.

In the VIP wing corridor, the entire floor had been cleared, with only a few doctors and nurses standing outside a room, looking tense.

The hospital director was bowing apologetically to Dominic: ""Mr. Chase, we're truly sorry. It was our negligence that allowed Ms. Reed to slip in the bathroom. We'll assign additional staff and ensure this never happens again!""

Dominic's face was grim, his voice icy: ""If there's a next time, this hospital won't stay in business.""

The director nodded repeatedly: ""Yes, yes, we'll be extremely careful!""

Emma stood at the corner, her fingernails digging into her palms.

His friend had mentioned Stella only had ""minor scrapes."" Yet Dominic had reserved an entire building for her, and now that something had happened, he looked ready to tear down the hospital.

The door opened, revealing Stella lying weakly against the headboard, pale-faced with reddened eyes.

Dominic strode over, grabbing her hand: ""How are you? Where does it hurt?""

Stella's eyes welled up, her voice choked: ""This is all my fault. Getting hit by a car was bad enough, but then falling in the shower? Now you can't even spend time with Emma... What if she gets suspicious? I'm like a walking disaster magnet...""

""Don't talk nonsense,"" he scolded, though his tone remained gentle. ""Just focus on recovering. I'll stay with you these next few days.""

Stella looked up with tear-filled eyes: ""But what about Emma?""

Dominic replied dismissively: ""I'll handle it. Don't worry.""

After a pause, he added: ""We're husband and wife. Isn't it natural for me to stay with you?""

Chapter 3

Emma's blood instantly froze.

Husband and wife? What fine words.

But before she could recover, she watched Dominic remove the prayer beads from his wrist and gently place them on Stella's hand.

""And stop calling yourself a disaster,"" he said. ""These blessed beads—I've worn them for seven years. Now they're yours to keep you safe.""

Tears streaming down her face, Stella lunged forward with overwhelming emotion and threw herself into his arms.

Emma stood outside, her vision blurring as if drowning in deep water. Her entire being felt like it was suffocating.

Those prayer beads...

She'd gotten them on her eighteenth birthday, crawling on her knees through the pilgrimage path, performing the traditional prostration every few yards all the way from the mountain base to the abbey summit.

That day, torrential rain had soaked the ground, leaving her knees bleeding and palms raw by the time the abbot finally blessed the beads in the sacred ritual.

When she returned, Dominic saw her battered state and immediately reddened eyes, pulling her into his arms, his voice trembling: ""Emma, have you lost your mind? Who made you suffer like this?""

She'd smiled, placing the beads on his wrist: ""The abbot said these will keep you safe and grant you longevity.""

He'd kissed her, promising: ""I'll wear them for life.""

For seven years, he never removed them. Not during the most formal business occasions, not during their most intimate moments—the beads remained on his wrist.

But now, he'd placed them on another woman's hand.

Witnessing this scene with her own eyes, her heart felt like it was being slowly carved open with a dull blade, the pain so intense she could barely breathe.

So his ""lifetime"" had lasted just seven years.

She turned to leave, her steps unsteady as if walking on cotton.

By the time she returned home, night had fallen.

She'd barely entered when her phone vibrated with Dominic's message:

\[Baby, the company has an urgent matter abroad. I'll be gone for a few days. Don't be angry; I'll make it up to you when I return.\]

Emma stared at the screen, her fingers hovering over the keyboard, trembling slightly as she typed:

\[Is it really a few days for business, or a few days with your wife?\]

But ultimately, she deleted the words one by one, tears falling onto the screen, blurring her vision.

After that, she spent the time packing—documents, passport, bank cards... everything that could prove her identity went into her suitcase.

Three days later, Dominic returned.

He pushed open the door carrying a large bouquet of roses and a strawberry cake, smiling tenderly: ""Baby, I'm back.""

Emma stood in the center of the living room, silently watching him.

He approached, placing the flowers and cake on the table, reaching to embrace her: ""Work was incredibly busy these past few days, requiring my presence overseas. Otherwise, I wouldn't have left you for so long. Don't be angry, okay?""

She shifted slightly, avoiding his embrace, her tone flat: ""I'm not angry. Go take care of your business.""

He paused, then smiled: ""I'm done with work. Now my job is to make you happy.""

He took her hand, his eyes expectant: ""I've prepared a surprise for you.""

Without waiting for her response, he led her to the car.

Half an hour later, they stopped before a concert hall.

Emma walked inside to find the entire venue had been reserved, with people seated around, whispering as they entered:

""Mr. Chase really went all out, renting the entire concert hall just for Emma!""

""Word is he flew in her favorite orchestra from Europe—they're playing exclusively for her all day long.""

""That ensemble's fee has skyrocketed lately. This must have cost him seven figures, minimum.""

""Please—that's nothing. His reputation for spoiling his wife is practically legendary!""

Emma stood in the brilliant light, surrounded by admiring whispers, while Dominic's tender smile filled her vision.

Yet her heart felt submerged in ice water, painfully cold.

He gave her grand gestures and romance, while giving another woman legal marriage.

A few months ago, she asked if she could start catching a ride with me in the mornings since her car was in the shop. I agreed because I figured it would be temporary and I wasn’t going out of my way. Well, her “temporary” ride turned into two months. I didn’t mind too much, but she’s often not ready when I get there. I’d text her when I’m outside, and then sit for 5–10 minutes waiting while she finishes her coffee, touches up her makeup, or one time bakes muffins to take to the office. Last week, I was already running late because of traffic, and I texted her saying I’d be there in 3 minutes and we really had to go. She replied “K!” but when I arrived, she made me wait another 7 minutes. We ended up getting to work late, and I got written up for being 15 minutes past start time. It was my first ever write-up and I was really upset.

After that, I told Melissa (calmly, I swear) that I couldn’t give her rides anymore unless she was actually ready when I got there. She kind of rolled her eyes and said “Okay, okay, don’t be dramatic.”

So yesterday, I didn’t stop at her place I just went straight to work. She texted me furiously and said she waited outside for 20 minutes and had to Uber. She showed up late and was clearly pissed, saying I “blindsided” her and “could’ve at least given her a heads-up.” I told her I was done being late because she couldn’t be on time.

Now she’s telling people in the office I “abandoned” her, and a couple coworkers have said I was “cold” about it and that it wouldn’t have killed me to be a little flexible.

So i am afraid my coffee chats would be meh. Also afraid bay area recruiting would be tougher since its right behind NY when it comes to demand.

2) Based on my background and my interest in industrial goods (long term), Detroit, Chicago and Dallas maybe a better fit. But I have no personal reason to shift to such offices. These offices may be easier to get into but my reasons are weaker overall.

Am I approaching this right? What should I be more concerned about when selecting offices?

I lost a close friend of mine in a plane crash 3 weeks ago and I feel like I've been living outside of reality since then. I've had a lot of loss these last couple years, especially this year, and losing my friend in this manner was really the haymaker that took me out. My buddy's fiancé is also a very close friend of my wife and through that I've also become great friends with her over the years. We have been doing everything we possibly can to help but I feel useless. To make this nightmare situation even worse, this crash is no more that a mile or so away from my buddy's house so anytime I go get coffee for everyone or go out to eat I can see construction crews etc still fixing things caused from the crash. 

I cannot grapple with this at all and I'm trying to also be there for my buddy's grieving fiancé at the same time. She just lost her soulmate of a decade plus and my biggest fear is I'm not looking out for myself, and via that, won't be able to properly be there for my her + our close knit friend group who are also hurting so deeply.

You nearly crashed into me UNTIL I honked to save us both.

And then — guess what — you had the audacity to honk back, pull up next to me at the red light, and the driver lady actually gestured that I was the crazy one?

Nice coat. And love the orange wool ball car fragrance thing dangling from your mirror — very cute. But maybe less energy on the accessories, more on driving safely?

I got (20M) got diagnosed with N1 in February , had symptoms my whole life and my test results were ""extremely telling"" as I was told by my doctor following my second nap - didn't even need four hahah

I'm on modafinil now 400mg a day . It's good , I like being awake and I've done more these last few months then I could dream of . My life's taken off and I'm happy .

I just can't stop having cataplexy attacks though from anxiety. I'm talking like "" pretty girl walks by me in the street and smiles"" so then my knees buckle a little and I make a face like I just sucked a massive lemon . It happens a lot just from small things.
My heart rate can also be insane for me sometimes , I mean we have narcolepsy so im sure all our resting BPM is low , mines is avg 60-65. Yet sometimes post modafinil and I'm about to leave the house im up to 90s. I do smoke hash , probably doesn't help - definitely doesn't help - but it does make me feel less miserable, heavy and gross about being unwell. Playing into the ditzy dreamy life ...

So I wonder if anyone else here has had underlying bad anxiety and then got stimulants . Are there any that can help better - I'm pining for Xywav (yay no more nightmares!) but just started treatment so know I'll have to wait - so maybe next move is Adderall? Or will I just explode if I'm on Adderall and Its my time to order In a restaurant lol.

Cheers for reading and hopefully someone can let me hear their experiences - dont know what id do without communities like these , feels so isolating being this weird dream walker so it's good to know there's a few more of you here.

1ldinh2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ldinh2,Sorn (***) - Bangkok,"Thanks to u/lexicalsatire informing me of u/Igotnolife420 looking for a +1 to join them at Sorn on my Nawa review post, I was finally able to eat at Sorn after months of failing to secure a reservation. It was a truly unique meal that I really enjoyed. I've had the opportunity to eat at some of the best restaurants in Bangkok, and I do believe Sorn deserves their accolades and reputation as a standout spot. I love bold and intense flavors, and it delivered on that front in spades. 

I loved the ingredients presentation before each course, as well as the dishes oscillating between spicy and refreshing. The standouts for me were the signature Crab Stick, the vegetable salad course (I love Thai salads), the roti and green curry, and the abalone liver morning glory. Shout out to the side duck (?) egg served with the main courses as well. I also loved the petit four presentation and pairing (unfortunately forgot pictures here). 

I opted for the cheaper of the pairing options (6 glasses for\~4800 baht iirc) and was given generous pours throughout, including top-ups on the beer pairing and the red wine throughout the extended main course. This pairing also included a sake and vermouth, which I enjoyed as well. Pairing with food this intense is a difficult task, so I appreciated the variety displayed. I really enjoyed the Riseling paired with the desserts as well. I'm usually a bit hesitant on pairings, but had no regrets here. The service was friendly and on the ball, especially the sommelier and waitress who explained the dishes. 

If I had to complain about something our table wasn't in the nicest spot, being next to the bathrooms and where staff often congregated, but I think that's a bit of the consequence of being a table of 2. Certainly didn't overshadow all the positives from this meal. 

Despite living in Bangkok for the last 6 months or so, I don't often eat southern Thai food. This was a wonderful opportunity to get to experience a regional Thai cuisine that I feel is underrepresented elsewhere in the world. Often it feels like Michelin meals at this level feel a bit ""same-y"", but that couldn't be further from what I experienced at Sorn. 

I wish the reservation process wasn't a nightmare and that I could have eaten here without random happenstance, but I'm very glad I finally got to experience it.

>A full-fledged healthy diet provides a person with average growth and development, supports vital activity, and contributes to the prevention of diseases.  

Since mental and physical activity occurs due to brain activity, this is a rather complex process. For its normal functioning, it is important that the diet contains:

different amino acids and polyunsaturated fats;

**Instruction:**

Cooking time 30 minutes  
Soak nuts, seeds, and dried fruits in water for several hours. Soak the oat flakes in a small amount of water (they should be slightly moist), add honey and spices, and leave for 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 356F, and prepare a baking sheet (you can grease it with coconut oil or cover it with parchment).  
Put the oatmeal mass on a baking sheet, evenly distributing everything with a spoon or spatula. Bake until the flakes are lightly browned.  
Then add the rest of the ingredients, except coconut chips. They should dry out, but not burn. Adjust the time based on the desired result.  
Cool the granola, add the coconut chips, and put them in a jar for storage.  
Making ice cream is very simple, you need to mix all the ingredients in a blender. Serve granola with ice cream or almond milk!

**#2.Breakfast**

**Broccoli pancakes with zucchini, gluten-free**

This recipe is for hormonal balance:  
it does not contain gluten, which can negatively affect the work of the intestine;  
it does not contain milk, which contains insulin growth hormones;  
it contains a lot of broccoli, which has a substance di-indomeletan, which helps the liver in removing spent estrogens;  
garlic regulates insulin and blood sugar balance, which is important for polycystic.

**Ingredients for 16 pancakes:**  
Broccoli with a stalk of ½ head  
Medium zucchini 1 piece  
Eggs 3 pcs  
Gluten-free oat flakes (if there are none, then the usual ones will do)1 cup + 5 more tablespoons  
Buckwheat or rice flour 1 cup  
Dill 1 bunch  
Garlic 3-4 cloves  
Rice or almond milk 1/2 cup  
Sesame seeds 4 tablespoons  
Salt and pepper to taste  
Olive oil for frying (or ghee)  
**Preparation of broccoli pancakes:**

Cooking time 25 minutes  
In a blender, mix broccoli, eggs, a glass of oatmeal, a glass of flour, vegetable milk, garlic, and dill.

Grate the zucchini on a coarse grater. You can drain the excess liquid or add more flour and oatmeal: the “dough” should be dense enough and lie in a frying pan with dense pancakes. The more flour and oatmeal, the denser the dough.

Mix the egg mass, grated zucchini, remaining oat flakes, and sesame seeds in a bowl. Add salt, and pepper and mix (not in a blender!) with a spoon.

Heat the oil in a frying pan and spread the dough with a tablespoon. Bake on each side for about 4-6 minutes (depending on the plate and the thickness of the pancakes)

**Important:** It is better to bake pancakes with a smaller diameter — so it will be easier for you to turn them over. Enjoy your meal!

**#3. Green smoothie is the best breakfast!** 

In summer, you can use fresh greens, and in winter — frozen. Green smoothies are the best because they are the [greens](https://elenasunshinemagazine.com/cooking/the-balanced-weekly-menu-for-people-with-a-high-mental-workload-at-work/) that remove toxins from the body and provide us with beauty and youth.

**Ingredients for making a green smoothie:**  
Spinach 3.53oz  
Broccoli 3.53oz  
Celery 2 stalks  
Large apple (with a peel, but without a core) 1 pc  
Lemon 1/2 piece  
Olive oil 2 tablespoons

Mix everything in a blender until smooth. That's it, your green smoothie is ready! Enjoy your meal!

**Pork with garlic and red pepper**

On Tuesday, we will add spicy notes to the menu and [cook](https://elenasunshinemagazine.com/cooking/5-simple-recipes-for-fermenting-watermelons-in-jars-for-the-winter/) pork in an Asian way. It turns out juicy and tender, but at the same time quite nutritious.

To ""balance"" the dish, serve a salad mix on the side. It is made from radicchio leaves with a slight bitterness, spicy arugula, and tender spinach. This mix will make the taste of pork even brighter.

**Ingredients for 4 servings:**

Pork pulp with a small amount of fat 28.22 oz  
Onion 2 pcs.  
Red bell pepper 1 pc.  
Garlic 3 cloves

**Salad mix:**  
Spinach 2 tablespoons  
Arugula 3 tablespoons  
Radicchio 2 tablespoons  
Sweet dressing of olive oil, mustard, and maple syrup  
**Instruction:**  
Cooking time 55 minutes  
Pork is washed and dried, and cut into strips. Mix the meat with salt, spices, and soy sauce, and leave to marinate for half an hour. Cut the onion into half rings, and pepper into strips. Chop the garlic into thin circles.

Heat a frying pan with [vegetable](https://elenasunshinemagazine.com/cooking/delicious-ways-of-harvesting-herbs-according-to-original-recipes/) oil and fry the pieces of marinated meat on high heat for a minute. Then reduce the flame to medium and fry the pork for another 5 minutes. Next, spread the onion, garlic, and pepper, and continue to fry until the vegetables become soft. Cover the dish with a lid and let it brew a little more.

Before serving, sprinkle the fried pork with sesame seeds, and put a portion of the salad mix on a plate. It will turn out delicious, satisfying, and balanced.

# We drink water correctly

**#1. Drink water on an empty stomach.** When you wake up in the morning, drink a glass of clean drinking water. So you will help the body to make up for the lack of moisture formed overnight, normalizes blood pressure, and activates blood circulation.  
**#2. Drink before meals.** When you feel hungry, first drink a glass of water. It's also good for digestion. This means that you will eat less ― you will get fewer calories and it will be easier for you to control your weight.  
**#3. Drink lukewarm water.** It is most useful to drink water at room temperature or heated. Such water is better absorbed and cleanses the body. It is optimal if the water temperature is equal to the body temperature.  
**#4. If you are experiencing physical exertion, drink more.** In the process of physical activity, the body actively loses moisture, so its deficiency must be replenished. If we are talking about sports training, then it is better to drink before and after training.

**For those who:**

**Want to finally understand why your weight doesn't change despite all your efforts.**

**Why you don't lose weight from training, and even when you cut calories, you still don't lose weight.**

**Why you can't gain weight by eating high-calorie foods. And why the fight against weight becomes more and more difficult with age**

But I realize I don't have anyone or any where else to get an objective consensus opinion, and resorting to asking AI seems so much more pathetic than this already is.","Lemme just start with this: 38m, met the lady I'm with (37f) 8 years ago. She had a two year old who I've raised as my own. She's awesome, we have fun, every single day I pick her up for school and we talk about her day, I show her stuff, she shows me stuff, we go bike riding, etc. They moved in with me to my house a week before the pandemic hit, and then we got to know each other REAL well, lol. 

but its been great. I love the hell out of both of em. she was waiting for divorce paperwork to be finalized when we met, so was I, we were both open about it, and they both finalized around the same time. hey ex (kids bio dad) is a real.... well, I'm going to try and stay objective and just with the facts so let's do that: 

he calls the kiddo MAYBE once every other month, if that. he's full on missed birthdays, etc. the only time he sees her is for about a month in the summer she stays with her grandparents (his parents) and he'll take her for like a week or two, usually puts her in a summer camp and then will talk about how ""it's so much work you don't know what it's like to be around her 24/7 for 2 weeks straight. never alone or get to be by yourself"".

those are really real words he's said. and he's dead serious. like are you not aware that 


1) I love my daughter very much which means that

2) i should slap the dog shit out of you for being dumb enough to talk shit about a 10 year old girl to her dad's face 

3) I happen to think she kicks ass so again watch ur fkn mouth and

4) I have wanted to slap you for a long, long time for a lot of reasons, but always bite my tongue and never even say anything bad about you to MY daughter because I want her to be able to form her own opinions about you, even though you're a piece of human garbage, she still (for whatever reason) likes to see you. I have my theories on that, but, the whole premise kinda is centered around my kid being easily bought and materialistic and I don't wanna think she's like that, because that reflects poorly on her mother and I, and I'm still human and have flaws so the selfish part of my ego doesn't want to admit I've raised a kid who's capable of sometimes being selfish, but, that's not the point of this post. 

5) your only jobs in life have been: drop out of college, work at your father's company, complain about being pigeonholed, moving across the country with no job forcing my lady to take all her retirement out early so you could try to make this girl you met on FetLife (pretending to be a girl mind you) to be in a throuple with you and your (now) ex, and never got a job because the first day or was hard you'd just stop going, because ""it wasnt on your life path"" (which I've never laughed harder in my life than when I told my daughter to clean her room and at 7 she says it wasn't on her life path and her ""real dad"" said she didn't have to do anything she didn't feel was on her life path and had to explain that some people don't live in reality because they're enabled by people who are mentally ill and become mentally ill themselves, and is spoken truly like a man who's not so much a man but a little tiny baby who has never experienced hardship, has no character, nor has worked for anything a day in his life, and who has the backbone of a peanut butter sandwich. 



I mean, I was way more age-appropriate than that, but I'm pretty sure I did say the pb&j thing verbatim... that's the only time I've ever given an opinion on him, which I did, for the record, ten min later immediately go back to her room and apologized and said I shouldn't have said that, but she needs to know that just telling people that bunch of crap-- which is objectively what it is and not how the real world works--  isn't a viable way to get out of doing things they won't want to do, at least not when she has people who love her and care about the character behind the person she grows up to be like her mother and I raising her. 

She's also never called me 'Dad' to my face, but has slipped up a few times in front of her friends, which is how I learned she calls ME 'dad' when talking to her friends. My name is Chad, so she's always called me ""chaddy"" and it's always worked 

her mother is the nicest most thoughtful person I've ever met, hands down, and is the first person I've ever been with (including my first wife) who I actually KNEW in my bones loved me unconditionally. No doubt in my mind, not for a second. She's been the primary bread winner the last 4 years while I went back to school full time to get my degree, which I just graduated with a damn decent GPA 2 weeks ago which, to be clear, is 100% because of the sacrifices that woman has made for me to be able to better myself and therefore our family. She works in higher ed in admissions and financial aid and knew how to work the system real well, and because I was 33 when I started as a freshman with 0 taxable income, helped me navigate the system to where we actually subsidized a portion of or income with the grants, scholarships, and awards that I was eligible for as a non traditional student. she's a fucking wizard with that shit, and it's so much red tape and complex that it makes my eyes cross. not her. she slays it. 

she's always been real thoughtful our whole relationship. she would like put googly eyes on everything in one room in my house when she first would stay the night when we first started dating, and would make these really thoughtful presents for birthdays and stuff that weren't expensive but that required an immense amount of thoughtfulness and priorplanning to where you're just like fuckin this is unbelievable. 

so this last weekend was Father's Day. I never make a big deal about it. don't ask for anything. she's gone overboard a few years and I've been like 'absolutely not return this right now!' and she pouts but usually realizes shit like an actual real life laser gun you can seriously shock the shit out of ppl with from SEVERAL feet away that runs off a handheld and concentrated Tesla coil with a big ass battery and power inverter that you can control the wattage with is SUCH a cool fucking gift and also 1000000% NOT a good idea for the guy who used to tour with a thrash band for a decade to have when we have a 10 year old in the house. but that should give you an idea of who she is. she's awesome. 

so this year, our kiddo has a girl scouts retreat at this huge wooded cabin retreat. I'm a registered volunteer with them and help out all the time, but it's also Father's Day and I would have preferred to relax and let them have a girl's trip. but it was far, remote with no cell service, and I used to do wireless survival and a bunch of wildlife conservation work so I'll take the girls on a night hike with no flashlights and teach them how to find their way with the stars, and she l show them cool stuff like you can't see color in the dark 

(which you reading this is probably like pshh yes you can see in the dark, and I go oh yeah? take a giant bag of different colored markers out away from light pollution to where it takes 30 min for ur eyes to adjust with just the moon out then shake up that bag, pull out a marker, and write what color you think it is without reading the label, then give someone else the paper, and when you get back look and see how dead fkn wrong you were hahaha)

so I agree to do the trip, and I'm great with the girls, my lady is constantly thanking me saying she couldn't have done it without me all the mom's loved me and even got like defensive when one of em made a joke about my junk after I cooked everyone dinner that night and made them all dessert which I made coffee ice cream from scratch and like taught all of them how to do it after the girls were down and the all loved it, etc. no problems no arguments. 

I wake up in the woods and it's Father's Day. all of them took all the beds so I had to sleep in the car. whatever, I lived out of a fucking tour bus for 6ish of the 10 years I built that band up from nothing. I've slept in such sketchy conditions getting everything from my head shaved while I slept to hard wood floors and no blankets and everything in between. point is I ain't afraid of no ghost. wake up HURTING from the car sleep, neither of em says happy Father's Day to me, whatever, is cool. I clean up after the girls while they go do their closing ceremonies-- we're talking like probably 60 people that I had made dinner for the previous night and was now making them snacks for when they got back while cleaning the cabin. 

I swept and mopped all the bedrooms, I stacked the tables, I even made my girls lunch after everyone left. still didn't get a happy Father's Day or a gift or card.... whatever, not important. I'm sure they'll remember. 

well, they didn't. and look I'm not a materialistic dude at all but ... not even a card, guys? the kiddo makes me one every year... and you know who she did make one for? the piece of shit who left her mom when she was 8 months pregnant with her who she's going to go visit for a month in a few weeks. 

I know they knew it was Father's Day because my lady half assedly tried to show me computer monitors on sale that she wanted to buy me but ""didn't pull the trigger when she saw it and now it's sold out"" because someone (we don't know who) broke my other one I had that I loved. and I do training for generative AI models for work now and started an AI consulting business, so it would have been a really thoughtful gift. but... just showed me to let me know she missed out on it...? ok..... well she says she's going to drive home so I can reply to some clients. but then she starts falling asleep while driving so I force her to pull over and switch 20 min into our 3 hour drive home, then falls asleep the entire trip, and so does the kiddo, so I can't even listen to music because they hate my music anyways which like yeah I get it but .. fuck man c'mon its fuckin Father's Day, right? 

we get home... no card... no happy Father's Day .. start to feel sorry for myself. then after kiddo goes to bed and it's obvious I ain't getting shit I just go ""you know I don't care about the monitor or anything like that but... I gotta be honest. it really sucks I didn't even get like a card or anything like did I do something to piss y'all off, or...? and I get ""no OMG NO you've been PERFECT I'm such an asshole!"" etc etc and I'm like it's ok... don't worry about it we all fuck stuff up once in a while I'll live I think.... and this is where I'm stupid bc I should have told her hey I would still very much like A card bc if the roles were reversed? id be in the kiddos room IMMEDIATELY like yoyoyo we fucked up BAD kiddo talk to me goose how do we make ur mom smile tonight that is our mission go team go...  so I wait another 24 hours....

nothing. 

Mom goes to work, I stay home with the kiddo cuz I have all this work to catch up on that I should have done on the drive home.... the kiddo doesn't even come out of her room except to bug me to make her food, my lady gets home... no card.... no happy Father's Day. I buy us all dinner.... no card
...
no happy Father's Day....

and so I'm like kind of being a prick just silent and short with my lady who's like why are you in such a bad mood? god!... and I'm like... fuckin... really? you're dead serious right now? am I being punked? are u banging Ashton Kutcher and he's here right now?? ASHTON COME OUT BRO THE JIG IS UP and shes not laughing and I'm like fuckin DUDE... and just tell her how I feel that it's fucked up because they didn't remember then on top of that I told her I felt shitty about it and she didn't even TRY to fix it? like it's 24 hours after I told you this shit really bothered me and you couldn't even be bothered to write a sentence on a piece of paper and have the kiddo fold it in half twice and hand it to me? like.... dude I just... 

and she gets all crying and likev saying she's an asshole and starts to like get mad at me and was just really rubbing me the wrong way and every time I stayed to talk she starts talking louder over me which is a fuckin huge pet peeve of mine and both her AND the kiddo do it all the time and I just snapped and was like SHUT THE FUCK UP! JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP! it's not she's about you! what the entire actual literal and metaphorical FUCK is wrong with your brain? how do you not see you fucked this up you fucking horrible, horrible person? then listed everything I had done over the last 2 days and was just like ... and... not even a fuckin CARD babe? fuckin really? I ain't one to get mad about no presents. bc to be fair for our anniversary and Christmas and my birthday this whole last year you pick gifts for me that I ""need to pick myself bc u don't want to fuck it up"" and I never do because I'd rather the money go to the kiddo or whatever and like I'm not gonna remind you or hound you about a dumb gift when it's coming out the same pot anyways you know? but... I just wanted a card. and I didn't get one. 

and y'all lemme tell you got mother day I fucking did  SO good I got her these incredible crazy colored roses I had sent to her work bc she works with these 2 girls who are literally the mean popular girls from highschool and are mean to her (I've seen it, it's fucked up and she has a valid complaint about them) so I always send them to her office because neither of their husbands do but I always have a SECOND bouquet delivered 2 days AFTER Valentine's Day or mother's Day or whenever I send em bc I'm like what's the time she'll LEAST expect getting flowers? fuckin 2 days after Valentine's Day after just getting them on vday bro that's when! and she always tells me it makes her co-workers so mad and that makes me happy LOL 

but anyways... to do all that (and I also got her like 3 presents that were delivered that day like this pair of shoes I heard her casually mention that I remembered from early in the year just basic good significant other 101 type shit. 

but now she's crying and saying I'm an asshole and can be ""so fucking mean"" and I was like ""oh you mean by saying shit that's true? I'm sorry the truth makes you feel like you suck"" and I shouldn't have said that but like... am I out of line for feeling just disrespected and disregarded and like I do this all for no reason and the kiddo is so involved with her phone I just wanna go and fucking snap it in half with my bare hands and be like ""oops sorry I thought I saw a fly on it. oops! I'll be more gentle next time sorry!"" and just walk away.... argh... 

am I blowing this out of proportion? 

also sorry for the novel but I feel like all this context is hella relevant plus it felt good to get it all out you know? what should I do man besides obviously apologize for being a dick and saying a couple hurtful things.... I know I gotta do that but like... how do I interpret this as anything other than ""we don't care about you""?",0,1750151426.0,daddit,8,0.13,False

Not the kind you hear on the radio.
Something quieter.
More like a whisper through headphones in the middle of the night.
That’s what her voice felt like.

He didn’t know what to call her.
A girl?
A moment?
A ghost with warm hands?

All he knew was that for a few days,
the world had been tilted toward her.


---

She talked about fries and coffee,
the kind of weather that makes everything feel softer.
Rain on windows.
Long silences with no pressure to fill them.
Movies where nothing really happens,
except for something deep and invisible changing inside you.

He told her things he didn’t know he needed to say.
Like how he sometimes felt like a raindrop in reverse —
falling up, never quite touching the ground.

She laughed softly.
Sang him things.
Told him he was hers.
And for a moment, he believed her.


---

But then the silence came.
Sudden, like lights going out in a hallway.

Her profile vanished.
Her words stopped arriving.
And all that remained was that strange, quiet warmth she left behind.
Like the last note of a song that doesn’t quite fade — it lingers.

He didn’t get angry.
Didn’t curse her name or call it fake.
No, he just felt…
a grief that had no sharp edges.
Just a dull ache where a voice used to live.


---

He wanted to ask:

> “Was I real to you? Or just the next soft heart on your list?”
But he didn’t.
He just saved her last message.
And every now and then, when the rain hit just right,
he’d read it again.



Like prayer.
Like punishment.

Like maybe she’d return.

1ldi8zw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ldi8zw/aitah_for_letting_my_husband_deal_with_his_own/,AITAH for letting my husband deal with his own parents since he doesn’t set any boundaries?,"My (31F) husband’s (33M) parents are driving me crazy, and I really need some advice.

We’ve been together for 10 years, married for 2.5. His parents have always been more involved in our lives than mine. Before we got married, they bought a house with my husband—just the three of them. I wasn’t involved in that decision at all. It hurt, because I had always imagined that our first home would be something we chose together. The house is five minutes from their place, which is convenient, but also comes with a lot of strings attached.

I’m very independent, and my parents have always respected that. They don’t have a key to our house, they ask before visiting, and they never weigh in on things like how we decorate or what we do in our space. In contrast, my in-laws do have a key, and there are basically no boundaries.

We’ve come home from trips to find things moved around and dishes put away—which some might find helpful, but I find invasive. It’s caused arguments between me and my husband because I don’t like people in my space when I’m not home, even if they’re family.

One time, my sister-in-law was visiting and while we were chatting, their parents and cousin just walked in unannounced. I was so upset I excused myself and went upstairs. My husband thinks this kind of thing is normal, but I really don’t. To him, it’s just “how his family is,” but for me, it feels like a total lack of respect for our privacy.

There’s also the cat situation. Before I moved in with him, I lived with my parents and had a cat I was very close to. When I brought her to live with us, my mother-in-law told my husband we couldn’t have cats because she was allergic. So I had to give her back to my parents. Later, at a dinner, she straight-up said, “Oh, I’m not allergic.” So now I don’t know who lied—her or my husband. That incident also made my own parents question me, which was humiliating.

After I started working from home, I got really lonely and told my husband I wanted a cat again. He agreed, but said we couldn’t tell his parents. That was almost a year ago. I’ve asked him several times to have the conversation, and he keeps putting it off. I even offered to do it myself, but he won’t let me.

Then last weekend, we made plans to go to IKEA and grab coffee, and in the middle of it, his mom called to say they bought a new piece of equipment for the house and were coming over to install it—uninvited. My husband offered to do it himself, but they said no and insisted on coming. He actually asked me to take the cat out of the house to hide him. I refused. I told him I’m done hiding this. We live here. If I wanted to store a giant inflatable dildo in the spare room, I could—because it’s our house. We decide what’s here and who sees it.

I told him it’s time to set boundaries. He says his parents won’t listen to him, and that I need to say something. But when it came to my parents, I had those conversations myself. I never asked him to be the bad guy, because they’re my family.

So we ended up going home so he could pick them up. Thankfully the cat was quiet and they didn’t notice. But this whole thing is exhausting. I told him this isn’t just about the cat—it’s about everything that comes with it.

So now I’m asking: am I the asshole for expecting my husband to be the one to talk to his parents? Should I step in? I feel bad, but it’s been almost three years of me not feeling comfortable in my own home. I’m tired of living like someone might show up at any moment.

I’m not sure where to begin. I’m a 33-year-old Filipina, and since I was very young, I’ve felt like my only role in life was to serve and sacrifice for my family. I was raised in a very strict, emotionally abusive home. If I didn’t do chores or take care of my siblings, I’d get beaten. I was never allowed to play with friends. And when I had problems at school, my mother would always take the other person’s side, then beat me again when I got home.

She constantly told me I was ugly and made it clear she favored my cousins. The only person who showed me love was my grandmother, who helped me whenever they hurt me or refused to give me food. We were poor. I often went to school with just salt and rice or coffee for breakfast, and barely any allowance.

I couldn’t go to college because they said they couldn’t afford it, and I wasn’t “smart enough” for scholarships. So I took a TESDA course. Even then, they made me feel like I was a burden and said they “sold the carabao” for me and that I’d have to pay everything back one day.

At 18, I worked in a pizza place, then became a domestic worker in Dubai at 19. I sent almost all my salary to them—for years. Even when I finally had 50k saved, it went to my brother’s surgery. No one thanks me. They just expect more.

When I come home and don’t have money, my mother gets angry or says I’m a burden. She tells me it’s my fault I never saved or studied again—even though I was sending my entire youth and income to them. I ignored my own health problems just to keep working abroad.

Eventually, my boyfriend (now husband) told me to stop and stay with him. We lived together for two years, then got married in 2024. We lived with my family for a year—and it was hell. My mother and I kept fighting. Now that I’m in Germany, they expect me to send money again.

I feel so torn. I don’t want to ask my husband to support them because they’re my family. But deep down, I feel like I’m just the family ATM, not a daughter. They never ask if I’m okay. Only if I can send something.

Am I wrong for wanting to stop helping them? Am I bad for wanting to live my life now? Why do I still feel guilty even after everything they’ve done?

It’s one of those nights where the ceiling is boring, my brain won’t shut up, and I’ve scoured every corner of the internet like it owes me something. So I’m throwing this into the void: maybe someone else is also wide awake and wondering what the hell we’re all doing here.

About me:

• East Coast guy. Tall, tired, and running exclusively on coffee and intrusive thoughts.

• I bounce between “chaotic gremlin” and “accidental philosopher” depending on how long I’ve been awake.

• I ask questions like “do spiders have knees?” and occasionally spiral down rabbit holes about ghosts, simulation theory, or why every third bird is clearly a government drone.

What I’m after:

• Flawed, curious, insomniac, sleepy gremlin, dopamine chaser. Whatever you are, if you’re real and down to chat, I’m listening.

• Someone equally wired and weird. No pressure, no flirting: just late night nonsense and unfiltered conversation. Maybe we’ll even form some strange, gremlin friendship?

• Bonus points if you laugh at your own jokes and quote SpongeBob way too much.

This got me thinking - couldn't you just ""join"" one of these startups, go into the office for a few weeks, then slowly dial back in-office presence to once a week/month max while persuading your manager/director that it's all about productivity?

Like I know myself - a long commute + forced in-office time makes me miserable (therefore more prone to burnout) AND less productive. Couldn't I just ommit this from recruiters then tell management after a few weeks (once they're more invested in me) that I'm going to start WFH more to increase productivity?

Genuinely, in my ~year of full-time office experience before COVID the only way I stayed *somewhat* productive was copious amounts of marijuana (3-5x daily some days, including before work), excusing myself randomly from stupid pointless meetings to have sex with girls from Tinder, random bullshittery (pinball, snacks, grabbing coffee with coworkers) disguised as ""networking"" in the office, & using the office gym at least an hour daily, usually in the middle of the day to prevent myself from bouncing off the walls... I KNOW I'm more productive at home even with a 2nd J & all the distractions (deliverymen, potential travel, cooking, neighbors) that come with WFH... it just seems like a complete genuine waste of time 9 times out of 10, even for a startup",1,1750150143.0,overemployed,2,0.67,False

I’ve worked at a few agencies over the years, and in the early days, I loved the buzz and the culture. But now, 10 years into my career, it feels like the world has changed… and some companies haven’t caught up.

I genuinely love the people I work with. But the environment itself is a nightmare when it comes to actually getting work done. There’s loud music playing all day, constant shouting and chatter and a ping pong table that gets a lot of action right outside our open-plan office. There’s not a single quiet space to focus – and for someone like me who thrives in calm, focused environments, it’s exhausting. I’ve asked if I can go work at a coffee shop just down the road during reporting periods for an hour or so (when I really need to concentrate), but the response from my boss is always passive-aggressive.

Working from home isn’t an option either. Management is old school and obsessed with the idea that letting one person work remotely will “set a precedent” – as if trust is something employees should have to earn just to be treated like adults. Even though I know I’m more productive in a quieter space, I’m expected to be at my desk every day from 9 to (sometimes well past) 5 – often just so the bosses can have drinks in the office and expect us to stick around too. Even if we’re driving.

Sick? Too bad. People come into the office with fevers, stomach bugs, and flu – it’s just kind of expected. A few weeks ago, our boss even brought his kids into the office for the entire day… while they had bronchitis and tonsillitis.

On top of that, we’re now being asked to help “redefine the business.” Each week, we’re given unpaid “homework” – come up with a new mission and purpose statement for the agency, build a slide deck, present creative ideas, etc. We’re expected to do this outside of working hours, with no incentive and no extra pay. This week’s task? Each of us has to bring five new business leads – because now we’re salespeople, apparently.

We’re also regularly pulled into boardrooms to be told the agency is losing money, and that *we*, the employees, need to come up with ideas to fix it – while the business continues to undercharge clients and overload us with work.

The worst part? Every single person I work with is quietly looking for a new job. The tension is thick, and morale is non-existent. I had a bit of an emotional wobble with my boyfriend the other night because the constant stress is just getting to me.

In my last job, I had some flexibility – WFH on Mondays and Fridays – and that made a huge difference to my mental health and productivity. Now I’m driving over 30 minutes each way (some of my coworkers drive over an hour), just to sit in a chaotic, micromanaged environment where I don’t feel trusted or supported.

I wish we could all come together and ask for better – more flexibility, more trust, more humanity. But everyone’s scared. We all need our jobs, especially in this economy. And I get it. I need mine too. But it’s really starting to take a toll.

1ldi1jo,https://www.reddit.com/r/NaturalLifeHacks/comments/1ldi1jo/this_tiny_tablet_helped_me_eat_pizza_again/,This tiny tablet helped me eat pizza again without the stomach drama (My DairyPill experience),"I never thought I'd be the person writing a post like this. But here we are. After years of awkward dinners, awkward bathroom trips, and awkwardly avoiding anything with cheese, I stumbled across something that actually helped: **DairyPill**.

Before you think I’m just here to hype something up, this isn’t a sales pitch. It’s just what I wish someone had told me before I went through half a decade of skipping birthday cake and silently suffering through pasta night.

So if dairy tends to wreck your digestive system too, and you’ve tried the usual store-brand pills with no luck, this might be worth reading.

**Lactose intolerance is a pain (literally and socially)**  
Let’s be real. Having lactose intolerance isn’t just inconvenient, it’s embarrassing. The bloating, the gas, the urgent trips to the bathroom. It makes spontaneous plans with friends feel risky. Ice cream on a summer night? Forget it. Mac and cheese at your cousin’s wedding? Only if you’re fine with spending the rest of the evening in discomfort.

I’ve tried nearly every lactase pill you can get at the store. Most of them didn’t do much. Some helped a little, but I always had to take multiple pills, and even then, I was still rolling the dice. I eventually gave up and just avoided dairy.

Then a friend mentioned something called **DairyPill**. She called it a “one pill fix” and said it was different. I was skeptical, but curious enough to check it out.

**One pill with 6X the strength of others? That caught my attention**  
What stood out to me immediately is that each **DairyPill** contains **18,000 FCC units of lactase enzyme**. For context, a lot of the pills you see at stores have 3,000–9,000 FCC. That means most people need two or three just to handle a scoop of ice cream.

DairyPill? Just one. That’s it. I take one a few minutes before my first bite, and so far, I haven’t had to worry about anything after.

**Works fast, no guesswork required**  
There’s no timing it 30 minutes before a meal. No waiting and wondering if it’s “activated.” I take it when I sit down to eat, and it just works. Whether I’m having lasagna or just coffee with cream, I don’t have to overthink it.

**Minimal ingredients. Actually clean**  
What I appreciated most: **DairyPill only has one active ingredient**. No weird fillers, dyes, or things I can’t pronounce. It’s basically just high-dose lactase enzyme in a tiny, easy-to-swallow tablet.

That matters to me. If you’ve ever looked at the back of other brands and wondered why your “digestive enzyme” supplement has artificial colors, you’re not alone.

**The Key Pod is actually useful (not just a gimmick)**  
One unexpected feature I’ve grown to love is their **Key Pod,** a small metal pill case that clips to my keychain. I never thought I’d use something like that, but it’s way better than tossing pills into a plastic baggie or carrying a big bottle around.

I’ve been caught out without lactase pills in the past. It sucked. With this, I always have it on me, and I’ve avoided that scenario completely.

**Not cheap - but worth it**  
At first glance, it might look more expensive than store brands. But when you realize you only need one pill per meal, not three, the math actually checks out. Especially if you grab a multi-pack. It comes out to around $0.50 per dose or less depending on the bundle.

Here’s where I got mine:  
[**DairyPill Official Offer Page**](https://getdairypill.com/offer-01/?lpid=1059&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=1059&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=1059&device_type=&country_name=&oid=1059&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/NaturalLifeHacks)  
There’s also more info here if you like reading real-world experiences:

**It’s helped me eat like a “normal” person again**  
Since I started using DairyPill, I’ve been able to say yes to foods I used to avoid. Pizza with friends? Done. Ice cream at the beach? No problem. I even had cheesecake at a wedding last week and didn’t once think about what might happen later.

**No stomach gurgling. No bloating. No fear.** Just normal meals with no regrets.

**You don’t need to “risk it” anymore**  
I know I’m not the only one who used to eat dairy while quietly hoping for the best. That kind of guessing game gets old fast. DairyPill has made a real difference for me, and if you’ve been frustrated with other options, it might be worth a try.

I can’t tell you if it’ll work for you the same way it worked for me, but with the way it’s helped so far, I figured I should share.

If you’ve got any questions about how I use it or what meals it’s worked with, feel free to ask. Always happy to help someone else avoid another disappointing night of bloating.",0,1750149861.0,NaturalLifeHacks,0,0.5,False

The difficult part about writing up an interview with Farokh Engineer is choosing where to start. Do you go with one of his stories about George Best, Denis Compton, Sir Donald Bradman, Muhammad Ali or Sir Alex Ferguson, to name just a few of the sporting legends we chat about?



Or how about this one. “You know Pele once slept in that room?” he says pointing at an upstairs window of his detached house in Cheshire. “I met him at a dinner in Stoke organised by Gordon Banks. He was playing Mere Golf Club the next day, which is right next to my house, so I said: ‘Come over and stay.’



“My wife took him up a cup of tea in the morning, he was very nice. Then we played golf with Bobby.” With Bobby? “Yes, Bobby Charlton.”



It was a throwaway anecdote at the end of nearly two hours packed full of stories tumbling out of the 87-year-old Engineer, fuelled by regular cups of coffee brought to us in the garden by his wife Julie, and with their toddler grandson running around, playing at our feet in the warm sunshine with the family dog.



Engineer made the north-west of England his home almost 60 years ago when he joined Lancashire as one of county cricket’s pioneering overseas players and the dash and twinkle in the eye have not dimmed with age.



True, two new knees and an upcoming heart-valve operation would make hooking Wes Hall off his nostrils a little more difficult these days than in 1967 when he almost made a hundred before lunch for India against West Indies.







“No helmet and just a pink plastic box that wasn’t going to do anything,” he says about that innings. “I loved fast bowling. The quicker they came, the quicker they went, that was my theory.”



Indian players were paid 50 rupees a day back then for facing Hall and Charlie Griffith. The mind boggles at what Engineer, the first Indian poster boy of cricket who oozed flair and panache, would earn now in the IPL as an opening bat and keeper. “Sachin Tendulkar once told me: ‘If you were playing today, you would be by far the highest earner.’”

  


‘George Best was Rogue No 1, I was Rogue No 2’



Engineer played 46 Tests between 1961 and 1975 and appeared twice in the Rest of the World XI series against England in 1970 that later had Test status withdrawn.







He was at Lancashire between 1968 and 1976, signing alongside his great friend Clive Lloyd. In a golden era of domestic one-day cricket, Engineer won the Gillette Cup four times and the Sunday League twice.



“I recommended a player called Clive Hubert Lloyd, actually I was talking to him only yesterday, and Cyril Washbrook was the chairman of cricket at Lancashire and he said: ‘But Farokh, he wears glasses.’ I just said: ‘Mr Washbrook, I know he wears glasses but you sign him and you won’t regret it.’ And he was my room-mate for over 10 years and we had a great partnership. We travelled everywhere together and, oh, gosh, I don’t know how we’re still alive; we were both party animals.



“My friendship with George Best grew at that time too because he had just come over from Ireland.”



“Time and again I used to leave him at midnight and say, ‘George, come on, time to go’ and he would say ‘Rooky’, that was my nickname because Farokh was too difficult for an Irishman to say. He would say: ‘No, you go home.’ He would go to bed at 2-3am and the next day score goals; genius.



“My best story with him was that I had this car sponsored by Quicks, a Ford garage near Old Trafford. I had a red Ford Escort – Lancashire colours. After training, I said: ‘Come on, George, I will give you a lift in my new car.’ We were passing through Stretford and stopped at the traffic lights. George started chatting up this blonde next to the traffic lights. He was Rogue No 1, I was Rogue No 2. We were having a giggle and then I started the car and went straight up the arse of the car in front. I had taken my eyes off the road. I said to the driver: ‘Sorry my fault, but after all you don’t see many blondes in Bombay.’” A hearty laugh follows that one.



Despite the stories of a life that belongs to a different era, you just know Engineer would love playing now. Not once does he imply it was better in his day and he is hugely complimentary towards the current India team, now in England and preparing for the first Test at Headingley on June 20. But despite his allegiance to India, Lancashire is in his blood, and he speaks with as much pride about the Red Rose as playing for his country of birth.



The club have been great to me. They have named a suite at the ground after me, what an honour. The people of Lancashire have been so kind, too. I was caught speeding twice by this young cop, and both times he let me go. ‘My dad would kill me if I gave you a ticket,’ he said.



“I’m feeling great for 87 but so many of my colleagues have been dropping like ninepins. Peter Lever just died and so I’m very grateful to God for life. I’ve always lived my life. I’ve always enjoyed my life. I’ve never just existed, and even at this age I’m active.”

  


‘Coming to England, I met all my heroes’



Engineer ran a textile business in Manchester after retirement and was an ICC match referee for a while and briefly worked for Test Match Special, where he thinks he encountered racism for the only time in his long life in England.



“I thought I was doing well. Fred Trueman, Brian Johnston and Christopher Martin-Jenkins were really for me but there was one person who always put me down. And I just wondered, was it racism? I never experienced any racism on the field.



“I don’t know the ins and outs of what happened at Yorkshire but Bumble \[David Lloyd\] was accused of being a racist in all that. I’m telling you, there’s not a racist bone in Bumble’s body. I know, because he was my team-mate for many years.”





Engineer is an ambassador for Veterans Cricket India, run by his businessman friend Anand Nair, that holds tournaments all over the world for age groups from over-40s upwards. The Brylcreem boy of India in the 1960s can still pull in a commercial deal.



“They used to like it because I batted in a cap and so my hair was out. Palmolive and other companies offered much better money, but my contract was with Brylcreem and it was prestigious because of its history with Compton and Keith Miller.”



There is a symmetry to the Compton association. A seven-year-old Engineer was in the stands at the Brabourne Stadium in Mumbai when Compton played in a Ranji Trophy match in 1945.



“He had just taken a fresh pack of chewing gum out and he saw me among the huge crowd, and he said: ‘Would you like a chewing gum?’ I was too nervous to say yes or no, and he just tossed it to me, and I caught it. ‘Oh’, he said, ‘good catch.’ And when I got to know Compo later, I said: ‘I used to worship you.’ That was one of the advantages of coming to England and playing county cricket. I met all my heroes. I was a voracious reader of cricket books and I used to read all their life stories – Compton, Godfrey Evans, Len Hutton.”

  


‘I was a bloody lunatic’



Engineer was a keeper who would go for every catch, and dive around despite his size, which was bigger than the average keeper at the time. He kept to the great Indian spin quartet of Bishan Bedi, Erapalli Prasanna, Bhagwath Chandrasekhar and Srinivas Venkataraghavan, and to Brian Statham at Lancashire.



“I was a bloody lunatic. I used to go for second-slip catches. I just thought, whatever a wicket-keeper can reach with his gloves on is the wicket-keeper’s catch. When Jack Bond was captain at Lancs, the first slip was called Butlin’s, you know, you go to Butlin’s for a holiday because you never got a ball.



“I covered a huge area, and I enjoyed it. That was my domain. I wanted to keep wicket to Brian Statham, such a nice man. He said publicly if I was behind the stumps throughout his career he would have finished with twice as many victims. I said: ‘George \[Statham’s nickname\], you must have been drunk when you said that.’ Because he had Godfrey Evans, who was my hero.



“In those days English bowlers used to pick the seam, it was almost allowed, with the result that Statham’s inswinger when it pitched middle and off, coming in, I used to charge down the leg side because I would get so many leg-slip catches which were four runs before that. I got a couple of stumpings off him down the leg side. When the ball was not carrying I would stand up to the stumps.



We were in the Cayman Islands once with Fred Trueman. It was past his time.” Engineer now breaks into his very good Trueman impression. “‘I’m the quickest bowler in t’world.’ And anyway I got a couple of stumpings off him. ‘Stop it’, Fred said. ‘People will think I’m a slow bowler’.



“These people, just legends of the game. I’m so lucky… Chandrasekhar, Prasanna, Bedi, Venkat. The other three were pretty easy to keep to but Chandrasekhar was very interesting to keep to because he bowled about 62mph. Normally he spun the ball viciously both ways, without knowing himself which way the ball was going three quarters of the time because he was a polio victim, his wrist bent a bit further.



“Time and again he bowled a batsman with a googly and I said: ‘Chandra, you tried to bowl a leg-spinner there, didn’t you?’ And he’d say: ‘Yeah, yeah.’ He was a very humble man. And I think he was the greatest spinner in the world. I could read him because I saw him grip the ball and saw the way it left his fingers. I saw it in the air and off the pitch. For me, it was like a split-second computerised effect because I could read him.”



Engineer feels that “99 per cent” of modern keepers have technical problems.



“In T20 you can get away with a batsman who can keep but not in Test cricket. You’ve got to have a proper keeper, not a backstop. I’ve watched modern keepers and they get up too soon. They snatch the ball, which is OK standing back. Some people only half-squat. I found you had to be right down, so it was much easier to stay low to go for diving catches or catches that don’t carry. It is much easier to come up than to come up and go down again – you lose a fraction of a second. So when they are playing \[in the\] sub-continent and the ball is lower and slower, they struggle.”



Keeping was in Engineer’s blood. He describes his childhood growing up in Bombay with his older brother Darius, who was a good club cricketer, and how keeping to him for the first time opened up his path in life. In the evenings after school he would throw a soft ball against a corrugated wall so it could bounce in any direction, and try to catch it.



“I went to Don Bosco School and my best friend was Shashi Kapoor, who would go on to be one of the great Bollywood actors. We were sitting on a bench in class yapping away one day when suddenly I saw this huge wooden duster hurled 100 miles per hour at us by the teacher. I’m telling you, he should have been a cover point for India. I think he would have hit the stumps every time.



“Anyway, I saw this duster hurtling straight toward his \[Kapoor’s\] face, and suddenly my sixth sense kicked in, I just stretched my hand out and caught the duster literally an inch from his face. I used to tease him that instead of getting the hero roles in films he would have ended up in horror movies if I hadn’t caught that duster.”



‘I stood up Miss Adelaide for Don Bradman’



Engineer is still celebrated when he goes back to India every year, often when a birthday party is held in his honour. He was presented with a lifetime achievement award by the BCCI during the first England Test in Hyderabad last year but his links to Mumbai have faded.



He sold his house on trendy Cuffe Parade years ago. “I sold it for tuppence, and today it is probably worth about £40 million. The Ambanis live next door. I never imagined property would just go sky high all of a sudden. So, yeah, whenever I see that property, I feel a bit sick.”



While we are chatting, Engineer’s wife is searching for a Baggy Green cap given to him as a gift by Bradman, which excites the photographer but is somewhere in storage. Instead he poses with a silver bat awarded for being top run scorer in a series against England.



There is a quote from Bradman on the back of Engineer’s autobiography that describes him as one of the “game’s great ambassadors on and off the field”. The respect was formed during a tour to Australia. “We were playing in Adelaide and I slipped over wearing rubber-soled shoes. Sir Don Bradman came into our dressing room and gave me a big telling off but invited me to his house for dinner. I had a date with Miss Adelaide that night, so I gave her number to one of my team-mates and told him to have a good time.



“I went to the Bradmans’ house and just wanted a beer and a steak but they gave me carrot juice and a vegetarian meal, thinking that’s what Indians ate and drank. Anyway, Sir Don gets out a projector and we start watching films of his innings. It is a bit odd, but he’s Don Bradman. What do you say? He told me about this shot and that shot he played and said I was too flamboyant. As I left I gave him a gift and he went away and came back with a cap, his baggy green.”



  




Engineer will be at Old Trafford for the India Test match in July. The struggles of his club this summer – coach and captain sacked and the team languishing in division two – have upset him. “My heart bleeds. I can’t bear to even open the papers. There is something radically wrong that needs to be rectified because Lancs are a great club. Bottom of the second division, I just can’t believe it.”



He thinks the retirement of Virat Kohli will help England but describes this India team as among the best to tour this country. “They could probably pick two teams that would give England a run for their money.”



A couple of weeks after our interview, I call to check on how the heart operation went. “Yes, all good,” he laughs. “I’m still alive and kicking.” The storyteller still has more tales to tell.

I have currently a gas stove (Karrimor Explore Stove) paired with some Decathlon pots (quite heavy as I used them previiusly for camping) and I want to move into alcohol stoves. I'm hammocking and I have a 50L backpack for the context and my current setup fits properly and leaves some space for additional clothes and food.

My cooking pots take 6,2l of space, trangia 25 takes 4l, the 27 takes 2,7l and 28 mini takes 1,2l

I'm looking to buy 28 Mini HA together with 25-2 HA or 27-2 HA. The thing is that Mini seems reasonable to take as you don't always want to cook something fancy that requires a lot of pots.

27-2 HA seems great for one but it's actually only 200g lighter and a bit smaller the 25-2 HA.

I thought about getting Mini HA together with 25-2 HA for different use cases but at the same time I'm looking at 27-2 as I'll mostly go into woods alone or in a group of 2, it could happen that the group will get bigger as I try to get my friends interested in the hobby though.

I generally like cooking normal meals and I like making proper coffee using drippers. What would be your advice here? I'm almost certain that I'd find a use case for the 28 Mini and both 27 or 25 seem reasonable to get as well, but the weight difference between 27 and 25 doesn't seem like much and kind of negates the bonus from using 27 for me. Even if I went into the woods alone but wanted to cook something fancier I think that the 25 would be better for that task, am I looking at it wrong?

Additionally I think about trangia bottles, 0,3 seems the best to get for short trips, especially solo, but how about going with let's say 3 people for 3 days (2 nights)? Is it better to take 0,3 and 1l or just go with 0,5l?

Here’s what I’ve gathered so far:

* **All imported fruits will be taxed**, even if the same fruit is grown locally (e.g. imported bananas or grapes).
* **Salt will be taxed**, including regular table salt.
* **Most cooking oils (except palm oil)** are subject to tax.
* **Diary products (yogurt, ghee, butter, margerine) except milk** will be hit.
* **Instant coffee, milk tea premix, and flavoured drinks** are taxable.
* **Frozen and preserved vegetables**, like mixed veg packs or canned mushrooms, are taxed too.
* **Fruit juices** are not exempted.
* **Dried seafood** like dried shrimp and anchovies aren’t spared either.
* **Personal care items** like skincare, cosmetics, and even some basic toiletries are hit.
* **Private education and certain medical services** (like aesthetic treatments) are also affected.

\^ I downloaded the document and asked ChatGPT to help me compile a list of taxable items and I double checked it. But I may have made some mistakes, so do correct me where I'm wrong.

I’ve been planning to start a small cupcake business with my mom. We’ve already saved some money for ingredients, packaging, and basic equipment.

We hadn’t spoken in five years. He was my ex from my mid-twenties someone I once thought I’d marry. Our breakup was quiet and clean, the kind that hurts more because there's no real villain, just life pulling people apart.

Then, one random morning, I got a text:
“I heard this song today and it reminded me of you.”
It was our song the one we slow danced to in our tiny apartment kitchen.

We started talking again. At first casually, then with more depth. He’d grown. So had I. We were both single, both a little softer around the edges from what life had thrown at us.

He asked if we could meet for coffee. We did, at the same bookstore café where our story once began. Conversation flowed like it used to but more mature, more intentional.

Before we left, he said,
“You always felt like home. And I’ve been homesick for a long time.”

That was six months ago. Now we’re dating again. No rushing. Just two people choosing each other again—this time, with open eyes and healed hearts.

SCP-9631: “Well the tests were enjoyable I wish I could do more with my portals I would love to assist in the SCP Foundation. The mere enjoyment of protecting is amazing to me. As for being contained I love it. The information that I gain. I assist with some of the contain my procedures and containment chambers. Now for 682 our interaction was cut so short sadly he told me to leave continuously. It would’ve been nice to have a conversation with it.” 

Dr.Bright: “Thats amazing to hear 9631 my questions being answered beautifully. May I say talking to someone so intelligent as yourself is an honor. But breaks the final question of our conversation. How do we kill 682”

1ldhm6n,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ldhm6n/26nb_25f_5_years_she_said_she_needed_space_i_gave/,26NB & 25F (5 Years) — She said she needed space. I gave it to her. She never came back.,"I'm 26NB and she’s 25F. We were together for 5 years. I honestly thought she was it for me - my future, my family, my anchor.

About six months ago, she told me she “needed space.” Not a breakup, just breathing room. She said she was overwhelmed and needed time to think. I didn’t want to lose her, so I gave her what she asked for - no pressure, no guilt. Just space.

We texted a little at first. Then less. Then nothing.

One day I saw her tagged in a photo with someone new. Same city, same coffee shop we used to go to, same smile - just not for me.

No goodbye. No closure. Just a fade-out.

And here I am, six months later, still wondering if giving her space was just an easier way to disappear. I thought I was doing the right thing. Now I just feel like I got ghosted by the person who knew me best.

I’m not even angry. Just tired. Just sad. Just needed to get it off my chest.",1,1750148082.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False
