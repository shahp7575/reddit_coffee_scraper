- Over 3,000 miles of travel across six time zones, serviced by a business‑class charter flight.
- Planning started nine months ahead, securing a suitable hotel, venue and flight logistics before the opponent was confirmed.
- A scouting delegation visited Astana ten weeks before kick‑off to photograph the stadium, verify the artificial 4G pitch, inspect showers, changing rooms and bus drop‑off zones, and review fan ticket allocations and safety.
- Five weeks out, players received detailed itineraries; the kit department packed more than 60 items, including a coffee machine, widescreen televisions and a heat‑press for on‑site shirt numbering.
- Two weeks before the match the final squad list was locked, a direct Cardiff‑Astana charter flight was confirmed and hotel rooms were prepared as temporary physio and kit areas.
- On matchday, coordinated briefings, transport and equipment setup ensured the squad could focus solely on the 90‑minute contest.

Why it matters: thorough logistics aim to minimise fatigue and give Wales the best possible conditions for performance.

ZAIA
“I have some good news, Zaia. Sebastian will be so excited. Congratulations, you’re pregnant!” The
doctor’s words ring in my mind as I stare down at the test reports once again, as I leave the hospital.
“Sorry!” I say, as I avoid bumping into someone, my heart skipping a beat as I place a hand on my
stomach protectively, hurrying towards my awaiting car.
My driver, Ethan, is waiting beside the sleek black car and he opens the door for me, bowing his head.
“Thank you!” I say as I get in gracefully.
“Where to, ma’am?” he asks once he gets in the car. (*)
“Home,” I say, unable to suppress my smile, excitement bubbling through me.
This is actually happening. I’ve been trying for a baby for three years and finally…
finally, I am pregnant.
I want to shout it from the rooftop, tell everyone that yes! I’m pregnant with the heir to the pack! But I
contain my excitement. I need to tell Sebastian the good news first.
Sebastian is the Alpha of the Dark Hollow Falls pack. It is one of the largest packs on
the eastern side of the state.
However, with the large territory also comes the dangerous borders that roam with rogues, ready to
tear apart anyone who gets in their way.
Werewolves spend their entire lives searching and hoping to find their destined mates. As for me, I had
a crush on Bastien from the moment I had seen him when I
was eleven years old.
That crush never went away and when he turned out to be my fated mate, it had
been a dream come true and we had married.
+15 BONUS
He desperately wanted an heir, and which Alpha doesn’t? I had just turned eighteen
when I found him, but he was thirty one at the time. Many other alphas have sons.
who are already being trained to become the next alphas at his age.
“Make haste, Ethan, I have a lot to do today,” I say to the driver as I sit back against
the plush leather seat.
Reaching our large gated mansion, I step inside and head straight to the kitchen, my
stilettos echoing on the wooden floors. I will cook his favourite pudding and place
the reports underneath the plate!
“You may take the evening off, get some rest,” I say to the maid, Emma. “I’ll cook for
us tonight.”
“Oh, thank you, Luna!” she says, placing down the dish towel she had been holding.”
I am certain Alpha will absolutely be so happy if you make him his favourite dessert!
Not to mention he doesn’t like sweet things, but your pudding is something he can’t
resist!”
I can’t help but smile at her words. Yes, Sebastien doesn’t enjoy sweet things aside
from me and the cream pie that he loves.
My cheeks heat as I remember the first time he had told me that it’s now his second
favourite dessert, and in hopes of making his favourite dessert, I had asked him
what his favourite was. Only for him to smirk and reply; you.
I can’t help but smile from ear to ear, the elated feeling creating a pleasant buzz
around me as I get to work wanting everything to be perfect for his return.
Hours pass and when everything is almost ready, I change into something pretty and set up the dining
table with candles and the food.
“Almost 9pm…” he will be home soon.
With the troubles that have surrounded our borders, as well as having to run the
business, Sebastian often works until late into the night. But he would try to come
home by 9.30pm and continue working from home if necessary.
I sit down on the chair, watching the clock tick away, the sound loud in the room’s
silence.
Once again, I look down at my stomach, smiling softly as I await the return of my
mate.
Time passes slowly and soon 11 o’clock comes and goes, but I’m not deterred, maybe
I will reheat the food again….
I have just placed the reheated meals on the table when my head jerks up at the
sound of footsteps, making my heart thud at the sudden sound. I look toward the door excitedly.
Finally, he is home!
The front door shuts, and a familiar faint scent of my mate hits my nose.
I cast a swift glance at the clock on the wall. To my surprise, it’s past midnight.
I rush to the hall, the excitement of finally being able to tell him the good news
filling me. There he is, in the dimly lit hall. He still looks as handsome as ever.
Three and a half years on, he still makes my heart skip a beat whenever I see him.
He loosens his black tie, as he places his briefcase down, holding a few files in his
hands as well. His bright blue eyes look tired as they meet mine and I smile.
“Sebastian!” I rush over to him, wrapping my arms around his neck.
He catches me with one arm, but there’s no enthusiasm. He must have had a really
hard day. I don’t mind; I know how stressful things are at work lately.
Placing me back on the floor, he raises a brow as he looks down a
at me.
“Why are you awake at this time?” he asks me in his deep, rugged voice.
“I was waiting for you. I wanted to have dinner together. There’s something I wanted to tell you,” I
explain as I help him out of his jacket, brushing a piece of lint from hist white shirt that is no longer as
crisp as it was this morning.
“I’ve already eaten,” he replies, surprising me as heads towards the living room. “I have something to
tell you.”
“Ok, you go first,” I say as he drops onto the sofa, stretching his long legs, and resting
his arm on the back of the sofa.
I sit down beside him, knowing he would share something regarding the work.
meeting. After all, I am knowledgeable on these matters and he’d often get my
opinion on his ideas.
is ever.
However, there’s something off. There’s a coldness in he looks into mine.
Sebastian looks down at the file in his hands before he tosses it on the table, the
loud snap as it hits the table makes me jump.
“Read it.”
I take it uneasily and flip open the blank file, but the red words in bold print at the
top of the first page make my blood run cold.
‘DIVORCE AGREEMENT”
I gasp as I quickly scan the document. That feeling becomes worse. This is a divorce agreement with
our name on it… My entire body trembles as I look up at him, hurt.
and confused.
“W–why?” I manage to blurt out as I look at the man I love from the bottom of my
heart.
What went wrong?
“Annalise is back, and she’s rejoined the pack.”
I look up sharply. It’s suddenly hard to breathe.
“But I am your mate,” I whisper. How could he still care for Annalise? She was his
past. “We’ve been married for three years.”
“Our marriage was a mistake from the very beginning. Back then, my father
demanded that I marry my mate, but now I don’t want to be bound by the Goddess‘
arrangement. I don’t see the point of fated mates.”
My heart clenches. I look at his face, trying to understand what he’s thinking, but
there’s nothing that reveals his feelings and he has his walls up, blocking the mate
bond.
+15 BONUS
“But your father, he-”
“My Mom is not my father’s mate, but she still gave birth to me. She gave him at powerful Alpha son
and even after he found his mate, he stayed by her side,
rejecting his mate. I will never understand his reason for wanting me with my
destined mate when he himself is proof that you don’t need your mate.”
Those words are worse than being stabbed a thousand times, and I can feel my eyes
prickle with tears, the agony my wolf is feeling consuming me.
Does he really think that is the truth? Annalise is my half–sister and although she
and Sebastian had dated, I know her truth, the real her that she hides behind her
pretty face and doe eyes.
“Annalise only approached you because you were an Alpha… Sebastian, she doesn’t
love you the way I do. She wants to be Luna-”
He kicks the solid oak coffee table, making me jump as it’s thrown over with a loud
crash, hitting the wooden floor with a deafening bang that makes the ornaments in
the glass cabinet shake.
“And what about you? You just want to be Luna, don’t you! You knew that Annalise
and I were in a relationship, yet you selfishly accepted the marriage anyway and betrayed your own
sister by taking her man! You lied to me. She’s told me
everything!” 5.
“No, that’s not true. Let me explain-”
“Don’t antagonise me, Zaia, you got what you wanted, you became my wife and Luna,
but that wasn’t enough for you. You forced Annalise from coming anywhere near
this pack because you knew once she returned, I would learn everything!”
Yes, I did want Annalise to leave, but I never made her leave. She left of her own
accord once she learned Sebastian had found his mate, but now, it’s almost as if she
has been planning her return all this time.
Is she really enough to come between what we have? Sadly, I look into his eyes, realising he never
trusted me. He’s now judging and calculating everything I gave. him with suspicion, as if I had played
him to gain the position of Luna.
+15 BONUS
Doesn’t he realise I fell for him before I even knew he was an Alpha? Has he always been wary of me?
That one person can come between us and ruin it all? Did he even
for a moment, truly love me wholeheartedly?
I can’t understand it. Tell me Bastian… If you didn’t want me, then why did you make
love to me? Why did you touch me like I was the only woman who mattered to you?
Taking a deep breath, I ask him the decisive question. “Sebastian… Tell me, if it
wasn’t your father’s request-”
“Then I would have rejected you, and even now, I will, for Annalise.”
My lips quiver, remembering how my father hadn’t been happy with me marrying him. He never liked
Sebastian’s family, yet I had given it all up for him.
My family… my inheritance and my position, but it was clearly not enough for him.
If he’s able to cast me aside so easily, then what is my use?
He exhales as if I’m an irritating child and takes out a lighter and cigarette.
“Sign the papers soon. I don’t want this to drag out,” he says.
I stare down at the file as a single tear splashes onto the
“What did you want to tell me?” he asks.
papers.
“It’s no longer important… forget about it,” I say, thinking he will never see the
papers that currently sit on the dining room table.
“If you have any concerns regarding the alimony, let me know. Your expenses will
be covered and you are welcome to stay in the pack.”
That hurts.
“No… there’s no need. Everything is fine as it is. I will sign and have these returned. to you
immediately,” I reply as I stand up, trying to hold myself together when my entire world has come
crashing down around me.
He pauses for a second and simply nods, uncaring about my heartbreak and that I know he can feel
through the bond. Could he really cast me, his own mate, aside for another woman?
agony
The answer is in front of me, and although it is painful, the truth is yes, yes, he could.
“You may remain here for tonight. It’s late anyway. Annalise won’t move in until
everything is settled. I don’t want her to feel uncomfortable.”
I stare up into his handsome face, trying to recognise the man I fell for.
I smile bitterly and nod at him.
“Don’t worry, I’ll be gone. Say hi to Annalise for me.”

  Later, I found out his name was John Daggett, but that's not how he introduced himself the day he walked into my office. Even at the time, I sensed that something was off, but I couldn't figure out what it was. The job he hired me to do seemed simple enough, but then the bum tried to stiff me for my fee. When you're self-employed, you can't afford to let these things slide. Word gets out and first thing you know, everybody thinks you can be had. I went after him for the money and the next thing I knew, I was caught up in events I still haven't quite recovered from.  
  
  My name is Kinsey Millhone. I'm a private investigator, licensed by the state of California, operating a small office in Santa Teresa, which is where I've lived all my thirty-two years. I'm female, self-supporting, single now, having been married and divorced twice. I confess I'm sometimes testy, but for the most part I credit myself with an easygoing disposition, tempered (perhaps) by an exaggerated desire for independence. I'm also plagued with the sort of doggedness that makes private investigation a viable proposition for someone with a high school education, certification from the police academy, and a constitutional inability to work for anyone else. I pay my bills on time, obey most laws, and I feel that other people should do likewise... out of courtesy, if nothing else. I'm a purist when it comes to justice, but I'll lie at the drop of a hat. Inconsistency has never troubled me.  
  
  It was late October, the day before Halloween, and the weather was mimicking autumn in the Midwest – clear and sunny and cool. Driving into town, I could have sworn I smelled woodsmoke in the air and I half expected the leaves to be turning yellow and rust. All I actually saw were the same old palm trees, the same relentless green everywhere. The fires of summer had been contained and the rains hadn't started yet. It was a typical California unseason, but it felt like fall and I was responding with inordinate good cheer, thinking maybe I'd drive up the pass in the afternoon to the pistol range, which is what I do for laughs.  
  
  I'd come into the office that Saturday morning to take care of some bookkeeping chores – paying personal bills, getting out my statements for the month. I had my calculator out, a Redi-Receipt form in the typewriter, and four completed statements lined up, addressed and stamped, on the desk to my left. I was so intent on the task at hand that I didn't realize anyone was standing in the doorway until the man cleared his throat. I reacted with one of those little jumps you do when you open the evening paper and a spider runs out. He apparently found this amusing, but I was having to pat myself on the chest to get my heart rate down again.  
  
  ""I'm Alvin Limardo,"" he said. ""Sorry if I startled you.""  
  
  ""That's all right,"" I said, ""I just had no idea you were standing there. Are you looking for me?""  
  
  ""If you're Kinsey Millhone, I am.""  
  
  I got up and shook hands with him across the desk and then suggested that he take a seat. My first fleeting impression had been that he was a derelict, but on second glance, I couldn't find anything in particular to support the idea.  
  
  He was in his fifties, too gaunt for good health. His face was long and narrow, his chin pronounced. His hair was an ash gray, clipped short, and he smelled of citrus cologne. His eyes were hazel, his gaze remote. The suit he wore was an odd shade of green. His hands seemed huge, fingers long and bony, the knuckles enlarged. The two inches of narrow wrist extending, cuffless, from his coat sleeves suggested shabbiness though his clothing didn't really look worn. He held a slip of paper which he'd folded twice, and he fiddled with that selfconsciously.  
  
  ""What can I do for you?"" I asked.  
  
  ""I'd like for you to deliver this."" He smoothed out the piece of paper then and placed it on my desk. It was a cashier's check drawn on a Los Angeles bank, dated October 29, and made out to someone named Tony Gahan for twenty-five thousand dollars.  
  
  I tried not to appear as surprised as I felt. He didn't look like a man with money to spare. Maybe he'd borrowed the sum from Gahan and was paying it back. ""You want to tell me what this is about?""  
  
  ""He did me a favor. I want to say thanks. That's all it is.""  
  
  ""It must have been quite a favor,"" I said. ""Do you mind if I ask what he did?""  
  
  ""He showed me a kindness when I was down on my luck.""  
  
  ""What do you need me for?""  
  
  He smiled briefly. ""An attorney would charge me a hundred and twenty dollars an hour to handle it. I'm assuming you'd charge considerably less.""  
  
  ""So would a messenger service,"" I said. ""It's cheaper still if you do it yourself."" I wasn't being a smart-mouth about it. I really didn't understand why he needed a private detective.  
  
  He cleared his throat. ""I tried that, but I'm not entirely certain of Mr. Gahan's current address. At one time, he lived on Stanley Place, but he's not there now. I went by this morning and the house is empty. It looks like it hasn't been lived in for a while. I want someone to track him down and make sure he gets the money. If you can estimate what that might run me, I'll pay you in advance.""  
  
  ""That depends on how elusive Mr. Gahan turns out to be. The credit bureau might have a current address, or the DMV. A lot of inquiries can be done by phone, but they still take time. At thirty bucks an hour, the fee does mount up.""  
  
  He took out a checkbook and began to write out a check. ""Two hundred dollars?""  
  
  ""Let's make it four. I can always refund the balance if the charges turn out to be less,"" I said. ""In the meantime, I've got a license to protect so this better be on the up and up. I'd be happier if you'd tell me what's going on.""  
  
  This was where he hooked me, because what he said was just offbeat enough to be convincing. Liar that I am, it still didn't occur tome that there could be so much falsehood mixed in with the truth.  
  
  ""I got into trouble with the law awhile back and served some time. Tony Gahan was helpful to me just before I was arrested. He had no idea of my circumstances so he wasn't an accessory to anything, nor would you be. I feel indebted.""  
  
  ""Why not take care of it yourself?""  
  
  He hesitated, almost shyly I thought. ""It's sort of like that Charles Dickens book, Great Expectations. He might not like having a convicted felon for a benefactor. People have strange ideas about ex-cons.""  
  
  ""What if he won't accept an anonymous donation?""  
  
  ""You can return the check in that case and keep the fee.""  
  
  I shifted restlessly in my chair. What's wrong with this picture, I asked myself. ""Where'd you get the money if you've been in jail?""  
  
  ""Santa Anita. I'm still on parole and I shouldn't be playing the ponies at all, but I find it hard to resist. That's why I'd like to pass the money on to you. I'm a gambling man. I can't have that kind of cash around or I'll piss it away, if you'll pardon my French."" He closed his mouth then and looked at me, waiting to see what else I might ask. Clearly, he didn't want to volunteer more than was necessary to satisfy my qualms, but he seemed amazingly patient. I realized later, of course, that his tolerance was probably the function of his feeding me so much bullshit. He must have been entertained by the game he was playing. Lying is fun. I can do it all day myself.  
  
  ""What was the felony?"" I asked.  
  
  He dropped his gaze, addressing his reply to his oversized hands, which were folded in his lap. ""I don't think that pertains. This money is clean and I came by it honestly. There's nothing illegal about the transaction if that's what's worrying you.""  
  
  Of course it worried me, but I wondered if I was being too fastidious. There was nothing wrong with his request on the face of it. I chased the proposition around in my head with caution, wondering what Tony Gahan had done for Limardo that would net him this kind of payoff. None of my business, I supposed, as long as no laws had been broken in the proces  
s. Intuition was telling me to turn this guy down, but it happens that the rent on my apartment was due the next day. I had the money in my checking account, but it seemed providential to have a retainer drop in my lap unexpectedly. In any event, I didn't see a reason to refuse. ""All right,"" I said.  
  
  He nodded once, pleased. ""Good.""  
  
  I sat and watched while he finished signing his name to the check. He tore it out and pushed it toward me, tucking the checkbook into the inner pocket of his suit coat. ""My address and telephone number are on that in case you need to get in touch.""  
  
  I pulled a standard contract form out of my desk drawer and took a few minutes to fill it in. I got his signature and then I made a note of Tony Gahan's last known address, a house in Colgate, the township just north of Santa Teresa. I was already feeling some low-level dread, wishing I hadn't agreed to do anything. Still, I'd committed myself, the contract was signed, and I figured I'd make the best of it. How much trouble could it be, thought I.  
  
  He stood up and I did too, moving with him as he walked toward the door. With both of us on our feet, I could see how much taller he was than I... maybe six-four to my five-foot-six. He paused with his hand on the knob, gazing down at me with the same remote stare.  
  
  ""One other thing you might need to know about Tony Gahan,"" he said.  
  
  ""What's that?""  
  
  ""He's fifteen years old.""  
  
  I stood there and watched Alvin Limardo move off down the hall. I should have called him back, folks. I should have known right then that it wasn't going to turn out well. Instead I closed the office door and returned to my desk. On impulse, I opened the French doors and went out on the balcony. I scanned the street below, but there was no sign of him. I shook my head, dissatisfied.  
  
  I locked the cashier's check in my file cabinet. When the bank opened on Monday, I'd put it in my safe deposit box until I located Tony Gahan and then turn it over to him. Fifteen?  
  
  At noon, I closed up the office and went down the back stairs to the parking lot, where I retrieved my VW, a decaying sedan with more rust than paint. This is not the sort of vehicle you'd choose for a car chase, but then most of what a P.I. does for a living isn't that exciting anyway. I'm sometimes reduced to serving process papers, which gets hairy now and then, but much of the time I do preemployment background checks, skip-tracing, or case-and-trial preparation for a couple of attorneys here in town. My office is provided by California Fidelity Insurance, a former employer of mine. The company headquarters is right next door and I still do sporadic investigations for them in exchange for a modest two rooms (one inner, one outer) with a separate entrance and a balcony overlooking State Street.  
  
  I went by the post office and dropped the mail in the box and then I stopped by the bank and deposited Alvin Limardo's four hundred dollars in my checking account.  
  
  Four business days later, on a Thursday, I got a letter from the bank, informing me that the check had bounced. According to their records, Alvin Limardo had closed out his account. In proof of this, I was presented with the check itself stamped across the face with the sort of officious looking purple ink that makes it clear the bank is displeased.  
  
  So was I.  
  
  My account had been debited the four hundred dollars and I was charged an additional three bucks, apparently to remind me, in the future, not to deal with deadbeats. I picked up the phone and called Alvin Limardo's number in Los Angeles. A disconnect. I'd been canny enough to ignore the search for Tony Gahan until the check cleared, so it wasn't as if I'd done any work to date. But how was I going to get the check replaced? And what was I going to do with the twenty-five grand in the meantime? By then, the cashier's check was tucked away in my safe deposit box, but it was useless to me and I didn't want to proceed with delivery until I knew I'd be paid. In theory, I could have dropped Alvin Limardo a note, but it might have come bouncing back at me with all the jauntiness of his rubber check, and then where would I be? Crap. I was going to have to drive down to L.A. One thing I've learned about collections – the faster you move, the better your chances are.  
  
  I looked up his street address in my Thomas Guide to Los Angeles Streets. Even on the map, it didn't look like a nice neighborhood. I checked my watch. It was then 10:15. It was going to take me ninety minutes to reach L.A., probably another hour to locate Limardo, chew him out, get the check replaced, and grab a bite of lunch. Then I'd have to drive ninety minutes back, which would put me in the office again at 3:30 or 4:00. Well, that wasn't too bad. It was tedious, but necessary, so I decided I might as well quit bellyaching and get on with it.  
  
  By 10:30, I'd gassed up my car and I was on the road.  
  
  Chapter 2  
  
  \* \* \*  
  
  I left the Ventura Freeway at Sherman Oaks, taking the San Diego Freeway south as far as Venice Boulevard. I exited, turning right at the bottom of the off-ramp. According to my calculations, the address I wanted was somewhere close. I doubled back toward Sawtelle, the street that hugs the freeway on a parallel route.  
  
  Once I saw the building, I realized that I'd spotted the rear of it from the freeway as I passed. It was painted the color of Pepto-Bismol and sported a sagging banner of Day-Glo orange that said NOW RENTING. The building was separated from the roadway by a concrete rain wash and protected from speeding vehicles by a ten-foot cinderblock wall sprayed with messages for passing motorists. Spiky weeds had sprung up along the base of the wall and trash had accumulated like hanging ornaments in the few hearty bushes that managed to survive the gas fumes. I had noted the building because it seemed so typical of L.A.: bald, cheaply constructed, badly defaced. There was something meanspirited about its backside, and the entrance turned out to be worse.  
  
  The street was largely made up of California ""bungalows,"" small two-bedroom houses of wood and stucco with ragged yards and no trees. Most of them had been painted in pastel hues, odd shades of turquoise and mauve, suggestive of discount paints that hadn't quite covered the color underneath. I found a parking space across the street and locked my car, then crossed to the apartment complex.  
  
  The building was beginning to disintegrate. The stucco looked mealy and dry, the aluminum window frames pitted and buckling. The wrought-iron gate near the front had been pulled straight out of the supporting wall, leaving holes large enough to stick a fist into. Two apartments at street level were boarded up. The management had thoughtfully provided a number of garbage bins near the stairs, without (apparently) paying for adequate trash removal services. A big yellow dog was scratching through this pile of refuse with enthusiasm, though all he seemed to net for his efforts was a quarter moon of pizza. He trotted off, the rim of crust clenched in his jaws like a bone.  
  
  I moved into the shelter of the stairs. Most of the mailboxes had been ripped out and mail was scattered in the foyer like so much trash. According to the address on the face of the check, Limardo lived in apartment 26, which I surmised was somewhere above. There were apparently forty units, only a few marked with the occupants' names. That seemed curious to me. In Santa Teresa, the post office won't even deliver junk mail unless a box is provided, clearly marked, and in good repair. I pictured the postman, emptying out his mail pouch like a wastepaper basket, escaping on foot then before the inhabitants of the building swarmed over him like bugs.  
  
  The apartments were arranged in tiers around a courtyard ""garden"" of loose gravel, pink paving stones, and nut grass. I picked my way up the cracked concrete steps.  
  
  At the second-floor landing, a black man was seated in a rickety metal folding chair, whittling with a knife on a bar of Ivory soap. There was a magazine open on his lap to catch the shavings. He was heavyset and shapeless, maybe fifty years old, his short-cropped frizzy hair showing gray around his ears. His eyes were a muddy brown, the lid of one pulled askew by a vibrant track of stitches that cut down along his cheek.  
  
  He took me in at a glance, turning his attention then to the sculpture taking form in his hands. ""You must be looking for Alvin Limardo,"" he said.  
  
  ""That's right,"" I said, startled. ""How  
'd you guess?""  
  
  He flashed a smile at me, showing perfect teeth, as snowy as the soap he carved. He tilted his face up at me, the injured eye creating the illusion of a wink. ""Baby, you ain't live here. I know ever'body live here. And from the look on your face, you ain't thinkin' to rent. If you knew where you were going, you'd be headed straight there. Instead, you be lookin' all around like somethin' might jump out on you, including me,"" he said and then paused to survey me. ""I'd say you do social work, parole, something like that. Maybe welfare.""  
  
  ""Not bad,"" I said. ""But why Limardo? What made you think I was looking for him?""  
  
  He smiled then, his gums showing pink. ""We all Alvin Limardo 'round here. It's a joke we play. Just a name we take when we jivin' folk. I been Alvin Limardo myself lass week at the food stamp line. He get welfare checks, disability, AFDC. Somebody show up lass week wid a warrant on him. I tole 'em, 'Alvin Limardo's done left. He gone. Ain't nobody here by that name about now.' The Alvin Limardo you want... he be white or black?""  
  
  ""White,"" I said and then described the man who'd come into my office on Saturday. The black man started nodding about halfway through, his knife blade still smoothing the surface of the soap. It looked like he'd carved a sow lying on her side with a litter of piglets scrambling over her to nurse. The whole of it couldn't have been more than four inches long.  
  
  ""That's John Daggett. Whooee. He bad. He the one you want, but he gone for sure.""  
  
  ""Do you have any idea where he went?""  
  
  ""Santa Teresa, I heard.""  
  
  ""Well, I know he was up there last Saturday. That's where I ran into him,"" I said. ""Has he been back since then?""  
  
  The man's mouth drooped with skepticism. ""I seen him on Monday and then he gone off again. Only other peoples must want him too. He acts like a man who's runnin' and don't want to be caught. What you want wid him?""  
  
  ""He wrote me a bum check.""  
  
  He shot me a look of astonishment. ""You take a check from a man like that? Lord God, girl! What's the matter wid you?""  
I had to laugh. ""I know. It's my own damn fault. I thought maybe I could catch him before he skipped out permanently.""  
  
  He shook his head, unable to sympathize. ""Don't take nothin' from the likes of him. That's your first mistake. Comin' 'round this place may be the next.""  
  
  ""Is there anybody here who might know how to get in touch with him?""  
  
  He pointed the blade of his knife toward an apartment two doors down. ""Axe Lovella. She might know. Then again, she might not.""  
  
  ""She's a friend of his?""  
  
  ""Not hardly. She's his wife.""  
  
  I felt somewhat more hopeful as I knocked at apartment 26. I was afraid he'd moved out altogether. The door was a hollowcore with a hole kicked into the bottom about shin high. The sliding glass window was open six inches, a fold of drapery sticking out. A crack ran diagonally across the pane, held together by a wide band of electrician's tape. I could smell something cooking inside, kale or collard greens, with a whisper of vinegar and bacon grease.  
  
  The door opened and a woman peered out at me. Her upper lip was puffy, like the kind of scrape children get falling off bicycles when they first learn to ride. Her left eye had been blackened not long ago and it was streaked now with midnight blue, the surrounding tissue a rainbow of green and yellow and gray. Her hair was the color of hay, parted in the middle and snagged up over each ear with a bobby pin. I couldn't even guess how old she might be. Younger than I expected, given John Daggett's age, which had to be fifty plus.  
  
  ""Lovella Daggett?""  
  
  ""That's right."" She seemed reluctant to admit that much.  
  
  ""I'm Kinsey Millhone. I'm looking for John.""  
  
  She licked uneasily at her upper lip as if she was still unfamiliar with its new shape and size. Some of the scraped area had formed a scab, which resembled nothing so much as half a moustache. ""He's not here. I don't know where he's at. What'd you want him for?""  
  
  ""He hired me to do some work, but he paid me with a bum check. I was hoping we could get it straightened out.""  
  
  She studied me while she processed the information. ""Hired you to do what?""  
  
  ""Deliver something.""  
  
  She didn't believe a bit of that. ""You a cop?""  
  
  ""No.""  
  
  ""What are you, then?""  
  
  I showed her the photostat of my license by way of reply. She turned and walked away from the door, leaving it open behind her. I gathered this was her method of inviting me in.  
  
  I stepped into the living room and closed the door behind me. The carpeting was that green cotton shag so admired by apartment owners everywhere. The only furniture in the room was a card table and two plain wooden chairs. A six-foot rectangle of lighter carpeting along one wall suggested that there'd once been a couch on the spot, and a pattern of indentations in the rug indicated the former presence of two heavy chairs and a coffee table, arranged in what decorators refer to as ""a conversational grouping."" Instead of conversation these days, Daggett apparently got right down to busting her chops, breaking anything else that came to hand. The one lamp I saw had been snapped off at the socket and the wires were hanging out like torn ligaments.  
  
  ""Where'd the furniture go?""  
  
  ""He hocked it all last week. Turns out he used the payments for his bar bill. The car went before that. It was a piece of junk, anyway, but I'd paid for it. You ought to see what I've got for a bed these days. Some peed-on old mattress he found out on the street.""  
  
  There were two bar stools at the counter and I perched on one, watching as Lovella ambled into the small space that served as a kitchen. An aluminum saucepan sat on a gas flame on the stove, the water in it boiling furiously. On one of the other back burners, there was a battered aluminum kettle filled with simmering greens.  
  
  Lovella wore blue jeans and a plain white tee shirt wrong-side out, the Fruit of the Loom label visible at the back of her neck. The bottom of the shirt had been pulled tight and knotted to form a halter, leaving her midriff bare. ""You want coffee? I was just fixing some.""  
  
  ""Yes, please,"" I said.  
  
  She rinsed a cup under the hot water faucet and gave it a quick swipe with a paper towel. She set it on the counter and spooned instant coffee into it and then used the same paper towel as a potholder when she reached for the saucepan. The water sputtered against the edge; of the pan as she poured. She added water to a second cup, gave a quick stir to the contents, and pushed it toward me with the spoon still resting up against the rim.  
  
  ""Daggett's a jerk. They should lock him up for life,"" she remarked, almost idly, I thought.  
  
  ""Did he do that to you?"" I asked, my gaze flicking across her bruised face.  
  
  She fixed a pair of dead gray eyes on me without bothering to reply. Up close, I could see that she wasn't much more than twenty-five. She leaned forward, resting her elbows on the counter, her coffee cup cradled in her hands. She wasn't wearing a bra and her breasts were big, as soft and droopy as balloons filled with water, her nipples pressing against the tee-shirt fabric like puckered knots. I wondered if she was a hooker. I'd known a few with the same careless sexuality – all surface, no feeling underneath.  
  
  ""How long have you been married?""  
  
  ""You care if I have a cigarette?""  
  
  ""It's your place. You can do anything you want,"" I said.  
  
  That netted me a wan smile, the first I'd seen. She reached for a pack of Pall Mall 100s, flipped on the gas burner, and lit her cigarette from it, tilting her head so her hair wouldn't catch fire. She took a deep drag and exhaled it, blowing a cloud of smoke at me. ""Six weeks,"" she said, answering my question belatedly. ""We were pen pals after he got sent to San Luis. Wrote for a year and then I married him the minute he got out. Dumb? Jesus. Can you believe I did that?""  
  
  I shrugged noncommittally. She didn't really care if I believed it or not. ""How'd you connect in the first place?""  
  
  ""A buddy of his. Guy named Billy Polo I used to date. They'd sit and talk about women and my name came up. I guess Billy made me sound like real hot stuff, so Daggett got in touch.""  
  
  I took a sip of my coffee. It had that flat, nearly sour taste of instant, with tiny clumps of coffee powder floating at the edge. ""Do you have any milk for this?""  
  
  ""Oh, sure. Sorry,"" she said. She moved over to the refrigerator where she took out a small can of Carnation.  
  
  It wasn't quite what I had in mind, but I added some to my coffee, intrigued as evaporated milk rose to the surface in a series of white dots. I wondered if a fortune teller could read the pattern, like tea leaves. I thought I spied some indigestion in my future, but I wasn't sure.  
  
  ""Daggett's a charmer when he wants,"" she said. ""Give him a couple of drinks, though, and he's mean as a snake.""  
  
  That was a story I'd heard before. ""Why don't you leave?"" said I, as I always do.  
  
  ""Because he'd come after me is why,"" she said snappishly. ""You don't know him. He'd kill me without giving it a second thought. Same thing if I called the cops. Talk back to that man and he'll punch your teeth down your throat. He hates women is what's the matter with him. Of course, when he sobers up, he can charm your socks off. Anyway, I'm hoping he's gone for good. He got a phone call Monday morning and he was out of here like a shot. I haven't heard from him since. Of course, the phone was disconnected yesterday so I don't know how he'd reach me even if he wanted to.""  
  
  ""Why don't you talk to his parole officer?""  
  
  ""I guess I could,"" she said reluctantly. ""He reports to the guy every time he turns around. For two days he had a job, but he quit that. Of course, he's not supposed to drink. I guess he tried to play by the rules at first, but it was too much.""  
  
  ""Why not get out while you have the chance?""  
  
  ""And go where? I don't have a nickel to my name.""  
  
  ""There are shelters for battered women. Call the rape crisis center. They'll know.""  
  
  She gestured dismissively. ""Jesus, I love people like you. You ever had a guy punch you out?""  
  
  ""Not one I was married to,"" I said. ""I wouldn't put up with that shit.""  
  
  ""That's what I used to say, sister, but I'll  
tell you what. You don't get away as easy as all that. Not with a bastard like Daggett. He swears he'd follow me to the ends of the earth and he would.""  
  
  ""What was he in prison for?""  
  
  ""He never said and I never asked. Which was also dumb. It didn't make any difference to me at first. He was fine for a couple weeks. Just like a kid, you know? And sweet? Lord, he trotted around after me like a puppy dog. We couldn't get enough of each other and it all seemed just like the letters we wrote. Then he got into the Jack Daniel's one night and the shit hit the fan.""  
  
  ""Did he ever mention the name Tony Gahan?""  
  
  ""Nuh-uh. Who's he?""  
  
  ""I'm not sure. Some kid he asked me to find.""  
  
  ""What'd he pay you with? Can I see the check?""  
  
  I took it out of my handbag and laid it on the counter. I thought it best not to mention the cashier's check. I didn't think she'd take kindly to his giving money away. ""I understand Limardo is a fabricated name.""  
  
  She studied the check. ""Yeah, but Daggett did keep some money in this account. I think he cleaned it out just before he left."" She took a drag of her cigarette as she handed back the check. I managed to turn my head before she blew smoke in my face again.  
  
  ""That phone call he got Monday, what was it about? Do you know?""  
  
  ""Beats me. I was off at the Laundromat. I got home and he was still on the phone, his face as gray as that dish rag. He hung up quick and then started shovin' stuff in a duffel. He turned the place upside down lookin' for his bank book. I was afraid he'd come after me, thinkin' I took it, but I guess he was too freaked out to worry about me.""  
  
  ""He told you that?""  
  
  ""No, but he was cold sober and his hands were shaking bad.""  
  
  ""You have any idea where he might have gone?""  
  
  A look flashed through her eyes, some emotion she concealed by dropping her gaze. ""He only had one friend and that was Billy Polo up in Santa Teresa. If he needed help, that's where he'd go. I think he used to have family up there too, but I don't know what happened to them. He never talked much about that.""  
  
  ""So Polo's out of prison?""  
  
  ""I heard he got out just recently.""  
  
  ""Well, maybe I'll track him down since that's the only lead I have. In the meantime, would you find a phone and call me if you hear from either one?"" I took out a business card and jotted my home address and phone on the back. ""Call collect.""  
  
  She looked at both sides of the card. ""What do you think is goin' on?""  
  
  ""I don't know and I don't much care. As soon as I run him down, I'll clean up this business and bail out.""

  \* \* \*  
  
  As long as I was in the area, I went by the bank. The woman in charge of customer service couldn't have been less helpful. She was dark haired, in her early twenties, and new at the job I gathered because she greeted my every request with the haunted look of someone who isn't quite sure of the rules and therefore says no to everything. She would not verify ""Alvin Limardo's"" account number or the fact that the account had been closed. She would not tell me if there was, perhaps, another account in John Daggett's name. I knew there had to be a registered copy of the cashier's check itself, but she refused to verify the information he'd given at the time. I kept thinking there was some other tack I might take, especially with that much money at stake. Surely, the bank must care what happened to twenty-five thousand dollars. I stood at the counter and stared at the woman, and she stared back. Maybe she hadn't understood.  
  
  I took out the photostat of my license and pointed. ""Look,"" I said, ""You see this? I'm a private investigator. I've got a real problem here. I was hired to deliver a cashier's check, but now I can't find the man who gave it to me and I don't know the whereabouts of the person who's supposed to receive it and I'm just trying to get a lead so I can do what I was hired to do.""  
  
  ""I understand that,"" she said.  
  
  ""But you won't give me any information, right?""  
  
  ""It's against bank regulations.""  
  
  ""Isn't it against bank regulations for Alvin Limardo to write me a bad check?""  
  
  ""Yes.""  
  
  ""Then what am I supposed to do with it?"" I said. I really knew the answer... eat it, dum-dum... but I was feeling stubborn and perverse.  
  
  ""Take him to small claims court,"" she said.  
  
  ""But I can't find him. He can't be hauled into court if nobody knows where he is.""  
  
  She stared at me blankly, offering no comment.  
  
  ""What about the twenty-five thousand?"" I said. ""What am I supposed to do with that?""  
  
  ""I have no idea.""  
  
  I stared down at the desk. When I was in kindergarten, I was a biter and I still struggle with the urge. It just feels good, you know? ""I want to speak to your supervisor.""  
  
  ""Mr. Stallings? He's gone for the day.""  
  
  ""Well, is there anybody else here who might give me some help on this?""  
  
  She shook her head. ""I'm in charge of customer service.""  
  
  ""But you're not doing a thing. How can you call it customer service when you don't do shit?""  
  
  Her mouth turned prim. ""Please don't use language like that around me. It's very offensive.""  
  
  ""What do I have to do to get help around here?""  
  
  ""Do you have an account with us?""  
  
  ""If I did, would you help?""  
  
  ""Not with this. We're not supposed to divulge information about bank customers.""  
  
  This was silly. I walked away from her desk. I wanted to make a withering remark, but I couldn't think of one. I knew I was just mad at myself for taking the job to begin with, but I was hoping to lay a little ire off on her... a pointless enterprise. I got back in my car and headed toward the freeway. When I reached Santa Teresa, it was 4:35. I bypassed the office altogether and went home. My disposition improved the minute I walked in. My apartment was once a single-car garage and consists now of one room, fifteen feet on a side, with a narrow extension on the right that serves as a kitchenette, separated from the living area by a counter. The space is arranged with cunning: a stackable washer-dryer tucked in beside the kitchenette, bookshelves, drawers and storage compartments built into the wall. It's tidy and self-contained and all of it suits me absolutely. I have a six-foot convertible sofa that I usually sleep on as is, a desk, a chair, an endtable, and plump pillows that serve as additional seating if anyone comes over to sit. My bathroom is one of those preformed fiberglass units with everything molded into it, including a towel bar, a soap holder, and a cutout for a window that looks out at the street. Sometimes I stand in the bathtub, elbows resting on the sill, and stare at passing cars, just thinking how lucky I am. I love being single.

My house sitting in Danforth is coming to an end (moved to the city this year) so I am looking to now rent an apartment in the city. I work remotely so don’t need to be anywhere in particular, but I would like to be in Toronto for activities, playing sports, making friends, and dating.

I like charming neighborhoods where I can walk to a cute coffee shop or boutique grocer, ideally lots of green space for my dog. I am not a big fan of the transit system here and prefer to drive when I need to go anywhere since I have oddly found that to be the least annoying way to get around so far, so somewhere not stupidly difficult to get to by car / where having a car wouldn’t be annoying would be great.

I don’t want somewhere super loud at night, but I also don’t want to be in a dead neighborhood with no one my age and only families.

I’d like somewhere I can be around similar people my age, where I can head out to a cafe to work and meet the love of my life, you know?

I started answering as a comment, but gradually got pulled down the rabbit hole and realized my comment was a post.  

**Business Decisions**

When thugs are scoping out their next victim they are making business decisions, so they do ease away from going after people who might be tough and resist, and instead aim at people who seem like they might be weak and compliant.  

For instance, I lived in Angeles City/Subic in the Philippines for about eighteen months off and on.  There were literally thousands of retired US, UK, Australian, and various EU military veterans going all the way back to World War II.  

And there was almost no street crime against Western men in large measure because these guys had a tough reputation.  I heard numerous stories about a gang of Filipinos who decided to pick on the fat, drunk 70-year-old American guy who turned out to be a retired Vietnam-era SEAL Master Chief or the annoying Aussie young who turned out to have done half a dozen tours in Afghanistan with the Australian SAS. Whether those stories were true or just urban legends, I don't know.  But I know many of the local Filipinos half-thought they were true, because it came up a couple of times in conversations with locals.  

Given the casual way most Westerners went to ATM's at night, wore expensive jewelry, and generally flaunted their wealth, it is a miracle there were not more muggings of the hundreds the 50 to 80 year old drunks stumbling home every night from Walking Street each night.  Add in the anger over these foreing men taking their most beautiful women, and I am amazed there were not more problems. 

**How To Keep From Being a Victim**

Basically, you want to make it appear that you would be a bad business decision for a thug.  There are a lot of ways to do this and here is what the Center For Violence Prevention and Seff Defense suggests criminals are looking for in a victim:

* ***Detecting Vulnerability;*** *Attackers seek out individuals who seem vulnerable, distracted or mentally preoccupied. Those who appear lost unaware of their surroundings or absorbed in their devices are often perceived as targets.*
* ***Gender****; The age and gender of victims play a role in the selection process. Vulnerable demographics such as the elderly, children, teenagers and women often find themselves targeted by predators. It is crucial to educate oneself and loved ones about the associated risks. Take precautions.*
* ***Lack of Awareness****; Attackers tend to focus on individuals who demonstrate a lack of awareness. People who walk alone with headphones on to their surroundings unintentionally provide an advantage to attackers.*
* ***Isolation****; Individuals who find themselves alone in areas become targets for attackers. The absence of witnesses or potential intervention makes it easier for perpetrators to overpower their victims.*
* ***Physical Characteristics;*** *Attackers may single out individuals who're physically smaller in stature or less capable of defending themselves. Perceived physical disadvantage can make someone more attractive to predators.*
* ***Distraction****; People who appear preoccupied with their belongings—such, as rummaging through bags or constantly checking smartphones—can be targeted since they may be caught off guard.*
* ***Lack of Confidence;*** *People who display a lack of self assurance show body language. Hesitate may be seen as more vulnerable. Attackers are more likely to approach individuals they believe won't put up resistance.*
* ***Appearing Unassertive****; Individuals who avoid making eye contact find it difficult to say ""no "". Appear hesitant to assert themselves might be perceived as targets who are more likely to comply.*
* ***Preoccupation****; Those who visibly show signs of stress, distress or being lost in their thoughts are less likely to notice threats, around them.*
* ***Altered State of Mind;*** *Attackers may take advantage of individuals who're under the influence of alcohol, drugs or other substances since their judgment and reflexes could be impaired.*
* ***Patterns and Predictability****; Attackers often observe the routines and behaviors of victims. Individuals who consistently follow the route frequent the places or exhibit predictable behaviors become more susceptible targets.*
* ***Easy Access****; Attackers tend to target people positioned near entrances, exits or secluded areas where they can quickly grab and escape without arousing suspicion.*
* ***Lack of Self Defense Awareness;*** *Attackers prefer individuals who seem unfamiliar, with self defense techniques or demonstrate awareness of potential threats.Appearing confused or unsure of your surroundings can make you more vulnerable, to manipulation. Attackers often target individuals who are separated from their group as they are less likely to receive assistance.*
* ***Social Media;*** *Social media has provided predators with a platform for hunting. They use tactics like catfishing (creating profiles to gain trust) or studying victims through social media to target vulnerable individuals. It is important to be cautious about your interactions and think carefully before sharing information.*

**My Rules**

I  lived in New Orleans before Katrina, when it routinely led the nation in murders and often rivaled the worse cities in Mexico, Brazil, or South Africa.  Murders, muggings, carjackings, and home invasion robberies were FAR, FAR more common in the Big Sleazy than anywhere I traveled, including Cape Town, and here are the rules I developed then and followed during my travels.    

First, if you can travel in groups, do so.  Many veterans are great about this and they actually plan for it. 

Second, if you can't travel in a group maintain a high level of situational awareness.  Don't wear ear buds and don't drink too much if you have a long walk back to your hotel or apartment. 

Third, move like a man on a mission.  Walk fast and maintain good posture.  You will look like a tough confident guy.

Fourth, be careful about flaunting wealth.  Both the guy who got mugged and the kidnapping victim made this mistake.  In fairness, the kidnapping victim was pursued by an extremely sophisticated group of criminals.  But he had let them know he had money.

Fifth, do not get drawn into conversations with strangers in places where no one else is around.  This is often how criminals set up a mugging.

Beyond that, I USUALLY avoid cops like the plague overseas.  Most foreign cops are on the take and will want a bribe.  I managed to limit my bribes to a few cups of coffee, but it is best to avoid cops completely.

If you have to talk to a cop, pick the oldest one. Be super positive and super friendly.  It is not the time to criticize ANYTHING about his country, from the food to the drivers or even the weather.  Though I avoid cops when I have to speak to them, I turn on the charm, and you should, too.          

**Conclusions**

So, to answer to the OPs question, ""Could it be that lowlifes are actually afraid of these bros?"" No, these guys just appear to be more trouble than they are worth.  

Notice there was nothing in either my rules or the article that said much about actually being an actual badass.  If you have to break out your Kung Fu, you have really, really messed up, because if you hit someone overseas, there is an excellent chance you will end up in a foreign jail, and that is probably going to be worse than being a crime victim.

  Brody Devlin appeared on stage to take his eighth curtain call.  
  
  The applause swelled, redoubling in volume as it echoed off the walls of the huge old theater. Every person in the audience was on his feet. His most ardent fans were wild with enthusiasm. They wanted to cling to him, keep him within their field of vision, listen to his deep, mesmerizing voice speak any words that would continue to envelop them in the spell he had been weaving about them all evening.  
  
  Spellbinder.  
  
  The word jumped suddenly into Sacha’s mind. For two months she had been trying to analyze Brody Devlin’s power over audiences; now she realized there was no logical explanation. He was a phenomenon, an actor who exuded such power and presence, he quite simply hypnotized and charmed, changing impossibility into reality, the commonplace into high drama. Even in this light-weight revival of the musical Camelot his power was riveting.  
  
  Of course, his magnificent good looks were an asset that couldn’t be discounted. His role was demanding. He should have been exhausted now. But that didn’t seem to be the case. He stood center stage, and from where Sacha was watching in the tenth row, she felt as though she were absorbing some of the crackling energy he radiated. In the dark green velvet of his medieval costume he looked so stunning, one reviewer had said it was an accolade to his acting that he could make King Arthur believable as a cuckolded husband. Devlin’s shoulder-length hair was a deep chestnut color and his tall, broad-shouldered, slim-hipped physique conveyed an impression of tough yet magnetically appealing sexuality. The camera loved his face, but not because he had the features of an Adonis. His brilliant blue eyes were wide set and tilted up slightly at the corners, and his broad cheekbones and short nose were definitely irregular as was his long sensual mouth. Yet put them together, and they combined to create a face to fascinate and beguile. The face of a spellbinder.  
  
  But tonight those brilliant blue eyes seemed restless and the smile on his tanned face betrayed impatience. Sacha inhaled sharply as she recognized the sign for which she had been watching for the past week: There was an air of leashed tension about him. Tonight. It would be tonight.  
  
  Sacha turned to Louis. “Call your contact at the reception desk of his hotel,” she said in an urgent whisper, “and tell him it will be tonight. Probably within the next hour or so.”  
  
  Louis Benoit raised an inquiring brow. “You’re sure? Jason is a very greedy man. He will charge us even if you’re wrong.”  
  
  Sacha glanced back at the man on the stage. Devlin’s tension was growing. She could sense it even as the actor, masking it with a careless, charming smile, bowed and waved to the audience. “I’m sure. Hurry.”  
  
  Louis nodded and then moved rapidly past the other people in their row. He hurried up the aisle, trying to get ahead of the crowd, which would be converging on the exits as soon as Brody released them from his spell.  
  
  Devlin would not be persuaded to come back after this curtain call, Sacha thought. No matter how loudly people in the audience clamored for him to return, he wouldn’t. Sacha had studied him so closely for the last two months that she felt as if she knew his every thought. And tonight, she felt certain, he would tell Cass to make the arrangements.  
  
  Cold perspiration dampened her palms, and she wiped them on her jeans. It was unusual for her to be nervous, but now she was more frightened than the first time Gino had sent her out on the streets. She drew a deep breath and braced herself, deliberately trying to subdue the apprehension that could make a coward of her. She had learned a long time ago that worrying never accomplished anything. It was better just to make up your mind, do what you set out to do with as much verve and style as you were capable of, and keep smiling. By assuming a cheerful outlook you could sometimes fool even yourself into believing everything was all right.  
  
  She was only nervous now because tonight was terribly important to her and she had waited for such a long time for it. She would be fine as soon as she swung into action, she assured herself.  
  
  Devlin was leaving the stage. It was the signal for her to depart too. She snatched up her worn blue-jean jacket from the back of the seat and slipped it on, her gaze still clinging to Brody Devlin as he strode gracefully toward the wings.  
  
  As soon as he disappeared from view she started to move toward the aisle, excusing herself to the beautifully dressed patrons who were still applauding loudly, hoping for Devlin to appear again. She was scarcely aware of the condescending and surprised looks her faded jeans and scuffed loafers received. She was too intent on getting out and catching a taxi to take her to the hotel to worry about how she looked. Not that she would have worried anyway. You wore what you had the money to buy, and then, if anyone looked down his nose at you, you found a way to tweak that nose—again with the utmost style.  
  
  Sacha hurried out of the theater and took a deep breath. The fresh air was invigorating after the perfumed closeness of the auditorium and, she noted, surprisingly cool for March in San Diego.  
  
  Damn, she didn’t have much money left after buying those tickets tonight, and it was only a few blocks to the hotel. Maybe, if she hurried, she could walk it and still … No, she couldn’t take the chance. Tonight was too important. She jumped into the first waiting taxi in the zone in front of the theater and leaned forward to speak to the driver. “Ventura Hotel. Hurry, please.”  
  
  Brody was unbuttoning his emerald velvet doublet even as he reached the wings. He accepted the hot drink Joel Morton, the stagehand, held out to him and swallowed it in three swift gulps. Damn, he hated hot lemon juice. He would be glad to have this tour over so that he didn’t have to go through the motions of pampering his non-existent singing voice. Then he could relax and—  
  
  And what? Lie on the beach at Malibu and vegetate? Better hot juice and road tours like this than the boredom that besieged him when he wasn’t working at all. He handed the glass back to the stagehand. “I want to see Cass,” he said curtly as he turned and strode down the hall to his dressing room.  
  
&nb  
sp; Joel Morton pursed his lips in a low whistle. Devlin’s notorious temper was obviously about to go on the rampage. It was completely out of character for him to be short with any member of the crew or with minor cast members. He usually saved his scathing sarcasm and glacier stares for the professionals in his own league. Well, Joel thought, it wasn’t his job to cope with Devlin’s displeasure. He’d deliver the summons to Cass Radison, Devlin’s manager, and let him try to calm down the actor.  
  
  Brody slammed the door of his dressing room, tersely dismissed his dresser, Chuck, shrugged out of the velvet doublet, and threw it on the top of the screen across the room. He sat down before the mirror and began taking off his stage makeup with swift, jerky movements.  
  
  There was a perfunctory knock on the door before Cass opened it and strolled into the dressing room. “A great performance, Brody.”  
  
  “How do you know? You never watch the show and you have a tin ear.” Brody threw a soiled tissue into the wastecan. “I was flat as hell in at least half my numbers tonight.”  
  
  “Strange, the audience didn’t seem to notice it,” Cass observed mildly. “You must have done something right.” He dropped down into the easy chair by the door. “Or maybe they just liked your costumes. You’ve got great legs in those tights.”  
  
  A reluctant smile tugged at Brody’s lips as he met Cass’s limpidly innocent brown-eyed gaze in the mirror. “Thanks, I can always count on you to pinpoint my more stellar qualities.” He stood up and began unbuttoning his white balloon-sleeved shirt. “Not that I displayed many tonight. I don’t know why I took this role. I stink.”  
  
  “That’s not what Time and People magazines said.”  
  
  “I can’t sing. The role has no dimension. I should have done Tempest at the Old Vic.”  
  
  “You did Shakespeare last year. You thought this would be a challenge.”  
  
  Brody pulled the tails of his shirt out of the loden-green tights. “Did I? I don’t remember.” He stripped the shirt off and tossed it beside the doublet over the screen. “I was wrong.” He went to the closet, found the street clothes his dresser had readied for him and tossed them on the chair before the dressing table. “Thank God this is the last week.”  
  
  “Have you read those film scripts I gave you?”  
  
  Brody nodded. “One has possibilities. I’ll let you know.”  
  
  Cass rose to his feet, his lanky body surprisingly graceful. “Hungry? I’ll call a car and we’ll find a decent restaurant. I feel like Chinese.”  
  
  Brody shook his head. “Not tonight.” He resumed undressing. “Call Marceline’s service and have them send someone to the hotel.”  
  
  There was no surprise in Cass’s face. He had been half expecting the order. He knew Brody was extremely highly sexed, and this request usually came at least once or twice in every town they played. “Same type as usual?”  
  
  Brody nodded.  
  
  “Right away.” Cass turned and opened the door. “Are you sure you don’t want to give our resident nymphomaniac, Guenevere, a try instead? She has all the requirements. She’s blond, stacked, and I understand she has a bedroom repertoire that would put any call girl to shame. I notice she’s done everything but crawl into your bed since she took over the lead in Saint Louis.”  
  
  “You’re behind the times.” Brody smiled cynically. “She did that in Denver.”  
  
  Cass looked mildly surprised. “Really? What did you do?”  
  
  “Tossed her out on her fanny. The last thing I need is an affair with a bitch like Naomi Marlow; that would really complete the idiocy of this tour.”  
  
  Cass nodded. No complications. It was the creed Brody lived by these days. Yet Brody was a very complicated man himself and that did breed more complexities. Catch-22. His father had been a much easier client to deal with when Cass had been his manager. Perhaps it was to be expected. Raymond Devlin had never been more than a fine character actor; Brody had reached superstardom when he was only twenty-five and had maintained that status for the last ten years. Brody had been offered every plum life had to offer and had tasted most of them. Cass supposed it was natural that the actor’s palate had become jaded. He was the darling of film and stage, acclaimed the greatest actor since Olivier, and had been chased by women in every country.  
  
  Through it all he had remained surprisingly levelheaded, and each success had only fanned the desire to better his next performance, increase his range, bring something new and fresh to each succeeding role. Still, Brody’s search for perfection didn’t make Cass’s job any easier. The actor could be demanding, single-minded, and scathing if he detected any lack of professionalism in the people surrounding him. Cass had no problem with that aspect of his character; it was balanced by a sense of fairness and the generosity to give whatever help was needed to reach the common goal of any production.  
  
  However, many people in the business didn’t share Cass’s view, and Brody’s ruthlessness had been as highly publicized as his many affairs. Well, that was their hang-up, Cass reasoned. He liked Brody as a man and respected him as an artist. He just wished to hell that the man would stop asking quite so much of himself and the people around him so they could all be more comfortable. Cass was getting too old for challenges. “I’ll call the service and tell them to have a woman in your suite when you get there.”  
  
  “Good.” Brody strode naked toward the bathroom door. “Thanks, Cass.”  
  
  “Just one of my wide array of services,” Cass said lightly. “One I’ve perfected over the years.”  
  
  Brody stopped with his hand on the doorknob to gaze curiously at his manager. “I’ve never asked you. Did you perform this particular service for my father too?”  
  
  Cass shook his head. “He preferred amateurs and wasn’t nearly as fastidious as you about complications.”  
  
  Brody’s lips twisted. “So I’ve heard.” He had scarcely known his father. He was the child of Raymond’s second marriage and had visited him rarely during his lifetime. Raymond Devlin had been divorced four times and been involved in innumerable well-publicized affairs before his death eight years before. “To each his own.”  
  
  Two minutes after the door closed behind Cass, Brody was under the shower. The warm water whipping against his body should have been soothing, but it failed to ease the tension knotting his muscles. Once he had reached this point, not even sex could totally relieve it. It was too raw and abrasive to yield to sleep or exercise, and he wasn’t stupid enough to use drugs or liquor. If he could just hold on until he got back to the hotel, the woman in the suite should help. He would sink into her body and take the edge off both his abstinence and this damn tension, which was almost always with him. He should have sent for a woman before this but he had felt an unaccountable reluctance. He thought it might have something to do with the boredom that had been gnawing at him for the past few years. Bored with sex? He must be getting old. No, his physical arousal was as strong as ever. It was the emptiness he felt afterward that bothered him.  
  
  Still, sex helped more than anything else to defeat his nemesis. The tension would return after the act, but it wouldn’t be this bad for a while. He would be fine as soon as he got to his suite and saw the woman.  
  
  He closed his eyes, thinking about the woman Marceline would send, and let the water pour over him. His instructions were always the same. The call girl must be blond, voluptuous, and versatile. She was given a key by the desk clerk and was always waiting naked in bed when he arrived at the suite.  
  
  The woman wasn’t blond, she wasn’t voluptuous, and she definitely wasn’t waiting naked in bed.  
  
  She was sitting fully dressed in the cane chair in the sitting room and jumped to her feet as soon as he opened the door. “Hello.” Her voice was breathless. “I’m Sacha Lorion. I’m very happy to meet you.”  
  
  The words held the faintest hint of an accent of some kind. French? Well, it didn’t matter. She was all wrong. What the hell could the service have been thinking of to send someone like this teenage Lolita to him? She looked about seventeen in those beat-up jeans and jacket, and she  
was staring at him with the fearless wide-eyed curiosity of a much younger child.  
  
  “I’m Brody Devlin and I’m afraid there’s been a mistake. You’re not what I wanted.”  
  
  “No?” She moistened her lips with her tongue. “You don’t like me?”  
  
  The accent was French, and her husky voice was vaguely erotic, Brody noted, stroking him like a whisper in the dark. Maybe … No, conversation was seldom required from his partners, and he would feel guilty as hell taking this big-eyed child to bed. “You’re too young,” he said gently.  
  
  “I’m twenty-one.”  
  
  He should have known Marceline’s service wouldn’t deal with children. Marceline’s women were all skilled professionals of the highest order. No doubt some of her customers preferred the kinky imagery of bedding a budding nymphet, but she would never risk supplying the actual goods. He closed the door behind him. “I’m sorry, you still won’t do.”  
  
  “You think I’m ugly? I know I’m not to everyone’s taste.” The question was asked with no coyness, only that same bold curiosity he had noted in her expression.  
  
  “No, you’re actually quite … attractive.” It wasn’t the right word, but her appeal was difficult to categorize. Her skin was truly magnificent, Brody thought, rose petals on velvet. Her ebony hair shone clean and healthy in the lamplight, falling to her shoulders and curving under in a simple page boy to frame high cheekbones, slightly pouty lips, and light blue eyes faintly uptilted at the corners. There was something vaguely familiar about those eyes, he thought absently. “I’m afraid you’re just not my type.”  
  
  She smiled and he inhaled sharply. Not attractive. Beautiful. Her face was suddenly illuminated from within by a warmth and vitality that was near incandescent. “Then of course, I won’t do at all,” she said cheerfully. “I’m sorry. There must have been a mix-up. Don’t worry, I’ll take care of everything.” She strode briskly toward the telephone on the desk in the far corner of the sitting room. “I’ll call Marceline’s right away and arrange for a replacement.” She paused with her hand on the receiver and glanced back over her shoulder. “At this time of night it may take an hour or so, but I will take good care of you until she gets here. Have you eaten yet?”

No, but—”  
  
  “Then I will cook you a fine meal.” She made a shooing motion with one hand as she picked up the receiver with the other. “Go to your bedroom and rest. I know you must be tired after your performance tonight. I’ll call you when the food is ready.”  
  
  Brody felt his lips twitching with amusement. “Do you always supply chef service to your customers?”  
  
  “But you are not my customer.” Sacha smiled sunnily. “You are a hungry man who has been badly treated by my employer. The least I can do is to see that you are fed and pampered un peu.”  
  
  “You’re French?”  
  
  She shook her head. “Hungarian mother, American father, but I grew up in Paris.” She made another shooing motion. “You go rest. All will be well, I promise you.”  
  
  Brody found himself meekly obeying her command. As the bedroom door closed behind him he took off his tan Windbreaker and tossed it on the bed. It was odd, but the tension and boredom gripping him had eased since he had entered the suite. The little Sacha had surprised and amused him, but he had definitely not been bored.  
  
  He sat down on the king-size bed and looked around in discontent. Why the devil had he let the woman banish him to the bedroom? He wasn’t tired. The energy was coursing through him as it usually did after a performance.  
  
  “Brody?” The door opened and Sacha’s gleaming, dark head poked around it. “I’m sorry, but I will need you in the kitchen. Those idiots in the hotel have stocked the refrigerator with only milk, eggs, cheese, and bacon.” Her face lit with a gamine grin. “But all is not lost. I found”—she paused dramaticaly— “mushrooms. We will have a magnificent quiche, if you will only dice the mushrooms while I brown the bacon.”  
  
  He rose swiftly to his feet, feeling as if he had been reprieved. “I think I can manage that.” He followed her to the small, gleaming kitchen, noticing she was taller than he had first thought. It must have been her slenderness that had created the illusion of lack of height. She had discarded her denim jacket, and he smothered a smile as he saw the pink T-shirt she wore had DISNEY WORLD printed on the back and a huge Donald Duck on the front. Lolita, indeed.  
  
  Then his amusement vanished as his gaze lingered on her small breasts, outlined with such loving detail by the T-shirt that it was evident she was wearing no bra. He had a sudden impulse to lift the shirt and cup her breasts in his hands. That creamy rose tinting her cheeks was very alluring, and the texture fantastic. Would her nipples be as velvety as—  
  
  “There will be a replacement here as soon as possible,” Sacha said. “Marceline’s manager apologizes profusely and hopes you will accept any small service I can do for you until she can make reparation.” She shot him a mischievous glance. “So you see, since she’s paying me, you must let me make you comfortable. I regard it as my duty, and I always do my duty.”  
  
  “Do you?” Annoyance as unreasonable as it was strong suddenly jabbed through him. His tone became caustic. “I bet you’re damn good at those duties too.”  
  
  Her smile faded, and he felt as if he’d slapped a child. “Sometimes. I try very hard.” She motioned to the red plastic and chrome chair beside the Formica table. “If you will sit down, I will get you the mushrooms.”  
  
  “Sacha …”  
  
  She glanced over her shoulder. “Yes?”  
  
  “I’m sorry.” The words came haltingly. “That was uncalled for. Sometimes I can be a complete bastard.”  
  
  She smiled. “Then we must work to correct that condition. Right?” She took a large bottle of mushrooms from the refrigerator, snatched up a cutting board from a hook on the wall and a paring knife from the drawer beneath the sink. She carried them to him and set the objects on the table. “If you do this job very well, I will consider it suitable penance.” She met his gaze steadily. “And you are not a bastard, Brody. I think you could be very difficult, but that is a different thing entirely.” She turned away, strode to the cabinet, and got down a mixing bowl. “Now, I must obviously feed you quickly. Probably hunger makes you bad-tempered.”  
  
  He wasn’t so sure. When he had thought of Sacha in bed with one of her nymphet-loving clients, he had experienced a surge of rage that had caught him off-guard. He found the image lingering distastefully even now. “Probably.” He opened the jar of mushrooms. “I see by your T-shirt that you were at Walt Disney World. When did you go?”  
  
  “A few weeks ago.” She was breaking eggs into the mixing bowl with economical efficiency. “I had a wonderful time. It’s truly a magic place. Have you ever been there?”  
  
  He shook his head. “We played Orlando last month, but I didn’t bother to go.”  
  
  “You should have. I know you don’t like crowds but—”  
  
  “How do you know that?” he asked idly.  
  
  She paused in the motion of breaking an egg. “I must have read it somewhere.” She cracked the shell. “I know people recognize you wherever you go, and that must bother you, but you can’t hide away when there are so many wonderful things to see.”  
  
  It had been a long time since he had experienced the eagerness he saw in her face. He suddenly felt terribly old and cynical. “I’ll see it next time.” His gaze went to the front of her shirt. “You like Donald Duck?”  
  
  She nodded decisively. “Oh, yes. He’s my favorite cartoon character, but I had trouble finding a shirt with his picture. Everything was Mickey Mouse. The salesgirl at the shop told me he was more popular.” She scowled. “Bah! Who would like a meek, bland character like Mickey over Donald Duck?”  
  
  Bah? He didn’t think he’d ever heard the expression outside of vintage movies, yet he found the word entirely natural and even charming coming from Sacha’s lips. “Since Donald is irascible, crafty, vengeful, and underhanded, I could imagine a few misguided souls who might prefer Mickey.”  
  
  “But he can also be affectionate and rather sweet, and it’s no wonder he behaves badly when he’s persecuted by those dreadful chipmunks. I feel quite sorry for him. He can’t help it if he’s difficult.”  
  
  He chuckled. “You seem to make it a habit of forgiving difficult types. Not that I put myself in the same elite class as Donald.”  
  
  She wrinkled her nose as she glanced at him over her shoulder. “It isn’t kind of you to laugh at me. I’m entirely sincere. I can’t help it if I’ve always found difficult people more worthwhile in the long run.”  
  
  “Are you flattering me, Sacha?”  
  
  “Bah! I do not flatter. If I can’t be honest, I do not speak at all.” She paused. “Well, that’s not exactly true. But if I lie, there’s always a good reason.”  
  
  The smile of amusement lingered on his lips. “I see.”  
  
  “Are those mushrooms ready? You’re being very slow.”  
  
  “Sorry. I’ll try to do better.” He looked up. “In my job I don’t get much practice at cooking.”  
  
  “That’s no excuse. In my job I don’t either.”  
  
  Another flash of burning irritation surprised him as a vividly obscene picture flashed through his mind. What the devil was wrong with him? She was a high-priced hooker who was obviously content with her profession. Why should he care who she slept with after she left him tonight? “Maybe you have an affinity for it,” he said curtly, pushing the cutting board away. “I don’t think I’m hungry after all. You eat the quiche when you’ve finished and then run along.”  
  
  She turned to face him, her expression clouding. “What did I do wrong? I was enjoying myself, and I thought you were too. I thought we were being very … companionable.”  
  
  He felt a flicker of remorse. It wasn’t her fault he was being pricked by these weird emotions. “You didn’t do anything wrong. And we were being very companionable.”  
  
  “Then what …?” She trailed off, looking at him pensively. “I know what it is. You didn’t like it that I criticized you.” Her expression softened. “I didn’t mean to hurt you. I had no idea you were so sensitive. I will be careful not to do it again. You will stay?”  
  
  He was having trouble tearing his gaze away from her pleading face. It  
was getting out of hand. He couldn’t remember ever responding to a woman on the multitude of levels he was to Sacha. Surprise, amusement, tenderness, and the burning possessiveness that had been bothering him whenever he thought of Sacha in bed with another man. Jealousy. Talk about dog in the manger. He couldn’t desire this big-eyed street urchin.  
  
  Or could he? His body’s arousal testified that he most definitely did want her, and the idea began to intrigue him. She was certainly different, and his reaction to her had been … unusual. Bedding her would undoubtedly be a change of pace and might lessen his boredom as well as that damn tension. He would have to think about it.  
  
  He sat back down and picked up the paring knife. “I’ll stay.” He smiled mockingly. “As long as you remember what a delicate, sensitive person I am behind this hard facade. Just like Donald Duck.”  
  
  She looked a little uncertain before she nodded briskly. “I’ll remember.” She turned away. “And now I’ll tell you all about Epcot, which will cause you to gnash your teeth with envy.”  
  
  “When I was a little girl, I always wanted to go to an amusement park but I never—” Sacha glanced up from her plate, her fork poised in midair. “Why are you looking at me like that?”  
  
  “Like what?” Brody asked, leaning back in his chair and gazing at her innocently. “I was just thinking that you bake an excellent quiche.”  
  
  She made a face. “And you were thinking, ‘what a chatterbox she is’. I’ve talked your ear off for the last hour, and I’ve scarcely let you eat a bite. No wonder you look so hungry.” She pointed to the half-eaten quiche on his plate. “Mangez. I will be still as a mouse.”  
  
  “Mickey Mouse?”  
  
  She shook her head. “He talks too much. Maybe the mouse that ran up the clock.”  
  
  “You’re well versed in your nursery rhymes.”  
  
  “I used to tell them to the other children at the—” She broke off. “If I’m the mouse, then the way you are looking at me is definitely feline. What are you thinking?”  
  
  He considered telling her that he had been imagining her lying naked on her back on the king-size bed down the hall, her thighs thrown open as he moved between them. He’d been having similar erotic visions all through the meal and found himself enjoying the anticipation of the act to come almost as much as he usually did the climax with any other woman. He decided he would stretch his anticipation just a little longer before he took Sacha to bed.  
  
  Besides, there was no hurry. He was enjoying their dinner on another level. Her conversation had been both relaxing and amusing, and he had found her bright, witty, and glowing with an enthusiasm that was very refreshing. “I was thinking I’d like another cup of coffee.”  
  
  She raised a skeptical brow but stood up and crossed the room to the coffeemaker on a cabinet.  
  
  She had an intriguingly pert bottom, Brody thought appreciatively, and the jeans molded it quite satisfactorily. He would like to mold it himself, run his palm over that delicious curve, feel the muscles flex at his touch. Perhaps he would have her bend down and—  
  
  She was coming back to him, setting the cup before him with a bright smile. “Coffee. Now you must finish the quiche.”  
  
  His hand closed on her wrist. It was time to end it. The muscles of his stomach were knotting, his groin swelling and aching. If he didn’t get her into the bedroom soon, he’d be taking her on this kitchen chair. “Call Marceline’s.”  
  
  Her eyes widened in surprise. “But I told you that I already called her.”  
  
  He swiveled around on the chair so that she was between his legs. She smelled of clean soap and something sweetly floral, and her skin was even more velvety up close. His hand on her wrist was trembling, he noticed in amazement. He tightened his grip until he could feel the birdlike fragility of bone beneath the soft skin. His thumb slowly stroked the inside of her wrist, feeling the pulse leap beneath his touch. “Call her back. Tell her I’ve changed my mind.”  
  
  She seemed to be holding her breath. “You don’t want a woman?”  
  
  He lifted her wrist to his lips and his tongue licked delicately at the tracery of blue veins beneath the thin skin. “I didn’t say that. I just decided I’d like to try something different.”  
  
  She was staring at him dumbfounded. “Different?”  
  
  His knees closed, holding her captive. He could feel the warmth of her beneath the layers of material separating them. To hell with going to the bedroom. “You,” he said thickly. “Take off that damn Donald Duck shirt. I don’t want him looking at me accusingly when I—”  
  
  “You want me?” Her voice was not only stunned, it was panic-stricken. “But you can’t, that’s not possible. You only like blondes.”  
  
  His hand released her wrist and traveled around to cup the curve of her bottom. It felt as good as he had thought it would. “I don’t want to get into a rut.” His eyes twinkled. “Not that I’m unalterably opposed to that state. There are ruts and then there are ruts.”  
  
  “I’m too thin. And I have very small breasts.”  
  
  “Yes, and you have a fantastic derriere.” He leaned forward, his open lips nuzzling her nipple through the T-shirt.  
  
  “No!” Her hands were on his shoulders, attempting to push away from him. “You aren’t supposed to …” She backed away from him, her face aflame. “You can’t do this.”  
  
  “Try me.” He stood up. “If there’s a problem about the other woman they’re sending, tell Marceline I’ll pay for both of you.” He inched even closer. “She won’t mind.”  
  
  “You don’t understand.” Her hands went to her hot cheeks. “It wasn’t supposed to be this way. I’m not the sort of woman you want. This is most disconcerting.”  
  
  He frowned. “Why? This is why you came here, so don’t start playing silly games.”  
  
  “No games.” One hand ran distractedly through the sleekness of her hair. “I don’t know what to do.”  
  
  “Well, I do. First, we take off Donald Duck. Then we sit down, and I—”  
  
  “No, it’s impossible. You don’t understand.”  
  
  His smile faded. “You keep saying that,” he said with soft menace. “What I do understand is that I’ve decided I want you, and you’re acting like a damn whimpering virgin. I also understand that I’m getting mad as hell. Is there anything else I should understand?”  
  
  “Yes.” She sighed resignedly. “One more thing.”  
  
  “Would you care to enlighten me as to what that is?”  
  
  “I’m your sister.”  
  
  Two  
  
  He went still. “Would you mind repeating that?”  
  
  “I’m your sister.” She hurried on. “Your half sister, actually, but it’s the same thing. We had the same father.” He was gazing at her blankly. Oh damn, she hadn’t wanted to tell him so soon. She had known he would react like this. “So you can see why I can’t go to bed with you. It would be incest. Not that I would have gone to bed with you anyway. That wasn’t what I had in mind at all. How was I to know you’d behave so out of character? I’m not the type of person you usually—”  
  
  “Hold it.” He held up his hand to stem the flow of words. “Stop right there. What the hell are you doing here if you had no intention of going to bed with me?”  
  
  “That’s not the question you should be asking,” she said reprovingly. “I’ve just told you I’m your sister. That’s far more important.”  
  
  “You’ll forgive me if I disagree,” he said caustically. “You’re not my sister, and at the moment, the fact you’re not going to bed with me is as important as hell. I’m hurting, dammit.”  
  
  Quick concern showed in her expression. “Are you? I’m sorry, I never planned on this happening, and I’m afraid Louis has already sent the woman Cass arranged for away. Perhaps we could call Marceline’s and have them send her back.”  
  
  “Louis?”  
  
  “My friend, Louis Benoit. You will like Louis. He thinks you’re the finest actor in the Western Hemisphere.”  
  
  “How nice. And is ‘friend’ a euphemism for pimp?”  
  
  “No, I can see you’re still c  
onfused about all this. I am no poule. It was just a pretense so we could get to know each other.” She smiled tentatively. “I didn’t realize when I first came to this country how superstars like you are guarded. I tried everything I could think of to arrange a meeting. I wrote to your manager and to the publicity department, even to your private secretary. No one would even let me speak to you on the phone. The hotel reception desks won’t even ring your room unless you tell them you’re expecting a call. It was very discouraging.” His expression remained both skeptical and suspicious, and Sacha sighed. “You’re going to be difficult about this, aren’t you?”  
  
  “Why not?” His brilliant blue eyes narrowed on her face. “You told me you like difficult men.” He turned, walked back to his chair, and sat down. “And I’m about to demonstrate just how difficult I can be.”  
  
  “You’re angry?”  
  
  “You’re damn right. I don’t like my privacy invaded. I don’t like the idea of being a target for a confidence game and I don’t like to be teased by a hooker who has no intention of delivering.”  
  
  She studied him shrewdly. “I think it’s the last that’s bothering you the most. I told you I was sorry Louis has sent the blonde away.” She came forward to stand before him. “But it’s done now, and you must accept it. Forget about sex. We must talk.”  
  
  “Forget about …” Indignation, outrage, and incredulity conflicted in his expression. Then, to her infinite relief, they were all superseded by amusement. “Maybe you’re not a hooker after all. If you were, you’d know that sex isn’t something that you can forget easily.”  
  
  “Ah, now you’re behaving sensibly.” She smiled. “Of course, I’m not a hooker, nor a confidence woman. I’m your sister, and we’re going to become great friends.” She suddenly dropped to her knees before him and leaned back on her heels, gazing up at him earnestly. “That’s all I want from you, Brody. I know you find it very hard to trust people these days, but you can trust me.

His wife knew the whole time.,"I worked as a cook at a Taco Mayo. The pay wasn't great and I had a lot of debt. I started stealing from them.

It began small. I’d take a little money from the cash register when it was busy. Then I started taking food home, like big packs of ground beef or cheese. I told myself it was okay because they didn't pay me much.

My manager, let’s call him Ben, was a nice guy. He was married with kids. We worked a lot of late nights together and became good friends. Eventually, we started secretly dating. It was exciting and made the boring job feel fun. He knew I was broke, and I think he suspected I was stealing, but he never said anything.

Then, everything went wrong. His boss, the district manager, showed up for a surprise check. He looked at all the money records and inventory lists. He saw that stuff was missing, and he figured out it was probably me.

He called me into the back office. Ben was there, and he looked scared. The district manager said I was going to be fired and that they might even call the police. I totally panicked and started to cry.

But then Ben did something crazy. He lied for me. He told his boss, ""This is my fault. I've been taking the food for my family and messing up the numbers. She didn't do anything.""

The district manager was mad but he believed Ben because Ben was the manager. Ben got in trouble instead of me. After his boss left, I asked Ben why he did it. He said he really cared about me and couldn't let me get in trouble.

We kept dating for a little while after that, but I felt too guilty. I broke up with him, quit my job, and got a new one at a diner. I was sure that was the end of it.

A few weeks later, I got a text from a number I didn't know. It was Ben's wife. She wanted to talk. I was so nervous. I thought she was going to yell at me.

We met at a coffee shop. But she wasn't angry at all. She was very calm. She told me she knew about the affair the whole time. She had seen text messages and noticed Ben was working late a lot.

I was shocked. Then she told me why she never said anything. She said, ""For the last year, I've had a really bad medical problem. I had terrible, uncontrollable gas. It was embarrassing and I didn't want anyone to know. I didn't even want to be near my husband because I was so embarrassed.""

She said that when she found out Ben was seeing me, she was hurt, but also a little relieved. It meant he wasn't expecting her to be close to him while she was dealing with her problem. She was so embarrassed about her gas that she decided to ignore the affair until she could fix her health.

She even knew about the stealing because Ben had told her when he covered for me.

She finished by saying, ""I'm not mad at you. I'm finally getting better. Ben and I are working on our marriage. I just wanted you to know that your big secret wasn't really a secret. I was just hiding something I thought was much worse.""

I didn't know what to say. My whole life had felt like a secret, dramatic movie, but I was just a small part of her much weirder and more embarrassing story.

So that's my confession. I stole from Taco Mayo. My boss covered for me because we were dating. And his wife knew everything because she had really bad gas and didn't want anyone to find out. I don't steal anymore. And I never eat bean burritos.",1,1756879764.0,confessions,1,1.0,False

With Omni Bridge CLI, you can move any token from Base, Ethereum, or Solana → NEAR in minutes… for cents.

Here’s how 👇

1] 👉 Start with a token.
👉 For example, $VGAS (minted on Base).
👉 But it could be any ERC-20 (Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum) or even SPL (Solana).

2] Set up the basics:
👉 Install the Bridge CLI tool
👉 Connect your wallets (MetaMask + NEAR)
👉 Add your keys locally (securely)
👉 You’re now ready to bridge.

3] 👉 Step 1: Log your token.
This tells Omni Bridge, “Here’s the asset I want to bring over.”

👉 Step 2: Deploy it to NEAR.
Your ERC-20 gets mirrored as a NEP-141 token.
Think of it as your token’s NEAR-native twin.

👉 Step 3: Move your tokens.
Pick the amount → confirm → wait a few minutes.
Your balance updates in your NEAR wallet.

That’s it ✅

4] So, TL;DR:

👉 Any token from Base, Ethereum, or Solana → NEAR, fast + cheap.
👉 Ready to power apps, or even your own Virtual Chain.

I said a short prayer before turning my head towards the direction of the deafening screech. It was a bus that had lost two of its rear wheels on the left side. It was now cruising on four wheels. Two at the front, one on each side and two right rear wheels.

While most of my time is taken up by professional commitments, I do have free evenings and weekends, and I’d really appreciate some quality company during my stays.

I’m looking to connect with a open minded female for a purely platonic friendship, someone who enjoys good food, coffee, conversation, and just a relaxed social vibe. Absolutely no expectations beyond respectful, friendly meetups.

I fully respect your time and personal space, and I’m happy to offer reasonable compensation for your time and companionship, think of it more like a thankyou for being available and making my short stays more enjoyable.

A few quick notes:

-This is not romantic or physical in nature, just platonic socializing.

-I’m very respectful of boundaries and discretion, and I expect the same.

-Ideally looking for someone who’s confident, easygoing, and values honest, low-pressure interaction.

-Public meetups only (restaurants, cafes, etc.).

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Tennis Showdown: Aryna Sabalenka vs. Jessica Pegula – A US Open Clash of Power and Precision**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a Grand Slam showdown that’s less “tennis” and more “physics experiment.” On one side, we have **Aryna Sabalenka**, the 27-year-old Belarusian wrecking ball who’s served so aggressively, the U.S. Open courts are applying for a restraining order. On the other, **Jessica Pegula**, the fourth-seeded American hope, who’s playing with the consistency of a Swiss watch… if Swiss watches occasionally paused to gloat. Let’s break this down with the statistical rigor of a spreadsheet and the humor of a tennis ball bouncing off a clown’s nose.

### Parsing the Odds: Who’s the Favorite?

The bookmakers aren’t leaving room for suspense. Sabalenka is the overwhelming favorite, with decimal odds hovering around **1.32–1.36** (implying a **76–78% implied probability** of victory). Pegula, meanwhile, sits at **3.15–3.50** (a **29–31% chance**). These numbers scream “Sabalenka’s got this,” but let’s not let the math bore us. Imagine converting these odds into a metaphor: Sabalenka is the espresso shot, and Pegula is the decaf. Both are coffee, but only one will keep you awake at 4:30 AM IST during the match.

### Key Stats & News: Power vs. Precision

* **Sabalenka’s Edge**: The defending champion is hunting history, aiming to become the first woman since Serena Williams (2014) to defend a U.S. Open title. She’s a hard-court demon, with a **4-1 head-to-head** against Pegula on outdoor hard courts. Their most recent clash? A Cincinnati straight-sets romp where Sabalenka’s forehand looked like it was channeling a hurricane. Oh, and she’s coming off a **2024 U.S. Open title**, which is like showing up to a cookoff with a Michelin star in your back pocket.
* **Pegula’s Perks**: The 26-year-old American has been a Grand Slam stalwart, reaching the quarterfinals three years in a row without dropping a set in 2024. She just dispatched Barbora Krejcikova in straight sets, proving she’s got the

ZAIA
“I have some good news, Zaia. Sebastian will be so excited. Congratulations, you’re pregnant!” The
doctor’s words ring in my mind as I stare down at the test reports once again, as I leave the hospital.
“Sorry!” I say, as I avoid bumping into someone, my heart skipping a beat as I place a hand on my
stomach protectively, hurrying towards my awaiting car.
My driver, Ethan, is waiting beside the sleek black car and he opens the door for me, bowing his head.
“Thank you!” I say as I get in gracefully.
“Where to, ma’am?” he asks once he gets in the car. (*)
“Home,” I say, unable to suppress my smile, excitement bubbling through me.
This is actually happening. I’ve been trying for a baby for three years and finally…
finally, I am pregnant.
I want to shout it from the rooftop, tell everyone that yes! I’m pregnant with the heir to the pack! But I
contain my excitement. I need to tell Sebastian the good news first.
Sebastian is the Alpha of the Dark Hollow Falls pack. It is one of the largest packs on
the eastern side of the state.
However, with the large territory also comes the dangerous borders that roam with rogues, ready to
tear apart anyone who gets in their way.
Werewolves spend their entire lives searching and hoping to find their destined mates. As for me, I had
a crush on Bastien from the moment I had seen him when I
was eleven years old.
That crush never went away and when he turned out to be my fated mate, it had
been a dream come true and we had married.

He desperately wanted an heir, and which Alpha doesn’t? I had just turned eighteen
when I found him, but he was thirty one at the time. Many other alphas have sons.
who are already being trained to become the next alphas at his age.
“Make haste, Ethan, I have a lot to do today,” I say to the driver as I sit back against
the plush leather seat.
Reaching our large gated mansion, I step inside and head straight to the kitchen, my
stilettos echoing on the wooden floors. I will cook his favourite pudding and place
the reports underneath the plate!
“You may take the evening off, get some rest,” I say to the maid, Emma. “I’ll cook for
us tonight.”
“Oh, thank you, Luna!” she says, placing down the dish towel she had been holding.”
I am certain Alpha will absolutely be so happy if you make him his favourite dessert!
Not to mention he doesn’t like sweet things, but your pudding is something he can’t
resist!”
I can’t help but smile at her words. Yes, Sebastien doesn’t enjoy sweet things aside
from me and the cream pie that he loves.
My cheeks heat as I remember the first time he had told me that it’s now his second
favourite dessert, and in hopes of making his favourite dessert, I had asked him
what his favourite was. Only for him to smirk and reply; you.
I can’t help but smile from ear to ear, the elated feeling creating a pleasant buzz
around me as I get to work wanting everything to be perfect for his return.
Hours pass and when everything is almost ready, I change into something pretty and set up the dining
table with candles and the food.
“Almost 9pm…” he will be home soon.
With the troubles that have surrounded our borders, as well as having to run the
business, Sebastian often works until late into the night. But he would try to come
home by 9.30pm and continue working from home if necessary.
I sit down on the chair, watching the clock tick away, the sound loud in the room’s
silence.
Once again, I look down at my stomach, smiling softly as I await the return of my
mate.
Time passes slowly and soon 11 o’clock comes and goes, but I’m not deterred, maybe
I will reheat the food again….
I have just placed the reheated meals on the table when my head jerks up at the
sound of footsteps, making my heart thud at the sudden sound. I look toward the door excitedly.
Finally, he is home!
The front door shuts, and a familiar faint scent of my mate hits my nose.
I cast a swift glance at the clock on the wall. To my surprise, it’s past midnight.
I rush to the hall, the excitement of finally being able to tell him the good news
filling me. There he is, in the dimly lit hall. He still looks as handsome as ever.
Three and a half years on, he still makes my heart skip a beat whenever I see him.
He loosens his black tie, as he places his briefcase down, holding a few files in his
hands as well. His bright blue eyes look tired as they meet mine and I smile.
“Sebastian!” I rush over to him, wrapping my arms around his neck.
He catches me with one arm, but there’s no enthusiasm. He must have had a really
hard day. I don’t mind; I know how stressful things are at work lately.
Placing me back on the floor, he raises a brow as he looks down a
at me.
“Why are you awake at this time?” he asks me in his deep, rugged voice.
“I was waiting for you. I wanted to have dinner together. There’s something I wanted to tell you,” I
explain as I help him out of his jacket, brushing a piece of lint from hist white shirt that is no longer as
crisp as it was this morning.
“I’ve already eaten,” he replies, surprising me as heads towards the living room. “I have something to
tell you.”
“Ok, you go first,” I say as he drops onto the sofa, stretching his long legs, and resting
his arm on the back of the sofa.
I sit down beside him, knowing he would share something regarding the work.

However, there’s something off. There’s a coldness in he looks into mine.
Sebastian looks down at the file in his hands before he tosses it on the table, the
loud snap as it hits the table makes me jump.
“Read it.”
I take it uneasily and flip open the blank file, but the red words in bold print at the
top of the first page make my blood run cold.
‘DIVORCE AGREEMENT”
I gasp as I quickly scan the document. That feeling becomes worse. This is a divorce agreement with
our name on it… My entire body trembles as I look up at him, hurt.
and confused.
“W–why?” I manage to blurt out as I look at the man I love from the bottom of my
heart.
What went wrong?
“Annalise is back, and she’s rejoined the pack.”
I look up sharply. It’s suddenly hard to breathe.
“But I am your mate,” I whisper. How could he still care for Annalise? She was his
past. “We’ve been married for three years.”
“Our marriage was a mistake from the very beginning. Back then, my father
demanded that I marry my mate, but now I don’t want to be bound by the Goddess‘
arrangement. I don’t see the point of fated mates.”
My heart clenches. I look at his face, trying to understand what he’s thinking, but
there’s nothing that reveals his feelings and he has his walls up, blocking the mate
bond.

destined mate when he himself is proof that you don’t need your mate.”
Those words are worse than being stabbed a thousand times, and I can feel my eyes
prickle with tears, the agony my wolf is feeling consuming me.
Does he really think that is the truth? Annalise is my half–sister and although she
and Sebastian had dated, I know her truth, the real her that she hides behind her
pretty face and doe eyes.
“Annalise only approached you because you were an Alpha… Sebastian, she doesn’t
love you the way I do. She wants to be Luna-”
He kicks the solid oak coffee table, making me jump as it’s thrown over with a loud
crash, hitting the wooden floor with a deafening bang that makes the ornaments in
the glass cabinet shake.
“And what about you? You just want to be Luna, don’t you! You knew that Annalise
and I were in a relationship, yet you selfishly accepted the marriage anyway and betrayed your own
sister by taking her man! You lied to me. She’s told me
everything!” 5.
“No, that’s not true. Let me explain-”
“Don’t antagonise me, Zaia, you got what you wanted, you became my wife and Luna,
but that wasn’t enough for you. You forced Annalise from coming anywhere near
this pack because you knew once she returned, I would learn everything!”
Yes, I did want Annalise to leave, but I never made her leave. She left of her own
accord once she learned Sebastian had found his mate, but now, it’s almost as if she
has been planning her return all this time.
Is she really enough to come between what we have? Sadly, I look into his eyes, realising he never
trusted me. He’s now judging and calculating everything I gave. him with suspicion, as if I had played
him to gain the position of Luna.
+15 BONUS
Doesn’t he realise I fell for him before I even knew he was an Alpha? Has he always been wary of me?
That one person can come between us and ruin it all? Did he even
for a moment, truly love me wholeheartedly?
I can’t understand it. Tell me Bastian… If you didn’t want me, then why did you make
love to me? Why did you touch me like I was the only woman who mattered to you?
Taking a deep breath, I ask him the decisive question. “Sebastian… Tell me, if it
wasn’t your father’s request-”
“Then I would have rejected you, and even now, I will, for Annalise.”
My lips quiver, remembering how my father hadn’t been happy with me marrying him. He never liked
Sebastian’s family, yet I had given it all up for him.
My family… my inheritance and my position, but it was clearly not enough for him.
If he’s able to cast me aside so easily, then what is my use?
He exhales as if I’m an irritating child and takes out a lighter and cigarette.
“Sign the papers soon. I don’t want this to drag out,” he says.
I stare down at the file as a single tear splashes onto the
“What did you want to tell me?” he asks.
papers.
“It’s no longer important… forget about it,” I say, thinking he will never see the
papers that currently sit on the dining room table.
“If you have any concerns regarding the alimony, let me know. Your expenses will
be covered and you are welcome to stay in the pack.”
That hurts.
“No… there’s no need. Everything is fine as it is. I will sign and have these returned. to you
immediately,” I reply as I stand up, trying to hold myself together when my entire world has come
crashing down around me.
He pauses for a second and simply nods, uncaring about my heartbreak and that I know he can feel
through the bond. Could he really cast me, his own mate, aside for another woman?
agony
The answer is in front of me, and although it is painful, the truth is yes, yes, he could.
“You may remain here for tonight. It’s late anyway. Annalise won’t move in until
everything is settled. I don’t want her to feel uncomfortable.”
I stare up into his handsome face, trying to recognise the man I fell for.
I smile bitterly and nod at him.
“Don’t worry, I’ll be gone. Say hi to Annalise for me.”

1n76sp4,https://www.reddit.com/r/asheville/comments/1n76sp4/rapessex_trafficking_and_cartels/,Rapes/sex trafficking and cartels.,"There have been 4 reported rapes around Asheville in the last week alone. There is probably 3 or 4 times that which hadmt been reported.  They are doing it and extorting their families.   The homeless guy everyone laughs at seems to know a lot about the situation. Maybe instead of laughing at him you should probably talk to him over a cup of coffee.  Be safe and know that the police won't do anything while you are getting raped they will obviously wait until you report it if you are alive then.  Like wtf.  Wtf is the fuking deal.  For gods sakes people talk to the damn homeless guy. If you see him looking traumatized it's probably because he just witnessed another one. They may do it around him or they may just be keeping everyones attention on him.  But don't be a snitch right.....

  The morning Tony Lucia killed Angelo Coluzzi, he was late to feed his pigeons. As long as Tony had kept pigeons, which was for almost all of his seventy-nine years, he had never been late to feed them, and they began complaining the moment he opened the screen door. Deserting their perches, cawing and cooing, they flew agitated around the cages, their wings pounding against the chicken wire, setting into motion the air in the tiny city loft. It didn’t help that the morning had dawned clear and that March blew hard outside. The birds itched to fly.  
  
  Tony waved his wrinkled hand to settle them, but his heart wasn’t in it. They had a right to their bad manners, and he was a tolerant man. It was okay with him if the birds did only one thing, which was to fly home. They were homers, thirty-seven of them, and it wasn’t an easy job they had, to travel to a place they’d never been, a distance in some races of three hundred or four hundred miles, then to navigate their return through skies they’d never flown, over city and country they’d never seen and couldn’t possibly know, to flap their way home to a tiny speck in the middle of South Philadelphia, all without even stopping to congratulate themselves for this incredible feat, one that man couldn’t even explain, much less accomplish.  
  
  There were so many mistakes a bird could make. Circling too long, as if it were a joyride or a training toss. Getting distracted on the way, buffeted by sudden bad weather, or worse, simply getting tired and disoriented—thousands of things could result in the loss of a precious bird. Even once the first bird had made it home, the race wasn’t won. Many races had been lost by the bird who wouldn’t trap fast enough; the one who was first to reach his loft but who stopped on the roof, dawdling on his way to the trap, so that his leg band couldn’t be slipped off and clocked in before another man’s bird.  
  
  But Tony’s birds trapped fast. He bred them for speed, intelligence, and bravery, through six and even seven generations, and over time the birds had become his life. It wasn’t a life for the impatient. It took years, even decades, for Tony to see the results of his breeding choices, and it wasn’t until recently that his South Philly loft had attained the best record in his pigeon-racing club.  
  
  Suddenly the screen door banged open, blown by a gust of wind, startling Tony and frightening the birds in the first large cage. They took panicky wing, seventeen of them, all white as Communion wafers, transforming their cage into a snowy blizzard of whirring and beating, squawking and calling. Pinfeathers flurried and snagged on the chicken wire. Tony hurried to the loft door, silently reprimanding himself for being so careless. Normally he would have latched the screen behind him—the old door had bowed in the middle, warped with the rain, and wouldn’t stay shut without the latch—but this morning, Tony’s mind had been on Angelo Coluzzi.  
  
  The white pigeons finally took their perches, which were small plywood boxes lining the walls, but in their panic they had displaced each other, violating customary territories and upsetting altogether the pecking order, which led to a final round of fussing. “Mi dispiace,” Tony whispered to the white birds. I’m sorry, in Italian. Though Tony understood English, he preferred Italian. As did his birds, to his mind.  
  
  He gazed at the white pigeons, really doves, which he found so beautiful. Large and healthy, the hue of their feathers so pure Tony marveled that only God could make this color. Their pearliness contrasted with the inky roundness of their eye, which looked black but in fact was  
the deepest of reds, blood-rich. Tony even liked their funny bird-feet, with the flaky red scales and the toe in back with a talon as black as their eyes pretended to be. And he kidded himself into thinking that the doves behaved better than the other birds. More civilized, they seemed aware of how special they were.  
  
  The secret reason for the doves’ special status was that they were beloved of his son, who had finally stopped Tony from releasing them at weddings for a hundred fifty dollars a pop. Tony had thought it made a good side business; why not make some money to pay for the seed and medicines, plus keep the birds in shape during the off-season? And it made Tony happy to see the brides, whose hearts lifted at the flock of doves taking off outside the church, since you couldn’t throw rice anymore. It reminded his heart of his own wedding day, less grand than theirs, though such things didn’t matter when it came to love.  
  
  But his son had hated the whole idea. They’re not trained monkeys, Frank had said. They’re athletes.  
  
  So Tony had relented. “Mi dispiace,” he whispered again, this time to his son. But Tony couldn’t think about Frank now. It would hurt too much, and he had birds to feed.  
  
  He shuffled down the skinny aisle, and his old sneakers, their soles worn flat, made a swishing sound on the whitewash of the plywood floor. The floor had held up okay, unlike the screen door; Tony had built the loft himself when he first came to America from Abruzzo, sixty years ago. The loft measured thirty feet long, with the single door in the middle opening onto a skinny aisle that ran the short length of the building. It occupied all of Tony’s backyard, as if the loft and yard were nesting boxes. Off the aisle of the loft were three large chicken wire cages lined with box perches. The aisle ended in a crammed feed room, the seed kept safe from rats in a trash can, and there was a bookshelf holding antibiotics, lice sprays, vitamins, and other supplies, all labels out, in clean white shelves.  
  
  Tony prided himself on the neatness of his loft. He dusted the sills, cleaned the windows with the bright blue Windex, and scraped the floor of the cages twice a day, not once. It was important to the health of his birds. He whitewashed the loft interior each spring, before the old bird season; he had done it last week, experiencing a familiar pang—the chalky smell of the whitewash and its brightness reminded him of the white liquid shoe polish he used to paint over the scuffs on Frank’s baby shoes, when his son had started to walk. Tony remembered the shoe polish—they didn’t make it anymore—he would paint it on the stiff baby shoes with the cotton they gave you, stuck on a stick inside the cap like a white ball of dandelion seeds. Even though it dripped it worked okay.  
  
  Tony shook his head, thinking of it now, the chalky smell filling his nose like the fragrance of a rose. The bottle of polish had a blue paper label and a little circle picture of a blond-haired, blue-eyed baby who didn’t look anything like baby Frank, with his jet black curls and his big brown eyes. Somehow Tony had the idea that if he painted the watery polish on Frank’s baby shoes, his son would look like all the American babies and one day come to be one, even though Frank had the black hair and no mother. And when it actually happened and Frank grew up to take his place in this country, Tony was just superstitious enough to think that maybe it was the shoe polish.  
  
  Tony had to stop thinking about his son, though he couldn’t help it, not this morning, of all mornings, and he tried to concentrate on the first cage of doves, appraising with failing eyes their condition. The doves were settling down, roosting again, and they looked good, no big fights during the night. Tony worried about the fights; the birds were territorial and always bickering about something, and the white birds bruised easily. He wanted them to look especially nice and stay healthy. For Frank.  
  
  Tony shuffled down the aisle to the second and third cages, which held the multicolored birds, mostly Meulemans with their reddish-brown feathers, and Janssens. There were other breeds in shades of gray and brown, and the common slateys; a slate gray, their eyes generally the same dark brown. Tony liked the nonwhite breeds, too, the ordinariness of their plumage reminding him of himself; he wasn’t a flashy man, not a braggadocio. He didn’t have the strut that some men had, going about like cocks. It had been his ruin, but now that he was old, it didn’t matter anymore. It had stopped mattering a long time ago. Sixty years, to be exact.  
  
  His thoughts elsewhere, Tony watched the Janssens cooing and stirring without really seeing them. The breed name came from the Janssen family who had bred them, and the other names from the other families who had bred them; Tony had always dreamed that his family would produce its own strain of birds, but he wouldn’t name it after himself. He knew who he would name it after, but he didn’t get the chance. Many of the best breed stock came from Belgium and France. Italian pigeons also made good racers, but Tony wouldn’t have much to do with them, especially the so-called Mussolini birds. Anybody who had lived during Mussolini wouldn’t want anything to do with a Mussolini bird. Chi ha poca vergogna, tutto il mondo è suo. He who is without shame, all the world is his. Mussolini birds!  
  
  Tony was an old man with old memories. He wished he could spit on the loft floor, but he didn’t want to dirty it. Instead he stood trembling until the anger left him, except for the bitterness in his mouth. Shaken, he idly inspected the Meulemans, and they seemed fine, too. Only Tony had had the terrible morning. An awful morning; the worst he’d had in a long time, but not the worst he’d had in his life. The worst he’d had in his life was sixty years ago. That morning then, and this morning now. Today. Tony had thought he would feel better after, but he didn’t. He felt worse; he had committed an act against God. He knew that his judgment would come in heaven, and he would accept it.  
  
  His thoughts were interrupted by the Meulemans, cooing loudly, wanting to be fed, and his dark eyes went, as always, to his favorite bird of all, a Meuleman he had named The Old Man. The Old Man and Tony went back eighteen years; The Old Man was the oldest of Tony’s pigeons, and to look at him, Tony wasn’t sure who was the Old Man, him or the bird. The Old Man roosted peacefully in his corner perch in the second cage, his strong head held characteristically erect, his eyes clear and alert, and his broad breast a still robust curve covering his feet. Tony remembered the day the chick hatched, an otherwise typical slatey, apparently unremarkable at birth except for his eye sign. Eye sign, or the look in a pigeon’s eye, spoke to Tony, and The Old Man’s eyes told Tony that the bird would be fast and smart. And he had been the best, in his day.  
  
  “Come sta?” Tony asked The Old Man. How are you? But The Old Man knew exactly what he meant, and it wasn’t, “How are you?”  
  
  The Old Man regarded the old man for a long time then. Tony couldn’t help but feel that the old bird knew what he had done that morning, what had been so important as to keep Tony from feeding his birds on time. The Old Man knew why Tony had to do what he had done, even after all this time. And Tony knew that The Old Man approved.  
  
  It was then that Tony heard cars pulling up outside his house and in the alley right behind the loft, on the other side of the cinderblock wall. There was the slamming of heavy car doors, and Tony knew that they were police cars.  
  
  He had been expecting them.  
  
  But the birds startled at the sudden sound, taking flight in their cages, and even though Tony knew that the police were coming, he felt the hair rise on the back of his neck, as it used to so long ago. He froze beside the cages as the police shouted English words he didn’t bother to translate, though he could, then they broke down the old wood door in the backyard wall, one, two, three pushes and it splintered and gave way to their shoulders and they burst into his yard, trampling his basil and tomatoes.  
  
  They were coming for him.  
  
  Tony didn’t run from them, he wouldn’t have anyway, but he remembered he had yet to feed his birds. He would have to hurry to finish before the police took him away. He shuffled to the feed room even as he caught sight of the police drawing their black guns silently, pointing instructions to each other, and two of them sneaking to the back door of his house  
like the cowards they were, little men hiding behind black shirts and shiny badges.  
  
  Tony’s gut churned with bile, and it struck him with astonishment that the deepest hate could rage like a fire for so many years, never burning itself up.  
  
  Dwelling with perfect comfort alongside the deepest love.  
  
  2  
  
  “Come on, it’s lunchtime! Let’s go,” Judy Carrier heard the other associates saying as they grabbed their light coats and bags. It was the first day of real warmth after a long winter, and evidently spring fever struck lawyers, too. Everybody at the Philadelphia law firm of Rosato & Associates, except Judy, was escaping. She remained at her desk trying to draft an antitrust article, though the sun obliterated the legal citations on her computer screen and the chatter in the hall kept distracting her. It was hard to work when you were eavesdropping.

 Suddenly Anne Murphy, who called herself only Murphy, popped her head in Judy’s open doorway. She was one of the new associates, her lipsticked lips expertly lined and her dark hair tied back into its typically fashionable knot. “You wanna go to lunch?” she asked.  
  
  “No thanks,” Judy answered. She usually gave others the benefit of the doubt, but she was hard-pressed to respect women who drew lines around their lips, like coloring books. Judy wore no makeup herself, and a daily shower was her idea of fashionable. “I ate already.”  
  
  “So what? Come on, you haven’t taken lunch in weeks.” Murphy smiled in a friendly way, though Judy suspected it was the lipliner. “It’s gorgeous out. Walk around with us.”  
  
  “Can’t, thanks. Got an article to do, on the Simmons case.”  
  
  “You can’t even take a walk? It’s Friday, for God’s sake.”  
  
  “No time for a walk. I really can’t,” Judy said, knowing that the walk part was bullshit. Murphy didn’t walk, she shopped, and shopping made Judy want to kill indiscriminately. What was the matter with these baby lawyers? Judy didn’t like any of them. Graduates of the Ally McBeal School of Law, they thought being a lawyer meant wearing skirts that met the legal definition of indecent exposure. They weren’t serious about the law, which is the only thing Judy was serious about. She thought of them as Murphy’s Lawyers.  
  
  “Oh. Okay. Well, don’t work too hard.” Murphy gave the white molding a good-bye pat and wisely disappeared, and Judy listened to the familiar sounds of the office emptying out, the gossip trailing off toward the elevator banks. The elevator cabs chimed as they left, bearing lawyers into the sun. Rosato & Associates was a small firm, only nine women lawyers and support staff, and for the next hour or so, whatever telephone calls the receptionist didn’t answer would be forwarded to voicemail. E-mail would go unopened, and faxes would wait in gray plastic trays. The office fell silent except for the occasional ringing of telephones, and Judy felt her whole body relax into the midday lull that was a long, deep breath before the afternoon’s business began.  
  
  She knew she was supposed to feel lonely, but she didn’t. She liked being on her own. She sipped coffee from a Styrofoam cup amid federal casebooks, stacks of printed cases, scribbled notes, and correspondence that covered her wooden desk and the desk return on her right. Her office was small, standard issue for mid-level associates at Rosato, but the clutter reduced it to a shoebox. Judy didn’t mind. She didn’t think of her office as messy, she thought of it as full, and felt very cozy surrounded by all her stuff. Nobody needed a nest more than a lawyer.  
  
  Papers, memos, law school texts, novels, and copies of the federal civil and criminal rules filled the bookshelves across from her and the shelves behind her, under the window. Three large file cabinets sat flush against the side wall, their fake-wood counter hidden by twenty thick accordion files from Moltex v. Huartzer, a massive antitrust case, which was redundant. A tower of potential trial exhibits at the end cabinet threatened daily to topple. Blanketing the walls were dog, horse, and family photos, certificates of court admission and awards Judy had received as law review editor and class salutatorian, and diplomas from Stanford University and Boalt Law School. Judy was the firm’s true legal scholar, so her office, while a mess, was a highly scholarly mess.  
  
  And her friend Mary wasn’t around to nag her about it. Mary DiNunzio had worked with Judy since they had graduated from law school, but she was taking time off from work after their last murder case; since then Judy’s nest hadn’t felt much like home. She took a reflective sip of coffee, eased back in an ergonomically correct chair whose cushions stabbed her in the back and shoulders, and crossed her legs, which were strong and shapely but completely bare. In Judy’s view, pantyhose was for Republicans, and now that Mary wasn’t here, she was getting away with that, too. Judy and Mary disagreed about practically everything, including Murphy’s use of lipliner.  
  
  On impulse, Judy pulled open her middle drawer and shuffled through ballpoint pens, parti-colored plastic paper clips, and loose change until she found a red pencil she used to edit briefs; then she dug again in the drawer for the mirror Mary had given her. Judy usually used the mirror to check for poppy seeds between her teeth, but now, her red pencil poised, she appraised herself in its large square:  
  
  Looking back at her from the mirror was a broad-shouldered young woman whose bright blue dress, yellow T-shirt, and artsy silver earrings made her look out of place against the legal books. Her hair was naturally blond, almost crayon yellow, and hacked off in a straight line at her chin; her face was big and round, reminding her always of a full moon, and her eyes were large and bright blue, as unmade-up as her lips. Her light eyelashes were mascaraless, her nose short and bobbed. An old boyfriend used to tell her she was beautiful, but whenever Judy looked at herself, all she thought was I look like myself, which was satisfying.  
  
  She puckered up in the mirror. Her lips were in between full and thin, of a normal pink color. Hmmm. Judy raised the red editing pencil close to her lips. The color match was perfect. And she was a good artist. Watching herself in the mirror, Judy took the pencil, moistened the point, and sketched across the top of her lip. The red pigment smelled funny and felt cold but was blunt enough not to scratch, and she drew a light line on her top lip, outlined her lower lip as well, and puckered up again for the mirror.  
  
  Not bad. You could see the red penciling, but her mouth looked bigger, which was supposed to be good these days, when lips like hot dogs ruled. The phone started ringing at reception, but Judy ignored it. She smiled at the mirror and looked instantly friendly, in an ersatz-Murphy I-ignore-the-phones sort of way. Apparently you couldn’t beat office supplies for makeup. Maybe she should take a Sharpie to her eyelids. Paint her fingernails with Wite-Out. Who said being a lawyer wasn’t fun? She set down the pencil, picked up the phone, and punched in a number.  
  
  “So how do I look?” Judy asked when Mary picked up.  
  
  “I got your message about the Sherman Act. Stop calling me about the Sherman Act.”  
  
  “This isn’t about the Sherman Act. Antitrust is easy. Lipliner is hard.”  
  
  “Murphy was in, huh?”  
  
  “She was trying to be friendly so I sent her away.”  
  
  “You should have lunch with her.”  
  
  “I don’t like her, and she doesn’t eat lunch. If I liked her and she ate lunch, I would go with her. Instead I stayed in and drew on my lips. So what do you think? Does Oscar Mayer come to mind?” Judy air-kissed the receiver, and Mary scoffed.  
  
  “You’re supposed to be making new friends.”  
  
  “No, I’m supposed to be writing an article and you’re supposed to stop slacking off and get your ass back to work.”  
  
  “I’m fine, and thank you for asking,” Mary said, though Judy could hear the smile in her voice. The smile didn’t come from Revlon or even Dixon Ticonderoga but was due entirely to a wonderful heart, and Judy felt a twinge of guilt. Attempted murder wasn’t a laughing matter.  
  
  “I’m sorry. How’re you feeling, Mare?”  
  
  “Pretty good for somebody who took two bullets.”  
  
  Judy winced. She had almost lost Mary, forever. She didn’t want to think about it. “You need anything? It’s only fifteen minutes by cab. Want me to bring you anything?”  
  
  “No thanks.”  
  
  “You sure?”  
  
  Mary snorted. “You regret that wisecrack, don’t you? If I didn’t know you better, I’d say you feel guilty.”  
  
  “Me?” Judy smiled. It was a long-running joke between them. Mary, an Italian Catholic, held the patent on guilt, and Judy could see that it would never expire. “No way. I’m from California.”  
  
  “You should be guilty. You were making fun of somebody with ventilation. What kind of friend are you?” Mary laughed, but it got lost in a surprising burst of background noise, which sounded like men talking loud. Mary had been recuperating at her parents’ house in South Philly, and the DiNunzios, whom Judy adored, were an old Italian couple who lived very quietly, at least  
when Mr. DiNunzio wore his hearing aid. Usually the only background noise at the DiNunzio rowhouse was a continuous loop of novenas.  
  
  “What’s that sound over there?” Judy asked. “Another DiNunzio clambake?”  
  
  “You don’t wanna know.”  
  
  “Yes, I do.” It sounded like quite a commotion, with the men now arguing. Judy frowned. “Is anything the matter?”  
  
  “You wouldn’t believe it.”  
  
  “Try me.”  
  
  “My father’s friends are here. You met Tony-From-Down-The-Block.”  
  
  “The guy he buys cigars with?”  
  
  “That could be anybody, but yes,” Mary answered, and the background arguing surged.  
  
  “What the hell was that?”  
  
  “Feet.”  
  
  “It didn’t sound like feet, it sounded like voices.”  
  
  “Feet’s his nickname. His real name is Tony Two Feet. He’s shouting. He’s an excitable boy, for an eighty-year-old.”  
  
  “Tony Two Feet? That’s a name? Everybody has two feet.”  
  
  “Don’t ask me. He’s my father’s other friend. They’re all upset about Pigeon Tony.”  
  
  Judy smiled. “Is anybody there not named Tony?”  
  
  “Please. It’s ten Italian men. Odds are three will be Tony, two will be Frank, and one will end up in jail. Pigeon Tony just got arrested. The smart money was on Dominic.”  
  
  “Arrested for what?”  
  
  “Murder.”  
  
  Judy’s lips formed an imperfectly lined circle. “Murder?”  
  
  “Also my mother sends her love.”  
  
  “Murder?” Judy felt her pulse quicken. “A friend of your father’s, arrested for murder? Your father is around seventy-five, isn’t he? How old is Tony? And who did he kill, allegedly? I mean whom?”  
  
  “You can’t just say Tony, you have to say Pigeon Tony, and he’s close to eighty. He grew up in Italy and he supposedly killed another old man, also from Italy. I was trying to figure out what the hell was going on when you called.”  
  
  Judy’s eyes flared in surprise. She felt awake for the first time in months. “Does Pigeon Tony have a lawyer?”  
  
  “Wait a minute. You sound interested. You’re not allowed to be interested.”  
  
  “Why not?” Judy inched forward on her horrible chair. Murder trumped antitrust. Spring had sprung. Her other phone line rang but she ignored it. Ignoring phones got easier with practice. “I can be interested. I have a First Amendment right to be interested.”  
  
  “My father wanted me to call you, but I don’t think you should take the case.”  
  
  “Your dad wants me to?” Judy’s pulse quickened. She would do anything to help Mary’s father, especially something she already wanted to do.  
  
  “Yes, but I don’t, and I don’t have time to fight about it. It’s La Traviata over here. I gotta go.”  
  
  “Put your dad on the phone, Mare.”  
  
  “No. Remember the last murder case we took? Gunfire ensued. Hot lead whizzing around. Lawyers are ill prepared for such things. Stick to the Sherman Act. Besides, I told my father Bennie won’t allow it.”  
  
  “Why wouldn’t she? We take murder cases now, and besides, the boss is at a deposition. I’ll apologize later if she won’t let me take it. Don’t make me whine. Put him on!”  
  
  “No.” The ruckus in the background started again, and Judy could hear Mary’s father closer to the phone.  
  
  “Now, Mare! Lemme talk to your father.” There was a sudden silence on the phone, and Judy could picture Mary’s hand covering the receiver, muting the arguing of the men and the softer voice of Mariano DiNunzio. “Mr. D, is that you?” Judy asked, shouting through Mary’s hand, as if it were possible. “What’s the matter, Mr. D?”  
  
  “Judy, thank God you called!” Mr. DiNunzio said. He came onto the line abruptly, and Judy assumed he had taken the phone from Mary. “The police, they have my friend downtown. They took him away, in handcuffs.” Mr. DiNunzio’s voice was choked with emotion, and Judy’s heart went out to him, the gravity of the situation striking home.  
  
  “What happened?”  
  
  “They say he killed a man, but he would never. He couldn’t. He wouldn’t.” Mr. DiNunzio cleared his throat, and Judy could hear him collect himself. “I would never ask such a thing, a favor, for me. For myself. You know this. But for my friend, my compare, he’s in trouble.”  
  
  “Whatever you need, you got it, Mr. D.”  
  
  “I know you, you’re a good girl. A smart lawyer. You know all the ins and outs. You work hard, like my Mary. Will you be his lawyer, Judy? Please?”  
  
  “Of course I will, Mr. D,” Judy answered, and the words weren’t out of her mouth before she was reaching for her briefcase.  
  
  And slipping her bare feet into a pair of clunky yellow clogs.

  Pigeon Tony struck Judy as the cutest defendant ever, and she wanted to rescue the little old man the moment she saw him in the interview room of the Roundhouse, Philadelphia’s police administration building. He was only five foot four, probably a hundred and thirty pounds, and he startled as Judy burst into the interview room, lost in a white paper jumpsuit that was way too large for his scrawny neck and narrow chest. His withered arms stuck like twigs from short sleeves, and his knobby wrists were pinched by steel handcuffs. His sunburned pate was dotted with liver spots and streaked by only a few filaments of silvery hair. His peeling nose was small and hooked; his eyes a round, dark brown, almost black, under a short brow. Judy couldn’t explain his superb tan, but she gathered he was called Pigeon because he looked like one.  
  
  “Mr. Lucia, I’m a lawyer,” she said, briefcase in hand. “My name is Judy Carrier and I was sent by the DiNunzios. They asked me to come and help you.”  
  
  The old man’s only response was to squint at her, and Judy didn’t understand why. Maybe he didn’t speak English. Maybe he didn’t want a lawyer. Maybe she should have worn pantyhose.  
  
  “I’m a friend of Mary DiNunzio.” Judy took a seat in the orange bucket chair on the lawyer’s side of the counter. Five ratty interview carrels sat side by side. The interview room was otherwise empty, not for want of felons but for want of lawyers. Few attorneys bothered to come to the bowels of the Roundhouse, preferring to meet their clients where the floor didn’t crawl. “You know Mary DiNunzio, don’t you?”  
  
  The old man, still squinting, slowly raised his arm and pointed at Judy with a finger that, though crooked at the knuckle, did not waver. His sleeve slid up his arm when he pointed, revealing a surprisingly wiry knot of biceps and a tattooed crucifix that had gone a blurry blue. But Judy still didn’t understand what he was pointing at.  
  
  “Mr. Lucia? What is it?”  
  
  “Your, eh, your face,” he said, his Italian accent as thick as tomato sauce. “Your mouth. Is bleeding?”  
  
  Judy reddened. The lipliner. The editing pencil. No wonder the cops had recoiled at the sight of her. And she thought it was because she was a lawyer. “No, it’s not bleeding. I’m sorry.” She wiped her mouth quickly, rouging the back of her hand. “Despite appearances, I’m not a clown but a lawyer, and a fairly good one, Mr. Lucia.”  
  
  “Mariano tell me. I call him, and he tell me you come. I thank you.” The old man nodded, in a courtly way. “Also you calla me Pigeon Tony. Everybody calla me Pigeon Tony.”  
  
  “Well, then, Pigeon Tony, you’re welcome, and I’m happy to represent you,” Judy said, then remembered she could get fired for taking on a nice client. Lately she had been representing corporations, ill-mannered entities by charter. “I’ll have to make sure that my boss says my firm can take your case. I just came down today to make sure you didn’t hurt yourself.”  
  
  Pigeon Tony’s brow furrowed in confusion.  
  
  Judy reminded herself to edit her words. Her only experience with broken English had been in the legal aid clinic in law school, and Latin hadn’t helped there either. “I mean, hurt your case. Say the wrong thing to the police. You didn’t talk to the police, did you?”  
  
  “I no talk. Mariano tell me.”  
  
  “Did the police ask you  
questions about the murder?” She flipped open the latch of her messy briefcase, wrested a legal pad from the debris, and located a Pilot pen strictly by sheer good luck. So what if her briefcase was a little full? Sometimes you had to carry your nest around. Nobody knew better than a military brat how to pitch a tent.  
  
  “Si, si, they ask questions.”  
  
  “What questions?” Judy was wondering if the cops had tried an end-run around the Miranda warnings, as they still did. Taking advantage of a little old man, an immigrant even. They should be ashamed. “Lots of questions?”  
  
  “I no answer.”  
  
  “Good.”  
  
  “I no like.”  
  
  Judy was getting the hang of the accent thing. “You no like what?”  
  
  “Police.”  
  
  She smiled as she uncapped the pen and flipped through the pad for a clean slate. “Now what else did the police do?”  
  
  “Take me to here, take my hands”—Pigeon Tony held up two small palms so that Judy could see the ink on each finger pad—“take me a picture. Take alla clothes, alla shoes, alla socks. Take blood. Take everything. Everything. No can believe!” His dark eyes rounded with amazement, and Judy gathered he didn’t get out much.  
  
  “They took your clothes and your blood for evidence. They always do that. It’s procedure.”  
  
  “Evidence?” Pigeon Tony repeated, rolling the unfamiliar word around in his mouth. “What means evidence?”  
  
  “Evidence is proof against you. Evidence shows you did the crime.”  
  
  “Evidence? Take mutandine!”  
  
  “What’s mutandine?” Judy asked, and Pigeon Tony went visibly red in the face, his thin skin a dead giveaway. Mutandine must have meant underwear.  
  
  “Forget,” he said quickly, looking away, and Judy suppressed a smile. He was so sweet, she couldn’t believe the police had arrested him for murder. Were they nuts? She was starting to no like police.  
  
  “I understand they’re charging you with murder.” Judy checked her notes. “The man they say you killed was eighty years old. Named Angelo Coluzzi. Did I say that right? Coluzzi?” She pronounced it like Coa-lootz-see, to make it sound festive and Italian. “Okay?

He missed, but the spoon broke in half and nearly cracked the glass coffee table. He has never thrown anything at me before, but in that moment I felt so scared. Especially since I feel like it was a massive overreaction. He had the whole day off, I had just come home from work. He asked me to boil rice for him because he doesn’t know how. I reluctantly agreed on the condition that he learns how by watching me. He just ignored me and went on TikTok. So i started boiling this rice, and I asked him if he has any grated cheese, to which he said “theres only a block, what you don’t know how to grate cheese yourself?”. This comment really pissed me off, and I told him “you can make your bloody food yourself” and I began to walk off. Me being a few meters away from him and facing away, I wasn’t expecting him to throw a spoon at me. It was a really violent throw as well. To the point that his grandmother came rushing out trying to see what happened. To me , this was literally those classic first signs of abuse. 

I told him I wanted to break up with him. Called my friend to pick me up. In the meantime he hid my work laptop so I couldn’t leave , and after begging him, he gave it back. He also kept blocking the door so I can’t leave. The action of him not letting me leave, by any means necessary (locking me in his room, pushing me) is something he does EVERY time we fight, because my first instinct is to go to my family’s house when Im upset, but he never lets me go. The funny thing is, when I left , he told me, “whatever you do, please don’t turn off your FindMy, thats all I have” (the very few times Im not with him, he always monitors it)

Now he met me yesterday, and begged me for three hours to give him a second chance. Saying that he understands that he was controlling , and he will change. He said if he does one more single controlling thing then it’s over. I was adamant at first that I wasn’t interested, but after three hours of begging, Im not so sure anymore.

So my question is, after the first signs of abuse, should one leave? Or should they give second chances?",4,1756877818.0,Advice,16,1.0,False

ZAIA
“I have some good news, Zaia. Sebastian will be so excited. Congratulations, you’re pregnant!” The
doctor’s words ring in my mind as I stare down at the test reports once again, as I leave the hospital.
“Sorry!” I say, as I avoid bumping into someone, my heart skipping a beat as I place a hand on my
stomach protectively, hurrying towards my awaiting car.
My driver, Ethan, is waiting beside the sleek black car and he opens the door for me, bowing his head.
“Thank you!” I say as I get in gracefully.
“Where to, ma’am?” he asks once he gets in the car. (*)
“Home,” I say, unable to suppress my smile, excitement bubbling through me.
This is actually happening. I’ve been trying for a baby for three years and finally…
finally, I am pregnant.
I want to shout it from the rooftop, tell everyone that yes! I’m pregnant with the heir to the pack! But I
contain my excitement. I need to tell Sebastian the good news first.
Sebastian is the Alpha of the Dark Hollow Falls pack. It is one of the largest packs on
the eastern side of the state.
However, with the large territory also comes the dangerous borders that roam with rogues, ready to
tear apart anyone who gets in their way.
Werewolves spend their entire lives searching and hoping to find their destined mates. As for me, I had
a crush on Bastien from the moment I had seen him when I
was eleven years old.
That crush never went away and when he turned out to be my fated mate, it had
been a dream come true and we had married.
+15 BONUS
He desperately wanted an heir, and which Alpha doesn’t? I had just turned eighteen
when I found him, but he was thirty one at the time. Many other alphas have sons.
who are already being trained to become the next alphas at his age.
“Make haste, Ethan, I have a lot to do today,” I say to the driver as I sit back against
the plush leather seat.
Reaching our large gated mansion, I step inside and head straight to the kitchen, my
stilettos echoing on the wooden floors. I will cook his favourite pudding and place
the reports underneath the plate!
“You may take the evening off, get some rest,” I say to the maid, Emma. “I’ll cook for
us tonight.”
“Oh, thank you, Luna!” she says, placing down the dish towel she had been holding.”
I am certain Alpha will absolutely be so happy if you make him his favourite dessert!
Not to mention he doesn’t like sweet things, but your pudding is something he can’t
resist!”
I can’t help but smile at her words. Yes, Sebastien doesn’t enjoy sweet things aside
from me and the cream pie that he loves.
My cheeks heat as I remember the first time he had told me that it’s now his second
favourite dessert, and in hopes of making his favourite dessert, I had asked him
what his favourite was. Only for him to smirk and reply; you.
I can’t help but smile from ear to ear, the elated feeling creating a pleasant buzz
around me as I get to work wanting everything to be perfect for his return.
Hours pass and when everything is almost ready, I change into something pretty and set up the dining
table with candles and the food.
“Almost 9pm…” he will be home soon.
With the troubles that have surrounded our borders, as well as having to run the
business, Sebastian often works until late into the night. But he would try to come
home by 9.30pm and continue working from home if necessary.
I sit down on the chair, watching the clock tick away, the sound loud in the room’s
silence.
Once again, I look down at my stomach, smiling softly as I await the return of my
mate.
Time passes slowly and soon 11 o’clock comes and goes, but I’m not deterred, maybe
I will reheat the food again….
I have just placed the reheated meals on the table when my head jerks up at the
sound of footsteps, making my heart thud at the sudden sound. I look toward the door excitedly.
Finally, he is home!
The front door shuts, and a familiar faint scent of my mate hits my nose.
I cast a swift glance at the clock on the wall. To my surprise, it’s past midnight.
I rush to the hall, the excitement of finally being able to tell him the good news
filling me. There he is, in the dimly lit hall. He still looks as handsome as ever.
Three and a half years on, he still makes my heart skip a beat whenever I see him.
He loosens his black tie, as he places his briefcase down, holding a few files in his
hands as well. His bright blue eyes look tired as they meet mine and I smile.
“Sebastian!” I rush over to him, wrapping my arms around his neck.
He catches me with one arm, but there’s no enthusiasm. He must have had a really
hard day. I don’t mind; I know how stressful things are at work lately.
Placing me back on the floor, he raises a brow as he looks down a
at me.
“Why are you awake at this time?” he asks me in his deep, rugged voice.
“I was waiting for you. I wanted to have dinner together. There’s something I wanted to tell you,” I
explain as I help him out of his jacket, brushing a piece of lint from hist white shirt that is no longer as
crisp as it was this morning.
“I’ve already eaten,” he replies, surprising me as heads towards the living room. “I have something to
tell you.”
“Ok, you go first,” I say as he drops onto the sofa, stretching his long legs, and resting
his arm on the back of the sofa.
I sit down beside him, knowing he would share something regarding the work.

opinion on his ideas.

However, there’s something off. There’s a coldness in he looks into mine.
Sebastian looks down at the file in his hands before he tosses it on the table, the
loud snap as it hits the table makes me jump.
“Read it.”
I take it uneasily and flip open the blank file, but the red words in bold print at the
top of the first page make my blood run cold.
‘DIVORCE AGREEMENT”
I gasp as I quickly scan the document. That feeling becomes worse. This is a divorce agreement with
our name on it… My entire body trembles as I look up at him, hurt.
and confused.
“W–why?” I manage to blurt out as I look at the man I love from the bottom of my
heart.
What went wrong?
“Annalise is back, and she’s rejoined the pack.”
I look up sharply. It’s suddenly hard to breathe.
“But I am your mate,” I whisper. How could he still care for Annalise? She was his
past. “We’ve been married for three years.”
“Our marriage was a mistake from the very beginning. Back then, my father
demanded that I marry my mate, but now I don’t want to be bound by the Goddess‘
arrangement. I don’t see the point of fated mates.”
My heart clenches. I look at his face, trying to understand what he’s thinking, but
there’s nothing that reveals his feelings and he has his walls up, blocking the mate
bond.

“But your father, he-”
“My Mom is not my father’s mate, but she still gave birth to me. She gave him at powerful Alpha son
and even after he found his mate, he stayed by her side,

destined mate when he himself is proof that you don’t need your mate.”
Those words are worse than being stabbed a thousand times, and I can feel my eyes
prickle with tears, the agony my wolf is feeling consuming me.
Does he really think that is the truth? Annalise is my half–sister and although she
and Sebastian had dated, I know her truth, the real her that she hides behind her
pretty face and doe eyes.
“Annalise only approached you because you were an Alpha… Sebastian, she doesn’t
love you the way I do. She wants to be Luna-”
He kicks the solid oak coffee table, making me jump as it’s thrown over with a loud
crash, hitting the wooden floor with a deafening bang that makes the ornaments in
the glass cabinet shake.
“And what about you? You just want to be Luna, don’t you! You knew that Annalise
and I were in a relationship, yet you selfishly accepted the marriage anyway and betrayed your own
sister by taking her man! You lied to me. She’s told me
everything!” 5.
“No, that’s not true. Let me explain-”
“Don’t antagonise me, Zaia, you got what you wanted, you became my wife and Luna,
but that wasn’t enough for you. You forced Annalise from coming anywhere near
this pack because you knew once she returned, I would learn everything!”
Yes, I did want Annalise to leave, but I never made her leave. She left of her own
accord once she learned Sebastian had found his mate, but now, it’s almost as if she
has been planning her return all this time.
Is she really enough to come between what we have? Sadly, I look into his eyes, realising he never
trusted me. He’s now judging and calculating everything I gave. him with suspicion, as if I had played
him to gain the position of Luna.
+15 BONUS
Doesn’t he realise I fell for him before I even knew he was an Alpha? Has he always been wary of me?
That one person can come between us and ruin it all? Did he even
for a moment, truly love me wholeheartedly?
I can’t understand it. Tell me Bastian… If you didn’t want me, then why did you make
love to me? Why did you touch me like I was the only woman who mattered to you?
Taking a deep breath, I ask him the decisive question. “Sebastian… Tell me, if it
wasn’t your father’s request-”
“Then I would have rejected you, and even now, I will, for Annalise.”
My lips quiver, remembering how my father hadn’t been happy with me marrying him. He never liked
Sebastian’s family, yet I had given it all up for him.
My family… my inheritance and my position, but it was clearly not enough for him.
If he’s able to cast me aside so easily, then what is my use?
He exhales as if I’m an irritating child and takes out a lighter and cigarette.
“Sign the papers soon. I don’t want this to drag out,” he says.
I stare down at the file as a single tear splashes onto the
“What did you want to tell me?” he asks.
papers.
“It’s no longer important… forget about it,” I say, thinking he will never see the
papers that currently sit on the dining room table.
“If you have any concerns regarding the alimony, let me know. Your expenses will
be covered and you are welcome to stay in the pack.”
That hurts.
“No… there’s no need. Everything is fine as it is. I will sign and have these returned. to you
immediately,” I reply as I stand up, trying to hold myself together when my entire world has come
crashing down around me.
He pauses for a second and simply nods, uncaring about my heartbreak and that I know he can feel
through the bond. Could he really cast me, his own mate, aside for another woman?
agony
The answer is in front of me, and although it is painful, the truth is yes, yes, he could.
“You may remain here for tonight. It’s late anyway. Annalise won’t move in until
everything is settled. I don’t want her to feel uncomfortable.”
I stare up into his handsome face, trying to recognise the man I fell for.
I smile bitterly and nod at him.
“Don’t worry, I’ll be gone. Say hi to Annalise for me.”

1n76j8d,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1n76j8d/aita_for_getting_my_middle_school_bully_and/,AITA for getting my middle school bully and former coworker fired,"I, 17 F, am a head lifeguard at a swim club, therefore I am in charge of making sure all of the other guards are doing their work well, helping with cleaning, etc.

Any way, my manager informed me we had a new hire and asked me to train her, show her the pool rotations, all that fun stuff. When I saw the girl who was hired I had to stop myself from making a shocked face. It was one of the girls who would bully me through out my entire middle school experience. Now normally I wouldn’t care because it was so long ago. But this girl didn’t just bully me. She made my life a living hell. It got so bad in middle school I had to be pulled out of school multiple days a week because I just couldn’t handle an entire school day. I still have insecurities and struggled with my mental health for years after. That being said….

I told myself to just try not to focus on it, and I’m sure she’s grown and matured since we were in middle school. 
I started training her and right off the bat she wasn’t paying attention, not asking any questions and just replied to everything I was saying with a simple “k” I was getting frustrated because lifeguarding can be a fun job but it’s also serious. It’s a lot of watching and scanning and making sure everyone is safe.

The first few days she worked, she would do nothing but talk to the other guards during activity hours (which is normally when we clean, do dive tests or take out trash) I would give her reminders to start getting the trash bags ready and she would look at me, not say a word, and then go to get bags in a very slow dramatic way. Which is fine, I figured maybe she’s shy, or just a little bit of an air head, and I do think it’s good for everyone to have a good relationship with their coworkers. But as the weeks went on, it was constant half effort of simple tasks, she would also often “forget” to clock out, which is definitely not okay because as most people know, that’s how we track how much we are supposed to get paid. She would never forget to clock in a little early which I don’t think is a coincidence 

The breaking point was when one of the younger guards (15 years old) came up to me looking upset. She had let me know that the new hire had made some rude comments about her and her family, when I asked exactly what she said I was told this 

New hire: I’m taking off next week since my family is going on a vacation 
15 y/o guard: oh lucky where are you going?
New hire: (I’m not sure where she’s going but it’s out of the country) 
15 y/o: oh wow that sounds like fun, I can’t wait till I’m old enough to go on a vacation out of the US
New hire: wait does your family like not travel? That’s… weird

And this is exactly what I was told (the 15 year old guard bless her heart is possibly one of the best story tellers ever, I mean she got the voice down perfect too) 

I had gone up to the new hire and asked to chat with her on her lunch break, she loudly sighed and said “k”

I had let her know that a few people had said that sometimes the way she words things may sound a little bit passive aggressive and I reminded her to think before she speaks 


This b*tch looked at me dead in the face and goes “wait so like is this about me saying your boyfriend is hot?” (For context, my boyfriend had often come to my work to drop off lunch for me, surprise me with coffee or sometimes would just pop in to say hi, he had never once spoken to any girls that work with me especially her. In fact the day she got hired I told him about her, so I know they never spoke because in his words “she sounds like a miserable pos”) so her making this comment was crazy, it’s crazy in general but also… GIRL THE MAN HAS NEVER EVEN SPOKE TO YOU

I beg your finest mf pardon 

I said “excuse me what?”
She just laughed and said “oh so it’s not about that. My bad”

I told her to go back to eating her lunch and just please keep a filter in mind
After that I heard her walk back into the break room and call me a “b*tch” and a few other nasty homophobic things about me I’d rather not repeat (I’m bi for anyone wondering, I’m not open about it. It also doesn’t matter because I’m in a rls with a man right now but just for context) 
I went to the manager and let him know, he seemed upset to hear this and said something along the lines of others complaining about her as well. He had let me know she will definitely not be being asked back to work the next summer. 

I know it was not my fault she got fired, but at the same time, I still delivered the final blow that made someone lose a job opportunity and a good recommendation. I feel a little bit guilty. I feel as though I may have acted more emotionally than I should have due to me and hers history.
So AITA for getting her fired?   ",4,1756877681.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,1,1.0,False

The 1.7 percent rise in the consumer price index marked a 0.4 percentage point slowdown from July’s 2.1 percent, according to Statistics Korea on Tuesday. The last time inflation was this low was in November 2023, when it stood at 1.5 percent.

Without a discount scheme by SK Telecom, the inflation rate would have stood at around 2.3 percent, according to the statistics agency. That would have been the biggest jump since July 2023, when it reached 2.6 percent.  
   
The mobile carrier halved the monthly bills for every single one of its more than 20 million subscribers during August as a one-time measure to compensate for a hacking incident earlier this year. Telecommunications prices fell 13.3 percent on year, dragging down the overall inflation rate by 0.59 percentage points.  
   
Despite the slowdown, the Bank of Korea (BOK) warned that the decline was temporary.  
   
   
“Consumer price growth will likely rebound to around 2 percent in September, once the one-off drop in telecom fees is removed,” said Kim Woong, BOK deputy governor, during a price trend review on Tuesday. “Inflation is expected to hover around 2 percent for the time being.”  
   
Excluding the telecom discount, inflationary pressures remained visible, especially in food prices.  
   
Prices for agricultural, livestock and fisheries products rose 4.8 percent on year in August, driven by a heat-induced surge in fresh food prices — a phenomenon dubbed “heatflation.”

That marked the steepest climb since July of last year, when it hit 5.5 percent. Prices rose across the board, with agricultural products gaining 2.7 percent, livestock 7.1 percent and fisheries 7.5 percent.  
   
Mackerel saw the largest on-year jump at 13.6 percent, followed by rice at 11 percent, pork at 9.4 percent, Korean beef at 6.6 percent and eggs at 8 percent.  
   
Livestock prices rose as reduced slaughter volumes limited supply, while demand increased due to the summer holiday season and the government’s consumption coupon programs, according to Statistics Korea.  
   
Korean beef saw its sharpest price rise since January 2022, while Korean pork recorded its biggest increase since July 2022.  
   
Fish prices surged due to reduced catches caused by high sea temperatures. The price of mackerel, meanwhile, rose despite a bigger overall haul as consumers favored larger fish, which became harder to find.  
   
The heat wave also took a toll on fresh produce.  
   
The fresh food index — which tracks items most affected by seasonal and weather factors — rose 2.1 percent on year and 7.8 on month in August. Fresh vegetable prices rose 19.3 percent compared to July, marking the biggest month-on-month increase in five years since August 2020, when the rate reached 24.4 percent.  
   
Paprika jumped 52.1 percent, napa cabbage 51.6 percent, spinach 50.7 percent and tomatoes 35.9 percent, compared to July.  
   
Processed food prices also saw persistent inflation, rising 4.2 percent on year in August after increasing by more than 4 percent every month since April. The processed food price index hit an all-time high of 124.82.

Bread rose 6.4 percent, coffee 14.6 percent, kimchi 15.5 percent and ham and bacon 11.3 percent, making them some of the processed foods with the most notable price increases.  
   
“A number of discounts ended for some items, pushing prices higher than in July, when the increase was 4.1 percent,” a Statistics Korea official said.  
   
With the Chuseok harvest holidays approaching in October, the government has stepped up efforts to curb food price inflation.  
   
First Vice Minister of Economy and Finance Lee Hyoung-il presided over a meeting with vice ministers to review countermeasures. The government plans to release additional reserves of napa cabbage and coordinate with retailers to offer discounts on items with high holiday demand.  
   
“Mobilize every available tool — from reserve supplies to discount support — to ensure price stability for food items,” Lee said during the meeting.  
   
The government will announce a broader economic relief package, including measures to stabilize prices for essential holiday goods, later in September.

Chapter 1

“Mom, about what Dad said years ago… I’ve decided to go through with it. Tell him to arrange the marriage.”

I ended the call, and the music flooded back in. Audrey’s birthday party was still in full swing.

Audrey—the girl I once saved from bullies, who I thought was my best friend.

Jared, my boyfriend, and Jackson, my closest childhood friend, changed the moment Audrey entered our lives. Suddenly, she was their everything. They laughed with her, cared for her… and eventually, they told me they loved her. Right to my face.

Then came the dinner. Just the three of us. A final attempt to fix things—so I thought. But when Audrey called, crying about being robbed, they left me. Again.

It was raining. I wandered the streets, soaked and alone, until I was hit by a car. They never even bothered checking on me.

So I packed my bags. Booked a flight. Met my groom.

Then I sent Jared and Jackson one last message: My Wedding Invitation.

\--

“About what father said years ago…” I paused, my voice barely rising above the music thumping through the villa walls. “I’m now agreeing to get married. Please tell him to arrange all the prep work. No need for romance—make it just formal.”

There was a moment of stunned silence on the other end before my mother’s familiar voice broke through. “Are you sure about this? What about your boyfriend, Jared? Did you finally break up with him?”

“Not yet,” I replied, firm but tired. “Don’t tell anyone about this yet.” I swallowed the ache in my throat. “I’ll send the other list for the agreement and return home as soon as possible.”

Then I hung up. The phone slid from my hand and dropped onto the soft mattress beside me. That’s when the noise outside clawed its way back into my senses.

It was Audrey’s birthday. The adopted daughter of my parents. The girl I once thought of as my little sister. The same girl I’d defended from bullies back in high school, when the four of us—me, Audrey, and my childhood friends Jared and Jackson—were supposed to be a family.

Back then, I thought I was doing the right thing. That helping her would bring us closer. That we could all live in one house and laugh over dinner. I never imagined she’d twist everything.

Audrey was clever like that. She’d wormed her way into everything. She used to tag along with us—me, Jared, and Jackson. I didn’t mind. At first. But then it was like she started trying to replace me. Whispering things to Jared when I wasn’t looking. Making Jackson laugh in a way that used to be just mine. Still, I told myself not to overthink it.

But then I saw it. The kiss. It was supposed to be a quiet night. Just me and Jared who eventually became my boyfriend as we both confessed our love. Then, I caught him and Audrey kissing.

I let it go—for a while. But it happened again. And again.

Every time I asked, Jared brushed it off. “You’re just jealous,” he’d say. “She’s like a sister.”

Jackson said the same. “Don’t ruin everything because you’re being insecure, Maureen.”

But it wasn’t insecurity. It was betrayal.

And now, here I was—alone at her birthday party. Watching the three of them giggle and clink glasses like they were the main characters in some twisted romantic comedy. Jared had just taken a shot—and with a laugh, he pressed the empty glass to Audrey’s lips, his free hand grazing her body as if they were already lovers.

I couldn’t breathe. I got up and quietly slipped back into one of the guest rooms upstairs. But just as I was pulling the blanket over my head, the door creaked open.

“Maureen?” Audrey’s voice was laced with fake concern. “They’re looking for you downstairs. We’re about to do the fireworks.”

I stayed still. “I’m tired and sleepy. Just go.”

“Come on…” She stepped closer. “It’s my birthday. Are you really going to be like this?”

I turned to face her, my voice low. “Audrey, isn’t it enough that I was forced to be here?”

She frowned. “Do you really hate me now? Is it because you think I stole them from you? That was never my intention. Please… we used to be best friends—”

“Stop.” I held up my hand. “Just go enjoy your party.”

But she wouldn’t. She grabbed my wrist, tugging. “Let’s go. It’ll be fun. I’m happy when you’re with me—”

“Don’t touch me!” I tried to yank away, but her grip tightened.

In the struggle, we lost balance. We both fell backward—Audrey crashing into the small table beside the bed. The vase on top tipped and shattered, the shards slicing into our arms and shoulders.

Pain bloomed down my forearm, but before I could react, the door flew open.

My boyfriend Jared. He didn’t rush to me. No. He ran to her.

“Are you okay? Audrey—what happened?!” he asked, checking her wounds, brushing the glass from her skin.

“She pushed me,” Audrey whimpered. “I didn’t mean to—she just—”

“What the heck, Maureen?!” Jared turned to me with a snarl. “You’re ruining everything. Again.”

I stared at him, speechless. Blood dripping from my hand.

“She attacked me,” I said, shaking. “She pulled me. I told her to stop—”

But he wasn’t listening. Neither was Jackson, who had now joined them. “You’re always like this,” he snapped. “Jealous. Dramatic. Can’t stand not being the center of attention.”

Then I was told to apologize. Even with blood soaking through my sleeves, I was the one ruining her birthday.

Jackson grabbed me by the arm. “Come on. You’re coming downstairs. We’re celebrating. You’re not going to embarrass the family again.”

So I went. Bruised, bleeding, humiliated—I stood beneath the fireworks, watching them laugh and dance.

Just one last time, I thought. One last time, I’ll try. I joined the circle by the bonfire, fake smile painted on like war paint.

The music swelled. People cheered. I was swaying, barely holding it together when I felt the shove. Jared pushed me? How… why?

I stumbled straight into the bonfire’s edge. Pain exploded up my arm as flames kissed my skin.

I screamed.

Someone screamed with me—Audrey. She rushed to my side, panicked. “Oh, god! Maureen is hurt! We need to call an ambulance—she’s hurt—”

But Jared stepped in, shaking his head. “It’s nothing. Just a small burn. She’ll get by. It’s her punishment for hurting you a while ago.""

And Jackson? He didn’t even look at me.

No one helped.

I dragged myself away from the fire. Then I hailed a cab.

No one offered to take me to the hospital. No one cared that I was bleeding.

But that was fine… because this is the last time they’re going to hurt me again.

Chapter 2

“It’s a good thing you came in right away,” the nurse said as she gently cleaned the raw skin of my arm. “This is a second-degree burn, and you needed stitches too.”

I didn’t respond. Just nodded. The white ceiling above me blurred. I stayed at the hospital for two more days.

Not a call. Not a single message. No “Are you okay?” No “Sorry for what happened.”

Nothing. They didn’t even care enough to pretend.

On the second evening, I found myself aimlessly scrolling through my phone. Maybe some part of me still hoped they’d reached out. But all I found were photos.

Bright, glowing snapshots of Audrey in her brand-new red dress, smiling between Jared and Jackson. Champagne glasses raised. That same smirk on her lips that she always wore when she knew she had won.

“Thank you Jared and Jackson for the best birthday ever! I’ll treasure this forever! Look at our new friendship bracelets!!!”

I zoomed in. Three matching bracelets. And then Jared and Jackson no longer wore our friendship bracelets like before.

I turned off the screen and placed the phone face down on the side table. Just silence again. My heart pounded in that silence. But it didn’t hurt anymore. It was just… empty.

Two days later, I was back at the apartment. The same place we’d all moved into after college. It was supposed to be a home for a family, only that they had betrayed me.

I stepped inside the quiet living room and headed straight to my bedroom. I opened the closet and began to pack.

I reached for my shoes and then paused. There it was—the memory box. That dumb, stupid box I had once called my ""treasure chest.""

I sat on the floor, dragging it out, letting the dust coat my fingers. Inside were letters. Crumpled, faded ones written by Jared and Jackson from when we were kids. Stick drawings, silly poems, “get well soon” cards when I had the flu.

And a photo. The three of us—me, Jared, and Jackson—kneeling by a treehouse, dirt on our clothes, wide grins across our faces.

I remembered that day. It was the summer I got bit by a dog. Or almost did. I was always terrified of dogs, and the neighbor’s dog had gotten loose. I froze, too scared to move. Jared and Jackson had jumped in front of me like it was instinct. Jared even got a bite on his arm just to protect me.

After that, everything changed. They became my shadows. My protectors. And somewhere along the way, I had fallen in love with Jared, while Jackson treated me like a sister.

Until Audrey ruined everything.

I sat on the floor, gripping a friendship bracelet with my name on it. I was such a fool.

My parents had warned me when I begged them to adopt Audrey. “Are you sure about this, Maureen? Not everyone wants a sister the way you do. And what if she hurts you? You can’t just trust anyone that easy.”

I hadn’t listened. I believed love would be enough.

But now?

Now I knew.

She didn’t want to be my sister. She wanted to be me.

I packed up the rest of my things. Then, I carried the memory box outside. I set the box down and lit the match in the backyard.

The flames caught quickly. The letters curled, blackening. The bracelets twisted in the heat, their gold sheen turning dull and dead. The photos dissolved into ash.

“Maureen!”

I turned at the sound of Jared’s voice. He came running from inside, panic written all over his face.

“What are you doing?!” he shouted. “Are those… are those our albums?! The bracelets?!”

“Yes,” I said simply. “I’m burning all our memories.”

He tried to move closer, but I stepped in front of the fire, blocking him. “It’s over. All of it.”

Jackson arrived seconds later, looking just as stunned.

“Is this some kind of tantrum?” he asked, arms crossed. “You’re upset, we get it. But this is dramatic, even for you.”

“This isn’t a tantrum,” I said, my voice calm, steady. “This is the end.”

“You’re really going to let one bad night ruin years of friendship?” Jared asked. “Maureen, don’t do this. We can talk—”

I met their gaze before turning to Jared. “I don't want to ever be with the both of you again.""

I turned away and walked back inside the apartment, the smoke still curling behind me.

Chapter 3

I thought they’d leave me alone after I burned everything. But they didn’t.

Days passed, and slowly, Jared started acting like nothing had happened. He began sending flowers again. He texted like a sweet boyfriend, asked about my day, and even tried to kiss me once when we crossed paths outside the building. It was as if nothing had ever gone wrong.

Jackson followed suit, playing the big brother again—bringing coffee, joking about old times. Every time they said, “Sorry about what happened, let’s fix things,” it sounded more like they were apologizing for a stubbed toe than years of neglect and betrayal.

Then they surprised me with dinner.

“Our treat,” Jared said. “At our old spot.”

Part of me wanted to delete the message and never look back. But another part of me—the tired, devastated part—wondered if maybe, just maybe, we could end this all without bitterness. Without hating each other.

So I went. The restaurant hadn’t changed. Dim lighting, warm wooden booths, soft jazz playing overhead. It smelled like rosemary and nostalgia. I sat down, watching them laugh, trying to recapture something that had long since died. For a few moments, it almost felt okay.

Then Jared’s phone rang.

He glanced at it and froze. “It’s Audrey.”

He answered, frowning. “What? Slow down… You were robbed? What? Stabbed?! Where are you—”

In seconds, both he and Jackson were on their feet.

“She’s crying,” Jared explained breathlessly. “She was attacked. We’ve got to go.”

They didn’t say goodbye. They didn’t even look at me again.

They just ran. Ran like their world depended on her.

I sat there in silence, staring at the half-eaten food. The candle on the table flickered until it burned out completely.

I paid the bill myself.

When I stepped outside, the sky had opened up. Thunder cracked across the heavens as rain poured relentlessly. The streets were nearly empty—no taxis, no buses. The restaurant manager offered me an umbrella, but they were already closed. I couldn’t stay.

So I walked. Each step was heavy. My bandaged arms ached. My body screamed for rest. But the worst part?

The thunder. It echoed in my chest, triggering a deep fear I’d carried since childhood. I always froze during storms. The lightning, the cracks—it made me feel like the world was about to split in two.

I wrapped my coat tighter and kept going, the city turning into a blur of light and shadows.

Then—a sharp light. A horn.

A car.

I didn’t even have time to move.

Then: darkness.

When I woke up, everything felt… soft. Too soft. I was in a room I didn’t recognize. Clean, white walls. Dim lighting. My body hurt, but it was dull, distant. I blinked hard, turning toward the sound of someone shifting nearby.

“Jared…?” I whispered.

But it wasn’t him.

A man sat in the corner, tall, dressed in black, his eyes unreadable. He didn’t move until I tried to sit up.

“You’re awake,” he said. His voice was deep, steady. “Don’t move too much.”

“Who… are you?”

“Roscoe,” he said. “I found you after the accident. Took you to the hospital. You were unconscious.”

I wanted to ask more. But everything spun—and I blacked out again.

When I opened my eyes again, Roscoe was gone.

No note. No contact. Just… gone. There were no missed calls. No messages. No check-ins.

Except for my mother.

Mom: Call me when you’re on your way here now. Everything’s ready now. Come home.

I didn’t tell her what happened. I didn’t want her to worry.

The nurse told me I’d been lucky. The car had hit me from the side, but nothing was broken—still, I needed a few more days to heal.

So I stayed. Alone.

Until discharge.

Back at the apartment, I stepped inside just to grab the last of my things before I booked my flight home.

That’s when Jared appeared at the door.

“Oh, good. You’re back.” He smiled like nothing had happened. “So, listen… we had to sell your car. And some of your things too. Audrey needed emergency funds, and—”

“What?” I asked, stunned. “You sold my things?”

“Relax,” Jackson said, walking in. “We’ll pay you back. But Audrey’s been through a lot after the robbery. She needs someone to take care of her—can you cook for her? She’s not eating well.”

I blinked, stunned. “Are you serious?”

Jackson’s brows furrowed. “Where’ve you been anyway? Audrey said you went to some party after the dinner. Don’t you think that’s not a good behavior when Audrey was in danger? You shouldn’t have been here with us! I think you’re being selfish.”

I felt like I’d been punched. I laughed. It came out hollow, broken. “Right. A party.”

Then I threw the hospital discharge file straight at them.

“There. That’s where I was. The hospital. You left me in the rain. I walked home through a thunderstorm. I got hit by a car.”

“What…?” Jared asked, staring. “You were in the hospital?”

“I thought you were with friends…” Jackson mumbled, confused. “Audrey said—”

“Of course she did,” I snapped. “It’s always Audrey, isn’t it?”

Before they could say more, a high-pitched scream came from the hallway.

“Help! Jared, Jackson—it hurts! Please!”

Audrey. Of course.

Always Audrey.

I didn’t wait to hear their response. I turned, stepped over the threshold, and walked away.

Chapter 4

My entire body still ached. So instead of leaving as planned, I stayed in my room, letting the dull pain anchor me to the bed.

I didn’t cry. There were no tears left.

When I opened my eyes again, sunlight streamed through the curtains, warm against my skin. And right there, at the foot of my bed, stood Jared and Jackson.

“Good morning,” Jared said with a sheepish smile, holding a tray. “We brought you breakfast.”

Jackson placed the tray gently on my lap. Toast, scrambled eggs, some fruit, and a glass of orange juice. Bland and almost cold.

“Thought you could use something to start the day,” Jackson added, sitting at the edge of the bed.

I looked at them. They looked casual. Relaxed. Almost happy. Like the last few days hadn’t happened.

“Look,” Jared said, scratching the back of his neck. “We’re sorry. Audrey told us she saw an Instagram story of you at a party that night… and she was just hurt, you know? She got robbed and stabbed while thinking you were out dancing. She… she thought you were ignoring her on purpose.”

Jackson chimed in. “She really believed it. So… maybe you should apologize to her. Just to clear things up.”

I stared at them in disbelief, then scoffed.

“Maybe you should apologize to me.”

That made them blink.

Jared frowned. “Why would we? It’s not like we did anything wrong. You didn’t tell us what happened. If you had, we could’ve been there for you.”

I let out a bitter laugh. “Do I need to beg to be cared about now? I was gone for days. You didn’t even check.”

“Don’t say that,” Jackson said firmly. “Audrey got stabbed. She needs us.”

“And I didn’t?” My voice sharpened. “So if I’m not bleeding in front of you, I don’t deserve a second thought?”

Before either of them could respond, the door creaked open and in she came.

Audrey. She wore a soft, oversized sweater and limped slightly. Her face was pale, lips trembling as tears welled up in her eyes.

“Are you picking a fight with me now, Maureen?” she whispered, her voice shaking. “I’m sorry. Okay? I didn’t mean to get hurt. I didn’t mean for any of this to happen.”

I watched her carefully. Her trembling, her pout, the subtle gaslighting laced in every word. Like she was the one being attacked.

Again. The tears slipped down her cheeks.

“I just… I don’t want us to be enemies. We were sisters once… I wish we could go back.”

And just like that, the boys snapped.

“Stop making her cry, Maureen,” Jared snapped.

“Come on, Audrey,” Jackson said softly. “You shouldn’t be walking too much. Let’s get you back to bed.”

They turned to her with such care, such concern—it stung.

“I’ll feed you,” Jared said as he took her hand. “You need to eat.”

“Yeah,” Jackson added. “You need your strength. We’ll get your favorite seafood in the other room.”

Then they turned back to me.

“You eat what we made, Maureen,” Jared said. “You’ve been discharged. Stop being so picky.”

And with that, they led Audrey out, leaving me alone again.

I looked down at the plate in front of me. The eggs were rubbery. The toast, dry. The fruit was unripe.

Across the hall, I could hear them laughing.

Audrey’s voice rang out clear: “Mmm, I love crab legs! You remembered I hate toast, right? Seafood’s my favorite!”

Of course it was. They gave me scraps and fed her a feast.

I didn’t cry. Not this time. I was just done.

My phone buzzed.

It was a message from Mom: Venue options are in. Also attached are the dresses. Let me know what you like, darling.

I tapped the call icon.

“Mom,” I said, my voice steady.

“Maureen! Did you get the pictures? What do you think of the flower arrangements?” she asked excitedly. “And also the dresses?”

“I like everything. It was actually hard to choose,” I replied. “I’ll finalize it today. But I think I like the vintage one.”

“Great! We’ll prepare it for you. How long until you come back? Your groom’s waiting, you know. He’s very eager.”

“Just a few more days. Something happened, but I’ll be there. I’m looking forward to wearing those dresses… to the wedding.”

Mom let out a soft laugh. “That’s my girl. We’ll wait for you.”

I hung up. I stared at the tray, untouched. Then I felt it—the silence shift.

I looked up. Jared and Jackson stood in the doorway. I hadn’t even heard them come back.

Their eyes locked on me, their faces unreadable.

Jackson’s voice came first. “Dress to the wedding?”

Then Jared stepped forward, his brows pulling into a frown. “Wedding? What wedding?”

This never happened in school, it started later in years of college, I’ve been super struggling with staying awake in class, it started with subjects I am not interested in, now unless the topic is important, the presentation is interesting, and the professor is engaging the students with questions and stories (which is only one of my lectures) I’m always dozing off, I’m not a morning person but I can’t even stay awake on the weekend playing games or watching movies, only once it passes 12:30 noon do finally wake up 

doesn’t matter how long I slept. I don’t drink coffee never have, the smell alone makes me vomit, I am overweight and I know I snore at night, I don’t know if that’s sleep apnea, I am probably depressed 

I’ve tried a lot of the common tricks of staying awake, they might work for a minute, holding breath, walking, cold water, keeping water in mouth, have a snack, listening to music, reading a story, solving a math problem, and while I also don’t like it drink a couple cups of tea/soda to get some caffeine and that didn’t work either 

I’ve knows it was a problem before but I tried to ignore it, today was the breaking point because I spent nearly 2 hours, yes, 2 whole hours trying to watch an 8 minute video lecture, I replayed it so many times then every time wake up finding myself on the next video, having slept at some point ",1,1756877234.0,AskDocs,2,1.0,False

I work in a boba tea place and I’ve tried every flavor there. Every single one, and some of them are pretty good and some of them are absolute dogshit. The worst one by far is matcha, I hate it. I’ve tried so hard to like matcha, I’ve had chocolates, candy, coffees, and now boba teas but it just tastes like ass and it fills me with indescribable rage. Matcha feels like one of those things I should really like but I really don’t and I fucking hate it like bro why. Like the color is pretty and I like planty things so why don’t I like you.

What bothers me most is that it’s actually really popular. It’s less popular than taro and Thai which are actually fucking good but it’s still very requested, I haven’t had a day where I don’t make at least five. When I make a drink for a customer and I accidentally have some leftovers I drink it but I never do with matcha and it makes me so mad to see leftover tea and not drink it because I know I’ll just be greeted with the taste of grass and hell. It’s like a punishment.


If someone orders me a matcha I will make their drink but put less boba pearls in, it’s usually three scoops but I’ll put in two, maybe one and a half, and I feel really bad about it but also I have no intention of stopping. Also a bit of a side note but if someone asks for a flavor that actually tastes like it’s edible like Thai or chai I put more boba in 

If my boss is reading this, fire me if you want but you know yoi hate matcha too, don’t act like you don’t know where I’m coming from. ",1,1756877037.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

Here’s my honest take on what’s worth it and what’s not.

Google Opinion Rewards – You’ll make maybe 20 to 50 cents a survey, and the surveys stop showing up fast. Barely enough to buy a coffee in a month.

Eureka Surveys – Pretty much the same thing. Way too much time for literal pennies.

Sweatcoin – Walked thousands of steps and ended up with “rewards” that are just overpriced gift cards or discounts I don’t need.

Honeygain – Sounds good in theory (“get paid for unused internet”) but in reality, you’re looking at maybe a dollar or two a month unless you’ve got a huge network running nonstop.

Credit card reward hacking – It can work, but unless you’re extremely organized and disciplined, juggling multiple cards and minimum spends is stressful.

Bank account bonuses – You can make a couple hundred bucks here and there, but constantly opening and closing accounts gets tedious and can get flagged eventually.

After wasting way too many hours on tiny payouts, I finally found something that actually scales a bit better: Benable.

Think of it like Pinterest meets Amazon affiliates. You make curated shopping lists — stuff like “morning skincare routine,” “best fragrances,” “travel must-haves.” Share the lists anywhere you want, and if someone buys from your list, you get a commission.

It’s been better for me because people are actually looking for recommendations. If you put in a little effort with good descriptions and keywords, you can get free traffic from Google, too. The nice part is once you build the lists, they just sit there and keep earning without you babysitting them.

An introduction: I'm Jay, 31, male, from Texas though I've lived in the Midwest for a time (got to experience some of the worst summers and worst winters in my lifetime). I work as a veterinarian for humans - they get brought in, and I try my best to fix their issues and problems. It's been a pretty high stakes job; I average about 60-80 hours per week for about 50 weeks of the year. It won't always be this bad, but these hours are required during the initial years of the career (and it was even worse before the government stepped in to say 80 hours is the *maximum* we should have to do).

On top of that, I've got a case presentation to give on Friday, and then I've got a research presentation to give in about a week.

This is where you come in: I'm hoping that your wonderful, brief distractions will fill me with the motivation to keep on working through these duties. While my posture may suffer at this desk, my soul will rejoice every time I see that little red notification in the corner. Equally important, it'd be really nice to make a friend or two outside of work since I don't get too much time to be the social butterfly I used to be.

I find things begin best with a question a lot of times, so here's a few for you to pick from:

1. How would you describe your perfect meal?
2. How do you take your coffee? If you don't like coffee, what beverage can I grab for you?
3. Do you think some animals do know how to talk and communicate with us, they've just chosen not to? Maybe because they want to avoid paying taxes or something.

If you've made it this far, here's a little more about me:  
You already know what I do for work, but my dream job was to be an astronaut, I love aviation and space, I think I could find something cute about any animal, and overall I think laughing your way through most situations is an ideal strategy.

I look forward to hearing from ya.

Luv,  
Jay

The closest experience I had was when I met my now-ex in a game chat group during the pandemic (cannot state the actual name/shortcut ng app due to this subreddit's rules), pero tropa siya ng tropa ko kind-of-set up so they could still personally vouch for her. I had an account sa yellow app na ginawa ng same friend group ko for me (or probably most likely for my ex) since this same ex wanted to know my preferences. So at that time they were choosing WITH me kung sino ang mga type na is-swipe right(?) ko. That night ended with like one swipe lang HAHAHA.

The last few weeks have been the scariest of my life. My biggest challenge being short of breath. Like i’m sucking on air through one of those coffee stirrer straws. Getting not enough air and not being able to get a good deep breath sends me into a panic and I assume i’m dying. But then i get through it. Next day, it happens again, sometimes several times. Everyday I feel like i’m dying. I go through phases, I’ll feel better alittle bit if im relaxing and laying down watching a movie, but then all of a sudden I get the weirdest feeling in my chest like theres an alien about to jump out and it jolts me up. This also happens when I’ve been sleeping the last week, it’s like i can start to fall asleep, breathing in and out of my nose (best method for anxiety apparently) but then as soon as I almost fall asleep completely my breathing is so unregulated and i don’t have enough Co2 or something that my body jolts awake and i have this warmth in my chest. So i haven’t slept much at all recently. I haven’t been to work or seen my boyfriend/friends in weeks. I’m so scared. The fear of something being seriously wrong with me has reverted me back into being a hypochondriac. I have severe health anxiety after getting a blood clot two years ago even tho it was eliminated and i was cleared for it. Went to the ER 4 fucking times in the last 3 weeks, cat scans, x rays, blood work, ekgs. Everything is normal. So why do I feel like i’m dying. And the feeling of this is making me actually want to die now but also so scared of it. I definitely had years worth of unchecked anxiety just all catch up to me one day and ever since then it’s been like a living nightmare. Anyone have any similar experiences or just any advice i’m desperate at this point. ",1,1756875881.0,Anxiety,1,1.0,False

Chapter 40: Report and Orders.

In the Guard's Deep Command Center, carved from solid rock beneath the Mojave Desert, the silence was so profound that one could only hear the quiet hum of the life-support systems and the barely perceptible, low thrum of the Swarm project's quantum computer. The hours dragged on in a tension that seemed to thicken the air. On the main operations floor, in what was known as ""The Pit,"" dozens of officers stared at their consoles, their faces illuminated only by the glow of the monitors. Above them, in the center of the room, floated a gigantic, three-dimensional holoprojector, displaying the Solar System with almost divine precision.
At this moment, however, all attention was focused on a single, distant point in the Kuiper Belt. Five small, green icons—strike group ""Spear""—moved in a silent, time-delayed ballet of death with two frigates. Quantum communications had failed the exact moment Spear group decelerated near Persephone, hiding in its shadow to prepare an ambush. Aris suspected that the two Plague frigates had employed some unknown quantum communications jamming system. He searched for clues in the Swarm's intelligence and scientific data, but unfortunately, there was not the slightest trace of information about such capabilities.
Aris began to speak. ""The Swarm is not omnipotent, Marcus. The reptilian race has the ability to jam quantum communications."" Aris continued, ""We are only just beginning to understand the new equations and theories of quantum physics.""
Admiral Marcus cursed under his breath. ""That capability is priceless for gaining an advantage on the battlefield at such distances. Fleet staffs will be using data delayed by hours, days, even years."" ""Jesus,"" he breathed, clutching his head. ""You have to figure this out, brother, do you understand? You have to."" Marcus's plea was like the cry of a child whose toy had been taken away.
Aris interjected, cutting him off. ""Fortunately, this jamming doesn't have a system-wide range. The data you see is coming from one of the Swarm's Eye satellites, located an hour's light-speed away from the battlefield. Its quantum link is working, but the delay is two hours. It takes an hour for the radar waves to reach the battle, another hour for the reflection to return, and then it's transmitted instantly to Earth through the operational quantum transmitter.""
Admiral Marcus Thorne had not left his command post for a single minute since the first shot was fired in the delayed battle transmission. He stood on a raised platform overlooking the entire hall, a lone, motionless figure against the cosmic map. In his hand, another cup of black, bitter coffee grew cold. He hadn't slept for over thirty hours, overseeing the creation of Earth's defense line and approving the ambush plan Volkov had presented to him. He didn't feel tired. He only felt a cold, controlled pressure and frustration.
The frustration was caused by the tyranny of physics. The battle he was watching was a ghost. It might have already ended, billions of kilometers away. The light signals carrying the image of what was happening were only now reaching their passive sensors and the telescopes on Earth. The delay was over six hours, and in those images, the battle had just begun. Yet, according to the radar data from the Swarm's Eye satellite, it had been raging for four hours. He was the most powerful military commander in human history, yet he was just a helpless spectator, forced to watch a performance whose outcome had been decided long ago.
He analyzed every one of Volkov's maneuvers picked up by the Swarm's Eye radar system, but he understood nothing. Why was there no signal from one of the ships? Why did three ships then approach the cruiser and disappear, leaving a single, virtually stationary signal for four hours?
""Admiral,"" a voice suddenly shouted as an officer ran towards him. It was Second Lieutenant Chen, the quantum communications officer. ""We have a signature of an incoming signal. Identifier: G-F-S Gryphon. Transmission Protocol: Omega. Confirming successful quantum entanglement and initiating decryption. Time to full data download: fifteen seconds.""
Aris yelled, ""They won, brother!"" and laughed.
""How?"" Marcus asked. ""How do you know?""
""Quantum communication on the battlefield is back online. I suspect they destroyed some device on the Plague frigates. Which means they won,"" he smiled.
An absolute silence fell over The Pit. Even the quiet murmur of conversations ceased. All the officers looked up from their consoles, their eyes fixed on the main holoprojector. Three seconds. That was all that separated them from the truth. From the final accounting of gains and losses. Marcus Thorne felt the muscles in his back tighten even further. This was the moment of truth.
When the countdown ended, the signal from the Gryphon's quantum communicator was like a bursting dam. A torrent of data—raw, uncompressed, brutal—poured onto the screens. The Swarm project's quantum computer, linked to the command systems, immediately began to analyze and visualize it, painting a full, multi-layered picture of the battle on the holoprojector. They finally had live data, bypassing the distance and the time needed to receive it.
First came the telemetry. The chaotic, jagged flight paths of destroyers performing evasive maneuvers, sudden spikes in energy consumption, G-force readings that should have crushed human bodies. It was a record of pure, physical violence. Thorne saw the moment the Ivan the Terrible was hit for the second time—its motion vector changed abruptly, the ship lurching before its systems could stabilize it.
Then came the combat logs and recordings. This was the worst part. Short, fragmented video feeds from the bridges just before impact. Thorne forced himself to watch. He saw the terrified but determined face of Captain Orlov on the bridge of the Piast, a second before the image was flooded with blinding white and the transmission was cut forever. He saw the chaotic scene on the shattered bridge of the Ivan the Terrible, blood on Volkov's face, and heard his roar as he gave the order for the final, desperate salvo from the plasma cannon. He heard the screams of the wounded, the shriek of alarms, the crack of tearing metal. These were no longer just icons on a map. They were his people.
The third layer of data was the coldest and cruelest. Medical reports and damage assessments. Three-dimensional models of the damaged ships appeared on the main screen. The Ivan the Terrible was a phantom, with huge, red-marked holes in its hull. The Jagiellon had a gash in its sensor tower. And on a side monitor that no one wanted to look at, a list of the dead and wounded began to scroll. Name, rank, service number. A long, unending list. 137 names from the Piast—killed. And 121 from the Ivan the Terrible, including 83 killed. But there was also good news: 13 of the 16 drifting sailors had been rescued; the rescue operation was a success. Unfortunately, three didn't make it. Suit malfunctions had claimed their lives; they suffocated in the blackness of space, alone, illuminated by the pale light of the solar system's star. Their bodies were brought aboard the Jagiellon with full honors.
Marcus's mind processed the information with superhuman speed. He saw it all: the first, failed salvo; the invisible blow that destroyed the Piast; Volkov's desperate but effective response; the disabling of one enemy and the destruction of the other; then the desperate tactic where the cruiser became a shield. Everything was now clear and matched the radar data from the Swarm's Eye. A victory. Yes. But at what cost?
Just as he was analyzing the damage report for his flagship cruiser, Second Lieutenant Chen, the same communications officer, stood beside his console. He was sweating, having run from console to console, but this time his eyes burned with excitement. ""We have a report from Volkov himself, Admiral! Confirmation from the battlefield! Strike group Spear reports...""
""STOP TALKING.""
The Admiral's voice was like the crack of a whip, cold and sharp. There was no anger in it, only absolute, total concentration. The officer fell silent mid-word, as if he had hit an invisible wall. Everyone in The Pit froze upon hearing the order. Thorne hadn't raised his voice, but its intensity filled the entire room. He pointed a finger at the main screen, where the combat logs were currently scrolling. ""I can see it, Lieutenant. I am processing the raw data. Your verbal summary is, at this moment, an irritating, slow-moving noise. I know they were victorious. I know Target Alpha was completely destroyed, and Target Beta is disabled with potential prisoners. You have the full report in the network. Read it, process it, and send it to the UN."" Admiral Thorne suddenly looked at the officer again.
""My apologies. I haven't slept for many hours. You perform your duties exemplarily and with due diligence. I wish there were more officers like you. That was my fault.""
The officer, honored by the statement, straightened up, stood at attention, gave a stiff salute, and retreated silently to the edge of the desk. Thorne had already forgotten him. His mind had jumped from analyzing the past to planning the future. Victory was not a cause for celebration for him. It was a bloody, but priceless opportunity.
He turned away from the main screen and addressed his chief of operations, Commander Hanako Tanaka, a woman with steel-gray eyes and black hair who had stood silently beside him through the whole ordeal. ""Hanako. Immediately dispatch research vessels and transport ships with spare parts from the base on Ganymede. It's our closest facility. Assign two 'Wasp'-class patrol boats as their escort. I want them there yesterday."" The Wasps were already obsolete; the 500-ton ships were mainly used for training young sailors and had a single, outdated small railgun, but they were the closest.
His voice was cold and precise. Every word was an order that set another piece of humanity's gigantic war machine in motion. Hanako nodded, her fingers already tapping commands on her own console. ""What guidelines for the research team, Marcus?"" she asked, her voice just as calm.
""Their mission: examine the Plague wreck. I want to know everything. Absolutely everything. What they're made of, the structure of their armor. How their reactors work, the principle behind their drives. Above all, I want a full analysis of their weapons. What material the projectiles were made of, what velocity they achieve, and how in the hell they remain invisible to our sensors. Have them investigate why the Gryphon's sensors were the only ones that detected something. Order them to take that technology apart, atom by atom. And most importantly...""
He paused for a moment, turning to look her straight in the eyes. His gaze was so intense that even she, a veteran of countless political and military battles, felt a shiver. ""And most importantly, Hanako, they are to determine if anyone can be taken alive. If that's even possible. I want to interrogate one of those reptiles. I want to know what they think, what they fear, how they fight. I want to get inside their heads. Order the boarding party and xenobiologists to make every attempt to secure a live or intact specimen. Carry out this task regardless of the cost. I repeat, regardless of the cost.""
""Understood, Admiral. Casualties authorized,"" she replied without hesitation. They both knew what that meant. The lives of the research team members were secondary to the potential value of such a prize.
Thorne turned back to the communications officer, who was still standing by the desk. ""Lieutenant.""
The soldier snapped to attention.
""Relay a new order to Captain Volkov. Immediately. The sailors from the surviving destroyers, and those from the boarding parties, are to form a joint team and search the Plague wreck for survivors and data banks. Have them look for their bridge, their command center, anything that resembles a memory core, a flash drive, etc. Secure everything that isn't nailed down. We cannot wait for the team from Ganymede. I need preliminary data immediately. Send it.""
""Yes, sir!"" The lieutenant, having recovered from the shock, saluted and ran off to transmit the orders that would send the battle-weary soldiers on another, possibly suicidal, mission.
Admiral Thorne was left alone in his silent command center. The holoprojector still showed the battlefield—two destroyed red symbols and four surviving green ones. He glanced at the scrolling list of casualties.
The wreck was a mine of information. A treasure trove of technology that could give them an advantage in the next engagement or at least level the playing field. And a potential prisoner... was priceless. It was the key to understanding the enemy, and understanding was the key to victory.
War was based on information, and information was a form of power. He had just sent his people to seize it directly from the bleeding entrails of a defeated enemy. The price was terrible, but for Admiral Marcus Thorne, who in his mind was already designing new shields, new swords, and thinking of the next, inevitable battles, it was entirely acceptable. It was the first down payment on the account of humanity's survival. And he was prepared to keep paying. To pay in blood, and then with the lives of his soldiers.
A memory from 12 years ago surfaced in his mind: cannon fodder.

Been working on it for two years with therapy, and I think I'm a lot better. But I can’t say I’m not still weird. My addiction made me make a lot of stupid mistakes, so I isolated myself. I don't have friends, and I have avoided promotions just so I could work alone and not mess people up.

About 7 months ago this girl (27F) reached out to me. She's a trans woman who transitioned some four yeears ago, so you can imagine she's been through her own shit. We’re in the same dept but not the same team. She doesn’t talk to many people either, but unlike me she’s not a creep, she’s got a close friend circle at work. We've started talking a lot recently. She shared her trauma, I shared mine, and that’s how we bonded. Both of us have parents who abandoned us, and for the first time I felt like someone actually got me. I even started going into the office more often just to see her. We have coffee sometimes.

The thing is, now there’s this new guy. She’s always with him, taking pictures, sharing food. And they are always together. Easy to tell she likes him.

So I’m unsure now, if I should confess my feelings for her. Even if there’s a 1% chance, I feel like taking it. But then I think, being with me might only add trouble to her life. Maybe with him she could be happier. Other days I just think I should tell her how I feel and let her decide.

I’ve never felt this kind of love for anyone before, like I just want good things to happen to her. Like it matters to me for the first time in my life. I don't want her to say yest to me and then regret it later.

But in the past couple of days I feel like it would be futile to even share my feelings with her coz though she does have an idea about my issues, there's still a lot to uncover and  I have done a lot of shit which would make any sane person want to stay clear from me.

TL;DR: 29M recovering sex addict, fell for my 27F trans coworker. We bonded over shared trauma and abandonment, but she might like another guy. Don’t know if I should confess or stay quiet.",0,1756875462.0,AskIndianWomen,10,0.27,False

I think I ruined her life but she seems oddly content since it happened. I'm wondering if I should let her deal with her feelings on her own or give advice on what she should do now?,"Preface: This is a extremely heavy story an very in depth please read at your discretion. Yes i know I'm the asshole in this, I'm not looking for that answer I'm aware of what I have done.

For context, back in 2023 i was enrolled in a course in community college where i met my friend (we will call B), we became close fast since we were made group partners for the entire semester and bonded quick. We mainly bonded over us both suffering from bad anxiety. Over the course of the semester B and I became very important in each others lives. We spent all of our time in class together and a lot of time outside of class together outside of jobs and our own personal friend groups. At some point mid semester we began a friends with benefits situation. This then evolved into actual feelings for one another. We decided to wait until the semester was over before starting an actual relationship since we didn't want to be distracted during final exams. Unfortunately at the time that never ended up happening, after the semester ended we both had to deal with separate extremely stressful personal issues involving our family. Our communication became strained and eventually we fell out of each others lives.

Fast forward to the end of 2024, B reached out to me out of nowhere and wanted to get some stuff off her chest. B told me that she felt responsible for us falling apart because she felt that she was the one who stopped reaching out. I told her that I also felt responsible since I also was dealing with issues at the time that made me hard to communicate with. We both felt relief learning that neither of us held the other responsible. At the time i was dating someone and B had also began dating the guy who she is still currently with. We congratulated one another and left it at that.

Then in June of this year(2025) B reached back out after I posted of myself for the first time in a few years. She was shocked on how different I looked. ( I did have somewhat of a glow up, new style, changed my hair, started working out more, and now have a lot of tattoos), not that important but its kind of all we talked about during that conversation. Before we ended the conversation B invited me to hang out so we could catch up face to face. I accepted the invitation and was excited to catch up after so long. We decided to meet at a local coffee shop we used to study at. Everything went great  we spent about an hour catching up  before we had to leave when the shop closed. We decided to keep talking in the parking lot before we knew it almost four hours had gone by. It was safe to say nothing had changed between us, we were both still very happy when around one another. 

This is when things changed. After that night we began talking every night. Both texting and facetiming. After a week of that one night we were facetiming and both fell asleep while on the call. We noticed when we both woke up around the same time and joked about it. As much as the first time it was accidental and was a joke the same thing happened every night for the next two weeks until one night things escalated. We were talking about our time together and about our hookups. B started asking if I remembered our time together. I told her yeah i did, and asked her if she did. She said yeah and alluded to the idea that she does on a regular basis. We began talking about relationships and she dropped a bomb on me. she told me that she regrets losing contact because she knows that we would be happy together if we never lost contact. As shocking as it was to hear given her relationship, i agreed because I honestly agree. 

The next three nights we didn't talk at night because we were both busy but we texted all day. The next time we face timed things escalated exponentially. Its important that I let you all know that B has always slept naked and has never been ashamed of people seeing her that way. Even before we were friends with benefits I had seen her naked while on call, It was never awkward for us but its very important for this story. This night on call we both became very flirty, we were joking about our time together and she was telling me how she missed our time together. I should have stopped it there but I didn't. Ill spare you the details but basically that night she masturbated with her vibrator while i talked her though it. Similar things happened for the next week while we were on call with one another sometimes lasting until early the following morning. During this B expressed multiple times how she felt guilty for doing this to her boyfriend   but clarified she didn't regret any of it because she knows she wants to do it. Again i should have stopped it but I didn't. Through all of this we flirted and teased one another during the day facetimed at night and sent pictures on nights we couldn't talk. it got to the point where her boyfriend complained that B hadn't been talking to him at night. She took a few days here and there to spend time with him but never stopped talking to me. 

Now the part where you couldn't think it would get worse this is the part where it does. Over the holiday B was home alone since her family was on vacation. Her boyfriend was away with his family. Then there was me, nothing to do facetiming with be at 2am and we decide to hang out we both agree that doing anything physical is a no go. Apparently we decided that what we did up to that point was ok but actually doing anything physical was crossing the line. Guess what, that didn't happen. We spent probably thirty minutes talking before things escalated. Again I'll spare you the details but we did have sex and after just talked about our feelings and what this meant for our friendship. 

I know there is no taking any of this back. The problem now is, B talks about how she loves her boyfriend despite his flaws she sees a future with him. She said that she knows she cant tell him even though they promised to be honest with one another if either of them cheated. On the other hand she talks about how she has feelings for me and doesn't want this to ruin our relationship(Her words not mine). I'm torn now, I think through this process I understood the severity of the situation but felt that she was loosing feeling for her boyfriend. Now seeing her so unsure of her feelings is honestly breaking my heart and I feel like i failed her as a friend in many ways. I will honestly say, if she told me she wanted to be with me i would accept that gladly, but seeing her struggle with her feelings for her boyfriend it would destroy me to see her heartbroken if she either broke up with him or lose him. 

I know that yes, this is the consequences of my actions but I honestly need advice on if I should give her space right now or help her figure out her feelings?

it’s like having an iced coffee in a well-designed café after a long walk. it’s that first bite of a new sandwich that turns out to be unexpectedly perfect. it’s looking up at the sky and seeing the clouds form into something breathtaking, as if the moment was meant just for you. it’s sitting in a quiet café, pausing to appreciate the stillness, realizing you’re the only one there and that life, in its rare calmness, is giving you something to treasure.

maybe that’s what draws me to you, even though i know we’ll never have the chance, and you’ll never read these words i write about you. you carry the same kind of appreciation, peacefulness, wonder, and beauty that life sometimes offers in fleeting moments—moments we can’t control, only surrender to, cherishing them before they pass.

* Keep Ghoul's smooth mobility and gap-closing a strength.

> Ghoul players just want to go fast and eat people. That isn't too much to ask.

* Replace the current grab-attack with something that can be allowed to be lethal without causing issues.

> ""Free injure but can't down"" is very difficult to get right. The closest thing to a good implementation is Plague, and even she has her issues.

* Give Ghoul an anti-loop ability that isn't just a statcheck.

> As it stands, Ghoul's vault is a boring binary that relies on an oversight (soon to be patched) to do anything at most tiles.
>
> If Ghoul can vault a after a survivor and get close enough to m1 before the survivor wraps back around, the power has insufficient counterplay.
> 
> If he *can't* do that, he doesn't really *have* antiloop, which isn't a great spot to be in.
>
> This is not an acceptable state of affairs.

**Power Changes**
-

**Kagune Leap Handling**

* **Buff:** Increased Kagune range by 1 meter (adjusted Handkerchief)
* **Buff:** Increased Kagune leap movement speed by 2 m/s (adjusted Coffee)
* **Buff**: Decreased Kagune's minimum environmental distance from 5 meters to 2.
* **Buff:** Attempting to perform a Kagune leap without targeting valid terrain no longer triggers a cooldown.
* **Buff:** Kagune can now latch onto mobile objects such as Exit Gates and rolling doors on The Game, provided they aren't currently moving.
* **Buff:** Increased the stickiness window for targeting terrain from 0.2 seconds to 0.3 seconds.
* **Buff:** Increased the reticle's detection sphere when targeting terrain from 0.2 meters to 0.5 meters. If a survivor is in the reticle, they take priority over terrain.

> All-round improvements to how the Kagune leaps handle. They already feel good, but there are certainly some pain points, especially in close-quarters.

**Kagune Maneuvers**

* **Nerf:** Reduced stickiness window for latching onto survivors from 0.18 seconds to 0 seconds.
* **Nerf:** Latching onto a survivor no longer applies a Hinder or Immobilize.
* **Change:** Replaced **Grab Attack** with **Kagune Cut-Off**.
 * Upon latching onto a survivor on a Kagune Leap past the first, The Ghoul leaps towards them as if he was latching onto terrain, losing collision until the end of his leap.
 * If the Ghoul passes through a survivor during this leap, they are staggered as if having fallen from a great height and The Ghoul's remaining leap distance is reduced by 50%, and Ghoul enters fatigue. Cut-off leaps always slide.

> With this, Ghoul can no longer just bite you for a free hit, but has some real potential for skill expression at a wide array of tiles.
>
> If he can aim well enough to latch onto you without aim-assist, he will launch himself past the survivor, forcing them to turn back. 
>
> The counterplay to this is that at close range, Ghoul will vastly overshoot their target. If the survivor reacts quickly to a close-range leap, they will be able to try and avoid what comes next... but Ghouls that know the geometry of a tile might catch themselves on a piece of terrain to end their Cut-off closer to the survivor. Long-range leaps offer less counterplay, but in turn are more difficult to latch on for in the first place.

* **Buff:** Performing a Kagune Vault no longer depletes or ends the power.
* **Change:** The Ghoul can now cancel their power mid-vault, which depletes and ends the power.
* **Nerf:** Kagune vaults no longer apply Bamboozle.

> This opens up a mind-game with the Kagune Vault.
>
> There are four basic options here.
>
> 1. Ghoul cancels mid-vault, and the survivor held W: the survivor likely makes a new resource unless it's a total deadzone.
> 2. Ghoul stays in power, goes for a cut-off, and the survivor held W: Ghoul probably ends his slide close enough to hit before they make it back to the window/pallet.
> 3. Ghoul stays in power to go for a cut-off, and the survivor doubles back: Ghoul overshoots drastically and the survivor gets back to the window.
> 4. Ghoul cancels mid-vault and the survivor doubles back: they walk directly into him and get smacked upside the head.
>
> A bit more to it than the old Ghoul's ""I vault after you and win/lose based on the length of the loop"".

* **Change:** After exiting your power, your next successful basic attack within 10 seconds will inflict a Kagune Mark and a Deep Wound as you rip a bite of flesh out of them.

> He has to enter enrage somehow.

----

**Add-on Changes**
-

*Unlisted = Unchanged*

* **Anteiku Apron:** Shortens the slide after Kagune Cut-Off by 25%.
* **The Black Goat's Egg:** While enraged, The Ghoul benefits from 15% additional break speed, but breaking a pallet depletes one additional token.
* **Blood-Stained Handkerchief:** Increases the mending time by 1.5 seconds.
* **Broken Chain:** In addition to the old effect, The Ghoul can end enrage at will by pressing the active ability button outside of his power.
* **Hinami's Umbrella:** No longer requires a perfectly-timed grab attack to extend the countdown.
* **Fresh Coffee:** You start the trial enraged for 60 seconds.
* **Red-Headed Centipede**: Survivors who finish a mend scream and have their aura revealed for 1 second.",0,1756874199.0,deadbydaylight,2,0.25,False

I had a Great Pyrenees named Bianca. I live in Florida, and my mom drove all the way to Tennessee to get her when she was 5 weeks old. I was 7, turning 8, at the time. She was the cutest little puppy; she looked fake because of how fluffy she was - like a stuffed animal. She was the most amazing dog ever. She had such a huge personality and was truly my baby. I fell in love with her the second she came home - just scooped her up and knew she would be my best friend. She was with me through losing friends, my parents' divorce, my dad moving out, moving 40 minutes away from my friends I grew up with and everything I knew. When I moved in 2018, it was just my mom, my younger sister, and I. My mom was working in insurance and during the summer, it was just me and my sister at the house. Every single morning, I would hear the garage door shut when my mom went to work. Within a minute, Bianca would be nudging my door open with her nose. If I was sleeping, she would just lay on my floor by my bed until I woke up, but if I was awake, she would hop in my bed. When she was in my bed, she was spoiled. She would lay right next to me with her head on a pillow, I would pull a blanket over her, and I would put a stuffed animal between her arms. I would watch movies and shows on the couch during the day, and she would just lay with me, following me around the house when I got up.

About a year ago I moved out of my mom's house and into my boyfriend's. My boyfriend was working for a lightning protection installation company, so he would have to be at work around 5 AM. So, when he would leave, I would go back home, sleep in my old room for 2-ish hours, then get up to have breakfast and coffee with my mom, see my dog, do any work I needed to do, shower, yada yada. Sometime during this, my mom told me she was no longer letting the dog on her bed because when she jumped off the previous night, she seemed to have lost her balance and she fell - which seemed to really disorient her, and my mom had to pick her up (this is a 110 pound dog we're talking about) Around this time my mom had been notified by our landlord that the rent would be raised by $700 a month starting in May, which was only 6 or so months away, at the time (the rent had been raised the previous year by $800 a month already - for a total of $1500 more per month since we had moved in). So, my mom decided to move in with her friend who lived in our neighborhood, just temporarily so she could save some money. Bianca was turning 12 in about 2 months at this time, so the move wasn't going to be too easy for her, we knew it may be an adjustment, since we had been in the same place for 7 years. It actually wasn't too bad, though, she was very familiar with my mom's friend and got used to living there really quickly. I have a video from the day we moved boxes in where she was chasing me around the house with a huge smile on her face. Soon after this, though, she started having some trouble walking outside (would just turn around to go home much quicker and take breaks in the grass, which she didn't do before), could not really get up on couches anymore, and we started to notice this mass growing on her back left leg - it was really hard, attached to the bone, and the size of a golf ball. My mom took her to the vet for bloodwork, which came back perfect; they said if they hadn't seen her, they would've thought the results were from a puppy, but did let us know that she had arthritis. She had also lost about 20 pounds since she last went to the vet, which had been a while. They tried to do a biopsy on the mass, but it was completely solid, nothing to take out of it. The only other option to determine what it was would be to put her under and surgically remove it, which they didn't suggest since she was so old, saying that surgery is very hard on senior dogs' bodies and if it did happen to be cancerous, cutting into it could cause the cancer to spread rapidly. So, we decided it was for the better to not put her through surgery and just keep an eye on it.

Now, 2 months later, she had only been eating every other day or every 3 days. She wasn't pooping as much, obviously, but when she would she was struggling to keep herself squatting/standing. She would sit or lay down and not be able to push herself back up to stand and often needed assistance. She was vomiting once or twice a week, which isn't a whole lot, but more than she used to. 2 weeks ago, she started pacing in the night, not sleeping at all, and then started barking in the middle of the night. My mom told me about this and I suggested we take her to the vet to see if we could get her medicated for nighttime or maybe just something general that could help her! This felt like a great solution to all the problems, so we made an appointment for 8:30 on Friday 08/29. We went in expecting to leave with medication or an appointment for a shot to maybe help with the arthritis. We also were hoping to get some information on the mass on her leg, as it had doubled in size at least, and was now the size of a baseball.

I walked in that morning, had coffee with my mom, got my dog and her packed up in my mom’s car and I drove separately because I was planning on going straight to work afterward. We weighed her when we got there, and she was only 78 pounds, which meant she lost another 12 pounds. You could feel her getting bonier, her hips and shoulders were prominent. They told us that if we were to start her on medication, it would have to be a pretty lengthy list: pain meds a couple times a day because of her size, nerve medication for the mass which may have been causing her leg to give out, nausea medication for those meds which would’ve been 2 pills every 8 hours. She would have been somewhere around 10-15 pills a day. She’s never had to take pills, maybe an antibiotic once for a couple days, but she was always reluctant. And since she wasn’t really eating, we couldn’t rely on putting meds in her food. We filled out a form to help us assess how we felt about her current condition, and our score fell into a “increasing concern” category. We started talking more about palliative care, and I began to explain that if putting her on 10 to 15 pills a day would give us another great year out of her, then I wanted to give it a shot. But knowing that giving her that many pills a day would stress her out, only getting a mediocre, stressful month or two, maybe, wasn’t worth it in our eyes. We didn’t want her to be drugged and a walking shell of a dog for the last while that we had her. We knew that would only create further complications and a sad and somber memory of her. The vet let us know that we were more likely to get a mediocre couple weeks from her by medicating her, and it just didn’t seem like the right move to us. She told us that she has learned that it is better to be a week too early than a day too late. She said it would be so much worse to come home to her dead, having died alone, or for her to fall over the holiday weekend and break something then have to haul her to an emergency room. So we knew what was best for her and her current state, and made the decision to put her down that day. They gave us chocolate and treats, but she wouldn’t eat them. I played with her and kept petting her for about 20 minutes until they came in and gave her a sedation shot. She was calm and just sat or laid down. My mom got on the floor with her, and I decided to leave the room while they were actually euthanizing her, assuming it may be traumatizing for me to watch her take her last breath. So I got down on the floor and said goodbye and kissed her head, told her I loved her, then left the room and waited in the lobby. After they did it, I went back in and kneeled down by her lifeless body. I held her paw and pet her head, and then i just laid on top of her and hugged her tight. I couldn’t stop sobbing, I’ve never cried that hard before. I remember my last glance of her as I walked out. This has been so hard for me and my mom, my sister is away at college and it’s just her and I, and we don’t live together right now, so we’re spending as much time together as possible. But I just haven’t stopped crying.

I keep going through all the things I could’ve done: I could’ve brought crackers for her to eat before she passed because she loved them, I could’ve brought a toilet paper roll because she loved to chew them, we could’ve taken her outside to lay in the grass one more time, we could’ve taken her for one last ride in the car, we never took her to the beach, she never had a burger, she never had chocolate. There are so many things we didn’t do that I can’t stop going through in my mind. I wish I would’ve held her longer before I left the room while she was still alive, I should’ve stayed in the room during the euthanizing, because I regret it now - not being in there for her last moment alive. I should’ve stayed the night at my moms the night before, I should’ve come over the day before. But I just didn’t know we would have to put her down that day, there was no prep time. We walked in with a dog and left without one. In a way, I’m glad we didn’t have time before that morning where we knew we were going to have to put her down. I feel this way because I know I would’ve been so sad and heartbroken before having to put her down, and I would’ve waited as long as I could, my last moments with her would’ve been so depressing and heart wrenching. Instead, she had a normal morning, a normal night before, a normal ride in the car. Nothing was being treated like a last, and I kinda like that. 

I’ve been a mess for the past 5 days. I can’t stop crying (my poor boyfriend), I’m not eating the same, I’m trying to stay busy but also don’t want to do anything, I’m getting behind in school, I can’t stop looking at pictures of her and I. I found a ball of her hair at the house, put it in a jewelry bag, and stuffed it in a stuffed animal that recently tore, and sewed it back up. It feels like I will always have a piece of her now. Nothing is really making my grieving process better, though. Anytime I’m alone I breakdown REALLY BAD. She was like a child to me. This feels like I lost my baby. She was there for everything and the one thing that never made me feel stupid or sad. I miss hugging her and I miss her bark. I’m not getting better, only worse. I’ve never ever dealt with a death of any sort, and I’m so sad my first one had to be my childhood dog. I keep catching myself cracking the front door open so she won’t run out, or thinking i hear her collar hit the floor, or thinking I see her in the corner of my eye. I am getting a tattoo for her on Friday, and I know that’s going to be so hard. I just can’t believe she’s gone. I never prepared for this day, it blindsided me so badly. And I am riddled with guilt for so many things: all the times I yelled at her to stop barking, all the times I told her to get out of my room, all of the times I didn’t come over because I was tired or “busy”, all of the walks I didn’t go on because I was in bed. I feel so guilty and so sad and I’m having trouble doing anything or talking to anyone about how I feel, in fear I’ll sound like a depressing broken record. I know it’s so dramatic, but how am I supposed to go on after this? How will I ever feel happy again? I know people say it just starts to happen and it starts to get easier, but it feels like no one has ever felt the pain i’m feeling. My eyes are sore to the touch from all the crying and I’m bringing myself to fever and sickness from crying so hard all day. How am i supposed to live after this? How am I supposed to do this? Nothing is helping, nothing is making this deep, deep pain go away. It sounds so over dramatic and attention seeking, but when I’ve been driving lately, I sometimes wish someone would hit me really hard, and all this pain would go away. I’m having such a hard time processing and regulating my emotions. Idk how I’m going to go back to work tomorrow. I miss my baby. I feel like I took her life for granted and like there was more I could’ve done. She was so different these last couple months. Just so much less life and personality. But still, I want my dog back. I want my baby. I wasn’t ready. Now i’ll be forever searching for her in everything I do. I’m absolutely heartbroken. ",6,1756874008.0,Petloss,4,0.88,False

My husband and I currently live in Harford county and we are really itching to leave. We are looking at cities east of Baltimore as my husband works at APG and would like to stay within 30-40 minutes from there. I currently work from home, but I am thinking about going back to school in Baltimore, so close access to the MARC is a bonus. 

We enjoy going out to restaurants and also love a good bakery/ coffee shop. We also try to be active so any particular city with great parks and outdoor activities would be a plus. 

Our max budget it 3.3k a month. I know with this budget we could afford a nice apartment, but we would really love to rent a house or townhome with a closed off backyard. We have a dog and would love to give him a yard when he can sunbath to his hearts content. Also would like a minimum 3 beds with a basement. Basement not required if the home has 4 bedrooms. A huge bonus would be a 2 car garage, but not needed. 

If you know of anything of anything. Please let me know! ",2,1756874001.0,BaltimoreCounty,0,1.0,False

**Inmate 347. Step forward.**

The voice echoed through the cold corridor, bouncing off stone and steel. I already knew who it was before I even looked up.

“Well, well, well… If it isn't JD. How’s our favorite murderer today?” Officer Daniels grinned with those chipped yellow teeth like he just told the funniest joke of his life.

“Oh, I’m just *great*, Daniels,” I said, rising slowly. “Had a five-star meal of whatever rat-slick garbage your kitchen passed off as food, and a luxurious nap on my slab of concrete. Real paradise.”

Daniels chuckled, tapping his baton against the bars. “Glad the red carpet treatment’s up to your high standards.”

He stepped inside. “You’re coming with me. We’ve got… *businessmen* here to see you.”

That got my attention. This place didn’t get visitors—especially not for me.

“Turn around. Hands behind your back. Slowly.”

I did as he asked. No point in fighting—yet. He cuffed my wrists tight enough to bleed my skin and shoved me forward. We walked through the gray guts of the penitentiary, fluorescent lights flickering overhead like they were rotting here the same as us. The whales of other inmates echoing the halls of the prison. A symphony of suffering that was imprinted into us.

Daniels pushed open the interview room door and sat me down hard into the steel chair. My wrists were clipped to the cold tabletop.

“You sit right here. They’ll be in shortly. If you misbehave...” he leaned in close, breath foul with chewing tobacco and cheap coffee, “you *will* be punished. Do I make myself clear?”

I glared up at him through my bruised eye. “Shove it up your ass, Daniels. I’ve got better things to do, so let’s move this along—”

*CRACK.*

His fist hit me clean across the cheekbone. My head snapped to the side, and stars danced behind my eyes. Blood welled in my mouth, copper and heat.

“Shut your mouth, scumbag,” he growled, shaking out his hand. “You sit there and be quiet… or I’ll give you another lesson in manners.”

He rubbed his knuckles and looked almost disappointed there wasn’t more blood. I spat red into the corner of the room and smiled through it.

“Good talk, Daniels.”

He didn’t respond. Just turned and left, the door slamming shut behind him with a heavy echo that sounded like a tomb sealing.

Now I was alone in that concrete coffin of a room, the cuffs biting into my wrists, the sting of the punch still fresh.

And waiting.

Waiting for whoever the hell would want to talk to a dreg of a man like me.

I ponder who could really be here for me after all this time. I had no family, no lover, just myself and my thoughts. I sat there in silence. The cold metal cuffs digging into my wrists. I scan the room looking for a sign of what's going on. I hear a loud buzz and a mechanical click as the door opens to a man in a checkered suit and a briefcase. He sits down at the other end of the table in front me and opens his case. Taking some files out and laying them on the table.

He scans the paperwork before saying ... 

“Good morning, Mr. Davis. How are you holding up?” His voice was smooth, almost rehearsed, as his eyes casually swept across the dim interrogation room. The slight smirk tugging at his lips told me he already knew the answer.

I leaned forward, shifting the cuffs clamped around my wrists. Glaring at the man with a defensive rage, welling up from inside. I had seen plenty of suits over the years, lawyers, and public officials but he was different. An abnormality in these halls, someone who reeked of something dark and sinister. “Well, besides the bruises and concrete slab, and shit food, I’m doing just fine. Who the hell are you, and what do you want with me?”

He chuckled softly, like he’d heard this a hundred times. “For convenience’s sake, you can call me Mr. McCreedy. I’m here with a proposition.”

That got my attention. I raised an eyebrow, wary but intrigued. “Yeah? And what kind of *proposition* are we talking about?”

He placed a sleek black folder on the table, tapping a manicured finger against it. “I’ve reviewed your file. Impressive rap sheet. Armed robbery, suspected manslaughter, and a laundry list of other crimes from your youth. You're not exactly model citizen material, Mr. Davis.”

I didn’t respond. He didn’t need me to. My eyes never wavering from his as he prattled on about my mis deeds. I've heard it all before and this was no different, like a tape recording on loop.

“You’re never getting out of this place,” he continued, his tone turning sharper, colder. “But here’s the part where things get interesting. I’m offering you a choice.”

He paused, just long enough to let the silence stretch tight.

“Option one: rot in this shithole for the rest of your natural life. Or…” He leaned in, eyes gleaming. “Come work for me. Do a job. Dangerous, yes. But if you live, we can have you released from this... lovely establishment.” 

His eyes wandering the small room, a soft chuckle escaped his lips. He was certain whatever he offered was better than life inside here.

I stared at him, searching his face for a crack, a sign of bullshit. But all I saw was ambition and something darker behind his eyes.

“What kind of job?” I finally asked.

He smiled wider. “The kind you’re perfectly suited for.”

McCreedy let out a long, theatrical sigh, like I’d just asked him to explain gravity.

“My boy,” A southern twang to his words, he began, pacing a slow circle around the room, “you’d be coming to work for my mining company.”

He paused, gauging my reaction, but I gave him nothing.

“The other workers,” he continued, “are… Well, let’s call them *peers* of yours. Inmates. From this fine establishment and a dozen other overcrowded facilities across the state. Overpopulation breeds creativity, you see. So the state and I made a little arrangement.” He smiled, a venomous grin now plastered his face once more.

“In exchange for labor,” he said, “you get a shot at lets call it freedom... Simple, really.”

I stayed silent, waiting for the catch I could already feel pressing against my spine.

“But this isn’t just any mine, Mr. Davis.” His voice dropped, gaining a weight it hadn’t had before. “It’s a *special* place. We extract a material unlike anything else on Earth. It’s called *Necronium*—a blood-red crystal with... fascinating properties.”

He reached into his coat and placed a photo on the table: a jagged shard, dark crimson and pulsing faintly like a heartbeat trapped in stone.

I took the photo in my hands, chains digging into me as I lifted it to get a good look at it. It was... something I'd never seen before, it was a beautiful crystal to say the least. Elegant but full of something unknown, otherworldly.

“It generates immense power. Something that could power cities and armies alike for generations to come. But more interestingly… It alters biology. DNA. Cells. Behavior. We’re still studying the full extent of what it can do. What it’s done.” He gave a dry chuckle that didn’t reach his eyes. “Let’s just say: it’s the future. Nothing you need to worry about yourself my boy. Just know you'd be doing your country proud with your... voluntary service.” His sickly grin almost mocking me.

My jaw tightened, instinct warning me to run—though I was cuffed, caged, and nowhere near the wild mountains he was describing.

“You’d be briefed on the details if you accept. But understand this: *any* breach of secrecy, *any* attempt to escape, or even talk about this outside my chain of command… and your punishment will be *severe*.”

I gave a small nod, buying time, thinking. This was insane. But the more he talked, the more I realized—there was no way out of this cell, or my sentence, unless I played the game.

McCreedy leaned in closer. “You should also know… My father, bless his soul, invested a fortune in this mine before his *untimely* passing. A legacy, you could say.”

“The mine needs constant labor,” he went on, “and it’s hidden deep in the Appalachians, far from any eyes that might ask the wrong questions.”

He paused again, letting the silence grow heavy.

“You’ll live in a town beneath the surface—an underground community built around the mine. That will be your home. Your prison, if you want to be poetic.”

I looked him dead in the eye, and for a moment, his smile faded.

“And make no mistake,” he said, voice now flat and cold, “the state is in on it. They get their piece, I get mine. And you… you get your freedom.”

He stepped back and smoothed the front of his immaculate checkered suit.

“But should you agree to this… *I own you.* Body and soul will belong to the McCreedy name... is that understood?.”

I nodded again weighing the options in my head, the allure of release making my decision a biased one. 

Life in Prison or life as an indentured worker I thought to myself. I look into Mr. McCreedy’s eyes, does this... town at least have a bar? His wicked smile grew at the question, he leaned back in his seat and chuckled. Well of course Mr. Davis, you will  have some freedoms here, Including a bar as you asked. You will have your basic needs met I can assure you. “You convicts are so simple minded, have your needs of, women and booze met there isn't anything you wouldn't do am I right?” He glanced at me with a cocky gaze. A light chuckle escaped his lips at his supposed superiority. 

A flare of rage at the insults threatened to burst forth but I contained myself. Throwing away a choice was an idiotic path to choose so I stayed silent. Bitter resentment towards a man who didn't know me, my life, my suffering. Mocking me as if I was shit off his shoe. 

I let out a deep sigh before looking at him again. Fine I accept the offer, now when can I get out of here... He cuts me off. Hold your horses my boy, you'll have to fill out some paperwork, NDA’s, various agreements Etc. 

Another deep sigh escapes me, “fine get me a pen and get these fucking cuffs off me.”

With a nod Mr. McCreedy stood walking over to me before sliding me a pen and a stack of documents. He then signals a guard to relieve me of my shackles. I look at him again, His venomous smile boring into me. The light of the room burying me in his shadow, Welcome to the family Mr. Davis. Before he turns locks up his briefcase and exits the room. The heavy metal door clicking into place behind him. 

Officer Daniels swaggered in like he owned the place a moment later, that same greasy grin plastered across his face. He walked over, keys jangling like wind chimes, and undid my cuffs with theatrical flair.

“Well, well,” he said, smirking. “Looks like you've cut yourself a deal, good for you.” His tone is almost mocking and yet sad in a way. As if he would miss having another prisoner to torment.

“Fuck you Daniel's, you slimy pig motherfucker. At least I can finally be free of one shitty thing in my life.” My tone, harsh, cold, and bitter.

A mocking laugh escaped his lips as he stepped back, hands on his hips like he was proud of me. “Gonna miss having you around, 347.” He wiped fake tears from his eyes before chuckling again and turning toward the door.

“Oh, and your release?” he added over his shoulder. “Two months’ time.” He laughed again loudly seeing my face drop, the realization I'd still have a few more months of misery.

And just like that, he was gone, leaving me alone with the weight of my decision. The door locked behind him as his shoes clicked down the echoing hallway. Leaving me in silence with the steady buzz of the electric lights overhead.

I stared at the papers for a long while. Everything felt strangely still—like the world was holding its breath. My fingers twitched. Then slowly, deliberately, I reached for the pen. With one fluid motion, I signed my name. The second time in my life I’d sold myself off—once to the system, now to something darker.

The guards came back, silent and indifferent, collecting the documents and leading me back to my cell. A stone box with a toilet and a slab of concrete and a shitty mattress. But for the first time in years, I knew I had an end date.

Time in prison moves in broken rhythms. Days stretch like pulled muscle, minutes shrink to nothing, then explode into weeks. You don’t live in prison. You *wait.* You wait for food, for sleep, for beatings, for boredom to finally kill you. A countdown. Sixty days, then something new. Maybe worse, maybe not. But different.

When the day came, I was ready. Or as ready as a man can be walking into the unknown.

The guards came early, gruff and mechanical. I didn’t say goodbye. There was no one to say it to. They led me out, past dead-eyed inmates and cold steel, until the walls opened up and we stepped into the raw gray morning air of the helipad. 

I breathed deeply, shutting my eyes and feeling the breeze, listening to the sounds around me. The outside world felt new to me, now that my situation would finally be changing.

A dozen other inmates were already there. Some I recognized and some were strangers to me. Mobsters, lifers like me, Killers, rapists, everything under the sun. All of us scum in our own respects but all now signed onto a single purpose. Desperate for change, for freedom. We all signed the same paper, shook the same hands. We worked for the company now and our new handler, Mr.McCreedy. 

For a moment, I let myself believe I was different. But my time in prison with my thoughts had warped that perspective years ago. I thought back on my first days once more, how it felt like a lifetime ago. Back when I thought I was different. I chuckled softly to myself, what a fool I was.

My eyes rose at an approaching thrum, a distant beat of something... no, a helicopter approaching.

It was military-grade—sleek, green, and powerful. When it landed, the wind hit us like a slap. Armed guards poured out, barking orders, grabbing us by the arms and shoving us into a crude formation.

We were herded aboard like cattle, each chained to the cold metal seats lining the interior. Boots stomped. Names were called. One by one, confirmed. Then the green light.

The engine roared to life, and we lifted from the helipad.

I craned my neck and got one last look at the prison—just a concrete box in the middle of nowhere. I smiled. The structure of suffering shrinking into the distance. Whatever waited for me in the Mines, at least I wouldn’t be behind those walls anymore. The rear hatch closed shut as we drifted off to our destination.

I leaned back against the humming bulkhead and shut my eyes.

This was going to be a long ride into my new life.

Many hours later, I awoke to turbulence rattling through the cabin. The metallic groan of the transport craft shuddered around me as a voice crackled over the intercom:

“Approaching LZ in five minutes. All personnel, prepare to disembark.”

I forced my eyes open. Outside the frosted window, jagged white mountains rose like teeth, their peaks lost in storm clouds. Smoke curled in the distance, black stains against the snow. As we descended lower, I caught sight of a landing pad, squat buildings clustered around what looked like a small outpost.

The rear hatch opened with a hiss. Cold air knifed into my lungs, sharp enough to sting. A dozen guards stood waiting in formation, weapons slung and eyes hidden behind red lenses of their gas masks.

And then I saw him.  The checkered suit. The smug grin. Mr.McCreedy.

He strode aboard as though he owned the air itself, clapping his hands together with mock warmth. “Welcome, gentlemen! Welcome to my facility. This is your new home now.” His grin sharpened as he scanned the line of shackled prisoners—until his eyes landed on me.

“Commander,” he barked, “get them onto the trucks and take them into town. And keep a *very* close eye on this one.” He jabbed a finger in my direction. “He’s our newest member. I want to make sure he receives a *proper welcome.*”

The commander grunted behind his red eyes, giving me a glare that made my stomach twist. He raised a gauntleted fist, signaling the guards. Shackles came loose. Rifles pressed into our backs.

McCreedy leaned close as I was pushed past him, his grin never wavering. “The winter storms can be brutal here. Stay warm, won’t you? The trip to town shouldn't take long.” He chuckled, boarding the chopper again. The hatch slammed shut, the rotors screaming as the craft lifted away, leaving us behind.

A hard blow struck the side of my head. “Move,” a guard growled.

I stumbled into line, boots crunching through the snow toward the waiting trucks. Prisoners huddled in the rear, silent, shivering. I climbed in after them, and the cabin doors clanged shut. The loose canvas covering the truck, blowing in the wind as the icy frost drilled into us.

The engine roared, the truck grinding its way down the icy pass. And as the convoy rumbled toward the black mouth of the mountain, one thought gnawed through my skull. “At least it will be warmer inside.” I said to myself between chattering teeth.

The road narrowed as we drew closer, until the looming shadow of the mine’s entrance swallowed the convoy whole. The colossal blast doors dominated the cliffside, towering three or four stories high, making the surrounding buildings look like children’s toys scattered in the snow.

The convict beside me leaned closer. “Hey—What's your name?”

I turned and fixed him with a glare. In prison, a glare was better than words. It established boundaries. Keep people cautious. He only smiled in return.

I turned my gaze back to the floor of the truck, I spoke low and in a defensive tone. “John Davis, but just call me JD.”

“Barry Gallagher,” he said. I took another glance at the man, I noticed a faded four-leaf clover tattoo on his arm. “Quite a setup they’ve got here. That McCreedy fellow wasn’t lying about the size of this place.”

I didn’t reply. My eyes drifted towards the blast doors as the truck slowed to a crawl. The storm raged around us, snow whipping across the metal surface like a swarm of white insects.

Then— A siren blared, sharp enough to echo through the mountains in the whiteout. Three heavy, metallic *clangs* followed, each echoing through the mountain like the knell of a church bell. The locks releasing, the grinding of gears rolled out next, deep and ancient, like a buried colossus stirring awake.

The doors cracked apart. A rush of hot air hissed out, carrying with it the acrid smell of diesel and ash. The guards said nothing. We waited. For nearly a minute the air was filled only with the howl of the blizzard and the endless grind of machinery.

Finally the driver began moving once more. The truck rumbled forward.

We crossed the threshold into darkness. The warmth hit us instantly as I rubbed my hands together to warm up. The massive door began to close, sealing off the outside world above. A loud clang of the door closing and locking echoed down the shaft.

At first it was absolute—thick black, suffocating. But then the overhead lamps began to click on one after another, like starlight in the void above us. My eyes burned as they adjusted, and I finally saw the cavern yawning out around us. The tunnel was as vast as the doors themselves, the walls jagged and damp, the steel reinforcement ribs disappearing into the black. 

We drove deeper. The doors behind us shrank until they were nothing but a memory. Sunlight slipped out of sight. The pathway down lights clicking on and off as we were guided downwards.

After what felt like hours, the faint murmur of distant voices and the glow of town grew ahead. The truck rumbled onto a stretch of flat road, revealing a barred gate sealing the entry to town.

A rusted sign swung above the gate, swinging in the heated breeze that flowed through the caverns.

The savage kind that laughs at your cries, and is glad if you died – he’s truly an evil mad hatter by design
He’s a business man living on an island hosting five hundred and five – so everyone knows his havoc ways
But setting foot on that airplane that had been delayed – they wouldn't know - what would happen that day..

Arthur had arrived on the plane with a smug on his face – all because his private departure was late
He sat on the back seat - opposite of where the flight attendant should be – so she’d have to walk back and forth through the lane
“Is my coffee ready yet”!? He yelled across the plane in disdain – not caring about the dismay of the lady who served him
“Coming right away sir” – she said with pain in her words – wishing he wouldn't treat her like a slave or a servant!

5 Hours have passed since Arthur has been on the plane – now he's drinking champagne and writing down notes
But not for his job – No – he’s writing down quotes – so his arsenal of mass verbal weaponry grows
“The people of my island are all idiots – so after this trip – I'll leave with my riches and give nothing to them”
Well maybe the mayor – I’ll leave him a prayer – where he turns to vapors or chokes on his phlegm!”

Suddenly while writing – Arthur hears a loud noise – which falters his poise - and sends him in distress
“What was that sound, you better tell me right now, land this plane on the ground!!” - Arthur yells very upset!
Next thing you know – the engine combusts into flames - This must be the reason the flight was delayed!
(Pilot) “Brace for impact – we are going to crash - God I haven’t been bad - save me with your grace!!!!”

*CRASH*

The plane crashes face first on a deserted island – killing the flight attendant - and pilot in the cockpit
But out of the rubble comes Arthur – injured and noxious – glad that he's survived this violent process
“That was a close call, but my left arm is fractured – and my forehead is bleeding faster and faster
I must find a medical kit – for tissue and making a splint – he quickly thinks looking at the disaster

Scouting the plane – Arthur finds the supplies he needs to survive – and nurtures himself back to good health
“Where am I exactly”? He says to himself – I better find a radio and call for some help
Yet he finds nothing but debris and ash from the plane, so he tries to call from his cellular phone
But there’s no signal in these vast parts unknown, as he looks around to realize…he’s alone

Finally...

""Finally! I'm free from every human being!"" Arthur screams ecstatically while running on white sand
""I'm free from all imbeciles, simpletons, and infidels"" - he screams following a maniacal laugh
But as soon as Arthur's celebration is finished - he realizes just what that really means
It means that as long as he's stuck on this desolate island - not a single soul will ever be seen!

This can't be...

""This can't be!"" Arthur cries in denial - ""It's only me on this island? That I just can't believe!""
He scours day and night for someone alive – passing through vines and coconut leaves
Finding no-one – he shades himself with a tree to hide from the blistering sun - and sits idly on a stone
Looking deep into the Ocean with his mind Trapped in a zone - he wishes that he was - safely back home

5 months pass and Arthur is running out of of hope - he doesn't want to live here - melancholic and broke
For being alone had damaged his soul - but changed him into an actual human being with a pulse
""I'm sorry - I just want to go home"" he says everyday - "" I promise I'll never have hate or anger displayed""
As he walks devil's sand with a coconut in his hand - he begins to kneel down and give God his praise..

That's it...

""That's it""! As Arthur finishes praying - his mind sparks revelation - so he gets up and sprints towards the plane
Looking in a craze - he finds the tools he was rummaging for - a pen, paper and empty bottle of champagne!
But instead of merely writing ""help"" on the note - he writes an atonement for everyone on his island - even the Mayor he hated the most
""I'm sorry everyone for my hateful - disgraceful - frivolous quotes - especially you - The Mayor Of My Home!""

Signed, Arthur

And so the bottle is sent out to sea - a bottle atoned - going where the crashing waves take it
Till 5 months later it washes up on a Beach - intact with the note - not broken nor tainted
It's picked up by a man in a suit - who was looking at fish - but the sparkling bottle he couldn't resist!
He opens and reads it - then says while balling a fist - ""Wait till' everyone on the island hears about this!""

You're forgiven, Arthur.

Andrew James Flores, with a message from the Lord...

The God of Israel is righteous and blameless; he has placed and secured a safe time for the ages
His pious is sacred, for he has been The God of man; since the beginning of time was created
His word is worth infinity, one with the bible, having the world; yearned with serenity
He is everything man is seen; creating the land and seas, and having the earth birthed with divinity.

The Land:

The land is bright green; the golden sun shines on it with care and prosper
The land’s flowers bloom, and plants take their state; inhaling the air and water
The great trees stand tall; as the beautiful animals are kissing his plan
Everything is serene; in the state of the fling, as God plants seeds of bliss on the land.

The Sea:

The sea is bright blue, the golden sun shimmers on the waters with splendor
The sea’s wonders are such vast; it diminishes fire; if it’s caught in an ember
The ocean’s carry sea animals in loving joy; for the happiness and glee of father
The sea is great, as a meaning offered; for water without salt, is drinking water.

Man:

The Genesis: Adam and Eve were created by God; human beings from his hand
They are people of his reign; blossomed from the seeds of the land
Everything is splendid, and beautiful, as everything harbors a reason
Everyone is sacred, humans, and animals; in the Garden of Eden.

Animals:

The animals, sacred and one; living from the sea and land
Lions and whales, they accompany us graciously, as they provide the glee of man
Man lives in unity with them; as they have a pious will
We sear the sheep for lines of silk, and grab the goats; providing milk.

Heaven:

Heaven; a golden sun shimmers splendidly with joy, on each building and person
This is where gracious people go, one’s with faith for God; the afterlife for mortals; if you’re worthy in worship.
Angels fly with fortitude for God; giving blessings to everyone they see
People pray passionately; as this is where everyone’s in eternal peace.

Hell:

Hell; a fiery place; where the golden sun doesn’t shine; for there is already flame
This is where sinners belong; as the devil torments and tortures you in the deadliest way
Demons taunt and count your days; as you wonder when all the burning will cease
Yet you must know; that this is where all sinners; burn for eternity.

Paradise:

Paradise; a wonderful place; where everything and everyone is happy and magnificent
This is where people who lived joyous lives belong; yet didn’t know God; but still they were embellishing.
Everyone is safe and secure; as they look at a golden sun and, empyrean sky
Everyone and everything prospers together; this is paradise.

Purgatory:

Purgatory, a place where the golden sun is cast; it is neutral in strength
For this is where people who lived normal lives go; doesn’t matter if it was for God or for them; they enjoyed their length
They know they have to follow the rules; and keep looking at the blaring skies
For they can follow God’s rule, and go to Heaven or paradise.

Andrew James Flores:

I am Andrew James Flores; poet and, philosopher; always filled with happiness and joy
It is my fulfillment to write for God; and help secure his word, and magnificent voice
That is his plan for me; to prosper in every way, and to hold the golden sun
For he has made me a pious semi-god; and valuable chosen son.

The Ending:

The God of Israel came to me long ago; seeking someone to spread his word
I have done so, through my writing’s and the church; and he has my essence firm
In return he has anointed me Semi-God; to reign on the earth in splendor
I am going to teach everyone with my bible; and they will have scripture to remember.

Armageddon:

Armageddon; a fiery war will run its course; between good and evil; heaven and hell
Angels will fight demons on earth; and you will be an essence who dwells
Everything will change; as God’s army abolishes sin
It is coming close; and heaven will prosper; as everyone proceeds with the godliest men.

God; pious with divinity; Andrew James Flores; pious with divinity; we are both the same as you can tell; caught in ripples
He has made everything; I will make the future; we are both interchangeable; yet never mistake our identities; for I am Andrew James Flores; as-well as....

The God of Israel.

“You are lost in the depths of darkness; this desolate valley is an endless margin
Only you again - can become light’s presented target, or end up a leper’s carcass.
Broaden your horizons over the horizon, and seek The Lord as your saving grace
For your life is precious, embrace your lake; only then can you change your fate”

The Black Moon, suddenly disappeared, for I'd dissipated my fear, and the magnificent horizon had never looked more clear
I followed it for miles on end, it was pleasantly revered – yet one of my footnotes were not too sincere.
For I decided near my heart’s lake to write poems against my God – and there was no doubt, his descendants saw
So The Black Moon descended again; a method called, and the beautiful horizon might as well been a sent mirage.

Many serene white moons have passed; where I've seen the Black Moon; descend in my slumber
How I wished for the horizon, or maybe I should have prayed - to have it by the end of the summer
I want to ascend from rubble - my heart's lake quenches holy waters from the heavens
Yet my soul refuses to quit-infusing with sin - denying the help from a church or a reverend.

Yes, I didn't turn to a Methodist, or turn to a Methodist - to repent for my sins
Instead I dabbled in sex, fighting, and alcoholism, all coming from the hellish depths of within'
I continued to write blasphemous poems near my heart's lake, while watching skeletons subside in the surface
Maybe it was time I realized scrutinizing is worthless, and lived with the intent of finding a purpose.

Living with the intent of finding a purpose to live, what are the gifts - that journey will give?
Will it be a serpent that slithers in the crevice of rifts, or holy water for extinguishing the hell's fire - burning my crypt.
I see the ghastly Black Moon, hover over my heart's lake, and the whistling wind is trapping my breath
Maybe one day, I'll see the beautiful horizon again, glistening over this valley of death.

Many serene white moons have passed, and the Black Moon descended over my self
The sky was starless, maybe it was meant for me - as a phoenix from ash arose for my health
Devilish memories flooded the lake of my heart; as demons appeared out of dirt from the valley
Even he himself; Satan in the flesh, waited for my breath - for he felt I deserved a finale!

Yes, I am freighted of my demons and devil(s), but I must face them - face to face
For I know with you, Lord - and the savior's flame, I will have a saving grace.

Seraphim's response:

We've heard your cry, thy bless'ed son - the tides of your heart's lake have rendered much
May you follow the magnificent horizon, ascend and such - and feel The Lord's tender touch.
Your dreams beckon, reach out for the valley of death to prosper, passed the clouds and tests of somber
For you are one with Heaven's father, and with him - evil, will be forever conquered.",1,1756873759.0,u_Due-Caterpillar3962,0,1.0,False

The story is about Kenshin marrying Kaoru through an arranged marriage. Still, they were married for a time when Kaoru decided to run away (leaving divorce papers) because she thought Kenshin still loved Tomoe (in fact, she became an alcoholic because of it). He later finds her when she owns a coffee shop and is a single mother to Kenji. 

Details I remembered:

Everyone called Kaoru crazy in her new small town because she collected things, like pictures and news articles, about Kenshin; in fact, it is worse because their son has red hair. 

Kenshin is ""married"" to Tomoe when he finds Kaoru again, but they both decide to fake the marriage because Kenshin never signed the divorce papers, and Tomoe is in love with Akira (her ex-boyfriend who came back from a trip and wants to try again).

Sano and Megumi are Kenshin's friends, while Aoshi and Misao are Kaorus (they meet in her new town), Aoshi is Kaorus's divorce lawyer when Kenshin finds her.

So no one can find her, she lost contact with her family, and she only sees them when she comes back, after Kenshin found her; Yahiko is her brother.

While they were together, Kaoru's family lost their fortune, and his dad made a scheme to fake an affair between Kenshin and Tomoe (something that didn't happen; they were meeting because he wanted to help Tomoe with Akira).

Kaoru thinks that Kenshin is in love with Tomoe because he lets his picture be taken with her at events and things like that

Enishi thinks that Kenshin is a bad guy and is stringing Tomoe along, so against Tomoe's wishes, he decides to do a scheme about inviting Kaoru out. ",1,1756873575.0,lostfanfiction,0,1.0,False
1n75b54,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1n75b54/i_ruined_a_relationship_at_my_best_friends_funeral/,I ruined a relationship at my best friends funeral,"Six months ago my (35F) best friend (36F) passed away after a difficult battle with cancer. We were as close as friends could possibly be. My life still feels like it has an empty hole that only she could fill, and I don’t think that will ever change. 

Obviously, on the day of the funeral I was an emotional wreck. I was pretty cried-out so mostly I just kind of went through everything in a daze and tried to get through it the best I could. I’m very close with her son (6M) and I wanted to be strong for him while I was near him. I was doing a great job, too. Until her brother in law and his gf came over to talk to me. 

Years ago, he and I had a weird situationship that never really went anywhere, but even though it’s been over 10 years, I have never felt as strong of a connection with anyone else since. Well, he hugged me and I basically broke down and started crying about everything and then I told him I didn’t want to regret it if he never knew how much he really meant to me. He kind of gave me a deer in headlights look and I apologized and excused myself. 

That was pretty much it until about a week later when he messaged me saying he had broken things off with his girlfriend and wanted to get coffee if I would be open to it. We’ve now been official for a little over 4 months and even though I hate how it happened and feel bad for his ex, I’m so happy. I really believe he is the love of my life. I only wish my best friend could be here to see it because she always told me we’d find our way back to each other. Well Ava, looks like you were right. ",7,1756873445.0,offmychest,2,0.82,False

It always worked for a few days. Then I’d miss one thing, feel like I blew it, and abandon the whole system. Cue burnout, guilt, and the cycle starting again.

What’s actually helped is shrinking the scale:

* Drinking water before coffee
* Taking one slow breath before opening my laptop
* Writing just one line in a notebook before bed

Tiny stuff. Almost silly. But it’s the only thing I’ve been consistent with and slowly, it built a foundation I could actually stick with.

I once read in The Quiet Hustle that “progress doesn’t come from doing more, it comes from doing less, with intention.” That line gave me permission to stop chasing perfect systems and just focus on small steps.

Anyone else here find that tiny, repeatable actions worked better for you than big “life overhauls”?",38,1756873213.0,ADHD,3,1.0,False
