I was wondering if non-students are able to use spaces on campus to work? If so, what are the best places to get work done?

If it’s anything like Mac was then the answer is technically anyone could go into basically any building. I’d imagine some wouldn’t like this since campuses are super busy as it is which is valid but I want some more spots other than a few coffee shops to work lol.

Any comments are appreciated!

**My (34M) bf is upset with me (32F) because I didn't make his plate and serve it to him during Christmas**

&#x200B;

Where do I go from here? Our 5 year anniversary is a couple weeks from now and we have a 2 year old. I didn't know anything was wrong until we started the 5 hr drive home after spending the holidays with my family. He was quiet pretty much the whole way and snapped at me when I asked why he was following too close behind a vehicle, and also driving fast.

As soon as we get home he leaves without a word for a couple hours, gets back and says he went to the mall to buy a couple more gifts and some shoes for himself. I'm annoyed because I have been telling him for weeks to pick out shoes and I will buy them for his upcoming birthday\* he's really hard to shop for and picky about his clothes. So I asked him why he bought himself shoes when I wanted to buy him some as a gift. He says in rude tone "" send me 100 then because that's how much they were ""

I finally ask him what his problem was and he was upset that I didn't make him a plate. I spent over 4 hours cooking for my whole family, also cooked for xmas eve the day before. I was tired. The holidays are exhausting. I couldn't believe he was upset about that, he seemed annoyed on boxing day because we ordered pizza and I made a plate for my stepfather who uses a cane, I told him to make himself a plate and he just sat there. He also said I barely looked at him during our visit and if I did, I didn't smile or look at him lovingly. Like I said I was tired, my 2 year old was also extra clingy so I felt overstimulated and just tried to be present with my family.

Lastly he was mad because I didn't go sledding with him and my family, I stayed back with my sister and baby niece and we watched a rom com. I wanted to relax and have some me time, and he was upset about that, saying I just wanted to go on my phone, which I did, I got to watch tiktoks and just scroll for a bit.

Any way, after we got home and had this conversation, I left upset and went to have dinner by myself while he took our child for a walk, as soon as I got home he left again and didn't come back for 4 hours. We have barely spoken and I don't want to be the one to sit down and start this conversation, to coddle him and make him feel better. I'm so sick of this, where do I go from here?

Why are you allowing this toxic relationship to continue? He’s a grown adult, he can get his own plate.\*

>OOP: It's my first long term relationship, my first love, I asked myself this question as well. Low self esteem perhaps, but I've just started therapy again so I'm hoping things will get better for my mental health.

&#x200B;

**LadyKlepsydra**

*Sounds like you are a servant to him, not a partner. Considering his age, this most likely comes from deeply rooted misogyny and won't change. Watch out for isolation attempts. The way he didn't like you taking some ""me time"" with YOUR family, but wanted you to be with him and HIS family instead, doesn't bode well. Do not prioritize his family over yours, is my advice. You don't want to end up isolated from your closest people with a controlling, sexist man, and it seems like you may end up exactly there.*

&#x200B;

**lazyBee94**

*This this this! Be careful OP - his behaviour is so outrageous, it shouldn’t be acceptable. He was angry that you weren’t at his beck and call at all times as the „woman“ and this will only get worse. Please dump his ass - you will do so much better without him.*

>OOP: Your right, he has trauma from his mother and I feel like he hates me sometimes when all I do is work, cook for my family, take care of our child\* paying for daycare and drops offs and pick ups \* and stay home. He always finds something to be mad about with me, if he isn't being jealous then he's mad I don't clean enough, or want some alone time.

Like an absolute dumb ass, I stayed, I cried my eyes out and told him I how I felt and he didn't have anything to say, just that he's sorry and will do better.

We were okay for a week, today is our five year anniversary, well would have been, he broke up with me today. I've had to stay home all week with our child because of a parasite and waiting for tests, on Thursday I got sick and still am sick with what feels like a chest cold/infection. The morning of our anniversary he goes rock climbing, I don't know what time he left but was gone until noon, I was pissed and texted him it would have been nice to have help while I rested. I cancel the reservations I made to the restaurant that we met at. When I told him this he ripped up the card he got me, told me he's going to stay elsewhere and we're done.

He said I am miserable and just want to be sad and that I make him pay with all the ways my dad failed me. \* my father could care less about me and I have daddy issues lol\*

I don't think I'm being unreasonable for expecting him to spend the whole day or coming back early from climbing. I didn't even get a good morning, happy anniversary text. But it is what it is.

Anyways, yall were right, I knew it in my heart but didn't want to believe it. There's no coming back from this but I'm okay ❤️ thank you for letting me vent and for all of your advice !!! It's nice to come back and read all the positive support.

*Just hold your head high and move forward. When he ""changes his mind"" hold firm. Talk to a lawyer about child support, etc.*

*You can do this. You've seen who he is now. Don't let yourself unsee it. I believe in you, and you deserve all good things.*

*He sounds like a man child. Now he's gone, I almost guarantee you'll start thriving. With him not around putting you down, draining your energy and self esteem, you'll start noticing a difference.*

>OOP: Thank you, just gotta get over the sad part. I was the best version of myself when I met him, I've lost myself in this relationship but I feel ready to move forward.

&#x200B;

**Beneficial-Knee6797**

*He’s right on one thing and that has to do with your disappointment with your father. If we have a neglectful or abusive father we tend to see those wonderful things about a new man as familiar, the things that gave us happiness in childhood but in reality it is our little child heart yearning for the attention and and possibly love and protection of our father. The promise is empty and in fact the new guy is enamored of you based on the same criteria. If you had known this about each other and still wanted to go ahead you could have gone to couples counseling. I hope you will get some therapy for codependency before you get into another relationship because if you don’t you and your little boy will continue to suffer. If you still have unresolved issues with your father now is probably the best time for you to work through those things. If the problems with dad are alcohol related you would find the best and strongest support at Alanon which is the family program connected to AA, Alcoholics Anonymous which is all free and the best treatment you can get. To read:*

*Codependent No More* 

*Getting the alive You Want*

>OOP: My father chose a horrible woman a step mom for us, he had a new family and just doesn't care to be an active father or grandfather to his previous kids. I've told my ex how all I ever wanted was for my dad to try harder to be present in our lives, to be a positive male figure in my life, and I've said maybe my expectations of my ex were too high, but all I asked for was care and consideration in the relationship, and communication.

&#x200B;

**Mundane-Currency5088**

*He isn't being a stable considerate partner. You can't count on him. His mood keeps shifting. He seems unstable.*

>OOP: Yes to all of this. I feel like most people would expect their partner to put them first on an anniversary and most people do. I also made breakfast for us that morning and he texted me ""why would you make me breakfast when I told you I was going climbing"" Any other day I would not have made a big deal, maybe I overreacted by canceling the reservations that I made for us, but I was sick and felt overwhelmed because my baby would not stop breastfeeding off me when I was having a coughing fit, I was angry at him in the moment.

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

She didn’t finish school and was a stay-at-home mom to five kids for the past 15 years. She mentioned that she had no prior knowledge about finance and started the business to support her family.

She grew up in poverty, but now she drives a luxury car, wears designer clothes, lives in a mansion, and travels the world…all supposedly thanks to Primerica. She also mentioned that next month, Primerica is flying her and her entire family to Orlando, Florida, to visit Universal Studios, and Primerica will be covering all the food, rides (with no lineup), hotels, and expenses.

I can’t wrap my head around how this lifestyle is possible. Is her income truly coming from Primerica, or is debt part of the equation? And does Primerica actually fund these extravagant trips, or are these so-called “free trips” earned through hitting sales targets and then paid for out-of-pocket? Many MLMs promise rewards like travel but often require members to meet tough goals and cover costs themselves.

I heard that her husband allegedly lends money to people who can’t afford mortgages at extremely high interest rates ( he pulls the money out of their home equity), and I’m pretty sure that he’s involved in other illegal activities. 

Do people really earn this kind of money with Primerica, or is there more going on behind the scenes? I’m baffled by how all of this works. She keeps pushing me to meet for coffee so she can show me how to become “financially independent” like her, but honestly, she’s rubbing me the wrong way!

1i16ov4,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1i16ov4/the_art_of_pivoting_when_your_business_needs_a/,The Art of Pivoting: When Your Business Needs a Change,"Ah, the art of pivoting in business. You know, it's a bit like trying to change lanes on a busy highway while still managing to sip your coffee—tricky, messy, and if you get it wrong, you might find yourself in a whole new lane you never intended to be in. I learned this firsthand during a particularly… let’s call it “creative” phase in my business. 

Picture this: I was all gung-ho about launching a fantastic new product. I mean, I had the vision, the marketing plan, and even some half-finished prototypes that looked more like modern art than functional items. I had visions of grandeur, folks. But then, reality hit like a pie in the face at a three-ring circus. Feedback came rolling in—let’s just say it wasn’t a standing ovation. 

At first, I clung to my original plan with the kind of tenacity usually reserved for a toddler gripping a cookie. I told myself, “Maybe if I just sprinkle a bit of pixie dust and add some extra sprinkles, this will work!” But deep down, I knew it was time to do some serious soul-searching… and some serious pivoting.

So, I dusted off my emotional toolbox and started looking for the silver lining. What if instead of forcing this round peg into a square hole, I really listened? I started asking my customers what they wanted and what problems they faced that my product could solve. You’d think I was asking them for the secret to the universe. The insights poured in—clear as day—that what I thought was “cute” wasn’t quite cutting it. I found myself at the center of a beautiful community of ideas. Suddenly, my perspective shifted from “What do I want?” to “What do they need?” 

Innovation and flexibility became my buzzwords. I rolled up my sleeves and embraced the chaos of brainstorming sessions with my team, where ideas flew around like confetti at a New Year’s Eve party. Sometimes we ended up down rabbit holes that led nowhere, but every time we strayed off the beaten path, we discovered hidden treasures—ideas embraced by everyone, each more vibrant and promising than the last. We refined, adjusted, and quite literally started sketching out something that not only served a need but truly resonated with our customers. 

Here’s the kicker: the necessary shifts taught me more than just flexibility; they showed me transformation. I learned that holding too tightly to a singular idea can blind you to the better opportunities ahead. Like the parable in Proverbs 16:9—“In their hearts, humans plan their course, but the Lord establishes their steps.” This was practically tattooed on my forehead during this time. It was a reminder that surrendering my agenda allowed a higher vision to emerge, one I couldn’t see before my pivoting adventure.

So, if there’s a lesson to take from my rollercoaster ride of entrepreneurship, it’s this: Flexibility isn't just a fancy corporate buzzword; it’s a vital muscle for growth. And sometimes, the most innovative solutions come not from our plans but from the beautiful messiness of collaboration and listening.

Surrounded by the soothing sounds of nature - the rustling of leaves, the distant hoot of an owl, the soft murmur of a nearby stream - you feel the cares of the world melt away. The dancing flames paint the faces of your fellow campers in a flickering light, as stories and laughter are shared around the fire's comforting warmth. Marshmallows are toasted to golden perfection, their gooey sweetness a delightful reward after a day spent exploring the great outdoors. Beneath the star-studded canopy of the night sky, you feel a profound connection to the natural world, a sense of peace and belonging that can only be found in the simple joys of camping.**

1i16idm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogowners/comments/1i16idm/rude_people_telling_you_how_to_educate_your_dog/,Rude people telling you how to educate your dog ,"Hi. So, 3 months ago we adopted a rescued dog. He is nice and lovable, but he doesn't trust strangers. Everyday, on my morning walk with the dog, I go to this petfriendly coffee shop and get a coffee to go. Sometimes, if a person gets too close to the dog (or tries to pet him), he barks and adopts a threatening posture (shows teeth, etc). He has never bitten, he just gets this threatening attitude ​(we are working with a dog educator and with vets to change this behavior). For this reason, we don't take him to restaurants or cafés, just this coffee shop because it's always a quick order to go​ and we spend there 1 minute max. Of course, we try to avoid conflictive situations during that minute, and always apologize if he barks. ​

This morning, when we got there, the dog was behaving amazingly, but yet the employee gave us this unfriendly/annoyed gaze. Then, the conversation went more or less like this:

- Good morning, i'd like a coffee to go please ​

+ Has the dog already bitten someone?

- ¿¿? No, he hasn't. He doesn't bite, he just looks scary when a stranger tries ​to pet him. ​We are working with proffesionals on that.

+ Someday you are GOING TO have a problem. He is bad with everyone. He can bite a child. You MUST put him on a muzzle.

- Well both the vet and the dog educator haven't recommended a muzzle. He is annoying, we are trying to correct that, but I can ensure you he doesn't bite. ​​​

+ You are going to have a problem if you don't put him on a muzzle. Yesterday he barked to a frequent customer. Thank God he didn't come with his son, because his son loves dogs and he would have thrown himself into the dog.

-I'd like to pay with credit card, please. Thanks. Bye. ​​

----------------

Okey, so, I understand that our dog can be annoying AF sometimes. I would happily accept a friendly suggestion. I would also understand if the lady asked us to stop going to the shop with the dog. I don't want to disturb or cause inconvenience​to anyone. But these words, and the WAY this lady talked to me,​ were very rude. I don't think she should tell me how to educate my dog or what to do. And surely she shouldn't use the passive aggressive tone she gave.

​Regarding the children, the dog is nice to them. He doesn't fell threatened by them, since they are small. He barks to adults, specially tall men. Yet, am I crazy if I think parents should teach children to not throw themselves at dogs?

I'm not going to that coffee shop again, but I am very pissed, and I'm thinking about coming back there and talk to this lady from a nice, assertive and polite approach. I'm not a Karen (lol) but I would like to tell her (nicely)​ that her attitude was no OK. I don't know what to do​​. I'm very sad because I don't want to disturb anyone but I think I was low key mistreated.

What should I do? Did you experience similar situations? I feel that people commonly think they have the right to tell you how to educate your dog. Sorry for the long post. Thank for reading.",1,1736862744.0,Dogowners,1,1.0,False

But ,"Our college was on vacation, and one day, I had an idea: why not give people lifts on my bike in exchange for small donations? I printed stickers that said, ""Get a Ride & Buy Me a Coffee,"" and stuck them all over my Brand new Hero Splendor Plus.

I headed straight to the railway station road and waited for someone to ask for a ride. The reason? I needed money to buy an iPhone for my friend Annie’s birthday, which was just two weeks away. I wanted to surprise her, but I didn’t have enough money. Deep down, I also didn’t want anyone to know how insecure I felt about not being rich. My friends rode fancy superbikes, and I often felt jealous.

The first day, I got a few rides, but the money I earned wasn’t even enough to buy a liter of petrol. I felt exhausted and disappointed. Frustrated, I ripped off all the stickers, threw them in the dustbin, and went home to sleep.

Two weeks flew by, and Annie’s birthday was here. I didn’t want to go to her party. What would she think of me if I showed up without a gift? I couldn’t afford anything expensive, and a cheap gift under ₹1,000 felt worse than giving nothing at all. So, I decided not to go.

I thought about excuses I could tell her later. Fever was the best one. I stayed home, distracting myself until her birthday party was over. I felt lonely, but I told myself it was better this way.

Days passed, and after the vacation, we were back in college. During the interval, Annie met me at the canteen. She asked me, “What were you doing during the holidays?”

“Nothing special,” I replied.

Then she asked the question I had been dreading: “Why didn’t you come to the party?”

“Fever,” I said quickly.

“Fever, huh?” she replied, her tone sharp and annoyed.

She said “okay” in a way that made it clear she wasn’t happy. Then she walked back to her friends.

I felt nervous and uncomfortable, like the walls were closing in on me. I couldn’t stay there anymore, so I left the canteen and went back to class. The regret hit me hard. I felt like I had ruined everything.

I should have gone to her party, even without a gift. I realized it wasn’t about the iPhone or the money, it was about showing up for someone who mattered to me. I had let my insecurities take over, and now I was left with regret.

Last year, around May I ended up a 13 year relationship with my ex. We´ve been distancing for a while before that, and had lots of silent issues piling up, but in May I ended up since I thought we were beyond fixing them. We said goodbye in sad, bitter, yet civilized and responsible terms. We shared a lot together, and easy to say she was my best friend besides my partner. The end of our relationship came after a break since I didn´t want us to fall out in horrible terms and never speak again due the issues we were having.

From then on, I tried to move on with my life... Took some months feeling the loneliness creeping in, and tried to connect with new people. The results were apalling... Finding a partner seems like an impossible task. I´m  and I´m not a demanding person: I have a decent job, I´m a pretty chill guy and like to play videogames, write stories, watch movies or visit nice coffee places. I´m not fit, but I work out twice a week and try to improve that matter. However, dating market today seems like a wasteland to me... No good experiences at all, no real connections... Even managing a date seems like an ordeal (not from my part, at least).

The situation got me thinking about what I left behind with my ex or even if I could have done better or if I could even try to reconnect, but any hope of doing that is dead anyways, since she moved to another country. Worst thing is that the more time passes, the more time I miss her... But it´s like twisting the knife on the wound by my own hand.

And it´s not that I´m alone persé - I have plenty of friends, but they all have their lives... Wether it´s their families or someone to share with, while I can only remain dragging on memories and melancholy.

So now I´m here alone, with no one to share anything with me... watching series, playing games, going for a walk... And since I´m a guy of my age, I feel that I´ve lost many chances, if not all, to ever connect with someone again... I just want to share my life with someone again, to care and be cared for, to love and be loved.

But It seems not only I did throw the wonderful relationship I had to the garbage - I also have nothing but an empty, sad future ahead. I don´t know how to deal with this horrible feeling, a creeping feeling that this is what I can expect for the rest of my life.

I envy those who have healthy, happy relationships... I wish I could have done better with the one I had.",2,1736861856.0,lonely,0,1.0,False

I started having pain back in 2018 but always thought it was just certain foods causing pinned gas or something, so I would take Beano before eating, but would have regular bouts of abdominal pain that would last days at a time.  Then after 6 years of intermittent pain, I started feeling nauseous for about a month until one day I thought I was actually having a heart attack.  I was rushed to the hospital this past summer and learned I had a severe diverticular infection and liver abscess that needed drainage, with a month of iv antibiotics.  I was so so sick.  Ever since, I’ve been keeping a detailed food journal (on Foody the app) but I was finding it really hard to connect foods to triggers until I read on this subreddit that it can take 48 hours to trigger - I had just thought it was the next day!  When I looked at it with 48 hours before symptoms, I started seeing some patterns.

But I’m curious, what are your personal food triggers??  I know it’s different for everyone but there are a lot of common foods that keep coming up, and I just think it might help me if I could hone in on or pay attention to some that I might not even be considering.

For me so far it’s Beef, Coconut, Pepperoni, and Popcorn.  I’m also thinking that whole grain chips like Sun Chips are a no-no for me.  And I think Coffee on an empty stomach during a flare up hurts me more.  I try to stick to foods I know I can eat, but then when I start introducing things, it’s all trial and error (which I know is really all you can do).

The immediate response from my manager peer at the other store was to let me know ""how disappointed the new hire was."" I mentioned that I would have loved to give more heads up and I'm working with what I've got. She frequently complains to me about a litany of things and I let her vent. 

Even with that, there was a follow up along the lines of ""I understand but I'm just communicating how this new hire feels. They were very disappointed.""

1i163hb,https://www.reddit.com/r/magnesium/comments/1i163hb/trying_to_recover_from_magnesium_deficiency/,Trying to recover from magnesium deficiency ,"So boy.. I did a number on myself.  It's a lot of work owning a house, raising a kid, going to work, taking care of my mini farm, and trying to handle my side hussle. Definitely did not eat right. Skipped a lot of meals. Had some healthy meals. Drank way, way too much coffee. These are all not healthy habits and especially not good for magnesium levels. Fast forward this past weekend. I had left arm pain. Only left arm. Not both arms and not the right arm. I thought it was from working also that maybe I hurt my arm. By Sunday morning I had a racing heart. Pretty scary so I stopped in the ER to check my heart and be sure it's not a heart attack. Before I left I slammed a glass of orange juice in case it was electrolyte related. Eventually after an hour or so my heart did calm down in the ER.

Good news is that it's not a heart attack. My heart is ok. So all my bloodwork is ""good"" but I haven't gotten a copy of my labs yet to see how much in range I am on my electrolytes. I have been having left arm pain and they said from my x rays that I have cervical spondylolisthesis. This is causing the pain to radiate to my arm. Also found COPD. I don't smoke and I'm not around smokers. I don't understand the COPD. I'm not frequently out of breath. 

I've been noticably colder, especially hands and feet. I take a low dose iron pill almost daily and I don't think that's the iron issue. I have sleeping issues. I wake up early and can't go back to sleep. My blood pressure is high. I've never had high blood pressure. I have Gerd too. I've developed tinnitus as well. I've had poor appetite lately and that's not like me either. 

To me this all sounds like magnesium deficiency. I know magnesium is at the root of electrolyte disturbance. Magnesium regulates electrolytes. 

 So this morning I tried a few sips of coffee to see what my tolerance is. No good. After about 30 mins my left arm started hurting pretty bad again(which tells me probably some of my arm pain is electrolyte related). I was getting calf cramps both legs(potassium). My body went from warm to cold hands and feet(magnesium). Seems I have a significant magnesium/potassium deficiency. After a bit longer I got thigh cramps. Thigh cramps, at least for me, is calcium. I've had a long history of getting not enough calcium in. I've had thigh cramps and even tingling hands and feet and tingling lips from low calcium. I'm very familiar with low calcium symptoms. Ive been making a hard effort to eat more cheese and dairy to keep my calcium up. It seems all of my electrolytes are off and I'm guessing because of magnesium. Here's the other thing. Every night, for about a decade, I take a 500mg magnesium pill before bed with some milk. It helps the sleep but I think the absorption is poor because it has mostly oxide form. 

This incident has caused me to immediately change my diet and take this seriously. My plan is to consume way more fresh produce and higher magnesium foods and less processed food to get my vitamin and mineral levels correctly balanced. I'm pretty good at taking my multivitamin so I'm not worried with that. I have Dr Bergs electrolyte with 1000mg potassium and added 120mg magnesium. I also have the CALM magnesium powder and have been trying to sip that on and off. 

My first conceen is my blood pressure. I have lowered my sodium intake to protect from high blood pressure. I never ate that much salt but the problem is that I ate an acceptable amount of salt but failed to consume a proper level of potassium to balance the salt. With low magnesium those other electrolytes were doomed also lol 

Does anyone know by chance if COPD has anything to do with magnesium deficiency or even with GERD? I am baffled with the COPD but I know the GERD can be irritating with breathing after eating. I still think magnesium is at the bottom of this.",4,1736861478.0,magnesium,0,1.0,False

So I’m an international student in uni, 18F. There’s a lot of guys who have been interested in me ever since I came here. 
However, the most I’ve ever done with a guy is going on a date, and the thing is, I’ve only been on 2 dates. I’ve never kissed or done anything beyond that. 
About 2 weeks ago, this guy that lives in my dorm, who I always say hi to, gave me a big chocolate in front of all my friends on new years. I thought it was just a friendly gesture, but my friends said no, he’s interested in you. Which turned out to be true. 
He followed me instagram, asked me out to drink coffee. And about 2 days ago, we went on an ice skating date. 
He’s very attractive, he’s tall and very pretty. 
His personality is nice too, he’s outgoing and talkative. Which is the total opposite of my personality, because I’m more of a reserved/shy person. During these two dates, he complimented me, and got to know me better. At the end of the second date, we came back to the uni campus at night, and he gave me a side hug and said “thank you for today”. We also held hands when we were ice skating. 
He’s 20 years old. And he’s not religious, so I’m assuming he might or might not have been in a relationship before. I don’t like many things about him, like the fact that he drinks a lot, smokes and makes weirdly sexual jokes that made me uncomfortable, but I pretended to laugh. 
He wants to go out again on the next weekend to play video games with me. I said sure. But I’m still thinking about it. Because despite his bad habits and weird jokes, he was still sweet and fun to be around with. 
I told my friend about him, and she asked me a question that made me rethink this whole thing. 
She asked me if you start dating him would you have sex with him. I immediately thought no. Because although I don’t believe in any religion now, I recently left my religion that I’ve been following since birth. 
The reason I left the religion, is because I just simply don’t believe in it anymore. However, I still hold the same values. I don’t want to do anything before marriage. Maximum I could give him is a kiss on the cheek, or if we date for too long, I would be open to kissing on the lips. 
I’m very worried that if I start dating him, and I tell him that I don’t want to do any of these sexual things, he’s going to either say okay, but try to convince me later, or breakup and it will be awkward whenever I see him on campus. 
I don’t want to do things that make me uncomfortable or that I’m not ready for, and at the same time I don’t want to lead him on. 
I’ve never been in a situation like this, I’ve never had a bf before. And this is stressing me out. ",1,1736861470.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

Devotional: Faith-Fueled Empowerment: A Journey of Strength and Sisterhood
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Scripture Focus:

*“For I can do everything through Christ, who gives me strength.”* – Philippians 4:13 (NLT)

### Reflection:

In our journey of faith, we often find ourselves at crossroads where we can either lean into our strengths or succumb to our weaknesses. Philippians 4:13 reminds us that our ability to overcome challenges and thrive comes from a divine source: Christ. This empowerment is not a solitary endeavor; it’s best experienced and nurtured in fellowship with others, especially with the incredible gift of sisterhood.

Sisterhood is more than just friendship; it’s a bond that nurtures and strengthens our faith. In our world, we face various challenges—be it personal struggles, societal pressures, or spiritual battles. As women, we are often called to wear many hats: nurturers, leaders, caregivers, and more. In this whirlwind of life, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed or inadequate. However, when we turn our gaze toward Christ and embrace the power of sisterhood, we discover an unshakable source of strength.

### Educational Insight:

Faith-fueled empowerment flows from understanding our identity in Christ and building one another up through relationships. Here are some key points to reflect upon:

1. **Recognizing Our Identity**: We are daughters of the King. Embracing our identity in Christ empowers us to rise above inadequacies and embrace our purpose.
2. **Building Each Other Up**: In sisterhood, we have the opportunity to share our burdens, celebrate triumphs, and encourage one another. Proverbs 27:17 says, “As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another.” Let’s commit to being that source of encouragement and accountability in each other’s lives.
3. **Prayer in Community**: There’s strength in collective prayer. When sisters pray together, mountains can be moved (Matthew 18:20). Set aside time to pray with your sisters and watch how your faith grows and deepens, empowering you to face life’s challenges.
4. **Serving Together**: When we engage in acts of service with our sisters, we experience God’s love in action. Whether volunteering together or supporting each other in personal challenges, these moments become testimonies of our faith being lived out.

### Inspiring Action:

Take a moment today to reach out to a sister in faith. It could be a simple phone call, a text message, or an in-person meeting over coffee. Ask her how you can pray for her, share a scripture that has encouraged you, or even plan a fun outing to strengthen your bond.

Additionally, consider starting a small group dedicated to spiritual growth and empowerment. Use this space to explore scriptures, share challenges, and uplift one another. Remember, you are not alone; we are stronger together.

### Closing Prayer:

Dear Lord, thank you for the gift of sisterhood and for the strength we find in you. Help us to lean into our faith and empower one another as we journey through life together. May we be instruments of your love and support in the lives of our sisters, encouraging them to rise up and embrace their God-given purpose. Let our bonds reflect your grace, and may we continuously seek to sharpen one another in faith. In Jesus’ name, we pray, Amen.

### Final Thought:

Let your faith fuel your empowerment, and watch how you and your sisters rise together in strength, purpose, and love. Remember, with Christ at the center, all things are possible!

This may seem like a dumb question but I cannot decide at all. We’ve never had any animosity towards each other and have stayed as friends, albeit ones that don’t talk to each other anymore. Since breaking up I’ve realized what else I could’ve done in the relationship, the love was there but there was plenty that I didn’t do or was bad at. The first time we saw each other after breaking up she joined me for a concert which afterward I may pushed things and read her a letter I wrote but she ended up saying it was the nicest thing anyone’s ever said to her. Just to show you there’s no ill-will with us. 
For context: she was my first girlfriend, really first everything, we broke up in March of 23 (she broke up with me) but since then we’ve seen each other twice and have kept in touch via snap or text off and on more than a few times. It was pretty much always her (besides one time, the first time I saw her after breaking up) that would initiate the convos after we haven’t been talking for a while. 

Our last interaction started last May where she messaged me out of nowhere asking me to come to her college graduation. She said things like she really wants to talk but know she doesn’t deserve to. Looking back I was probably a little too quick to agree but I tried my best in that time to not sound so eager about going. As the time was coming up she would say things like how excited she was about the weekend and just things in my eyes that made it seem like good things could come out of this visit. But then the week of graduation came around and I’d ask if she was really sure about me coming up and then the weekend came and she pushed me coming back a day due to her family being there. I never ended up going. I questioned why and the answer I got imo was pretty pathetic. She said that she was drunk and in her feels when she first messaged me about coming but then decided to snap me for almost a month until your graduation and then say multiple times you’re excited?? I asked her why she couldn’t say that like the next day or shortly after asking me and I didn’t get a good answer on. That kind of left a sour taste in my mouth but I didn’t want to get upset so I just told her she could’ve said that if it was the case instead of pretty much leading me on. We ended up stopping snapping shortly after and that was the last I’ve spoken to her.  

Not that I thought it would get us back together as both of our personal plans were to move states at the end of summer. Which I did but she did not. Being across the country from home has taught me some things which is part of the reason I want to reach out to her and I think her bday is a good opportunity. She has a new boyfriend though which is kinda making me think I should just leave her alone. But we’ve always said we’ll remain friends. I was gonna ask if she wanted to meet up for coffee when I’m back in her state but now that she has a bf I don’t think that is smart or would happen. Although I may ask and just claim I didn’t know about the bf.  And it’s not like I’m going to pour my heart out to her. Just happy birthday and tell her I still appreciate her. Idk what to do, I still care about her.

1i15xbi,https://www.reddit.com/r/phlgbt/comments/1i15xbi/dating_is_so_tough/,Dating is so tough :(,"Hello I'm a 29 masc gay guy from Manila and honestly so freaking tired of the gay scene. From my experience, I mostly find guys through Bumble and in the past, Grindr when I would find myself in the mood. Though, I'm not really interested in one night stands/hookups anymore and looking for something long term. I don't want to generalize but I'm kinda getting the assumption that most guys just want to fuck and are not ready to commit. Even though I'm really tired of the app, I cave since I don't really go out to party or anything like that so it's really hard for me to meet guys. I don't think the gym is a good place either since everybody's just there to workout. Sometimes, I even try to hangout alone at coffee shops in hopes na someone might notice me and maybe want to share a table or something (but this is my delulu self talking huhu).

Anyway, I am a bot and I am just looking for a top who's lowkey and reserved. My first and only ex used to be big on social media and would post like photos of himself regularly (some of which even pass as thirst trap lol) and it gave me the worst anxiety so I vowed to date someone who lives a private and quiet life like myself but it's so damn hard to find. I also want to believe when people say that the right person will come to you but a part of me says that if I don't do anything also, I'll never find that person. I haven't dated outside the PH, so idk if its just here or if all over the globe mahirap na talaga to date. Where and how to even start when I've made multiple attempts to date but just isn't it :(",1,1736860927.0,phlgbt,2,0.67,False
1i15ws9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Songstuff/comments/1i15ws9/from_obscurity_to_stardom_the_music_marketing/,**From Obscurity to Stardom: The Music Marketing Hacks They Don’t Want You to Know**,"**Music Marketing: From Garage Jams to Global Streams**  

Alright, music fam, let’s get real for a second. You’ve poured your heart into your tracks, spent countless late nights tweaking sounds, and maybe even learned to *sort of* like the smell of coffee at 3 a.m. But here’s the truth bomb no one wants to confront: killer music doesn’t promote itself. Marketing isn’t just for tech bros or social media influencers—it’s the secret sauce EVERY artist needs. So let’s talk about how to get your music from your inbox to your dream audience! 🎶  

First thing’s first, marketing is NOT selling out. Let’s put an end to that myth right now. Marketing is simply connecting your art with the people who’ll love it. And trust me, there’s a crowd of weirdos out there who’ll vibe to your sound. You’ve just got to help them find you (they’re probably scrolling TikTok while eating chips as we speak).  

So, how do you shout louder in the noise of the streaming universe? Let's hit some tips—and keep it fun:  

---

### 1. **Find Your Sound Tribe**  
Stop trying to reach *everyone.* Focus on reaching the right *someone*. Ask yourself:  
- What playlists would my song go on?  
- What subreddits or forums would my listeners hang in?  
- Who’s making music that sounds like mine, and where do they hang out?  

Take the time to figure out your audience. Is it Gen Z bedroom-pop lovers or millennials who miss the ‘90s punk scene? Once you know your crew, everything else will start to feel less like marketing and more like having genuine convos.  

---

### 2. **Don't Sleep on Socials (Especially TikTok)**  
Yup, I already hear you sighing. “Do I have to dance?” No, no dancing is required (though if you want to, go off!), but TikTok has become one of THE best places to get organic reach.  
- Share clips of your music creation process.  
- Tell a funny story that inspired a lyric.  
- React to other creators and link it back to your song.  

Bonus: Post your stuff to Instagram Reels too. Apparently, the algorithm gods smile upon them these days.  

---

### 3. **Your Email List is Your Secret Weapon**  
Emails might not seem sexy, but here’s the tea: an email list is one of the most valuable tools you can have. Social media changes every second, but your email list? That’s YOURS.  
- Offer a free demo track or exclusive acoustic version in exchange for an email sign-up.  
- Shoot out updates when you’re dropping new songs, sharing fun behind-the-scenes stories, or even launching merch.  

It doesn’t have to be spammy. Pretend you’re sharing stuff with friends who actually care about what you’re making.  

---

### 4. **Collaborate Like a Boss**  
Other artists in your niche aren’t competitors—they’re collab opportunities. Pooling audiences is marketing gold. Try:  
- Features on each other’s tracks.  
- Your song on their Twitch stream or vlog.  
- Guest appearances on YouTube channels or podcasts where your vibe matches the audience.  

Nothing brings people together like hyping each other up. Plus, who doesn’t love some wholesome community energy?  

---

### 5. **Focus on Quality Content (But Done is Better than Perfect)**  
Consistency > Perfection. You don't need every piece of content to look like a Grammy-winning production. Use your phone. Be raw. Be human. People are more likely to connect with real you rather than the photoshopped or perfectly polished version you think they want to see.  
- Acoustic covers in your bedroom? Yes.  
- Rashly edited tour footage? Still yes.

---

### 6. **Seriously, Be Patient with Yourself**  
Here’s the brutal truth no one tells you in a bunch of “Music Marketing 101” guides: building a fanbase that cares takes time. This isn’t a sprint, it’s a slow grind. And that’s okay. Progress is progress. Celebrate your 10 listeners the same way you’ll celebrate your future 10,000. Gratitude breeds engagement.  

---

Most importantly, *never* let marketing drain the joy out of your music. You got into this because music was magic to you, right? Well, your marketing is just another way to sprinkle that magic further out into the world. You've got this—now go break the internet with your jams.  

Drop your thoughts, frustrations, or ongoing tricks in the comments—this is a team effort! Let’s make sure more killer music actually gets heard. 🎤🍻",1,1736860881.0,Songstuff,0,1.0,False

I've been playing around with ChatGPT and realized that crafting effective prompts is both an art and a science. Here are **5 essential must-dos** I’ve learned for getting the best out of ChatGPT.

 I'd love to hear your thoughts or any tips you might have,

 Let's make this a master thread on prompt engineering 🚀

# 1. Give the AI an Identity

Don’t just dive in—set the scene for ChatGPT, Tell it who it is and what role it should play. It’ll give you way more tailored and relevant responses.  
**Example prompts:**

* *""You are a tech startup founder pitching your app to investors.""*
* *""Act as a friendly neighborhood librarian recommending books for kids aged 5-10.""*
* *""Pretend you’re a professional chef creating a dinner menu for a vegan wedding.""*

# 2. Add a Tone

ChatGPT can match your tone—formal, funny, empathetic—you name it. You just have to tell it.  
**Example prompts:**

* *""Write a quirky and humorous email promoting a new coffee shop.""*
* *""Draft a compassionate reply to a customer complaint.""*
* *""Create a mystical poem about the stars.""*

For image generators, this also applies! You can specify tones like *cartoonish, retro, dreamy,* etc.

# 3. Provide Background Information

The more context, the better the output! If you want it to write an article, give it samples of your writing or outline the style you want.  
**Example prompts:**

* *""Draft a social media post. Here’s an example of one I wrote before: \[Insert your post\].""*
* *""Help me write a product description. Here are our brand guidelines: \[Insert details\].""* Just be careful with sensitive or proprietary information. Adjust privacy settings if needed.

# 4. Direct the Length

Be specific about how long you want the response to be. Otherwise, ChatGPT might go on... and on... 😅  
**Example prompts:**

* *""Summarize this article in under 100 words.""*
* *""Write a 5-minute speech on climate change.""*
* *""I need a tweet-length response (under 280 characters).""*

# 5. Ask the AI to Ask You Questions

This is a game-changer for me! If you’re not sure what to include in your prompt, let ChatGPT guide you.  
**Example prompts:**

* *""What details do you need from me to write a compelling product pitch?""*
* *""What clarifications would help you create a better story outline?""*
* *""Ask me questions to ensure this marketing copy aligns with my goals.""*

So, those are my top 5 tips.  
Have you tried any of these? 

Or do you have your own go-to strategies for writing killer prompts? 

Let’s chat.

Can’t wait to read your insights and demo prompts.

1i15uvt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i15uvt,New to the hobby! Any teachers around? ,"Hi All, 

I got my first TN and am now super invested in the hobby and system! I've grown up not being particularly well organised or disciplined, but I've really enjoyed using a nice pen in my TN and that's helped me stick to it!

I actually got the planner to journal and document my 3 year old daughters life. Just things like what we did over the weekend, what she's currently into, funny things she said during the day etc. I plan to give it all to her when she's older and I'm sure she'll think it's silly and throw it away lol. 

My set up is as follows:

- Moterm TN in Coffee brown
- 5 inserts, 1 canvas zip pocket, 4 notebooks. 
- Notebooks are: 1 lined, 1 plane, 1 calendar, 1 teaching planner. I printed the calendar and teacher planner from etsy templates that I purchased. 
- I'm really into coffee so my brass clip and charm are coffee themed.
- Pens are 1 Lamy Safari and 1 Lamy Safari clone from Ali Express. 

All in, I spent around £35/$40 on everything. That's for TN cover, pen clip, charm, brass clip, pens and inserts.

Everything apart from Lamy Pen was purchased from Ali Express. Free personalisation on the planner which I've covered with my hand as it has my name lol. 

I didn't go for Travelers Company cause it felt steep for a system I might not commit to, but now that I'm invested, I may treat myself in the future! 

Would love to know if there's any other teachers in this sub who use their TN as part of their day to day? ",12,1736860709.0,Travelersnotebooks,5,1.0,False

I am in therapy but only can go every eight weeks. I used to be on topiramate for night eating but it didn’t really work (at the time). 

I have several health conditions and cannot take anything that slows my intestinal and stomach motility.

I am not obese and am on the edge of being overweight for my height, but am about 30lbs over my “normal” weight.

I am currently on SSRIs (sertraline) at the highest dose.

I would love to try hypnotherapy but can’t afford it. I don’t have insurance.

I am getting sick of eating in the middle of the night — physically and mentally. I don’t even keep food in my house and I will always find something (like milk, even though I only keep it for my coffee in the morning, then I’ll drink the whole thing over night… like two litres). 

I am not even hungry and eat enough calories during the day. I am positive this is psychological.


I like doing my own research and bringing ideas to my psych since I can’t see him very often, but I can email his assistant, who can ask him things for me.

Should I try the topiramate again? Any other suggestions? Again, like I said, hurt can’t take anything that decreases gastric emptying or slows intestinal motility.

Basically, I decided to go for a 12 hour fasting as I realised it'd be easier for me to reach my calories limit by having less food. The thing is, yesterday, we had a birthday party with lots of caloric foods.

Despite knowing the consequences, I indulged in it. The time for me to begin my fasting arrived five hours later and... I noticed I still didn't feel any hunger at all. So I decided to just not eat until next day.

The next morning, for some reason, my stool got green. It's still green and I have no idea why. Is this normal when someone is doing fasting or was it a result of the kinds of foods I consumed? None of it was green or vegetables, so it seemed odd.

Yes, I'm going to the doctor to check it out if it turns out to be a problem, but I wanted to make sure I'm not concerned over nothing and I wanted to know if anyone here knows what it could be. I was hydrating myself only with water. No coffee, no tea, so I'm pretty sure that wasn't it.

I started working here as an Assistant Manager for the first 3 months of probation and then had two months added as I was unable to pass probation so I was given those two months as a second chance.

After the two months, I sadly failed and had to go down to a lower contract. Ever since then, I feel a lot less useful and find that I can’t communicate with some people as I don’t think they see me in a good light. I’m not perfect, I do have bad memory ever since joining (unsure why) and lately find myself not showing much enthusiasm, so I feel coworkers have caught on and don’t really care to ask, just seem to speak with a tone now.

I have a lot going on at home, as I care for two kids and one adult alongside my mother. I also am doing a part-time course, but this hasn’t affected me in any way whilst at work.

I’m just finding it hard to fit in and feel I can’t fix it anymore or make anything better out of it. I’m just tired, but I don’t know if cutting down on hours will do me enough as I will still have to put up with back-talking and such.

Early morning of the election, Mickey Verona looked out of his living room window to see Comstock and a woman trudging up his walk through the snow. Behind them, parked in the road, was a brown truck with SHERIFF emblazoned on the side in bold white letters and a red emergency light flashing on top. The vehicle had been fitted with mattracks to travel over the deep blanket of unseasonably early snow cast upon the Mission Valley.

Comstock was clad in a heavy parka and boots. The woman, wearing a beige waistcoat over slacks and shoes, slipped and almost fell.

“Christ,” Mickey grumbled. He hadn’t even made coffee yet.

His eyes felt heavy and hot. He’d sat up most of the night waiting for his phone to ring, hoping Alan or Deputy Wolf would contact him and tell him what the hell had happened, or at least send some sort of signal they were alive. But the call never came.

Mickey made it a habit to monitor all the police bands in the valley. A friend in the Polson City Police Department provided him with the encrypted channels, just in case his services were needed. At two in the morning, his scanners had gone wild. It all began with a call out from the sheriff’s department asking Polson PD across town if they had internet and electricity.

“Affirmative. No problem here,” was the reply.

Thirty minutes later, another call had gone out, “We’re under attack!”

“Repeat. What did you say?” said the city dispatcher. “Repeat, Lake County!” But there was no further communication from the sheriff’s department.

After a solid two minutes of what must have been panicked confusion at the PD, the dispatcher radioed, “We’re sending a unit over now.”

Fifteen minutes later, a city police officer called back, screaming with adrenaline, “Officers down! Officers down! Send backup!”

Mickey sat at his kitchen table, listening intently to the back-and-forth chatter. Polson had requested backup ten miles up Highway 93 from the Tribal Police in Pablo and then six more miles up the road from the Ronan City Police Department. Every time there was another call, the body count increased.

“I found another one. That makes three.”

A few minutes later: “Body next to the café...”

“…body in the jail cell...”

“…human head on top of the cruiser…”

“Holy Christ, they look like Gretas.”

Then, a caller to Polson 911 reported an accident on Main Street. A car had plowed through the front door of Brown’s Dental Clinic. It looked like a crash and run, as there was no driver to be found to the black and gray late-model self-driver, registered under the name Alan Smith.

Mickey had been debating heading out into the storm on foot when the final call from Sheriff Comstock crackled over the scanner, the call that perplexed him more than anything and made him sit tight.

“This is Sheriff Comstock. I have an all-persons bulletin for three individuals suspected in the murder of my deputies. Forty-five-year-old White male, roughly six feet tall, 190, with brown hair, brown eyes, and a beard. The name is Alan Smith. Twenty-six-year-old White female, five-four, red hair, green eyes, Gwendolyn Wolf. Thirteen-year-old Native American male, long hair, _injun_ style, brown eyes, five feet tall, eighty-five pounds soaking wet, goes by the name of Francis Builds A Fire. All suspects are wanted for multiple homicides of law enforcement officers and possibly other victims. They are considered armed and dangerous.”

Then in the pre-dawn hours, a knock on his back door. It was McGreevy, urgent, panicked, telling him a story about men turning into wolves and how he, with the help of a strange old woman, had killed them and burned their bodies.

And now Francis’s smashed guitar rested in plain sight on the sofa.

The front door vibrated like a drum. Comstock was pounding.

Mickey sighed and opened.

“I have a warrant to search your house, Verona.”

The large cop pushed past him into the living room. “This is Special Agent Nor-Nora-Nor-something from the FBI.”

The agent stood next to Comstock and looked around, melting a puddle on his living room carpet. She flashed her identification and reached out to shake Mickey’s hand with a firm grip. She removed her fogging glasses in the warmth of the house. “Norelhouda. FBI. Domestic Terrorism. Is it correct that you are the lawyer representing Francis Builds A Fire?”

“That’s right,” said Mickey.

Norelhouda stayed in the living room while Comstock tramped through the house.

“You break it, you buy it,” he called after him.

“And you’re a friend of Dr. Alan Smith?”

“Alan is Builds A Fire’s psychologist. We were coordinating on the boy’s defense.” A loud crash came from his office, and he flinched. “I heard the calls last night.”

“You did?”

“I’m an ambulance chaser.”

“I see. When was the last time you saw Gwendolyn Wolf or Alan Smith?”

“I didn’t look at my watch. Between midnight and 1 AM at the sheriff’s station. Alan was unconscious in a cell, probably suffering from a concussion, thanks to the rabid ape tearing up my house. Comstock beat the boy down, too. If I thought it’d make a difference, I’d file a report.”

Agent Norelhouda raised her eyebrows.

“Anyway, Gwen and I had just finished talking to Sheriff Comstock. He told me to get out, so I came home, took a shit and a shower, and then all living hell broke loose over the scanners.”

Norelhouda frowned. She was pretty in a girl-next-door way. Remove the glasses and, well…

“Have they tried to contact you?” she asked.

“No, they haven’t. What the hell happened over there?”

The FBI agent closed her eyes tight and shook her head. She looked as tired as Mickey felt. “I don’t know. We’re trying to piece it together.”

“Do you really think a boy, a cop, and a shrink are responsible for all that?” asked Mickey.

Comstock came back into the living room, his face red. “No one is here but this greasy little lawyer.” His gaze settled on Mickey’s sofa and the busted blue guitar. “Where did you get that?”

“I rescued it after the concert. It’s evidence. Go ahead, take it.”

Comstock looked like he was going to pick it up and smash it again. He jabbed Mickey in the chest to emphasize each word. “Do not leave town.” He slammed Mickey’s door behind him and headed for his truck.

“Looks like you got fun company today, Agent Norelhouda,” Mickey said.

“Shit. I could’ve been in Cancun today. Thank you for your time, Mr. Verona.”

“Just Mickey.”

“I guess you’ll understand that we’re going to station a patrol on your house.”

“And my phone?”

“We have a warrant to monitor it, but if you get any information—”

“I know the drill.”

“Sorry about the mess.” She paused at the door. “One more thing, does it always snow this much up here?”

“It’s Montana. It always snows this much. Might be a tad early this year.”

“I better buy some boots then. Don’t forget to vote, Mickey.”

She made her way through the snow and climbed clumsily into Comstock’s rig. Mickey noticed a small, unmarked SUV had parked across the street. Two men were sitting in the front watching him. His stomach rumbled. He needed coffee and maybe a Lumberjack Stack.

***

Bundled in his heavy winter coat, his work bag slung across his chest like a sash, Mickey ventured out into the world. He waved to the two men in the SUV as he snowshoed across the white powder of his yard, heading down the lane that would take him to his office. Hot coffee, food, a beautiful view of the lake, and hopefully an even better view of Foxy’s firm ass.

Mickey heard the rev of an engine. When he looked back, he saw the surveillance vehicle had become lodged in the snow as it tried to follow him. He waved, leaving the team behind.

Despite the horrific events that had transpired over the last twelve hours, he breathed deeply, savoring the crisp air of the valley winter come early. Just days ago, the town of Polson had been mired in the brown muck of late autumn. Now, it was a wonderland of frozen white, the whitest snow he’d ever seen. Ice crystals sparkled with hues of blue, red, and yellow, like diamonds catching the sunlight.

He made yet another turn into a decrepit trailer park. The long units, covered in drifts, looked like the set of a science fiction movie. Smoke rose from the chimneys, carrying the fragrance of burning pine logs.

He passed a boy pulling another on a red sled down the sidewalk. The kid was trying his damnedest to dislodge his rider, who, looking like a future astronaut in his snowsuit and ski mask, held on tight. As they hit the slope, big brother jumped on top, and down they went, reveling in their freedom of an unexpected snow day from school.

***

“Hello? Anyone home?” Mickey called into the diner. There was no reply. The parking lot was heaped with snow and empty, but the neon OPEN sign shone in the window, and the door was unlocked. A tinkling Christmas melody played over the speaker system. He hung his wet coat on the rack and walked through the large dining area to _his_ booth in the back next to the windows.

Dee’s Diner occupied the entire ground floor of a three-story redbrick building constructed in the early 1950s. The original owner, a Mr. Clarence Lindberg, had been a successful local pharmacist and businessman. Inspiration struck when his wife, Alice-Desaré (everyone called her ‘Dee’), mentioned she was bored and wanted something to take her mind off the tragedy of a child lost in the war.

Legend had it that the core of Dee’s clientele back in those days were the lumberjacks from the logging camps in the foothills of the Missions. Every morning, the lot of them would clean Dee out and grumble for more, so she was forced to design a breakfast sure to satiate those voracious men. The Lumberjack Stack: six buttermilk pancakes drowning in real butter and maple syrup, four eggs, six strips of bacon, hash browns, and the lumberjack’s choice of four pieces of toast or two giant buttermilk biscuits.

Coffee flowed like water.

Even if Foxy hadn’t worked here, the food would have kept Mickey coming back for more.

He wasn’t surprised the place was empty—most of Polson would probably stay empty today, save for the few disillusioned who still believed their votes mattered—but Dee’s was also famous for never closing.

“Hello?” he called out again.

He thought he heard something back in the kitchen. Poking his head through the double swinging doors, he felt the warmth from the massive, gas-fired griddle on his face. The smell of freshly beaten pancake batter, resting on a bed of ice in a large stainless steel bowl on the center island filled the air. But Foxy was nowhere to be seen.

He’d been coming here at least six days a week for the last ten years. Hell, he’d even worked here washing dishes for a few months when he first migrated to the picturesque lakeside town after college, so he didn’t think it was inappropriate to cross that boundary and look behind the curtain. And he was glad he did, because what he saw pleased him.

There was Foxy, on her hands and knees, doing something under the long sink at the far side of the kitchen. Her very shapely rump was sticking up in the air, her tight polyester skirt showing off each ham of her ass in fine detail.

“Lose a contact lens?” he said.

The waitress squeaked and smacked her head on the underside of the sink. “Ouch! Jesus! Mickey!” she said, standing up, rubbing her scalp.

“Sorry, Foxy, I didn’t mean to startle you.”

“Oh, Mickey, it’s alright. I broke a damn plate and was trying to get all the little pieces of glass. Those blue ones shattering is the worst.”

Her long blonde hair was done up in a net, but a few wild strands still managed to sneak out and fall across her face, where a dash of flour freckled over the bridge of her nose.

“I’ll just pour myself a cup. Take your time.”

“Office hours on a day like this?” she asked. That was how she referred to booth C-3, Mickey’s office; and except for times when they were slammed, she never let anyone sit there.

“You betcha. Is it a one-lady crew today?”

“Yeah, everyone’s snowed in this morning. They asked me to open up. The perks of living above your workplace,” she said, slopping a dirty rag into a bucket.

Foxy, in addition to being the most loyal waitress Dee’s had ever known, lived on the third floor in a cozy apartment.

“Well, if you need any help, let me know. I can still wash dishes.”

“Okay, Mickey, I’ll let you know, but by the looks of it outside, it ain’t gonna get too busy.”

She wore no makeup today, and she was just as pretty as the night of the Halloween Ball. God, that had been a night to remember. She’d been the perfect date, and perfectly in character as the buxom wench fallen under the spell of a lusty vampire. In the end, he’d been a perfect gentleman. He bought her two bottles of the overpriced pumpkin spice champagne, and drove her home safely, kissed her on the cheek, and asked her to the movies the following weekend—to which she replied in the affirmative.

UNSEALED COURT RECORDS NAME POLICE SUSPECT IN KILLING OF MADISON ROY-BOUDREAU .
DOCUMENTS SHOW POLICE SUSPECT THAT STEVEN LAURETTE ,WHO HASN'T BEEN CHARGED ,KILLED BATHURST GIRL IN 2021............
Posted: Jan 13, 2025 ..........Shane Magee ,CBC.
Newly unsealed court records show police suspect that Steven Laurette murdered a 14-year-old Bathurst girl almost four years ago.

Madison Roy-Boudreau disappeared May 11, 2021, in the northeastern New Brunswick city. Police say she is presumed dead. Her body hasn't been found.

The unsealed records say police believe the 45-year-old man from South Tetagouche, west of Bathurst, was with her when she was last seen alive. No charges have been laid. The allegation he killed her has not been tested in court.
Bathurst's police chief named Laurette during a news conference about the search for Roy-Boudreau, referencing his arrest on a charge of violating a court condition, but police have not publicly named him as the suspect in her disappearance and death. 

The documents outline the police theory that Laurette, currently serving a prison sentence for sexual assault, killed her.
The records span 2021 to May 2023 and offer a snapshot of the investigation as of that point. They consist of search warrants executed early in the investigation, lists of things seized, and requests to allow police to retain items that could be evidence.

The documents lay out the evolution of the investigation, from one about whether Laurette violated a court condition to a much more serious allegation.

""Throughout the investigation, the seriousness of the matter evolved from a failure to comply with an undertaking given to a judge, to the offences of taking without lawful authority an unmarried person under the age of sixteen and at this time, the first degree murder of Madison Roy Boudreau,"" RCMP Cpl. Eric Dupuis, the lead investigator, said in a May 2023 affidavit.

No body helps explain 'slow progress,' officer says
Dupuis stated police seized ""a large quantity of exhibits,"" with some sent for testing and others expected to be tested. Dupuis stated the police wanted to keep possession of the items that could become evidence in court.

""I believe that since Madison Roy Boudreau's body has not been recovered [it] adds a significant layer of complexity to the investigation that explains in great part the slow progress of the current investigation,"" Dupuis wrote in the 2023 affidavit.

Radio-Canada went to court in 2023 asking for the documents to be unsealed. Court of King's Bench Justice Zoël Dionne recently unsealed the records. Portions of the documents are blacked out.

Laurette objected in court to the records being unsealed and to police retaining items collected during searches.
Laurette is serving a seven-year prison sentence for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl, who was not Roy-Boudreau, between December 2018 and March 2019.
As part of the court applications to retain evidence gathered after executing search warrants, police affidavits from Dupuis filed in court from Dupuis outline the early stages of the Roy-Boudreau investigation by the Bathurst Police Force.
The RCMP took the lead on the investigation in 2022 based on the belief Roy-Boudreau was in Middle River, southwest of Bathurst and in RCMP jurisdiction, after she was last seen. What led to that belief has not been explained.

Dupuis wrote that Roy-Boudreau's father Jason Boudreau reported her missing at 11:18 p.m. on May 11, 2021, after she missed school and didn't come home.

Police initially said the girl with brown hair was last seen that day around 7:30 a.m. when she left her home to go to her nearby school bus stop, which was close to Grange Avenue and Chaleur Street.

Later, Dupuis wrote in his affidavit, police determined she was last seen alive that morning willingly getting into a 2007 grey Ford Ranger truck driven by Steven Laurette, who was the lone occupant.
About three hours after Roy-Boudreau was last seen, police allege in the affidavits that Laurette walked into a Giant Tiger store wearing brown shoes. He bought blue shoes, and minutes later, the records say, he was seen wearing blue shoes. 

Laurette was under court-imposed conditions when Roy-Boudreau disappeared.

The documents say Laurette was arrested May 13, 2021, for violating one of those conditions. He was charged the following day, though that charge was later withdrawn.

A search warrant issued May 14, 2021, granted Bathurst police authority to search the truck Laurette was driving the morning Roy-Boudreau disappeared.
The documents say police were searching for Roy-Boudreau's belongings, clothing fibres, bodily substances and fingerprints. 
The records say the search resulted in police collecting a swab of potential blood on the passenger seat cover and hair from the passenger seat. The documents don't say if blood was confirmed.

The records state several items have been sent, or would be sent, to a lab for testing. The results are not described in the documents.The records indicate police carried out several searches of the truck over the following months as the investigation evolved into one of an alleged murder.

One warrant issued in 2021 relates to an item seized in June that year that the document says could offer evidence about the commission of the abduction and alleged murder. The details about what the item is and where it was located are blacked out in the unsealed documents.

Police carried out a series of searches in areas around Bathurst after Roy-Boudreau disappeared. 

Police search Middle River area
On Aug. 9, 2021, police began searching in Middle River, a rural area that's roughly nine kilometres from where Roy-Boudreau was last seen alive.

""These searches have led to obtaining additional evidence, which are currently being processed,"" Stéphane Roy, who was the Bathurst police chief, said in a video statement Aug. 11, 2021.

That statement announced that Roy-Boudreau's disappearance was deemed a homicide. Police have not said what led to that determination. 

Roy said the force had a suspect. However, they didn't name Laurette as that suspect.

In the unsealed documents, the language used shifts to police alleging Laurette committed first-degree murder, a homicide that's planned and deliberate.
In the days after Roy's announcement, police obtained another warrant to search the Ford Ranger truck, the court records show. 
The documents say police collected a long list of items like medical masks, coffee cups, dozens of cigarette butts, tools, a long brown hair, and a snowbrush with red stains. There's no information in the records about what caused the stains. 

The records say the truck was later returned to its owner, Laurette's father. The documents don't suggest his father was in any way involved in the alleged crimes.
Police have continued to search the Middle River area over the years. RCMP Cpl. Hans Ouellette has said nothing was found during a search in October.

RCMP didn't provide an interview for this story. Ouellette said in a statement that no arrests have been made or charges laid in connection with Roy-Boudreau's death. He said police are continuing to search and receive tips from the public.

""Any detail, even if it seems small, could assist with furthering this investigation and bringing answers to Madison's family and her community,"" Ouellette said.

PLEASE help!             ......Sorry so long. ,"My husband and I were pulled over 2 days ago while driving through our small city running errands. The officer came up behind us so fast with both his lights and sirens going that we thought he wanted to pass us, not pull us over.  
I handed the officer my license and registration and then asked him what it was I had been pulled over for. He said ""Please hold on one minute"" And then asked me to please shut the car off.

I need to specify that my husband and I drive an all black Ford Taurus Police Interceptor Sedan. My brother is a detective and we got it used from him when he got a new work car. My husband spent ALOT of time removing all of the ""police"" items/parts and markings on the car to make it more ""civilian"".
There are no flashers, blue lights, sirens, everything is gone. The only thing really left is the dark tint which we left because I have Astigmatism and it helps when I drive. I DO have a Doctors letter for this and a permission permit from the RMV allowing me to have the tint on the car. And also the ""Police Interceptor"" plastic tag attached to the back of the car where it says the car brand on vehicles. There IS a State Police sticker and a ""near by"" city PD sticker on the back bumper which I get to later.

But back to the stop....
In less than 2 minutes there was another officer there. They both approached our car on either side, and had both of us exit the vehicle.
I was immediately on edge and scared. 
When I asked why and what we had done....all we got was that they ""didn't really know"" and all that they DID know was that our car was part of a ""crime investigation"".
This sent me over the edge. Meaning... I started to cry. (PLEASE DONT JUDGE!)
My husband stayed VERY calm. Surprisingly calm. Luckily. Because I have been told, on more than one occasion, that he is a very 'scary' individual.
The officers were calm, polite, nice.
We were the same. There were no arguments. No confrontations. No yelling. Nothing.
I kept asking questions. And all we got were more reasons to ask more questions. They didn't know anything more than what they were telling us.  We needed to wait for someone higher up to come and then THEY would explain. They were low on the totem pole and didn't know anything more.  One officer said the ""crime"" was usually committed in the past 24-48 hours for this to happen. The other one said it could have happened a month ago. They didn't know. (Of course they did!) They just knew that our car was part of a ""crime investigation"". We were never placed under arrest. We were never restrained. I, also, at this time, mentioned how my brother is a detective in a nearby city. And my cousin is on our state's State Police force. They asked who my brother and cousin were and I told them. Hence the stickers I mentioned before that are on our rear bumper.
We, also, have the special plates on our car that support our state and local police, firefighters, MBTA Transit Police, EMTs and their families in times of need. That I pay EXTRA for. Because I am supporting my brother and cousin both in that way. 
I didn't tell them any of this hoping for any kind of leniency or anything.  

This is about when one officer then told us that we may want to start calling for a ride home because we most likely would NOT be leaving with our car. (MORE TEARS!)
Neither my husband nor I have any warrants, or legal issues, etc. Which the officers DID acknowledge on their own. 

So,the two of us went and sat on a bench on the side of the (busy)street. To passerby we must have just looked like 2 people watching what was going down in the street with someone ELSE'S car.
And waited. And waited some more.
And smoked a couple cigs. And drank our coffee. And I cried. And cried some more. (Silent, but visible tears)
And quietly asked my husband if HE did anything bad I didn't know about. I didnt think he did. But I asked. He said NO... did YOU?
NO..i didnt.

We did not call for any ride yet. My husband wanted to wait. He said we would call a taxi if we had to which I was glad for because I did NOT want to call my parents!! ""Mom...our car is being seized by the police because its part of a crime investigation. Can you guys please come and get us? No rush! Can you grab a couple coffees on your way? THANKS!"" ..NOPE. NOT happening.

I was just worried about not having a car and how we would get our son back and forth to school everyday. And my husband to work.
So we sat. And I cried some MORE.
By then, there were maybe 4 patrol cars there (each with all lights flashing!), and there were also 2 more additional officers (in addition to the first 4)who were maybe detectives...and who seemed to just appear out of nowhere...one with a big flash camera that looked to be out of the 60's it was so big...taking photos of our car from every angle, inside and out, up, down, in front, in back, standing on his toes, down on his knees, laying on his back, up on his elbows, up on his partner's shoulders, over his own shoulder, between his legs, between a pedestrians legs...you get the picture... Like every scratch, nick, nook, cranny and dent....

The officers would randomly come over to us sitting on the bench and talk about the weather. Most of them talked to my husband about the car and how much they liked all the work he had done to it and how nice it looked. (Weird!) We get that alot. People comment on how nice the car is. He HAS done alot of work on it i will give him that.

Then they called my husband over to the car and started asking him questions...like:
""Are there any blue lights on this car? No? Can you show us?"" And my husband did. Showed them we had no blue lights anywhere and how he had replaced everything to be legal for us to have.
""Any sirens, etc? No?""
And my husband, AGAIN, showed them.
Next they asked if they could search the trunk. My husband said OF COURSE....
All 6 of them followed him to the trunk where my husband proceeded to first remove our 5 yr old sons stroller. 
""OH YOU HAVE A KID?""
My husband-""Yes! A 5 year old""
For some reason this looked to me like it had surprised some of them.(??why??)
He opened up the spare tire area and they all just peered into the trunk as my husband emptied it. They never really searched it. (I think they were just looking to see if there were any police car lights, etc on or installed in the rear of the car), because this is when my husband called me over.
(My husband has a STRONG middle eastern accent and also sometimes can not completely understand certain  English words....so he was having a hard time understanding what they were asking him). What they were asking him is if he had any FLASHERS in the car. He thought they were asking if he had any of those Police Flashlights they carry. Like those MAGLights. We DONT. Of either thing. And he showed them...there was NOTHING.

I then went back and sat on the bench and one of the officers came over to me and said
""Well it looks like you just may be driving away in your vehicle."" I asked something to the likes of if  they had the wrong car or something like that. And he kind of nodded his head while looking at the ground and kicking his feel at the gravel and said ""Probably"" and rolled his eyes.
I gave him a laugh and said DOES THAT MEAN I CAN NOW SUE THE CITY FOR EMOTIONAL DAMAGE?
He said ""OH PLEASE DONT DO THAT! I DON'T WANT TO GET IN ANY TROUBLE""
Why would you get in trouble if you were only doing your job???

So, basically...that was the end...and a few minutes later....we were told we could go. IN our OWN car. So we got in, and drove away.

Luckily we never called for that ride.
They were all full of apologies. They kept thanking us for being so calm and helpful and basically nice through the whole incident. Which, I must say, we were. When we didn't have to be. But that's not me. It's not us. I also thanked them for being nice to us.

I guarantee you they ALL made some sort of comment later to each other regarding how the whole thing went down ALOT different than they thought it might, considering how nice and calm my husband and I were that whole hour and a half we sat in the freezing cold. Sat and watched 6 officers publicly go over our car with a fine tooth comb while we pondered our lives without a vehicle because we NEVER could have been able to afford another one. 

My question is...is this normal? Is this...right??? Is this ... common??
I mean what....they told us to LEAVE! What if we HAD left? And left our car there. Would they have come and told us they were WRONG???
And so like what.... why not restrain either of US? Who supposedly drove the car during this supposed ""crime""?Did the car commit the crime on its own? Like KIT? On KnightRider?
Or a driverless vehicle? 
I'm SO confused. 
Does anyone have any real thoughts? Like intelligent thoughts? I'm still completely baffled. 
I am unable to ask my brother at this time and I can't wait until I can to know anything about this kind of thing. Anyone?? Anything? Thank you for reading! Sorry so long! Thanks for any answers and help!
Edit: PLEASE don't tell me to calm down. This was frightening for me. Understandably. All I am asking is if this is something normal. Not to be criticized. Thank you.",2,1736860078.0,AskLE,19,0.6,False
1i15ncf,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1i15ncf/34m_im_not_in_love_with_my_gf_33f_is_there/,[34M] I'm not in love with my gf [33F]. Is there anything I can do to make it happen ?,"hi, throwaway account here.

I'm 34M, not very used to relationships since I started dating around 31yo.

I had one meaningful relationship 2 and a half years ago, with a person I fell very very strongly in love (which was reciprocated at first), but it ended because of different worldviews, and that was a dealbreaker for her, so she put an end to it. It took me about 2 years to rebuilt confidence and digest the pain (bottom line was a suicide attempt, which I'm not proud of).

Now, fast forward, I started dating again a year ago, met few girls, but I couldn't really develop feelings for them somehow, and it never worked out far (yeah, I'm in therapy, and we've been exploring potential unconscious self-sabotaging behaviors on my part).

Until I met Lea (33F, name changed) last summer on okcupid, last girl I dated, with which it felt good to be with, since we share common interests, some oddities in our worldviews, and lifestyles. It felt reasonnable to ask her for more after 4-5 dates, to which she said 'no', because she liked my presence, but didn't feel attraction, and that was too important to her.

For sure, I felt rejected, but I accepted, we talked about it and agreed on being friends. After that, I was tired with the dating world, and I stopped going on tinder, okcupid etc... We kept spending time together, as friends, like going to movies, coffee, talking, doing art stuff together, we even spent few evenings cuddling (which, to me, was absolutely clearly non-sexual, and it felt nice having thoses boundaries). She even sent me a long ""friendship declaration"" once, like a love letter, but platonic.

On the side, I started another activity in a christian group (I'm from a christian household anyway), in which I met another girl, Bianca (26F, name changed). After each weekly group encounter, we talk, she's very conservative, very beautiful, and I really enjoy her company, everytime. Honestly, I feel something for her. She's always with a girl friend, so I've been inviting both of them a few times to share a meal, chat, play board games etc... We've been sending each others a few messages too, debating faith, good/evil, future. And once, she told me she has a crush on someone from our group, doesn't want to tell me who, so idk, but I've been tempted a lot to ask her out.

BUT

Lea came back to me one evening 2 months ago, told me she developped feelings for me.

From that point, it's very hard for me to know if I'm doing anything right or wrong, hence the post.

To me, Lea has kinda all the qualities I've been looking in a partner. We have chemistry, she's able to reflect and talk about her feelings, she makes room for mines, we can discuss anything. But she told me she wants someone that wants her and will make her feel loved (seems fair). On a darker side, she has few insecurities stemming from past relationships, and that puts some pressure.

On the other hand, Bianca makes me feel something I haven't for Lea (because I shut it down when she denied me the first time), she's interesting, beautiful (more than Lea), and has that inner strength I admire. Plus, it's the first time I've had something for a christian girl. It 'feels' right.

So.

I said yes to Lea 🙃

Because it felt reasonnable to have someone I already know would love me, and whom I have chemistry with. I tried to tell myself that Bianca wasn't for me, and that I'll find feelings for Lea, because I wanted to choose her willingly and put work into it.

It didn't went well, because Lea sees I'm not having the butterflies, and I told her about Bianca before we got together, and now she's jealous.

I'm kinda lost, and it stresses me out.

Since my last meaningful relationship, my overall feelings have been really really dull (I know I self protect, I used to be overly emotional), and I've not been feeling in love since. I'm kinda scared of doing a bad choice out of intellect. I'm scared of being a POS accepting Lea and making it really hard for her. Honestly, Lea's a fine woman who I could see myself with, I just know that half the time, I don't feel it.

so, 2 questions (answer any) :

\- is there a way to manufacture ""falling in love"" with someone ?

\- I'm putting my intellect and will in my relationship with Lea, but my emotion don't agree. Am I making a mistake, and if yes, could you explain why ? (any personnal experience is welcome).

Since you all had helped me with giving me advice on my now past relationship I need help with a friendship.

She is an elderly women around the age of my mother. We normally drink coffee few times a month and go to church together.

But since Christmas till last week I had the flu.
She kept asking for making an appointment to drink coffee and for some books I could take.
   I had repeatedly told and explained I was not feeling well and severely tired.
Also I needed to recover from the break up. 
Last week she called again, and got angry I was silent on the phone (I did make some mhm sound or said yes to let her know I was listening). I told her again I was very tired and couldn’t do much about it.

But now comes the breaking point.
Past Sunday I gave her some dates for us to drink coffee.
She called me very upset.
She said I needed to give her dates at least very early forward in the month.
I explained that wasn’t possible because I was sick and also I was waiting to get a heads up from people I sport with.
That it was alright so we could look to later dates.
She got even more angry and said I didn’t had some empathy. Repeatedly blaming I didn’t empathise. That I let her look bad etc etc. 
I said that isn’t true. 
She kept on blaming and her anger got even more severe because she didn’t like I said much back.
So I said I did had explained her a few times now already I was so tired and she knows it is all in hospital research and because I am not feeling well etc.
Also I mentioned I now feel I didn’t do things right and feels like she ticks on my fingers.

She exploded.

So eventually we hung up but she kept spamming me a lot and kept calling me.

I wrote her back I didn’t am angry or blaming or not empathising with her.
That I noticed she was very upset and maybe it’s better she takes more time for herself.
   She said some mean things and threatened to block me.
  I told her I’m drawing my boundaries now here and leave it there and wish her the very best.

Good to mention she has a bipolar personality disorder diagnosis.

Is this also narcissistic behaviour and did I handle it well?
If I get attacked like this I always doubt myself.

Starting out the first two months were great, I was so calm and collected, structured and regulated. I really thought that finally I could get my life in order. In those months i was on 30 and then 40mg after i ran out I upped my dose to 50mg just to see if that might be even better. 

First week into 50mg was still great, but after that anxiety started and I felt geeked out all day. Also my ADD felt worse than before. The physical feeling of anxiety was really bad, my thoughts were racing and i was obsessively thinking about every problem I have. I went down to 40 again, where it was better for a few days but then it started all over again. It turned me lethargic, depressed and everything felt hopeless on some days. Anything I did regarding diet or coffee etc. did nothing really. Day by day it felt more unpredictable how i was gonna feel, the only thing keeping me from stopping is that it still does some good but the tradeoff won’t be worth it over time. The worst part was that some days felt like fast forward, like I was on Autopilot and only woke up in the evening.

What I don’t understand is, what changed? I did everything the same as i’ve been doing so why is the thing that I thought will improve my life now making it worse than before?
I’m now trying MPH which i also don’t like but we’ll see. I’d love the Elvanse back that did so much for me.",1,1736859775.0,VyvanseADHD,4,1.0,False

1i15iip,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1i15iip/how_i_saved_a_brainwashed_luigi_fangirl/,How I saved a brainwashed Luigi fangirl.,"I was waiting to pick up my hot black coffee when I noticed a table full of suburban white women having a spirited conversation nearby. I'm not usually one to eavesdrop, but I couldn't help but notice they were talking about Brian Thompson, The martyr against unnecessary healthcare. 

Three of the four women were blown away by the CEOs performance and admired the strength and policy prowess he showed during his life. ""He looked so dreamy,"" one of the women remarked, ""I want to know how massive his cock was"" I gathered that these three broads were Luigioids who supported Luigi until hearing about his radical Islamic affiliation. 

When they started discussing his impeccable healthcare policies, I noticed the fourth woman chime in with some unkind words about CEO Brian Thompson. She was sporting a short haircut with a bright pink streak down one side, “Deny, Defend, Depose” earrings, and a nose ring, so her ignorance was no surprise.

 ""I just don't understand how you can support someone like him again after everything he's done to attack impoverished communities just because of his orgasmic appearance,"" she spouted, ""it's disgusting!"" The other women tried to dismiss her and move on, but the woman with the nose ring wasn't budging. She grew louder and more animated as she rambled about healthcare deaths and the wealth gap, eventually standing up and slamming down a few packets of Splenda in disgust when proven liar Luigi came up in the conversation. The Splenda slam was the last straw for the other three women. They all rose their feet and began shouting. ""WE ARE FACING A HEALTH CARE CRISIS RIGHT NOW,"" the woman with the nose ring said. “ I support healthcare for all too,"" one of the other women responded, ""but Brian Thompson is right when he says we must fight against unnecessary he-"" “SHUT UP” She screamed. It was at that point the woman with the nose ring snapped. She lunged at her friend, eyes filled with untamable poverty-stricken rage. An all-out catfight had broken out in front of my very eyes. It was pandemonium. I knew I had to act. 

Without regard for my personal safety, I stepped between the women and pulled them apart, separating them at arms' length from each other. ""Ladies, calm down, or I'll call your husbands and have them come deal with you,"" I told them firmly yet calmly. The cafe fell dead silent and I chastised the woman with the nose ring. I corrected her in a masculine manner, using facts, statistics, and a strong deep voice. I told her to educate herself, tune out the Luigioid propaganda, and join a megachurch. 

After I finished, the cafe began to slowly come back to life. I grabbed my coffee and headed for the door but stopped short. ""One more thing, Jessica,"" I said as I turned around. ""I'm going to need those earrings."" She hesitated momentarily, then removed her “ Deny, Defend, Depose”  earrings and placed them in my outstretched hand. ""Do you know why I had to do that, Jessica?"" I asked. The woman with the nose ring tucked her hair behind her ear and smiled before looking up at me, ""Because we're putting CEOs first from
now on, Mr. Dinner.""

This story is a few months old by now.

A bit of backstory:

one of our sites is a mall which doubles as our intervention center (basically: alarms go there and the guard working there gives our patrol drivers the keys for the object in question, sends them out to have a look and writes the reports. Part of the mall is also a big supermarket (by german standards), which is not under contract with us, but the company having them under contract (let's call them CO) sub-contracts us, because we are there anyway. We do not only investigate sabotage or break in alerts, but also if some of the freezers have issues (because mostly it is just a not fully closed freezer cabinet that needs to be closed and then the alarm resetted.

One fine sunday (so everything, including the supermarket and mall itself are closed) at 6 am when I just finished my first coffee, we got a call about one of those cooling alerts. no biggy, I grab the keys, call the patrol driver to me (because we are not allowed to go in there alone because we could steal stuff. so we go in pairs in there to watch each other) and have a look.

the freezer in question is a chest freezer. Odd, but not the first time. Everything seems fine, no big blocks of eyes where there shouldn't be ice from the cooling system overcompensating. So, probably just an false alarm, let's check the temperatur. The display is empty. Not good. Okay, let's see if we can at least reset the alert. Nope.

Okay, I am prepared and had the markets physical paper file with me, because you never know. So I look up the company responsible for the freezers (FR) because obviously that is a technical situation far above our capabilities and give them a call.

Me: ""hey, this is \[me\] from \[my company\], I am here in \[Market\] for an cooling alert and freezer \[position\] seems to be broken and according to our files you are responsible for them.""

FR: ""Yeah, we registered that issue and contracted CO originally. Why are YOU exactly there?""

Me: ""CO send us here... They do not send out people themself.""

FR: ""We told them to call someone from \[market\] because the chest freezer has broken and needs to be emptied and later repaired""

Me: ""Okay, gotcha. I will call someone from \[market\] and also inform CO to better look at your mails. Sorry to bother you.""

FR: ""not your fault"".

So I do exactly that. The guy from market  was not amused. especially after I told him that we will NOT empty out the freezer because a: we don't know where to put it and b: if something goes wrong or their inventory is wrong (because people steal in supermarkets, surprise), we will made responsible. But he understood it, so no biggy. Then I called CO.

Me: ""hey, this is \[name\] from \[company\]. I am calling you back because the cooling alert in \[market\]""

CO: ""yeah, I can see the alert is still not resetted""

Me: ""that's correct. The freezer is broken. I already talked with FR who alarmed you. You were supposed to not send out us, but someone from \[market\].""

CO: ""yeah, I can see that in their email""

Me: ""cool. Then we did you send out us instead of just telling us to inform someone from \[market\] or do so yourself?""

CO: ""because it is our procedure to send out you. Did you call someone from \[market\]?""

Me: ""you might want to change them, but that's your money. And yes I did, \[name\] will be here in about half an hour.""

CO just got this contract a few months ago at this point. Before that it was the three dots. They have their own issues of temporary confusion with alerts, but CO is a whole new level...",1,1736859294.0,securityguards,0,0.67,False

Note- Coffee has been rested for 15+ days, recommendation from one of the owners directly is a minimum of 15 days.

Method- 16 gms of coffee 50gm of bloom water bloomed for 45s. Pour1 70 gm in 15s and a 10s pause, Pour2 60gm in 20s and a 10s pause and the last pour ie Pour3 60gm in 20s draw down time of 3:20.

Flavour notes- When you take a whiff of the ground coffee it just smells like a jar of strawberry and orange jam. When you take the first sip of coffee its has a welcoming taste of orange juice with some pineapple and it finishes with a hint of pomegranate its not a super complex coffee but still friendly overall I would rate this a 8.2/10.

Comments- The coffee is more balanced when made with a flat bottom brewer (B75 with kalita-155 papers) and has a rose aroma to it with a slight rosewater finish but the finishing taste of pomegranate gets lost and a slight tartness decrease.

Had quite the discussion with iamshamtheman in the wee hours. I guess he doesn't like what I post. He's the only one. I'm a little miffed by his gatekeeping, and trying to tell me he's a real vagabond and I'm not. Other than that I think what he's doing is fine. Enough about that.

Woke up. Reddit. 'I should text my new friend and see if he's ready for some coffee.' Text sent. Phone rings. ""Hey. You ready to go get some coffee?"" ""Yeah. I'm already on my way out since I called and you didn't answer."" ""Give me five to get my act together and I'll be out of here."" Few things I take out of my pack back in pack. Bed prepped in case it rains. Me out of tent. Pack out of tent. Tent closed and locked.

Fifteen minutes going down three minute trail having to go around six inch deep puddles that are everywhere. This place was flooded. Feet wet. Almost walked through another established camp. 'Probably be fine, but due to people I've temporarily hung with in my travels almost getting in fights for accidentally doing same thing, not gonna risk it. It's early. I don't need any bullshit this morning.' Quick right. Finally make it out.

Off we go. Gas station. Check bank account to make sure I can cover coffee. See new email. 'Thank you for your ~$50 payment to Navionics' 'What?! There isn't $50 in there. That subscription has been auto cancelled for months. Wtf?' I don't have overdraft. I don't want it. When I'm out of money I'm done. Check account. All is well. Enough for coffee.

(Navionics is what I use for navigating the boat. Paper charts are being discontinued starting this month. Navionics is better anyway. It will connect to everyone's depth finders and give us all really accurate depth information. Really nice if you don't like pulling your 20,000 lb sailboat out of sand by hand with a winch all day. Having done it, I would like to never do that again. Plus all the other navigation stuff. We can leave reviews of places for other boaters. It's google maps for boating.)

Coffee. Cigarette. Library. 

11:45. Head to feed. ""They want me to drop my pack?"" ""Yeah."" ""Nope. I'm sure it will be fine. I've done it before. Not doing it today. I'll go grab a sandwich. Meet you back at the library."" ""Cool.""

Back towards library. Quick right to grocery store. Sandwich. Bottle of water. Off to library. Find a place to sit outside. 'What, no mayo and mustard packets? What kind of world are we living in? 😁' It turns out mayo was already applied. Some shelf-stable weirdness that was laid on there thick. Not very good, but I've eaten worse. Half of sandwich deposited in stomach. Other half rewrapped and in pack for later. Back inside library.

Friend pops back in. He's trying to get his ID back after losing a backpack. Has a decent job waiting on him. ""I just went to the social security office. There's one person in there needing help. They told me I had to make an appointment online and wouldn't let me in."" ""What in the fuck?"" Dude tries to make an account online to schedule appointment. No luck. Calls. Sits on hold until 5:00. Four hours. Nothing.

Back to camp. I leave him and go to my tent. Bed back in sleep mode. Wet shoes and socks off. Feet drying. Second half of sandwich eaten. Some leftover peanut butter and chocolate trail mix. Two tuna salad and crackers. Small amount of orange soda. 3/4 of bottle of water. Full. Caloried up for thirty-three degree night that's coming.

1i15a1k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1i15a1k/perpetually_exhausted_pigeon/,Perpetually Exhausted Pigeon ,"I'd like to start by saying how grateful I am for the things in my life that are zapping all my energy. While I absolutely need to vent, it doesn't take away from my gratitude for all I am and have.

I am 35F married to a wonderful and loving husband 40M. We are parents of two amazing children 14Yr. F and 9mo. F. Our fourteen-year-old is from a previous relationship from my early 20s. Her father is present in her life,  but all the parenting responsibilities (doctors appts. sports,, church, etc.)

My husband works remotely from home, ten hour days, five days a week. I work 40 hours a week outside the home and attend online school full-time. I am in school, junior year, earning my bachelors degree. The ultimate goal is to apply for law school. 

Fortunately, my mother-in-law helps watch our little one at our home, where my husband works remotely. Unfortunately, not only does my husband work ten hour days, he is also very much a stay-at-home dad. 

Besides my MIL, we have no other family help at all. What is more frustrating is that while my MIL watches the baby Monday-Friday 8 AM - 4 PM, (my husband starts work at 6 AM and works until 4 PM. I typically work 9AM - 5PM) and we are so grateful, we are still a massive support for her as well. We not only help support her financially, but at nearly seventy she requires a significant amount of care herself. 

We attend every doctor's appointment, help out around her home with daily chores and needs. We foot the bill for her cell phone, internet, some utilities, and all repairs for her home, car, appliances, etc., all while paying her $300 a week to watch the baby. We know it is not a lot, but it is what we can afford to do. 

On top of it all our teenager is very active. She is involved with sports, music, church, and of course friends. Weekdays and weekends are packed with driving her to school, different events, etc. While it is all very valuable and necessary,  it consumes so much energy and time! 

My husband and I both grew up in extreme poverty and have worked tirelessly our whole lives, separately and together, to achieve all we have. We own our home, and besides a mortgage and car payment, we are debt free, and have a meger savings. 

Again, we are happy and so grateful for all we have. We love our life and we love our kids, but we are so tired! We know what we are doing, all we are working for, is going to pay off, but it is hard right now. 

At this point all I want is one night out, just me and my husband, to have dinner, talk, laugh, and reconnect. A little ""us time"" to rest and reset. I want to take a long bath, enjoy a cup of coffee, and read my book uninterrupted. I want to attend a yoga class at my gym and then float around in the hot tub. It has been six years since our last vacation. When do we get a break? When do we finally get to enjoy all we are working so hard for?",1,1736858832.0,Vent,0,1.0,False
1i158ws,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1i158ws/cant_stand_my_bestfriend_anymore/,"cant stand my ""bestfriend"" anymore","So i (21) have this one friend (22F) and i cannot stand her anymore. She hasn't done anything bad per se, but she's not someone i feel comfortable around anymore. I'd appreaciate some input on what you think about all these things and some advice on how to navigate ending the friendship.

Here are all things that she does:

1. Can only talk about herself or the past. Whenever she has some issues going on and goes to me for advice, i always listen and give her advice. However, when i want to lean on her, she responds with ""yeah idk how to help you with that"" and turns the conversation back to her. She's stuck in the past as well and the only conversations we can have are about stuff that happened 10 years ago until last year.

2. She doesnt accept the word no. Whenever she wants to hang out and i say that i dont feel like it, she keeps begging. And she begs until i say yes.

3. She constantly asks for money back. When we go out for a coffee, or go out clubbing, she says ""this one's on me"" and months later she asks for the money back. Im talking about 1-3 dollars. Id understand if it were a lot of money, but why say a 1.80 coffee's on you, when youre just gonna ask for the money back? just say i'll pay it and can u please return it later instead of begging months later? I never request money back when i say somethings on me, neither do our other friends. Not to mention i was paying for a double subscription for a service for like two years bc she ""wasnt allowed to use her card (bs)"" and never said ""hey give me those 4 bucks"" every month. Not to mention i and our mutual friend drive her everywhere and still begs for money back. 

4. She talks all happy about her plans with our other friends in which im not included (shes the one that plans these things) in front of me. One time i even helped her bake something for our other friends and didnt even get a piece.

5. Whenever we come around to her place, everything is messy. My other friends and i have to sit on her bed full of dirty clothes, walk on the floor full of used cotton pads. Not to mention she walks around naked in front of us, when no one else does this and it makes us uncomfortable. I'll also be doing my makeup in her bathroom or something and she'll just come in and do number 2 infront of me. She has two bathrooms in the apartment.

6. She tends to be jealous and attention seeking. She admitted thats she was jealous when our friend and i got boyfriends. Later she got a boyfriend off tinder that she maybe went on a date with four times before becoming a couple. She feels the need to tell every detail of their intimate life, so far that after doing it she has to text me like ""omg i did this to him"". She also lies about pregnancy scares, she's said theyve had an accident like three times in the past 4 months. She first says she hasnt gotten her period, then suddenly she says shes got it, and then a week later says she actually didnt get it at all. Obv as friends we worry about that but to me it seems like shes doing that for attention.

7. She keeps begging to come to things shes not invited to. Me and our mutual friend got invited by a mutual friend of ours (who she does not know) to a birthday party and she asked both of us if she can come. We had to tell her multiple times that this is not organised by us and that we cant just invite someone. She then said ""oh okay i guess its better to ask than to just show up"" like ???. She kept asking to come along to me and my bfs dates, one time i was hanging out with her, and then i had planned to go on a date w my bf. She invited herself to our date, which i didnt have a problem with bc at first she said shes gonna stay until her bus comes (30 mins) and then she changed her mind and said ""ill just stay as long as u guys are here"". Luckly we had to go somewhere, cause otherwise we'd be stuck with her for hours. She also often invites herself to our friends dates, but her and her bf dont mind because they just ignore her.

She's really starting to annoy me and i dont know what to do. What do yall think of her? Should i just stop talking to her or should i just go through all of these things and why they bother me?",2,1736858727.0,FriendshipAdvice,2,1.0,False

You’re smart and capable—there’s so much more you could do. Go back to working, posting about coffee and makeup on Instagram, and start living authentically. You can’t sustain this rare cancer storyline forever with so many eyes watching. Dancing in bikinis and talking like a baby isn’t a long-term plan—it’s time to pivot. Use your education and talents to build something meaningful. With your background in environmental studies and government, you could make real change. Maybe even go back to LA and help rebuild the city. Even if TikTok stays, stepping back is the best move.  Get off the platform.   If you delete your content, the public will forget about your cancer narrative. It's your escape hatch for a simpler more authentic, healthy life.   The validation you’re seeking online isn’t real and only leads to disaster. Say you’re too busy with work and need to step away. Even your haters will respect this growth.  It’s your stolen valor narrative that has so many of us worked up. 

 **To Sydney’s family** (Austin (u/MikeFrancesaBurner, we see you) and friends: please step in. Encourage her to make responsible choices for her future. Inpatient therapy for her mental health and ED might help her reset and start fresh. Help her start a life she can truly be proud of.

It isn’t until the last couple of years where it really started to come to a head—after I had two kids and lack of sleep and ability to get out exercise really started to take it toll. I’ve been looking for a solution, supplements, medication counseling, etc. all of it feels like it hasn’t been enough to get me to where I need to be. My anxiety comes in big waves with feeling like I’m going to die suddenly or I have chest pains and my heart palpitation is going to end me at any moment. It’s terrible. Especially with kids.

Sort of desperate to find something that worked. I realize that I’ve always drank coffee and caffeine in the morning. I’m sure this is not a revelation for people on this, but this is a reminder that if you are drinking caffeine, you do suffer from anxiety. I highly recommend taking a break.

 Over the last two weeks have limited Coffees to 1/2 caff strictly, 1/2 calf And then twice a day I have a nun with no caffeine in it full of electrolytes…what I can only describe as one of the most intense changes to my mood and anxiety yet (I’m also exercising so there’s a note) there, but I feel a peace and a calmness that has been alluding me for a very long time 

Last week I decided to challenge this— 2 cups and I was wired once again, sinking feeling etc etc— what I noticed is it’s not so much in the morning when I feel my anxiety hit because of the caffeine it’s actually in the evening and the buildup over the day. with one half caff I find that I’m much calmer Stable and able to deal. 

Also important to note my sleep is shit right now and I’m hardly getting out to exercise so this pattern change feels even more dramatic given other factors not lining up.

This is a sign if you’ve been thinking about cutting out coffee or caffeine to give it a go because it could do wonders! good luck out there y’all maybe in a couple of months to see where things are at.",1,1736858390.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

1i15477,https://www.reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/1i15477/using_notion_for_4_years/,Using Notion for 4 Years,"Hi, everyone!

I’ve been using Notion for four years now, and I wanted to share my experience. I first came across the platform in 2020 while working at an electric motorcycle startup. Back then, our team had fewer than 20 people, and we used Trello to manage tasks, expenses, and various boards for each department, sub-area, and process. (You can probably imagine how chaotic it got!)

When we discovered Notion and saw the level of customization it offered, we were hooked. The possibilities were endless, and everything was so interconnected. We transitioned everything to Notion, and the tool grew alongside us. By the time we had 100 employees and a factory in another state, we were using Notion for *everything*. We essentially built a complete ERP system for production. It handled onboarding, purchasing, requests, production tracking, IT, development routines, and documentation. To work at the startup basically meant editing Notion.

Of course, as with most people who use Notion at work, I started using it for personal projects too. (I mean, who wouldn’t want to map their coffee habits with charts, right?) When the startup didn’t secure more funding, I found myself with extra time at home. That’s when I decided to create a Notion system to manage my family’s routine.

What started as a simple tool for tracking expenses and managing tasks became something much more meaningful when I got my kids involved. They now have recurring tasks, allowances linked to cards, and manage everything on their phones. My 7-year-old even checks and completes her tasks independently. The first time she took out the trash without me asking… I almost cried with pride!

**Key insights from my experience:**

* **Efficiency vs. Documentation**: At work, we often had to fill in countless tags and relationships in Notion, even if they didn’t feel particularly useful. I saw processes that took seconds to complete but required five minutes to document, just to look nice in a table that no one ever used. This can create unnecessary friction. In personal use, you only document what truly adds value, and this mindset should guide workplace setups too.
* **Focus on Processes, Not Tools**: It’s easy to fall into the trap of adapting your processes to fit Notion’s capabilities. While Notion can do *a lot*, its real value lies in improving your existing processes, not complicating them. For example, instead of building a flashy database for approvals that requires 10 fields and 3 tags, ask yourself: ""What’s the simplest way to get this done effectively?"" Use Notion to streamline and enhance, not overengineer.

Notion is an incredible tool, but its power comes from how it’s used. Whether you’re running a growing company, managing a family, or just organizing your personal life, the key is to make it work *for you*, not the other way around.

CLOCK-ROACH TIME! 🕰️ 🪳   
  
Because it’s always pest control o’clock. 🏴‍☠️   
Found a ton of German roaches hiding behind a clock on the wall. These pests really do love to make themselves at home—even in your decor!  
  
If you’ve ever turned on a kitchen light late at night and caught a scurrying cockroach, chances are it was a German cockroach. These little pests are notorious for invading homes and businesses, and once they’ve made themselves comfortable, they’re incredibly hard to evict. Here’s everything you need to know about German cockroaches and how to get rid of them for good.

**What Are German Cockroaches?**

German cockroaches (*Blattella germanica*) are one of the most common and stubborn cockroach species. They’re small, tan to light brown, and have two dark stripes running down their backs. Don’t let their size fool you—they’re prolific breeders and can infest your home in no time.

* **Size:** 1/2 to 5/8 inch long
* **Habitat:** Warm, humid areas near food and water (think kitchens and bathrooms)
* **Diet:** Pretty much everything, from crumbs to toothpaste
* **Reproduction:** A single female can produce up to 400 offspring in her lifetime!

**Why Are German Cockroaches So Hard to Control?**

1. **Rapid Reproduction:** German cockroaches reproduce at an alarming rate. If you see one, there are likely dozens more hiding nearby.
2. **Nocturnal Behavior:** They’re most active at night, making it hard to spot an infestation early.
3. **Hiding Spots:** These pests are masters of hiding, squeezing into cracks, crevices, and even behind your appliances.
4. **Resistance to Insecticides:** Over time, German cockroaches have developed resistance to many over-the-counter pesticides.

**Signs of a German Cockroach Infestation**

* **Droppings:** Small, dark droppings that look like black pepper or coffee grounds.
* **Egg Casings:** Brown, capsule-shaped oothecae (egg cases) in hidden areas.
* **Odor:** A musty, unpleasant smell caused by their pheromones.
* **Sightings:** Seeing cockroaches during the day is a sign of a severe infestation.

**How to Get Rid of German Cockroaches**

Getting rid of German cockroaches takes persistence and the right approach. Here’s how to start:

1. **Clean Thoroughly:**
   * Keep your kitchen spotless. Wipe down counters, sweep floors, and clean up food spills immediately.
   * Store food in sealed containers and don’t leave dirty dishes overnight.
2. **Eliminate Hiding Spots:**
   * Seal cracks and crevices where cockroaches can hide.
   * Fix leaky pipes and eliminate standing water.
3. **Use Baits and Traps:**
   * Gel baits are highly effective because cockroaches bring the poison back to their nests.
   * Use sticky traps to monitor their activity.
4. **Call a Professional:**
   * If the infestation is out of control, it’s time to call in the pros. Pest control experts have access to advanced treatments that target German cockroaches more effectively.

**Why You Shouldn’t Ignore a Cockroach Problem**

German cockroaches are more than just a nuisance—they’re a health hazard. They spread bacteria, trigger allergies, and contaminate food. The longer you wait to address an infestation, the worse it will get.

The way my mum reacted was very inappropriate in my opinion. The way she was talking about it was the same way that I would ask questions about a murder mystery on TV ('I wonder how he drowned' 'was he australian?' 'Oooh did he get stuck under the floating pontoon') and the tone of voice she used was very curious and upbeat. 

I found it very disrespectful and snapped at her. I didn't swear, I didn't yell, I just said that we don't know anything about what happened and that we should leave it alone. 

A child is dead, and my mother was talking about him like his death was a fun little puzzle that she might be able to figure out over her morning coffee. Absolutely no condolences to his family, just curiosity. 

I understand being curious over how someone died, especially at a place such as the lake where he drowned (it is notorious for being child-safe with no waves and a swimming-only area that is blocked off with floating buoys') but the tone of voice conveyed no sadness.

I work with an elderly lady who cannot make drinks or anything she just does some salad prep in the morning and leaves (she's very old and cannot operate the till) so front of house is all on me alone.

I tend to need to use the toilet between the hours of 10-11 my body has a pretty good clock (sorry for the information)
This morning I went to the toilet at 10:05 arriving back to work at 10:15 I had put up a sign saying will be back in 10 mins.

When I arrived back there was a mother there giving me a horrible look while rocking her child that was screaming. I approached the till to take her order and her first words to me were. ""It's really annoying to have to wait for you"", I apologized saying "" I'm sorry but I really had to use the toilet"".
The lady said ""well I have been waiting 10 minutes for you to come and take my order, that's not fair"".
I responded in a rather stern tone ""so what an I not allowed to use the toilet?"" And added ""I put the sign up for everyone to see you could have taken a seat"" (at this point I didn't know my colleague had asked her to do this).
Her response was ""I need my coffee so I can sit down and feed my kid so it will stop crying, and you weren't here"". I pointed to a sign we have up ith the company email and said of you want to make a complain because I had to use the toilet please go ahead. 

She then ordered me to make her a coffee and I refused I told her I don't like yer attitude and I won't ever be serving her. After this she apologized and I made the coffee. 

Did I over react?

1i14sa6,https://www.reddit.com/r/bumblebff/comments/1i14sa6/my_toxic_and_emotionally_destabilising_experience/,My toxic and emotionally destabilising experience on Bumble BFF 😔,"Okay, so I think everyone here agrees that the concept of Bumble BFF sounds amazing! An app to make meaningful friendships in a world where adult connections can feel harder than ever to build!? 

My recent experience with Bumble BFF has actually left me feeling emotionally vulnerable, deflated, questioning my judgment, and picking up the pieces to now heal from a friendship that turned out to be toxic. 

I’m here to share my experience and perspective to perhaps remind others to be careful, and also because it’s therapeutic for me to open up and share this in an anonymous space. 

Settle in for my novella (lol).. 

After countless matches that fizzled out, ghosted messages, and flakes (which I know many here have commonly experienced), I finally met Cassie* (not her real name). She was bubbly, warm, and we clicked instantly! As a neurodivergent woman, I often feel misunderstood or out of place in social settings, but with Cassie, the conversation flowed easily. I felt seen, understood, and genuinely excited about this budding friendship.

Over the next few months, we met up several times for coffee, fitness classes, and even brunches. Things felt easy—until subtle red flags began surfacing. Cassie would cancel plans last minute or ask to reschedule, only to drop them altogether. She rarely apologised or even acknowledged how her flakiness inconvenienced me, instead texting later as if nothing had even happened. At first, I brushed it off. Life is exhausting, and I get it. But the pattern kept repeating, and I realised I should have named it with her sooner. Anyhow, no big deal.. 

The cracks began to be more obvious when I had invited Cassie to a fun (rather pricey) event and offered her my spare ticket. She didn’t offer to pay me back the cost of the ticket, but I didn’t mind or expect her to so that was fine. She accepted enthusiastically, and we confirmed everything the night before. 

The day of the event, I texted her to let her know I’d arrived a little early, and she texted back “OMG! I thought it was tomorrow!” My heart sank, and an obvious pattern was emerging.

I encouraged her to come, and she did, albeit late, with a brief apology. While the event was fun, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off. 

THEN most recently- all alarm bells went off when we planned to attend a community hike weeks later, and she deliberately stood me up 😔

The night before, I sent a text to confirm. She didn’t reply, but given her history, I assumed she’d still show up. I got to the meeting spot early, texted her multiple times, and waited. And waited. After 30 minutes of standing alone, feeling embarrassed (I didn’t know anyone else there) and hurt, I left. 

On my drive home, Cassie texted to say she wasn’t coming because she’d assumed I wasn’t interested in our plans, so had made other plans. I started to cry. It turns out, she had based this decision on a completely unrelated incident where I’d taken two days to reply to a text earlier that week.

Her explanation floored me. Cassie admitted that my past delays in replying to her texts in general had “hurt” her and so she’d started intentionally delaying her reply times to mirror mine!? She also implied that I’d fallen short of her expectations in a solid friendship. 

Suddenly, it occurred to me that I had unknowingly been strung along in a series of unspoken “tests” to see how much I cared about the friendship. It also dawned on me that her previous cancellations and forgetfulness weren’t just flakiness or forgetfulness, they were deliberate tests designed to “measure my commitment”!! 

This revelation hit me like a ton of bricks. It explained so much: her vagueness about past friendships, the way she seemed to hold onto perceived slights, and her lack of accountability for how her actions affected me.

Being on the receiving end of these “tests” has actually now really messed with my head and bought up painful childhood memories. I’ve spent years in therapy working to create relationships that feel safe and supportive, yet here I am, questioning myself again because of someone else’s unresolved issues.

I’ve communicated to Cassie how this has made me feel while also acknowledging that perhaps her actions have come from a place of genuine past trauma/pain. She’s not apologised or acknowledged her actions or how they’ve impacted me at all. Needless to say, I’ve cut all contact with her. 

Unfortunately, my experience with Bumble BFF has left an extremely sour taste and I will not be back on it. My trust is shattered- but I don’t want to live that way. 

The app is kinda dangerous for anyone who may be emotionally vulnerable. It creates this weird “forced” dynamic, where you’re actively searching for reasons to invest in a friendship, often overlooking early red flags. Unlike organic friendships that develop naturally over time, Bumble BFF connections can feel rushed and artificial, making it harder to notice when something isn’t quite right.

While I’m now doing some work in therapy to heal from this experience, it won’t be anything I forget anytime soon. It’s been a reminder to trust in my instincts- if something feels off, it probably is. Uphold my boundaries and values, and to not let anyone make me feel guilty for expecting the basic decency of respect and emotional safety in a friendship.",2,1736857081.0,bumblebff,0,1.0,False
1i14rvb,https://www.reddit.com/r/hemorrhoid/comments/1i14rvb/struggling_with_recurring_rectal_bleeding/,Struggling with Recurring Rectal Bleeding,"Hi everyone,

I wanted to share something that’s been weighing on me and maybe get some advice or support.

Back in April 2023, I noticed blood in my stool for the first time. It really freaked me out, so I went to see a proctologist right away. They told me it was just hemorrhoids.

Since then, the bleeding hasn’t completely gone away. It happens about 3-4 times a month. I went back to the proctologist three more times, but every time they reassured me that it was nothing serious—just hemorrhoids.

In February 2024, I decided to get a colonoscopy to rule out anything more serious. Thankfully, everything came back clear except for Grade 1-2 hemorrhoids.

During the summer of 2024, I actually had about two months without any bleeding, which gave me some hope. Overall, I bled about 10 times in 2024, which was less frequent than in 2023.

Unfortunately, 2025 hasn’t started well for me. I’ve already had 7 days this year with bright red blood on the stool and toilet paper. It’s really discouraging. I’ve also noticed that coffee seems to make things worse, but cutting it out entirely has been tough.

I feel my mood slipping again because of all this. My next doctor’s appointment isn’t for another two months, and even though I’ve been told multiple times that it’s “just hemorrhoids,” I can’t shake the fear that it could be something more serious.

I guess I just needed to get this off my chest. Thanks for listening.

If anyone has gone through something similar or has any tips, I’d really appreciate it.",2,1736857037.0,hemorrhoid,0,0.75,False

Got married at 19 and 21. Had a pretty up and down marriage. We have 3 kids. We both did really bad things in our marriage. He’s always been very controlling to the shows I watch, how much I talk to my family. My sister used to do only fans and corn. He would partake and watch. He has always had a problem with a sex addiction corn addiction. I was pregnant with our second child. He wanted to tie me up for fun he ended forcing a n a l when I was screaming to stop. I never got over it. He uses sex as a weapon the only way he wants love is through sex. He would make me wear short skirts or dresses so he could watch people upskirt me. If I said no he was mean and would put me down. I have a problem with lying because even if I was honest he would twist it and would be so angry at me. But if he did something like jerk off in front of our window on a busy street wanting woman to see I was in the wrong. He recently started taking steroids and he became violent, just yelling at first. 2 weeks ago he got mad at me. He through my laptop, broke 2 glass bowls got physical with me. Then I was sleeping and I woke up to him jerking on me. Then he said he’s jerked off on me while sleeping 5 other times in the last month then says I don’t love him but I don’t have sex with him. He says I’m the reason he has a corn addiction. It’s not all him. I’m in the wrong too I’ve don’t things that aren’t okay. I cheated because I was so unhappy which I know is completely wrong. I was very young and it wasn’t okay. I don’t know how to talk to him because there is no talking to him. He can never just accept it let it go and move on. He gets so emotional like beyond when it’s something minor then after 2 hours of talking he’ll bring it up again. Then we talk again then after a day or 2 he wants to talk about it again. It’s so exhausting and I have been unhappy for a long time but never wanted to hurt my kids. Just yesterday I went to the coffee shop to get a coffee and he the first thing he says is was a dude helping you. He questions and controls everything I do or say. If I don’t hold his arm at the grocery store boom I’m in trouble I’m a terrible wife. I’m just so scared to be a single mom. I haven’t worked in 12 years I never went to college I have no idea what I’m gonna do. I’m emotionally ruined. I never want to have sex again because it’s a chore. He would also show girls his friends videos of us having sex he would show them videos of himself he said he showed his step sis his penis. He thinks sex makes it better. Even if I’m tired of having kids all day cooking cleaning after school activities and doing night time routine and if I don’t have sex with him in the bad one then he treats me horribly. I have no social media I’m not allowed to watch shows like housewives I’m not allowed to wear certain clothes anymore. I recently lost 40 pounds and he tells me how unattractive I am but still wants sex. I know if I read this I would say it’s a good thing I’m just so scared. I feel in my marriage I have to always thing of him in the back of my head I have always think before I do what I say what I do if I make small talk with the cashier he gets so mad at me. I’ve lied throughout our marriage because he was mean when I lied and he was mean when I told the truth there was no win win either way it was always my past that got brought up never his. And I’m tired I want to live myself again I have no confidence I’m so broken and sad and I know this isn’t how a marriage should be. Just help. Don’t shame me I already have enough.

**Recycling collection**
Once again my recycling was not picked up.  WHEN it's picked up it is in the morning.  It is now 1:48 PM.  I'm assuming that it won't be picked up again.  This is getting ridiculous.  I pay my bill and yet getting service is effy.  Yes....before you ask....my recycling container was put out at 11:30 pm last night.  When can I expect collection????

I believe it belonged originally to my great-grandparents. So l'm guessing this is probably from the mid 1800s - early 1900s.

I’m from England and assume it’s from the UK - but I don’t know! 

Is it a water / wine / coffee jug?
The markings on the bottom show stamps of various sorts. And some scratched numbers - maybe from servicing or dealing?

If anyone can help me identify its name... and its material make up, manufacturer and country of origin id be very grateful!

Back and forth we looked and smiled at each other, but nothing serious. We didn't even talk although we had plenty of chances. We didn't take them because we are stupid, socially awkward. Next problem is, we are both not very emotional – I'm autistic and he shows some symptoms as well. I don't have problems interpreting signals (at least I'm not better than most neurotypicals) but sending them is an issue for me. So I have seemed distant at occasions where I didn't want it.
Anyway. The signals never really stopped (but for one embarrassing situation I put myself in) and he even came up to me the last time we saw each other with a big grin to talk to me. He got interrupted so it didn't go anywhere.
Although we never really stopped to express at least nonverbally that ""there is something"" I can feel he is getting tired of it and I do as well.

I really think I've trapped myself here though. I can't think of anything different than him and a possible future with this guy for MONTHS now. We have almost no connection and didn't even talk! It's frustrating, it hurts, especially because of the load of uncertainty around it.
I thought about just letting everything pass, since we won't see each other that much in the future, but that's obviously easier said than done.
Since we have professional relationship with each other (don't worry, no power-dynamics or anything) I just asked him professionally for a meeting via E-Mail. Just to strike up a conversation, maybe destruct my uber-elevated picture of him, maybe to develop something out of it if he still likes me or can see us having a coffee some time. If not, it was just a professional meeting after all (although I'm not quite sure what I could ask him to not make it weird).
I don't want to creep him out with this and I also don't want to waste his time if I misinterpreted his behaviour in the past.
A rejection would hurt but this state our ""relationship"" is in is AWFUL. We'll see if it will work out this way.",1,1736856736.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False
