1huzsfw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rosacea/comments/1huzsfw/just_got_diagnosed/,Just got diagnosed ,"Hello all,
I just got back from the derm with the diagnosis rosacea. 

I had some red spots near my mouth and chin, which don’t hurt or else, but yeah, here we are. He told me to use some cream I have to pick up at the pharmacy later and to see him again in three months. 

At the doc I was pretty floored and didn’t get to ask how to deal with it besides his recommendations (avoid sun, heat, hot drinks, spicy food and peelings). I never had any issues with my skin before and am unsure about skincare. What else besides fragrance free do you advise? I am located in Germany, if this helps. 

I had a baby 9 months ago (because of the cream from the doctor my breastfeeding journey has to end now, bummer), eat vegan, didn’t drink alcohol since getting pregnant and drink one cup of coffee a day. 
Sweets are my guilty pleasure, I will try to eat less. 

Thank you all in advance for this community, I hope all of our skin will find peace. ",1,1736172390.0,Rosacea,0,1.0,False

My mentor is based in the same city as me while my manager is based in another city. I was wondering if it's appropriate to send coffee chat invites to my teammates' calendars to get to know the other people on my team? Also, should i send a quick self intro in my team's channel? It seems to be used for mainly serious stuff so I kind of feel awkward sending messages there. I've already met most of my team face to face in the office

Im an international student applying who‘s graduating in Fall 2026, I genuinely love agriculture and it has been one of my passions for years together, im going to post my application and I would love for you guys to tell me what you think :))

Grades: Pretty bad, but I made the honor roll and the deans list throughout, I had a B- and a C throughout all of my semesters for math and English respectively, with A’s in every single other subject :(. But this year I have a 37/42 in the IB syllabus. I know my grades aren’t the best, which is why I’m putting my extracurriculars below. I’m going to say a 3.75 GPA throughout. I’ve still got to finish my SAT.

I’ve also gotten highest in my grade for Math (this year), I also passed the IGCSE course with distinction.

EC’s: Visited multiple farms and estates through high school, with great rec letters. I started a fundraiser to maximise positive socioeconomic impact through the purchase of new technologies for small scale farmers. I lived on a massive estate with daily wage laborers every summer and worked with them, experiencing everything that they did (picking coffee, sweeping leaves etc…). I worked with the equivalent of a US congressman to create and develop websites to help assist farmers in times of crisis, we launched the websites last month :).

School related EC’s: Participated in multiple Model United Nations, chaired multiple committees in Model United Nations, i will also be applying for a position in the secretariat next year, hopefully I get in :). In addition to this, I also am leader of my grade in the student government.

Social work: Donated 10,000 newspapers to a veterans home near me, they sell these papers to fund their organisation. I also funded 3 large ventilators and worked with the home to supply meals for the elderly veterans. I also worked in a small preschool, helping educate young children. I also helped provide stationary for all the students at the school.

If you’re still here, genuinely, thank you :). 😄😄😄😄😄. Please let me know what you think of my application, I’ve always wanted to go to Columbia and did a summer program there as well. You guys are all amazing, have a great rest of your day/night/afternoon! :)",1,1736172163.0,APStudents,1,1.0,False

Can The King of Pop Shape Your Success as a Business Mom?,"https://preview.redd.it/nq3zu8qu8etd1.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5a7bd7df5051e732a073016b7e4fae0f50d25f

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

1huzp07,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1huzp07/the_grind_doesnt_have_to_be_lonely/,The Grind Doesn’t Have to Be Lonely,"Alright, let’s dive into the world of entrepreneurship—a wild ride where triumphs can make you feel like you’re walking on clouds, and setbacks sometimes have you wondering why you even thought opening a business was a good idea (spoiler: it was, but the road is bumpy). One key ingredient in this entrepreneurial recipe? Community and support systems. Seriously, I can’t stress this enough. 

Imagine trying to navigate the choppy waters of running a business all by yourself. It’s like being a sailor without a ship’s crew. You’re bound to get lost in the storm—or worse yet, capsized by waves of doubt. Having a solid support system is like having your crew—people who’ve got your back, share your struggles, and make the journey a little less lonely. Plus, they often provide insights that are worth their weight in gold.

So, how do you find or create this precious community? Let’s break it down.

**1. Seek Out Fellow Entrepreneurs:** Start with local networking events or entrepreneurial meet-ups. These folks are on the same rollercoaster as you, and you might just find a kindred spirit. It's like looking for fellow warriors in the trenches; you can share war stories, successes, failures, and even the occasional dramatic eye-roll over something that went hilariously wrong.

**2. Leverage Online Platforms:** In the age of technology, there’s literally no excuse to feel isolated. Think social media groups, online forums, or platforms like LinkedIn. Join entrepreneurial groups and engage. Before you know it, you’ll be exchanging ideas and strategies with people from around the globe. It’s like a giant virtual coffee shop where everyone can dive into the conversation—and the coffee’s always hot.

**3. Be the Connector:** Sometimes, the best way to build up a community is to become a facilitator. Start a mastermind group. Invite people from different industries to share insights. Trust me, when you bring people together, you’re not just networking; you’re creating a mini-ecosystem of support. You'll be amazed at how much everyone can learn from each other.

**4. Attend Workshops and Seminars:** Look for workshops that focus on skills you want to improve. You’ll not only gain knowledge but also meet others who are just as eager to learn. It’s like hitting two birds with one stone—growing your skill set while expanding your network. Win-win!

**5. Foster Genuine Relationships:** The foundation of any solid community is trust and authenticity. Don’t just reach out when you need something—be the person who offers support too. Send a message of encouragement, celebrate others’ wins, and be there when things get tough. It’s kind of like being the glue that holds the group together, which is a pretty awesome role to play.

The beauty of community is that it not only lifts you up during tough times but also celebrates those incredible highs with you. Think about how Scripture encourages us to do life together (Ecclesiastes 4:9-10, anyone?). Two are better than one because they have a good return for their labor. So, let’s band together, support one another, and navigate this entrepreneurial journey as a united front!

As you embark on this quest for community, remember that the connections you make can fuel your dreams and ignite your growth. Be open, be brave, and don’t underestimate the power of a supportive crew. We’re all in this together, so let’s roll up our sleeves and get to work—because a thriving community is the secret sauce to entrepreneurial success!",1,1736172119.0,HustleAndFaith,0,1.0,False

She plays a video game which I used to play a lot so I redownloaded it and we started playing together almost every night, sometimes until 8am. We’d chat about stuff and get to know each other and I’d flirt a bit but I never seemed to get much back only a few giggles or thanks.

I’ve invited her out on dates but she’s always busy or is sick or doesn’t have the money. To which I’ve been understanding of or even offered to pay for her. The only times we’ve met has been when she needed to go to the shop or was out and I drove to pick her up get her a coffee then drop her off home. We also went out a few times for a night out, the first was with my mates at a pub and she was there with her mate and she was only going to stay 30 mins but I convinced her to stay out and I walked her home. The second was on new years after I had a few drinks at my friends we all left pretty early so I walked an hour to meet her with her friends.

I’ve invited her to my house a few times but she says she wants to take things slow and doesn’t want to rush things which I’m fine with. I only invited her to mine because she had no money so I thought watching a movie in would be easier than going out somewhere.

A few odd things that have made me worried, firstly I was out with my friends a few weeks after we started talking and I saw her friend out and I said “hey (name)” and she freaked out and asked who the hell I was. She also doesn’t want her parents to know I exist yet for some odd reason she’s been very quiet about me to them and even makes me drop her off around the corner so they don’t see my car. I showed one of my friends who is a girl our messages and she said it wasn’t a good, she mentioned that I tend to message quite a lot more than she does but it wasn’t a major issue just something I had to think about.

I don’t really know if she is into me or what’s happening with us because I do really like her I just can’t tell what to do in this situation or if I’m wasting my time.",1,1736172097.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

This post is concerned with the issue of rosters. No judgement whatsoever to anyone who does, but I just simply cannot fathom it in my experience. Maybe Im rather oldschool, maybe I dont live in reality, idk which one it is. I could never operate like that. Im too much of a feeler and monogamous and I do take people seriously. I crave connection, I invest fully in the person im seeing and my focus is solely on them.

Do people really go out on dates while simultaneously entertaining a bunch of other people, having them lined up, actively sleeping with them etc? So assuming im going out on a date with a guy whom I really like and want things to progress further, do you understand how much of a clown that makes me look - sitting across the table from him, talking, enjoying our coffee/meal, having a great time together, exchanging compliments, hearing him say how he'd love to get to know each other more ... to only know he's texting a bunch of other girls after we're done and have idk how many sleepovers with different women weekly? Like do you understand how detrimental that is for someone who views the person seriously and wants to date them? What's the point of taking me out or showing interest? Is it a competition of ""whoever from my roster impresses me more I'll take more seriously?"" Do they even have the time or headspace to develop feelings, process or think things through? Or do they senselessly jump from one thing to another completely numb and desensitised just ""for the plot""?

Ofc I can't say anything, it's their life, their right, their mentality. But do you see how for people who are genuine and want to connect with someone it's an ABSOLUTE CATASTROPHE? Like we'll go out, I'll like him more and more each time, will start falling for him to only know Im just a number on his list and he's only seeing me because some other number dropped him or it didnt work out ... ?

I have a date coming up with a 24yo guy I matched on Tinder... what should I do? How to best approach this? Should I go there entirely no expectations, casual, friendly etc? Not take him seriously at all? He compliments me and is super excited to see me now that Im returning back (I left our hometown for uni within the first week we met but we kept in touch and now we're meeting during my winter break). Should I show my interest? Should I just view it as a one-time meeting and then nothing? What if he expects s3x or ONS and takes it as a given that that's what we're here to do ... ? Even if the concept of rosters is real, who would admit it upon asking? It's like an unspoken/unwritten ""rule"" kinda ...

1huzkrb,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1huzkrb/my_notgf_f26_and_i_m25_are_fighting_over_a/,My Not-Gf (F26) and I (M25) are fighting over a backstory that happened 2 (and more) years ago. Now she forced me to apologize if I wanna stay with her. ,"So this is a burner account since my SO sometimes watches me scrolling through reddit or was once interested in my posts so far which mostly concern PC-building or commenting on cringey stuff so I am more than fine with that. But here I want to get this off my chest and not fear the risk of being judged by her afterwards without hiding my phone from her or anything. 

And I warn you, this is a long one. On me: I am often considered that Dad-Joke guy in the friend group and I try to be nice to everyone since I haven't had many friends in my childhood and all of me hates being neglected and rejected and I hate fighting more than anything else.

All the trouble started more than 3 years ago when I ended up sleeping with a former friend (F27) when we were out partying, it was a one time thing, we talked about it afterwards, all good, still friends, and she even became the GF of one of my (former) buddies (M28). This was in 2021 and in beginning of 2022 the friend even told me her part time job as a student-assistant was offering jobs so I took it and we became colleagues but rarely worked together.

  
Timeskip, mid 2022 and I get together with my not-anymore-GF and over the course of the first 6-8 months of our relationship, she gets to know me and my backstory; I was quite 'active' (had 4 relationships and about 8 ONSs) while she was still a virgin, only kissed. which was totally fine to me (why not). Now she comes from an all-girls-school and very catholic region, so her view on One Night Stands and several relationships is not a favorable one, while I abolished the thought of marrying the first love after my first two relationships (first long distance and second left for another guy). She always made me feel bad for having intercourse outside a relationship and even tho some of her friends also had done so, she judged me more than them which is understandably I guess. 

Back to the story, she was really NOT AT ALL understanding that I was still friends with someone I slept with and there must be feelings and one can not talk about it and settle it and she then wanted me to just tell her nothing about the other woman (which was already in a relationship with my buddy, whom my gf didnt understand as well)

Then one month later, after meeting her on the run and both eyeing each other weirdly (my male perspective) she told me to tell her whenever the female friend texts me or has a shift with me or wants to meet up for a coffee or anything concerning her. After I did so for 2-3 weeks she again told me she wants to know nothing about the friend because she 'always pictures us doing it in her mind whenever I just mention the name' and a few days later, 2 weeks or so from christmas I had a shift with the friend and my GF, who never wanted to enter the building I/we worked, decided to surprise me after leaving the pre-christmas-party from her part-time job and was more than furious when she saw me working with the friend (we have seperate desks, a few meters distance in between). I ran after her since my shift was done anyway and she threw some slurs at me and blamed me for her running into the other woman and I could have warned her and so on. 

Then in february the following year (2023) my gf couldn't hold it any longer and told me to break up with her or cut the friendship with the other woman who also just quit the part-time job since she was done with her studies. In the previous month we had several fights on the topic, mostly her blaming me for being friends with that woman and making me afraid to drink because in november '22 I also wasn't the nicest guy when we went out to party, I just was drunk and imo she was clingy and jealous of any female being near me, long story short, I was Mr. Not-so-nice-guy. Anyway that led to me drinking with a few buddies in my home-town, she asking me the next day how my evening went, I lied and 20 minutes later I admitted it and she was devastated (rightfully so) and threatened me to break up.

So again to february, she put me in a position to choose relationship or friendship and gave me 2-3 days to think about it and so on and I am a guy, I do not want to hurt anyone and when it comes to choosing whom to hurt, I become somewhat paralyzed and can't decide and she knows that. After the few days she said if I can't choose her, that means I definitely choose the friendship and we are over. In the following days she texted me quite often blaming me for leaving me and not fighting for her and I didn't have the heart to block her since I believed in us getting back together and wanted to stay in contact even if it hurt so much.  

After 2 months and me ending the friendship as well because I always had to think about the break and the couple, my ""friends"" not even batting an eye besides an ""I'm sorry"", made me feel left alone and I did not need such people whom I thought were my friends and did not want to hurt in the end hurt me even more.

In May 23 me and my Not-GF got back together, it was hard but we tried it and I did a lot of things to make her feel as wanted as she told me she have needed to feel that way a few months earlier. And even back then she made me talk bad about myself or she wants to leave me again and I complied since I wanted nothing more than to be with her. After a friend of hers talked a lot of sh\*t about me for 2 weeks straight she became unsure and after not answering my phone one time in july because I was busy with work (a field trip asking tourists to fill out questionnaires which she also attended), she told me I did not change a bit and her friend was right and she wants to break up with me again and she called me a lot of things the following day again for not fighting for her and so on (I didn't change a bit and so on).

A few days later we texted again since she was feeling lonely in her student-appartement but couldn't drive home since exams were coming up and she just wanted to talk out a few things and I still loved her and wanted to be with her so I responded. We came to terms that we both still have big feelings for each other and want to be in a somewhat-relationship but without calling it as such because she doesn't want to tell her friends and family, since they all thought she was angry with me and she 'cried so much about me to them that she can't come back to them with me as they will think she is crazy and she does not want to be left without her friends, one actually also told her that he will cut her out if she comes back with me'.  
I complied and said, hey whatever makes you happy I am fine with. 

In september 23 we were fighting again and while sitting with a friend of mine (I was completely honest with my friends and family since I think, who does not want to see me in a happy relationship can go), he asked me if I want to be treated like that and just eat it or stand up for myself and I told her I am done with her fighting over little things and so on, I just wanted peace (between us and for my inner self). It was the first time I told her I want to go and she didn't take it very well and called me half an hour later to tell me she needs me just to hold her now for the evening and it is my fault since I made her cry and break down, so it is my obligation to care for her, at least now. I did go back to her and things were fine afterwards, just minor fights over everyday struggle like every other couple but she reminded me every now and then that we are not in a relationship and she still doesn't want to be in one even though we are like that for over a year by now. That's why I call her my Not-GF. We also discussed life-plans and moving together and so on but I am becoming a teacher in Germany and after uni the state sends you around 4 times in 2 years to teach at different schools which is the second part of the state exam. That also troubles us both since I can be 'stationed' up to about 2,5 hours away and we both are not really into weekend-relationships and she says she does not want to deal with me being away when she doesn't love me as she used to and us not being in an official relationship.

There were also a few other things that I want to mention:   
\- We were fighting very harshly sometimes while I was at the part time job and she at home and we both cried while being on the phone and I hid in the printer room. After one of that fights she installed Bumble looking for other guys for around 15-20 minutes and afterwards told me about it and being sorry but somehow managing it to present it like it is my fault to treat her so bad that she felt the need to install it.   
\- She also tells me she wants a guy who is 4-5 years older than we are since he would be more mature than I am. This hurts me a lot every time she tells me and she knows about it and has already used it just to hurt me. She sometimes threatens to leave me for some older guy, not specific, just someone older.  
\- When we fight, she usually becomes so enraged that neither me crying nor asking her to stop fighting/take a deep breath and calm down changes anything in the current situation. I am one of those guys who try their best to understand teir woman's feelings but I am no pro at it, not at all, so I am sometimes misinterpret what she wants me to do/say/ask.   
\- I have also made a few mistakes or taken something the wrong way and am of course on angel myself but I always try to do what is best for her and for me.  
\- We both were there for each other in times of 'great need' when either one needed someone to talk to or to vent from work/studies and we also have a lot of lovely memories like dancing in the kitchen, piggyback rides from the bus to my appartment and more.  
\- She wants to not-be-in-a-relationship so she can seperate from me easier when she feels the need to

  
Now the reason for all this:  
Up until yesterday, everything was fine and we were happy, had dinner, went for a walk and so on. She just happened to find an author for her thesis that has the same last name as the former female friend and she asked me if I know whether they are related, which I said no to. This morning we woke up and (me half-asleep) she asked me something, we talked for a couple of minutes and she mentioned installing Bumble, can't recall the exact words but I stopped smiling and told her it is not funny and hurts me and somehow the convo changed to the author with the same last name and she asked me how I could have intercourse with a girl-friend and not knowing her dad's name. Next thing I know is she tells me she knows how I feel about the bumble-thing, jumps out of bed, slams the door shut behind her and start her morning routine, not saying another word. A few minutes later she asks me to leave her appartement (which she often does when she is mad to ensure I know who is the boss in her flat and she also already ran out of mine, I guess all that to create distance) and I say, ok, fine, get my stuff and she start shouting and I shout back ( I hate it because a former GF and my dad did it) that she doesn't need to shout, she cries, I cry, I leave the appartement, drive back to my place, an hour later she texts me again, I left some stuff at her place and we start texting about the friend from back then again and she asks me one or two new questions she never asked me ever before and I answer honestly since I promised to never lie to her again and I stand up to that. A bit more fighting via text and we are more or less ok again. Then she calls me since she has a technical question and afterwards she wants me to apologize (which I did already three times this morning for the same thing) and she tells me a couple of things she wants me to apologize for, including she was right, the former female friend is weird and we hate her and I have the main fault for our first break-up since I didn't realize what that did to her and I wasn't responsive enough to her behaviour back then.

I did apologize like she wanted even though I did not want to. I feel like I am happy and fine with our situation in total while on the brink of fighting and breaking apart every second. I told her so a few times the past year and she always told me I can go if I want to.

After today's fight I am just so confused, she even asked me for help with printing and if I wanted to go for a walk with her later this day (after the fight) but she also told me she doesn't know what happens to us and my question is:  
What is the right thing to do? Stay? Leave? Take the risk of a happy life or being devastated even more? For context, I have my state exam in 1.5 months (Mid-Feb until End-March) so I can't really risk any huge breakdowns since I handle loss very bad. I also started crying 2 times while writing, I am just so overwhelmed right now and don't see any right or wrong just hurt. I also don't think she enjoys fighting but she told me just today blaming me and throwing it into my face makes her feel better. Tho she also cried.

No judgement whatsoever to anyone who does, but I just simply cannot fathom it in my experience. Maybe Im rather oldschool, maybe I dont live in reality, idk which one it is. I could never operate like that. Im too much of a feeler and monogamous and I do take people seriously. I crave connection, I invest fully in the person im seeing and my focus is solely on them.

Do people really go out on dates while simultaneously entertaining a bunch of other people, having them lined up, actively sleeping with them etc? So assuming im going out on a date with a guy whom I really like and want things to progress further, do you understand how much of a clown that makes me look - sitting across the table from him, talking, enjoying our coffee/meal, having a great time together, exchanging compliments, hearing him say how he'd love to get to know each other more ... to only know he's texting a bunch of other girls after we're done and have idk how many sleepovers with different women weekly? Like do you understand how detrimental that is for someone who views the person seriously and wants to date them? What's the point of taking me out or showing interest? Is it a competition of ""whoever from my roster impresses me more I'll take more seriously?"" Do they even have the time or headspace to develop feelings, process or think things through? Or do they senselessly jump from one thing to another completely numb and desensitised just ""for the plot""?

Ofc I can't say anything, it's their life, their right, their mentality. But do you see how for people who are genuine and want to connect with someone it's an ABSOLUTE CATASTROPHE? Like we'll go out, I'll like him more and more each time, will start falling for him to only know Im just a number on his list and he's only seeing me because some other number dropped him or it didnt work out ... ?

I have a date coming up with a 24yo guy I matched on Tinder... what should I do? How to best approach this? Should I go there entirely no expectations, casual, friendly etc? Not take him seriously at all? He compliments me and is super excited to see me (I left our hometown for uni within the first week we met but we kept in touch and now we're meeting during my winter break). Should I show my interest? Should I just view it as a one-time meeting and then nothing? What if he expects s3x or ONS and takes it as a given that that's what we're here to do ... ? Even if the concept of rosters is real, who would admit it upon asking? It's like an unspoken/unwritten ""rule"" kinda ...

But I'm looking for some feedback on why I don't like some coffees I've recently tasted.

I recently started a subscription to Driftaway Coffee in Brooklyn, and as a way of curating your subscription they send you a tasting box where you do a blind cupping of five different coffees. I went in expecting that I'd prefer lighter to medium roasts over darker roasts, and that I'd prefer naturals over washed. But I was a bit surprised by the results.

By far my favorite was the following: Triunfo Verde, Kilimbi, & Finca Amalieth, from Mexico, Rwanda, and Costa Rica. This was the darkest of their roasts, washed, with a mix of varietals. It had tasting notes of Dark Chocolate, Toast, and Baking Spices. I loved this coffee because it really reminded me of a natural - pungent, citrusy, sweet. (link no longer exists for this one)

And then there were two coffees I really did not enjoy:

1) [Chalatenango La Joya from El Salvador](https://driftaway.coffee/portfolio/eljd/). Next to the darkest of their dark roasts, washed, Pacas, Bourbon, and San Pacho varietals, and with tasting notes of Almond, Brown Sugar, and Dark Chocolate. To me this coffee was really stiff, almost espresso-like, or like a very dark chocolate.

2) [Mt Elgon Mother's Microlot from Uganda](https://driftaway.coffee/portfolio/umhm/). Medium roast, washed, SL14 varietal, with tasting notes of Cacao nibs, Brown Sugar, and Star Anise. This to me tasted quite bitter and smoky. I didn't enjoy it.

But now I'm confused. I don't know how to make sense of this in terms of informing my future coffee purchases. It isn't as simple as ""I prefer light roasts over dark roasts,"" or, ""I prefer this processing method over this one."" There is a lot of consistency across these, even in terms of tasting note. One coffee with a tasting note of dark chocolate I loved, while the other I didn't.

1huzhp4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ratemybin/comments/1huzhp4/rate_my_bin_a_concept_picture_unavailable/,"Rate my bin (A concept, picture unavailable.)","Imagine walking down a quiet, urban street on a crisp afternoon, the pavement glistening faintly under the low, golden rays of the late afternoon sun. You approach a **metal trash bin**, standing at the corner of the sidewalk near a bustling intersection. Its structure is sturdy, crafted from a dull yet polished steel that shines with an almost mirror-like quality where the sunlight strikes. The surface is a blend of sleek, modern design, yet bears the wear and tear of years of service—small scratches and dents hint at its long history.

The bin’s base is round, with a wide, flat bottom, though it’s slightly tilted to one side as though it has been jostled by a recent gust of wind or a careless passerby. Around the edges of the bin, you can see areas where the steel has dulled, scuffed by years of contact with rough surfaces. The scratches are shallow but numerous, forming intricate, intersecting patterns of light and shadow that give the metal an almost tactile feel. Some of these marks have darkened over time, forming streaks of oxidation and grime that stubbornly cling to the metal, a testament to the bin’s exposure to the elements.

A small, triangular section of the lid is slightly lifted, revealing the contents inside. The lid itself is heavy, constructed from the same brushed steel, but the surface is more tarnished here. Tiny specks of rust form small, irregular dots, mostly near the hinge mechanism. The hinge itself is a work of mechanical art—seamless, but showing signs of age. It's worn down from years of use, with a faint film of grease around the edges where it connects to the body of the bin. The lid’s rim, where it meets the body of the bin, is slightly misaligned, making a tiny but noticeable gap.

Inside the bin, the trash has accumulated in a disorganized, haphazard pile. Crumpled paper—some with advertisements or print material, others just wadded-up fast food wrappers—forms the top layer. The paper is a mishmash of crinkled textures: some sheets still retain their crispness, while others are soft and limp from moisture. The edges of these papers are frayed, and you can spot the remnants of bright colors from ink stains, now smeared and faintly visible on the now-grimy surface.

Next to the paper, a **crushed soda can** lies half-sunk beneath a heap of discarded packaging. The can is a beautiful paradox, its smooth aluminum surface warped and buckled where it has been tightly crumpled, its once-sleek contours now jagged and twisted. The **soda can’s metallic sheen** is still visible in places, though it’s peppered with faint speckles of dirt and grime. A light layer of condensation from the can’s last use is visible, leaving subtle water droplets that form microscopic beads of moisture that catch the light at odd angles.

A small plastic **bottle** lies next to the can, partially crumpled and tightly sealed, its label peeled off in strips, leaving behind only the faintest impression of color. You can see the **wrinkled texture** of the plastic, its curves collapsing inward as it has been squeezed out of shape, the creases more pronounced where the plastic is thinner. A few stray, **half-torn food wrappers** are shoved underneath, their edges curling up slightly, the remnants of snacks visible in the interior folds—perhaps the last bite of a forgotten sandwich or a few empty potato chip crumbs.

As you peer deeper into the trash bin, you spot other, smaller objects: **a crumpled bus ticket** peeking out from underneath a layer of old newspapers, its perforated edges slightly jagged and bent; an **old cigarette butt**, blackened and crumbled at one end, lying among a few stray pieces of broken glass; a **discarded plastic straw** wedged between some napkins, bent in a perfect arc, its soft texture now hardened and creased.

Around the rim of the bin, where people have carelessly thrown their trash in without regard, there are a few scraps that have fallen out—an empty **coffee cup lid**, an **empty chip bag** caught in the wind, its torn edges flapping, and a **used tissue**, crumpled and stained with what appears to be remnants of lipstick or makeup. These little bits of discarded debris have gathered at the edges of the pavement, adding to the untidy, forgotten scene of urban waste.

The **surrounding street** is a mixture of urban grime and quiet suburban charm. The pavement beneath the bin is slightly cracked and uneven, with small patches of moss or grass creeping between the cracks. Some stains, likely from spilled drinks or food, have seeped into the concrete, leaving dark spots that have hardened over time into rough, textured patches of dirt. The asphalt road in the distance gleams slightly, as if freshly wet, with faint tire marks visible in the dust and grime.

A **thin layer of dust** coats the entire scene, a soft patina that has accumulated from the heavy air of city life. The sun, which is just starting to dip lower in the sky, casts long, warm shadows across the street, making the edges of the bin and its contents stand out with dramatic clarity. The light bounces off the metal lid, making it appear almost too bright in contrast to the deep shadows that envelop the base. Tiny specks of dust and particles float in the air, barely visible but detectable if you look closely at the shafts of light streaming in between gaps in the buildings.

A breeze picks up, rustling a nearby **newspaper** that’s caught against the side of the bin. The movement is subtle but gives life to the scene. A **few dried leaves**, blown by the wind, scrape along the sidewalk and settle briefly at the base of the bin before fluttering away again. A **fly** lazily hovers around the rim of the trash can, its wings catching the light with a faint glimmer.

The sounds of the city hum in the background—the distant murmur of passing cars, the occasional honk, and the **subtle squeak** of the bin’s lid as it shifts ever so slightly in the wind. From time to time, a pedestrian walks by, casually glancing at the bin, perhaps without a second thought, while the world continues on around it.

The **tactile feel** of the scene is almost palpable. You can imagine the **slightly cool touch of the metal** as your fingers brush against the edge of the bin’s surface, or the **slight crunching sound** of stepping on a stray piece of crumpled paper. Even the smell of the trash—stale, slightly musty with a hint of damp—hangs in the air, an ever-present reminder of the mundane cycle of urban life.",2,1736171552.0,ratemybin,2,1.0,False

I am new to RV life and thought I got a great deal and on my 2018 MAD Mercedes Class B Sprinter van for LazyDayz, but have been having problems since the purchase in May 2024. The biggest most frustrating problem is that it won’t hold a charge. I had my van on shore power for a week at a campground, do some driving and park for the evening without shore power. The only things that were actively drawing power overnight was the fridge (set only to about 2coldness) and my phone charger (microwave remains unplugged unless in use as well as any other possible parasitic power sucks I can unplug inside the van) when I woke up the next morning and tried to use my coffee maker it kept shutting off and I got the E01 error on my converter before switching back to 11.7v. Before I went to bed it was above 12.4.

I want to be able to boondocks and not have to rely on shore power every day. Google searches aren’t super helpful as there is nothing specific for a class b rv MAD and everything mechanically is so well tucked away and hidden its hard to troubleshoot like they show on bigger rvs. Is there anyone out there that can give me some insight. Mind you this is definitely my midlife crisis era and my first rv of any kind so please use layman’s terms

I’m just totally over it..
I’ve been having acid reflux for two years now, been to the doctor multiple times,
Had myself tested for H.pylori bacteria which I don’t have. Had gastric medicines which helped. Now I’m on omeprazol and I have to take it everyday to manage it.
I don’t want to be medicated for the rest of my life. And I know I need to lose some weight so I’m working on it (I’m 5.4 and weight 145 lbs ) a bit overweight but not much.

Lately I just can’t eat anything anymore.
I’m Italian so I love tomatoes and garlic.
Well always could eat it and since 2 years nothing. I can’t eat, herbal tea’s, banana, garlic, tomato, onion, coffee (which I don’t miss) but okay. 

my GERD comes in waves. I can have no problems all day, and suddenly it begins without any trigger.
As we speak now I had an egg. An egg. And I have disgusting burps where puke arises
I don’t feel any heartburn, just the feeling that there is trapped air in my throat and I need to burp. But when I burp with a lot of pressure I have to watch out to not bring vomit with it..

 I told the doctor this and first he said ‘stomach-flu is on the rise’ and then he said ‘it’s acid reflux’

How come when I don’t have any acidity coming up. It’s just that feeling of a stuck burp, and when burping puke comes with it..

I just don’t know what to do anymore and I wonder if there are more people who can relate to this?
I really could use some tips.. ",1,1736171458.0,GERD,1,1.0,False

1huzd0j,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/1huzd0j/social_media_anorexia_recovery_and_validation/,"social media, anorexia, recovery, and validation","Just warning: this is a long one...

So a few months ago I had a huge realisation that i'd subconsciously blurred the lines between reality and social media.

I'd created this world in my head, out of loneliness I guess, where it felt as if the 'recovery' accounts on tiktok knew me and I knew them. Not only that, but I forgot that my family and friends - the people who I actually know and are actually important - have no idea that these people even exist. Obviously, social media in every case is merely a highlight reel - the people I see online are as good as the strangers I pass in the street.

After realising this, I underwent a huge social media cleanse: unfollowing and blocking anyone and everyone who could be even the slightest bit triggering. As time went on I found myself thinking about them less and less, and found it easier to reconnect with real-life friends and focus on my own life.

This weekend, I unblocked the account I know I find most triggering - I don't know why my brain latched on to this specific person, as there are hundreds of people out there that I could compare myself to, but for some reason this one has just stuck in my brain - to 'check up' on them, in the knowledge that however well/badly they were doing, I was going to feel insanely triggered. 

In only a couple of minutes, those months of mental progress I'd made were undone and now, two days later, I cannot get her out of my head.

Thing is, they actually seem to be doing really well, but I think I'm jealous of their recovery: starting at a really low weight and now eating loads. I am by no means anywhere close to a healthy weight, but I'm also quite a few kg away from my usual IP admission weight, and around my usual discharge weight (says a lot about nhs units literally discharging patients the second they are medically stable - it's completely skewed my view of what is healthy and what is not; in fact, I am below the weight I was at the very first time I was sent to general hospital). It makes me feel like I can't go all-in on recovery yet, because I have less weight to restore (literally a few kgs less weight, so this is a ridiculous line of thinking), so I won't have to eat as much to weight restore. 

Objectively, if I want to appease the ED, I have 'ticked more boxes' than this person: I have been sectioned myriad times, had a higher number of hosp admissions, been ng fed, bed-bound and pushed around in a wheelchair for months. **None of these are me 'bragging'**, these situations have been hell every single time, and they are simply the hoops the ED makes you jump through with the promise of validation that never comes. None of these 'tick boxes' ever made me feel 'sick', 'valid', and I don't feel like I've suffered 'enough' etc. - they are NOT the markers of whether or not you have an ED, are sick, are worthy of recovery etc. So if you find yourself in a place where you're seeking validation through getting to these points, please take it from me that they won't bring you that validation, and that to strive for those things is incredibly dangerous.

I know I will NEVER feel valid, 'sick enough', 'skinny enough' because, as long as I am alive, there is always more I could be doing for the ED - there is never 'enough' you can do for it; the goalposts will always move.

I am trying to remind myself that everyone online only allows you to see what they want you to see. That I don't want this illness any more, I don't want to be, I don't want it following me around for the rest of my life, or taking away any more time from me. The amount of time and opportunities I've missed out on that I can never get back devastates me.

Yet, I feel judged by this person, EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T KNOW I EXIST. Nobody aside from me knows my weight, nobody will ever know my current weight, lowest weight etc. because it's not at all something to brag about or be proud of, it's not something I would ever dream of sharing with anyone else. I don't know this person's weight, nor do I want to, so I have to get it into my head that **my brain will always tell me everyone else is 'sicker' than I am**, that I will never be enough.

I defo have a perfectionistic and black and white view of recovery - that it has to be some big statement and all balls to the wall; that you are either doing everything or you are relapsing, which is not the case. We all know recovery is not linear - and I think that recovery is glamorised online just as much as the illness itself is. I think the whole online ED community is generally very performative and creates an unrealistic portrayal of what recovery is, to be honest. I mean it barely touches on the actual mental recovery (with a couple of exceptions, of course). It can often promote the idea that you have to hit 'rock bottom' or your lowest weight before you can recover, which is not true at all, and that weight restoration = recovery, when weight loss/gain is simply a side effect of the behaviours and obsessions that anorexia is composed of.

I just cannot seem to get it into my head that this person will not judge me because they are unable to - because they don't know I exist. I cannot seem to get it into my head that my friends and family would never think to judge me - when I told them the other day that I want to recover, every single person I told said it was 100% the right decision, and they were incredibly supportive and proud - and they literally would never and can't compare me to this person, or anyone else online, because they don't know they exist. 

I can't seem to focus on myself - what i've been through and knowing it's been more than enough, and that even worrying I'm not 'sick enough' is the biggest red flag that I am very unwell. My life is my life, and my body is my body, and it can only take so much and keep me going for so long regardless of what others do, especially considering how long I've been underweight. 

Idk why I feel so ashamed that my weight restoration began in hospital. The idea that any of my weight restoration has been 'wasted' on hospital food really upsets me, even though in my most recent admission I really pushed myself: I requested meal plan increases on my first day, I chose options I liked, rather than what I thought were the lowest, I even went for snacks out alone and actually ate, rather than getting a black coffee, and chose snacks that I actually wanted e.g. ice cream, pastries, brownies etc., rather than 'safe' foods. I discharged myself and went on holiday alone for the first ever time, and ate and ate and ate everything I wanted - more pastries, pizza for the first time in years, ice cream, crepes - and gained a few kgs completely alone. That holiday is actually what changed my perspective on life itself and made me want to recover for the first time. So technically, I *was* restoring on foods I liked and wanted, rather than my safe foods, I was just in an environment that kept me safe and medically stabilised me.

I'm angry at my past self for not doing it at home, but I know that a year ago, the ED told me that gaining weight alone was disgusting and shameful, which again just goes to show that you can never win. ""I can't gain weight alone bc the ED says that's shameful"" has switched to ""I can't gain weight in hospital bc the ED says that's shameful"". I know my brain is unwell, and so makes it seem like weight restoration is the only time you're allowed to eat all these 'exciting' foods, and then once you're weight restored they're off limits again. I'm aware that is not the case - you can eat these foods every day for the rest of your life if you want to. The sooner I commit to recovery, the more 'exciting' foods I actually get to eat, because more of my life will be spent in recovery and, hopefully, recovered, so none of the foods will be scary or 'off limits' ever again, if that makes sense.

It just goes to show that the standards and the goalposts will always move, and the ED will always tell you you've done something wrong. That the 'perfect' recovery exists, and it will always be something that you're not doing. You can never do right by this illness, so you spend your life chasing validation that doesn't exist. Exhausting and unfulfilling. 

I should add that, as soon as this lapse in judgement happened, I re-blocked the account and actually completely deleted tiktok from my phone because I know even having easy access to the app is dangerous for me. I've deleted instagram from my phone, and only have my DMs page open on my laptop so that I can keep up with real life friends, and hopefully re-focus on my own life and those who matter to me, and keep exposing myself to what healthy bodies and habits look like.

I'm not really sure why I'm posting this - I guess just to vent to people who might understand.

We literally refer to farfetched ideas as ""you're dreamin' kid"". Anything can happen, that's the point. I got the unsettling one last night.

My last week was intensely spiritual and ponderous. Not through groups or readings or meditation, just deep philosophical thought experiments that I like to call ""If, Then"". When I come to a conclusion that I can logically see being correct from multiple points of view, it's like a shackle falls off a limb. My anxiety has simply melted. For the record, I don't meditate. I think, then I go run or golf then get back to work (from home). 

Anyway, yesterday the affirmation came to a tip. I had selfishly asked for a sign a few days ago after what felt like a string of possibly true hypotheses and the shackles coming off. I was buzzing. I didn't ask for proof, but for a sign of a short term path until whatever we're all feeling takes shape. To save some time, I had the most random encounter of my life that led me to finding and talking with my dear friend that I had lost contact with. I had been thinking a lot about my friend last week. Yesterday was their birthday. I took that straight to the soul. After a night of talking and my brain working off the charts I passed out.

When I woke up this morning I was so unsettled, like when you have a bad dream you can't remember. I sit down with my coffee pick up my phone and the dream hits me. It was exactly the same feeling and position. Me with my phone and coffee, brain wandering; then a deep, thundering boom. Not the loudest or lowest octave thing you've ever heard, but the deepest. It carried so much weight and had no reverb. It was not like an explosion, but an impact - though I didn't feel one. Then the emergency tone went off on my electronics for just a few seconds and an all black emergency alert with white letters pops up on the screen. I look straight forward and think ""it's time"". 

Super random. I've never had a dream like that before. I am an avid dreamer, not on purpose. I don't try to make it happen or manipulate what outcomes or circumstances, it just feels good to turn off my body and let go. I've been to some wild places, though lol. This one sticks out because it's just not the ""genre"" I dream in. I get plenty of daily life, my dreams take me elsewhere. I do have hyper realistic dreams occasionally, though rare. 

There you have it, I'm a hypocrite. Apologies to all of the dream posts that I've immediately sighed and scrolled past.

We also live a state away from each other. We didn’t know each other much in school, so as we started talking, we found we had a good amount in common. When I was in town recently for family, he asked to go on a date, and I agreed. The date was good, and we decided to continue seeing if a long term relationship is something we wanted to pursue.

During the date, I was up front that I needed this to move at a slower pace since I was coming out of a previous situation from a couple months back, and I tend to rush into things too quickly. I even clarified that it was something my therapist and I were working on together. He said he understood and that was completely okay with him. Thus, I returned home feeling good and that we were on the same page.

However, then it started to seem as if we weren’t on the same page. Despite texting everyday, he was asking if we could start spontaneously calling each other. He also mentioned wanting to join me for any concerts I was planning for the future, saying maybe he’d be able to spend NYE of 2025 (so a year away) with me, mentioning he could come up for 5 days to visit and we could spend our time together when we aren’t at work, etc. He would even make comments about how I have an “intoxicating aura” or how he was worried our in-person date would be the last time we saw each other in-person. Additionally, our texts would be multiple paragraphs and take 30 minutes to respond to, which was okay, except he would get anxious and send follow up texts if I hadn’t responded in a couple of hours.

I kept prefacing that I wanted to take this slow but that my goal for this entire process was to see if we would be a good match to do a long term relationship since we hardly knew each other. We’d only been in contact for 3 weeks. I’d also make sure he was okay with the pacing whenever the topic would be brought up to make sure I was considering how he was feeling about all this. 

A week after our first date, we had another date but did it virtually since we didn’t live near each other. It went well. We talked about goals we had set for ourselves for the new year, watch a tv show, and just talked. I decided to bring up a concern I had about how he mentioned he wanted to call a lot during the week on top of virtual dates on the weekend and how he seemed anxious about the pacing. He denied asking for a lot of calls and said that the texts were being misconstrued. So I asked him to explain his side and asked to make sure he was still okay with the pace this was moving. He said we were on the same page and we even set up another virtual date for the next weekend.

The next day, after he texted me about other things, he asked if I knew my do not disturb was on, even though I’d already told him once that I have do not disturb on for everyone except family. This was weird to my friends and I since I was out with them at a coffee shop. He said he was asking since people accidentally turn that on and he wanted to let me know it was on. 

I made it known to him that I thought that statement was weird and an uncalled for thing to say. That it could come across as controlling vibes. He then proceeded to say how he feels like I’m saying he comes off too strong and that it seems like “a personal issue” rather than “anything to do with” him (quotes from the text). He then went on to say that he was frustrated that I was calling him strange and uncalled for and controlling. I proceeded to say that I used those words to describe the situation and that I was not using the words to describe him and apologized with how blunt the statement was, that it was not my intent to hurt him, mentioned I could’ve done better with my wording, and told him again that I was sorry. 

We ended up on a phone call where I started the call apologizing about the text again before saying that I was not okay with him saying all of the issues about pacing and him coming off wrong was a me issue, especially since the night before we talked about it and he said we were still on the same page. He proceeded to say I wasn’t taking responsibility for my text and that he wants to end this. I said okay. Then he ended the call with “talk to you later”

In a quiet corner of a snow-blanketed town, hidden beneath twinkling lights and festive wreaths, stood a humble brick building with a hand-carved wooden sign that read ""The Foundry of Fathers."" The name intrigued many, but only fathers—new, seasoned, or even those whose children had long since flown the nest—knew what the place truly was.

The Foundry opened only in December, its doors creaking wide on the first snowfall and staying ajar until Christmas Eve. Inside, the air was filled with the rich aroma of mulled cider, the warmth of a crackling fireplace, and the comforting hum of conversation. Fathers from all walks of life gathered there, united by a shared understanding of the joys and challenges of parenthood.

On a particularly snowy evening just days before Christmas, a young father named Daniel stepped hesitantly through the Foundry's doors for the first time. He cradled a steaming cup of coffee he’d bought from the café next door, his face weary from sleepless nights with his newborn daughter.

""First time?"" asked an older man seated near the fireplace. His name was Martin, and his silver beard gave him the air of a kindly old saint.

Daniel nodded. ""Yeah, I heard about this place from a friend. Said it was... special.""

Martin smiled knowingly. ""Special doesn’t even begin to cover it. Take a seat.""

Daniel joined Martin and a few others in mismatched armchairs arranged in a circle. The group included fathers of all ages: a teenager who nervously clutched his phone, a man in his 40s with paint-speckled hands, and another whose suit suggested he’d come straight from work.

""Everyone here knows what it's like,"" Martin said, his voice gentle. ""The good, the bad, and the downright exhausting. We come here to share stories, advice, or just to listen. It’s like… Christmas magic.""

Daniel chuckled. ""Christmas magic? I could use some of that.""

The teenager, Evan, glanced up from his phone. ""It’s my first Christmas as a dad, too,"" he said, his voice barely above a whisper. ""I’m scared I’ll mess it up.""

""You will,"" said the paint-speckled man with a grin. ""We all do. But kids don’t remember the mistakes. They remember the love.""

The circle hummed in agreement. Martin reached over to the hearth and picked up a small wooden figurine—one of dozens on the mantel. It was carved in the shape of a father holding a child.

""Every dad who visits leaves something here,"" he explained, handing the figure to Daniel. ""A memory, a lesson, a bit of themselves. It's a reminder that none of us are alone.""

Daniel examined the figurine, the rough-hewn wood warm in his hand. ""What do you mean, 'leaves something'?""

Martin gestured around the room. ""A story, a word of advice, even just a promise to be present. It’s not about perfection; it’s about showing up.""

Encouraged, Daniel shared his struggles—the sleepless nights, the overwhelming pressure to be the perfect father, and the fear that he was failing. The group listened without judgment, offering nods, laughter, and words of encouragement.

By the time Daniel left the Foundry that night, he felt lighter. He placed a small token—a button from his daughter's first Christmas outfit—on the mantel beside the other keepsakes. It wasn’t much, but it carried all the love he had for her.

Outside, the snow fell softly, muffling the sounds of the bustling town. Daniel paused, looking back at the glowing windows of the Foundry. For the first time in weeks, he felt ready to face the challenges of fatherhood, bolstered by the knowledge that he wasn’t alone.

The Foundry of Fathers remained a beacon for those who entered its doors, a place where laughter, tears, and wisdom were shared freely. And as Christmas drew closer, the fathers who gathered there carried its spirit home, spreading warmth and love to their families.

For in the Foundry, they had found not only friendship but the courage to be the fathers their children needed most.",1,1736170798.0,FoundryofFathers,0,1.0,False
1huz7go,https://www.reddit.com/r/HighStrangeness/comments/1huz7go/it_happened_in_my_dream_last_night_for_the_first/,It happened in my dream last night for the first time,"I generally hate dream posts. We literally refer to farfetched ideas as ""you're dreamin' kid"". Anything can happen, that's the point. I got the unsettling one last night.

My last week was intensely spiritual and ponderous. Not through groups or readings or meditation, just deep philosophical thought experiments that I like to call ""If, Then"". When I come to a conclusion that I can logically see being correct from multiple points of view, it's like a shackle falls off a limb. My anxiety has simply melted. For the record, I don't meditate. I think, then I go run or golf then get back to work (from home). 

Anyway, yesterday the affirmation came to a tip. I had selfishly asked for a sign a few days ago after what felt like a string of possibly true hypotheses and the shackles coming off. I was buzzing. I didn't ask for proof, but for a sign of a short term path until whatever we're all feeling takes shape. To save some time, I had the most random encounter of my life that led me to finding and talking with my dear friend that I had lost contact with. I had been thinking a lot about my friend last week. Yesterday was their birthday. I took that straight to the soul. After a night of talking and my brain working off the charts I passed out.

When I woke up this morning I was so unsettled, like when you have a bad dream you can't remember. I sit down with my coffee pick up my phone and the dream hits me. It was exactly the same feeling and position. Me with my phone and coffee, brain wandering; then a deep, thundering boom. Not the loudest or lowest octave thing you've ever heard, but the deepest. It carried so much weight and had no reverb. It was not like an explosion, but an impact - though I didn't feel one. Then the emergency tone went off on my electronics for just a few seconds and an all black emergency alert with white letters pops up on the screen. I look straight forward and think ""it's time"". 

Super random. I've never had a dream like that before. I am an avid dreamer, not on purpose. I don't try to make it happen or manipulate what outcomes or circumstances, it just feels good to turn off my body and let go. I've been to some wild places, though lol. This one sticks out because it's just not the ""genre"" I dream in. I get plenty of daily life, my dreams take me elsewhere. I do have hyper realistic dreams occasionally, though rare. 

There you have it, I'm a hypocrite. Sorry for all the dream posts that I've read and immediately dismissed.

1huz5pd,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergirls/comments/1huz5pd/has_anyone_else_lived_abroad_and_had_more_issues/,Has anyone else lived abroad and had more issues in their home country?,"This has been discussed before, but as I’m feeling nostalgic for life overseas I’d like to reflect on positive or neutral situations abroad. And contrast this with bizarre neurotypical negativity in my home country.

I was last in Vietnam, for about 6 months, and prior to this I stayed in Vietnam about three times in one month durations in the 2010s. Here’s what I found as an individual on the spectrum, primarily in Hanoi:

1. Work-life balance and affordability: Prior to COVID I taught at an English center in Vietnam, and sometimes opted for 16 hour weeks (and prep which I did at home). The kids, for the most part, enjoyed class and stayed engaged. The manager seemed fine with my work performance, and for the most part left me alone, and let teachers create their own lessons— lots of creative control. When I returned to the US, I worked several jobs and burned out…some require lots of (bullshit) teamwork, and in others I had bosses micromanaging me. In some cases, my progress was substantially slowed as co-workers made small talk while I tried to work (I can’t multitask effectively).

2. The affordable room rentals in Vietnam made life do-able. I worked, sometimes, part-time hours teaching, and had plenty of time to decompress and explore. Switch to the US…80% of my paycheck goes to rent, I’m on food stamps, and I took out a loan at one point to cover electricity and other expenses. 

3. In Vietnam, many situations come down to blatant business …. buying food from a vendor and haggling, hailing down a motorbike and negotiating a price… some westerners find this a nuisance and very bottom line…I found, that there’s less social pressure when you’re yelling over motorbikes and rapidly traversing across the city on the back of a motorbike…too loud to really have a meaningful conversation, and the workers are more interested in getting paid then wasting time on social niceties. Back in the US, the cashiers will make small talk, and it just seems so phony. No doubt some are genuine, but the forced customer service in the US is annoying. And let’s be real—there is still so much stigma around neurodivergence. As we all know it’s not fun listening to “what’s wrong or strange” with people when they’re simply a different brain type. As I have yet to master the Vietnamese language, my ignorance is bliss … and I don’t have listen to these conversations overseas as I don’t comprehend them anyway.

4. I tend to be a fairly quiet person, but I’m not fond of long silences in a social situation. Many Americans have commented on my quiet nature. In Vietnam, many people just think I’m Russian. Anyhow, I just feel pressured to fill the gap in long silences. In Vietnam, on the other hand, those Vietnamese who are bilingual or speak a fairly decent amount of English often have something meaningful and intriguing to say to fill the gap. I sometimes went to lunch with a Vietnamese co-worker and she’d teach me about certain foods and cultural items. She described her times abroad. It was an immediate shared experience. I also practiced some Vietnamese with neighbors and there was a clear and simple goal (to use the language, and describe where I’m from and what I do and decipher their response). In my native language, I find that there’s so much subtext and nuance going on, even when people make basic greetings—it’s exhausting to perform, whereas abroad, it’s just assumed (if you look glaringly foreign) that you’re clueless and simply foreign… I have zero in common with the folks in my apartment back in the US and after I’ve heard several of their conversations I prefer to keep to myself—so it’s lonelier here, even as an introvert. I prefer to be “the simple foreigner” butchering the Vietnamese language, as opposed to the “weird chic who brings up irrelevant topics or hides away.” I just feel more stigma in the US.

5. Both societies are very status driven, but in Vietnam (in the major cities) you can live a middle class life as a teacher…this is becoming nearly impossible in NYC, Seattle, SF, LA, etc. 

6. Many Vietnamese students have pursued the liberal arts and gone onto careers in teaching, translation, and bilingual jobs in companies. Hanoi is full of book worms and there’s an appreciation for culture, arts, history.   In the US, there’s this pervasive attack on the intellectual (Fran Lebowitz describes this in one of her many humorous talks). It seems parents are pushing their kids into “money oriented” fields which if you love the field, fine, but as result we’re getting these rich-and-dull suburban-like cities where the bohemians have been priced out. Meanwhile, in Hanoi, there’s always something going on outside—artists, musicians and dancers at Hoan Kiem lake. It feels way more hipster then some of the west coast cities here which are going through some bland phase.

7. Cafe culture is big in Hanoi. People will lounge for hours. I enjoyed my two (very affordable) coffees every other afternoon, and I would just journal and stare out onto the lake and enjoy the street theatre. Cut back to the US, …many coffee shops in my current city don’t have tables and chairs (as a way to deter the homeless) and it just kind of kills the mood, when you’re basically hurried out of a shop after spending $6 on a drink. 

There are many more great aspects of Vietnam, and other countries, but for now I’m just nostalgic. I think I’ll go back.",1,1736170633.0,aspergirls,0,1.0,False

I'm looking to build, from the ground up, a loving, caring, trusting monogamous relationship. A bond that acts as a sort of guiding light in our lives. I want to really get to know you. I like texting, talking on the phone and meeting in person for boba, activities, coffee or dinner. I want to feel like I can tell you anything and that I know you will have my back because you know my character. I want you to feel that undying trust with me as well. My love language is communicating, caring, physical touch and spending quality time.

Who I'm looking for:

A young, professional lady who takes good care of herself and has a good head on her shoulders. Someone who works out regularly like me is not necessary but is definitely a plus if you are in shape. I want to find a lady who values trust, communication and monogamy. Intelligent women are a huge turn on for me.

Let’s talk about **independent artists.** You know, the ones out there hustling every day, putting their hearts (and probably all their coffee money) into music for the love of it, not just the fame or fancy record deal. There’s something so raw, so unapologetic about indie musicians, right? But man, the road they walk isn’t easy.  

- **No safety nets, just passion.** They don’t have a label pouring millions of dollars into promotion campaigns. Nope. Many of them are their own marketers, managers, booking agents, and sometimes even their own roadies. Imagine being your own biggest cheerleader while working a day job or balancing college life.

- **Creative freedom = creative problems?** Indie artists can pretty much create whatever they want, however they want, and that’s what makes their work feel so genuine. But let’s face it, not every late-night inspiration session turns out to be a masterpiece, and there's no big label team to ""polish"" it up. It’s a fine balance between raw expression and keeping it listenable.

- **Social media savants (out of necessity).** If you're an independent artist in 2023, you're pretty much obligated to be a TikToker or Instagram guru, right? Post the music… promote the music… make memes about the music (and silently pray the algorithm will smile on you for five seconds). It’s fun but exhausting! How many dance trends does one tiny snippet of a song need to catch on anyway?

What really sets indie artists apart, though, is their connection to their fans. They’re still responding to DMs, leaving personal comments, and showing up at your local dive bars or coffee shops because it’s not *all* about numbers for them (Okay, yeah it is a *little* about numbers if they’re paying rent with Spotify streams, but you know what I mean).  

So if you're a fan of an independent artist, here’s a thoughtful challenge for you:  

- Add their songs to your playlists. Share them in your IG stories or send a “You NEED to hear this!” message to your BFF. Tiny actions like this can help them reach new people.  

- Merch? If you LOVE their stuff, pick up a shirt, vinyl, sticker – whatever. Every sale fuels them a little longer and inches them closer to building something truly sustainable.

- And most importantly, **show up** for them. To gigs. To livestreams. To those wobbly “acoustic covers” they nervously post on TikTok at 1 a.m. Your support is their lifeline more than you know.  

But let’s flip the mic: Are you an indie artist? Drop a comment, share your journey – the highs, the struggles, the unexpected moments. How do you stay hyped when the algorithm gods are not in your favor? How do you balance the creative chaos and the business grind?  

This community wouldn’t *be* what it is without you. Independent artists are redefining the rules of the game right now – no contracts required. Keep pushing. Keep creating. The world's a better place because of what you’re putting out there. 🌟 💪

## Breville Barista Express Espresso Machine: A Deep Dive Review

The Breville Barista Express has become a popular choice among home baristas seeking a step up from basic espresso machines.  Its all-in-one design, boasting a built-in grinder and magnetic tamper, promises a convenient and relatively easy path to crafting cafe-quality espresso at home. But is it truly worth the investment?  This comprehensive review will explore the Breville Barista Express's strengths and weaknesses, addressing common user concerns and comparing it to similar models in the sub-$1000 espresso machine market.

### Product Overview: Design and Key Features

The Barista Express showcases a sleek, stainless steel design, lending it a premium feel that justifies its price point.  Key features include:

* **Integrated Conical Burr Grinder:**  A crucial component, the conical burr grinder allows for adjustable grind size, a critical factor in achieving optimal espresso extraction.  However, as we'll discuss later, it's not without its shortcomings.
* **54mm Portafilter with Magnetic Tamper:**  The magnetic tamper ensures consistent tamping pressure, a key element for even extraction and minimizing channeling. This feature significantly simplifies the espresso-making process, especially for beginners.
* **Thermocoil Heating System:** This system boasts rapid heating, typically reaching operational temperature in under 30 seconds.  This significantly reduces wait times compared to traditional boiler systems.
* **15-bar Pump:**  This high-pressure pump is designed to deliver the pressure needed for proper espresso extraction.  However, as with many high-pressure systems, it can contribute to channeling issues if not used correctly.
* **Steam Wand and Hot Water Tap:** The included steam wand allows for milk frothing, enabling the creation of lattes, cappuccinos, and other milk-based beverages. The hot water tap is convenient for making Americano or simply hot water.


### Breville Barista Express: Pros and Cons – A Balanced Perspective

While the Barista Express offers many appealing features, it's essential to acknowledge both its strengths and weaknesses to make an informed purchasing decision.

**Pros:**

* **Ease of Use:** The machine's intuitive interface and integrated features make it surprisingly user-friendly, even for beginners. The magnetic tamper and clear instructions significantly reduce the learning curve.
* **Consistent Espresso Extraction (with proper technique):** With the right grind size and tamping technique, the Barista Express delivers consistently excellent espresso shots with a rich crema.  The integrated grinder and tamper contribute significantly to this consistency.
* **Rapid Heating:** The thermocoil heating system allows for quick start-up times, minimizing waiting periods between shots.
* **All-in-One Convenience:** The integrated grinder eliminates the need for a separate grinder, streamlining the espresso-making process.
* **Durable Build Quality:** The stainless steel construction suggests a machine built to last, although regular maintenance is still crucial.

**Cons:**

* **Messy Grinder:**  A common complaint is the messiness of the integrated grinder. Coffee grounds often spill, requiring regular cleaning.
* **Channeling Issues:** The 15-bar pump, while powerful, can lead to channeling if the coffee grounds aren't evenly distributed and tamped.  This results in uneven extraction and a less-than-ideal espresso.
* **Less Powerful Steam Wand:** Compared to dedicated milk frothing machines, the steam wand's power is relatively lower, requiring more time and practice to achieve the desired microfoam texture.
* **Automatic Cleaning Cycle Issues:**  Some users report inconsistencies with the automatic cleaning cycle, necessitating manual flushing.  We'll address this further in the maintenance section.
* **Price Point:** While competitive within its class, the Breville Barista Express is still a significant investment for a home espresso machine.


### Performance and Comparison with Competitors

The Breville Barista Express competes directly with other popular home espresso machines such as the Gaggia Classic Pro and the De'Longhi Dedica Style.  While the Gaggia Classic Pro offers more manual control and is generally considered more robust, it lacks the integrated grinder. The De'Longhi Dedica Style is more compact and affordable but sacrifices some features and build quality.  The Barista Express sits comfortably in the middle, offering a balance of convenience, features, and performance.


### Maintenance and Cleaning: Addressing Common Pain Points

Proper maintenance is crucial for the longevity and performance of any espresso machine.  The Breville Barista Express requires regular cleaning and descaling to prevent mineral buildup and ensure consistent performance.

**Addressing Cleaning Cycle Issues:**

Many users report problems with the automatic cleaning cycle. If this happens,  try this troubleshooting step: with the machine on, press the double shot, single shot, and power buttons sequentially (relatively quickly) from right to left. If the cleaning light begins flashing, the cycle should initiate, even if water doesn't immediately flow. If this doesn't work, a thorough manual flush is necessary.  This involves running several cycles of water through the machine—potentially up to 45 minutes to fully flush a tank—to clear any blockages.

**Descaling:**  Regular descaling, using Breville's recommended descaling solution, is essential to prevent mineral buildup and maintain optimal performance.  Follow the manufacturer’s instructions carefully.

**Grinder Cleaning:**  The integrated grinder requires regular cleaning to prevent coffee grounds from accumulating and affecting the grind consistency.  Use the provided cleaning brush frequently.


### Mastering the Steam Wand: Tips for Milk Frothing

The steam wand, while less powerful than some competitors, is still capable of producing excellent milk froth with practice.  Key tips for success include:

* **Purging the Wand:**  Purge the wand before frothing to remove any residual water.
* **Proper Technique:**  Use the correct technique, such as aerating the milk initially then creating microfoam by swirling the milk.
* **Milk Temperature:**  Monitor the milk temperature to prevent scorching.  Practice makes perfect!


### Temperature Control and Grind Adjustment: Fine-tuning Your Espresso

The Breville Barista Express offers some level of temperature control, although it's not as extensive as some higher-end models.  Experimentation with grind size is crucial for achieving the perfect extraction.  Start with the manufacturer’s recommendations, then adjust the grind finer or coarser depending on your results.


### Conclusion: Is the Breville Barista Express Worth the Hype?

The Breville Barista Express offers a compelling blend of convenience, performance, and features for the home barista.  While it has its drawbacks, such as the messy grinder and less powerful steam wand, its ease of use, rapid heating, and consistent espresso extraction (with proper technique) make it a strong contender in its price range.  The machine's ease of use makes it ideal for beginners, while its adjustable settings allow for more experienced users to fine-tune their espresso to perfection.  Ultimately, whether it's """"worth the hype"""" depends on your individual needs and expectations.  However, for those seeking a relatively user-friendly all-in-one solution for crafting delicious espresso at home, the Breville Barista Express is a worthy consideration.


### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: How often should I descale my Breville Barista Express?**

A:  The frequency of descaling depends on your water hardness.  Breville recommends descaling every 3 months or as needed.  Monitor your machine and descale when you notice a decrease in performance or a change in water pressure.

**Q: What type of milk is best for frothing?**

A:  Whole milk generally produces the best microfoam due to its higher fat content.  However, you can also froth other types of milk, although the results may vary.

**Q:  Can I use pre-ground coffee with the Breville Barista Express?**

A: While technically possible, using pre-ground coffee defeats the purpose of the integrated grinder and may result in less-than-optimal espresso extraction.  It's highly recommended to use freshly ground beans for the best results.

**Q: What should I do if my espresso is sour?**

A: Sour espresso often indicates that the grind is too fine.  Try adjusting the grind coarser and see if that improves the taste.

**Q: What should I do if my espresso is bitter?**

A: Bitter espresso usually signifies that the grind is too coarse or the extraction time is too long.  Try adjusting the grind finer or reducing the extraction time.

1huysvw,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/1huysvw/delusional_family_members/,Delusional family members,"Okay so it all began with talking about those 3 in 1 coffees, currently my family is on a religious fast and my brother wanted coffee but remembered that the 3 in 1 coffees contain milk, well powdered milk to be specific. I said that they might be ok because i heard its soy milk, but on the packaging there is no word about it, also there is milk protein which idk if its vegan or not. I mean idc because I don't drink it anyway.

After that convo was over he said ""you know that milking the cow helps the cow"" and i said ""no it doesn't"". He said that if u leave cows on their own they would die because of too much milk, and that milking them would extend their life. I said that he surely knows that the cows today were basically bred to produce more milk, im not sure they can die of too much milk but like if they can, thats a problem we created. And then i said ""you know if you wanted to stop that fate, u could just not impregnate the cow"". Guys my brother and mom didn't believe cows had to get pregnate to produce milk. Like why would a cow just produce milk for no reason.  And I love how he mentioned farms, like we buy milk from a farmer on some farm, no its all factory produced. He said it doesn't make sense because then cows would have milk only a couple of days per year. 

Anyway I felt crazy and like I was losing my mind. And guess what my brother went to wikipedia and realized I'm right and he said that the cows have milk for roughly 8 months after birth and after that the calf leaves its mother (which i think its not correct but okay) and I said that usually the calf gets removed in a couple of days to which he said ""okay i mean they are just livestock"". 

The saddest part is no one said anything about me being right and they just moved on.",4,1736169559.0,vegan,0,0.75,False

Me F29 have a crush/fwb with mi next door neighbor M29, I lived in this building and we were hooking up, 3 weeks ago he tells me the apartment next door is available so now  we live side to side. Since then we slept together 4 times (even christmas and NYE) and spent some time having coffee, cleaning and last time cooking and dining. He gave me and HBO account and I shared my Netflix. I even made him a dessert and then he asked for another one and told me it was so good he shared with his mom and dad on new years and they liked it. He told me his friends already know about me and I hear when someone enters his apartment so I know her didn't take anyone home.

BUT he told me in the beginning he didn't want to get in a relationship, that he is recently single and only did casual hook ups and was a mistake to let me sleep in. Last week he asked if I'm having sex with someone else and told me I should do it so I don't fall in love with him (TOO LATE I'M A FOOL SINCE DAY 1) when I asked if he does he said he is not but it doesn't matter bc he won't fall and he laughed (he said the nigh before very drunk he was only seeing me)

He asked me if my friends and therapist know about him, then asked if my therapist advised against him (She isn't). He said I need to tell him if I'm falling in love so we stop, but then hugged me and told me he didn't want to stop talking or being friends. I asked if he would fall and he laughed and said he's focused on money and not love and I told him that sounds like he is still bitter about his ex.

Next day he was at my apartment again and told me that hurt to hear, that he wants both love and money but you can't chase love it just happens. Then proceeded to tell me his ex situatuinship sent some gifts and he throw them in the trash. His last situationship ditched him for other men since he wasn't making her official since he wanted to enjoy meeting people after his 6 year relationship.

Now we areee both back yo work and haven't hear from him since the weekend, mi birthday is in 3 days and don't know if I should invite him, is he fooling me?",2,1736169547.0,dating_advice,8,1.0,False

1huynxg,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1huynxg/can_we_still_be_friends_balancing_returning_her/,Can we still be friends? Balancing returning her sentimental items and moving on.,"So, I (29M) met this girl (25F) about 3 ½ months ago – we hit it off and hooked up. I didn’t think much of it at the time, but I felt a deep connection with her, and she asked me to exchange phone numbers. What was weird is that she trauma-dumped on me during the night we hooked up, telling me how her mom passed away when she was a kid.

The first few times we hung out, she seemed really into me, but she was flaky and always late. She would constantly lie about small things that I didn’t even care about. I called her out on it, and she stopped – except for the lying part. She told me how she didn’t want anything serious, how she hadn’t been in a relationship for six years, and how she only hooks up, etc. So, we agreed on a FWB-type scenario where I emphasized the friendship part. However, after one time, she started distancing herself – never initiating contact but always agreeing to hang out.

 

We started hanging out regularly—at least once a week—for several hours (sometimes 7-8 hours), but it was usually at a bar. Over time, I felt like we were growing closer, and there was a clear sense of romantic tension. She began opening up more; however, by the end of our meetups, she would always reiterate that she didn’t want anything serious. At times, she could be blunt or critical, making comments about me being boring, even though she consistently chose to spend so much time with me. She also insisted on tagging along with my friends when I had other plans, which made things awkward.

Fast forward a bit, and our hangouts turned into 2-3 times a week – after which she would always distance herself even more. She was doing this dance where she would literally invite me to her place, start getting close to me, like putting her legs over me or sitting extremely close to me, and then pull away panicking like she didn’t know what to do. She would make comments like, “We should have a scientific experiment where you blindfold me and we get physical,” but when I got close, she would pull away. This lasted for some time. I suggested that we should start dating – she wouldn’t say no but rather  invite me to her place. At that time, she started lending me some books.

She got sick, so we hadn’t seen each other for a few weeks – but when we met in person, we continued where we left off. We decided to go out drinking one night with my friends. I offered to pick her up, and she accepted but made a big deal out of it because “we are arriving together.” She invited us to her place after that, where she was extremely affectionate, sitting in my lap in front of my friends, touching my legs, etc. She suggested we send them home and that I stay over – so we called them a cab, but immediately after they left, she started pulling back again, saying she didn’t feel like having sex. I told her that I didn’t understand what was going on. We hung out for half an hour more, and I told her I was going to bed. We cuddled and held hands for hours in bed – just chatting, and then she hit me with, “This is wrong, but hand-holding made me horny. Let’s get physical, but if we do, we aren’t allowed to see each other ever again.” I told her no, and she said, “No kissing then,” which I also refused – and then we had the most passionate kiss ever. I left in the morning, and she lent me another book (I had asked about it a long time ago but didn’t even remember anymore – she just gave it to me). It was a personal book, which was her mom’s gift to a friend who later gave it to her. However, there was a lot of stuff underlined in the book, so I asked her who had underlined it – after which she pulled away again.

 

After that, she was extremely distant. She avoided meeting up for three weeks. We finally met up with a friend of mine, and she told me she had been avoiding me because she got into a relationship two weeks ago and it wouldn’t be fair if she were still hanging out with me (but she had no problem sleeping with a married guy before that, and she would even defend him, saying how considerate he was because he didn’t want to divorce because of the kids). I told her I would still like to continue hanging out and that I would respect her choices because, honestly, I really do care about her and wouldn’t want to cut her out of my life. She mentioned multiple times that we wouldn’t hang out one-on-one ever again. After the bar closed, I told her to come to my place so I could give her stuff back (which she had mentioned multiple times how sentimental it was). I was already in the car, and she called me, telling me to come to another bar. She then proceeded to attack me – saying she would never date me, that she was only hanging out with me because she didn’t have anyone else to hang out with, that she only accepted my invitations to hang out because she didn’t want to be rude, and tried gaslighting me that stuff that happened never happened. In all of that, she said something along the lines of, “You haven’t even experienced anything in your life” – which I took to mean I hadn’t traveled a lot or similar. I sarcastically answered, “No, you did,” and then she started crying and told me again how young her mom was when she died. I tried explaining that I didn’t understand her comment in that context. I asked her if she wanted to talk about what happened as well. I have some stuff that I’ve been through (not as heavy, obviously), so I opened up as well, and at that point, we were both crying. She told me she was sorry she ever met me, that she just lost all respect for me, and then blocked me on socials in front of me. She told me she was going to the bathroom, then messaged me a few minutes later saying she had to leave because she was not in the mood to talk anymore and that we would see each other next time. She didn’t even send me a happy new year text (she didn’t block my phone number).

Now – I know this is quite a story; however, I really do care about her and would like to stay in her life as a friend. I have no idea why. I have no idea how to proceed with this. At the very least, I would like to return the stuff she lent me, as she mentioned multiple times how important it is to her. I was thinking of sending her a message asking if she wants to pick her stuff up, if I should mail it to her, or if I should bring it next time when we see each other (if ever). This is hard for me because I feel like I lost the last bit of self-respect I had, especially after she told me she was only hanging out with me because she didn’t have anyone else to hang out with (which seems contradictory – multiple times she left coffee with her friends to hang out with me – unless she was lying). But I don’t want to feel like I’m hurting someone by not returning their sentimental belongings.



**TL;DR**: I (29M) met a girl (25F) 3.5 months ago and developed a complicated FWB relationship. She often sent mixed signals—being affectionate, spending hours with me, and lending me sentimental items—only to pull away, act rude, and remind me she didn’t want anything serious. Recently, she revealed she started dating someone else, avoided me for weeks, and told me she only hung out with me out of politeness. During an argument, she claimed I hadn’t “been through anything in life.” I misunderstood and responded sarcastically, which made her cry and bring up her mom’s death. We both got emotional, and she ultimately blocked me on socials but not on my phone.

I still care about her and want to stay friends, though I don’t know why. At the very least, I want to return the sentimental items she lent me (she’s mentioned how important they are). I was thinking of messaging her to ask if she wants to pick them up, mail them, or wait until we (potentially) see each other again?",1,1736169119.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1huyn8f,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/1huyn8f/my_husband_sprinkles_dirt_on_my_face_when_i_sleep/,My husband sprinkles dirt on my face when I sleep,"Its 3am and I started scratching my face mid-dream. The second time I scratched my face all over and I woke up to feeling something sprinkled on my face. This has happened before but this time I realize it’s dirt and it’s coming from my husband who is suppose to be sleeping next to me. I jump up, wipe my face off and look over at him but for a few seconds he pretends to be sleeping. He then says to me, “What’s wrong? You know sometimes I get anxiety too when I think something is happening and it’s not.” I think to myself that is such a strange thing to say for someone who has supposedly just woken up. I ignore him because I know what’s going on now and I’m trying to avoid a fight I know is coming. I grab my pillow and flip over to the bottom of the bed and cover my face with my knitted robe to fall back asleep. He starts yelling about how I’m ignoring him and begins a fight with himself spewing horrific comments at me trying to invoke a reaction. I respond quietly asking him to stop as it is the middle of night and I’m trying to sleep. He proceeds to yell and breaks up with me, cheerfully grabs himself a pillow and blanket then heads to the living room. 

He has been doing things like this and sabotaging my life every time I start doing good for myself. I have been making sure to eat healthy, be more active and happier overall lately. I have been able to keep up with it for a few weeks now and my skin is clearing up, we also haven’t fought since Christmas but it makes me wonder how long he has been doing this because I have felt sprinkles on my face before and seen black dirt all over my face when I wake up. I even just looked over on his side of the bed and within the bed frame I can see where he pinched to pick up the dust and dirt. I am barely now realizing how much of an evil person he truly is and all of his ‘mistakes’ were not mistakes. Purposely waking me up every hour of the night when I tell him how tired I am or ruining all my jeans with oil stains on my back pocket making it looked like I pooped myself for a whole 2 weeks or ‘accidentally’ splashing coffee and Pom juice over and in every cabinet in the kitchen within 10 minutes right after I deep cleaned the kitchen then laughing and asking if he gave me anxiety. There are countless incidents were I know he fucked with me and it led to a negative affect in my life like giving me a concussion after I landed a new dream job then I lost it or fighting with me to the point I’m sobbing right before the 3 interviews I had afterwards within the month. 

We have been together for 15 years and I have looked past a lot because we have kids and I’d give him the benefit of the doubt. I not only found out he cheated for 10 years 3 years ago while I have been pregnant with our 2 boys and depressed for 7 years from his mental abuse and gaslighting but also realizing he has been sabotaging me at this level has fucked me up. I’m trying to recover on my own from what I believe is ptsd from childhood traumas and this relationship. Yes it has been physical, financial, emotional and mental abuse for 15 years and I am slowly realizing what really has been going on. He has turned everyone against me and no one knows what kind of a person he is and how he treats me behind closed doors. I have a few recordings of him admitting to hurting me physically and cheating because he has always denied any wrongdoing and tells everyone I’m crazy so they feel bad for him. My mom heard him over the phone speaking to me once without him realizing it and she was shocked. I want to get a hidden camera to see what he does when I’m not looking because I swear he puts shit in my food. I would love to catch this kind of evil on camera so I have proof simply because I have mentioned this craziness and no one believes me. He even told me he will turn our son against me. 

I would leave if I wasn’t dependent on him, I am honestly I am terrified to be alone. I know my mother was a homeless drug addict so I was taken from her at 4 years old. I was abandoned and neglected as a child growing up with a father who molested me and an evil stepmother along with siblings who always lied about everything and bullied me. My mother and brother came to have a sexual relationship as they both lived traumatic lives so I understand why people do bad things. I know with me there is an inability to understand humanity and what love was even my teenage years were hard especially not having any friends. I never learned how to socialize properly and never understood what a friend should be and I was bullied through out high school by literally everyone. Met my husband junior year and had our 1st baby after he forced me into homeschooling my senior year so he could cheat more freely. Been with him for 15 years now and I’ve been isolated from society and abused in every way.

I don’t know normal. I’m constantly trying to improve my life but it’s so hard while simultaneously fighting so many different battles. I have only ever seen normal life from a spectators view and never lived through it. No one understands these struggles and no one really cares. I can’t even have a normal interaction at the store and my relationship with everyone in my life is strained as every single person has betrayed me in someway or is toxic for a healthy lifestyle. I know the difference between good and bad and I have always been bullied for speaking truth or being too positive or socially awkward or rude because I don’t make eye contact or say the right things or I am blunt or I realized recently I appear arrogant but truly I just don’t understand human nature and can’t process or regulate all these different hidden languages. I have heard from multiple people I have ptsd or Asperger’s but I haven’t been diagnosed because I am scared it will affect my child custody as my husband has threatened to take them away before. 

(And now he is loudly masturbating. Fml)

I am a 30 year old mother of 2 and apparently single now being threatened with homelessness. I am terrified. I have 20k in debt from paying my own bills an expenses with my credit card since I got out of high school due to not being able to sustain a job. I do own a good car and I have the will and determination to keep going and stay strong. I dream of becoming successful one day and achieving freedom and peace but I am terrified. I guess this turned into a vent but I had to get some things out there because I know I’m not the only one struggling. I hope everyone finds the strength to keep pushing through any struggles they are facing and you make it to freedom and peace someday.",15,1736169055.0,LifeAdvice,20,0.94,False

1huymi2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1huymi2/can_we_still_be_friends_balancing_returning_her/,Can we still be friends? Balancing returning her sentimental items and moving on.,"So, I (29M) met this girl (25F) about 3 ½ months ago – we hit it off and hooked up. I didn’t think much of it at the time, but I felt a deep connection with her, and she asked me to exchange phone numbers. What was weird is that she trauma-dumped on me during the night we hooked up, telling me how her mom passed away when she was a kid.

The first few times we hung out, she seemed really into me, but she was flaky and always late. She would constantly lie about small things that I didn’t even care about. I called her out on it, and she stopped – except for the lying part. She told me how she didn’t want anything serious, how she hadn’t been in a relationship for six years, and how she only hooks up, etc. So, we agreed on a FWB-type scenario where I emphasized the friendship part. However, after one time, she started distancing herself – never initiating contact but always agreeing to hang out.

 

We started hanging out regularly—at least once a week—for several hours (sometimes 7-8 hours), but it was usually at a bar. Over time, I felt like we were growing closer, and there was a clear sense of romantic tension. She began opening up more; however, by the end of our meetups, she would always reiterate that she didn’t want anything serious. At times, she could be blunt or critical, making comments about me being boring, even though she consistently chose to spend so much time with me. She also insisted on tagging along with my friends when I had other plans, which made things awkward.

Fast forward a bit, and our hangouts turned into 2-3 times a week – after which she would always distance herself even more. She was doing this dance where she would literally invite me to her place, start getting close to me, like putting her legs over me or sitting extremely close to me, and then pull away panicking like she didn’t know what to do. She would make comments like, “We should have a scientific experiment where you blindfold me and we get physical,” but when I got close, she would pull away. This lasted for some time. I suggested that we should start dating – she wouldn’t say no but rather  invite me to her place. At that time, she started lending me some books.

She got sick, so we hadn’t seen each other for a few weeks – but when we met in person, we continued where we left off. We decided to go out drinking one night with my friends. I offered to pick her up, and she accepted but made a big deal out of it because “we are arriving together.” She invited us to her place after that, where she was extremely affectionate, sitting in my lap in front of my friends, touching my legs, etc. She suggested we send them home and that I stay over – so we called them a cab, but immediately after they left, she started pulling back again, saying she didn’t feel like having sex. I told her that I didn’t understand what was going on. We hung out for half an hour more, and I told her I was going to bed. We cuddled and held hands for hours in bed – just chatting, and then she hit me with, “This is wrong, but hand-holding made me horny. Let’s get physical, but if we do, we aren’t allowed to see each other ever again.” I told her no, and she said, “No kissing then,” which I also refused – and then we had the most passionate kiss ever. I left in the morning, and she lent me another book (I had asked about it a long time ago but didn’t even remember anymore – she just gave it to me). It was a personal book, which was her mom’s gift to a friend who later gave it to her. However, there was a lot of stuff underlined in the book, so I asked her who had underlined it – after which she pulled away again.

 

After that, she was extremely distant. She avoided meeting up for three weeks. We finally met up with a friend of mine, and she told me she had been avoiding me because she got into a relationship two weeks ago and it wouldn’t be fair if she were still hanging out with me (but she had no problem sleeping with a married guy before that, and she would even defend him, saying how considerate he was because he didn’t want to divorce because of the kids). I told her I would still like to continue hanging out and that I would respect her choices because, honestly, I really do care about her and wouldn’t want to cut her out of my life. She mentioned multiple times that we wouldn’t hang out one-on-one ever again. After the bar closed, I told her to come to my place so I could give her stuff back (which she had mentioned multiple times how sentimental it was). I was already in the car, and she called me, telling me to come to another bar. She then proceeded to attack me – saying she would never date me, that she was only hanging out with me because she didn’t have anyone else to hang out with, that she only accepted my invitations to hang out because she didn’t want to be rude, and tried gaslighting me that stuff that happened never happened. In all of that, she said something along the lines of, “You haven’t even experienced anything in your life” – which I took to mean I hadn’t traveled a lot or similar. I sarcastically answered, “No, you did,” and then she started crying and told me again how young her mom was when she died. I tried explaining that I didn’t understand her comment in that context. I asked her if she wanted to talk about what happened as well. I have some stuff that I’ve been through (not as heavy, obviously), so I opened up as well, and at that point, we were both crying. She told me she was sorry she ever met me, that she just lost all respect for me, and then blocked me on socials in front of me. She told me she was going to the bathroom, then messaged me a few minutes later saying she had to leave because she was not in the mood to talk anymore and that we would see each other next time. She didn’t even send me a happy new year text (she didn’t block my phone number).

Now – I know this is quite a story; however, I really do care about her and would like to stay in her life as a friend. I have no idea why. I have no idea how to proceed with this. At the very least, I would like to return the stuff she lent me, as she mentioned multiple times how important it is to her. I was thinking of sending her a message asking if she wants to pick her stuff up, if I should mail it to her, or if I should bring it next time when we see each other (if ever). This is hard for me because I feel like I lost the last bit of self-respect I had, especially after she told me she was only hanging out with me because she didn’t have anyone else to hang out with (which seems contradictory – multiple times she left coffee with her friends to hang out with me – unless she was lying). But I don’t want to feel like I’m hurting someone by not returning their sentimental belongings.



**TL;DR**: I (29M) met a girl (25F) 3.5 months ago and developed a complicated FWB relationship. She often sent mixed signals—being affectionate, spending hours with me, and lending me sentimental items—only to pull away, act rude, and remind me she didn’t want anything serious. Recently, she revealed she started dating someone else, avoided me for weeks, and told me she only hung out with me out of politeness. During an argument, she claimed I hadn’t “been through anything in life.” I misunderstood and responded sarcastically, which made her cry and bring up her mom’s death. We both got emotional, and she ultimately blocked me on socials but not on my phone.

I still care about her and want to stay friends, though I don’t know why. At the very least, I want to return the sentimental items she lent me (she’s mentioned how important they are). I was thinking of messaging her to ask if she wants to pick them up, mail them, or wait until we (potentially) see each other again?",1,1736168993.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

Women search for the following essential qualities in a contemporary dating app:

1. **Safety as the Top Priority:** It is crucial to include strong safety measures like activity transparency, reporting systems, and profile verification. This is where apps like NO NAMES shine, giving women comfort by guaranteeing safe interactions.
2. **Meaningful Associations:** Quality is more important to women than quantity. Instead than using a swipe-and-chat approach, NO NAMES allows users to organize meaningful dates. This method promotes deep, stress-free interactions, whether it's through a lighthearted coffee date or an enjoyable outdoor activity.
3. **Customization & Filters:** Women can find the appropriate person more easily with features that let them filter matches based on preferences like common values, interests, or hobbies.
4. **Empowerment Through Choice:** Women value applications that allow them to choose how and when to engage. For example, [NO NAMES](https://www.nonames.com/) encourages real connections without the typical chat fatigue by allowing users to join plans at their own pace.

Safety, genuineness, and meaningful interactions should be the top priorities of modern dating applications, and NO NAMES is spearheading this movement by reinventing the way relationships are formed. Are you prepared to try it?

The following advice can help women discover real connections while feeling safe and secure:

1. **Select Apps That Put Safety First:** Choose apps like [NO NAMES](https://www.nonames.com/), which include national ID verification and profile protection. In order to let you concentrate on deep connections without the stress of constant messaging, NO NAMES even avoids the typical chitchat and allows users to arrange dates.
2. **Use Information Selectively:** Share just enough to pique attention, but refrain from giving up private information at first, such as your home location or place of employment. Being careful what you post is the first step toward safety.
3. **Trust Your Instincts:** Don't be afraid to report or block someone whose behavior seems strange. Make dating easy and give yourself the confidence to have it all.
4. **Meet in Public:** For initial meetings, always pick a public setting. The best places to meet new people in a safe setting are coffee shops, parks, or group activities.
5. **Own Your Confidence:** Keep in mind that you are in charge. Embrace your ability to make choices that seem right for you, whether that means deciding who to meet or establishing limits.

I was laid off in October from my job and it’s not been easy to find another. Since then I’ve become engaged to a wonderful man who owns property 3 hours away (I drive to see him on weekends) and since my lease ends on January 26th and my kids 1st semester ends the 24th - everything just fell into place for us to be able to move and not struggle anymore - I do receive unemployment, but it isn’t nearly enough to not struggle month to month. I will also be working with my fiancé and will be making more than I did at my last job. 

The high school my teens will be attending is 4 years old with excellent career focused programs to prepare teens for their future. The size is less than half of their current school and even though it may not matter - the probability of my son getting on the soccer team is a lot more feasible than it was this last year. Both are excited for the move and the opportunities. We saw it as a blessing that timing just seemed to be working out….. 

On December 1st I contacted their father to sit down for coffee (something that has never happened in the 12+ years since he first took me to court and I was awarded sole legal custody) because I wanted to talk with him in person about the move. I presented the paperwork on the schools. Let him know of engagement and job situation. I told him I understood that he may not want to drive and offered to drive to and from every other weekend. Currently he has every weekend but during soccer season was allowing kids to stay with me overnight on Friday’s to make the games since he didn’t want to drive them to the games and only made it to one in 4 years of spring and summer soccer sessions for our son. I said that I felt if was best to discuss with him in person and work it out as parents and I was open to suggestions and wanted to hopefully deal with it out of court. He agreed. Thanked me for coming to him “like a man” in person. Two weeks later - he asked to meet again for coffee to “discuss details” - I ordered his coffee and sat there only to have his sister walk in and serve me papers contesting the move…
I can’t sleep because I’m so anxious over the situation because I have no idea what we will do if they force us to not move. The teens (17 & 15 in 2 weeks) want to be part of the initial hearing so they can say their part because they want the move and he wont listen to them. He told them I’m lying about not having a job and says we can live with my parents (who have my sister and her 9 year old living with them and there is not room for us and how can he make that call - they do not talk) which would put the teens in another school district than our current one anyway. I’m willing to drive them every weekend if I need to until our modification hearing in May. Our first hearing is January 16th … with the lease ending on the 26th. 

Do I have a chance ? 
Is it a good idea for the teens to be there and plead their sides or will it cause issues with their father who can be pretty intimidating? 
Does anyone have any success stories on relocating ?

We all have those moments where we wake up, look in the mirror, and think, ""Wow, I’m really channeling my inner jerk today."" It happens to the best of us! But fear not—just because you’re feeling like an asshole doesn’t mean you have to stay that way. Refreshing your attitude is totally doable! Here’s your guide to hitting that delightful ‘restart’ button when you’re feeling a little grumpy. Let’s dive in!

### 1. **Recognize the Jerkiness 🚦**
First things first, give yourself a little reality check. Acknowledge that feeling like a jerk is totally normal (seriously, we’ve all been there). It’s like realizing you're wearing mismatched socks—you can either embrace it or fix it! 

### 2. **Take a Breather 🌬️**
If you feel that inner grouch bubbling up, take a moment to breathe deeply. Inhale positivity, exhale negativity. It’s like a mini-reset for your brain—plus, it helps prevent any spontaneous snappy comments like, “What are you doing with your life?” when someone asks you for the time.

### 3. **Ask Yourself “Why?” 🤔**
Why are you feeling like an asshole? Is it stress, hunger, or perhaps a case of the “Monday Blues”? Understanding the root cause can help clear away the cobwebs. And if it’s hunger, well, grab a snack! Your inner jerk might just be a grumpy stomach.

### 4. **Change Your Scene 🎭**
Sometimes, all you need is a change of scenery. Go for a brisk walk outside, stare at a cute dog, or maybe even find a cozy corner with a good book. A different environment can work wonders! Just don’t get lost in IKEA... that’s a different rabbit hole.

### 5. **Channel Your Inner Cheerleader 📣**
Seriously, take a moment to pump yourself up. Stand in front of a mirror and say, “I am NOT an asshole. I am fabulous and capable of good vibes!” A little self-love and affirmation never hurt anyone (though it might raise some eyebrows from onlookers).

### 6. **Visualize Kindness 🌈**
Picture yourself as a kindness ninja, spreading good vibes left and right. Imagine your smile igniting joy like fireworks. If you can see it, you can be it! Just picture everyone wearing tiny happiness capes; it’ll have you chuckling in no time.

### 7. **Practice Gratitude 🥰**
Write down a few things you’re grateful for. “I’m grateful for coffee, the sunshine, and those new cat memes.” Focusing on the good stuff shifts your mindset. Before you know it, you’ll be like, “Who needs to be an asshole when life’s this great?”

### 8. **Engage in a Quick Activity 🏃‍♀️**
Jumping jacks? A quick dance party? Whatever gets you moving! Exercise releases endorphins, which have been scientifically proven to be nature's great mood elevator. Who knew shaking your groove thing could save the day?

### 9. **Connect with a Friend ☕**
Reach out to someone for a chat—preferably a friend who knows how to ditch the drama. Share your feelings and let them remind you just how fabulous you truly are. And they might give you a dose of laughter too—bonus points!

### 10. **End on a Positive Note 🌜**
As your day winds down, jot down one good thing that happened. It could be as simple as finishing that project you’d been procrastinating on or finally mastering the art of boiling an egg. Celebrate it! Embrace those little victories like they’re the last bite of a gooey brownie.

Remember, everyone has their off days, but you don’t have to stay stuck in that crabby mindset. With a little self-love and humor, you can turn that “asshole energy” into something way more fabulous.

Perpetua’s Idaho mine is [expected](https://perpetuaresources.com/antimony/) to meet a third, or 35%, of US antimony needs by 2028.

In the US, the main [primary consumption](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2024/mcs2024-antimony.pdf) of antimony in 2023, were:

* 43%, metal products, including antimonial lead and ammunition
* 35%, flame retardants
* 22%, nonmetal products, including ceramics and glass and rubber products



Antimony is listed as a critical mineral in the [US](https://www.energy.gov/cmm/what-are-critical-materials-and-critical-minerals), [EU](https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/sectors/raw-materials/areas-specific-interest/critical-raw-materials_en), [Japan and Australia](https://www.antimony.com/regulations-compliance/criticalitycircularity/#:~:text=Antimony%20is%20recognized%20as%20a,limited%20substitution%20options).

# Artificial Intelligence and the next Critical Mineral Supercycle REPORT:

[Artificial Intelligence and the next critical mineral supercycle - The Oregon Group - Critical Minerals and Energy Intelligence](https://theoregongroup.com/artificial-intelligence-and-the-next-critical-mineral-supercycle/)

https://preview.redd.it/son9cbjabdbe1.png?width=1819&format=png&auto=webp&s=98c70cbfce5300083a348a7d7942ed8eafccf274

The explosion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) expected to spark a 10-year critical mineral supercycle as the massive energy needs of new AI data centers will increase pressure on global supply chains already under strain to meet global net-zero targets.

The Oregon Group predicts this growth in demand will be driven by a potent combination of technology companies, consumer and business demand, and government support, all racing to maintain a global cutting edge. 

**The Oregon Group has decades worth of experience and connections with explorers, developers, and producers in the critical minerals sector.** 

The report — “Artificial Intelligence and the next critical mineral supercycle” — examines how years of underinvestment in new mines, concentrated supply and processing in high-risk regions, as well as rising demand for minerals to meet net-zero targets, means supply will struggle to keep pace with the potential AI demand that is only now starting to be appreciated.

The large tech companies are betting hundreds of billions on new data centers — Amazon plans to spend US$150 billion over the next 15 years on data centers — as they are already facing challenges to their ambitions of AI growth. 

McKinsey forecasts generative AI has the potential to generate value equivalent to $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion in global corporate profits annually. 

The combined incentives of significant corporate profits, technological advancements, environmental restrictions and consumer pressure, will overcome many of the obstacles to investment across the sector, even those hindering net-zero targets. Included in The Oregon Group report:

# JAN. 1st, 2025~ The Rare Earth Landscape 2025 Part II – Shifting Sands: From Engineering to Finance and the Erosion of Supply Chain Competence

https://preview.redd.it/dgm1j9lobdbe1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8404cb2ab7c42854a7f387cade25a990db7327b

The Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) American automotive industry’s efforts to secure domestic supplies of the necessary critical technology mineral forms for their suppliers and themselves that satisfy the Federal government’s political pressure to avoid using any production materials with Chinese “content ” have reached the point where the OEMs have been pushed beyond their capability to perform technical due diligence and risk-benefit assessments.

I have determined why securing a supply of non-Chinese “content” rare earth permanent magnet motors for the OEM American domestic automotive assembly industry has been so slow and poorly executed. The OEMs’ sourcing departments lack the core competency to do the job. A perfect paradigm example is General Motors’ (NYSE: GM) “investments” in singular entities in the natural resource production or end-user product manufacturing supply chains for lithium-ion batteries and rare earth permanent magnet motors (REPMM). The OEMs have failed to notice that unless there is vertical integration so that costs can be distributed along the supply chain and result in a profitable end-use product, then subsidies become mandatory.

The short-sighted focus on mineral exploration and discovery has masked the deficit in downstream industrial operations necessary to the production of the rare earth permanent magnet motors that form the overwhelming part of the demand for rare earths in the economy, both military and civilian. The military sector has recognized this, and since, internally, it acts as if it operates in a command economy where price only limits the quantity of purchases, it has organized a domestic American production part of the total supply chain for rare earth permanent magnet motors for its own benefit.

In addition to failure to understand the composition of the REPMM supply chain and its material and financial stress points, the financial managers who today dominate non-military OEM management believe that the government will always bail them out in the event of a catastrophic failure to be profitable and that they, the top managers, will face no personal consequences from any perceived or even revealed management incompetence. Thus they assume that subsidies and/or tariffs will be forthcoming.

The real problem, even in the command-based military sub-economy, is the lack of access to critical mineral supplies not originating under Chinese ownership or control. Such supplies are due to geological as well as geopolitical history and the market economics that control their profitable production.

Historically, the economics of producing the separated purified individual rare earth salts necessary to produce the rare earth permanent magnet motors that form the actual demand for rare earths moved not only the production and refining of the minerals but also the vast bulk of the supporting total supply chain for the motors to China more than a generation ago.

The American, European, and Japanese scientists and engineers who had created the knowledge, choices, chemical and metallurgical equipment, and organizational skills to mass-produce REPMs went to China to teach the locals how to do all this and then returned home to mostly different employment or retirement as the domestic American and European industries dried up.

The fantasy among politicians and ignorant reporters who do not know or understand the manufacturing supply chains for critical technologies is that Americans’ “can do” mentality along with unlimited capital can overcome “lost access to the critical minerals, the knowledge, specialized equipment, and manufacturing base.”

The US military seems to have understood this, and other than the mistake it has made in leaving mineral sourcing mainly in the hands of the processing and finished goods contractors, it has a good chance of achieving its apparent goal of 1000 tons per annum of specialized rare earth permanent magnets for warfighting applications by 2027 (the current deadline for eliminating Chinese content).

As for the OEM automotive sector, expect a decline in product quality as unproven, inexperienced suppliers are chosen, first out of ignorance of the subject matter’s supply chain details and then out of desperation.

**To:** Jim Sims <[Jim.Sims@niocorp.com](mailto:Jim.Sims@niocorp.com)\>  
**Subject:** Five Questions as we head into 2025!

Good Afternoon, Jim!

   As we wait with many....  I've gotta ask a few more questions leading up to a years end 2024 **REDDIT REVIEW** & the AGM! Rumor has it team Niocorp is in talks with the new administration as 2025 approaches. 

Jim - As 2024 nears an end- Trade Tariffs, China, Critical Minerals & a new administration are on deck. The table is set for Critical Minerals to take center stage.

1. *\*\*\*Are several entities such as (DoD, U.S. & Allied Governments & Private Industries) “STILL” Interested securing Off-take Agreements for Niocorp's remaining Critical Minerals (Titanium, Niobium 25%, Rare Earths, CaCO3, MgCO3 & some Iron stuff* ***as 2025 approaches?****) - Should Financing be secured??*

 RESPONSE:

***""Several USG agencies are working with us to potentially provide financing to the Elk Creek Project.  And, yes, we are in discussions with the National Defense Stockpile, which (like much of the USG) is much more intensely interested in seeing U.S. production of scandium catalyze a variety of defense and commercial technologies.""***

QUESTION #2) Niocorp has completed positive bench scale testing of magnetic rare earths from magnetic scrap. Is Niocorp now pursuing ""Pilot Plant studies at the site in Canada"" on the recycling of aforementioned materials? Could you offer comment on how that might continue.

 RESPONSE:

***""We have concluded all testing necessary at this time at our demonstration plant in Quebec to show the potential of our proposed system’s ability to recycle NdFeB magnets.""***

Also, the material news release above mentions the ""Fact"" Niocorp could utilize the new proprietary Separation methods now being undertaken for the separation of **(\*\*Other Feedstock Sources).**

 RESPONSE:

***""Yes.""***

QUESTION #3) Could Coal waste, or other mine feedstock sources be utilized. Please offer additional comment if you can do so on what ""Other Feedstock Sources"" might be in play? Or under Consideration from the team at Niocorp...

 RESPONSE:

***""Post-combustion ash from coal fired power plants is highly unlikely to ever become a commercially viable source of REEs.  There are a variety of other potential sources of REE mixed concentrate that we could possibly process.""***

 QUESTION #4) Is the New Trump Administration seeking to continue to build upon its commitment to mining the production & sourcing of domestic critical minerals? Comment if possible... 

 RESPONSE:

***""Very much so.""***

[NioCorp Completes Successful Initial Testing of Rare Earth Permanent Magnet Recycling | NioCorp Developments Ltd.](https://www.niocorp.com/niocorp-completes-successful-initial-testing-of-rare-earth-permanent-magnet-recycling/)\*\*Also, the material news release above mentions *“As no economic analysis has been completed on the rare earth mineral resource comprising the Elk Creek Project, further testing and studies are required before determining whether extraction of REEs can be reasonably justified and economically viable after taking account of all relevant factors.”*

**Gotta ask.... �**�

*5) Where does Niocorp stand on achieving the funds to complete/update the ""early as possible 2024 F.S.""?     Does Niocorp foresee this completion date now being pushed into 2025 given some further testing is now needing to be completed? Please comment if possible...*

We all have those days when we feel like we might just run into a few too many ""Mr. or Ms. Grumpy Pants"" types. But guess what? You don’t have to unleash your inner jerk to deal with them! Let’s sprinkle a little kindness into our day-to-day and kick the jerkiness to the curb. Here are **10 things you can do to be totally asshole-free today**—with a little humor to boot!

### 1. **Start with a Smile 😄**
Honestly, smiles are like free hugs for your face! Flash those pearly whites at folks you pass by. It might just confuse a grump and make their day a little brighter. Just be careful not to blind anyone with your radiant smile!

### 2. **Compliment a Stranger 👋**
You know that one time someone told you your shoes were fly? Make someone's day by complimenting them. “Hey, I love that hat! It looks like it's straight out of a fashion magazine!” They'll leave thinking, “Wow, people are genuinely nice.” 

### 3. **Practice Patience ⏳**
Stuck in traffic? Instead of channeling your inner “road rage warrior,” take a deep breath. Think about how many snacks you can devour in the time it takes to get home. Who knew traffic could be so delicious?

### 4. **Ask ""How are you?"" and Mean It ❤️**
When you ask someone how they're doing, really listen. Put your phone down, make eye contact, and be present. There’s power in genuine connection—plus, you might hear a juicy story or two. 

### 5. **Spread Random Acts of Kindness 🍩**
Buy a coffee for the person in line behind you or leave positive notes around the office. “You’re awesome!” stuck to a computer can make someone’s day. Just don’t leave any love notes for your boss unless you want that promotion... or a chat about professionalism.

### 6. **Laugh It Off 😂**
If someone behaves like a total jerk, instead of giving them a piece of your mind, laugh. Think of them as a cartoon character tripping over their own feet. You get to release tension and feel good without the drama. Plus, life’s too short not to giggle!

### 7. **Set Boundaries Like a Pro 🚧**
You don’t have to tolerate toxic behavior. It’s okay to say “no” or to walk away. Think of it like dodging a soccer ball; you don’t have to get hit if you just sidestep it!

### 8. **Be Grateful 🙏**
Take a minute to appreciate the little things—a cozy blanket, a tasty snack, or even that one fabulous pair of socks. Gratitude is like a warm fuzzy blanket for your soul. (And who doesn’t love a good blanket situation?)

### 9. **Practice Self-Care 🛁**
Taking care of yourself means you’re less likely to snap at others. Whether it’s a bubble bath, binge-watching your favorite show, or eating an entire pizza (hey, no judgment here), do what makes you feel good. A well-cared-for you is way less likely to turn into an asshole—guaranteed!

### 10. **End the Day on a Positive Note 🌙**
Before you crash into bed, reflect on one or two positive interactions you had during the day. Celebrate those small wins! Bonus points if you share a funny meme with a friend before bedtime. Laughter is the best pillow!

So there you have it! Ten simple ways to keep the jerkiness at bay and make the world just a little bit brighter. Remember, a little kindness can go a long way—like a warm slice of cake! 🍰

We held hands throughout the showing and hugged at the end. Me and him texted a healthy amount before that, nothing too personal or anything. After the movie, we texted to make plans for the next date and so he invited me to a New Year’s Eve party. I went and we had a great time, so after the party was over I went to his place and cuddled with him and stayed the night. There wasn’t sex, but we were touchy. The next day we sat down at a local coffee place and talked for a good bit for about an hour. We then walked to an antique store after that and looked around at stuff for another half hour. We talked about seeing another movie together plus a camping trip with his friends, so I decided to go and that was a couple days later. We saw the movie first, then we ate at a sandwich place before traveling to the state park to camp with 5 of his friends. Things at the sandwich place were okay for the most part but then it got a little awkward towards the end because we were running out of things to talk about, but the awkwardness was pretty short lived. He walked me to my car and then we headed out to the camp grounds. I met his friends and they seemed nice. They were much more talkative than me and I was pretty quiet for the most part. Everyone was drinking when we arrived and we sat at the fire for a good while and did a bit of late night walking around the area. They seemed okay with me for the most part, but in the morning there was some talking and we gathered around the fire, but then everyone goes quiet for a solid 3 minutes. I felt very awkward but I didn’t say anything and it was silent until one of his friends goes “This is devastating”. Not sure if he’s talking about the fire, but I ignored it. I was able to make some small conversation after that and after packing up our stuff we went to get breakfast. After that me and him go to his place, have sex, and then go to a new antique store.

1huxzrr,https://www.reddit.com/r/ask_Bondha/comments/1huxzrr/house_husbands/,house husbands,"i heard from so many men that they are willing to be house husbands if given chance but apparently women are not ready to marry a man who earns less or donot earn at all or that they look low of them.

so i have a qsn:

are y'll aware of all the things that fall into the 'house husband' category? like the things u need to do being a house husband

lemme summarize,

cooking,
washing dishes, 
cleaning the house,
taking care of kids like feeding,grooming(normal one) , changing their diapers , washing their ass every now and then, giving them showers.
then when they grow up getting them ready to school (from combing hair to putting socks on) , make them do the homework when they return,putting them to sleep.
and on weekend cleaning all the mess when they ruin all the house with the toys and stuff and taking care of them while ur wife is watching movies on her laptop and coming out of the room once in awhile to have food and peck the kids and go back to the room again (stfu cz thats wht most father do). 24*7


taking care of ur in-laws while also taking care of the kids.

and during festivals all of ur wife's relatives comes to ur house and beginning from coffee/tea in the mrng to making snacks , prepping meals for all of them while they all munch on that food and when they leave, cleaning all the mess all alone.
not to forget all the house cleaning u need to do during festivals.

ik few of yll didnt grow up in this kinda household but most of us did.

and not to mention a bonus where the husbands go around fucking other women , get some std and give it to wife (few scenarios).

so tell me male bondhas of this community , are yll aware of all the things that comes towards u when u choose to be a house husband?

1huxzaz,https://www.reddit.com/r/london/comments/1huxzaz/day_drinkingcinema_stratford_for_a_grief_filled/,Day drinking/cinema Stratford for a grief filled day?,"

Friday is going to be a bad grief filled day for me and I’ll be alone and off work. I was thinking of trying to do SOMETHING so that I don’t lie in bed all day so was debating going to Stratford and seeing a film and maybe having some drinks in the day. (Not too far from home so I could probably drag myself there). 

I’m just wondering if anyone knows if you can buy alcohol at the Stratford vue (or if I can maybe take in eg a takeaway coffee which I can add some rum to) and if there’s anywhere you’d suggest where I could get a drink afterwards which isn’t too far a walk

I was debating sitting in the food court for a bit as it’s quite anonymous and I could just have a beer and a bit of a cry with no bother but might be good to have another option. 

If it helps I’m female mid 30s

Thank you

Edit: just to add for those who are concerned I don’t plan to get completely smashed or put myself in an unsafe position. Just couple of glasses of wine or something to help take the edge off and get me out the house. ",5,1736166830.0,london,28,0.61,False

1huxv2e,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIYUK/comments/1huxv2e/please_help_me_decide_what_to_do_with_this/,Please help me decide what to do with this kitchen corner,"I haven't settled on the kitchen suppliers yet, however DIY Kitchens are at the top of the list. I've had appointments with Magnet, Wren and Wickes, and not impressed with the people. No disrespect intended, they are not ""designers"" in my view, they have little imagination and creativity to design you a kitchen. You have to do all that. I was hoping to get ideas for a modern, sleek, contemporary design with new ideas.

Any suggestions on who to talk to? I may have to contract to a qualified consultant.

Anyway, to the matter in hand. I need to decide what to do with this corner of the kitchen, as this end of the room was not designed for units and therefore has a few challenges.

[Kitchen Entry Wall - Window Corner](https://preview.redd.it/g1ef9sn55dbe1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c56bc603bc063eda469758c06c27215b954bda12)

I will have units on the wall opposite to this entry, where the gas hob, oven and fridge/freezer will be. Dishwasher will go in the ""island"". All fitted.

Looking at this back wall, in the corner by the window, the distance to the window edge and back wall is 54cm. The distance to the valve on the radiator to the back wall is 66cm. The radiator's face is exactly 12.5 cm from the wall. Measurements are +/- 2mm

Red is the radiator. Green is the window. Grey is the internal floor.

[Window Corner Dimensions](https://preview.redd.it/35a2hn225dbe1.png?width=291&format=png&auto=webp&s=a336341de7bca8a6620c944a6a0dd4f2a0f087ab)

In that corner I wanted to have a tall pull out larder. Not going to be able to do that because of the radiator.  I won't be able to put any ""pull out"" units on the floor, so what to do?

[Rad and Window](https://preview.redd.it/l6783yv96dbe1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c01e107514a60d062a63e18c975d7ad647e8ad94)

The rest of the wall would have wall and floor cupboards with the main use being the drinks station for coffee. And possibly green tea. Coffee machine, kettle etc. The cupboards would store what you can see on the shelves. Plates, less used pots, pans etc.

I'm now thinking of having a bank of wall cupboards, maybe a full height one by the window and then half sized the rest of the way to the door.

The bottom cupboards I am not sure of now. Probably a wide drawer for the coffee/tea and condiments. What do I put by the window? I don't drink alcohol so no wine rack and nothing that can be pulled out. An open cabinet maybe?

Any innovative ideas on what to put in the corner that could be coffee/tea related? Anyone care to show the corner units in their kitchen and what they did with those awkward spaces?

Here are the full dimensions for anyone that is interested. This the current measurements, not the new layout. I will replace the 60cm gas hob with a 90cm gas hob with wok burner. I'll replace the ""island"" with another one, same purpose.

How to best approach the dating scene? (long rant),"Hi, Im F22. No judgement whatsoever to anyone who does, but I just simply cannot fathom it in my experience. Maybe Im rather oldschool, maybe I dont live in reality, idk which one it is. I could never operate like that. Im too much of a feeler and monogamous and I do take people seriously. I crave connection, I invest fully in the person im seeing and my focus is solely on them.

Do people really go out on dates while simultaneously entertaining a bunch of other people, having them lined up, actively sleeping with them etc? So assuming im going out on a date with a guy whom I really like and want things to progress further, do you understand how much of a clown that makes me look - sitting across the table from him, talking, enjoying our coffee/meal, having a great time together, exchanging compliments, hearing him say how he'd love to get to know each other more ... to only know he's texting a bunch of other girls after we're done and have idk how many sleepovers with different women weekly? Like do you understand how detrimental that is for someone who views the person seriously and wants to date them? What's the point of taking me out or showing interest? Is it a competition of ""whoever from my roster impresses me more I'll take more seriously?"" Do they even have the time or headspace to develop feelings, process or think things through? Or do they senselessly jump from one thing to another completely numb and desensitised just ""for the plot""?

Ofc I can't say anything, it's their life, their right, their mentality. But do you see how for people who are genuine and want to connect with someone it's an ABSOLUTE CATASTROPHE? Like we'll go out, I'll like him more and more each time, will start falling for him to only know Im just a number on his list and he's only seeing me because some other number dropped him or it didnt work out ... ?

I have a date coming up with a 24yo guy I matched on Tinder... what should I do? How to best approach this? Should I go there entirely no expectations, casual, friendly etc? Not take him seriously at all? He compliments me and is super excited to see me (I left our hometown for uni within the first week we met but we kept in touch and now we're meeting during my winter break). Should I show my interest? Should I just view it as a one-time meeting and then nothing? What if he expects s3x or ONS and takes it as a given that that's what we're here to do ... ? Even if the concept of rosters is real, who would admit it upon asking? It's like an unspoken/unwritten ""rule"" kinda ...
